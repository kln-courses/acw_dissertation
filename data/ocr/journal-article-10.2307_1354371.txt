<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAFE HOUSE? BODY, BUILDING, AND THE QUESTION OF SECURITY The television series Millennium, which premiered in the United States in September 1996, pivots around two contrasting mise-en- scenes: the luminous yellow two-story house in relief against a bright blue sky, and the perpetual night and fog of threatening scenes of mayhem and violence. Established in the opening credit sequence and repeatedly evoked throughout each episode, this visual and the- matic opposition distills and refracts a range of fears and anxieties not only about the dangers of contemporary life but also about the con- ditions of security that might counteract those dangers. The image of the yellow house punctuates Millennium as the reminder of that which must be protected or restored. It appears less as a metonym or sym- bol for something else (family, domesticity, tranquility) than as a sig- nifier operating within a system of iconographic oppositions. Within the visual vocabulary of Millennium, the yellow house is the explicit and exact opposite of danger, violence, and disorder. Millennium maps security directly onto the yellow house; we might say that in the world imagined by Millennium, the signifier house signifies security. Throughout the postwar period, the house has held a signal place in the American cultural imaginary, providing an affective and sym- bolic locus for the virtues and desires through which the national subject is interpellated and normalized (heterosexuality, sexual repro- duction, work ethic, individual responsibility, sobriety, consumption, to name a few). In what can only be called a contemporary myth- ology, home ownership is held up as the supreme achievement of American adulthood. This mythology is underpinned by an array of subsidies, preferences, and prejudices that are granted additional force by the intense cultural identification of happiness, normalcy, Cultural Critique 45-Spring 2000-Copyright 2000 Regents of the University of Minnesota</page><page sequence="2">186 | SAMIRA KAWASH and success with the detached single family house. But where the suburban house has been taken as the material signifier of the Amer- ican dream in the postwar period, I argue that today the signifying function of the house is increasingly haunted by the darker underside of that dream. For while the imaginary ideal of the American dream house has always assumed a certain kind of security, many contem- porary revisionings of dwelling and housing in American culture bring the function of security in relation to the house into much sharper relief. As magazine features and sweepstakes prizes remind us, the dream house continues to function as a potent cultural sym- bol of material satisfaction; yet increasingly, the image of the house as source of consumer happiness is being supplemented, and even at times displaced, by the image of the house as source of material security. The thematic focus on the house itself in Millennium drama- tizes the emergence of this alternative inflection in the signifying and affective function of the house. In the apocalyptic imaginary of Millennium, the idyllic life pro- mised by the suburban dream house has given way to an ongoing nightmare. Frank Black is a former FBI criminal profiler who, when the series begins, has quit his job and fled the danger and chaos of Washington, D.C. Hoping for a fresh start, Black installs his wife and daughter in a picture-perfect house in a picture-perfect Seattle sub- urb, far from the urban mayhem of his previous career. But the battle against evil is everywhere, in the suburbs as much as the cities, and Frank is called to continue the struggle against the chaos and violence unleashed (according to the premise of the series) by the coming mil- lennium. Series creator Chris Carter insists that Millennium offers a hopeful response to a worsening situation: "The hope is that there can be something we can do to stem the tide of what seems to be an ever- growing, worsening situation in the world. And that is what Frank is about, too. He wants his family to live in a safe place. It is no accident that he painted the house yellow. You paint away the darkness" (Mil- lennium FAQ). In the context of disorder and mayhem, the yellow house punctuates the drama as a haven and a refuge, a safe house. Despite Millennium's commitment to a rigid boundary separating good from evil, however, the safe house is always at risk, itself insep- arable and finally indistinguishable from the scary world from which it seeks to insulate itself. The iconography of the series seems to</page><page sequence="3">SAFE HOUSE? I 187 suggest as much, revealing the futility of Frank's effort to "paint away the darkness"; Frank Black would appear to be the source and site of the darkness, domiciled in the heart of the yellow house which is meant to be a haven against that very darkness. In the second season (1997-1998), the Black family is further distanced from the ideal repre- sented by the yellow house; after wife Catherine and daughter Jordan are kidnapped and terrorized in the season opener, Frank realizes that he cannot protect his family and that he himself is bringing dan- ger into his safe house. At the close of the second season in May 1998, the yellow house stands empty and abandoned, a poignant reminder of the distance between dreams of familial safety and the malevolent reality that appears to engulf Frank and those dear to him. By positing the image of the safe house as the necessary counter- part to an amorphous supernatural danger, Millennium neatly side- steps the racial and class implications of the Black family's flight to the suburbs. The so-called white flight of the past three decades has been associated not with the menace of serial killers or supernatural forces, but rather with urban decay and the criminalization and patho- logization of a racialized urban underclass. As cultural commentators have argued, most recently and forcefully in relation to the Rodney King beating and ensuing trials, the economic and social privilege accruing to whiteness depends on and is reinforced by the projec- tion of chaos and criminality onto a fantasmatically conjured urban blackness (Butler; Crenshaw and Peller). From this perspective, we might view Millennium's obsession with evil forces as a "return of the repressed." In Millennium's nightmare, the white suburban comfort of the dream house is terrorized by a repressed alterity that returns in the form of a menacing other, an other uncanny in its intimacy because already embedded in the very heart of "whiteness." In this sense, the precarious status of Frank Black's safe house reflects even as it intensifies the fragility of whiteness. But if the repressed racial drama that underpins Millennium's schematic opposition between good and evil signals the interplay between suburban domestic safety and urban menace, or the interpenetration of white identity with the black other against which it defines itself, what is the significance of the house? Why is safety imagined architecturally? And what is the relation between the domestication of security and the wider context of social or racial conflict?</page><page sequence="4">188 | SAMIRA KAWASH Millennium's particular architectural imaginary reflects, I suggest, the manner in which the idea of housing or dwelling in contemporary U.S. culture (and perhaps in global contexts as well) is increasingly refracted through the image of the safe house. By "safe house," I do not mean a particular house or architectural style so much as a clus- ter of interrelated images, fantasies, ideals, and practices.1 What I am calling the safe house is simultaneously material and metaphorical, manifesting on the one side as a growing practice of architectural for- tification and on the other as a cultural imaginary that reinvests the traditional image of the house with new meanings and implications. Traditionally, the house has been taken to name the putative inter- iority of the domestic, the private, the feminine, and separates those forms of interiority from their exterior counterparts. The house is itself the boundary figure, the containing wall that by its physical presence materializes and secures the separation between interior and exterior, private and public. In the imaginary of the safe house this separation is refigured as fortification. The emphasis on separa- tion and enclosure in the house is certainly not new. The enclosure of the house has long been understood to correspond with and stand in for the less visible enclosures that have defined the boundaries of the liberal subject or the bourgeois family. The emergence of modern notions of privacy and individuality in the fifteenth and sixteenth cen- turies corresponded to architectural innovations such as separate bed- rooms and private studies; similarly, the nineteenth century empha- sis on feminine domesticity and familial intimacy was reflected in the efflorescence of the Victorian house and its derivatives. What is new is the way in which the safe house (as both a reimagining of housing and a practice of building) articulates and renders explicit a particu- lar logic of separation and enclosure, in terms of fortification, as a necessary counterpart to ever present dangers. The problem with the safe house, as suggested by Millennium's ongoing domestic crisis, is that the safe house is never safe. Indeed, the seriality (and the narrative pleasure) of Millennium is premised on the ongoing failure of Frank Black's safe house. Security in the narra- tive framework of Millennium necessarily fails, thereby assuring the viewer that each week will bring another confrontation with a newly menacing danger. Yet I would insist that the failure of security is more than a narrative device characteristic of a particular genre of</page><page sequence="5">SAFE HOUSE? 189 horror/detective fiction. The media confront us daily with anecdotal evidence of a widely perceived crisis in security. Each day, more weapons, more prisons, more controls, more police are needed to face the ever escalating dangers of contemporary society. And yet at the same time, every escalation in the security apparatus seems accom- panied by an increase in danger. The paradoxical status of security as seeming to provoke the very condition it aims to overcome raises a number of questions: Is the violence that accompanies security a con- tingent failure of security that will be eradicated by better security? Or is that violence an inherent aspect of security defined as enclosure, control, and order? And if, as I argue, the safe house is a structuring metaphor for this ideal of security, what does this tell us about safe houses and the safety of their inhabitants? The desire for security-of one's person, of home and family, of community or place-is a powerful one. My aim is less to critique that desire than to show that the palliatives of fortification commonly called "security" are not in fact so secure.2 This essay attempts to denaturalize the safe house, to expose its assumptions and workings, in order to emphasize the contingency of the idea of security that is embedded in and materialized by the safe house. In the first section, I consider the emergence of the safe house and its relation to current popular conceptions of security. In the subsequent section, I examine in a more theoretical vein the mutual determinations of house and body, especially evident in architectural and philosophical thinking. As an increasing corpus of feminist, Foucauldian, and phenomeno- logical "body theory" makes clear, we can no longer so simply locate body as a stable and bounded entity that would lend itself to the spatial (architectural) distinctions between inside and outside. And if body is always in a more complex, contingent, and emergent relation with environment (physical, social, historical), can the security of such a body be realized as enclosure of the body? Or does enclosure endanger body precisely to the extent that it forecloses and denies the very connections and interdependencies that make it possible for there to be any body at all? These questions are addressed in the third section of this essay, in which I argue that Todd Haynes's pessimistic vision in the 1995 film Safe suggests that the architectural analogy between safe house and safe body can only result in violence; there is no safety for the body as figured in terms of architectures of enclosure.</page><page sequence="6">190 | SAMIRA KAWASH Haynes's exploration of the relation between safety and safe houses suggests that security as enclosure is itself a form of violence; perhaps, then, security's dangers ultimately exceed the threats against which it fortifies. For what is secured by the safe house is not only the physical well-being of the bodies inside. More insidiously, the ideal of security embodied in the safe house shores up increasingly dif- fracted and untenable ideals of autonomous self and bounded body by invoking practices of exclusion, atomization, and enclosure, not only for the individual but equally for variously configured collectiv- ities perceived to be under siege. In this manner, the logic of the safe house works to counteract the decentering or dispersal of self, the diffusion and porousness of body, and the hybridity and multiplicity of communities. The pressures of such fragmentation and multiplicity increasingly challenge and disrupt traditional narratives and struc- tures of power and knowledge that are predicated on singular, auto- nomous, bounded, and fully self-present subjects; in this context, it would appear that the safe house aims to restore an ideal of body and self that only ever existed as ideal. In this sense, we are confronted not with the failure but with the fallacy of security as enclosure. If this is the case, then the task before us is not to perfect fortification, but to begin to imagine and create the conditions for alternative forms of security. In the conclusion to this essay, I will indicate one possibil- ity, a security that would begin from rather than seek to foreclose the relation and interdependence denied by security as enclosure. DREAM HOUSE, SAFE HOUSE My inquiry into the relation between the contemporary culture of security and the safe house finds its precursor in materialist feminist critiques of suburbia as both social formation and architectural form. Feminist scholars have been particularly interested in the role of the detached single-family house (as both ideal and as built form) in materializing and enforcing particular gender norms, even as women's experiences of the house and its meanings may diverge in significant ways. Crossing disciplinary lines of architecture, urban studies, geog- raphy, and social science, feminist accounts of suburb and city have</page><page sequence="7">SAFE HOUSE? I 191 approached housing as both cultural product and cultural producer of gendered meanings. From this point of view, the house is a forma- tive site for such cultural distinctions as home/work, reproduction/ production, private/public, interior/exterior, female/male.3 Feminist analysis has particularly focused attention on the gen- dered meanings and formations of the suburban dream house. In Redesigning the American Dream, Dolores Hayden chronicles the rise of the so-called dream house in the twentieth century postwar cul- tural imaginary. Hayden emphasizes the complex meaning of the dream house as an object of desire and identification that interpel- lated postwar generations into the interrelated narratives of upward class mobility, Americanization, and patriarchal family romance.4 Thus understood, the "dream" of the dream house is not confined to the desirability of material comfort or pseudopastoral beauty. In Hay- den's analysis, the single-family house materializes an ideology of separate spheres within the house, providing a backdrop against which gendered roles may be performed.5 What Hayden calls the "architecture of gender" is further reinforced by the geographical and social distinction between feminized suburb and masculinized city. Critics of the domestic ideal normalized in the dream house have pointed to its shortcomings and distortions, not only for middle-class women constrained by their domestic isolation, but also for variously configured extended families, people who are physically impaired, elderly or sick, adults without children, and others whose lives or needs do not conform to the architectural limitations of the single family home. One practical response to the failures of the dream house ideal has been the work of architects and designers who design, pro- pose, and sometimes build alternative housing. Much of this vision- ary labor begins from an explicit critique of the preference for single- family low-density housing characteristic of the suburban ideal. While the single-family house assumes division and separation both within and between households, designers of alternative housing seek ways to accommodate and encourage interdependence and community (Franck; Franck and Ahrentzen). Yet alternative housing projects based on communal and cooperative models of living, if implemented at all, have been generally confined to small and dispersed projects and have been compromised by demands arising from conventional</page><page sequence="8">192 | SAMIRA KAWASH housing expectations. Perhaps most importantly, they have not received the kind of widespread media attention that would make them appear as viable or practical alternatives.6 One particularly significant tendency in residential development has been quite opposite to that imagined by advocates of alternative housing: not to reduce separations between families and communi- ties but to fortify them. Increasingly evident, both in media represen- tations and in its impact on the national landscape, is what might be termed a generalized "forting up" of the house, the family, the self, and the community.7 In Fortress America: Gated Communities in the United States, Edward Blakely and Mary Snyder document the rise of exclusive suburban enclaves as a significant and disturbing trend in housing patterns of the past decade. Evan McKenzie's earlier study Privatopia: Homeowner Associations and the Rise of Residential Pri- vate Government had already pointed toward the long-term impact of the preference in new housing construction for "common interest developments" (CIDs-developments featuring the common owner- ship of property governed by restrictive covenants and enforced by homeowner associations). But while McKenzie emphasizes the anti- democratic implications of privatizing formerly public spaces and functions, Blakely and Snyder supplement McKenzie's critique by focusing on the role of security in enabling and advancing this trend. Their analysis suggests that in contemporary U.S. culture the domes- tic ideal signaled by the suburban detached house is increasingly gov- erned by the perceived imperative of physical and psychical safety. Dennis Judd's assessment of the outcome is perhaps prophetic: "the emphasis on security in some CIDs seems akin to a state of war" (161). A state of war in fact seems implicit in the sophisticated security tech- nologies that are available to home owners, many borrowed from embassies and military outposts (such as the "terrorist-proof security room" [Davis 248]). The fortified enclosure of domestic space is mir- rored in the move toward the enclosure and privatization of commer- cial and previously public spaces.8 Interestingly, in both commercial and residential architecture of the 1980s and 1990s, the fortification of exteriors has been accompanied by the opening up of interiors; one thinks of the increasingly elaborate galleria designs of enclosed shop- ping malls, of John Portman's immense "public" hotel atria, or the</page><page sequence="9">SAFE HOUSE? I 193 introduction of the great room to suburban domestic architectecture. Yet the apparent freedom of these expansive interiors is entirely dependent, it would seem, on the fortified walls that secure them. The emergent ideal of the safe house is only partially a matter of architectural practice. Even as the material work of designing and building new forms and structures contributes to the production or reinforcement of social and cultural meanings, so too does the dis- cursive work of representational practices invest existing forms and structures with particular meanings. Insofar as the single-family detached house is laden with social and cultural significance, it is not an inert physical structure but a dynamic signifier that both material- izes historically particular meanings and relations and contributes to the construction of such meanings and relations. Thus, it should not be surprising that the safe house is often (but not always) physically indistinguishable from what might in another context signify as a dream house (generally detached, single family, suburban, bungalow style). For example, the image of the yellow house in the opening of Millennium echoes the conventional image of the house that sets the stage for suburban situation comedies from The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (1952-1966) and Leave it to Beaver (1957-1963) to Roseanne (1988-1997) and Grace under Fire (1993-1997). The safe house doubles this iconic dream house, but with a difference. The meaning of the Millennium safe house is not inherent in the house itself, but rather emerges as the result of an explicit aesthetic contrast that pits the stylized, almost surreal image of the yellow house against the photo- graphically naturalized, "realistic" image of the Cleaver house (Leave it to Beaver) or the Connor house (Roseanne) characteristic of the sitcom frame. Insofar as the difference between "safe house" and "dream house" does not necessarily correspond to physical differences, the meaning of the safe house may be one of subtle inflection, and there- fore may be quite unstable and ambivalent. As the ambivalent signifying function of Millennium's yellow house suggests, the safe house is and is not the dream house; it is less an opposite than an uncanny double, refiguring the possibility of domestic happiness as the necessity of freedom from danger.9 Politi- cal philosophers commonly distinguish two types of freedom: posi- tive freedom, the freedom to act or to choose, and negative freedom,</page><page sequence="10">194 | SAMIRA KAWASH freedom from interference or threat. As the safe house emerges as a palimpsestic overlay of meanings on top of the framework of the suburban dream house, it is as though the house itself has become the slippery ground across which "freedom to" slides into "freedom from." The close intertwining of liberty and security in this slide between freedom to and freedom from indicates a dilemma at the heart of a political ideology that has traditionally placed individual (positive) freedom as the highest and most sacred good. For at what point does the freedom from threat and interference that appears as the neces- sary precondition to positive freedom fold back to destroy the very possibility of any freedom at all? In the emergent political and social rhetoric of security first, it is sometimes difficult to remember what all that security is supposed to achieve. As understood by feminist critics such as Hayden, the ideal of freedom in the archetypal dream house of the 1950s might be sum- marized in terms of positive freedom, in particular the freedom to consume (or at a minimum, to desire to consume), a freedom guar- anteed by the economic and political ascendence of the United States and U.S.-dominated capitalism. The gendered spaces of the dream house corresponded to an ideology of freedom as capitalist (mascu- line) economic freedom: the freedom to achieve the American dream, to work hard and prosper, the freedom to expand one's family into the expansive comforts of the dream house. Yet while the appeal of the dream house as a consumer good has not faded, the implicit meaning of freedom in the 1990s is as frequently aligned with con- sumer choice as it is with security. In an analysis of the rhetoric of freedom in contemporary Ameri- can political culture, Thomas Dumm argues that freedom "has become a synonym for personal security. To be secure is now understood by governmental authorities to be the first freedom" (127). Dumm sug- gests that "the intense focus on issues of criminality" in political and popular culture in the 1980s and 1990s is less a reflection of an empir- ical phenomenon than it is a symptom of a larger shift in emphasis in the conception of the relation between freedom and security. Today it is security rather than freedom per se that is invoked as the explicit precondition for happiness and success. Thus, President Clinton can explain: "without a certain amount of security people's lives are not</page><page sequence="11">SAFE HOUSE? I 195 ordered enough and they are not personally self-confident enough to undertake the changes necessary to triumph in the world we're living in."10 To take but one example, the antidrug, anticrime and antiterrorism policies of the past decade, policies that have been interpreted by critics as the most significant erosion in civil liber- ties in the history of the nation, can be depicted by supporters as strengthening the conditions of freedom rather than creating the pre- cursor to a police state. The appeal to security in these and other pub- lic initiatives would suggest that security is seen not as the natural result of good policies (as for example, a result of democratization, economic redistribution, or social justice), nor even as the eventual outcome of the inevitable spread of superior market/democratic ide- ologies (as in the end-of-history thesis), but rather as a precondition for (and means to) any other social good. In practice, the principle of some other desirable social good seems to fade from view, and secu- rity becomes instead an end in itself. Traditionally, the house has represented the spatial locus of the patriarchal family, not only sheltering its members, but equally delimiting the boundaries of the father's private domain for which he provides and over which he protects. Yet the security of the family suggested by the patriarchal house exists today in uneasy tension with a security increasingly defined not as the condition of a com- munity or of a family, but ultimately as the security of the individual. It is particularly striking that, in contrast to the image of family as feminized haven and refuge from the toils and pressures of public and commercial life that developed in conjunction with the rise of industrial production in the nineteenth century, the family today is frequently represented as a source of potential danger to its individ- ual members. In the familiar punch line of therapeutic culture, every family is dysfunctional-and therefore damaging to the psychological well-being of its members. In its most extreme forms of dysfunction- ality, the family appears as the scene of total breakdown of the most fundamental social alliances and allegiances. The media continually reproduce a scenario in which each family member is pitted against all others: of parents abusing children, spouses, and elders; murder- ous children; parents on drugs, children on drugs; children and par- ents spying on each other for evidence of illegal activity. As a living</page><page sequence="12">196 | SAMIRA KAWASH arrangement, the family is reduced to a community of convenience or economy, one which is easily dismantled or transformed, into and from which particular members enter and leave at will, with the tacit understanding that there is no larger allegiance that binds them. These scenes of familial collapse have been seized on by the con- servative right as evidence of a society in moral decay. Yet it should not be surprising that a family ideal that emerged in relation to one particular stage of industrial capitalism should increasingly come under stress as the social relations structured in relation to produc- tion come into conflict with the social relations demanded by con- sumer and information economies. Where the opposition between masculine work and feminine home formed the ideological basis for the bourgeois nuclear family of the turn of the century (Boydston), today the opposition between home and work is increasingly blurred by both innovative communications technologies and increasingly flexible work patterns. As Emily Martin has argued in interpreting the rise of the rhetoric of "flexibility," the agility and speed that seem requisite to competitiveness in the contemporary economy of global and unregulated markets require that each body be atomized and inserted into circuits of consumption and production as an individ- ual, separable, and ultimately dispensable unit. It would appear that the intensified commodification of every aspect of body and life that is typical of the late stage of capitalism renders the nuclear family unit of industrial capitalism, defined by the gendered and spatial division of productive and reproductive labor, obsolete. Indeed, the family has itself become a consumer good, such that a return to tradi- tional male and female roles in the household has been transformed into a purchasing decision (which is perhaps a more cynical way of noting the manner in which conservative family values rhetoric posits an image of the family that is economically out of reach for most Americans). Thus, the image of the secure patriarchal family that accompanies the traditional terrain of the dream house (a terrain nos- talgically evoked by the family values punditry) persists in an uneasy tension with an increasingly atomistic vision of security determined at the boundary of the individual body. If contact and relation within the family are no more secure than contact and relation with those outside, then the safety of the safe house is ultimately individual; ideally, each one would claim his or her own safe house.</page><page sequence="13">SAFE HOUSE? I 197 ARCHITECTURE, SECURITY, AND THE BODY It is perhaps not so surprising that the house should be aligned with security. After all, the house is most commonly understood to be the architectural form corresponding to the basic human need for shelter from the dangers and discomforts of the surrounding environment. Yet the connection between architecture and security in the contem- porary context is more specific than suggested by the function of shelter. For while the idea of shelter may emphasize an array of rela- tions (such as nurture, privacy, comfort, as well as physical security), and while the need or desire for shelter may be met in many ways (both physical and psychological), the implicit definition of security driving both political and popular responses is the architectural enclosure, security as what Charles Jencks has called "wallification" (217). The architectural logic of security that informs contemporary practice is specified, I would suggest, not simply as the building of shelter but more particularly as the building of walls, divisions, and enclosures. One way of understanding this increasingly explicit con- nection between architecture and security is in relation to recent ver- sions of architecture's own foundational myths, which simultaneously establish the nature of architecture and the nature of the human beings architecture must serve. In the latter part of the twentieth century, architecture's etiological narratives have been especially impacted by the world-shattering effects of war as well as the influence of phe- nomenology (particularly Heidegger and Bachelard) on both philo- sophical and architectural thought. In the context of these historical and theoretical developments, explanations (myths) of architecture's origins and purpose have emphasized the place-making and meaning- conferring function of architecture and interpreted architecture as a redemptive practice that creates or restores Man's (sic) place in the World." A particularly telling version of the story is that recounted by Karsten Harries in The Ethical Function of Architecture. Harries follows in a long-standing tradition that locates the mythical origins of archi- tecture in Adam and Eve's exile from paradise (although Harries differs from his predecessors insofar as he emphasizes the mythical status of all origin narratives). As Harries points out, there was no architecture in Eden; some have speculated that perhaps God was</page><page sequence="14">198 | SAMIRA KAWASH remiss in failing to provide the originary couple with a house. Yet Harries counters: What need was there in paradise for a house? Were Adam and Eve not well provided for in that walled garden? Only the Fall, which cast them out of paradise and forced them to toil on cursed ground, brought with it the necessity of building. Now human work had to remedy the deficiency of a world that transgression had rendered inhospitable, wresting from it a place that would allow for a more secure dwelling and in some measure make up for what had been lost. (137) In Harries's account of Eden, the house comes about to secure a place in the midst of an insecure and disorderly world. This lapsarian nar- rative imagines paradise as a place without walls (which, sympto- matically, requires a wall to enclose it and separate it from the non- paradise outside); the fall is the discovery of the wall, the knowledge of a potentially dangerous outside against which the inside must be secured. Adam and Eve's compensation for the fall is that they will themselves master the architectural gesture of enclosing and thereby securing some interior. The origin of security in this narrative is the same as the origin of dwelling and the origin of architecture. And in each case-security, dwelling, architecture-these elements become a less-than-perfect compensation for a lost condition. They are responses to a world seen as already fallen, a world seen as riddled with dangers and confronting with hostility the fragile and lone-standing human figure.12 Harries's phenomenological account of the nature of architecture begins from the assumption of the natural necessity of secure dwelling to human being. In contrast, critics of the humanist tradition (to which Harries's work belongs) have been more inclined to emphasize the ideological significance of the assumed convergence of individual and architectural enclosure under the banner of security. We can look to Marx's 1843 essay "On the Jewish Question" for a quite succinct summary of the role of security in relation to the individual in liberal modern society: Security is the supreme concept of civil society; the concept of the police. The whole society exists only in order to guarantee for each of its members the preservation of his person, his rights and his property....</page><page sequence="15">SAFE HOUSE? i 199 The concept of security is not enough to raise civil society above its ego- ism. Security is, rather, the assurance of its egoism. (42) Marx suggests that the determination of the self in terms of security is a central feature of liberal individualism. In this formulation, secu- rity of self and security of property appear as interchangeable. This ideological collapse of person and property would coincide, in Marx's account, with the development and spread of a capitalist economic system emphasizing exchange value and thereby the equivalence and potential substitutability of all economic elements. Marx's diag- nosis of the relation between security and egoism points toward a structural homology, but falls short of naming the principle of simi- larity joining security of property and security of self. If security is the assurance of egoism, it is because both security and the self have been understood in terms of spatial relations. That is, the preserva- tion of "his person, his rights and his property" is indexed to an unspoken body that both locates the space of the person and (recip- rocally) provides the first spatial and material instance of the person's property.13 Thus, to fully understand the implications and resonances of security in current discourse and practice, we must look not to eco- nomic or political theory but to a tradition of thinking that explicitly addresses the role of space and of the body in relation to security: architecture. In the Western tradition of architectural theory, the body has long been taken to be "the foundation myth of building" (Vidler 71). Perhaps the most famous architectural image is not of a building, but of a body: Leonardo da Vinci's fifteenth-century sketch of "Vitruvian man," an illustration of Vitruvius's explanation of classical propor- tion based on the proportions of the male body. The body thus envi- sioned-naked, natural, outside society or history-has been the basis for the anthropomorphic analogy that has dominated architec- tural thinking in the West (at least until modernism shifted its em- phasis toward technological or machinic metaphors, although Vidler and others have argued that the anthropomorphic analogy persists submerged as a basis for the rationalization of form in modernist architecture). Today, however, this Vitruvian body comes under intense scru- tiny from every side: from feminists and antiracists who note the</page><page sequence="16">200 | SAMIRA KAWASH social and historical specificity of the supposed universal body; from theorists influenced by phenomenology who dispute the separation of subject from object or of a body from its others; from the biomedical sciences, where immunology and virology are troubling traditional notions of bounded and discrete organisms; from telecommunications technologies, which refigure the singularity of the body through var- ious forms of virtualization; and, most relevant for this essay, from working architects, who continue to build for human bodies even as the matter of what those bodies are becomes increasingly difficult to determine. In an essay extremely important to the argument I am making here titled "Architecture Dismembered," Anthony Vidler proposes that an array of architects commonly described as postmodern, in- cluding Coop Himmelblau, Bernard Tschumi, and Daniel Libeskind, might be seen as working through a reconsideration of the body and its relation to building. Like the architecture of the Vitruvian tradi- tion, these architects are "concerned to propose a reinscription of the body in their work, as referent and figurative inspiration. But this renewed appeal to corporeal metaphors is evidently based on a 'body' radically different from that at the center of the humanist tradition. As described in architectural form, it seems to be a body in pieces, fragmented, if not deliberately torn apart and mutilated almost beyond recognition" (69). Thus, Vidler suggests that this "dismem- bering" architecture continues in the Vitruvian tradition of represent- ing body as building, yet breaks with the humanist understanding of body as unified and whole in favor of "the fragmented, the morsel- ated, the broken" (70). If the humanist body can no longer be credited as a natural basis for building, such that building will represent or repeat a prior body, how might we reconceptualize this relation between body and build- ing? This question is taken up by recent inquiries into the interrela- tion between and mutual constitution of body and space (inspired in part by Foucault's investigations of the spatial workings of power coupled with his reconception of the body as both product and locus of shifting powers). From this perspective, rather than naming a sta- tic corporeal form that architecture simply mirrors, the "architectural body" must be understood as an emergent process whereby body and building are simultaneously formed and rendered meaningful.</page><page sequence="17">SAFE HOUSE? | 201 Thus, emphasizing the role of process, conceptual artists Arakawa and Gins describe the architectural body as "the body inextricably linked with architectural surrounds that are activated by it and that activate it" (169). This interplay is also emphasized by Elizabeth Grosz in her work on bodies and urban space: "The city is one of the crucial factors in the social production of (sexed) corporeality: the built environment provides the context and coordinates for contem- porary forms of the body" (104). From this perspective, architecture is inseparable from the emergent, socially and spatially constructed body. The architectural body reconceptualized as emergent process rather than static form points toward the mutual and interrelated formation and determination of body and place, such that body is always necessarily located, and place is always necessarily embodied (Kawash 1998b, 330-34). I want to pause at this juncture to point out that my aim here is less to deconstruct the humanist body in order to prove the error of the Vitruvian tradition than to gain some critical leverage in relation to the anthropomorphic analogy the tradition has authorized. Because, despite all the reasons (toward which I gestured above) to be wary of the humanist body, that humanist body retains an enormous nor- malizing and enabling power. It is perhaps more useful to consider the forces and rhetorics that sustain such a body than simply to dis- miss it as antiquated or wrong. For similar reasons, it seems useful to me to focus attention not on the architectural avant-garde that has embraced-theoretically and in practice-a deconstructive critique of subject, body, and place, but on the more mundane architectures of everyday life where the implications of such critiques have yet to be fully realized. The manner in which the humanist body becomes identified (and persists) as a pre-architectural, natural body has much to do, I would argue, with the workings of the traditional anthropomorphic analogy. For if the classical humanist interpretation of the analogy implies that the building simply repeats or represents a prior natural body, the analogy also works to form and to normalize a particular image of the body. Put another way, if body is the foundation myth of building, we might also consider the way in which building is the foundation myth of body. To the extent that the body in the Western philosophical tradition is understood as giving place or extension to</page><page sequence="18">202 | SAMIRA KAWASH the self in the world, or as shell and shelter for the self, it would appear that such a body cannot be thought independently from arch- itectural figures. Building repeats body, but the body that building claims simply to repeat is always already a sort of building. Particu- lar aspects of the traditional building-that it is upright and free- standing, that it is a coherent and separate unit, that it consists of an interior bounded and separated from an exterior-thus reappear as signal qualities of an Enlightenment understanding of body and self that has persisted even into the twentieth century. It is not only a particular ideal of body but equally a particu- lar form of subjectivity that is buttressed by the traditional anthro- pomorphic analogy. In particular, the philosophical tendency after Descartes toward the interiorization of subjectivity can be seen to rely on the workings of architectural metaphors. Although the connection between the materiality of the architectural edifice and the mate- riality of the body provides the most obvious basis for analogy, the building/body quickly becomes a metaphor for the self, the one whose place is the body/building. For example, in The Poetics of Space Bache- lard argues that the attraction of poetical images of the house is because the house as intimate inhabited space corresponds to the "topography of our intimate being," a topography that provides the basis for the distinction or relation between the exterior outside and the intimate interior: "Without [the house], man would be a dispersed being. It maintains him through the storms of the heavens and through those of life. It is body and soul. It is the human being's first world.... Life begins well, it begins enclosed, protected, all warm in the bosom of the house" (xxxvi, 7). But where Bachelard perceives the significance of the house in its correspondence to the essence of human being-in-the-world, Mark Wigley's analysis of the work of architectural metaphors in philosophy suggests that this correspon- dence is not as essential as Bachelard takes it to be. Rather, Wigley argues that the correspondence between the idea of essence and the idea of the house is the result of a philosophical tradition that has constructed the idea of presence and interiority out of the spatial fig- ure of the house: The house is always first understood as the most primitive drawing of a line that produces an inside opposed to an outside, a line that acts as</page><page sequence="19">SAFE HOUSE? I 203 a mechanism of domestication. It is as the paradigm of interiority that the house is indispensable to philosophy, establishing the distinction between the interiority of presence and the exteriority of representation on which the discourse depends. (1993, 104) This foundational distinction between exterior and interior further re- fines the architectural analogy between house and body: as the house establishes the distinction between inside and outside, the body sim- ilarly corresponds to the boundary of spatial interiority that is the material counterpart to the mental interiority of the modern subject. For a more explicit expression of the metaphoric significance of the house for the discursive construction of the natural body, we might turn to the analysis of housing in the architectural textbook Body, Memory, and Architecture. An explicit attack on modernist prin- ciples of formalism and abstraction, this text was one of the first to bring phenomenological insights regarding embodied experience and perception to bear on the architectural project. The authors argue that, insofar as modernist design seeks to overcome the contingent perspectives and experiences of human embodiment, it leaves the human body and the human subject homeless. Where the towering structures of the modernist cityscape overpower and disorient the human body, the house speaks to the human body by repeating and referencing the body: "One tell-tale sign remains, in modern Amer- ica, of a world based not on a Cartesian abstraction, but on our sense of ourselves extended beyond the boundaries of our bodies to the world around: that is the single-family house, free-standing like our- selves, with a face and a back, a hearth (like a heart) and a chimney, an attic full of recollections of up, and a basement harboring implica- tions of down.... [It is] the one piece of the world around us which still speaks directly of our bodies as the center and the measure of that world" (Bloomer and Moore 1, 5). But this attempt to discover a building that naturally corresponds with and speaks to the human body assumes in advance both a particular sort of body and a partic- ular type of building. By aligning the form of the American single- family house with the position of a presumably pre-architectural body in the world, the authors attribute an extrahistorical ethical sig- nificance in the detached single-family house. The historical contin- gencies of this design are displaced by reference to what is supposed</page><page sequence="20">204 | SAMIRA KAWASH to be an immutable natural body. And by aligning this supposed immutable natural body with a historically contingent architectural practice, the authors suggest that this particular kind of house, the free-standing single-family house, has some eternal correspondence to human being. A surprising range of twentieth-century thinkers mobilize the image of the single-family house as a metaphor for the modern indi- vidual, producing in the process what might be termed an "archi- tectural psychologism."14 A particularly interesting example of this phenomenon, insofar as it is explicitly concerned with the question of security, is the study Feeling Safe: Making Space for the Self. Feeling Safe presupposes a continuity between security as material security from danger and security as a psychological security of a sense of place. This continuity depends for its coherence on the metaphoric inter- play between house, body, and self that mutually determines each as bounded and enclosed. In Feeling Safe, psychologists Stephen Shapiro and Hilary Rygle- wicz self-consciously mobilize architectural metaphors to describe what it means to be safe. In a section titled "The Safe House of the Self," we discover that the self is a house and that only one person lives there. The normative determination of both self and house is that they are secure: We can think of the self, then, as a special kind of house. It has a secure foundation, unshaken by storms or by invaders. It has protective walls, defining, structuring, and enclosing space for use for the purposes of the self.... It has ample windows to let in the sun and the air, and shut- ters to close out the cold; and it has a big yard, its interface with the world. (21) But we should note that if the self is a "special kind of house," the house that is the metaphor of this self is also of a special kind. In addition to foundation, walls, windows, and a yard, the "safe house" also has a kitchen, a door, guest rooms, a security system, storage rooms, a workroom, a playroom, and a private room. That the self should be best described as a suburban detached single-family house is perhaps not surprising, given the emergence of the suburban ideal as what Robert Fishman has called a "bourgeois utopia" expressing</page><page sequence="21">SAFE HOUSE? I 205 and reflecting the aspirations, values, and self-image of the newly suburbanizing middle class. In a telling inversion, the separation and isolation effected by twentieth-century suburban architecture (and demanded by twentieth-century capitalist modes of production) is transformed from a condition of social dystopia (as portrayed, for example, in Betty Friedan's 1963 indictment of the suburbs in The Feminine Mystique) to the ultimate metaphor for psychological secu- rity. And if the ideal self is like a secure house, it is not difficult to conclude that the ideal self should live in a secure house; the safe self that is derived from the safe house in turn becomes the explanation for the secure architecture of suburban developments that enhances personal safety through protective enclosures and controlled spaces. From the phenomenological perspective articulated in Body, Mem- ory, and Architecture, as much as from the psychological perspective developed in Feeling Safe, it is as if in the development of the subur- ban house architecture arrived at its ultimate truth about what it means to dwell securely in the world. By this logic, the refiguring of the suburban dream house as safe house might be taken to express the teleological aim of an architectural narrative whereby the end of architecture is to secure the human place in the world. And while many architects and theorists explicitly refute such a narrative and emphasize the estranging, dislocating, and displacing possibilities of architecture, the availability of such a narrative aligning a traditional notion of housing with a traditional understanding of the body surely enhances the apparent inevitability and desirability of the contempo- rary reconception of dwelling in terms of safe houses.15 Yet if the rhetoric of security as enclosure relies for its force on traditional notions of the bounded body and the autonomous self, we might note that in the contemporary era these notions are increas- ingly contested, unstable, and often untenable. Perhaps the emer- gence of the safe house is less the expression of some architectural or philosophical inevitability than a symptom of the fragility of the sup- posedly timeless truths of human being and human body that it is assumed to express. For what could it mean, today, to secure the body? As has already been suggested here, the body appears in post- modern culture as dispersed, in circulation, codified, morselated, pix- elated, infomated, cyborgized, such that even to speak of "the body"</page><page sequence="22">206 | SAMIRA KAWASH requires an armada of rhetorical scare quotes. One might conclude that it is precisely because the liberal image of the bounded and enclosed body is increasingly challenged that the safe house and other architectural forms of "forting up" emerge as compensatory forms of enclosure to shore up the image of the bounded self. From this perspective, the danger to which the safe house responds might be interpreted less as the ubiquitous threat of a hostile world than as the threat to the ideas of autonomous self and bounded body that have underwritten for the past two hundred years the metaphoric alignment of interiorized private self and enclosed private house. That is to say, the security of the safe house is not only the superficial securing of one's person and possessions; it is also (and perhaps more importantly) the securing of the very notions of person and posses- sion at the moment those notions begin to collapse.16 If the desirability of security as enclosure embodied in the safe house is predicated on an impossible ideal of bounded bodies and selves, then it is less surprising that the reassurances implicit in the idealized form of the safe house do not seem to be accompanied by any increase in the public perception of security. Quite the contrary, in fact: as daily reports of police brutality attest, security realized as enclosure is inseparable from increasingly deadly practices of sur- veillance, control, and violence. If one follows the popular practice of assuming the identity of security and enclosure, then the accom- panying violence appears to be merely a contingent aberration; better security in the form of better enclosures (fences, prisons, gates, bor- ders, controlled access points) will finally end the violence. For this reason, the problem of security appears most frequently to be techni- cal rather than social or political. It is assumed that when we have built more and better enclosures, we will be more secure. In this con- text, a public debate about security, or a consideration of the ethical question of security and of the potentially noncontingent relation between security and violence, is displaced by the technical question of building. Yet if the boundaries the safe house seeks to secure are not natural or pre-architectural, then the question of building is always already a political and ethical question. And if bodies are always only in relation, then we might come to view the construction of enclosure as itself a form of violence.</page><page sequence="23">SAFE HOUSE? | 207 VIOLENCE AND SECURITY: SAFE (TODD HAYNES, 1995) I want to approach the question of the violence of security by turning to an explicit representation of the safe house, a dwelling that pro- mises the ideal form of security for the self. The safe house is the cen- tral topos of Todd Haynes's 1995 feature film Safe. In the film's title sequence and promotional materials, the title appears in capital let- ters surrounded by a broken box that might be interpreted as [SAFE], graphically emphasizing the ideal of safety while at the same time calling it into question by setting it off in brackets. Like the ambiva- lence of the title's typography, the ambivalence of the house as repre- sented in this film draws us to ask: Is the safe house so safe? Or does the apparent safety of the safe house come at a cost? Generically, Safe is a "disease movie" chronicling the decline of suburban housewife Carol White (Julianne Moore). Yet Safe adds a subtlety to the movie- of-the-week formula; the nature of Carol's sickness, as well as the filmic staging, establish a relation between sick body and sick house, safe body and safe house. Safety, for both body and house, is pursued in the film in strict accordance with the architectural logic of the anthropomorphic analogy, whereby body is like building. Thus, safety depends on the shoring up of the prophylactic enclosure that will iso- late and protect the fragile inside from the contaminating outside. In the past decade, it is around the contagion of AIDS that the questions of the body's permeability and susceptibility to outside contaminants have evoked the most virulent forms of cultural anxi- ety. After all, the term missing from Haynes's title (albeit supplied by the film's opening sequence, which culminates in a spectacularly affectless coupling) is "sex," the term that would complete the film's reference to AIDS. The problem of safe sex is the problem of the pro- phylactic; can the body ever be completely enclosed in such a way as to be impervious to its outside? But while this film might be approached as AIDS allegory, it is significant that in constructing such an allegory, the film shifts the site of contamination and pro- phylaxis from the sexual to the architectural. As Artforum's Collier Schorr remarks, Haynes casts "the heterosexual utopian locale-the suburban home-as a wife-killing entity" (87). Of course, one might note that to the extent that the rhetoric of safe sex treats the body as</page><page sequence="24">208 I SAMIRA KAWASH an enclosure to be sealed off from outside contaminants, the sexual safety of the body is already architectural. Indeed, the homology between body and house is established in its sexual dimension in the very first sequence of Safe, where a shot of a dark car passing through a gate and up a driveway is juxtaposed to the image of Greg White (Xander Berkeley) energetically thrusting himself into Carol's inert body. From this first image of doubled penetrations, the film poses the possibility that the safety of the body is inextricable from the safety of the house. The film plots Carol's search for a safe space, one that will pro- tect her from the attacks of "environmental contaminants" that are making her ill. The trajectory of this search leads her toward more confined and sealed spaces, houses that will provide the protective barrier that her body cannot. But unlike the popular depictions align- ing bodily prophylaxis with health and happiness, no alternative offered by this film appears livable. Architectural safety in the world of Safe is a toxic logic; the more a house promises safety by excluding contaminants, the more ill Carol White becomes. The architectural gesture that is meant to provide safety, the gesture of enclosure, becomes the defining condition of dystopian spaces. The alignment of safe house and safe body in Safe turns, signifi- cantly, on a woman's body. In Western thought, body has long been associated with the feminine, as opposed to the masculine mind. Fur- thermore, the domestic space of the house has been understood as the domain of the feminine, while masculinity is taken to rule in the public space outside. With these gendered orders of meaning in mind, we might consider the manner in which the "suburban house as wife- killing entity" is less an aberration than an intensification of a patri- archal logic that associates masculine power with material possession and spatial control of both properties (houses) and bodies.17 Carol's life at the beginning of the film is wholly circumscribed by her role as executive wife. Her only tasks are to maintain beauty, both of her body and of her house. Her shapely figure and the clean luxury of the house are interchangeable as the badge of her husband's status and success; in effect, the position of wife here names the simultane- ity and convergence of woman's body with house as interchangeable instances of masculine patriarchal possession. Haynes raises the stakes of the patriarchal analogy between house and wife by transforming</page><page sequence="25">SAFE HOUSE? | 209 the house into a character that competes for visual and aural atten- tion on-screen. Far from providing a neutral stage for the domestic drama, this house overwhelms Carol in the first part of the film; were it not for her supervisory role, one might mistake her for a decorative accessory. Carol is barely present, even for the camera. In her living room, at the door of a friend's house, in the friend's kitchen, the cam- era holds back, filming in shots so long that Carol becomes virtually invisible amidst the domestic landscape. Her conversations are like- wise virtually inaudible, competing with the ambient noises of light- ing fixtures or vacuum cleaners. Architecturally, the airy plan of the White house contrasts mark- edly with the enclosed and claustrophobic spaces that defined domesticity in terms of privacy in the nineteenth century. And yet despite the open space, the White house is for Carol no less stifling. In this environment, a "normal" and "healthy" life is characterized by unbearable tedium and absolute repression. The most exciting event in Carol's life is the delivery of a new couch to fill one of the seemingly infinite number of empty rooms. The couch is the occasion for the most intense emotion she is able to muster because to her shock and dismay, it is the wrong color. Such decorative discord might seem a minor irritant. Yet the arrival of the black couch is the event that precipitates Carol's increasingly debilitating illness.18 Of course, the fact that it is a black couch is not accidental; Carol White is pale, colorless, almost transparent, symbolically antithetical to the darkness suggested by the mismatched furnishing. But beyond this obvious chromatic opposition, the appearance of a black couch in Carol White's living room points to the social and geographical subtext of the film. In the scene immediately following the discovery of the black couch, the viewer discovers that the house is not so empty as it appears. In contrast to interior shots of affectless immobility, one brief scene shows that in fact the house is replete with the busy activities of Spanish-speaking laborers performing housekeeping and mainte- nance work. That Carol's leisure rests on the labors of these brown others is not surprising; their visible invisibility marks Carol White's dependence on these non-Whites as well as her disavowal of that relation. Yet despite their necessity to the smooth running of the White house, or perhaps because of it, they pose a threat to the house,</page><page sequence="26">210 | SAMIRA KAWASH just as the black couch threatens the color scheme of the blue room. As Carol sips a glass of milk while housekeepers and handymen continue working in the background, the noise of helicopters comes over the soundtrack, a noise associated in the 1990s with the threat of urban criminality and racial uprising in Los Angeles (Carby 239).19 And while the only appearance of those "dangerous classes" in the film is as domestics and service workers, the underlying fear of inva- sion is never far off. Throughout the first part of Safe, scenes of the house are punc- tuated with reminders of its fortifications: the gated driveway, the patrolling security guards. Indeed, it is these external fortifications that are supposed to insure the security and luxury of the house and garden behind the gate. The night of Carol's first serious attack, her step-son Rory (Chauncey Leopardi) reads from his school report sum- marizing the state of the world beyond the gates of the safe house: In the 80s there are many more gangs in the L.A. basin, plus there are many more stabbings, shootings by AK47s, Uzis, and Mac 10s, killing numerous innocent people. L.A. was the gang capital of America. Riots, shooting innocent people, slashing throats, arms and legs being dis- sected were all common sights in the black ghettos of L.A. Today black and Chicano gangs are coming into the valleys and mostly white areas more and more. That's why gangs in L.A. are a big American issue. This catalog of terrors transforms the urban landscape into a killing field where the militarized violence of gang warfare, the legitimated violence of police control tactics, and the hyperbolic violence of slasher films coalesce around the spectral figure of "black and Chi- cano gangs." In Rory's Hobbesian fantasy, the Los Angeles basin has become the staging ground for a war of "gangs" on "innocent people"; a strategy of withdrawal and defense is the only protection for the "valleys and mostly white areas." This discursive imaginary trans- forms the fortified suburban enclave that marks the White's privilege (or perhaps white privilege) into a legitimate defense against danger. Rory's account promises a path to safety by specifying the dangers of exposure and invasion, in the process rewriting the geography of socioeconomic relations such that the dominated becomes the invader (see Haraway 223).</page><page sequence="27">SAFE HOUSE? I 211 The disparity of position and opportunity on which the White household rests is thus secured by criminalizing and pathologizing those excluded from such privileges. Yet while the violence and insta- bility of this representational reversal may be suppressed from the scene of the film, it reappears deflected onto Carol's body. The vul- nerability of Carol's body, compared to her husband's uncompre- hending imperviousness, suggests the disproportionate burden that falls on women to be the body; yet at the same time, the fragility of Carol's body points more generally to the fallacy of the appearance of social and domestic security. Carol's illness thus might be read as the sign and embodiment of the contradiction around which life in the domestic fortress is constructed: on the one hand, security as exclu- sion of the contamination of social or racial heterogeneity; on the other, the reliance of the freedom promised by such fortified enclaves on the services of those social and racial others. Safe thus displaces the question of the safety of White(ness) with the question of the safety of Carol; in the working-through of the contradictions of bodily safety, one might equally locate an examina- tion of the contradictions of whiteness. By the conclusion of the film, the horrific images of predatory black and Chicano gangs of Los Angeles's urban sprawl have faded into the uninhabited New Mex- ico landscape to which Carol has fled to seek environmental safety. Her flight to safety concludes in the artificially illuminated, desolate, sickly white interior of a hermetically sealed, porcelain-lined igloo built to exclude all environmental contaminants. Nevertheless, one remains mindful of the homology between the image of the body under attack by environmental toxins and the image of the innocent white valley under attack by the invading force of black and Chicano gang violence. Safety as enclosure, whether the suburban fortified enclave of the White household or the porcelain-lined personal space of Carol's igloo, supposes the autonomy and separability of the threat- ened entity (whiteness or body) and what is determined as the dan- gerous contaminant (blackness or environment). In the overlapping narratives of the safety of Carol White and the safety of whiteness, Safe seems to play with the ambivalent relation between the concept of biological immunity and the concept from which it derives, juridico-political immunity. In a genealogical study</page><page sequence="28">212 | SAMIRA KAWASH of the relation between these two independent but intertwined dis- courses, Ed Cohen suggests that just as political immunity "histori- cally denotes an exemption from the very collective obligations that putatively found the sociality of the state" (3), so the idea of biologi- cal immunity incorporates the assumption that "the organism neces- sarily requires some form of 'exemption' from its life context in order to continue to live at all" (4). Cohen argues that such an atomistic view of the organism is consistent with the dominant biomedical belief that "the human body is organically distinct from its social and historical milieu" (8), and therefore that the body maintains an auton- omy and identity separate from any particular environment. Safe takes this atomistic view of the body to an extreme, revealing that the logic of safety as enclosure is not simply to remove the body from contaminated environments, but to remove the body from any environment at all. As one character notes, the porcelain-lined hut is "perfectly safe, as long as no one sets foot inside." Safety then seems to be defined as the total relinquishing of both physical and social relations. This determination of safety would signal an impor- tant continuity between the suburban safe house of the first part of the film and the biomedical safe house of the film's conclusion. The hillside gated suburban house marks the White family's desire to experience social immunity from the dangers and responsibilities of urban Los Angeles just as the porcelain igloo is intended to pro- vide physical immunity from environmental contaminants. Yet, as the final image of Carol's bruised face seems to insist, this enclosure enacts its own kind of violence. The final image of the "safe house" is not a womb-like space of rebirth and new life but rather a deadly tomb. If we focus our attention on the way in which Safe repeatedly positions Carol as powerless and victimized in relation to powerful men and male-dominated institutions, we might read Safe as a relent- less condemnation of a late twentieth-century version of Friedan's "feminine mystique." But while this critique of heterosexual patri- archy is certainly an important element of Safe, I would suggest that the analogy of safe house and safe body explored by the film points (perhaps somewhat less predictably) toward a meditation on security in the ideological context of liberal individualism. Perhaps because it refuses to take up a position outside the world of Carol White, Safe</page><page sequence="29">SAFE HOUSE? I 213 does not attempt to resolve the apparent paradox whereby efforts to establish better security lead only to greater destruction. Rather, Safe pushes to its deadly conclusion the atomizing logic of the individual, whereby the relation of body to environment, or self to other, is fun- damentally opposed and therefore potentially dangerous. The reason- ing is circular: given the distinct self/body, the world is dangerous. Given the danger of the world, the self/body must be secured as dis- tinct. The wall or enclosure is proven necessary because the necessity of the wall or enclosure has been assumed from the start. The failure of the safe house exposed in Haynes's dystopian suburb and repeated in the prophylactic igloo is not a contingent failure that can be ame- liorated by a shoring up of walls and boundaries; rather, it is an in- dictment of the logic that begins from the assumption of the necessity and desirability of enclosure, of separation and distinction. Despite the range of practices and techniques employed to further security, there is finally no possibility for safety in the world of Safe. CONCLUSION: SURVIVING SECURITY Safe focuses its attention on the architectural logic that establishes boundaries of the atomized self, boundaries that deny connection and interrelation. At the same time, as the suppressed racial dramas of both Millennium and Safe suggest, the racial, national, and ethnic divisions that persist as fault lines of social conflict are also reinforced by the architectural logic of security. Security as enclosure works both to secure the liberal self and to secure exclusive and privileged social identities. Significantly, the safe house displaces the urban or public scene of racial or social conflict in both these narratives. This dis- placement suggests that the 1990s domestication of security in the form of the suburban safe house might be seen as a re-vision of less palatable scenes of militarized security that accompany the expan- sion of police powers, the militarization of urban streets and national borders, the criminalization of entire segments of the population, and the general erosion of civil liberties begun in the 1980s. The domesti- cation of security shifts attention from scenes and sources of conflict to the isolationist image of the house immune from and indifferent to whatever storms rage outside.</page><page sequence="30">214 | SAMIRA KAWASH While the domestic enclosure would seem to ensure a place and an identity that might be a basis for subsequent relations, the effect is in fact the opposite. Karsten Harries has argued that architecture has an "ethical function ... to articulate and even to establish man's ethos," his place in the world. Yet if the safe house might be seen as ethos in this sense, we must note that it in fact works to foreclose any possibil- ity of ethical relation by attempting to eliminate every alterity from the site of the self. Security as enclosure makes any ethical relation impossible because it denies in advance the relations of connection and interdependency out of which any subsequent "self" or "body" might arise.20 If the isolation and enclosure effected by the safe house are necessarily violent, it is because such enclosure does violence to the interrelations and interdependencies that characterize both bio- logical environments and human communities. If security is to be sur- vivable, it cannot be a security that denies and attempts to foreclose the interpenetrations of self and environment; rather, it must be a security that begins from the exposure of connection and interrelation. It ought to go without saying that the safe house is not the only way of dwelling in the world. But to the extent that freedom is aligned with security, and the self and body are represented as bounded entities whose security is realized through techniques of enclosure, the safe house will appear as the inevitable and desirable outcome. The contemporary domestication of security can make the violence attendant on security more difficult to perceive or recognize, as security comes to be increasingly incorporated into the metaphoric and material structure of the house. Yet it is at such moments, when violence passes into the realm of the everyday, that we must be most vigilant. As an alternative to the violence of security, it seems impor- tant to imagine and enact new kinds of housings, alternative refigur- ings of the relation between bodies and spaces, that might arise from an understanding of bodies (and persons) as that which neither can nor should be sequestered in safe houses.21 Notes 1. The safe house as I am considering it corresponds to an emergent conception of habitation and dwelling, one that informs a wide range of considerations from in- stitutional design practices to individual purchasing decisions to national legislative</page><page sequence="31">SAFE HOUSE? | 215 initiatives. Yet while I want to use this term as expansively as possible, it is useful to keep in mind the idiomatic resonance of the term in postwar popular culture, in par- ticular the reference to espionage and the safe house where spies are sequestered and debriefed. In spy stories, the safety of the safe house does not rely simply on the bland and undistinguished house being a good hiding place. The safe house becomes safe by virtue of the impenetrability of its exterior, protecting against the penetrating gaze of hostile forces. Thus, spy narratives emphasize debugging, shuttering the windows and doors, ensuring that the house is disconnected from the various circuits of information and exchange that would give away the true nature of its interior. But where the safe house would thus seem to be the most extreme manifestation of the logic of separation and enclosure that sustains the oppositions between inside and outside and between private and public, the operations characteristic of the spy safe house work to blur these separations. It is inside the safe house that political fates are revealed and shaped. And if the spy's true identity must remain secret, it is inside the safe house that such secret identities are unmasked. Thus, while the safe house appears as an impene- trable secret interior, it also functions as a space more public and less secret than the outside world of secret operations. Yet it is perhaps too much to say, as Michael Den- ning has argued, that the split or contradiction between public and private is resolved in the safe house (134), for all in the safe house is not always as it initially appears; the narrative twists engendered by double agents and triple crosses set in motion wild gyrations in the relation between secrecy and publicity. Indeed, it could be said more generally that the generic condition for spy narrative as a never-ending cycle of deceit and duplicity is the inherent instability of the boundaries that would separate inside from outside, good guys from bad guys, our side from their side. 2. In disputing the relation between enclosure and security, my argument owes much to the pathbreaking critiques of modernist urbanism by such visionaries as Jane Jacobs and Oscar Newman who insisted that in the urban context practices of enclo- sure and separation destroyed relations of communal responsibility and monitoring, thereby creating fertile conditions for urban criminality and danger. Charles Jencks's 1990s-style revisionist reading of Newman's "defensible spaces" is, however, instruc- tive in indicating the more predominant contemporary understanding of the relation between security and enclosure: "Instead of the abstract green and open space of Le Corbusier and the housing estate, [Newman] proposed a more privatized architecture of walls, 'keep out' signs, security cameras, security men, and private property" (218). 3. Significant contributions to this scholarship include Hayden; Weisman; Wek- erle, Peterson, and Morley; Stimpson et al.; Jones, Nash, and Roberts; Colomina 1992b. 4. Hayden 18; see also Kozol for an analysis of the role of the media in the ide- alization of the dream house and the private nuclear family. 5. On the house as stage for the performance of gender, see also Colomina's analysis of Adolf Loos's domestic architecture of the 1920s as the construction of "the- ater boxes" (1992a, 74-93) and Lynn Spigel's interpretation of cultural representations of the suburbs in the 1950s in relation to the dominant metaphor of "domestic theater" (217-24). 6. For example, Peter Calthorpe's proposals for "pedestrian pockets" and Andres</page><page sequence="32">216 | SAMIRA KAWASH Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk's designs for the planned development of Seaside, Florida, seek to establish stronger feelings of community in residents by integrating various land uses and housing types and by emphasizing interactions in public places; these have received substantial attention and have been touchstones in reviving inter- est in restoring a (perhaps nostalgically conceived) sense of small town America. But while these proposals are innovative in their explicit rejection of both modernist princi- ples of urban design and the suburban tendency toward low-density development, their popularity is perhaps proportional to the extent to which they leave intact what Karen Franck calls "the opportunity to live in a free-standing house inhabited by a single household ... [thereby] preserving this aspect of the American dream" (Franck 243). 7. This tendency is examined in more detail in Davis; Guterson; Dillon; Judd. 8. The privatization and enclosure of public spaces is analyzed in Boddy; Judd; Zukin; on the global dimensions of the tendency toward urban fortification see Franco; Caldiera. 9. It would perhaps belabor the point to refer to Freud's analysis of the heimlich and unheimlich here, but one might profitably notice the literalization of "homelyness" and "unhomelyness" in the figure of the built house. Anthony Vidler has written extensively on the relation between architecture and the uncanny. 10. Sidney Blumenthal, "The Education of a President," New Yorker, 24 January 1994, 41, quoted in Dumm, 133; emphasis in original. 11. This relation is inverted in postmodernist architectural theory: for the latter, architecture's redemptive (perhaps antiredemptive) practice involves de-centering the subject and rendering or exposing place and meaning as ambiguous. The continuity between phenomenolgoical placing and postmodernist displacing of the subject might be grasped in the relation between the architectural construction of home (heimlich) and what Anthony Vidler has called the "architectural uncanny" (unheimlich) (17-44). 12. This conjoining of security, housing, and the fall into sin (or culture) is of course not unique to architectural theory. For example, as Michael McKeon has sug- gested to me, versions of this connection between housing and the fallen world-hous- ing as both security and compensation-are essential elements of the English pastoral tradition (personal communication). The connection between pastoral and housing- in particular, the detached single-family home-is complex; the ideal of country living as an escape from the pressures of urban life was given aesthetic warrant and expres- sion in pastoral literature, and, in turn, what eventually emerged as twentieth-century suburban architecture (the ranch-style home surrounded by a lawn and garden) echoes in spirit the pastoral ideal of the country house. 13. The notion of the body as first possession from which all other forms of pos- session arise is developed by John Locke in The Second Treatise of Government (1689): "Though the earth and all inferior creatures be common to all men, yet every man has a property in his own person. This nobody has any right to but himself. The labor of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever, then, he removes out of the state that nature hath provided and left it in, he hath mixed his labor with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property" (chapter 5, section 27).</page><page sequence="33">SAFE HOUSE? I 217 14. The term "architectural psychologism" might describe the approach of Mar- cus; Marc; Dovey; see also Despres for a survey of related work. 15. For example, the deconstructive architecture of Peter Eisenman or Bernard Tschumi, or the more recent "post-human" architecture enabled by computer-assisted design and exemplified by Frank Gehry's Bilbao Guggenheim explictly refuse the notion that architecture's function is to create or refer to a human place in the world. Yet one cannot fail to notice that the influence of this work seems confined to class- rooms and academic journal pages; on the other hand, the New Urbanism of Seaside or Celebration, an architecture that avows a particular kind of humanism, appears (perhaps not surprisingly) to have a more widespread popular appeal. 16. One might contrast the traditional liberal notions of property, person, body, and possession suggested by the image of the home security system with the complete failure of these conceptions to make any sense of new forms of property and body, as for example in current debates about who owns DNA codes or questions of intellectual property in electronic environments. 17. In a reading of classic architectural texts, most significantly Leon Battista Alberti's De Re Aedificatoria (1452), Mark Wigley suggests we might view architecture as complicit in the exercise of patriarchal authority through the confining and contain- ing of women's bodies, and in particular their sexuality, in the house. Wigley argues that within the patriarchal perspective developed in these classic texts, "Marriage is the reason for building a house.... While the house protects the children from the ele- ments, its primary role is to protect the father's genealogical claims by isolating women from other men. Reproduction is understood as reproduction of the father. The law of the house is undoubtedly no more than the law of the father. The physical house is the possibility of the patriarchal order that appears to be applied to it" (1992, 336). 18. Finding no explanation or help from the traditional medical establishment, Carol comes to believe that she suffers from environmental illness. El (or in increasingly preferred nomenclature, multiple chemical sensitivity [MCS]) is not a medically diag- nosable disease but rather a nonspecific syndrome of symptoms. EI/MCS sufferers typ- ically attribute these symptoms to industrial and technological contaminants, chemicals, and fumes that have rendered the contemporary environment toxic for certain sensitized individuals. It is believed that EI/MCS is triggered by contact with an extremely toxic agent or environment. In the context of Safe as disease narrative, the black couch thus serves explicitly as such a toxic trigger. My thinking on the relations between safety and the house in relation to environmental illness has benefited from Lisa Lynch's unpublished work on activism and community formation around emergent illnesses. 19. Insofar as Safe is set in 1987, the sound of helicopters might also evoke the aerial spraying of the insecticide malathion in the Los Angeles area, resumed in 1987 after a five-year hiatus. Malathion spray is used to kill the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), an agricultural pest believed to imperil California's commercial agricultural industry. Thanks to Carol Bork for pointing out to me the resonances of the brown invading bodies of the Mediterranean fruit flies and the attendant airborne toxicity of malathion spray as echoed in the toxicity of Carol White's house and the porousness of the White household to invading brown others (personal communication).</page><page sequence="34">218 | SAMIRA KAWASH 20. The claim that the ethical relation precedes the "I," a claim that amounts to a critique of the traditional sovereign subject of metaphysics in the name of a prior and irreducible communality, is developed most extensively by Emmanuel Levinas in his account of the "face to face" relation in Totality and Infinity, and by Jean-Luc Nancy in "The Inoperative Community," where he writes: "Community means, consequently, that there is no singular being without another singular being, and that there is, there- fore, what might be called, in a rather inappropriate idiom, an originary or ontological 'sociality"' (28). Nancy in particular emphasizes the violence of separation and the necessity of exposure in community/communication. 21. As a theoretical exercise, Arakawa and Madeline Gins's ongoing Reversible Destiny architecture project is one notable effort to rethink the relation between body and house in a way that eschews the assumption of security (Kawash 1998a).
