<plain_text><page sequence="1">Saadya Studies. In commemoration of the one-thousandth anniversary of the death of R. Saadya Gaon. Edited by Erwin I. J. Rosenthal. Pp. xi + 283. Manchester : University Press, 1943. 25s. The fourteen essays which make up this ι ,oooth-anniversary volume serve to illustrate in some degree the many-sided labours of Rabbi Saadya Gaon (882-942) as theologian, anti-Karaite controversialist, Biblical exegete, and Hebrew philologist. Four essays are devoted to Saadya's work in religious philosophy and Jewish theology. Rabbi Alexander Altmann discusses the terms Kabhodh nibhrd and Dibbur nibhrâ, 'created glory' and 'created speech' (the terms used by Saadya to propound his theory of revela tion), and argues that these are not, as generally supposed, terms borrowed from Mu'tazilite (heretical Moslem) teaching, but are in unsullied line with Jewish thought and derivable, respectively, from rabbinic mystical ideas and the doctrine of the Memrâ. Dr. A. Mar morstein also stresses the rabbinic strain of thought in Saadya's treatment of Israel's redemption and restoration, the subject of the eighth book of Saadya's main philosophical work, the Emunoth w'Deoth. The late Dr. Eugen Mittwoch deals with a Hebrew-Arabic fragment from the Geniza (Elkan Adler Collection, 2715), which he proves to be part of a variant version of the ninth book of the Kitâb al-Amânât (the Arabic orginal of the Emunoth to'Deoth) on the subject of Reward and Punishment. Under the title ' Saadya's purification of the idea of God', Dr. Simon Rawidowicz shows how Saadya, 'the pioneer in many a field of Jewish learning, has also to his credit the first philosophical and systematic efforts in anti-anthropomorphism'. Saadya's work on the Bible provides the subject for six of the contributors. The most substantial is that from the Editor, Dr. Rosen thal, who takes Saadya's translation and exegesis of the Book of Job and demonstrates his methods, his theological preoccupations, and</page><page sequence="2">122 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES his relationship with the Targum and other versions. Mr. Jacob Leveen, of the British Museum, reproduces a Karaite Hebrew-Arabic text (MS. B.M. Or. 2494) containing portions from Saadya's lost commentary on Leviticus. Rabbi P. R. Weis brings together many renderings from Saadya's Arabic Pentateuch where a paraphrase takes the place of a literal rendering in order to reinforce some anti-Karaite point in dispute. The authorship of the Samaritan Arabic Pentateuch and its dependence upon Saadya's Arabic version are discussed by Professor Robertson; and Dr. Isaac Markon deals with the term mor-d'ror (Exod. xxx. 23, R.V. 'flowing myrrh') and its rendering by Saadya and later commentators. Dr. Samuel Krauss, after com menting on defects in Saadya's ' Explanation of the 70 (or 90) hapax legomena ' in the Hebrew Bible, and approving Saadya's principle that Biblical Hebrew terms are susceptible to explanation by Mishnaiç usage, proceeds to give more than 200 rarer Biblical words whose sense, in his belief, can be established or confirmed by Tannaitic usage. Of the remaining four essays, one, by Dr. Rabin, analyses Saadya's Hebrew prose style and shows the degree of influence exercised on it by Biblical, Mishnaic, and Arabic use and idiom; and another, by Dr. Wieder, describes several manuscript fragments which can be used to close up gaps in the recently published edition of Saadya's Siddur. Professor David Herzog reopens the dispute as to whether Dunash ben Labrat, author of an attack on the grammarian Menahem ben Saruk, is to be identified with the author of a tract attacking many of Saadya's renderings. The interest of the dispute lies in the fact that this latter tract shows acquaintance with the triliteral nature of Hebrew roots, from which it follows either that its author was later than Hayyuj, the reputed discoverer of the triliteral system (and so a hundred years later than Dunash ben Labrat's attack on Menahem ben Saruk), or that the discovery of the triliteral system belongs to a century earlier than Hayyuj. Professor Herzog brings arguments to show that the authors of the two polemical tracts could not have been identical, and so he preserves for Hayyuj his claim to priority. In the remaining essay Dr. Siegfried Stein edits the text, and ventures an English rendering, of the curious medieval 'poem' which was concocted as an elaborate mnemonic recording the number of times each letter of the alphabet occurs in the Hebrew Bible. Dr. Stein numbers himself among those who accept the poem's Saadyanic authorship. It is not without interest to observe that in a volume which, as the Editor points out, is the homage to Saadya of Anglo-Jewish scholar ship, no less than ten of the contributors are refugees from Germany.
