<plain_text><page sequence="1">Grossing Lines: Jacques Derrida and Hélène Cixous on the Phone1 Eric Prenowitz [H]e must turn his own unconscious like a receptive organ towards the transmitting unconscious of the patient. He must adjust himself to the patient as a telephone receiver is adjusted to the transmitting microphone. - Freud, "Recommendations to Physicians Practicing Psychoanalysis"2 My unconscious is connected to your unconscious. - Cixous, "La venue à l'écriture"3 Jacques Derrida seems to have thought a lot of Hélène Cixous 's tele- phone. He will have spoken a great deal about it by all accounts, and it might be said to have occupied and preoccupied him without ever becoming a purely theoretical object of reflection. One gets the feel- ing Derrida spent a lifetime thinking and speaking on Hélène Cixous 's telephone, which is to say in it, into it and out of it, through it as well as of it, and even into it of it, all at once. It is hard to imag- ine how he could have done otherwise. Discourse , 30.1 Sc 2, Winter Sc Spring 2008, pp. 123-156. Copyright © 2009 Wayne State University Press, Detroit, Michigan 48201-1309.

Infinitely more."4 According to the most restricted context in which the comment appears, this "we" or "us," the pronoun "nous," alone or in the reflexive, nominative-subjective formula " nous nous" "we to ourselves" or "we to each other," refers to a general, relatively undefined group: Derrida and his audience ("I am sure that a certain number of us can say this: we have talked to each other more on the telephone"5). For a reading that is informed by the broader context of the essay, however, it is clear that this "we" or this "us" also refers, if only by inference, to Jacques Der- rida and Hélène Cixous. Derrida goes on to suggest to his readers, whom he thereby con- stitutes as prospective doctoral students, "the program or the tide of ten or twenty theses to come in the university, tomorrow, when it will have to canonize H.C.'s corpus. Subject: telephones and the ques- tion of the telephone in H.C.'s work."6 Leaving this compelling call unanswered for the time being, I propose to address here a not unrelated ring or buzz, a telephonic conversation or dialogue, and a persistent hang-up. A telephone calling, if I can put it that way, shared in duplex, in the duplex sense of the word, by Jacques Der- rida and Hélène Cixous. One of my hypotheses, which I attempt to justify in tracing out a certain number of exchanges, is indeed that these two big talkers talk to each other, about each other, that they phone each other, literally , more than it might at first appear. How- ever, I hope to make clear that I do not say this in view of a realist, biographical, anecdotal reduction of what is one of the most extraor- dinary literary-philosophical exchanges - an exchange that obliges us to rethink what we mean by "literature," "philosophy," and "exchange" - to a simple communication between two living peo- ple in their lives, as distinct or even as in principle distinguishable from their works. On the contrary, this exchange takes place in the work, through the work, in the working through of the work, but in such a way that it subverts the conventional border between life and work. My telephonic hypothesis is in part a consequence of this sub- version: if works are «¿solives, if lives can never be entirely extricated from works, if people are also the constructs of texts, and all the more so with the lives and works at issue here, then it is not only a question of justification but of critical literary urgency to also give the people and the lives their due. Something of Derrida 's peculiar interest in the telephone and, if you take my word for it, in Cixous 's telephone, is suggested, in</page><page sequence="3">Crossing Lines 1 25 any event, by the last two words of the citation above, forming a deceptively colloquial comparative, "Infinitely more." Standing alone, this comparative draws attention to itself as it repeats the comparison made in the preceding sentence, intensifying it. In the balance are two types of speech, two modes or species of speech, but also two technologies, two vehicles, two ways of proffering the same speech. Because this comparative can imply either that we spend more time speaking, that we exchange more words on the telephone than face to face, or that our speaking on the telephone speaks more, says more, that it is more telling or communicative even if we pronounce fewer words than in person. Derrida had just outlined such an impossible, undecidable computational conun- drum: If a statistic were conceivable or appropriate, dream or reality, on this sub- ject, I do not know what comparative archive it would produce regarding the respective number of words pronounced, words that all of us here have addressed to each other. Without being capable of such a calculation, I am sure that a certain number of us can say this: we have talked to each other more on the telephone.7 The endlessness of this "infinitely" ( infiniment plus) , like an inter- minable analysis, suggests something about an absence, on the tele- phone, of ends, of limits and borders. As if Derrida were saying that there is, in some sense, no limit to what we say on the telephone: we may say the same things, but we talk infinitely more. As if the tele- phone, this putative (though not necessarily computable) line of communication, erased or suspended the lines of demarcation that otherwise obtain between you and me, when we talk. At the risk of making it say infinitely more than it wants to, we can always read this little line ("Infinitely more") as suggesting an economic difference along the lines of those Derrida often empha- sizes between poetry and prose,8 or between the untranslatable and the translatable.9 A difference in idiomatic economy, insofar as there is more, infinitely more, in an untranslatable idiomatic expression than in any possible translation - even a translation that uses more ink, potentially an endless or an infinite amount of ink, to say the "same" thing. The telephone is poetry, Derrida implies, to the trans- parent prosaic meaning-content of the face-to-face.10 But this particular adverbial phrase, " infiniment plus," says even more, indeed. It is a common expression, but one whose gloss can easily get out of hand, signifying "much more" and more precisely "incalculably more," "incommensurably more." Infinitely more. So much more that we can no longer measure the difference. There is</page><page sequence="4">126 Eric Prenowitz no way of comparing, this comparative paradoxically suggests, no way of measuring, of distinguishing quantitatively, no possible trans- lation, between what happens on the telephone and what happens in person, in the flesh, between two faces or heads, " tête à tête , face à face." "Infinitely more" is thus an oxymoron, so to speak, an incom- parable comparative. The incalculable telephonic difference Derrida alludes to here would therefore be so extreme that it would no longer really qualify as difference. Because difference, by definition, must be measura- ble; the concept of difference is predicated on measurement as a finite operation of comparison. So an "infinite" difference, an infi- nite addition ("infinitely more"), ought to be perfectly impossible. Unless, on the contrary, according to a second definition of differ- ence, one were to take the "infinitely more" to be something like the very principle of difference: there is no difference worthy of this name that is not infinite difference, infinite excess (infinitely more) with regard to all the inexorable dialectics of reappropriation of the same. It is certainly in the direction of something on the order of this irrecoverable, unrecoupable, incommensurable difference beyond difference that Derrida points us when talking up Hélène Cixous 's telephone - or down it. Let me set aside for now this tentative hypothesis in the form of a risky interpretation of what is to all appearances a throwaway line in a long passage, really a sort of returning Derridean obsession, about Hélène Cixous's telephone. It will return, in another voice, very shortly. I. Who Talks - au Téléphone Derrida talks almost incessantly, as I keep saying, about Cixous's tele- phone - and even when he insists, in a comment from "Fourmis," his first sustained reading of Cixous's work, that "when the two of us speak, especially on the telephone, it is Hélène who speaks all the time, more or less."1 1 In an essay on how - and what - H.C. and J.D. call each other, Anne Berger proposes a brilliant reading of this apparently innocent comment.12 Berger detects a certain " Téléphone- moi , je ťen pri£"n (Call me please!) in Derrida's account of his tele- phonic relations with Cixous, which suffices to destabilize the relations of precedence. What is more, this line about talking "all the time" is an auto-hetero-citation and a kind of invoke: it comes from a passage in a book by Cixous (Jours de l'an) in which the narrator is talking about a strange encounter between two characters in another book (Onegin and Tatiana in Pushkin's Eugene Onegin) dur-</page><page sequence="5">Crossing Lines 127 ing which one of the characters, in this case the man (Onegin) , talks "all the time."14 The joke, if it is a joke, is that Derrida thus reverses the sex or gender roles: with regard to the interlocutory scene, Der- rida is in the position of the woman (Tatiana) and Cixous in that of the man (Onegin).15 Furthermore, Cixous might be said to contra- dict Derrida's suggestion that it is she who calls, or in any case to tes- tify, virtually, to a counterexample in the passage I will turn to momentarily from one of her short texts: "You call me," she writes, "I listen to you."16 The nature, the value or the efficacy of this testi- mony depends, as is the case for any testimony, on one's interpreta- tion of the passage in question. Because, while its immediate context suggests that this "you" is an abstract, unqualified second person, a somewhat broader reading leaves open the possibility that it refers also, though undecidably, to Derrida. It is no coincidence that the undecidability of this reference mirrors that of Derrida's "we" or "us," the "nons nous I mentioned a moment ago. But what could it mean anyway to speak "all the time" on the telephone? Not to spend all one's time on the telephone, but to be the only one who speaks when one is on the phone? That is, when two are on the phone. Do there not have to be two, at least two, on the phone? Does the telephone not demand some conference, some converse or confabulation? Such interrogations might strike our ears as a recurrent deconstructive strain. At the very least, they seem to echo, from a distance, something stirring at the heart of Derrida's early work on phenomenology. In a chapter in Speech and Phenomena called "The Voice that Keeps Silent," for instance, Der- rida describes what is in effect the Husserlian phone call, a rather lonely affair that Derrida nicknames, in French, s'entendre parler, "hearing-oneself-speak." For Husserl, according to Derrida, there is, in the voice, an "absolute proximity of the signifier to the signi- fied."17 As a result, the signifier becomes "perfecdy diaphanous,"18 such that the voice has the unique privilege of being "produced in the world as pure auto-affection."19 It is thus "the sole case to escape the distinction between what is worldly and what is transcenden- tal."20 In effect, "[e]very other form of auto-affection must either pass through what is outside the sphere of 'ownness' or forego any claim to universality."21 As "pure auto-affection," the voice would occur "in the world," but only in "a self-proximity that would in fact be the absolute reduction of space in general. It is this purity that makes it fit for universality."22 This transcendentality or universality is that of a universal signification, the apparent condition for any- thing like interlocution or intersubjective communication: a com- munication of signifiers as "idealities that are idealiter indefinitely repeatable or transmissible as the same."23</page><page sequence="6">128 Eric Prenowitz In a moment we will hear Derrida speaking, more than thirty years later, of something strangely reminiscent of this phenomeno- logical "reduction of space in general": a certain Cixousian "genius of the telephone" that is enough to "annul distance."24 Indeed, thanks to this radical reduction that takes place as soon as we open our mouths, Husserl's model, again in Derrida's gloss, of a dialogue, of an interpersonal linguistic exchange, seems, at least, to come down on the side of the telephone call rather than the face-to-face conversation ("we have talked to each other more on the telephone than, as one says, tête-à-tête, face to face"). Because insofar as the telephone transmits the voice alone, it too effects a certain reduc- tion of exteriority - of physical space and the visible, material body. Here is Derrida's account of Husserl's telephone line: To speak to someone is doubtless to hear oneself speak, to be heard by oneself; but, at the same time, if one is heard by another, to speak is to make him ref&gt;eat immediately m himself the hearing-oneself-speak in the very form in which I effectuated it.25 This Husserlian parley does ring a bell. It does sound like what hap- pens when the telephone receiver repeats , immediately , or as close to immediately as the speed of light will permit, exactly what is said at the other end. While taking no account of anything else. And yet, on this phenomenological telephone, there is no communication, no addressing, no affecting , no hetero-affection, no hope held out that something might come, perchance, to you from me. All that occurs is an eerily mechanical repetition of the same solipsistic auto-affective routine, each (inter) locutor imprisoned within his or her own phe- nomenological reduction of the world. Derrida makes short work of untying Husserl's tightly set knot, notably by deconstructing the opposition, necessary for the phe- nomenological reduction, between space and time: As soon as we admit spacing both as "interval" or difference and as open- ness upon the outside, there can no longer be any absolute inside, for the "outside" has insinuated itself into the movement by which the inside of the nonspatial, which is called "time," appears, is constituted, is "pre- sented." Space is "in" time If we recall now that the pure inwardness of phonic auto-affection supposed the purely temporal nature of the "expres- sive" process, we see that the theme of a pure inwardness of speech, or of the "hearing oneself speak," is radically contradicted by "time" itself. The going-forth "into the world" is also primordially implied in the movement of temporalization. . . . Hearing oneself speak is not the inwardness of an inside that is closed in upon itself; it is the irreducible openness in the inside; it is the eye and the world within speech.26</page><page sequence="7">Crvssing Lines 1 29 Derrida thus saves us from the windowless and telephoneless rigors of Husserl's isolationist reduction. If it is indeed the case that one cannot speak, one cannot speak to someone, without hearing-one- self-speak, this does not necessarily imply that one can only hear one- self speak. In other words, that one can only hear the other speak in the form of hearing-oneself-speak. The "irreducible openness in the inside" that Derrida locates in what would otherwise be a hopelessly self-sufficient speaking retreat means that one can never entirely appropriate the other's words - or one's own, for that matter. But this is perhaps the necessary, if not necessarily the sufficient, condi- tion of ever being affected by them. We always speak to ourselves when we speak to each other, but we may also speak to each other even as we speak to ourselves. Such a deconstruction of the phe- nomenological reduction is suggested by the reflexive expression we encountered a moment ago, nous nous sommes parlé (as in "nous nous sommes plus parlé au téléphone"), in which the same indistin- guishable second-person personal pronoun is reduplicated repeti- tively, nous nous, such that the nominative and objective cases ("we have spoken to ourselves" and "we have spoken to each other"), are confused like a rapid stutter.27 Further on in H. C. for Life, while reading another passage in Hélène Cixous's Jours de Van, Derrida says, about the author and/or the narrator,28 "Elle parle au téléphone,"** which generally means "She talks on the telephone" or "She is talking on the telephone." How- ever, Derrida immediately goes on to say that this is not what he means. He uses the same words {"elle parle ... au téléphone") to say something very different: she speaks not on but to the telephone. But she does not talk on the telephone as one says parler au téléphone. No, she really talks to the telephone [au téléphone ], she talks in its direction [à son adresse] t she addresses it and says to it "O telephone . . Л 30 At the risk of belaboring what is in effect a redundant point about redundancy and/as translation, let me repeat that in this cita- tion I have translated the same expression, au téléphone (from the formula elle parle au téléphone) in two different ways: once as "on the telephone," and once as "to the telephone." The French au téléphone is more economical in expressing these two different meanings at once. And so, precisely because of this idiomatic economy, Derrida effectively translates parler au téléphone into French, disentangling its two meanings. Yet this intralinguistic translation is in turn less eco- nomical than an English translation, because the latter would have to assign each of the two meanings to a distinct signifier. It is,</page><page sequence="8">130 Eric Prenowitz however, a rather economical way of bringing to our attention pre- cisely this question of idiomatic economy. Through which Derrida makes a broader - and wordier - point about language and trans- lation and meaning, but also, as we'll see, about the who and the what, in particular as they pan out, here, between an interlocutor and the "means of communication." Derrida's foregrounding here of the untranslatable knot tied in the French phrase parieran téléphone serves as a good example of the way he lets idiomatic expressions think for him. He takes absolutely seriously the fact that this phrase means both "to talk on the tele- phone" and "to talk to the telephone," and he allows it to say some- thing, to speak through him to Hélène Cixous's text. As if this were a telephone call. As if "he" were the telephone or the telephone line, and as if it were language, the French idiom here, that were talking or thinking when he talks or thinks. I might add that " О téléphoné' is a near homophone of au téléphone. After Derrida 's insistence on the two meanings of the latter phrase, one can only hear the same play in the direct address: in the very same breath in which Cixous's nar- rator talks directly to the telephone, and indeed embarks on a dia- logue with the telephone, her vocative exclamation also seems to say, between the who and the what, "on the telephone."31 A similar situation occurs in a different text by Hélène Cixous, "Writ- ing Blind." It recalls what transpires in another text by Derrida, which I'll quote in a moment, when he is interrupted in his office by an unsolicited phone call. In "Writing Blind," the telephone rings and interrupts the writer in the process of writing. "Now the tele- phone rings. And it's you. ... I was in the process of writing: But the telephone rings. And I wrote: and it's you. (I mean the telephone itself.)"32 In this sequence there is a telephonic interruption of the writing; the telephone and the writing are posited as antagonistic forces: it is one or the other. And yet, in the writing, this antagonism is subverted, perhaps sublated: the inside of the writing opens itself to the intruding interruption in an undecidable gesture that is both an appropriation of and a capitulation to its other. In a similar way, there is no opposition between the telephone "itself' [le téléphone même ] and the caller, the what and the who. The writing writer receives both calls in the call, just as she does "within" her writing (but of course this is her writing, that is the point), where the work of the signifier has no less autonomy, no less a claim to the writing , than does the conceptual system, the logic or the thematics of the written discourse.</page><page sequence="9">Crvssing Lines 1 31 П. Jet Theory A number of similar telephonic questions are raised near the begin- ning of Hélène Cixous's "Nous en somme."33 Questions about the telephone as technological supplement, and about the third party breaking into the most intimate dialogue - but as its condition of possibility - between two interlocutors. Between the person and the means of communication, as between the signifier and the signified; between literature and philosophy no doubt: an interstitial being coming into being as its own opening, and between who and what. Here, then, is a paragraph from the first page of "Nous en somme." It is followed by a necessarily poor attempt at a word-for- word translation:34 - Tu me téléphones. Je ťécoute. Je dis « tu »,« ť » mais plus exactement c'est ta voix, ta voix pour toi, ton envoyée, ta métonymie miraculeuse. Je dis «je ťécoute ». Mais c'est ta voix que j'écoute. Je parle avec toi dans ta voix, est-ce une chose est-ce un corps est-ce un nombre, une ombre, un être, un multiple. Qui me dit que ce n'est pas un animal peut-être ? C'est t'. Je t'. Voici que se forme un être un peu siamois, aussi à moi qu'à toi, un peu césuré, ajointé aéré. C'est je t'. Cet être est mouvement vers, tension, attention. Dasein, dirait Heidegger, comme ouverture à l'être. Je t'.35 [ - You call me. I listen to you. I say "you," "y-," but more exactly it is your voice, your voice for you, your envoy, your miraculous metonymy. I say "I listen to you." But it's your voice that I listen to. I speak with you in your voice, is it a thing is it a body is it a number, a shadow, a being, a multiple. Who knows if it's not an animal perhaps? It is y-. I y-. Thus is formed a being that is a bit Siamese, as much mine as yours, somewhat caesuraed, joined- up spaced apart. It is I y-. This being is movement toward, tension, atten- tion. Dasein, Heidegger would say, as opening to being. I y-.] Je is the first-person singular nominative pronoun, and ¿'the elided form (as it always is before a vowel or a mute h) of the second- person singular pronoun, te, here the direct object. Similarly, tu is the second-person singular nominative pronoun, and me the first- person singular pronoun as indirect object. These forms of the objective pronoun only come before the verb, which can lead to such juxtapositions of the subject and the object: tu me and je te. But in the first part of the paragraph, before suddenly noticing the "Siamese" being "Je ť" the speaker turns her attention to the second person, whether subject or object, tu or t' At first, the speaker (whose sex or gender we never discover, but to whom I will refer in the feminine as a not altogether neutral convenience) distinguishes between "you" {tuor t ) and "your voice." She cites herself ("I listen to you. ... I say 'I listen to you.'"), repeating the sentence in order</page><page sequence="10">132 Eric Prenowitz to critique it: the object is not, or should not be, "you&gt; but rather "your voice" ("I say 'you,' 'y-,' but more exactly it is your voice") . It is not "you" (toi), but "your voice" that she listens to. This is a phe- nomenological truth that is only accentuated by the intervention of the telephone: I never hear or listen to you as such; I can only listen to what I can hear, in this case a voice. However, a few lines further on, this "voice," which has undergone a vertiginous series of hypo- thetical metamorphoses in the interval (thing, body, number, shadow, being, multiple, animal), comes full circle, to be described anew as "ť": "It is y-" (C'est t). But by this time, ťis no longer what it once was. It has shed its nominative partner tu and maintained its elliptical apostrophe, retaining a lack that gives it a strange syntactic status: it stands alone as something that cannot stand alone. As "your voice" is to "you," so, apparendy, is "ť" to "te." It is no longer simply the direct object, nor simply a partial object,36 but also a grammatical-narrative entity in its own (paradoxical) right. In other words, the text offers, through this pseudoconcept/pseudosignifier, ť, a performative deconstruction of what is blithely called the inter- subjective relation. It is then joined by the first person, I (je), as the speaker again repeats the first part of the sentence she seems unable to let go, "I listen to you" or "I am listening to you,"/&lt;? ťécoute. The combination "je ť" which I simply transposed above as "I y-," corresponds more accurately to "I . . . to you" in "I listen to you." However, this word- and-a-half quickly acquires the status of a substantive: "jeť" is, it is a "being," the narrator says. And not just any being. This all happens very quickly, telephonically, with no formal introduction, no prolegomena to any future phone call, as if at the touch of a few buttons. Without the frame of a prolix philosophical discourse, the connection is made and suddenly there is Heidegger, right there, da, you can practically hear him, talking with his Dasein^-or through it, like a ventriloquist. At the same time there is something quite exotic about this walk- on appearance of the philosopher's philosopher and master pup- peteer with his un/translated neologism on the tip of his tongue. Why should Heidegger suddenly be talking, in German, during this most intimate of phone calls? What lines have been crossed? Heidegger is of course the philosopher of the call - of the Gewis- sensruf, the "call of conscience." Indeed, according to Avi tal Ronell in her incommensurate Telephone Book, Heidegger's Gewissensruf pos- sesses "the character of a telephone call."37 It should be recalled that Heidegger once placed an impromptu call to Derrida, who screened it and put it straight through to his text. Here is how Derrida relates</page><page sequence="11">Crossing Lines 1 33 the famous incident, in The Post Card : "[T]his very morning, August 22, 1979, around 10:00 a.m., as I am typing this page in view of the present publication, the telephone rings. The United States. The American operator asks me if I will accept a 'collect call' . . . from Martin (she says Martine or martini) Heidegger."38 Derrida refuses the call. But reinscribes it as a footnote to the text. While, according to Ronell, this gesture leaves "unfulfilled the idle curiosity concern- ing his intimacy with Heidegger. . . , Derrida, still, has given every- thing away. He has disclosed that his relationship is structured telephonically, according to an altogether different exchange but nonetheless an irreducibly telephonic exchange, a 4 standard } (switchboard) posing some sort of unique person-to-person . . . cir- cuit."39 All of these telephone links are therefore called up by this unexpected Heideggerian intervention in Cixous's text. No doubt this interruption produces, furthermore, a strong chiaroscuro effect between modes or moods or genres: the infor- mal, intimate, personal, nearly anecdotal banality of the paragraph's opening line, "You call me. I listen to you," and the technical invo- cation of the great destroyer of Western metaphysics, who suddenly takes to the airwaves with an erudite philosophical reference as the paragraph ends.40 It serves to illustrate, almost to the point of par- ody, one of the signature traits of Cixous's writing, a propensity for moving effortlessly between levels of discourse, often without even moving, for harnessing or unleashing unheard-of (and often unheard) multifarious disseminatory textual effects. Certainly Cixous does not need Heidegger here to give this pas- sage seriousness or philosophical kudos. For instance, her " être siamois ," which we might translate as "Siamese-being," can be read as a proper send-up (call that a Cixousian translation of Aufhebung ) of his Being-there .41 Because not only is it open, "caesuraed, . . . spaced apart" (" césure, . . . aéré"), as if this opening, perhaps every opening, were already an openness to being and to the question of the sense of being ("is it a thing is it a body is it a number, a shadow, a being, a mul- tiple") , as if it were thus disposed not only to the experience of its own existence, but in a "movement toward, tension, attention," one might even say in the intention of a certain care, thrown as it is into an a priori world of telecommunications. But it also deconstructs the very con- cept of the proper, "as much mine as yours."42 And above all it is to be heard, because the siamois oí this Siamese-being is a homophone, nearly a homograph of the expression si à moi, "so much mine," in the phrase aussi à moi qu'à toi, "as much mine as yours."43 It might be added that the adverb da in Dasein is, from an onto- logica! point of view, famously ambivalent. All by itself, like the little</page><page sequence="12">134 Eric Prenowitz boy in Freud's "Beyond the Pleasure Principle," it plays a semantic game of fort/da, meaning both "here" and "there." Before being con- scripted into Heidegger's compound lexicon to suggest the thrown- ness, the out-there-in-the-worldness, the Geworfenheit of Dasein , it already hints at a sort of telephonic deconstruction of presence, a Siamese-being. But, above all, this da, whatever else it may be, is a little piece of Derrida. As if the narrator were playing a sort oî fort/ da game of pres- ence and absence, calling and recalling the departed not with a tele- phone or a bobbin (which has the form of a handset, needless to say) , not even with a signifier (all signifiers are bobbins, the text tells us here) , but a poor syllable, a fragment of a proper name. And as if the text were obeying the logic of dreamwork here, the literal, shall we say eponymous Heideggerian reference manifesting itself, in the manifest content of the essay, only by displacement or condensation, a deceptive stand-in to outsmart the censor-reader, for this other da, here and there. The singling out in this passage of the fragment "je ť" serves also as a different sort of call or recall. It picks up, belatedly, inter- textually, on an ongoing conversation that can be traced through Cixous's and Derrida's texts. Derrida's second book on Cixous in particular, Genèses, généalogies, genres et le génie, is in part an extended meditation on Cixous's "jet." In Derrida's extraordinary reading, he does not hesitate to ascribe "two extraordinary destinies" to "this extraordinary trilateral syllable in jet."44 On the one hand, it speaks to all of philosophy. Derrida proposes to use this jet to trace, in Hélène Cixous's work, a profound challenge, reconfiguring or put- ting into play {mise en jeu) of "philosophical thought or the thinking of philosophy ... in its most unexpected advances,"45 notably "the Heideggerian thinking of the thrown-being" and the signifying chain "object, subject, project, objection, abjection, Gegenwurf, Entwurf, Geworfenheit."4* On the other hand, it constitutes a "formal- ization" that "comprehends the greatest generality of the Cixous library"47 and "forms its element in the sense of a general 'milieu,'"48 while at the same time being "disseminated like an atomic particle"49 as the very "genius of writing,"50 a "smallest that is bigger than the biggest,"51 something like a principle of textuality. Ш. Caller Called "Nous en somme" begins with a conversation on the telephone. Or so it seems. It begins with a dialogue, in any case, and while we can-</page><page sequence="13">Crossing Lines 1 35 not be certain that the interlocutors are talking into the telephone, they do talk about the telephone. More precisely, one of them employs the verb téléphoner ("to telephone"), attributing the action to the other. "You telephone me," a voice says, as though on the tele- phone, "Tu me téléphones" The voice speaks here in the second- person singular and of course to the second-person singular, saying "you." And it is this other, this second person, who has called first: "You call me," the first person says, "I listen to you": " Tu me téléphones. Je ťécoute"52 This is apparently a clear, and familiar, dichotomy. On the tele- phone, there is necessarily a caller and a called. This is a condition of possibility of any phone call. It is no doubt true that on the tele- phone, to borrow the phrase, ça pari#* - which is to say that it talks or there's a lot of chitter-chatter, in other words talking happens, whether or not som cone talks. But for there to be a phone call in the first place, one conscious, intentional subject must call the other. "You call me. I listen to you." The one calls, the other answers. The one speaks, the other listens. The one is active, the other passive. As Freud might say, the one is masculine, the other feminine. Upon closer examination, however, the situation is not so sim- ple. For one thing, in a sort of performative paradox, it is the callee who talks here , in the text. And she repeatedly attributes the active talking role to herself: "I say 'you* ... I say T listen to you' ... I speak with you in your voice." Furthermore, everything is in the present: "You call me. I listen to you." This parataxis, with no conjunction or logical articulation between the two independent clauses, gives the sense that causality and temporality have been suspended by the telephone. The two sentences might be utterly unconnected, or syn- onymous, conjoined arbitrarily or redundantly only by apposition. Any difference between the transitive and the intransitive is sus- pended, as is that between activity and passivity, between the caller and the called. As if the listening could call up or call forth the call. However, the verb here is not "to call" ( appeler ), but "to telephone" ( téléphoner ), an intransitive verb derived from a composite noun, itself a lexico-technological invention that joins two in principle incompatible words or concepts, the distance, the distancing, the from-a-distance or the at-a-distance of tëlé , and the resonation of the voice as phõné. This word is thus itself a sort of chimera, and it has already mor- phed or metamorphed from a noun into a verb. What is more, in this inverted construction, the subject coming before the noun, the pronoun is the same in the first and second persons, for a transitive and an intransitive verb. One consequence is that "tu me téléphones "</page><page sequence="14">136 Eric Prenowitz sounds, particularly in this context, as though it might be a transitive construction, "you telephone me," meaning in this case "you trans- form me into the telephone." Instant metamorphosis, and decon- struction of the message-messenger opposition. Someone is speaking here, someone says, out loud, "I am lis- tening." "I am listening to you." Can one listen while talking? Can a listening subject ever be simply identified with a speaking subject? And can one ever listen to the other while telling him (or her) one is listening to him (or her) ? From a phenomenological point of view, of course, one cannot help listening when one speaks. One does not even have to prick up one's ears to hear-oneself-speak; it does not depend on a decision by the speaker. And yet, rather than consti- tuting the very principle of the self-divided subject - if it does hap- pen that "one" may indeed hear or listen to oneself speak, this only confirms that we are not the masters of our house (s) - this returns the subject to an essential solitude. And yet, once again, as Derrida points out, if there is an "irreducible openness in the inside," if there is "the eye and the world within speech,"54 then there can never be a self, identical to itself as both speaker and listener, simultaneously, in any so-called hearing-oračsč/^speak. In other words, 'You call me. I listen to you" might be read as the result of a Cixousian phenome- nological reduction, leaving an irreducible auto-hetero-affection: "I listen to you" being both hearing-oneself-speak and, , inseparably, simultaneously, hearing the other speak. Furthermore, this "I am listening" is again a subversion of the traditional opposition between the activity of the intentional speaker and the passivity of the receptive listener. As the silent typo- graphical convention of the dash at the beginning of the paragraph makes clear, the one exchange (when you telephone me) only exists in the text within another exchange (when I say " - You telephone me"). And thus the strange present tense, which seems to recount, perhaps on the telephone, the present of another phone call, giving it an uncanny mobility, remains undecidable, a here-now that is also elsewhere, sometime in the past. If not yet to come. IV. The Miraculous Catch But why this insistence on the telephone? Why this hang-up? I mean why this redial, this apparently automatic callback? Why should Jacques Derrida be so occupied, so preoccupied, with Hélène Cixous's telephone? And why should Hélène Cixous herself (the author, the narrator, sometimes the character named "the author")</page><page sequence="15">Crossing Lines 137 be so attached to the telephone, as though she had a private line - to her phone? Why should the telephone be such a recurrent theme or character in her writing? If the telephone serves to detach a voice from a body so as to convey the former in the absence of the latter, is it not the very model of translation, whereby a signified is cut from its autochthonous signifier in order to be grafted thereafter onto a foreign one? And shouldn't this telephone hang-up contradict that other quality, that other essence of Hélène Cixous's writing, its tena- cious resistance to translation? How is it that this poet who has always celebrated the body in writing, who has always celebrated writing that inscribes the body in the text, privileging the work of the signi- fier and untranslatable idiomaticity, how is it that this poet who refuses to write with a computer,55 who writes everything by hand, trusting only in the tactile relation to the written page, "the contact between my hand and the paper,"56 how is it that she can also cele- brate this teletechnological device that seems to effect an absolute elision of the body while giving passage to the disembodied voice, the telephone? Derrida puts his finger on this paradox, though he does not raise it explicitly, when, in H.C. for Life, he describes in passing the telephone, Hélène Cixous's telephone, as a "poetico-technical invention."57 The poetic dimension of this "invention" puts it on the side of the untranslatable, the impossible-to-translate, whereas the technical dimension suggests the savoir faire, the knowing-how-to- do, the potential, the power, the ability to translate, the possibility of translating everything, without limits. Indeed, a few pages earlier, Derrida had attributed a certain Cixousian "poetics," what he calls her "poetics of the event,"58 to some well-used "telephone lines."59 According to Derrida, this unlikely alliance involves a certain net, certain "name nets [ des filets de nom]" that perform "a miraculous catch [une pêche miraculeuse J."60 This catch or this haul, perhaps we might say this fishery {pêche) , is miraculous precisely because it does "things or events performatively with words."61 Here is Derrida describing Cixous's fishing trip: The powerful fish are born of the net [filet] , of the net62 in which they are taken [pris] . That is what I call the poetics of the event. It produces magi- cally, miraculously, in a quasi-mystic fashion what it names. It engenders what it catches [pêche] . This is why this all-powerful net leads out [ mène] as much as it brings back [ramène] the living thing that remains living [lachóse vivante et demeurée vivante] .63 Before following this passage through to the telephone, a word about the magical quasi-mystical net. The net produces or creates</page><page sequence="16">138 Eric Prenowitz what it also catches, Derrida says. And this is of course impossible - that is, miraculous - like a performative utterance that effects some- thing even while describing it. Or one might say that the "name net" performs a kind of Derridean reading as countersignature: on the one hand, it can only catch something that is already there, select- ing it, decontextualizing it perhaps, but without adding anything new; and yet, on the other hand, it creates, it engenders, it leads the way (il mène) as much as it simply collects or brings back (ramène). (As an example, perhaps, of such a reading, let me slip away momen- tarily here in order to add a pseudodigression on what is ultimately an all-encompassing theme - there is nothing outside the net - itself caught in parentheses. This "name net" recalls, surreptitiously, unknowingly, I would even say fishily as if with a characteristic odor, the "fishing net" [Netz] of memory - of forgetting, or remem- brance - described by Walter Benjamin in talking about another poet, Proust. It is an image [Bilde] that surfaces rapidly, furtively, before slipping away, escaping the atmospheric realm of the visual- visible, at the end of Benjamin's "On the Image of Proust."64 Ben- jamin has begun this essay as an attempt to "evoke" the "image of Proust" [Prousts Bild] described as "the highest physiognomic expression [höchste physiognomische Ausdruck] which the irresistibly growing discrepancy between literature and life was able to assume."65 Physiognomy is a loaded term here. It only refers to a facial expression or a certain configuration of facial features insofar as it is meaningful, interpretable, insofar as it is indicative of an otherwise inaccessible inner state or quality. A physiognomy is therefore a manifest content of sorts, and the physiognomist an interpreter (gnomon) of appearances ( physis ). Walter Benjamin, (physio)- gnomic reader-writer par excellence, hints at an interpretation of faces along the lines of an interpretation of dreams in which the face is only the superficial sign of a deeper latent content. Indeed, at the end of the essay, Benjamin is attempting to delve deeper than the "free-floating forms of la mémoire involontaire that are largely, he says, "images of faces" [ Gesichtsbilder] .m To get at the "innermost sway" [ innersten Schwingen]67 of Proust's work, one might say its undercurrent, rather than its superficial "free-floating forms" [freisteigenden Gebilde ], Benjamin suggests that one must aim for the "bottommost" stratum of "involuntary remem- brance."68 This is where the fishing net, and smell, come in, because this bottommost stratum is not directly accessible. So Benjamin pro- poses a teletechnological device, indeed a certain "poetico-technical invention," so as to actively/ passively enter into communication</page><page sequence="17">Crossing Lines 139 with this "other scene," as Freud would call it. It is the "weight of his fishing net" [die Schwere des Netzes ' ,m Benjamin says, that "tells a fish- erman about his catch."70 Note that the net is still submerged. The invisible, indeed hypothetical, fish are in an uncertain state: neither free nor entirely caught. They have not been fully appropriated; they are not in the presence of the still-fishing fisherman. The fish- erman has yet to haul back his net and its contents; he has yet to hoist it aboard. He has as yet no image of his catch. No sense of sight, only a "sense of weight."71 The "weight" talks to the "fisherman"; it "tells" him, through the mediation of the "net," about the "catch." According to Benjamin's metaphor, this buoyant seaworthy sense of weight stands in for the blind sense of smell that informs Proust, poet-(an)amnesiac, about the deepest, unseen "materials of mem- ory"72 living, a bit like Proust himself, on the inky bed of the "sea of the temps perdu "7S In smell, as in fishing, in the absence of any image, these materials "tell us about a whole, amorphously [ bildlos ] and formlessly, indefinitely and weightily."74 In this essay on Proust and memory, Walter Benjamin does not cite or even mention the famous "madeleine" episode of the Recherche. This is a blatant, glaring oversight, indeed, which, like Der- rida's failure to mention Benjamin in connection with Cixous's net, is itself significant. The scene of the madeleine is no doubt the most- cited passage in Proust precisely because it describes the moment when memory's door begins to give way - when the caller, the recaller, so long on hold, is finally put through so to speak. And the key to this key is not any vision, but a smell, the sense of smell. The absence of any direct reference to this scene, the fact that it is not explicitly ventilated here,75 particularly as Benjamin stresses the importance in Proust of smell over sight, "tells" us something in turn, or at least suggests something, performatively. As if Walter Benjamin were playing here on the very genre in which he is writing like a fish in water, like the water in the fish in the water, that of the critical essay, the literary-critical theoretical essay, with its conventional modes of intertextual reference. Citational conventions through which certain cultural "memories" are extracted from their apparently limidess ele- ment and brought glistening to the surface of the essay. Where they are aired in quotes, displayed in order then to be critically flayed, fil- leted, or dissected. And thrown back untouched. As if Benjamin were offering a performative metaphor here: on the one hand, the rela- tions between manifest and latent citations in the essay and, on the other, those between vision and smell, between the memories avail- able to voluntary memory ("most memories that we search for come to us as images of faces"76) or the "free-floating" upper reaches of</page><page sequence="18">1 40 Eric Pwnowitz involuntary memory (also "images of faces") and those at the "bot- tommost" [ tiefste ] stratum of involuntary memory ("smell"77). Benjamin's fisherman's net, like the one Derrida fishes out of Cixous's text, is at once a means of communication, a signifier or a signifying medium ("the weight of the fishing net tells a fisherman about his catch"78), and the poet's essential, indispensable appara- tus, the "poetico-technical" device with which he or she writes: "[H]is sentences are the entire muscular activity of the intelligible body; they contain the whole enormous effort [die unsägliche Anstren- gung to raise this catch."79 In this description of Proust's sentences, of the "enormous," or "unspeakable," "unutterable effort" that they "contain," the catch is never caught by the writer or the writing. The sentences can never fully utter what they nonetheless spell out. The sentences are not the fisherman's hard-won fish, nor are they them- selves an "intelligible body," but the muscular action ( Muskelspiet) of such a body. They are containers, but only as nets that contain the effort to raise the nets that may well contain the catch.) Hélène Cixous's "name net," which we left floating a moment ago, does actually catch something, according to Jacques Derrida, unlike Proust's ponderous fishing net, according to Benjamin. But it does so performatively. It produces or creates what it also catches. And what it catches in this paradoxically creative way is "the living thing," Derrida says, or rather the thing that is living, "la chose vivante ." Now this is a strange creature, a sort of ontic-ontological, if not an on to theological oxymoron. Because a thing, according to at least one of its plausible definitions, is precisely an inanimate object. How could you have a living inanimate object? You could, of course, if the "thingness" of a thing were to be taken as more abstract, more pri- mordial, than the distinction between life and death, the animate and the inanimate. But this would be to reduce (the) living to the order of a secondary, adjectival attribute, a gesture that seems to be contradicted by the fact that this expression, "la chose vivante can also signify living things in general, or simply life, living life, and, indeed, the livingness of life, the very thing of life, life as the thing of things, implicitly reversing or overpowering the traditional rela- tions between substantive and attribute.80 And if this living life remains living, as Derrida says {"et demeurée vivante"), it is also a miracle, insofar as the life of the living thing is threatened by the catch - one might even say that the life of the liv- ing (thing) or the living of life is precisely what has not (yet) been caught. So this miraculous net at once halts life, traps it, contains it, and keeps it living, lets it or makes it keep living.</page><page sequence="19">Crossing Lines 141 Having said this, and since we are listening as much as looking here, I should add a note about this demeure, this demeurée , which I translated earlier as "remains" ("that remains living") , but which is in fact a past participle, such that the phrase "la chose vivante et demeurée vivante ' might best be translated as "the thing that is liv- ing and has remained living." Yet this demeurée sounds to the ear as if it has something more to tell us than the living-on or the survival of "the living thing that keeps on living," something to tell us about dying as well as living, dying and living. Because " demeurée vivante ," if you listen carefully, seems to say something like "two die and: living."81 But let us return now to the citation: the "all-powerful net," says Derrida, leads [ mène' as much as it brings back [ramène] the living thing that remains living [la chose vivante et demeurée vivante] . How does it do it? How does it manage to be able to produce the thing by the grace of the nomi- nal verb? Well, this woven net, itself made of words, is also a net of tele- phone lines. She makes the net with telephone lines. This line or this thread, this cable or wire, is extraordinarily versa- tile. It can be woven to make a net, which is to say, a border that sep- arates an inside from an outside or at least that distinguishes between two sides. But this border is porous; it lets certain fish through while forbidding others to pass. And these latter fish, the bigger ones, are effectively caught, in French, by the power of the signifier: the filet (which is the French word here for "net") catches those fish that will be transformed into filets. It is thus a border between fish as much as it is between sides. And between life and death. It is a deconstructive border, at once closed and open - though perhaps any border is deconstructive in this way; perhaps there can be no absolutely closed border. Yet this one is all the more miraculous in that the distinction, the delimiting choice of which it is the support and the occasion, is the result of a performative event that produces what it distinguishes or separates, that finds while creating. And the performative event overflows here into Derrida's writ- ing, which performs, in turn, what it describes: the alliteration in "f" ("Elle fait le filet de fils téléphoniques") itself has the effect of a word net: a net made of words arranged in repetitive rows of fricative loops, or rather a serpentine longline, its f s so many fishing hooks, so many lures - though perhaps all letters are lures - lying passively in wait, like the telephone, but ready to spring into action at the smallest nibble. Like a lure, or a letter, a hook is double; it is doubled up. Not</page><page sequence="20">142 Eric Prenowitz in the deceptive mimetics of decoy, but with the versatility of a bend. In its turning back upon itself. A hook must be pulled - not pushed - to be set. A coat must be lifted up to be taken down from a hook. And if a phone must be hung up or unhooked ( décrocher ) , it too is double, hook, line, and sinker, at once prey and predator, fish, bait, and hook. V. All of Philosophy Unable to trace out all the connections of the enormous switch- board or call center linking their texts, I shall try to sketch a kind of circle, taking my cue from the insistence with which Derrida ana- lyzes the role of the telephone in Cixous. But a circle that in the first instance resembles a remarkably constant line that seems to cross through Derrida's work from the beginning, as if pointing already in the direction of his reading of Hélène Cixous, a reading that only begins to appear, in any sustained published form, in the 1990s. As if Hélène Cixous, and Hélène Cixous's telephone, were on the line from the very premises of deconstruction. Because even before Cixous fashions a performative fishing net out of telephone lines, there is already a pro to-decons true tive consequence of the tele- phone's basic premise: insofar as it transmits a disembodied voice, the telephone cannot accommodate itself to the traditional opposi- tion between speech and writing. The telephone conveys a voice, and thus a discourse, that speaks in the absence of its "father," to use what Derrida calls, in "Plato's Pharmacy," an "anthropomorphic metaphor" employed by Socrates, which is to say, by Plato in the Phaedrus . For Socrates et al., who spoke, we must not forget, before the properly teletechnological invention of the telephone, the privilege of the spoken word with regard to writing follows from the supposition that it can be heard only in the presence of the speaking subject, of this procreative "father" in the vicinity of whom it remains, within earshot, so that he may support it, speak for it, in effect, once having spoken it. Speech, in other words, in the speaking, is spoken for. Whereas writing, poor orphaned child, "goes off right and left" without being capable "either of defending itself or of assisting itself."82 Derrida does not speak about Hélène Cixous or her telephone in "Plato's Pharmacy," but at the very end of the text, in a strange sort of oneiric coda, the part of "Plato's Pharmacy" that is the most writ- ten, precisely, and perhaps the least read, incidentally - though not coincidentally - in this fantastical postscript or supplement, we read</page><page sequence="21">Crossing Lines 1 43 what sounds like a description of Plato on the telephone. And this scene of platonic telephonies - Plato, alone, at the end, quill in hand like a receiver, murmuring as he writes - is, as Derrida more or less says, "all of philosophy." I am hardly exaggerating; this is what Derrida writes: Holding the Pharmakon in one hand, the calamus in the other, Plato tran- scribes the play of formulas while murmuring [en murmurant] . The closed space of the pharmacy amplifies excessively the resonance of the mono- logue. The immured speech [parole immurée ] strikes the corners, words detach themselves, snatches of sentences separate, disarticulated members circulate between the halls, become fixed for the duration of a trajectory, translate themselves there [s'y traduisent ], rearticulate themselves, echo [se répercutent ] , contradict each other, make a fuss, return as responses, organ- ize their exchanges, protect themselves, institute an interior commerce, take themselves for a dialogue. Full of meaning. Quite a story. All of phi- losophy. [Toute une histoire. Toute la philosophie.]™ Plato murmurs while writing, which is to say that semiarticulate speech accompanies the writing, as its supplement, but this murmur is in turn written; it is given over to writing even before the stylus touches the parchment, and in the first place to the very vocal work of the signifier. This murmur of immured speech already contains more than one wall, more than one mur, the signifier, mur-mur, sup- plementing the walls of the pharmacy that contrive to keep the speech in the presence of its "father." And yet it escapes him, nonetheless, and radically. Because as this murmur is reverberated by the walls of the pharmacy, the untethered fragments of language take on an agency of their own. "The words detach themselves," and not only from the speaking subject or patriarch, but from each other ("snatches of sentences separate," " les bribes de phrases se séparenť). And not contenting themselves with departing or multiplying them- selves by division, they appear on both sides at once, they go and come, they "return as responses," and the "monologue" is trans- formed into a "dialogue," one might even say a primordial Der- ridean polylogue. Still more curious, these "disarticulated members" are at once mobile and immobile, they "become fixed," or they "fix themselves" (se fixent) "for the duration of a trajectory"; they stop, in some sense, so as to be able to go. And they seem to cooperate amongst themselves, forming a raucous, disseminating, heedless, unfilial babelian proto-society ("they organize their exchanges"). Plato was already, in spite of himself, an adept of the Cixousian telephone - this is what Derrida says here, in effect. Plato's philoso- phy, "all of philosophy," was already prey to the parasite, which is to say,</page><page sequence="22">144 Eric Prenowitz the interference, of this strange telephonic "technology/' Because, while the telephone transmits the voice itself, in so doing it is also, and like writing, "parricide": it separates speech from its "father." On the telephone, speech is present, no doubt, but in the absence of the speaking subject. The telephone is thus in some sense a by-product or a technological spin-off, in practice, of deconstruction. Much later, in fact almost exactly thirty years later, speaking about Cixous and her telephone in a passage of H. C. for Life, Derrida says, perhaps thinking back to Plato in his pharmacy, that a certain Cixousian telephony "did not await the invention of the tele- phone."84 We might gloss this line by saying that the telephony in question extends its network from Plato to Cixous - and from "Plato's Pharmacy" to H.C. for Life. And yet this remark constitutes a sort of mise en abyme in that the telephonic characteristic Derrida stresses here, this telephony that is fully operational long before the technical conditions of its possibility are in place ("I am listening to you" even before "you call me") , is precisely what the telephony itself "does" or effects performatively: the call that calls itself into being, a caught fish that was never there to be caught, etc. Furthermore, this comment about a telephony that did not await the invention of the telephone says something about Derrida's relation to technol- ogy and technological "invention," as if the effective presence of the technological, in particular teletechnological device, and the knowl- edge, the knowing-how-to-do (savoir faire) this implies, is always only the overdetermined manifestation of a general, ahistorical potentiality or "logic." One might even say the same about decon- struction itself, as Derrida does so often: in effect that it did not await the invention of the word "deconstruction."85 Let me return now to Cixous's "Nous en somme." Because, while this happy decons true tive telephony disrupts Plato with a dissemi- natory polylogue that cannot be reduced to any unified monologue or any appropriable dialogical dialectic, this scenario is complicated in a certain sense by the narrator of Cixous 's essay. He or she is in the process of talking on the telephone, about it, about what it does , and not just to the hallucinatory, solipsistic Plato in his pharmacy, but to "us," the "us" or the "we" that it brings about, by proposing to name the other, here and there, from one end to the other of the line, through a series of substitutions: I listen to you. I say "you," Utu ut'n but more exactly it is your voice, your voice for you, your envoy, your miraculous metonymy. I say "I listen to you." But it is your voice that I listen to.81'</page><page sequence="23">Crossing Lines 1 45 In a sense, the narrator says here what Plato, if not Socrates, would say, if only he could respond, if only he could hear what resonates, and what Derrida picks up, in the back of the pharmacy. You are not here, says the narrator, in sum, but your voice is. Your voice speaks for you or, rather, it speaks for itself. By itself and for itself. The tele- phone produces or performs a metonymy, Cixous says: your voice for you. Not a contraction or an ellipsis, not even "ť" (which might itself be taken as a sort of grammatical synecdoche) , but a voice with- out its body. And this metonymical elimination of the body is what makes the telephone, in practice, so paradigmatically deconstructive: on the one hand, the extreme intimacy of the disincarnated voice apparently liberated from the tireless work of the (signifier) body, as if through a telepathic communication of signifieds, yet, on the other hand, this telephonic voice is itself a wandering metonymical body, uprooted and thus given over to dissemination, free to pro- duce its own far-flung semiological effects. I should note that the miracle here, the "miraculous metonymy," is a citation or an echo of the "miraculous catch" hauled in a moment ago, Derrida's description of Cixous 's "poetics of the event." And the miracle is equally performative here, involving the performance of a miraculous pseudophenomenological passage between who and what. Do we listen to a person or to a voice on the telephone? To someone or to something? Cixous raises this question in passing: "[I] s it a thing is it a body is it a number, a shadow. . . , a being, a multiple. Who's to tell me it is not an animal, perhaps?"87 Although the sequence begins with a "thing" - that is, indubitably a "what" - it quickly moves on to "things" that confound the who/what distinction. Already the "body" is somewhat ambivalent in this regard, especially in the pres- ent context: the narrator has just said that she is listening not to "you" but to "your voice," which is to say, to, for what concerns us here, you minus your body. The subsequent suggestion that the voice (or this disembodied relationship, etc.) may itself be a body ("is it a body") makes the dichotomy that much more tenuous. What follows is even stranger. The absence of commas in the first part of the sequence ("is it a thing is it a body is it a number") is quite surprising, though not uncommon in Cixous's writing88 and, prag- matically, syntactically problematizes the easy establishment of clas- sifications, in this case simply the distinctions between the elements of a list. It removes the boundary markers to suggest that this may not be a list of discrete things. The comma reappears between the "num- ber" and the "shadow," both of which can suggest depersonalized people, the transformation of whos into whats: when people are</page><page sequence="24">146 Eric Prenowitz reduced to being merely numbers or shadows. But in French, with the indefinite articles, these are nearly homophonic expressions: "un nombre , une ombre" More precisely, these sound, if one only hears them pronounced, for example, on the telephone, like a play on gen- der or sexual difference: a (masculine) shadow, a (feminine) shadow (un ombre , une ombre). A shadow, of course, has no body, a bit like a voice on the phone. And although voices are generally strongly marked in terms of sexual difference, shadows, at least when this word refers to the dead, are beyond sexuality, sexual desire, and thus in some way sexual difference. Through this play of quasi homonymy, the narrator or the author not only performs a telephonic effect in the text, but also regenders or resexualizes, and reembodies, the dis- embodied. VI. The Spirit of the Telephone Two pages further on in H. C. for Life, two pages after his "filet de fils" which is not a "web of sons [fils] " but of "lines [fils] ," a fishing net of telephone lines, Derrida is still working on Cixous's telephone. He is trying to disentangle the threads in a passage from the beginning of Cixous's Or;89 involving a question of telephones and books, which is to say, of books as telephones, how books are like telephones, how they play "the telephone trick," " le coup du telephone The adored book on the shelf is absent, apparently lifeless, completely forgotten, yet one needs only to open it: and it comes to life, present in an extreme intimacy. I am paraphrasing, of course, in a reductive man- ner, but only so as to bring to the fore what links the book to the phone in this text by Hélène Cixous. The book as the telephone: "I dial the number and by means of a magic that no number of cen- turies will ever attenuate I catch hold of you whether you are in Rome me in Berlin you Santiago me Recife."91 It is a hymn to the telephone, as we often hear them in Cixous's writing, but above all a commentary on the book: forget about the telephone, the narra- tor seems to be saying, it is nothing new. All one has to do is listen, which is to say read, " oublire ,"92 as she says, "forge tread," forget and read at the same time, forget in order to be able to read, indeed, for- get in order to be able to rediscover again, again, and again, like deconstruction, the beloved book. Because the book is already the most powerful of tele technologies, the narrator of Orcontinues, and this is the passage that concerns us here through Derrida's reading: "What is distance? Two oceans under my index finger. We are bod- ies in spirits that are rapid like the radio."93</page><page sequence="25">Cmssing Lines 147 It is no surprise that this question, "What is distance?" should ring a bell for Derrida. He describes it as being at once an ontological question, but also a parting of ways with ontology [le congé donné à ťontologie] , with the question "what is?" What is distance? the subtext being: it is nothing when one has the genius of the telephone that suffices to annul distance and the prior question of ontological knowl- edge, that is, uwhat is distance?"94 The telephone annuls distance, indeed. But it does not annul it, or not only, by beating it at its own game, if I can put it that way, for example, by going so fast that the distance no longer matters. In other words, it is not the tele- of the telephone that turns distance into a rhetorical (ontological) question. It is not the fact that the telephone overcomes distance at the speed of light through its teletechnological prowess. No, the telephone annuls distance with a deconstructive turn. Without opposing it frontally, but by under- mining what underlies the very concept of distance: if we no longer have any confidence in the verb to be, if we no longer know what being means, if we can no longer give an opinion on the being of distance, for example, not only what it is, but if it is, then there is no longer any reason to oppose it by trying to annul it. One can only hope to annul that which is, that which responds, in one way or another, and thus in the first place subscribes to the "prior question of ontologi- cal knowledge." Thus, the "subtext" ( sousentendu ) that Derrida hears, reading it into the text, is the idiomatico-philosophical irony of a rhetorical question: what is at stake here is at once "all of phi- losophy," which is to say, the ontology of presence (because the ques- tion "what is distance?" is also "what is absence?" "what is presence?") and, if one knows how to read, if one has the genius of reading, an unanswerable deconstruction of ontology. However, reading, here, is above all hearing: one can only read if one has a good ear. But an ear for the subtext, for what is spoken under one's breath, which is to say, for what, in the text, depends not on the letter, not on the visible signifier, but on the voice. What Der- rida points out here, what he suggests by saying that this "unpro- nounceable" question ("What is distance?") is at once fully ontological and a "parting of ways with ontology," is the importance of the voice in Hélène Cixous's writing, playing as it does undecid- ably, equivocally, as if on the telephone, between presence and absence. In spite of the miraculous fishing trip he has just described, Der- rida does not pause here to sound out the two oceans ("What is dis- tance? Two oceans under my index finger") , oceans that, if we listen</page><page sequence="26">1 48 Eric Prenowitz carefully, ear to seashell of the text, suggest the limitless enormity of an oceanic feeling, and perhaps faraway continents, but also the interiori ty of a domestic inside: océans/0 céans. Nor does Derrida talk about the "index finger," l'index : the index that points, that indexes - that prohibits or blacklists - but also that calls, that dials the number, and that holds the pen. And, furthermore, the index, l'index, contains not only two diametrically opposed prefixes in a sin- gle word, in and ex, or the in of ex (l'in d'ex) , but also, on this side of the oceans, in French, before catching the wind of translation, right here under my thumb, no need to telephone - What is distance? - because my finger, l'index, already contains that faraway land, l'Inde ; that is, in French, what Hélène Cixous somewhere calls her "other country," India. Derrida does not get carried away with an analysis of this first rhetorical answer ("two oceans under my index finger") to the more-than-ontological question of distance, but he goes very far with the following sentence, which begins "We are," Nous sommes - not Nous en somme, but Nous sommes: "We are," at the beginning of the sentence "We are bodies in spirits that are rapid like the radio."95 Derrida says in the first place that this "We," which seems to submit, unlike the question of distance, to an ontology ("We are bodies"), is not a universal "We." On the contrary, Derrida suggests, it consti- tutes an exclusive group, "we who know how to telephone," how to make telephone calls, in contradistinction to those who do not. There is a hierarchy, an aristocracy, an undemocratic relation to this miraculous telephonic power. Derrida says in parentheses, "and this genius of the telephone is not given to everyone, it does not suffice to have a telephone."96 In other words, this "genius of the tele- phone" does not depend on the actual technological body of the telephone. It can be absent in the presence of a telephone, and even on the telephone, just as it can be present in the absence of the tele- phone, as we heard a moment ago (since it "did not await the inven- tion of the telephone.") As Anne Berger points out, this is the principle of the secret (here of the telephone): "It is not enough to be called, to hear oneself called [s'entendre dire] ' tu' ; one must be elected, in secret and by the secret. There are many called and few elected; otherwise there would be no secret."97 It is also, we might add, the principle of any "we." We who are bodies in spirits ("we are bodies in spirits"), we are notjust anyone, according to Derrida. Cixous, according to Derrida, is not simply overturning the ontotheological commonplace accord- ing to which "we," all human beings without exception, insofar as we are human beings, would be, by definition, spirits in bodies. You,</page><page sequence="27">Crossing Lines 149 says Hélène Cixous according to Jacques Derrida, you who do not know how to telephone, how to use the telephone, perhaps you are spirits in bodies, but we, on the contrary, are something altogether different if not the opposite. Because, according to Cixous's sen- tence according to Derrida, "the spirit is not the spirit by opposition to the body."98 In other words, the Cixousian telephone, which is another word here for the book, the Cixous telephone-book or book-telephone, deconstructs this classical opposition: the spirit of which she speaks according to him is not a "being"; it is not "the breath [ souffle ] in the telephonic apparatus."99 In other words, to quote Derrida again, "the spirit in which we are bodies" - and we must remember the sentence by Cixous that Derrida is reading here: "We are bodies in spirits that are rapid as the radio" - "is not this or that which becomes here or there rapid, like a heartbeat [pouls] . No, or yes, the spiritus , the pneuma (and her father was the pneuma made man) is speed, the spirit is this speed."100 The speed in question here is not a secondary attribute of some otherwise ontologically assured thing. Remember the "parting of ways with ontology" of the Cixousian question of distance, which I described a moment ago as not being a question of speed. Here, there is no thing, not even a heartbeat. The "spirit" to which Cixous refers here, according to Derrida, is originary, primordial speed. It annuls distance, to be sure, but not because it goes fast or allows something else to go fast. It doesn't even move; it is already there. Pneuma is evidently the translation, by Derrida, into Greek, of his prior translation, into Latin ( spiritus ), of the French word esprit in Cixous 's text ("Nous sommes des corps dans des esprits, " "We are bodies in spirits") . You will have noticed that I did something apparently quite different: I translated esprit simply as "spirit," as though one could translate without translating. Whereas Derrida, reading this French word in French, immediately translates and translates his translation in a radical way. This is no doubt something of an inside joke - indeed esprit also translates as "wit" - no doubt Derrida s way of flagging up "all of philosophy" in the text. And of course etymology is always an exercise in translation. The origin is always abroad, or, as one would say in French, elle est toujours à l'étranger ("it always belongs to the for- eigner"). But why go back to pneuma here? Why this translation of a translation in the guise of etymology? Is it a reading? Translation is a telephonic technology; it separates a signified from a signifier in order to transmit the former alone, conveying it across a border impassable to the latter. By translating repeatedly in this way, Derrida no doubt highlights the other side of the transla- tor's equation: not what is fatally, irrecuperably lost, but what is</page><page sequence="28">150 Eric Prenowitz gained in translation. He notes the positive effects of the parricide: one decapitates, perhaps, one separates the spirit from the body, but immediately thereafter the signified is engaged to another signifier, offering new anagrammatic or literary resources. The signifier in question, pneuma , entertains a quasi- homophonic relation with the pronoun nous ("we" or "us"). 101 But, as we'll hear, there is more than one nous. By translating thus, Der- rida also signs a performative gesture that, in doing something, says something about writing, or the telephone, and thus translation, as "parricide": if writing presents itself in the absence of its "father," it is thanks to this absence, as well. And thus writing is, in a certain sense, the presence of this absence. It does not depend on the dis- appearance of the "father," not entirely, because it retains also: it needs the one to be (absent) in order for the other to be (present). You will have understood that the spirit, the absolute speed of this telephony that links us together, we who know how to tele- phone, is also thought, "thought itself," as Derrida says in what fol- lows: "[T]he spirit is this speed, it lives quickly, it is thus also technical, here telephonic, but a telephony that did not await the invention of the telephone. Because it is thought itself, this teleph- ony which nonetheless also literally [à la lettre ] invented the tele- phone."102 But if it seems that, for Derrida, Cixous's telephone, identified with thought, is on the side of a chain of quasi equivalents not far from "all of philosophy" - spirit, the signified, translation as possible parricide , and above all the voice, a voice that would go at the speed of thought on the telephone, leaving the body behind - all of this stumbles, as if by chance, on a signifier, precisely. Derrida con- tinues, "The telephone is a poetico-technical invention, the pneuma is the absolute speed in us, the speed of us [la vitesse absolue en nous , la vitesse de nous], the radio that stops the hemorrhage of time."103 No doubt the pneuma speaks to nous, the one "in" the other, like bodies in spirits. But who - or what - is "nous"? A signifier, of course, and its own homonym. It is nous, "we" or "us," nous-mêmes, we who know how to speak on the telephone. And even for us, for such a par- ticular "us," this telephony that defines "us" as such is the happy exception, it is what we may aspire to but which we cannot expect because we are, as a "we," and save the Cixousian telephone, subject to the hemorrhage of time - we are bodies in spirits (" Nous sommes des corps dans des esprits'), and these spirits are, in turn, as speed, in us (the "speed in us" says Derrida, still reading Cixous). But this sig- nifier is also the Greek translation, not of the breath this time, but of thought, nous. It is thus that the speed of the telephonic spirit, nous, is, in the body of the signifier, inseparable from the very thing</page><page sequence="29">Crossing Lines 151 it aspires to leave behind, which is to say nous, us, we ourselves who can only hope for the grace of such a telephone call.

But the poetic economy of the idiom remains - must remain, my law tells me - 'untranslatable' [Mais ' intraduisible ' demeure . . . l'économie poétique de l'idiomeY (Derrida's Le monolinguisme de l'autre [Paris: Galilée, 1996] , 100) . This, in a word, in a very few words, is the crux of the deconstructive paradox: you can translate anything, Derrida assures us, if you take the time and the space, if you take all the words you need . . . and yet, when you unfold or unpack in this way the condensed, convoluted idiom, what is lost forever is precisely its "economy," that is, its thrift or pithiness. It is surely no coincidence, therefore, but an overdetermined symptom, perhaps even a fatal performative effect of the text, that the published English translation of these sentences has them say something else altogether: "Nothing is untranslatable, how- ever little time is given to the expenditure. . . .

Patrick Men- sah [Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998], 56). 10 This metaphorical determination of the difference between the telephone and the face-to-face clearly contradicts another, seemingly irresistible representation of the telephone: as translation (disembodied voice in the place of pure signified, detached from any signifier). We will revisit this apparent contradiction shortly. " Jacques Derrida, "Fourmis," in Lectures de la difference sexuelle, ed.

And that "we can still and always switch places while playing . . . interpret the role of the other and cross at every instant the assigned line of par- tition" (97). 16 Hélène Cixous, "Nous en somme," Littérature 142, no. 2 (2006): 102-12, quo- tation on 102. 17 Jacques Derrida, Speech and Phenomena, trans.

I will attempt elsewhere to track down another version: nous nous écrivons.</page><page sequence="31">Crossing Lines 153 28 Beyond the fact that Derrida has long since deconstructed the border between intradiagetic and extradiagetic worlds as between art and artist, works and lives, nar- rator and author, this hook, Jours de l'an, in particular, explicitly subverts or plays with such conventional distinctions, one of its central characters being "the author." 29 Derrida, H.C. pour la vie, 92. 30 Ibid. 31 In H.C. far Life, this concern with a certain becoming-who of the what with regard to, and within the range of the Cixousian telephone is linked to all Derrida says about "animism," "magic," and the "omnipotence of thought" (to quote Freud, cf. 95), the "puissance" of a certain "puisse" (61), as well as "life," the " vivement (57) of all that is "for life" in Cixous's writing. 32 Hélène Cixous, "Writing Blind: Conversation with the Donkey," trans.

It certainly resists appropriation, imaginary or otherwise (that is the point), and has no specular image - unless this is it. 37 Avital Ronell, The Telephone Book (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1989), 30. Ronell proposes "to reconsider Heidegger's theory of the call on the basis of the telephone." Because, while there is a "dependency of the Cewissensruf on the model of a telephonic apparatus," Heidegger nonetheless "did not wish to see how the tele- phone exemplified and also complicated this call of conscience" (30). 38 Jacques Derrida, La Carte Postale (Paris: Flammarion, 1980), 25-26. 39 Ronell, Telephone Book, 76. 40 And whatever the Geworfenheit of Heidegger's appearance here, thrown, as he is, into a paragraph he can't possibly master, however much he may care, however much his projectless project may be precisely to overcome the subject/object divide. 41 Later in "Nous en somme," we come across another literary-philosophical send-up of any existential analytic past or future, and one that speaks with particular clarity to our present project: a certain faune (homophone, indeed, of the [ télé] phone) , "a mischling" - another German word on the line; this one from Freud - "of word and being" (108). 42 Cf.
