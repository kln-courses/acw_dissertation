<plain_text><page sequence="1">IS THERE A CONCEPT OF LIBERTY IN MEDIEVAL JEWISH PHILOSOPHY? * di Oliver Leaman There are certain generally agreed propositions about medieval Jew- ish political philosophy. They tend to the conclusion that such philosophy is predominantly theocratic, that it gives low value to con- cepts like democracy and political liberty, and that political values on the whole have a relatively low priority. This is not to suggest that it was argued that social and practical life were given a low value, but rather that it was always regarded as an inferior consideration when compared with some form of the religious and/or intellectual life. One might also suggest that it is not surprising that a small and powerless community dispersed around the world should concentrate on attaining ends which are far from political, since the prospects of achieving political ends were necessarily limited. Although Jews did reach great political heights as advisors, diplomats and bankers, they were always on the periphery of society, and their very marginali- ty contributed to their desirability as courtiers. There were no problems in chopping and changing such advisors liable to come from the main Muslim community itself, since those advisors were not part of that community, and as a result Jewish politicians were more dependent upon the good will of the rulers than was the case with their Muslim peers who perhaps could appeal to some local constituency for support. The political philosophy of marginal groups often turns out to repli- cate that marginality, and medieval Jewish political philosophy as a result emphasises the distinction between Torah and nomos.

In the Galut Jews will always be at the mercy of the decisions of political rulers who are not guided by the Torah. While they may be able to perfect their religious and intellectual capacities, their social lives will always be at the whim of their political rulers. This approach to politics stems in many ways from Plato. Although within the cultural world of the Islamic empire Aristotle tended to be respected more than Plato, the former's Politics was not widely known in Arabic (although there is some evidence that parts of it were available) and Plato's politics were often combined with Aristo- tle's metaphysics, with the Republic being treated as the conclusion of the Nicomachean Ethics . It is often argued that this had a major influence on the direction of political philosophy in the Islamic world, since the Politics would have introduced the idea of politics as an independent system of thought, not subsumed under general metaphysi- cal principles. The Republic , by contrast, sees political life entirely in terms of an overarching metaphysical system, in ways which are entirely compatible with a religious gloss. The value of political life is completely expressed in terms of its ability to enable the participant to understand the nature of reality, in so far as this is possible for her. There is no separate realm of political life which exists alongside one's intellectual and religious life, as is the case in Aristotle, but there is just one approach to politics which is acceptable, and that is the approach which fits in with the correct view of the nature of reality. Aristotle was certainly not a democrat, in any sense of the word, but again he is more prepared to see some of the virtues of that system of government as compared with Plato. The latter 's well-known antipathy to democracy was eagerly adopted by Jewish thinkers also. Democracy as a system of government does not fit well into a metaphysi- cal system which regards the truth as something difficult to attain and only available to a very limited group of people. Nor does it work with a view of society which sees the majority of the population as potentially in conflict with the small group who can grasp the truth. In any case, the majority of the population are concerned with per- sonal and petty issues such as their own well-being and improving their material lives.</page><page sequence="3">Is there a concept of liberty in medieval Jewish Philosophy? 143 The philosopher in the medieval period, by contrast, is more in- terested in the spiritual or intellectual aspects of life, and many Jewish thinkers were attracted to forms of asceticism and mysticism. We should recall here how the Neoplatonists took Plato in a far more other- worldly direction than one might expect given much of his thought. The Neoplatonists were not particularly interested even in the political philosophy provided by Plato. They were more interested in under- standing the nature of reality, and how they were to come close to God. It is hardly surprising that their Jewish followers should share their enthusiasm for coming close to God, and also their distaste for the practical aspects of the world of generation and corruption. This is not to suggest that many Jewish philosophers advocated denial of the material world for concentration on the spiritual. That is certainly not the case. Jews shared the distaste of Muslims fox what they both saw as the extremes of Christianity, with its monasticism and active hostility to the body. On the other hand, there is no doubt that in much Jewish philosophy during this period there is a concentration on the ideal in political philosophy, since the ideal leads to an under- standing of the presence of God. It is as though the Jewish philosopher has to decide between working on two sorts of problems, one religious and one practical. The former is the problem of how to come closer to God. The latter is the problem of how to organize our affairs in the best way that they can be organized. The first question looks much more interesting and important than the second question, and it is hardly surprising that it received more attention. The second ques- tion, the practical problem, was explicated in terms of the first, so that the best way of organizing our practical affairs was taken to be that which would bring us closer, ultimately, to God. Within this sort of context, the notion of political liberty seems to be a non-starter. If we use the distinction between negative and positive liberty, between freedom from and freedom to, the Jewish philosophers seem to make far more use of the positive notion. We are free to come to know God and his purposes, we are free to realise ourselves as human beings in so far as our capacities make this feasi- ble, we are free to develop ourselves to the fullest possible extent in a variety of directions. Of course, the notion of negative freedom must also be given some significance, since it is unpleasant to be inter- fered with in one's plans and projects, yet this sort of interference is relatively unimportant since it cannot affect the most important direction in which we can go, to God, and other people or circum- stances cannot really get in the way of this since it is something we</page><page sequence="4">144 Oliver Leaman can do by ourselves. The notion of negative liberty only comes into its own much later in history, with the development of capitalism and a particular idea of private property, when philosophers like Locke started to explore the conflict between different rights in society. The medieval period is one where a holistic view of society still prevailed, and the individual was seen as part of a larger unit, where the scope for individual action was properly part of the action of the unit itself. No doubt the notion of negative liberty was familiar to the individual when she found that something she wished to do was prevented by someone or something else, but this was too banal a concept to be worth extending into a political principle. The important feature of liberty is its links with where we as human beings ought to be trying to go and what we should be trying to do, and this is clearly positive liberty which is at issue. This has certainly been the accepted line on the topic. For example, in his «Two Concepts of Liberty», Isaiah Berlin says, «Christian (and Jewish or Moslem) belief in the absolute authority of divine or natural laws, or in the equality of all men in the sight of God, is very different from belief in freedom to live as one prefers» (p. 147). Yet we know from the vast corpus of halakhah that the issue of how Jews are to live is not something settled from the beginning by the divinity of the Law. The Law has to be interpreted and understood in one as opposed to another way, and this involves choice by the believer. It should not be an arbitrary choice, of course, but one based on the strength of arguments and traditions, and yet it is still a choice. But, it will be said, this is not a good example of a real choice, because the chooser is operating from within a system of constraint, the system of halakhah itself, and so while she is free to pick a course of action, she is not free from the form of life of which that action is an ingredient. Yet surely there is no negative liberty which is entirely unrelated to a form of positive liberty. Choice cannot take place within a complete vacuum. There have to be some criteria for choice to be rational, and those criteria are going to be linked to a system of beliefs and values in terms of which they are appropriate or not. The system of beliefs and values which are relevant to this discussion is that present in Judaism, and in particular in Jewish philosophy. As far as the religion itself is concerned, there are no difficulties at all in extracting an account of negative liberty. Much of Jewish law deals with our rights and duties vis-à-vis each other, and it is clear that the notion of the individual which is at issue here is not dissimilar from the modern notion of the individual. That is why, presumably,</page><page sequence="5">Is there a concept of liberty in medieval Jewish Philosophy? 145 it is possible for Jews to adhere to much the same system of legislation over huge periods of time and in very different places. But is there a corresponding notion of negative liberty in Jewish philosophy, espe- cially in those forms of Jewish philosophy in the Middle Ages which pre-date the Renaissance, the Enlightenment and the growth of capital- ism? It is tempting to reply in the negative, and for all the reasons we have thus far provided. Jewish philosophers were more committed to Plato on politics than to Aristotle, they were more interested in devising routes to God than in discussing practical arrangements in this world, and they were not in any case in a position to devise a political philosophy which would apply to an existing independent polity. But if we look closer we will find that this common assumption about the nature of medieval Jewish philosophy is questionable. It is certainly true that the use of Plato led to a rather unAristotelian political philosophy, yet the thought of Aristotle ran deep. The central Aristotelian idea which remained powerful was that of the unity of the virtues, which leads inevitably to the notion of the significance of balance in living well. We need to employ a repertoire of virtues if we are to live well, and we must respond to the vagaries of fortune through those virtues to make the best we can of it. Now, this notion of balance became an important constituent in the medieval Jewish (and Islamic) view of how one ought to live. One has to bear in mind here the general acceptance of the rather Platonic idea that mat- ter is the source of evil. Matter, that which has not been formed, is often treated as the form of limitation. It prevents human beings from rising to the level of the angels, it serves as a constant obstacle to our self-perfection being anything more than human self-perfection. This is not an especially unusual idea, since we are all familiar with the myriad of ways in which our status as material creatures gets in the way of our ability to be entirely or predominantly spiritual beings, even to the limited extent that I may be obliged to break off typing this by the necessity to have a cup of tea. We are accustomed, then, to finding that things get in our way when we try to accomplish tasks. This can be expressed in terms of a number of different, albeit related, dichotomies or polarities, all of which are important in Jewish philosophy. These pairs organise and assign values to the lives of human beings within the context of that philosophy.</page><page sequence="6">146 Oliver Leaman mind body culture nature reason emotion ob j ectivity sub j ecti vity private public form matter body soul nomos Torah awe prayer intellectual practical scarcity plenty wisdom virtue Let us examine some of these briefly. The soul is capable of reaching great heights of perfection, it can unite with the active intellect and even come close to knowing God. Yet while we are embodied creatures it will be perpetually limited and restricted by the body. There are laws which are appropriate for organizing the body, i.e. the material and social parts of our lives. These are the nomoi, and they involve the rational solution of problems which arise when the varied interests of human beings have to be reconciled. Then there is Torah, which not only sorts out our social problems, but is also capable of placing us on a much higher spiritual level, by addressing our natures as more than just social beings. There are practical duties which are incumbent upon us, and these should not be ignored by anyone. For many people this is the only level at which they can perform, since they are unsuited or unwilling to think seriously about what the rationale for those duties is. On the other hand, if we are able to think about such deeper issues, we should, provided it does not interfere with our ability to carry out our religious obligations. We shall as a result become aware of a deeper form of understanding of the deity and indeed of our- selves, and we can perfect ourselves intellectually in so far as our capacities make this feasible. Some people can really only practice their Judaism through obeying the rituals of religion, while others can as well as this engage in conceptual investigation of the roots of their beliefs. Many Jews find prayer to be the main route to an understanding of God, and through prayer they will establish their links with the deity. Others are able through prayer to reach a higher awareness of God, in that they express their relationship with him largely through awe. That is, prayer is indeed important for them, but what lies at</page><page sequence="7">Is there a concept of liberty in medieval Jewish Philosophy? 147 the basis of their attitude to God is just awe, and they understand that the anthropomorphic aspects of prayer are really only rather mis- leading ways for the majority of the community to grasp that which is literally ungraspable. Most people put a value on material things which accords with the value that society gives them, so that things which are ubiquitous and vital for our very lives become of little value, while rare and relatively superfluous objects are treated as pre- cious and eminently desirable. Everybody in society has to work within such parameters, since even the individual who despises the values of the majority is obliged to share those values in her practical life. Yet while she may understand the importance of going along with such social values, she 'can well appreciate how far they diverge from the real values which different things have. As a result, she will come to value simple things, bread and water for instance, far above jewels and fine clothes. Now, it will be said that these polarities may indeed define some of the features of medieval Jewish philosophy, and yet they go no way at all to establish the existence of a notion of negative liberty. Such a notion is irretrievably tied in with the concept of liberalism, and that is itself a profoundly alien idea with respect to the period in question. Liberalism has its historical origins in an atmosphere of exhaustion with the theological conflicts in sixteenth and seventeenth century Europe, and these led to a lack of confidence in the ability of human beings to be reconciled on religious issues. These differences came to be seen as irreconcilable, and so there was the need for a structure to contain and manage conflict, a structure within which conflicting points of view can coexist without having to be finally resolved. This is very different from the view of the world held by medieval Jewish philosophy. There certainly was an understanding that there exist conflicting points of view (and where better to find these but in works like Halevi's Kuzaril) between religions, and even within religion itself, but the idea that these are all acceptable as alternatives was absent. There was no doubt but that the Jewish religion represents the truth, and while one might respect alternative ways of understand- ing the nature of reality, one should not go so far as to suggest that these alternatives might be valid. Some are better than others, or more accurately, some are worse than others, but none of them is a viable alternative to Judaism, which represents the way things really are. There is a complication here, in that Judaism as a non-prosletising religion really only applies in toto to Jews, yet if we put this aside</page><page sequence="8">148 Oliver Legman we are still left with a very different view of how one's own faith relates to other faiths as compared with classical liberalism. Yet is negative liberty as a political concept essentially connected to liberalism? Not necessarily. Negative liberty is the idea that there is value in being able to act without interference. As a political concept it is the principle that the individual should not, other things being equal, be prevented by the state or community from acting as she wishes to act. It is based on the idea that there is value in the ability of the individual being able to decide her own course of action, and she attracts merit in being free to work out how she is going to pro- ceed. Within the context of a system of religious truths, only some such choices will be correct, yet the ability to choose is itself something which Judaism recognises as valuable. Judaism takes very seriously the fact that we are embodied creatures, that we are not angels, and the polarities which result form the basis of our lives. As we try to perfect ourselves intellectually we may come to regret that we are embodied, in so far as our embodiment interferes with our intellectual progress, yet the fact that we are embodied is a fact about us as human beings rather than as angels and it forms the essential parameters within which human development is possible. It might be argued, though, that what we have here is a notion of freedom as a human characteristic, but not a notion of political liberty. For the latter to have purchase, it would need to be linked with a secular view of the state, and we know that Jewish philosophy in the Middle Ages tended to interpret the state as essentially an aspect of spirituality. There is scope for the Jewish community to achieve a limited form of progress within the context of the Gentile state, but we need to have a Jewish state, or the arrival of the Messianic age, before we can see any genuine Jewish political structure which is able to do more than preserve the Jewish community within an (at worst) hostile and (at best) indifferent political environment. Moreover, what is valuable about freedom is related to positive rather than negative liberty. We are free to follow the rules of Torah and as such we can realise ourselves as proper human beings and adequate Jews. The idea that we are surrounded by political space which gives us scope for action and independence is very foreign from the idea that there is only one direction in which we can go if we are to adhere to halakhah, and that direction has been set supernaturally from the time of the start of the world. This is certainly the traditional way of looking at the issue, and it has the advantage that if we adopt it we can make neat distinctions</page><page sequence="9">Is there a concept of liberty in medieval Jewish Philosophy? 149 between different political attitudes finding an appropriate context at different times. Yet despite this we should be wary of such an ap- proach. It is certainly correct to see an important difference existing between positive and negative liberty, but this difference can be exag- gerated. If we are going to be free to follow a course of action, perhaps a course of action which represents the path which we ought to follow, then we must also be free from interference in following that path. We must be aware of the notion of ourselves as individuals surrounded by other individuals who are potentially allies or enemies in our pursuit of our ends. How could such a notion be historically restricted to only certain times and places? It is surely part and parcel of any life in any human (ie. non-utopian) community. In just the same way that a human child starts to develop ideas of self and dis- tinctness from others as it grows up, so in any society the individual is going to come to some sort of understanding of himself as an individual, and of the other as an other. This is going to lead to questions about how far the scope for action of the individual is going to be acceptable given the desires of others to act also. In other words, we see the development of a notion of negative liberty. It might be thought that it is never going to be difficult to establish that human beings have a notion of negative liberty, since our relation- ships with other people are such an obvious issue for any living crea- ture living within any sort of community. What makes this notion of liberty a political notion? The answer to this question lies precisely in its expression as an idea to help us understand life within a group. Let us take as an example here the ways in which Maimonides discuss- es the development of the laws of the Jewish community as a route to the growing self-understanding of that community as distinct from other similar communities and as imbued with a spiritual dimension. Maimonides acknowledges that God could have acted on us non- politically in the sense that he could have miraculously changed our dispositions so that we would reject all forms of idolatry and foreign customs all at once. But he decided to work with our existing nature, which is after all a nature which he himself created, and presents us with laws which encourage us to change gradually our ways of thinking and operating until we acquire other and superior disposi- tions. We are free from direct interference from the deity, although it remains always open to him to act in this way, because he wants us to be free to change in particular ways. This freedom brings along with it the possibility of acquiring merit, so it is far from superfluous.</page><page sequence="10">150 Oliver Leaman God is in the position of the teacher in a school who sets his children a problem, a problem which they can only solve by working together and developing appropriate communal attitudes. The teacher could solve the problem immediately, since she knows what the answer is and she knows how the children should dispose themselves to reach that answer. Yet she wants them to work it out for themselves, since only through such behaviour will they more surely acquire the social and other skills which she has as her educational goal for them. The children have to learn political skills, they have to learn how to work together, who they should support, how they should divide the task up and what amount of effort they should put into it. As a result of this they will have learnt a lot about themselves as individuals and as members of a group, and if the teacher is an Aristotelian she will realise that these are two sides of the same coin. They will have learnt a lot about how organizations work, how they grow and how fragile they can be, and how each individual child relates to being part of a group. This is precisely what the Jews work out as they progress from being an ordinary group of people to being special. We might take an argument of Soloveitchik here to make this point even stronger. He points out that of supreme importance in Judaism are not the times and places when God chooses the Jews, but rather when and where the Jews choose God, when they open themselves to him and to his teaching. It is an essential part of this possibility that they should be free to act in this way, since otherwise they are merely reacting to what someone is imposing on them. So it is hardly difficult to argue that there is a strong notion of political liberty within Jewish philosophy even in the Middle Ages. We tend to divide up periods of human history and label them appropriately, as though the nature of human life were very different at different times and in different places. So we make a clear divide between the medieval and the modern, for example, although we might argue as to when precisely the divide occurs. This can be very mislead- ing when we are considering notions which are so basic that they surely apply to any form of human life experienced in communities. As Lévinas puts it in The Temptation of the Temptation , The fact that every other, my neighbour, is also a «third party» in relation to another neighbour, invites me to justice, to weighing matters, and to thought' (p. 50). All we need, that is, is three people and we im- mediately get into quite complex issues to do with political liberty and justice. How then could there not be a notion of political liberty in medieval Jewish philosophy? Certainly it is not discussed in precise-</page><page sequence="11">Is there a concept of liberty in medieval Jewish Philosophy? 151 ly the same ways as is common today, but it remains part of the warp and woof of the intellectual fabric of the time. This is a very encouraging thought, for it suggests that the ideas of the past are not distant echoes from a strange and mysterious time, but they are attempts at grappling with issues and problems which still concern us today.
