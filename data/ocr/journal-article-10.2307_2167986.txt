When the Pilgrim of Bordeaux visited Jerusalem in A.D. 333, he found only two statues of Hadrian where the Temple of the Jews once stood (Itinerarium Burdi- galense 591). Not far from those statues, there was also a pierced stone that the Jews came and anointed each year. On that same spot the Jews mourned, rent their garments, and then departed, according to the Pil- grim. How did the Temple of theJews come to ruin? How did two statues of a Roman emperor come to replace the Holy of Holies? How didJerusalem come to be the primary destination of Christian pilgrimage? These are some of the profound political, religious, and cultural transformations that Fergus Millar helps to explain in his extraordinary book. Millar assembles the evidence for the kinds of political formations and cultures the Romans encoun- tered when they arrived in the Near East. He also examines how Rome advanced into the Near East as a whole and, above all, what political and cultural effects Roman rule had on the peoples and cultures of the region. On the basis of this evidence, Millar argues that, although Roman rule affected the peo- ples of the Near East quite differently from area to area and over time, the overall effect of Romanization was to create a public culture in the Near East dom- inated by Greco-Roman civic and cultural models. At the same time, in certain cases, subcultures of a more hybrid character, mixing together Greek, Ro- man, and indigenous elements, developed under Ro- man domination. Such hybrid subcultures can be seen most clearly in Phoenicia, Palmyra, and, most significantly, in the Galilee. The case of the Galilee is particularly important historically, because it was from within the life of the villages of the Galilee, where Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek were spoken, that a new interpretation ofJudaism and biblical prophecy had been preached by Jesus of Nazareth in the first century A.D. and the heritage of the Bible was trans- formed into the classical formulation of rabbinic Judaism over the first three centuries A.D. If Christianity, rabbinic Judaism, and even Islam evolved either within or in contact with an area of hybrid culture in the Roman Near East, these move- ments cannot be claimed to be historical phenomena of either the "Occident" or the "Orient." If this indeed is the case, it is not just Western "Orientalists" who are guilty of constructing an "oriental" other out of historical cultures where Jewish, Greek, Roman, and, finally, Arab senses of identity were intertwined. Millar's synthesis begins with a prologue entitled "In Search of the Orient" in which he sets out the multiple ambiguities of identity that individual items of evidence from the Near East present to the modern scholar. The rest of the book is presented in two large parts, "Empire" and "Communal and Cultural Iden- tities." The results of these two parts are then brought together in an epilogue entitled "East and West," which specifically addresses the question of whether the Roman Near East should be seen as part of the "Orient" or as part of the wider Greco-Roman world. There are also three very valuable Appendixes: "The Inscriptions of the Tetrarchic Land-Surveyors"; "Doc- uments from the Bar Kochba War"; and "Materials for the History of Roman Edessa and Osrhoene, AD 163-337." Twelve maps of the Roman Near East as a whole and the subregions discussed by Millar are also provided. In part 1, Millar offers a military and geographical survey of the progressive chronological stages by which the Romans came to rule the area of the ancient Near East from Mount Amanus and the foothills of the Taurus Mountains to Egypt, down into Mesopotamia, across the Tigris River, along the steppe for 1,250 kilometers to the port of Aqaba/ Eilat, and even into the Hejaz itself. He also considers the question of the kind of political formations that existed in the region before the arrival of the Ro- mans. The story Millar tells of how Rome came to rule the area of the ancient Near East demonstrates above all that Roman expansionism did not cease after the period of the early empire (as is still often main- 123</page><page sequence="2">124 Featured Reviews tained). Roman rule, which actually began with the arrival of Pompey's forces in the 60s B.c. (and the creation of the consular province of Syria by 58 B.c.), did not stop after Seleucia/Zeugma on the Euphrates became at least the symbolic border between the Roman and Parthian empires in 31 B.c. Specifically, although the two (Armenia and Meso- potamia) or three provinces formed by Trajan across the Euphrates were immediately given up by Hadrian at his accession in A.D. 117, Roman imperial ambi- tions did not thereafter come to a halt; during the 160s, under Lucius Verus, the Romans advanced past the confluence of the Euphrates and the Chabur at Circesium, thus regaining the key element in the frontier of Trajan's short-lived province of Mesopota- mia. Neither did imperial expansion stop during the third century. Although the 250s saw the only major Persian invasions into Roman territory west of the Euphrates before the sixth century, the late-third- century phase of Roman imperialism ended with a peace imposed on Persia in A.D. 298/299 that gave the Roman empire its greatest extension ever, up to and even across the Tigris River. There would be no secure Persian occupation of Mesopotamia until Iovian gave up Nisibis in A.D. 363. Was there a grand strategy behind this expansion- ism? Rivalry with Parthia and Sassanid Persia has often been suggested as the answer, but, whatever the original impetus, Millar points out that the majority of Roman forces were eventually deployed, not on the frontier with Persia, but along the edge of the steppe, where they confronted the Saraceni, who increasingly were seen as a threat to order. How did the coming of Rome affect the peoples and cultures of the Near East politically? Here there is no ambiguity. The coming of Rome meant the end of all independent political formations between the Tigris and Aqaba/Eilat and their replacement by Roman provinces governed by appointees of the emperor himself. Within these provinces Roman sol- diers were stationed (perhaps 100,000 by the third century A.D.) and carried out their military duties, which increasingly involved policing the frontiers. Roman governors saw to it that taxes were collected, and gave jurisdiction. Access to Roman jurisdiction became a crucial issue in the lives of ordinary people. Centuries of Roman rule also accelerated the tri- umph of Greco-Roman urban forms over all other possible rivals. Within these Greco-Roman cities-as they should be called-the Greek language predom- inated with few exceptions. Indeed, by A.D. 312, there was almost no place west of the Euphrates where texts were being publicly inscribed in any language other than Latin or, more frequently by far, Greek. The Greek language served to transmit to a region a whole historical culture and mythology foreign to that region. Furthermore, the Greek language, Greek social structures, and Greek frameworks for the con- struction and worship of deities penetrated to the most remote of rural contexts. Only in the Jewish areas of Syria Palestina were Hebrew and Aramaic used in epitaphs, on mosaics and building inscrip- tions (although Greek was also used especially in the lower Galilee). By the early fourth century, participa- tion in the political culture of the Roman Near East only could be expressed in the languages of the conqueror, with few exceptions. Greco-Romanization had overwhelmed virtually all public expressions of political culture. Were any indigenous cultures of the Near East able to maintain a sense of communal or cultural identity after the coming of Rome, even if they lacked inde- pendent political formations? This is the fundamental question that Millar addresses in the second part of his study. His answer takes the form of a map of surface appearances, of communal and cultural iden- tities, as seen by both insiders and outsiders. This map is drawn out region by region in successive chapters: the Tetrapolis and northern Syria; the Phoenician coast and its hinterland; Eastern Syria Phoenice; from Judaea to Syria Palaestina; Arabia; and the Euphrates and Mesopotamia. Within each chapter Millar briefly outlines what we know about the communal and cultural identities of the peoples of these regions before the arrival of the Romans. I cannot present here a region-by-region summary of Millar's findings about these cultures before their encounter with Rome, as he has mapped those find- ings out in these learned, densely written and fasci- nating chapters. (The sections on the cult centers of Hierapolis and Doliche; Emesa and the Sun god Elagabalus; the oasis city of Palmyra; Nabataea with its capital, Petra, the "Rose red city half as old as time"; Dura-Europos, the Roman fortress on the Euphrates; and Edessa, the center of Syriac Christianity are mini-classics of scholarship and deserve their own separate reviews.) What I can say is that the great volume of evidence that Millar cites shows beyond question that no indigenous culture of the ancient Near East was able to resist fully the cultural domina- tion of Greco-Roman models of communal organiza- tion and identification over the centuries of Roman rule in the Near East. Were there no exceptions to this rule? Were there no limits on Greco-Romanization in the Near East? It was, in fact, only the Jews who emerged from the coming of the Romans with some form of their communal identity intact. How could this have hap- pened, especially after the Romans destroyed the Jewish Temple in A.D. 70 and expelled Jews from Jerusalem and its territory after the defeat of the Bar Kochba rebels in A.D. 135? Millar rightly points out that Jewish identity was a function of the existence of something to which none of the other ethnic groups in the Near East possessed any equivalent: the Bible. For the Jews, the Bible constituted not only a source of theological beliefs and the rules of moral and social conduct but also a national history in their own language. That sense of AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 1995</page><page sequence="3">Featured Reviews 125 national history, although the subject of lively inter- nal dispute, nevertheless supplied a frame of refer- ence within which events of the Roman period- including the destruction of the Temple-could be invested with meanings or conflicting meanings. That frame of reference was also portable; this proved to be vitally important to the survival of Judaism after the destruction of the Temple and the defeat of the Bar Kochba rebels. Subsequently the sacred text of the Jews would be translated into the language of the conqueror. But, unlike all other cases, in the case of the sacred text of the Jews, what was being expressed, even in the language of the conqueror, was a conception of a single deity that was wholly at variance with the anthropomorphic cults of Greco-Roman paganism. Just as the emperor of the Romans would brook no political rivals in the Near East, so too the god of that sacred text would put up with no religious rivals. In this one case, then, the Greek medium was not the message. The Romans destroyed the Temple; they could not destroy the message itself. Rather, the message eventually conquered the conquerors, first from the inside, through conversion, and then from the outside, through invasion. According to al-Tabari (2409), when Umar entered Jerusalem, probably late in A.D. 637, he found the Jewish Temple still buried in the rubbish from the time of the Roman destruction. He was also shown the Church of the Resurrection by the Patriarch Sophro- nius, who quoted some lines from the book of Daniel to the Caliph. Neither the Patriarch nor the Caliph needed to be told that the reference was to a Hebrew seer. Judaea capta ferum victorem cepit. This beautifully produced book brings up to date and replaces (in some important ways) two classic syn- thesizing works of ancient history written by A. H. M. Jones: The Cities of the Eastern Roman Provinces (origi- nally published in 1937 and revised by a team of scholars in 1971), and The Greek City from Alexander to Justinian (1940). Millar makes a persuasive case for the transformation of the ancient Near East into the Roman Near East, which was dominated, not by the "Greek City" but by the "Graeco-Roman City." At the same time Millar has presented an equally compelling argument for the creation of a new cultural milieu in that Roman Near East, which was, in certain key areas and at certain times, culturally Greek, Roman, and indigenous all at once. Thus, Millar's book provides above all the essential political, religious, and cultural framework for understanding how the three most enduring religious legacies of the ancient world for the modern world-the three religions of the book- developed in a context that was neither Eastern nor Western.
