<plain_text><page sequence="1">Personals BY DANIEL HARRIS Volume 55, Number 1 Winter '97 Daniel Harris's essays have appeared in Harper's, the Nation, and Salmagundi. He received the Antioch Review Distinguished Writing Award for 1999-2000. Some of the first gay personal ads to be published in America appeared, not in the clandestine newsletter of a secret fraternal society of subversive sex radicals, but in an implausibly wholesome family magazine which was not only freely distributed but available even to young children, who were allowed-indeed, encouraged-to advertise in its pages. In 1946, F.W. Ewing brought out the inaugural issue of one of the most outrageous scams ever perpetrated in modern journalism, The Hobby Directory, the house organ of the National Association of Hobbyists for Men and Boys. The publication's exalted ideals of ostensibly Platonic camaraderie can be summed up in a poem the magazine printed by a subscriber, the notorious homosexual Bois Burk, who expressed his debt to the directory in a couplet: "A truly beautiful experience I think / When true friends are made by pen and ink." Consisting solely of personal ads, the magazine claimed that its mission was "to help its members find hobby friends," but in fact it really amounted to little more than a bizarre dating service. While many of the ads in the first few issues appear to have been placed by straight men filled with a burning passion for spelling reform and mineralogy or for collecting such inestimably precious things as whiskey labels, match covers, and even cocktail stirrers, legions of gay men quickly infiltrated the directory. Their ads began to appear side by side with those of philatelists, boys into model train sets, and devotees of bottle</page><page sequence="2">Our Sixth Decade 285 caps and cigar bands who were ultimately shoved aside by homosexu- als who soon requisitioned the entire magazine as a vehicle for ferreting out other members of their persuasion. Advertisers didn't, of course, openly state their sexual preferences but communicated with each other in code, leaving a coquettish trail of self-incriminating clues. They expressed a desire, for instance, to meet other "bachelors" or "single hobbyists," especially "servicemen," "ex-marines and sea-going swabbies" who could appreciate the exquisite handicrafts of nimble- fingered artisans who professed an all-consuming interest in the manly arts of crocheting, needlework, knitting, embroidery, ballet, nude sunbathing, and-the most enigmatic hobby of all-"adventure." In 1949. one man dispensed with the sophomoric ruse of hobbies alto- gether and wrote that he hoped the directory would enable him to broaden his acquaintance with an idiosyncratic spectrum of hobbyists, from "cowboys, sheepherders, miners, [and] lumberjacks" to "ranch hands, sailors, and guys who wear levis, cords, [and] leather jackets, with pep in their step and a sparkle in their eyes." Another man made his proclivities known by adopting the foppish mask of a nineteenth- century aesthete, a high priest in the religion of beauty: "I'm a patron of the arts, who solely doth to beauty rally .... Like a sorcerer I dabble with many crafts . .. my specialty is collecting portraits of characters strange." By 1951, the well-kept secret of this extraordinary hoax was all but betrayed by Ewing himself, who let the cat out of the bag when he took to task those members who "do not give their correct ages" but shave off years and even decades, thus misleading hobbyists who had hoped to share only with men of their own generation such good old American pastimes as collecting drawings of naked adolescents, "memo- rabilia related to boys famous in history," or "photos of young men in service uniforms." Aside from The Hobby Directory, which was sold quite openly and even supported by a number of craft stores, early gay personal ads were usually published in short-lived, fly-by-night pamphlets distributed on the sly through a kind of sexual samizdat. In such flimsy countercultural "zines"' as Communique or Trans-World Classified, both of which were published in the early 1960s and smuggled from reader to reader like contraband, the ads of homosexuals appeared cheek by jowl with those of heterosexuals. One of the first exclusively gay forums for personal ads was the Los Angeles publication Romans whose maiden issue in 1964 featured on its cover an image resonant with misgivings about the propriety of homosexuals advertising for partners: a bas relief of</page><page sequence="3">286 The Antioch Review judgment day in which a hellish host of fiends jab the prongs of their pitchforks into the rear ends of a demoralized procession of lost souls whom they scald in a caldron of boiling oil and then hurl into a smoldering pit of fire and brimstone. While a smattering of gay ads were published throughout the mid- 1960s in such trail-blazing publica- tions as Cruise News &amp; World Report or the HaightAshbury Maverick, it wasn't until January 1969 that The Advocate's scandalous "Trader Dick's" classified section emerged as the raunchiest forum for gay personals during the 1970s. Here, advertisements placed by "gay bachelors," "groovy models," and "hep guys" were nestled among blurbs placed by men seeking roommates, prostitutes offering their services as "chauffeurs," and entrepreneurs selling such de rigueur health-and-beauty products as "custom-made hairpieces," "make-up that will make you look 10 yrs. younger and last for 3 days," and 'sensuous enemas including the famous Mae West health enema." The long and venerable tradition of cruising for "pen pals" through contact ads became entrenched in gay culture at such an early stage in its development because the U.S. Postal Service offered a relatively safe method of communication for closeted homosexuals unwilling to take the professional gamble of being hauled out of bars and tossed into paddy wagons. The personals were thus perfectly adapted to an atom- ized culture of isolated individuals whose only sense of community came from the tenuous contacts they made by responding to the anguished cries of other gay men strewn across the entire continent, pining away in hick towns where gay life consisted of a truck stop on a turnpike and a Greyhound bus depot. Not surprisingly, the authors of early personal ads did not have the luxury to be as finicky and selective as modern advertisers, who lust after busty blond boy toys who are "hot, horny, and hung," but were recklessly indiscriminate about the sort of man they were seeking. Personal ads from the 1940s, 1950s, and even the 1960s provide a perfect snapshot of gay life before the rise of the urban ghetto and the commercialized subculture, a world of bewildered inverts marooned in the boondocks, starving for companionship in Elyria, Ohio, and Butte, Montana, aimlessly groping about in the dark in hopes of stumbling upon another homosexual. Even as late as 1968, in an issue of the gay publication The Male Swinger, the writers were so unspecific about their own characteristics, let alone those of the men they were seeking, that subscribers were forced to winnow through ads that presented a generic figure, a Man Without Qualities, a featureless cipher often identified solely by a box number or the region of the</page><page sequence="4">Our Sixth Decade 287 country in which he lived: Will welcome all letters from anyone who cares to write. Would like to hear from anyone, anywhere. Would like to hear from all. Will write anyone who writes me. Will reply to all male mail, any age or race. Will respond to males within a radius of 100 miles. Wishes correspondence with other gay men. The brevity and inclusiveness of these undescriptive notes, like the messages that shipwrecked castaways place in bottles, contrast dra- matically with the lengthy wish lists of unreasonable specifications and inflated prerequisites one finds in contemporary ads. One has only to look at the classified section of virtually any contemporary gay news- paper to see how far we have advanced from the Balkanized world of lonely shut-ins begging for pen pals to a highly organized subculture in which arcane fetishists communicate with each other about everything from water sports and bootlicking to musical comedies and competitive bridge. Advertisers can now make instantaneous contact with other men who practice their abstruse "hobbies," the diversity of which is reflected in such esoteric rubrics as "Relationships," "Shared Inter- ests," "Just Plain Sex," "Vanilla Sex," "Pig Sex," " Raunch," "Hardcore," "The Unusual," "Daddies &amp; Daddies Boys," "Bears," "Asians, Latins &amp; Blacks," and "None of the Above." In the late 1960s and early 1 970s, a new character emerges in gay personal ads, "Mr. Right," a sentimental figure who, over the next decade, slowly edges out the Man Without Qualities, the bafflingly nondescript representative of an increasingly obsolete period of des- peration and anonymity. The sweeping generality of an advertiser from Davenport, whose sole criterion for the man he is seeking is that he reside in the vicinity of Omaha or Dubuque, makes an interesting comparison with the uncompromising selectivity of the romantically puerile advertisers in recent gay newspapers, who use such beseeching, love-sick headlines as "Looking for Mr. Perfect," "The Man of My Dreams," "The One and Only," "Please Help Me Find You," "I Want a Dream Lover!," "My Fantasy Man," and "I Know You're Out There." As gay liberation brought us into contact with an ever larger pool of potential partners, we became more and more fastidious and harder to</page><page sequence="5">288 The Antioch Review please until personal ads were transformed from open-ended cattle calls for other gay men (as in ads that read "DESPERATE!," "Help!," and "lonely male!") into quixotic quests for the ideal partner, the one in a million man who can satisfy our stringent new requirements for sexual and emotional compatibility. An incredibly naive, fairytale notion of fate lies behind many contemporary gay personal ads, which are haunted by the illusory figure of Prince Charming, of a knight in shining armor who will sweep us off our feet, thereby fulfilling the romantic daydream of a culture paralyzed by choice and spoiled by the privileges of open communication. The shift from the Man Without Qualities to the Perfect Mate represents a revolutionary development in gay men's understanding of their relationships. The unrealistic standards that lie behind the primary sexual mirage of the assimilated gay imagination are premised on a very modem assumption, that the homosexual searching for Mr. Right is awash in Mr. Wrongs, in hordes of panting suitors whom he scornfully disqualifies on the basis of a single defect in hopes of meeting his soulmate, his preordained destiny. Mr. Right would have been unthink- able to the geographically isolated hobbyists of the first half of the twentieth century who, far from having the luxury to squander their energies scouring the planet for such a destructive chimera as an ideal lover, had to devote themselves to the onerous task of finding even a handful of gay friends, who existed in a "subculture" that extended no further than each other's living rooms. When gay liberation increased contact among homosexuals, it inadvertently contributed to the state of romantic dissatisfaction in which many of us now flounder, nursing our blighted hopes and infeasible dreams, convinced that we must patiently await the arrival of our own personal messiah, an unattainable mystery man who makes many men as discontented as the secluded outcasts who lived in the fragmented world that preceded the subculture. Gay liberation has thus made us simultaneously more romantic and less tolerant of the imperfections of our potential lovers, any one of whom would probably have satisfied the more modest expectations of those whose first requirement in a man was that he live "within a radius of 100 miles" rather than that he conform to the prescriptive definitions of a phantom as mythological as Mr. Right. After Stonewall, the famous 1969 riots in Greenwich Village where drag queens in laddered stockings and four-inch spikes fought back against the police when they bungled their attempts to raid this popular gay bar, writers of personal ads also began to manipulate grammar and</page><page sequence="6">Our Sixth Decade 289 syntax in ways made possible only by the emergence of a collective homosexual identity. Men who published ads before 1970 usually wrote in a strangely detached and objectified third person in which they rattled off a mechanical list of unenticing credentials, a trite resume of attributes and qualifications, as if they were describing, not themselves, but a friend, a "congenial white bachelor in his mid 40s" or "a male gay teenager with a groovy bod." During the 1970s, however, many men abandoned the third person for the first. What's more, the writer no longer treated the reader as an amorphous entity whom he identified by the inappropriately clinical noun "male" or by such drab and dehumanizingly broad expressions as "sincere type," "rugged husky type," "hairy he-man type," or "broadminded hutch type." Instead, he addressed his audience in distinctly chummy terms as a member of the same sexual clan, the same coterie, as a "you," as in "after I spank you good &amp; long for being such an adorable, naughty guy [1] will console you and your red, bare bottom!" Writers also started to think of their ads as dialogues or fragments of scripts, chatty, intimate tete-a-tetes filled with rhetorical questions ("Want true love?" or "Tired of the merry-go- round of turn-offs and inconsiderates one meets thru these ads?"), cheerful greetings ("Hi !" or "Hey you big, heavy-hung black dudes!"), and even commands ("titillate me! drive me wild!" or "bend over and show dad what you've got"). In other words, after Stonewall, the writer seeks a new kind of rhetorical involvement with his potential partners who now form a club of reassuringly familiar cohorts, a clique of friends united by sexual desires that have evolved into an all-embracing ethnic identity. The subtle syntactical shifts in the personal ads of the last twenty-five years reveal that the writer is no longer a scared and lonely individual conducting blind fishing expeditions among an anony- mous mass of gay men who constitute an unknown quantity, a name- less, faceless riddle. Rather, he considers himself a card-carrying member of a distinct sect whose habits and aspirations he shares and whom he is therefore able to address in a confidential new spirit of camaraderie that would have been impossible in an era in which homosexuals did not share any common culture, dispersed as they were in isolated pockets scattered across the country. If the evolution of the subculture can be measured in the radical differences between the pre-subcultural homosexual's plaintive cry "would like to hear from anyone, anywhere" and the assimilated gay man's whiny ultimatum "I Want a Dream Lover!," it can also be measured in the dramatic changes that have occurred in the quaintly</page><page sequence="7">290 The Antioch Review chivalrous euphemisms that gay men once used to sidestep the sexual implications of the relationships they were seeking. Well into the 1970s, advertisers often took refuge in an anachronistic set of seman- tically imprecise terms that refer, not to the "deep-throat oral sluts" and "headboard bangers" of the 1980s and 1990s, but to two chastely classical lovers who seem to be seeking each other's companionship solely for the privilege of celebrating together a neutered and entirely idealized form of "male friendship." Before Stonewall, men never specified that they were seeking a "boyfriend" but chose instead such passionless subterfuges as "seeking a lasting companionship," "a permanent tie," "an intimate fellowship," "a loving partnership," or "a special friendship." These expressions suggest a degree of irresolution about what gay men were to call their long-standing sexual relation- ships, which were so far beyond the pale of respectability that no vocabulary had been developed to describe them other than the tepid circumlocutions with which homosexuals evoked a cold and virginal type of unconsummated brotherly love. Compare, for instance, the austere language of an ad from 1964, "bachelor seeks honest male friendship," with the gushingly adolescent rhetoric of an ad from 1992: "Marriage Material, But . . . Long courtships are more my style. How about evenings at the opera, spicy ethnic dives, sunspot weekends, a big Christmas tree, a good bottle of wine, homemade pasta for a few friends, and lovemaking beside a crackling fire. Winter is coming and I'd like to settle in." Spelling out all of the cozy, connubial activities that the reader is forced to infer in the first ad, the second ad plagiarizes the language with which mainstream America describes heterosexual marriages. Ex- cesses of conjugal terminology are now commonplace in gay newspa- pers, as in ads that exclaim "marry me! ," "are you a husband looking for a husband?," or "[let's] go straight to the shotgun wedding.... But before we pick out the china pattern, [let' s] get... acquainted." Through- out the 1970s, the language with which gay men described their relationships was gradually heterosexualized until by the mid- to late- 1980s we felt no qualms whatsoever about bandying around such marital words as "dates," "boyfriends," "husbands," "spouses," and "better halves." Before the late 1960s, gay relationships were less colored by heterosexual rhetoric because they were still emerging from a period in which two men came together without the benefit of clear labels to categorize their feelings for each other, cut off as they were from the supporting structure of a sophisticated subculture that was</page><page sequence="8">Our Sixth Decade 291 only later to invent a language for gay love by slavishly pirating it from the language of heterosexual romance. The changes that have occurred during the last twenty-five years in the way in which gay men describe the man they are seeking, from "friend" in the 1960s to "lover" in the 1970s and "boyfriend" or "husband" in the 1980s and 1990s, provide an excellent barometer of the inexorable progress of the legitimization of gay relationships as we are assimilated into mainstream society, becoming more and more accepted and, regrettably, more conven- tional. The history of personal ads thus testifies to a crucial develop- ment in the gay sensibility, the gradual rejection of the equivocal terms with which we once soft-pedaled the erotic nature of our relationships, which we now perceive as identical to those of heterosexuals rather than fundamentally different from them, existing in some sort of de-sexed state of Platonic bliss. At times, this heterosexualizing rhetoric transforms the relation- ships that advertisers describe into travesties of straight marriages, crude forgeries that conjure up delirious images of fittings for the bridal gown and eager arrangements for all of the nuptial rites, which are paraded around on the page with a kind of giddy pride. "A band of gold would be great," one man effuses, while another out-heterosexualizes the most soulful of lovelorn lonely hearts by blurting out: I'm a sweet, masculine lover, the marrying kind so honey, cuddle up and melt in my warm, loving arms, passionate kisses and my manly ways and charms. This... country boy sure is a happy camper! I got a heart full of soul and a lot of love to give. And I ask, kindly with sincere affections, darlin', will you be my sweetheart and I'll be your loverman. I will adore, cherish and love you inside and out with a whole lot of hugging and a-lovin'. I only ask that you . . . commit at creating a beautiful relationship/ marriage.... Seeking Caucasian male, 25-39, to be my dear, devoted husband, a honey that I can be sweet on. I love ... keeping home and my darling husband warm, cozy and well loved. The exasperating conventionality of this Hallmark card, which even alludes to an exchange of vows in the words "adore, cherish and love you," is not just the product of this particular advertiser's sloppy emotionalism. Rather, its mawkishness stems in part from a propagan- distic campaign that homosexuals have been waging since gay libera- tion to prove to others, as well as to ourselves, that our relationships are as legitimate as straight ones, that we are exactly like the most colorless of husbands and wives, that we do the same things, dream the same dreams, and pledge the same sort of undying true love while huddling around crackling fires sipping wine on chilly winter evenings. The</page><page sequence="9">292 The Antioch Review saccharine excesses of many post-Stonewall ads are thus in part an expression of a political affectation, the ideological grandstanding of a group of men determined to refute prevailing prejudices by furnishing incontrovertible evidence that, far from being a debauched band of sexual outlaws, gay men are in fact as normal, vapid, and unglamorously marital as ordinary men and women. Propaganda thus permeates the personal ads of the last twenty-five years, which function as an unlikely form of political protest, of sloganeering, a way of indoctrinating our readers with uplifting messages about our own shabby suburban aspirations in the face of heterosexual revulsion. The heterosexualizing of gay love was also fuelled by something happening within mainstream society itself, a development that can be summed up in a revolutionary if seemingly innocuous word that essentially upstaged all other synonyms for sexual affairs during the 1960s: "relationship," the fashionable shibboleth of the human-poten- tial movement. During the 1960s, pop psychology, in conjunction with feminism and contraception, radically changed the way Americans thought about their sex lives by replacing the institutional bond that once held two individuals together with a purely emotional bond, the commitment of two independent free agents whose love for each other was sustained by their own personal initiative rather than by the social responsibilities of raising a family and maintaining a respectable marriage. By driving a wedge between sex and procreation, the human- potential movement secularized relationships, cutting them free of their traditional moorings in the family and fostering instead an autonomous, unencumbered type of attachment in which people met and made love, not to perpetuate established social structures, but for their own physical and psychological recreation. The human-potential move- ment thus provided the ideological basis of gay liberation by legitimiz- ing nonmarital relationships and introducing into the popular con- sciousness the once unfathomable idea that any two individuals could create their own personal unions based exclusively on private affirmations of fidelity. Ironically, however, the human-potential movement, which began by sanctioning out-of-wedlock relationships, ended by making same- sex unions more marriage-like than ever before. Pop psychologists may have contributed to the new hedonistic spirit with which people cohabited, but at the same time they romanticized intimacy and reviled casual sexual contact as a violation of their righteous insistence that sex occur only as an expression of love, as an interpersonal confirmation of</page><page sequence="10">Our Sixth Decade 293 a committed and meaningful "relationship." The human-potential movement was thus profoundly sanctimonious, puritanical, and intol- erant of promiscuity, which belied its central tenet, that physical contact should serve as an almost religious sacrament that deepened and reaffirmed a couple's feelings for each other. Even though the move- ment helped create the permissive background for the sexual revolution and thus enabled couples to live guiltlessly in sin, it was oddly Christian and, as such, represented an unprecedented phenomenon, the emer- gence within American society of a new, highly moralistic force that originated from the very heart of secular culture rather than the rantings of church ideologues. Because pop psychology encouraged the climate of permissiveness that led to the growing social tolerance of homosexuality, it is no surprise that gay men should bear the signs of their indebtedness to human potential in their personal ads, where they began to express a new puritanism, a scathing contempt for anonymous sex, which they sneeringly derided in favor of a priggish sort of cloistered monogamy. "I've outgrown the novelty of sex without meaning, &amp; desire l-to-l sharing of life," one human-potential proselytizer proclaimed in 1975, while another used his ad as his own bully pulpit and stated indignantly that he "is not at all interested in the sexual superbowl called city gay life," adding disdainfully that he "dislikes guilt-ridden people who can't handle where they're at with their own identity." These high- minded sentiments were echoed in another ad from the 1970s which asked, in the droning voice of a used-car salesman in a bad TV commercial, "depressed because so many contacts are driven by sex? Uptight when flippant queens snigger at ideals? . . . Turned off by competitive promiscuity of big city? Young men tired of all this, please write." "Tired of all this" became the human-potential rallying cry of ads placed throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, which often revolved around a "plot," that of a jaded young man, having sown his wild oats in the wicked metropolis, repenting of the bar scene and cheap tricks and turning to the personals in an act of contrition in which he professes with evangelical fervor his readiness to settle down to the homely amenities of a stable, if somewhat insipid, interpersonal relationship. Since the early 1980s, the claustrophobia and uxoriousness of the new heterosexualized gay relationship have been intensified by an entirely unrelated phenomenon: disease. The biological holocaust has become the turgid muse of a literary genre that is rapidly becoming one of the most representative art forms of the entire epidemic. When</page><page sequence="11">294 The Antioch Review coupled with our efforts to belie the prejudices of our opponents, AIDS has accelerated the reactionary direction of gay relationships, which have swerved precipitously to the right as homosexuals have begun to express an almost cultish sexual piety. The epidemic has had an extraordinarily regressive effect on intimacy between gay men, trigger- ing a mass movement of born-again monogamists. Our efforts to institute radical changes in our sex lives have resulted in a strange form of overcompensation in which gay men shamelessly trot out the worst cliches of crackling fires and moonlit strolls as an antidote to our former whorishness, which we bury in an avalanche of purple prose, in "walks on the beach, romantic dinners out . . . brunches in undiscovered neighborhoods, [and] mystical reminiscing under full moons." The outpouring of emotion in these baroque flights of fancy reflects our self- conscious attempts to impose the ill-adapted conventions of Harlequin romance on a subculture accustomed to the ready availability of recreational sex behind every bush and in every public toilet. We have absorbed the mythology surrounding committed relationships like a sexual narcotic, the sentimental new catechism with which the gay community has brainwashed its members in order to curb our suicidally promiscuous behavior. Romanticism has thus become the psychologi- cal mechanism of repression, with matrimony serving as a form of hygiene, an extremely artificial way of purging ourselves of our profligate habits, which are so inveterate, so deeply ingrained, that we have been forced to combat them with a glut of amorous rhetoric. AIDS also contributed to the heterosexualization of gay relation- ships by re-creating the original conditions of atomization that gave rise to the need for the personals in the first place. This agonizing sense of isolation, once caused by bigotry and social ostracism, is now the result of a microorganism, a retrovirus that has inspired more maudlin effusions about true love than all of the arrows in Cupid' s quiver. There is something distinctly stilted, farfetched, and unspontaneous about the ads of the last ten years. They are permeated, not with love, but with fear, with a sense of beleaguerment, of being walled up in a besieged fortress, a feeling that expresses itself in the leitmotif of recent person- als: the nest, the inner sanctum, the safe harbor, a secure, womb-like space where the writer imagines himself clinging to his mate and burrowing under the flannel sheets and down comforter like hibernat- ing animals. The image of the cave, of the den, where the advertiser lolls about in bed with his future boyfriend in a torpid, semi-comatose state of oblivion to the perils of the outside world, recurs throughout</page><page sequence="12">Our Sixth Decade 295 contemporary ads; one man complains that he "can't find the right 'care bear' or 'care cub' to hibernate with or comb hair with"; another describes himself in unapologetically childish terms as "a teddy bear lover seeking a new friend or maybe a mate with whom to hibernate with in a fabulous cave." AIDS has made us not only romantic, but infantile. It is the subtext of all modem gay relationship ads, which again and again return to the theme of hibernation, of being suspended in a state of drowsy immobility like a newborn infant in a glass incubator, where we curl up in fetal position and indulge in that most kittenish form of safe sex, the neo-natal eroticism of "cuddling." The sickly sweet extremes with which many sentimentalists extol intimacy are simply the pretty, picturesque fictions with which we have decorated our prison cells, protecting ourselves from the horrors of the black plague. AIDS, however, is not the only factor that has shaped the modern gay relationship. Profound changes have also occurred in the whole economics of meeting and cruising other gay men. Well into the 1960s, sexual encounters between homosexuals often took place, not between two unattached equals, but between john and trade, sugar daddy and hustler, or even pederast and ephebe-relationships that were based on radical inequalities of income, age, and even sexual orientation. This imbalance was reflected in most gay newspapers which, as late as the mid-1970s, still did not divide their classified sections into relationship ads and ads for escorts, hustlers, masseurs, "houseboys," and "chauf- feurs," all of which were scrambled together in a crassly mercantile context tainted by the grim fiscal realities of sexploitation and prosti- tution. The failure to separate advertisements for genuine affairs of the heart from those promoting the sordid business ventures of gigolos is highly significant; it reveals that the modern gay relationship between two financially independent homosexuals emerged out of the inequi- table conditions that prevailed before the 1960s. During this time, gay men were often forced into the demeaning position of either purchasing sex or resigning themselves to unreciprocal encounters with straight or bi-sexual trade whose coveted affections were won at the price of contempt, if not outright brutality. Even in the years immediately following Stonewall, ads touting the voluptuous attributes of whores existed side by side with ads seeking the love and affection of other gay men, who succeeded in dislodging the prostitute from the position of preeminence he occupied in gay culture only in the mid- 1970s. As the personals began to swallow up more and more columns of text, escort ads were finally banished to their own disreputable section of the</page><page sequence="13">296 The Antioch Review newspaper, their own journalistic skid row of sleazy photographs of decapitated men squeezing the bulges of their wet jockey shorts above headlines that read "Throat Plug," "Eat at Pete's," and "Super Hung Fresh Grade 'A' Stud." The last fifty years of personal ads thus document one crucial stage in the evolution of the modern homosexual relationship, from its unsavory origins in an atmosphere dominated by prostitution, by conniving, white-trash predators who exploited homo- sexuals financially, to its present state of equality in which two men of the same age, sexual orientation, and level of income meet as peers. The rise of the modern gay relationship has not, however, been an unmixed blessing, for while the new heterosexualized romance has leveled the disparities of income that once plagued gay men, it has increased tenfold the materialism of the gay community. The monoga- mous marriages for which we have advertised in our newspapers for the last twenty years have often revolved around the equivalent of corpo- rate mergers between two gym-toned yuppies who open joint bank accounts, set up housekeeping in gentrified "fix-its," entertain lavishly, and embroider their hyphenated monograms on their "his and his" towels. Before the 1960s, gay men were forced to lead a deeply closeted existence as double agents who emerged every morning in a three-piece suit, fresh from rumpled sheets, to pursue high-powered, white-collar careers that were kept entirely separate from the compromising realities of their private lives, which were sealed off in a vacuum of secrecy and shame. From the 1970s to the present, however, there has been an increasing integration of the homosexual's career and his love life, which have been confused in our minds as virtually synonymous features of an upscale, quiche-and-brie "lifestyle" where sexual fulfill- ment walks hand in hand with economic prosperity. If gay relationships were once conceived as the very opposite of one's career, as one's dirty little secret, the skeleton in one's closet, the disclosure of which would shatter one's hopes and besmirch one's reputation, they have now become the very expression of one's career, its summit, the culmination of all of one's material aspirations-the Jacuzzi, the Lamborghini, the Armani suit, and the biannual jaunt to Maui. The separate provinces that it was formerly impossible for the homosexual to reconcile have merged in disturbing new ways now that gay liberation has taught us that it is healthy and politically affirming to conflate our financial success with our romantic happiness, to hurl open the doors of the corporate closet and celebrate the joy of being gay through flamboyant displays of conspicuous consumption.</page><page sequence="14">Our Sixth Decade 297 The result is what is known in the ads of the last fifteen years as "the long-term relationship" or the "ltr," an expression that differs in one crucial respect from the expressions used during the 1960s and 1970s when relationships were referred to as "permanent," "serious," "stable," and "long-standing." The phrase "long-term" emerged in the early 1 980s when the American public, with the help of talk-show hosts, self- help gurus, and even New Age channelers, began to mix together interpersonal gobbledygook with banking and business buzz words. In its most literal sense, "long-term" refers to the length of time it takes for an investment to mature, an appropriate association for relationships that are based on the mutual affluence of two "professionals" who, swimming in disposable income, decide to pool their resources in a culture that has linked dating with spending, lovers with bank accounts. In the following three ads from the 1980s and 1990s, the type of intimacy sought is a direct outgrowth of the purchasing power of both the reader and the advertiser, who is not just looking for companionship but for someone capable of sharing, and even enhancing, his lifestyle as a go-getting corporate executive: I have been working very hard achieving a prominent position in one of San Francisco's Fortune 500 companies for the last three years and have not been able to find 'the man of my dreams' . . . I long for someone to share my romantic dreams with-I love all the mushy stuff! The shadow of your smile as we sip champagne. Our thoughts are on each other. During the day we call each other at work, still refreshed. This morning we both hurried to our careers, the color radiating in our faces .... I like fast cars, real estate, the business page, my job, romancing you. Wealthy man needed for building a life together. Brownie points for world class cuddlers, blue eyes, a bit of a belly, bulging bank accounts, country homes, and innocence that offsets worldliness. For all of the modem homosexual's obsession with intimacy, the new ltr is at heart crassly materialistic. It is imbued with the imagery of the marketplace, with the gimmicks of advertising, pulp romance, and Hollywood movies, from romantic "weekend getaways" and "long leisurely dinners" to daytrips putzing around flea markets in the wine country, afternoons simmering in hot tubs, and nights of torrid passion that, according to the schematic fantasy of one humble soul, involve "holding or being held by a special man in a room lit by a candle." We have left behind once and for all the era in which gay relationships were profoundly one-sided, full of dangerous discrepancies of age and</page><page sequence="15">298 The Antioch Review income, but in the process we have arrived at a new and equally repellent extreme of complete economic parity in which, with the help of gay liberation, we have not just reconciled our relationships with our careers but equated them. By the 1980s and 1990s, the liberated gay marriage was so securely established that the old classical paradigm of sugar daddy to "kept" boy could be revamped and transformed into a titillating form of sexual theater with which to spice up our love lives. In the daddy/son craze of the last five years, we have revisited a disturbing chapter in gay history and self-consciously evoked the old inequalities, the ancien regime of oppression and self-loathing, which has reemerged in quotation marks as an innocuous fantasy involving a consensual form of child molesta- tion. Far from recreating the conditions of exploitation that prevailed in the first half of the century, when old men were forced to pay for the sexual services of younger men, the new daddy/son relationships cunningly lop off the "sugar" from the "daddy" and thus enable older men to achieve a new sort of sexual charisma by endowing them with the virility and erotic appeal of paternalistic, pipe-smoking patriarchs. Similarly, even men well past their prime can now cast themselves as "sons" looking for "dads," who, in a system in which roles are dissolved and created at the drop of a hat through verbal sleight of hand alone, are sometimes much younger than the doting little forty-year-old urchins they are supposed to have "fathered." Roles that were once oppressive to gay men have now become extremely fluid and even liberating, freeing us from our biological ages and allowing us to adopt imaginary ages simply by employing the fountain-of-youth terms of "daddy" and "son," which function as detachable labels equipped with their own velcro strips for easy application and removal. Sex roles are now chosen by preference, not by the dictates of age or sexual orientation, so that men who would once have been forced to pay a stiff fee for the unresponsive, heterosexual companionship of proletarian youths are now able to take advantage of the entire amusement park of fictional roles that gay culture has designed to accommodate all of the whimsies of its members. The new control gay men exercise over their sex roles can also be measured in the changes that have occurred during the last thirty years in the language we use to describe our sexual preferences in bed. Throughout the 1960s, men referred to themselves in their ads as either "butch" or "fem" "dominant" or "docile," expressions that described not only the roles they assumed during sex but also their entire</page><page sequence="16">Our Sixth Decade 299 personalities outside of the bedroom; the "fems" hammed it up as screaming queens, making their desires known to their potential part- ners through their effeminate gestures, mincing gaits, and lisping falsettos. In the 1970s, however, men began to use the expressions "Greek active" or "Greek passive" and "French active" or "French passive," expressions that pertain only to what goes on behind closed doors and are thus not as constrictive and defining as "fem" and "docile," which suggested that the gay man's sexual preferences were a constituent part of his identity and even of his physical appearance. The invention of the phrases "Gr/a" and "Gr/p" allowed gay men to liberate themselves from the stigma of effeminacy by redefining their passivity in sex as a specific set of acts that occurred in a specific location rather than as a general style of flaming behavior that they were forced to wear in public like a scarlet letter emblazoned upon their breasts. In the late 1 980s, we took this process one step further when we abandoned "Gr/a" and "Gr/p" for the expressions "top" and "bottom," which define a man's sexual preferences even more narrowly, not as an act that he likes to perform, but as the position he assumes in order to perform this act. Sex roles have thus become masks that we select from a whole wardrobe of sexual disguises, as can be seen in a joke T-shirt manufactured by the gay company "Don't Panic" that reads "Bottom, top, top, bottom (Decisions, Decisions)"-a comment that suggests that we can now easily straddle both sides of the fence, swapping roles that were once irreversible. Our preferences are no longer as asphyxiatingly definitive as when men were martyrs to their sexual passivity, forced to turn themselves into gaudy billboards and use all of the blandishments at their disposal in order to captivate and seduce suitable sex partners. The personal ads of the last fifteen years also bear the marks of our new erotic "empowerment" in the specificity with which writers describe the sex they are seeking. While ads from twenty-five years ago could be very explicit, they were seldom as salacious as contemporary ads, which tantalize their readers, not simply by informing them of their writers' preferences, but by electrifying them with vivid reenactments of X-rated fantasies that draw on a whole repertoire of literary effects, from the anthropomorphism of "greedy holes" to the alliteration of "big bubble butt begs to be banged." In the 1980s, advertisers began to function as pornographers, as the creators of a highly abridged, com- pressed, and almost epigrammatic form of erotic literature in which they fleshed out their sexual desires in cinematic scenes that bring to life</page><page sequence="17">300 The Antioch Review the taste and feel of sex. Compare, for instance, the following ads, the first three from the 1970s, the last three from the 1980s and 1990s: Male likes to take Gr. &amp; Fr. initiatives but wants democratic partner who will reciprocate if asked. Bearded bodybuilder with receptive rear, looking for well-endowed studs. Looking for males who accept passive role in Greek. Oil me up, bend me over and shove your meat up my butt while I wiggle and moan. Horny top wants to yank down your pants, mount you in the rear &amp; deposit his hi- volume load up you. Ride my wet tongue with your hot brown hole. Although it would have been perfectly permissible in the 1970s for an advertiser to publish an ad reading "into anal sex" or "into rimming," only in the 1980s did writers begin to evoke the scene, to create for the reader visualizations in which they conjure up the actual organs involved in the sex act, which are presented with precise, if utterly apocryphal, measurements and are invested with sensual characteris- tics like "wet hot," and "brown." In the 1980s, the ads are suddenly flooded with the entire arsenal of pornographic rhetorical conventions, with "throbbing cocks," "yummy, greasy, hairy shafts," "hot hungry tongues," "tight virgin assholes," and "quivering boy pussies," phrases that come straight out of plain brown wrappers and that lend the ad a dramatic quality absent from the plodding enumerations of preferences that one finds in the 1970s. No longer content simply to list our desires, we now narrate them, neatly packaging them as stories. Throughout the 1980s, as homosexuality became more and more assimilated into society at large, gay men developed increasing competence in selling themselves, marketing their services as any savvy businessman would plug the convenience and efficiency of his product. Just as our emo- tional lives are increasingly structured by the cliches of advertising, by gleaming white beaches, pina coladas, and moonlit nights, so our sex lives exhibit a new vulnerability to the language of the marketplace,</page><page sequence="18">Our Sixth Decade 301 which is making deep inroads into the way we think about sex. These novelized vignettes represent an advanced stage in the commercializa- tion of the subculture in that gay men now perceive and represent sex through the lens of pornography, through a highly commercial genre that has become the screen or filter that blurs and distorts our erotic experiences. A central mystery surrounds the booming renaissance of personal ads in the 1990s. Given that they were designed as an ingenious solution to the social fragmentation that characterized gay life before Stonewall, the ready availability since the 1 960s of new means for tracking down other homosexuals should certainly have remedied many of the social problems we once faced, especially now that we have fled from the desolate provinces and migrated to congested urban ghettos where we clog the streets in our leather chaps and spandex shorts, swarming together in throngs from every hick town in the country. Unfortunately, however, the rise of an organized subculture has not provided us with a panacea, and we still find personal ads an effective means of overcoming the immense barriers that separate us. Divisions that were once geographic and social have now become psychological. We have recreated in our own minds the conditions that once stranded the lonely ballet buffs, embroidery aficionados, and whiskey-label mavens who advertised in The Hobby Directory. For the last thirty years, many men have attracted their mates, not by describing their own attributes, but by issuing a steady stream of self-righteous denigrations of other homo- sexuals, whom they vilify in advertisements that amount to a public disavowal of gay life, a faithless defection from the subculture in which they brandish like "no-trespassing" signs an interminable series of homophobic epithets including "no fats," "no fems," "no swish-types," "no bar flies," "no nells " "no nelly fems," "no hardened queens," and, last but not least, "no fags." Gay personal ads are often organized around a parade of anti-types, a ghastly procession of effeminate monstrosities who are marched out and heckled by bootlicking Uncle Toms who grovel before heterosexual society by referring to them- selves as "straight-acting" and "straight-appearing," terms that reveal a degree of self-hatred unique among even the most conformist of ethnic groups, who would never stoop to such slavish behavior, fawning over the virility of their white masters. The picture of gay culture that emerges in post-Stonewall advertisements is not that of the utopic consensus of a united group of committed freedom fighters but the furious enmity and self-loathing of a highly divided and fractured society, torn apart by internal divisions.</page></plain_text>
