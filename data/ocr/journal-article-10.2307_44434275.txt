Werber Cleveland-Marshall College of Law Cleveland State University ABSTRACT Since the advent of seat belt installa- tion as a requirement for passenger automobiles, the legislative and judicial branches of government have been forced to address the legal effects of non-use where this results in otherwise avoidable injuries or deaths. Seat belt use will substantially reduce the number of automobile related injuries and deaths. Analysis of existing legislation and judicial precedents shows that the "seat belt defense" or the effect of non- use is being recognized. Considerable further attention to legal solutions is required if the benefits of such use are to be promoted so as to reduce injury and limit industry1 s liability. IT IS WELL KNOWN that the automobile presents an eminent danger to the safety of the American public. The number of seriously injured automobile occupants, as well as the number of those who die as a result of automobile accidents, is far too high for society to tolerate. (1) It is equally well known that the use of available seat belt restraint systems will significantly reduce the appalling human toll. Estimates of serious injury and death deduction range from approximately one- third to as high as three- fourths or more. (2) The members of this Society have been instrumental in designing seat belt restraint systems which can reduce the toll. Nevertheless, the American public and its governments have failed to fully recognize the human and economic savings available through the relatively simple seat belt restraint system. The complexity of automobile accidents, involving issues of dynamics and kinematics, may be one reason for the sluggish response of the public and government. It is, perhaps, hard to believe that automobile accidents at relatively low speeds are as dangerous as they are. The public does not know that death will frequently result from accidents involving speeds of under 35 m.p.h. The public is unaware that seat belts are particularly effective at such speeds as compartment invasion is unlikely. In order to save lives and prevent injuries it is imperative that the members of this Society use all of their efforts to convince Congress, local legislatures, thé courts, and the public of the benefits of seat belt use. Mandatory use legislation, coupled with proper educational efforts, will have a signi- ficant effect. A proper judicial response, in and of itself, will serve only to indirectly benefit the public. Such a response will reduce the number of personal injury awards or, at the least, deduce the magnitude of such awąrds. These savings will be passed on to the consumer, but the injury will remain. Judicial responses come only after the fact. For judicial efforts to be made truly meaningful the public must be advised that its personal injury recoveries will be diminished or eliminated. Perhaps appeals to safety weigh less in the minds and actions of the public than the effects upon their injury opened pocket books. The object of this paper is to provide a working document through which you can educate the public as to the effects of the law upon them when they fail to utilize available seat belts. It is also hoped that some of the data will assist your efforts in obtaining proper legislation mandating seat belt use. It is not the purpose of this paper to instruct you on how government regulation affects design decisions nor to suggest that better systems can be devised. These are 2.658 0096-736X/85/9302-0658$02. 50 Copyright 1985 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">topics of concern and it is possible that your technological skills can create even better restraint systems and even safer automobiles. The numerous technological and other factors involved in such design changes present questions outside the scope of this paper. I am confident that your energies are devoted to such concerns and that, within the governmental and economic restraints imposed, the automobile industry is producing a product as advanced in safety as possible. The fact remains, however, that the injury and death tolls now in evidence can be drastically reduced by the American consumer through the simple expedient of "buckling up." Existing technology has made the automobile far safer than the statistics suggest. This is known to the judiciary and the legislatures. It is important that each of you know what these bodies are doing, or failing to do, in regard to seat belt use. In recent years there has been a major growth in the passage of state product liability reform legislation and related legislation. The Kasten Bill is still before a Senate Committee. All of this legislation tends to ignore the issue of seat belt non-use. Worse, in a number of states, legislation appears to bar evidence of non-use. At least five states have statutes which preclude evidence of non-use as a basis to establish negligence on the part of the injured automobile occupant. (3) The legislative response is inadequate and focuses on permitting recovery rather than upon reducing injury. Legislative efforts can and should focus on two aspects of seat belt use: 1. Mandated use, and 2. Permitting evidence of non-use to reduce damages when it can be shown that the non-use resulted in injuries that use would have avoided or diminished. MANDATED SEAT BELT USE To date, no state has mandated seat belt use in privately owned passenger vehicles although both federal and state laws require such vehicles to be seat belt equipped. There have been some limited efforts to mandate the use of similar restraint equipment. For example, an Ohio law effective March, 1983, requires that all children under age four be placed in approved child restraint systems. (4) Violation of this statute is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of only ten dollars and the parent's negligence in failing to obey the law cannot be used to establish negligence against the child so as to reduce recovery. This law is largely unenforced and the public is largely unaware of it. Countless violations can be seen daily and prosecution for violation is highly unlikely. An unreported case widely discussed in the media resulted in a verdict of not guilty where the child had been killed in an accident and it was quite clear that the restraint system would have prevented the death. Despite the general lack of enforcement such statutes will ultimately aid in the prevention of injury to children. That such statutes exist at all is a credit to the bodies that have passed them. A primary assertion against mandatory use legislation is that it interferes with the public's freedom of choice and impinges upon their constitutional rights. There is an impingement. This limited impingement does not rise to a constitutional dimension. The state police power to promote the health and general welfare permits mandatory use legislation. The effects of injury or death to a given individual have direct and immediate effects upon other individuals and the state. As poet John Donne observed, "No man is an Hand, intire of it selfe." The benefits of use were sufficient to overcome constitutional attacks made in the related area of motorcycle helmet use legislation. Such legislation was upheld in many courts and similar, even more compelling, reasons support mandatory seat belt use legislation. Such legislation already exists on the international level and has dramatically illustrated the actual benefits of seat belt use and the increased amount of such use as a direct result of the legislation. (3) The compelling state interest in protecting the lives of countless citizens was recognized to support motorcycle helmet use legislation against claims of violation of the commerce and equal protection provisions of the Constitution. A lower New York court in People v. Carmichael, reduced the commerce question to a single sentence declaring that "... a valid exercise of police power is not rendered invalid because it may incidentally affect interstate commerce. " (6) Even assuming that there is some encroachment on personal liberty, no violation of the equal protection clause exists. Seat belt use legislation would be adequately supported by the requisite rational basis. For this reason a three judge federal district court upheld the Massachusetts helmet use law in Simon v. Sargent. (7) The court noted the dangers inherent in the use of motorcyles and emphasized the fact that injuries to motorcyclists create costs to both the individual and to society. As such 2.659</page><page sequence="3">2.660 S. J. WERBER legislation protects both the individual and the public, many courts have shown a willingness to uphold use legislation against all claims of impermissable invasion of personal rights. In essence, the courts have held that a person does not possess the right to unreasonably gamble with his or her own life. (8) Since the Supreme Court of the United States has affirmed the Simon decision, there can be no lingering doubts as to the validity of mandatory use legislation when that legislation is based on a sound factual basis of injury prevention. Seat belts would save more lives and prevent more injuries than motorcycle helmets. There is no question but that the rationale which upholds helmet use laws applies with even greater force to seat belt use laws. If the Congress or legislatures can be convinced to enact such laws those laws will be upheld. No legislature should be permitted to escape confronting the issue by asserting that a constitutional question exists. The potential for injury and death prevention that such simple legislation would realize is a moral imperative. LEGISLATION EFFECTING USE OF SEAT BELT EVIDENCE Other than standard rules of evidence relating to questions of relevance, none of which preclude the admission of seat belt non-use evidence, there is a paucity of specific legislation addressed to this question. What little legislation exists is counter-productive. In light of judicial reluctance to uniformly accept use of seat belt evidence, it is important that appropriate legislation be enacted including repeal of existing legislation which bars such evidence. Proper mandatory use legislation should include a provision that evidence of non-use is admissible to reduce damages. Even if such a provision is not included the courts could properly interpret such legislation as implying a form of negligence which must be taken into account when determining damages. At this time the most well known legislative enactment dealing with seat belt use is the negative provision found in the Virginia laws. This statute, contrary to the proper goal of injury prevention through encouragement of seat belt use, specifies that: 11 ... failure to use such safety lap belts or a combination of lap belts and shoulder straps or harnesses after installation shall not be deemed negligence. 11 (9) Despite this restrictive statute, a federal court, aware of the true benefits of seat belt evidence, determined that such evidence was admissible. (10) This court ruled that in a product suit involving a motor vehicle the jury must be given cognizance of the full design of the automobile, including seat belts, in order to deter ine whether the design was defective. The court further found that evidence of non-use was appropriate in regard to the issue of damages. If non-use bore on the injuries sustained, the court ruled that such evidence could be weighed by the jury in mitigation of damages. In this way the court obviated the wording of the limiting statute and gave effect to the practical realities which accompany both design decisions and non-use effects. To do so the court had to narrowly construe a broad statute to effect accident causation rather than injury causation. Only time will tell whether the Virginia Supreme Court will take a similar approach. If it does, the General Assembly of the State will have to be convinced not to overrule the courts by passage of additional restrictive legislation. What must be noted is that such statutes are predicated upon an improper presumption, viz . , that it is not unreasonable to ignore an available seat belt. The legislative initiative must be refocused to recognize that it is imprudent and unreasonable not to wear a seat belt. The law must reflect prudence and reason rather than meekly reflect the fact that most Americans simply do not want to wear seat belts. The courts have long recognized that the basis for imposition of liability in negligence is predicated on what the reasonable person should do rather than what any number of persons actually do. (11) The reasons for non-use are specious, focusing on purported discomfort and the fear that fire or submersion situations are made more dangerous by seat belt use. Perhaps more comfortable belts can be designed. The fact is that consumer dicomfort is primarily a rationalization to justify unreasonable and unsafe conduct. The data establishes the relative infrequency of both fire and submersion accidents (12) and the public must be made aware of this data. In many such cases the unbelted occupant (unlike the belted) will sustain injuries making escape impossible. The brief discussion above illustrates that the potential for life saving and cost saving legislation is present. It also illustrates that the legislative response to such potential is unrealized. Mandatory use legislation does not exist on any state wide level; existing legislation often is directly contra to the true heed (as the Virginia legislation) or ineffective (as the Ohio child restraint law). If there is to be any compelling societal demand imposed</page><page sequence="4">LEGAL EFFECTS OF SEAT BELT NON-USE 2.661 upon the American public which demands that the public utilize available seat belts, it is unlikely that this will be done legislatively .( 13) The burden to establish and enforce such a demand therefore rests upon the judiciary. THE JUDICIAL APPROACH TO SEAT BELT NON-USE Historically, the courts1 reluctance to impose a duty to wear available seat belts parallels the ineffective legislative approach. For many years the vast majority of courts simply refused to digress from established judicial concepts of negligence. Since the courts did not perceive non-use as negligence, the seat belt defense was unavailable. Modern courts are taking a more engligh tened view and, despite setbacks, a trend toward permitting such evidence in civil actions is emerging. For purposes of this paper the term "seat belt defense" refers to the right of a defendant to submit evidence establishing that the injuries sustained during an automobile accident would have been reduced or eliminated had a seat belt been worn. This paper is not concerned with any aspect of non-use as accident causing due to loss of vehicle control nor with the increasing number of cases asserting that a belt defect caused an otherwise avoidable injury. (14) Disdain for the beneficial effects upon life and safety which could be achieved by a proper judicial approach was first observed in a well known North Carolina decision, Miller v. Miller. (13) Miller established the foundations upon which rejection of the seat belt defense was predicated for years to come. To understand Miller and its impropriety its predicates must be understood. First, the decision did not involve an automobile manufacturer and, for this reason, overall vehicle design was not in issue. Nevertheless, other courts, including the Washington Supreme Court in Amend v. Bell(16), have followed and expanded the Miller rationale. This expansion has included many decisions in which the issue was one of product safety as distinct from negligence of a vehicle operator. Second, the Miller court suggested that any standard mandating seat belt use was better the function of the legislature. This is a typical method by which a court can avoid making a hard decision especially where that decision would result in reduction or elimination of recovery. The deference to legislation concept was rejected by virtually every court in the country as the concept of automotive crashworthiness evolved. (17) The crashworthiness doctrine is more far-reaching than that of the seat belt defense. It created a new theory of action despite the existence of legislation directed to the same issue of automotive safety. Deference to the legislature has no place in the proper evolution of common law defenses to common law created causes of action. Finally, the court relied on the purported speculative nature of how effective use of a seat belt would have been under a specific set of accident circumstances. Relying on secondary authority, the court asserted that there were too many unknown variables related to degree, direction and kinds of forces (among other factors) which prohibited a determination of injury reduction. The argument of speculation is perhaps the strongest argument made by the court and has been relied upon by other courts to reject application of the seat belt defense. This argument is seen in the Amend decision, which relied heavily upon Miller, to assert that the defense was not available (again in a situation which did not involve a product defendant) for at least five reasons : 1. That a plaintiff does not have to predict the negligence of another; 2. The availability of seat belts was fortuitous ; 3. The majority of Americans do not wear seat belts; 4. That admission of such testimony would create a battle of experts; and 5. That the quality of such evidence was speculative. The factors specified by the Amend court have, of course, a certain degree of surface appeal and validity. It is correct to assert that one does not have to anticipate and guard against the negligence of others in many situations. Here, however, such negligence is clearly foreseeable and the protective measure to diminish the harm is so minimal that this assertion has no substantive value. The court was simply erroneous in asserting that seat belt availability was fortuitous. Authoritative data indicates that by 1978 over 95% of all passenger vehicles in the United States were equipped with seat belts. It would have been fortuitous had the vehicle not been so equipped especially since seat belt installation was federally mandated effective January 1, 1968. On the other hand, it is true that the majority of Americans do not wear seat belts. However, this has no proper place in determining the question of whether people should wear belts. A reasonable and prudent person</page><page sequence="5">2.662 S. J. WERBER would do so and the legal standard for imposition of duty is what a reasonable person would do rather than what even a majority of persons actually do. The duty to wear a seat belt cannot be analogized to concepts of majority rule. The court also asserted that a battle of experts would ensue. Such battles are common place in crashworthiness actions and numerous other product cases as well as in patent litigation, medical malpractice situations and a host of other civil actions. The jury system has recognized and effectively dealt with such battles for generations. As noted by the dissent in Amend : The spectre raised by the majority as to 'a veritable battle of experts' is just that: a ghostly apparition with no substance. Surely the testimony of experts on seat belts would cause no more 'substantial speculation by the trier of facts' than numerous other factual issues which are routinely addressed. 89 Wash. 2d 124,135, 570 P. 2d 138,144 (1977). This dissent also dealt effectively with the assertion that since the legislative mandated installation but not use, no inference related to mandatory use was appropriate. The dissent observed that: When a car is equipped with seat belts pursuant to legislative mandate, it is obvious that they are placed in the vehicle so that they may be used and thus accomplish the purpose of their placement. To hold that they need not be used is both to disregard logically implied legislative intent they be used and to run afoul of the common law principle governing recovery of damages that there should be no recovery of damages for harm avoidable by the exercise of due care. 89 Wash. 2d 124, 570 P. 2d 138,147. The factors relied upon in Amend are, in their totality, unfounded. The strongest factor, that of speculation, may have been true when this area of the law first emerged. By the time the Amend case was decided any such claim was not supportable. It is paradoxical to assert that a plaintiff can establish the degree of his enhanced injury for purposes of establishing a claim under the theory of crashworthiness, but that a defendant cannot establish the correlative aspect of injury reduction. The battle of experts and quality of testimony is no greater in seat belt cases than in crashworthiness cases. What is purportedly non-speculative in one is equally non-speculative in the other. The fact is that such evidence is usually non-speculative in the legal sense. To the extent that it is marginally speculative it is well within the capacity of the fact finder to weigh and evaluate such evidence within the context of the overall accident and injury circumstances. In those circumstances in which the court does not believe the evidence has reached a credibility threshold the trial court can preclude the evidence or decide the case as a matter of law. Trial court discretion is more than an adequate check on the use of speculative evidence. The law should reflect the ability of qualified experts to render sound opinions. Whether evidence is of a quality to reach the jury is a question in every case and is faced by the courts every day in numerous situations. To preclude such evidence on the blanket assumption that it is always too speculative, as a matter of law, is to violate recognized principles of evidence and to ignore technological advances. Expert testimony can now be predicated upon automobile accident reconstruction of a most sophisticated nature. High speed crash testing with anthropomorphic dummies is now commonplace and such testing is an integral aspect of automobile design. Human tolerances are more clearly defined than ever before. The relationship of the movement of accident vehicles and their occupants can be ascertained with adequate scientific certainty. Sophisticated computer programs can aid in the reconstruction of accident circumstances and injury causes. Such programs can recreate the same accident with or without seat belt use to establish injury patterns. The combined efforts of engineers, anatomists, doctors and computer experts permit non-speculative evaluation of whether a seat belt would have lessened injuries sustained in almost any accident circumstance. Perhaps in recognition of these facts and a more intelligent approach to common law doctrine as well as the emergence of principles of comparative fault, the evolving trend is to refute Miller. Slowly, and with set-backs, the courts have recognized the efficacy of the seat belt defense. This trend will help to prevent future injury to an untold number of automobile occupants. It is also becoming apparent that rejection of evidence pertaining to non-use of seat belts as it relates to injury (damage) causation is an anomoly. For example, if a homeowner has a fire extinguisher and fails to use it to extinguish a small fire in the home the courts can permit such evidence in mitigation of damages. Similarly, the</page><page sequence="6">LEGAL EFFECTS OF SEAT BELT NON-USE 2.663 aircraft pilot who has a parachute and fails to use it when the plane is going to crash has contributed to his own injury. The pilot's death or injury cannot be attributed solely to the failure of the aircraft. Courts can recognize this when weighing whether recovery should be permitted or, at the least, when ascertaining how damages should be measured. Such judicial weighing of all contributing factors is consistent with principles of comparative fault. Such principles have now been adopted in at least forty states. (18) Before turning to specific legal doctrines which have been analyzed by the courts, one factor must be noted. The courts have long recognized that legal principles can be an effective means to encourage injury reduction. Concepts of liability have been expanded because of the belief that this would deter wrongful, non-safety conscious, design decisions. (19) The corallary is the promotion of good conduct which can be defined as safe design. Many courts remain unwilling to recognize that imposition of a duty to wear seat belts is consistent with the goal of encouraging conduct which will reduce injury. The least expensive and most effective means to reduce automobile related injury is through the use of seat belts. If judicial decision can impact upon manufacturing design choices by changing conscious design decisions, it can also impact upon the individual's personal conduct. Imposition of the seat belt defense will ultimately regulate personal conduct without the need for criminal sanctions. Permitting this defense will simply mean that if the public chooses to avoid this simple safety step the public will pay the price for its own foolishness. The undue economic burden upon the industry will be lifted from its shoulders and placed upon the party who is in the best position to prevent that burden from arising in the first instance. The cost of such injury will be placed upon the most efficient cost avoider . COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE- This concept has a variety of names including comparative fault and comparative causation. The scope of application is often reflected in the description. For purposes of this article the concept means that the fact finder is permitted to weigh the contributions of all parties to both the accident and its resultant injuries. A more comprehensive analysis of comparative negligence can be found in my earlier articles which detail its relationship to principles of crashworthiness, strict liability, joint and several liability, and the distinctions between "pure" and "modified" versions. (20) At this time we are concerned only with whether courts have observed and promoted the policies which underlie the doctrine through application of the seat belt defense. Principles of comparative negligence are the most likely means by which seat belt non-use evidence can be admitted at trial. Such evidence will usually be admitted in regard to the issue of damages reduction, but can also be useful in determining whether the subject automobile was defective. It has been stated that adoption of comparative principles will "ineluctably lead to the adoption of the seat belt rule..." for damage apportionment. (21) The logic of that statement is valid. More important than its logic is the fact that a significant number of courts deciding the issue in comparative negligence states have accepted the doctrine as a means by which damages can be reduced. (22) The trend toward adoption of the seat belt defense in comparative negligence states has continued into the 1980s. However, the trend is not uniform. The Montana Supreme Court relied heavily on Amend to reject the defense despite a difference in fact patterns. (23) A Kansas appellate court, relying on a pre- comparative fault decision of the state supreme court, felt compelled to reject the seat belt non-use evidence even though it clearly established that Plaintiff's facial injuries were avoidable. (24) These set-backs to acceptance of the defense are outweighed by other recent decisions. (25) The decision of a Louisiana appellate court is of considerable interest. (26) Here the court was faced with a claim that the door latch of a Ford automobile was defective and resulted in an ejection related death during an intersection collision. Although seat belt non-use evidence is most often utilized to address the question of damages reduction, here it was admitted to assist the jury in resolving the question of defect. The trial court permitted evidence related to the seat belt consistent with a jury charge that all features of the vehicle must be considered to determine whether it was defective in design. This approach is consistent with basic design concepts and was previously applied in the leading decision of Dreisonstock v. Volkswagenwerk, A. G. (27) Plaintiff urged that allowing the seat belt evidence permitted Ford to utilize a defense of contributory negligence which was not appropriate under Louisiana law. Plaintiff was asserting that application of the "whole" vehicle concept was merely a maneuver to indirectly establish contributory negligence. The appellate</page><page sequence="7">2.664 S. J. WERBER court rejected this assertion and upheld a jury verdict in favor of Ford stating: Ford's defense to the allegations of design defect was that the vehicle was designed as safely as possible. Ford maintains that the design of the vehicle as a whole, including all of the restraint devices, was such that no defect existed. In this light, evidence of the existence of seat belts was properly before the jury. McElroy v. Allstate Insurance Co. 420 So. 2d 214,217 (1982). The more traditional role of seat belt evidence is illustrated by the decisions in Honda Motor Co. , Ltd. v. Marcus and Foley v. City of West Allis. (28) In Marcus , the trial court reduced a damage award by 10% due to Plaintiff's failure to wear an available seat belt. The appellate court reversed on the grounds that the defendant failed to show a causal relation between the non-use and the injury sustained. The appellate court did not take a position on the seat belt defense per se, but arguably approved the trial court's approach sub silencio. The opinion might have sustained the trial court had the defendant presented sufficient evidence. The problem with the result in Marcus was not only the unclear status of Florida law. It was also the failure of the defendant to properly document the effect of non-use. Unless proper expert testimony is presented the defense will not be permitted. It is insufficient to simply assert that use would decrease injury no matter how obvious the truth of the claim. A heavy burden of proof is imposed and must be met. Specific expert testimony is essential. A similar result is found in Sours v. General Motors Corp. (29) In this case the court was faced with a single vehicle roll-over accident. Plaintiff alleged that he was injured due to a collapse of the vehicle roof. Defendant attempted to submit evidence of non-use and was precluded by the district court. A proper profer of the evidence was made. However, the facts did establish that the injury was caused by contact with the roof and supported a finding that use of a seat belt would not have prevented the injury. The court of appeals observed that Defendant's proofs could not have established more had the seat belt defense been permitted thereby rendering any error non-prejudicial. Despite recognition of the split weight of authority, the court avoided the need to rule on the seat belt issue. To reach its conclusion of non- prejudicial error the court seemed to assert that any evidence of the existence of a seat belt was sufficient. In other words, the fact of the existence of the belt and its non-use was all that the defendant was entitled to. The court failed to recognize that this factual evidence, without the ability to properly argue its significance, was prejudicial. Counsel for defendant were forced to submit inadequate proofs and to make inadequate arguments to the jury due to the ruling of the district court. The appellate court's reasoning permitted it to affirm a plaintiff's judgment which, in light of all the circumstances, may have been too high. Indeed, a proper ruling, which did not avoid the seat belt issue, could have resulted in a judgment for defendant. If additional case law permitting the seat belt defense is to develop, it is essential that defendants and their counsel offer sufficient evidence to clearly establish the relevance of non-use. The relative paucity of clear decisions over the past three years may reflect judicial reluctance to apply this somewhat new defense approach. The reluctance is justified if the evidence is not properly presented at trial. No such reluctance is found in the Foley case. This decision reiterates Wisconsin's adherence to the admissibility of seat belt non-use as evidence which supports a reduction of damages. In a fact situation similar to that of Amend, the Wisconsin Supreme Court reached an entirely different result. The result it reached is in accord with legal principles and technological advances contrary to opinions rejecting such evidence. This was a negligence action. The jury was required to apportion the negligent conduct which caused the accident (between the two drivers) and compare this conduct to Plaintiff's negligence in failing to wear an available seat belt. Observing that its prior decision is Bentzler v. Braun (30) held that non-use could be negligence if a causal relationship between such non-use and injury could be established, the court ruled that, "...those who fail to use available seat belts should be held responsible for the incremental harm caused by their f ailure. . . " (31) As to the distinction between first and second collisions it was determined that, "damages can be apportioned between the two incidents. "(32) This decision was rendered in the context of an applicable comparative negligence law (which explains the court's use of the term "negligence"). The plaintiff would have to prove the damages without regard to seat belt non-use. This amount would then be decreased by the percentage of plaintiff's causal seat belt</page><page sequence="8">LEGAL EFFECTS OF SEAT BELT NON-USE 2,665 negligence. The decrease would have to be established by evidence submitted by the defendant. This approach is consistent with the concept of avoidable consequences and mitigation of damages. It has frequently been asserted that to disallow the use of avoidable consequences and mitigation overemphasizes technical legal meaning. Rejection of these defenses amounts to exalting form over substance. The Wisconsin court echoed this belief by reliance upon the work of Prosser to refute the "...entirely artificial emphasis upon the moment of impact, and the pure mechanics of causation. 11 (33) The court concluded its determination by showing that application of the seat belt defense comported with the doctrine of contributory negligence as modified by comparative principles. Although neither avoidable consequences nor traditional mitigation concepts are directly involved because they apply where the plaintiff's conduct occurs subsequent to defendant's negligence, their objectives are furthered by application of the seat belt defense. Plaintiff can recover for injuries caused by the defendant, but the defendant is not liable for incremental injuries which plaintiff could and should have avoided. Such a resolution of the case was found consistent with public policy as it would promote safety and deter further harmful conduct by defendants. The court expressed its hope that "...passengers will also be encouraged to wear seat belts if their potential compensation for injuries is reduced. " (34) It must be noted that unlike the pattern in Marcus , and possibly in Sours , sufficient evidence related to non-use was presented. Expert testimony supported the jury findings. The Foley decision, and others like it, fully repudiate the false premises and illogical results of cases such as Amend. The decision makes abundantly clear a significant number of factual and legal points including: 1. Juries are capable of comparing defect and conduct; 2. Juries are capable of evaluating technical testimony; 3. Seat belt availability is the norm, not a fortuitous event; 4. Legislative inaction is not a bar to judicial application of an appropriate legal solution; 5. The purported absence of a duty to foresee the negligence of another is irrelevant to the seat belt defense; and 6. Fairness demands evaluation of all factors which cause or prevent injury under any accident circumstance. The admission of evidence related to seat belt non-use (recognition of the seat belt defense) is consistent with principles of comparative negligence. Such a defense promotes the goals of comparative negligence. The courts should recognize the fact that comparative negligence evolved to obviate the injustice of total recovery preclusion predicated on minor unreasonable conduct of an injured party. Comparative negligence is a means to properly evaluate the role of such conduct. This is so whether that conduct contributed to an accident or contributed to an injury. Whether viewed as part of assumption of the risk, contributory negligence, mitigation of damages, or an aspect of vehicle design, the principles of comparative negligence apply with equal force. (35) Comparative negligence principles and evidence of seat belt non-use are completely compatible. To reject such compatibility on the basis of semantics or technical application of outmoded legal doctrine is to distort the beneficial effects of the doctrine. THE MORE TRADITIONAL APPROACHES- As a norm, courts have been reluctant to permit the use of evidence relating to seat belts under traditional legal doctrine. Semantics and technical reasoning have led to decisions which are not consistent with the policy considerations of promoting safety and reducing injury. A few englightened courts have applied traditional concepts in imaginative, innovative ways to promote public policy and yield just results. Some of these approaches are summarized below. ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK: MISUSE - Non-use of an available seat belt can be characterized as assumption of the risk of injury or as a misuse of the product. When characterized as a misuse it is appropriate to consider the misuse as a form of assumption. Unlike contributory negligence (a form of conduct not permitted into evidence as a defense to claims in strict liability) assumption of the risk is a conduct based defense traditionally applicable in strict liability actions. (36) Misuse and assumption can be a complete defense to a product liability claim. It is often more appropriate to permit these defenses under principles of comparative fault. By utilizing the comparative fault concept it is easier for the court and jury to focus on the issue of how non-use relates to injury causation. In states which do not recognize comparative fault, these defenses present an "all or nothing" situation.</page><page sequence="9">2.666 S. J. WERBER Assumption can be defined as the voluntary undertaking of a known risk of harm. To establish the defense requires proof that the plaintiff had knowledge of the injury reduction benefits of seat belt use. This knowledge can be established directly or through circumstantial evidence. A basic definition of a "known" risk of future injury is ... "recognition of a future danger with a substantial degree of foreseeability . "(37) Most persons recognize the potential of injury with a substantial degree of foreseeability despite any protestation that they did not really expect it to happen to them. Better reasoned decisions approach the question along these lines. (38) Nevertheless, various courts have rejected seat belt evidence when presented in an effort to establish assumption of the risk or misuse of the product. These courts are hesitant to permit a complete defense where the conduct involved did not cause the accident. Such courts also have considerable difficulty in casting non-use into the category of misuse. As the misuse defense cannot be asserted by a defendant to defeat a claim of crashworthiness, despite the negligence of the plaintiff in causing the accident, it is difficult for courts to find that an act which did not contribute to the accident was a misuse. For courts to permit the assumption-misuse defense they will have to be made aware that the seat belt evidence is directed toward injury, not accident, causation. This awareness is growing and it can be hoped that future decisions will more accurately reflect this fact. CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE - It is almost universally held that contributory negligence (unreasonable conduct by a plaintiff which contributed to the accident and was a proximate or concurring cause of the accident) is not a defense to a strict liability action. Exceptions to this view are limited to comparative fault states in which the legal variants of conduct based defenses have been merged. Taking into account the purposes of strict liability, it is not surprising that the environment created by the doctrine consistently precludes evidence of seat belt non-use as an aspect of contributory negligence. Courts have been unwilling to differentiate between accident causation and injury causation where such a distinction would permit a complete defense even though the conduct only bore upon a portion of the injuries. Without application of comparative principles no change can be expected. With their application, all forms of conduct based defense can logically be presented to the jury. The key is to convince the court that the characterization of the conduct is an irrelevant semantic-technical exercise. The relevant factor is that unreasonable conduct permitted avoidable injuries. If this point can be made clear, so that courts recognize that safety requires the active participation of manufacturer and consumer alike, the potential for admission of seat belt non-use evidence will increase. As long as conduct is viewed as contributory negligence barring all recovery, there is little likelihood of having a court accept such evidence. MITIGATION OF DAMAGES: AVOIDABLE CONSEQUENCES - Despite semantic and technical difficulties, a significant number of courts have permitted application of the seat belt defense although limiting its effect to the question of damages. This is an appropriate analysis by which the courts can 1. Permit recovery where injury is caused by a defect in the automobile; 2. Retain the judicially desired easing of plaintiff's burden of proof as to defect, thereby enhancing the likelihood of recovery; 3. Promote a just evaluation of the cause of injury as distinct from accident causation; and 4. Adjust recovery to reflect this evaluation. An increasing number of jurisdictions permit seat belt non-use evidence when that evidence establishes a causal connection between non-use and injury. Since non-use, in such cases, is a substantial factor contributing to the injury, it is appropriate for courts to admit the evidence. Once admitted, a straightforward jury instruction can be given directing the jury to determine the total amount of damages resulting from the accident and to specify what percentage of the harm was caused by failure to utilize the available seat belt. The difficulty with this remarkably simple approach is that the definitions of both avoidance of harm and mitigation of damages require that such conduct take place after the act which caused the accident. Traditional legal doctrine applies the concepts of avoidance and mitigation to post-negligence conduct. In the seat belt context, the non-use precedes the accident. One method to avoid this technical difficulty is to utlize Dean Prosser's approach of "damage reduction." This approach changes the name of the legal term applied to more accurately reflect the</page><page sequence="10">LEGAL EFFECTS OF SEAT BELT NON-USE 2.667 actual need and to more fully promote the goals of avoidance and mitigation concepts. Such a change in nomenclature is not needed if the courts will apply antecedent negligence of the plaintiff in cases where damage apportionment is possible. The propriety of damage apportionment for a plaintiff's antecedent negligence is traditionally recognized. (39) All that need be done is for the courts to recognize that this general, traditional principle can be properly applied regardless of plaintiff's underlying theory for imposition of liability. Since the damage question arises only after resolution of the liability issue, such a step can be taken consistent with all theories of recovery. Theories of law have been developed to permit recovery for enhanced injury caused by an automobile's design or manufacture. The commensurate duty upon a plaintiff is to take advantage of the design feature incorporated to prevent injury. This can be done by a simple act. It is far easier to use a seat belt than to design an effective seat belt restraint system. The nominal duty imposed upon a plaintiff supports admission of evidence directed to the harm caused by violation of this duty. To the extent that injury enhancement is avoidable, evidence germane to the enhancement- prevention scale is relevant. Manufacturers must prevent injury to an automobile occupant by designing a vehicle which does not present an unreasonable risk of harm during an accident. Similarly, the occupant must be obliged to exercise reasonable care to avoid the consequences of an accident. As noted in Caizzo v. Volkswagenwerk, A. G. , "The failure to use the seat belts was properly considered in mitigation of the damages... on the familiar principle that a tortfeasor is liable for the proximate but not for the avoidable consequences of his tort." (40) In this way the court cut through all semantic and technical difficulties to obtain a fair result consistent with established law. Such a procedure should be followed uniformly. CONCLUSION Legislation can be enacted mandating seat belt use. It can provide for reduction of damages for injuries causally connected to non-use. Legislation precluding such a result should be repealed. Until the legislative gap is properly filled, the courts, by proper application of the doctrines of (1) mitigation of damages, (2) avoidable consequences, and (3) comparative fault principles, can and should permit damage reduction. Such steps will increase the use of seat belts. Increased use will significantly reduce the injuries and deaths presently associated with automobile use. FOOTNOTES 1.
