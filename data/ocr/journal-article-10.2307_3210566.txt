CAin Ghazal Excavations 1996 In the 1996 season, CAin Ghazal's East Field, a ca. six-acre exten- sion across the Zarqa River from the main site, yielded dramatic evidence of some of the earliest known temples in the world. Architectural techniques, including the use of dressed stones and oblique-angle corners, show that one of the temples is LPPNB in date (7,500-7,000 BCE, calibrated). Located high up the slope near the center of the East Field, the building measures 4 m N-S and minimally 5 m E-W, although the western part was destroyed by erosion. The structure consisted of a single room with a dirt floor; both features were very uncharacteristic of the LPPNB. A N-S line of three "standing stones" stood at the center (although the center stone had fallen down). At the southern end of this group sat a floor- level platform. It was enclosed by two long limestone blocks and some irregular limestone slabs between which lay a 3-cm layer of clay that had been burned to the color and texture of fired pot- tery. A roughly square hearth (ca. 50 cm on a side) nestled in the floor between the standing stones and the eastern wall. Made of lime plaster and painted red, the hearth was surrounded by seven small, flat limestone slabs. An orthostat of brilliant white lime- stone-ca. 80 cm high and 40 cm thick-was erected as part of the eastern wall. A small knob which lends an anthropomorphic character to the object, projected from the top of this large stone. The second temple is situated about 100 m to the south and far down the hillside. The building once had two rooms, but ero- sion has destroyed much of the western one. The well-preserved eastern room is 6.5 m long (N-S) x 3.5 m wide (E-W); the eastern wall still stands about 1.8 m high. The floor of the east room is made of a yellowish clay obtained when the builders excavated a storage room outside the building; the clay was not used for the floor of the western room. Against the center of the east wall is an altar (1.5 x 0.5 m) of thick limestone slabs that rest on three pairs of upright supports ca. 60 cm high. In front is a hearth of unpainted lime plas- ter surrounded by seven limestone slabs. The doorway in the western wall has a narrow screen wall to the south that leads into the western room for about 50 cm before making a right-angle turn towards the north, effectively shielding the hearth and altar in the eastern "holy of holies" from the view of anyone outside. Based on the use of undressed field stones, this temple probably dates to the earliest part of the PPNC period (ca. 7,000-6,500 BCE, cal.). The temples offer a new dimension of religion in the Neolithic Levant. Notably, neither temple indicates any association with the ancestor cult, which appears to have decreased in importance by the end of the seventh millennium.
