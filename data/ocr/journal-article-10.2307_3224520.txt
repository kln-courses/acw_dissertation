<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 321 also focussing attention on the most significant gaps and stimulating new re- searches to be undertaken in such areas. No parasitologist can afford to be without this work, and many other biologists would also benefit from the information conveniently available only in it.-J.O.C. Biodeterioration of Materials, Microbiological and Allied Aspects edited by A. Harry Walters and John J. Elphick. Elsevier, Amsterdam, London, New York, 1969, x + 740 pp., illus., $39. This weighty volume represents a compilation of the papers presented at the 1st International Biodeterioration Symposium held in September 1968 in Southampton, England. A majority of the participants were scientists from Great Britain; their contributions have been published under some 12 headings or "parts" of the book. In order to insure rapid appearance, no overall summaries, addenda, or indexes could be incorporated in the volume. Each of the articles (and there are over 65 separate papers), however, contains its own bibliography. Biodeterioration, defined properly, covers a very wide field of study, extending well beyond the popular concepts of "rotting" or "mildewing." Hardly any material exists which is not subject to either full or partial breakdown caused by vital activities of some organism, a destruction which is undesirable from man's point of view. Thus we have an applied science dependent, naturally, on dis- coveries made primarily through basic research approaches. The book, covering topics ranging from microbiological deterioration of ma- terials in deep mines to marine boring and fouling organisms and from fungal contamination of Florentine masterpieces to a new look at moldy cocoa, is a valuable collection of up-to-date papers in a relatively new field of science and will certainly represent an important addition to the library of biologists interested in any of the vast number of aspects of biodeterioration.-J.O.C. Big Fleas Have Little Fleas or Who's Who Among the Protozoa by Robert Hegner. Dover Publications, New York, 1968, viii + 285 pp., 127 figs., $2. Some 30 years ago Williams and Wilkins published the original edition of this remarkable little volume, but the time was not right: War followed Depres- sion, and Dr. Hegner passed away (in 1943); and so there are few biologists, even protozoologists, who today possess a copy of the work as it was first printed. Thus I'm certain that this reviewer's delight over the Dover paperback publication will be shared by many; it is a pleasure to call the reader's attention to new availability of the book-and at a price many times less than one must pay today for most volumes of no greater size. It should be stressed that text, figures (marginal and otherwise), even appendices, are identical with the original; the only addition is a brief and kindly introduction by Dr. Reginald D. Manwell, a now retired protozoologist who was one of Dr. Hegner's most devoted, and most illustrious, students. Big Fleas Have Little Fleas is hardly a textbook of protozoology, but it should be taken seriously even if the bulk of the figures are (deliberately) humorous sketches with highly anthropomorphic overtones. Much good infor- mation is presented in a very palatable way. Dr. Hegner's own deep interest in parasitic protozoa shows through, of course, but it is fashionable, especially today, to emphasize one's own specialties in a book which could not possibly cover all topics equally adequately. Every student of protozoologv and parasitology, not to mention those of many other "ologies," should have his own copy of this light-hearted Who's Who, a work which will always remain charming and unique.-J.O.C.</page></plain_text>
