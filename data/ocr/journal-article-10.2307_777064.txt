<plain_text><page sequence="1">Queen Victoria for Twenty-Five Pounds: The Iconography of a Breasted Drum from Southern Ghana By Doran H. Ross Highly decorated drums with from one to eight disembodied female breasts are commonly found as the focal instruments in secular musical ensem- bles or "popular bands" of the Akan peoples of southern Ghana.' In most cases the barrel-shaped body of the drums serves as a torso for the breasts; but in rare instances the depiction of a woman is considerably more naturalis- tic, with a fully realized female carved in relief on the surface of the drum (Fig. 1). In either case most of these drums are also elaborately ornamented with a rich variety of relief images representing the material culture and natural envi- ronment of the Akan. At first glimpse the presentation may appear to Western eyes as somewhat random, even capri- cious. Nevertheless, as is typical of most Akan arts, the images generally depict traditional motifs with substantial meaning drawn from Akan oral litera- ture. Owing to the massing of imagery these drums are among the most sym- bolically sophisticated and telling ob- jects in the whole corpus of African art. J.H.K. Nketia was the first to describe in detail the structure and func- tion of these instrumental, singing, and dancing groups and was also the first to use the expression "popular band" in relation to them.2 Each performance company is identified with a distinctive type of dance and music, and, much like the popular bands of the Western world, these groups rise and fall in fashion. Some are short-lived, lasting no more than a few years. Others are more enduring, with some documented groups Fig. 1 Fante drum, c. 1920, wood, fiber, leather, pigment, h. 371/4".

The bands perform on a wide variety of occasions, including the naming of a baby, puberty celebrations, weddings, the installation of chiefs, funerals, and a host of indigenous, Christian, and national festivals. Despite the implica- tions of the word "popular," it should be emphasized that these bands are a long- established traditional part of Akan cul- ture. Yet, it is a tradition that savors change and innovation, and the master drums frequently feature a rich blend of the old and the new. The anthropomorphic conception of the drum extends well beyond the depic- tion of female breasts. About one out of three examples has a heart in a more or less anatomically correct position be- tween the breasts. A number of drums have human legs (Fig. 2), and others have arms and hands carved in relief. The oldest documented piece dates from before 1890 and features a standing female supporting the drum itself, which has no representational relief but is ornamented with six sculpted drum pegs (Fig. 3).3 Other drums are carved on the backs of animals, of which elephants and lions are the most common (Fig. 4). In rare cases the drums are mounted on separately carved stands, again some- times in the shape of animals (Fig. 5). A recent acquisition of the UCLA Museum of Cultural History represents this genre at its best (see Figs. I and 12). It is one of three known drums by the same carver with a similar composi- tion (Figs. 6 and 7). The exact prove- nance and date of the instruments are unknown, but they can be confidently attributed to the Fante peoples of coast- al Ghana (see map)-an ex-British col- ony formerly called the Gold Coast- and were probably carved during the third decade of this century.4 The domi- nant motif on the UCLA drum is a regal 114 Art Journat</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 2 Fante drum, c. 1940, wood, pigment.

She wears a Euro- pean style crown, a blouse and skirt with scalloped hemlines, and laced shoes with prominent heels. Her jewelry consists of a wristwatch, bracelet, heart-shaped earrings, and a necklace with a cross. Centered on her blouse is a clock and emblazoned on the skirt is "Price ?25," a boastful reference to the cost of the drum. Although the dress of the queen most likely dates to the 1920s, the only British female monarch that it could represent is Queen Victoria (R. 1837- 1901), since she was succeeded by males until Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1952.5 That the drum postdates the death of Queen Victoria by some twenty years reflects not only her lasting role in the popular culture of the colony but also her status as a symbol of political authority. Printed images of Victoria were among the most widely available on the coast of Ghana, and many certainly lingered long after her death. Even in the mid nineteenth century, images of British royalty were popular. Brodie Cruickshank, who lived in the Gold Coast for more than eighteen years from 1834, wrote: Africans are exceedingly fond of pictures in their rooms, and to gratify this taste press anything into their service that comes readi- est to hand. Napoleon in his cocked hat, in gaudy colours or simple woodcut, on foot and on horseback, and George IV in his coronation robes, may be seen dis- puting for space with Punch and his dog Toby, as they appear in the frontispiece of his publication, with the urns, tea and coffee-pots of Cox, Savory, and Company, as seen in their advertisements, or with the royal arms of England flaming in all the glory of an announcement of one of her Majesty's tradesmen.6 Printed materials not only helped to perpetuate the image of Queen Victoria but also were undoubtedly the source for her updated dress. The celebration of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887 and Diamond Jubilee in 1897 led to a flood of images throughout the British Empire, with official portrait photographs widely cir- culated (Fig. 8). Robert Farris Thomp- son has discussed the impact of one such photograph on Yoruba sculpture of southwest Nigeria, another former Brit- ish colony (Fig. 9).7 According to Thompson, the influence of these por- traits lingered until World War II. That the artist of the UCLA Akan drum was also familiar with this or related photo- graphs or engravings is suggested by the Fig. 4 Osei Bonsu, Asante drum, c. 1935, wood, fiber, leather, pigment, h. 423/4".

Comparable crosses can also be seen on the Yoruba sculpture Thompson analyzes. In each case they apparently originate with the star of the Order of the Garter, a medal with the image of a cross frequently worn by Victoria in formal portraits. It is tempting to specu- late that the massive breasts on the UCLA drum were also influenced by the appearance of Victoria in photo- graphs, but large breasts are a common feature on many of these drums. On the UCLA drum Victoria towers over a much smaller depiction of an Akan chief seated on a stool under an umbrella to her left (see Figs. 1 and 12). The chief wears a crown identical with that of the Queen, but is dressed in a traditional kente cloth. Each royal fig- ure has its own entourage. That of the Queen takes the form of the British Colonial Native Authority Police wear- ing their characteristic red fezzes. Five of these figures surround the tapering Fig. 6 Fante drum, c. 1920, wood, fiber, leather, pigment, h. 40". Collection Clayre and Jay Haft. Fig. 7 Detail of Fante drum, c. 1920. Present location unknown. top of the drum, each carrying a dif- ferent attribute of colonial authority- bugle, sword, musket, handcuffs, and key. A sixth figure, holding the Union Jack, appears below the Queen on the front of the drum. The chief's supporters consist of traditional court officials: umbrella carrier, sword bearer, a lin- guist carrying his staff of office, a horn blower, and a stool carrier.8 Each is wearing shirt and shorts rather than indigenous dress. One of the most curious features of this drum is the hierarchical relation- ship of the British Queen and the Akan chief, whose size reflects his subservient role in the colonial administration of the former Gold Coast.9 But the question remains, Why would a secular drum- ming group organized principally for entertainment feature a British mon- arch at the expense of an indigenous ruler? In traditional, pre-Colonial Akan society, drumming was strictly regu- lated by the local town or village chief or by the paramount chief of the state. With the advent of the British adminis- tration the power of the chiefs dimin- ished, and independently organized pop- ular bands flourished during the first half of this century. In communities with two or more bands intense rivalries between the groups often led to con- flicts. Although the competition be- tween bands stimulated the increased artistic elaboration of the drum, it also promoted confrontations, which were aggravated by the drinking and revelry that generally accompanied perfor- mances. Consequently, the British found it necessary to regulate perfor- mances and began requiring permits and a fairly substantial bond to ensure orderly displays. The presence of Queen Victoria on this particular drum proba- bly reflects the shift in power from local chiefs to the British and affirms the band's adherence to, if not respect for, colonial authority.10 Another factor that may account for the discrepant sizes of the Queen and the chief is the institution of the "puppet chief." In many communities the British bypassed traditional procedures and appointed a chief to facilitate colonial rule. Most of these chiefs lacked the respect of their subjects, and the subser- vient chief on this drum may be an example of this situation. Aside from the apparent political statement made by the dominant Queen Victoria figure, there is a com- pelling precedent for prominent female imagery on the drums of Akan popular bands. As the musical and visual focal point of the group, the drum is the only instrument corporately owned. Band members frequently refer to the master drum as "the mother of the group." Large female breasts are a recurring feature, and the nurturing imagery is multiplied on those drums with four, six, and eight breasts (Fig. 10). Some drums without breasts have independently carved nursing females attached to their fronts; and other drums, both with and without breasts, have female figures supporting the body of the drum (Fig. 11). The importance of this feminine iden- tification is emphasized in this last example. The "breast-headed warriors" on the front are an unusual, perhaps unique, motif in the history of world art. This image is comprehensible only when it is realized that the breasts were inde- Fig. 8 Queen Victoria, 1887. (Frontispiece from Victoria: Her Life and Reign, ed. Richard T. Lancefield and H. J. P. Good, Toronto, 1901.) 116 Art Journal</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 9 Yoruba sculpture of Queen Victoria, after 1887, wood, h. 241/4". Los Angeles, UCLA Museum of Cultural History, Gift of the Wellcome Trust. pendently carved and added as an after- thought, but before the drum was used for long, since patterns of wear on the breasts and on the body of the drum are identical. It seems that the omission of the breasts was an oversight by the carver, which was later corrected at the expense of the relief figures. Significantly, no male drums of this type are known, although occasionally a male joins the female as a pair of sup- port figures for drums. That the Akan are a matrilineal society is probably an important factor. Regardless, the image of Queen Victoria as a symbol of benev- olence and sustenance was certainly fos- tered by the colonial government on the Gold Coast, and its use in this drum tradition was consistent with indigenous conceptions of the drum. The structure flying the British Union Jack on the UCLA drum is another symbol of British power on the Gold Coast (see Fig. 12). Without the flag, the building would appear to represent a Christian church, but these churches rarely flew flags from their towers. It is possible that the image is a loose inter- pretation of one of the forts built along the coast by various European powers from 1481 on through the early nine- teenth century. These forts were all eventually taken over by the British, who used them to house colonial garri- sons and as prisons. The large fort at Elmina still has a tower and roof finials similar to the representation on the drum. Although this may suggest a spe- cific provenance for the drum, it is more likely that the structure is intended as a general reference to all such forts. According to some Akan informants the functional clocks actually embedded in the bodies of drums or those carved in relief as seen on the blouse of Victoria also have an architectural referent. Elders of several drumming groups com- pared these to the clocks found on church towers in many towns of south- ern Ghana. The clock thus serves as a means of aggrandizing the importance of the master drum. All three clocks on drums by the carver of the UCLA piece are fixed at 1:35, which must have had some personal significance to the carver, since it is highly unlikely that three different patrons would request the same time. More subtle evidence of the British presence on the Gold Coast can be seen elsewhere on the UCLA drum (see Fig. 12). A teapot and a kerosene lamp may be two of the more ubiquitous imports. The scissors, razor, mirror, and comb form a cluster of motifs that deal with good grooming. As party to the competi- tion between groups, the owners of this drum are probably boasting that their dress and appearance are better than that of their rivals. A second cluster of Western artifacts consists of the carpen- ter's plane, ax, nail-pulling tongs, saw, knife, and chisel (the last seen on the far left of the drawing). These wood-work- ing tools may be a reference to the principal occupation of the band's male members, although these motifs are so common on drums that they may simply be images favored by drum carvers whose main vocations were usually car- pentry. Another European-introduced tool is isolated between the stool-carrier and the linguist with his staff. Although echoing the shape of the linguist staff, it is actually a pole with a crook-shaped blade on the end used to cut cocoa from trees. Cocoa was introduced in the late nineteenth century by the British as a cash crop, and eventually Ghana became the world's largest producer. Thus this tool stands for the importance of cocoa in the local economy. All the depicted artifacts are emblematic rather than deeply symbolic. Collectively they make a statement that the group is up-to-date and part of the modern world as the Akan understand it. Most of the remaining motifs are Fig. 10 Fante drum, c. 1940, wood, fiber, leather, pigment, h. 451/2". Collection Iris and Sherwin Memel.

In almost every case the animal is a capsule representation of a conventionalized verbal saying that me- taphorically elucidates basic tenets of Akan life and culture. These sayings may take varied forms ranging from folktales, proverbs, and riddles to jokes, boasts, and insults. The consistent pair- ing of conventionalized sayings with visual images has been referred to as the "verbal-visual nexus of Akan art."1' This marriage of word and image con- veys the meaning of these arts. Themati- cally they may focus on a range of social, political, economic, or religious issues. Most of these verbal messages are metaphors for situations far re- moved from the entertainment context of the popular bands and their drums, which emphasizes that there is little form-function relationship in drum mo- tifs (with a few significant exceptions). Thus the metaphorical subject matter of drum relief carving is multireferential and widely applicable to many contexts in Akan culture. T he identification of written texts as the source for the imagery of Medi- eval, Renaissance, and Baroque art has been the foundation of many iconogra- phical studies in Western art history. For the Akan the identification must be made with their oral literature. E. H. Gombrich in the "Introduction" to his Symbolic Images notes that "Images apparently occupy a curious position somewhere between the statements of language, which are intended to convey a meaning, and the things of nature to which we can only give a meaning."12 Akan iconography occupies a position closer to the former, although it cer- tainly must have originated in the latter. Of the "things of nature," the zoologi- cal environment provides the source of much Akan representational imagery. At least twenty-five different species are depicted on the drum. Animal identifi- cation in Akan art, however, is often problematic. Recognition is frequently based on a single salient trait such as the pronounced bump (carapace) on the head and beak of a bird that identifies it as a hornbill or the spots on a feline that identify it as a leopard. In other instances the identification is revealed only by other elements in the composition. The distinction between a crocodile and a lizard in Akan art is frequently impossible to make unless there is either considerable detail or some associated animal or artifact that aids identification. The amphibian with a fish in its mouth must inevitably repre- sent a crocodile. A virtually identical amphibian on the side of a clay pot has to depict a lizard. In the case of an isolated animal there are often multiple sayings that could be applied to the image. Without knowing the intent of the artist or the demands of the patron, identifying the "correct" expression is difficult. Sometimes the context of the object type, in this case the master drum of a popular band, will aid identification. At the same time, the intent of the artist or patron may be deliberately ambiguous, leaving the interpretation up to the viewer. As with Western art, such multivalent symbol- ism adds to the appeal and fascination of the image itself. As an initial example, the hornbill bird in the grasp of a python on the far left of the drawing illustrates a fairly lengthy folktale.'3 The story begins with the snake lending money to the bird. Having the power of flight, the hornbill decides not to repay the loan, since the python is bound to the earth. But the python possesses one trait of value in this situation-patience. Eventually a drought comes to the area and one water hole after another dries up. Finally only one water hole is left, and the hornbill has no choice but to land, whereupon he is captured by the python. This image is common in Akan art, and whenever it is seen the viewer understands that the moral of the tale is that patience triumphs. A second very common image in Akan art represents two crocodiles with separate heads, tails, and legs, but a common body. On this drum each head holds one end of a snake in its mouth. The motif is undoubtedly based on the observed behavior of two or more croc- odiles fighting over a common prey. The motif represents two different and con- flicting proverbs. The one most fre- quently cited can be translated as, "bel- lies mixed, crocodiles mixed say: 'let a bit wash down your throat, let a bit wash down my throat, and all will meet in one stomach.' ""14 Since there are two mouths but only one stomach, this prov- erb is often cited in family disputes where self-interests should be sacrificed for the common good. This message of cooperation is countered by an alterna- tive saying, which emphasizes that "The enjoyment of food involves not only the stomach but the palate as well." Paradoxical sayings and situations are an important component in Akan oral literature and thus equally impor- tant in the visual arts. That every argu- ment has two points of view and indeed many shades of interpretation in between is clearly understood by the Akan. Such quandaries are simulta- neously frustrating and amusing. When conflicting interpretations are presented by Akan informants, they are frequently accompanied by a shrug and a laugh. Life is often perplexing, and Akan art reflects that. A second set of contradictory prov- erbs is expressed by two separate and highly conventionalized images. The bird with its head facing directly to its rear invariably depicts the saying, "Pick 118Art Journal</page><page sequence="6">it up if it falls behind." The basic idea is that mistakes can be corrected and that one can learn from the past. The long- horned antelope depicts the maxim, "'Had I known,' is always late." This is the rough equivalent of the Western lament, "If I had only known," suggest- ing in part the futility of hindsight. The positioning of the two images on the drum and their relative scale do not give one motif (or point of view) more weight than the other. Thus, the paradox is strengthened by the comparable treat- ment of the two images. The chameleon (on the bottom right of the drawing) presents another exam- ple of paradox in Akan art. Although members of popular bands take great pride in their appearance, often spend- ing considerable sums of money to buy special identifying dress, the conven- tionalized proverb associated with the chameleon warns that appearances can be deceiving: "Although the chameleon can change its clothes, it cannot change its soul." This symbolically balances the implements of good grooming displayed above it. Another motif on the drum depicts contrasting but not opposing values. The star and crescent moon typically repre- sent the expression: "Although the moon is brightest, the star is more con- stant." Here again this is not merely an observation of natural phenomena but rather a statement that can be metapho- rically applied to standards of dress, psychological temperament, or eco- nomic conditions, among others. The Akan are saying they value permanence over changing fortune, reliability over what is flashy but undependable."5 The choice between competing self- interests is a significant theme in many Akan proverbial images. The "correct" decision is usually emphasized in the maxim. The long-necked bird typically represents the saying, "Even if a bird has a long neck, he uses it to eat on his side of the river and not on the other." This expression deals with territorial prerogatives and warns against imping- ing on another's domain. Land rights, of course, are a major economic and political concern in Akan life. Another major focus is reverence for the ancestors. Although the frog seems an unlikely candidate for such a theme, the most common maxim associated with the frog is, "The length of a frog can only be determined after its death." The frog's length is a metaphor for the achievements of an individual, which are often fully appreciated only after death. Other relatively innocuous creatures may exemplify lofty themes in the Akan world view. Four different arthropods are carved on the drum: millipede, but- terfly, scorpion, and tsetse fly. The milli- pede, unlike the poisonous centipede, is viewed favorably by the Akan, who are aware of its tendency to curl into a circle upon death. The Akan say of the image, "When the millipede dies, it leaves a reminder." Regardless of how insignifi- cant the millipede may seem, it nev- ertheless leaves evidence of its former existence for at least one person to see. The hope that some evidence of one's life may persist after one's death is probably universal. That the Akan have chosen such a seemingly trivial organism to express this theme makes the message all the more poignant. The understate- ment in effect monumentalizes the importance of making a contribution with one's life. The principal saying associated with the butterfly is based on the observation that the insect is never found drinking water and yet is attracted to palm wine. It prompts the query, "If the butterfly does not like to drink, why is it always found on the path to palm wine?" Although it is actually sugar that attracts the butterfly, the Akan use the insect in their oral literature as a com- parison to a person who denies that he drinks, but is always found in bars. In this instance, fun is obviously being made of a person who says one thing and does another. Scorpions in Akan folklore are usually associated with their sting. When depicted by itself, the insect is potentially the subject of many prov- erbs. One of the most common is, "If the scorpion stings you mercilessly, then you have to kill it mercilessly." This is the rough equivalent of "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." Another frequently cited maxim is, "When the scorpion bites a good mother's child, the pain lasts until the hearth grows cold."16 Ide- ally, in an Akan household the hearth never grows cold, and a continuously burning hearth was a traditional meta- phor for a successfully functioning fami- ly. The proverb thus refers not only to the potent sting of the scorpion but also to the quality of familial care. The tsetse is often depicted in Akan art on the back of a tortoise. Here it is seen by itself, but the presence of the tortoise is probably implied since the following saying is frequently cited for the isolated fly: "When the tsetse fly lands on the back of the tortoise, it gets nothing [i.e., no blood]." In this instance the insect is an obvious symbol of folly. This proverb may be cited in daily speech to make an example of any fool- ish behavior. At least two motifs on the drum deal with promoting the stature of this group over other bands. The leopard carrying a pot of palm wine on its head illustrates the saying, "Only the lion can drink from the palm-wine pot of the leopard." While this asserts the predatory power of both the great cats, it gives the edge to the lion.17 This image is generally used to assert the power of one group over another. Reflecting the rivalries be- tween groups, the owners of this drum identify with the lion (depicted else- where on the drum) and assign the leop- ard to their competitors. Another boast is presented by the cock holding the key in its beak, depict- ing the declaration, "We control the cock and the key." Since the cock announces the dawn, the band is pro- claiming that it controls the beginning of the day. Likewise a key or bunches of keys have been a symbol of power and control since the introduction of mana- cles to southern Ghana by Europeans towards the end of the fifteenth century. The parrot will provide a final exam- ple of the verbal-visual nexus in Akan art. Of this bird the Akan say, "Even though the parrot has not been to Brit- ain, it nevertheless speaks English." This extols the virtue of using one's innate wisdom in unfamiliar circum- stances. Indeed, intelligent behavior may be seen as the basis for many of the other sayings cited above. The cultured Akan is, of course, well versed in indige- nous oral literature and knows the inher- ent wisdom of much of what is repre- sented in the art. All the sayings cited above can be confidently attributed to their corre- sponding images, although not all the images are necessarily restricted to these sayings. Two other images not addressed-the two snails on a cluster of eggs (?) and the tortoise holding a knife and broom-undoubtedly refer to spe- cific sayings, but these have yet to be documented. The remaining animals on the drum include a pangolin, hedgehog, goat, crab, and several nondescript birds. Each of these could be associated with several proverbs. It is likely that no fixed meaning was intended. Individual informants, when interviewed in a group, often take obvious delight in cit- ing alternative interpretations for a given motif. Such "multivocal" inter- pretations of Akan iconography can extend artistic meaning to diverse realms of Akan thought in much the same way that a highly conventionalized proverb-image can be metaphorically applied to widely diverse situations. As should be evident from the above, each image and its corresponding saying can stand by itself. There is no narrative connection among the images, nor was Summer 1988 119</page><page sequence="7">one originally intended. Nevertheless, a composite view emerges of the Akan system of values. As the "vocabulary" of Akan art is further expanded, we shall gain additional insight into this world view. Given that drum imagery is drawn from the larger motif pool of Akan art, which numbers well over a thousand different documented images, the ques- tion remains: Who determines the motifs, the artist, or the patron? In a study of eleven drums by the Asante carver Osei Bonsu it was clear from the large number of motifs repeated from drum to drum that the artist was respon- sible for selecting the majority of the images.'8 Although full views of the other two drums by the carver of the UCLA piece were not available, it is nevertheless apparent that many motifs are repeated on all three drums. A simi- lar situation exists across drums by other carvers in my archive of 104 drums. It would seem that patron input was minimal or nonexistant, and that artists frequently repeated their favorite motifs. Many of the same images found on the UCLA drum are featured in other Akan art forms with varying frequency. A major issue in the study of Akan iconography is how a given motif specif- ically relates to the function and context of the object on which it is depicted. When there is only one image at a time associated with an artifact the relation- ship is generally clear and focused. The drums of popular bands, however, pre- sent a compendium of motifs, some with conflicting meanings that extend well beyond the musical entertainment role of the groups themselves. Yet inasmuch as the bands are social entities that operate within the rules of Akan society, the multiple messages on the drum are broadly applicable to all the group mem- bers. Themes emphasizing patience, cooperation, and wisdom, among others, present a synthesis of the Akan ethical view. As represented on this drum, Akan art ultimately has a humanistic orienta- tion. Although observable animal be- havior may have initially stimulated the creation of a new saying or alternatively suggested the association with a pre- existing maxim, meaning rests with the metaphorical extensions of oral litera- ture. Akan art is ultimately about people not animals. It would be wrong to say that the art of the Akan is more intellectual than most other African art, since the art of most of the continent has very deep and sophisticated philosophical underpin- nings. Nevertheless, since Akan imag- ery metaphorically focuses on often mundane situations directly applicable to daily life, the art seems more ap- proachable to the Western intellect. Its appeal rests with its universal humanis- tic content. This content, however, can be deciphered only by probing the Akan intellect and understanding its cultural context.

Although not Akan speak- ers, both the Ga and their Ewe neighbors have borrowed the tradition of decorated drums from the Akan. 4 Many drums of this type have been carelessly identified with the Asante, the best known and most populous of the Akan speakers. In fact, all Akan groups use these drums. That the three drums by the carver of the UCLA example are not Asante is further evidenced by the presence of the domestic cat and the owl on the two drums in private collections. Both of these motifs are avoided by the Asante, who view the animals in a negative light. The Fante, how- ever, do not share these views, and both animals are frequently found in their art. 5 The author would like to thank Edward Maed- er, Curator of Costumes, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Patricia Altman, Curator of Textiles and Folkart, UCLA Museum of Cultural History, for dating the dress of the Queen Victoria figure. 6 Brodie Cruickshank, Eighteen Years on the Gold Coast of Africa, London, 1853, II, pp. 291-92. 7 Robert Farris Thompson, Black Gods and Kings, exh. cat., Los Angeles, 1971, p. 17/13. 8 The finials depicting roosters on the umbrella and linguist staff provide some evidence for identifying the specific Fante chief repre- sented. Unfortunately, although the motif nar- rows the number of possibilities, the cock is one of the more common royal symbols and is used in the regalia of several Fante paramount chiefs. 9 That the chief is seated to the left of the Queen rather than to her right might further demean the status of the chief, since the Akan share the Western European view concerning the relative (Figs. 6 and 7), where he is to the left on one, but to the right on the other. 10 A similar message is conveyed by an abbre- viated version of the British royal arms with a unicorn and lion flanking a crown displayed on many drums of Akan popular bands (Fig. 4).
