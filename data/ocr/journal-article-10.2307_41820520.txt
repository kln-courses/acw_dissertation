<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews THE NEW HISTORY OF SCIENCE The Emergence of Ornithology as a Scientific Discipline 1760-1850, by Paul Lawrence Färber (Dordrecht, Holland, Boston and London: D. Reidel, 1 982), xiii + 191 pp., Dfl. 90-00. Time was when you could write a book called a history of chemistry, or biology or geology, and no one thought the worse of you for that. This all changed in the methodologically holier-than-thou atmosphere of the emergent academic history of science in the 1960s, when telling such stories of progress - "tunnel histories"- fell into disrepute, condemned for being anachronistic and "Whiggish", for deploying hindsight, and for their covertly triumphalist teleology. We all needed greater historiographical rigour. We had to be converted to what has been felicitously called "Baptist history"- total immersion in the ideas or individuals we were studying. Moreover, old "history as evolutionary progress" was dealt a further blow by the Kuhnian stress on discontinuities - "paradigm switches" - and, in turn, Foucault and the structuralists made the very idea of tracing successive "influences" which supposedly contributed to edifices of knowledge seem crass and vulgar. Yet, expel history as directional change through the door, and- like it or not- it comes back in again through the window. The guise which this is currently taking in the history of science is "discipline history". Historians no longer naively chart the heroic advance of truth via successive "breakthroughs"; this is a question-begging exercise unless we have some causal sociology of scientific knowledge. Instead they pose the more subtle epistemological and social question: how do "disciplines" emerge? What does it mean to say that a science has come into being, has come of age, evolved, emerged, been born, or that a new "epistemological space" has been opened up or colonised? This is precisely Paul Lawrence Farber's goal in his study of the "emergence" of ornithology as a scientific discipline out of the traditional matrix of general natural history. Farber's book is organised round a sequence of steps and stages, starting from the mid-eighteenth century. This was an important juncture, for though Linnaeus relatively ignored birds (and his own classification was weak and uninfluential), their investigation was stimulated by the skilful attentions devoted to them by Buffon, the populariser of science for the salon in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux , and the more sophisticated Jacques Brisson's Ornithologie (1760), which catalogued 1,500 species and varieties. From then on, several currents moved the study forward. Colonial expansion, the voyageur-naturalistes , and, at home, gentlemen and parsons such as George Montague and Gilbert White all multiplied empirical knowledge of more and more species by leaps and bounds. Bird illustrations reached a peak in the artistry of Thomas Bewick and James Audubon, while the early nineteenth century saw the high summer of private collectors - hoarding eggs, skins and increasingly skeletons - though a point was eventually reached when collections became so dropsical that only the state could conserve them adequately in institutions such as the Paris Muséum d'histoire naturelle. All this encouraged a shift from pride in showy "bags" and a mere "collection-catalogue" type of natural history towards self-consciously "scientific" approaches, not least with attempts in the early nineteenth century to find a "natural" classification, for example, in the comparative anatomy traditions of Cuvier and of Naturphilosophie . With the founding of specialist publications, such as the Zoological Journal (1 824), networks of communi- cation and co-operation were reinforced, and the independence of ornithology from</page><page sequence="2">The New History of Science 145 general natural history was signalled at much the same time by the establishment of narrowly zoological and later ornithological societies. By about the mid-nineteenth century, ornithology had emerged as a discipline, Färber concludes. Throughout Europe specialists were for the first time talking to specialists, about birds seen no longer primarily through aesthetic or anthropomorphic eyes, but as objects of scientific inquiry. Farber's story is lucidly told, its general outlines are convincing and his range is pleasingly international. Moreover, he scores some palpable hits against currently fashionable accounts of scientific growth. He shows that explanations of the maturation of natural history in terms of "professionalisation" beg all the questions, because they arbitrarily label the terminus ad quem "professional science". He also argues that criteria taken from the physical sciences such as trends towards abstraction, theory and quantification, are hardly applicable. And he rightly claims that accounts such as Foucaulťs and Wolf Lepennies' which envisage a shift around 1800 from "natural history" to "biology" quite miss the point. Nevertheless, the book remains somewhat thin fare; the text runs only to 150 small pages. Färber defines plausibly enough (p. 100) what he means by a "discipline", but he treats his definition as conclusive rather than as the starting point for inquiry - is it circular?- is it stating the obvious? Hence I find myself seeking both a more self-critical questioning of his model, and also a rigorous interrogation of it through a richer texture of empirical data. To the first point: no one will disagree when Färber shows that the study of birds grew in depth, scope and quantity during the century he has chosen. Färber believes that at some stage and fòr some reason quantitative change turned into qualita- tive - the discipline "emerged". But as his intransitive verb ("emerged") may indicate, exactly what precipitated or marked the change remains rather murky. Is it weight of numbers? Is it degree of institutionalisation, or informal organisation? Or is it rather an intellectual shift, the end of anthropomorphic vision, or the development of a classificatory springboard? Do we judge this essentially by the criteria of those ornithologists who did the work or by criteria we impose by hindsight? To be precise, why choose the decades 1 820-50 as crucial? For one might argue that, as far back as the publications of Willughby and Ray in the 1670s, the study of birds had become dispassionate, objective and linked to both a classification and to research drawing upon an informal network. Or one might claim - as perhaps David Allen does in his The Naturalist in Britain - that ornithology did not really arrive until later, with the mass study of bird behaviour such as migration, flocking, mating, etc. More needs to be said. For this, a thicker texture of information would have been welcome. Farber's broad brush paints the main contours, but blurs the details the sociologist or social historian craves to help him to make up his own mind. Färber notes, for example, the founding of societies and journals, but does not state their membership or circulation, or demonstrate their influence. Neither does he convey, as David Allen's book does so graphically, the role of individual personality - the charismatic popularisers who put the subject on the map, the obsessional classifiers who laid the foundations. Thus Färber mentions in passing the great importance of the dialectic between popularisation and specialisation, but does not fill it out with critical detail. The same lack is also felt in the intellectual dimension. How did contemporaries' conceptions of the scope of bird science change? What were their goals? Where did they locate the science in respect of general natural history and zoology? Were attitudes really "de-anthropomorphised"? (Keith Thomas's richly detailed new Man and the Natural World would argue: less than we usually think.) When, indeed, did the word "ornithology" itself become hegemonic? We expect to be told such things; we are not. The shift from old meliorist "tunnel history" to the more subtly oriented approach</page><page sequence="3">146 Book Reviews of investigating "disciplines" should be pure gain. It would be a pity if it also entailed a real loss of detail, without compensating rigour. Paul Färber has made a start, and for that we can be grateful, but much remains to be said on this subject.
