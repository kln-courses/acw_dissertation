KATZ The desire to know and the need to conceal coexist uneasily. The unknown and unseen arouse feelings of both intimacy and irascibility, just as, in Gaston Bachelard's words, "an object, a mere door, can give images of hesitation, temptation, desire, security, welcome, and respect."1 To one person, a closed door can signal welcome protection, to another, foreboding danger, and in reflective thinkers, qualms of doubt?a lady, a tiger, or both.2 Uncertainty may add to the allure of the hidden object and elevate its importance, as with a hidden jewel or treasure. Concealment may also lend validity, as in the hidden selves, revealed only behind closed doors, and thus more authentic than public personae. Meanings fluctuate, while mechanisms remain the same. The same door functions both as barrier and protector, guarding what is valuable as well as limiting access to it. In works of art that incorporate doors in their construction?whether chapels, tabernacles, pyxes, or triptychs? total access is considered imperative, as one cannot fully understand the work without considering its interior as well as its facade. Nevertheless, access is often deliberately restricted, imposing a dialectic of the seen and the unseen. The scholarly urge towards explication is at odds with the attempt to remain hidden and, not surprisingly, our impulse is to celebrate what has been uncovered rather than what remains concealed. This article explores elements of hiding and revelation at play in the Vierge ouvrante, a form of devotional sculpture whose exteriors resemble traditional cult figures of the Virgin and Child, yet are fashioned so as to open at the center, in the manner of a triptych (fig. 1). The sculpture consists of a Virgin whose body also serves as a set of doors, opening to a second set of pictorial motifs incorporated within the body cavity. Through a consideration of the interplay between outer forms and interior motifs, it addresses the Vierge ouvrante as a sculpture that by design remains half seen, half hidden, composed of two parts that exist concurrently but cannot be seen simultaneously. This article confronts the paradox of the Marian body, sealed by enduring virginity yet made accessible via a pair of doors, and the manner in which this influences a devotional encounter with an opening figure. To do so, it examines how the doorway, a longstanding Marian attribute, functions as the element that both conceals the sculpture's interior and makes possible its revelation. This article also brings a new approach to the study of Vierge ouvrante sculptures, departing from the concerns of previous authors, whose methodology emphasized formal analysis, identification of regional influences, and establishment of a chronology predicated on the assumption of coherent stylistic evolution and consistent iconography.3 Only recently have scholars begun to This article is drawn from my dissertation (in progress at Brown University), "Interior Motives: the Vierge otywante/Triptych Virgin in medieval and early modern Iberia/' where themes discussed here will be dealt with in greater detail.

In these divided bodies, meanings are multiplied, but do not resolve into straightforward depictions of Incarnation theology or exaltations of the Marian womb. Rather, 1 argue, tension arises from a virginal body whose visible exterior opens to reveal not its interior but a visualization of an invisible godhead situated where ordinarily the organs of procreation would reside. Through this disembodiment, the Holy Virgin is distanced from all that is carnal, and her body is aligned with the sacred and with the intangible soul. Vierges ouvrantes are uncommon today, and perhaps were in the Middle Ages as well, although their appeal seems extensive. At present, I know of seventy-two such sculptures?sixty from the thirteenth through seventeenth centuries, and twelve from the nineteenth century (replicas, forgeries, and homages)?of which forty-four have been catalogued and published.6 Although few in number, these works are widely dispersed across Europe, from Scandinavia north of the Arctic Circle to southern Portugal, and western Brittany east to the Polish-Lithuanian border (see Appendix, pp. 218-221). Carved primarily in French, German, and Spanish workshops, they range in date from the thirteenth through seventeenth centuries, with a revival in the nineteenth century, indicating that while the sculptural type never gained widespread popularity, neither was it confined to a narrow region or period. Although considered a medieval art form, their lifespan transcends this category, and many remain in devotional use today, often in remote areas where the wider art public has yet to come across them, as recent discoveries of unknown works preserved in central France, the Italian Alps, and the Peruvian Andes indicate.7 The English language has no word for these opening sculptures; instead, the French or German terms, Vierge Schewe (Berlin and Leipzig: Walter de Gruyter, 1934), pp. 168-169; Manuel Bartolome Trens i Ribas, Maria: Iconograffa de la Virgen en el Arte Espahol (Madrid: Editorial Plus Ultra, 1946), pp. 481-524; Alfred A.

It is this latter term that I prefer, because "Triptych Virgin" alludes to their fusion of a winged altarpiece and a cult image, and because in my mind these Virgins don't only open, but open and close, open and close, in cyclical fashion. Each sculptural unit consists of two distinct artistic programs, one revealed and one concealed, inviting an expansion of traditional notions of sculpture as solid, immutable forms. Access to the interior is achieved only by touching the sculptures, making the viewer's experience both haptic as well as optic, as handling is necessary in order to view the figure's interior.8 The same actions would be undertaken by a person turning the pages of a prayer book, separating the leaves of a diptych, or moving the wings of a conventional triptych altarpiece, with one significant difference.

While other liturgical and paraliturgical devices feature hinged doors, they do not disguise their methods of ingress in the graceful form of the notionally inviolate body of the Virgin Mary Christianity's holiest woman. Medieval texts frequently referred to the Virgin as a doorway, tightly shut, in evocation of her perpetual virginity, or penetrable, as a means to attain heavenly respite. The earliest reference to Mary as door is found in the writings of St. Ambrose (ca. 340-397), whose praise of the Bona porta Maria, quae clausa erat, et non aperiebatur drew upon Ezekiel's description of the door to the Holy of Holies, closed to all but God himself (Ezek 44:1-2).9 Later, the sealed door of the Hebrew Temple extolled by Ambrose was joined to the notion of the Paradise gates, closed by Eve but reopened by Mary, as the verses framing an early eleventh-century miniature of the Virgin arid Child demonstrate: PORTA PARADISI PRIMAEVA(M) CLAUSA PER AEVAM: NUNC EST PER S(AN)C(T)AM CUNCTIS PATEFACTA MARIA(M).10 The page containing these lines formed a pendant to the donor portrait in the illuminated Gospel given to the abbey of Hildesheim by Bishop Bernward, the same patron responsible for the abbey's monumental bronze doors (ca. 1001-1015), which paired eight scenes of Eve and the Virgin.11 With the rise of Marian litanies in the twelfth century, the metaphors of the Virgin as heavenly door and paradise gate multiplied, with artists frequently depicting her alongside portals, as in the Virgo Tota Pulchra imagery that developed in association with the cult of the Immaculate Conception.12 In both learned texts and popular verse, the Virgin was evoked as a door that could either be shut, opened, or selectively opened only at certain moments to certain persons. Of the latter category, the most common reference was to Mary as a door penetrated only by the infant Jesus, an allusion to the virgin birth and to her role in the salvation plan. The Castilian poet Gonzalo de Berceo (ca. 1190-before 1264) employed both metaphors, playing the firmly shut door through which Christ alone passed: La puerta bien cerrada que diz Eqechiel, a ti significava que siempre fust ffel; por ti passo sennero el Sennor d'lsrael, e d'esto es testigo el angel Gabriel.13 against the well-shut portal that will open to admit the blessed to heaven: Ella es dicha fuent de qui todos bevemos, ella nos dio el cevo de qui todos comemos, ell a es dicha puerto a qui todos corremos e puerta por Io qua I entrada atendemos. Ella es dicha puerta en si bien encerrada, pora nos abierta pora darnos entrada.u Such metaphors permeated vernacular literature not only in the Iberian Peninsula where Triptych Virgins most likely originated but throughout Europe, conditioning audiences to perceive the Virgin as a doorway for Christ and for those earning salvation through his sacrifice. Therefore, it may be surprising, and somewhat counterintuitive, to discover that Vierge ouvrante sculptures, which bring to life the metaphor of Mary as doorway, enclose iconographical programs whose emphasis is as much Marian as Christological. 9.

When opened, one finds either a single sculptural group resting in the hollowed shell of the Virgin's body, or a series of bas-relief panels fitted into the interior contours (figs. 1 b, 2). The single sculpture always depicts the Holy Trinity, while the relief panels narrate either the Joys or Sorrows of the Virgin Mary. Single-sculpture interiors predominate numerically and are found primarily north of the Pyrenees Mountains, while the multipanel interiors are found mostly south of the Pyrenees, especially in the former kingdom of Castilla-Leon. Although lesser known, they comprise about one-third of all known opening figures and predate the Trinity interiors by several decades. All surviving single-sculpture figures are carved exclusively of wood that has been gilded and polychromed to add value and detail. Documents indicate that examples cast of precious metals once existed, but these are no longer extant, and were most likely melted down to recover their costly material.15 The narrative figures of the thirteenth century were carved in ivory, a prized material suited for elite patrons, then later produced from the fourteenth century onward in polychromed wood, like the Trinity figures.16 The Trinity interiors always contain a single sculpture of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit arranged in the vertical format known as the Gnadenstuhl (in English, Throne of Grace, or Mercy Seat; fig. 2). Often, the bearded figures have been misidentified as Christ, rather than God the Father, especially if the crucifix or its corpus is missing.17 In the post-Reformation period, the crucifix and dove were often intentionally removed to "sanitize" the figure and avoid the implication that the entire Trinity rather than only its second member, had assumed human form in the Virgin's womb. Jean Gerson (1363-1429) first called attention to this potential confusion in a 1402 sermon/which denounced "images like this one that have the Trinity in their abdomen, as if the entire Trinity assumed flesh in the Virgin Mary/'18 Gerson's early fifteenth-century condemnation has been interpreted by many as having sounded a death knell for Vierges ouvrantes throughout Europe, although this is hardly so. His impact on the genre appears negligible, as more Triptych Virgins were produced after 1402 than in the preceding period. Rather, it was the post-Tridentine repetition of his words in the 1568 Treatise on Sacred Images by Johannes Molanus that no doubt brought Gerson's thoughts to a wider audience.19 Still, it was not until 1745 that Pope Benedict XIV (r. 1740-1758) formally banned the use of Vierge ouvrante sculptures containing Trinities.20 Furthermore, Gerson's concerns do not appear to have been shared by his contemporaries. Though he is correct that Mary sheltered only Jesus and not the other members of the Trinity in her womb, numerous examples from Marian hymnody indicate that the notion of Mary as chamber of the entire Trinity was a beloved rhetorical trope widely used throughout the Middle Ages.21 This 15.

The same piece appears also as entry 2077 {Les dues, vol. 2, p. 10), although some authors have treated these as two distinct objects. 16. The move from ivory to wood is consistent with the pattern of innovative devotional images appearing first in precious materials aimed at elite patrons, and later being emulated in less costly materials by the wider population. One such example is the Golden Virgin of Essen (ca. 980), whose wooden core is sheathed in gold; only later would a plain wooden sculpture serve as a cult image.

This translation reflects</page><page sequence="8">Katz: Behind closed doors 201 lldephonse's ideas still held sway, and remained current for centuries, appearing in an Italian manuscript of religious verse from around 1400. Again in Latin, and probably intended for an audience likely to be familiar with the technicalities of Incarnation theology, these verses read: Sancta in mulieribus Tu, mater pietatis, Pura, plena virtutibus, Camera trinitatis.24 By the mid-fifteenth century, Adam's original Maria! had been translated from Latin into French: Dieu te saut, mere de pi tie, Qui de toute la Trinite Es la noble treble meson.25 The metaphor had taken root in vernacular poetry across Europe, as these lines from Heinrich von Laufenberg show: Bis grust muter alter milte vnd de ganzcen driualt schilte edler, reiner, kuscher schrin.2b Von Laufenberg, an ordained monk and later dean of the cathedral of Freiburg im Breisgau, undoubtedly could distinguish the members of the Trinity, but had no qualms perpetuating the tradition and extending it to a non-learned population via translation from Latin to German. At the other end of Europe, the same sentiments are echoed in a cantiga by Alfonso Alvarez de Villasandino (ca. 1350-1425) that opens the collection of verse known as the Cancionero de Juan Alfonso de Baena. Once more, the vernacular is employed to praise Mary's spotless beauty and humility so great that the entire Trinity was enclosed within her: Generosa, muy fermosa, sin manzilla, Virgen Santa . . . tanta fue la tu grand omildat que toda la Trenidat en ti se encierra e se canta.27 These later examples demonstrate both the longevity of the metaphor in Christian piety and its extension throughout Europe. Nor was the sentiment confined to poetic usage; the lines "Salve, Mater pietatis, ettotius Trinitatis, nobile triclinium, Maria!" taken directly from Adam of St. Victor, appear on the white threshold of Fra Angelica's 1450 Annunciation. This fresco, painted in the upper-floor corridor of the San Marco cloister, situates the words "totius Trinitatis" just beneath the Virgin's feet, yet attracted no ecclesiastical censure, even within a monastic setting.28 Fra Angelico's elision of the Annunciation, Incarnation, and indwelling of the Trinity in the body of the Virgin Mary returns us to the topic of motifs hidden within Vierge ouvrante interiors, and specifically to the second type of interior motif. These are the Narrative interiors, a term I employ to indicate their storytelling capacity, although previous authors have called them Marian types in reference to their subject matter.29 Rather than enclose a single sculpture inserted into a hollowed cavity, these Virgins instead feature interiors carved into a series of bas-relief or open panels that depict Gospel scenes such as the Annunciation, Nativity, and Adoration. In this way, they include in their web of allusions references to the Trinity, by evoking the Incarnation as one of the entry points for the Trinity on Earth (the others being Christ's baptism and the Pentecostal descent of the Holy Spirit). Yet, like Fra Angelico's painting, they do not confine themselves to one theme, but draw together a series of references that stress the complexity of meanings embodied by the Isidore of Seville's Etymologies and provides a felicitous confluence of imagery quite appropriate to the virginal womb. 24.

Less well known today than the Trinitarian Vierges ouvrantes, but never doctrinally censured nor suppressed, sculptures with narrative interiors predominate on the Iberian Peninsula and most likely originated there. Nevertheless, as the map indicates, four Narrative Virgins are found north of the Pyrenees, while four Trinity interiors are found south of this divide, pointing to an iconographical exchange that obviates any attempt to dismiss the two groups as culturally defined and artistically unrelated (fig. A1, Appendix).30The narrative cycles consist of two types; the earliest depict scenes from the Life of the Virgin, or more accurately the Joys of the Virgin, for they are emphatically Marian in content, and depict the seven joys popularized in the thirteenth century by Franciscan preachers.31 In the case of the Triptych Virgin from Santa Clara de Allariz, a convent of Poor Clares in northwest Spain, the Joys depicted are (from bottom to top, left to right): the Annunciation, Nativity, and Epiphany (lower range); the discovery of the Empty Tomb, Ascension, and Pentecost (middle range); and the Coronation of the Virgin flanked by pairs of angels (upper range; figs. 1 b, 3). Note that although the body is divided into nine compartments, the artist has cleverly distributed the scenes so that the total of seven episodes are depicted. In later Narrative figures, the Joys of the Virgin were displaced by Passion cycles, reflecting the shift to emotive piety influenced by movements such as Devotio moderna, a program of spiritual renewal that promoted meditation and interior prayer among the lay population (as opposed to external prayer via liturgy and public rituals).32 The narrative interiors cannot be comprehended at a glance as can the Gnadenstuhls of the North, but compel their viewers to look long and with care at their myriad of miniature details (figs. 3, 4). Both interior motifs are effective communicators of the divine, but in quite different manners. The Trinity interiors convey a sense of dignified order, in keeping with the solemn awe of the three-personed godhead depicted with an equally majestic figure of the Theotokos, and the explicit link between blessed mother and divine son is explicit in these sculptures. The narrative cycles, by contrast, are awe-inspiring yet disordered?indeed, in some sculptures, such as the ca. 1300 ivory Virgem abrideira now in the cathedral museum of Evora, Portugal, the narrative scenes eschew chronological order?failing to resolve at first view into a meaningful sequence.33 Their untidy interiors guide the viewer to a stirring emotional climax, arising from a delayed comprehension that promotes extended contemplation. In the literature to date, the interior motifs have served as an organizing principle by which to structure the Vierge ouvrante corpus.34 Most authors confined their observations to the iconographical categorization of the interior types, rather than addressing devotional or phenomenological aspects. Gudrun Radler's monograph employs the categories formulated in 1913 by Jean Sarrete, dividing the corpus into a Trinity group, a Passion group, and a Life of the Virgin group.35 However, once alerted to the Marian program at work in the figures, it makes more sense to refer to the Passion cycles as depictions of the Virgin's Sorrows, in order to indicate their continuity with, rather than departure from, the earlier Joyful cycle.36 Also unnoted is how the 30.

This is especially true in the Iberian corpus, with the rise in the sixteenth century of figures depicting Mary Immaculate, alone without the Christ Child, in response to the increasing prominence of the Figure 4.

Immaculate Conception in Marian piety and theology at this point. The interior scenes of the Inmaculada Virgins all feature the Virgin's sorrows, drawing a parallel between Mary's triumph over sin with Christ's sacrifice to redeem humanity's sin. The pairing of these themes is uncommon</page><page sequence="11">204 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 but appropriate, given the sequential nature in which the iconography is encountered.37 More surprising is the fact that all but one of the Inmaculada figures open not along the full length of the Virgin's body, but only in a narrow section corresponding to the breast area. The interior scenes are disclosed by prying apart the Virgin's hands, which are clasped in prayer at chest level (fig. 5). The intimacy of the gesture is unmistakable, although probably not as salacious as it might seem today. The early modern association of the breasts with nurture and, feeding is underscored by the fact that several of the Inmaculada Triptych Virgins conceal behind their breasts scenes of the Last Supper stretched horizontally beneath a Crucifixion.38 By separating the Virgin's hands, the person handling the sculpture not only exposes the interior scenes but also transforms Mary's body into the shape of a cross, thus reinforcing the association between Mary, who nourished her son with her body, and Jesus, who nourishes humanity via the Eucharist, prefigured in the Last Supper.39 Although enclosing such sacramental references inside the Virgin's body seems as potentially audacious as the placement of a Trinity within her, these Immaculate Conception figures were never censured, despite being produced in the sensitive Reformation period. To the contrary, the Spanish monarch Philip II (r. 1556-1598) is known to have owned a breast-opening figure, which itself came as a gift from Pope Pius V (r. 1566-1572) in tribute to the victory at the battle of Lepanto. Such a provenance indicates that the opening figure met the cautious strictures of the post-Tridentine papacy and court as a licit visual expression of Christian doctrine. Philip ll's sculpture remained at the Escorial palace through the twentieth century, disappearing only in the early days of the Spanish Civil War.40 To date, I have not located any figures that open exclusively at breast level in Europe north of the Pyrenees, although I have uncovered two sixteenth century examples that found their way to the Americas. Triptych Virgins whose exteriors depict the Immaculate Conception appear to have produced exclusively in Iberia; the same is true for figures whose interior motifs depict the Joys of the Virgin. The four authentic Narrative figures produced and still housed north of the Pyrenees all enclose scenes of the Marian sorrows, and among themselves exhibit curious similarities. Two are located in Brittany (Guern and Bannalec), two were stolen in the 1970s (Maubuisson, France, and Cheyre, Switzerland), their current whereabouts unknown, and two are misdated to the time when their church was built rather than to the period when the statue was created (Guern to the 1320s, when it is a sixteenth-century sculpture in an earlier church, and Maubuisson to 1240, when the convent annals list it as ca. 1400).41 Finally, Guern, Maubuisson, and Bannalec share the curious feature of being the three largest Vierges ouvrantes ever produced, the seated figures of Guern and Maubuisson being larger than life-size. I dwell on the errors in dating to emphasize two points: First, that the current literature on Vierges ouvrantes, despite being primarily concerned with issues of chronology and stylistic development, is prone to error and in need of revision. Second, evidence now indicates that the earliest known Vierges ouvrantes come not from France, as thought, but rather from the Iberian Peninsula, where three ivory Narrative Virgins (perhaps four, if one counts a lost work listed in the Siguenza cathedral inventory of 1339) date from the second half of the thirteenth century.42 The broader relevance of this 37. The pairing of the images of Virgin Mary and scenes of the Passion is not unusual; the pairing of Mary Immaculate and Christ's Passion, however, is less common. 38. Some (but not all) Immaculate Conception Virgins consist of opening figures, which are themselves enclosed within shallow wooden tabernacles whose wings form a second triptych, multiplying the iconographic possibilities, open and closed. These works appear to come from a workshop in Toledo; see Melissa R. Katz, "Virgenes abrideras." Herencia Recibida 07 (Toledo, ES: Consejena de Cultura, Castilla-La Mancha, 2007), pp. 140-141. 39.

Because authors prior to Gudrun Radler treated the Trinity interiors as normative and their Iberian counterpart as an aberrant branch of an otherwise coherent family, fewer scholars are aware of these Narrative Virgins. Subsequent authors who rely on Radler's catalogue reiterate her placement of the much-debated ivory from the Walters Art Museum as the earliest known work, leading to its reproduction in several publications of note as a representative example Torviso (Leon, ES: Junta de Castilla y Leon/Caja Espana, 2000), vol.

Due to their close interrelation and the rare fortune that the patron of the earliest is known, all can be confidently dated to the second half of the thirteenth century. Circumstances in the life of Violante de Aragon (1236-1301), queen of CastiI la-Leon (r. 1252-1284), and patron of the prototype Virgin of Santa Clara de Allariz furthermore point to the 1270s as the decade in which her Triptych Virgin was most likely created.

James D'Emilio and Michael Kulikowski (Leiden: Brill, forthcoming 2010). The Vfrgen abridera of Salamanca cathedral, a near faithful copy perhaps also from the royal workshops, dates to the same or subsequent decade, while the related but not identical Virgin once in an Evora convent and now in its cathedral museum, can be placed in the fourth quarter of the thirteenth century.</page><page sequence="13">206 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 of an early Vierge ouvrante.43 This creates an unfortunate impression, not only regarding the authenticity of French ivory Vierges ouvrantes, but also regarding the unlikely emergence of Passion interiors prior to those depicting the joyful mysteries, and the manner in which medieval artists and audiences perceived the interior motifs in relation to the exterior motifs.44 No matter what form the interior motif takes, narrative or Trinity, or the date one assigns to it, it is this feature that for many defines the sculptural genre. Vierges ouvrantes are Virgins that open, and they open to reveal further imagery. Whereas the Gnadenstuhl is the indisputable focus of the Trinity interiors, narrative interiors lack this feature. Their sequential design structure was often used in illuminated manuscripts where the narration extended visually over a series of vignettes. It is important to note, however, that manuscript illuminations, like text, generally read from top to bottom, whereas Vierge ouvrante interiors are arranged sequentially from the bottom upward. Even the side paintings of the Metropolitan's Shrine Madonna?one of two extant works to combine a Trinity interior with narrative wings, and perhaps a vestige of the transition from narrative to Trinity interiors?are organized in this manner (fig. 2).45 This reading, from bottom up, corresponds not to the traditional design of a manuscript page, but to the narrative structure often used in architectural ensembles. Useful comparisons are found in the tympana on the right-hand (south) side of the Royal Portal on the west fagade at Chartres (1145-1155), and the St. Anne portal of Notre-Dame de Paris (south side of the west fagade, begun by 1148). The Chartres tympanum commences with an Annunciation-Nativity sequence in the lower lintel, followed by the presentation in the Temple in its upper lintel, capped by the Virgin in Child in Majesty (fig. 6). The same upward-moving narration is employed at Notre Dame, whose two lower levels feature the infancy Gospels, culminating in a Sedes sapientiae at the pinnacle. Architectural precedents can also be drawn to sculptural representations of the Virgin and Child that have been inserted into broader narrative programs, providing a context from which to consider the combination of narrative and devotional images in a single sculptural entity. The narratives need not be clearly segmented, as in the French portals, but integrated, as in the Golden Portal of Freiberg in Saxony (ca. 1225-1240), whose tympanum combines an Adoration of the Magi, seated Virgin and Child in Majesty, and Coronation of the Virgin in one unit, itself situated within a broader portal program.46 As in the Trinity interiors, the contiguous scenes at Freiberg indicate how juxtaposition as well as segmentation can be used to convey narrative. The influence of monumental sculpture on devotional imagery also calls to mind the frequent presence of the Virgin and Child on the trumeaus of Gothic cathedrals where, from their perch bisecting a doubled doorway, trumeau figures oversee our passage from the secular world into the interior church sanctuary. Here, as in the Vierges ouvrantes, the body of the Virgin acts as mediator in the liminal transition from secular to sacred 43. Both Didi-Huberman (note 5) and Marcus Rimmele (note 4) reproduce this work without contextualization. Radler (note 3) is one of the few scholars who still accepts as authentic the highly problematic and much-questioned ivory Vierge ouvrante currently housed in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore (Radler, pp. 51-55, and cat. no. 1, pp. 203-210). Many refuse judgment, alluding to problems of style, iconography, and provenance; see Dany Sandron, "La sculpture en ivoire au debut du Xllle siecle, d'un monde a I'autre," Revue de l'art 102, no. 102 (1993):48-49. I reject it conclusively, on numerous grounds, detailed in my dissertation. For now, arguments pro and con can be found in Kelly Holbert, "The Vindication of a Controversial Early Thirteenth-century Vierge Ouvrante in the Walters Art Gallery," Journal of the Walters Art Gallery 55/56 (1997/1998): 101-121 (pro); and Richard H. Randall, jr., "Epilogue: Pastiches, Revivals, Forgeries, and Open Questions," Images in Ivory: Precious Objects of the Gothic Age, ed. Peter Barnet (Detroit: Detroit Institute of Arts, 1997), pp. 285-289 {in contra). 44. France was home in the fourteenth century to at least one ivory Vierge ouvrante, recorded in a 1343 inventory of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, as "ymago eburnea valde antiqua." Unfortunately, it is no longer extant, nor is its interior described other than to indicate that it contained multiple images; Gustave Fagniez, "Inventaires due Tresor de Notre-Dame de Paris. Suite 1: Inventaire de 1343," Revue Archeologique 27 (April 1874), entry 8, p. 251. Of the four extant French ivories, three are definitely forgeries of the 1820s, and the fourth is the disputed piece mentioned above (note 43). 45. The early fourteenth-century work in the Metropolitan is one of only two Triptych Virgins?the other is the ca. 1400 Notre Dame du Mur of Morlaix (Brittany)?to feature both a Gnadenstuhl and (six) narrative scenes. The side wings of most Triptych Virgins feature paintings of angels, Gabriel and Mary (the Annunciation), or the faithful sheltering under the mantle of the Virgin of Mercy; the latter are discussed in detail, to follow (see note 82). Morlaix and the Metropolitan sculpture are also the only two to depict a V7rgo lactans on the exterior, so that while it too is frequently illustrated as a representative Vierge ouvrante example, it is rather idiosyncratic. On the Met's work, see William D. Wixom, "Medieval Sculpture at the Metropolitan 800-1400," Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 62, no. 4 (Spring 2005), pp. 46 and 48; on Morlaix, see Gertsman (note 4). 46.

It is not by chance that the spiritual concept of transformational liminality derives from the term limen meaning threshold.47 Even before the female body made its appearance on the architectural jamb, it had already been associated theologically with the doorway as point of passage. Isidore of Seville, in his early seventh-century Etymologies, ascribed the derivation of the word valva, a type of double door, to that of vulva, a womb, noting, "the vulva is analogous to a folding door, valva?that is, the door of the belly?because it receives the semen, or because the fetus proceeds from it.//48 Valva in later medieval texts was frequently associated with the paired doors of a church building?the term was used in reference to both Conques and Compostela?again linking the set of valvae present in all Vierges ouvrantes to the basilica, the body, and the female womb.49 A latent gendering is also implied in Claude Gandelman's semiotic analysis of doors as sites of penetration and communication.50 With regard to the Triptych Virgin, however, no penetration can take place, not only 47. Van Gennep coined the term, and Turner brought it into common use. See Arnold van Gennep, The Rites of Passage (1909; repr. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1960); Victor W.

Neither admitted nor excluded by the corporeal doorway of the sculpture, the viewer remains at the threshold, looking upon its interior. Once again, the encounter is both haptic and optic, as our touch opens the doors but our eyes cross the threshold. The touch, however, is not reciprocated, nor is the motion it generates ever deceptive or mimetic. These works do not attempt to imitate human motion, as in an automaton, but rather to involve the viewer in a structured encounter with the Marian body and its accessible interior. While they may be said to facilitate touch, Triptych Virgins frustrate vision, for the two states, interior and exterior, can never be seen simultaneously, save in reproduction. As a static devotional experience, Vierges ouvrantes were displayed either opened or closed. The intermediary transitional phase from one state to another could provide a moment of both literal and metaphorical revelation, but nevertheless would impede perception of the external body, which, once broken apart at center, no longer remained available for visual inspection.51 This results in work that, whether static or in motion, is always partly visible, partly hidden. Art historians pursue visual clarity in their studies of works of art, yet visibility should not be confused with legibility Much has been made of the practice of "ocular communion" following the Fourth Lateran Council's 1215 call for the elevation of the host at the moment of transubstantiation to allow the laity to observe the process.52 Miri Rubin noted how the sight of the Eucharistic wafer came to substitute for its consumption, giving a quasi-sacramental role to the act of viewing.53 Yet in a crowded church, or one whose view of the altar was restricted by curtains and/or choir screens, ocular communion was experienced as much through one's presence in the church as through one's vision of the elevation, challenging the tacit assumption that what is hidden is what one cannot see and what is visible is that which is not hidden. Within a Christian context, limiting or restricting the visibility of devotional objects as a means of enhancing their prestige and deepening spiritual intensity dates back at least to Byzantium. Cult images in both the East and West were routinely kept veiled from view save for occasions of sanctioned devotion, while the Blachernitissa icon in Constantinople was subject to a weekly miracle, in which its curtain elevated itself most Fridays to reveal the holy image to an eager throng.54 Controlled access to cult images has often been interpreted as a means of fomenting audience as well as inspiring devotion, but Church strictures on the ostentation of relics outside of their reliquary containers?enacted by the same Lateran Council that authorized the elevation of the Eucharist in 1215?indicate reservations on the part of the hierarchy regarding sacred sight beyond carefully defined and confined circumstances.55 51. Sadly, no medieval account describing the use of a Vierge ouvrante survives. The seventeenth-century nun Soeur Candide described the opening of the Maubuisson Vierge ouvrante as the transformation of a sculpture of the Virgin into an entire world: "Quand elle estoit ainsi ouverte, ce n'estoit une Vierge, mais un monde et plus qu'un monde") Depoin (note 41), p. 17. 52.

In a devotional setting, invisibility and partial visibility?integral facets of Triptych Virgins?could become elements that enhanced rather than inhibited one's encounter with the sculpture. Time and memory also played into the devotional experience, as only through memory could the premodern viewer call to mind the entire object, interior and exterior. While photography has solved that problem, allowing both states to be pictured simultaneously, its rise has coincided with the transfer of many religious works from a devotional context to secular settings, having a profound effect on the manner in which they are visualized. Prized for their difference? for the ways in which they diverge from traditional figures of the Virgin and Child, and not for the ways in which they conform?Vierges ouvrantes are displayed today in a state of constant aperture, challenging the viewer to imagine them in their normative closed state (fig. 7). The hidden aspect has been inverted and subverted through emphasis of material properties over mystical ones.56 Our secular method of display, permanently open in museum vitrines, not only reverses the proper order, but also robs these sculptures of their greatest power, the power to transform, surprise, and amaze. It also interposes a barrier between the sculpture and its spectator. This can enhance the allure of an object on view; many devotional objects benefit from this form of display, which replicates the elevated status they held as nonquotidian objects, and mimics the restricted access that pertained to liturgical goods in earlier Ji^^flHHHHHilli^Hi ' I 1 lirWin I IB Figure 7.

Closed, Triptych Virgins lose their fascination for specialists, leading authors to neglect the decisive role of the Holy Virgin serving as a container of sacred mysteries.58 Here, non-Christian devotional practices can p. 1050.

These observations apply as well to the study of triptych altarpieces, whose movable wings established a similar dialectic between familiar exterior and restricted interior, and which are typically displayed open and discussed in ways that privilege the interior imagery. Triptych Virgins arose in the third quarter of the thirteenth century, several decades before winged triptych altarpieces appeared (ca. 1325), and thus are not equivalent structures, but do provide a helpful analogue.

Understandably, Christian theologians hasten to draw distinctions?in idolatry, the deity is thought to be housed or "trapped" in its likeness, whereas in Christian image-based devotion, the likeness serves only to inspire and direct reverence to the deity, not to represent it or substitute for it.60 Nevertheless, the ceremonial use of body doubles/ devotional figures in non-Western contexts, and in particular, the practice of ceremonial wrapping, sheds light on parallel elements in Vierge ouvrante sculpture. Anthropologist Alfred Gell, in his discussion of Polynesian wrapping strategies employed to shield a deity from view when not in ceremonial use, observed that covering an image serves to enhance its sacrality (as only consecrated individuals may look upon unbound fetishes) and temper its efficacy (as binding dispatches the god to the underworld until again called forth by the cult).61 Bound deities, like Triptych Virgins, intentionally limit visibility and thus create hierarchies of seeing. This privileged viewing implies an augmentation of power that can be achieved by restricting access to the inner object. Comparable behaviors are observed in Christian practices of opening a Vierge ouvrante at moments when the Virgin's intercession is needed. According to a seventeenth-century account, the sculpture from the royal abbey of Maubuisson was opened and rogatory masses addressed to it in hopes of alleviating drought; the same practice of saying prayers to an opened figure took place in the Cantabrian village of Pie de Concha at times of imminent flooding.62 In both cases, the need for divine aid was signaled by exposing the normally hidden interior, activating its ability to intercede for the community. It is worth noting that such actions parallel occasions in which conventional religious imagery would be carried in processions, another form of soliciting intercession by enhancing visibility, which is achieved by means of movement.63 Selective vision is also an integral feature of conventional winged altarpieces, whose interiors would remain concealed save for major feast days, allowing both a scarcity and a periodicity of visibility of the images enclosed within.64 It has been noted that the rise of traditional triptych altarpieces coincided with the permanent installation of cult images (or more specifically, sculpted imagery) on the altar. Prior to this development, sculptures would be removed when not in use, both to protect the valuable images and to avoid giving an impression of idolatry by having the figure in continual view.65 The limited viewing of a titular saint or sculptural ensemble maintained within the closed altarpiece on non-feast days is analogous to Gell's example of image wrapping. In all cases, one need not see the inner image to understand its potential power, much as a congregation viewing a closed Triptych Virgin could feel a sense of heightened emotion just by knowing that something lay within, even when it was not on view. Whether the consecrated object serves as a temporal body for the absent god, as in the spirit conduits studied by Gel I, or as a means to strengthen the devotional encounter, as in the Christian context, these sculpted bodies are reverenced in manners that accord them 59. The works of Freedberg and Belting are indispensable for comparative study; David Freedberg, The Power of Images: Studies in the History and Theory of Response (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989); Hans Belting, The Image and its Public in the Middle Ages: Form and Function of Early Paintings of the Passion, trans.

The position of the Church of Rome on image worship (cultis sacrarum imaginum) holds that one reverences not the image but the personage it represents. The statement adopted at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, "For the honour paid to an image passes on to its prototype; he who worships an image worships the reality of him who is painted in it/' was reiterated in the twenty-fifth decree of the Council of Trent in 1563.

This distinction is crucial to keep in mind when considering Triptych Virgin sculptures, which mistakenly have been treated as corporeal equivalents of the female body, said to be pregnant depictions.66 Such an approach draws attention to visual semblances, but neglects the important ways in which these sculptures differ from human bodies. One may arrive at a more meaningful interpretation of their opening bodies not by drawing similarities but by marking difference. Vierges ouvrantes employ numerous strategies to distance the body of the Virgin from that of its human equivalent as a means of glorifying the spiritual, noncorporeal facets of Mary's identity. To borrow a term from Gell, the sculptures exhibit elements of concentric and fractal personhood, evident not only in the dialectic of interior and exterior, but also in the subdivision of their interiors, especially evident in the narrative figures.67 All Triptych Virgins become fragmented bodies once the sculpture has been opened up, challenging our assumptions regarding surface and substance, as the outer body is disrupted and seemingly impermeable shells of ivory and wood revealed as permeable membranes. Opening the Marian figure not only limits the visibility of the external Virgin, but also compromises its viability as a body, with notable consequences for the sculpture as an instrument of devotion. Though closely related, the interaction between the sculpture's exterior and interior in the open state is not a direct inversion of their relationship in the closed state, when one motif was fully visible and the other fully concealed. In the case of the opened figure, nothing is hidden from view so much as our view is hindered. Arms, head, hands, and feet remain visible but are distributed onto separate planes, becoming separated and interrupted fragments (fig. 8). The parting of the Virgin's body results in not just a parted body, but also a partial body, or more aptly a body in parts, whose integrity has been exchanged in order to accede to an internal realm in hope of inner revelation. To speak of a broken or distributed body in the context of medieval devotional art immediately calls to mind the body of Christ, broken physically on the cross and again figuratively in the sectioned communion wafer. The battered and broken bodies of medieval martyrs, flagellants, and ascetics were gladly suffered and often sought after as imitations of Christ's own afflicted body68 The body of the Virgin is not usually associated with such pious shattering and fragmentations. By contrast, Mary's body is defined by its intactness?the body that conceived, delivered, and was assumed into heaven whole and undamaged, impeding the acquisition of corporeal fragments to serve as relics. This lack of bodily fragments contributed to a symbolic aura that accrued to cult figures of the Virgin and Child, which in the absence of traditional relics functioned as quasi-relics and reliquaries in recompense for this deficit. This distinction is essential in order to comprehend the action that takes place when the viewer/user ruptures the body of the Triptych Virgin to expose the interior motif. This action is not a cruel dismemberment, effected with violence, but a gentle one, accomplished with the aid of the worshipper, whose hands must make contact with Mary's body in order to part the central doors and reveal the interior chamber. As such, it is in keeping with Marian piety, which emphasizes her compassion rather than participation in violent torment and physical affliction. Mary's compassio at the foot of the cross features prominently in meditations on her Seven Sorrows, a devotion whose popularity grew in the fourteenth century. Such piety is reflected in the Triptych Virgins whose interiors feature Passion narratives, which encourage the viewer to regard Mary's spiritual martyrdom as a counterpart to Christ's physical sacrifice.69 Hymns such as the Stabat Mater on the one hand (which alternates verses of the Passio Christi with the Compassio Mariae) and images such as the Pieta, on the other hand, emphasize that the Virgin Mary's suffering in the later Middle Ages was understood as occurring mentally rather than physically and meant to emulate but not replicate her son's pain.70 The corporeal fragmentation that takes place in the opened Vierge ouvrante figure is a puzzling and unsettling challenge to assess today, and it is difficult to 66.

Criticism was never directed to the presentation of a Marian body that opens for inspection, but only to the presence of the entire Trinity within one branch of the genre.71 It went unnoted that the devotional 70. The thirteenth-century hymn Stabat Mater dolorosa describes in twenty couplets the Sorrows of the Virgin at the foot of the cross; see Franz Joseph Mone, Lateinische Hymnen des Mittelalters (Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder, 1854), vol. II, no. 442. 71. On early criticism of the Vierge ouvrante, see preceding discussion (notes 18-20). displacement of Mary's flesh to provide sanctuary for the three persons of the Trinity or populated scenes of the Virgin's Joys and Sorrows constituted a displacement of the space in her body nominally revered as womb and symbolic tabernacle of the infant Jesus. Chancellor Gerson was alert to the possibility that Triptych Virgins might be perceived as having promoted Mary from mother of Jesus to mother of the Trinity but not to her more audacious potential elevation from agent of the Incarnation to instrument of Christian salvation. The manner in which these sculptures distance the Virgin Mary from her role in the Incarnation can best be understood by comparison to contemporary medieval images whose primary purpose is to exalt Mary's divine motherhood. Numerous works of art survive that depict the Virgin bearing an infant in or on her womb (rather than her arms), rendering visible the doctrine of the</page><page sequence="20">Katz: Behind closed doors 213 Figure 9.

Images of fetal Christs are often found as part of a Visitation pairing, in which the unborn Christ and John the Baptist salute each other from the comfort of their mother's wombs (fig. 9).72 In addition, one finds solitary representations of the Virgin 72.

Mary in the guise of Our Lady of Hope or Expectation, with her hands grasped in prayer above a small oval in her belly into which a miniature sculpture of the infant Jesus has been inserted (fig. 10).74 Medieval and early modern examples of such sculptures can be found throughout the Iberian Peninsula, including the fifteenth century example from the Hieronymite convent of San Pablo in Toledo shown here. The survival of examples in Germany and Austria indicates the devotion was not limited to Spain and Portugal.75 74. Lechner illustrates several examples, but his historical discussion omits mention of the major first-millennial cult to Maria Gravida on the Iberian Peninsula, centered on the Feast of the Expectant Virgin, celebrated on December 18. Instituted at the Tenth Council of Toledo in 656, the feast was maintained on the liturgical calendar despite Cluniac opposition in the eleventh-century transfer from the Hispanic (Mozarabic) to the Roman Rite. See Lechner (note 72); pp. 48-77; and Jose Vives Gatell with Tomas Marin Martinez and Gonzalo Martinez Diez, Concilios visgoticos e hispano-romanos (Barcelona: CSIC, 1962, p. 309). 75.

See Gertrud</page><page sequence="22">Katz: Behind closed doors 215 Significantly, for our purposes, in none of these sculptures (including the German examples) are the fetal Christs ever concealed or hidden. The womb of the expectant Virgin is always uncovered and open to permanent view, and her motherhood made manifest without the intervention of a curtain or covering. In this aspect, the sculptures differ greatly from Vierge ouvrantes, whose defining feature is the enclosure of their interior contents behind a pair of doors carved and shaped like the body (generally, shoulders to feet) of the Virgin Mary. To borrow an apt phrase from Bachelard, "the obvious dynamism of these extravagant figures lies in the fact that they come alive in the dialectics of what is hidden and what is manifest/'76 The hollowed bellies and the exposed fetuses of the Expectation figures hide nothing and exhibit no iconographical duality, underlining the fact that another mechanism entirely is operative in the Vierge ouvrante. In their conversion from a closed to an open sculpture, Triptych Virgins undergo a process I have termed corporeal erasure. Closed, one encounters the familiar image of a Virgin and Child figure, whether depicted with the solemn countenance of a Sedes sapientiae, as in the early works, or with the maternal tenderness of the later examples. Opened, however, the figure assumes the alien form of a bisected body. The familiar external body becomes a body in parts, although our prior knowledge of the closed figure conditions our perception of the transformed image and makes it less troubling. Hidden from view on the reverse of the open wings that now command our attention, Mary's body brokers the transition from one stage of imagery to another, and is itself broken by the transformation (fig. 8). It becomes less of an anatomical structure and more of a means of passage from one phase to another. More significantly, the dismemberment is not complete?save for one case, the head of the Virgin Mary always remains intact, hovering above the opened figure and keeping watch as we peer into the interior cavity (fig. 11 ).77 The head that persists after the body has been displaced by the two wings seems quite different from a relic, that is, a fragmented body part imbued with meaning for having once formed part of a human body now absent and unattainable. Rather, I see this grave or smiling head as the troubling persistence of an entity temporarily dissolved but capable of reconstitution, reminding us of the dehumanizing features of a body equipped with doors. The sculpture engages in this paradox of bodily presence and absence that constitutes corporeal erasure, the Vierge absconding to be replaced by a triptych; and we are complicit in this vanishing act by means of our physical manipulation of the figure. While many have portrayed these sculptures as celebrations of the generative powers of the female body intertwined with an exegesis of the Incarnation, I see in them instead a desire to deemphasize the anatomical aspects of the doctrine and elevate the spiritual, a tendency well in keeping with anticorporeal elements of medieval Christianity.78 Such is a perfectly appropriate condition for the Marian body, and not at all in conflict with contemporary theology: Who but the Virgin would contain marvels within her rather than entrails? Freed from the corrupting material of human existence, the body of the Virgin becomes a canvas of miniature episodes mapping the path to salvation or a stage on which to perch a statue of the Throne of Grace. The fashioning of the human form with a set of doors, I believe, indicates a desire to transcend mere physicality; outwardly the sculptures seemingly provide access to the Marian interior, but in truth expose not the corrupting matter of common life, but rather the mechanism of redemption grafted onto the form of a woman of infinite purity. Although my notion of corporeal erasure owes much to contemporary theory, it can also be seen as being deeply rooted in traditional medieval notions of bodily denial, something again quite appropriate to the Marian body.79 This does not imply a negative bias Schiller, Ikonographie der christlichen Kunst vol. IV.2 (Gutersloh, DE: GutersloherVerlagshaus G. Mohn, 1980), pp. 258, and 432, cat. no. 767; and Lechner (note 72), figs. 155/l-XXXIX. 76. Bachelard (see note 1), p. 111. Naturally, he was not discussing a Triptych Virgin. Rather, Bachelard's comments referred to a snail. 77. The one exception is the ca. 1400 sculpture from Maubuisson abbey (note 41), whose unusual head-to-foot opening, I argue, confused the maker(s) of the French forgeries. At the time, few Vierges ouvrantes were known, and the Maubuisson statue was considered both representative and the earliest surviving Triptych Virgin. Hence, it served as the model for the new pieces introduced onto the market around 1830, all of which, like it, open from head to foot, rather than from shoulder to foot, as most (yet to be discovered) Triptych Virgins do. 78. Rimmele's recent article (note 4) is an example of this tendency to read Vierge ouvrante sculptures through the lens of the procreative body, bringing contemporary theories of reproduction to bear on the enfleshing of the Word in Mary's womb. While theologically appropriate, and of relevance to any devotional image of the Virgin and Child, to deal exclusively with these aspects is to overlook the theological complexity of the Triptych Virgin. 79. The post-Structuralist concept of writing under erasure (sous rature) originated in the work of Derrida; see Jacques Derrida, Of Grammatology, trans.

Photo by the author. towards the human body among medieval Christians, a tired trope Caroline Walker Bynum has effectively countered by arguing that theological debates over man's physical nature arose from appreciation of Christ's essential humanity and the vital unity of body and soul, rather than scorn for the somatic body.80 What is often overlooked in such discussions, however, is the way that the debate regarding the human body and the divine body vary with respect to thought regarding the Virgin's body. Doctrines such as perpetual virginity, bodily assumption, and birth free from the stain of original sin emphasize the ways in which Mary's body differs from that of the ordinary human's, male or female. While parishioners and professional religious might be encouraged to emulate her modest demeanor and humble acquiescence to God's will, none would be able to approximate her spotless nature or her liberation from the exigencies of birth, procreation, and death. This is the essence of the Marian exception. As Cicero noted, exceptions can prove the rule, and the exceptions to the concept of corporeal erasure are equally valid and valuable.81 One subcategory of Vierges ouvrantes?or more properly, Schreinmadonnen, for their common denominator is that all proceed from the former medieval states ruled by the Teutonic Order of Knights?exists that opens not to display absent bodies but doubled ones. That is, certain features such as hands, arms, and/or breasts are depicted on the interior of the opened sculpture as well as on its dissolved exterior. The early fifteenth-century work currently in the Archbishop's Palace and Diocesan Museum of Vienna is one example of this subgroup of eleven figures, which constitute one-sixth of the known corpus of Triptych Virgins (fig. 12).82 The other feature common to these works, along Hopkins University Press, 1998), pp. 60-61. Its application to the history of art was introduced to me in Joan R. Branham, "Sacred Space under Erasure in Ancient Synagogues and Early Churches," Art Bulletin 74, no. 3 (1992):375-394. 80.

It is this latter attribute that required the sculptors to depict the Virgin Mary with intact arms outstretched, supporting her cloak, and thus accounts for the presence of a doubled body in these Schutzmantel Schreinmadonnen and the absence of a doubled body in all other opened figures. In this subcategory, each sculpture literally has two sets of arms, an external pair that cradles the infant Jesus, and an internal pair that church of Hamwarde (Schleswig-Holstein) is missing its wings, but its Baltic proximity and anatomical detailing in the extant central panel suggest it belongs in this Schutzmantel subgroup.

Although they are a minority among Triptych Virgins, the Teutonic subgroup is an important reminer of the palpable dualism at play in all these sculptures, expressed through dialectics of interior/ exterior, visible/invisible, revealed/concealed, and hidden/manifest. This last category is most challenging to viewers who so plainly see before them the body of the Virgin Mary acting as a container that becomes difficult to see her as containing anything but allusions to motherhood and the womb. This tendency to regard the Virgin Mary as not just a body apart but a body of parts leads us to imagine the presence of a womb even when not presented with one. But when regarding the parted body of the Triptych Virgin, much is gained by keeping in mind this distinction. The door in her belly opens not into a womb but a room, or series of chambers, wherein lie not just symbols of birth and life, but of death and the afterlife as well. Georg Simmel in his seminal 1909 essay, "Bridges and Doors," argued that doors symbolized the connection between the human body and what lies outside it, uniting inner</page><page sequence="25">218 RES 55/56 SPRING/AUTUMN 2009 and outer worlds.83 But precisely because doors can be opened, he astutely noted, their closure underscores our isolation and separation from the world beyond.84 Like the believer who seeks heavenly access but fears to find the way blocked, doors are rife with uncertainties. They facilitate entrance but do not ensure access. The doors of the Virgin's body in the Vienna Schreinmadonna open to show the faithful sheltered beneath her mantle, adjacent to but not inside the hollow reserved for the Trinity (fig. 12). Viewers encounter such a boundary as well in the bodies of Triptych Virgins, which yield to their touch but admit only a gaze. Worshipers turned to devotional sculptures of the Virgin to assist their passage from the temporal to the spiritual realm; Vierges ouvrantes were designed with such acts in mind. Central as the Incarnation may be in the schema of Christian salvation, awaiting behind the closed doors of the Triptych Virgin was not a view of Mary's carnal body and her divine foetus, but a glimpse of salvation for the believer to ponder, and hope one day of attaining. My intent here is not to deny that aspects of human anatomy and the anthropomorphic associations play a large part in the devotional experience of these figures, but rather to move us beyond the rhetoric of a constant and stable embodiment to areas unexplored in previous writings on the Vierge ouvrante. To equate the body of the Virgin with the body of the statue is not to err so much as to limit one's vision to what is plainly manifest, and thus overlook the deeper meanings that hide within these shape-shifting sculptures. The sense of a doubled presence conveyed by the fragmented bodies of the Triptych Virgins (and embodied by the Schutzmantel Schreinmadonnen examples) can mask for many the dichotomy between the corporeal and the intangible, much as our sturdy exteriors conceal the presence of an elusive soul. For what, according to the premodern mindset, resided hidden within the visible body, but the invisible soul? The soul?immaterial, spiritual antithesis of the raw organic matter that clogs human anatomy? and which, like the Incarnation, occupied the body's interior but left no permanent trace. In the sacred geography of the Triptych Virgin, I would argue, one finds an interior visibly marked by divine presence in a manner that is far closer to the word made flesh than any other devotional sculpture I can think of. It achieves this aim via the erasure and transcendence of 83. Georg Simmel, "Bridge and Door" trans. Mark Ritter, Theory, Culture &amp; Society 11, no. 1 (February 1994), pp. 8-9. Simmel's essay "Brucke unTur" first appeared in the Berlin newspaper Der Tag. 84. Simmel, p. 7. corporeal boundaries, distancing the Virgin Mary from all that is carnal and elemental, and aligning her with all that is sacred and sacramental. The inviolate body of the Holy Virgin, which once enclosed the infant Jesus for nine months, is revealed as a permeable shell, and Mary becomes a triptych providing humankind with access to the Christian mysteries. The sculpted body of the Vierge ouvrante disguises a portal that opens to reveal both an inner sanctuary and a pathway to inner sanctity. In the Gospel of John (1: 14), word takes on flesh and our Lord becomes our text; in the Triptych Virgin, flesh becomes narrative, and the Lord our destination. Appendix: Historical distribution of Triptych Virgins across Europe, 1250-1700 The checklist presents sculptures chronologically by site of origin (as known) followed by current location. The map indicates the original locations and motif types of Vierges ouvrantes produced between 1250 and 1700 (fig. A1). For example, sculptures 29 and 35, although now in Paris and Copenhagen, are mapped to the Baltic region. Works in the Americas and/or produced after 1700 are not mapped but are included in the checklist. Vierges ouvrantes, 1250-1700 1.
