Coastal or highland Guatemala, ca. AD 375-500. James Albert and Mary Gardiner Ford Memorial Fund. CMA 89.65. In 1989 the Museum acquired a rare carved slate disk, thought to have served as the backing for a polished pyrite mirror (Cover, Fig ures 1-2).' The intricate low relief scene on the slate disk is in the style of Teotihuacan, a famous pre-Columbian city northeast of Mex ico City. Now ruined, Teotihuacan was once the most populous city in Mesoamerica and its people exerted widespread political, economic, and artistic influence.2 In all likelihood, however, the Mu seum's mirror-back was manufactured at a Teotihuacan outpost far to the south, in Guatemala. The slate disk has two perforations at either side for suspension, probably from a cord or thong. The front (uncarved) surface is scored but retains no traces of polished pyrite or adhesive. An iron ore, pyrite can be polished to a shiny reflective finish. Layers of pyrite and slate sometimes occur together geologically, providing an ideal material for the manufacture of mirrors. Smaller pieces of pyrite were also cut and fitted together in pre-Columbian times to create reflective mosaics; these were then glued to slate backings. The Cleveland disk's carved back is covered with densely packed, de tailed imagery. Depicted in the center is a large, frontal figure wear ing a huge headdress, flanked by two smaller, profile figures. All three stand on a scalloped band on which small seashells appear. Encircling the scene are two borders: an inner border carved with starfish-like elements and an outer border with a series of wave-like curls. The imagery carved on the Cleveland mirror-back has great significance because it provides clues to long-overlooked aspects of religious practice in ancient Mesoamerica. Cults venerating the dead were important to households and lineages both at Teotihuacan and at its outposts in Guatemala. As discussed below, the Cleveland mirror-back scene represents either a funerary ceremony venerating a bundled corpse or a rite honoring an incense-burner effigy of the deceased.</page><page sequence="2">Figure 2. Diagram of Mirror-Back showing carved design and areas of restoration (CMA 89.65). Drawing by Ron Garrett Teotihuacan Before discussing the carved scene in detail, it is well to describe Teotihuacan and its place in Mesoamerican history. Located in the high Valley of Mexico, about forty-five kilometers northeast of modern Mexico City, Teotihuacan reached its height about AD 500 600. With a population of approximately 125,000 persons, it was the largest city in the Americas.3 The city is laid out on a grid-plan with a dominant North-South axis known as the Street of the Dead. To the north, this grand avenue terminates at the immense Pyramid of the Moon. On the east side of the Street of the Dead is the awe-inspiring Pyramid of the Sun (Figure 3), even today the second largest man Figure 3. View of Pyramid of the Sun, Teotihuacan.

CMA 63.252 made structure in the New World.4 The street itself is lined with ceremonial platforms and what may be administrative centers and residences of the elite. Most of Teotihuacan's population lived in enclosed multi-family dwellings known as apartment compounds. Much of the art for which the city is famous comes from them, including colorful frescoes which often decorate the walls of porticos adjoining court yards (Figure 4). Pottery figurines (Figure 5) and ornate pottery incense burners (Figure 6) probably played a role in household religious rituals. The serenely beautiful stone masks characteristic of Teotihuacan art (Figure 7) also may have been used in household ceremonies. The remains of many mirrors have been found at Teotihuacan. A slate disk 14 centimeters in diameter, with two pairs of holes near the rim for suspension, was found in a burial at the Zacuala apart ment compound. A layer of yellow material adhering to one of the disk's faces is probably all that remains of a reflective pyrite sur face.5 Small undecorated slate disks that could have served as mirror-backs were found at the summit of the Pyramid of the Sun,6 and pyrite disks are included in offering deposits beneath the Pyra mid of Quetzalcoatl.7 In addition, sacrificial victims interred during construction of the Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl were found with round slate disks located at the back of their waists.8</page><page sequence="4">4 329 Figure 5.

Photograph after Doris Heyden, "An Interpretation," p. 133. 0, Carved mirror-backs, however, are not commonly found at Teotihua can. Only two fragmentary examples (Figure 8) have been uncov ered in controlled archaeological excavations at that site; they were found in a tunnel-like natural cave located directly beneath the Pyramid of the Sun.9 Neither, however, is in the artistic style of the monuments and objects found at Teotihuacan. One is in a style gen erally considered typical of the Gulf Coast, while the other's frag mentary condition makes difficult the assignment of any style. Two Teotihuacan-style mirrors without archaeological prove nience are known. One fragmentary slate mirror-back in the collec tion of the American Museum of Natural History depicts a richly garbed profile figure carrying an incense bag (Figure 9). This frag ment reportedly comes from the state of Puebla in Mexico. The other mirror is decorated on its front (pyrite) surface with a rampant feline executed in stone and shell mosaic (Figure 10). Unlike those previ ously described, this mirror has a layer of highly reflective pyrite naturally bonded to a layer of slate.10This mirror is said to have been found in the state of Michoacan, Mexico. a OO</page><page sequence="5">330 Figure 9.

The Cleveland Mirror-Back and Teotihuacan Murals Both in subject matter and composition, the Museum's mirror-back is closely comparable to murals found on temple platforms and apartment compound walls at Teotihuacan. Border designs very similar to those on the mirror-back can be found at the Zacuala apartment compound, where they form a cartouche from which a __.A_ _&gt;-. t~ P~, 2 II .. .I.i</page><page sequence="6">1- M 1 331 Figure 12.

Photograph by Fernando Sanchez. water-deity emerges (Figure 1 1). The aquatic associations of the border's waves and starfish are appropriate to this god of rains and water. Scalloped bands filled with seashells (like that on which the disk's figures rest) appear in murals at the Temple of Agriculture. The three figures that comprise the mirror-back's main subject matter are analogous to mural compositions in which priests or celebrants approaching a central deity figure or cult image are depicted. The best-known mural of this type occurs at the Tepantitla apartment compound (Figure 12). In this elaborate scene a lavishly attired deity figure is approached by priests carrying bags of incense. Scrolls decorated with flowers and shells indicate prayers or chants, while sprouting streams adorned with jewels and seeds fall from the priests' hands. Larger than the priests, the masked deity figure stands with outstretched arms. Drops of liquid fall from the deity's hands, and streams of water pour from its mouth. It wears heavy jade jewelry and a huge feather headdress with a central bird's head. The undulating stems and branches of large flowering plants appear behind the deity figure. All three figures stand on upwelling waves of water filled with shells.</page><page sequence="7">332 Art historian Esther Pasztory has analyzed the Tepantitla mural in detail and concludes that the central deity figure represents an earth goddess, or bisexual creative deity, who is petitioned for rain, agricultural abundance, and wealth." Now generally accepted as female, this deity is frequently referred to as the Great Goddess.12 The mural goddess, Pasztory believes, is depicted as a cult object, or idol, rather than as an animate being. She notes that in similar fashion the later Aztecs made idols of corn-dough, then adorned them with the deity's identifying costume elements. The Museum's mirror-back (Figures 1-2) is closely related to the Tepantitla mural (Figure 12) in subject matter and composition. A comparison of the two works reveals striking similarities and some significant differences that are useful for interpreting the carved disk. The disk's small size inevitably restricts the number of figures and activities that can be depicted, while the circular format affects the positioning of the figures within the available space. Compared to the Tepantitla mural, the disk's figures stand on a simplified groundline. The scalloped band decorated with shells, however, conveys the same information as the elaborate waves in the mural, suggesting moisture and abundance.3 The plants growing on either side of the mural's priests and the large plants rising behind the deity figure are absent from the disk, perhaps due to space limitations. The profiled celebrant figures standing on either side of the disk's central image are lightly clothed in comparison to their counterparts in the Tepantitla mural. Each wears a loincloth, sandals, headdress, and jewelry. The figure on the right appears to wear an upper body garment, as indicated by his puffy sleeve. He also carries a plant stem staff with three pendant flowers. The celebrant on the left carries an incense bag in one hand and a staff that terminates in the head of a long beaked bird in the other. A scroll indicating prayer or song rises from the mouth of each of the disk's profile figures. The rubbery limbs and individualized depiction contrast with the rigid, repetitive celebrants of the Teotihuacan mural composition. To Pasztory, these traits suggest the Teotihuacan style of Guatemala, rather than that of Teotihuacan itself.'4 The imposing presence of the large frontal figure to whom these prayers are addressed dominates the mirror-back's composition. The eyes were probably once inlaid with pyrite, adding to the intensity of the figure's gaze. The mouth is covered by a butterfly-shaped plaque, and the face is framed on either side by two large round earplugs. The figure's magnificent headdress is larger than its body. The headdress element located immediately above the figure's face is a stylized butterfly. It can be identified by the close-set and fringed eyes, the curling central proboscis, and the tasseled antennae on either side of the proboscis. The elements on the outer sides of the antennae, in turn, may represent the butterfly's wings. Fanned out around the butterfly are long feathers, probably representations of brilliant green quetzal-bird plumes, which were highly prized by many Mesoamerican cultures.</page><page sequence="8">Figure 13. Cover for Incense Burner. Pottery, H. 45 cm, W. 42.9 cm, D. 30.5 cm. Escuintla, Guatemala, ca. AD 375 500. Andrew R. and Martha Holden Jennings Fund. CMA 69.25 The central figure's body, covered by fringed or feathered mate rial, is mound-like in form. Worn at the neck are three strands of beads; positioned in front of the body is a large fringed medallion. Set within this medallion is a sign consisting of three round dots above a moustache-like form resembling the mouth of Teotihuacan's water deity (usually given the Aztec name Tlaloc).15 By analogy with the Teotihuacan mural paintings described above, it is possible to interpret the carved scene on the mirror-back as two priests or celebrants offering worship to a deity or deity-image. A fuller understanding results, however, if the scene is compared to certain incense-burners, unearthed far to the south of Teotihuacan in the highlands and Pacific coast regions of Guatemala. Many of these incense-burners bear a striking resemblance to the mirror-back's central figure. Effigy Incense Burners In 1969 farmers in the Tiquisate region of Escuintla province in Guatemala accidentally uncovered tombs and caches containing numerous pottery incense burners (Figure 13).16 In both form and decoration these censers closely resemble incense burners from Teotihuacan (Figure 6), although certain stylistic features and iconographic themes serve to distinguish Mexican examples from Guatemalan specimens. Both Mexican and Guatemalan incense burners have an hourglass-shaped base, on which rests a conical lid from which a tubular chimney rises vertically. Although the bases 333</page><page sequence="9">334 Figure 14. Cover for Incense Burner. Pottery. Escuintla, Guatemala, ca. AD 375-500. Private collection. Photograph by Nicholas Hellmuth. are occasionally decorated with applied symbols, they are often plain; in many cases the undecorated bases were discarded so only the heavily ornamented lids now survive. Teotihuacan's composite incense burners were first manufactured around AD 200. A standard format was developed by AD 375 and was employed for approxi mately the next seventy-five years.17 The incense burners from Guatemala follow this standard format and are presumed to be contemporary or slightly later. Janet Berlo, an art historian who has studied incense burners from both Mexico and Guatemala, notes that the examples from central Mexico generally have a pottery mask directly affixed to the vertical chimney (Figure 6). This is surrounded by "an armature of clay slabs which are attached to the lid in front of the chimney, providing the backdrop to which adornos, or small badges and symbols, are affixed."18 The architectural appearance of the armature suggests a temple, while the mask resembles an icon within this shrine. The pressed clay adornos serve to elaborate the image both visually and symbolically. In contrast to the Mexican examples, the lids of most incense burners from Escuintla, Guatemala, are anthropomorphized-that is, the cone-shaped lid forms a human bust to which the mask on the chimney corresponds as a head (Figure 13). Arms frequently extend from the body to grasp implements, and the upper portion of the armature serves as a headdress. Pressed clay adornos decorate the armature, the figure, and sometimes the hourglass-shaped base.</page><page sequence="10">Figure 15. Cover for Incense Burner. Pottery. Escuintla, Guatemala, ca. AD 375-500. Private collection. Photograph by Nicholas Hellmuth. Considerable iconographic variation exists among the Escuintla incense burners, but one theme is extremely common: the butterfly. Incense burner headdresses are frequently ornamented with the fringed eyes, curled proboscis, and tasseled antennae of the butterfly (Figure 14). In some cases the headdress itself is represented as the upper jaw and face of a butterfly, with the fanged mouth fitting directly over the human head (Figure 15). (These incense burners may represent either a human being in butterfly disguise or a butter fly deity since the bodies usually have butterfly wings rather than hands.) The butterfly theme is reiterated by the plaques that often cover the mouths of the human faces and generally have the shape of a stylized butterfly (Figures 13-15). When the Museum's mirror-back scene (Figures 1-2) is compared to the butterfly-theme incense burners from Guatemala, an extraordi nary similarity is observable between the mirror's central deity or icon and the anthropomorphic censer lids (Figure 14). In each case, the simple, mound-like human body is smaller than the lavish, feather-decorated headdress. The mouth of the mask-like face is covered by a butterfly plaque, and one or two sets of round earplugs are worn. Strands of jewelry encircle the neck and a large round disk covers the chest. In the center of the headdress are butterfly insignia, framed by cascades of plumes. In sum, the similarity between the mirror's central image and the incense burner lids is so close that the one may in fact be a representation of the other; that is, the scene may depict two celebrants approaching an incense burner.19 335</page><page sequence="11">336 Figure 16.

Teotihuacan and Its Influence Up to this point, interpretation of the Museum's mirror-back has relied on purely visual evidence. Further investigation requires some knowledge of Mesoamerican history and the archaeological evi dence from which it derives. Teotihuacan has received considerable attention from archaeologists in the past seventy-five years, but the site is so vast (approximately twenty-one square kilometers, or eight square miles) that only a small fraction of the total area has been excavated. Teotihuacan was a small village until the first century BC, when its population grew rapidly to as much as 40,000. The new inhabitants abandoned other settlements in the Valley of Mexico, perhaps in order to construct the pyramids of the Sun and Moon,</page><page sequence="12">Figure 18. Bazan Stela. Alabaster.

Most of Teotihuacan's apartment compounds were constructed during the period AD 200 650. It is surmised that several related families occupied each compound. The dead were sometimes buried beneath the floors of the apartment compound in which they lived. According to archae ologist Sigvald Linne, the dead were usually buried in a squatting position, oriented north-south.20 In some cases the dead were cremated in the tomb.2' Pasztory notes that an important burial, perhaps that of a founding ancestor, is frequently associated with the earliest level of an apartment compound's construction.22 Among the offerings sometimes associated with Teotihuacan burials are the compound incense burners already described. As previously noted, the walls of Teotihuacan apartment com pounds are often decorated with murals (Figure 4). These, together with figurines and the images on pottery vessels, provide consider able information on the characteristic dress, ornaments, and accou terments of Teotihuacan's inhabitants. Individuals wearing the distinctive costume of Teotihuacan are represented in the art of many other Mesoamerican peoples after about AD 350. Such images occur at Tikal (Figure 16) and other lowland Maya sites in Peten, Guatemala, at Kaminaljuyu (a highland site near modern Guatemala City) (Figure 17), and at Monte Alban in Oaxaca (Figure 18). Teotihuacan's distinctive panel and slope architectural profile is even more widely distributed throughout Mesoamerica.23 Evidence of foreign contacts is also present at Teotihuacan itself, where enclaves of Oaxacans and possibly Gulf Coast natives have been discovered.24 It is clear from this evidence that the inhabitants of Teotihuacan were in contact with the peoples of many distant regions. Although the motivation for this contact is not yet clearly established, obtaining distant natural resources is the most commonly offered explanation. Mirrors in Guatemala Numerous mirrors with pyrite-mosaic reflective surfaces have been discovered in the highland and Pacific coast regions of Guatemala.25 In 1936-1942 archaeologists excavated many mirrors in the tombs of Kaminaljuyu, a site that has been interpreted by some as a Teotihua can colony, established to obtain resources such as cacao for the Mexican city.26 Contact between Kaminaljuyu and Teotihuacan is thought to have existed from AD 400 to 600.27 The excavations at 337</page><page sequence="13">338 ' _y '-" ' ..../,'k A N0' 9 (K~~ 0 :. o^ ~ ~ g) Skeleton A --- ----------------- -______kI \ ~ _ ~ I PH) eSkeletonD O~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~r.

Kaminaljuyu revealed two structures that incorporate Teotihuacan's characteristic panel and slope architectural profile.28 One impor tant function of these mounds was funerary: each structure was en larged and rebuilt several times, always following the burial of an important individual (Figure 19).29 The spectacular assortment of grave goods from these tombs include jade jewelry, obsidian blades, worked shell and bone, pottery vessels, and incense burners. In many of the tombs-dated from AD 400-55030-the heads or entire bodies of sacrificed individuals (usually adolescents) accompany the principal dead. As noted above, many pyrite-mosaic mirrors were also found in the tombs at Kaminaljuyu. All are round, with diameters ranging from 7.5 to 25 centimeters. All the mirrors consist of a thin slate disk backing to which a layer of polished pyrite is attached with adhe sive. Several have jade ornaments affixed to the front pyrite-covered surface. Alfred V. Kidder, Jesse D. Jennings, and Edwin M. Shook illustrate an example decorated with slate and jade roundels and</page><page sequence="14">Figure 20. Front and profile views of Pyrite-Mosaic Mirror.

The slate backings of some Kaminaljuyu mirrors are plain, but others are decorated with a variety of techniques. Several are covered by a layer of stucco and painted solid red; in three cases intricate Teotihuacan-style scenes or emblems are painted on the stucco (Figure 22).32 The composition of these painted designs resembles the Museum's carved mirror-back (Figures 1-2) with its central image surrounded by a decorative border.

The surface of one mirror-back from Kaminaljuyu is intricately carved in low relief (Figure 23).33 The plaque has two pairs of holes drilled through the slate near the right and left edges. Much of the disk's surface area is covered with complex, interlaced scrolls; at the center, two human figures face one another. Both gesture toward an hourglass-shaped vessel resting on a scrolled pedestal between them. Piled atop the vessel, which may be an incense burner base, are small rounded forms that perhaps represent copal, a resinous in cense. A plant-like form rises from this pile. Although this may</page><page sequence="16">Figure 25. Carved Plaque. Slate and red pigment, Diam. 15.4 cm. El Tajin area, Veracruz, Mexico, AD 750-950.

The left figure on the Kaminal juyu plaque may be holding such a staff behind the incense burner. Stylistically, the Kaminaljuyu pyrite-encrusted plaque resembles other carved disks ornamented with scrolls and human figures (Figures 8, 24-26). Besides the fragment from.Teotihuacan, two of these mirrors are reportedly from Veracruz (Figures 24-25) while another was supposedly found at Kaminaljuyu (Figure 26).35 Since similar scroll decoration is found on architecture at Tajfn and on stone sculpture from central Veracruz, this style is believed to have Figure 26.

Parsons suggests that Teotihuacan people encountered slate-backed mirrors in central Veracruz and incorporated this artifact type into their own material culture. They then carried this trait with them to Guatemala.37 Despite the differences in style, the Museum's carved disk and that excavated at Kaminaljuyu (Figure 23) may depict similar subjects: celebrants approaching an incense burner. While one incense burner is the anthropomorphic style known from Escuintla, the other is the simpler and more widely distributed hourglass form. The plant-like elements of both scenes suggest supplication for agricultural fertility. Two other carved mirror-backs with Teotihuacan related iconogra phy are known (Figures 27-28). Although neither was archaeologi cally excavated, both are believed (like the Museum's mirror-back) to have come from Guatemala. One of these slate mirror-backs depicts a single figure whose face occupies the center of the disk (Figure 27). On either side of the face are round pits, probably for inlaid ear ornaments. Above the face is a large headdress, orna mented with a central medallion and multiple plumes. Although badly damaged, the body still has jewelry and horizontal strips of</page><page sequence="18">Figure 28. Carved Mirror-Back. Slate with red, green, yellow, and white pigment, Diam. 19.7 cm.

To each side of the figure is a large, unidentified object. The upper portion of these objects resembles a headdress seen in profile.38 Although the subject matter of this disk is difficult to determine with certainty, the image is again reminiscent of pottery incense burners from Central Mexico and Guatemala (Figures 6, 13). The principal image on the other Guatemalan carved mirror-back (Figure 28) closely resembles designs on stuccoed and painted pottery vessels from Kaminaljuyu (Figure 1 7). Within a border of sectioned conch shells and triple drops appears a seated, profile figure. The elaborate costume includes a plumed, helmet-like headdress, ear ornaments, necklaces, some sort of upper body garment, wristlet, and sandals. Above the hip is a round disk and a feathered panache. In one hand, the figure holds an incense bag. In front of the seated figure are several large glyph-like symbols. The hybrid Teotihuacan-Maya style of the carving may suggest a local Maya artist working for a Teotihuacan patron. 343</page><page sequence="19">344 Funerary Practices and Ancestor Cults The archaeologically excavated tombs of Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala, provide data essential to interpretation of the Cleveland mirror-back. The occupants of these tombs were buried in a seated, upright position and were adorned with jewelry, mirrors, and probably textiles. Thus prepared, the dead must have closely resembled effigy incense-burners; probably such corpses were in fact the model for this kind of incense-burner. The burning of incense was an important component of funerary ceremony at Kaminaljuyu and most likely occurred at rites honoring the ancestral dead. The scene carved on the Cleveland mirror-back is a representation of just such rites. In all but the two earliest of the tombs excavated at Kaminaljuyu, the principal corpse was buried in a seated, cross-legged position (Fig ure 19). According to the excavators, several (perhaps all) of the seat ed primary corpses were interred inside a wooden box or enclosure of some sort that protected the corpse from the tomb's fill. Most of the sacrificial victims were also buried in a seated position, but it is unclear whether they were protected by wooden enclosures as well. Figure 29. Cover for Incense-Burner. Pottery. Escuintla, Guatemala, ca. AD 375-500. Private collection. Photograph by Nicholas Hellmuth.</page><page sequence="20">Pyrite encrusted plaques were buried with both principal tomb occupants and with their sacrificed companions; some were found on the tomb floor, rather than in direct association with the dead. Most commonly, the disks were found in the lap of the principal deceased, where they would have fallen if worn over the breast. Sometimes two or even three disks were found in the lap of the same individual. Smaller disks, found near the knees, may have fallen from the shoulders or from a headdress. In one especially large, rich tomb, two of the adolescent companions wore pyrite encrusted plaques at the small of their backs (Figure 19). One of these is the elaborately carved specimen already described (Figure 23).39 As noted above, sacrificial victims at Teotihuacan were found with slate disks in the same position. Similarly, living individuals in Teotihua can costume were often depicted wearing such disks (Figures 16, 17, 28), some of which represent mirrors.40 The positioning of mirrors at the breast of the seated principal corpses at Kaminaljuyu strongly recalls the round disks usually seen in this same position on Escuintla anthropomorphic incense burner lids. That some of the disks worn in this position on incense burners do indeed represent mirrors is confirmed by the roundels and flares in their decoration (Figure 29) that closely resemble a jade and pyrite encrusted disk from Kaminaljuyu (Figure 21). Mica at the center of some of these incense burner disks suggests the glittering surface of polished pyrite.41 The ornamental disks on the headdresses of incense burner figures may also represent mirrors. Some are inlaid with pyrite, while many have borders like those of the larger disks worn over the chest. Often the borders of disks on incense burners resemble the borders of the butterfly eyes in the headdresses. An equivalence between the insect's reflective eye and the shiny polished pyrite is implied.42 Disks worn over the chest are not the only similarities between Kaminaljuyu's seated corpses and the anthropomorphic incense burners of Escuintla. Like the incense burners, the bodies usually wear strands of beads at the neck, as well as ear-flare assemblages. Some corpses have double pairs of ear-flares, as do some of the incense burners. Decayed organic materials and fragments of painted stucco are all that remain of other costume elements or burial wrappings. 345</page><page sequence="21">346 Figure 30. Mask.

CMA 42.1094 Unfortunately, many details of a corpse's preparation for burial at Kaminaljuyu cannot be ascertained from the archaeological evi dence. The body may have been simply dressed and adorned before placement in the tomb or swathed in textiles to form a bundle. In the latter case perhaps a wooden mask (like the stone masks from Teotihuacan (Figures 7, 30) was placed over the face. Kaminaljuyu's archaeologists note evidence that some of the tombs were left unfilled for a time after the bodies and their offerings were in place.43 In all likelihood the dressed and bedecked corpse remained unburied for several days before and after its placement in the tomb, while ceremonies for the deceased were performed. Bowls of ashes placed in the tombs and in their fill indicate that the burning of incense and possibly other offerings played a role in the ceremonies. As noted above, the funerary practices of Kaminaljuyu, Guate mala, have considerable relevance to the interpretation of the Museum's mirror-back. The similarity of the mirror's central figure to the Escuintla incense burners has already been noted. The Escuintla incense burner figures are now seen to resemble the corpses, pre pared for burial, of important individuals at Kaminaljuyu. Perhaps, then, the scene on the Museum's mirror-back depicts the funeral ceremonies for an important Teotihuacan-affiliated personage. If the Escuintla incense burner lids represent seated, adorned corpses, then they may have been used in funeral ceremonies or venerated as cult objects after the entombment.</page><page sequence="22">Although none of the Escuintla anthropomorphic incense burners was archaeologically excavated (and thus we can only speculate about their use), a funerary function is likely for the similar compos ite incense burners of Teotihuacan. Some have been found in tombs or associated with apartment compound altars.44 According to Berlo: "They seem to have had particular importance in household and apartment compound ritual, where they probably functioned as icons for religious practices involving members of a common line age, clan or cult group."45 These religious practices are very likely to have venerated the clan's ancestral dead, with incense burners serving as effigies of the ancestral corpses.46 The masks at the center of the incense burners represent the idealized countenances of the deceased, who have now joined the ancestors. In many cultures, both ancient and modern, the ancestors are revered by their descen dants and entreated for help in a wide range of worldly matters. Berlo has discussed at length the butterfly imagery so prevalent on incense burners from both Teotihuacan and Guatemala.47 For the later Aztecs, the butterfly was a symbol of a dead person's soul. As Berlo notes, the Aztecs made dough idols representing mummy bundles and decorated them with butterfly soul symbols.48 This practice is closely analogous to the earlier rites postulated for Teotihuacan and Guatemala, in which incense burners (modeled on corpses prepared for burial) were decorated with pressed-clay adornos and used as ancestral cult objects. Teotihuacan's stone masks may have also played a role in funerary ritual or ancestor cults (Figure 30). George Kubler suggests that the masks were affixed to mummy-bundles;49 Pasztory suggests "a more likely explanation is that they were attached to something like a wooden armature to form a figure or bust."50 Dressed in textiles and adorned with feathers and jewelry, such figures were highly valued cult objects, she believes. The cult objects postulated by Pasztory may well have been used in rituals honoring the ancestors, and their form may have resembled the mummy-bundles suggested by Kubler. Much household or apartment compound ritual at Teotihuacan probably focused on the dead, the ancestors. The lack of true por traiture in either the stone masks or the incense burner masks does not in any way contradict their use as effigies of the dead. Many (if not most) cultures depict the ancestral dead according to idealized conventions. 347</page><page sequence="23">348 In interpreting the Museum's carved mirror-back, the visual links between the carved scene and mural painting at Teotihuacan have been traced, and the similarity of the mirror's central figure to mural cult images has been noted. The carved central figure has also been compared to anthropomorphic incense burner lids from Escuintla and corpses prepared for burial at Kaminaljuyu. Household ritual focusing on the dead and the ancestors has been suggested for Teotihuacan and is likely to have been transferred to Teotihuacan's foreign outposts in Guatemala. Seemingly, the cult took on a more public role in Kaminaljuyu, where important individuals were buried in public structures, rather than in private residences.51 Berlo has suggested that Teotihuacan-style incense burners in Guatemala were used in the worship of a butterfly-warrior goddess.52 But as we have seen, Mesoamerican deities can be depicted as cult objects (incense burners, dough idols) and these cult objects reflect the form of the dead prepared for burial. Reverence for the dead was an integral part of religious belief, and it may be incorrect to draw a rigid distinction between deities and ancestors. Thus, the anthropomorphic incense burner lids and the central image on the Museum's mirror-back can be interpreted at three levels: as corpses prepared for burial, as cult objects, and as deities. The Museum's mirror-back illuminates Teotihuacan religion because it can be understood both according to its function and by the scene carved on its back. Functionally, the mirror-back served as a funerary offering in a Guatemalan tomb, perhaps that of a Teo tihuacan native living in that region. It may well have been placed over the breast of the wrapped and adorned corpse. The scene carved on the mirror-back depicts funerary or ancestral rites: the veneration of either the bedecked corpse itself or an incense burner effigy of such a corpse. The mirror-back's carved decoration thus directly reflects its use. In a sense, both of the plaque's surfaces were mirrored: the polished pyrite face captured the fleeting image of events as they took place, while on the carved back is a permanent, idealized reflection of the religious rites.

Mesoamerica, or Middle America, is a region that encompasses much of ancient Mexico and Central America. This region was unified in ancient times by a complex of shared cultural traits, including agri culture based on the cultivation of maize, squash, and beans; a unique ball game played with a rubber ball on special courts; a 260-day ritual calendar; and religious rituals in which blood sacrifice was emphasized. 3.
