Limestone, painted Gift of Norbert Schimmel, 1985 1985.3 28.I-24 Two Girls at Court. 1985.328.6 The relief blocks from Tell el Amarna, the site of the royal residence of King Akhenaton for the greater part of his reign (about 1379-1362 B.C.), comprise an artistic corpus of unparalleled significance, not only because they were carved during one of the most controversial periods of Egyptian history, but because they provide a key to the understanding of the intimate interrelationship of Egyptian art and religion. Following Norbert Schimmel's donation of a single relief block four years ago, his magnanimous gift of twenty-four additional Amarna reliefs-the finest such collection in private hands-represents an acquisition of historic import for the Department of Egyptian Art, as the unorthodox tendencies of Akhenaton's floruit are evident everywhere in the Schimmel reliefs. Motivated by religious convictions bizarre by Egyptian standards, Akhenaton dedicated a strip of desert along the Nile for the adoration of his personal deity, the Aton, to be worshiped not in its traditional anthropomorphic form but in its physical manifestation: the disk of the sun. He built an entire city-complete with sprawling temple complexes and residential areas-in this barren location, within the brief span of his reign, its construction hastened by the use of portable blocks of stone in place of massive stone elements. In their uniform configuration and relatively small size, the Amarna reliefs betray their origin in this innovative and piecemeal architecture. At the same time, the individual stones that have survived the passage of thirty-three centuries provide little more than tantalizing glimpses into the religious rituals and court life that were once depicted in grand scale on the walls of Akhenaton's monuments. The king's religious revolution was unprecedented in its sanctioned worship of only one god; furthermore, Akhena- ton commingled elements of divinity and royalty in his rituals and on his monuments, thereby challenging the most funda- mental beliefs of his subjects concerning the nature of divine rule. As if inadequate to express these theological inventions, the old artistic norms were cast aside in favor of a more dynamic and experimental idiom-one typified by blatant propaganda in support of Akhenaton's new theology and by a heightened sensibility to natural and human forms. Much of the interest of the Schimmel reliefs lies in their startling divergences from the traditions prescribed by age- old usage. In a fragmentary offering scene, An Act of Wor- ship, intended to commemorate the timeless endurance of the Aton cult, Akhenaton drops an object, perhaps a lump of fat, onto a table of offerings; yet, the sense of an elusive moment suffuses the relief, in which the thumb and forefinger of the hand are barely parted and the fat is still in midair. The carefully articulated joints of the fingers-a contrast to the rounded fleshiness of the hand-impart to the king's languid gesture a quality that is not inconsistent with his relationship Entry by Peter F.

This official intimacy extends to representations of the royal family--often carved on stelae for the celebration of the Aton cult-in which Akhenaton and Nefertiti embrace their daughters or dandle them on their laps. In the relief Two Girls at Court, the young princesses share a tender moment, the elder having just brushed aside her sister's heavy tresses to curl a hand over her bare shoulder, while the younger one responds with a trusting upward glance and a gentle touch to the elbow. Notable for the experimental full frontal modeling of the elder girl's swelling breasts, the scene also exhibits in muted fashion some of the hallmarks of the art of Akhenaton's reign: elongated skulls, prognathous jaws, facial wrinkles, and attenuated propor- tions. Manifest everywhere is an obsession with realism and detail that lends a refreshing liveliness to the Schimmel Amarna reliefs. Large-scale processional scenes were often sur- rounded with peripheral vignettes of fawning attendants, running soldiers, or prancing horses yoked to chariots- all of which afforded the artist a context for both clever observation and anecdotal comment. The relief of Foreigners in a Procession shows the heads of four marching figures, their arms raised in echelon to hold standards aloft in a purely formal gesture. Their faces, however, are carved in high relief, creating an unusual sense of depth, and the variant details of hair and facial modeling lend an individual quality to each man. On other relief blocks, wild animals galloping in the desert are rendered with an exuberance seldom equaled in Egyptian art, and heavy heads of wheat and bunches of ripe fruit-as in Grapes on the Vine-contrast with the delicate tracery of their own vegetation. In the years following Akhenaton's death, his residence was abandoned and the traditional religion restored. While certain characteristics of his artistic heritage passed into the permanent repertoire of Egyptian art, the temples of the Aton were razed and the blocks of stone reused as construction fill by the Ramesside kings, primarily in their temples at Her- mopolis on the opposite bank of the Nile, where many reliefs were recovered in the 1930s. The significance of Akhenaton's reign remains an intensely debated issue in Egyptological literature. Through the generosity of Norbert Schimmel, the Museum has received a magnificent legacy from antiquity, the full extent of which is as yet unexplored.
