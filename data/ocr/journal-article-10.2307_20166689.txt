The use of the cap as a status symbol has persisted until recent times among various Kongo peoples (Kikongo, Mboma, Nzadi, Solongo, Sundi, Vili, Yombe, and others). Many of these caps have been collected by Western explorers and are now in European and American museums. They are not only important ethnographic specimens but evidence of the extraordinary workmanship and sensibility of form of Kongo craftsmen. The cap in Kikongo is called mpu or pu. In the second volume of his monumental study, The Kongo, Kurt Laman published a drawing of a Sundi cap with the name of mpu-yakimfumu, which means "cap of the great chief"; Albert Massen registered the name pwangolo, from pu = "cap" and ngolo = "power." Both names, then, contain the notion of power. In 1977 Gordon D. Gibson and Cecilia R. McGurk published an important study titled "High-Status Caps of the Kongo and Mbundu Peoples," which explores the historical and ethnographic questions surrounding the caps. Examining twelve caps from three American museums, and presumably collected in this century, the authors detail how the caps are made: With regard to the techniques of construction, various authors speak of the caps as being woven, knitted, crocheted, braided, plaited, sewn, and done in lacework or in macram?. Though the work may have a superficial resemblance to fabrics made by one or another of these techniques, none of these terms accurately and precisely describes it. Close examination of the Kongo and Mbundu caps in three museum collections shows that all were constructed in spiral form, working from the center out to the edge. Most are made from a single strand of thread or string that doubtless was added to as the work progressed. After starting with a small central ring as a foundation, the construction proceeds by successively passing the free end of the strand over a portion of the preceding row and advancing with each pass. The stitch employed at each pass varies from cap to cap, and often also within the same cap, in some cases consisting of overhand knots and in others of more or less complex knotless loops. It is clear that the work cannot properly be called "knitted" or "crocheted," for in these two techniques it is not the end of the strand that is worked but rather a loop formed in the strand that is hooked through a loop of the preceding row in the growing fabric, while the end of the strand remains at rest. The distinction between looping and knotting on the one hand and hooked work such as knitting and crocheting on the other is fundamental.2 From both iconographie and literary sources, the authors are able to indicate how ancient was the use by the Kongo of caps made from fibers, with geometrical patterns. I believe that their documentation and their iconography should be enriched with data recorded by early travelers and by the publication of some of the more outstanding examples. I also believe ? and such is the purpose of this note ? that the antiquity of these objects should be demonstrated beyond any possible doubt by publishing a group of caps in various European collections, some of which go back as far as the second half of the seventeenth century. To begin with I shall give a list of these artifacts. * * * The first, 18 cm in height, appears in the Danish National Museum in Copenhagen under the inventory number EDc 123. It is mentioned for the first time in the 1674 catalog of the Kunstkammer, the king of Denmark's collection, as "a cap of bast"; it appears again in a 1737 inventory, under the same heading and with the same place of origin, together with "three East 1. Until the arrival of the Portuguese, the Kingdom of Kongo and the subject states of Loango, Ngoyo, Angola, and Ndongo, inhabited by Bantu peoples, covered the vast region on both sides of the Congo River as far as the Stanley Pool. Today this region is divided between the Popular Republic of Congo, Zaire, and Angola. When the Europeans came, this vast empire was split up, and the subject states freed themselves from the authority of the Manikongo (this was the name of the king), but they kept both their language, Kikongo, and the imprint of a common culture. 2.

The royal Danish collection is among old European collections the richest in African artifacts. King Frederick III laid its foundations, and it expanded in 1665 with the contribution of the famous Museum Wormianum (founded in 1620 by the naturalist Orlaus Worm as a prop to his university lectures). In 1751 the Dukes of Gottorp's rich collection, begun in 1649 by a cousin of the king of Denmark, Friedrich of Schleswig-Holstein, was added to the king's Kuntskammer after Denmark's victory over the duchy in the Northern War (1700-1721 ). A second cap, 21 cm in height, now in the Museo Preistorico Etnogr?fico "Luigi Pigorini" in Rome, belonged probably to the Museo Kircheriano, created in 1650 in the Jesuits' Collegio Romano. The museum was named after Father Athanasius Kircher, its founder and first curator (front inside cover). This artifact was mentioned in the Pigorini inventory in 1881 under the number 5423, with the gloss "a cap of palm-leaf thread with embroideries, Angola," as part of the collection of Pellegrino Matteucci. This, however, is doubtful: Matteucci accompanied Romolo Gessi in a number of explorations during the last quarter of the nineteenth century, through Ethiopia and equatorial regions of the Sudan, whence he brought back to the Roman museum a small collection of ethnographic items, but he never visited the Lower Congo or Angola. This 1881 inventory consisted of objects presented or sold by explorers who had traveled through the Nile regions during the second half of the last century Figure 3. Yombe chief wearing a fiber cap.

The list included scattered items from the Museo Kircheriano, which has been taken over by the Italian state after the annexation of Rome in 1870 and the confiscation of ecclesiastic possessions. It is possible, therefore, that the compiler of the catalog made a mistake, attributing to the Matteucci collection an item derived from the Kircheriano. A "cap of palm-leaf thread" appears, in fact, under the number 129 in a Nota degli oggetti preistorici ed etnograf?a consegnati al sottoscritto (Luigi Pigorini) dalla Direzione del Museo Kircheriano del Collegio Romano, e collocati net Museo Preistorico ed Etnogr?fico dello stresso Collegio, with the date of November 1876 and the signature of Luigi Pigorini, Curator of the Prehistoric and Ethnographic Museum, which was to be named after him.4 It appears from this document that the cap came from Brazil, since it is listed in a group of artifacts originating in that country. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility of an error in the Nota. It is certain that the Kircheriano owned antique Kongo artifacts: to be precise, eight raffia pile cloths, which reached the Pigorini very likely at the same time as the cap. Four of these cloths were mentioned in the catalog, drawn up by Father Filippo Bonanni in 1709,5 of the Jesuits' museum. Yet the same author, in a manuscript of 1716 (in which he describes the objects in the museums), never mentions any African items: he only describes the contents of a cupboard no. 24 as "various fabrics of palm leaves and reeds from various Indian countries, used for clothing."6 Possibly Bonanni confused under a single heading American and African fabrics, and Figure 4.

The same confusion had occurred with the items of the Copenhagen Museum in the inventory of 1737.7 A third cap, 19 cm in height, is in the Staatliches Museum f?r V?lkerkunde in Munich under the inventory number 873. It entered the ethnographic collection of the Bavarian State in 1858 with the rest of the collection of the Dukes of Leuchtemberg (related to the reigning house of the Wittelsbach), assembled in the first half of the nineteenth century and especially rich in artifacts from the Arctic and Antarctic regions.8 Unfortunately we do not know where or when the object was collected (back inside cover). Two more caps appear in the collections of the Museum f?r V?lkerkunde in Berlin. The first, 28 cm in height, is number 111 C382 in the inventory and was collected in 1874 by Adolf Bastian (back cover). The second, also 28 cm in height, is number 111 C6332 in the inventory and was bought in 1896 (fig. 1). European and American museums may have other caps collected long ago or, at any rate, of antique origin. The five I have mentioned are, however, the only ones that have come to my knowledge. The Mus?e Royal de l'Afrique Centrale in Tervuren has probably the richest collection of Kongo caps: twenty in all, but collected in this century. As an example we illustrate a cap collected by Leo Bittremieux before 1922 in the Kangu province of Mayombe (fig. 2). Bittremieux himself, in his article "Van een ouden blinden hoofdam" (1923),9 published an interesting photograph of a chief (in situ) wearing the cap (fig. 3). * * * These caps are elaborate artifacts. If we compare the Copenhagen and Tervuren examples, collected at an interval of three hundred years, we find that shape and Figure 6. Design on the Mezin armlet, Aurignacian period. 19 cm.

But from this absence we cannot conclude that the artifact was not yet in the museum at this date.

The patterns, consisting mostly of meanders, swastikas, and interwoven lozenges, belong clearly to Kongo representational tradition. We find them also, isolated or combined, in a series of ivory horns, cloths, baskets, mats, and caps as well as on anthropomorphic wooden sculptures, which leaves no doubt that they are the work of artisans and craftsmen of the same culture (fig. 4). It is almost certain that these patterns were developed before the Portuguese arrived in 1482. This is substantiated by two ivory horns, carved in low relief, which reached Europe at the outset of the sixteenth century and once belonged to the Medici10 (fig. 5).The formal perfection of these horns (and of three more in old European collections, which, on account of their similarity, can be attributed to the same period) and the assuredness of the complex design prove that this art, having already reached a pinnacle at the time of contact, was the product of a long refinement.11 That the traditional Kongo decorative patterns have persisted down to our time (or nearly) is evident in the scarifications carved on a group of very fine "maternities" in wood (fig. 7) collected in this century12 Figure 7.

It is well to remember that the meander, or angular spiral, is a very ancient motif shared by many civilizations. The most primitive example I know of is the decoration engraved on the mammoth ivory bracelet discovered in the prehistoric Aurignacian excavation of Mezin in Crimea: the design has already evolved to perfection. On this subject one should read the exciting and clarifying study devoted to this artifact by Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti in his recent book, L'uomo cosciente (Bologna, 1980), pp. 222-27. 12. E.

By this I do not mean to imply that Kongo art is petrified; I mean only that the need to do something new at all costs, so typical of our culture, was unknown in African society. The persistence of the same motifs does not signify, however, that Kongo artists did nothing but copy. Although respect of tradition may hamper originality, remember that no two artifacts are identical, even when they come from the same hand, and that artists apply traditional patterns in new and varying ways. * * * The surface of the cap is usually divided into three decorated fields: the top (where the craftsman begins), worked in concentric circles; the sides, on which the main pattern unfolds; and the terminal band, of varying breadth, worked in horizontal stripes. The central pattern consists of continuous meanders and zigzag bands formed by parallel stripes varying in length, thickness, and design, completed by triangular elements, some filled with diagonal design, some with a zigzag pattern. The cap in Copenhagen is an exception: the triangles have a plain surface on which cruciform patterns stand out in high relief (front cover). The cap in the Roman museum differs from the standard form in its larger top and missing bottom stripe; the main decorative motif is also simpler, consisting of small plaits that define three square spaces, edged and plain on the inner surface, on which an S in relief stands out like an eschutcheon of sorts (front inside cover). In the Copenhagen and Roman caps, the design is more complex but clearly evident in its transparent geometry and rhythmic order, the work of virtuosi with perfect control of their technique. The rhythmic complexity and, at the same time, the clarity of the pattern are obviously the result of a carefully thought out plan, all the more remarkable since the African craftsmen never worked with the aid of a sampler or according to any other graphically recorded scheme. The repetition of the geometrical elements and their perfect distribution over the surface of a truncated cone prove that the forms had been assimilated and fixed in the memory and visual interpretation of the craftsmen, and that the creation itself was a perfectly controlled operation, not casual, haphazard, or, even less, irrational. * * * Let us now examaine the written testimony, published and in manuscript, that we find in early reports about the Congo and Angola. In Asia, the monumental work by Jo?o de Barros (the first edition appeared in Lisbon, in 1552), we read that "the king had on his head a cap as tall as a miter, made of very fine and delicate palm-leaf cloth, with decorations in relief and cut down, similar to the velvet in our country."13 This description ? made in connection with the King's reception of the Portuguese ambassadors, headed by Ruy de Sousa, on 19 January 1490 (note the date!) ? fits perfectly our caps. The same cap is mentioned, for the first time with the Kikongo name of mpu, in an anonymous manuscript (perhaps written, according to some scholars, by Bras Correa, who was the king of Congo's confessor from 1612 to 1626): the "Historia do Reino do Congo," a copy of which is in the National Library in Lisbon. In describing the same reception, the author writes that the king wore "on his head a cap of palm-leaf threads called ampu, finely woven."14 In 1590 Andrew Battel, an English sailor who spent many years in the Congo and Angola and who was later captured by the Portuguese off the coast of Brazil, wrote that the men of Loango (once subjects of the king of Congo) "are never idle for they make fine caps of needlework as they go in the streets," suggesting a rather curious atmosphere for this African city at the end of the fifteenth century.15 Samuel Braun, the German traveler who visited Loango a few years later (in 1612), confirms that the production of these caps was reserved exclusively for 13.

These, at the moment of their investiture, "received insignia consisting of a cap, more or less richly decorated according to their rank" as well as a scimitar, a standard, and a carpet.17 This tradition is confirmed in the Diary of a Mission to the Congo of Father Andrea de Pav?a, who was in the Congo and Angola from 1687 to 1692. Father Andrea writes that the new dignitary ("mani, general captain, or other rank"), having first received from the sovereign the confirmation of his rank, "leaves the court and makes ready to receive the cap with which the prince has the 16.

To receive it, they must offer the king a beautiful, or better, a very valuable offering."18 John Barbot, in a summary of news of the Congo derived from different sources, confirms the use of a cap as distinguishing the kings and the nobles: "The king commonly wears a white cap on his head; as do the nobility that are in favour; and this is so eminent a token thereof, that if he is displeased at any of them, he only causes his cap to be taken off from his head; for that white cap is a cognizance of nobility: there as in Europe every order has a peculiar badge to distinguish it."19 Barbot also draws up a list of professionals producing various artifacts, among them "cap makers," suggesting that there was a corporation of highly specialized craftsmen, which would explain the perfection of the artifacts that have reached us. As to the visual documents, the most valuable are the drawings illustrating a collection of manuscripts by Father Giovanni Antonio Cavazzi, better known as the Manoscritti Araldi, from the name of the family who currently owns it. This is not the manuscript of the work mentioned above, which was published in Bologna in 1687; it is a yet unpublished report on the activities of Franciscan missions (the famous "Mission Antiqua") to the Congo. The collection consists of three paper volumes in a seventeenth-century binding, discovered and described by the Modena scholar Giuseppe Pistoni in 1969 and distinguished by the letters A, B, and C. The first of these manuscripts is especially precious from an ethnographic point of view because it contains a series of colored and black and white drawings on African subjects, executed in Africa by an unknown artist, perhaps a monk of the same brotherhood as Father Giovanni Antonio's. A dedication concluding Codex B is dated "Matamba, at the Court of Queen Ginga, in the year MDCLXV." As far as I know, these are the earliest iconographie documents produced in situ, with living models and hence presumably true to life; they are certainly more reliable than the illustrations in published reports, sketched in Europe and sprung from a more or less fantastic interpretation of the text. In two plates, practically identical (figs. 9, 10), we see the portrait of the man whom the missionary calls "the 18.

The sovereign wears a cap that (in one of the illustrations) closely resembles both in shape and decoration the caps reproduced above.20 A third drawing in the Manoscritti Araldi is extraordinary: a man playing a longa (the double percussion bell) stands at the center of a cannibalistic scene following a battle, gazing back at a crucifix laid on the ground. According to the text, the scene represents the dream of a general, perhaps the bell player himself, reprimanded for his excesses. The bell player / military commander wears a soft cap decorated with horizontal stripes. Although the cap is shorter than those in the preceding drawings, it may be the kind of cap discussed here. To conclude: of these caps we wonder whether we should admire more the quality of the craftsmanship, the formal perfection, or the richness in variation, all equally remarkable. They thus constitute a reminder of what Franz Boas taught us already half a century ago, that "virtuosity in technique and artistic productivity go hand in hand." 20. These two drawings served as models for the engraving of the same subject in work published by Cavazzi. In the engraving, however, the cap is drawn with less precision of detail. The same can be said of the plates illustrating scenes of the Loango court in the volume by the Dutchman Olfert Dapper, reproduced in Gibson and McGurk's study. See O.
