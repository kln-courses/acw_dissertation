<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Philosophical Quarterly Volume 25, Number 4, October 1988 CAUSATION, COMPULSION, AND COMPATIBILISM Paul Russell TN this paper I will be concerned to examine cer -^ tain salient features of the influential compati bilist position which is widely associated with the views of Thomas Hobbes, David Hume and various other leading figures of the empiricist tra? dition. The arguments which these philosophers have marshalled in defence of the compatibilist po? sition constitute what I shall refer to as the traditional or orthodox "empiricist-compatibilist strategy." The historical and contemporary significance of the empiricist-compatibilist strategy has recently been described by John Searle in the following terms: One would think that after 2000 years of worrying about it, the problem of the freedom of the will would by now have been finally solved. Well, actually most philosophers think it has been solved. They think it was solved by Thomas Hobbes and David Hume and various other empirically-minded philosophers whose solutions have been repeated and improved right into the twentieth century.1 It is, I think, a matter of some debate whether or not the majority of contemporary philosophers believe that Hobbes and Hume have provided us with a "solution" to the free will problem. How? ever, there can be no doubt that a number of con? temporary philosophers do take the view that an adequate solution to the free will problem lies along the lines that Hobbes and Hume pursued.2 Clearly, then, to the extent that the empiricist-compatibilist strategy continues to enjoy some degree of influ? ence among contemporary philosophers, so to that extent it continues to be of some contemporary, as well as historical, philosophical interest. Throughout this paper I will be concerned with the major features of the empiricist-compatibilist strategy as it is generally understood.3 In this re? spect, therefore, I am simply taking for granted the account of the empiricist-compatibilist strategy which is current in the contemporary literature on this subject. This account of the empiricist compatibilist strategy presupposes that we may interpret the philosophers in this tradition as pur? suing a common strategy.4 It is important to empha? size in this context that the accuracy of such inter? pretations is not my concern. Accordingly, in order to circumvent any problems of detailed exegesis I will base my discussion around my own account of what I take to be a standard interpretation of the empiricist-compatibilist strategy. The empiricist-compatibilist strategy falls, essentially, into two distinct stages of argument. Historically speaking, the first stage was initiated by Hobbes and the second stage was initiated by Hume. The first stage, which I shall refer to as the "compulsion argument" seeks to describe the gen? eral significance of the distinction between causa? tion and compulsion for the "free will" dispute. The second stage of the empiricist-compatibilist strategy, which I shall refer to as the "regularity argument," endeavours to reconstruct the compul? sion argument on the foundation of the regularity theory of causation. My primary concern in this paper will be to examine the relation between these two stages of the empiricist-compatibilist strategy. Proponents of this strategy claim that the regularity argument strengthens the compatibilist position. I will argue, on the contrary, that the regularity argu? ment generates serious difficulties for the compul? sion argument and that it therefore weakens the compatibilist position. In this way I will be con? cerned to show that the traditional empiricist-com? patibilist strategy suffers from significant internal tensions and that these tensions indicate that the regularity theory of causation does not serve as a particularly secure or congenial metaphysical foun? dation upon which to rest the compatibilist position as it is generally understood. I Let me begin by describing the basic structure of the two stages of the compatibilist strategy. The 313</page><page sequence="2">314 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY compulsion argument seeks to show that there is in fact no incompatibility between, on the one hand, an action being caused or determined and, on the other hand, that action being a free action for which the agent may be held responsible. Freedom, it is argued, is opposed not to determinism or causal necessity but rather to compulsion. Free actions are those which are caused by our desires or willings. In these circumstances the agent is connected to his actions through his willings. Responsibility for action depends on the existence of some such causal link between the agent and his actions. Without any such causal link or connection between the agent and his actions it would be impossible to attribute the actions to the agent.5 By contrast, an action which is unfree is brought about by "exter? nal" causes rather than by the agent's will. In these circumstances, the agent is forced or compelled to act and therefore he is not responsible for his actions.6 In short, the compatibilist seeks to estab? lish that free action is to be distinguished from unfree actions, not by an absence of cause, but rather by a different type of cause.7 We are respon? sible for our actions in virtue of the fact that it is our willings or desires which produce or bring about our actions. So described, the "compulsion argument" in? volves two important conditions - one "positive" and the other "negative". The positive condition requires that a free or responsible action must be one to which the agent is "linked" or "connected" through his willings or desires. This condition is a positive requirement of freedom and responsibility in so far as in the absence of this requirement the agent cannot be said to produce or bring about his actions at all. That is to say, without the appropriate causal link between the agent and his actions such actions simply "happen to" or "befall" the agent: they are not his. The negative condition requires that a free or responsible action be one which was not compelled or constrained by "external" forces. This condition is "negative" in so far as it is con? cerned to establish that in the presence of such compelling or constraining external forces the agent cannot be said to be acting freely and, therefore, cannot be responsible for the action in question. In this way, according to the compatibilist, in order to determine whether or not the agent is acting freely we must first identify the nature of the cause of his actions (i.e. were his actions the product of his own will?). Clearly, then, the fundamental distinc? tion drawn by the compulsion argument between causation and compulsion serves as the basis of the compatibilist's account of the relevant "positive" and "negative" conditions of freedom and respon? sibility. This general argument, whatever its merits or inadequacies, constitutes the first stage of the empiricist-compatibilist strategy.8 The second stage of the compatibilist strategy, the regularity argument, was first put forward and developed by Hume (Treatise, II, iii, 1-2). Hume, according to the orthodox interpretation of his po? sition, sought to reconstruct the overall compatibil? ist strategy by placing the compulsion argument on the foundation of the regularity theory of causation. The regularity theory maintains that the causal re? lation must be understood in terms of a regular succession or constant conjunction of like objects (i.e., objects resembling the cause followed by ob? jects resembling the effect). Beyond this regularity we discover no further "tie" or "necessary connec? tion" between cause and effect. That is to say con? sidered on its own we can discover no "power," "force," or "agency" in any cause (Treatise, I, iii, 14). Hence, all that we can discover of causation as it exists "in the objects themselves" is constant con? junction.9 Hume's successors in the empiricist tradition?however they may differ over points of detail?have generally accepted the basic tenets of Hume's regularity theory and have, following Hume, built it into their compatibilist position. What is the significance of Hume's regularity theory of causation for the compatibilist position? It would appear that Hume's successors have inter? preted the significance of the regularity argument for the compatibilist position largely in terms of Hume's suggestion that causation or necessity seems "to imply something of force, and violence, and constraint, of which we are not sensible" (Treatise, p. 407). In other words, traditional "metaphysical" theories of causation, it is suggested, have encouraged a fundamental confu? sion between the notion of an event being caused and that of an event being compelled. The source of this confusion lies with the misleading assump? tion, implicit in traditional metaphysical theories</page><page sequence="3">CAUSATION, COMPULSION, AND COMPATIBILISM 315 of causation, that a cause somehow compels or constrains its effect. On the basis of such an erroneous conception of causation many philoso? phers have arrived at the equally mistaken conclu? sion that there must be an incompatibility between determinism and freedom. The regularity theory of causation, it is argued, identifies and removes the source of this confusion in the free will dispute by way of challenging the deep-seated assumption that there is something more to causation than mere constant conjunction or regular succession. Clearly, as I have said, Hume's successors vary somewhat in the particular way in which they articulate the "regularity argument". They are, nevertheless, agreed on the fundamental strategy described above. We find, therefore, that Hume's effort to reconstruct the compatibilist strategy on the foundation of the regularity theory of causation has, over the past two centuries, become an integral part of the general compatibilist strategy.10 The sig? nificance of the regularity argument for the empiri? cist-compatibilist strategy may be interpreted in terms of the "positive" and "negative" requirements of the compulsion argument. Free, responsible action, it is suggested, must be both uncompelled and caused (by the agent's willings). Traditional theories of causation, however, confuse or conflate causation and compulsion and thus generate an ineradicable conflict between these positive and negative requirements. It is, therefore, the great merit of the regularity argument that it shows how the positive and negative requirements of freedom and responsibility can be reconciled, and how the ("pseudo")conflict generated by traditional theories of causation can be overcome. II In presenting the compatibilist strategy I have shown that the regularity argument is intended to strengthen the compulsion argument by exposing and eliminating a source of potential confusion. That is to say, once we recognize that causation involves nothing more than regular succession or constant conjunction then, it is argued, we will be less tempted to assume erroneously that what is caused is somehow compelled or forced to occur. Compatibilists have made this point in a variety of ways and we can trace the argument back through the centuries. Ayer, for example, notes that the word "determinism" tends to suggest that "one event is somehow in the power of another, whereas the truth is merely that they are factually corre? lated" ("Freedom and Necessity," p. 22; my emphasis). One source of this confusion, says Ayer, "is the survival of an animistic conception of causality, in which all causal relationships are modelled on the example of one person's exercising authority over another" (ibid). In a similar vein, Schlick suggests that because we confuse "de? scriptive" laws (of nature) with "prescriptive" laws (of society) we mistakenly confuse natural neces? sity with compulsion ("When is a Man Respon? sible?" sects. 2, 3, 4, and 7). It is this confusion which encourages us to identify freedom with ndeterminism and to regard it as being opposed to causality. Russell argues the same point as follows: The subjective sense of freedom, sometimes alleged against determinism, has no bearing on the question whatever. The view that it has a bearing rests upon the belief that causes compel their effects, or that nature enforces obedience to its laws as governments do. These are mere anthropomorphic superstitions, due to the assimilation of causes with volitions and of natural laws with human edicts ... it is one of the demerits of the traditional theory of causality that it has created an artificial opposition between determinism and the freedom of which we are introspectively conscious. ("On the Notion of Cause," p. 206.) According to Russell a volition "operates" when there is "some law in virtue of which a similar volition in rather similar circumstances will usually be followed by what it wills" (ibid., p. 192; my emphasis). The above remarks, it may be noted, leave us with the firm impression that were the causal re? lation to involve some stronger "bond" or "union" than that of mere "uniformity of sequence" then causes would indeed (somehow) compel or constrain their effects. This view of the matter is stated more explicitly by Mill. Mill suggests that people are re? luctant to accept that "there is nothing in causation but invariable, certain, and unconditional sequence." He continues:</page><page sequence="4">316 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY There are few to whom mere constancy of succession appears a sufficiently stringent bond of union for so peculiar a relation as that of cause and effect. Even if the reason repudiates, the imagination retains, the feeling of some more intimate connection, of some peculiar tie or mysterious constraint exercised by the antecedent over the consequent. Now this it is which, considered as applying to the human will, conflicts with our consciousness and revolts our feelings. We are certain that in the case of our volitions, there is not this mysterious constraint. We know that we are not compelled, as by a magical spell, to obey any particular motive. (A System of Logic, VI, ii, 2.) On the basis of these remarks Mill proceeds to argue that a stronger conception of causation than that of mere regularity may lead us into full-blown fatalism. That is to say, traditional theories of cau? sation seem to imply that a cause has some "irresist able" power over its effect. This leads to the fatalistic conclusion that there is "no use in struggling against it" (ibid., VI, ii, 3). The event in question "will happen however we may strive to prevent it." Mill, like others in the empiricist compatibilist tradition, maintains that an under? standing of causation in terms of regularity enables us to steer clear of these pitfalls. What are we to make of this aspect of the com? patibilist strategy? Considered as an attempt to strengthen the compulsion argument the regularity argument, I suggest, must be deemed a failure. It suffers from two closely related shortcomings. First, the regularity argument gives credence to the view that if there were some stronger "bond" or "tie" between cause and effect beyond that of mere regularity then causes would (somehow) compel or constrain their effects. A close examination of the compulsion argument, however, reveals that this assumption is itself confused. The distinction which is fundamental to the compatibilist position is that between those actions which have external causes (i.e. compelled or constrained actions) and those actions which have causes internal to the agent.11 This crucial distinction between actions that originate from the agent and those that do not is not compromised by "metaphysical" (i.e. non regularity) views of causation. (Hobbes and Locke, for example, consistently adhere to metaphysical accounts of causation without undermining their compatibilist positions.) What is relevant to whether an action was compelled or not is the nature of the cause, not the naure of the causal relation. Nothing about the metaphysical conception of cause when applied to human action need suggest that we do not act according to our will and could not act otherwise //we so willed. Clearly, therefore, proponents of the regularity argument are mistaken when they suggest that metaphysical theories of causation would pose a threat to the compulsion argument. To concede this point to the incom patibilist is to be confused about the very force or significance of the compulsion argument itself. This brings us to the second and closely related shortcoming of the regularity argument. The regu? larity argument suggests that our (supposed) ten? dency to confuse causation with compulsion has its source in mistaken views regarding the nature of the causal relation. This, quite simply, makes the wrong point against the incompatibilist. The point at issue, as I have noted, concerns the nature of the cause, not the nature of the causal relation. If incompatibilists are confused about this issue then so too are proponents of the regularity argu? ment. Confusion about the significance of the caused/compelled distinction cannot be eliminated by trying to describe "non-compelling" causal rela? tions in terms of regularity or constant conjunction. Causal relations, as such, are neither compelling or non-compelling. It is the nature of the cause (i.e. the object) which determines whether or not a given action was compelled. In this way, it seems clear that the strategy of the regularity argument is fundamentally misconceived. It involves, ironi? cally enough, a failure to grasp the significance of the compulsion argument. We must conclude, therefore, that it is not obvious that the regularity view of causation strengthens the compulsion argu? ment. On the contrary, as it stands it seems clear that traditional theories of causation pose no threat to the compulsion argument and the regularity theory, therefore, has no claim to be especially congenial to the compatibilist position. Ill In the foregoing section I have argued that the regularity argument does not strengthen the com</page><page sequence="5">CAUSATION, COMPULSION, AND COMPATIBILISM 317 patibilist position. In this section I will argue that the regularity argument in fact weakens the com? patibilist position by undermining the metaphysical foundation of the compulsion argument.12 Accord? ing to the compulsion argument it is a fundamental requirement of freedom and responsibility that the agent caused or determined his actions. Without this causal link or connection between agent and action, as has been noted, the action could not be attributed to the agent. In other words, the existence of a causal connection between the agent and his action is, for the orthodox compatibilist, essential to the "positive" requirement of freedom and responsibility. The regularity argument, I would suggest, deals a severe blow to this metaphysical requirement of the compatibilist position. The damage which the regularity argument inflicts upon the compulsion argument varies some? what depending upon how we interpret the regularity argument. On one interpretation it straightforwardly torpedoes the compulsion argument. On another interpretation it generates some rather awkward? though perhaps not fatal?difficulties for the com? pulsion argument. More specifically, we may inter? pret the regularity argument as being either "scepti? cal" or "revisionary" in nature. According to the sceptical interpretation the regularity argument should be understood as seeking to establish that there are no causal "connections," "ties," or "bonds" of any sort between cause and effect. It is, on this account, a mistake to conclude that there exists any power, agency or force in a cause where? by it "produces" its effects. All that we can discover is uniform sequence?-one event being followed by another event. This regularity enables us to infer one event from another but we must not allow our "anthropomorphic superstitions" to lead us into the erroneous conclusion that the cause possesses some kind of power or force whereby it somehow "brings about" its effect. The remarks which Hume and Russell make on this issue seem, quite clearly, to accord with this "sceptical" interpretation of the regularity argument.13 The regularity argument, understood in terms of the sceptical interpretation, cannot, I suggest, be rendered consistent with the metaphysical require? ments of the compulsion argument. That is to say, if it is true that all we discover when we look at the causal relation is "uniform sequence" or "regular succession," and that we discover no "bond" or "tie" between cause and effect, nor discover any "power" or "agency" in any cause, then it must follow that no cause can, strictly speaking, be said to "produce" or "bring about" its effect. Clearly, however, if we accept this (sceptical) account of the causal relation then it follows that no agent (i.e. person) "produces" or "brings about" his actions. Nor is any agent "connected" or "linked" to his actions through his willings. These metaphys? ical bonds have been dispensed with by the regu? larity theory. In these circumstances, therefore, given the stated requirements of the compulsion argument, there can be no free and responsible actions. The sceptical interpretation of the regu? larity argument suggests that the "positive" require? ment of the compulsion argument (i.e. that an agent must be "connected" with his actions through his willings) simply cannot be met. In response to this criticism defenders of the regularity argument may argue that this sceptical interpretation?however faithful it may be to Hume's and Russell's intentions?is too stringent and fails to make the most of this wider aspect of the compatibilist strategy. The re visionary account of the regularity argument maintains that regularity or constant conjunction is constitutive of the causal connection which holds between cause and effect. On this interpretation free agents do possess the power to produce or bring about their actions, but this relationship between an agent's willings and his actions must be understood in terms of regularity or a uniform sequence of events. There exists no further bond or union between agent and action. This revisionary account of the regularity argument succeeds in removing the immediate danger which the sceptical interpretation generates for the com? pulsion argument. There remain, however, at least two further dif? ficulties to be considered. First, while we grant that the revisionary version of the regularity argu? ment is not intended to generate sceptical doubts about the sufficiency of the causal connection between agent and action it may nevertheless lead us in precisely this direction. (This is a point which Mill, for example, as has been noted, frankly acknowledges.) More specifically, it may be argued</page><page sequence="6">318 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY that the relation of one event simply "being followed by" another event cannot possibly suffice as an ade? quate ground upon which to attribute an action to the agent. Surely, we may ask, the compulsion argument requires something stronger than this? A mere regularity between events, whereby one type of event is uniformly "followed by" another type of event seems to lack the metaphysical "cement" or force which is required by the compulsion argu? ment.14 The compatibilist position placed on the foundation of the regularity argument (so inter? preted), seems to drain away the force or power which connects an agent with his actions. Given this account of causation, it may be argued, we are left with an impoverished and somewhat flimsy account of human freedom and responsibility. It is in this way that sceptical doubts may start to creep back in and gradually undermine the foundations of the compulsion argument. Second, even if we accept the "revisionary" ac? count of the regularity argument?and refrain from indulging in sceptical anxieties ? it still seems clear that the regularity argument serves only to weaken the compulsion argument. That is to say, even if we grant that the regularity argument, so interpreted, does not entirely remove the metaphysical "cement" between agent and action it most certainly loosens it.15 The whole weight of the compulsion argument rests with the demand that an agent must be tied to or connected with his actions; that the agent must have brought about or produced his actions (if they were truly free and responsible actions). By watering-down the strength of the causal connection, and the causal power of agents, the regularity argu? ment appears to erode the very foundation of the compulsion argument. So interpreted the regularity argument may not collapse these foundations but it certainly suggests that they are less "solid" and se? cure than the early adherents of the compatibilist position had supposed. A world in which every event is entirely "loose and separate" from every other event, and in which events have no tighter bond or union than that of one following another, is a world in which the compulsion argument begins to lose its grip. By weakening the causal fabric in this way the regularity argument inevitably undermines the overall compatibilist position. In short, even on the most generous interpretation the regularity argument presents awkward difficulties for the compulsion argument and thus weakens rather than strengthens the compatibilist strategy.16 IV By way of conclusion let me, first, summarize the points which I have been especially concerned to establish in this paper and, second, make a few brief remarks about their wider significance. According to the regularity argument traditional theories of causation have given rise to a conflict between what I have described as the "positive" and "negative" requirements of freedom and responsi? bility. The regularity argument seeks to overcome this conflict by developing a conception of causation which involves no suggestion of compulsion or constraint. This entire strategy, I have argued, is misguided. In particular, I have argued that tradi? tional theories of causation generate no such conflict. The view that they do so involves a failure to ap? preciate a point which is crucial to the compulsion argument: namely, that the distinction between action which is free and action which is compelled must be understood in terms of the nature of the cause of the action (rather than in terms of the causal relation). In this way, the regularity argument fails to identify the real source of the incompatibilist's (supposed) "confusion" because the regularity argument is itself confused on this issue. By way of its misguided effort to articulate a "non-compelling" mode of causation the regularity argument, ironi? cally enough, produces its own difficulties for the compulsion argument. The regularity argument, by weakening?if not removing?the causal "cement" between agent and action, tends to undermine and erode the metaphysical foundation of the traditional compatibilist position. The final irony, therefore, is that the regularity argument not only fails to strengthen the compati? bilist position it actually generates some rather awk? ward and embarrassing difficulties for the compati? bilist and to this extent it brings the entire strategy into question. Accordingly, we may conclude that the regularity theory of causation, contrary to the opinion of several of the leading figures of the empiricist tradition, is not a particularly secure or congenial foundation upon which to rest the compulsion argument.</page><page sequence="7">CAUSATION, COMPULSION, AND COMPATIBILISM 319 By way of criticism, it may be suggested? contrary to Searle's remarks cited above?that the empiricist-compatibilist strategy is now rather "dated" and therefore the conclusions which we have reached in this essay are of limited contemporary philosophical interest. In answer to this criticism I would like to make three points: (1) As I indicated in my introductory remarks, even if the empiricist-compatibilist position is no longer the dominant position it once was it certainly continues to command some degree of support and influence among contemporary philosophers. Many "empirically-minded philosophers" continue to em? brace both the regularity theory of causation and some variant of the compatibilist strategy associated with Hobbes and Hume. Moreover, they regard these two positions as complementary or mutually supporting. Clearly the conclusions reached in this essay cannot be ignored by philosophers of this general persuasion. (2) The historical significance of the empiricist compatibilist strategy is, I take it, not in dispute. Moreover, it seems equally clear that this strategy continues to play an important role in initiating students to philosophy of the "free will problem." To this extent the empiricist-compatibilist strategy continues to play an important role in shaping the very way that we think about, or frame, the free will problem. Given this, it is incumbent on those philosophers who reject or dismiss this strategy to identify and articulate their reasons for doing so. Indeed, this is, obviously, a precondition for making progress on this subject. (3) The points which I have been concerned to establish in this essay are, I believe, of wider sig? nificance for the free will problem. It is a deep assumption of the empiricist-compatibilist strategy?as it has been developed since Hume? that the key to resolving this dispute lies with arriving at a more adequate account of the nature of the causal relation. The motivation behind this strategy can perhaps be best understood in terms of the framework of the dilemma of determinism. That is to say, the regularity argument purports to show that we may find a middle-way between, on the one hand, "metaphysical" necessity, understood in terms of compulsion, and, on the other hand, chance understood as the absence of causation and necessity. In other words, we may interpret the regularity argument as an attempt to show that the dilemma of determinism, as it is usually conceived, misconstrues our alternatives. This general approach to the free will problem is not unique to the empiricist-compatibilist strategy. In recent years several defenders of the incompati bilist position have suggested that an adequate solution to the free will problem requires that we develop an account of causation which involves no suggestion of necessitation.11 The motivation be? hind this strategy is, once again, to find a middle way between the horns of necessity and chance. In important respects, therefore, the general strategy remains the same: it is hoped that we may find an acceptable "solution" to the free will problem by way of developing a suitably amended account of the nature of the causal relation whereby we may slip through the horns of the dilemma. The repeated failure of this sort of project suggests that there is something fundamentally flawed about this general strategy. In light of these considerations it may be argued that no "solution" to these problems is likely to be discovered along these lines and that we should, therefore, look for an alternative approach to these problems. Granted that we should turn our attention away from concern with the nature of the causal relation and the general framework of the dilemma of deter? minism what, if any, alternative presents itself? It is beyond the scope of this essay to describe or map out any alternative approach. Suffice it to note, however, that at least one alternative approach to the problem of responsibility may be found in another, much neglected, aspect of Hume's "recon? ciling project": namely, in his discussion of the role that moral sentiment plays in human life. The significant features of this strategy have recently been restated and further articulated by P. F. Strawson in his well-known paper "Freedom and Resentment."18 According to this account, respon? sibility must be understood in terms of our natural, psychological reactions to the moral qualities and character traits of our fellow human beings. That is to say, we find that the attitudes and intentions of other people towards ourselves or others inevit? ably generate emotional responses or reactions in us (i.e. moral sentiments). On the basis of these</page><page sequence="8">320 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY observations it is argued that responsibility must be viewed as a "given" of our human nature. In order to understand the nature and circumstances of responsibility, therefore, it is essential that we develop a clearer understanding of the role that moral sentiment plays in human life. Whether or not an alternative approach to the problem of responsibility can be successfully con structed along these ("naturalistic") lines remains to be seen. My immediate concerns in this paper lie elsewhere. That is, throughout this paper it has been my particular objective to show that whatever merits are to be found in the traditional empiricist compatibilist strategy they do not rest with the ef? forts of its proponents to place that strategy on the foundation of the regularity theory of causation.19 The University of British Columbia Received January 15, 1988 NOTES 1. Searle, Minds, Brains and Science (Cambridge, Mass.; 1984), p. 86. Searle goes on to state that he does not believe that the free will problem has been solved by Hobbes, Hume and their empirically-minded followers. The more important works by the philoso? phers in this tradition include: Hobbes, The Questions Concerning Liberty, Necessity, and Chance [selections reprinted in S. Morgen? besser and J.

Watson, ed., Free Will (Oxford, 1982) pp. 15-23]. 2. See, e.g., Donald Davidson, "Freedom to Act," reprinted in Actions and Events (Oxford, 1980), p. 63: "Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Moore, Schlick, Ayer, Stevenson, and a host of others have done what can be done, or ought ever to have been needed, to remove the confusions that can make determinism seem to frustrate freedom" [my emphasis]. 3. Some standard accounts of this position can be found in Richard Taylor, "Determinism" an article in Paul Edwards, ed., The Encyclopedia of Philosophy (New York, 1970), Vol. 2, pp. 363-68; D.J. O'Connor, Free Will (Garden City, 1971), Ch. 9; and Barry Stroud, Hume (London, 1977), pp. 141-54. 4. Jonathan Glover, for example, states "that almost identical versions of this doctrine [sc. compatibilism] are to be discovered in Hobbes, Hume, Mill, Russell, Schlick, and Ayer". Responsibility (London: 1970), p. 50n. (For references to the works of these phil? osophers see note 1 above.) Note also that it is not unusual to find references to the "Hobbes-Hume-Schlick doctrine" (Isaiah Berlin) or to the "Hume-Mill-Schlick-Ayer theory" (Paul Edwards and John Hospers). 5. Thus Stroud reports Hume's position as follows: "We only praise or blame someone for something he does. The action must be his action, not somebody else's, and it must not be something that merely happens to him but otherwise has no connection with him at all . . . But if an 'action' does not proceed from a man's character, wants, desires, motives, etc., then there is no connection between the'action' and the man who is said to have done it" (Hume, p. 149; Stroud's emphasis). 6. "Freedom means the opposite of compulsion; a man is free if he does not act under compulsion, and he is compelled or unfree when he is hindered from without in the realization of his natural desires. Hence ... a man will be considered quite free and responsible if no such external compulsion is exerted upon him" (Schlick, "When is a Man Responsible?," sect. 4; Schlick's emphasis). 7. "It is not when my action has any cause at all, but only when it has a special sort of cause, that it is reckoned not to be free" (Ayer, "Freedom and Necessity", p. 21). Along these lines Paul Edwards explains the "Hume-Mill-Schlick theory" as follows: "In distin? guishing between free and unfree actions we do not try to mark the presence or absence of causes but attempt to indicate the kind of causes that are present" (Edwards, "Hard and Soft Determinism", in S. Hook, ed., Determinism and Freedom [New York, 1961], p. 118; Edwards' emphasis). Similarly, Jonathan Bennett notes that for "both Hume and Schlick, the question of whether there is accountability in a given case depends upon what natural cause the action had" {Kant's Dialectic [Cambridge, 1974], p. 195; Bennett's emphasis). 8. There are, of course, numerous well-known objections to this argument as it stands. Perhaps the most important of these objections is that the argument does not provide us with an adequate account of what constitutes an ("external") compelling or</page><page sequence="9">CAUSATION, COMPULSION, AND COMPATIBILISM 321 constraining cause. Lying behind this objection is the more fundamental concern that the compulsion argument presupposes a wholly inadequate understanding of the nature of excusing and mitigating considerations. This, however, is not an issue which is directly relevant to my present concerns and therefore I will not pursue it in this paper. (See note 11 below.) 9. For a detailed account of Hume's views on causation and necessity see my "Hume's 'Two Definitions' of Cause and the Ontology of 'Double Existence'," Hume Studies, vol. 10 (1984), 1-25. 10. See, for example, Ayer's remarks: "Freedom and Necessity", pp. 21-22. 11. Of course, notoriously, this sharp divide is difficult to maintain. Thus, for example, Ayer allows ("Freedom and Necessity", p. 20) for psychologically compelled behaviour (e.g. that of a kleptomaniac). This concession, however, generates serious difficulties for the orthodox compatibilist. It is no longer clear, for example, given this concession, just which "internal" causes should be regarded as "constraining" or "compelling" and which should not. A useful approach to this general issue, along somewhat different lines, may be found in Harry G. Frankfurt, "Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person", reprinted in Watson, ed., Free Will, pp. 81-95. 12. For a related discussion, which is concerned primarily with the interpretation of Hume's compatibilist position, see my "On the Naturalism of Hume's 'Reconciling Project'," Mind, vol. 92 (1983), pp. 593-600. 13. In a number of very important respects Russell's scepticism about causation is far more radical than that of Hume's. Indeed, in suggesting that we should abandon the "traditional theory of causality," Russell includes the regularity theory itself. In his view we should replace concern with regular sequences of events with a "theory of functional relations." It may be argued, however, that Russell's view of causation can be understood in terms of the regularity theory. On this issue see J. L. Mackie, The Cement of the Universe (Oxford, 1973), Ch. 6. 14. In other words, the relation of one event being regularly "followed by" another event may be called a 'connection' between two such events?but does such a relation constitute the sort of connection which we require? 15. "So that, upon the whole, there appears not, throughout all nature any one instance of connexion which is conceivable by us. All events seem entirely loose and separate. One event follows another; but we can never observe any tie between them" (Hume, An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Sect. VII, Pt. 2 [Selby-Bigge ed. p. 74]; my emphasis). 16. Arguably, some of these difficulties can be met if we are willing to adopt the sort of highly revisionary ("forward-looking") account of responsibility which Schlick describes ("When is a Man Responsible?" sect. 5). Schlick recommends that we interpret responsibility entirely in terms of the efficaciousness of punishment. Suffice it to note, however, that this entire approach to responsibility encounters a number of well-known difficulties. See, for example, C. A. Campbell's classic discussion of Schlick's views in "Is'Freewill' a Pseudo-Problem?", Mind, vol. 60 (1951), pp. 446-65 (esp. sect. Ill), and Bennett, Kant's Dialectic, sect. 63. 17. Arguments of this nature have been put forward by, for example, Peter Van Inwagen (An Essay on Free Will [Oxford, 1983], pp. 138-142), and, in considerably more detail, by Richard Sorabji (Necessity Cause and Blame [London, 1980], Parts I and V). I have expressed doubts about this alternative strategy in "Sorabji and the dilemma of determinism," Analysis, vol. 44 (1984), pp. 166-72. 18. Reprinted in Watson, ed., Free Will, pp. 59-80. See my "The Naturalism of Hume's'Reconciling Project'" for an interpretation of Hume's position which accords with Strawson's approach. 19.
