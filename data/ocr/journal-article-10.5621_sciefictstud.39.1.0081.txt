<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> A GERMAN HERO FOR THE COLD WAR 81 Steffen Hantke A German Hero for the Cold War: Wolfgang F. Henschel’s Alpha Alpha (1972) 1. “I am at your disposal”: Recruitment Fantasies. Out on a walk through his suburban Munich neighborhood one summer evening, high school science teacher Michael Dahlen (Karl-Michael Vogler) crosses paths with a motorcycle gang harassing an innocent victim. Compelled by civic duty and unconcerned for his own safety, he breaks up the uneven fight, dispatching some of the assailants in hand-to-hand combat and sending the rest of the gang off on a wild scramble. Though the incident remains without further consequences to anyone directly involved, Dahlen is being watched. More than his physical prowess, his fearlessness, or his skill in handling himself under pressure, it is his almost- instinctive ethical stand that has attracted the attention of a clandestine bureaucracy with branches in all continents of the world, a secret organization that hides behind the innocuous business front of “I.N.T.E.R.—Statistics and Foundational Research.” Following the incident, we see an efficient bureaucracy filing reports about Dahlen, gathering and processing information, setting in motion a computerized network of people and technology. In the days that follow, a field trip Dahlen takes with his students to observe the German space agency tracking a satellite provides another opportunity for his invisible observers to add to their target’s personality profile. When a computer processor fails during the critical minutes of the satellite’s passing, Dahlen assembles his students into an intricately stacked processing collective that manually provides the necessary calculations for preventing disaster. The newspaper headlines about the incident intensify his watchers’ interest in the man, his ingenuity and intelligence, and his potential: “Michael Dahlen recommended for test series alpha,” an internal memo reads. Over the next weeks, passive surveillance is replaced by intrusive testing: two field agents question Dahlen after injecting him with drugs. They also challenge him to a fight at gunpoint, and eventually manipulate him into an act of breaking and entering, a manipulation he ultimately rejects and undercuts by taking a stand against those manipulating him. This act of independently minded insubordination causes those observing Dahlen finally to reveal themselves to him. Active behind the scenes all along has been an organization staffed with the elites of science and the arts. The Organization, as it calls itself, is concerned about the rising potential for global human self-annihilation as a result of technological progress and social change. Headed by a committee of five men who hide their faces behind identical anthropomorphic masks, the Organization dispatches agents to investigate strange occurrences and, if necessary, to intervene for the greater good of humanity and to minimize the statistical probability of disaster. Its operatives, as one of them explains, must be “scientists, top agents, and moralists rolled into one, capable of making </page> <page sequence="2"> 82 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) decisions on behalf of humankind.” These heroes are recruited—like Michael Dahlen—from among ordinary citizens, and they operate undercover. Among these agents, whose ranks are distinguished by Greek letters, Dahlen has excelled; he is recruited as an Alpha, the top tier. The Organization proves right in its assessment of Dahlen as a man “alarmed by developments and unwilling to remain damned to passivity like most of his fellow humans”; he accepts the job they offer him. As one of the organization’s few Alpha agents, he will make his way, between May 10 and August 2 of 1972, through the following twelve episodes of the West German television series Alpha Alpha, going up against mad scientists, telepathic spies, and scientific conspiracies, getting abducted by aliens, breaking free of mind control, traveling back in time, and, all the while, keeping the world safe and at peace.1 Apart from bringing this little-known series to the attention of a larger audience by providing a description of its production background, its content and themes, and its hybridization of science fiction and the spy thriller, my goal in the following discussion is also to determine and assess the series’ political stance. First, I am interested in the question of how the series fits into the larger framework of the Cold War, which organized relations between the US and West Germany as one of its key European allies, as this framework is represented and critiqued within popular culture. How does the series, in other words, shape its origins and sources toward a coherent political position? Second, I would like to address the question of what role—in the political imagination of the series, its creator, and, presumably, its audience—West Germany was thought capable of playing in the early 1970s given the historical burden the nation carried since it had transformed itself from the Third Reich into the Federal Republic. In other words, what is the series’ political stance given the unique national space in which it unfolded? In order to provide answers to both of these larger questions, let me begin by introducing Alpha Alpha. 2. Michael Dahlen: Sci-Fi Spy on a Budget. Produced by the Elan Film Company in 1971 and 1972, and broadcast by the Zweite Deutsche Fernsehen (ZDF), Alpha Alpha was the brainchild of Wolfgang F. Henschel, who wrote and directed all thirteen episodes. In 1972, Henschel was only twenty-eight years old but had already carved out what was to become a long career as a director of television drama.2 In the course of this career, Henschel never became associated with any specific genre, least of all with either science fiction or the spy thriller, both of which found their way into Alpha Alpha. To the degree that a lasting career in West German television required a flexibility irreconcilable with functioning as a “genre auteur,” Henschel would work within genres that have consistently dominated the media landscape of the West German television series and the made-for-TV movie from the 1970s to the present day—i.e., family drama/comedy or versions of the detective genre and/or the police procedural.3 Even today, Henschel remains more closely associated with these genres, having worked most recently as a director on the Bavarian police procedural Der Bulle von Toelz (The Cop from Toelz, 2003- </page> <page sequence="3"> A GERMAN HERO FOR THE COLD WAR 83 2009) and Pfarrer Brown, a (very loose) German adaptation (2006-) of Chesterton’s Father Brown mysteries, both starring the same actor in the lead roles. Aside from illustrating a point about the indifference of West German television to science fiction in general that I will make in more detail later, Henschel’s singular excursion into unfamiliar genre territory with Alpha Alpha also suggests an openness to experiment and innovation on his part, as well as the easy transfer of the classical detective figure he and the broad television audience were already familiar with to a slightly less familiar genre and its milieu. More importantly, though, Henschel’s excursion into science fiction carries with it the realization that issues of industrial modernity, scientific progress, and its political instrumentalization could be efficiently addressed in such genres as science fiction and the spy thriller, both more readily attuned to science and politics than family drama/comedy or police procedurals. Since the series was to be broadcast in a late afternoon programming slot, preceding the more prestigious prime time with its claim on a large, varied adult audience, budgetary restraints on production were set according to this secondary status within the larger production hierarchy. According to common practice for the two state-sponsored television networks at the time, its half-hour time slot would not be interrupted by commercial breaks, allowing its writer a fairly flexible approach to the dramatic structuring of each episode’s narrative. Since West German television had also made the transition from black-and-white in the years before 1970, the fact that Alpha Alpha was shot and broadcast in color was no longer exceptional. Instead, as Henschel was conceptualizing Alpha Alpha, he saw himself confronted with the challenge to create an sf program of the type that “commonly requires substantial resources” while limiting himself to the “financial framework of one of the family dramas [popular on German television at the time]” (Henschel email, 2 Dec. 2009). Cleverly negotiating the pitfalls of these budgetary limitations, Henschel’s approach to the series demonstrates his skill with the medium. For one, the series makes do with a small cast of central characters. Aside from the protagonist, Alpha Alpha features Dahlen’s two fellow operatives, Beta (Lilith Ungerer), who provides a largely unrealized potential love interest for the hero, and Gamma (Arthur Brauss), who is used, more so than Alpha himself, for scenes requiring physical action.4 Added to this triad of central characters is the Organization’s executive committee, its five members played by masked, and thus interchangeable, extras. Henschel also kept production costs low by deciding to defy “typical SF expectations about the story’s expensive futuristic setting” with a “commitment to the present” (Henschel email, 12 Apr. 2011). Shooting was limited to Munich, home of Elan Film, and its surrounding area. Without tailoring the series specifically to its shooting location, Henschel used some recognizable urban features connoting industrial modernity; one crucial scene in the opening episode, for example, takes place on the roof of a high-rise building overlooking the Munich Olympic village.5 With these few notable exceptions, however, location shooting remained limited to generic office and factory spaces, </page> <page sequence="4"> 84 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) suburban houses, country roads, and downtown shopping districts. With its contemporary setting, the show did not feature environments that require mattes, green screens, or process shots. Even recurring sets were limited to Dahlen’s apartment, the board room of the organization’s executive committee, and the Organization’s computer centre. Overall production design was geared toward a sense of realism so inconspicuous as to border on blandness.  There is, however, one notable exception. Elan Film provided Henschel with a technical staff that would remain unchanged for the production of all thirteen episodes. Especially in his collaboration with cinematographer Helmut Meyer, Henschel aimed at creating a sustained visual style that tried to go beyond the conventional photography that was the standard for mainstream dramatic television during the 1970s.6 Using the fact that the show was shot on 35mm before being transferred to video for broadcasting by the ZDF, Henschel and Meyer worked with layered depth, shooting through or around objects or bodies conspicuously interposed between the camera and the shot’s central object. Though the results often remain hampered in their visual effectiveness by the size and aspect ratio of the television frame, what emerges is a sustained style of impressive visual complexity, given the limitations of the medium and the predominant aesthetics of the time.7 Similar to this unique visual style, which was, by and large, achieved through blocking and camera placement, Henschel’s editing also served the purpose of limiting costs. More than Meyer’s idiosyncratic camera work, hard edits and jump cuts tended to remain functional and restricted to specific diegetic demand. While they helped to accelerate the pace of action, they also made expensive special effects unnecessary. Aside from minimal pyrotechnics, explosion sequences and their effects on surrounding spaces and observers were assembled in the editing room. The Organization’s teleportation technology, by which Dahlen is instantaneously transported into the central committee’s boardroom—a signature sequence repeated in virtually every episode with only minor variations—was suggested simply by a cut inserted between a close-up of the actor’s face between the moments, respectively, before and after teleportation. Most importantly, however, Henschel’s concept of Dahlen as the central hero allowed for storytelling on a limited budget. As in the opening episode, Dahlen’s challenges throughout all thirteen episodes of Alpha Alpha were largely intellectual in nature. Though Henschel threw in the occasional fist fight, the show focused on problems for its protagonist that required ingenuity, creativity, and the kind of moral intelligence that in the opening episode leads to Dahlen’s recruitment. In the second episode, for example, Dahlen’s task is to manipulate a telepath guilty of industrial espionage into revealing his abilities to the Organization’s central committee. In episode three, Dahlen is part of a small group of people abducted by aliens as part of a behavioral experiment; in order to effect his and his fellow humans’ release, Dahlen must find a way to demonstrate to their captors that their test subjects are, in fact, more than animals. In the final episode, Dahlen’s task evolves from finding the murderer </page> <page sequence="5"> A GERMAN HERO FOR THE COLD WAR 85 of a scientist who has developed an immortality drug to deciding whether the drug itself is safe to be released to his own employers, the members of the Organization who are, after all, claiming to act in the best interests of humanity. While there is an element of violent conflict in all of these plot premises, Dahlen’s sense of agency emerges not through triumphing in physical conflict but through analyzing the situation and devising strategies that are both materially effective and ethically sound. Audiences, in short, were watching Dahlen think—a conceptual emphasis nicely expressed in Henschel’s original working title for the series, Braintrust (Henschel email, 27 Mar. 2011). Solving intellectual puzzles is an activity that does not require futuristic sets, special effects, stunt work, or crowd scenes. All things considered, the budgetary limitations of Alpha Alpha, together with what contemporary viewers are likely to perceive as a campy quality in the show’s 1970s production design—from period apartment furnishing and clothing to low-budget gadgetry and computer technology—might, at first glance, relegate the show to the back catalogue of the German nostalgia market. There is no entry for the show in the index of Knut Hickethier’s magisterial 591-page Geschichte des Deutschen Fernsehens (History of German Television, 1998), a fact that Hickethier himself accounts for by pointing out that among the genres that flourished on German television during the late 1960s and early 1970s, science fiction remained a “rarity” (236). “Interest in this genre,” he states, “was never very strong because genre entertainment, in accord with the general expectation of realism during the 1970s, tended to gravitate more toward thematic areas geared toward the quotidian and the contemporary” (360).8 Even now, over a decade later, IMDB lists the show with only minimal details and entirely without user or external reviews. Even fan pages, uneven and subjective in their assessments, are few and far between.9 There has been no DVD release; at the moment of writing, none has been announced. This public and critical neglect is, I believe, undeserved. It is exactly as a “rarity,” as Hickethier calls it, in the context of its medium at the time of its release, that Alpha Alpha deserves attention. The show’s relatively short run under the control of a single author, Wolfgang F. Henschel, working with the same cast and crew, has produced a text with a clear stylistic profile and, more importantly, with a sustained thematic focus. It is true that the show’s overarching thematic conceit—i.e., the global shadow government operating behind the scenes to safeguard humanity—is not entirely original. Neither are the sources from which it assembles this ideological fantasy—i.e., the paranoid Cold War culture of adventure, espionage, and science fiction. The niche it carves out for itself, however, by modifying this familiar generic conceit in ways counter to the ideological uses and applications of its time strikes me as unique—a claim best substantiated by considering it in the context of West German television programming at the time of its original broadcast. 3. Spy Thriller/Science Fiction: A Double Genealogy. At the time Alpha Alpha made its appearance on German television, the audience was well prepared for some of its generic ingredients. Viewers were already familiar with </page> <page sequence="6"> 86 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) Cold War fare on the large screen, dominated by the JAMES BOND franchise launched in 1962. Nowhere, Leslie Britton writes, “was the success of the Bond bonanza more evident than on network television. Espionage capers exploded” (Spy Television 2). West German television had been no exception when it came to adventure in the world of Cold War espionage. Danger Man (1964-1966) began its run on the ARD from 1962, along with Mission Impossible (1966- 1973); and The Man from U.N.C.L.E.(1964-1968) started on ZDF in 1967, followed by I Spy (1965-1968) and, on ARD, Man in a Suitcase (1967-1968) in 1968. In 1966, the ZDF had also started to broadcast The Avengers (1961- 1969), a series that, though clearly in the same tradition, “already approached the genre ironically” (Hickethier 237), which was also true for Department S (1969-1970, on ZDF, from 1970) and, far more self-consciously, its spin-off Jason King (1971-1972, on ZDF from 1973).10 Outright parodies of the spy genres also played on German TV: Get Smart (1965-1970, starting in 1967 on ZDF, and Mr. Terrific (1967) in 1970 (ZDF).11 These shows marked not only the audience’s increasing familiarity with genre conventions but also the beginning of the genre’s extension into self-consciousness and irony.12  Just as American and British spy thrillers had a strong presence on German television, science fiction was, by and large, a genre that existed only in the form of imports. During the 1950s and most of the 1960s, programmers paid little attention to science fiction, but interest picked up around 1970. Imports broadcast on German television included The Prisoner (1967-1968, on ZDF from 1969), The Invaders (1967-1968, on ZDF from 1970), The Time Tunnel (1966-1967, on ARD from 1971), U.F.O. (1970-1971, on ZDF from 1971), Star Trek (1966-1969, on ZDF from 1972), and Space 1999 (1975-1977, on ZDF from 1977). What is striking about the media landscape is the fact that the two networks’ purchasing and broadcasting practices tended not only to place British and American shows side by side, but also to ignore and rearrange the chronology of these imports’ original release and running dates. Regardless of aesthetics, politics, and origin, an American series such as The Time Tunnel, would be available to the German audience simultaneously with a British one such as U.F.O. Obviously, for a writer and director such as Henschel, working on a German adaptation of these imported models, this diachronic, dehistoricized media landscape provided fertile ground. Despite the general familiarity of sf themes and motifs, however, the only German attempt at matching imported science fiction that provided Henschel with a workable precedent was Raumpatrouille (ARD, 1966).13 Nonetheless, there were two notable exceptions to the domination of the German television landscape by foreign imports. For one, science fiction “made in Germany” did find a niche in the program schedule—not in the format of the series but in that of the made-for-TV movie, the so-called Fernsehspiel. The two writers working contemporaneously with Henschel who excelled at infusing science fiction into this format were Wolfgang Menge and Rainer Erler. Skillful at adapting foreign material to the German market, Menge was the driving force, as producer and writer, behind Das Millionenspiel (The Millions Game, </page> <page sequence="7"> A GERMAN HERO FOR THE COLD WAR 87 dir. Tom Toelle, 1970), a made-for-TV adaptation of Robert Sheckley’s story “The Prize of Peril” (1958).14 Satirically imitating the very form of television, Das Millionenspiel masquerades as a reality-TV show in which a candidate is pursued by assassins with the license to kill. With its embedded commercials, featuring products by the same corporation sponsoring the fictional game show, the film was so convincing that viewers called the network, inquiring about future possibilities for signing up as candidates. Three years later, Menge went on to write and produce Smog (dir. Wolfgang Petersen, 1973), a film documenting a three-day period during which rising air pollution levels in the industrial Ruhr area trigger a national emergency. Replacing the satirical thrust of Das Millionenspiel with a more sobering mockumentary aesthetic, Smog lays out scenarios of governmental failure in crisis management, corporate greed, and quietly inconspicuous individual suffering, sickness, and death—a bureaucratic, industrial dystopia of the highest caliber. Similar to Menge’s carefully modulated extrapolations of contemporary trends into a critique of the medium of television itself, Rainer Erler’s work as a writer and director mapped out the Fernsehspiel as a programming niche for German science fiction that took its cues straight from the headlines. Operation Ganymed (1977) tracks the march across what appears to be a post-nuclear wasteland of the crew of a crash-landed space shuttle; Fleisch (Meat, 1979) dramatizes the illegal international trade in transplant organs; his miniseries Das blaue Palais (The Blue Palais, five episodes, 1974-1976) imagines an international group of scientists investigating mysterious occurrences. While Erler’s work in the latter part of the 1970s gravitated toward other genres (Fleisch borrows heavily from the road movie, as does Das Schöne Ende dieser Welt (The Beautiful End of the World), a film about German corporate greed in Australia), his first experiment with science fiction—Die Delegation (The Delegation, 1970)—is clearly indebted to Menge’s mockumentary approach around the same time. Packaged as a news program, The Delegation assembles a jumble of audio- and videotapes left behind by a journalist who has mysteriously vanished during the investigation of alien landings, suggesting the possibility that he himself has become an abductee. While Menge and Erler were successful in establishing German science fiction as a viable genre for the made-for-TV movie, they never ventured into the territory of the series. A wide variety of forces may have been at work behind this conspicuous timidity: perhaps the format of the series itself “was seen as vulgar and trivial and was therefore only gradually adopted by German production houses” (Vieth 224). Neither Menge nor Erler was interested in the genre of science fiction per se; the market for series was already well saturated by imports and gave few incentives for German producers to compete, and genres like science fiction required financing that exceeded production budgets calibrated traditionally to family dramas and crime shows. Still, their work had obliquely prepared the ground for Henschel. Capitalizing instead on the incipient trend of “establishing new [genre] variants and thus attracting audience attention ... beyond the serial genres already anchored in the minds of viewers” </page> <page sequence="8"> 88 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) (Hickethier 357), Henschel’s attempt to transpose the qualities that made Menge’s and Erler’s work successful—topicality, realism, and the use of science fiction as a vehicle for the examination of social issues—into the realm of the series makes him, in a manner of speaking, the missing link between both programming formats. While the range of material imported to German television, both spy thrillers and science fiction, was considerable, Henschel managed to combine elements from both genres in a manner that referenced precursors in the literary as well as the cinematic tradition. Against the background of Cold War espionage, the protagonist of Alpha Alpha acts primarily as a detective, an investigator of events that appear threatening, baffling, mysterious, and inexplicable. On German television, the only precursor of this model was the Japanese series Kaiki daisakusen (1968), of which the ZDF broadcast thirteen episodes in the fall of 1971 under the title S.R.I. und die unheimlichen Faelle (S.R.I. and the Uncanny Cases). Like Alpha Alpha, the show deals with an organization dedicated to the investigation of mysterious events seemingly outside the purview of science. Unlike Kaiki daisakusen’s reliance upon the supernatural, however, which also links it to the American series The Night Stalker (1972), Alpha Alpha turns on the disambiguation of the seemingly supernatural—what, in the tradition of the gothic, might be called “Gothic expliqué,” best represented in the literary tradition by the writing of Ann Radcliffe—and its transposition into the vernacular of science and technology. The categorical exclusion of the supernatural distinguishes Alpha Alpha’s Michael Dahlen from literary antecedents of the “supernatural detective”—from Algernon Blackwood’s John Silence and William Hope Hodgson’s Carnacki the Ghost Finder to, more recently, the protagonists of Tim Power’s Declare (2001) and Charles Stross’s The Atrocity Archives (2004). Instead, Michael Dahlen appears as an early precursor of FBI agents Mulder and Scully in Chris Carter’s The X Files (1993-2002) and agent Olivia Dunham in J.J. Abrams’ Fringe (2008- ). Like them, Henschel’s hero is a criminal investigator operating in the realm of science so advanced that its manifestations might—spontaneously, prematurely, and thus erroneously—be attributed to the supernatural (to paraphrase Arthur C. Clarke’s famous dictum on science versus magic). 4. Resisting Bond: A Homegrown Hero for the Cold War. Instead of delving more deeply into the complicated genealogy of Alpha Alpha’s precursors, I want to return to the fact that Henschel managed to place a German sf series on German television at a time when the medium was generally uninterested in the genre and the programming format was dominated by imports. To a large degree, the stakes in Henschel’s experiment were economic (unfortunately, given the series’ running time of only thirteen episodes, the experiment can hardly be called a resounding success). More importantly, however, the stakes were ideological. Audiences might have been fully acclimatized to foreign shows; the practice of dubbing, which frequently played fast and loose with the original dialogue and voices, certainly helped to take the alien edge off American or British programs. Whatever foreignness survived might have even </page> <page sequence="9"> A GERMAN HERO FOR THE COLD WAR 89 held an exotic appeal to German audiences. Given the assumption that the nations of the so-called Free World shared political beliefs and goals within the framework of the Cold War, even the underlying ideological tenets of one culture might have come across as deeply familiar to another, especially if the originating culture was that of the United States. And yet, it was the context—the very practice of importing mass entertainment into a medium closely linked to the confirmation of national identity—that circumscribed how imported series functioned ideologically. Increasingly conscious of its economic and cultural reach beyond national boundaries, American television had an arsenal of devices at its disposal that “customized US genres for Britain [and] then used modal shifters to internationalize them again for US consumption” (94). Inversely, German audiences understood that American series were a vehicle for “Americanness,” or habitually projected this elusive quality into texts, regardless of their creators’ intent. This was particularly true for science fiction, where not only distinctions between British and American origins tended to collapse (“symptomatically, German culture has read the genre’s [science fiction] Anglophone quality always as an American rather than a British one” (Kanzler, 111), but which also served as “an index of the American-ness of the coming world” (Harrison). The future, for German audiences of science fiction, was American by default. This association was so strong that it was not in science fiction but in crime fiction that German television began, during the 1960s, to emancipate itself from the foreign imports that dominated the medium. “After numerous German authors had been adopting British and, to a lesser degree, American settings, crime stories were produced [starting during the 1960s] that featured German settings and thus produced a certain recognition effect” (Hickethier 237). This “desire to see crime stories take place within a German setting” was driven by the recognition that foreign imports were introducing stereotypes “into German programming—values embodied by patterns of action and behavior in the characters” (236)—that were alien or even antithetical to German traditional values and narrative and generic conventions. Unlike the elderly, gently paternalistic, sedate bureaucrats who had populated German crime shows, foreign imports endorsed protagonists with a penchant for “aggression, as well as the willingness to act and to accept personal responsibility” (360). Though the American settings in the imported series might have been “more attractive and challenging” than those of the German series, “because they offered—to the German viewer—exoticism, tourist incentives, and cosmopolitanism” (360), the actions of their protagonists were more likely to remain alien, impractical, or altogether implausible for the larger part of the German audience. At worst, this made the foreign imports pure escapism. At best, they provided a surface for the projection and exploration of desires that cut across the full political spectrum—progressive or utopian (on the left), practically irrelevant (in the center), or socially unacceptable (on the right). What they did not provide was a sense of realism, a reflection of the social and political reality of 1970s West Germany. To the extent that homegrown heroes </page> <page sequence="10"> 90 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) emancipated science fiction from its imported model, they allowed for a departure from ideas and attitudes, politics and ideologies marked as foreign.15 While the late-1960s series Raumpatrouille had remained largely within the postulate that the future must be American, Alpha Alpha was more daring in its attempts at domesticating the imported genres of adventure science fiction/espionage thriller.16 Not surprisingly, Henschel’s fictional universe still retains some of those markers of “exoticism, tourist incentives, and cosmopolitanism” (360) that Hickethier sees as one attraction of foreign imports. Though an inconspicuous member of the German Bildungsbürgertum, Michael Dahlen does drive a green Ford Mustang—a car conspicuously American. Members of the biker gang in the opening episode are named Bill and Jim; and when Dahlen must fake his own death (episode 10), his fellow operative Beta comments on the fake funeral by quoting the German title of Alistair MacLean’s Where Eagles Dare (1967): “Agenten sterben einsam” (spies die lonely). While these residual markers of Americanness might very well illustrate the fact that Henschel did not fully succeed in his domestication of the imported model, there is evidence, in the form of scattered inter- and meta-textual clues, that he wanted his audience to confront Americanness more consciously. These clues, interestingly enough, originate with science fiction and not with the spy thriller. The eponymous astronaut who manages to teleport himself to safety from his burning space capsule in episode 4, for example, is named Poul Anderson.17 Similarly, in the show’s final episode (13), which deals with an immortality drug and the potentially catastrophic effects it will have on global population growth, one central character is named Brunner.18 Aside from these knowing winks to readers of science fiction, virtually all of the episodes feature basic genre conceits that can easily be traced to their literary origins, harking back to a variety of sources ranging from A.E. van Vogt to John Wyndham: telepathic children make an appearance in episode 10; involuntary self- teleportation at a moment of imminent death (episode 4) is taken straight from Alfred Bester’s The Stars My Destination (1956), just as Bester, with The Demolished Man (1953), provides the source for the problematic coexistence of telepathy and crime in episode 2. In each case, the literary model is so clear as to be virtually explicit, providing evidence not of Henschel’s lack of originality as a writer but of his consciously working through a body of canonical tropes. The metatextual nature of these references does not suggest that Alpha Alpha is pilfering imported science fiction—imitating it, at worst, and adapting it to its German audience, at best—but that it is citing instances from the Anglo- American tradition as a way of examining and even interrogating them. Having embraced science fiction in this manner—regardless, apparently, of its inherent Americanness—Henschel turns toward the spy thriller in order to differentiate Alpha Alpha from its American sources. Michael Dahlen’s Alpha status, for example, may make him, like James Bond, a member of an elite. But unlike Bond, whose “double 0 numerals signify an agent who has killed and who is privileged to kill on active service” (Fleming 44), Dahlen’s status </page> <page sequence="11"> A GERMAN HERO FOR THE COLD WAR 91 signifies primarily ethical acuteness, not his position outside all social and ethical norms. Even during his recruitment, Dahlen commits two significant acts of insubordination, and in subsequent episodes he repeatedly indulges in doubts about his employers and their ability to resist the temptations of power. Acts of defiance against these employers, however, fail to show the negative consequences that render the more conventional hero of the genre a romantic outsider, a “rogue” agent who asserts his individuality against a stifling bureaucracy. Dahlen is not punished for his insubordination, and his preemptive maneuvering that keeps dangerous technology out of the hands of his benign employers is never detected. Dahlen’s insubordination, his doubts about his employers, and his integrity render him an exemplary and not an exceptional member of society (e.g., in episode 13, he preempts the Organization’s vote about the uses of the immortality drug, rendering its last traces undetectable even to himself). Dahlen’s sigh of relief at the end of episode 7, ackowledging his true identity as a high school teacher—“And I’m back to being a civil servant!”—illustrates how wide is the gap between Dahlen and Bond. Just as Dahlen’s departure from more traditional Cold War spies undercuts the strict Cold War binary entrenched in the imported series, the outcome of his missions does not serve to illustrate the efficiency, integrity, or even primacy of state power. Not only does Henschel explicitly differentiate Dahlen’s employers from governmental authority, the show repeatedly criticizes state power. The Organization, for example, insists that it provides the direly needed “international oversight” of dangerous technologies that state power fails to marshal (episode 8). As individual states fail when faced with the challenges of technological progress, their inability to cooperate with each other exacerbates this failure. Henschel examines this theme first in episode 6, in which a group of scientists collaborates in the fiction of an imminent alien invasion in order to coerce nation states into cooperation with each other. “Starting from the insight,” one of these scientists justifies the ruse by arguing “that human beings have the desire for unity but lack the strength to achieve it; we have created an enemy from outside.” While the outcome of this particular episode remains ambiguous, Henschel returns to the theme in episode 12 where he resolves it more clearly. Here an alien intelligence gets to speak as a fully developed character in its own right: “Fifty percent of all planetary cultures extinguish themselves after the discovery of atomic energy: Earth is undergoing this process right now. Unstable cultures of this type constitute a threat [to themselves and to others].” Leaving Earth to return to their home planet, the aliens, therefore, have embedded a posthypnotic command that rekindles, “as soon as this danger has been surpassed,” the memory of the aliens’ existence and the means to contact them. This vision of a benign superior agency observing or averting humanity from the brink of self-destruction may superficially sound like an endorsement of regulatory bodies such as the United Nations or its specialized branches, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency. Henschel, however, registers doubt about the efficiency of these bodies as well. To the extent that the show’s </page> <page sequence="12"> 92 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) fictional Organization is emblematic of such regulatory bodies, Dahlen’s acts of insubordination against his own employers—however pure their motives might be—call into question the integrity of trans- or post-national authority, positing it yet again against the individual’s responsibility for ethical action. In several instances, Henschel introduces details that relativize the integrity of the Organization: for example, the telepathically-aided crimes in episode 10 trigger a statement from the executive committee: “We cannot allow that a private organization [competing with ourselves] has these kinds of means for neutralizing its opponents.” There is an unpleasantly competitive ring to these words, a touch of institutional paranoia. For a moment, Henschel seems to portray “the organization behind the scenes [as] mysterious and apparently part of a shadow government” such as those in I Spy or Mission: Impossible (Britton, Spy Television 12), extending the scope of paranoia. Instead of pursuing the possibilities of this extension further, however, Henschel settles upon the recognition that private organizations are just as woefully imperfect and prone to internal destabilization and paranoid delusion as their govermental equivalent.19 Alpha Alpha attempts to break free of the binary that generates and organizes this paranoia. In several episodes conflicts are resolved by revealing that their underlying antagonistic relationships are based on misunderstandings or exaggerated anxieties. The mysterious radio silence of a military installation in episode 5, for example, is revealed as the product of a misguided, though certainly not ill-intentioned, experiment by a scientist among its staff. The same theme recurs in episode 9, when a scientist unwittingly projects the emotions of his lab animal onto an unsuspecting population, causing mass outbreaks of panic and violence. Both episodes rely superficially upon the motif of the mad scientist and thus evoke, to one degree or another, right-wing anxieties about Cold War technologies in the hands of technocratic elites intent on an agenda beyond national security. The absence of both scientists’ ill intent undercuts this motif, however, as does the conspicuous absence of tragic endings to each technological derailment. Also, punishment of the guilty party at the end of each episode is less of a concern to Dahlen than the satisfaction of having solved the puzzle and contained the threat. If these episodes address any Cold War fears at all, they are connected to the concern that technology itself comes with the power to destabilize global relationships, unless wielded cautiously.20 Judging by these examples, Henschel’s handling of the two genres he deploys in Alpha Alpha is politically driven. To the extent that the series operates as a spy thriller, he is undercutting its alignment with the genre’s dominant ideological positions by imagining an atypical protagonist within a framework of destabilized binary oppositions. If this ideological maneuver takes place more visibly within the genre of the spy thriller than that of science fiction, it is because, as Toby Miller observes in reference to the lasting influence of the Bond franchise, “both the processes and the contents of espionage cinema and TV appear intensely problematic, caught in a cage of capitalist normalcy” (93). The shadow of Bond—James Bond—looms large. </page> <page sequence="13"> A GERMAN HERO FOR THE COLD WAR 93 Turning critically against spy fiction’s “pro-state and pro-capital” slant (Miller 93), Henschel’s agenda prefigures critiques of the Bond franchise that trace its legacy into the post-Cold War world. “So many of the signs and symbols in the Bond films which we find reinforcing and rather lovely,” Simon Winder argues, the effortless ability to master languages, cultures and womenfolk—must in other contexts act as a virtual Radical Islam recruiting poster. Indeed, this, in conjunction with the gross materialism, the palpable sense of spiritual failure, the workaday profanity and contempt for human life—particularly differently coloured human life—may ultimately prove to be the Bond films’ most lasting legacy. (278).21 To the extent that this legacy is already palpable in the early 1970s, Henschel’s motives for trying to extricate himself from its politics are aligned with the stance that a national rewriting of an imported genre can generate positions more revelant to its domestic audience. Within the dynamic of hybrid genres, science fiction plays a different role—a role determined by the range of available visions regarding technology and its effects. While the spy thriller seems capable of envisioning technologies primarily through the lens of competitive national interests, science fiction—represented, for example, by the work of Alfred Bester, John Brunner, and Poul Anderson—has a wider variety of political positions available. Though there is, of course, no shortage of science fiction that embraces Cold War paranoia or indulges in phallocentric, fetishistic celebrations of technology, science fiction also has a strong tradition of political liberalism and technological utopianism. Within this tradition, it is easier to imagine that the other may not always have sinister intentions. “How typically human,” Dahlen muses in episode 8, “to assume right away that alien creatures must have war on their minds”; in episode 3, he expresses the “hope that one law also applies beyond Earth—that intelligent beings don’t kill each other.” Caught up in its hermetic vision, the spy thriller has no transcendence to offer; science fiction—potentially—does.22 5. Conclusion: Generational Politics post-1960s. Beyond the boundaries that define Henschel’s confrontation with imported genre models—his critical interrogation of science fiction and his rejection of right-wing spy thrillers— Alpha Alpha continues its attempt at mapping out a position within the framework of the Cold War more suitable to its German audience by encoding national preoccupations into some of its episodes. In the broadest possible sense, there is the fact that Henschel’s protagonist Michael Dahlen, by way of his actions, constantly draws attention to the question of whether obedience to his employers, however well-intentioned they might be, is always the ethically safe route of conduct. As I mentioned before, he is recruited because of his penchant for questioning authority, with a significant act of insubordination providing the ultimate turning point in his favor during the recruitment. While the imported American heroes on West German television, especially in the police procedural, were prone to insubordination, insisting on individual agency and </page> <page sequence="14"> 94 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) autonomy against the stifling conformity (and idiocy) of the hierarchical bureaucracies that employed them, German heroes tended to act more sedately in accord with their institutions. Dahlen’s frequent acts of insubordination fall into an emergent counter-tradition, influenced, no doubt, by Henschel’s exposure to American culture. No matter if insubordination is an imported theme or one with culturally indigenous origins, the theme itself hit a nerve with German audiences. Michael Dahlen’s refusal to obey testifies to a uniquely German concern with the problematic legacy of Prussian discipline, absolute obedience, and bureaucratic conformity from the historical experience of the Third Reich and the question of what role these dubious qualities play for the citizen within a newly democratic state, an industrial superpower in the process of reconstituting itself after wartime devastation.23 The issue would periodically resurface with renewed topical urgency—as, for example, during the remilitarization of West Germany in 1955—so that Henschel’s rewriting of the imported hero figure in the spy thriller takes on a more specific cultural significance for the German audience.24 While the theme of insubordination in itself may be universal enough to apply across cultural boundaries, individual episodes of Alpha Alpha address more readily recognizable issues within postwar (West) German culture. Episode 3, entitled “Like Rats,” is of particular interest in this regard. In this episode, Michael Dahlen joins a group of people—a young woman, a middle- aged married couple, a young boy—abducted by aliens, placed into a controlled environment (vaguely reminscient of that in Vincenzo Natali’s film Cube [1997), and observed as to their behavior. Dahlen quickly ascertains that their captors are “curious and want to explore” and thus “don’t want to harm or hurt” those they abduct. Reversing the subject/object relations of their captors’ experiment, the human test subjects, under Dahlen’s leadership, formulate and return their own questions about their captors, proving in the process that they are sentient and moral creatures. Eventually, the abductees find themselves returned, unharmed, to the site of their abduction, though their memories of the test they just passed have been erased. For Henschel, this scenario might carry overtones of his own “early development as a director and writer [that] was shaped by a youth spent in occupied post-war Germany, ... by a committed anti-fascism, [and by] critical distance toward the new German state authority” (Henschel email, 12 Apr. 2011). These are the years of West German consolidation and integration into the so-called “Staatengemeinschaft,” the community of nations, under US leadership and within the military framework of NATO (founded, incidentally, the same year that West Germany consolidated itself as a sovereign state, 1949). For someone of this generation, the broad allegory of humanity’s readiness to be seen as equal to a highly technologically advanced culture, with which it shares broad humanitarian values, might easily be read as a narrative about West Germany’s shedding the stigma of its recent historical past and proving itself worthy of the position that, by way of the Marshall Plan and the “miracle” of rapid economic recovery, has come into reach. For better or worse, this </page> <page sequence="15"> A GERMAN HERO FOR THE COLD WAR 95 specifically national allegory incorporates some of the more problematic or even contentious aspects of this process and its accompanying public debate. For example, Henschel’s script is conspicuously silent on possible arguments running counter to the assertion that humans are intelligent and moral creatures; as the captives debate their strategies to prove just that to their captors, nobody mentions a human history of warfare, genocide, superstition, egotism, and brutality that might, if cited, contradict what the group is trying to prove about itself. The analogy proposed by the episode’s title—that, to the aliens, the humans might be merely “like rats”—signals human inferiority, the analogy itself suppressing the possibility of collective and individual responsibility for such inferiority in favor simply of natural difference; they are, in other words, entitled to full equality. Similarly, the fact that the abductees at the end of their adventure have no memories of having passed this crucial test is indicative of German ambivalence surrounding the idea of having to prove one’s equality to one’s superiors; notoriously, German attitudes toward the Third Reich in the immediate postwar years fluctuated wildly between the display and the lack of contrition expected, or mandated, by Allied occupation. Amnesia, willful or inadvertent, strikes me as a sufficiently complex response to this ambivalence. Though the outlines of a broad national allegory are striking, reading episodes of Alpha Alpha in this manner may produce slightly skewed results given the fact that the show aired in 1972, long after the postwar debate about West Germany’s integration into global politics had been resolved, most notably with the country’s joining NATO in 1955 and its central role in the emergence of the European Union. More important than this broader potential ahistoricity, this consideration of the series’ author and his historical experience raises questions about the generational validity of such interpretations. In other words, though allegorical features of the series do fit with a retrospective assessment of postwar (West) German history, the question is whether the author of the series, as well as its audience, is, in fact, looking backward at all. This question comes into focus if one considers Henschel’s remark that Alpha Alpha was not continued into a second season, “despite its strong resonance,” because “it was watched predominantly by younger viewer[s] ... which, today, would be seen as a sign of its being a smashing success” (Henschel email, 2 Dec. 2009). Though Henschel, as the series’ creator, was relatively young in 1972, its viewers tended to be even younger. Born in the late 1950s and early 1960s, they would bring an altogether different generational experience to the series, especially when it came to West Germany’s relationship with the United States. By the early 1970s, it would have been primarily younger viewers in their teens and early 20s who challenged the assumptions upon which this relationship within the larger framework of the Cold War was based. Unlike their parents and, to some extent, Henschel’s own immediate post-war cohort, this generation did not view the US through direct personal memories of the Marshall Plan, the Berlin Airlift, or Kennedy’s inspirational visit to Berlin in 1963.25 This is not to say that West German attitudes toward the US were unanimously positive until the late 1960s, or, conversely, unanimously negative thereafter; the already- </page> <page sequence="16"> 96 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) cited debate about West German remilitarization during the 1950s, for example, raised questions about the price the nation would have to pay for finding shelter under the umbrella of US-led Western democracy (i.e., membership in NATO). Nonetheless, West German attitudes tended to divide along generational lines, a fact that would become most dramatically obvious during the student protests of the late 1960s. Unlike their parents and their historical experiences with the US, Henschel’s audience would come from the generational cohort whose attitudes toward the US, within the context of the student protests of the late 1960s, were defined to a large degree by the Vietnam War and the US’s support of the Iranian government. These culminated in violent mass protest against the Shah’s visit to Berlin in 1967 (which resulted in the police shooting of a young protester named Benno Ohnesorg, which, in turn, radicalized further protests).26 Both events dramatically brought into focus an aspect of the Cold War that differed substantially from, for example, the Soviet invasion of Hungary (1956) and, later, Czechoslovakia (1968); that is, US allies such as West Germany were confronted with the problem of defining their own position in the Cold War by way of actions widely considered deplorable, committed not by the enemy but by their own dominant ally. The recurrence of the theme of insubordination, inherited by the 1960s youth protesters from their parents’ generation in a historically different context, is driven by the renewed urgency of the question of how individual morality should respond to formal legal and military discipline. Of course, it would be far-fetched to assert that the young television audience rallying around Henschel’s Alpha Alpha in 1972 was politically aligned with radical anti-American protesters half a decade earlier. Given the split between the more radical tradition that was to lead to the political terrorism of the RAF and the sublimation of political anger into the countercultural movement that was to become the Green Party, a strongly politicized youth audience would probably have rejected outright the medium of television on political grounds. Still, it is obvious that the reverberations of the more radical political movement redefining the German-American relationship would reach this larger, less strongly politicized audience. This dilution of more radical political positions in Alpha Alpha is noticeable in the series’ mainstreaming of issues derived from more radical politics: it advocates the primacy of the individual conscience over bureaucratic discipline yet fails to show the full extent to which this may require personal sacrifice; it embraces, to one degree or another, its origins in imported cultural traditions yet posits a heroic protagonist whose actions undercut many of the ethical implications of these traditions; and it evokes the full extent of social, technological, military, and social paranoia of Cold War culture yet imposes upon these dramatic conflicts humanist resolutions that are insufficient or irreconcilable with the problems they are intended to solve.27 For those inclined to be critical, the mainstreaming of political ideas might very well be the series’ essential shortcoming. But then again, the delivery of these ideas occurs in a medium geared toward social and </page> <page sequence="17"> A GERMAN HERO FOR THE COLD WAR 97 ideological consensus, establishing formal and ideological boundaries difficult to cross. After all, a more radical politics was, by 1972, already beginning to drift toward the murky waters of criminality (1972 saw, for example, the passing of a blacklisting law banning from civil service those considered to have left-wing leanings). In this broader historical context, Alpha Alpha articulates individual and collective desires for utopian transformation on the personal and national scale, a project for which Henschel deserves credit. In the final instance, perhaps we can read Alpha Alpha—with its cautiously negotiated domestication of two imported American genres—as a barometer of the relative pressures upon and within German politics under the difficult circumstances of the Cold War. NOTES Acknowledgement: an abbreviated version of this essay was presented at the 2011 Eaton Conference in Riverside; I am grateful to the organizers and participants for the opportunity to discuss and rethink some of its ideas. I would also like to thank the Zweite Deutsche Fernsehen , which generously opened its archives to me and, among its staff, first and foremost Axel Bundenthal and Nicole Schmid for offering practical advice. I would also like to thank Wolfgang F. Henschel for sharing his personal memories of the production of Alpha Alpha. 1. A complete list of episodes, including the original broadcast dates and brief plot summaries, is provided in the appendix. 2. “As early as 1964, [Henschel’s] directorial debut aired on the ZDF, a film about Trude Hesterberg, on whose cabaret stage Brecht had been appearing in the 1930s. Over 100 pieces of work were to follow, most of them satire and literary adaptations [of works by Ringelnatz, Tucholsky, Klabund, Meyrink, and other writers of the 1920s and ‘30s]. Frequently, there were experimental forms, playfully exploring magnetic recording technology in order to deploy the visual language of the medium in relation to each unique subject matter” (Henschel email, 12 Apr. 2011). Henschel himself attributes his forays into genre material, especially the police procedural, to his intention not to “turn into the network’s token leftie.” 3. I am borrowing the concept of the “genre auteur” in its broadest form from Linda Badley, who uses it specifically to describe directors working in the horror genre, recognizing the fact that “television has been regarded predominantly as a writer’s medium rather than a director’s medium” (Chapman 3). Though Henschel, responsible for both writing and directing Alpha Alpha, seems to fit the auteurist mold in terms of artistic control and consistency of vision within this single project, he also resists the auteurist label to the degree that his entire body of work defies affinities to any particular genre, a complication adding to Chapman’s contention that “the marginalization of popular genre series has to do with the nature of television authorship” in general (3). 4. Like Vogler himself, who appeared in numerous German productions, as well as in American films (e.g., as Erwin Rommel in Patton [1970]), his two fellow actors came with solid credentials. Lilith Ungerer worked with Rainer Werner Fassbinder on Katzelmacher (Foreign Worker, 1969) and Warum läuft Herr R. Amok? (Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?, 1970); Arthur Brauss’s career included German films (e.g., Die Angst des Tormanns beim Elfmeter [The Goalie’s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick, 1972]) and international productions (Sam Peckinpah’s Steiner—The Iron Cross [1976]). 5. Given the production and broadcast schedule of the series, this location, the Munich Olympic village, had not yet undergone the radical shift in significance that was </page> <page sequence="18"> 98 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) to come in September of 1972 with the terrorist attack on the Israeli Olympic team (Alpha Alpha’s final episode was broadcast on 2 Aug. 1972). At the time Henschel incorporated this location into his series, it was generally seen as a milestone of high modern architecture, a site emblematic of West German accomplishment or, more specifically, of West German integration into the international community of nations (the last time Germany had hosted the games had been 1936). The scene in which the site appears shows a crucial step in Dahlen’s recruitment: its vantage point is a panoramic long shot with the city of Munich in the background, suggestive of the panoptic surveillance of global modernity by the Organization. The opening credit sequence is composed of similar images of spaces emblematic of “the modern world”—an urban shopping district, a radiotelescopic array, the housing of a nuclear power plant, and partial shots of modern industrial office and laboratory spaces, all interspersed with close-ups of Michael Dahlen facing the camera and extreme close-ups of his eyes, watchfully surveying these spaces in search of instability and danger. 6. In a discussion of the relationship between German film and television during the late 1960s and early 1970s, Karl Prümm points to a “contingent field of boundary crossings and mutual influence” that increasingly brings both media into alignment—in terms of personnel, but also of aesthetics (513). As a result of this new permeability, television’s initial programmatic commitment to documentary realism is opened up to an increasing awareness of cinematic form and spectacle—the result of which can be seen in the aesthetics of Alpha Alpha. For the complete account of these historical transformations, see Prümm. 7. Henschel and Meyer’s style also incorporates the following elements:  a) eccentric framing: actors are often placed at the extreme edge of the frame, mostly horizontally but occasionally also vertically; in close-ups or medium close-ups, the edge of the frame often runs through the actor’s head, leaving only the face itself in the frame (in profile shots); in case of frontal facial shots, only one side is within the frame, emphasizing symmetry through the suggestion that all relevant visual information is available in only half of it. b) eccentric framing aided by shot-reverse angle shots: in many dialogue sequences, one actor’s body or face is placed at the extreme edge of the frame, while the other actor appears, in the reverse-angle shot, either on the same side or on the opposite side of the frame; these compositions create dynamic gradations of distance along consistent eye-line sights between edits; c) symmetrical shots: great emphasis is placed on symmetrical compositions, especially during scenes in which two characters—antagonistically or complimentarily—exchange short lines of dialogue; often, an object is placed in the center of the shot, with each character facing the other in profile on opposite sides of that object; d) multiple-plane flat-focus shots: objects in the foreground of the shot are integrated into compositions that feature actors entering or moving, in focus, in the background; out-of-focus objects in the foreground thus occupy a similar amount of space within the frame as the actors. 8. All translations from the original German, unless otherwise noted, are the author’s. 9. The Krimihomepage, for example, treats the show primarily as mystery instead of science fiction &lt;krimiserien.heim.at/6/alpha_alpha.htm&gt;, and the show’s entry on the fan page Serien im Deutschen Fernsehen notes that “possibly, audiences weren’t ready yet for thus [sic] show” &lt;www.tvder60er.de/tvserien/tvser230.htm&gt;. </page> <page sequence="19"> A GERMAN HERO FOR THE COLD WAR 99 10. My own terminology is influenced by Hickethier, who considers “adventure” as an “intermediary field in between the historically determined special areas of crime, Western, and science fiction films, as well as those narratives taking place in the present, which emphasize adventure and suspense and deal with people in extreme situations and under exceptional pressures” (360). 11. Britton points out, in a discussion of The Man from U.N.C.L.E., that those involved in the making of the show had a clear awareness of its fantastic elements, and thus considered it as pure escapism irrelevant to any political reality of the Cold War. Irony and parody, one might suspect, were thus written much more deeply into the texts of the genre, even in its apparently more serious or straightforward manifestations. See Britton, Spy Television (41). 12. Given the presence of these self-consciously ironic elements in the Bond films (and even more so in the two Flint films), it is perhaps more appropriate to read these different versions of the material as coexistent types or variants within the same genre, rather than as stages in a chronological development toward exhaustion and, finally, obsolescence. 13. As if to illustrate the absence of a viable indigenous genre tradition on television, Henschel himself describes his encounters with science fiction exclusively in terms of literature: “From early on, I have been a reader of science fiction, starting in my youth with classics like Oliver [sic] Dominik, Jules Verne, etc.; later, I moved from pure entertainment to contemporary literature, like Wells, Orwell, Huxley, Čapek, Lem, and others. What I found extremely entertaining was ... the American format of the ‘SF story.’ Several collections taken from Galaxy, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, etc. became available in Germany in paperback and quickly became my favorite reading. I found it interesting to watch how scientific and technological utopias would gradually make room for psychological and sociological themes, driven by doubts about the much-praised technological progress and social institutions. Faced with a menacing future, the search for a positive vision seemed to be on” (Henschel email, 12 Apr. 2011). The short-story format obviously provided the narrative template for Alpha Alpha with its 25-minute program slot. 14. The story is also the source of Elio Petri’s La Decima Vittima (1965), an earlier adaptation that foregoes Menge’s “reality TV” approach in favor of a 1960s pop art sensibility. The influence of Sheckley’s story also resonates in Stephen King’s The Running Man, adapted as an Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle by Paul Michael Glaser in 1987. 15. Further evidence of this cross-fertilization between German film and television during the same period and right after would be Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s “virtual- reality head trip” Welt am Draht (World on a Wire, 1973), based on Daniel F. Galoye’s novel Simulacron-3 (1964). Shot “as a riot of vertiginous mirrored compositions and eye- popping modernist décor” by a notable auteurist filmmaker, Welt am Draht was produced not for theatrical release but for the Westdeutscher Rundfunk/WDR (see Lim). 16. A minor modification to this “American future” in Raumpatrouille is the recognition that the future might be international: within the larger paradigm of American domination, a crew composed of representatives of several nations, among them members of Eastern European nations, illustrates both the limitations of the Cold War framework and the desire to break free of them. 17. None of the available written sources specify the spelling of the character’s first name, but given the larger pattern within which this single detail takes its place, it is reasonable to assume that the name is spelled with an “o” rather than an “a.” </page> <page sequence="20"> 100 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) 18. John Brunner’s Stand on Zanzibar was published in 1968. Though Brunner was already known to German readers at that time, a German translation of this novel was not published until 1980 (German title Morgenwelt [Heyne, 1980]). 19. In reference to The Prisoner, Britton states that “undercover operatives often questioned the motives and methods of such agencies” (Spy Television 12). Unlike the wave of paranoid conspiracy fiction, cinema, and television emerging after Watergate, primarily from the US during the latter half of the 1970s, popular culture during the 1950s and 1960s had yet to evolve to this degree of multilateral paranoia. For its time and medium, The Prisoner was less representative than Patrick McGoohan’s prior show Danger Man (1960-62, 1964-68). 20. Episodes following this structure tend to end with the accidental or deliberate destruction or loss of the destabilizing technology—a somewhat contrived if convenient solution. One might blame Henschel for sidestepping some of the more troubling implications of this technology by ensuring that this conflict remains limited to the one single case the audience has just witnessed. I consider this narrative move a mechanism for the containment of Cold War anxieties. 21. It is crucial to note that the tradition of the spy thriller, starting with its literary heritage and extending into film and television, splits into what James Chapman, in reference to critic Michael Denning, labels as opposing traditions, with one serving as a complement or even corrective to the other: on the one hand, the “magical” or “sensational” thriller “based on narratives of action and pursuit, requiring physical courage and endurance on the part of the hero who uncovers the conspiracy and defeats the villain” (21); on the other hand, the “existential” or “realist” thrillers that “[explore] the moral ambiguities and uncertainties of the spying game and [question] the values of patriotism and duty that are so prominent in the sensational thriller” (21-22). Useful as this typology is, it also reveals that Henschel’s protagonist shares some of the elements of the first type while abstaining from the surrender to paranoia and existential angst of the second type. For further discussion of the two traditions, see also Britton,“From George Smiley to Bernard Sampson.” 22. In generic hybrids of this type that shift the emphasis from science fiction to the spy thriller in their deployment of a frame of reference for technology, the results are predictable. With regard to The Avengers, for example, Keith Booker notes that there is “very little in the way of an attempt to imagine actual technological developments that might change the texture of life in the future [as Alpha Alpha does]” 41). The fact that The Avengers treats “its science fiction themes playfully and without any serious consideration of the sorts of speculative issues that inform the best science fiction” not only illustrates its primary alliance to the spy thriller, but also demonstrates, in opposition to Alpha Alpha, the spy thriller’s inability to generate or legitimize certain political positions. 23. Interestingly enough, West German popular culture would have to wait until the early 1980s for a pop-cultural icon in the genre of the police procedural to embody the ethos of insubordination—a police inspector in the popular Tatort crime series named Horst Schimanski, who made his first appearance in June 1989 while the (to quote Knut Hickethier) “rarity” (236) of a German sf television series, Raumpatrouille, already provided such a figure in the fall of 1966. For a full discussion of the impact, especially, of West German remilitarization in 1955 on this show and its representation of insubordination, see my “Raumpatrouille.” 24. While my main argument pursues a single line of inquiry by following the theme of insubordination, the series does raise a variety of issues pertinent to the question of </page> <page sequence="21"> A GERMAN HERO FOR THE COLD WAR 101 what may be uniquely German in its themes. Episode 5, for example, in which an underground military installation becomes a deadly labyrinth Dahlen and his partner must penetrate, suggests, in a way reminiscent of Nigel Kneale’s Quatermass II (1955), national unease with an American military presence, shrouding itself in ominous secrecy, on one’s own soil. Episode 9, in which a scientist inadvertently broadcasts his lab animal’s emotional states to the surrounding population, posits such highly technological alien spaces embedded in the fabric of one’s own familiar environment as the source of public panic and paranoia. 25. Conversely, that experience might have been enhanced by this generation’s collective memories of their encounter with the Soviet Union, ranging from human rights violations during the conquest and occupation of Berlin in 1945 to the growing divide between East and West Germany culminating in the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961. 26. Not by coincidence, student protests of that period were driven by the critical questioning of their parents’ generation as to their actions and behavior during the Third Reich, providing newly fertile ground for the resurgence of the double themes of insubordination and (collective and individual) amnesia. 27. Henschel himself attributes this tendency toward oversimplification in Alpha Alpha to two distinct sources. During the show’s original run, he considered it a “fairy tale” that was useful as a medium for “transmitting ethical principles, morals, and justice, as well as for issuing warnings against erroneous courses of action.” This blunt didacticism aside, Henschel also credits the “short story format” of the 25-minute episode with, on the one hand, being conducive to a “spontaneous, creative outburst” of speculation, while, on the other hand, absolving him as a writer from the “detailed interrogation and legitimization of the original idea” (Henschel email, 12 Apr. 2011]), a bargain he seemed happy to strike given the urgency of his ideological agenda. APPENDIX  Episode 1, “Die Organisation” (The Organization), broadcast 10 May 1972 After a period of surveillance and a series of covert tests and challenges, high school science teacher Michael Dahlen is recruited as “Alpha”-ranked agent to the mysterious international “Organization,” working secretly for the stabilization of world affairs and the minimization of the risk of global human self-annihilation. Episode 2, “Gedanken sind frei” (Thoughts are free), 17 May 1972 A case of industrial espionage at a defense contractor leads Dahlen to the discovery that the culprit is an employee capable of reading minds. To trick the telepath into revealing his abilities to the world, Dahlen puts the man in a situation of mortal danger from which he can only rescue himself by using his gift. Episode 3, “Wie die Ratten” (Like Rats), broadcast 24 May 1972 Together with four other unsuspecting people, Dahlen is transported on board a space ship as an alien abductee. Exploring their environment, the captives realize that their captors regard them as lab animals. Dahlen devises strategies by which the five can demonstrate their intelligence and humanity to their invisible captors, who eventually release them before they themselves leave the solar system. Episode 4, “Der Astronaut” (The Astronaut), broadcast 31 May 1972 The American astronaut Anderson has vanished from the space capsule during a disastrous accident upon re-entry. Dahlen discovers that Anderson is hiding at his parents’ home from the press and the military. At the moment of greatest danger, </page> <page sequence="22"> 102 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) Anderson managed to teleport himself to safety. Shielded by the Organization, which sees the destabilizing effects of Anderson’s ability as a risk to the world, Anderson is given a new identity in anonymity. Episode 5, “Omega schweigt” (Omega is silent), broadcast 7 June 1972 After an underground military installation suddenly and mysteriously shuts down, Dahlen and a fellow agent infiltrate the complex. Making their way through a maze of lethal security systems, they discover that a scientist developing a hypnotic technology for curing claustrophobia has accidentally immobilized all bunker personnel.

Henschel’s series Alpha Alpha brought together elements of science fiction and the spy thriller, two genres imported largely from the U.S. that dominated the West German television landscape. Reproducing this hybrid genre in a national register provided writer and director Henschel with the opportunity to depart from the stereotypical settings, characters, and plot lines. Using science fiction to access and interrogate the spy thriller, Henschel attempted to transcend and challenge the rigid binaries organizing Cold War politics. The series’ benign humanitarian postulate of individual ethical integrity overriding systemic technocratic and bureaucratic power makes the series symptomatic of a 1970s shift in German attitudes toward the U.S. in the wake of radical student protests against American foreign policy. </page> </plain_text>
