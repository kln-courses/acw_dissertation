<plain_text><page sequence="1">Helskog, K. (ed.) Theoretical perspectives in rock art research. Oslo: The Institute for Comparative Research in Human Culture. ISBN: 82-7099-338-7 (hardback). 330 pp., figures, tables and references. Price: NOK 395; Euro 50.60. This collection of papers provides an excellent sample of the wide range of issues on theoretical perspectives in rock art. This is the second volume arising from the 1998 ALTA Conference on Rock Art. The first publication, Perceiving Rock Art: Social and Political Perspectives (Helskog &amp; Olsen 1995), arose from the 1993 ALTA conference. The subject matter of the book under review here was conceived shortly after the first conference. This publication maintains the high standard established in the previous publication. The papers in Theoretical perspectives in rock art research are divided into several sections: theoretical perspectives in rock art research, beliefs, cultural/ritual landscapes and gender. These, then, are the main themes of this volume. The papers highlight the importance of being explicit about the theoretical perspectives that are guiding rock art research. The first section on theoretical perspectives includes papers by J. David Lewis-Williams, John Clegg, Christopher</page><page sequence="2">114 South African Archaeological Bulletin 57 (176): 104-116, 2002 Chippindale, David Vogt, Paul Tagon and David Whitley. The papers in this section are focussed, from different viewpoints, on the importance of theory, appropriate methods for the study of rock art and the problem of understanding its meaning and significance. David Lewis- Williams' and John Clegg's papers are generic in approach while the rest of the papers in this section address the theme from a regional perspective that is influenced by the historiographic tradition of each region. David Lewis-Williams focuses on the topics of understanding and knowledge, defending the possibility of understanding the range of meanings communicated by rock art, using appropriate theoretical and methodological tools. He makes a distinction between 'polysemy' (having many meanings) and 'multivocality' (having many voices) to show how rock art may have multiple communicating meanings to its original viewers. He presents also a discussion between scientific realism and post-modem relativism. He characterises the post-modem philosophical position as contending that 'the meanings of rock art are all factitious [sic]-made up by researchers' and argues for a form of meaning that relates to a real, though past, world. John Clegg's paper focuses on the methods needed to understand variability and its causes. He establishes a difference between rational and intuitive approaches and between a 'resource-driven approach' (in which research begins with recording and analysing the evidence and proceeds to inquiry into the questions that this evidence can address) and 'problem-driven approach' (where the researcher begins with a question to be answered). In our view, both approaches can be productive but it is usually of greater value to the discipline if the research is directed towards an overall question rather than emerging from site descriptions. Apart from this, it is important to recognise the recursive relationship among theory, method and data. The other papers in this section address the challenges of specific case studies. Chippindale's paper shows the difference between 'informed methods', where it is possible to obtain ethnographic information about rock art, and 'formal methods', which rely on the analysis of formal variation. He applies this to the concept of uniformitarianism in the context of European rock art. Vogt focuses on southern Scandinavian Bronze Age rock art. His paper analyses the research history in this area and its influence in rock art interpretations. Tagon's paper discusses the possibilities of obtaining meaning from rock art. He states that this depends on a range of different factors and on the methods used. This paper outlines the history of rock art research in Australia. Along the same lines, Whitley discusses the evolution of rock art studies in the United States and their relationship to the archaeology of religion. Whitley argues that the serious study of rock art in the United States was delayed by a perceived gap between science and religion. He maintains, however, that rock art can provide a means of bridging this gap and enhancing public understanding of the past through the integration of scientific interpretations and the religious meanings of Native Americans. The second section of this book focuses on beliefs and includes papers by Andrzej Rozwadowski, Paul Tagon &amp; Christopher Chippindale and Trond Klungseth Lodoen. Usually beliefs are used in rock art studies to interpret different motifs or rock art scenes. Papers in this section associate rock art from several regions with different kinds of beliefs in their areas of study. Rozwadowski, in his study of central Asian rock art, associates art with shamanism. Tagon &amp; Chippindale link rock art to recent oral history in Arnhem Land. Lodoen argues that changing beliefs and ideologies associated with changes in settlement patterns during the transition to the Neolithic in western Norway resulted in the abandonment of the practice of producing rock carvings in this region. The third section of Theoretical perspectives in rock art research concentrates on cultural and ritual landscapes. It includes papers by Richard Bradley, Janette Deacon and Inger-Marie Olsrud. In recent decades the relevance of landscape has been demonstrated in all levels of archaeological interpretation, including rock art studies. Bradley's paper focuses on the remote location of abstract figures in prehistoric European rock art. Deacon's paper relates shamanistic beliefs to the placement of the art, while the paper by Olsrud uses the landscape as a medium for understanding the ritual context in which paintings were made and used during the Bronze Age. Taken together, these papers provide a range of useful insights into relationships between landscape and rock art. The fourth and last section focuses on gender and includes papers by Ericka Engelstad, Gro Mandt and Thomas Dowson. Gender is an area of interpretation that has developed a strong archaeological profile in recent decades and is becoming increasingly important to archaeological and rock art studies. Engelstad's paper analyses anthropomorphic figures in the hunter-gatherer rock art of Scandinavia through the lens of feminist discussions concerning the concepts of sex, sexuality, gender, the body and embodiment. Mandt denounces the lack of gender questions in rock art research. She argues that this is not caused by a lack of information concerning gender in rock art but by the androcentric biases of our own social contexts. Dowson offers a sociology of the study of rock art by examining the impact of sexual politics on academic traditions of research. In all, these papers provide a valuable addition to both rock art and gender studies. The geographic regions included in this volume include southern Africa, Scandinavia, the United States, Australia, Europe, central Asia and North America. Periods range from the Upper Palaeolithic to the ethnographic present. The papers in this volume demonstrate that, while it is virtually impossible to understand the intended meaning of rock art from past societies, meaning can be assessed in terms of function and that ethnographic studies can provide theoretical models that can be tested against patterning in rock art from past societies. One of the limitations of the book is the absence of non- European perspectives, from regions such as from Asia or South America; even when the data come from such regions</page><page sequence="3">South African Archaeological Bulletin 57 (176): 104-116, 2002 115 the contributor is based in a European institution. In addition, while there is much discussion about indigenous rock art, none of the papers is authored or even co-authored by an indigenous person. The outcome is that all of the contributors to this book are writing from the perspective of a European system of knowledge. Not only does this marginalize indigenous peoples and researchers from developing countries, it also severely limits the intellectual horizons of the book. This is particularly unfortunate given that the ALTA conferences are well funded so that it is well within the abilities of the conference organizers to include these other perspectives. Over all, Theoretical perspectives in rock art research is well produced. It has many black and white illustrations. Though not presented in a glossy format, the illustrations are clear and easy to decipher. The book is well presented though there are occasional typographical errors (such as the font size in the Layton reference on p. 65) and inconsistencies (such as discrepancies in the formatting of lists both within and between chapters). Also, there are stylistic inconsistencies in the formatting of references for each chapter (for example variation in the use of upper or lower case for book titles). Apart from this, it is not always easy to locate information as there is no list of tables and figures. These problems do not detract from the quality of the arguments presented in the book but could have been avoided through better proof-reading. This book fills an important gap in rock art research. The papers in this volume highlight not only the need for an explicit theoretical understanding of rock art research but also the necessity of understanding the manner in which theory articulates with method. Theoretical perspectives both direct the questions guiding scholarly enquiry and determine the methods that will be used in data collection and analysis. Taken together, the papers in this volume provide a valuable range of perspectives on contemporary theoretical directions in rock art research. Reference Helskog, K. &amp; Olsen, B. 1995.
