<plain_text><page sequence="1">London The Arts Council, in conjunction with the Association Franqaise d'Action Artistique, is holding an exhibition of the work of Toulouse-Lautrec at the Tate Gallery. The majority of the seventy-two paintings, seventeen drawings and one poster have been lent by the Musde Toulouse-Lautrec at Albi. At his death in 1901 Lautrec's mother took possession of the contents of his studio. For many years afterwards the Comtesse Addle and Maurice Joyant, childhood friend of Lautrec and director of the Paris branch of the Goupil art gallery, had been looking for a suitable home for these works. Their opportunity came in 1907 when the episcopal Palais de la Berbie at Albi became state, and then municipal, property on condition that it be made into a museum. Finally, in 1922, Joyant's persistent negotiations reached a successful conclusion when the museum became the official residence of Toulouse- Lautrec's works. Although it is regrettable that a larger, more important show could not have been organized, the exhibition at the Tate Gallery provides a satisfactory survey. All his life Lautrec was preoccupied with movement, in the beginning with horses and later with can-can dancers, acrobats, athletes and circus people who afforded such a striking contrast to his own physical disabilities. His most valuable asset was his eye: keen, penetrating and able to see the essential lines, features and psychological characteristics at a single glance. It led him to remarkable abbrevia- tions of form, and to an emphasis, by ex- clusion of all inessentials, on the vital fea- tures of a figure. Sometimes, as in the study for the poster of rvette Guilbert, 1894 (45) (see Fig.33) where he has reduced his por- trait to a pointed upturned nose, pursed lips, a jutting chin and long arms and hands expressively clad in black, elbow- length gloves, the exaggerations seem to bear the marks of caricature. In fact, Lautrec's studies of this kind are more pointed characterizations than caricatures whose intentions have a socio-political nature. He was an impartial observer, painting what he saw with feeling, deep comprehension and even humour but without the slightest trace of sentimen- tality, moral overtones, or dramatization. A completely independent painter, he never belonged to a movement and dis- liked artistic theories intensely. He was interested in painting people and the world around him, not landscapes or ideas. There are many points of similarity be- tween Lautrec and Degas, principally in their interest in the formal constructions suggested by Japanese prints and their adaptation of them. They enabled Lautrec to give busy indoor scenes, such as La Goulue and Valentin le Disossd au Moulin Rouge (27), I891, spatial clarity that re- sulted from the simplification of forms and colour overlapped in flat planes, set off by a large figure (Valentin le D6soss6) sharply silhouetted in the foreground and re- stricted by the frame. This was a method ideally suited to his posters where, in the one of May Belfort (90), 1895, for example, flat colours, sharp silhouettes and a pro- vocative placing of the figure are strikingly effective. Like Degas, again, he was fascinated by radical viewpoints and line and movement in the creation of spon- taneous visions of candid portraiture. In the choice ofsubjects, too, they were alike: horses, the theatre, dancers, the circus, brothels, women at their toilette, milliners, laundresses and portraits of friends and family. But there the similarities end; for Degas looked at his subjects with an im- personal eye and used them only as a means of evolving formal effects of line, shape, colour and composition, while the nature of the person portrayed was the most important objective for Lautrec. Toulouse-Lautrec's versatility of style and subject matter is displayed with extra- ordinary clarity in this exhibition. The Portarit of the Comtesse Adale in the Drawing Room at Malrome 1887 (16) (see Fig.34) is a scene of charming intimacy carefully painted in some detail with short, criss- cross strokes or stipling which shows his awareness, not only of Pointillist discover- ies but also of Van Gogh's technique of I887 in pictures such as the Boulevard de Clichy, which was derived from the same source. This portrait of his mother pre- sents a striking contrast to the Yvette Guilbert of seven years later (Fig.33). After 1892 he frequented the brothels, both as places of warmth and friendship and as subject matter for his paintings. The Salon in the Rue des Moulins, 1894 (5i) is his most considered statement about this world, and the culmination of his research into the Japanese print. Toulouse-Lautrec was one of those rare painters whose life can- not be separated from his work, each being a complement of the other, and his paint- ings, drawings and lithographs serve as a visual diary of his movements and en- counters. And the picture he creates of life in Paris in the I88o's and I890's is the most vivid that has come down to us. The exhibition closes on I5th March. A sculptor of some importance and achievement is F. E. McWilliam who shows at the Waddington Galleries thirty- one bronzes executed between I958 and 1960 varying in size from monumental effigies to small, anthropomorphic studies of humanity entitled Bone Form, Bone Roll and Square Head. Tall, emaciated and ravaged human beings who seem to have reverted to an almost ectoplasmic state remind us of Giacometti. Sheets and hunks of welded metal are grouped into abstract arrangements of shapes that have symbolic and allegorical connotations. McWilliam's work is not too distant from that of Cesar and Paolozzi. British sculptors have made their mark on the world, and McWilliam shows himself to be a worthy member of the group. Until 4th March. The Matthiesen Gallery's first sculpture exhibition is devoted to John Hoskin, a young sculptor of promise but little fame. His material is steel, welded together in great sheets with heavy contrast between polished surfaces and roughly worked edges. Often a grid arrangement of steel rods is driven as a deep relief into the smooth, shiny surfaces. There is a strong feeling of tension in Hoskin's work be- tween the rather strict geometricity of the formal organization of the steel sheets and the animalistic or anthropomorphic con- nexions the sculptures invoke. His is a strange world of robots equipped with mechanical eyes and mouths, of fictional "I5</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT AND FORTHCOMING EXHIBITIONS monsters whose spikes and enormous out- stretched feelers try to envelop the spec- tator. This conflict between the geometric and the organic is the most compelling feature of Hoskin's work. He received no academic training but was apprenticed to Lynn Chadwick whose influence he has yet to shake off completely. Until i8th March. In the collection of small nineteenth and twentieth-century drawings at the Kaplan Gallery is a delicate portrait by Gauguin in charcoal and crayon of his wife, Mette, executed in the early I88o's. A very early sketch of three nudes by Vuillard shows a sensitive touch and was almost certainly drawn at the Acadtmie Julian in I888. Other works of interest are coloured draw- ings of landscapes by Sisley and Pissarro. A fascinating work is Picasso's earliest bronze depicting a seated, melancholic woman who is the same model as he used in many of his Blue period paintings. Gimpel Fils held in February a retro- spective exhibition of paintings by William Gear (born I915), a leading Scottish painter whose work has been described as 'abstract impressionism'. In his latest, most successful, paintings he builds, upon a web or latticework of black lines, a strongly vertical composition consisting of carefully controlled patches of fuzzily out- lined colour seen through ribbed glass. The effect is like that of early Byzantine mosaics, it has elements descending from Cezanne's 'cubistic' approach to light and colour, and reminds us distantly of com- positions by Bazaine and Manessier. Gear's rapid development is proof of a sophisti- cated talent that shows a high degree of sensitivity to form and colour. The I2th Exhibition of the Young Con- temporaries at the RBA Galleries consisted of 257 paintings, drawings, prints and sculpture by students from many art schools. As is natural perhaps, these young artists made no radical departure from concepts established by their elders. There was little realism here, and one even had a feeling that it had been consciously avoid- ed. The Young Contemporaries' favourite mode was abstract expressionism derived from England and America, and though some of these paintings show talent, there was a general lack of control of composi- tion and colour. A very common element was graffiti and the use of catch phrases that did not enhance the compositions but, rather, struck a note of pretentious clever- ness. The most impressive of the painters was Peter Phillips whose originality took the form of geometric abstraction, the introduction of elements of everyday life, such as the British flag, game boards and numbers, and a keen sense of colour con- trasts and harmonies. Peter Twombley wavered between geometric abstraction and expressionism with well-composed pictures created out of pieces of sack cloth cut into effective shapes and interspersed with sharp bursts of colour. The Marlborough Gallery is presenting another good display of nineteenth and twentieth-century drawings, water-colours and sculpture. Among the late nineteenth- century works, Degas' charcoal study of Quatre Danseuses en Repos for the painting Au Foyer de la Danse, c.I879, Cezanne's water-colour of Le Moulin sur la Rivibre, c. Igoo, Van Gogh's water-colour of Le Sisserand of I884 and Vuillard's La Porte of I892 in brush, ink and wash should be noted. There are three fine drawings of female nudes of I906 by Picasso and a bronze head, Tite de Femme, 1908, in the style of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. The bronze Buste de Madame Schuffenecker, 188go, by Gauguin and his carved wine barrel and decorated ceramic pot, both executed in Pont-Aven, i889-90, are of special in- terest. The six drawings and nine small bronzes by Henry Moore are unexcep- tional. MICHEL STRAUSS</page><page sequence="3">33. Yvette Guilbert, by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Study for a poster. 1894.
