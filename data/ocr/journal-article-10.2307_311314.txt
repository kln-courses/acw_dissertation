TO understand more clearly archaic Greek poetry and art in their original context, we must delve ever more deeply into the archaic memory, identifying the semantic and iconographical associations con- temporaries brought to the process of constructing a meaning for the poems and works of art that confronted them. Increasing sensitivity to this process of interaction between cultural artifacts and their "readers"2 has led both literary scholars and art historians to pay more attention than ever to formal, ceremonial occasions-rituals in a broad sense. Poems might be composed for such occasions, hymns or 1 This paper is a revised version of a James Loeb Classical Lecture delivered on 15th October 1992. I thank Prof. D. G. Mitten for his kind invitation to give that lecture, and I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude to him and his colleagues and students in the Department of the Classics, Harvard University, for their stimulating reactions to my talk and for their genuinely sympotic hospitality. More long-standing debts of gratitude for moral and scholarly support at various stages in my continuing study of archaic epigrams are owed to A. E. Raubitschek, P. A. Hansen, M. B. Wallace, L. P.

Day dithyrambs for festivals, for example, or monodies for the symposium, thiasos, or komos. Or again, narrative poetry or occasional song repeated outside its original context could easily evoke a representation of such occasions for audiences steeped in the archaic "song culture."3 Works of art might be crafted for these same occasions, as gifts or prizes or offerings, for example, or equipment to be used in the rituals.4 Or again, the artist could narrate or refer symbolically to ritual, so the object would stand as a memorial of a sacrifice, funeral, or athlete's victory. Awareness of the centrality of ritual is helping to breach the walls that divide philologists from art historians;5 but insufficient attention is being paid to artifacts that in themselves belong to both scholarly spheres. I refer to works of art bearing inscriptions, especially those in recognizable poetic meters,6 i.e., epigrams. In the following study of early epigrams on dedicated objects, I shall argue that one function of the archaic dedication was to cause viewers to interact with the object in such a way as to produce, in their eyes, their mouths and ears, and their minds, a representation of the original ritual act of dedication. By looking at the objects themselves and placing them in context in a liv- ing sanctuary, and especially by comparing the epigrams to various kinds of occasional poetry, I hope to illustrate what associations, espe- cially semantic ones, contemporaries brought to this interaction and how the dedications triggered these associations. 3 See, e.g., C.

INTERACTING WITH MANTIKLOS' STATUETTE Let us begin with the bronze statuette of a partly nude youth, proba- bly dedicated in a Theban sanctuary early in the seventh century, now in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts.7 Contemporary visitors to the sanc- tuary would engage this object in an interactive process we might envisage as beginning when the statuette caught their eyes from across the temenos, stirring their curiosity enough to ask, "What is that shining metal object over there?"8 Our viewers would identify it generically as a dedication, an dv6~lgota, but a variety of associations would enrich that identification. For example, finely wrought objects of metal gener- ally serve specialized functions in Homer, as they did in real life in the seventh century.9 They were gifts exchanged among aristocrats or given by them to the dead or to gods in the course of elaborate rituals of hos- pitality, marriage, sport, burial, sacrifice, or the like. Our viewers would categorize the statuette as belonging to one type of such gifts, dedications to the gods, traditionally offered amid sacrificial rituals. As our visitors approached the figurine, they could answer a more specific question: "Who is represented?" The now-lost bow in the stat- uette's left hand would identify it as Apollo by evoking memories of his exploits as an archer, but the attribute would also help viewers integrate the statue into the sanctuary's living context. They would know of Apollo's archery from hymns sung amid grand festivals, perhaps in that very sanctuary. The statuette praises the god visually in the same way hymns do verbally; and at another level, as a hymn or paean might include a kletic prayer requesting the god's presence, the statuette brings the god before a viewer's eyes in a kind of epiphany. 10 At this point, our viewers might ask "Who dedicated this Apollo?" A priest or guide might answer, perhaps embellishing the response 7 See G. M. A. Richter, Kouroi2 (London 1960 = 31970), figs. 9-11; A. P. Kozloff and D. G.

Herodotus learned a great deal from such stories told by garrulous local experts in answer to his queries about impressive monu- ments. The problem is that dedicators could not rely on their dedica- tions' acquiring this sort of story, nor, if one did arise, could they control its transmission over time. In the Theban Ismenion, for instance, some real persons, perhaps in the eighth century, dedicated those tripod-cauldrons on which Herodotus saw inscriptions in (Dot- vtcijtx or Ka8gij't ypdcggaza naming mythical heroes as dedicators. Perhaps early in the sixth century, the local authorities inscribed them, probably as labels to explain an oral tradition that had grown up about the tripods."l The link between the real dedicators' names and their offerings had disappeared-a serious diminution of renown in a society which valued competitive display very highly. Dedicators could avoid this disaster by having their names inscribed on their dedications.12 It is no accident that a high percentage of the earliest surviving Greek alphabetic texts are dedicatory, including about half of all early epigrams. But what are we to make of these inscrip- tions? Nearly all those naming dedicators, whether in prose or verse, are constructed on the basis of the same formula:13 I6 6eiv (i') Av0rlOKE ~E. The paucity of variations and additional elements, and the confining of most such additions to specific metrical positions in epigrams have led many scholars to treat the early dedicatory inscription as a mechanical framework for a name, the shape and word- ing of which would be copied from artists' sample-books or nearby inscriptions.14 This is, however, to interpret the product of a primarily oral culture with the sensibilities of a literate one. Metrical inscriptions, at least, were composed according to the prin- ciples of Greek oral poetry, although they are not transcriptions of oral poetry previously and independently composed.'" Rather, they were 11Hdt. 5.58-61. See S. West, "Herodotus' Epigraphical Interests," CQ N.S. 35 (1985) 278-305, esp. 289-293. 12 J. Svenbro, Phrasikleia, trans. J. Lloyd (Ithaca 1993), chap. 4. 13 This formula accounts for about 75% of the corpus of M. L. Lazzarini, Le formule delle dediche votive nella Grecia arcaica (Rome 1976 [Atti accad. naz. Lincei, Class. sci. morali, Series 8, 19.2]). Most of the remaining 25% follow the pattern: (isp6v) Eit roi3 Ocoi. Among these, additional elements occur very rarely, and only two of the more than 300 examples are metrical. I suspect they belong to a separate tradition, owing its origin to name labels on works of art. 14 See DAA pp. 419-431. For a lack of the "poetic" in epigrams, see M. B. Wallace in D. E.

Nagy, Pindar's Homer (Baltimore</page><page sequence="5">Interactive Offerings: Early Greek Dedicatory Epigrams and Ritual 41 crafted for the monument on which they were written.16 An oral poet composes for live performance; thus, ego is self-referential or refers to the performers. An epigrammatist composes for writing; at least in early inscriptions, ego is the object-"so and so dedicated me." Writing on the object is substituted for live performance, but this "per- formance in writing" remains incomplete until people read out the inscription, lending their voices to the monument's utterance, produc- ing sounds which in turn produce meaning for their own ears and for anyone in earshot. To the extent that poetry consisted in performed lan- guage in verse, then, epigrams were poems. But what kinds of poems? Is there a kind of archaic poetry from which we might discover what associations readers or hearers of these simple texts would bring into play as they construed a fuller message from them? For dedications, the basic formula contains the answer: whoever read it aloud would narrate the dedicator's original act of offering. Contemporaries would recognize a typical feature of archaic poetry, the representation of a ceremonial occasion. They would answer their ini- tial question, "Who dedicated?" But the formula forces them also to say something about the ritual of dedication, a topic that, as we noted earlier, our little bronze Apollo from Thebes might have raised even if it carried no inscription. The simplest versions of the formula merely link dedicator and god with a verb of dedication, usually &amp;v*EOflKE. Even this, as a performed utterance, sounds forth the kleos of the dedi- cator's act;17 but additional elements, generally confined to metrical inscriptions, create a fuller representation of that act. These include features that archaic poetry presents as ritual language, so that when they are read out, the act of dedication appears to be re-created or re- charged. This is not a transcript of an actual performance. In effect, those who read the epigram "imitate" (in the sense of dramatic mime- sis) what the dedicator's ritual utterance might have been. Such would be the case with the pair of hexameters incised on the thighs of our 1990) 18-19, n. 7; 168, n. 95; "Homeric Questions," TAPA 122 (1992) 35-36. 16 A. E.

In sections III, IV, and V below, I shall discuss three typical epi- grammatic adaptations of poetic ritual language, each of which can be illustrated here by reference to Mantiklos' epigram. (1) Epithets for the gods like Mantiklos' F 0 Kap ot &amp;pyuportdiot, drawn from the same store of poetic phraseology as Chryses' prayer in Iliad 1, XOi y et, apyup6to5e (37). (2) Such prayers themselves, especially those con- taining X6pt; or a related word like Mantiklos' xapiFettv, which have ample parallels in hymns and other ceremonial poetry. (3) Self- assertive language with ritual associations, seen in Mantiklos' placing his name first and mentioning a tithe which implies wealth or achievement. As a more striking paradigm, however, I shall discuss the ways epigrams for victorious athletes adapt the form of the herald's proclamation at the games. We must not dismiss these elements of ritual language as late or extraneous additions grafted onto the 0CvFOriK: formula. Their regular presence in the earliest dedicatory inscriptions, most of which are met- rical like Mantiklos', shows that they lie at the heart of the idea of inscribing dedications. We might derive an even more sweeping conclu- sion from looking also at other very old epigrams like those on Nestor's skyphos (CEG 454) and the Dipylon oinochoe (CEG 432). The former reflects a symposium, the latter a dancing competition.18 We could con- clude that the very practice of inscribing verse exhibits a primordial association with elaborate ceremonial occasions. Representing an act of dedication as such a ceremony would thus come naturally from the very beginning. To be sure, others have discussed the parallels between epigrams and ritual language in poetry. Friedlinder and Hoffleit were inclined to view "the dedicatory elegeion as echoing hymns once sung in the ... sacred precincts," and Raubitschek argued that epigrams reflect actual utterances of the dedication ceremony.19 I owe much to these pioneers, 18 See B. B. Powell, Homer and the Origin of the Greek Alphabet (Cambridge 1991) 158-167. 19 P. Friedlinder and H. B. Hoffleit, Epigrammata (Berkeley 1948) 66; Raubitschek (above, n. 16); cf. E. A. Havelock, The Literate Revolution in Greece (Princeton 1982) 185-207.</page><page sequence="7">Interactive Offerings: Early Greek Dedicatory Epigrams and Ritual 43 especially Raubitschek; but their conclusions need rethinking, and the whole investigation requires a more detailed exploration of literary par- allels considered carefully in their contexts. Moreover, we must give due force to Gentili's apt description of the composers of epigrams- and their readers, I should add-as operating "within an orally dissemi- nated tradition, whose formulary, style, and versification were a common patrimony, learned aurally and reutilized for epigraphic composition."20 My concern is the "formulary." Every feature typical in dedicatory epigrams, but rare or unknown in prose inscriptions, has an analogue in conventional wording and motifs employed by archaic poets in contexts of prayer, sacrifice, offering, athletics, gift-giving, or related festive behavior. I suggest we consider the epigram a genre of occasional poetry, which adapted to its own needs elements of a widely known, oral, occasional formulary. When an epigram with such features was read aloud, a fine occasion was represented; but the epigram did not stand alone in this task. The monument itself could contribute to the representation of ritual, and we must review this material selectively before returning to the epigrams. II. DEDICATIONS AS MEMORIALS OF THE ACT OF DEDICATION Any dedicated object refers back to the act of its own dedication, although very few represent that act directly. Rather, just as epigrams often echo language appropriate to various kinds of top-rank rituals in literature, a high percentage of dedications, including many of the most common and the most impressive, look to the greatest public rituals of an archaic sanctuary, viz., sacrifice and the festivity that accompanies it. This should come as no surprise. As a form of the voluntary surrender of a valuable object to a god, dedication was functionally parallel to sacrifice. Moreover, dedications were regularly left as memorials of sacrifice.21 20 Gentili (above, n. 3) 19. 21 Cf. above, n. 17. See also W. H. D. Rouse, Greek Votive Offerings (Cambridge 1902), esp. chapter 8; F. T. van Straten in H. S.

Day Early dedications include much cult equipment. Most impressive are the tripod-cauldrons from Olympia and elsewhere, originally employed in the cult feast and left as memorials of their first use.22 At some point dedicators began offering tripods only for their inherent value, but they would still have called a sacrificial ritual to a viewer's mind, suggesting they were dedicated amid festivity like that the poets describe.23 Dedicators also gave smaller metal vessels and other equip- ment, including spits for roasting meat, which, when not in use, were attached to stands like the one from Perachora with CEG 353 (ca. 625-575): 'OpoiSC; 7to. 0. . 0o OeIt Eoovot I [h']po[tt]. When the spits were reused in subsequent ritual meals, perhaps amid songs for white-armed Hera, the later diners would renew Orsias' origi- nal occasion, and the inscription guaranteed that they would know their predecessor's name and the splendor of his ritual. Finally, one must mention libation bowls, phialai, in gold or bronze or plain terra-cotta, always among the most common dedications. Other dedications allude to the act of offering in a kind of abbrevi- ated narrative. These include images of offerings given as memorials of, or substitutes for, sacrifice, crowns or cakes, for instance, and espe- cially animal victims. Bulls, for example, vary in scale and value from the silver bull at Delphi, perhaps one of Kroisos' dedications, to the countless metal and terra-cotta miniatures.24 The idea of narrating the offering more explicitly may have been imported, to judge from the Samian Heraion at least, where early votaries dedicated many foreign objects that were fully narrative. Especially striking is a seventh- century Egyptian mirror that depicts a woman, presumably representing the dedicator, offering a mirror to Mut, who could be identified with Hera. The hieroglyphic inscription names the goddess by an epithet and contains the woman's prayer to her.25 22 W. Burkert, Greek Religion, trans. J. Raffan (Cambridge, Mass. 1985) 93. 23 Miniature tripods and copies of cult equipment in baser materials indicate that these concepts went quite far down the social scale; cf. Murray (above, n. 4) 26. 24 P. Amandry, "Statue de taureau en argent," BCH Suppl. 4 (1977) 272-293, a refer- ence I owe to Dr. A. A. Ajootian.

One thinks of the painted terra-cotta plaques from the Akropolis,29 or the brilliant wooden one from Pitsa depicting a family in the act of sacrifice, 30 or the marble votive relief from the Akropolis with Athena receiving a family's offerings.31 Many korai dedicated on the Athenian Akropolis hold offerings of crowns, flowers, fruit, rabbits, or birds in one hand, and often that hand extends outward, forming the statue's visual focal point, perhaps originally aimed at an altar.32 Korai represent other aspects of ritual as well. We can associate them with the Delian korai who perform at Apollo's festival in the Homeric Hymn,33 or the Spartan ones who sing Alcman's Partheneion as they bear their offering to the goddess.34 The sculpted kore substitutes for such performers, perpetuating an image of its dedicator's original ritual as that kind of occasion. Dedicated musical instruments, images of musicians, and craters and 26 It is often hard to decide whether anthropomorphic figures holding offerings repre- sent human devotees or the god; cf.

The same is true of portrayals of dance, as on the Akropolis relief plaque with a piper leading three dancing women or goddesses and a child, perhaps the dedicator.35 On a grander scale, I note the Geneleos group from the Samian Heraion:36 six richly attired members of a family on a long base beside the Sacred Way, looking toward the great altar. They are in mid-celebration, the father reclining with his drinking horn, three daughters as korai, the son with his flute, and the seated mother. Even if festivity were not referred to so explic- itly, the placement would imply it, as in the case of kouroi in the Ptoan sanctuary. They may lack attributes and strike a neutral pose, but dedi- cators gave them ritual meaning by placing them on a base with tripods between the temple and the altar.37 They stood as perpetual participants in cult, substituting for their absent dedicators just as the Akropolis korai do. Let us turn now to the epigrams that often accompanied these dedi- cations. III. EPITHETS FOR THE GODS IN EPIGRAMS Since divine epithets are often the sole lexical features distinguish- ing epigrams from prose dedications, and since they seem to reflect only an unspecialized epic formulary for the god, they are often dis- missed as literary allusions tossed in to elevate the tone or fill out half a verse with a poetic tag.38 We might note, however, that nearly all epi- grammatic epithets sometimes appear in poetry in elaborate scenes of gift-giving, sacrificing, and praying or other direct address to a god, and 35 Payne and Young (above, n. 28) 49-50, pl. 128.3. If these are the Charites (quite uncertain; cf. LIMC 3 s.v. Charis no. 20, p. 201), see below, 60. 36 See B.

Craik (ed.), 'Owls to Athens' (Oxford 1990) 245-259. 38 See, e.g., Lazzarini (above, n. 13) 80-84 on Athena's epithets. Epithets in prose inscriptions are much rarer and tend to refer to the locale (e.g., Hera Argeia) or local cult (Zeus Ombrios). I am, of course, not seeking true Kultsprache, but the epigrams' version of the conventional Dichter- or Kunstsprache for representing ritual. For such distinc- tions, see A. Henrichs, "Despoina Kybele" HSCP 80 (1976) 253-286, esp. 261-266 on Athena; I owe this reference to Prof. D. P. Kubiak.</page><page sequence="11">Interactive Offerings: Early Greek Dedicatory Epigrams and Ritual 47 some are especially attracted into these contexts. For example, of five appearances of Zeg; Kpoviov lvao in Homer, one occurs in a context of gift-giving to Zeus and three in prayers to him. In two of the latter, the Achaeans pray for victory, employing language found in similar contexts in epic and epinician poetry, and in agonistic dedicatory epigrams.39 Whoever selected our epithet for CEG 362 may have had these associations in mind (Nemea, ca. 560): "Apto'ig le &amp;v011eK At'i 9poviovt F " lvRKt 40 axvKpdatolv vtoiv zeVyv pdi'ct; i Av Negiat C ei8olvo; Fhtl; t6 KXzolva'o. If the epithet's use here reflects a poetic phraseology of prayer appro- priate in agonistic contexts, whoever read Aristis' inscription aloud would appear to perpetuate the prayer he made while offering this dedi- cation in thanks for his victory. CEG 367, from a Spartan dedication for a military victory, illustrates such a prayer (Olympia, ca. 490-480; Paus. 5.24.3): L8&amp;(Jo FwvLao KpovLJ8a {t) }E A. 'Owvte Xte axv dyahXg htlXFoLt 0~J-to totAa-K&amp;xtgovioLtJc. Most epigrammatic epithets, however, were equally at home in both ritual and other contexts in poetry. Their tendency to appear in the vocative or with unambiguously ritual language like the prayer in CEG 367 might suggest that the ritual associations predominated in the minds of the composers and readers of these epigrams. However, to set the investigation on a firmer footing, we must examine the epithets from a sanctuary about whose rituals we have independent information. Dedications to Athena from the Athenian Akropolis seem ideal subjects.41 39 II. 18.118 is narrative; cf. Hes. Op. 69. For a gift, cf. II. 2.102; for a prayer, 1.502; for prayers for victory, 7.194, 200. Cf. CEG 785, with F Cairns, "A Herm from Histi- aea," Phoenix 37 (1983) 16-37, esp. 25-26. 40 Cf. CEG 384, probably also from an athlete's dedication. 41 I emphasize "seem" because of the notoriously problematic religious topography of the archaic Akropolis. Two studies have been especially helpful: H. A. Shapiro, Art and Cult under the Tyrants in Athens (Mainz am Rhein 1989) 18-47; B. S. Ridgway in J. Neils (ed.), Goddess and Polis (Princeton 1992) 119-142, 210-215.</page><page sequence="12">48 Joseph W. Day Akropolis epigrams do not appear well-suited to my analysis, since they so closely follow the recipe shared with prose inscriptions: "So and so set this up for'A0irvaca." Epithets for the goddess are one regu- lar feature unique to the epigram, but since there are so few of them they are repeated over and over. Thus, I thought it best to take an early sample, from a time when the whole process was fresh to the Atheni- ans. Of thirteen epigrams datable before 550, two certainly contain no epithet (CEG 183, 281). Three without extant epithets are too fragmen- tary to count either way (CEG 186, 187, 289). The remaining eight name Athena as illustrated:42 CEG 180 (ca. 600-575): [ - u &amp;- Avikc Atb]; 96ph[et t66' yiyaoga]. CEG 181 (ca. 600-575; cf. CEG 182, 184, 282, 287, 288): Fv[uu - i' 'vOiKcE At'; y,] .p6int6t 9[6pFt]. CEG 185 (ca. 575-550): [flakI6t pt]toye[vei uu - uu - - -]. I believe these epithets were originally selected to recall Athena's cult on the Akropolis, specifically the Panathenaia. I shall discuss, first, a set of associations linking the epithets and Akropolis dedications gener- ally with Athena as goddess of that festival, and second, specific ties between the epithets and ritual language appropriate to the Panathenaia. Poetic tradition associates our epithets with Athena's armed birth from Zeus' head and other examples of her warlike appearance and exploits.43 This suggests that Akropolis dedicators envisaged the object of their piety as the warrior-protectress Solon presents as Athens' special patron (4.3-4 West): toirl yxp ey6Owco; ~ ioioroC 6 3pttuoitcipr044 In Solon's life, roughly synchronous with the earlier Akropolis epi- grams, this warrior Athena may already have been associated with the Panathenaia, if one or both of two aitia for the festival were current, 42 The next century produces some variations, especially on "daughter of Zeus," but lit- tle besides; cf. below, n. 48.

This link with the Panathenaia becomes archaeologi- cally visible with the surge of artistic production from the second quar- ter of the sixth century, much of it connected with activity on the Akropolis no doubt resulting from the establishment of the quadrennial Greater Panathenaia in 566. Vase painting supplies the clearest evidence, particularly for what became the emblem of the festival, the striding warrior Athena with spear and shield raised. She is best known from Panathenaic and related vases, but she also appears on plaques and vases46 battling giants, leaping from Zeus at her birth, and receiving sacrificial proces- sions that reflect Panathenaic cult. The pottery probably reflects a statue erected around 566 beside an altar that played an important role in Panathenaic cult.47 Dedications to Pallas, Tritogeneia, and the daugh- ter of Zeus may have stood around this altar.48 Another image, the ancient olive-wood Polias, may or may not have represented Athena as warrior, but the embroidered peplos given to her at the climax of the Panathenaia certainly did, portraying her in combat with a giant.49 From around 510, this statue was housed in a new temple, and its sur- viving pedimental Gigantomachy features a striding Athena, thereby tying the exterior decoration to the peplos-wrapped image within.50 This set of associations runs through the public iconographic tradition 45 G.

Day to the east front of the Parthenon: birth on the pediment, Gigantomachy on the metopes, peplos on the Panathenaic frieze.51 Private Akropolis dedications could also reflect the Panathenaia and its warrior goddess. Even the earliest ones allude to the festival, images of cattle looking to the sacrifice (perhaps with CEG 181), lebetes and other metal vessels to the feast (with CEG 180, 281). Horses (perhaps with CEG 186) and other objects were probably set up by victors in the competitions.52 Perirrhanteria would have been used in the cult (CEG 183-185). After 566, private dedications proliferated dramatically,53 and many refer to the Panathenaia. Some of those plaques and vases representing sacrifice to the armed Athena in a manner reminiscent of Panathenaic cult were dedicated on the Akropolis.54 We can add to these the votive reliefs mentioned earlier, and the tradition leads ulti- mately to the Parthenon frieze.55 Most if not all the Akropolis korai must at some level have called to mind the kanephoroi, arrephoroi, and other young women who participated in the Panathenaia, many of whom reappear on the Parthenon frieze.56 Finally, the emblematic Athena appears on Panathenaic amphoras presumably dedicated by the victors who won them, as bronze votive statuettes,57 and in early painted Gigantomachies all from the years after 566 and all dedicated on the Akropolis.58 We can hypothesize that these dedicators were either commemorat- ing their participation in the Panathenaia or appropriating its prestige for their private acts of offering.

One cannot help but compare the Panathenaia, with its proces- sion to the possibly seated63 Athena Polias on the Akropolis, its hekatomb, and its dedication of the peplos, all of which suggest to some that the passages in Iliad 6 are Athenian interpolations. This would indicate that the epithets were Panathenaic, but it is probably untrue.64 Nor did the epigrams' composers simply copy Iliad 6, though that too would guarantee the epithets' ritual character. Rather, in poetic tradition, these epithets were at home in, among other places, ritual phraseology appropriate to grand public prayer and offering to Athena, perhaps especially as (?armed) protectress of an akropolis. Anyone speaking formally-that is, in poetry-would draw upon that phraseol- ogy to represent such ritual. This would account for a poet's employing the epithets as they are in Iliad 6 and for their presence in an epigram representing a dedicator's act of offering as ritual of the highest rank. Such epithets used epigraphically on the Akropolis at least after 566 would seem likely to supply a reference to the Panathenaia, even with- out the other associations seen above. Two poetic passages would give us an explicit link to the festival, if they are snatches of Panathenaiac song, an unprovable suggestion in either case.

CEG 435 begins similarly (,tv 8[p]6py9v : An[oeacv], followed by names), and continues on a separate surface: [htponto]toi tbv &amp;ySva O[]ok v yTL[alo]y6i[t[it] 96.p[EL]. Each inscription records, in prose, the names of men who were in charge of a 8p96og,, presumably a racetrack or races themselves or games as a whole. Each concludes with a hexameter saying they estab- lished or had charge of an 6&amp;y, apparently a festival as a whole. CEG 434 seems to refer to the first (ntpo'rot) reorganized Greater Panathenaia and 435 to one of the next few festivals.68 Hansen catalogues these pieces among tituli varii, but the hexame- ters are dedicatory. The officials organized the festival, but the verb (O~kav) with the goddess in the dative advertises their action as analo- gous to dedicating an object, which would be a&amp;vE-Ecav. The change from prose to verse reinforces the analogy. The names and 8p6jtog are at home in prose;69 but to record the act of offering the whole festival, with its ancient sacred elements, to the Panathenaic Athena, each inscription breaks into verse and names her with an abbreviated form of one of the early dedicatory epithets. All the associations that epithet carried would have served to match an otherwise plain record of these officials' action to the prestige of the Panathenaic occasion,70 and per- 66 I-apovog is used as an epithet in CEG 227 (below, 59), 228, 272; cf. 208 adn. U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Der Glaube der Hellenen (Berlin 1932) 164, suggests the hymn was composed for the Panathenaia. 67 CEG 302 (below, 68) calls the Panathenaia, Iahd68og qnavE[yoptg]. 68 For this use of 6&amp;6dv, see LfgrE s.v., B.l.c (II. 23.258) and 2.

Davison, From Archilochus to Pindar (London 1968) 41-43. 69 In CEG 301 (Eleusis, ca. 550), another festival 8p6dogo is part of the epigram. 70 As does in a way an early fifth-century lekythos (ABV 522, 34) showing hieropoioi before the Panathenaic Athena; see Shapiro (above, n. 41) 35-36, pl. 15a.</page><page sequence="18">54 Joseph W. Day haps also to link the new athletic features of the festival to the old ritu- als of sacrifice and the peplos. The men named in these inscriptions probably at least approved this wording. Private dedicators, no doubt often of the same class, also wanted to enhance their acts of piety by creating a lasting verbal association with the Panathenaia. But "associ- ation" is too vague and passive a term. In prayers, invocations, and hymns, either alone or embedded in other poems, to name a god by epithet is to offer a pleasing gift of praise. Shorter Homeric hymns, for example, are mere collections of epithets, which can be categorized by motif. They might, for instance, describe a god's lineage ("daughter of Zeus") or physical appearance ("flashing-eyed"). Both occur in Hymn 28 to Athena, but it expands the motif of lineage into a narrative of Athena's birth. This narrative, when performed, serves the same ritual function as sacrifice: it is a yepaq, a pleasing gift which enhances the god's t~*ri.71 An epithet is an abbrevi- ation of the narrative, in effect, a substitute y*paq. A dedication, too, is a y'paq given to a god. It might be a grand nar- rative, like the gigantomachies on the peplos or the Old Athena Temple pediment, or a more moderate acknowledgment of the god's power. An vdl'v71E formula inscribed on these objects represents the dedicator's original act of giving, but when passers-by read aloud an epithet, they enacted that representation, giving again the gift of praise, this time verbally, as when a hymn is sung. When visitors to the Akropolis uttered one of Athena's epithets aloud, the new act of praise, substitut- ing for the original, became a mimesis, however faintly echoing its model, of the Panathenaia. The mimetic effect would be felt most strongly where the epithet is in the vocative, as in CEG 197 (Athenian Akropolis, ca. 510): [nt]6tvt' 'AOEvaa, ooa TttooKptzeg AvOEKE[v] I Or where a prayer is addressed to the god.

PRAYERS AND XAPIX IN EPIGRAMS Most epigrammatic prayers exhibit at least one of three conventional poetic forms.72 First are "apologetic" motifs, i.e., requests for the god to be propitious and keep trouble away, as in CEG 225 (Athenian Akropolis, ca. 500-480):73 [-- -]vve K]4 naiXtS 'A[0]Ev[a]at o6]6' (y[aaXj] I [ivOE~a]y - he 6' a)c[oi]g [np6qp]pova Og6b[v h*Xot].

This "dexai-motif' is common in poetic passages we can call dedica- tory song, as in Pindar's Olympian 5, where the goddess is asked to receive the crowns (1-3):76 ... ozaTEUpvcOv c)Tzov yXAl)v tv OWV&amp;X1lauru7, '91KEXvo) 0'yc tEp, Kapp6u yEX(vs' cxKcxgClvzrt7o66O z' &amp;n9 jvqc; 8KEl) 'i-PciT 6; s6tE &amp;Op .... More significant for me, the "dedication" can be the song's perfor- mance with the accompanying celebration, as at the end of Paean 5 (44-48 M):77 72 See n. 71, and W. H.

AEat in an epigram may betray a concern to represent the dedicatory ritual as such a grand occasion and to suggest that it, as much as the object, was given as an offering. Let us pursue this idea in the third kind of epigraphic prayer, requests for recompense for the dedication. These too follow literary forms, as in CEG 414, also with an apologetic motif (Paros, ca. 500): . ,v (the dedicators) yevEFiv fPor'6v t' aX(o' v Trlgooyvqt.78 In what follows, I shall discuss a type of prayer for recompense that is, while the most common in epigrams, widely misunderstood, namely, requests that the god grant yXdptg or something exhibiting or causing y6apt;. Let us begin with the oldest example, Mantiklos' t6 S&amp;, d o'tP, i&amp;6ot XapiFETtav cA4otCpdv. This prayer or something very close to it appears in four other archaic epigrams (CEG 358-360, 426), but Odyssey 3 provides our only literary parallel. Amid the Pylians' festivity for Poseidon, "Men- tor" pours a libation and asks the god to grant recompense for the sacri- fice (58-59): 6ioi Xapi'Foav &amp; dotfiv ... &amp;ayaKlcet fi Elcat6gl n;. Might the same prayer in an epigram connote elaborate ritual? If so, whoever read CEG 326 aloud would, while re-charging Mantiklos' original act of dedication, confer on it an echo of the splendor of a cere- mony like the Pylians'. Many critics would balk at this, partly because, I shall suggest, they define XapiFEtrav too narrowly, rendering it sim- ply "agreeable" or "kind"79 and giving the main force to the noun. The prayer is rightly considered a variation on the more common epigraphic petition, Xydptv &amp;vrtSi0o-, which is however translated merely "render "Pindaro, Peana 6,175-183," SCO 38 (1988) 159-180, esp. 177-179, restore the last word as .[von]&amp;v = canti rituali; I owe this reference to Prof. Rutherford.

As CEG 275 seems to say, the dedication supports a chain of reciproc- ity based on gratitude ((6ptg) for the previous favor (also Xdptg; Athe- nian Akropolis, ca. 450): rt6tvt', &amp;tnapy}hv tiv8 Mivavvpo[ - u u - - I _J)oX v t~hVYaX aooi X0ptv 0&amp;vr[t~t&amp;6S] I AiytLXtbg hZuto AstvErpio hb[v u - - ] I o~t~E, Atbg O6yatrp, tv5 X'P [tv Oeitve]. This interpretation works in some ways; but the concept of gratitude resides more in o&amp;vrt- or Mantiklos' &amp;tot43v than in dptg.81 There is in fact a conventional poetic link between xaptg and festive ritual, a link the composers and readers of epigrams would have brought to their respective tasks. The Odyssean parallel for Mantiklos' prayer, though unique in liter- ature, illustrates the kind of context in which Xdiptg-words typically appear. For example, only certain things exhibit Xy(ptg in poetry- metal objects, cattle, textiles, what Homer calls KetTrtXtax or d~yd- para, the latter, of course, the word for a dedication in epigrams. These objects function primarily as top-rank gifts given by aristocrats, either to one another as marriage gifts, guest gifts, athletic prizes, and grave goods, or to the gods as sacrifices or dedications.82 In these con- texts, X(ptq contains the idea of reciprocity, but it is also closely tied to X(apo). It is the pleasure-causing quality of the gift, its charm, beauty, and glamour. More important here, as Kurke reminds us, poets did not divorce top-rank gifts from the top-rank occasions of their giving, and the glamour attendant on these occasions is Xdptg too.83 This Xpt; 80 Cf. CEG 231, 258, 279a, 321a; see also 234, 275, 371, 400. 81 See Versnel (above, n. 71) 47-49. I saw B.

Day lends itself to the gift, enhancing its worth and prestige, conferring on it an occasional, or ritual, pedigree which is recalled whenever the gift is examined or used. Epigrams helped preserve such a pedigree for dedi- cations, and we should interpret epigraphic ydXpt; accordingly.84 In the following survey, literary examples of xdpitg-words in contexts of gift- giving will naturally be limited to scenes of sacrifice or offering to gods and the accompanying festivity. Mantiklos' adjective, Xapi'tg, "having XptIg," typically modifies gifts to a god in Homer, as in the Trojan women's (pti~oatro niFnXo (II. 6.90, 271) or Chryses' offering (II. 1.39-41):85 LttvOi8, Ei' ,ot T ot Xapiev' OV i vrlbv 'pe~ya, 11 Ei 8r1'TCOZT Tot 'KaZX tCtova ?trlpt' F9crqa a 9p)Wv Xi6' aiyTov, t6'8 Lot tKP'1pVOV iXO)P.... Prima facie, the gifts "have Xc6ptg," but one notes the ritual associa- tions. Chryses roofed a sanctuary and links his gift with sacrifices. The Trojan women offer the ninXogq amid elaborate ritual, vowing a sacrifice. In an epigram too, the offering can be (apiFv (CEG 205, Athenian Akropolis, ca. 510-500): fchxrlt 'A9avaait A1oov v9VOEKEv tcnapy~v I hov aczT6 Ko[EAX]vov, Tit 5F' Oet piEv 186 OepidEg qn[ofiEEv ho K]4[p]vo ncatS T66' CyaCa. Also, as we saw in Odyssey 3, the god can be asked to reciprocate a sacrifice with a gapi~ooa v &amp;9got4ljv. Do epigraphic uses of xapiewt imply that the occasion of offering, as well as the offering itself, "had X(apt;" and deserves X6ptq in return? More on this later. The verb xap(ouxat can describe the pleasing generosity of the giver in contexts of cult (Od. 1.60-61): 84 Elsewhere I shall pursue parallels between epigrams and poetic gift-giving beyond Xdpt;. E.g., in Odyssey 18, not only does one suitor's bride-gift for Penelope contain (xpt~. .. nokkXj (298), but a suitor offers the gifts with the request i&amp;opa ... 8..ao s0 (286-287), another gift is niptnc1Kax ; oyaxla (300; cf. CEG 335, 363, 422, 423, per- haps 424), and the gifts are called nieptcXaa 6Vopa (303; cf. CEG 327). 85 Cf. II. 8.204. For Iliad 6, see above, 52. 86 Though Xapt~ev is in a clause devoted to the artist's signature, we can compare the self-praise of a festive song's performers; cf. below, 70.</page><page sequence="23">Interactive Offerings: Early Greek Dedicatory Epigrams and Ritual 59 ...'O8voo6 'Apye(ov nTcaph vqlual XaptSEo (object, Zeus) iepxh iP(ov ....

We must also consider xai'pe, the common epilogic prayer in Home- ric hymns. It does not mean "Farewell," but "Enjoy," and oizto with it is equivalent to oioiaE, as in Odysseus' prayer, "Enjoy these offerings," spoken as he dedicated spoils to Athena in Iliad 10 (462-463): yXaipe, O E, toiToSeot- c y&amp;p uptqrlv v 'OKiGtnq i"vtrov &amp;dav tov int6do)o E a. Hymnic xai'ps is thus a dedicatory formula, but what is dedicated is the hymn itself performed amid rich festivity. This might be explicit (h.Di. 9.7 = h.Mat.d. 14.6: KaXl ha utv o6ro) Xaf'p OeaF O ' 0 la nioat aotSfi), or implicit (h.Pan. 19.48 = h.Ap. 21.5: Kaai 0a tFtv oibtwo Xafpe, dvao, i'akat &amp;8 o' dotSj).

Day occasion, complete with these words of offering, would be enacted, or re-enacted in repeated future performances. In this way, whenever passers-by read out CEG 396, they would re-charge the dedicator's action, uttering again two prayers he might have spoken (Metapontum, ca. 525-500): NtlK6o'x6; it' r9tc.

While Xatpe in Nikomachos' mouth would mean "Enjoy (the offer- ing)," it would equally mean, "Enjoy (the ritual of dedication)."89 The noun Xgptq itself, of course, can describe qualities of a ritual that please. Thus, in the Homeric Hymn, Apollo shares a delighted viewer's reaction at "seeing the Xvptg" of participants in the festival (h.Ap. 3): 146: &amp;,hX ot AAXk, Doij, joi&amp;Xs, tou' titnvupits&amp; jt op.... 153-154: rdvroyv ydp KEv i'6otvo Xdptv, tpxxatro 68 06tOov av6paq z' eioopoov.... No wonder the Xdiptzrg, the Graces, came to symbolize the charm of song, dance, and celebration generally; but they are also associated with celebration as a top-rank gift-giving occasion and the festive ode itself as a top-rank gift.90 In Pindar's Nemean 5, for example, a command is given to join with the Graces in dedicating the victor's crowns to Aiakos (53-54):91 ... rtpoo6pototv 6' AiaKoi3 &amp;voieov totevra (pipe oG, e av)Ruta ouav avOaig Xiptootv.

Pytho is asked to receive "me with the Graces and Aphrodite," i.e., the poet as chorus leader and the song in its charming performance.92 Such ideas may stand behind CEG 312, an untraditional piece in some ways,93 but one that spells out the idea I am suggesting archaic epigrams typically implied (Herm, Attica, ca. 480-475): LlirpolpoJ i ntxi., :68' .Lyak~Jpa, i AE6dKLpaqeg, s~iT' &amp;avE'KagCi I hapCtLi, ,KakklKt;6C q (sic) oK X'aeOsg LXiptraqJ.

Day asked to come and enhance that charm. The epigram makes a compara- ble point about Leokrates, saying in effect that when he dedicated the fine gift, he also offered a ritual so fine it inspired the Graces' participa- tion. Just as future performers of Olympian 14 would re-enact Pindar's offering, passers-by would re-charge Leokrates' by doing homage to the Herm95 and by reading out the inscribed narrative of its original dedication. Finally, we must ask whether the proposed occasional force of other X(xptg-words in epigrams applies equally to the prayer X(ptv &amp;vrt- 8i68o and its variation 8i6ot XapiFetav &amp;totpoiv. I think it does. Mantiklos' prayer, for instance, seems at first glance to argue that Apollo owes a Xdpti-filled recompense only for the Xdpti-filled stat- uette; but archaic usage suggests he is also asked to repay a debt for an offertory ritual that exhibited ydptg. This allows us to develop Ver- snel's tantalizing suggestion that XapiFettav &amp;totpo3v means "a return service producing gaiety and joy."96 In poetry, requests for ydptq in which the god is asked to requite a gift of song and festivity are peti- tions to requite festive joy with festive joy. Hymn 10 invites Aphrodite to enjoy the song and make it desirable (4-5 atpe, Oed, ...

Mantiklos' prayer makes essentially this point. Whether or not he uttered the words 6i6ot XcapiiFEca v &amp;got3dv as he dedicated the stat- uette amid elaborate ritual, the epigram creates the impression he did, asking Apollo to make the occasion a fine one, characterized by 6dcpt;. Moreover, when people read out Mantiklos' prayer, they were not sim- ply praying vicariously for Xpit; for him. They asked the god to shed cxpti; on a new event, their re-enacting of his offering. More of this in my conclusion. Suffice it here to note that the idea of renewing fine dedicatory ritual in its original splendor is well attested, as in Pindar's Olympian 5 (1-8): 'YyrIJX&amp;v &amp;peT&amp;v K ao oGreq(dvowv (Ccov yXOv10v TOW Oo butuTx, Qicuvo &amp;oyaxep, Kxp8ug yeXxveiF dcXK1gXVtzOwco'6S ' &amp;nvx;&amp;Kva C) 'wco1tgi; e _8_pC. f1 % txv o Xv c6Xtv c {?v, Kacygptva, Xaoopdqpov, KaL zt&amp;v viotlKov eSpav. The song accompanies a dedication in the victor's city, but this re- enacts an original offering that took place amid the festivities at Olympia, where the victor dedicated his c60Sog, i.e., his crown.99 The words describing that offering, vtlcKcXXg dvx0prlce, catch the eye. They or close variations are nearly universal in epigrams on dedications of victorious athletes. V.

Day of formal language for both poet and epigram: the victor "proclaimed, kdp(Xp)E," his father and home town as he dedicated his crowns. This reflects the herald's proclamation of the victor.100 Strictly speaking, this ritual utterance accompanied the crowning of the winner before the crowd as it shouted out its gaxKaptogg6; and bestowed a cpAokopoxia, although, as in Olympian 5, poets often conflate these events with slightly later rituals like a victor's dedication of his crowns or the votive sacrifice, and later still, the feasting, drinking, singing and komos.101 Similarly, epigrams join the proclamation to the ritual of dedication. At its most basic, the proclamation included the victor's name, his father's name, his city, and his event. This pattern, often introduced by a iclpuo- or 7yye7-word, typically forms the core of epinician odes, around which the poets weave their mythic, gnomic, and hymnic strands. As a straightforward epinician version of a proclamation, Nash cites Nemean 5.1-5:102 OWK &amp;vP6ptuvxortot6; eig', 6XT' XItv&amp;aovTo pyi- reaOxi d~ydilawcx' g7' xijz6t [3xczgl o; EUOTx.'

Pindar argues that his song is better than sculpted &amp;dyXgha? at broadcasting this dyye9ia, in effect, better at re-charging the proclama- tion from the victory ritual.103 Perhaps the force of his point depended partly on his audience's awareness that athletic dedications really could represent this ritual. Evidence for victor statues, which Pindar had in mind, is scanty and problematic for archaic times.104 Still, one can cite the iconographic tradition of portraying the victor at the moment of crowning (and thus proclamation) or just prior to it. From the early 100 W. Mader, Die Psaumis-Oden Pindars (Innsbruck 1990 [Commentationes aenipon- tanae 29]) 69. 101 Cf. Kurke (above, n. 5) 137-149, 154. 102 L. L.

This tradition might extend well into the sixth century. At least a few archaic kouroi, some- times filletted but otherwise without gesture or attributes, seem to have been dedicated as victor statues. They may have been intended to por- tray the victor at the moment of proclamation and crowning.106 Whatever the case with statues, epigrams clearly focus on the essen- tial features of the proclamation: victor, father, city, and event. The father or city can be omitted, but the consistent occurrence of the whole list and its similarity to what we know of the proclamation confirm its origin in that ritual utterance. Furthermore, the participle &amp; yeXlag in a late archaic epigram suggests its author, at least, was conscious of imi- tating the proclamation (CEG 360, Penteskouphia, ca. 510-500): - uu ] &amp;yyeFta_- 107 Z tS 8 &amp;[; Xa]pi(aX v xgtotIF&amp;v.

However, while she says of Pindar that, "with the incorporation of these occasional details the &amp;yyea .(... simulates the festival setting," she does not apply this idea to inscriptions. Kurke does, following up a suggestion of mine.109 She envisages the effect of such an inscription on the base of a statue depicting the victor being crowned: ... the combination of epigram and victor statue elicited from its beholder a perfect recreation of the original announcement and coronation. As the viewer lent his voice to the epigram that recon- structed the victory announcement, he stood in the position of the Hellanodikas and crowned the victor with his gaze. Prose inscriptions can also reflect the proclamation, but rarely and minimally, e.g., KxXiaxg At&amp;io~lo : 'AOrjvaio I nay(p(Xtov.110 Even the tersest epigrammatic version has more, e.g., CEG 381 (statue base, Olympia, 472 [cf.

The most interesting evidence about the epigrams' con- cern with the proclamation comes from such adaptations of its canoni- cal elements. An unexpected variety parallels epinician poetry.

CEG 362 (above, 47), 393 (below, 68). 115 In continuing the heralds' task (for the poet as rpo&lt;pcxrag, see Bacch. 9.3, Pind. Pae. 6.6 [above, 61], fr. 150, cf. Parth. 1.5), Bacchylides fulfills his duty (11-18) to produce an "immortal (6yaXLga of the Muses, to be a common X(pgCa for men, declaring how often" the victor, being crowned, "put iciK6og" on his city and family.</page><page sequence="32">68 Joseph W. Day A similar purpose is served by adaptations of two other elements of the proclamation, the victor's father and city. Too much emphasis on the winner and his event might strike some as an undisguised boast. To blunt such criticism, epinician poets explained that the victor acted on behalf of his genos and polis, as their euergetes.116 The motif often takes its start from the proclamation, as in Olympian 5 (above, 000): the athlete "increased" his homeland as he "proclaimed" both it and his father in the victory rituals at Olympia. Epigrams also expand on these elements. CEG 302 emphasizes the father and his famous genos by juxtaposing his name with his patronymic son's (Ptoan sanctuary, ca. 540): [Doi]po t gvE igF ' t yak[ga A]a~[of]8~ Kak[6]v- I [ho 8' 'A]XicgLovo; hi;''AXigiEovi8E; I [h]iotoIt vic[oa; 9]O-'iK g' [60axit], I hc; Kvon.t[d6&amp;a]; 9Xavv' ho [ - x - - ] I h6o' v 'A0vatxi; fl 6o;  nav[yUptI;].

Almost all epigrams vaunt on the dedicator's behalf, even if only as formulaically as Mantiklos', placing his name first and noting his tithe of achievement or wealth. This accords with the competitive nature of votive display. As Burkert puts it, the fulfillment of a vow is "an opportunity to parade one's success before the eyes of gods and men"; and the remains of sanctuaries confirm this, revealing that dedi- cators placed their offerings to show them off amid a forest of neighbors.119 But limits existed. We have seen their effects in athletic epigrams, but further study ought to produce other cases of self- assertion adapted to acceptable ritual forms of language. Nikandre's kore may provide an early example (CEG 403, Delos, ca. 650): Nt1K6vpTr g C' vi0cKE v hE-riPo6'oti ioXEaiprlt, 969pr A~tvol6qciio r6 Nahaio, haoxo;g &amp;0iov, A~ivogvEog 8&amp; -accatyvtrly, I f hpdhoo 8' o Xoxog y(8v). The first verse is a normal dedication; but the next two are a vaunt, apparently Nikandre's boast about her status and menfolk, but no doubt their's about themselves. The over life-sized marble kore, richly dressed, is a consummate display of their wealth and status. Statue and inscription thus exhibit the same egotism, but they do so in the context of the genos, as in athletic epigrams. Do the utterances of some occa- sion stand behind this vaunting as the proclamation does that of athletic victors? Nikandre's marriage has been suggested on the basis of lcxoxo;g vv. 120 CEG 425 exemplifies a more common type of epigraphic egotism, viz., praise of the dedicated object (Delos, ca. 550-530): M[KKhi'[ort; .66' yx]XC.ogc t x'Xviv o[xriv t xi hutr;] I "Apxep(ooLkp]&amp;FeaT h1mipi [1i ioXaXprt] I [h]ot Xiot, MiEXyo; natrp6iwv z[ro hXtc6vrFe;]. 119 Burkert (above, n. 22) 68-69; cf. Morris (above, n. 9) 12-13. On placement, see B. S. Ridgway, "The Setting of Greek Sculpture," Hesperia 40 (1971) 336-356; cf. H. V.

Day Here the artists praise a statue they sculpted and offered,121 and other people's dedications can be praised similarly in artists' signatures.122 All this, however, is parallel to any praise of the dedication, from simple expressions like wKakbv &amp;yacLga (CEG 234, 291, 302, 303, 311, 334, 366, 367) and nrtptcowlXW;7 yakLga (CEG 335, 363, 422-424, cf. 327, 348), to &amp;ncapXil jv a?vro o KTFr~vo)v (CEG 205; cf. 242 adn., 251, 264). The latter would imply more than that the dedicator had a lot of money to spend. In poetry txKFcva are treasures of the sort from which top-rank gifts are taken for top-rank occasions.123 Such praise of the offering is self-advertisement for the artist and display for the dedi- cator; but it is also functionally parallel to a common motif in hymns and choral odes, where the performers boast of their skills, beauty, virtue, or lavish display, as the Deliades do in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, the Spartan maidens in Alcman 1, and Pindar's chorus when it portrays itself struggling as hard to praise as the athlete did to win. Greek hymn and encomium had long employed the rhetorical device of praising the laudandus by praising the laudator.124 Again, what appears to be bald self-assertion adopts a form of ritual utterance. Sometimes, something more forceful than ordinary social pressure muted dedicatory self-assertion. One thinks of the restrictions on victor statues at Olympia, or efforts by Lygdamis and Polykrates to curb aris- tocratic display in dedicating korai and kouroi.125 Grave monuments were limited too, though in their case we know elaborate funerals were being circumscribed at least as much as the monuments per se. Metri- cal epitaphs and funerary iconography offered a way around such restrictions, a kind of substitute funeral.126 Viewers and readers "in the know" would recognize that a deceased warrior, for example, was being represented as the &amp;vilp &amp;yao06; into whom the rites of a grand funeral 121 Apparently the Delian Nike; see Richter (above, n. 32) pl. XIVa. Cf. CEG ?230, ?252, 291, ?340, 387, all mentioning the artist-dedicator's "skill." 122 E.g., CEG 205 (above, 58); cf. 192 adn., 306 adn. Cf. the metrical signature at CEG 413: t flIapio nroilixa KptzovI8o E xogo[at evat]. 123 E.g., at 0. 7.4, Pindar calls a golden betrothal gift copxpx&amp;v tcredvmv.

Could dedications function similarly as ritual substitutes? In the case of athletic epigrams, at least, those "in the know" would recognize a moderate representation of an astonish- ingly boastful public occasion. The essential aspect of that representation shared by the athletic epi- gram and epinician poetry is the herald's proclamation. Neither epi- gram nor poet quotes a proclamation; they adapt its form to a new entity, either ode or inscription. Like the epinician, then, the epigram is a kind of occasional poetry, albeit a humble one. As the epigram was read or the ode performed,127 a great occasion in the victor's life would be re-enacted-the moment when the official set a crown on his head, when the crowd shouted goxapti, and threw leafy sprigs on him, and when the herald proclaimed his name, family, city, and event. The epinician poets' inventio carried them far beyond a simulation of this celebration, and even for doing that they could draw on infinitely more resources than composers of epigrams could. Still, the herald's procla- mation stands at the heart of both ode and epigram. VI. CONCLUSION In Section I, I traced several stages of a hypothetical interaction between a visitor to a sanctuary in seventh-century Thebes and Mantik- los' statuette. At each stage, curiosity would impel the person to answer a question raised by the monument by engaging it at one more level: by looking intently, to see what kind of object it is; by approach- ing and working out its iconography, to discover who is depicted; by reading the inscription, to find out who dedicated the image and per- haps why or how. We can now see that at each point new visual or semantic associations would lead our visitor toward an increasingly focused representation of Mantiklos' ritual of dedication. The viewer first senses that this cleverly wrought metal object, like 127 Or re-performed; see K. A. Morgan, "Pindar the Professional," CP 88 (1993) 1-15. Full awareness of the occasionality of early literature declined (see Nagy [above, n. 15 (1990)] 113-115), but Callimachus reconstructed Pindar's world in his epinician for Sosi- bios (fr. 384 Pfeiffer), a reference I owe to Prof. R. F. Thomas. We recognize, despite lacunae, typical epinician allusions to victory rituals (including the proclamation; cf. &amp;yyetrl, 8), which are associated with the victor's dedications (including statues of the Graces, 44-45) and inscriptions (one of which is quoted, 50).</page><page sequence="36">72 Joseph W. Day all such top-rank gifts, memorializes the top-rank occasion on which it was given. Next, the statuette reveals its identity as Apollo the archer, who came charging down from Olympus, angry, moving like night to answer Chryses' prayer with his silver bow; but here the epiphany is filled with Xipt;, as when the god comes to his festival on Delos to hear his exploits of archery praised in hymns. Then, the inscribed nar- rative of Mantiklos' act is spoken aloud by our visitor, who is thus drawn more deeply into the interaction, becoming part of the dedication by lending a voice to the deferred utterance on it. In ways typical of archaic ritual expression, Mantiklos' name and wealth or achievement are asserted. And as the verbal counterparts of the statuette's iconogra- phy, i.e., Apollo's epithets, are read out, this narrative becomes to a degree mimetic. Readers echo the language of a festival hymn or an utterance Mantiklos might have made when he set up his offering, even as they give a new, verbal gift of praise. Finally, with the prayer that Apollo grant a pleasing recompense for the pleasing gift and ceremony, we have true mimesis. Our visitor recharges the act of dedication, sub- stituting for the absent Mantiklos. It is not idiosyncratic of me to suggest that a viewer re-creates a ritual through multiple stages of interaction with a dedication. In ana- lyzing the greatest votive relief, the Parthenon frieze, Osborne suggests that its placement on the building would excite people's curiosity, draw- ing them through a series of discrete views toward the climactic scene on the east front, the preparation for offering the peplos:128 ... the sculpture of the frieze engages the viewer in an active capacity. ... [T]he viewer ... will find himself or herself making a halting progress along one of the flanks of the temple with the pro- cession which s/he will both constantly have to recreate as s/he moves and which his or her own progress will reproduce. This procession has become the procession of the viewer in a very strong sense. We have surveyed a selection of the earlier iconographic, poetic, and epigraphic evidence for this sort of interaction with archaic dedications. However, if we can assume a fair degree of verisimilitude in a Hellenis- 128 R. G. Osborne, "The Viewing and Obscuring of the Parthenon Frieze," JHS 107 (1987) 98-105 (99-100 for the quotation).

Two women visit a shrine of Asklepios to offer a cock and memori- alize their sacrifice by dedicating a pinax. The mime opens with one woman's prayer (1-4 C): - XaipotI, xva( la-Iitlov, ; g;t; TpiKl- wKo K'v yXhF'eiav Kn lRi&amp;8aopov tumlwCx;, oAv w i Kopovi"g 9 o' a~9t' r cti Kcrcn ov ~XipotIv ....

Her companion sets up the pinax and marvels at the sanctuary's &amp;dyiX- gaxra, moved by curiosity to ask what artist made one of them and who dedicated it (20-22): ...- , walkv, &lt;pihl Kovvoi, ocyoxXgo'ov t? tipx tiiv X?ov txtrCiCv trKictwV iRo(iO)Et Ki w iS l ot? tiv 6 oiacax;; Her friend answers by reading its inscription, which, unfortunately for me, seems to contain only the names (23-25): -of HpitXrlti natie-6 ouic 6pitq; w eva Ev rilt PdOot &amp; yp pCgacc'; EU06;rlS 8' accrTjV 9otrloav 6 HpiA~vog. Then, however, the curious woman does something interesting: she says a prayer for the artists and dedicator (25-26): wxUi 0oia6' 6 flixi*v wxi EUOfrili wxXiv pywv.</page><page sequence="38">74 Joseph W.

What Herodas' estimable lady does spontaneously, re-charging an old dedication by praying anew for the dedicator's recompense, readers of Mantiklos' epigram would do by saying it aloud. They would become performers re-enacting his ritual; but they would also make it their own ritual, the way viewers of the Parthenon frieze make its pro- cession their own. As Herodas' woman does when she prays for the dedicator, so when archaic visitors to Apollo's sanctuary uttered those words--ctb &amp;, Io3PE, 86o80t XapiFer~Xv &amp;goti3v--they were saying something relevant to their own situation. They would be caught up in the ambience of the place, perhaps making an offering as in Herodas, perhaps participating in a festival, but in any case absorbing the xdpt; palpable round about in the smoking altars, garlanded votaries, brightly painted buildings, and all the variegated and skillfully-wrought dedica- tions. They would not simply be praying vicariously for xipti for Mantiklos. In that ambience, they would also be asking the god to return festive joy for festive joy to them-to let them have a happy time, right then, in the sanctuary, just as the god himself was having, and did have when Mantiklos offered his statuette.129 WABASH COLLEGE 129 Of relevant work I have seen since this article went to press, I mention in particular D.
