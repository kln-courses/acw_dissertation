<plain_text><page sequence="1">HAWTHORNE AND THE PATHETIC FALLACY everyone knows what the pathetic fallacy is. Ruskin, in 1856, defined it with such precision that writers and critics have ever afterward been sensitive to its meaning and uses.1 But Ruskin, like many later commentators, was interested more in description and analysis than in seeking the historical basis for the fallacy; he assumed that the fallacy was a way by which the natural world became a subjective extension of man's mind; nature would act out the interior drama of man : thus fog could weep, the sky be weary, the waves laugh, or the sunlight dance simply because a writer, or any artist, said so. The pathetic fallacy was based on the assumption that man and nature at every moment existed together in some kind of instant, mutual coherence : what man thought or did, nature at once reflected. Ruskin lodged his protest against the illusion that external reality could be an extension of the subjective consciousness of man. Yet the pathetic fallacy is much older than the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century poetry or painting wherein Ruskin found his examples and demonstrations. There are "fallacies" in Shakespeare: Horatio tells us that "the Morn, in russet mantle clad, / Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill," and we see not only the early morning light breaking over an Elizabethan stage but the inner con dition of Horatio and the guards after their amazed terror in the presence of the Ghost. Donne, in the Anniversaries, made the whole earth shake and jar when the girl Elizabeth Drury died; in fact, those two poems are almost grotesques of the pathetic fallacy. The point is, however, that these were not "fallacies" at all. They were not a set of artificial relations, apprehended by the mind of man; they were utruth, inscribed by God in the nature of things."2 The cor respondences between man and nature were facts which the mind dis covered; man lived every moment of his life in a total reality which 1 According to Ruskin, the pathetic fallacy "... is of two principal kinds. Either ... it is the fallacy of wilful fancy, which involves no real expectation that it will be believed; or else it is a fallacy caused by an excited state of feelings, making us, for the time, more or less irrational" {Modern Painters, Vol. in, Chap, xn, sect. 5). An excellent treatment of the whole subject is Josephine Miles' "Pathetic Fallacy in the Nineteenth Century: A Study of Changing Relation Between Object and Emotion," University of California Publications in English, xn, No. 2 (1942), 183-304. 2 Marjorie Nicolson, The Breaking of the Circle (Northwestern University Press, I95?)&gt; P- !o8.

When he said that life was like water, he did not mean to draw a mere comparison or a causative principle; he meant that life was water and that water was life because man and the universe existed together in a single, related, meaningful context. What Ruskin described as the pathetic fallacy was the still-continuing hold of the correspondence on the minds of men long after the rationale, the very reason for being, of the relation of man to the uni verse had ceased to exist. The shift from the correspondence to the fallacy was long and slow. Under the impact of natural science and critical realism or eighteenth-century skepticism, the world steadily lost its ontological relationship to man, and man came to see that he and the universe were not units in a larger reality or mind of God. Yet habits die slowly; writers, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, continued to employ the rhetoric of correspondences which once had meaning but which had become mere empty formalisms. Nevertheless, some writers, or even one writer, may revive or restore, for a brief moment in literary history, the sensibility of a past age and give that sensi bility such an expression that critics might believe that a long-past age still survived into a much later time. Hawthorne was such a writer. He began his career as a conventional fallacist in the nine teenth-century manner and then, somewhere along the way, opened a new, or rather "old," communication with reality and looked at the world, not as mere convenient analogy and synecdoche, but as total harmony. In order to survey Hawthorne's employment of or departure from the pathetic fallacy, we might well begin with his first novel Fanshawe (1828) and then move through representative writings of his subsequent career. Generally speaking, Hawthorne in the beginning of his career showed that natural phenomena are an ever-various kaleidoscope, at all times in harmony with the human mood and emotion. We read that "There was a little alternation of cloud across the brow of heaven ..." (p. 86) ;3 we learn of the "naked and desolate hills" and of a "little stream, peeping forth many times to the daylight, and then shrinking back into the shade" (p. 87); "a golden ray rested upon the spire of the little chapel" (p. 92), and "the vanished sun had made . . . the purple and golden clouds . . . the chief inheritors of his bright 3 AU page references in parentheses refer to the respective volumes of The Complete Works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Riverside edition, ed. G. P. Lathrop. 12 vols. Boston, 1883.</page><page sequence="3">488 Davidson ness" (p. 103). These are a kind of instantly drawn fallacy; there are, however, a number of what might be considered "implied fallacies." These are hints that the human and natural realms are in sympathy and conformity, but the full resolution is never completed. One of these occurs when Ellen Langton, Walcott, and Fanshawe walk along that "little stream" wherein lives an especially large trout which has so far eluded capture; a stranger, in fishing for that very trout, induces Ellen to come near him. The whole scene is an anticipatory fallacy of how this dark stranger, Reuben Butler, will "catch" Ellen; the natural world exists as premonition for the eventual human struggle. Again, on the night Butler takes Ellen to the inn, there is a terrible storm, itself in complete harmony with the emotions of the pursued and the pursuers. Finally, the climactic scene of Butler's flight with Ellen and Fanshawe's chase is figured wholly in terms of how the natural order is precisely in keeping with the anguish and brutality of the human actors. These examples suggest how readily Hawthorne adopted the then prevailing pathetic fallacy. He tended to set his human dramas against a vast, inscrutable, yet sympathetic backdrop of nature; sometimes this scenic design is in a point-to-point relationship with man; yet he did not fall into the most obvious fallacies: trees do not sigh, rain does not laugh, nor does the sky mourn. His tendency, even so early as "The Hollow of the Three Hills" (1830), was to frame the natural order as having anticipated and as having long ago enacted the drama of man; the human mood and emotion become, as it were, a duplication of what nature has itself long known. The dark and moody opening of that short story fixes this strange similitude be tween the human and the natural orders of being: Dwarf pines were numerous upon the hills and partly fringed the outer verge of the intermediate hollow, within which there was nothing but the brown grass of October, and here and there a tree trunk that had fallen long ago, and lay mouldering with no green successor from its roots. One of these masses of decaying wood, formerly a majestic oak, rested close beside a pool of green and sluggish water at the bottom of the basin. . . . The chill beauty of an autumnal sunset was now gilding the three hill-tops, whence a paler tint stole down their sides into the hollow {Twice-Told Tales, pp. 228, 229). We are invited to understand, in this passage, that nature herself had long passed through and comprehended the human problem of evil and death. Man and nature do not exist in an immediate correspond ence whereby the natural order is in convenient sympathy with man; nature has a kind of anterior awareness, as if nothing happens to</page><page sequence="4">Hawthorne and the Pathetic Fallacy 489 man but what has occurred an infinite number of times in the phe nomenal world. The pathetic fallacy is turned upside down: man becomes the "fallacy" to nature.4 This antecedent character of nature is more fully disclosed in "The Maypole of Merry Mount" (1836); from the very beginning we are brought into a sense of time backward: the celebrators at Merry Mount are a wearisome reduplication of what was once vivid and fresh in a far-past age?the clumsily garbed fauns and nymphs, the "Salvage Man," the Indian, and "the flower-decked priest" all par ticipating in ancient rites. In that brilliant moment when Edith, queen of these revels, asks the question concerning "the mystery" in her heart, there is, "as if a spell had loosened them, ... a little shower of withering rose leaves from the Maypole" {Twice-Told Tales, pp. 74-75). If this is a fallacy, then it is indeed a curious one, for "earth's doom of care and sorrow, and troubled joy" is revealed, not to Edith and Edgar, but to us, the readers; we and nature are, as it were, in the illusion and sympathy; we and "world" are understand ing. Nature becomes, therefore, both inscrutability and moral com mentary; for the moment the protagonists are permitted to come into some emotional and spiritual conformity with nature; then, as sud denly, they may lose that comprehension and slip back into the illu sion of their separation from exterior reality. Nature is not the easy object and fallacy for man's interior drama; man exists, in any degree of understanding, by virtue of his known and expressed rela tionship to reality. He is, to repeat, the illusion, the fallacy; nature is the constant; it has long ago endured what he, for the moment, suffers. 4 Nearly the whole of "The Hollow of the Three Hills" is an extension of this sug gested similitude between nature and man: at every stage of the woman's confession there is established the concurrent and even antecedent tragedy of the natural world. True, this relationship is almost a one-to-one condition which bespeaks the pathetic fallacy; yet Hawthorne linked nature and the woman to a kind of third dimension which he termed "the Power of Evil"; that is, the woman and nature are but parts of an en larging natural phenomenon which is "beyond nature." Thus the voices of the woman's broken-hearted parents "melt into the sound of the wind sweeping mournfully among the autumn leaves"; the wronged husband's damnations "rose up . . . till they changed into the hollow, fitfu], and uneven sound of the wind, as it fought among the pine-trees"; finally, when the woman's child had died through her negligence, the "sweeping sound of the funeral train faded away like a thin vapor, and the wind . . . moaned sadly round the verge of the Hollow between the Three Hills" (pp. 231, 232, 233). For a perceptive analysis of the pathetic fallacy in another early and significant tale, "Roger Marvin's Burial," see Seymour L. Gross, "The Technique of Hawthorne's Short Stories" (unpublished Ph.D. Thesis, University of Illinois, i954)j PP- 121 ff.</page><page sequence="5">40O Davidson Hawthorne was not aware of a "movement" or a change of mind affecting him: that he should have at one time used the pathetic fallacy and at another time not used it is matter for only provisional speculation. He was, it is true, part of a literary sensibility which found the fallacy much to its taste and liking; nevertheless, he may be part of a tendency and then outside it. The best one can say is that Hawthorne's varying employment, early or late in his career, was somehow related to his response to reality : it was a means, one way or another, of making reality "real." What "reality" was and how it would be made "real" demand a set of distinctions which would be different every time they are made. Despite the obvious dangers of oversimplification, one might be able to make certain generalizations concerning the ways and reasons for Hawthorne's employment of or escape from the pathetic fallacy. First, the pathetic fallacy occurs when man, or the writer, regards the natural world as completely subservient to his will and determina tion. Though nature is sometimes reluctant, it can be made to enact man's drama. In "The Hollow of the Three Hills" nature has her anguish too, just as does the sorrowing woman. This relationship is simply assumed to be "there" all the time; the writer, acting like a god, uncovers it and presents it for the instant acceptance and under standing of the reader. The fallacy dissolves, however, and becomes what I might term, for convenience, the "symbolic spectrum," when the forms of the natural world somehow pass into "psychology"; that is, a condition wherein nature animates man and when the two are linked in some total design beyond his world of ostensible reality.5 5 Two notebook entries, chosen at random, might clarify this habit of Hawthorne's mind. The first is from the journal of 1842: "One of my chief amusements is to see the boys sail their miniature vessels on the Frog Pond. . . . There is a full-rigged man of war. ... All its motions?its tossing up and down on the mimic waves, and its sinking and rising in a calm swell, its heeling to the breeze,?the whole effect, in short, is that of a real ship at sea; while, moreover, there is something that kindles the imagination more than the reality would. If we see a real, great ship, the mind grasps and possesses, within its real clutch, all that there is of it; while here, the mimic ship is the representative of an ideal one, and so gives us a more imaginative pleasure" {The American Notebooks, ed. Randall Stewart. New Ha ven, 1932, p. 96). The second is Hawthorne's memorable description of Sleepy Hollow in 1844 and concludes: "And how strange is the gradual process with which we detect objects that are right before our eyes; here now are whortleberries, ripe and black, growing actually within reach of my hand, yet unseen till this moment. Were we to sit here all day, a week, a month, and doubtless a lifetime, objects "would thus still be presenting themselves as new, though there would seem to be no reason why we should not have detected them all at the first moment" (p. 103; italics mine).</page><page sequence="6">Hawthorne and the Pathetic Fallacy 491 This penetrative and transforming power was one of the hallmarks of Hawthorne's method and achievement. Perhaps "The Custom House" chapter, prefatory to The Scarlet Letter, is one of the clearest expositions of that symbolizing process whereby the artistic mind does not simply use but succeeds in animating brute forms; it is a journey of the mind through the intervening veil of reality, or through what Coleridge termed "visionary deadness," and into some comprehension of the total phenomenal world. Hawthorne states that his own family connections with Salem make for a "more sensuous sympathy with dust. ... It is not love, but in stinct." He goes on to speak of his imaginative torpor which rendered him incapable of creative action: "My imagination was a tarnished mirror." He feels the urgent necessity to open some fresh, renewed negotiation with the world, not only because of his long sabbatical from writing but because he cannot make Salem, the past, the imagined letter, or the theme of the suffering young woman in any way come alive. In a fallacy, the mind is an "I" and external reality an "It" which is instantly subservient to the mind's will; in the steadily emerg ing spectrum, as Hawthorne describes it, there must be an imagina tive "neutral territory, somewhere between the real world and fairy land, where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet, and each imbue itself with the nature of the other" (p. 55). In some moment of the mind's searching, this event and meeting take place, a merging of inanimate fact and the provocative idea, self and reality, light and darkness: "we behold," Hawthorne continues in analyzing the process, "the gleam and shadow of the picture, with one remove further from the actual, and nearer to the imaginative. Then, at such an hour, and with this scene before him, if a man . . . cannot dream strange things, and make them look like truth, he need never try to write romances" (p. 56). At the end of his private journey of understanding, the world no longer remained a mere subjective "It," a willing concur rence to the inner determination of an arrogant "I," but had itself become living and sentient; its own sentience and response were part of the animation of the whole creative imagination. Hawthorne was able to animate the "visionary deadness" of the world because he saw that the vivification of his own mind was somehow related to his perception that the phenomenal world was not a mere brute thing but was capable of a concurrent animation too. The artistic mind and the exterior world existed in a total awareness beyond themselves and beyond even their own knowing. Thus, in their several ways, the characters of the novel all re-enact, either toward darkness and moral</page><page sequence="7">492 Davidson blindness or toward full comprehension, what Hawthorne himself negotiated before he could diffuse "thought and imagination through the opaque substance of to-day" and thereby "live throughout the whole range of his faculties and sensibilities" (pp. 57, 60). The pathetic fallacy occurs, on the contrary, when the world is wholly disjunct from man but is somehow capable of being instantly subservient to his all-powerful will. Yet (to repeat our first condition for the symbolic spectrum) when "world" itself dissolves under the known conditions of its infinitely variable relationships to man and when the creative mind can see that it and "world" enact some in determinate drama beyond even themselves, then reality ceases to remain passively convenient to the explication of man and becomes itself part of the variable quest for meaning. The symbolic spectrum is a means of viewing the world as animate and as having "mind."6 A second difference between the fallacy and some further range of speculation is implicit in the time-sense or time-world. The pathetic fallacy offers itself when the time-sense is only the present; that is, the relationship between man and nature can be simply drawn when nature is presumed to have had no pre-existence until man appeared. Then, and only then, it can do for him anything he wants. Nature's animate condition is "there" only now and thus can be made conform able to the dominating human mood. The world of reality passes out of the range of fallacy, however, when nature itself has an elaborate pastness and when man becomes himself almost a fallacy, a mere arbitrarily fixed moment in time. In a passage from The Scarlet Letter, this time-dimension of "world" is both set off against and yet made part of the human time-dimension. The event occurs when Hester and Pearl are in the forest awaiting the return of the Reverend Mr. Dim mesdale : It was a little dell . . . with a leaf-strewn bank rising gently on either side, and a brook flowing through the midst, over a bed of fallen and drowned leaves. The trees impending over it had flung down great branches, from time to time, which choked up the current and compelled it to form eddies and black depths at some points; while, in its swifter and livelier passages, there appeared a channelway of pebbles, and brown sparkling sand. ... All these giant trees and bowlders of granite seemed intent on making a mystery of the course of this small brook; fearing, perhaps, that, with its never-ceasing loquacity, it should whisper tales out of the heart of the old forest whence it flowed, or mirror its revelations on the smooth surface of a pool. Continually 6 The above discussion owes much to Charles Feidelson, Jr., Symbolism and Ameri can Literature (University of Chicago Press, 1953), Chap. 1.</page><page sequence="8">Hawthorne and the Pathetic Fallacy 493 . . . the streamlet kept up a babble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy, like tjie voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without play fulness, and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintance and events of sombre hue (pp. 223, 224). This is what Hawthorne, in another connection, termed the "moral scenery" or the "moral landscape." Here, the forest, the stream, and the sunshine project the past and the present conditions of Hester and Pearl: the human and natural orders exist in conjunction and parallel to each other. Yet, while the human characters are in time, the natural world is both with and beyond them?beyond them in time and be yond their full comprehension; they exist in it, but it has long ante dated them and thus can transcend the limits of their experience and knowledge.7 Thus the reader, not the characters themselves, is re quired to see the ever-continuing drama of these two orders, the nat ural and the human; he is invited to add to the "moral scenery" a great deal which is not, at first view, there. The landscape is a symbolic abbreviation which is capable of an infinite extension beyond the mere spatiotemporal limitations of characters in a scene; they are in it, but it is never permissively subservient to them. A third explanation for Hawthorne's shift from the pathetic fallacy to a wider range of speculation lies in the Puritan world-view ; yet the "shift" could go the other way; that is, it could and did turn Hawthorne toward the immediate allegorizing of man and nature. A Puritan reading of "Earth" might easily establish the instant synec doche: every act of nature becomes a moral lesson for man. Each event would be a direct exemplification of the universe of spirit; "every natural fact," to paraphrase Emerson, becomes symbol of "spiritual fact." Yet the Puritan, at his most perceptive, went beyond the instantly 7 Over and over Hawthorne's characters "feel" their tenuous relationships with the exterior world; sometimes the feeling is a profound one, as in the above-quoted scene of "The Forest Walk" in The Scarlet Letter; at other times it assumes the tone of irony or anticipation, as when, in The Marble Faun, Hilda says to Kenyon in the Colosseum, " 'How delightful this is!' " and Kenyon, though wiser than she, agrees (p. 185). The moment is significant, for it shortly precedes Donatello's murder of Miriam's model. The full knowledge of these "felt" situations is, however, denied the characters themselves, for they exist in the restricted locus of a place and time. But, almost as if he were presented with a Jamesian "test of intelligence," the reader is both permitted to know more than what the characters themselves can know and required to compre hend those intangible relationships of the past to the present and back to the past again. The characters are, in short, denied a time-sense which the reader, like Haw thorne himself, is presumed to have.</page><page sequence="9">494 Davidson comprehended fallacy. He was forever reminded that fact and idea do not exist in any easy association; the way of understanding is always difficult, for?it must be stressed?nature is not the direct handiwork and demonstration of God; no Puritan would entertain the heresy of pantheism or anthropomorphism. Nature was, on the contrary, only a means or instrument whereby God, at His mere pleasure, might affect man; true reality was behind the veil, was "there" in the realm of spirit; "world" was only an outward and visible sign which testified to the invisible reality beyond. Man was denied the capacity for full understanding; he lived in the world of external reality which continually required that he know it but which, nonetheless, withheld from him any final clue to understanding. "Experience" was not the apprehension of man's relation to natural forms but was the search for function and essence; by means of natural phenomena God, from His side, could affect man, and man, despite his primal corruption and the seeming chaos of the natural order, sought to understand God.8 Hawthorne and the seventeenth-century New England Puritan would well agree in a view that the activity of the world is not for man's mere benefit and pleasure, as certain nineteenth-century fal licists might premise. The condition of man in the physical world is one of perpetual interaction: man works in, acts on, and, simultane ously, receives effects from nature; the natural world is, however, not a part of him nor is he a part of it; both are demonstrations of that continual process which is forever in conformity to an anterior intel ligence which the Puritan would call God but which Hawthorne pre ferred to leave as an undefined idea.9 Yet the Puritan of the seventeenth century was denied the full 8 The literature on this "psychology" of religious experience is, of course, enormous. It extends all the way from Bradford's Of Plimoth Plantation through Cotton Mather's Magnolia to Jonathan Edwards' Treatise Concerning Religious Affections and the Free dom of the Will. The chief modern interpreter is Perry Miller, The New England Mind: The Seventeenth Century (New York, 1939), Chap, vin, "Nature"; and Jonathan Ed wards (New York, 1949), pp. 236 ff. and 254 ff. 0 However Puritanly Hawthorne regarded the world, he was not concerned, as a Puritan would have been, with the ways God affects the world; or, to put the matter another way, he was not interested in the "God-end" of the mind's journey but only in those clues to further reality which the world itself allows. The Puritan, one should admit, tended to posit a static world of immutable and instantly apprehensible forms; while Hawthorne employed the rather Puritan commonplaces of such forms, as the leaf, bird, sunshine, or flower, all testified, however, not to a fixed but to an endlessly variable reality, itself like the human mind engaged in the continual organic process and change.</page><page sequence="10">Hawthorne and the Pathetic Fallacy 495 employment of a complex vision of reality because he was interested not in the "way" of understanding but primarily in the end or result of comprehension. He knew on the instant that the leaf, the falling rain, or the flashing meteor was a link between the infinite and the finite worlds: what concerned him was "meaning." The world was therefore a set of self-evident axioms to further reality; but he tended to be impatient with or abandon the outward manifestations if he could at once perceive the revelation, the meaning, behind the deceptive vesture of reality. He was, in short, both realist and allegorist be cause he regarded as presumptuous and suspect any view that the mind can ever understand itself or the world. Allegory, or a form of the pathetic fallacy, helped him make sense of a world which, he well knew, was sin and delusion anyway.10 Hawthorne was both Puritan and not Puritan. He could easily slip into allegory and readily equate "meaning" with its physical repre sentation. A passage in the notebook for 1842 suggests how flatly he could make the identifying fallacy of man and world : The streak of sunshine journeying through the prisoner's cell; it may be considered as something sent from heaven to keep the soul alive and glad within him. And there is something equivalent to this sunbeam in the darkest circumstances; as flowers, which figuratively grew in Paradise, in the dusky room of a poor maiden in a great city; the child, with its sunny smile, is a cherub. God does not let us live anywhere or anyhow on earth, without placing something of Heaven close at hand, by rightly using and considering which, the earthly darkness or trouble will vanish, and all will be Heaven {American Notebook, pp. 97-98). Such an easy connection between object and idea was the kind of imaginative lapse from which Hawthorne occasionally suffered; the allegorizing fallacy was the brake he tended to put on the riot of his imagination. He was, like a Puritan, impatient if the special insight and revelation were not already there, ready at hand for expression in word. When he had to pause and grope, as did Melville, he tended to thrust the irresolution behind the masquerade of an immediate allegorical identification.11 10 Only when Puritanism produced a mind driven by some inner speculative need, as in Jonathan Edwards, do we come upon the Puritan world in its infinite complexity. Edwards attempted to restore the Puritan world-view of God's "affecting" man in natural forms a,nd of man's capacity to come toward God through sensuous and aesthetic experience. But by Edwards' time the rational view of man's efficient knowledge through the twin avenues of sense and mind had gone too far ever to be questioned again until Hume and Kant. 11 The following passage from The Marble Faun illustrates Hawthorne's veering</page><page sequence="11">496 Davidson Hawthorne's view of the world and reality was, therefore, double. Man and nature, on the one hand, might inhabit only a single measur able context: they formed one allegorical dimension; they belonged together in a unit of understanding; one could not be separated from the other; in fact, man might be the monotonous reduplication of what had many times occurred in the realm of "world." On the other hand, Hawthorne's concept of the "moral scenery" connoted the sub tle, unresolved variability which is man's relationship to reality. Man is lodged in an endlessly shifting prism of consciousness: everything that occurs in his life has reflections and implications beyond the known limits of the merely "actual." If leaves fall from trees or the sunlight goes behind clouds, these events take place (as they do so frequently in The Scarlet Letter) in some incomplete, yet infinite, complex relationship of things to ideas which man struggles to com prehend. The Puritan of the seventeenth century in New England called these events the signs of God's hand evident in the world; a writer of a later time may have lost the sense of an immediate God, and yet he had so to present the "scenery" that, in the very shift and variability of the design, there was some tentative comprehension toward which the understanding might move. This double vision of reality may account for much of Hawthorne's symbolic treatment of "world" and, at other times, his flat identifica tion of man and world in a consistent allegory .??Yet, as much as any writer of the nineteenth century, he explored the infinitely variable relationship of appearance and reality. By bringing his characters and landscapes into suggestive co-ordination with some other, more total experience beyond what seems to be "reality," he anticipated, as much away from the multiple suggestiveness of thing and idea and contenting himself with "fallacy"; he is trying to externalize the inner torment of Donatello after the crime, and he does it by describing "a certain little dell" very similar, in outline, to that in The Scarlet Letter: "A fountain had its birth here, and fell into a marble basin, which was all covered with moss and shaggy with water-weeds. Over the gush of the small stream, with an urn in her arms, stood a marble nymph, whose nakedness the moss had kindly clothed as with a garment; and the long trails and tresses of the maidenhair had done what they could in the poor thing's behalf, by hanging themselves about her waist. In former days . . . this lady of the fountain had first received the infant tide into her urn and poured it thence into the marble basin. But now the sculptured urn had a great crack from top to bottom; and the discontented nymph was compelled to see the basin fill itself through a channel which she could not control, although the water was long ago consecrated to her" (p. 281). As contrasted with the dell in The Scarlet Letter, this passage allows only an im mediate, finished, point-to-point identification with the broken condition of Donatello's mind.</page><page sequence="12">Hawthorne and the Pathetic Fallacy 497 as did Melville, what later writers would make the "moral scene"? an unresolved expression of space and time. Hawthorne's truest vision was Puritan, for he conceived that the drama of man was merely an incomplete particle of the drama of the universe; man and reality participate in the total, unresolved quest for understanding; both are segments of the complete "mind" or the symbolic design which forever eludes practical demonstration. At his best, therefore, Hawthorne showed man as living in a meaningful reality; every thing was alive and informative; nothing suffered from the resisting "visionary deadness" which the fallacist seeks to bring alive. Yet at other times, Hawthorne was content to bend reality into an instant and easy conformity with man; it was in this comfortable logic and pathetic fallacy that he lost his way in those last romances, Grimshawe and Septimius Felton. Between those two measurements of his mind, the pathetic fallacy and the symbolic spectrum, most of Hawthorne's writing can be placed. Edward H. Davidson</page></plain_text>
