<plain_text><page sequence="1">Poetry of Labor and Labor of Poetry: The Universal Language of Alexei Gastev's Biomechanics JULIA VAINGURT Nothing is more nonsensical than an imitation of reality; nothing more superfluous: there is enough reality already. Max Frisch Sitting on the gas tank of an airplane, my stomach warmed by the pilot's head, I sensed the ridiculous inanity of the old syntax inherited from Homer. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti "C V^/emented with blood, sturdily the USSR stands," boldly declared the founding fathers of Lef in the first issue of their journal.1 Human blood as the building material of the new state, albeit a visceral image, should not be understood purely figuratively, as it is a literal reference to the bloody wars?from World War I to the Civil War?surrounding the state's creation. What strikes one, however, is the assertion that the USSR is built solidly because of this material, and this material alone. Human blood here acts as a fit surrogate for cement, an advantage in a country that had much larger supplies of the former than the latter.2 Blood is just one component of the body whose productive potential was gaining attention at the time. Alexei Gastev, the Proletcult poet and importer of biomechanics into Russia, asks, "Why are there mountains of books written on thermal energy, furnaces, boilers, steam machines, electricity, anthracite, white coal, and electrification, but none on the energy of the worker?"3 At a time when the country most sorely needed materials and technology for its reconstruction, human bodies became its cheapest available material and its basic technology. "'Kogo predosteregaet Lef?" Lef, 1923, no. 1:10. interestingly, Gastev's fellow-member of the Proletarian Culture Movement, Aleksandr Bogdanov, founded the first institute for blood transfusions with the aim of brotherhood and rejuvenation, and, ironically, died tragically during one of his experiments in blood transfusion, because of blood group incompatibility?a factor that could be seen as symbolical of the complexities of brotherhood. 3Aleksei Gastev, "Narodnaia vypravka" (1922), in his Poeziia rabochego udara (Moscow, 1971), 258.

This idea, which was rapidly gaining momentum in the twenties in Russia, led to the emergence of a new artistic language and artistic technique. Gastev's biomechanics is one such development, in which two cultural traditions, the rapidly spreading machine aesthetics and the fin-de-siecle keen interest in cultivating the perfect physique, found its synthesis.4 Paradoxically, it is the Russian cultural preoccupation with bodily chastisement that led Gastev to turn to "Americanism."5 Gastev's name is primarily brought up in the context of Soviet Taylorism, and the rare scholars who turn to his poetry usually treat it as an example of the Proletarian Culture group, to which he belonged. They concentrate on such common features as paeans to the machines and the rhetoric of "metallization," and overlook Gastev's original experimentation with form.6 Meanwhile, Velimir Khlebnikov admired Gastev's poetry and called him a "fragment of labor conflagration in its purest form."7 This paper is an attempt to unite Gastev's experiments in poetic language and labor and to provide a cohesive reading of his poetry in the context of his work on biomechanics and labor organization. Gastev looks for ways in which poetry can assist in the conversion of the excessiveness of the human body into the restraint and control of the machine. In an effort to create poetry as a product of a man-machine and to reconsider the role of poetry in the machine age, Gastev disposes of mimesis?as nature was something to leave behind?in favor of the rhythm of mechanical reproduction. Finally, this article claims that Gastev understood biomechanical transformation in national terms, and demonstrates how the poet's taming of the Russian word was part of his project of purging the Russian in him?streamlining one would lead to the same in the other. In the process of exercising biomechanics and tempering his body with the help of poetry, Gastev wished to expel everything he associated with Russianness (disorder, weakness, wastefulness), transcending the concept of nationality and replacing it with the universal identity of the machine. WESTERN AND RUSSIAN TECHNIQUES OF CONTROLLING THE BODY Gastev was wrong in assuming a dearth of written material about human energy and its productive potential: in fact, an immense amount of attention had been paid throughout the 4For a discussion of the latter and its influence on the avant-garde see John Bowlt, "Body Beautiful: The Artistic Search for the Perfect Physique" in Laboratory of Dreams: The Russian Avant-Garde and Cultural Experiment, ed. John E. Bowlt and Olga Matich (Stanford, 1996). 5America as a model for new Soviet Russia was becoming a fixture in public discourse of the 1920s. Industrialization was synonymous with Americanization, that is, with the importation of American technology (both machines and techniques) for the building of Russian socialism. Additionally, the philosophies of labor of such American industrialists as Frederic Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford, along with the rhetoric of American efficiency, self-sufficiency, and success through hard work, were gaining currency among the top echelons of the new Soviet government. 6See, for example, Rolf Hellebust, "Aleksei Gastev and the Metallization of the Revolutionary Body," Slavic Review 56:3 (1997): 500-18; or Carden, Patricia,"Utopia and Anti-Utopia: Aleksei Gastev and Evgeny Zamyatin," Russian Review 46 (January 1987): 1-18. 7Velimir Khlebnikov, "O sovremennoi poezii," in his Izbrannye sochineniia (St. Petersburg, 1998), 292.</page><page sequence="3">Poetry of Labor and Labor of Poetry 211 nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth specifically to this subject.8 Gastev's own adaptation of the theory of scientific management of labor, developed by the American industrialist Frederick Winslow Taylor, sprouted from these efforts. No scholar of the human machine received as much attention in Soviet Russia as Taylor, whose study of labor became immensely popular in Europe by World War I and whose work on this topic traveled to Russia via Europe. Taylor's principles of the "scientific management of labor" choose the body as the focal point of the industrial process and suggest ways of improving productivity by teaching workers to use their bodies in the most efficient manner. Just like his influential predecessor Etienne-Jules Marey, Taylor was interested in time-motion studies.9 Taylor, however, was not led to this juncture by scientific curiosity; his interests were strictly utilitarian. He also added a personal and moral dimension to what previously had been looked upon as a purely scientific endeavor, as his private life was subjected to fixed schedules and a rigid self-discipline. For Taylor, Richard Stites noted when explaining the aesthetics and ethics of his science, "the factory was not only an arena of production and an idyll of elegant precision but also a moral gymnasium for the exercise of good character."10 Productivism may be morally uplifting, but it is "politically promiscuous," since it presents an area in which capitalism and communism may meet.11 In Soviet Russia, Taylorism was greeted with much controversy, but its obvious success at conserving energy could not be overlooked.12 The proponents of Taylorism deemed its capitalist origins and its potential for exploitation to be minor drawbacks, which would be easily rendered harmless within the socialist industrial framework.13 An ardent promoter of Taylorism, Gastev earned the name "Soviet Taylor" when in 1920 he organized the Central Institute of Labor in Moscow. The institute attempted to inculcate Taylor's precepts in the Russian workplace, and both Lenin and Trotsky supported it. The movement propagated by the institute became known as the Scientific Organization of Labor (Nauchnaia organizatsiia truda, or NOT), when the institute's organizers, possibly in order to expunge the exploitative connotation of Taylor's 8In The Human Motor: Energy, Fatigue, and the Origins of Modernity (New York, 1990), Anson Rabinbach traces the fascinating history of the idea that the body is a thermodynamic machine from Hermann von Helmholtz and Karl Marx to Etienne-Jules Marey, Paul Bert, Jules Amar, and finally Taylor. 9Marey invented the chronophotograph, which he used for his studies of bodies in motion. 10Richard Stites, Revolutionary Dreams: Utopian Vision and Experimental Life in the Russian Revolution (Oxford, 1989), 146. In We, Zamiatin makes fun of this moral imperative in the ironic statement of clueless D: "It didn't enter the heads of all their Kants to build of a system of scientific ethics, that is, ethics based on adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing" (Evgenii Zamiatin, We, trans. Clarence Brown [New York, 1993], 34). "Rabinbach, Human Motor, 272. In "Marx and Ford," Gastev defends his reliance on capitalist methods of production by trying to prove that, despite their cardinal disagreements regarding political and economic systems, these two opposing historical figures held harmonious views on the organization and management of production (Poeziia rabochego udara, 315). 12Frederic J. Fleron, Jr., suggests that "as an artifact of human experience, technology must be viewed as an element of culture." According to this view, since Soviet Russia was building its economy on the transfer of Western technology, it could not have avoided the borrowing of the capitalist techniques and work ideology along with it (Fleron, Jr., ed., Technology and Communist Culture: The Socio-Cultural Impact of Technology under Socialism [New York, 1977], 3). 13Stites writes that "Taylorism and its efficiency craze spread across the country, becoming in the words of a contemporary 'a normal American madness'" {Revolutionary Dreams, 146?47).</page><page sequence="4">212 Julia Vaingurt doctrine, replaced "management" with "organization."14 This concealment obviates the contradictions inherent in the adoption of the Western biomechanical ideology by the socialist state and the difficulties and criticisms that Gastev would suffer in connection with his labor of love. However, the search for the conservation of human energy did not come to Russia entirely from outside. On Russian soil, the Western methods of scientific management and rationalization of the body were merged with the homegrown tradition?rooted in religion? of bodily chastisement. Taylor's contentions about the moral benefits of his biomechanical training resonated with the concerns of those Russian nineteenth-century visionaries who looked into ways of disciplining the body. This idea that the body's iniquitous weakness must somehow be dealt with found its dramatic expression in the eccentric rendition of Leo Tolstoy, who showed almost obsessive interest in controlling the body and channeling its energy. In Anna Karenina, for example, the estate owner Levin manages to sublimate his sexual energy, together with his spiritual confusion, into productive, physical labor, while in the eponymous story, Father Sergius cuts off his finger (a gesture of symbolic castration) in order to suppress his desire for the beautiful divorcee Makovkina. While Tolstoy believed that the reformation of the human being must be achieved even at the expense of the extinction of the human race (in The Kreutzer Sonata), the philosopher Nikolai Fedorov, on the contrary, demonstrated how a restructuring of the body could lead to the annihilation of death. In The Philosophy of the Common Cause, Fedorov stipulates that in the process of human evolution and with the help of scientific technological restructuring, human beings will be able to get rid of their digestive and sexual organs.15 They will achieve perfection and immortality by using cosmic energy for nutrition.16 Fedorov's project was an inspiration for Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the father of rocket science, for Georgii Krutikov, the architect whose ambitious project of the Flying City was an attempt to provide a form for Fedorov's dream of cosmic men, as well as for many avant-gardists captivated by the transformative potential of flight. Although Gastev's preoccupations had to do with more immediate reality, Fedorov's philosophy of scientific transfomation of human beings was foundational for Gastev's work. For Gastev, Taylor's method of body management was a step toward the realization of Fedorov's future. Gastev's work, however, was necessitated not by the vast incongruity between man and cosmos, but ,4Ibid., 147. 15In "The Transfiguration of Cannibals: Fedorov and the Avant-Garde," Irene Masing-Delic discusses Vladimir Solov'ev's protest against resurrecting men as "cannibals," and Fedorov's response that the problem of cannibalism, a stumbling block on man's evolution into an immortal being, naturally would be solved in the resurrecting process (Laboratory of Dreams, 17-19). Fedorov's notion of "cannibalism" was broad, encapsulating the killing and (sexual) exploitation of other human beings, as well as the consumption of animals and plants, all of which was caused, in Fedorov's philosophy, by uncontrolled bodily impulses that must be purged from the rational and enlightened human machine. 16In Fedorov's explication of the potential capacities of a human body, "the organs of this organism will be the very instruments by means of which the human being will act under the circumstances on which the vegetal and the animal life will depend. By means of these organs will be created the aero- and ethero-nautic methods making him/her able to move and extract from space the universal materials for the construction of his/her organism" (quoted in Vladislav Todorov, Red Square, Black Square: Organon for Revolutionary Imagination [Albany, 1995], 61).</page><page sequence="5">Poetry of Labor and Labor of Poetry 213 between man and his immediate environment, a problem that was becoming painfully obvious in postrevolutionary Russia.17 BODY TROUBLE Although technology extended the capacity of the human body, it also accentuated its deficiencies. While cars and airplanes, radio and cinema enhanced movement and communication, they also showed how limited a human body's natural capacities were. This crisis of the body was especially evident in Russia in the aftermath of World War I, the Civil War, and War Communism. While technological innovations promised a clear road to a better future, bodies traumatized by the wars were too exhausted to keep up.18 Hence, in Russia it became especially critical to reconstruct the body itself; to discipline it by removing all signs of wastefulness and weakness. Theories were advanced that a body could operate as a perfect organism with maximum efficiency if it modeled itself on a machine. Pavlovian reflexology as well as other studies of the body aimed at making the body legible; conquering it so as to make it responsive to the demands of the environment. The art of the 1920s echoed these scientific preoccupations.19 In "Cine-Eyes. A Revolution" (1923), Dziga Vertov glorifies the aesthetic defamiliarization brought about by such a mechanical device as a film camera: "I am the mechanical eye. I, the machine, show you the world as only I can see it. ... I can thus decipher a world that you do not know."20 Technology discredited man's eye, the body part most actively engaged in the process of cognition. X-rays, microscopes, aerial photography, and the camera showed how much indeed humans had been unable to see. Dziga Vertov's ecstatic ode to the camera arises from the assumption that if only an artist adopts the camera as a prosthesis for his own deficient body ("We cannot improve the making of our eye, but we can endlessly perfect the camera."), he will be capable of transforming humanity: I am the Cine-Eye. I create a man more perfect than Adam was created... I take the strongest and most agile hands from one man, the fastest and best proportioned 17It is noteworthy that the experiments conducted by Gastev's Institute of Labor were later continued in the Russian Institute of Cybernetics. The invention of the contemporary field of cybernetics appeared in the context of space travel and is based on the idea that it is easier to adapt man to a new environment than to manipulate an environment in order to adapt it to man's needs. The term "cyborg" was coined to signify the concept of "persons who can free themselves from the constraints of the environment to the extent that they wish." See Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline, "Cyborgs and Space," in The Cyborg Handbook, ed. Chris Hables Gray (New York, 1995), 29. The leading Soviet cybernetician A. I. Berg wrote in 1962 that "modern cybernetics?the theory of the goal-directed management of complex processes?can be viewed in the USSR as the heir and successor of scientific management." See Kendall E. Bayles, "Alexei Gastev and the Soviet Controversy over Taylorism," Soviet Studies 29:3 (1977): 375. 18On this topic see, for example, Andrei Platonov, "Rodina Elektrichestva," in his Izbrannye proizvedeniia (Moscow, 1983), 39-53. 19Science fiction became one of the major genres, and Aleksandr Bogdanov, Aleksei Tolstoi, Viktor Shklovskii, Il'ia Erenburg, Valentin Kataev, and Marietta Shaginian tried their hand at creating works of technological fancy. Meanwhile, Futurists and Constructivists looked into the potential of technology to transform both body and mind. 20Dziga Vertov, "The Cine-Eyes: A Revolution," in The Film Factory: Russian and Soviet Cinema in Documents 1896-1939, ed.

The rest of those bodies get disposed, like defunct machine parts. In order to transform himself into a perfect man via technological means, man should regard the violence done to his body merely as a reassembly of parts. Industrial and military demands required attention to the masculine body in preference to the female one. It was the male body that thus became the site of crisis and controversy.22 In the technological world, those least optimistic about the body's capacities, like Vertov, imagined technology as armor, or a prosthesis, for the incapacitated human being. Gastev is more positive about man's capacities. Biomechanics stems from the belief that man does not need external mechanical prosthesis to survive, that the body itself can be turned into armor and can be utilized as a tool. Man's body contains within itself the ability to become a machine, and in so doing survive in the machine age. Another artist who firmly believed in the technological potential of the body and systematically adapted the science of biomechanics to his work was visionary avant-garde theater director Vsevolod Meyerhold, who was influenced by Gastev's work on biomechanics. He attempted to aestheticize biomechanics by combining it with classical Greek pantomime, the medieval Italian tradition of commedia dell'arte, and with the ancient art of the Japanese kabuki theater. Immersed into this mixture of artistic styles, biomechanics reemerged incarnated as a timeless, ludic art in Meyerhold's theater. Perhaps, the source for viewing the body as an aesthetic machine can be located in the Greek origin of the term "technology." Techne, signifying craft and art, allows one to see anything made by man as technology, and bodies in many ways are man-made constructs. During their lifetime, bodies adapt and learn a number of techniques that are culturally produced and transmitted, such as running long distances, dancing the Riverdance, eating with a knife and fork, and writing. Marcel Mauss extrapolates: "The body is man's first and most natural instrument, or more accurately, not to speak of instruments, man's first and most natural technical object, and at the same time his first technical means, is his body."23 Gastev's biomechanics was to bring man back to his own instrumentality by treating the machine as a model. ON THE ROAD TOWARD MACHINE AESTHETICS Gastev's concern over the body's weaknesses preceded his NOT and his interest in productivity and biomechanics. Gastev's biological engineering and productivism originated 21Dziga Vertov, Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov, ed. Annette Michelson (Los Angeles, 1995), 15, 92-93. 22In Men without Women: Masculinity and Revolution in Russian Fiction, 1917-1929 (Durham, NC, 2000), Eliot Borenstein demonstrates the pervasive masculinization of Soviet society in the aftermath of the October Revolution and the reflection of this process in various literary works of the time. 23Marcel Mauss, "The Notion of Body Techniques," in his Sociology and Psychology: Essays, trans. Ben Brewster (London, 1979), 104.</page><page sequence="7">Poetry of Labor and Labor of Poetry 215 in the idea, popular at the time, that biological instincts inevitably cause chaos and disorder both in man's internal life and in his environment.24 His first short story "Accursed Question" (1914) gives expression to the idea that sexual passion opposes one's humanity rather than contributes to it. The narrator articulates a strong belief that biology reduces man to an animal and that only his resistance to his own biology "let[s] the human being within him triumph." Not yet able to channel his desire into his passion for technology, Gastev's hero has to fall back on the seasoned technique of ascetic isolation.25 Gastev published the story under the pseudonym "Odinokii" ("The Lonely One"); the sad connotation of the word emphasized, possibly against the author's own intention, that asceticism was not a perfect solution.26 In time, Gastev was to solve this problem of loneliness through the idea of a new collective man united with others in machinism. In his anti-utopian novel We (1920), Evgenii Zamiatin brings to life Gastev's idealized world, in which men have turned themselves into machines and in which regularity, uniformity, and communality rule. As Zamiatin imagines it, such a mechanistic world will be devoid of individualism, and hence intimate feelings, such as passionate love, will be alien to it (when they intrude into the ordered world of the Single State, they wreak havoc on its icy harmony). Gastev's ideal world is not without passion, however. In Gastev's vision, loneliness is brought to naught by melding into the collective, and the writer's wish to achieve the perfect unity of one and all carries an almost sexual intensity: The harmonious chords of mass creativity will constantly give birth to desires, they will educate and foster the man who is continuously renewing himself. It will be possible to want him passionately, we can strive toward him with inexpressible vigor, he can be attained, but it is impossible to give concrete birth to him, he cannot be made an individual, he cannot be given a personal name. In their mad, joyous search for him, no one will remember or be aware of themselves. All they will know is the one, objective, great, growing, thrilling, world of harmony felt by all.27 Everyone will be part of this harmonious collective Man, and as such the desire for this man is autoerotic. Gastev's language here plays the role of the stimulant; it invokes desire for an absent, future man, for an abstraction. A live body has been substituted by a sign, a symbol of a unified being. And technology plays a fundamental role in the achievement of 240ne of the main staples of European fin de siecle decadence, with its characteristic anxiety over the waning, diseased culture, was the frank exploration of anarchic, destructive sexual impulses. In Russia, the erotic stories and poetry of decadents Valerii Briusov, Zinaida Gippius, and Fedor Sologub, as well as Lev Tolstoy's "The Devil" (1889) and Leonid Andreev's "The Abyss" (1902), assert the correlation between sexual desire and danger, destruction, and death. 250n the rich history of asceticism in Russian culture see V. Kotel'nikov, Orthodox Asceticism and Russian Culture: On the Path to Optina (St. Petersburg, 1994). 26Gastev later chose a pseudonym that did not contain the glum connotation of "Odinokii," but retained its exclusive character: "Popovich," after the hero of Russian by Unas (see Kurt Johansson, Aleksej Gastev: Proletarian Bard of the Machine Age [Stockholm, 1983], 26). 27Ibid., 50. Here, incidentally, Gastev shows the relationship between art and bioengineering. Like Tolstoy, Gastev thinks of art as an aphrodisiac. He applies himself to artistic pursuits to give rise to a desire for this new man he wishes to build. Elsewhere, he confesses that his aim is "to infect modern man with methodology of constant biological perfection, biological repairs and alterations" (Poeziia rabochego udara, 16).</page><page sequence="8">216 Julia Vaingurt this transformation. Gastev exclaims, "This beautiful, this marvelous thing can be created by the modern force of machinism!" Machinism here means the modeling of man upon the machine: "Since the rhythm is uniform, since machines are related to each other through their mechanical structure, is it not clear that the proletariat reared by the machine must and will also grow up as a quantity that is in the highest degree not only determined, but leveled, uniform?"28 Sexual passion, as an expression of individuality, leads to chaos. But through machinism, Gastev channels desire into the project of unifying man, thereby making it serve order. The turning to the machine grows out of a distrust of difference, which Gastev finds immoral. What Gastev fears most is his own difference, that side of himself that he perceives as alien and would like to purge. In the following sections we will trace how Gastev identifies and localizes this threatening force that emanates from within him as his Russianness and, finally, how he proceeds to eradicate it. THE BODY IN PAIN, OR THE ROMANCE OF SUFFERING Gastev's earlier distress with human weakness becomes more accentuated in the work environment, where the encounter with the uniformity and regularity of machine performance brings out the internal disorder and disproportion of the human element with particular clarity. This disparity between the body and the machine at first results in Gastev's growing dissatisfaction with the tediousness of technology, but later Gastev comes to realize that it is the body that is at fault. In his first autobiographical impressions, "From the Diary of a Streetcar-Driver," what begins as elation over the defiant speed of the machine ("ignoring the protests of the overdressed passengers and disregarding safety precautions, I switch on both motors at once") turns into dismay over how quickly it becomes humdrum and routine (There is only the hum of the motor, which also seems to be saying out loud: "And again, and again, and again..."). Very soon, in his poetry, Gastev will impel his machines to be more outspoken; soon he will learn to discern in machine-like, tedious repetitiveness the shoots of the life-sustaining pulse. But, as Kurt Johansson has noticed, in a number of early articles Gastev seems to find machines "soulless, cold, and eternally moving." At this stage, he sees this automatic consistency as hypnotic and oppressive: Gold for the owner pours automatically from the trough, the machines work automatically, even the people work like automatons. This eternal motion creates such an oppressive hypnosis and such work habits that it has given rise to a kind of tacit affirmation of order.29 Although Gastev manages to throw a blaming nod at the capitalist regime whenever he addresses the abusive repetitiveness of labor, he does not elaborate on what the monotony of such menial work has to do with capital and how its nature can be any different under a different political regime. In Gastev's later writings monotony and automatism do not 28Johansson, Aleksej Gastev, 49. 29Ibid., 27, 48.</page><page sequence="9">Poetry of Labor and Labor of Poetry 217 disappear under the more desirable socialism. Nothing in Gastev's descriptions of machines changes; he just learns to change his attitude toward them. In his newly found relationship to machines, Gastev simply learns to act out the self-sacrificing, ascetic impulse articulated in "Accursed Question." In his first collection of short stories, Romanticism, the factory with its bloodthirsty technology maims and kills its workers and appears as a symbol of oppression. But already in his early work there seems to be nothing outside the factory; this funereal vault stands for life itself: And the dusty stone arcs, grave as the dusk, sad as the midnight, oppressive as the clouds, roofed, enclosed this crusade of humped and tormented men in a tomb like, cold, indestructible, tightly shut funerary vault.30 The repetition of a synecdochical construction in which the factory's walls are compared to natural elements in their effect on people creates the impression that the factory simply participates in the natural order of things and its subjugation of humans is part of a natural cycle. Love poems to the technological embodiments of the monumental age begin to appear in Gastev's oeuvre. Gastev's falling in love with his oppressor is an act of reappropriation of his will. When he welcomes oppression, he stops being oppressed.31 The poem "I have fallen in love," in which the perfective aspect marks this change, is preceded by the poem "Thoughts of a Woman-Worker," which explains how this transformation was achieved. In the poem, a young woman who pines for the pastoral landscape of her childhood comes to realize that since there is no road back to it, she might as well find love for her new environment. This realization comes through a disruption of personal identity, marked grammatically by the persona's switching from the first person to the second: Tbi, vKpoii MauiHHbi cbokhmh iiBeTaMH Cover the machines with fresh flowers, AacKOH, hokhoh rpe3oii OTVMaHb, o??eH.32 Envelop them; cloud them with caresses and reverie. A similar disruption happens to the author of the poem, who takes on a female persona in order to stay within the limits of acceptable discursive practices while singing his love songs to a masculine factory. Gastev's trajectory is a search for meaning and continuity in a world bereft of them. The idea of a harmonious collective appears in Gastev's first cycle as a response to the fundamental discontinuity of death. He associates the collective with the continuity of life that gives meaning to individual deaths: "We march! ... The gloomy phantoms of recently slain warriors have risen. The living legends of the past have risen?forefathers felled by 30Gastev, Poeziia rabochego udara, 45. 3Nikolai Berdiaev claims that "technology is humanity's last love; and it is prepared to change its form under the influence of the object of its love." But he prefaces this statement by emphasizing the imposed nature of this relationship ("Chelovek i mashina," Voprosy ?loso?i, 1989, no. 2:159). The neoprimitivist Aleksandr Shevchenko also suggests that the infatuation with mechanicity is a compulsion, whihc humanity has been coerced to feel by a mechanistic universe ("Neoprimitivism: Its Theory, Its Potentials, Its Achievements," in Russian Art of the Avant-Garde: Theory and Criticism, ed. John Bowlt [New York, 1988], 45). 32Gastev, Poeziia rabochego udara, 113.</page><page sequence="10">218 Julia Vaingurt wounds. We walk behind them?in the very front, stronger, braver than us, the young warriors, brought to life anew, are marching."33 In an article from this time, he writes: "Joyously, perhaps, not without suffering, but with a suffering that is great and shared by all, we would give birth to a new, as yet unheard-of people who are proud, great, superior to ourselves." One worker who was present at Gastev's reading of his celebrated poem "We Grow from Iron" commented on the poet's annoyingly loud manner of recitation: "The worker there does not speak, he yells like out of a trumpet." Rolf Hellebust explains such "yelling" as having its origins in religious liturgies. The raising of one's voice as if in song mimics the invocation of a deity; here the orthodox deity is supplanted by "an iron demon."34 But I "hear" it as the primal scream of a human being in pain, a human being in the throes of recreating himself. Gastev comes to believe that if he stops resisting the machine and instead makes love to it, their union will result in the birth of a new being. TRANSGRESSING BORDERS It is through the act of naming that the transformation from the man oppressed by a machine into the machine's lover takes place: "A long time ago they gave us hammers instead of bread and made us work. They tortured us. ... But clutching the hammer, we called it a friend. Each stroke added iron to our muscles. The energy of steel penetrated our soul. And we, slaves once, encroached upon the world."35 In the second cycle, entitled Machines, Gastev gives meaning to the pain and suffering that he sees around himself by writing it into the plot of the creation of a new man born from the global marriage of men and machines. Gastev realizes that such colossal transformation must have catastrophic overtones. Here Gastev extends his ascetic goals much further: he comes to denounce life in general for the sake of a better, mechanistic world. While earlier there was no world outside the factory, now there is no world needed outside the factory, as the monstrosity of the factory has been discursively transformed into beauty. Gastev is enthralled by the marvel of the machine's monstrosity. Despite its destructive intentions, the devil-like factory eternally works good. Every poem becomes an allegory in which the industrial machine personifies the virtue of defiance. The feeling of being devoured by the plant becomes subsumed by the sensation of being enraptured and carried along by its satanic twirl. In these dynamics workers turn into fallen angels; they sacrifice themselves to the plant, and in return, it infuses them with its satanic powers. In "We have encroached!" the appeal "Let's plunge downward!" (Rinemtes'vniz!) verbalizes the rejection of the human and of the divine for the sake of the Luciferian passion for negation. In fact, the passionate melding of man with machine carries an overtone of sexual transgression (the union of different species): "I threw myself on the sharpened cutters of the machines. I crushed them, but I myself struggled in the grip of the metal. It was I who 33Ibid. 34See Rolf Hellebust, Flesh to Metal; Soviet Literature and the Alchemy of Revolution (Ithaca, 2003), 54, 50. 35Gastev, Poeziia rabochego udara, 139.</page><page sequence="11">Poetry of Labor and Labor of Poetry 219 a hundred years ago flooded with blood the streets of world cities."36 Tiski, "the grip of a vice," also has the connotation of "passionate embraces," and given the constant declarations of love to metal throughout the cycle, it is hard to see this transformation into a new being, complete with references to bloodletting, in any other way but as a sexual initiation.37 The violence of the imagery might have suggested rape were it not for the reciprocity with which the sides mutilate each other. The lyrical persona's passionate melding with the machine is a rite of passage that initiates him into the mechanistic world of perfection. In the process he acquires the ability to transgress borders: It was I who struggled then and tormented my own body on both sides of the border. And now, reborn, I march in the ranks again. Everything passes through my hands and tools. ... I go everywhere with my hammer, chisel, and drill. ... I march over borders, continents, oceans. I make the entire earth into my motherland.38 Gastev's new collective "I" obtains the privilege of leaving behind the spatial confines of one's country to be at home anywhere in the world. The fusion with the machine is accompanied by the acquisition of transnational identity. Gastev's preoccupation with spatial transformations and his celebration of an identity free of nationhood is evident in the central poem of the cycle, "Express," which the poet singled out as his favorite poem.39 Significantly, the poem inaugurates the theme of desirable America (envisioned by Gastev as a nation that has already entered the brave new mechanistic world) and articulates a desire to leave Russianness behind in the search for a more cosmopolitan, more modern identity. The Trans-Siberian express was finished by 1916, the year that Gastev wrote the poem, and the feat of its construction must have inspired Gastev to envision an amazing future for Siberia with more and more miraculous technological and social developments that would result in the melding of the old world with industrial, modern America. The time is the distant future and the poem follows the trajectory of the express train Panorama, which transverses the span of Siberia. It begins with an anthropomorphic Siberia that is "asleep, having donned the brocade of snow."40 This state of hibernation combined with the white purity of snow suggests great, untapped potential.41 Gastev metaphorically transforms the white expanse of Siberia into a screen, which, once the bright radiance of the Aurora Borealis touches it, turns into an immense organic cinema. The combination of the play of light on the snowy Siberian expanse and Gastev's inspired imagination creates the mirage of great technological developments, 36Ibid., 170. 37Ibid., 173. 38Ibid., 170. 39This particular poem had such an impression upon Zamiatin that he alluded to it in We. In the novel, the poem is one of the classics of the literary canon established by the Single State. 40Gastev, Poeziia rabochego udara, 158. 41 In the 1913 poem "New America" Aleksandr Blok explores the same trope of a snowy landscape to suggest a potential for a resuscitation of the old rural Russia into a youthful industrialized America.

It dashed forth! It struck upward with its flaming spray; it lit the mirage of the clouds in the cold skies."42 The poem invites the reader, situated as a member of an imaginary audience in a movie theater, to be seduced by the wondrous illusion. The poem recreates the famous era-making moment in filmmaking, when the Lumiere brothers screened the arrival of a train at a station. In the poem, the "curtain" of the northern lights rises to reveal an approaching train. But in contrast to the Lumiere brothers, Gastev does not intend to scare and delight the audience by feigning the train's bursting out of the screen into the theater; he is not interested in exploiting this modernist trope purely for shock effects. On the contrary, he desperately wishes to create the illusion that the audience can board the train and accompany it on its path. The train's trajectory is well delineated: it starts in the middle of Russia and, turning its back on the old world of Europe, follows its one-way route to the queen of all industrialized countries, America. The poem refers to America as the desired destination multiple times; for example, "Bering's city knows only two slogans: 'To the Pole!' and 'To America!" The made-up city of Bering symbolizes Siberia's openness to America and is the site of the underground tunnel that connects Siberia with Alaska, a tunnel that the Panorama is destined to cross on the way to its final destination: "now there is no frontier between the Old and the New worlds. The tunnel has become the symbol of the unity of the workers." The magical and metaphorical power of the Panorama lies in its ability to traverse Siberia, an amalgam of all peoples and nations, and direct all its inhabitants toward America, the imagined land of promise and progress. The tunnel to America under the Bering Straits offers a long-awaited climax to this exuberant journey: "the motors are breathing fast and rumbling, pumping the air, and the tunnel is shaking like a steel pulse in the sleeping waters of the ocean. One half hour?and America."43 The entrance into America is the final result of the process of the disappearance of Russian specificity, initiated by the spatial transformations of Siberia. The old Russian culture is completely eradicated in the new Siberia, composed of free settlers from all over the world: "No one talks of centuries long past, of their free, but idle songs, of their dulcet, but passive prayers." Characteristically, the Russian language also undergoes an essential change through its confluence with American English: "The debates [of the International] are being conducted in an international language composed of a synthesis of Russian and American English."44 BIOMECHANICS vs. RUSSIA Gastev's articles from his period of involvement in NOT make it clear that he ascribed his earlier fear and dislike of the monotonous rhythm of the machine, as well as his "non productive" sentiments, to the Russian character. In his article describing the methodology 42Gastev, Poeziia rabochego udara, 158. 43Ibid., 167, 168. 44Ibid., 159, 165.</page><page sequence="13">Poetry of Labor and Labor of Poetry 221 of the Institute of Labor, he begins by stating that "the difference between Russia and the West resides in the fact that the former is either lazy or elementarily impulsive; its population, as a rule, shows very little persistence or labor tenacity." These elements of the Russian character Gastev considers a bane and a disease, which only "an injection of work culture" can cure.45 In "Get Ready, Fitters!" published in 1923 in The Young Communist, Gastev introduces his favorite concept, "self-colonizers" (sobstvennye kolonizatory), which bespeaks his feelings toward man's ability to restrain, order, and, in a word, conquer himself. Gastev summons his readers to battle against themselves, against their own Russianness: "We must storm Russia from the inside, treat its mold and backwardness and put to work all things asleep."46 The Russian word for fitter, monter, contains the secondary connotation of a person involved in the artistry of montage. Gastev evokes this film-editing technique to express the creative principle behind his call for rebuilding Russia.47 Montage is a word borrowed from French, and Gastev uses it consciously to impress upon his readers the need for the intrusion of a foreign life and work principle into the landscape of their own country: We must announce the mobilization of new Robinsons, chiefly thinking townspeople, and equip them for a grand expedition through dirt roads, forests, villages, untouched marshes, where they will build new housing?from huts to skyscrapers, engender the sound of tools from ax to motor and fill Russia with cultural montage.48 The allusion to "Robinsons" that Gastev falls back on throughout all his didactic-theoretical works suggests the possibility of an adaptation to, and cultivation of, the wilderness. Adaptation is an extremely important concept for Gastev, as the reconstruction of the human is required in part because of the lack of machines, the country's wilderness: "In a country devoid of machines, you are the best mechanism."49 Gastev's emphasis on adaptation to external conditions was likely informed by the studies of Russian reflexologists such as Ivan Pavlov and Vladimir Bekhterev, who seemed to have uncovered a whole hidden world of organic mechanistic behavior and showed how much internal change occurs under the influence of external stimuli. In his 1921 article defining the goals of his Institute of Labor, Gastev explains how machinism provides a new 45Gastev, Kak nado rabotat' (Moscow, 1972), 33. 46Gastev, "Snariazhaites', montery!" in Poeziia rabochego udara, 226. In this article, Gastev enumerates the debilitating aspects of Russian culture: "skepticism" and "passive contemplativeness." In another article, "The Time Has Come" ("B'et chas"), he continues the list of cultural/institutionalized ills: "social/domestic slovenliness," "panic rhythm," and "faithlessness, the rust of the psyche, confused walking, scatter-brainedness" {Poeziia rabochego udara, 248-49). 47Gastev argues that the modernist technique of montage, associated with the speed and pace of modern life, should be taken out of the realm of pure art and applied to the reality of his country. In this respect, Gastev's biomechanical interests and his interests in reconstructing the human are Constructivist in their character. 48Gastev, Poeziia rabochego udara, 226. 49Ibid., 252.</page><page sequence="14">222 Julia Vaingurt environment for the development of the human.50 The snag in Gastev's philosophy lies in the fact that the development and spread of machines had not yet reached Russia, so that, in a way, his institute's task became to foster certain reflexes without the presence of external stimuli. Gastev's biomechanics, hence, is a peculiarly Russian method of body engineering, as it takes into consideration a deficit of technology that is supposed to provide external stimuli for human regeneration. "Biomechanics can be cultivated in a refined laboratory conditions," Gastev proclaims, "but it can also be placed in any homeroom, outdoors, on arenas, in any workshop."51 He himself concedes that he is attempting to go further than Taylor: the latter was preoccupied only with the solution to the problem of production, while Gastev, in adopting Taylor's strategies, tries to solve the problem of culture.52 Marcel Mauss explains that bodily techniques are learned and habitual, and as such are cultural constructs. Hence, the instrumentality of the body is of a fixed and methodical character, and this regularity and repetition are necessary both for the body's proper functioning and culture's subsistence. Similarly, Gastev redefines culture by removing any associations with intellectual knowledge, artistic achievement, or refined taste and limiting its meaning to social customs and patterns of behavior. While nature, according to Gastev, presupposes chaos and disorder, culture is the ability to train one's body to perform systematic actions, and to break with previous cultural patterns.53 Gastev attempts to disassociate his restructuring enterprise from the Russian tradition: "Culture is the sum of habits of a people: its ability to work, the sum of its processed capabilities. We are a country devoid of traditions." Gastev brings culture back to its etymology: Latin's cultus means tilling, working upon nature. Culture is compulsion and proper habit rather than the cultivation of pleasurable activities: "Orientation toward mood, toward the constant pursuit of diversion of adults and children ... inevitably leads to the breakdown in labor."54 Pursuit of pleasure is at the core of our natural predilections, but is antagonistic to the cultivation of order. For Gastev, then, the body lies somewhere on the border between the natural and the cultural: it is a machine in embryo. The body needs culture, with its mechanisms of order and compulsion, to achieve its proper productive functioning. On the other hand, the tempered body becomes a virtual stronghold of culture. Gastev believes that through the training of the body, one tempers the psyche to make it more fit to cope with cultural shifts. Hence, biomechanics provides a cure for the catastrophic changes visited upon Russia: "Social automatism is the collateral for the integrity and indissolubility of human culture at a time when its material buttress is crumbling."55 50Gastev alludes to Bekhterev, who expanded the biological law of adaptation to inorganic elements as well as applied the theory of reflexivity toward the self-preservation of the collective. The collective learns how to adapt to certain external stimuli; it subsequently becomes dependent on the new habits (reflexes) while it continues to reproduce external stimuli to satisfy its habitual behavior. See Vladimir Bekhterev, Collective Reflexology: The Complete Edition, trans Eugenia Lockwood and Alisa Lockwood (New Brunswick, NJ, 2000). 51 Gastev, Kok nado rabotat', 41. 52Ibid., 52. 53Gastev compares biomechanics, the training of the body for work, to artistic training. Like a violinist who learns to use his wrists through a series of mechanical exercises, workers should learn the art of labor (ibid.). 54Ibid., 55, 57. 55Ibid., 58.</page><page sequence="15">Poetry of Labor and Labor of Poetry 223 Although Gastev avoids discussing the arts in his definition of culture, he formulates his cultural project in aesthetic terms. Gastev's conception of scientific organization of labor is subject to a sense of order and harmony;56 he imagines it as a spatial arrangement that leads to an economy of gestures: "The shortest line, the gain of space, the laws of motion of numerous objects with different velocities and with intersection points on a limited number of lines." Similarly, Gastev pictures man's movement in geometric terms (not so different from the way it is imagined in the works of contemporaneous cubism): "The movement of a working human is a combination of lines, points, angles, and weights, all working with a certain tolerance, with habitual efficiency."57 A hybrid of productivist rhetoric and modernist aesthetics, Gastev's biomechanical man is drawn from art rather than from reality. So what transforms man from a mess of dysfunctional flesh and blood into a functional assemblage of sharp points and straight lines? Biomechanics is the science of complete, minute awareness of one's body and then the training that transforms this awareness into the unconscious habit of regulation of one's body.58 Man cannot cultivate his machine-like nature and survive in a machine-like world without attention to his own energy consumption and production. And one result of this is that Gastev does not associate food with any of its traditional connotations, whether as a source of pleasure, knowledge, celebration, or communion: The science of the nutrition of a working organism must be as exact as the thermal sciences, as the science of the nutrition of a steam engine, an electric motor. The consumption of human energy must be instrumentally measured to the thousandth of a calorie. ... There mustn't be anything sacred here.59 For Gastev, then, food is merely raw energy. PRODUCTION AND CONTROL OF LANGUAGE Gastev's insistence on regulating consumption and minimizing waste associated with the body extends to language as well. Just like food, language transforms into an energy resource whose intake and outflow have to be strictly and cautiously regulated. Gastev does not tire of repeating the necessity of limiting the waste of time and energy on empty talk?"The most complex thought can be laid out in five minutes"?and so just as he wishes to restrict 56Zamiatin lets his protagonist in We point out how much aesthetic pleasure can be derived from the perception of order. D formulates the concept of "aesthetic nonfreedom": "Why is the dance beautiful? Answer: precisely because it is nonfree movement, because all the fundamental significance of the dance lies precisely in its aesthetic subjection, its ideal nonfreedom" (We, 6). "Gastev, Kak nado rabotat', 51. The principle of effective gesture is that element that drew Meyerhold to biomechanics and Taylorism. Taylorism equipped Meyerhold with the au courant vocabulary for the expression of his philosophy of theater that foregrounded movement and the mechanics of the body. 58Gastev's training has several stages: the first one is the training of the plasticity of bodily movement; the second is the plasticity of the mind (which can be disassociated from one's wants, likes, and dislikes) and finally, the skills of organizing and planning in space and time. 59Gastev, Kak nado rabotaf, 51.</page><page sequence="16">224 Julia Vaingurt and regulate the flow of food and air through the body, so too does he wish to restrict the free flow of language.60 The title of his last book of poetry, The Word Under a Press, articulates the task Gastev sets for himself as a poet: to compress language for maximum efficiency. Poetry becomes a source of energy, what Gastev calls an instrument of "sharp verbal impact." In the sixth edition to his Collected Works (1925), Gastev mentions that literature becomes irrelevant in the technological age, when "radio is so successful at arguing not only with a word, but with a thought."61 Friedrich Kittler explains how at the turn of the century developments in modern information technologies, such as the radio, typewriter, phonograph, and film, deindividualized verbal expression, separating it from the realm of interpersonal communication. Language stopped being the carrier of sense or thought and became the product of the body-machine, the machine that can emit noise.62 The time period Kittler describes also witnessed an upsurge of poetic experiments that approached language as a physiological activity, concentrating on such qualities as automatism, reflexivity, and repetition. Poetry attempted to compete with other technologies in recording the noise made by the body-machine. In Gastev's last and most original poetic work, "A Packet of Orders," language (that is, bodily noise) echoes the noise of the times. In the preface, Gastev introduces the concept of recording the noise of time that passes like electricity through the body and gets recorded in language: " Humankind is on guard. It is waiting for a whistle. A split second and the triumphant recognition of the roar of the future events will burst through the dim chaos of these days." The poet also provides technical instructions, coaching the reader in the art of machine-like output of his poetry for the ears of the audience and specifying the speed and force with which the poems should be recited: "'A Packet of Orders' reads in even sections, as if fed to a machine. There should be no intonation, no pathos, not pseudo-classical elation and no stressed emotive places in the reading. Words and phrases follow one another with even speed." Finally, Gastev elucidates that the speaker of the poem is a kind of longshoreman who loads verbal material straight into the audience's brains: "The loading action is taking place and the packet is given to the listener as a libretto of weighty events."63 In both his last cycle and the articles that followed, Gastev attempts to reconstruct mechanistic tempos: his speech becomes a kind of a conveyor belt that sends stimulating shocks meant to whip and train the modern man-machine. Gastev opens his collected works with the poem "We Grow from Iron," in which in the process of melding into iron, the lyrical persona loses the ability to speak, to create narrative; the iron man is capable of moaning out just two essential words: "we will win!" (my pobedim).64 This verbal constipation takes pleasure away from the gift of speech, leaving only pain, and prefigures Gastev's attitude toward poetic expression. Not only 60Gastev, Poeziia rabochego udara, 235. 6,Ibid., 18. "Friedrich A. Kittler, Discourse Networks, 1800/1900 (Stanford, 1990).

The author's mention of Gastev's inability to discriminate between jelly and poetry is also incorrect. Gastev's sole aim is to make poetry into a kind of jelly, nourishment that would produce and sustain a new iron man. And just as in the making of preserves, economy rules in Gastev's poetry. The words that Gastev concentrates on are the ones that can be continuously recycled. Such conservation is necessary because Gastev builds his biomechanics in order to compensate for Russia's deficiencies: its lack of machine resources and technology, its lax bodies and slack minds. Gastev frames all Russia's national ills in the context of the cultural misuse of language: "Instead of simple words: I hear you, yes, no?[we have] an entire philosophy. It is not by accident that we have so many psychologists and philosophers in Russia. This might be the complementary side of passivity, of sluggishness."66 That is why the reconstruction and reorientation of language toward the new "speech" (govor) of machinery must accompany cultural biomechanics. In essence the former task is part of the latter one, since language is a form of bodily technology and is subject to the mechanics of the organism as a whole. If the body works like a machine, the language that it produces to communicate its needs also responds to the machine-like rhythm. Disciplining and restraining Russian philology (slovesnost'), which is a major constituent of its national culture, is an effective means of eliminating Russian specificity. "That patriotic sloppiness characteristic of all our folk epics (bylinas), anecdotes, and imaginative literature must be eradicated irreversibly," Gastev claims. "We must train the people to observe sharply and record precisely."67 &gt;KeAe3o, &gt;KeAe3o, &gt;KeAe3o, BarpaHKH, bhhtw He raoxh, O, TacTeB Kyeiiib th noe3y, IlpHHflBiiiH HceAe 3a cthxh.

The more emphasis he puts on the culture of the 65Parody on Gastev, published in the Proletcult's Gudki (1919, no. 1), quoted in V.

Gastev can imagine the body to be transparent, in contrast to language, because in a sense he rejects the body's materiality. A physical body's internal organs and sensual actions would cause havoc in the organization of meaning, but Gastev's body is a sign. And biomechanics is a discursive practice that formulates, defines, and organizes the body, making its functioning outside of this discursive field impossible. Outside of labor, Gastev's body does not exist. Disorganized, it has no meaning or function. As a poet, Gastev realizes that as a textual construct, the body is infinitely malleable. Just as in Fedorov's projections of a future scientifically created man who will have no internal organs, Gastev' body is vacuous. Growing from iron, Gastev's poetic persona is a construct with no regard for actual bodily dynamics: "I grow shoulders of steel and immensely strong arms. I have merged with the iron of the construction. I have risen."69 It is interesting that Gastev places the poem containing this image at the beginning of his collected verse. Fedorov saw in man's assumption of the vertical posture the beginnings of his creativity and hence his self-creation. The rising of Gastev's persona at the end of the poem marks a new step in man's evolution. The transformation of man into machine becomes a continuation in the trajectory of the assumption of an upright position. Such cybernetic metamorphosis leads to Gastev's creativity as a poet and his persona's creativity as a laborer. Fedorov's formulation of the common task rests on the premise that man's most powerful creative activities lie in the antimimetic realm. Even the assumption of the vertical posture and the realization of self that accompany it take place against Nature. Fedorov divides art into two categories: the art of imitation (the art of false creative reproduction) and the art of reality (actual resurrection). In Fedorov's view, the art of imitating nature is passive, immoral, and ineffectual ("The art of imitation is the representation of the sky, which deprives us of life and earth, devouring all living things.") This particular art serves the sensual cult of woman rather than the sensible and ethical task of resurrection of ancestors and the achievement of immortality. True aesthetics, in Fedorov's view, is inseparable from the latter goal. According to Fedorov, true art (transformative rather than imitative) aims to unify all men, all generations, and all human endeavors, but particularly religion, ethics, and science, in the search for immortality.70 Thus, the organization of life from chaos into cosmos is inseparable from the abandonment of the principle of mimesis. 68Such an orientation toward bodily language and a move away from verbal expression was characteristic of the modern theatrical art (not just in Meyerhold's biomechanical system of actor-training, but also in Nikolai Foregger's dance studio or Boris Ferdinandov's Experimental Heroic Workshop). For a poet this distrust of words might seem somehow unsuitable, and yet it is not much different from a similar distrust toward traditional verbal expression, evident in Futurists' search for trans-sense language. 69Gastev, Poeziia rabochego udara, 19. Igal Halfin reads the imagery of the poem as "a mighty proletarian erection" and interprets the end of the poem in which the persona at last comes up with two essential words, my pobedim, as the proletarian's orgasm, which metaphorically stands for "the acquisition of the ability to articulate his thoughts." (See his "The Rape of Intelligentsia: A Proletarian Foundation Myth," Russian Review 56 (January 1997): 103. 70Nikolai Fedorov, Filosofiia obshchego dela (London, 1970), 2:241, 242.</page><page sequence="19">Poetry of Labor and Labor of Poetry 227 Gastev's last biomechanical group of poems, which serves as a bridge between his poetic endeavors and his purely scientific biomechanical experiments, comes from the same antimimetic principle. Gastev adopts Fedorov's view that the contemplation and pursuit of sensual pleasures present in mimetic arts is inimical to action and creation of the collective superman. Gastev makes the rhythm of the machine the sole principle of construction in his poetry. LABORING POETICS Fedorov's ideas on art do not, however, present direct instructions for action, or Gastev's notion of what constitutes action. With his distaste for Russian culture and its passive verbosity, he looks for inspiration elsewhere. While offering a poetics of labor, Taylor does not provide models for laboring poetics, either. Instead, Gastev locates directions for writing active poetry in Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's "Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature."71 According to Marinetti's own confession, the rules for the new poetics he was advocating were whispered to him by the propeller of an airplane. Despite the fact that Marinetti's manifesto aims at freeing words from the constraints of immaterial thought, while Gastev wishes to reform and constrain words, both share a predilection for making language into a material product worthy of the new life amid inspiring machines. Gastev, who in an attempt to avoid mimesis turns to the buzz of machines for inspiration, clearly was stirred by Marinetti's manifesto, which had come straight from the mouth of a propeller.72 "A Packet of Orders" is a collection of ten "orders." Poetry must be productive, and Gastev's "orders" hammer at the listeners' ears, chiseling new men. Gastev follows Marinetti's instructions: his orders contain no adjectives or adverbs (which Marinetti felt were meditative and inimical to dynamics). Marinetti suggested that poetry should be built out of nouns, the most material of all words; and Gastev's poems are molded primarily out of nouns, making expression as economical and gainful as possible. Marinetti allows for the presence of verbs, but only in their infinitive forms (the Italian futurist finds that it is only these forms that are independent of the individual psychology of the poet); and Gastev's orders are sprinkled with infinitives and imperatives that express purposefulness and an orientation toward action. Finally, Marinetti's propeller insists on the creation of compound neologisms that speedily evoke images in all their complexity: Just as aerial speed has multiplied our knowledge of the world, the perception of analogy becomes ever more natural for man. One must suppress the like, the as, the so, the similar to. Still better, one should deliberately confound the object with the image that it evokes, foreshortening the image to a single essential word.73 71Johansson draws attention to Gastev's use of infinitives and compound neologisms that conforms to the prescriptions of the famous Italian futurist (Aleksej Gastev, 95). 72F.

Gastev taps into musical terminology to forego sense in favor of sound and rhythm: "Asia - all in B, America?a chord higher. Africa - G flat." To impart weight, density, and intensity to his verbal product, Gastev incorporates geometric shapes and numbers: " Shoot out a square of black. Toss cubes of yellow to the electronic cranes. Scatter events on planes and cubes. Give a circular motion. Cross everything along axes. Twenty centuries in a ladder."75 Gastev's orders reorganize space and reinvent time. For all their simplicity, their aspirations are grand. Order 1 begins by sorting and organizing people, the source and technical material of further reorganization of the world. This order applies two instruments to assist in its biomechanical restructuring of the human: a manometer, presumably utilized here for measuring the extent to which people are pressed into ordered columns, and a gun that finalizes the order. Those unable to fit into the perfect column are shot down. Gastev's succinct formulation "people to waste" (liudi v brak) articulates the transformation of human beings into manufactured articles; the ones unable to fit into the production standard are rejected and eliminated. The presence of a gun establishes the need for military discipline during the reconstruction of the universe. Order 1 ends with the imperative "Freeze!" (Zamri!). It marks a pause in the constant tempo and indicates an exit from human time, while Order 2, which begins with a reference to a chronometer, initiates a new reading of time. Order 2 integrates the column from Order 1 that is frozen in time into the process of production. The order never specifies what is being produced. Its aim is to set a certain pace of work as if the machines manufacture new time itself?the rhythm of new life: XpoHOMeTp, Ha 4e&gt;KypcTBO. Chronometer, report to duty. K CTaHKaM. To the machines.

As she reads the instructions about how to remake philistines into man-machines by pressing language out of them and driving logarithms and geometry into their bodies, the reader undergoes the essential transformation under the ordering and orderly shocks of the hypnotic rhythm. As logarithms and geometry enter the reader's body, the orders get fulfilled. The mechanistic rhythm of the poems, their technical and austere language, and their form of industrial and military orders are all consistent with Gastev's experimental usage of words as a technical medium for creating a new world. Gastev's poetry is an action, a performance of a man-machine. The result of his experiments approaches the Futurists' idea of the universal language closer than their own creations ever did. Paradoxically, the Futurists were too attached to the Russian language to be able to create a universal language. Khlebnikov's experiments in trans-sense language, for example, celebrate the Russian language by exploring all the potentialities of its morphology and syntax. By contrast, Gastev uses the Russian language irreverently, substituting it whenever possible with foreign borrowings. Gastev's poetry is infinitely translatable; but even without translation, a non-speaker of Russian can get the gist by tracing numbers, musical terms, and industrial and military jargon. By primarily using technical jargon filled with foreign borrowings, Gastev attempts to press the Russianness out of the new man. Language is a chain that links man to his national tradition and culture. The transformation of language becomes a step in Gastev's biomechanics, which cannot be understood other than in terms that transcend national restrictions. Russianness, which Gastev codes as feminine, is incompatible with the new masculine active man, and Gastev's biomechanics is directed at killing the Russian in him. Gastev's vocabulary of self-colonization exposed the innate connection between Soviet Russia's need for technologization and its adulterous desire for the West. This language of adulteration, more so than any other element of Gastev's technological innovation, was incompatible with the promulgation of the siege mentality cultivated in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. In 1938 Gastev was purged.</page></plain_text>
