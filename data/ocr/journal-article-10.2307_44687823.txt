Chou Ford Motor Company Copyright © 2007 SAE International ABSTRACT An experimental study was conducted using a dynamic rollover component test system (ROCS) to study the effects of activating a pyro- mechanical buckle pre-tensioner and an electric retractor on the driver and front right passenger head and pelvis excursions. The ROCS is a unique system capable of producing vehicle responses that replicate four distinct phases of a tripped rollover: trip initiation, roll initiation, free-flight vehicle rotation, and vehicle to ground contact. This component test system consists of a rigid occupant compartment derived from a mid-size SUV with complete 1st row seating and interior trim, a simulated vehicle suspension system and an elastic vehicle-to-ground-contact surface. The ROCS system was integrated with a Deceleration Rollover Sled (DRS). Dynamic responses of the ROCS system, including both the rigid compartment and occupant, were measured and recorded. A brief discussion regarding the similarities of the vehicle kinematics generated by a full vehicle curb trip test to that of the ROCS test performed for this study is given. A total of 15 tests were conducted using Hybrid III anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) of various sizes: 5th, 50th with seated and standing pelvis and 95th percentile ATDs. The ATDs were placed in the driver and 1st row passenger seating positions and restrained by belt systems. A standard 3-point seat belt system with a combination of a buckle mounted pyro-mechanical pretensioner and a motorized electric retractor were used to generate seat belt tension. The ATD's dynamic head and pelvis displacement, head to vehicle interiors contact and seat belt loads were recorded and compared. High speed digital cameras were used to record the ATD and vehicle kinematics. INTRODUCTION The recent introduction of new advanced active and passive safety systems has been the result of automobile manufactures and suppliers concentrated efforts toward reducing the likelihood and potential for serious injury resulting from automobile crash events. Several recent studies, including one by the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA), have predicted active safety system such as Electronic Stability Control (ESC) may help reduce serious injuries and fatalities in single vehicle accidents [1-2]. However, more data is needed before the benefits of such systems can be fully determined. NHTSA has reported that over 1 00 2007 MY vehicles will have ESC technology available [3]. Additionally, advanced passive safety systems such as Ford's Rollover Safety Canopy™ system that are designed to provide occupant ejection mitigation have become available on steadily increasing numbers of vehicles. While active safety systems may reduce the likelihood of a single vehicle crash, it is not possible for them to completely eliminate the possibility of a crash. Additional sensors placed on the vehicle to enable the functionality of the active safety system may provide data that could be used towards developing enhanced passive safety systems. Before these systems can be developed, several critical areas including test methods, crash prediction algorithms, restraint 534</page><page sequence="2">system activation times and hardware design must be investigated. The inability of existing full vehicle laboratory rollover crash test methods to produce repeatable vehicle and occupant responses has been discussed in a number of studies [4-5]. This fact presents unique technical challenges to researchers and engineers in studying occupant kinematics and restraint systems during rollover events. Consequently many researchers have attempted to overcome this challenge by utilizing simplified test methods or computer models [6] to replicate the forces and moments experienced by the vehicle or occupants during a rollover event. Several studies have utilized a component test method to either quasi-statically or dynamically replicate the free flight rotation of a vehicle. These test methods, typically include only a vehicle seat, a restraint system, and an occupant [7-11]. Few studies have utilized full vehicle test methods [12 - 13]. Very few studies have attempted to study restraint systems during all phases of a simulated rollover event using a representative vehicle body, restraint system and/or interior components. Bostrom et al. [14] utilized a rigid sled test rig to study the effects of various restraint systems on occupant motion during a simulated rollover event. The test rig included a generic representation of the first row seating components of a vehicle. The test rig was restrained by a pair of guiding steel pivot arms and relied on a rigid contact to generate a tripping force to rotate the rig about a fixed axis. However, the rig neglected the compliances in the tires and suspension. In this study, the vehicle responses are generated from the ROCS and are comparable to a full vehicle curb trip test. The influence of seat belt pre-tension and activation times on various size ATD kinematics in simulated tripped rollovers using ROCS is investigated. METHODOLOGY TEST SYSTEM In order to study the effect of the restraint systems in an environment as representative and repeatable as possible, a ROIIover Component Test System (ROCS) [15] was used for this study. The system includes a major portion of a production vehicle enclosed with a rigid exterior. The system utilizes a simple two dimensional elastic representation of the vehicles suspension and tires to approximate the effect of lateral tripping forces on both the vehicle and occupant kinematics during the event. This feature helps generate a representation of the initial phases of a vehicle experiencing lateral trip. The effect of suspension compliance on roll rate for the ROCS was discussed in [15]. The variation in vehicle response that occurs as a result of suspension stiffness values may have an effect on occupant motion. Therefore for each test the same suspension settings were used. For this study, a Deceleration Rollover Sled (DRS) [16] was used to laterally trip the test fixture by applying a 24mph - 4g deceleration test pulse. The test fixture, shown in Figure 1 , was built to have the approximate physical characteristics of a typical sport utility vehicle (SUV). The test fixtures track width, mass, center of gravity, and moments of inertia were measured and compared to a collection of similar type production vehicles. The test fixture includes the complete 1st row seating and interior components of a typical mid-size SUV. The second and third row seating components were removed to allow for the installation of test equipment essential for performing the tests. High speed cameras were mounted along the front and rear of the occupant compartment. The data listed in Table 1 shows the physical properties of the test fixture and that of a 'typical' SUV. The values for the 'typical' SUV were derived from measurements averaged for over 20 M Y1 994-2005 SUV produced by various manufacturers. Figure 1 ROCS and DRS Test Systems As can be seen in Table 1, the mass and inertial properties of the ROCS system are similar to those of a typical SUV. Therefore, the tripping forces needed to roll the ROCS system 535</page><page sequence="3">are very similar to that experienced in the full vehicle curb trip. However, because ROCS system utilizes a DRS sled, the manner of applying this force to the vehicle is somewhat different. In the curb trip the vehicle is accelerated to a constant velocity and slide into a curb. For the DRS system, the ROCS is placed on a cart with a tripping flange. The cart and the vehicle are accelerated to a constant velocity and then cart is decelerated using a series of dynamic braking system. In this study, the full scale curb trip test velocity was approximately 21MPH, while the ROCS velocity was nearly 23MPH. Both vehicles were subjected to a 4g average lateral deceleration.

Adjustments to the D-ring and seat track positions were made for the respective ATD sizes in accordance with FMVSS208 requirements. Measurements were taken and the ATDs were positioned in their respective seating positions for each test according to ATD drop procedure. As with any automotive crash test, ATD positioning can be affected by numerous factors leading to ATD positioning variability form test to test. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the typical pre- test position of a Hybrid III 50th%le ATD positioned in the driver and passenger seats, respectively. Figure 2 Pre-Test Configuration of a Driver 50 %ile ATD Figure 3 Pre-Test Configuration of Passenger 50 %ile ATD Sensors were mounted between the driver and passenger seats to measure roll, pitch, and yaw rates as well as lateral, vertical, and longitudinal accelerations. Each seat belt was instrumented with load cells mounted on the lap and shoulder portions and also near the seat belt retractor. Contact switches were placed on the ATDs head and arm. In addition, a string potentiometer was attached to the bottom of the ATD pelvis to measure relative pelvis displacement during the tests. RESTRAINT SYSTEM A 3-point seat belt system was used in all tests. The seat belt system consisted of the vehicles' original production seat belt webbing, latch, buckle, anchor and D-ring. The system employed either a conventional load limiting retractor or a motorized retractor. When activated, the motorized retractor utilizes an electric motor to rotate the belt spool and apply a tension force to the belt system. Additional 536</page><page sequence="4">tension was applied to the belt system during the rollover events by activating a seat belt buckle mounted pyro-mechanical pre-tensioner. In this study, the force applied to the belt system by the motorized retractor is much less and over a relatively longer time period than the buckle mounted pyro-pretensioner. TEST MATRIX All ROCS tests were performed at a nominal speed of 24MPH, and subjected to an average lateral deceleration of 4g. Several ROCS tests were used to generate baseline vehicle and occupant responses. Comparisons of the dynamic ROCS vehicle responses were made to an actual mid-sized SUV tested using a curb trip rollover test method. For the subsequent tests, the activation times for the buckle pre-tensioner and electric retractor were determined from the data generated from the first baseline test using Hybrid III 50th%le ATDs. The analysis identified times, relative to the first cart and brake contact, based on the amount of pelvis displacement, lap belt load, test fixture roll angle, and angular rate and ATD pelvis displacements. The activation times were determined by taking into consideration (1) the time necessary for the electric retractor to turn the spool and apply tension to the belt system (approximately 200-300ms), and (2) the time needed for the buckle pre-tensioner to stroke (approximately 6-1 Oms) and (3) the amount of lap belt loading and ATD pelvis displacement present in the system at the time of activation. Therefore, as can be seen in Table 2 and Figures 4 and 5, the activation times were chosen to have a high probability of generating forces in the belt system that coincide with specific levels of seat belt loads, vehicle roll rate, angle and ATD dummy displacements. The activation times chosen for the buckle mounted pyro-mechanical pre-tensioner and electric retractor numbered in Figures 4 and 5 correspond to those shown in Table 2. Obviously, the activation times chosen for this study were made without considering the capabilities of current rollover prediction algorithms and may not be attainable in a production vehicle. The activation times, baseline pelvis displacements, and lap belt loads are shown in Figures 4 and 5 for the passenger and driver, respectively. In these figures, the tests are divided into four distinct phases: trip initiation, roll initiation, free flight rotation and ground contact. Trip initiation occurs early in the event, between 0 and 60 milliseconds during which the vehicle primarily experiences lateral g forces. Roll Initiation occurs between 60 and 280ms and it is during this time the vehicle begins to experience increases in rotational forces but still remains in contact with the DRS cart. Free flight rotation occurs between 280 and 800 milliseconds, during which time period the vehicle is no longer in contact with the ground and rotates at approximately a constant angular rate. Ground contact follows free flight and begins when the vehicle touches the test ground surface. The test matrix shown in Table 3 summarizes the retractor type, pre-tensioner triggering times, and the ATD used for each test conducted for this study. RESULTS Vehicle Kinematics Figure 6 compares the kinematics of test fixture used in the ROCS to that of a vehicle experiencing a curb trip test. The illustrations in this figure were taken from high speed films recorded during the tests. The illustrations depict the vehicles at times corresponding approximately to: trip initiation (2msec), roll initiation (202 msec), free flight rotation (462 msec), and exterior to ground impact (840 msec). Figures 7, 8 and 9 compare the roll- rate, roll-angle, and lateral-acceleration time histories for the two tests, respectively. 537</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4 Passenger Pelvis Displacement, Belt Loads and Activation Times Figure 5 Driver Pelvis Displacement, Belt Load and Activation Times 538</page><page sequence="6">Table 2 Activation Times, Vehicle and ATD Recorded Responses Activation Activation Roll Roll Baseline Baseline Baseline Number Time (ms) Rate at Angle Driver Pelvis Driver Lap Driver TTF at Displacement Belt Load (N) Retractor (deg/s) TTF (mm) Load (d§g) 1 1 3 0 0 .4 3 2 35 15 Õ -.17 4 5 3 66 ĪĪ3 2 !Õ6 8 19 4 95 92 5 ~ 19 95 27 5 130 122 9 42 345 TTĪ 6 282 287 40 22 1ÕÕ5 2Ī7 7 347 276 58 15 462 ĪĪ4 Table 3 Test Matrix Test Retractor Retractor Pyro- Driver I Passenger Number Type Trigger Buckle ATD ATD Time Trigger (ms) Time (ms) 1 Production N/A No Fire 50" 50" 2 Production N/Ā ī 50^ 50™ 3 Production N/Ā 282 5Õín 5Õín 4 Production N/A No Fire 5^ 95^ 5 Production N/Ā 130 5^ 95^ 6 Production N/Ā 130 95ÎR Š" 7 Production N/A No Fire 50tn 50tn (standing pelvis) 8 Production N/A 130 50in 5(f (standing pelvis) 10 Production No Fire 130ms 50tn SO01 1 1 Electric No Fire No Fire 5ÕfR 50^ 12 Electric ī 95 5Cf 50^ 13 Electric ī 347 50™ ŠČf 14 Electric 35 66 50™ 5Cf 15 " Electric ī No Fire 50^ 50^ 539</page><page sequence="7">Figure 6a Trip Initiation Comparison (T = 2 ms) Figure 6b Roll Initiation Comparison (T = 202 ms) Figure 6c Free Flight Rotation Comparison (T = 462ms) 540</page><page sequence="8">Figure 6d Ground Impact Comparison (T = 840ms) Figure 7 Roll Angle Comparisons of ROC and Full Vehicle 541</page><page sequence="9">Figure 8 Roll Rate Comparisons of ROC and Full Vehicle Figure 9 Lateral Acceleration Comparisons of ROC and Full Vehicle Curb Trip 542</page><page sequence="10">Figure 10 Average Free Flight Roll Rate Figure 11 Average Free Flight Roll Rate Percent Difference Because the ROCS system was designed to be a reusable device, it does not simulate vehicle deformation. This obviously will have an effect on the vehicle kinematics that occur following vehicle to ground contact. The capability of the ROCS system to produce repeatable results was discussed in [1], However, the amount of test-to-test variation in roll rate is examined in this study. The average free flight roll rate for the 1 5 ROCS tests is found approximately to be 265 °/sec as shown in Figure 10. A comparison of the percentage difference of average vehicle roll rate for the various runs ranges from 0.1% to 3.2% as shown in Figure 1 1 . 543</page><page sequence="11">Occupant Kinematics a) Baseline Driver - Hybrid III 50th Seated Pelvis Baseline tests were run without activation of a pre-tensioning device. Figure 12 illustrates the 50,h%le Hybrid III driver kinematics for a baseline test. During the tripping phase of the test, the ATD's head and upper torso displaced laterally toward the front left window and door. As the vehicle began the roll initiation phase, the ATD's lower torso moved off the seat as the upper torso continued to translate laterally until it contacted the left front door trim at approximately 130ms. The ATD's head continued to translate laterally until it contacted the front left window pane at approximately 160ms. As the vehicle transitioned to the free- flight rotation phase, the ATD's head and torso translated inboard toward the passenger and the upper interior of the vehicle, as the vehicle experienced the free-flight rotation phase, the ATD's head continued to move vertically, relative to its initial position, until making contact with the upper interior of the vehicle. During the vehicles ground contact phase, the ATD's head remained in contact with the upper interior of the vehicle as its torso moved toward the upper interior of the vehicle resulting in visible ATD neck compression. bl Baseline Hybrid III 50lh%l8 Driver Standing Pelvis As shown in Figure 13, the overall kinematics of the Hybrid III 50th%le standing pelvis driver ATD' were very similar to that of the ATD fitted with the seated pelvis. The head of the ATD fitted with the standing (pedestrian) pelvis contacted the window plane at approximately the same, 160ms, as the ATD fitted with the seated pelvis. Both ATD heads contacted the upper interior of the vehicle during the free flight phase. During the ground contact phase, both ATDs torsos translated toward the upper interior of the vehicle visible compressing the ATD's neck. c) Baseline Passenger - Hybrid 50th%le Seated Pelvis The baseline Hybrid III 50th%le passenger kinematics, shown in Figure 14, is obviously significantly different than that of the driver, shown in Figure 12. During the trip and roll initiation phase, the passenger's lower torso displaced from the seat as its upper torso and head translated laterally in-board toward the driver, away from the seat belt d-ring. For this test, the seat belt began to slide off the ATD's shoulder at approximately 1 20ms and in contact with the ATD's upper arm at approximately 200ms. Unlike the driver, whose lateral motion is confined by the left front door and window, the passenger was able to translate laterally in- board a relatively greater amount. As the vehicle transitions from roll initiation phase to free-flight, the passenger reversed its motion and translated towards the right front door and window until approximately 500ms when the ATD's upper torso made contact with the right door trim. During the free- flight phase the ATD continued to translate toward the upper interior of the vehicle until its head reached a position near the intersection of the window pane, B-pillar and roof rail. The ATDs head remained in this position until the ground contact phase began. During the ground contact phase, the rapid deceleration of the vehicle caused the ATD's torso to move relative to the passenger seat toward the upper interior of the vehicle visibly compressing its neck. c) Baseline Driver - Hybrid III 5lh%le The baseline Hybrid III 5th%le driver kinematics are shown in Figure 15. Although, the smaller ATD experienced greater relative motion compared to the Hybrid III 50th%, it exhibited similar kinematics during each phase of the event. Because of its size and seating position the location and timing of its contact with the interior of the vehicle were noticeably different. For example, the 5th%le ATD's head contacts the window pane at approximately 180ms, nearly 20ms later than the Hybrid III 50th. During the ground contact phase, the 5th%le ATD's head and torso moved toward the upper interior of the vehicle making contact at approximately 930ms. d) Baseline Passenger - Hybrid III 95th%le The baseline passenger Hybrid III 95th%le ATD kinematics are shown in Figure 1 6, Compared to the 50th%le, the larger 95th%le ATD exhibited less relative lateral and vertical head and torso movement. The seat belt remained on the 95th%le ATD's shoulder for the duration of the event. However, as did the 544</page><page sequence="12">50th%le, the 95th%le ATD's head contacted the upper interior of the vehicle during the free flight phase. During the ground contact phase, the head remained in contact with the upper interior of the vehicle while the torso displaced towards the upper interior of the vehicle, visibly compressing the 95th%le ATD's neck.

In fact, only three tests (2, 5 and 14) were able to alter the ATD head kinematics enough, relative to baseline, for it to be observed in the on-board video images. However, in these tests, the differences in occupant kinematics were confined mainly to the free flight rotation phase. None of the pre-tensioning devices or activation times were able to prevent the 5th%le 50th%le and 95,h%le passenger or the 50th%le and 95th%le driver ATD's from contacting the upper interior of the vehicle. Seat Belt Loads Table 4 displays peak seat belt loads recorded for the lap, shoulder and retractor portion of the belts. In a majority of the tests, the lap belt loads exceeded those recorded on the belts near the shoulder and retractor.

The software measured the relative head displacements by tracking a target fixed to the ATD's head. In some cases the motion of the ATD within the vehicle environment prevented the tracking software from monitoring the head target for the entire duration of the event. This happened numerous times in tests involving the 50 %le passenger. For this paper, the driver positive lateral displacements are defined as moving outboard toward the window and positive vertical displacements are moving toward the upper interior of the vehicle. The displacement of each ATD's pelvis relative to its seat was measured by attaching a string-potentiometer (string-pot) cable to the bottom of the ATD's pelvis that passed through a large hole in each seat to the potentiometer mounted on the vehicle floor pan. Therefore, as the pelvis moved relative to its initial position, the string-pot measured the amount of pelvis displacement. The maximum amount of Hybrid III 50,h%le (with seat pelvis) driver ATD lateral head displacement during the trip/roll initiation and free flight rotation phases is shown in Figure 17. The maximum amount of vertical head excursion for the 50th %le driver ATDs during the free flight and ground contact phases are shown in Figure 18. Similarly the head displacements 547</page><page sequence="15">for the passenger and other ATD sizes and types are shown in Figures 19-27. The figures display only the test configurations for which the software was able to track the lateral and vertical displacements of the head for the critical phases of event. Figure 28 illustrates the maximum 50th driver pelvis displacement and resultant head displacements for each test. The maximum resultant ATD head displacement relative to the maximum pelvis displacement during the free flight and ground impact phases is shown in Figure 29. Figure 30 compares the measured vehicle lateral acceleration to the dynamic driver pelvis displacement for the baseline test. The lateral vehicle acceleration is the measured vehicle response to the tripping forces applied by the DRS. From this plot, it is apparent that the driver pelvis motion is preceded by the vehicle lateral acceleration.

It would be nearly impossible to isolate, identify and quantify the variability and effect each factor may have. However, one goal of this study was to identify and quantify the amount of variability associated with the vehicle responses generated by the ROCS. Because vehicle rollover testing produces a dynamic event that involves four distinct phases, each associated with unique vehicle responses, it is difficult to numerically assess the ability of a test device to produce repeatable results throughout the event. Therefore for lack of a better metric, the average free-flight roll rate generated by each tests was compared. The results shown in Figures 10 and 11 indicate the ROCS system was able to produce average free flight roll rates within a range +/-3.5 %. Hence, the test method was able to consistently generate vehicle roll rates in all 15 tests reasonably well. The vehicle signals generated by the ROCS were compared to those generated by an actual vehicle subjected to a curb trip test. These test results were chosen as a comparator because of the similarity of the vehicle geometry, test speeds and lateral decelerations. Although the test environment and vehicles are not identical, a comparison is still useful as it provides a context for the data generated in this study. Overall the ROCS system was able to replicate the key vehicle responses for the trip, roll and free-flight phases of the full vehicle curb trip test reasonably well, as shown in Figures 6 - 9. Obviously, a major difference between the curb trip test vehicle and the ROCS is the ROCS system structure does not deform and absorb energy. This fact most likely resulted in more of the energy generated by the vehicle-to-ground impact transferred to the occupants and restraint system in the ROCS system. In this study, the ROCS system was used primarily to help understand the effects of activating a pyro-mechanical pretensioner and/or an electric retractor at various times during the event on relative ATD head displacements. The data generated from this 555</page><page sequence="23">study, shown in Figures 12-25, indicate that neither device was able to limit the passenger ATD's motion in such a way as to prevent its head from contacting the upper interior of the vehicle. Also, neither device was able to prevent the 50th and 95th driver ATD's from contacting the upper interior of the vehicle during the ground contact phase. Furthermore, neither device was able to limit the outboard lateral motion of the driver or passenger ATD's into their respective front window panes during the trip and roll initiation phases. However, the data, shown in Figures 1 8 and 28, suggests the amount of relative pelvis and vertical head displacements experienced by the driver ATD's during the free-flight phase may be influenced by early activation (t &lt; 70ms) of the two pretensioning devices. Early activation appeared to result in approximately a 25mm (1 inch) difference, compared to the baseline, in vertical head and resultant pelvis displacement during the free flight phases of the event. However, activation times this early in the rollover event are unattainable with currently available sensor system technology. The ability of the pre-tensioning devices to influence the 50,h%le passenger ATD's head displacements can be seen in Figures 19 and 20. From the figures it appears the earlier the devices are activated the more they are able to reduce the amount of relative free-flight vertical head displacements. Though, this fact appears to have no correlation to the amount of vertical ATD head displacement measured during the ground impact phase. Since all passenger ATDs contacted the upper interior of the vehicle, the magnitude of the peak relative vertical displacement is a reflection of the upper interior shape of the vehicle and the location of ATD contact point. From Figure 19 it appears the pre-tensioning devices had minimal impact on the amount of peak lateral displacement for the passenger ATDs. In fact, some of the largest peak lateral displacements were recorded for tests with both the buckle pre-tensioner and the electric retractor activated. Figures 21 and 22 display lateral and vertical relative head displacements for the four types of driver ATD's used in this study with a buckle pre-tensioner activated at 130ms. The plots indicate the 95,h%le ATD experienced the least amount of relative lateral head displacement during the free-flight and roll initiation phase. While the 50th%le ATD with seated pelvis experienced the most. Clearly the 5,h%le ATD experienced the lowest relative vertical head displacements during the free flight phase. With the exception of the 5th%le, all ATDs contacted the upper interior of the vehicle. A comparison of the peak relative vertical head displacements for the two Hybrid III 50th pelvis types is shown in Figure 23. From the figure, it is apparent the seated pelvis experiences a relative head displacement, approximately 15mm (0.6 inch), with respect to the standing pelvis when the pretensioner was activated at 130ms. However, when the pre- tensioner was not activated the standing pelvis ATD experienced a vertical displacement, approximately 28 mm (1.1 inch) relative to the seated pelvis during the free-flight phase. Both ATDs contacted the upper interior of the vehicle. Figure 24 reveals the relative lateral head displacements for the Hybrid III 5th driver with buckle pre-tensioner activated at 130ms exceed the baseline by approximately 49mm (1 .9 inch). From Figure 25 it can be seem that activation of the buckle pre-tensioner at 130ms limited the relative vertical head displacement of the 5th%le Driver ATD to be approximately 40 mm (1.6 inches) less than the baseline during the free-flight and ground contact phases. However, the same activation time was not able to prevent any passenger ATDs from contacting the upper interior of the vehicle. Figures 26 - 27 display the relative lateral and vertical head displacements for the 95th passenger. The data indicates the pre- tensioner has a small effect (approximately 10mm or .4inch) on relative lateral head displacements during the free flight phase. During the same phase the relative vertical head displacements actually increased with the pre- tensioner by approximately 40mm (1.6 inch). In both tests the ATDs head contacted the upper interior of the vehicle. An analysis of the baseline vehicle and 50th%le ATD driver responses yields a possible explanation of why early activation of the two devices has a noticeable effect on driver ATD kinematics during the free flight phase. Figure 30 indicates the driver ATD pelvis moved significantly from its initial position (approx 43 mm) in a relatively short time following the lateral deceleration generated by the tripping force applied to the vehicle. During this same time interval, the passenger's lap belt load increases significantly (see Figure 5) despite its pelvis moving a relatively smaller amount than the driver. Thus, a pretensioning device activated after the application of a tripping force must be 556</page><page sequence="24">able to apply sufficient force in order to reposition the ATD's pelvis and torso and overcome the forces present in the belt system before it can influence driver ATD kinematics in subsequent phases of the event. Higher belt forces and pelvis displacements present a greater challenge to the pre-tensioning system. Figure 28 illustrates the maximum resultant head and pelvis displacements for the 50th%le seated pelvis drivers during the ground contact phase. As can be seen in Figure 28 the range of maximum resultant head displacements varied from approximately 196mm (7.7inch) to 227mm (8.9inch) for all tests. This range was influenced by the fact all ATDs shown contacted the upper interior of the vehicle. The maximum pelvis displacements, however, varied from approximately 28mm (1.1 inch) to 73mm (2.9 inch) as a function of pretensioner activation time. The data appears to indicate that even if the pelvis is limited to a mere 25.4mm (1 inch) of displacement, the ATD head is still able to displace nearly 200mm (8 inches) and contact the vehicle upper interior. Figure 29, shows the difference in resultant head and pelvis displacements. Based the data generated in this study, one would expect that if a pre-tensioning device is able to generate a force sufficient to remove seat belt slack before the occupant moves and loads the belt, the belt system would most likely have a better ability to affect occupant excursion during the free flight phase. The specific activation times needed to achieve this effect though depend on numerous factors: the type of pre-tensioning device, the vehicle geometry, tripping force, vehicle lateral speed, the duration of each phase of the event as well as ATD position. For example, the electric retractor and pyro-mechanical buckle pretensioner differ in the sense that it takes a relatively longer time for the electric retractor to generate a force in the belt system. The retractor requires additional time for the electric motor to reel in the belt webbing and generate a force. Thus, the tension generated by its motor must be timed to coincide with a low level of belt loads, which likely means it must be activated before the tripping phase to be most effective. However, limiting occupant vertical excursion during the free-flight phase did not necessarily prevent the ATD's head from contacting the upper interior of the vehicle during the ground contact phase. In this study the ROC system essentially is a rigid body representation of a given vehicle. This allows for the system to be re-usable and ensures consistent vehicle to ground contact characteristics. Consequently, any energy absorbed by a similar non-rigid vehicle during the ground contact phase is not considered. As in other crash modes, impact energy absorbed by structural deformations plays an important role in determining the decelerations experienced by the occupant. CONCLUSIONS The ROCS system was able to consistently generate vehicle roll rates in all 15 tests and replicate the key vehicle responses for the trip, roll and free-flight phases of the full vehicle curb trip test reasonably well. The ability of the seat belt pre-tensioning devices used in this study to reduce vertical ATD excursions was limited primarily to the free-flight rotation phase of the rollover event. This ability to alter ATD kinematics was affected by the amount of force present in the seat belt system, the amount of pelvis displacement present and the force applied by the device at the time of activation. However, results indicated that neither of the pre-tensioning devices was able to prevent all of the driver and passenger ATDs from contacting the upper interior of the vehicle during the ground contact phase. Based on the data generated in this study, it is apparent that in order to reduce relative occupant vertical head displacements during the free-flight phase, the pre-tensioning devices must be activated prior to the vehicles roll initiation phase. However, such activation times are unrealistic and unattainable with technology currently available. Rollover events are complex, dynamic events and numerous factors may have an effect on occupant kinematics. Therefore, it is imperative to study restraint systems in an environment as representative as possible. 557</page><page sequence="25">REFERENCES 1) Dang, J., (2004) "Preliminary Results Analyzing Effectiveness of Electronic Stability Control (ESC) Systems", September 2004, DOT HS 809 790. 2) Farmer, C., (2004) "Effect of Stability Control on Automobile Crash Risk", Traffic Injury Prevention, 5:317 - 325. 3) NHTSA, Safercar Web Portal http://www.safercar.gov/paaes/ESC- EauippedVehicles-2007.html 4) Huges, R, Lewis, L., Hare, B., Ishikawa, Y., Iwasaki, K.,Tsukaguchi, K., and Doi, N., (2002) "A Dynamic Test Procedure for Evaluation of Tripped Rollover Crashes", SAE Paper No. 2002-01-0693. 5) Chou, C., McCoy, R., and Le, J., (2005) "A Literature Review of Rollover Test Methodologies", International Journal of Vehicle Safety, Volume 1, Numbers 1/2/3, pp 200-237. 6) Newberry, W., Lai, W., Carhart, M., Richards, D., Brown, J. and Raasch, C., 11) Sword, M., (2006) "NHTSA Research on Improved Restraints in Rollover", presented at the SAE/Government Industry Meeting May 8-10, 2006. 13) Performance With and Without Seat Belt Pretensioner at Vehicle Trip", SAE Paper No. 2002-01-0941. 14) McCoy, R. and Balavich, K., (2005) "Analysis of a Prototype Electric Retractor Seat Belt Pretensioning Device and Dummy Lateral Motion Prior to Vehicle Rollover", SAE Paper No. 2005-01-0945. 15) Bostrom, O., Haland, Y. and Sonderstrom, P.
