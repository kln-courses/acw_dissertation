<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alfred Neumeyer Die Kunst in unserer Zeit: Versuch einer Deutung, 175 pp., 37 ill. Stuttgart: Henry Goverts Verlag, 1961. 25 DM. The market is swamped with introductions to modern art, most of which platitudinize on slight variations of the same weary colorplates. Their pretentious format does not make up for lack of original research and reflective thought. Or, instead of the popularizations, the reader is offered unreadable esoteric eulogies (one essay on a fairly talented young artist in a re- cent issue of Art International concluded: "C . . . was visited by the gods"), or hostile pronouncements by individuals who, having set themselves up as keepers of public esthetic morality, squander their energies in rude at- tacks on contemporary art. In certain aspects Dr. Neumeyer's book is an answer to Hans Sedllmayer's Verlust der Mitte, perhaps the most noted recent book by an advocate of "san- ity in art." Professor Neumeyer approaches modern art with understanding and humility. He con- sistently asks the most relevant questions and frequently arrives at significant and convinc- ing answers. This reviewer feels that it is a lively and at times profound attempt at inter- preting twentieth century art. The book is divided into three parts, one each devoted to architecture, sculpture and painting. In the chapter on architecture, Neu- meyer comes to grips with essential aspects: for instance, the dynamic composition of space enclosure, characterized by lightness, open- ness, irregularity and dematerialization. The extrovert mobility of modern civilization has incorporated the road into its plan, much in the same manner that stairs belong to the tra- ditional house. The building today is no longer a solid expression of personal power, but has become open and transparent so as to welcome nature, light and air, as well as informal human contact. The articulation of space, so essential to modern architecture, also differentiates mod- ern sculpture from the sculpture of the past. The author also stresses the basic observation that the rejection of imitation was a necessary condition for the renaissance in contemporary sculpture. His discussion of the nature of ab- straction, of the sculptor's relationship to his material and his observations on fear, anxiety, and loneliness as important themes are all perspicacious. But his contribution, above all, is his analysis of the two major trends in modern sculpture: the tendency which stresses the active expression of the artist's vitality, and the more objective, geometric direction which has created new esthetic formulations for light, movement and infinity. In the chapter on painting which occupies half the book, Neumeyer traditionally sees the beginning of modernity in the liberation of the work of art from the representation of na- ture by Gauguin, Van Gogh, Seurat and Ce- zanne. The "it is" of five centuries of natural- ism is replaced by the "I am" of the modern artist. Neumeyer's insights lead him to see that the apparently geometric rationalism of the Cubists had, from its very beginnings, the seeds of free and non-rational fantasy, that Futurism did not merely glorify technology but is actually based on a need for inner dishar- mony, that the element of uncertainty is basic to modern art in general and abstract art in partic- ular, that the great danger for non-objective art is a lack or poverty of material, content, con- cept and idea, but that "freedom and human dignity are-and this may appear paradoxical -today retained solely in an art which rejects its dependence on verisimilitude." There seem to be occasional errors and mat- ters of misinterpretation: This reviewer dis- agrees with the author, who considers Rodin and Hildebrand the only significant sculptors of the nineteenth century. One wonders why Daumier, Degas and Rosso are disregarded. Or why is that extraordinary integration of all the arts in Art Nouveau overlooked when the author maintains that the Bauhaus brought about a fusion of the arts as it had not occurred since the Baroque? It must be pointed out also that cubist sculpture originates with Picasso's "Woman's Head" of 1909 and not with Archi- penko's concave sculptures of a few years la- ter, that it is erroneous to refer to Marc and Macke as Munich members of the Briicke, and that the term, Orphism, was coined by Apolli- naire and not Delaunay. Nevertheless, this is a brilliantly written es- say which, moreover, is fortunately not im- paired by that provincial type of chauvinism- either pro School of Paris, or pro School of New York-which seems to occur in almost all recently published chronicles of contempo- rary art. The author's perceptions are, in fact, often extremely keen and his formulations so succinct and memorable that it seems worth while to acquaint the reader with a few ex- amples: "Matisse's great effect is caused by the si- multaneous vision of elements which had here- tofore been separated: the special recession of objects becomes an adjacency of color planes." "Giacometti's sculptures deal with a world anxiety, the experience of being left in infinite nothingness. Here Pascal's diary entry is ap- plicable: 'the silence of infinite rooms seizes me with fear.'" "In Gorky one finds the freest and most au- tonomous use of forms which have an almost anthropomorphic vitality. The forms grow, sprout out, fly, yes, sometimes they seem to smile or to scream." On geometric abstraction: "The play with geometric forms has developed further (after the Bauhaus) but its eloquence has become ex- tinguished as its effect has been taken over by applied art and architecture. A further discussion of its current representatives would add nothing new." On Surrealism and Dali: "The theory of Surrealism points to its discoveries in the realm of the unconscious. ... But if one looks at the pictures of the Surrealists one finds noth- ing in their form of the multiple layers of the unconscious, so difficult to unravel, but quite to the contrary the super-definition of the dream which only a non-dreamer is able to represent. ... Surrealism is much less an art of the unconscious than the work of Klee and Kandinsky.. ... The lack of real commitment (on the part of Dali) has left only a vacuous sensationalism, and Dali's late religious paint- ings which today hang in the Metropolitan Museum in New York and the National Gal- lery in Washington will some day be in the stor- age bins next to Bouguereau and Alma Ta- dema." "In non-objective art rests the creative vital- ity of a time, and its vision will become the convention of a later period. Its esthetic lim- itlessness corresponds to the flowing, infinite world-concept of modern man." Altogether this is a splendid book, filled with insights into modern art and challenges about its interpretation. Except for the handsome but not very legible sans-serif type, it is beauti- fully designed by Roland Hinssel, who has cre- ated one of the finest jackets in years. The black and white illustrations are well selected and superbly printed. An American edition would be most desirable for the lover and student of modern art. PETER SELZ The Museum of Modern Art Bates Lowry The Visual Experience: An Introduction to Art, 272 pp., 235 ill. (16 in color). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall; New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1961. $6.95. Professor Lowry's new book is that com- paratively rare wonder: a text both sensitively written and laid out. Its epochal nature may be indicated briefly by suggesting that it is anal- agous to the by now classic Brooks and War- ren Understanding Poetry. It is more per- fectly adapted-to one-semester use, in that the visual experience is covered in just sixteen chapters. "Covered" is of course not the adequate ad- jective, save for lazy students who bring to their degree nothing but the desire to get it. The Visual Experience will not long encourage this attitude. One delighted teacher has already well phrased Dr. Lowry's approach: he extends a hand to the reader, but once grasped, keeps him running faster and faster-consult, for instance, pp. 33-35, devoted to the Bellini (Car- paccio?) Flight into Egypt in our National Gallery. A glance at the treatment and analysis of this Flight should reveal the unique approach rightly stressed by the publishers, and by Dr. Lowry in his preface. Half of page 33 repro- duced the Flight in its entirety. More than half of the two succeeding pages are devoted to details of the static Virgin side-saddled, and the active Joseph leading. All but the most sluggish readers are led from a purely formal to a philosophical interpretation, ineluctably, but with no sense of the author's pushing or insisting. This is what I have termed above "sensitive writing"-courteous, undoctrinaire. Sensitive layout enables the student to run faster without stumbling, for the text and over two hundred black and white pictures are always visible at the same time. The prov- ing exception to the rule is the four groups of sixteen good color plates. One of these, the El Greco Espolio in the Cathedral of Toledo, may be cited as an outstandingly penetrating analysis of the effect on the beholder of the Cretan's knowledge of the expressive power of color.
