<plain_text><page sequence="1">Whose Track Is It? By Richard Headstrom. Ives Washburn, Inc., New York. 1971. 141pp. $5.95. The dust jacket states that this book is "A field guide and introduction to the identification of animal tracks found in the area east of the Mississippi,... . ." As a field guide it is adequate at best. It is too big for even a large pocket, and the arrangement of notes and keys is awkward to use since the keys often rely on notes a dozen pages away. The basic device for separating tracks is the linear measurement in inches. Di- visions are run as low as 1/s inch. It would indeed be interesting for the initiate to differentiate be- tween an adult gray squirrel and a second litter young fox squirrel where the tracks were mea- sured with a ruler on the first fall of snow. Little emphasis is given to track size variation (p. 4) as a function of sex and age, or the degree to which such variation may affect the measurements during the seasons of the year. The note section that follows the various keys has some good field information but at the same time denies the reader data that would be en- lightening regarding behavior, anatomy, etc. State- ments are made with no explanation to answer the question why? For example, (p. 27) "Al- though the mink has five toes, only four register in the print"; and (p. 43) "Occasionally the reticulated imprint of the shell becomes part of the armadillo's track." The notes on the tracks of birds contain some odd verbiage. Thus the coot is regarded as having ". . . a somewhat silly look on its face" or ". the flicker is the only one [woodpecker] apt to be seen on the ground." Giving birds derogatory, anthropomorphic descriptions adds nothing to the study of tracks, and in the Midwest the red- headed woodpecker frequently feeds on insects on roads. Road-killed red-headed woodpeckers attest to this feeding habit. The notes on the print of the pelican state: "Its print is similar to that of the cormorant but larger." If one checks the notes on the cormorant it reads: "Its print is somewhat similar to that of the pelican except that it is smaller." The ring-necked pheasant is said to have been ". . imported from Europe." Many of them may have been imported from Europe but it is an oriental species and the first large-scale imports came from China. J. Wildl.

The format of the book is good as is the paper quality. There is, however, generous use of blank space. The prechapter section covers 17 pages. The remainder of the book is divided into five parts and three appendices plus a two and one-half page index by species. The 52 black-and-white "plates" are reasonably good diagrammatic draw- ings of tracks and single footprints. This section is the best part of the book. Although this publication doubtless contributes to the understanding of animal tracks, I agree fully with the author's own assessment when he says that the book ". . . does not presume to be the definitive work on animal tracks . . . ." There are no references to publications on tracks by other writers such as Murie, Jaeger, Mason, Brunner, Seton, etc. I do not recommend this as the most useful book on the subject. Olaus J. Murie's A Field Guide to Animal Tracks (Houghton-Mifflin Co., 1954) is still by far the most informative and useful reference on animal tracks and field sign.-ROBERT A.
