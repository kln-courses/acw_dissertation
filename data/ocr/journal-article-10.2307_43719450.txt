Eléments pour une théologie lucanienne de la mission (MDL; Geneva: Labor et Fides, 1987). Pp. 226. Paper N.P. In recent years, much of NT scholarship has concentrated upon the relationship between Judaism and Christianity. In this Fribourg thesis, written under Bernard- Yves Tťemel, Wildhaber uses the tools of contemporary scholarship to address an earlier agenda: the intersection of Christianity and paganism. In the first of three parts, W. surveys the general religious context of the Roman world. With Pliny the Elder as his guide, W. notes the tiredness and cynicism which the traditional religions engendered in the cultivated public. Their renewal by Au- gustus produced a façade. At best, the imperial cult commanded a doubtful allegiance in the masses. But behind the façade lay a background of vibrant oriental paganism and astrology. Luke sensed the danger inherent in these "spiritual drugs" which offered escape from oppression through ecstasy and sensual sentimentality. Wildhaber then selects eight episodes from Acts which show the confrontation between Christianity and pagan belief: Simon Magus, the death of Herod, the conflict in Cyprus, the disturbance at Lystra, the prophetess at Philippi, the exorcists at Ephesus, the problem of Artemis at Ephesus, and the miracles on Malta. W. ap- proaches each passage in the same fashion: first, the wider literary context in Acts, then its structure. After brief exegetical comments, he draws out the theological thrust and writes some concluding remarks. In part 3, W. notes that Luke does not offer a complete picture of paganism. Rather, he presents a series of cameos. Nor does Luke mount a detailed polemic, in marked contrast to the later vehement apologetic of a Te rtu 11 i an. Luke's approach is both irenic and ironic. For example, the indictment of paganism contained in the Areopagus speech is mild in that Luke has Paul attack the anthropomorphism rather</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 341 than the polytheism of the Athenians. Risky though it is, paganism has served a past function in the economy of salvation. Luke also avoids difficult questions about the military career of Cornelius; any attack upon the imperial power is oblique. Against the skepticism of Haenchen and others, W. sees a remarkable conver- gence between the Paul of Acts and the Paul of Romans. Although the nuances differ markedly, in the essential points Paul and Luke are very close. The book has many useful reminders. Three examples must suffice. The Simon Magus episode shows that the gospel is not for sale and any trafficking for profit is excluded. "Wonders" do not point to the preacher but to Christ. For Luke, wonders are to be mere auxiliaries to the word of grace. Second, Acts 13:4-12 shows that Luke's method was not so much to destroy paganism as to discredit it and make it suspect in the eyes of Rome while demonstrating that Christians are exemplary citi- zens who deserve benevolent neutrality. Third, there is a profound incompatibility between Luke's understanding of wonders and "a tradition penetrated by magic." Wildhaber has little time for historical reconstruction of the underlying events. Rather, Luke knowingly transposes the historical events to the plane of religious ideology. Indeed, Luke's historical writing compares favorably with the other ancient models of historical writing. In this valuable study, W. has demonstrated the degree to which Luke is not only conscious of but in dialogue with the pagan religious culture of the late first century. Luke's avoidance of overt criticism of the imperial power is already well-known. Now, W. has shown that Luke also takes a rather more nuanced approach to popular paganism than we sometimes think. Wildhaber quite rightly focuses on the theological intent of Luke's way of writ- ing his narrative, but at the same time he argues that Luke treats paganism briefly but accurately within the bounds of his purpose. From readers more convinced by the Bruce-Marshall-Barrett approach than the Haenchen-Conzelmann-Dibelius ap- proach to Acts, this book will receive high marks. Kent E.
