Picturing the Beast enters the intellectual terrain populated in the last few decades by the numerous theo- retical efforts at decentering the human subject and a recentering of "otherness" including more recent injunc- tions for a progressive cultural politics to accompany such gestures. Baker moves with skill among ideas such as the "constructedness" of identity, the operations of power found in the rhetoric of the image, and the plea- sures experienced in the consumption of popular repre- sentations, all of which are applied to his study of signifying capacity of the animal. Baker's project is unique among recent efforts not only because his subject matter broaches the issue of human identity through the "archetypal cultural 'other,"' of the animal, but also because he provides a complex, demystifying analysis of the uses of animal representations in culture from a contemporary Western perspective including an impor- tant discussion of the strategic possibilities for repre- senting animal rights. Central to Baker's critique is the emphasis placed on the visual-a reading of images informed by post-structuralism. Baker's arguments are therefore tied to innumerable examples, which are culled from mostly British and U.S. sources, with a culturally contingent reading that relies on an analysis of both word and image. Baker begins by sketching a conception of the animal in cultural terms, a way of thinking about animals in the popular imagination that relies upon the visual as a way into the myth-making or naturalization process of animals in culture. Baker locates a contempo- rary mentalite of the animal, not necessarily predicated on a progressive historical past, but in the formations of meanings circulating in the "space of representation" in popular culture. It is the symbolic uses of the animal in this space of representation to which Baker attends, focusing, for example, on the stereotype as the means by which individuals receive commonsensible ideas about animals that define their attitudes toward them. As one way of thinking about animals in popular culture, Baker examines the use of animals as symbols for a nation, their capacity for national identification and their "iconography of power." Baker undercuts the received idea that an animal may simply "stand for" a nation by showing that the relationship between the chosen animal and its connotations for a given country are not fixed and therefore are available for use. Surveying a range of World War propaganda and contemporary political posters as well as editorial cartoons, Baker is able to demonstrate how animal symbols can be used to convey ideas that are alternate and oppositional to the preferred meaning. It is the struggle for rhetorical control over the negative connotations of the animal-as-beast which is the subject of Baker's analysis-particularly as evidenced in political cartoons. Through such discussions of the "rhetoric of animality" Baker introduces two terms with which to distinguish the representational relationship of humans to animals: "A theriomorphic image would be one in which someone or something (in the words of the OED definition) was presented as 'having the form of the beast.' Therianthropic images, in contrast, would be those 'combining the form of the beast with that of a man."' [108] These terms differ from anthropomorphism which is the reverse condition of depciting, for example, animals with human forms and characteristics. The advantages and disadvantages of each representational procedure are also distinct for Baker, who concludes: "In other words, we tend to represent ourselves as wholly animal, but others as only half-animal." [108] The frequent therianthropic depiction of others as subhu- man, usually half-human, half-ape therefore not fully evolved in Darwinian terms, tends to confirm such conclusions. In binary oppositions of the human/ animal dichotomy, Baker argues, the latter term of the pair will be cast as the negative one. A second and quite different way of thinking about animals in culture emerges in Baker's discussion of the pleasure people take in their relationship to animal representations in popular narratives such as the Ruppert Bear serial or in the holocaust stories of Maus. In these representations we encounter the anthropomorphism of the talking-animal. Baker's approach to this particular kind of representation is found in the "interstitial" state of characters such as Ruppert Bear who is "a boy who just happens to look like a bear." Baker searches for the small breakdowns in the narrative, moments which tend to complicate the talking-animal's identity. For Baker this recognition happens most clearly when these talking- animals confront "real" animals in the narrative. Their interstitial identity is thrown into question and requires a disavowal and distancing of the character from "real" animals often with expressions of terror. The evidence of this breakdown in identity is to be found most strikingly in the visual. Baker demonstrates this in the case of Ruppert Bear by reference to how Ruppert and others in his world are visibly depicted, underscoring the impor- tance of the visual in establishing identity. In the partic- 70 Design Issues: Volume 12, Number 1 Spring 1996</page><page sequence="2">ular case of Ruppert and other interstitial characters of the serial it is the very unmarked nature of their bodies-the fact they are left unshaded or "white"-that establishes their identity as distinct from both humans and proper animals. The graphic device of whiteness establishes and maintains narrative order throughout the stories. Again Baker relies on the visual-here the illus- tration (which he likens to Derrida's notion of the supplement) as a gap or blind spot in an otherwise self- contained world of the text. This exposed gap reveals a denial of the animal ("a boy who is not a bear") as a significant aspect of the talking-animal genre, but a necessary part of the graphic system used to sustain it ("a boy who looks like a bear"). Baker confronts the popularity of such narratives as evidence of the pleasure they bring to their readers. Baker locates this readerly pleasure in the talking-animal genre when the narrative world is read through its animal likeness for its human experiences. However, it is in the narratives of animal revenge where the tables are turned on humans that one could read for a pleasure with animals that ironically subjects humans to the whims of animals. The popular media uses of the signifying capacity of the animal operate within a system of representation governed by its own often contradictory logic. This realm is under the influence of commonsensible under- standings of reality that appear to be given or "natural," but are instead culturally constructed. The very "logic" of such a commonsense system is that it allows for and otherwise absorbs contradictions. Baker identifies such representational contradictions of the animal, for exam- ple, in the signs found in butcher shops that advertise today's meat specials in the form of a cow or a pig; sometimes announcing its own demise, sometimes appearing glad to have escaped it. Searching for a term with which to describe more precisely the stereotypical results of animal depictions, the accompanying trivial- ization of the animal's significance and the sense of contradiction embodied in such representations, Baker suggests a concept he terms "disnification." Baker applies this term to the specific dynamics of the visual representation, which "seems somehow to incline towards the stereotypical and the stupid, to float free from the requirements of consistency or of the greater rigour that might apply in other non-visual contexts." [175] Rid of the burdens of a rigorous or truthful logic, the "disnified" image is free to gain its (common)sensi- bilities in a receptive public who negotiate contradictions and create their own sense. Our understanding of animals is mediated by the representations we give to them. Humans both define and depict animals in this process and frequently have as their goal not a greater knowledge of animals but a better understanding of themselves as human. Given the fact the we can only know of animals in such mediated terms, Baker turns to the strategic use of animal repre- sentations to work on behalf of animals. In the conclud- ing section of his book, Baker begins to sketch some representational possibilities informed by an analysis of the media portrayls of animal rights groups and those groups' visual rhetoric. The more obvious representa- tional strategy which calls for a "positive image of the animal and how it should be depicted" is the first line of criticism for Baker. The positive-image genre is, for Baker, one which is already known or prescribed by its adherence to the beautiful nature photograph: real animals depicted in their natural habitats. The problem- atic nature of such depictions is elaborated by Baker: "Generally speaking, the reality which the positive image purports to depict is nothing more than an aestheticized and romanticized image of nature; it is reality constructed in conformity to our own aesthetic preferences. Those preferences seem most often to be for an image of the wild which evokes a lost origin-an imaginary edenic state of nature..." [190] Instead of prescribing the visual terms of positive representations Baker offers three counter-examples of representational strategies that seek to subvert the commonsensible and stereotypical, to problematize the kind of cute anthropomorphic imagery the public finds so engaging, and to depict the realities of animal abuse. In attempting to depict the realities of animal abuse Baker advises that the degree of visual reality must be controlled to avoid the problems of graphically render- ing such horrors to the point of stultifying its message by turning off potential readers. In citing an example of a British poster for dog registration, Baker relates its initial design as a photograph of a large pile of dead dogs and its subsequent and published version depicting a single body bag, suggesting a dead dog inside. The case for this approach is made, however, within the context of how graphic images of animal abuse have been successful (e.g., the use of photographs showing animals involved in laboratory experiments). Although Baker offers state- ments to the power of "incomplete" images to resonate with the viewer, it seems like this particular strategy is preferred because it tends not to offend the sensibilities of the general public. Despite the problematic nature of the theri- anthropic image (the human with partial animal form) discussed in a previous chapter, Baker finds a productive use for such imagery when it is used to depict how humans are treated like animals. His example is a poster depicting a young man with a large metal ring piercing his nostrils with the caption "Bullfights would stop if tourists weren't led there." The image works in this example because it is disturbing to see a human treated like an animal, which "opens our own eyes to the reality of an unpictured animal suffering." [author's emphasis, 226] The poster was, however, banned from six airports with flights to Spain with the proviso from an airport director that anti-bullfighting posters would be allowed if they were "not disturbing." The pragmatism guidine Design Issues: Volume 12, Number 1 Spring 1996 71</page><page sequence="3">the choice of indirect depictions of animal abuse discussed above seems not to apply in this case. I suspect that the basis for not picturing animal suffering is bound up in the notion of not objectifying animals, a concept emerging from other fields of representational discourse such as arguments made against "victim photography." Such arguments presuppose the ability of others to represent themselves (something other humans could do) and that the motivations and rewards of repre- senting others lies more with those doing the depicting. Previously we have denied the possibilities of animals somehow representing themselves and have argued that humans must act on behalf of animals. The standard line against the objectification of others does not seem applic- able in this regard since we have already negated the agency of animals and have claimed the right to speak on their behalf. In perhaps his most complicated strategy Baker suggests appropriating and subverting the anthropo- morphism of animals undertaken by operations such as Disney. Baker cites the outrage expressed by furriers over the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians and its "anti-fur message" (through Cruella De Vil's desire for a Dalmatian fur coat). The mass media responded with offense at the attacks on an "innocent" cultural institution like Disney. Of course, the subversive work being done in this example is undertaken by the fur industry itself, digging its own grave so to speak. Baker notes that Disney ultimately gains from this posi- tioning and publicity, but so to, for a time, does the animal rights movement. It is unknown if the anti-fur movement had acted first to claim the Disney movie's message for its own whether it would have enjoyed even this modicum of success and publicity. It seems that the mass media might have been equally offended that anti- fur groups would try to attach their (political) agenda to an "innocent" film or company. The anthropomorphism associated with enterprises such as Disney is instructive as a strategy for Baker because it engages in the trans- mission of messages and experiences for people about a fondness even kindness for animals. Whether illusory or real such a message is out there, available for reinterpre- tation and manipulation. The extent of such subversions remains limited when faced with the formidable cadre of lawyers Disney employs that guards against infringe- ment of its many symbols and icons, including those ubiquitous Mickey Ears, worldwide. The criticisms being made in regard to these three representational strategies should not be understood as nullifying their usefulness, because what Baker is recom- mending, I believe, is a general approach to the prob- lems of representation. In this regard he is to be commended for even tackling the problems of represen- tation at the point of their construction-an action unique among texts of cultural criticism that rely almost exclusively on an ex postfacto critique. Without unduly anthropomorphizing Baker's topic, I found its content to be most revealing in my under- standing of the problems of representation in human cultural terms. I do not wish to obviate the subject of his book, however, since Baker's insights, particularly in regard to the attention he pays to visual evidence in his analyses, relies on the peculiarity and particularity of representations of animals. Baker's ability to bring together such diverse intellectual material and his artic- ulation and elucidation of its points underscores the importance of recent theoretical ideas to inform our discussions of contemporary visual culture. 72 Design Issues: Volume 12, Number 1 Spring 1996</page></plain_text>
