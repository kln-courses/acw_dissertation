BORING, Harvard University What properties would a potato have to have in order to be con- scious? That is a perfectly reasonable question. You can certainly answer it if you know what properties Socrates had to have for Glaucon to believe him conscious, or what properties of mine convince you of my consciousness--if you are convinced. There are, of course, those who will immediately raise the question of reality vs. belief in this instance. It is not, they will say, the same thing for Socrates to be conscious and for Glaucon to believe him conscious, since the belief may be in error. If the potato were endowed with properties that allow it to do what Socrates can do, still the inference to consciousness might be false in the one case and true in the other. It is not certain, these philosophers would say, that the potato and Socrates are both unconscious, or both conscious, even though they act alike. The truth might be that the potato is conscious and Socrates unconscious. If there is a possibility of error, how can one tell? These philosophers I leave to stew in the juices of truth and reality. I do not know what scientific truth and reality are. I do know what scientific inference is, that a fact in science is inferred from data, that scientific objects are rarely directly observable (in a strict sense, being generalizations, they never are), and that scientific truth is a conclusion from an inference, a conclusion that is less than certain but, * Accepted for publication February 13, 1946.

So the potato would be conscious if it acted like Socrates, provided you have never looked inside of either and know only their external behaviors. That is about all there is to physicalism in psychology, to the insistence of the physicalistic psychologists upon operational definitions of mental phenomena. You know about a perception, a thought or a motive in another organism by what the organism does, by the way its muscles move and the conditions under which they move, or the way its glands secrete, or the way its nerves generate differences of electrical potential. In short, you know about the mental capacities of an organism by knowing about the properties of the organism. If we could find a potato that is Socrates' peer in per- formance, then we should have, for all practical purposes, Socrates, and the potato would not be a potato after all but Socrates. In science things are what they do. They are essentially properties. Potential energy exists only as it is known in kinesis. A motive exists only as it is known in its realization. While it is hopeless to attempt to make an actual potato into Socrates, it is not at all hopeless to ask what properties a conscious human being must have in order for him to appear with great certainty to be a conscious human being. Psychologists have been asking this question ever since Descartes in the seventeenth century described animals as automata and La Mettrie a century later in his L'homme machine argued that the same logic could be applied to man. The French objectivists had, however, to fight not merely formal theologi- cal dogma, but mostly a culture permeated by the conception of free- dom of the will and all the related infusions from theological thought. Nowadays we are much freer to do without freedom. Instead of theologists we have to fight merely those mystical psychologists who prefer to use language, trusting blindly its communicating power, and rejecting the demand for operational definitions even when communication falters or proves to be bifurcated. After all that is not much to fight about. The burden of finding operational definitions for ambiguous terms lies, for the most part, upon the operationists, who want the definitions. The operations of observation are always implicit in the statement of a fact, and they can generally be made out. No intelligent scientist ever believes in the existence of a phenomenon</page><page sequence="3">MIND AND MECHANISM 175 without having evidence for his belief, and an operational definition consists only of an analysis of the nature of that evidence. Operationism is not a school or a method. It is a frame of mind. It is a distrust of the use of words without knowing their referents. It is a perpetually unrealized aspiration for rigor of thought. If the operationistic attitude is worth cultivating, it ought to accomplish something worth while. Does it? And what? There are, I think, two advantages that accrue from these modes of thinking. (1) In some cases operational analysis produces greater clarity in the understand- ing of the nature of a problem. (2) In other cases such analysis reveals the fact that the problem is not yet ready for rigorous formu- lation. In either event thinking profits. THE PROBLEM OF PURE HUES: AN EXAMPLE Let me give an example of how operational definition clarifies a problem. It is said that there are four principal hues, Hauptfarben-pure red, pure yellow, pure green and pure blue. Brentano and E. B. Holt thought that there were only three, that green is clearly to introspection a yellow- blue, but most psychologists believe in the four. The wave-lengths corre- sponding to those hues have been worked out, with individual differences which are, however, not large. Pure red is for every normal eye nonspectral; you must mix a little cold light with a great deal of warm light to get pure red. What about pure orange? pure violet? pure purple? pure brown? pure verdigris? pure cerise? pure beige? pure chartreuse? pure periwinkle? pure shocking pink? The question is: are some hues more primary than others, and what do we mean by primary? It seems probable that variability in the selection of pure orange is greater than in the selection of pure yellow, and that the variability for pure periwinkle would be still greater. Such variability is not, however, a satisfactory way of analysing the nature of the chromatic mechanism. It depends in part upon the precision with which different words have acquired their meanings and thus measures something in language as well as in vision. The introspectionists-some of them-used to rely on judgments of complexity or simplicity. If you can see that orange is yellowish red, but can not see that yellow is an orangish yellow-green, then you know that red and yellow are "pure" and that orange and yellow-green are not. Yet</page><page sequence="4">176 BORING observers can disagree on this matter, and there is always to be remem- bered that famous session of the Society of Experimental Psychologists in which Titchener, after hot debate with Holt, exclaimed: "You can see that green is neither yellowish nor bluish!" And Holt replied: "On the contrary, it is obvious that a green is that yellow-blue which is just exactly as blue as it is yellow." That impasse was an ominous portent of the fate of introspection. When two distinguished experts could disagree vis-a-vis about so basic a matter as the nature of hue, some other method of ap- proach was needed. Actually that new conception of the problem was forthcoming from the facts of discriminatory transposition which were being discovered by the Gestalt psychologists. Relative judgments are easy to make and accurate; absolute judgments are difficult and unreliable. You can easily learn to choose the yellower of two oranges, accepting or rejecting a particular orange in accordance with the hue of the other orange with which it is presented and from which it is to be discriminated. If you ask an observer to choose the yellower of two colors, in the oranges he would choose the one that corresponds to a shorter wave-length, but in the yellow-greens he would choose the one corresponding to a longer wave-length. His judgments would converge upon a critical point between the oranges and yellow-greens, and that critical point would be pure yellow, the yellow than which nothing is yellower. To me this formulation of the problem makes it clear. We have got away from the meanings of such dangerous words as simple, pure, complex and mixed as applied to immediately perceived sensory phenomena. An animal that has color vision could have his pure hues determined in the same way, since animals can make discriminations and it is known that transportation in judgments of hue and brightness can be demonstrated in animal subjects. In general, I remark in this connection, that the chief fault of language as a tool for phenomenal description is that it makes use of words. I have no objection to the use of unknown words for descriptive purposes, because such words have to be learned, and the experimenter can then control the learning process and thus put himself into a reasonably favorable position for knowing what it is that the words mean to his subject. But public words, words that have been batted about all through the life-history of the subject who uses them, what can one know certainly about their meanings, acquired and suppressed into the unconscious long before the experiments began? That is why the animal experiments, although so laborious, are so often more rewarding than experiments with human</page><page sequence="5">MIND AND MECHANISM 177 subjects: the experimenter has to teach the animal the language that he must use in order to communicate and the experimenter thus knows the meaning of the code because he himself has made it up and taught it. For instance, the use of conditioning to study sensory discrimination al- ways involves the development of a special code of communication by which the animal can transmit his introspection. In this matter I conceive of myself as supporting the main thesis of B. F. Skinner. Skinner deals with the properties of the empty organism. He ignores, by intelligent intention, the nervous system and all the hy- potheses, speculations and intervening variables with which the skins of most organisms are supposed by psychologists to be stuffed. The properties of an organism are for him and for me simply the ways in which stimulus and response are related, just as the properties of an electronic instrument are the ways in which the electric output is dependent upon the electric input.' AN INVENTORY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS We can now turn to the main endeavor of my paper. I ask you to consider with me the problem of inventorying the psychological functions. I want us to make a list of the psychological properties of the living human organism. The properties are to be expressed objectively in terms of stimulus-response relationships, and the way to keep ourselves clear and to avoid vagueness is to think of the organism as a machine or a robot. We are going to ask ourselves: With what properties must a robot be endowed by its maker in order that it may make discriminations, may react, may learn, may use symbolic processes, may have insight, may describe the nature of its own functions and processes. That, I am convinced, is the way to go at the matter. It is a procedure that keeps us clear. It is also a procedure in accord with the spirit of the times. We have heard so much during the late war about electronic brains. The 'B. F. Skinner, The Behavior of Organisms, 1938, esp. chap. 1; or his original discussion of this matter, The concept of the reflex in the description of behavior, J. Gen. Psychol., 5, 1931, 427-458.

Exper. Psychol., 29, 1941, 390-400, in which anxiety is equated to inhibition of the hunger motive, which is in turn equated to decrease in the frequency of pressings of the food-lever. It is my phrase, not Skinner's that the organism with which he deals is "empty," empty of neurons and almost of intervening variables.</page><page sequence="6">178 BORING electronic computer on a range-finder figures the range and course and speed of a target, setting the fuses and aiming and firing the gun, all at a speed of which the human brain is incapable. There are now huge electronic mathematicians which will solve mathematical prob- lems with a speed and accuracy and lack of fatigue that puts the mere headwork of the human mathematician out of the running.2 This paper had its inception about eighteen months ago in the remark of Professor Norbert Wiener, a distinguished mathematician absorbed in the war's electronic mathematics. He defied me to describe a capacity of the human brain which he could not duplicate with electronic devices. I could not at once name him any, and I confess that I myself thought it would be salutory to show that all human mental functions can have their electronic analogues. I lacked, how- ever, an inventory of the functions and thus could not be sure that there was not some psychological function left over, one which a nervous system could perform and an electronic system could not. It is not necessary, of course, as we play this game, to design ma- chines that are as complicated as the human machine. It is enough for our purpose if we can produce the function in kind and see that complication and differentiation are possible. A simple-minded robot would serve, provided he had all the functions in his mind at a simple level. Given the basic principles, then it should require only a matter of time, patience and continued support from some Foundation to design a bright and attractive dinner companion or eventually even the perfect professor of psychology, who--but let me not depress you by telling you just what the perfect professor would be like. He would need a lot of work done on him, and the early models would doubtless be full of what the mechanic calls bugs. And it would really be enough if we could get the principle of him without actually producing him to compete with us and humiliate us by comparison. Now let us see just what properties a robot needs to make a man of him. Let me number them. I shall try to describe the most general 2 In general, the publication of accounts of the electronic computers, calculators and mathematical problem-solvers has been delayed because the descriptions have been restricted in the interests of security during the war, but see the general dis- cussion of the possibilities of mechanical substitutes for brain processes as given by V.

The test of the list's complete- ness will be the failure of any critic to add to it. I fear there is no other test. (1) Reaction. Reaction is, of course, the basic stuff with which psy- chology deals. An organism is a reactor. When you know how stimulus leads to response, you know the first facts about the psyche. The stimulus- response relationship must, of course, be differential, or specific, or dis- criminative-one of those three words is as good as another. In reaction a particular stimulus leads to a particular response within the limits of toler- ance or generalization. Such relationships are, however, set up quite easily by mechanical or electrical means. A set of door-bells with different push-buttons provides a system of differential reactions, an all-or-none affair without continuity. You can not ring an intermediate bell by pushing in between two buttons. The response of radar to the field which it views is a better analogy, for the radar, like most human reactions, admits of variability and degrees of tolerance. It has sometimes been said that the basic operation in psychology is discrimination, that everything psychological reduces ultimately to dis- crimination.3 That statement is, however, simply another way of saying that reaction is the psychological ultimate, for reaction is the operation by .which discrimination is known, and reaction is not reaction unless it is discriminatory. (2) Attitude. It must never be forgotten that the stimulus-response relationship is not a simple connection but is dependent upon the set of the organism at the time of the reaction. This was one of the great dis- coveries of experimental psychology in the nineteenth century. Many words have been used to describe the principle in question-attitude, set, Einstellung, determining tendency, Aufgabe, instruction, need. All these terms mean that there is a selector mechanism operating, that switching is going on. It is no trouble to find the electrical analogue for switching. When the attitude is externally induced, then we have the case of the machine with selector switches, arranged so that a deus ex machina can turn the knobs, set up a given reaction-system, and predetermine the output for a given input. If one is thinking about the case in which the situation that contains the stimulus seems also to determine the attitude, then one. goes 3 S. S. Stevens, The operational definition of psychological concepts, Psychol. Rev., 42, 1935, 517-527.</page><page sequence="8">180 BORING to the analogy of the automatic telephone exchange where the first reaction is selection, according to the dialed stimulus-number. (3) Transposition. As we have just noted in the case of the pure hues, relative judgments are natural and easy, whereas absolute judgments are difficult or impossible. Transposition is a word that has been applied to the reaction to a relation, as when one responds to a melody in respect of the relation of the notes without regard to their absolute pitches. Von Ehrenfels, an ancestor of Gestalt psychology, called such relations Gestalt- qualiAtiten, establishing the fact of transposition as a basic argument later for Gestalt psychology. L'homme machine must react to a relation if he is to be human. The status of this problem is peculiar. Transposition requires reaction to a gradient or a differential. There is no difficulty at all in arranging a physical system that will react specifically to a gradient, irrespective of the absolute quantities between which the gradient lies, but it has not been easy for psychophysiologists to decide what the neurology of reaction to a relation can be.4 One tends in such a situation to resort to the physics of field theory, applying these physical principles to brain action, simply because it is not clear how neural connectionism can account for what actually happens. In this case the machine man is more plausible as a human being than the live man. (4) Vicarious response. In goal-directed activity the failure to reach the goal by one means leads to the trial of another. The process may be a matter of trial and error, of vicarious trial and error, or of intelligent insight which fails at first because it is imperfect in respect of the actual situation faced. The effectiveness of the goal means that certain equipoten- tial systems are switched into readiness, that the failure of one is the situation that activates the next, that the achievement of the goal opens all the switches and terminates the activity. Progress toward the goal may be by the activation of systems at random, or it may be through an intelligent prepared sequence, as when the means to the goal have been learned and their order of preference predetermined. There is little that will make our robot seem more human than this ability to choose one means after another until the goal is reached. It makes him patient, determined, and, if his systems are well prepared in advance, intelligent. 4K. S.

If the first line is busy, the selector tries the second, running on after each frustration to the next means to its goal. (5) Learning. Learning is, in my opinion, the most instructive of all the functions which we are trying to reduce to the objective properties of a robot, because the reduction is difficult, not admitting at the present time of complete success. There is room for doubt as to just what properties a robot must have in order that he be able to learn like a man. Plainly we do not now know the whole truth about learning. We can indicate the general nature of the properties that the robot-learner would need, but not so specifically as to start right in on the design of the machine. It is here that we meet up with one of the chief virtues that lies in the perpetual desire to formulate operational definitions: when we find that we can not make the definitions with assurance, then we are warned that our problem is not clear and that further research is needed. Let us see what the basic facts of learning are, as well as we can state them. The law of exercise works as a gross fact of learning. If an association does not form at once, then we need to repeat the psychological contiguity of the conscious contents or the movements until the association forms, until the items have come to constitute a whole which supervenes when one of its parts is reinstated. You can get almost any two items related if you will put them together often enough, but frequency is no longer believed to be the essential condition of association. Frequency provides the continuation of a situation within which the desired association can occur. Similarly it is not time that makes us find a lost article, even though it takes time to find it. To find the lost object instantaneously, you have only to look at once in the right place. To learn instantaneously you have only to establish at once the right conditions for learning. You can find anything instantaneously simply by looking at it. You can learn anything instantaneously simply by-But that's the puzzle. Just what is it that makes learning instantaneous ? In Psychology 1 at Harvard we have a silly fable about Ebbinghaus, who invented the law of exercise years before Thorndike christened it. Our story is that Ebbinghaus, preparing for bed one night, finally went to his closet to get his pajamas (or the German equivalent of the 1880s), opened the door, and found inside the closet the corpse of a strange woman. He then closed the door. How many times, we ask, did Ebbinghaus have to open the door again (a) in order to learn that there was something</page><page sequence="10">182 BORING" odd about the inside of his closet and (b) what the odd thing was? Everyone thinks that Ebbinghaus, in spite of his predilection for the law of exercise, would have brought the fact of his unexpected windfall to complete mastery in what is called one repetition, meaning, of course, no repetition at all. And everyone is right. It is easy to learn about sufficiently important matters. There seem to be two principles which are invoked to account for this instantaneous learning. The one makes use of external reinforcement and the other of internal valences. Let us consider them. (a) We are appealing to reenforcement when we say that learning is dependent upon attention or interest or emotion or motivation. It is thought that by some such means the associative process is heightened enough to telescope the unnecessary repetitions, reducing the necessary contiguities to a single occasion. These factors, however, are useful only in explaining why frequency is reducible to the single contiguity; they do not show why contiguity should work at all. They explain why learning usually takes time, not why it occurs. Presumably-this is the implication- you could learn the Constitution of the United States in one reading, if your attention were maximal and never flagged for an instant, if your life depended on your learning and remembering, or if for years and years you had been dreaming of the day when you could read those sweet and halcyon words and now at last in ectasy you find yourself uttering them. That is a theory, but it is not true. It takes more than the threat of death or the ecstasy of love to get the U. S. Constitution learned in one reading. There is too much of it. It fights itself. There is some kind of interference, negative proaction and retroactive inhibition going on in the process of its acquisition. We need to know not only what makes strange associates stick to each other, but also how the formation of one association affects the formation of another. These reinforcements can reduce the amount of exercise needed for complete mastery, but not abolish exercise; nor do they show what property a robot must have in order to make items into associates. If all psychological simultaneous events got associated, all of them, always, then the matter would be easier; but they do not. Association is selective. Only the right contiguities join and survive. What makes them "right"? Whatever does, that is the associative principle which we want to give the robot. (b) The notion that associates adhere because they belong together, because they have valence for each other, is essentially Thorndike's con- ception of belongingness5 and the principle of Gestalt psychology that learning is the formation of wholes with such items being associated as will make good wholes.6 This kind of principle works where meaningful 'E. L. Thorndike, Human Learning, 1931, esp. 18-29. McGeoch has difficulty in finding a rigorous definition for Thorndike's belongingness; see J. A. McGeoch, The Psychology of Human Learning, 1942, 548-555. McGeoch also gives more recent references to Thorndike on this matter. "K. Koffka, Principles of Gestalt Psychology, 1935, 529-590.</page><page sequence="11">MIND AND MECHANISM 183 relations and insight come in. It is easier to associate horse with man than horse with thumb-tack, because there are more relations already learned between the members of the first pair than between the members of the second. It is hard to learn that 264,793 comes after ZILDOP, almost as hard as it used to be to relate Deuteronomy to Leviticus. In these instances we are appealing to the presence or absence of past learning, saying that there is transfer from it to present learning, that insight reduces to reen- forcement. The only known formula for being a genius, for having many rare and useful insights, is to be wise. It is insight to see in an instant that 39 times 41 is 1599, to see what the product is because you realize that 39 X 41 = (40 - 1)(40 + 1) = 402 - 12 = 1600 -1; but that in- sight will not happen if you never learned any algebra. Faraday got the principle of the electric generator in which you keep the current direct by reversing the connections whenever you reverse the magnetic field-he got that principle by recalling how Cyrus got his army past the River Gyndes by diverting the river so as to make it flow behind the army; but Faraday had first to know about Cyrus. Wisdom is past learning. We are asking now how the first pair of associates ever got associated. How does association start ? How does the first association occur in the fetus? Scarcely by simple conditioning in which one of two concurrent stimuli takes on the response for which the other is already prepotent. At any rate the simplest conditioning that we know anything about involves stimuli set in a situation, conscious awareness, expectation and often insight. Such complication comes genetically late. At the start there must surely be some simple valency working, something that makes the associates come into relation and continue in it. I have called this the associative principle. It is what I wish to put into the robot, but I am not sure what it is, how it works. In this way I give the phenomenologists, the antipositivists, the mystics their opening. They will now say of me: "This is what comes of trying to reduce mind to mechanism. It will not reduce." I suppose they could be right, and yet that suggestion seems to me just as implausible, just as nonsensical, as would be the suggestion that there are some conscious processes which do not depend on neural processes, which might go on without the presence of a nervous system or its material equivalent. The kind of learning of which we are talking expresses itself as the conduct of an organism in respect of the events which impinge upon it during its lifetime. We can always describe what happens in terms of stimulus and response, and that lands us in the realm of mechanism. We do not need to argue that learning is mechanistic; it is mechanistic by operational definition. But what exactly is the mechanism? Is there any known descrip- tion of events that tells, apart from their previous occurrences and apart from their frequency of recurrences, what will make them form wholes and stay associated? Robots that learn have been made, but usually they work on the principle of contiguity or frequency of contiguity. Adventitious concomitants get connected, by relays or other devices, so that the conditioned stimulus will function for the unconditioned stimulus. Recent models introduce</page><page sequence="12">184 BORING the law of effect so that success comes to supplant error.7 These machines are, however, but paltry imitations of the real thing. Psychologists are not yet ready to design a robot that learns like a man. The best we can do is to state the specifications, as many as possible, filling out the list and modifying details as the knowledge of the learning process becomes more complete. What ought a robot-learner to do? Let us imagine that we have an electronic box, with a dozen inputs and a dozen outputs. Each input can vary, let us say, in frequency and voltage, and each output can also vary in respect of the same two attributes. Let us imagine further that the box, as it comes fresh from the manufacturer, has only certain native or unconditioned responses in it. Perhaps each input is connected with a specific output, and the frequency and voltage of the output bear a fixed relation (expressed by certain characteristic functions) to the frequency and voltage of the input. We must suppose further that these relationships are not exactly maintained; there is some tolerance in the response, some chance for generalization. Next we should have to arrange for conditioning. The simultaneous acti- vation of two inputs would lead to the transfer of one output-effect from one input to the other. It would be better if the input that is to be condi- tioned came earlier than the unconditioned input. Such a preference for temporal order on the part of the box would eventually become evidence of the box's 'expectation' of the second stimulus after being affected by the first. From this start we need to go on through all the laws of condition- ing, restating each one (by way of its operational definition) as a property of the electronic box. It would be a dull procedure and quite profitless to us, except when it reveals a difficulty. It is those difficulties, those facts where the operational definitions are dubious, that reward us-reward us with a knowledge of the existence of our ignorance. One of the difficult things for a scientist to know is what it is that he does not know. I have already said that I think the chief difficulty arises in knowing what items will easily go into association and what will not. It is plain that we have got to endow the electronic box with some sort of a range of attention or some comparable limitation of its activities. If you activate too many inputs at once, only some of the appropriate outputs are going to respond. The box should not go into a convulsion, nor should everything Some of the more recent designs of learner-robots are to be found in: J. M.

There must be selection, and selection depends on internal properties hidden inside the box. Certain relations are favored, and this relative advantage shows up when too much associ- ation is attempted at once. As a matter of fact not all the items that could have been associated get associated, because there are too many. To get them all integrated, you have to make another try, and then another, thus starting the law of exercise on its way to realization. This discussion must do for learning. The account is not very satisfactory, but then that is just my point. You do not understand a psychological phenomenon well until you can generalize the mechanistic properties which are implied by those operations by which the phenomenon is known. (6) Symbolic processes. If you can get the matter of learning settled, then many of the other seemingly complex problems fall into line, for they depend upon learning. No one who watches a child acquiring the use of words need feel that anything other than the common business of learning goes on in this acquisition of symbolic processes. The fusion of a word with its referent is the establishment of a relation of reference, such that the one term has come to mean the other. All this talk as to whether animals use symbolic processes or employ language is nonsense. Of course they do. Almost every animal experiment is arranged, as I have remarked earlier, so as to provide the animal subject with a language with which he will communicate with the experimenter. That is why Pavlov called the gastric juice "psychic juice," because the animal spoke to him in the language of gastric secretion. All sorts of subjects speak by saliva- tion. Rats speak by running and by jumping, provided the proper tools of communication are provided. The jumping stand is a rodent typewriter, equipped with two keys, one of which says right and the other left. A language with only two words is not, after all, so very poor. Think what psychophysics can do with two words, greater and less. And, given the proper situation, an eye-wink can impart a great deal of information-as Hilgard and his associates have made so clear. At this point my straw-man, the intuitionist, rises to say that language involves the intent to communicate, that the rats are not intending com- munication when they jump, that they are merely intending to get on with a meal. Hilgard's eye-winks had meaning, but they were not pregnant with intended communication. To that I reply, silencing my straw-man who can speak only when I let him, "The presence or absence of an intent to communicate makes no difference so long as there is communication. The intent could in itself be studied and perhaps a useful meaning found for such a term and criteria for its existence formulated, but what does that</page><page sequence="14">186 BORING matter ? People speak, rats speak, books speak, monuments speak, kymo- graphs speak. Perception is one-way communication, and conversation is reciprocal socialized perception." My straw-man is writhing a little, but no matter. Let him writhe. If machines can introspect they can certainly communicate. I am coming to the mechanics of introspection later. Symbolic processes first got themselves talked about, I believe, in con- nection with the delayed reaction. You put the desired object under the middle box, take the child or the animal away, bring him back and note that he goes at once to the middle box. He must have carried the perception of where the food or the toy was around with him while he was away, so that it was available for use on his return. That kind of symbolic process is a trace. There is no doubt about the existence of memory, and memory means that events leave their after-effects as traces, which are knowable later in terms of their own effects. The memory image plays a less im- portant r61e than had been assigned to it fifty years ago, but the traces are necessary constructs. A double-alternation maze or one that requires two turns to the right before reversal to the left depends on traces. A man could learn to go twenty times right, and then left, but he'd count. Still counting is a serial use of traces. You count nine on the next time around only in the presence of the trace of eight. Rats do not count up to two if the counting is slow, but I think that the rats of Schlosberg and Katz were counting rapidly at least to two, perhaps to four, when they learned to move the lever quickly twice to the right and then twice to the left.8 A temporal whole has to have traces in it even when it passes quickly through its period. In trace conditioning you have the subject reacting to the time-interval that follows the conditioned stimulus rather than to the stimulus per se. That is a reaction to a trace which has become a symbolic process for the conditioned stimulus at a second degree of removal from the unconditioned stimulus. One has to assume in all these cases where duration as such is the effective stimulus that the trace is cumulative, that it is dated serially in such a way that later phases of it carry the consequences of earlier existence in them. If you can learn to discriminate twenty seconds from ten, then the twentieth second must be different from the tenth. In it are special potentialities for discrimination. A duration is cumulative and all of it is there, in some symbolic form, heaped up at the end of itself. SH. Schlosberg and A.

If we understood fully the nature of the associative principle, we should understand insight, or conversely. I am assuming, of course, that learning depends upon relatedness and not upon mere concur- rence. If the problem of insight is the problem of learning, then we might leave this matter there. There is, however, something to be said about the relation of insight to similarity and identity. I notice my straw-man, the mystic, getting uneasy because he fears I am going to equate similarity to partial identity, and he does not like that thought. He is wrong, of course, but I shall not stop to tell him so or why. It seems to me that even he, stupid as he often is, must admit that identity lies at the end of a series of increasing similarities. There is something special about identity, about twins. There is, for in- stance, nothing so similar as identicals, and the failure to find a difference between two phenomena stands out with a pleasant felt relief, whether the phenomena be two children dressed alike or whether they be two lines in a psychophysical experiment, each of which is the other. All scientific measurement is based on the judgment of abstractive identity, of same or different in respect of some attribute of the situation, and thus the percep- tion of identity is truly the basis of scientific measurement. Now it seems to me that we have here in this judgment of identity the simple paradigm for insight. The organism lives in a chaotic world. Difference of reaction is the business of its every moment. The rare occur- rence of perceived identity comes as a sudden relief to persistent alertness and change. That is why identity is pleasant and why the moment of insight is pleasant. It is the perception of identity that is, I suggest, the simplest form of insight. Similarly the complex samples of insight all have in them this essential of partial identity. Faraday's insight into the identity of the river shifted back of Cyrus' army and the magnetic field shifted back of the wire--that and the other examples all illustrate this point if you study them. As for our robot-we have not asked him to do anything new for us except to learn. He is already prepared to act in the same way to whatever stimuli or situations are not functionally different. If he can make a man of himself in learning, he will have insight. (8) Memory. It is scarcely necessary to say anything special about retention. Learning that does not persist for a time would have no effects and not even be knowable. The assumption for any learned mechanism must be that the formation of new potentialities for response persist, at least for a time. The important question is: What becomes of them? Is there forgetting?</page><page sequence="16">188 BORING (9) Forgetting. Pyschologists have pretty generally accepted the modern view of obliviscence, that forgetting depends no more upon the lapse of time than learning depends upon the duration of time that is provided by frequency of reconcurrences. For both learning and forgetting it is what happens in the time that matters. Learning by exercise is trial and error- or better trial and success. Forgetting is retroactive inhibition. Sleeping Beauty really did go right on from where she had left off a hundred years before, when the bad fairy inhibited her inhibitions. Not so much can be said for Hunter's cockroaches, sleeping in his refrigerator, for they forget what Hunter had just taught them about the dangers of hiding in the dark.9 Perhaps they were not wholly unconscious but dreaming enough to spoil what education Hunter had been able to give them. At any rate Minami and Dallenbach have just made it clear that Sleeping Beauty and the cockroach are not so different as Hunter thought.l0 There is nothing surprising in the fact that a robot or a living learning organism must be limited in its capacities, that the setting up of some new properties for reaction may disestablish others that were already there. I think of the organism as resembling a telephone exchange that is swamped with calls, as often happens in emergencies. The organism is, however, perpetually swamped. Most of the receptor excitations never get through to reaction at all. There are simply not enough lines to accom- modate all of them, as well as the trace excitations that are also in com- petition. In the telephone exchange temporal priority rules. In the organism the priority of rank rules. Reinforcement may get the line away from an established connection, though not always permanently. The inhibition may itself be inhibited under some new claim upon the con- nective mechanism. Those specifications for forgetting are not very precise, but they show the general lines along which design must go. A robot who could not forget would not be human--nor could he be efficient. He would get all his connections formed permanently and then lose the plasticity that is essential to any truly human machine. (10) Introspection. James G. Miller has given sixteen definitions of unconsciousness, each of which implies a complementary kind of conscious- ness." The concept of consciousness is certainly not univocal. The greatest 9 W. S.

I know that there is a crowd of people standing over there. That is an outer perception and one kind of consciousness. Also I know that I know there are people over there. That is an inner perception and another kind of consciousness. It used to be supposed that the first kind of percep- tion necessarily included the second, that perceiving always involves knowing that you are perceiving, that thinking includes knowing that you are thinking, and that introspection is thus nothing more than a registra- tion of immediate experience. That is certainly nonsense. There is as much to say about perceiving perceiving as there is about perceiving objects. Again it is an appeal to the animals which makes this matter clear. The rat on the jumping stand has learned to choose the brighter target which has thus become for him the symbol of the food-reward. Is there anyone who doubts that the rat knows which target means food? Does anyone doubt that he is aware of a difference in brightness? But that perception is consciousness. Rats and men are thus constantly aware of their surroundings and reacting to them, and must be regarded as conscious because they are reacting discriminatively. I myself rather like to note that a falling stone is similarly aware of the gravitational field in this sense of reacting differentially to it. The stone is geotropic, no doubt of it. The tropisms and reactions of a robot would be just as much conscious in this first sense of conscious. It is, I suspect, the usual way in which animals are conscious. The rat on the jumping stand who knows the difference between light and dark and where the food is does not, however, know that he knows the difference between light and dark or that he knows where the food is. Who does? The experimenter. It is he who knows that the rat knows and what the rat knows. He taught the rat the jumping language so that the rat could tell what he knows without himself knowing what it is he knows. It's very simple. Now what happens with the human introspector? He knows that he knows, playing the r61e of experimenter to himself as subject, or, con- versely, being a rat to his own scientific observation. He has stepped back in a regress, and that truth is obvious to anyone who takes still another step back to observe how he knows that he knows. Introspection is a definitely describable process as the introspection of introspection reveals. Definite representative processes arise to represent the knowing process, whether it be a knowing of knowing or a knowing of knowing of knowing.</page><page sequence="18">190 BORING The robot introspects simply by getting into this reactive regress, by reacting to one of his own reactions. If a robot gives evidence of perception by a discriminative reaction and a second robot reacts discriminatively to that reaction, then we have the case of the experimenter and the rat, and the second robot is beginning the process in his world which, if generalized, would make him into a scientist, perhaps into a psychologist, or at least a robotologist. On the other hand, if a robot reacts to one of his own reac- tions, then you have the case where observer and subject are the same organism; you have introspection going on. Those ten items complete my inventory of the psychological func- tions. I have dealt only indirectly with generalization and abstraction and with the law of effect. Perhaps those two functions should be added to the list. I do not think of anything else of equal importance that I have omitted, but, as I said earlier, the evidence for complete- ness must lie in the inability of others to confront me with new functions. RECAPITULATION Let me now recapitulate, saying again what it is that I wish to impress upon you. It should be easy with so many details at last in the background. In particular, I wish to define the role of robotism in psychology, to show what sense there is in talking about robots and also when nothing is to be gained by such talk. There are five points to be made. (1) Psychology has settled down pretty well to attempting to be an ac- count of man's functional capacities. That has been the American tradition all along, and to most of us it seems now that there never could have been an argument that an anatomical analysis of consciousness in a dualistic organism is what the psychologist lives to achieve. We need an inventory of the functions and we have a pretty good one of the main classes with many of the details. In some places we are not sure of the analysis. I have noted such an uncertainty in the case of learning. The existence of intelligence is another moot point, and perhaps also of emotion. It may be that both concepts, resisting rigorous definition, are now on the way out to join the limbo to which the will has been con- signed, and whither thought, as a concept independent of learning, is bound. Listing functions is not, however, what we want most of all to achieve,</page><page sequence="19">MIND AND MECHANISM 191 Psychology seeks to characterize these functions and, if it could ever do just that perfectly, it would have fully accomplished its task. (2) The way to describe the functional capacities of man is to describe his properties as a reacting organism. Work out his input-output char- acteristics, as you do in describing the properties of an electric motor. The means for getting these descriptions lies in the operational definition of the capacities. Tell how you can observe the existence of a property, and you have at once a description of the property in objective terms, in terms that you can use of another organism as well as of yourself. That is really all that is necessary. It is essentially what B. F. Skinner is up to in his description of the functions of his 'empty' organism. (3) A further step is to reformulate these functions as properties of a hypothetical robot. Or, if you prefer, you may use a sowbug, as Tolman does.12 This is what I have been doing in the latter part of this address, when I could not specify the exact mechanical design that would make the robot work. The advantage of playing this kind of game lies solely in the fact that, if you talk about machines, you are more certain to leave out the subjective, anthropomorphic hocus pocus of mentalism. There would be nothing wrong with mentalism if it used rigorous definitions of terms, but usually it does not. Hence the mentalistic concepts need first objective analysis into functions, and then a further test, the test of thinking about them as pertaining to a machine. (4) There is still a further step possible along this same road: the design and construction of actual robots who perform different human functions as well or better than a man can do. The electronic calculators and computers that the war has brought forth meet the specifications for some psychological functions, and doubtless more human electronic boxes could be built if the result were worth the thought and expense. The only use that lies in designing an actual robot is to make sure that, in stating the properties of a function, we have not left in unwittingly some mystic ambiguous mentalistic term. The only use in actually constructing the robot when he has been designed is to make sure that the design will really do what reason has already asserted it will do. Certainly a robot whom you could not distinguish from another student would be an ex- tremely convincing demonstration of the mechanical nature of man and of the unity of the sciences. (5) I have left out most of physiology and dealt mostly with the 'empty' organism. Of course, physiology should come in, and is coming in "1 E. C. Tolman, Discrimination vs. learning and the schematic sowbug, Psychol. Rev., 48, 1941, 367-382.</page><page sequence="20">192 BORING with all the current investigation of inner processes. It is needed eventually to complete the picture. We ought, in other words, to open the electronic box and understand its insides. That is very important, and when the physiological picture is complete it will be found that physiology is not necessarily identical with robotology. The machine man and the live man will almost certainly be found to accomplish similar ends in different ways. The robot is not, therefore, intended as a substitute for physiology nor is it a suggestive guide toward physiological hypothesis. The robot is simply an argument against mentalism, and against vague terms which pass current in psychologists' language while remaining incapable of rigorous definition. I believe that robotic thinking helps precision of psy- chological thought, and will continue to help it until psychophysiology is so far advanced that an image is nothing other than a neural event, and object constancy is obviously just something that happens in the brain. That time is still a long way off, and in the interval I choose to sit cozily with my robot, squeezing his hand and feeling a thrill-a scientist's thrill-when he squeezes mine back again.</page></plain_text>
