Data Management in Support of Environmental Monitoring, Research, and Coastal Management. Journal of Coastal Research, SI(45), 9-16. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Environmental monitoring is both a scientific and management imperative for effective coastal and estua rine resources research, management, and education. The establishment of monitoring programs provides for baseline studies, trend analyses, and impact assessments as related to both short-term variability and long-term change within estuarine environments. The effectiveness of these programs is dependent not only on the data collection but also on the implementation and maintenance of procedures to ensure access to high-quality data, data documentation, and derived products. Advances in information technology are im proving the way resource managers and researchers can assimilate, manage, disseminate, and share en vironmental data and information. The Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) initiative is developing an integrated national system for the United States' coastal zone built upon federal monitoring efforts and regional coastal observing systems that monitor the state and variability of the coastal waters and estuaries of the United States. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) acknowledges the importance of long-term environmental monitoring programs and data and information dissemination via the NERRS System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP). Consistent with the IOOS initiative and in support of sound data-management and -dissemination practices, the NERRS SWMP has implemented and sustains procedures to manage the basic infrastructure and data protocol to support the assimilation and exchange of quality-controlled data, metadata, and in formation within the framework of NERRS sites, state coastal zone management programs, and NOAA/ OCRM as well as other state and federally funded education, monitoring, and research programs.

INTRODUCTION A multiparticipant environmental data-manage ment program is both a scientific and management imperative for effective coastal resources research and management. The management of long-term environmental monitoring data sets provides for baseline studies, trend analyses, and impact as sessment of both natural and anthropomorphic phenomena. Advances in information technology are rapidly changing the way research and re source management agencies can assimilate, man age, disseminate, and share the data and infor * Corresponding author.

The technology revolution is providing organizations the opportunity to collect and integrate digital data independently while providing cost-effective mechanisms for the exchange of data and infor mation among various state and federal resource agencies, scientific disciplines, industry, and juris dictional areas. Historically, collections of environmental data from our nation's coastal zone have not been well coordinated and managed. Significant volumes of data have been collected by a variety of groups ranging from individual academic researchers to local- and state-level natural resource agencies to large federal monitoring programs. Unfortunately,</page><page sequence="2">10 Porter et al. much of these data are inaccessible and/or not properly documented, a primary reason being that data management has been considered as an af terthought rather than proactively addressed in the development of research and monitoring pro grams. However, current efforts are underway to improve the collection, management, archiving, documentation, and access to data sets critical for managing our limited coastal resources (Baker et al, 2000; Michener and Brunt, 2000; Seim et al, 2004; Small et al, 2003). The Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) initiative is developing an integrated national system for the United States' coastal zone built upon federal monitoring efforts (e.g., National Data Buoy Center, NDBC; National Water Level Observation Network, NWLON) and regional coastal ocean observing systems that monitor the state and variability of the oceans, Great Lakes, and estuaries of the Unit ed States. One key operational goal of the IOOS is the timely delivery of comprehensive data and in formation on the nation's coastal, estuarine, and open waters. This goal will be achieved through the coordinated development of regional monitor ing and prediction systems that provide access to integrated data at multiple scales of space and time easily accessed by researchers, stakeholders, and the public (Ocean.US, 2002a, 2002b, 2003a, 2003b). Implementation and maintenance of robust data-management and communications infrastruc tures are a critical challenge for development of successful environmental data-management pro grams. In an Ocean.US workshop report, Hankin et al. (2003) outlined the initial steps of a phased implementation plan for IOOS participants, and identified key functional elements for data and communications. The data and communications infrastructure must support metadata, data dis covery, data transport, Internet-based access, and data archiving (Hankin et al, 2003). As coastal monitoring systems are to be primary elements of the proposed national initiative, it is essential that the data and communications standards for re gional IOOS partners are established in accor dance with those adopted by IOOS. Also, as rec ognized in Hankin et al. (2003), regional systems will be composed of a diverse set of programs, some associated with the core national observing system (e.g., NOAA's National Data Buoy Center) and others being various cooperating programs (e.g., Carolinas Coastal Ocean Observation and Prediction System; Southeast Atlantic Coastal Ocean Observation System; Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System; Chesapeake Bay Observing System; Long-Term Ecosystem Observatory). In addition, several federal and state resource-man agement agencies as well as academic units are participating in multiparticipant, interdisciplinary environmental monitoring and resource-assess ment programs that emphasize data and infor mation aggregation and dissemination. These pro grams include the National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER), the En vironmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program, and the Na tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS). Thus, the development and ar chitecture of existing and future data and infor mation management systems must use open stan dards and web-based applications to meet the needs of resource managers, researchers, educa tors, and the general public for access to high-qual ity environmental data and information. Consistent with the IOOS goals of monitoring the health of our nation's coastal waters, the NOAA's NERRS established the NERRS System Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) for the long term environmental monitoring of estuarine re sources, and the archival, management, and dis semination of those data and information. SWMP, established in 1994, identifies and tracks short term variability and long-term changes in the in tegrity and biodiversity of representative estua rine ecosystems and coastal watersheds with the intent of contributing to effective national, region al, and site-specific coastal zone-management ef forts. In this paper, a number of the key data-man agement components for successful data-manage ment initiatives are summarized in the context of IOOS and the NERRS SWMP data-management program. MANAGING ENVIRONMENTAL DATA IN THE NERRS PROGRAM The NERRS SWMP is a comprehensive program consisting of three phased components: 1. Abiotic factors including atmospheric, water quality (e.g., nutrients, contaminants, etc.), and physical parameters including salinity, tidal range, groundwater, freshwater inflow, and ba thymetry. 2. Biological monitoring including biodiversity, habitat, and population characteristics. Moni Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 45, 2004</page><page sequence="3">Management of Environmental Data 11 toring is currently focused on chlorophyll a, and additional biological indicators being consid ered for SWMP are submerged aquatic vegeta tion (seagrasses) and emergent vegetation (marsh plants). 3. Watershed and land use characterizations, in cluding changes in consumptive and noncon sumptive uses. The NERRS Centralized Data Management Of fice (CDMO) was also established in 1994 in sup port of the SWMP. The purpose of the CDMO, lo cated at the North Inlet-Winyah Bay, South Car olina, NERR, is to manage the basic infrastructure and data protocols to support the assimilation, quality control, exchange of data, and metadata documentation within the framework of NERRS sites, state coastal zone-management programs, and NOAA, as well as other state and federally funded education, monitoring, and research pro grams (Small et al, 2003). Consistent with the high-priority recommenda tions of the IOOS Data Management and Com munications (DMAC) committee (Hankin and the DMAC Steering Committee, 2003), the CDMO and the CDMO Data Management Committee have established four current priorities in support of the SWMP: 1. Advancement of the SWMP data and informa tion management program, including appropri ate protocol for data collection, data quality control and assurance, metadata, and data ar chival. 2. Maintain the web portal providing access to data, metadata, and derived products associat ed with all monitoring efforts. 3. Provide technical support services via tele phone, e-mail to support individual and group training exercises, including the annual Tech nicians' Training Workshop series that provides instruction for NERRS research technicians working on SWMP initiatives. 4. Continuation of the CDMO Data Management Committee annual workshop to provide an ad ditional avenue for the exchange of ideas and information related to database-management, technological advances, and other data collec tion and monitoring program. Regionally, but also nationally, the NERRS pro vides a critical and required linkage to the federal integration initiatives for observing and monitor ing programs from the offshore to the estuaries to the upland. By focusing on the end user, the NERRS CDMO is implementing data and infor mation management systems that will meet the stated objectives and goals of IOOS ". . . enhancing existing networks for in situ measurements . . . and to improve spatial and temporal resolution. . . to include physical, chemical and biological vari ables" (Ocean.US, 2002a). In addition, the NERRS via the CDMO has implemented and maintains a nationally recognized (as evidenced by requested participation of the CDMO in the devel opment of IOOS-compliant regional observing sys tem data-management programs) data-manage ment program that is capable, with appropriate re sources, to not only integrate with regional ob serving system data-management partners but also to take a leadership role in "designing and implementing an enhanced, distributed data and information management system that links all ob servational and data-management systems (across agencies and programs) to all data users" (Ocean.US, 2002a). The NERRS, in conjunction with the SWMP and the CDMO, can provide practical experience and guidance as a foundation for critical required ele ments of environmental monitoring programs in formation management systems including: Development and implementation of standard practices for data collection. Development of protocols for all aspects of data management. Access to long-term datasets for estuaries that are important components of comprehensive coastal observing systems. COMPONENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL ENVIRONMENTAL DATA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM Acknowledging that it is difficult enough to de velop and maintain a single participant (e.g., in traagency, intrasite) data- and information-man agement program, potential participants of mul tiparticipant programs must first come to grips with why they should participate. Two compelling reasons are as follows: 1. Federal directives require federally funded or ganizations and projects to make their data and information available to the public and to co ordinate database development. By executive order, the National Spatial Data Infrastructure program calls for heads of agencies to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 45, 2004</page><page sequence="4">12 Porter et al. a schedule and coordinated funding plan to en sure a coordinated and coherent federal effort in database development. OMB Circular A-130 states in summary, as policy, that agencies shall ". . . distribute information at the agency's initiative, rather than merely responding when the public requests" (Anderson, 1994). 2. It makes sound financial and resource manage ment sense. Environmental data are very valu able, as collection efforts are expensive to im plement and maintain. On average, the more expansive the geographic area covered or the more detail required, the more expensive the data collection efforts. By implementing a pro gram that fosters the exchange of good data and information among groups, spatial overlap in data-collection efforts can be eliminated, poten tially lowering data-collection costs. By provid ing managers, researchers, and educators with the best available data regardless of jurisdic tional boundaries or agency affiliation, more in formed resource-management decisions can be made and appropriate plans implemented. This is especially true when dealing with resource management issues that do not adhere to juris dictional boundaries. Therefore, management plans that may have both environmental and economic impacts within and across jurisdic tions should be based on the most comprehen sive data available. A properly implemented data and information management program consists of several items, in cluding hardware, software, personnel, data, and documentation. More important to the overall suc cess of maintaining a usable database is the im plementation of a sound management strategy. In addition to obtaining interadministrative support, there are at least five key components for a suc cessful implementation of a multiparticipant da tabase-management strategy: 1. User needs assessment (UNA); 2. Data-collection protocol; 3. Quality-assurance/quality-control (QA/QC) procedures; 4. Program documentation and metadata; and 5. Data and information dissemination hub (Por ter et al, 1994). User Needs Assessment Within a multiparticipant data- and informa tion-management program, a variety of hardware platforms, software preferences, data-manage merit practices, and expectations will exist. The identification of existing and proposed manage ment programs, technological facilities, support personnel, system requirements, and expectations comprise the first step in the development and im plementation of a multiparticipant database-man agement program. This is accomplished through the administration of a UNA to all potential par ticipants in the program. The UNA addresses, at a minimum, five issues: 1. Perceived mission, goals, and objectives; 2. Type of data being collected; 3. Amount of data collected and information gen erated; 4. Sophistication; and 5. Infrastructure (Michener and Haddad, 1992). By analyzing the results of the UNA, the devel opment of the data and information-management system is implemented by identifying who is doing what, who has what, what resources are available, and what is expected. Synthesizing the results leads to a determination of what is necessary and what can be accomplished. Data-Collection Protocol From the UNA derives an identification of what data are being collected and what data are neces sary for effective resource management. This forms the basis of the development of the data collection protocol. Data collection-protocol is the documented identification of what parameters are to be measured, when they are measured, and how they are measured; thus, formulating and defining data standards. The data-collection protocol com bined with proper documentation provides for con sistency and ensures that data-collection proce dures can be assessed at a later date (e.g., years later after data-collection personnel and data-col lection techniques may have changed). It is unreasonable to expect that every partici pating group in a multiparticipant monitoring or observing program will collect or require the same data. An expectation that every group will or can conform to consistent data-collection techniques is most likely unrealistic. If the results of the UNA indicate that one or more environmental parame ters are consistently identified as important, it may be possible to implement a data protocol that ensures consistency for key data variables. For ex ample, the 26 current NERRS reserves collect dis parate amounts of data often dependent on facili Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 45, 2004</page><page sequence="5">Management of Environmental Data 13 ties, personnel, and current research projects. As part of the SWMP, NERRS sites have developed a national database of baseline environmental con ditions in NERRS-associated estuaries. By using a consistent protocol for data acquisition and QA/ QC, these data will provide for an intersite com parison of water-quality parameters (Small et a/., 2003). Quality Assurance/Quality Control Procedures Data required for effective resource manage ment may be collected using a variety of tech niques. These include remote sensing, in situ sam pling, and the use of automated data loggers. Data entry may involve manual entry of data from handwritten field sheets, downloading data direct ly from a data logger to a computer, or the use of sophisticated digital image processing and Geo graphic Information System (GIS) techniques. Col lected data are of no use to researchers and re source managers if the data do not accurately re flect measured conditions. The development, im plementation, and consistent application of QA/QC procedures facilitates the detection of data cor rupted by errors caused by automated or human data-collection and data-entry techniques (Mich ener and Haddad, 1992). The QA/QC procedures often entail multiple levels of data checking, which can lead to the introduction of human-introduced errors. With some automated data-collection equipment, downloading directly from data loggers to computers reduces the potential for human-in troduced errors. For nonautomated field-data-col lection efforts, standardized data entry forms can help reduce the potential for human-introduced er rors. Visual verification performed during and af ter data collection and entry as well as automated procedures for data-entry verification helps pro vide for higher quality data. An increasingly important aspect of the imple mentation of rigorous QA/QC procedures is the ef fect of temporal and spatial scales on GIS and re motely sensed data. The spatial scale, time, and conditions at the time of acquisition of the source data (usually satellite imagery, aerial photo graphs, airplane-mounted sensors, hardcopy maps) limit the detail and accuracy of information that can be extracted from the data. In many in stances, these data types are collected and/or de veloped by third-party data providers, where prop er data documentation and quality-control proce dures are not followed. Thus, critical aspects of the data that are not well documented (i.e., spatial and time scales) limit the usefulness and longevity of the data for research and management purposes. Data archival and protection are additional com ponents of QA/QC procedures. When dealing with the potential for data loss (e.g., natural disaster, hard-disk failure, fire), plan for the worst. It is vi tal to implement and adhere to a data-backup plan and to maintain multiple copies of all data sets. If an off-site storage facility for data archival is not feasible, a secure, fireproof cabinet is a small in vestment. In addition to data backup and archiv ing, a database-management strategy must pro vide for data integrity and security. This strategy will ensure that data sets are not altered or ac cessed improperly. Implemented QA/QC proce dures, no matter how rigorous, are of no value if not fully implemented and followed. As with all components of a multiparticipant database-man agement program, documentation of the QA/QC process is a requirement. Program Documentation and Metadata The importance of system and data documenta tion cannot be overemphasized. Oftentimes, docu mentation procedures are disregarded for reasons such as The documentation takes extra time. There is no reason to write it down; it is all stored in my head. If anyone has questions, they can ask me. It is my system and/or data; therefore, I do not have to document it. Proper documentation does take time, and often, the importance of documentation is not recognized. As personnel changes occur, data collection pro cedures are altered and data are exchanged among groups. Documentation is the key component link ing everything together. Procedures for system and data documentation must be formulated and budgeted when designing the multiparticipant da tabase-management program. Data documentation, currently referred to as metadata, is data about data. Metadata provide information about the characteristics of a data set, lineage of a dataset, and contacts for accessing or acquiring a data set. Standardized metadata pro cedures provide a means to document datasets within organizations; to contribute to and facili tate multiparticipant data-exchange programs; and to facilitate locating, understanding, and Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 45, 2004</page><page sequence="6">14 Porter et al. utilizing existing data sets. The choice of a data base structure should not matter as long as the content and structure of the metadata standard are adhered to by those responsible for data col lection and management (Federal Geographic Data Committee, 1994). In 1994, President Clinton signed Executive Or der 12906 titled Coordinating Geographic Data Ac quisition and Access: The National Spatial Data In frastructure, which required federal agencies and federally funded projects to use the Federal Geo graphic Data Committee (FGDC) standard to doc ument data they produce beginning in 1995. The FGDC metadata standard was developed from the perspective of "what a user needs to know about a data set." The standard provides a common set of terminology and definitions and supports common uses of metadata. Through the FGDC, the federal government, in particular NOAA's Coastal Servic es Center and NOAA's National Center for Coastal Data Development (NCDDC), along with federally funded initiatives such as the CastNet project funded by the Southern University Research As sociation on behalf of the Southern Association of Marine Laboratories, are working to develop stan dardized metadata procedures intended to im prove metadata development efficiency. These pro cedures are expected to enhance the use of data, reduce redundancy in data-collection activities, and provide a means for determining the useful ness of specific data sets. Of particular note are the efforts of the NOAA supported Carolinas Coastal Ocean Observing and Prediction System to use Ecological Metadata Language (EML) as the primary metadata stan dard. EML is a metadata specification developed by and for the ecology discipline, based on prior work conducted by the Ecological Society of Amer ica and associated efforts. EML is implemented as an XML schema that can be used to document eco logical data. EML is fully capable of meeting FGDC metadata requirements, and scientists have developed translators to generate FGDC metadata from EML, thus meeting federal guidelines for me tadata development. EML is better suited in both content and programmatic attributes to meet the need of research scientists focused in the environ mental sciences. EML has been adopted by the NSF LTER as the primary form of metadata doc umentation. In addition, the SensorML metadata standard is being designed to document scientific instrumentation. This standard will help facilitate an advanced documentation set of instrumenta tion types and maintenance properties. We expect that both EML and SensorML standards can serve many purposes within the NERRS as well as other monitoring and observing system initiatives such as data discovery and administrative management of instrument platforms. Data and Information Dissemination Hub In addition to the development of data protocol and procedures for QA/QC, monitoring and observ ing system initiatives can only be successful if par ticipants and potential users have access to the data being collected and information being gener ated. This is the issue of connectivity and com munication. Connectivity is the ability to access data and information regardless of where the data are stored and on what type of system. Advances in hardware, software, and telecommunications have eliminated the past bottleneck of communi cating across different hardware platforms. Com munication is the process of utilizing the connec tivity to identify, provide, obtain, and exchange data, ideas, and information pertinent to effective resource management. The development of an information hub is one technique used for connectivity and communica tion. The concept of an information hub should not be confused with the concept of centralized com puting. Centralized computing implies a single computer acting as a server to one or more ter minals, each of which is dependent on the server. The role of an information hub is to facilitate co ordination and communication within a site and across any number of sites. Although the infor mation hub will be at one location interacting with numerous other groups, the information hub does not take the place of or supersede the existing or ganizational database-management programs for a multiparticipant program. At a minimum, the information center coordinates the exchange of data and metadata, develops and disseminates standard products, and provides documentation. Data exchange or data dissemination should not be confused with information dissemination. The federal and state governments are working to de fine the public's right to access data and informa tion under Freedom of Information (FOI) laws. It is important to be cognizant of FOI laws and their potential impact on a multiparticipant database management program. The issue of data disclaim ers covering custodial liability must also be ad dressed. There are documented cases of litigation Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 45, 2004</page><page sequence="7">Management of Environmental Data 15 resulting from a decision made by one party based in part or in whole on data or information provided by another party. While the information hub may be set up as a central repository for all collected data, it is not a requirement. Individual groups may be inclined to not provide their data sets to the information hub. Instead, links are imple mented so that, when a data request is made to the information hub, the transfer of requested data is transparent. No matter what the distri bution medium (e.g., CD-ROM, diskette, on-line transfer), it is necessary to always provide associ ated metadata with data sets. An information hub can facilitate the exchange of ideas and foster interaction by developing a se ries of standard products providing for some level of intersite comparison. The availability and dis semination of standard products can provide an ef fective tool for facilitating intersite interaction and communication. The standard products may be as simple as a chart comparing total catch from a two-seam shrimp net tow by geographical region with the development of an on-line interactive GIS model for predicting land-use change, to model output of predicted flooding from a hurricane. Standard products, regardless of complexity, should provide information important to the over all goal of effective coastal resource management. Documentation, as mentioned previously, is the important link that ties everything together. The information hub should be responsible for acquir ing, maintaining, and disseminating metadata with all data requests. Possibly more than any other invention, the In ternet has revolutionized the way and frequency in which people can exchange data and informa tion. Using hypermedia browsers, the Worldwide Web (WWW) provides a hypermedia interface to the various protocols, data formats, and informa tion archives used on the Internet. It provides powerful methods for visualizing, exchanging, and using data and information. A strength of the WWW for the development of multiparticipant data and information dissemination programs is that it can be accessed from a variety of platforms. In the development of a Web-based data- and in formation-dissemination hub, several issues must be addressed, including system security and access to the Internet and the WWW. While Internet ac cess is becoming more and more common, many local resource-management and planning agencies still have no or limited access to the Internet. The user-needs assessment should help to identify the level of access available to the Internet and the WWW. CONCLUSIONS In order for estuarine monitoring programs like the NERRS SWMP to fully establish themselves as partners within IOOS and regional observing system initiatives, specific near-term (12-18 mo) foci of the data-management component will in clude: Timely (i.e., real-time or near real-time) delivery of appropriate data and information products to targeted end users. Data documented appropriately with fully com pliant FGDC metadata. Regional capacity for exchange of data and data products in accordance with the standards of the emerging national IOOS. Additional avenues of access to data and infor mational products using National Virtual Ocean Data System components (e.g., Open Source Project for a Network Data Protocol servers for data transfer and Live Access server for data visualization), Internet mapping capabilities, and metadata gateways (Hankin et al, 2003). Estuarine data managers must be involved in the development of the framework for inclusion of a range of additional regional partners associated with regional observing systems and integration with the national IOOS. Accordingly, the partici pation of additional data providers within regions should be encouraged and facilitated through adoption of a flexible, adaptable data-management infrastructure. Open-source software and tools specifically designed to facilitate access and visu alization are therefore strongly promoted. With appropriate system-wide support and determina tion, the NERRS is poised to take a leadership role in developing truly integrated regional coastal ob serving systems in support of national IOOS ini tiatives.
