ISBN:  9780231140232 (paper). US$24.50. Reviewed by Timothy M. Costelloe, The College of William and Mary In this focused, well-written, and highly readable book, Matthew Calarco offers  his audience a lively and informative tour through the work of four figures— Heidegger, Levinas, Agamben, and Derrida—who loom large in the landscape  of contemporary Continental philosophy. As the author points out, given the  politically “engaged” character of this tradition and its penchant for proudly  subverting the Western canon, one might expect to find in it a “welcome home”  (2) for far-reaching reflection on the relation between human beings and ani- mals and, in particular, a sustained effort to break the idols of anthropocentrism  and the subject, around which much discussion of the issues revolves. This is  patently not the case, Calarco observes, and his aim, subsequently, is both to  reveal the reasons for this failure and to extract a radical core from prominent  practitioners to show “that the human-animal distinction can no longer and  ought no longer be maintained” (3)� In chapter one, Calarco begins the defense of his thesis by condemning  the influence of Heidegger as having “served primarily to marginalize the ani- mal question in contemporary thought” (15). While the philosophical stakes  of Being and Time largely save Heidegger the trouble of seriously discussing  animals—they are at best pale shadows of Dasein, linguistically challenged,  which “perish” but never suffer “demise” or death—the later Fundamental  Concepts of Metaphysics contains a serious attempt to consider the Being of  animals “on the animal’s own terms” (20)� Calarco praises Heidegger for dis- tancing himself from the contemporary movements of reductionism and vital- ism, and emphasizes his view that animals differ in kind rather than degree:  they are not “lower” or “simpler,” but occupy fundamentally distinct regions  of Being. This might constitute an advance over the relatively clumsy catego- ries of Being and Time, but, Calarco charges, Heidegger’s ontology effectively  blinds him to his own anthropocentrism and from the insight that drawing any  principled distinction between human beings and animals is suspect in the first  place. Beings that are “poor in world” rather than “world forming”—as Heide- gger’s version of the distinction goes—is a “metaphysical anthropocentrism”  Environmental Philosophy 5 (2), 159–184.

After all, animals surely have a “face,” in Levinas’s charged sense  of that term, “an expressivity and vulnerability,” as Calarco writes, “that calls  my thought and egoism into question and that demands an alternative mode  of relation” (64)� There is no apparent reason to deny any “transcendence in  the animal itself” (59), which, in the Levinasian idiom, “ruptures” my order  of being and constitutes an “Other” in an ethical encounter� As Calarco argues  in chapter two, however, Levinas blinks at the wrong moment and rather than  following his thinking to its logical conclusion, baulks at the idea of “universal  ethical consideration” by asserting dogmatically that the Other is always a hu- man Other. Perhaps this failure of nerve indicates Levinas’s own realization  that extending the “face” beyond human beings leads to some bizarre results: it  is one thing to accept that the caged ape in the zoo or Bobby the dog (the stray  who reminded Levinas and his fellow-prisoners of their humanity while incar- cerated by the Nazis) can call forth an ethical encounter; but a rat, a fly or—to  push the thought further—a forest of trees or a mountain lake? Do these have  a “face,” even in a loose, extended, and metaphorical sense? There is some  debate over whether a Levinasian ethics can include nonhuman animals. How- ever, Levinas’s own work is quintessentially a human ethics and, some might  argue, inadequate even on that score. Calarco, however, is reluctant to dismiss  Levinas altogether, though one suspects that the “ethics without a priori con- tent” he outlines at the end of the chapter (74–7) signifies not that a doctrine  without “constraints or boundaries” is incipient in Levinas, but that developing  one involves leaving him blinking in the dust.  Chapter three turns to the contemporary Italian philosopher Giorgio Ag- amben. Calarco values Agamben for at least entertaining the idea that the  human-animal distinction should be “abolished altogether” (94)� Extracting  this from Agamben’s texts proves tough going and depends largely on work- ing hard his apparently borrowed notion of the “anthropological machine,” a  metaphor to express the by-now-familiar observation that scientific and philo- sophical practice always imposes a classificatory structure on its explananda.  The “pre-modern” version of this machine (rumbling away from Aristotle  through Linnaeus) gives animal life a human face, whereas, in a different gear,  its “modern” Darwinian counterpart animalizes the human by constituting hu- man beings out of the animal order of nature. The novelty of this observation,  Calarco insists, lies in effectively identifying the primarily political impetus  behind such interpretive practice: whether the output is pre-modern or mod- ern, the mechanism works according to the same “inclusionary-exclusionary  logic,” which effectively unites democracy and totalitarianism in a single cal- culus designed to distinguish bare animal life from political human culture and  justify the effects of violence inflicted on one group by another. The call to  </page> <page sequence="3"> book revieWs 161 reform or radicalize humanism and democracy is thus futile, pointing instead  to “an altogether different form of political life” (95). While Agamben himself,  Calarco alleges, fails to employ his metaphor to undo anthropomorphism, he  offers a “conceptual monkey wrench” to “jam” the anthropological machine  and make place for an alternative model of political and judicial practice. If this message is lost in the rattle of Agamben’s metaphor (and indeed,  Calarco himself ultimately finds little use for the wrench in question), it rings  out loud and clear in the warren of Derrida’s deconstructionism, the focus of  the fourth and final chapter of the book. In Derrida, Calarco finds an approach  that accepts the undeniable evidence of animal suffering, while insisting that  such “capacities are not the final foundation of animal rights” (117). Prior to  any reflection and debate on the ethical status of animals, Calarco’s Derrida ob- serves, there is a “proto-ethical” moment that forms the “interruptive encoun- ter” with a vulnerable, exposed Other that gives the animal some version of  the “face” withheld so unethically by Levinas. As Derrida himself discovers,  caught padding naked across his apartment in the gaze of his little cat (124),  self-consciousness is a function of other living beings, “whether human, ani- mal, or otherwise” (125). Surely this diagnosis is correct: Levinas is not alone  in shrinking from the abyss of so uncanny a feeling, his is only a particular ex- pression of that quick shake of the head with which all of us attempt to restore  the cracked existential order and shore up that vain belief that we are somehow  different. The “metaphysics of subjectivity”—that self-consciousness is trans- parent and other human beings are really like ourselves—is only a rarified,  philosophical expression of this will to value, rank, and distinguish, found in  equal measure whether applauding the efficiency of agro-business or condemn- ing the violence of the factory farm. Both sides trade on the same distinctions  with an ethics of liberation simply giving its own spin: animals feel pain like  humans (Singer) or are also “subjects of a life” (Regan)� All of this is shrouded  in a characteristically ugly Derridean neologism—”carnophallogocentrism”  (sacrificial, masculine, speaking)—but the point is well taken: distinctions are  deep and in complicated ways play into a network of ethical, political, and  judicial practices that effectively render this or that group in varying degrees  “life unworthy of life,” in that chilling phrase of Nazi propaganda, partial sub- jects and thus appropriate objects of violence. In Derrida, we would seem to find final expression of Calarco’s thesis that  the human-animal distinction neither can nor should be maintained� One might  be surprised, then, to learn that even Derrida has his limits, beholden, it tran- spires, to the anthropocentric and metaphysical tradition he does his level best  to destroy. Despite revealing the human-animal distinction to be “nonsensical”  (143), Derrida continues to insist on insuperable divisions between humans  and animals, and rather than rejecting it, ends by “refining, complicating, and  reworking the human-animal distinction” (149). Calarco’s evidence for such a  sweeping claim is rather thin (one passage from “The Animal that I Therefore  Am” and some en passant remarks taken from an interview) and hardly seem  </page> <page sequence="4"> 162 environmental PHilosoPHy to undermine what, under the power of Calarco’s own pen, amounts to a pretty  coherent view, wildly more convincing than the excesses of fundamental ontol- ogy or talk of metaphorical monkey wrenches. Nevertheless, it gives Calarco  warrant to offer his “alternative,” which, expressed as a question in the final  line of the book, proves to be an aporetic and faintly unsatisfying end to a work  that, in the final analysis, promises rather more than it delivers. “Might not the  challenge for philosophical thought today,” Calarco asks rather grandly, “be to  proceed altogether without the guardrails of the human-animal distinction and  to invent new concepts and new practices along different paths?” Well, yes,  but unless this is a merely rhetorical gesture, these paths and practices must  have decipherable and describable outlines. It is, famously, an easier task to  negate and deconstruct than to affirm and rebuild. Singer, Regan and the veg- etarians of this world might not be (post-) enlightened enough to recognize the  essentially “carnophallogocentrist” nature of their practices, but at least they  are doing something: was the lack of “engagement” not the problem with the  Continental approach to the “question of the animal” in the first place?

In the meantime, he has written extensively on the Neoplatonists, par- ticularly Plotinus, though he is most famous, at least in America, for his books  Philosophy as a Way of Life (1995) and What Is Ancient Philosophy? (2002),  in which he demonstrates that ancient philosophy is primarily the practice of  the good life and only secondarily a body of theories or doctrines. I take this  thesis to be patently obvious, though the truth, it seems, can often remain hid- den in plain view. Supposedly, one of the first translation programs, which turned English  into Russian, was fed the phrase: “The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”  This truth from the translation we call the King James Bible became in Rus- sian: “The vodka is strong, as the meat is rotten.” For Hadot, the history of  thought behaves like this translation program; The Veil of Isis follows the mis- translation of a single phrase, Heraclitus’s phusis kruptesthai philei� Hadot ar- gues that the most accurate translation of this is, roughly: what causes things to  </page> </plain_text>
