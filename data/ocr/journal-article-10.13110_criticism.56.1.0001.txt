<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ACTS OF STILLNESS: STATUES,  PERFORMATIVITY, AND PASSIVE  RESISTANCE David J. Getsy The idea for this essay was sparked by reading Barbara Johnson’s “Mute- ness Envy” (1998), in which she interrogated the canon of Western poetry  and its persistent idealization of female silence.1 Muteness, she argued, be- came a “repository of aesthetic value” in poems such as John Keats’s “Ode  On a Grecian Urn” (1819) because of the ways that the inability to speak  served to facilitate patriarchal power.2 In the tradition she critiques, a lack  of access to speech is upheld as a precursor to the judgment of beauty.  When reading through Johnson’s many cases of the ways in which mute- ness incited the desire to control, to ravish, or to protect, I was struck by  an analogous feature in the history of sculpture. If, in Johnson’s formu- lation, muteness becomes the condition that both sparks and authorizes  rape, paternalism, and objectification, then how does muteness operate  in relation to surrogates for human beings that stand before us and do  not speak? Muteness is a special feature of poetry and prose because of  those media’s direct relation to language, and I began to question how, for  sculpture, the related and more fundamental term is stillness. What follows is a proposition for reassessing the history of sculpture  with a view toward characterizing a wider range of viewers’ reactions to  statues. In this, I consider the sculptural encounter as a theater of power  relations between active viewers and passive statues. This dynamic is fu- eled by the bodily and spatial engagements of the viewer or artist with  the three-dimensional representation of the human body, most pointedly  at a one-to-one scale, that stands before them. My emphasis will be on  statues in the post-Enlightenment tradition of European and American  art, with an emphasis on the history of modern sculpture, but one could  ask analogous, if differently inflected, questions of other times and places.  I have pitched my argument toward recurring patterns in the history of  sculpture, and I have avoided in-depth case studies in preference for a  more wide-ranging and general assessment of the effects of statues acting  criticism Winter 2014, Vol. 56, No. 1, pp. 1–20.

The performativity of statues’ pas- sive resistance has underwritten the aesthetics of sculpture, and a focus  on stillness can illuminate the ethical contours and recurring historical  themes of the sculptural encounter. * * * A three-dimensional figurative image—that is, a statue—both depicts a  body in space and is a body-in-space. I can look at a statue of an athlete, of  Apollo, of a fieldworker, of a politician, of a heroine, or of a fawn and see it  in its representational distance. I am confronted by an image of something  not actually present, perhaps never seen in everyday life, or maybe recog- nized as a character from books, poems, dreams, or the televised news. At  the same time that it functions in this way as a three-dimensional image,  the statue is also present for me as a physical object displacing space with  its volume. It stands, sits, or lies in front of me. I can touch it. I do touch  it. I walk around it. I move up to it. I walk away from it. Sculpture differs fundamentally from the vast majority of two-  dimensional, pictorial media in its coextensiveness as depicted image and  depicting object. A statue can be equivalent in volume to the represented  body, sharing its proportions and construction. Jean-Paul Sartre saw this  as the paradox of the statue: “I have real relations with an illusion; or, if  you prefer, my true distance from the block of marble has been confused  with my imaginary distance from [the image it represents].”3 Because of  this paradox, the address of a statue is necessarily corporeal, spatial, and  relational. Sartre saw the statue as “depend[ing] on the relativity of the  angles from which it is viewed. As for the spectator, he takes the imagi- nary for the real and the real for the imaginary.”4 The situation the statue  presents is more akin to an encounter with another person than any two- dimensional representation could offer. In the present essay, I will be  speaking mainly about life-size, freestanding statues out of efficiency, but  analogous spatial-representational activations are varyingly present in dif- ferent scales from the handheld to the gigantic. That is, even if the statue  is monumental or miniscule, the bodily sense of scale becomes a corporeal  link between the viewer and the actual presence of the three-d imensional  image made from such materials as marble, bronze, or wood. Space is shared with statues, and there is rarely a background to a statue  other than the room in which we encounter it and the ground on which  we stand with it. There is no visible and physical boundary as there is  with a two-dimensional image. The pictorial involves a translation of the  </page> <page sequence="3">  ACTS OF STILLNESS 3 three-dimensional world to a new world untouchable behind the picture  plane. By contrast, the condition of sculptural representation is boundary- less in its physical proximity and real tactility. Despite this activation of  the sculptural body and its corporeal relationality, the statue nevertheless  refuses to act like, move like, or respond to us as though it actually were  the human body it represents.5 The statue stands before us, confronting  us with its immotility, its muteness, and its obdurate copresence. As the  poet Frank O’Hara once wrote in reference to the work of the sculptor  David Smith, “It is the nature of sculpture to be there. If you don’t like it,  you wish it would get out of the way, because it occupies space which your  body could occupy.”6 This quality of statues to be in bodies in space with us is always bal- anced by their stillness and silence. Perhaps the central theme in the his- tory and theory of sculpture has been the struggle with animation and  movement. Of course, there have been examples of poseable, motile, and  animatronic sculptures for centuries, but these represent a very small pro- portion of the history of sculpture. In general, the history of writing about  sculpture has focused on static, immotile objects. This history registers  the presumption of stillness in its literature with such organizing tropes  as the dream of the moving statue or the recurring metaphor of the cold  statue haunted by deathliness. In other words, even though statues take  on the shape and, often, size of humans, they are seen as false and inferior  in the incompleteness of their approximation. Their stillness is taken as a  lack of life. One could point to an abundance of examples of this in the aesthetic  and critical writing about sculpture in the Western tradition. Perhaps  one of the most forthright of such statements is also one of the earliest.  The second-century Christian polemicist Clement of Alexandria railed  against the worship of statues, and in so doing he concluded that their  stillness was proof of their deathliness and their duplicity: There is not a single living creature that is not more wor- thy of honour than these statues; and how it comes to  pass that senseless things have been deified I am at a loss  to know, and I deeply pity for their lack of understand- ing the men who are thus miserably wandering in error.  For even though there are some living creatures which do  not possess all the senses, as worms and caterpillars, and  all those that appear to be imperfect from the first through  the conditions of their birth, such as moles and the field- mouse, which Nicander calls “blind and terrible”; yet these  </page> <page sequence="4"> 4 DAVID J. GETSY are better than those images and statues which are entirely  dumb. For they have at any rate some one sense, that of  hearing, let us say, or of touch, or something corresponding  to smell or taste; but these statues do not even partake of one  sense. There are also many kinds of living creatures, such  as the oyster family, which possess neither sight nor hear- ing nor yet speech; nevertheless they live and grow and are  even affected by the moon. But the statues are motionless  things incapable of action or sensation; they are bound and  nailed and fastened, melted, filed, sawn, polished, carved.  The dumb earth is dishonoured when sculptors pervert its  peculiar nature and by their art entice men to worship it;  while the god-makers, if there is any sense in me, worship  not gods and daemons, but earth and art, which is all the  statues are. For a statue is really lifeless matter shaped by a  craftsman’s hand.7 This early assessment of sculpture’s deficiency and its effects is carried  through many accounts of statues, up through the Enlightenment tra- dition when the myth of Pygmalion’s animation of his cold and unre- sponsive statue becomes perhaps the structuring trope of the aesthetics of  sculpture. The fear that statues were merely “motionless things incapable  of action” and “lifeless matter” motivated both the creators of statues and  those who would write about them. As Sartre would observe a millen- nium and three-quarters later, “The truth is that for three thousand years  sculptors have been carving only cadavers.”8 Such anxieties of animation determine the history of the statue. The  statue’s supposed lifelessness (already decried by Clement) served as the  tradition’s foil. Indeed, figurative sculptors developed an arsenal of meth- ods directed at imbuing their static bodies with the impression of life.  They spent a great deal of energy trying to convey actual movement and  the capacity for motility in their sculpted bodies in an attempt to con- vince viewers to look past the obdurate stillness of their works. Contrap- posto, facial expressions, gestures, and other implied movements were all  used to simulate motion and its capacities in unmoving anthropomorphic  masses. Consequently, the most biting criticism of sculpture was to call it  cold and lifeless. This was most articulately written about by the Victo- rian Aestheticist critic Walter Pater, who argued in 1893, “The limitation  of sculpture results from the material, and other necessary conditions of  all sculptured work, and consists in the tendency of such work to a hard  realism, a one-sided presentment of mere form, that solid material frame  </page> <page sequence="5">  ACTS OF STILLNESS 5 which only motion can relieve.” He concluded that “each great system of  sculpture resist[s] . . . its stiffness, its heaviness, and death.”9 One could look to Pater’s exact contemporary Edward Onslow Ford  and his shelley Memorial at Oxford, completed in 1892, in light of this  attitude toward sculpture’s struggle (figure 1). Ford attempted to push  the boundaries of realism in sculpture by depicting the corpse—the life- less body that has lost its capacity to move. Though not wholly unprece- dented, Ford made this a bolder move than tomb sculptures or effigies  of the sleeping departed that preceded his work. He did this in order to  activate the materiality of the white marble and fuse it with the pale flesh  he was representing, thus finding in his thanatic realism a way out of the  limitation of sculpture’s stillness. The corpse has proven to be an important subject matter for sculptors  attempting to deal with their art’s supposed lifelessness. We need only  look to another important example, Alberto Giacometti’s Woman with  Her throat cut of 1932, for the way in which Giacometti both justified  and amplified his move off the pedestal to the floor through the subject  Figure 1.

We approach the sculpture as we would an  actual dead body encountered on the street. Its spatial confrontation with  the viewer and its groundbreaking removal of the pedestal or plinth to  activate that confrontation are both predicated on obviating the nagging  issue of sculpture’s immotility. Only in the subject matter of death can the  human body be like the statue in its ceaseless stillness. I regard both Ford  and Giacometti’s works as key moments of commentary in the history of  three-dimensional representation, for both found a means to trump our  evaluation of the sculptural body in terms of its lack of movement.10 They  made the bold move of embracing the lack of life in the statue, giving us  the dead body as the answer. Most sculptures, however, are not of corpses. Rather, the central justifi- cation for the figurative statue historically has been to keep the dead alive,  to memorialize them, to embody their characters, or to project the ideals  they supposedly upheld in their lives. The corpse and its loss of anima- tion, however, haunt the history of sculpture, becoming the allegory for  its struggle with inert materiality. There are plenty of dreams of animated  paintings and, of course, there are moving pictures, but one could argue  that the history of the statue is nothing less than a history of compensa- tions for sculpture’s stillness. Consequently, the dream of animation looms  large whenever the statue is written about. Ovid’s tale of Pygmalion is  the foundational story of this tradition, and it is replayed and referenced  Figure 2. Alberto Giacometti, Woman with Her Throat Cut (1932), bronze. National Gal- leries of Scotland (Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh). </page> <page sequence="7">  ACTS OF STILLNESS 7 whenever the statue is in play. The Pygmalion myth has been well stud- ied by Kenneth Gross, Essaka Joshua, Mary Sheriff, George Hersey, and  Victor Stoichita, among others, revealing it to be a fundamental literary  trope that takes the statue, quite literally, as its animating figure.11 For  artists, art critics, and art historians, furthermore, the unmoving sculp- ture has been more than a metaphor or literary image. It has been a driv- ing concern, and the problem of the statue’s confrontational inertness has  preoccupied those who would praise, criticize, create, narrate, or analyze  sculptural objects. In all of these traditions of discussing statues, stillness is defined nega- tively as an absence of movement and responsiveness. As with Johnson’s  “muteness envy,” there is an idealization and aestheticization of a position  constituted as a lack to be filled. In other words, this supposed inade- quacy is postulated as the statue’s undeniable burden, and consequently  the statue is cast in a passive and subordinate role to the viewer, the critic,  and the sculptor. Nevertheless, this lack of life does not mean that stat- ues are overlooked as mere objects. Quite the contrary, a belief in statues’  need drives many narratives about their effects on the living. In poems  and stories, we read of loving caresses bringing statues to life, hear tales of  men locking themselves in temples to make love to statues of Aphrodite,  and learn cautionary justifications for iconoclasm.12 Psychiatric and sexo- logical literatures warn against agalmatophilia or Pygmalionism—the  sexual attraction to the stillness of statues.13 Across this range of responses,  the frozen lifelessness of the statue induces extreme affect and reaction in  viewers, justifying a range of actions not permissible with the living body.  Indeed, seeing the lack of movement of the statue as a taunt can help  us to understand just why so many statues on college campuses become  the victims of pranks or dress-up. As well, this idealized passivity of the  sculptural body underwrites the failure of animation that is the primary  example of Sigmund Freud’s uncanny. The history of sculpture evinces the recurring desire to assert the statue’s  lack of action, and the nomination of this trait as something to be corrected  or overcome often rings disingenuous. Technologies of animatronics have  been around for centuries, yet sculptors and critics still expect, look for, and  admire immotile statues. The organizing myths of the history of sculpture  and the themes of its aesthetics all serve to install stillness as the statue’s  guiding principle—even as it is recurringly derided. There is a compulsion  to performatively reiterate the claim of the statue’s inability to act, and those  claims often take the form of a paternalistic wish for the statue’s life or a dis- ingenuous fear of its deathliness. This pattern in the history of sculpture ef- fectively idealizes motility and activity, which become comfortably located  </page> <page sequence="8"> 8 DAVID J. GETSY in the circumambulating viewer or the adept artist. In short, a product of  the discourse of the statue is the valorization of the superior position of the  mobile viewer or artist.14 The continued and repeated arguments about  the statue’s lack of animation serve as a means of aggrandizing beholders’  capacity to move, to act, to control. In short, the stillness of statues may  be lamented, but it is nevertheless enjoyed for its reinforcing of the motile  viewer or artist’s power over that statue. But what if we dispense with such stories of lack and inadequacy and  perform an inversion of their terms to make this negative account posi- tive? This won’t wash away the problematic assumptions of the gendered  lineage of Pygmalion (nor the idealized need and receptivity of Galatea),  but it will help reveal some of its key terms. Rather than see a lack of  motility, I want to uphold the statue’s refusal to move. Its immobility is an  act—a performative act—that affects those who would approach it. The  statue’s acts of stillness are unnerving, disconcerting, and defiant, let’s not  forget. It is this refusal that catalyzes what I see as a central issue for sculp- tural aesthetics: that is, how the physical copresence of the statue initiates  a cascade of effects on the viewer in which she or he attempts to manage  the incursion into their space by a material object that is equivalent to  the image that it depicts three-dimensionally.15 The management of that  incursion on the part of the viewer often takes the form of a desire to con- trol, and the responses to statues’ acts of stillness can manifest themselves  in pleas, in probing caresses, in desires, in fantasies of rape, in violence,  in paternalism, in destruction, in mocking indifference, and in viola- tion. Aggressive responses or negative affects often fall out of accounts  of sculptural aesthetics in which such positive terms as beauty, interest,  eroticism, or pleasure are emphasized, but they are nevertheless part of  the larger history of sculpture and its receptions. When collated with the  negative reactions and reprisals, these positive responses are revealed, too,  to rely on the unequal power dynamics of active/passive that are endlessly  replicated when the statue’s stillness is idealized for what it supposedly  misses. I propose that acknowledging statues’ performativity and view- ers’ consequent desires to control it offers a means of better articulating a  theory of the sculptural encounter in all of its variety. Our encounter with  statues is always an encounter with other bodies that share our space, wait  for us, and defiantly remain unresponsive. Consequently, a different way  of characterizing the discourse of the statue is to see it as a history of its  acts of passive resistance to the motile viewer or artist’s attempts to assert  control. Figurative sculpture makes this relation manifest and visible, but this  dynamic also haunts other sculptures that take on a minimal set of the  </page> <page sequence="9">  ACTS OF STILLNESS 9 most basic traits of human bodies. In his 1967 essay “Art and Objecthood,”  Michael Fried’s infamous denunciation of Minimalism rested on his per- ceptive claims about anthropomorphism in literalist sculpture. Whereas  the sculptors associated with Minimalism claimed to avoid reference and  achieve literality, Fried argued that the sculpture was there waiting for  viewers and was fundamentally anthropomorphic. Of Minimalist sculp- ture, Fried wrote, [T]he beholder knows himself to stand in an indetermi- nate, open-ended—and unexacting—relation as subject  to the impassive object on the wall or floor. In fact, being  distanced by such objects is not, I suggest, entirely unlike  being distanced, or crowded, by the silent presence of an- other person.16 Fried then proceeded to call out Minimalism for its anthropomorphism,  using Tony Smith’s human-scale Die (1962) as his example (figure 3).  Fried concluded, “One way of describing what Smith was making might  be something like a surrogate person—that is, a kind of statue.” Fried  continued to invoke the image of the figurative statue in all its stillness  and muteness as the key to understanding the exaggerated bodily con- frontations and relations at which Minimalist sculpture had aimed with  its banishing of representation. He returned to this tactic, saying in one of  the most famous lines of the essay, An inasmuch as literalist work depends on the beholder,  is incomplete without him, it has been. And once he is in  the room the work refuses, obstinately, to let him alone— which is to say, it refuses to stop confronting him, distanc- ing him, isolating him.17 In making his case, Fried effectively characterized the encounter with  the literalist sculpture as two things: as intercorporeal (due to the sculp- ture’s nascent anthropomorphism) and as reactive (i.e., a response to the  sculpture’s performing of copresence). I am not interested in adjudicating  Fried versus Tony Smith or Robert Morris in this case. His terms, how- ever, are useful in that they point out how human-scale bodily relations— even with a cube—usher in affects in the viewer that are determined by  experiences of previous social, bodily, interpersonal, and intersubjective  relations.18 Fried activated these specific interpersonal experiences when  he claimed that the objects “waited”19 for him and compared this to the  </page> <page sequence="10"> 10 DAVID J.

The affects Fried enumerated are created because the sculpture is un- derstood to be a statue acting on the viewer. His limit case helps to show  that sculpture’s stillness is nothing short of a performative act. The steel  cube, the marble, or bronze statue confronts the viewer not just as a hunk  of material and not just as a three-dimensional image but as a body in our  space acting by not moving. The discipline of performance studies has taught us to attend to the  history of acts. Accordingly, nothing is ever merely acted upon without,  too, performing—even if that performance is of passivity or, in this case,  mute stillness. Similarly, such perspectives as speculative realism, object- oriented ontology, posthuman studies, actor-network theory, and thing  </page> <page sequence="11">  ACTS OF STILLNESS 11 theory have all called for a greater recognition of objects’ agency within  a matrix of acts, of which human participation is just an element.21 One  of the implications of these perspectives is to decenter the human into a  network of material relations, only some of which involve human agents.  Statues are, without a doubt, some of the most privileged of objects, an- thropomorphic in a literal rather than tropological sense. What they per- form is their bodily relationality to the humans that they resemble, and  their acts are still and motionless. Beyond inverting the negative aspersions of stillness as subservience,  it is productive to see that performance of motionlessness as a kind of  critical passivity—that is, as an enactment of passive resistance. In other  words, the statue’s act of stillness compels the viewer to negotiate the con- tours of power established between their moving body and the defiant,  unmoving one presented by the sculpture. As we have learned from the  history of nonviolent resistance as a tactic of civil disobedience, the refusal  to move or to respond can be a powerful act that exposes the dispensation  of power and the ethics of those who wield it.22 Confronted by its refusal to move, people take liberties with sculpture  all the time. They have been performatively cast as stillness’s target, re- actant, and addressee. They respond; they want to touch it, to feel it, to  kick it. Under the guise of exploration or appreciation, they probe and ca- ress the sculptural body. They walk around it and examine its details and  forms. They sometimes play at hurting it, giving it a slap or a poke. As we  have all seen from sculptures placed in public places or, indeed, anywhere  other than a museum, sculptures bear the evidence of people’s desires to  touch, to feel, and to vandalize, and to objectify. The nude held sway in  the history of sculpture far longer than it did in other media, I think, pre- cisely because its spatial and tactile passivity authorizes an attitude toward  the art object that masks a desire to objectify the bodily image. Again,  both the aesthetics of sculpture and the history of the sculptural encounter  are characterized by these reactions on the part of the viewer to the statue’s  acts of stillness. That is, the fascination, disdain, boredom, excitement,  mocking judgment, longing, hatred, and laughter statues inspire can pro- ductively be understood as responses to the statues’ performances of mute  motionlessness. The performativity of the act of stillness makes the statue—despite  its monochromy, its immotility, its heaviness, its unresponsiveness—into  something like a defiant agent. One should be clear, however, that the  statue is not a subject in the full sense of the term. As Whitney Davis  has noted, “Artworks are never subjects, but always objects; only sub- jects are subjects.”23 The mutual recognition between subjects that defines  </page> <page sequence="12"> 12 DAVID J. GETSY intersubjectivity is a powerful and infrequent episode amongst a lifetime  of interpersonal encounters and negotiations.24 Intersubjectivity can be  vertiginous, thrilling, comforting, or agonistic, but its transformative po- tential is underwritten by a logic of sameness and mutuality. Two-way  recognition requires as much, and both the joy of rapport or the despair  of discord that intersubjective encounters can usher in are made possible  by confronting categorical likeness. For this reason, agents of an entirely  different category (an object, a statue, or even a person characterized with  prejudice as inferior or inhuman) do not operate as subjects despite their  efficacy, resistance, or power.25 Individually or collectively, fantasies of or wishes for the intersubjec- tive are often projected onto objects or events (as with the case of some  reactions to statues). Such beliefs can be enabling, powerful, catalyzing,  or structuring. However, the one-sided nature of the exchange with the  object means that—however much it acts in the world as agent due to  these mediations and uses—it cannot offer intersubjectivity in the full  sense. The object (as well as the object-as-agent) remains reflective of  the individual or collective projections onto it. This distinction is use- ful because it allows one to examine how fantasmatic, projective (false)  “intersubjectivity” often reveals a great deal about the subject(s) who  so deploy the object. Statues—because of their figurative valence—are  exemplary of this. They are not subjects, but they are sometimes treated  like them. They act as agents because of viewers’ projections onto their  material rendering or evocation of the human form—re-created as  copresent in three dimensions with the viewer. They function as ersatz  persons (not subjects) that, in their defiant stillness, expose the ways in  which living viewers respond to that inertness. Indeed, it is precisely be- cause the statue is an acting agent but not a recognizing subject that its  encounter stages power dynamics that evoke social, interpersonal, and  corporeal interactions. How do viewers choose to use the power that  their capacity to move seems to give them over the defiantly unmoving  bodies of sculpture? It is here where the ethical contours of the sculp- tural encounter manifest themselves, as motile viewers confront the re- sistant passivity of the statue’s copresence. I contend that the viewer’s  response to the statue’s stillness most often takes the form of an assertion  of control—whether that assertion takes the form of a nonconsensual  caress, of vandalism, or merely of the viewer’s insistent urge to show off  the ability to move by circumambulating and examining. I think it is important to see the networked and two-directional rela- tions between the statue and the viewer’s projections as a means to reclaim  statues’ resulting performativity.26 The power dynamics of the sculptural  </page> <page sequence="13">  ACTS OF STILLNESS 13 encounter are made more visible once the terms are inverted by uphold- ing the statue’s stillness as an act of passive resistance. Indeed, the trope of  the statue’s lack of life that so determines the history of sculpture is end- lessly repeated precisely because it, pace Johnson, idealizes that lack for  the ways in which it seems to authorize acts of mastery. That caress, that  kick, that sneer, that giggle that are so frequent when viewers encounter  statues (in a museum or outside of one) are acts of mastery that the rheto- ric of lifelessness in the statuary tradition seeks to mask and justify. By  shifting perspective to the statue’s positive performance of stillness, one  can characterize the full range of physical engagements with the statue as  reactions to its passive resistance. One result of tracking such patterns of response is the greater visibility  of gender’s role in the statuary tradition. Again to invoke Johnson’s claims  about the idealization of muteness, the passivity of the statue is upheld  as an organizing ideal and used as justification for acts of power in these  accounts that so often associate this passivity stereotypically with women.  Pygmalion’s glad Galatea is the most prominent, but we could also look  to E. T. A. Hoffman’s Olympia or Fritz Lang’s robot Maria from Me- tropolis (1927) (or, for a cautionary inversion, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein  [1818]). It is beyond the scope of this essay to delve into the long list of  historical examples that bears out this claim about the ways in which the  sculptural encounter becomes a site for the replaying of gender difference  and power, but suffice it to recall that the myths of the animate statue are  almost all about statues of women. But, of course, there are also statues of men, and these, too, fall prey to  the same exercises of reactive control as do statues of women. A statue of a  man—especially, but not just, an unclothed man—is marked as an object,  despite the statue’s best attempts to convey a representation of a subject. As  an object, the statue of the man, too, is the recipient of reactions of control,  and the predominance of gender violence in the history of vandalism of  statues bears this out. I am reminded of Jules Dalou’s statue of Victor Noir  (1891), which has had its crotch rubbed shiny by generations of Parisian  women (and random passersby in Père Lachaise Cemetery) who consider  his ample dressing to the left to be a fertility charm (figure 4).27 Liberties and  violations are still exercises of power, and what is important here is not the  named gender of the viewer but, rather, positions of active and passive that  have historically taken sexual difference as their primary metaphors. In this essay, I have largely restricted myself to conventional statues, life- size and freestanding, but I need to reemphasize that implications of this  could be extended into the many other three-dimensional bodily images  that surround us. Rainer Maria Rilke, writing on dolls, for instance, came  </page> <page sequence="14"> 14 DAVID J. GETSY Figure 4. Aimé-Jules Dalou, Victor Noir (1889–1891), bronze, 190 × 97 × 28 cm. Père- Lachaise Cemetery, Paris. to a similar conclusion about the performance of stillness: “With the doll  we were forced to assert ourselves, for, had we surrendered ourselves to it,  there would then have been no one there at all.”28 For Rilke, the doll forces  us to react—to assert ourselves—in response to its passivity. I will conclude with a brief mention of a doll sculpture that brings  the gendered implications of the performance of stillness and the reac- tive assertion of control to the surface. Amber Hawk Swanson’s 2006–8  Amber Doll project involved the creation of a life-size RealDoll sex doll  in her own image. After Amber Doll was brought into the world, Hawk  Swanson commenced a romantic relationship and a collaborative artistic  partnership with her (figure 5). Hawk Swanson’s aim in this and related  work was to investigate the slipperiness between being victim and vic- timizer, exploring both her self-portrayal as passive object and her role  as controlling agent. She pursued this paradoxical dynamic by staging  a series of events in which she would subject Amber Doll (and, since it  was a self-portrait, herself by implication) to uncontrolled nonart social  situations. She watched her own life-size sculptural image endure as she  </page> <page sequence="15">  ACTS OF STILLNESS 15 purposefully abandoned Amber Doll in such places as a skating rink, a  wedding reception, and a tailgate party (figure 6). As expected, Amber  Doll became the target of sexual violence, but she was also the victim  of the violence of curiosity as liberties were taken with her passive body  by both male and female participants. In an interview with me, Hawk  Swanson remarked that she came to realize that in any such situation  there was—in addition to the bald exercises of sexualized power—always  someone else who would pass by and stop the violation.29 For instance,  while some college-age men were tauntingly exposing Amber Doll’s geni- tals, an older man walked by and scolded them for their actions. His act of  protecting paternalism, however, was also an attempt to control the situ- ation of Amber Doll’s stillness. According to Hawk Swanson, this Good  Samaritan was also fulfilling a desire for mastery over the passive body  and its capacities, just as much as the boys were violating it. I bring in Hawk Swanson’s complex and multistaged project here  because of the ways it hyperbolically plays out the power dynamics of  statues’ passive resistance. Hawk Swanson intentionally produces mor- ally ambivalent and emotionally charged situations, and her works en- mesh viewers in the power dynamics of victimization, whether they are  compelled to protect, curious to examine, or enabled to violate.30 In these  public performances, it is the confrontation with the unmoving body that  Figure 5.

She exaggerated the myths of animation and  of passivity that characterize the history of sculpture, pushing them to  their limits in order to expose the exercise of control that so easily rises to  the surface of any sculptural encounter. Furthermore, Hawk Swanson’s  work shows how quickly gender and sex become central to the content of  these acts of control, as viewers repeatedly chose to focus on Amber Doll’s  body as gendered and sexualized. Hawk Swanson’s example (however  extreme) uses sex and gender to distill the scene of confrontation posed to  the viewer by an unmoving, physically present three-dimensional image  of the body. Her work illustrates how the passive resistance of the sculp- tural body poses an immediate opportunity for the confronted viewers  to use their ability to move, to touch, and to control. They are postulated  </page> <page sequence="17">  ACTS OF STILLNESS 17 as the addressees of an ethical predicament about how to dispense (or to  withhold) power in the face of the passive body. Recasting the statue’s stillness as a resistant act enables one to see more  clearly that the space of the sculptural encounter is a theater of power dy- namics and corporeal relations. In that theater, viewers (and, to an extent,  artists) are faced by passively resistant sculptural bodies, and they engage  in a range of relations and reactions to them as both corporeal images and  physical copresences. These three-dimensional figures are nonhuman  players in this scene, but they nevertheless initiate and make visible the  principles that the viewer calls on when confronted with passivity. The  sculptural encounter, then, has never been just about the disinterested  aesthetic judgments of beauty but also about the ethics of interpersonal  relations. The passive resistance of the immotile statue stands up to the  motile viewer, leaving them in the position of choosing how to act. In  order to undertake a more comprehensive, extensive account of the his- tory of art and aesthetics, we must attend to the ethics that underwrite  viewers’ finding of themselves in a position to wield or withhold degrees  of power. Sculpture’s particular interlacing of physicality and representa- tion in three dimensions animates this theater of power relations and its  potential for actual bodily contact. It is incumbent to examine the patterns in the history of sculpture and  its literature of justification in order to challenge the ways in which the  statue’s acts make visible larger cultural forces. Many sculptural encoun- ters may be neutral or uninteresting in this regard, but it is imperative to  have an account of the limit cases (of vandalism, of the sexual caress, of  the antagonistic kick) that are normally seen as beyond the bounds of the  aesthetics of sculpture. They are merely the more extreme manifestations  of the ethical predicaments that arise when viewers are confronted with a  statue’s acts of stillness. David J.

See also the later expansion of some of these issues in Barbara Johnson’s persons and things  (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2008), which explores animation and the in- animate in a wide range of cultural texts. Most pertinent to the present analysis is Johnson’s  discussion of the role of the Pygmalion myth and of the image of the Classical statue in the  work of nineteenth-century Parnassian poets and their contemporaries (109–30).  3. Sartre saw this as a limitation to be overcome and argued that Alberto Giacometti’s post- war works did this by attempting to render the sculptor’s acts of looking at the model  across a distance. He saw this “leap into the realm of the unreal” as successful because  it made the relation to the material, sculptural object secondary. Nevertheless, it must  be remembered that the viewer still must confront the material and physically present  sculptural body despite the distancing embedded in its image by Giacometti (Jean-Paul  Sartre, “The Quest for the Absolute” [1948], in Jean-paul sartre: essays in existentialism,  ed. Wade Baskin [New York: Citadel Press, 1965], 388–401, quotation on 395).  4. Ibid.  5. This dynamic of the representational statue offers a heightened experience of what Alex  Potts has argued to be a central feature of modern sculptural aesthetics: the sculpture’s  incitement of fantasies of rapport with objects and its concurrent resistance to be other  than an obdurate external thing. He notes, The sculptural object within modern bourgeois aesthetics at one  level suggests the possibility of an object in the external world that is  entirely amenable to the spectator’s projective gaze. . . . At another  level, the sculptural object is so literally separate and alien, an ob- durate thing rather than an amenable image or representation, that  it cannot help but present the flip-side of the phantasy of oneness  with the external world—the experience of the latter as radically  unassimilable to the self’s desires, as hostile threat or barrier to these.

Such valorizations of domination often go unquestioned in the writing about sculpture.  For instance, a recent article by Martin Kayman proposes the “statuesque” as an ana- logue to the “statute” in legal theory and uses the mobility of the viewer as a paradigm  for the civil subject’s capacity for dissent and evaluation of new laws (“The Law and the  Statuesque,” Law critique 24, no. 1 [2013]: 1–22). To summarize his complex argument,  a new law is erected (like a statue) and the motile subject must test the law from different  perspectives in order to create a new account of justice from it and its changes to previ- ous laws. Kayman analogizes this to the history of sculptural aesthetics and the problem  of animation in which an inanimate statue spurs the viewer’s invention of “fictions of  life.” He concludes, “As the experience of the statuesque moves from inert material to an  illusion of animation to material again, we are left, in the end, with the narrative of how  we found life in the thing” (19). While there is much value in Kayman’s sophisticated  argument, his position nevertheless inherits from the history of sculptural aesthetics its  heroization of the motile viewer’s domination of the immotile statue.  15. Alex Potts has seen in Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s pygmalion (1762) a seminal formulation of  this issue. He draws out Rousseau’s foregrounding of narcissism and its projection onto  Galatea: Perhaps inadvertently, Rousseau makes an important point here  about the narcissism inherent in one’s seeing a figurative sculpture  as alive in some way. Insomuch as a sculpture succeeds in evok- ing something living, this happens by way of an enhanced sense of  one’s own physical presence facing the sculpture. Its momentary  resonance is partly an effect of an internalized feeling of being there  provoked by its intrusion on one’s space. There is simultaneously  a narcissistic identification with the imagined figure and a separa- tion and distancing, not the least because it is fixed and inert. This  ambiguity can be pleasurable, but it can also be frustratingly elusive  and dissatisfying.

My usage of intersubjectivity draws on the legacies of object relations in psychoanalysis.  For a useful entry into this literature, see Jessica Benjamin’s Like subjects, Love Objects:  essays on recognition and sexual Difference (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press,  1995), and shadow of the Other: intersubjectivity and Gender in psychoanalysis (New York:  Routledge, 1998).  25. With this more delineated definition of intersubjectivity, one can still see how unequal  and unlike interpersonal confrontations can emerge as transformative. In the case of  prejudice against other persons, for instance, it has been a staple of the literature about  the overcoming of bias that a moment of intersubjectivity can erupt into and destabilize  power-determined interpersonal relations. At this moment, a radical potential for over- coming (or, sadly, redoubling) prejudice is made possible precisely because a recognition  of sameness has afforded the mutuality of the intersubjective.  26. For a different account of performativity in the history and aesthetics of sculpture (in  which the statuary tradition’s construction of bodily ideality is argued to be a performa- tive effect), see Catherine M.

More broadly, Amber Hawk Swanson’s work extends to social media, where commenta- tors on videos of the Amber Doll project perform analogous acts of criticism, control, insult,  and protection on Hawk Swanson herself as its author and artist. For a more extensive  discussion of these aspects of Hawk Swanson’s work, see David Getsy, “Queer Exercises:  Amber Hawk Swanson’s Performances of Self-Realization,” GLQ 19, no. 4 (2013): 465–85.  31. Consequently, the art-historical context for this aspect of Hawk Swanson’s practice  would be the work of earlier performance artists who adopted passivity and posed moral  predicaments to viewers by making their bodies into unmoving objects—like statues. I  am thinking, in particular, of Yoko Ono’s cut piece (orig. 1964), Scott Burton’s self-work:  Dream (1969), Marina Abramovic’s rhythm 0 (orig. 1974), and Chris Burden’s Back to  You (1974).  32. In this regard, Hawk Swanson aims to produce difficulty—in the sense of the term  lucidly examined in Jennifer Doyle’s Hold it Against Me: Difficulty and emotion in con- temporary Art (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2013). </page> </plain_text>
