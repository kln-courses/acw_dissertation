<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AMERICAN FOLK CHURCH IN NORTHEAST ARKANSAS William M. Clements Because of its centrality in the culture, American religion has been studied by scholars such as anthropologists, historians, psychologists, sociologists, and theologians. Yet folklorists- although their skills and knowledge are intensely relevant to the study of the religious dimension of culture-have not dealt extensively with American religion. To be sure, they have published collections of spiritual folksongs, cycles of religious legends, descriptions of rituals and festivals, and transcripts of folk ser- mons.' However, they have not adequately treated folk religion as a system; the work of most folklorists has been directed atomistically at the folklore of religious groups rather than at folk religion per se. Two explanations may be offered for the relative neglect of folk religion by folklorists. First, religion does not fit any of the neat categories which folklorists have devised to account for folklore material. When the term "folklore" is meant to include only oral literature, material folk arti- facts, and those beliefs that lend themselves to pithy, formalized verbal- izations, folk religion as a system has no place. The same holds true when "folklore" refers to a particular kind of communicative event. The folk- lorist can include folk religion among his interests only when he expands his concerns to encompass the totality of a level of culture.2 A second reason for folkloristic neglect of folk religion may be the absence of significant groundwork in the field. An attempt to define "folk religion" has appeared in print only recently,3 and no comprehensive overview of American folk religion has yet been published. Before treatments of specific elements of folk religion-songs, narratives, rituals, festivals, and sermons-can be meaningful, an overview is essential as a mechanism for integrating the specific elements into systems. It is the purpose here to provide an overview, applicable to American folk Protestantism, as mani- fested in an idealized religious group, the folk church. Folklore is 161</page><page sequence="2">William M. Clements considered to be unofficial culture, so folk religion is unofficial religion, that system of behavior and belief existing apart from the power structure in a community.4 My overview arises out of fieldwork conducted among religious groups in northeast Arkansas. The research, which began in 1972, is still con- tinuing, but the most intensive activity occurred during the summers of 1972 and 1973. Field research focused on churches in Craighead County, an area lying in the flatlands halfway between the Mississippi River and the Ozark Mountains. Agricultural wealth has created an unusually high level of income for many residents of this county, especially those living in Jonesboro, its principal city. The high average income contributes to Jonesboro's atypicality as a southern community, and its distinctiveness is reinforced by the presence of significant industry, including an elec- tronics firm and a printing plant, and a low proportion of blacks (about twelve percent) in the total population. While Jonesboro provided the center for research, most of the churches investigated existed on the city's social, economic, political, and even geographical periphery. People who attended these churches are those who find mainline religious bodies unresponsive to their needs. Despite the geographical delimitations of my field research, ample evidence suggests that the results of that research reflect what is typical of American Protestant folk churches in general. My casual contact with folk religion in western Texas and southern Indiana supports generaliza- tions developed from the data gathered in northeast Arkansas. The denominational groupings which I investigated are at opposite poles on the Protestant theological continuum. Observations which are applicable to both Baptists, who ultimately derive their doctrines from particularistic Calvinism, and Pentecostals, who have inherited the Arminian teachings of free will and free grace,5 would very probably characterize any groups whose theologies fall between these doctrinal extremes. Hence, the traits which I have suggested as characteristic of Protestant folk churches in northeast Arkansas have nationwide applicability. The study of Baptist and Pentecostal folk churches in northeast Arkansas involved a number of field research procedures. Participant observation was essential. In order to obtain the desired overview of American folk religion, as many churches as possible were visited as many times as possible. I observed congregations at regular weekend worship services, during revival meeting periods, and on special occasions such as music performances. Formal interviews with preachers and laymen from the churches supplemented observation by providing participants' com- mentary on the activities I had witnessed and personal accounts of 162</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN FOLK CHURCH individual religious experiences. Casual conversation with worshipers at services also afforded useful information, for many who have enjoyed religious pleasures are eager to share their experiences with others. Finally, the mass media offered relevant data. Radio broadcasts by folk preachers and printed tracts from sectarian presses are a part of the folk Christian's religious life and can be easily analyzed by the researcher. Employing information obtained through these methods, I have attempted to construct an overview of American Protestant folk religion. The overview consists of a list of ten traits which field research has suggested to be typical of folk churches. I compiled a preliminary list at the conclusion of research in the summer of 1972. I then tested and modi- fied my preliminary findings during further contact with folk churches during the summer of 1973. The list was deemed satisfactory only when it allowed prediction of behavior at religious activities and of response from interview subjects. Two points must be kept in mind regarding this list of traits. First, it is totally the result of field research. Although sociologists have drawn up similar lists,6 the traits they isolated reflect the basic questions of sociological research and are of only secondary utility for folklorists. However, information from sociological literature, as well as other scholarly and popular sources, has been employed to ensure the applicability of my findings beyond the immediate field experience. Second, none of the traits in my list defines a group as a folk church; all are secondary and descriptive. It is very possible for a folk church to possess none of the traits, and, in fact, probably no folk church possesses them all. Furthermore, a mainline church may possess some of the traits. A folk church differs from a mainline church only in its rela- tionship to a community's power structure. The overview discussed here represents what is typical of an idealized folk church. The traits comprising my overview arise from both belief and be- havior. In essence, the characteristics which one will generally encounter at American folk churches are orientation toward the past, scriptural literalism, consciousness of Providence, emphasis on evangelism, infor- mality, emotionalism, moral rigorism, sectarianism, egalitarianism, and relative isolation of church plants. Each of these traits will be discussed in some detail. Orientation Toward the Past A recent discussion of folk culture in America relates to an important trait of the folk church. Attempting to delineate an American approach to the folklife and material culture studies long a part of European 163</page><page sequence="4">William M. Clements folkloristics, Henry Glassie has described folk culture as encompassing traditional, or conservative, deviations from the popular, normative cul- ture of mainstream Americans. Although most Americans are exposed to this normative culture, some reject all or part of it. Glassie considers alternatives to the normative culture which are oriented toward the past as folk.7 Much American folk religion is past-oriented, for Baptist and Pente- costal groups are proud to preserve the "Old-Time Religion." For example, Jonesboro's Strawfloor Baptist Church has even set a Sunday aside annually as "Old-Fashioned Day." The 1972 affair, which I attend- ed, featured a display of antiques, a highly evangelistic preaching service, dinner on the grounds, and an afternoon of gospel singing and such amusements as horseshoe pitching. One of my informants, who had pastored a number of Baptist churches throughout northeast Arkansas, told me that a major difference between his churches and mainline churches was that his congregations had "stayed with the old-fashioned way of worship." While mainline churches have become "more modern- ized," the folk churches have preserved the ways of the past, especially in their "prayers and altar calls."8 Another Baptist preacher asserted: Our type of worship-I'd say the type of service that we would probably worship-now I can-now I can remember back thirty years. And our type of worship hasn't changed. We have air conditioning we didn't have back then. We have a lot of comfortable things. We're going to have padded pews here [in his church] in a couple of weeks to sit in. We'll have plush carpet out here, but that will have no effect on the type of service we have. I told our people-I said, "Now folks, we're going to be-we're going to have as fine a church as anybody around here. We're going to have a plush building." But I said, "We're going to be down-to-earth people. Our message is not going to change; our attitude's not going to change."9 Even a few visits to worship services and casual contacts with wor- shipers confirm the assertions of the folk religionists, for there exists a striking similarity between modern American folk religion and the country's mainline religion at the beginning of the twentieth century. For example, Herbert Wallace Schneider's comparison of American religion in 1950 with that in 1900 noted a shift "from catechism to discussion, from ten commandments to critical debate, and from evangelistic appeals 164</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN FOLK CHURCH to social propaganda, from revivals to lobbies."10 Schneider failed to realize that the religion of 1900 still flourished in folk churches in 1950- and in the 1970s. Focusing particularly on southern religion, Kenneth K. Bailey joined Schneider in recognizing vast changes in American religion during the past century and in ignoring the folk churches, which have remained virtually immune to those changes." In fact, southern religion at all levels has been notably conservative. According to W. J. Cash, as a demonstration of regional chauvinism responding to religious liberalism and apostasy in the North, "it fell out inevitably that the religion of the South was brought over to the twentieth century as simple, as completely supernatural and Apocalyptic, as it had been in the earliest decades of the nineteenth, and far more rigidly held, far more pugnacious and assertive, far more impervious to change."' Yet the hostility toward the Yankee has abated in the more than thirty-five years since Cash was writing, and mainline churches in the South as elsewhere have left the burden of preserving the Old-Time Religion to the folk churches. Indeed the folk churches have maintained a semblance of traditionality; the claims of folk Christians that the old-fashioned ways survive in their doctrines and procedures are generally valid. Scriptural Literalism The predominant trait in the belief component of the ideal American folk church is a literalist approach to interpreting the Bible. As a Baptist minister told me, "The first thing I'd like to say is that we believe that the Bible is the final authority on all questions, now."'3 The belief in biblical infallibility has both positive and negative ramifications, for ideally folk Christians believe unquestioningly all that the Bible says and reject what it prohibits or omits. On one hand, a Pentecostal minister can claim, "We... believe in-in everything that the Bible does teach. We disregard none of it."'1 To this a Holiness pastor adds, "if we stray from the Bible, why, we have no chart or compass to go by. Just like a ship out in the ocean without a chart or compass-they wouldn't know which way to turn. And I feel like that's the way with any religion. If we leave the teaching-plain teaching of the Bible-there's nothing to go by." 5 At the same time many folk Christians willingly accept the dictum laid out by Thomas Campbell in 1809: "Where the Scriptures speak, we speak; where they are silent, we are silent"'6 Campbell's negative literalism has been carried to its extreme by Churches of Christ, who oppose the use of instrumental music during worship services, the designation of ministers by the title "Reverend," and the naming of churches according to anything other than 165</page><page sequence="6">William M. Clements their geographical locations. The New Testament-or "New Bible" as many folk Christians call it-fails to mention these practices as part of the procedures of the early church. Through their scriptural literalism folk churches accept one of the five points of Fundamentalism adopted at the Niagara Bible Conference in 1895. Hence, many folk Christians assume the appellation "Funda- mentalist" without necessarily accepting all the tenets of the theological position which developed from reactions to the growth of Modernism, the higher criticism of the Bible, and the Social Gospel. Pentecostals stress their scriptural literalism by claiming that only their message warrants being called the "Full Gospel." Although scriptural literalism manifests itself in many ways among folk churches in general, one example, the anthropomorphic conceptions of God and Satan, will serve to illustrate. Folk Christians have reversed God's act of creating man in his image by conceiving of their deity in anthropomorphic terms. Although none have gone so far as to describe his physical form as like that of a human, they perceive God as thinking, feeling, and behaving in a human manner. A Pentecostal minister conceived of God as possessing emotions much like those of his creatures: I won't rule out the emotions because God's an emotional god. God's got feelings. You know, some of them-some people that have an old stone god sitting up there, you know-but God's a god of feeling. You know, he has jealousy; he has wrath; he has loving kindness, gentleness. Even, you know, when Jesus was baptized of John the Baptist in the River Jordan, it so pleased the heavenly Father that he thundered from the heavens, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased." God's emotional. God has feeling. I wouldn't want to serve him if he was something sitting up there couldn't- couldn't have a feeling toward me. I wouldn't want to serve him. The same informant viewed God as accessible to direct conversation. In prayer sessions, he related, "I've even pulled a chair up here-just said, 'Lord, I want you to sit down in that chair. I want to talk to you awhile.' "17 A layman had a similar conception of his personal relationship with God: "And me and the Lord-we have some pretty good talks."'8 While folk Christians may not literally advocate the notion that God has a human form and can be heard and seen as he was in Old Testament mythology, they certainly believe that he resembles man in intellectual and affective qualities. 166</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN FOLK CHURCH For folk Christians Satan is every bit as real as God. Their anthro- pomorphic conception of this being was evident at a Pentecostal church in Jonesboro which I visited. As I entered the foyer of the church, I saw a large satanic representation in paper posted on a bulletin board. Display- ing the traditional horns, goatee, and pointed tail,19 the figure exhibited a prominent turned-down mouth and bore the caption, "Don't let the devil smile." A frequent target for sermons, Satan may be blamed by folk Christians for everything from the war in Vietnam to physical illnesses, personal moral lapses, and even the cold formality of mainline churches. Some of my informants even saw diabolical forces as the cause of a devastating tornado that swept through Jonesboro in May 1973. Positing a Job-like agreement, one contended that God allowed the hellish wind- storm to effect vast property damage, but that Satan had to obey the injunction, "Hold off now just a little while. Don't bother my people."20 The image of God and Satan dividing up the contents of Jonesboro, Arkansas, graphically emphasizes the anthropomorphic conceptualiza- tions of these supernatural beings. Kenneth K. Bailey writes, "Nowhere else [except in the South] . . . is there a Protestant population of equal size so renowned for its piety or for its commitment to old-fashioned Scriptural literalism.'"2 This state- ment could apply to Protestant folk religion throughout the country. Even casual conversation with folk Christians reveals that most have an enor- mous supply of scriptural quotations to serve as "proof-texts" for what they believe. The Bible, alone and without elaborate exegesis, stands as the purported foundation for the doctrines of the ideal folk church. Consciousness of Providence In his discussion of the folklore of colonial New England, Richard M. Dorson suggests as one major genre accounts of the direct workings of God in the affairs of men. The Puritans saw their role in the New World as a divinely ordained mission. Hence, everything that befell them for good or ill was interpreted as providential.22 Though Jonesboro, Arkansas, is removed in time, space, and theology from Massachusetts Bay, folk Christians there still view God as intervening directly in human affairs on both individual and group bases. For example, a personal manifesta- tion of Providence occurred when a Pentecoastal minister who needed an automobile was placed in a position to obtain one inexpensively. Like many other folk Christians he believed God to be responsive to any human need-spiritual, mental, physical, financial. My informants perceived a community-oriented providential act in floods which ravaged Rapid 167</page><page sequence="8">William M. Clements City, South Dakota, in the early summer of 1972. During a Sunday school class a Baptist laywoman insisted that the floods were evidence of God's displeasure with the South Dakota city. The intervention of God in the individual's life occurs during the crisis conversion which most folk Christians must undergo. This mystical experience reveals to the subject God's direct involvement in human affairs and special concern for man's spiritual state. Other manifestations of providential interest in individuals appear when Pentecostals exercise divinely inspired glossolalia as well as other miraculous powers through the agency of the Holy Ghost, a member of the Christian Trinity. Of these miraculous powers the one sought most assiduously and accepted most gratefully is that of healing. Every Pentecostal believes in faith healing, and most have been healed through divine power, if only of minor ailments such as headaches and pulled muscles. Usually each evening service in a Pentecostal folk church-when time limitations do not necessitate the dismissal of the congregation by noon-includes a period during which those in need of physical healing may undergo the requisite ritual. The ritual procedure has been adopted from James 5:14: "Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord." Pentecostal healing procedure, then, consists of the afflicted person approaching the altar, of the laying on of hands by anyone in the church who has the faith to heal, of anointing the subject with a few drops of cooking oil, and of loud, simultaneous prayer by all involved. Among cures which my informants report to have been effected in this manner are remedies for heart trouble, appendicitis, nosebleed, curvature of the spine, and cancer.23 Healing represents only one of the individual manifestations of providential activity recognized by folk Christians, but it is perhaps the most dramatic. At the same time Providence may act on a community level affecting a number of people. A good example of such a perception of Providence emerged in my informants' interpretations of the divine meaning of a tornado which struck Jonesboro on 27 May 1973, causing substantial property damage but without loss of life or serious injury in the city. The essence of the folk Christians' view can be distilled into five categories. They perceived the tornado as divine punishment for sin, as a reminder of the transitory nature of material possessions, as a reminder of God's awesome power, as a demonstration of Satan's power, or as evidence of God's protective care.24 Significantly, no folk Christian whom I asked about the tornado denied that supernatural power played some vital part. Providence is real and active for folk Christians. They depend upon 168</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN FOLK CHURCH God for many necessities - not only spiritual ones - and attribute virtually everything happening to them to providential causation. Frank Lawrence Owsley makes the pertinent observation that a striking feature of the religion of the plain folk of the South was that it represented "a joyous religion proclaiming a loving and familiar God, a God who watched over the lives of His poor, earthly creatures with such care that He marked the sparrow's fall."25 One of my Pentecostal informants pithily characterized the notion of providential involvement in human affairs by saying, "There's no such thing as luck in the Christian life."26 Emphasis on Evangelism The ideal American folk church is evangelistic in all respects-that is, its members devote themselves primarily to helping others attain religious experiences and thus become members of the church themselves. Folk Christians demonstrate exclusive concern for the individual's salvation rather than the amelioration of society as a whole. During tape-recorded interviews I asked ministers of folk churches whether their primary career goal was to save souls or to pastor to the congregation of folk Christians. Although all recognized their pastoral responsibilities, most cited the winning of new Christians as the ultimate aim of their ministries. One Pentecostal minister assured me, "I can answer you without hesitation. The greatest blessing I receive is when I reach a man for Christ."27 Another Pentecostal preacher asserted, "If I'd have one thing in mind, I'd like to be a soul-winner for Jesus."28 Even the few ministers who put pastoral work above evangelism for themselves realized that the final product of their pastoral nurture would be a congregation ready to go into the world evangelizing on their own. Evangelism appears both in worship services and in everyday activities of folk Christians. For example, every worship service in a folk church culminates in an altar call, during which sinners have the opportunity to come forward and accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior. In fact, most services seem to be aimed toward the altar call, which often occurs as the congregation sings an appropriate hymn while the minister pleads for converts. At times the hymn may be stopped, and as the congregation stands with bowed heads, the minister asks those who are seeking salvation to raise their hands. He then promises special prayers for these individuals. Also, members of the congregation may seek out those whom they know to be unsaved and personally beg them to heed the altar call. This period of invitation to Christian discipleship may last ten or fifteen minutes and is a part of every worship service in a folk church, even when it is apparent 169</page><page sequence="10">William M. Clements that few if any in the audience have not already become Christians. Yet evangelism does not occur from the pulpit in formal situations of worship, for every folk Christian is expected to win souls for Christ during his daily affairs as well as in the worship context. In the first place, every folk Christian must be proud of his commitment and be willing to demon- strate it publicly. For instance, I have attended several worship services where all who were saved were asked to stand or to raise their hands, and potential informants have assured me of their willingness to be interviewed because they were not "ashamed to confess Jesus." Furthermore, all must be ready to "witness" -to tell the world what Christianity means to them either in public testimony or in informal conversation. Although the public testimonies of folk Christians are usually set pieces and only in- frequently mention specifics of the individuals' religious experiences, they operate as another opportunity for evangelistic endeavor. Also, folk Christians may engage in organized efforts to evangelize a community. One of my Baptist informants described such a program: "Tonight we'll have an organized visitation program. Our men will go out. We'll just double up with two, and we'll go out tonight and go in people's homes and-and visit with them and, you know-and witness. We will witness to them about what we believe.""29 The net result of all evangelical activities is supposed to be victory forJesus in the souls of all men. The folk church is the "church militant," fighting to win over new Christians and save them from the horrible torments of Hell. Informality When asked about differences between their folk churches and large mainline churches, many informants cited the cold formality of the latter and the warm spontaneity of their own services. As a Pentecostal preacher told me, People-you see people, you know--these churches. Well, it's so cold in them you could nearly skate up and down the aisles. You know, they-they don't have any feeling. They- they, you know-I believe sometimes if people'd tell the truth about it, they'd just like to get up and say, "Preacher, shut your mouth. Sit down for awhile. You're not telling me nothing. You're not meeting my needs. You're not ministering to me. Lead us in worship. We don't want to just"--you know-you know, when you walk in the door, and they hand you a little 170</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN FOLK CHURCH piece of paper. "We're going to sing this one, and we're going to sing that one. Brother so-and-so's going to pray. We're going to take the offering here. We're going to have a little message here. We're going to-we're going to have the bene- diction. We're going to have the--the postlude, you know, and [laughter] we're going to have the 'ludes. And we're going to let you go home." You can't-you just can't program God like that because you-you can't foresee, you know.30 Even a casual comparison of worship services in folk churches with those in mainline churches reveals the striking informality at the folk exercises. For one thing, no printed programs are made available to the casually dressed folk congregation. Most of the worshipers have attended services often enough to know what to expect. In fact, the folk worship service follows a standard format, beginning with a smooth transition from Sunday school to the preaching service-usually at about a quarter till eleven for morning exercises. The Sunday school superintendent is the first officiant, and he reports the number who have attended that morning and the amount of the collection. He also leads the congregation in recognizing birthday and wedding anniversaries which have occurred during the week. While "Happy Birthday" is sung, the honorees come forward to make a special offering. The superintendent then turns the service over to the songleader. Backed by a choir composed of people who come forward out of the congregation, the songleader directs several hymns, most of which were written during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The song service ends with special music by soloists or ensembles and with the introduction of the preacher. After an offering is collected, a lay member of the congregation delivers an offertory prayer. Now comes a lengthy prayer. Prayer requests are accepted. In Baptist churches the preacher or a layman intercedes for the entire congregation, who stand or sit with heads bowed, but in Pentecostal churches all worshipers pray aloud simultaneously. The preaching, which occurs next, usually occupies half an hour-much longer than in most mainline churches. The preacher generally reads a passage of scripture, expounds upon it, and then applies it to the evangelistic mission of the church. Stylistically, the preaching is declamatory and vociferous with passages of rhythmic chanting at emotion- al peaks.31 Urged on by a responsive congregation, the preacher builds to a climactic call for converts, no matter what the substance of the original scripture passage might have been. The informality of the whole affair is evidenced when noisy children are allowed to go unrestrained and even adults evince no hesitation about visiting the restroom during 171</page><page sequence="12">William M. Clements the preaching. After the preacher has completed his delivery, the period of invitation begins. Then, announcements are made before a layman dis- misses the congregation with a prayer. This fivefold worship sequence-superintendent's preface, singing, prayer, preaching, invitation-applies basically even to evening services, which are usually much longer than the morning activities. Yet the broad nature of the elements in the sequence allows for much flexibility and total congregational involvement in the proceedings. The leading of the Holy Ghost rather than the fixity of liturgy supposedly controls conduct at folk religious exercises. As one of my Baptist informants observed, "We're getting away from a lot of this starch."32 Emotionalism One of the striking features distinguishing folk religious behavior from that observed in mainline churches is the relatively unrestrained emotionalism. Rejoicing in their salvation or moved by the Holy Ghost, folk Christians allow their feelings complete release during worship services and other religious activities. At the extreme are Pentecostals, who not only accept but even require emotional expression in worship. For instance, preaching may be repeatedly interrupted by congregational cries of "Praise the Lord," "Hallelujah," "Jesus, Jesus," "Thank you, Jesus," and "That's right," punctuated by clapping and waving of hands. The preacher encourages such responsiveness and may devote a good deal of his performance energy toward stirring up the congregation. And it is not only during preaching that folk Christians evince emotionalism. As a thirteen-year member of a Holiness group in the Appalachians told John Fetterman, "Whenever the Lord moves you, you shout."33 During singing, testimonies, or healing, someone in a folk congregation may emit some sort of spontaneous vocalization. Besides shouting, other manifestations of emotionalism include dancing, "the jerks," and trances. Dancing usually occurs during the sing- ing of hymns and consists primarily of a few shuffling steps at the subject's spot in the congregation. However, I have observed individuals break into a dance during a testimony and shuffle across the sanctuary as they tearfully praised God. The jerks is an emotional phenomenon usually associated with the Second Awakening of the 1800s along the trans-Appa- lachian frontier. Although I have not seen jerking in the intensity which occurred at nineteenth-century camp meetings, it is not uncommon to see folk Christians moving spasmodically under the power of their emotions. Trances-"falling out in the power"-do not happen as frequently as 172</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN FOLK CHURCH other overt emotional behavior. However, they do occur, usually when the subject is the center of attention as during healing rituals. In addition to these dramatic expressions of emotionalism, more subtle demonstrations of feeling emerge in folk religious behavior. Even the most staid of Baptists, who are more restrained in general than Pentecostals, comment loudly at particularly important points during preaching with an approving "Amen"-the "amen hit or miss" of nine- teenth-century camp meetings.34 To varying degrees, then, folk churches are characterized by emotionalism. The complete involvement of the individual in religious experiences helps to explain this feature of behavior. Moral Rigorism Ideally, the American folk church advocates a strict and conservative moral code. Any activities expressly proscribed by the New Testament are, of course, forbidden, but prohibitions extend much further. One might expect censure of such sins as drinking, dancing, and gambling since many conservative mainline churches frown on these activities. The folk church, however, goes so far as to reproach members for doing anything which interferes with their serving God on a fulltime basis. For example, a Pentecostal preacher may seem excessive in suggesting from his pulpit that it is impossible for a true Christian to own a television set. Yet a Baptist echoed this position when he provided me with an illustration of a Chris- tian's yielding to his "carnal" nature: "For example, there are times when I'm, you know-a Christian would say, 'Well, I'm going to throw my heels up here and watch television tonight. I'm not going to church.' "35 An- other Pentecostal preacher told a story during his sermon about a young man who had strayed from righteous conduct by being tempted to play high school football. Fortunately, the young man had recovered from his error and was now a minister. In addition to supporting rigorous moral standards for individuals, preachers in folk churches may fulminate against the collective sins of American society. "Old-Fashioned Day" in 1972 at the Strawfloor Baptist Church afforded the preacher an opportunity to deal with the Old-Time Religion and its moral standard. Using Jeremiah 6:9-16 as his text, he illustrated his jeremiad on contemporary moral decay by citing recent United States Supreme Court decisions which abolished capital punish- ment and permitted easy availability of "smut." Pornography-defined very broadly-provides a favorite target for folk preachers. For example, an evangelist during a marathon three-week revival at a Pentecostal church during the summer of 1973 thundered, "Once it was shocking to see a 173</page><page sequence="14">William M. Clements woman with her skirt above her knees on a magazine cover, but now you can see women with no clothes at all and think nothing of it." he coupled this state of decay with the twin threats of "dope and wine." Folk preachers are still upset with the Supreme Court ruling of the nineteen-sixties banning any sort of prayer from public schools. Yet such tendencies toward Godlessness are clear signs of the imminence of the Second Coming. One might note that while folk churches reject a Social Gospel orientation as part of their programs, they do not hesitate to attack public as well as personal sin. The rigorist morality is not only negative in tone. The good Christian must perform certain activities as well as avoid others. He should study the scripture, engage in private prayer, attend worship services as frequently as possible, and witness to non-Christians. Folk congregations observe the Christian duty of contributing funds toward the maintenance and exten- sion of the church often literally to the point of tithing. I noticed at many churches that the offering collected during a service averaged well over a dollar per person in the congregation. Frequently, I saw five and ten dollar bills in the collection plate. Although this kind of financial sacrifice is particularly significant because of the low income of many folk Chris- tians, it is not unusual. Liston Pope reported that in Gastonia, North Carolina, the folk churches patronized by millhands enjoyed a much higher degree of financial support than the mainline churches.36 Although sociologists argue that folk churches' moral rigorism stems from the disadvantaged status of the membership, rigorism continues even as the membership as a body rises in social prestige. This characteris- tic of the American folk church emphasizes the total commitment-both positive and negative-demanded of folk Christians. Sectarianism Although the equation of "folk church" with "sect" when the latter term is used in the sociological sense is untenable, sectarian notions con- stitute a vital segment of the belief and behavior patterns of the American folk church. Sectarianism manifests itself in two ways. First, the churches are sectarian in their rejection of worldliness and worldly behavior. Second, many of the churches view themselves as sole possessors of religious truth. The sectarian attitude toward worldliness on the part of folk churches emerges in the moral rigorism discussed above. Worldly things are dero- gated, especially when they draw a Christian away from total spiritual commitment. A Pentecostal preacher summarized this aspect of sectarianism. 174</page><page sequence="15">AMERICAN FOLK CHURCH "You got to come out from among them and be separate," said the Lord, "and touch not the unclean thing. Then," he said, "I'll receive you." And this is what-this is basically-we believe in the separated life. This doesn't mean go crawl in a cave, but it does mean that we-we believe in living a life that a man'll see Christ in us.37 The other side of sectarianism, denominational exclusivism, does not emerge as clearly in belief and behavior as other characteristics of the folk church. Informants carefully avoided criticizing denominations other than their own. Baptists would sometimes accuse Pentecostals of letting their emotions run away with them, and Pentecostals voiced distress at the coldness and formality of worship procedure in many churches. However, in sermons and in casual comments from the pulpit, folk preachers occasionally revealed some lack of toleration for others. At the extreme are those who believe that only members of a particular denomination will experience salvation. Not only do these folk Christians exclude Jews, Roman Catholics, and other non-Protestants from God's grace, but they even view members of other Protestant folk churches as bound for damna- tion. Yet those folk Christians taking a more moderate stand find little of value in the beliefs and rituals of other groups. For example, a Baptist minister deplored a local church's attempts to increase membership by wooing people from other Baptist churches, but found nothing wrong in searching for new Baptists among other denominations. Pentecostals may also subtly criticize other groups. One preacher, telling his congregation that a member of the Church of Christ had tuned the piano in their sanctuary, commented that if the piano tuner's church would employ instrumental music, they might have some shouting.38 At another time, when the emotional fervor of his congregation began to lag, the same preacher reminded them, "This is not a Presbyterian service." An Appa- lachian informant of John Fetterman epitomized the interdenominational rivalry of folk churches: "They are good people, but the Baptist don't believe like the Holiness does. They wear this makeup . . . cut their hair. And wearing shorts. Drinkin', I guess. They claim they're Christians."39 Egalitarianism In his discussion of the Old-Time Religion as folk religion, George Pullen Jackson emphasized that one pertinent aspect of American religion of the late 1700s and early 1800s was the equality of all participants.40 Journalist Archie Robertson concurs by noting that a special feature of this 175</page><page sequence="16">William M. Clements religion was its insistence on the " 'competence of the individual,' the ability of each soul to deal directly with its Creator."4' This situation still holds true for modern American folk churches, for while the preachers may enjoy some prestige, in most groups they participate in no closer a relationship with the supernatural than do the laity. The doctrine of the "priesthood of all believers,"42 an ideal characteristic of most of Protestant- ism, flourishes in folk religious groups; preachers often have no more spiritual or administrative authority than their congregations. Yet folk preachers view this feature of their churches quite positively. A Pentecostal pastor told me, "God never saved us to be served. I'm a servant. I'm not to be served in this church, but I'm a servant of my people to serve them and to meet their needs."43 Egalitarianism also appears in the forms of address preferred by folk preachers. "Brother' or "Sister" always precedes the given name or surname of an individual. As a Baptist remarked, "I personally like the word 'Brother' above everything. Now, you know, that gives you a good, close, warm feeling. See, if I can sit down and talk to a Christian man and I can call him 'Brother,' then I feel better about it personally."44 Folk churches represent the tendency, observed by Don Yoder among the Pennsylvania Dutch, of "Americanizing or democratizing of inherited European religious patterns."45 Assuredly the egalitarianism of American folk churches parallels the goal of class- lessness which characterizes American secular life. Relative Isolation of Church Plants While it may seem a minor trait when compared to others in this overview, the sites upon which folk Christians have built their places of worship are distinctive. Generally folk churches stand apart from a community's center of political, social, and economic activity. The main street is reserved for the edifices of mainline religion, and folk churches appropriate portions of communities in less proximity to the architectural symbols of the power structure. The situation inJonesboro illustrates this. In addition to banks, various businesses long established in the city, the courthouse, and a federal office building, Main Street-south to north -provides the loci for the First Presbyterian Church, the Central Baptist Church, the First Christian Church, the First Methodist Church, and the First Baptist Church, the largest and most prominent churches in town Folk churches are located along highways on the outskirts of town, in lower/middle-class suburban areas, and throughout the Arkansas country- side. 176</page><page sequence="17">AMERICAN FOLK CHURCH There are, though, some exceptions to the geographical distribution between folk and mainline churches. The increasing significance of subur- ban living-socially and economically-even in small cities has resulted in construction of mainline churches away from Main Street. Another possible exception to the relative isolation of folk churches occurs in economically disadvantaged sections of major urban centers where folk congregations occupy abandoned buildings in the heart of economic and social affairs. Yet the general geographical distribution of mainline and folk churches reflects the associations of the congregations with the power structure. The proximity of mainline churches to the sources of their economic and social support corresponds to the folk churches' isolation from official secular institutions. The existence of ten traits characterizing the ideal American folk church suggests that even if folk religion is defined according to its rela- tionship to a community's power structure, it does possess distinctive features. The nature of these features and their role in shaping American religion in general are topics of concern to the folklorist. The formulation of this overview indicates the folk church's potential as a significant institution in American life. This paper, then, aims to erect a framework upon which it is hoped future scholarship in American folk religion can be based.46 Each of the traits discussed here deserves separate study in order to determine its history and influence on American religion. Questions deal- ing with origins, functions, and dynamics of American folk religion also merit consideration. Arkansas State University State University, Arkansas APPENDIX: INFORMANTS A.

NOTES Consider the following examples: for songs- Don Yoder, Pennsylvania Spirituals (Lancaster, Penn.: Pennsylvania Folklife Society, 1961); for legends-Austin and Alta Fife, Saints of Sage and Saddle, Folklore Among the Mormons (1956; reprint ed., Gloucester, Mass.: Peter Smith, 1966); for rituals and festivals-Steven M. Kane, "Ritual Possession in a Southern Appalachian Religious Sect," Journal of American Folklore 87 (1974): 293-302; for sermons-Bruce A. Rosenberg, The Art of the American Folk Preacher (New York: Columbia University Press, 1970). 2 This implies that the "folk-cultural" approach to characterizing "folklore" is essential if religion as a system is to be material for folkloristic study. For a philosophy of the folk-cultural approach, see Henry Glassie, Pattern in the Material Folk Culture of the Eastern United States (Phil- adelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1968). 3 Don Yoder, "Toward a Definition of Folk Religion," Western Folklore 33(1974): 2-15. 4 Cf. Yoder's definition: "Folk religion is the totality of all those views and practices of religion that exist among the people apart from and alongside the strictly theological and liturgical forms of the official religion," in "Toward a Definition of Folk Religion," p. 14. In this paper, I contrast the folk church with what may be called the "mainline church"- the representative of the power structure's official religion. For a discussion of usage of the term "mainline" in a religious context, see Martin E. Marty, A Nation of Behavers (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1976), pp. 52-54. 5 The characterization of Baptist theology does not apply to all Baptist groups in America; Free Will Baptists for instance, are an exception. However. the vast majority of American Baptists evince at least the vestiges of particularistic Calvinism. See Robert G.
