<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Measure of Perfection: Phrenology and the Fine Arts in America. By CHARLES COLBERT. (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1997. xvi, 441p. Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index. Cloth, $55.00; paper, $24.95.) Charles Colbert's A Measure of Perfection offers readers an engaging and most revealing view of "half-world" nineteenth-century American cultural politics, especially of the antebellum period. In detailing the history of the vogue for phrenology which gripped Americans in the 1830s and 1840s, and especially in probing the interconnectedness of phrenology with a variety of other cultural discourses, Colbert makes a fascinating contribution to our understanding of the way antebellum Americans conceived of themselves and their world. His particular concern with the influence of phrenology on the fine arts provides, moreover, a substantial corrective to, as well as an enhancement of, our interpretation of nineteenth-century sculpture and, to a lesser extent, painting. We are treated, in sum, to a tour of the largely neglected byways of the "progress" of middle-class culture. As the book's title implies, interest in phrenology was tangled in fundamental</page><page sequence="2">116 BOOK REVIEWS January/April contradictions, at the source of which was the impulse to measure?to quantify?what was by definition fundamentally immeasurable. The rising middle class ethos was committed to materializing conceptions of social and cultural perfection which had traditionally been the province of the spirit, an endeavor viewed by many as reflecting an overweening ambition and hubris. Colbert begins his account with the complaint of John Quincy Adams against "phrenology and animal magnetism" as movements which, among other "new revelations and prophecies" of the day, furnish "some plausible rascality as an ingredient for the bubbling cauldron of religion and politics" (p. 1). Colbert links the interest in phrenology to the Enlightenment's desire for transparency in all things, a desire fulfilled in the particular notion that "external bodily attributes"?bumps on the head, facial features, body types?"disclose unambiguous meaning" (p. xi). Yet, as he goes on to note, the romantic worldview was by contrast one which necessarily embraced diversity. The Enlightenment dream of a monolithic truth, of an all encompassing mind by which to validate experimental evidence, was clearly an impossible one. So phrenology and its ideological confreres?including the study of physiognomy, mesmerism, spiritualism, and Swedenborgianism?were left to fight for attention and acceptance within the expanding marketplace of ideas and causes that constituted the crucible of the bourgeois worldview. Nonetheless, as Colbert makes blindingly clear, the idea that thought could be compartmentalized, that particular faculties such as "Amativeness," "Acquisitiveness," "Veneration," and "Benevolence" could be located at specific points along the convolutions of the brain (p. 3) and that the head could thus be mapped with an extraordinary exactitude, found very fertile ground in America. Seeds sown by Johann Caspar Lavater and Franz Joseph Gall in Europe and transported to America in the 1820s and 1830s by Johann Gaspar Spurzheim and George Combe quickly took root in a loam fortified by nationalistic pretensions to exceptionalism, progress, and perfection. They were watered by the doctrine of correspondence, as distilled most distinctly in the writings of Swedenborg. There was a literalism and underlying materialism about the pervasive tendency to mirror the spiritual world in the material to which Ralph Waldo Emerson took great exception. Emersonian Transcendentalism, as Colbert points out, put mind and spirit first and promoted a dynamic and dialectical approach to experience. By contrast, the popular culture of the period was profoundly committed to collapsing the intangible aspects of life into categories accessible to a nascent scientific outlook For all their seeming wackiness in our eyes, phrenology, physiognomy, phrenomagnetism, and kindred strains of pseudoscience clearly paved the way for the ascendancy of positivism, Social Darwinism, and the "somatic" style of medicine in the late nineteenth century, issuing in the likes of S. Weir Mitchell's notorious "rest cure" as well as the popular water cure and mind cure movements. Colbert doesn't follow up on all of these implications and repercussions but his</page><page sequence="3">1999 BOOK REVIEWS 117 account does provide abundant evidence for the notion that physical health was the key to a national character which would usher in the millennium. If physical condition both sustained and reflected moral condition (according to the prevailing doctrine of correspondence), then healthy bodies represented the primary agency whereby the body politic of the nation would be transformed and perfected. Yet this optimistic worldview included a dark side. Phrenology and physiognomy both asserted a hierarchy of physical types and moral characteristics which in effect shut down on diversity in the social field even as it cultivated a democratic ethos among middle-class Americans. If physical culture was presumed to put democratic self realization and success in the rapidly growing market economy within the reach of all Americans, it did so at least in part by effectively consigning women as well as blacks and other ethnic groups?by virtue of their physical attributes?to subordinate, even marginal status, in effect excluding them from full representation in the republic. Colbert is clearly aware of the racist as well as sexist implications of phrenology and related belief systems and social practices but he makes less of the latter than he might have. His emphasis tends to be on their instrumentality in providing aspiring middle-class men and women with compelling models of appearance and clear standards of behavior. This is one place, according to Colbert, where art played a forceful role. At the heart of Colbert's interpretation of the dynamics of antebellum culture is his lengthy reinterpretation of the significance of Hiram Powers's famed Greek Slave (1846). Colbert dismisses standing accounts of the statue's amazing popularity as founded on prurient interest, establishing instead that the Greek slave's body served to model the healthy and spiritually chaste qualities advocated by various health reformers, phrenologists, and physiognomists of the day. Their fulminations against the corset and other modes of constricting and deforming women's bodies in the interest of an increasingly tyrannical fashion gained a powerful objective correlative in Powers's marmoreal wonder which drew women in far greater numbers than men to its crowded showings. Smaller copies of the statue eventually made their way into many a bourgeois home as a reminder of the proper subordination of the physical to the moral and spiritual. On the whole, the white sepulchers (to twentieth-century eyes) of nineteenth-century American sculpture come alive in Colbert's recasting of the meaning of works like Erasmus Dow Palmer's White Captive or Harriet Hosmer's Zenobia in Chains. Such works, as he convincingly shows, were profoundly informed by a knowledge of phrenological and physiognomic signs as well as a deep commitment to the Utopian culture of health. Of course this positive program, shared by middle-class spokespersons of all stripes, depended for much of its energy on the rising insecurity of Americans concerning the fate of their republic at the hands of the market economy and the emerging cityscape, constituting a world of strangers. Deformities in the bodies along with oddities in the cranial structures of individuals appeared as a constant</page><page sequence="4">118 BOOK REVIEWS January/April reminder of such threats to Americans' collective mission and sense of exceptionalism. Colbert places the landscape painting of Asher B. Durand, influential member of the so-called "Hudson River School," in this context. Scenes of a "healthy" nature functioned in a way that paralleled Powers's Greek Slave in their capacity to correspond to the healthy body. Under the personal influence of George Combe, Durand's close observation of nature?championed in his "Letters on Landscape Painting" of the early 1850s?went hand-in-hand with an environmentalism which undergirded his dedication to the role of nature in formulating the national ego. Even more revealingly, the cycle of life and death so commonly depicted in Durand's forest interiors takes on its fullest repercussions here: death emerges as a vital part of life, indeed the mainspring of social and cultural progress, as expressed in the doctrine of successive generation. This was obviously reassuring to Americans anxious to believe that apparent evils must have some ulterior purpose in God's providential plan. Finally, by virtue of correspondence, part in these views of nature is implied to be an integral aspect of whole) just as nature mirrors broader human concerns. Somewhat surprisingly but?along these lines?perfectly reasonably, this naturalism was reconciled to an anthropomorphic, even distinctly allegorical, interpretation of nature in which natural forms voiced the divine monologue promising the ultimate redemption of the New World. Such analysis reveals the merits of Colbert's imaginative historical recuperation of a previously undervalued aspect of nineteenth-century American culture. Allegheny College David C.
