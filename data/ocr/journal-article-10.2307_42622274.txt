LESURE University of California, Los Angeles Animal Imagery , Cultural Unities , and Ideologies of Inequality in Early Formative Mesoamerica What of ties Mesoamerica? is across the source this region While of the can most ancient be cultural traced cultural continui- to a unity rich of Mesoamerica? While most cultural continui- ties across this region can be traced to a rich history of innovation and interaction in the Formative, Classic, and Postclassic epochs, there have been persistent suggestions that it is possible to find manifestations of a more ancient substratum of belief that was common to Mesoamerican groups of the preceramic era (Fürst 1995; Lathrap 1974; Marcus et al. 1983). There is little material evidence from the Archaic period, or even the initial Early Forma- tive, that can be used to evaluate these ideas. Most attempts to reconstruct an ancient cul- tural legacy focus on Olmec art of the latter part of the Early Formative, especially the styl- ized motifs that appear on pottery across much of Mesoamerica. A persuasive body of interpre- tation identifies these motifs as abstract repre- sentations of mythological creatures combining traits of different animals from the natural world (Joralemon 1976; Marcus 1989; Pohori- lenko 1977). In many areas these motifs are the earliest known examples of iconographie rep- resentations in which designs illustrate sub- jects. The striking thing about these late Early Formative motifs is that similar or even iden- tical motifs appear in many different regions. Fish Effigy Vessel, Early Formative period, blackware ceramic Museo Nacional de Antropología, Mexico City Researchers have explained these similarities in a variety of ways. According to one long- standing interpretive trend, the Olmec icono- graphie system arose on the Gulf Coast, and its use spread to other areas during the Early Formative period (for example, Clark 1990; Diehl and Coe 1995; Tolstoy 1989). An alter- native interpretation holds that many regions contributed to late Early Formative iconogra- phies, and the Gulf Coast was not the primary locus of innovation (Grove 1989; Flannery and Marcus 1994; Niederberger 1987). In this view, similarities in motifs derive either from a sharing of innovations among different regions during the Early Formative period or from the development of new ways of expressing ele- ments of a much older substratum of belief (common to all Mesoamerican peoples) that was already in place by the Early Formative period. In this alternative view, it is not appro- priate to term the shared iconography " Olmec" because it did not derive from the Gulf Coast. The debate over the source of the shared motifs is of far more than antiquarian interest. At issue are basic understandings of the social processes that led to the emergence of com- plex societies in Mesoamerica. In addition, tracing the sources of Olmec iconography is an important step toward sorting out a com- plicated set of transformations in belief sys- tems that took place in the Early Formative period. For instance, what cosmological changes accompanied the shift from hunter-gatherer to sedentary lifestyle? How did ideologies of social inequality arise? What was the history of beliefs that came to justify and naturalize social hierarchies of the late Early Formative and Middle Formative periods? I do not pretend to be able to resolve all these long-standing debates in this short essay. 193</page><page sequence="3">i. Comparison of motifs on pottery vessels from three different areas of Mesoamerica indicates strong similarities of elements and motifs. Redrawn (modified, not to scale) after: for Oaxaca, Flannery and Marcus (1994: figs. 12.4, 12.75) and Whalen (1981: fig. 36); for Gulf Coast, Coe and Diehl (1980: figs. 139, 141, 142); for Basin of Mexico, Niederberger (1987: figs. 398, 471) Instead, my goal is to present new data from the Soconusco region of Chiapas, Mexico, sug- gesting that Olmec motifs were not part of an ancient heritage common to all Mesoameri- can peoples. The intriguing aspect of the Soco- nusco case is that the appearance of stylized motifs corresponds with the disappearance of a completely different system of zoomorphic imagery that involved naturalistic representa- tions of animals from the local environment. I argue that the stylized motifs replaced the local system of naturalistic representations and were therefore not part of an Archaic legacy already present in the area from preceramic times. What can this change in representa- tional systems tell us about the content of a shared substratum of belief in Mesoamerica and its transformation or transmutation into an ideational basis for social hierarchy? The Issues I will use the expressions "Early Olmec motifs" (or just "Olmec motifs") and "late Early For- mative motifs" interchangeably to describe the stylized designs that appeared across Meso- america from 1150 to 850 b.c. (dates in uncali- brated radiocarbon years). The logic of my analysis does not require any a priori assump- tions about the geographical source of these motifs or the number of cultures that may have contributed to their creation. The idea that elements of this Early Olmec iconography were part of an ancient cultural heritage shared among many regions is based on the appearance of similar iconographie ele- ments across great geographical distances (fig. 1), the variability in the use of these elements in different areas (Grove 1989, 1993), and the complexity of this system at the time of its first emergence. For this last point, it is not just that the designs themselves are complex but that the mythological subject matter depicted is richly developed. The fact that this icono- graphie system appears fully formed on late Early Formative ceramics could mean that it developed in a perishable medium and was only later transferred to ceramics. If this were the case, what we observe in the late Early For- mative would be not the origin of the system 194 LESURE</page><page sequence="4">itself but, rather, the origin of the practice of inscribing its elements on durable media such as ceramics and stone. A preceramic origin for the system and the widespread sharing of both the motifs and their mythological subject mat- ter would seem reasonable in this light. Recent findings in the Soconusco challenge the notion that the later motifs were already part of a cultural heritage this area shared with the rest of Mesoamerica. There a different sys- tem of zoomorphic representations preceded the appearance of the late Early Formative iconography on ceramics. If the inhabitants of the Soconusco developed one system of zoo- morphic representations and then abandoned it for another, it would seem more probable that the new system was either a recent inno- vation or an import rather than something that had always been around even during the devel- opment of the first system. There are two potential problems with this line of argument. The first derives from the observation that two or more representational systems can be present in any one society (see Morphy 1977). Since we are missing the perish- able material assemblage from Early Formative Soconusco, it is conceivable that the system of abstract motifs was in use at the same time as the naturalistic effigies, but that it was restricted to wood or other perishable media. At present this seems an unlikely possibility. Naturalistic animal effigies in the early period appear on implements used for a number of different purposes in different social contexts (ceramic vessels of various sorts, figurines, whistles, jade pendants, incense burners, and, in one case, a stone bowl). The evidence sug- gests a pervasive use of naturalistic imagery in a wide variety of social contexts and the absence of the mythological imagery known from later times in any of these contexts. Of course, as long as we lack perishable items, this issue cannot be definitively resolved one way or the other. The second problem is more the subject of this essay: even if there was a change from one representational system to another, does a change in representations necessarily imply a change in meaning? We may identify what a representation depicts (its " subject mat- ter" or simply "subject") but still understand little of its meaning, since the subjects of rep- resentations often connote more abstract ideas. As Robert Layton (1991: 126) puts it, "the ideas signified by visual motifs themselves stand for other ideas." It is conceivable that a change of representational system and subject matter might occur without any fundamental change in the more abstract messages being conveyed. The Early Formative inhabitants of the Soco- nusco might have switched representational vehicles without changing the more general meanings they sought to express. According to this scenario, despite the changes in animal imagery in the Soconusco during the Early For- mative, key ideas conveyed by the later repre- sentational system could still have been part of a much more ancient cultural heritage the Soconusco shared with other areas. I will pre- sent a qualified argument against this view, concluding that the observed change in repre- sentations does indeed reflect significant dis- continuities in both subject matter and more abstract symbolism. Analyzing Representations Although design systems can be purely deco- rative, without any underlying symbolism (Layton 1991: 125-126), such systems do not appear to be typical. Representations usually convey ideas. If we are to make headway in the analysis of these systems, it is important to think in terms of a dimensionality or structure to the ideas once conveyed by artifacts and designs on artifacts. At least three conceptual levels can be distinguished. First, there is the representational system itself, which includes the designs as mental constructs. Second is the subject matter of the representations, what the representations "look like" or illustrate, again to be thought of as a set of concepts rather than entities in the physical world. Third, there is what I will refer to as the symbolism of the images, those abstract ideas to which the sub- jects refer but which are not explicitly depicted in the designs. It is important also to bear in mind that arti- facts with motifs are more than simply vehicles for investigating ideas. They are also evidence of the entrance of ideas into social life. Objects bearing effigies or motifs were deployed and manipulated by social actors. The subject mat- ter and symbolism of the representations would thus have been a potential resource for people negotiating social relationships. From this theoretical perspective, shared cultural legacies in Mesoamerica may them- LESURE 195</page><page sequence="5">selves have been dimensional. For instance, certain basic symbols shared by Early Forma- tive societies might have derived from a shared ancient legacy. At the same time, understand- ings that selected metaphors for those beliefs, and practices that introduced the metaphors into social interactions, might both have been innovations of the Early Formative period. The contribution of a shared cultural substratum to representations, subjects, symbolism, and modes of social interaction in Early Formative Mesoamerica is thus an empirical question that must be investigated with archaeological data from particular areas. The Soconusco and the Mazatán Area The materials analyzed for this study come from recent excavations in the Mazatán area of the Soconusco, a coastal region that runs along the southern coast of Mesoamerica from Mapastepec, Chiapas, southeast to just across the Guatemalan border (fig. 2). The coastal plain between the ocean and the steeply rising Sierra Madre is just 20 kilometers wide but is characterized by a number of different biotic zones that parallel the line of the coast in thin strips. These include estuaries, mangrove swamps, lagoons, and savanna lands (Coe and Flannery 1967: 9-15). A large variety of fish, reptiles, mammals, and birds inhabited this region. This diversity of wildlife seems to have provided the inspiration for the wide variety of zoomorphic depictions, described below, that appeared during the first part of the Early Formative period. The importance of initial Early Formative (c. 15 50-1100 b.c.) developments in the Soco- nusco has been known since Michael Coe's (1961) work on Ocós phase materials from La Victoria and Gareth Lowe's (1975) discovery of earlier, Barra phase assemblages in the Maza- tán area. Coe (1961) and Jorge Ceja (1985), for La Victoria and Paso de la Amada, respectively, were the first to identify the tradition of natu- ralistic ceramic effigies analyzed here. Recent work by John Clark and Michael Blake (1989, 1994; Blake et al. 1995), again in the Mazatán area, has further refined the Early Formative ceramic sequence and generated a detailed model of sociopolitical changes during this time period. These authors suggest that small- scale chiefly polities arose in the region after 1400 b.c. and persisted until around 1000 b.c., when most of the study region was organized into a single complex chief dom (see also Clark and Pye, this volume). Clark (1990, 1994a) argues that sociopolitical developments and material culture changes in late Early Formative Soco- nusco (including the appearance of Olmec-style motifs on ceramics) were profoundly affected by developments on the Gulf Coast. I turn now to a description of the two se- quential systems of zoomorphic imagery in Early Formative Soconusco. The early pattern of naturalistic representations characterizes the initial Early Formative of the region but continues into the late Early Formative, per- haps to around 1000 b.c.1 The onset of the late Early Formative in the Mazatán study area is indicated by significant changes in the mate- rial culture assemblage beginning around 1100 b.c. Those changes included shifts in the shapes 2.

Top and side views of miniature ceramic vessel with rabbit effigy, Paso de la Amada, 1400- 1000 b.c. and colors of pottery vessels as well as the ap- pearance of iron-ore mirrors, cylinder seals, white slipping on figurines, and new (Olmec) head styles and body positions for figurines. These changes demonstrate the participation of the inhabitants of Mazatán in the pan- Mesoamerican stylistic horizon of the late Early Formative and probably reflect intensive contact with complex societies on the Gulf Coast and other areas of Mesoamerica as well. Artifacts and Representations, 1400- 1000 b.c. Zoomorphic imagery of the period 1400- 1000 b.c. is characterized by naturalistic figures hand modeled in clay. The study collection consists of 159 identifiable animal heads or head fragments and 126 identifiable body or limb fragments from recent excavations at Paso de la Amada. Many more unidentifiable frag- ments (generally body or limb pieces) were not analyzed for this study. Most figures appear as effigies on vessels. Some of these vessels are unique creations, but most effigies are modeled heads and other features affixed to otherwise typical vessel forms. The ceramic representa- tions depict a wide range of animals from the local environment. All kinds of representations appear in refuse throughout the site of Paso de la Amada. Most or all households seem to have used these items in daily activities. Artifacts Most prevalent among effigy vessels were appli- qué animal heads and limbs on what were otherwise quite typical pots. Most appliqué 198 LESURE</page><page sequence="8">effigies appear on neckless jars (tecomates) with unslipped bodies or on red-slipped, rounded- wall bowls (typically with flat bases). Effigies were occasionally affixed to other bowl forms as well. For rounded-wall bowls used in food service, rim diameters of vessels with effigies are significantly smaller than those of similar vessels without effigies.2 Interestingly, the rim diameter distribution of these serving bowls is bimodal, and all except one of the thirty effi- gies in the sample appear on vessels in the smaller size mode. It is possible that these dif- ferent size modes represent individual-portion serving bowls, approximately 13-21 centimeters in diameter, and family-portion serving bowls, most commonly 26-35 centimeters in diam- eter (see Henrickson and McDonald 1983). I suggest below that the occurrence of effigies almost exclusively on individual-portion ves- sels indicates that the deployment of effigies mediated small-scale social interactions or per- sonal identities. Effigy heads affixed to all kinds of vessels were oriented in one of two ways. Usually the head faced straight out from the side of the pot so that an observer looking down on the ves- sel would look down on the animal as well (fig. 3). For heads oriented in this latter fashion, the 6. Fragment of ceramic effigy vessel molded in the form of a duck, Paso de la Amada, 1100-1000 b.c. pot itself seems to have represented the body of the animal, and limbs and tails were often added in appropriate positions around the perimeter of the vessel. In other cases, the head faced along the exterior circumference of the vessel, so that an observer looking straight down on the pot from above would see the ani- mal in profile (figs. 4-5). In the case of the most elaborate effigy ves- sels, the whole vessel was specially molded to form the body and appendages of the animal depicted (fig. 6). Because each of these vessels appears to have been unique and the collec- tion is very fragmentary, it is not possible to reconstruct any of these very elaborate vessels from the tantalizing pieces available. The least elaborate effigy vessels were a rare set of miniature bowls that are distinct from typical serving vessels in their size and rela- tive crudity of surface finish. Although they may have a slip or wash, they are usually un- burnished or only lightly burnished. The sur- faces of some are very roughly finished. The actual effigies appearing on these pots can, however, be quite sophisticated (fig. 5). Rim diameters range from 3 to 8 centimeters, and maximum pot diameters vary from 4 to 9 centi- meters. The three bases of these small vessels are all slightly blackened on the exterior, but there is no evidence of heavy burning. The uses of these vessels are unknown. The fact that they are so small, with surface treatments so different from typical serving vessels, may indi- cate that they were used for some purpose be- sides serving food. Two effigy incense burners were recovered by Michael Blake from Mound 6 at Paso de la Amada. One represents a fish; the other prob- ably depicted a dog. Both consist of a flat clay slab that had three or four small, solid supports. The upper surfaces of these and other (non- effigy) incense burners are heavily burned and blackened. Animal imagery appears on other ceramic artifacts besides vessels. Rare animal figurines are small or miniature in comparison to human figurines of the same period and are occasion- ally pierced for suspension. Bird-effigy whistles are small, hollow figures with a blow hole formed with a flat reed or twig and a few other small round holes in the hollow body. Some anthropomorphic figurines appear to be de- picted wearing masks that include animal fea- tures. I have analyzed these with the human LESURE 199</page><page sequence="9">figurines and will not consider them here (Lesure 1997). R epresen ta tions A wide range of animals, including mammals, fish, reptiles or amphibians, and birds, is rep- resented among the effigies, figurines, and whistles (figs. 7-9). The distribution of repre- sentations among various classes of animals is shown in tables 1 and 2, along with the fre- quency of these same animals in a large sam- ple of faunal remains from a nearby site of the same period.3 Reptiles and amphibians are the most numerous class of animals among the representations. This is because toad effigies make up a full 27 percent of all identifiable head fragments. Among the mammals, dogs, rabbits, peccaries, and armadillos are well rep- resented. There are a variety of different birds that are difficult to identify precisely. Judging from the beak forms, these include waterfowl, birds of prey, and songbirds. Fish are much rarer than their importance in the diet might lead one to expect, and they appear rather stylized. I have not attempted to divide them into dif- ferent species. The different animal representations are not distributed evenly among the different vessel and figurine forms noted above. Mammals (pri- marily dogs) predominate on the elaborate molded vessels (69 percent). Toads are by far the most common appliqué effigies on regular serving bowls (62 percent) and are the most com- mon appliqué on tecomates as well (30.3 per- cent). Only one probable toad appeared among the miniature bowls. Instead, the most com- mon representations on these pots were dogs (60 percent) and rabbits (27 percent). Solid figu- rines were primarily armadillos (58 percent) and birds (25 percent). The twenty-four identified whistles were all birds, though many of these had two heads and were not in that sense natu- ralistic. There may have been shifts over time in the animals represented, but I am unable to show this convincingly with my sample. Interestingly, despite the pervasive natu- ralism in the imagery, some of the effigies depict subtle mixtures of human and animal characteristics. One human feature is the inclu- sion of ear ornaments and occasionally human- like ears. At least two depictions of what I interpret to be crocodiles (for example, fig. 8, upper right) appear to wear some sort of head- dress. I distinguish between essentially animal figures with a few humanlike features (which appear as effigies on vessels) and the basically human figures with animal masks mentioned above (which appear as small, solid figurines). There are not enough specimens to know whether these two categories might actually grade into each other. Frequencies In the overall assemblage at Paso de la Amada, animal effigies, figurines, and whistles were rare. In a large sample of rim sherds of the period 1400- 1000 b.c., less than 1 percent of all rims, or slightly more than 1 percent of all bowl rims, showed evidence of having been part of an effigy vessel. However, these pat- 7. Mammal effigies and figurines, Paso de la Amada, 1400- 1000 b.c., ceramic. Top from left: dog, peccary snout. Middle: dog, monkey figurine, armadillo figurine (seen from top).

It should be noted that half or more of the rim sherds from an effigy ves- sel would show no evidence of the effigy. Depending on the placement of the effigy and the degree of breakage, it is possible that none of the rim sherds from an effigy vessel would show evidence of the effigy. A reasonable esti- mate might be that from 2 to 4 percent of serv- ing bowls and a somewhat smaller proportion of tecomates were effigy vessels. Contexts Animal effigies and figurines were encountered in occupation surfaces, middens, and fill. No effigy pots have yet been recovered with buri- als, but the sample of burials is still quite small. Contexts of recovery suggest that effigy vessels, figurines, whistles, and censers were used in household contexts and discarded with other household refuse. There appear to have been various social contexts for the use of ani- mal imagery within households. Animal effi- gies were sometimes affixed to vessels used to serve food, but plain tecomates that seem more appropriate for transport or storage of water or other liquids also occasionally had effigies. Household ritual activities may have involved the miniature bowls, but more certainly the small, slablike incense burners. Artifacts and Representations, 1000-850 b.c. Zoomorphic imagery of the period 1000-850 b.c. is characterized by very abstract repre- sentations of supernatural creatures,- indeed, it is primarily by comparison to other regions, where very similar designs appear at this time, that motifs from the Mazatán region are con- vincingly identifiable as zoomorphic (fig. 10). 202 LESURE</page><page sequence="12">Table i.

LESURE 203</page><page sequence="13">Study of the late Early Formative in the region is less advanced than study of the initial Early Formative; a comprehensive treatment of late Early Formative representational systems is not attempted here. Recent excavations by Tomás Pérez at Canton el Corralito (Mz-257) recovered a large and well-preserved sample of decorated vessels from this era, and future stud- ies by Pérez will expand considerably the brief sketch provided here. For this study, a detailed analysis of 2,065 rim sherds from twenty-six provenience units in the sites of Canton el Corralito, San Carlos, and El Varal was undertaken. (During this time period, the site of Paso de la Amada, the source of the initial Early Formative assemblage de- scribed above, had only ephemeral occupation.) Of the rim sherds analyzed, 95 sherds from bowls and thin- walled tecomates bore evidence of incised or excised motifs. Motifs incised around the rims of unslipped tecomates do not fit so obviously into the pan-Mesoamerican stylistic horizon of the late Early Formative and were not considered for this study. To develop a better qualitative understanding of the designs and motifs, incised sherds in type collections from the Mazatán area, housed at the New World Archaeological Foundation in San Cristobal de Las Casas, Chiapas, were also examined. Artifacts A striking contrast between assemblages of this period and those of the immediately pre- ceding era is the extreme rarity of molded effigies. Many of the effigies that do appear are much cruder than their counterparts from before 1000 b.c., appearing as generalized faces that could be either animal or human (fig. 11). Although the sample of these is quite small, favored locations for effigies are the necks of large jars, a new vessel form. A number of very crude effigies formed by cane impressions also appear on large tecomates. Pérez7 recent exca- vations at Canton el Corralito recovered a few fragments of more naturalistic animal effigies from this time period, but in general his find- ings support the idea that such representations were extremely rare after 1000 b.c. The tradi- tion of detailed representations of a wide vari- ety of species essentially disappears. Instead of effigies or other forms of plastic decoration such as modeling of the rim, serv- io.

Vessels decorated in this manner are generally black, gray, or differentially fired black and white. The primary forms bearing decoration are open bowls with outslanting sides, cylindrical bowls, and bolstered-rim bowls. Rare forms that are sometimes decorated are small jars with low vertical or outsloping necks,- small, thin- walled tecomates; and jars with tall, vertical necks in a variety of sizes. In contrast to the effigy ves- sels of the preceding period, which tended to be smaller than their noneffigy counterparts, there was no statistically significant difference in rim size between bowls bearing motifs and undecorated bowls. This pattern holds for each of the three main forms (outsloping walled, cylindrical, and bolstered-rim bowls).4 The only other ceramic artifacts that may bear a similar iconography are rare cylinder seals or roller stamps. Interestingly, these show up in small numbers in Mazatán assemblages beginning around noo b.c., about a century earlier than the iconography appears on the ceramics. The fragmentation and rarity of these artifacts preclude any meaningful discussion of representations or frequencies; they were apparently used and discarded in household contexts. Representations Although the collection of motifs on vessels is fragmentary and complete designs are diffi- cult to reconstruct, it is clear that the Maza- tán assemblage includes many motifs familiar from late Early Formative collections of other regions. Elements present in Soconusco assem- blages include crossed bands, music brackets, and flame-eyebrows (figs. 12-14). Complex designs include fire-serpent and paw-wing motifs. Along with these pan-Mesoamerican or Olmec designs there appear to be motifs with more localized distributions, especially after 900 b.c. An expanded sample and more detailed analysis are needed to piece together the full representational system. For the pres- ent study, the crucial observation concerning the late Early Formative representational sys- tem is that pan-Mesoamerican (Olmec) motifs are prominent in the Mazatán assemblage. The subjects of these representations were mytho- logical creatures with zoomorphic attributes. Frequencies Among all bowl rims in the sample for the period 1000-850 b.c., 7.7 percent bear evidence of motifs. Half the incised sherds, however, came from a single remarkable deposit exca- vated by John Clark at Cantón el Corralito. This may have been an elite midden. If this sample is removed, the overall percentage of bowl rims bearing motifs falls to 4.4 percent. Since inspection of the most complete incised vessel fragments suggests that more than half the rim sherds from an incised bowl would bear evidence of the motifs, a reasonable esti- mate of the frequency of bowls bearing motifs in typical assemblages would be 6 to 7 percent. Like the earlier effigies, the abstract motifs are consistently present in assemblages of their epoch but are not common. I present an over- all estimate of motif frequency mainly to sup- port the idea that the earlier effigies and the 12. Abstract motifs from El Varal and San Carlos, 1000-850 b.c., ceramic LESURE 205</page><page sequence="15">later motifs are broadly comparable as repre- sentational systems. This estimate should be taken with a large grain of salt until data are available to conduct a detailed study of varia- tions within sites, between sites, and over time in the frequencies of vessels bearing abstract motifs. The sample from Canton el Corralito, in which 23.8 percent of bowl rims in a possible high-status midden bore evidence of incised motifs, emphasizes the potential for complex patterns of distribution. Pérez' recent excava- tions at the same site confirm this basic pat- tern in a greatly enlarged sample. Patterned distribution of vessels with abstract motifs would constitute a significant difference between those and the earlier effigies, where within-site and between-site patterns have not been identified. Contexts Vessels bearing abstract motifs were encoun- tered primarily in middens and fill. No vessels bearing motifs have been recovered in burials, but the sample of burials is quite small. Con- texts of recovery suggest use in residences for the serving of food. The appearance of similar imagery on cylinder seals shows that the motifs were deployed in other social contexts besides food consumption. A Basis for Comparison Interpretations presented below of the change from naturalistic animal effigies to stylized representations of supernatural creatures explore a series of contrasts between the two repre- sentational systems. Before such contrasts can become meaningful, however, it is important to establish some sort of frame in which the two systems can be seen as analogous. I con- sider the two systems similar in the sense that both appear to reflect the symbolic manipula- tion of ideas about the natural and supernatu- ral worlds and the deployment of those ideas in the negotiation of social relationships, espe- cially those relationships activated in the pre- sentation and consumption of food (the " social relations of consumption"). Such a complicated proposition will necessarily remain an assump- tion of my analysis, but a number of lines of evidence can be marshaled in its support. One consideration is whether these repre- sentational systems were really symbolic rather than purely decorative. The symbolic claim seems easier to support for the stylized motifs. David Joralemon (1976) and Anatole Pohori- lenko (1977) convincingly demonstrate the coexistence of ideas about the natural and supernatural worlds in early Olmec iconogra- phy and identify key images as representations of mythological or supernatural creatures bear- ing traits drawn from a variety of natural crea- tures. The fact that the iconography of the ceramics also appears on large stone monu- ments at sites like San Lorenzo underscores its symbolic importance. It seems likely that the stylized motifs on late Early Formative pots in the Soconusco were important and meaningful images. The question of whether the earlier effigies were also symbols reflecting abstract beliefs about the natural and supernatural worlds is less clear-cut, though Pohorilenko (1996: 130) does interpret them as evidence of animistic religions. If the effigies were actually nothing more than decorative elements, perhaps reflect- ing what was eaten in the pots, then any explo- ration of fine-grained contrasts between the two representational systems (one symboli- cally charged and one purely decorative) would be meaningless. Some evidence against the "mere decoration" argument can be adduced from the materials themselves. It is clear from tables i and 2 that the system of animal repre- sentations was much more than a simple re- flection of subsistence concerns, since the 13. Abstract "fire-serpent" motif from El Varal, 1000-850 b.c., ceramic 206 LESURE</page><page sequence="16">14- "Fire-serpent" motifs from El Varal, 1000-850 b.c., ceramic frequency with which different animals appear as effigies does not reflect their importance in the diet. In addition, the occasional subtle mix- tures of human and animal characteristics de- scribed above (such as the appearance of a human ear and ear ornament on an otherwise naturalistic animal) may reflect symbolic elabo- ration of the idea that humans can transform themselves into animals. This is a recurring theme in the ethnography of the Americas, and the Mazatán effigies may well reflect such beliefs. The best reason, however, for rejecting the idea that the naturalistic effigies were merely decorative is simply the general and pervasive cosmological importance of animals throughout Native America. On comparative grounds, it seems likely that animal metaphors were important in Early Formative villagers' cosmologies and that their carefully modeled effigies were symbolically rich images. Once one accepts both effigies and motifs as symbolic objects, the next issue for consid- eration is the claimed importance of these objects for social relationships. Did people really use these representations as sources of metaphors for interpreting or negotiating social interactions in terms of cultural symbols? And, if so, were the two systems of representations used in comparable sets of interactions or activ- ities? The answer to the second question seems clear: since both the effigies and motifs appear predominantly on pottery vessels, especially on vessels appropriate for the presentation and consumption of food and drink, it is likely that they were used in similar kinds of activities. The first question is more difficult to answer and must remain a hypothesis. Certainly many vessels used in food service did not bear zoomorphic imagery. A small but relatively consistent percentage of vessels (2-4 percent for effigies, 6-7 percent for the later motifs) did bear such imagery, however, and would have been familiar items at meals. It would perhaps be surprising if people did not incor- porate these symbolic resources in strategies they devised for navigating the social relations of consumption. Interpretations The representations of initial and late Early Formative Soconusco are thus comparable to the extent that they were deployed in social interactions involving the presentation and consumption of food, where they invoked sym- bolism of the natural and supernatural worlds. The appearance of the motifs at the time of the disappearance of effigies raises the possibility that the motifs replaced the effigies. By refer- ring to the observed changes as "replacement," I suggest that there was a causal relation between the disappearance of the one and the appearance of the other - that one form of rep- resentational expression was deliberately aban- doned and another adopted as a result of as yet unknown social and historical conditions. To LESURE 207</page><page sequence="17">investigate the implications of this possible replacement, I explore differences in repre- sentations, subject matter, and symbolism between the earlier effigies and the later motifs. Representations Setting aside for a moment the difference in subject matter of the representations, the most obvious distinction between the earlier and later images is one of representational style. In the early period, representations were natu- ralistic. Effigies were modeled to resemble the three-dimensional form of their subjects. In the later period, representations continued to illustrate subjects, but in a more stylized way. The motifs are two-dimensional abstractions composed of straight, curved, and hooked lines. Only a careful comparison among different images has enabled analysts to demonstrate that this is zoomorphic imagery (fig. 10). The shift from naturalism to stylization may signal an increase in the potential for ambi- guity in the messages conveyed. In the Yolngu art of Australia analyzed by Howard Morphy (1980), both geometric and figurative elements appear. Morphy (1980: 33) points out that "pre- cisely because Yolngu figurative representations are intended to look like another object and be interpreted as such, they are less ambiguous, less productive and have less potential for multi- valency than the geometric art." Indeed, sev- eral Yolngu informants told Morphy that "part of the function of geometric art is to obscure meanings" (1980: 32). I do not take Morphy's analysis to suggest that geometric art is always more ambiguous than figurative art. Neverthe- less, the possibilities Morphy raises would seem worth investigating when a naturalistic and a stylized system are juxtaposed in some way, either because both appear in a single cul- tural context or because one was abandoned in favor of the other. The latter would apply to Early Formative Soconusco. Of course, the later imagery there is not pure abstraction,- there does appear to have been a resemblance, however stylized, between illustration and subject. But as we attempt to explain the shift from naturalism to stylization, it seems worth considering the possibility, raised by the Yolngu case, that this shift was linked to an increase in symbolic ambiguity. Interpretation of the stylized imagery required knowledge of a code, while the naturalistic imagery invited interpretation even from those unfamiliar with its meanings. The code associated with the stylized images might have been open and well known, but there was a new potential for restricting access to meaning. More ambiguous imagery could have provided greater scope for the develop- ment of esoteric interpretations that could be guarded as secret by a special segment of the community. Subject Matter In the earlier period, subjects were drawn from the animals with which villagers came into contact in their daily Uves. After 1000 b.c., sub- jects were supernatural entities imagined as fantastic creatures bearing traits drawn from various animals. The subjects of zoomorphic representations changed from the creatures of everyday existence to those of special, numi- nous experiences,- there was a shift in focus from the ordinary to the extraordinary. It is important not to go overboard with this obser- vation. The ancient inhabitants of the Soco- nusco are unlikely to have made the sharp distinctions western peoples make today be- tween the pragmatic and the spiritual. Indeed, I argued above that animals were likely to have had important cosmological and supernatural implications. The crucial point here is a symbolism of access. The creatures depicted in the effigies had real-life counterparts accessible to every- one. Adults killed them, skinned them, and ate them. Children poked at them with sticks. The supernaturais represented in the abstract motifs were removed from this concrete exis- tence. Although it is quite possible that many people interacted with these creatures in such contexts as dreams or visions, the removal of the concrete dimension of interaction created a new potential for restrictions in access. Although people continued to use zoomorphic symbolism in negotiating the social relations of consumption, the new subject matter was removed from everyday life and was thus no longer impervious to manipulation by a single social segment. Abstract Symbols An important issue raised at the outset of this essay was whether representational systems 208 LESURE</page><page sequence="18">and subject matter could have changed while, at a more abstract level, the messages conveyed remained constant. The extent of the changes in subjects observed above suggests some gen- eral but important changes in the realm of abstract symbolism, especially if we imagine symbols to have been continually at play in the processes of social reproduction (rather than existing remote from and remaining un- affected by people's lived experiences). After iooo b.c., villagers in the Soconusco chose a whole new set of ideas for negotiating social relations of consumption. The change from local animals to supernaturais suggests a shift of focus from the creatures of everyday life to those of extraordinary experience. Such a shift could signal a significant increase in the level of generality of symbolism applied to certain important domains of social activity (such as the presentation and consumption of food). This claim for increased symbolic gener- ality is based on the assumption that Early Formative cosmologies would have been hier- archically organized into levels of increasing generality, with distinctions among animals occupying a lower level than composite super- naturals. I say "distinctions among animals" rather than simply "animals" for good reason. Particular animals could easily have been key cultural symbols with a high degree of gener- ality, and if the Soconusco effigies represented just two or three different animals, the assump- tion I am proposing would be much more tenuous. As it is, the prevalence of toads among the effigies suggests that this creature had a special kind of symbolic importance. The over- all pattern among the effigies, however, is the representation of many different kinds of animals. It is this aspect of the system that suggests a fairly low level of cosmological gen- erality. This characterization would fit the modern cosmology of the Mixe of Oaxaca (see Lipp 1991: 24-50), whose language is probably closely related to that spoken by the Early Formative inhabitants of the Soconusco (Lowe 1977). This would also appear to be compat- ible with Marcus' (1989) model of Early Forma- tive cosmologies in Oaxaca in which the mythological subject matter of late Early For- mative motifs symbolized high-order super- natural forces identified with earth and sky. If I am right to interpret the switch from animal effigies to abstract motifs as indicative of a shift in symbolism to higher-order cosmo- logical concepts, it does not necessarily follow that the observed material changes actually signal the first appearance of a new level of generality in cosmologies of the Soconusco. Higher levels of generality could have been present in initial Early Formative times with- out ideas from those levels being applied to the social interactions in which they later became significant. What the representational change does signal is a reorganization of the relations between different parts of the cosmological system and different domains of experience such that social acts took on new dimensions of sym- bolism. In particular, activities involved in the presentation and consumption of food took on more general cosmological implications. Symbols and Social Interactions A change to a representational system with more general cosmological implications suggests that social interactions were being interpreted in new ways. What were the specific aspects of social interaction that were becoming more important? One possibility that would accord nicely with the proposed symbolic changes is that people found it increasingly important to signal memberships in large-scale groups or social categories. Patterns relating to the appearance of effigies and motifs on ceramic vessels may provide support for that idea. As described above, effigies of the earlier period appeared on individual-portion bowls to the near exclusion of family-portion bowls. This may be because the symbolism of naturalistic effigies mediated small-scale social relations, such as individual interactions and personal identities. In contrast, the higher-order super- naturals represented in the later period were placed on both small and large pots without preference. If personal identities became less important than allegiances to lineages, status groupings, or even a generalized human com- munity, then it would not be surprising to find just such a pattern of distribution of motifs. The distinctions and achievements of indi- viduals within families were no longer empha- sized; what was significant was a common identity and solidarity. Thus images that linked social groups or categories to basic cosmolog- ical principles appeared on pots of all sizes. This proposal for the Soconusco fits comfort- ably with mortuary data from highland Mex- ico, where late Early Formative motifs appear LESURE 209</page><page sequence="19">to have conveyed messages about social group- ings such as clans or lineages (Marcus 1989: 169- 170; Pyne 1976; Tolstoy 1989: 290). Social Inequality In the last few sections I have set up some- thing of a contradiction, first suggesting that the later representational system was appro- priate for control by an elite because it was more ambiguous and more remote from every- day life than its predecessor, and then claim- ing that it evoked more general cosmological principles that were of interest to people as they emphasized the solidarity of large-scale social groupings or categories. Were these images divisive or uniting? An analysis of the representations from the perspective of social inequality suggests that they were both. The appearance of abstract imagery in the Soconusco coincides with settlement pattern and other changes that Clark and Blake (1989) interpret as the formulation of a regional para- mount chiefdom. In other words, the observed changes in zoomorphic imagery are coeval with sociopolitical transformations toward greater centralization and political inequality. Were vessels with abstract motifs elite goods that symbolized social status? Elite households do seem to have used more of these vessels than commoner households. At the late Early Formative site of Cantón el Corralito, 23.8 percent of serving bowls in one midden sample bore incised motifs. Pérez' recent tests in the same midden found, in ad- dition to much more decorated pottery, jade ornaments and magnetite mirrors. Evidence suggests that this is an elite midden. The per- centages of bowls with motifs in two samples of the same phase from the adjacent site of San Carlos were 3.7 and 9.4 percent. Despite an ap- parent tendency for elites to have more deco- rated pottery, use of the stylized zoomorphic imagery was by no means restricted to the elite. Excavations at a variety of sites in the Mazatán area clearly show that everyone had access to decorated vessels. The change from naturalis- tic effigies to abstract motifs occurred at both large inland villages and small estuary hamlets. These were not exclusively "elite goods." The new representational system could nevertheless have suited elite interests in at least two respects. First, claims of special (elite- controlled) knowledge would have been more plausible for ambiguous symbols removed from everyday experience than for naturalized images whose living referents were accessible to everyone. The meanings of the abstract images could have been organized hierarchi- cally, with ordinary people having access to only a limited range of the associations under- stood by elite exegetes. For instance, everyone might have known that propitiation of these forces was crucial to community well-being, while only the elite knew how to perform rites of propitiation. This scenario would be espe- cially likely if the symbolism itself bore an ele- ment of foreignness (see below). Second, an emphasis on allegiances to large-scale social groupings or categories, along with a concomi- tant increase in the level of generality of animal symbolism, would also have been advanta- geous to the elite of an increasingly divided society by providing social cohesion at a higher level. One message of the motifs might have been, "We are the same because we are all under the protection of this supernatural." The seem- ing contradiction between my two interpreta- tions (that the new representational system fostered solidarity while providing a vehicle for divisive claims to esoteric knowledge) is deliberate. Such a contradiction, ideologically cloaked and properly mystified, could have been an important element in the constitution of chiefly power in the Soconusco. The chief would have benefited from the mystification of unequal social relations provided by super- naturals as symbols of solidarity, while at the same time claiming, through superior knowl- edge, to be the source of that solidarity. Effigies and Motifs in Other Areas The previous discussion makes such a nice log- ical package - the appearance of marked socio- political inequality being accompanied by the appearance of a more ambiguous and less ac- cessible representational system more amen- able than its predecessor to manipulation and control by an elite - that it might be tempting to think of this as a general model for ideo- logical change in Early Formative Mesoamerica. That would be a mistake. The dramatic shift in zoomorphic imagery in villages of the Soco- nusco region, from naturalistic to fantastic and abstract, does not occur in other areas. Perhaps the best examples are the Central Mexican sites of Las Bocas, Tlapacoya, and Tlatilco (see 210 LESURE</page><page sequence="20">Niederberger, this volume). Although repre- sentational systems of the initial Early Forma- tive are poorly understood at those sites, some of their best-known pieces from the late Early Formative are beautifully molded ceramic effigy vessels, some of which even bear Olmec motifs (see frontispiece, also Benson and de la Fuente 1996: cats. 27-28; Niederberger 1987: figs. 414-415, 497). At these sites, naturalistic depictions of birds, fish, and other animals appear together with abstract representations of mythological creatures. Although the ini- tial Early Formative system is unknown, it is clear that the appearance of stylized motifs did not coincide with any disappearance of natu- ralistic imagery. This observation may at first seem to pose problems for the analysis presented here, but it actually makes sense given the nature of ideo- logical change and helps clarify what kinds of transformations were going on in the Soconusco. Concerning ideological change, Chantal Mouffe (1979: 193-194), commenting on Gramsci, points out that "ideological struggle . . . consists of a process of disarticulation-rearticulation of given ideological elements in a struggle be- tween two hegemonic principles to appropriate these elements,- it does not consist of the con- frontation between two already elaborated, closed world-views. Ideological ensembles existing at a given moment are, therefore, the result of the relations of forces between the rival hegemonic principles and they undergo a perpetual process of transformation" {original emphasis). Ideologies thus weave together bits or elements from an existing symbolic field. The subject of social struggle is the structural relations among symbolic elements, since dif- ferent sets of structural relations among ele- ments can yield radically different patterns of empowerment and disempowerment. If we imagine Early Formative Mesoamerica as a landscape of local ideological struggles (the widespread shift from egalitarian to hierarch- ical social systems during the course of this period certainly supports that perspective), then what we may be seeing in the Soconusco and Central Mexico are different solutions to the articulation of symbolic elements into an ideology of social inequality. It is probable that, in both areas, certain kinds of social interactions in which personal identities and achievements had been negotiated took on new implications as new distributions of power and knowledge emerged. In the Soconusco, these processes led to the abandonment of a local tradition of elaborating ceramic serving ves- sels with naturalistic depictions of animals from everyone's daily experience and its re- placement by a system of abstract representa- tions of mythological subject matter more remote from everyday life and with more gen- eral social/cosmological referents. Social rela- tions of consumption were a site of ideological struggle, and the resulting articulation of sym- bolic elements counterpoised naturalistic and fantastic/abstract representational modes. The results of what must have been an analogous struggle in villages of Central Mexico produced a very different set of relations among elements in which multiple representational modes flourished alongside one another. Conclusion What was the source of ideological elements that supported the formation and reproduction of social hierarchies in late Early Formative Mesoamerica? Were most of these elements derived from a shared ancient substratum of belief? These questions have been difficult to address because in many areas the first icono- graphie representations to appear in the archae- ological record date to the late Early Formative itself; we can only speculate on the character of earlier belief systems. Data from the Soco- nusco provide an important new perspective on this problem since a well-developed system of zoomorphic imagery appears here during the initial Early Formative period. The abandon- ment of this system around 1000 b.c., and its replacement by an equally well-developed but very different representational system, suggest that the later system was an Early Formative import to the Soconusco rather than an ele- ment of shared cultural heritage the Soconusco held in common with the rest of Mesoamerica. I noted two potential problems with that line of argument. The first is the possibility that the later representational system had actually been present in the Soconusco from earlier times, but only in perishable media that are lost to us. This cannot be resolved definitively in the absence of any actual perishable remains, but the fact that the earlier naturalistic repre- sentations appear on objects of different kinds in a variety of media while the later abstract imagery does not appear at all provides a basis LESURE 211</page><page sequence="21">for suspecting that the latter was simply absent in earlier times. The second potential problem is the possi- bility that representational systems could have changed while the "ideas" associated with them remained constant. Investigation of this issue required some sort of model of the dimen- sionality of ideas once associated with ancient representational systems. I identified three sets of ideas that could have been associated with the modelings and incisions we observe on Early Formative pottery. These are represen- tational systems, subject matter of the repre- sentations, and abstract symbols signified by these subjects. In addition to viewing ideas as dimensional, it is important to view symbols as embedded in people's lived experiences; social acts reproduce and redefine symbols at the same time as those acts are interpreted in symbolic terms. Analyzing the representational change in Early Formative Soconusco from this per- spective suggests significant change in "ideas" and their links to social life,- it also suggests some potential areas of continuity. The most important change seems to have been that, after iooo b.c., social acts involved in the pre- sentation and consumption of food took on new symbolic implications that put these human interactions into a higher-order cosmo- logical framework than they had been seen in before. People organized ideas within this framework by imagining one or more fantas- tic creatures whose attributes stood for impor- tant cultural symbols. A system of abstract imagery provided material representations of these creatures. What the Soconusco data suggest was crit- ically absent from a widely shared substratum of belief was a structure that interpreted social relations of consumption at this level of sym- bolic and cosmological generality. Also missing was a representational system for expressing such symbols in material media and a set of social practices involving the deployment of these representations and ideas in the presen- tation and consumption of food. This nexus of representations, beliefs, and practices does not appear to have developed in the Soconusco. It was invented elsewhere in Mesoamerica and was adopted by the inhabitants of the Soco- nusco during the late Early Formative in the course of an intricate local trajectory of socio- political development. I will leave the modeling of this process of adoption to others, but it is important to note hints that inhabitants of the Soconusco inter- preted their adopted representational system in local ways. In the Soconusco, restructuring of beliefs and practices during the late Early Formative resulted in the abandonment of a rich tradition of naturalistic imagery that had previously provided a medium for interpreting social relations of consumption. After iooo b.c., naturalistic effigies are virtually absent. In other regions, such as Central Mexico, abstract Olmec imagery appears together with naturalistic effigies during the late Early For- mative. The sequence of change in the Soco- nusco is not precisely reflected in other regions because the inhabitants of the Soconusco were adopting a particular set of beliefs and prac- tices rather than a whole way of living. New beliefs and practices had to be articulated to local structures; it would appear to be this local process of articulation that resulted in the abandonment of the naturalistic tradition in the Soconusco. It is important to add that some general aspects of late Early Formative belief systems of the Soconusco could derive from a much more ancient cultural heritage this area shared with the rest of Mesoamerica. There could well have been a sharing of certain cosmological principles of the order referenced by the later motifs. Supporting this view would be the facility with which new representations and subjects were embraced by villagers of the Soconusco. The observed representational changes may reflect new ways of expressing long-shared symbols or cosmological principles and new ways of linking these to social life. Elements of long-standing traditions were re- organized, reformulated, and applied in novel ways. It is unclear whether to include in this category the subject matter of the later repre- sentations (the mythological or supernatural creatures) or simply the more abstract ideas they represented. Villagers of the Soconusco might have adopted the creatures along with their representations as a means of reorganizing and reconceptualizing certain long-held beliefs, or the creatures could have had a much longer history in the region. Either way, cosmological ideas of this order had previously been remote from everyday social interactions, and some- thing important happened during the late Early Formative to draw them to the foreground. 212 LESURE</page><page sequence="22">In conclusion, it seems unlikely that the ideologies of social inequality that developed in Formative period Soconusco emerged di- rectly either from an Archaic belief substratum or as an imported total system. Borrowed ele- ments, local innovations, and elements derived from ancient traditions assumed a complexly structured form in Early Formative belief sys- tems. Ideas from different structural positions or levels were drawn on to interpret the chang- ing dimensions of social life. A reorganization of social relations such as the development of permanent hierarchies required a reorganiza- tion of belief systems perhaps best imagined in Mouffe's (1979) sense of "ideological struggle." As the result of such struggles, "old" beliefs were articulated with social activities and rela- tionships in new ways, generating the need for new vehicles of symbolic expression and com- mentary. It is possible that the naturalistic imagery of the initial Early Formative was increasingly ill-suited to the expression of emer- gent social differences. The system that replaced it helped to draw new ideas into the interpre- tation of transformed social relationships, ideas more relevant to the fields of contention in late Early Formative ideological systems. NOTES My 1992 work at Paso de la Amada was supported by a Fulbright (HE) Fellowship and dissertation grants from the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropologi- cal Research, the Social Science Research Council, the New World Archaeological Foundation (Brigham Young University), and the University of Michigan. Michael Blake generously supported my 1993 work under a grant from the Social Sciences and Humani- ties Research Council of Canada. I would like to thank especially Lorena Mirambell and the Consejo de Arqueología of the Instituto Nacional de Antropo- logía e Historia, Mexico, for permission to carry out the fieldwork. John Clark and Michael Blake gener- ously provided access to effigies and incised sherds from Paso de la Amada, Cantón el Corralito, and San Carlos. Their guidance and encouragement were especially important during both the fieldwork and the long period of analysis that followed. Barbara Arroyo, Michael Blake, Deborah Cembellin, John Clark, Vicki Feddema, Dennis Gosser, Warren Hill, Tomás Pérez, Mary Pye, and Michael Ryan were wonderful as field companions and always generous with their ideas and suggestions. The penetrating questions of participants in the National Gallery's Olmec conference and John Clark's insightful com- ments contributed greatly to my thinking as I pre- pared the revised version of this paper. i. For Soconusco dates I rely on Blake et al. (1995). What I refer to as the initial Early Formative includes the Barra (15 50-1400 b.c.), Locona (1400- 1250 b.c.), and Ocós (12 50-1100 b.c.) phases. The late Early Formative includes the Cherla (1100-1000 b.c.), Cuadros (1000-900 b.c.), and Jocotal (900-850 b.c.) phases. I follow Blake et al. (1995) in using uncali- brated radiocarbon years instead of calendar years. 2. For rounded- wall bowls, all vessels less than 9 cm in diameter were eliminated from the analysis since these were primarily miniature vessels that may not have been used in food service. Elimination of mini- ature rounded- wall bowls left 30 with effigies and 192 without. Rim diameter ranges in the two sam- ples were 10-26 and 9-43 centimeters, respectively, with median rim diameters of 14 centimeters for effigy bowls and 18 centimeters for bowls without effigies. A Mann- Whitney U test from the program Statview was chosen instead of a t-test because the distributions were not normal. The test found the distributions significantly different with a p-value of .0005 (U = 1735, U' = 4025, z-value = -3.500, no. ties = 25, tied z-value = -3.505, tied p-value = .0005). A similar pattern is found among unslipped tecomates, where effigies are most common on vessels with diameters less than 13 centimeters. 3. Analysis of faunal remains from Paso de la Amada is currently being conducted by Thomas Wake at the University of California, Los Angeles, Institute of Archaeology. Preliminary results indicate that the general patterns suggested by the Aquiles Serdán sample in tables 1-2 are present at Paso de la Amada as well.
