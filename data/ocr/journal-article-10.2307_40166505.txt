<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Unfinished Convivio as a Pathway to the Comedy* JOHN A. SCOTT are accustomed to see in Dante's unfinished Convivio a failed enterprise in some ways antithetical to the Comedy. For many scholars, it represents a moment of philosophical infatuation and aberration, even as it marks a period of stasis in Dante's poetic career when prose seemed to be superior to poetry as a medium for communicating philo- sophical truths to his audience. The whole thrust of this paper is instead to accept the challenge implicit in the theme "Pathways to the Comedy" and to emphasize the links between Dante's greatest achievement in prose on the one hand and his supreme poetic masterpiece on the other. The most obvious link surely lies in the choice of Italian - as opposed to Latin - for the dissemination of philosophical truth to as wide an audi- ence as possible. The decision to write a poem expounding the most pro- found truths of both philosophy and theology in the vernacular was a radical choice that was made possible by Dante's impassioned defence of his mother tongue in the Convivio. Setting aside the vexed question whether Dante ever wrote an Ur-Commedia in Latin,1 we note the poet's polemical description of the Comedy's stylistic register as "modest and humble, since it is in the vulgar tongue, which is used even by simple women," as well as the sharp criticism expressed by Giovanni del Virgilio, who complained that Dante had written nothing for scholars and urged him to stop throwing pearls before swine, "for the learned man despises the vulgar tongue."2 Instead, Dante set out to fashion his native language into an artistic medium capable of expressing the most complex truths, first in the Convivio and later in the Comedy. 31</page><page sequence="2">Dante Studies, CXIII, 1995 For this purpose, there were then two formidable rivals: Latin and French. Latin was regarded by most of Dante's contemporaries as the uni- versal language of science and philosophy. According to Giles of Rome (c. 1243-1316), it was the deficiencies present in all vernaculars that led "Philosophers [. . .] to invent virtually a language for themselves, which is called Latin [. . .] 50 that they might adequately express all their concepts through it."3 It was in the first years of his exile, in the period 1303-1307, that Dante set out to disprove such linguistic and cultural prejudices. Ironically (but understandably) enough, the vernacular's potential was analyzed and exalted in Latin, in the De Vulgari Eloquentia, which unhesi- tatingly declared the vulgar tongue to be nobler than Latin.4 To situate the defence of the vernacular first found in Convivio I, we may take a brief backward glance at the twenty-fifth chapter of the Vita Nuova, where Dante's apology is based on the fact that poetry in the ver- nacular was first composed in relatively recent times and for the sole pur- pose of securing the understanding of the lady to whom it was addressed: "E lo primo che comincid a dire si come poeta volgare, si mosse pero che voile fare intendere le sue parole a donna, a la quale era malagevole d'in- tendere li versi latini" (VNxxv, 6). Then (c. 1293), love was the only sub- ject accessible to poetry in the vernacular. Some ten years later, however, as he set out to write his Convivio, Dante had experienced direct involvement in Florentine politics (marked by the anti-Magnate legislation of the Ordinamenti di Giustizia, in 1293), while as a poet, after years of experi- mentation, he had decided at least temporarily to abandon the dolci rime d}amor in order to expound the true nature of nobility con rima asprf e sottile. As far as vernacular prose was concerned, Dante recognized what had been achieved in the French vernacular (DVE 1, x, 2): "whatever has been translated into or composed in vernacular prose belongs to it; namely, compilations that combine biblical subjects with the exploits of the Trojans and Romans, and the delightful tales of adventure surrounding King Arthur, as well as many other works of history and learning."5 Moreover, Dante's predecessor in the field of vernacular encyclopedias, Brunetto Latini, had given two reasons for his choice of language: "Et se aucuns demandoit pour quoi cis livres est escris en roumang, selonc la rai- son de France, puis ke nous somes italien, je diroie que c'est pour .ii. raisons, l'une ke nous somes en France, l'autre pour gou que la parleur est plus delitable et plus comune a tous langages.n6 Clearly, the author of the Convivio was bent on challenging these claims. 32</page><page sequence="3">The Unfinished Convivio as a Pathway to the Comedy, JOHN A. SCOTT 1. It is in this context that must be placed the greatest defence of the Italian language ever penned, the apology for the lingua di si found in Convivio I. This begins in I, v, 2, where three major reasons are adduced by Dante for his choice of the vernacular instead of Latin: "Puna si muove da cautela di disconvenevole ordinazione; Paltra da prontezza di liberalitade; la terza da lo naturale amore a propria loquela."7 It would have been unseemly, indeed impossible for a Latin commentary to be subservient to poems in the vernacular, since "lo latino e sovrano del volgare" (i, vii, 5). Moreover, Latin would have served only scholars and intellectuals - liter- ally, one in a thousand (i, ix, 2) - , whereas Dante wishes to reach the widest possible audience in his native land, "lo volgare servira veramente a molti [. . .] principi, baroni, cavalieri, e molt'altra nobile gente, non sola- mente maschi mafemmine, che sono molti e molte in questa lingua, volgari, e non litterati."8 The Italian language will thus allow Dante to carry out a unique task: to bring useful knowledge to a host of good men and women who have been deprived of essential nourishment. More than ever con- vinced of the fundamental link between ethics and politics, the exiled Florentine was determined to reach the widest possible public in that Italian peninsula where he was obliged to wander "peregrino, quasi men- dicando" (i, iii, 4) and where learning had been prostituted (i, ix, 5), thereby contributing to the general state of political and moral anarchy. Now, in a passage of biblical fervour, the Convivio9 s vernacular is exalted as bringing intellectual and spiritual nourishment to thousands, even as it is greeted as "luce nuova, sole nuovo, lo quale surgera la dove l'usato tra- montera, e dara lume a coloro che sono in tenebre e in oscuritade, per lo usato sole che a loro non luce" (i, xiii, 12). The link with the Comedy is evident, when we remember the simple fact that Dante's poetic masterpiece, intended to cover the whole gamut of human knowledge and experience, was likewise written in the vernac- ular tongue, "locutio vulgaris in qua et muliercule comunicant" (Ep. XIII, 31), and addressed to a mass readership, as opposed to the elite for whom Dante had written his Vita Nuova. What is less obvious, if we scan six cen- turies of Dante scholarship, is the relevance of the Convivio's attack on those evil Italians who betray "lo naturale amore de la propria loquela" by praising not Latin, but "lo volgare altrui" (i, x, 5 and xi, 1). Just as some of Cicero's contemporaries had condemned Latin and praised the Greek 33</page><page sequence="4">Dante Studies, CXIII, 1995 language, so now certain Italians "fanno vile lo parlare italico e prezioso quello di Provenza" (i, xi, 14). This condemnation of Italians who exalt the Provengal language must lead us to reconsider the role played by Sordello in the Comedy. Traditionally, Dante's Sordello has been regarded as the poet's ideal of the patriot who upbraided the princes of his day for their political and moral shortcomings.9 In the light of what we find in Convivio I, however, it is surely impossible to reconcile this traditional view with what must have been Dante's judgment of Sordello. For the Florentine exile, it was the duty of all Italian poets to contribute to the creation of what he called the illustrious (Italian) vernacular. It was moreover in that selfsame work where he spelled out this patriotic duty that he referred to Sordello as a man of outstanding eloquence, tantus eloquentie vir (DVE I, xv, 2), while the emphatic choice of deseruit emphasizes the fact that his predecessor had totally abandoned his patrium vulgare.10 If we now evaluate the praise of the "vulgare [. . .] illustre, cardinale, aulicum et curiale" and of its practition- ers (DVE I, xix, 1, those "doctores illustres [. . .] ut Siculi, Apuli, Tusci, Romandioli, Lombardi et utriusque Marchie viri") on the one hand, and the condemnation of those who desert their native tongue, on the other hand, we must be struck by the fact that Dante cannot have singled out Sordello for the choices the troubadour had made in his life on earth. To return to the Convivio, we read there (i, xi, 21) that those who, like Sordello, despised the potential worth of the Italian vulgare illustre are con- demned in the strongest possible terms as "li abominevoli cattivi d'ltalia che hanno a vile questo prezioso volgare, lo quale, s'e vile in alcuna [cosa], non e se non in quanto elli suona ne la bocca meretrice di questi adulteri." To espouse a foreign vernacular is thus tantamount to linguistic adultery, a betrayal of the ties that bind men and women to their native land through "lo naturale amore de la propria loquela." The greater the native genius and eloquence, the greater the crime. However, Sordello - tantus eloquentie vir - was not only guilty of this linguistic betrayal. He was also guilty of aiding the hated foreigner, Charles I of Anjou, to conquer Southern Italy and Sicily, and set up the Guelf hegemony that prevailed throughout Dante's lifetime. It was in fact the Angevin rulers of Naples that brought about the virtual eclipse of imperial power in Italy and that state of anarchy, division and hatred so vehemently denounced by the poet in the sixth canto ofPurgatorio. All too often, readers forget that this bril- liant artifice of political rhetoric reflects the poet-narrator's own feelings 34</page><page sequence="5">The Unfinished Convivio as a Pathway to the Comedy, JOHN A. SCOTT and is not attributable to his predecessor who had made disastrous, unpa- triotic choices in both his art and his life. The Convivio thus helps us to reassess a crucial episode in the Comedy, by pointing to Sordello's true role in the poem. The troubadour is in fact acting out of character when he abandons his haughty isolationism and leaps up to embrace Virgil at the mere name of his birthplace, Mantua. Just as Manfred and the excommunicate appear in the unexpected guise of sheep (Purg. ill, 79-87) in utter contrast to their fierce contumacy on earth, so Sordello in Purgatorio VI acts in a manner diametrically opposed to his behavior in life.11 Like all the souls in Ante-Purgatory, Sordello is guilty of negligence; as the first poet to appear on the mountain, he stands in exemplary contrast to the last, Arnaut Daniel, who was truly the "miglior fabbro del parlar materno" {Purg. xxvi, 117; emphasis mine). 2. The wellspring of the Second Book of Convivio is found in the writer's manifesto (i, ii, 15) "Movemi timore d'infamia, e movemi disiderio di dottrina dare"; and, in this, it reflects the raison d'etre of the whole work. Here, however, it is above all the "timore d'infamia" that inspires the notorious discussion of allegory, where Dante is bent on devaluing the lit- eral or apparent meaning of certain love poems written after Beatrice's death and in praise of another woman. Almost obsessively, the writer insists that he will now make plain "la vera sentenza di quelle [canzoni], che per alcuno vedere non si pud s'io non la conto, perche e nascosa sotto figura d'allegoria" (i, ii, 17; cf. II, xii, 1, "la esposizione allegorica e vera"; II, xv, 2, "la vera sentenza"). Nothing could be farther from the poet's pur- pose in writing the Comedy, where every resource is brought into play in a sustained attempt to convince the reader of the truth of his account - although even here a word of caution must be sounded, inasmuch as for a medieval writer and his audience "truth" was not necessarily contingent on what we call "reality". In the Convivio, on the other hand, afflicted by poverty and the sufferings of exile, Dante's reputation has suffered. He therefore sets out to redeem it by a work of erudition that will, among other things, clear him of the charge of inconstancy in love levelled by "molti [. . .] udendo me essere dal primo amore mutato"; hence, his first task is to persuade his audience that the woman who had captured his love 35</page><page sequence="6">Dante Studies, CXIII, 1995 was no woman, "nullo migliore argomento era che dire quale era quella donna che m'avea mutato" (in, i, 11). Dante's work, we understand, will purvey knowledge (dottrina dare) - chiefly, in the literal exposition of poems such as "Voi che 'ntendendo il terzo ciel movete" (Book n) and "Amor che ne la mente mi ragiona" (Book in) - and it will rescue his reputation by disclosing the latter's true mean- ing and thus dissipating the infamy surrounding them. That this was a specific moment not only in the poet's career but also in the economy of the Convivio is evident from the fact that allegory is jettisoned in "Le dolci rime d'amor ch'i' solia" and its exposition in the last Book: "E pero che in questa canzone s'intese a rimedio cosi necessario, non era buono sotto alcuna figura parlare [. . .] Non sara dunque mestiere ne la esposizione di costei alcuna allegoria aprire, ma solamente la sentenza secondo la lettera ragionare" (iv, i, 10-11). Having placed the discussion of allegory in the specific context of the Second Book of the Convivio, we may now turn to what Dante writes there. I would ask the reader to [re] read the whole of the first chapter, while bearing in mind the following observations. The first is the corrupt state of the Convivio 's text as we have it. The second is the fact that the term "allegorical" may be applied generically to what are also called the "mystical" senses, which are three in number and of which the first is also called "allegorical." It is this second sense (which henceforth I shall refer to as Allegory2) that the theologians apply differently from the way it is used by poets and in the interpretation of their works: "Veramente li teologi questo senso prendono altrimenti che li poeti" (n, i, 4). Here, Dante is NOT directly referring to two different systems of writing and interpre- tation, where their essential difference "lies in the nature of the literal sense in the one and in the other."12 Third, Dante never uses the term "allegory of the theologians": he simply tells his readers that theologians understand "questo senso" - Allegory2 - in a manner quite different from the way it is used by poets. Fourth, the neologism "allegory of the theolo- gians" has come to mean the way the text of Holy Scripture is structured rather than the point Dante is making here, in Convivio II, which is the way it is interpreted by theologians. For any educated contemporary reader, this would have been a truism. Why, then, does Dante make the point? Surely, not because he felt that his public was likely to mistake the allegory sup- posedly hidden in his canzoni for Allegory2. Instead, it is one of the numer- ous digressions made by a writer bent on displaying his newly-found 36</page><page sequence="7">The Unfinished Convivio as a Pathway to the Comedy, JOHN A. SCOTT erudition, a digression possibly encouraged by the example of Orpheus in II, i, 3, since Orpheus's descent to the underworld made it possible to see in him zfigura Christi.13 What would an educated contemporary have understood by "questo senso," as applied by theologians in biblical exegesis? In the twelfth cen- tury, Honorius of Autun defined it most succinctly: "Allegoria, cum de Christo et Ecclesia res exponitur" (Migne: Patrologia Latina, 172, 359). Just before Dante was born, St. Thomas Aquinas wrote: "sic est allegoricus sensus vel typicus, secundum quod ea quae in veteri testamento con- tigerunt, exponuntur de Christo et Ecclesia."14 And the poet's contempo- rary, Giovanni di Genova, stated in his Catholicon (completed, 1286): "Et scias quod sacra scriptura quatuor modis potest exponi [. . .] Historia docet factum, tropologia faciendum, allegoria credendum, anagogia appe- tendum. Littera gesta docet, quid credas allegoria, moralis quid agas, quo ten- das anagogia" - illustrating this with the example of Jerusalem, which "historice enim est quedam civitas, tropologice est tipus anime fidelis, alle- goricefigura ecclesie militantis, anagogice tipum gerit ecclesie triumphantis."15 To concentrate exclusively on the definition of allegory given in Convivio II, i, 3 ("una veritade ascosa sotto bella menzogna") is to ignore the essen- tial fact that in this passage no mention is made of the (obvious) fact that Scripture's literal sense was chiefly historical and no "bella menzogna" - although even in biblical exegesis it was recognized that certain parts of the Bible had a literal sense which could only be interpreted allegorically or mystically. In this regard, the text of the Song of Songs would tradi- tionally have been considered a "bella menzogna" whose truth had to be sought exclusively in its allegorical senses.16 The other side of the coin for the Dante of the Convivio must have been the essential truth that the poems he had written about Beatrice and his love for her could never be reduced to the level of a "bella menzogna" - any more than his ethical can- zone "Le dolci rime" which he was to gloss in the Fourth Book. Moreover, the pagan poets did not write only belle menzogne: they were capable of composing trustworthy literal accounts of real events, as the highly- charged word scritture make clear in in, iii, 7-8: "Onde si legge ne le storie d'Ercule, e ne l'Ovidio Maggiore e in Lucano e in altri poeti, che combat- tendo con lo gigante che si chiamava Anteo [. . .] E questa battaglia fu in Africa, secondo le testimonianze de le scritture." At this point, we should recall the distinction made in Isidore's Etymologies between historia, argu- mentum, zndfabula: "Inter historiam et argumentum et fabulam interest. 37</page><page sequence="8">Dante Studies, CXIII, 1995 Nam historiae sunt res verae, quae facta sunt. Argumenta sunt quae etsi facta non sunt, fieri possunt. Fabulae vero sunt quae nee facta non sunt, nee fieri possunt, quia contra naturam sunt."17 I would therefore argue that the treatment of allegory in Convivio II does not point so much towards two radically different forms of the literal sense, as to the fundamental idea that biblical exegesis possessed its own special sense of Allegory2, which always referred to matters of the true faith. Confusion is possibly generated by the way editors place a hypothetical altro in their attempts to fill the gap in the manuscript tradition of II, i, 3, between "L'uno si chiama litterale" and "e questo e quello che si nasconde sotto '1 manto di queste favole, ed e una veritade ascosa sotto bella menzogna." Anton Maria Biscioni, in 1723, was the first scholar to notice the lacuna, which he attempted to make good by placing "II secondo si chiama alle- gorico" as a link between the two parts.18 This at least has the virtues of clar- ity and simplicity, unlike the later conjectural "L'altro si chiama allegorico," since it inserts Allegory2 into a clear sequence: "L'uno [. . .] Lo terzo senso [. . .] Lo quarto senso" (n, i, 3-6). And it is this sense that "li teologi [. . .] prendono altrimenti che li poeti" (n, i, 4).19 We may therefore conclude that in Convivio II, i, Dante is preparing the way for the revelation of his love for Lady Philosophy by classifying his poems written for the Donna Gentile as fabulae, with their literal sense thus demoted to the level of "bella menzogna" or a fictitious springboard from which to launch the true, allegorical message. In his unique adaptation of the four senses of biblical exegesis, Dante went so far as to include the alle- gorical justification of 'fabulae, while he felt obliged to point out that the sec- ond sense of the theologians' canon was utterly different and signified truths of the Christian faith. It is moreover possible that this technical excursus was brought about by the choice of the myth of Orpheus, which illustrated the powers of poetry and philosophy but which, for theologians, could bear a Christological interpretation - and we note that Orpheus is placed in Limbo by the poet of the Comedy as zpoeta theologus {Inf. IV, 140). Finally, Dante's wording in "e questo e quello che si nasconde sotto '1 manto di queste favole" may not be (as so many have claimed) the equivalent of the theologians' dismissal of ALL poetry as mere fables. Since we have no referent for "queste favole" in the text that has come down to us, the fables in question may well have been limited to the belle menzogne of Ovid's mythological fables or the personification allegory of Vita Nuova xxv, 9. 38</page><page sequence="9">The Unfinished Convivio as a Pathway to the Comedy, JOHN A. SCOTT All this seems to point to the fact that the Convivio represents an inter- mediate stage between the discussion of allegory and figures of speech in Vita Nuova xxv, 8-10 and Dante's use of allegory in the poema sacro. There, in a unique amalgam combining fabulous mythological figures such as the Minotaur and Pluto with the most sacred historical personages of Christian history, we find what we may call Dante's figural allegorism, which "is his own, new and revolutionary, and neither that of the poets nor that of the theologians."20 In the Second Book of the Convivio, while making "the troublesome claim that biblical exegesis could be used to elu- cidate the significance of a secular poem" Dante compounded "his bold- ness by giving overt exemplary citations from Scripture," something found only in his Comedy and in the Epistle to Cangrande.21 And while writing the Fourth Book - where he rediscovered Virgil, as we shall see - the Christian poet began to learn from the example of the Aeneid "how to compose a narrative poem which describes actions as though they were historical, to compose a fiction that is intended to be taken as historically true."22 Thus, the discussion of allegory in Convivio II and the discovery of the true core of Virgil's poem, which had been hidden under allegorical incrustations, led to the composition of a sacred poem "al quale ha posto mano e cielo e terra" (Par. xxv, 2) - and the abandonment of the unfin- ished Convivio. But that, of course, is not the end of our story. To return to the Second Book of the Convivio, we note that in his expo- sition of the literal sense of his ode "Voi che 'ntendendo" Dante makes a fascinating excursus into angelology (II, ii, 7-n, vi, 10), whereby he claims inter alia that angels had been glimpsed by the pagans as through a glass darkly, so that in Greco-Roman myth they were invoked as "Dei e Dee" (II, iv, 6) with temples set up to them. Dante's syncretism is nowhere more in evidence than in this unique assimilation of the pagan Olympians into Christian angelology - to the extent that no Olympian is found in the Inferno, while it underpins Beatrice's discourse in Paradiso IV, 5S-63.23 Less idiosyncratic is the concomitant idea that those "intelligenze, le quali la volgare gente chiamano Angeli" (Conv. II, iv, 2) correspond to the "movi- tori di quelli [cieli]" posited by Aristotle and taken up by Arab philoso- phers. What seems to be unique to Dante, however, is his emphasis on angelic motor function as well as the distinctive one-to-one correspon- dence between the various heavens and the orders of angels assigned to them. Here, for the first time, we find Dante mapping out the celestial hierarchy as he would enshrine it in the Paradiso (with one important 39</page><page sequence="10">Dante Studies, CXIII, 1995 exception, in Par. xxvili, 98-139): the order of the nine heavens, above which is found "lo cielo Empireo" (Conv. II, iii, 8). For Dante, each heaven is moved by a different order of angels (II, v, 12-13), whereas St. Thomas had assigned the movement of all the heavens to the Virtues alone.24 This apparently unimportant detail is in fact symptomatic not only of the Convivio but also of an important aspect of Dante's mature thought, for it leads to a division throughout the nine angelic orders. Dante begins by stating that "li movitori di quelli [cieli] sono sustanze separate da mate- ria, cioe intelligenze, le quali la volgare gente chiamano Angeli" (n, iv, 2). He proceeds to argue that, since the beatitude of the contemplative life is superior to that afforded by the active life, it must follow that such blessed creatures are not deprived of it; however, since the angels' intellect is "uno e perpetuo," they can only enjoy one type of beatitude, hence "conviene essere altre [. . .] che solamente vivano speculando" (li, iv, 11). The latter are in a majority. Now, however, Dante muddies the waters by agreeing that "la speculativa vita" is the only one meet for the angelic nature. He therefore goes on to claim that "pure a la speculazione di certe [sustanze separate] segue la circulazione del cielo, che e del mondo governo" (li, iv, 13), thus contradicting his basic premise: "E con cio sia cosa che quella che ha la beatitudine del governare non possa l'altra avere [...]" (li, iv, 11). This contradiction points to an essential and all-too-easily forgotten truth: that the Convivio as we have it was not only left unfinished (only four sections were actually written out of the fifteen planned: I, i, 14) and unrevised by Dante, but that what we have is a highly corrupt text.25 However, it must also be pointed out that, whereas the distinction between the active life and the life of contemplation may strike us as a medieval commonplace (ultimately derived from Aristotle's Ethics x, 7-8), its application to angelic activity is in fact neither Aristotelian nor Thomist but very much Dante's own. His argument, based on the fact that "qui [on earth] l'umana natura non pur una beatitudine abbia, ma due, si com'e quella de la vita civile, e quella de la contemplativa" (li, iv, 10), is not merely an obvious case of anthropomorphism. It is typical of Dante's whole attitude in the Convivio, which leads him to divide up human activ- ities into separate compartments. As far removed as this attitude may at first appear from the poet's vision in the Comedy, it nevertheless points the way to the largely autonomous - if complementary - spheres of influence which form an integral part of the divine poem: the empire and the papacy; philosophy and theology (Virgil/Beatrice; Aquinas/Siger). As the 40</page><page sequence="11">The Unfinished Convivio as a Pathway to the Comedy, JOHN A. SCOTT highly unorthodox assignation of the sciences to the various spheres makes clear by placing ethics above metaphysics (n, xiii, 8), Dante is most original in his resolve to break away from the rigidly hierarchical struc- tures of medieval thought, so that for the author of the Convivio and the Comedy relative inferiority does not necessarily imply subjection. At this point, a digression may allow us to make a small contribution to the on-going debate regarding the authenticity of the Epistle to Cangrande. To the evidence marshalled by Robert Hollander must now be added the fact - first noted by Stephen Bemrose - that in the gloss to Paradiso 1, 13 ("buono Appollo, a l'ultimo lavoro") we read that such invo- cations were made by the ancient poets "cum aliquid contra comunem modum hominum a superioribus substantiis petendum est" (Ep. xiii, 47). 26 It is surely highly significant that the author of the Epistle does not use the phrase a diis but a superioribus substantiis when referring to Apollo and his ilk, since - as far as we know - only Dante assimilated the pagan deities to separated substances or angelic intelligences. The theme of the Third Book is announced in the closing chapter of the Second (II, xv, 3-4): it will be the nobility of Lady Philosophy, who - "ornata d'onestade, mirabile di savere, gloriosa di libertade" - brings sal- vation to human beings by her teachings and saves them from the death of ignorance and vice: "Veramente in voi e la salute, per la quale si fa beato chi vi guarda, e salvo da la morte de la ignoranza e da li vizii." The con- cluding statement reaffirms the identity of Dante's beloved - "la bellis- sima e onestissima figlia de lo imperadore de lo universo, a la quale Pittagora pose nome Filosofia" (n, xv, 12) - , where the writer has already adumbrated that extraordinary conflation of philosophy with divine wisdom that is the hallmark of the Third Book. 3. In the commentary Dante wrote to his ode "Amor che ne la mente mi ragiona," we are are told why his lady was called "Filosofia" (in, xi, 5-6). Moreover, "utile a tutte le genti [. . .] l'aspetto suo aiuta la nostra fede, la quale piu che tutte Paltre cose e utile a tutta Pumana generazione"; and, as a miracle which can be experienced daily, she is living proof of the mir- acles performed by Christ and the saints (in, vii, 15-16). Philosophy is then defined as "uno amoroso uso di sapienza, lo quale massimamente e in Dio [. . .] E adunque la divina filosofia de la divina essenza [. . .] ed e 41</page><page sequence="12">Dante Studies, CXIII, 1995 nobilissima, pero che nobilissima e la essenzia divina [. . .] Per che dire si puo che Dio non vede, cioe non intende, cosa alcuna tanto gentile quanto questa [. . .] sposa de lo Imperadore del cielo [. . .] e non solamente sposa, ma suora e figlia dilettissima!" (ill, xii, 12-14). This grafting of sapiential discourse onto Dante's philosophical amalgam embracing both Aristotelian and Platonic elements, leads to such impassioned outpourings as: "E cosi si vede come questa e donna primamente di Dio e secondaria- mente de Paltre intelligenze separate, per continuo sguardare; e appresso de Pumana intelligenza per riguardare discontinuato" (ill, xiii, 7) and "Dio questo amore a sua similitudine reduce, quanto esso e possibile a lui assimigliarsi" (ill, xiv, 3). With Solomon, Dante could now cry out: "Hanc amavi, et exquisivi a juventute mea [. . .] et amator factus sum formae illius" (Wisdom, 8, 2). This heady mixture will also lead to the praise and description of Beatrice's beauty in such passages as Paradiso xviii, 8-21, xxvii, 104-105 ("ridendo tanto lieta, / che Dio parea nel suo volto gioire"), and xxx, 19-21: La bellezza ch'io vidi si trasmoda non pur di la da noi, ma certo io credo che solo il suo fattor tutta la goda. Indeed, the whole transformation of the silent Beatrice of the Vita Nuova into Beatrix loquax, the spokesperson for Divine Wisdom, is prepared for by Dante's conception of Lady Philosophy in the Third Book of the Convivio, whereby her demonstrations and proofs make it possible for mortals in this life to taste "quel piacere altissimo di beatitudine, lo quale e massimo bene in Paradiso" (in, xv, 2).27 As Joan Ferrante points out, it must never be forgotten that Beatrice's role in the Comedy was one "specifically forbidden to women by major theologians, as priest, as con- fessor and teacher of theology."28 Dante's revolutionary portrayal of Beatrice not only as his teacher but as a supreme authority who goes so far as to accuse churchmen on earth of propagating untruths {Par. XXDC, 71- 126) was surely made possible both by the poet's vision of Beatrice Portinari in glory and by the exaltation of God's "bellissima e onestissima figlia" in Convivio III. Even this rapid overview raises the fundamental question: does the Convivio represent a stage in Dante's life when he became besotted with the study of philosophy to such an extent that he later felt it necessary to repent of such a passion in his Christian masterpiece? As far as internal 42</page><page sequence="13">The Unfinished Convivio as a Pathway to the Comedy, JOHN A. SCOTT evidence is concerned, we may focus on two essential passages. The first is for me clear proof that - unlike his Ulysses - the author of the Convivio did not go beyond the bounds set by God, since he took care to quote Ecclesiasticus 3, 22 as follows: "Piu alte cose di te non dimanderai e piii forti cose di te non cercherai; ma quelle cose che Dio ti comando, pensa, e in piu sue opere non sie curioso" (ill, viii, 2; cf. IV, xiii, 9). The second is the Platonic assertion of man's intellectual limitations in the last chapter of the Third Book (ill, xv, 6), where Dante writes: "in alcuno modo queste cose nostro intelletto abbagliano, in quanto certe cose affermano essere, che lo 'ntelletto nostro guardare non puo, cioe Dio e la etternitate e la prima materia; che certissimamente si veggiono e con tutta fede si cre- dono essere." Far from an infatuation leading to a Ulyssean "folle volo," we learn in the Fourth Book that Lady Philosophy's manner changed, so that her "atti disdegnosi e feri" caused Dante to moderate his studies, "per la qual cosa un poco dal frequentare lo suo aspetto mi sostenni" (iv, i, 8). The man who asserted that the human soul ("forma nobilissima di queste che sotto lo cielo sono generate") "naturalmente disia e vuole essere a Dio unita" (ill, ii, 6-7) was no crypto-heretic.29 When we turn to the Comedy, we find that the poet did not hesitate to place that radical Aristotelian, Siger de Brabant, among the blessed in Heaven {Par. x, 133-138). Virgil's role in guiding the pilgrim to the Earthly Paradise is even more significant. However, we must first turn to the Casella episode on the shores of Mount Purgatory, where (Purg. II, 112-123) Cato rebukes Dante, Virgil and others for their negligence in lis- tening to the sweet tones of Amor che ne la mente mi ragiona. Robert Hollander tells us that the scoglio mentioned by Cato and which makes impossible the vision of God is, in Dante's case, "the shed skin of his for- mer poetic life [. . .] it is his Convivio99 a work that represents "his own past folle volo.99 Hollander also claims that this episode in Purgatorio "is the first time in the Commedia that the Convivio is explicitly referred to."30 We must, however, question whether such a claim is valid: is the Convivio "explicitly referred to" in Purg. II? The simple answer is no. The only explicit reference is to a poem of Dante's which was written long before the Convivio was begun, but which we dantisti know was declared to be a passionate hymn to philosophy in Convivio ill. We must therefore ask ourselves another question: could Dante's first readers have been expected to know this? The answer once again is no, for Dante could not have expected his readers to be acquainted with the 43</page><page sequence="14">Dante Studies, CXIII, 1995 Convivio, let alone know that Amor che ne la mente was supposed to be a poem addressed to Philosophy. All the evidence points to the fact that the Convivio was unknown to Dante's contemporaries. Lino Pertile is therefore quite right in arguing that "when in Purgatorio II Casella sings Amor che ne la mente mi ragiona, it is one of Dante's old love songs that he sings, not a can- zone to Lady Philosophy from the Convivio [. . .] as far as his readers were concerned, the Convivio [. . .] lay outside the frame of reference upon which they could draw for their interpretation of the text." In fact, the first commentator who links the ode to the Convivio is Cristoforo Landino; although, far from denouncing it as an obstacle, Landino claims that it restores the souls for the arduous ascent of the Mountain of Purgatory.31 Pertile asserts (ibid., 60) that I deny that Dante was ever infatuated with philosophy. I do not. What I have emphasized is the fact that there is not one scrap of hard evidence in his writings to indicate any deviation from what Dante at least regarded as orthodox Christian thought. We must remember that he lived in an age of intense philosophical speculation, when there pre- vailed in Western Europe a degree of latitude that would be unthinkable at the time of the Counter Reformation. Instead, we do a disservice to such Christian thinkers as Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas and Dante Alighieri, when we project our own uncertainties on their belief in the power of human reason and thus fail to accept their fundamental premise that the truths of religion and philosophy were ultimately compatible. There is not one mite of evidence to suggest that Dante, both philoso- pher and philomythes, the man who wrote the Monarchia and the Questio de aqua et terra as well as the Paradiso in the last decade of his life, ever renounced philosophy as one means of arriving at the truth necessary to humanity in via. Indeed, in the eighth heaven, Dante goes so far as to claim that his love of God has been inspired not only by revelation but also by the proofs of philosophy: E io: "Per filosofici argomenti e per autorita che quinci scende cotale amor convien che in me si 'mprenti." (Par. xxvi, 25-27) Once more, in fact, the ideal harmony resulting from the results of ratio- nal investigation and revelation is affirmed in St. John's synthesis: 44</page><page sequence="15">The Unfinished Convivio as a Pathway to the Comedy, JOHN A. SCOTT "Per intelletto umano e per autoritadi a lui concorde d'i tuoi amori a Dio guarda il sovrano." (ibid., 46-8) Despite the insurmountable difficulties posed by certain metaphysical problems "massimamente in quelle parti dove io mirava e cercava se la prima materia de li elementi era da Dio intesa" (Conv. IV, i, 8), when Lady Philosophy - far from seducing him - estranged the novice with "atti dis- degnosi e feri" (Le dolci rime, v. 5), Dante turned his full attention to the study of ethics, "che Morale Filosofia, secondo che dice Tommaso [. . .] ordina noi a Paltre scienze" (Conv. II, xiv, 14).32 Philosophy remained for Dante "uno amoroso uso di sapienza, lo quale massimamente e in Dio" (ill, xii, 12), but with a highly practical application to the problems posed by the government of this world. Maria Simonelli is quite right in claiming that "la prima concezione dantesca del Paradiso" is to be found in the celestial cosmology of Book Two, while the universal hierarchy and the problem of causality found in the Third Book (combined with the exaltation of Philosophy as the aux- iliary of Faith) contain "la matrice filosofica della Commedia e in partico- lare della terza cantica."33 4. In the Fourth Book may be found the matrix of Dante's political thought, and especially the discovery of Rome's imperial destiny, so inti- mately bound up with the literal meaning of Virgil's great epic. This part of the Convivio (as long as the other three combined) was written about 1306 and presumably completed just before Dante embarked on his Comedy. He tells us that his love of philosophy made him "amare li segui- tatori de la veritade e odiare i seguitatori de lo errore e de la falsitade" (IV, i, 3). One error above all he found to be most pernicious not only to the individual but to society as a whole: namely, the idea that nobility con- sisted in "antica ricchezza e belli costumi" (iv, iii, 6), a fallacy that had brought about "pessima confusione del mondo" (IV, i, 7). Since the defi- nition is attributed to Frederick II, Dante sets out to reassure his readers that his rebuttal of philosophical error in no way impugns the Emperor's authority in its proper sphere.34 The way he does this leads to a quite 45</page><page sequence="16">Dante Studies, CXIII, 1995 extraordinary digression, covering two whole chapters in modern edi- tions, where Dante for the first time mentions his conversion to the impe- rial thesis, which was accompanied by the conviction that God had populated pagan, republican Rome "non con umani cittadini, ma con divini" (IV, v, 12) and that He had granted them divine assistance at cru- cial moments in their history, in order that Rome might unite the world in that "pax universalis" necessary for the coming of the Redeemer. As mentioned, this political conversion is paralleled by the rediscovery of the true message of Virgil's Aeneid. As Ulrich Leo pointed out in a clas- sic study, the twenty-sixth chapter ofConvivio w is a watershed for Dante's attitude towards the major poets of antiquity.35 Not only is Virgil pro- claimed "lo maggiore nostro poeta" (iv, xxvi, 8), but now for the first time we find reference made to the sixth book of the Aeneid, with its descrip- tion of Aeneas's descent to the underworld. However, Leo omits a crucial element, which is found in Anchises's foretelling of Rome's imperial mis- sion - something already seized upon by Dante as early as the fourth chapter, where Virgil is quoted "quando dice, in persona di Dio parlando: A costoro - cioe a li Romani - ne termine di cose ne di tempo pongo; a loro ho dato imperio sanza fine'" (iv, iv, 11, emphasis mine; cf.Aen. 1, 278-279). This, Virgil's authentic historical and political message, had been ignored for a thousand years or more; and this is surely at least one of the reasons why Virgil first appears to Dante in the Comedy as "chi per lungo silenzio parea fioco."36 The choice of a pagan poet as the pilgrim's companion and guide not only through Hell but also through that most Catholic realm, Purgatory, is astounding, especially when one recalls the general disparagement of poetry by medieval theologians. Aquinas stated baldly that poets were liars; and, in general, poetry was "under continual attack from the secular and (especially) the regular clergy."37 A pagan guide in Hell might just about pass muster; but in Purgatory! Gian Roberto Sarolli claims that "la soteriologia di Virgilio, Vallegoria come senso cristologico e la prowidenzialita dell'Impero romano [. . .] son da con- siderare chiavi di volta, e addirittura conditio sine qua non, del sistema teo- logico-politico della Comedia"38 Virgil thus mirrors the Emperor's role in guiding humanity to the happiness attainable in this life, which is figured in the Earthly Paradise, according to the last chapter of the Monarchia. What is missing, however, is the essential role played by philosophy in this iter: "Imperatore, qui secundum phylosophica documenta genus humanum ad 46</page><page sequence="17">The Unfinished Convivio as a Pathway to the Comedy, JOHN A. SCOTT temporalem felicitatem dirigeret" (Mon. ill, xv, 10; emphasis mine). Virgil's role in the Comedy is thus the culmination of a process that begins in the last book of the Convivio, where Aristotle's supremacy qua philoso- pher is first proclaimed and where Virgil's role in the poem is adumbrated in the pronouncement: "congiungasi la filosofica autoritade con la impe- riale, a bene e perfettamente reggere" (Conv. IV, vi, 18). Only an Aristotelianized Virgil, "mar di tutto '1 senno" {Inf. viii, 7), could represent such a perfect union between philosophy and the Empire, with poetry thrown in for good measure.39 Only thus could one guide represent one half of what Francesco Mazzoni rightly calls "Fallegoria fondamentale del Poema": the way humanity could achieve the beatitudo huius vite, under the guidance of an Emperor who based his rule on the truths of philosophy in order to satisfy "la necessita de la umana civilitade, che a uno fine e ordinata, cioe a vita felice" (Conv. IV, iv, I).40 The declared theme - the true nature of nobility - is developed through chapters 15 to 30, with nobility or the perfection of human nature defined as "'seme di felicitade', messo da Dio ne Vanima benposta" (rv, xx, 9). Strongly opposed to the feudal concept of nobility as a privilege inherited through the family line, Dante attacks the pride of the Uberti and Visconti, affirming that: "'1 divino seme non cade in ischiatta, cioe in istirpe, ma cade ne le singulari persone, e [. . .] la stirpe non fa le singulari persone nobili, ma le singulari persone fanno nobile la stirpe" (iv, xx, 5). A not dissimilar argument is put forward by Charles Martel in reply to Dante's doubt "com'esser pud, di dolce seme, amaro" (Par. VIII, 93ff). The Convivio's disparagement of wealth for its inability to satisfy human needs and desires is clearly reflected throughout the poem, beginning with the appearance of the she-wolf, whose evil nature "mai non empie la bramosa voglia" (Inf. I, 98) in a lexical echo of Convivio IV, xii, 6 ("in nullo tempo si compie ne si sazia la sete de la cupiditate"). Other similarities are even more striking, so that Giorgio Petrocchi could observe: "nella tessitura retorica del I e del II canto deWInferno la memoria letteraria di Dante e piena di echi, di espressioni, di consuetudini stilistiche che avevano trovato la loro forma compiuta gia nel Convivio.''41 The relative paucity of similes in Dante's early poetry is replaced by an ever-increasing presence in the prose of the Convivio, which thus anticipates one of the glories of the Comedy. Moreover, as Ignazio Baldelli observes: "Nella prosa del Convivio, le similitudini [. . .] sono fortemente funzionali al contesto."42 Especially noteworthy is the prevalence of similes in the final 47</page><page sequence="18">Dante Studies, CXIII, 1995 chapters of the unfinished treatise: IV, xxvii, 4, "conviensi aprire l'uomo quasi com'una rosa che piu chiusa stare non puote, e l'odore che dentro generato e spandere" (cf. Par. xxii, 56-57)43; and IV, xxviii, 1-7: la nobile anima ne Pultima etade [. . .] ritorna a Dio, si come a quello porto onde ella si partio quando venne ad intrare nel mare di questa vita [. . .] lo cammino [. . .] diritto e buono, e sanza amaritudine di tempesta [. . .] la naturale morte e quasi a noi porto di lunga navigazione e riposo [. . .] come lo buono marinaio [. . .] cosi noi dovemo calare le vele de le nostre mondane operazioni [. . .] si come uno porno maturo [. . .] E si come a colui che viene di lungo cammino, anzi ch'entri ne la porta de la sua cittade, li si fanno incontro li cittadini di quella, cosi a la nobile anima si fanno incontro [. . .] quelli cittadini de la etterna vita [. . .] e uscir le pare de l'albergo e ritornare ne la propria mansione, uscir le pare di cammino e tornare in cittade, uscir le pare di mare e tornare al porto. This dense cluster of similes and metaphors is immediately followed by an address to the reader of the kind that is such a striking feature of the Comedy: "O miseri e vili che con le vele alte correte a questo porto, e la ove dovereste riposare [. . .] perdete voi medesimi la dove tanto cammi- nato avete!" (iv, xxviii, 7; cf. Ill, v, 22; ill, xv, 17; IV, vi, 19-20; IV, xxvii, 13- 14). In this same final section, Cato, the pagan suicide, makes his first appearance as a figura of the divinity, of the noblest human soul pointing towards God: "E quale uomo terreno piu degno fu di significare Iddio, che Catone? Certo nullo" (IV, xxviii, 15).44 Maria Corti has highlighted the changes found in the sources quoted in the Fourth Book and their significance in plotting a different outlook, more open to religious perspectives, which emerges in the writer's devel- opment and his Weltanschauung. For example, the Aristotelian confidence of the Third Book gives way to a more traditional acceptance of the limi- tations of human reason. Hence, the claim that in this life humanity only desires "quella scienza che qui avere si pud [. . .] Onde, con cio sia cosa che conoscere di Dio e di certe altre cose quello esse sono non sia possi- bile a la nostra natura, quello da noi naturalmente non e desiderato di sapere" (ill, xv, 9-10) is replaced by the realization that the human intel- lect "in questa vita perfettamente lo suo uso avere non puote - lo quale avera in Dio ch'e sommo intelligibile" (iv, xxii, 13).45 Symptomatic of this fundamental change of perspective is Dante's highly idiosyncratic inter- pretation of the visit by the three Marys to Christ's empty tomb in the next section of the same chapter (iv, xxii, 14-17; emphasis mine): "Per queste tre donne si possono intendere le tre sette de la vita attiva, cioe li 48</page><page sequence="19">The Unfinished Convivio as a Pathway to the Comedy, JOHN A. SCOTT Epicurei, li Stoici e li Peripatetici, che vanno al monimento, doe al mondo presente che e recettaculo di corruttibili cose, e domandano lo Salvatore, doe la beat- itudine, e non la truovano [. . .] ne la nostra contemplazione Dio sempre pre- cede, ne mai lui giugnere potemo qui, lo quale e nostra beatitudine somma." This is radically different from the astonishing claim made near the end of the Third Book: "Per le quali tre virtudi [the theological virtues] si sale a filosofare a quelle Atene celestiali, dove li Stoici e Peripatetici e Epicurii, per la l[uc]e de la veritade etterna, in uno volere con- cordevolemente concorrono" (in, xiv, 15; emphasis mine). As Corti remarks with reference to the passage just quoted from the Fourth Book, "Ogni tentazione di filosofia 'umana' a questo punto e superata." The way was open that led towards the desolate landscape of Inferno x.46 Another important shift lies in the authorities quoted by Dante: "le citazioni di fonti religiose sommate superano le aristoteliche [in Conv. iv], mentre nel trattato ill erano meno della meta. Secondo dato: si verifica un incremento di altre auctoritates testamentarie e di varie neotestamentarie [. . .] Di S. Tommaso si hanno tre citazioni esplicite nel IV trattato contro una sola nel resto del Convivio. M1 The synthesis between Aristotelian and Christian thought is clearly evolving and pointing in the direction of the Comedy. A feature common to both works is their structural symmetry, based on the principle "Quella cosa dice l'uomo essere bella, cui le parti debita- mente si rispondono, per che de la loro armonia resulta piacimento" (Conv. I, v, 13) and on the general belief in the importance of numerology in medieval art.48 Instead of the trinitarian number which is at the basis of the Comedy, the number fifteen (3 x 5) is the architectural unit of Books II-IV. In Book Four, with its thirty chapters, the first fifteen refute com- mon errors concerning nobility while the next fifteen expound the author's thesis; moreover, the central part of the discussion is placed in the fifth chapter.49 Dante's sense of balance and proportion - what he was to call "lo fren de Parte" in Purg. xxxiii, 141 - is already in evidence, espe- cially in the Fourth Book: e. g., iv, xii, 20: "Ma perche questo capitolo e alquanto produtto, in capitolo nuovo a la questione e da rispondere" (cf. IV, iv, 14 and xxiv, 18). All this, of course, is but a pathway pointing in the direction of the Comedy. What is lacking are the two most prominent features of the Comedy: its religious universe and its verse form. As far as the latter is con- cerned, the Convivio begins on a polemical note by debasing the value of poetry as a medium for the transmission of knowledge, "per le accidentali 49</page><page sequence="20">Dante Studies, CXIII, 1995 adornezze che quivi sono connesse, cioe la rima e lo ri[ti]mo e lo numero regolato" (i, x, 12). Yet, as Cecil Grayson has observed, although the Convivio represents a "momento [. . .] implicitamente anti-poetico," we do not have even a line of prose by Dante which is not connected with his poetry, so that the grafting of a prose commentary on his verse (in both the Vita Nuova and the Convivio) ultimately leads to the Comedy: "O, per dirlo con altre parole, la Commedia si potrebbe considerare come la soluzione formale di un problema che prima Dante aveva risolto o cer- cato di risolvere innestando la prosa nella poesia."50 The conversion to poetry as the supreme medium for the expression of the totality of human knowledge and experience remains, however, hidden in the no man's land that separates the Convivio from the Comedy. The change is as radical as it is total, for the ode Le dolci rime d'amor is lit- tle more than a spingboard for the virtually autonomous prose section of Convivio IV, whereas for the author of the Comedy, "poetry [. . .] contains the world and expresses it."51 The contest between prose and poetry is clearly formulated in the opening verses of Inferno xxvili: Chi poria mai pur con parole sciolte dicer del sangue e de le piaghe a pieno chT ora vidi, per narrar piu volte? The ineffability topos (v. 4: "Ogne lingua per certo verria meno") is, how- ever, countered by the reality of the poem's achievement in expressing even the most abstruse concepts in that theological and metaphysical zone which had been excluded from the Convivio's ken. "Quella viva Beatrice beata, de la quale piu parlare in questo libro non intendo per proponi- mento" (Conv. II, viii, 7) returns in glory to lead her lover to the vision of metaphysical truths and of God's ultimate reality. Dante now rejoices in his power, "forti cose a pensar mettere in versi" (Purg. xxdc, 42), for poetry's ability to engage not only our rational faculty but every part of our com- plex being lies at the very heart of the "poema sacro / al quale ha posto mano e cielo e terra" (Par. xxv, 1-2). Casting off the limitations of the Convivio, Dante has finally found his vocation as the true poeta-theologus. The pathway leads us only so far. The gap separating the two works is still immense. The Convivio's narrow religious vision had to be immea- surably enlarged. The white heat of Dante's religious convictions had to fuse the atoms of the Convivio in order to create the poetic explosion that gave birth to the Comedy. What brought about that fission we shall never 50</page><page sequence="21">The Unfinished Convivio as a Pathway to the Comedy, JOHN A. SCOTT know, except for what Dante tells us in his poem. Nevertheless, the path- way we have followed is far from constituting an obstacle. In some ways, it was a blind alley - and Dante abandoned it. Yet, it prepared the way, as we have seen. The voice of the prophet may already be heard in the clos- ing section of Convivio IV, vi, 19-20, with its biblical denunciation of con- temporary rulers: Oh miseri che al presente reggete! e oh miserrissimi che retti siete! [. . .] si che a tutti si pud dire quella parola de lo Ecclesiaste: 'Guai a te, terra, lo cui re e fan- ciullo, e li cui principi la domane mangiano!' [. . .] Ponetevi mente, nemici di Dio, a' fianchi [. . .] e dico a voi, Carlo e Federigo regi, e a voi altri principi e tiranni [. . .] Meglio sarebbe a voi come rondine volare basso, che come nibbio altissime rote fare sopra le cose vilissime. The basic image of the Comedy as a pilgrimage as well as an essential part of Marco Lombardo's discourse at the very centre of the Comedy (Purg. xvi, 85-92) are already found in Convivio IV, xii, 15-18: E si come peregrino che va per una via per la quale mai non fue, che ogni casa che da lungi vede crede che sia l'albergo [. . .] cosi Panima nostra, incontanente che nel nuovo e mai non fatto cammino di questa vita entra, dirizza li occhi al termine del suo sommo bene, e pero, qualunque cosa vede che paia in se avere alcuno bene, crede che sia esso. E perche la sua conoscenza prima e imperfetta, per non essere esperta ne dottrinata, piccioli beni le paiono grandi, e pero da quelli com- incia prima a desiderare [. . .] Veramente cosi questo cammino si perde per errore come le strade de la terra. Lastly, there is the pregnant reference to Aeneas's magnanimous descent to the underworld (Dante does not hesitate to use the word "Inferno") in IV, xxvi, 9: "Quanto spronare fu quello, quando esso Enea sostenette solo con Sibilla a intrare ne lo Inferno [. . .] contra tanti pericoli, come nel sesto de la detta istoria si dimostra!" Virgil therefore reappears in Inferno II, 44 as the true magnanimo, whose spronare must lead Dante through Hell and Purgatory contra tanti pericoli. The perfection of Dante's syntax in the Comedy is of course the result of the totality of his multifarious experience as a poet, combining as it does the rarified style of the Vita Nuova, the crude realism of his tenzone with Forese, the pyrotechnics of his rimepetrose, with the conceptual complexity of his doctrinal odes composed by this cantor rectitudinis. To this poetic cru- cible must be added the Convivio with its "totale rielaborazione della strut- tura sintattica" and its creation of a conceptual and philosophical 51</page><page sequence="22">Dante Studies, CXIII, 1995 vocabulary in the Italian vernacular, in a prose work that played a pivotal role in providing the poet of the Comedy with a linguistic mastery and "an abundance of stylistic devices which no European vernacular before him could equal."52 The element uniting both works is surely the author's burning desire to "inducere li uomini a scienza e a vertii" (Conv. I, ix, 7).53 The University of Western Australia Nedlands, Perth, Western Australia NOTES * The closing session of the First International Dante Symposium took place at Columbia University on 24 October 1994, when the theme selected for the three keynote addresses was "Pathways to the Comedy". I wish to thank Professor Robert Hollander and his organizing com- mittee, as well as the Department of Italian at Columbia University, for their kindness in invit- ing me to address the meeting on that auspicious occasion. 1. The most recent hypothesis regarding an abortive sketch of a poem to be written in Latin (at a time when, for Dante, the use of the vernacular was restricted to love poetry) is to be found in: Giorgio Padoan, If lungp cammino del "poema sacro": studi danteschi (Firenze: Olschki, 1993), 5-23 (esp. 22, "Non dunque un poema tripartite sui regni dell'Oltretomba, ma un poema paradisiaco ..."). 2. Ep. xiii, 31: "modum loquendi, remissus est modus et humilis, quia locutio vulgaris in qua et muliercule comunicant"; Giovanni del Virgilio, Ed. 1, 6-7, "tanta quid heu semper iactabis seria vulgo, / et nos pallentes nichil ex te vate legemus?", and 15-16 ("Carmine sed laico: clerus vul- garia tempnit, / et si non varient, cum sint ydiomata mille"). Cf. Erich Auerbach, "Sacrae scrip- turae sermo humilis," Neuphilologische Mitteilungen, XLii: 3-4 (1941), 57-67 (translated by Dante Delia Terza and reprinted in: Erich Auerbach, Studi su Dante [Milano: Feltrinelli, 19775], 165- 185). All quotations from Dante's Latin works are taken from the following edition: Dante Alighieri, Opere minori, Tomo II (Milano-Napoli: Ricciardi, 1979); the Epistole were edited by Arsenio Frugoni and Giorgio Brugnoli, the Egloge by Enzo Cecchini, De Vulgari Eloquentia by Pier Vincenzo Mengaldo, and Monarchia by Bruno Nardi. Quotations from the Vita Nuova follow the edition of Domenico De Robertis: Dante Alighieri, Opere minori, Tomo I, Parte I (Milano- Napoli: Ricciardi, 1984), and those from the Comedy, the edition by Giorgio Petrocchi: La Commedia secondo Vantica vulgata, 4 vols. (Milano: Mondadori, 1966-1967). 3. Cf. Egidio Colonna, De regimine principum, 2. 2. 7: "Videntes . . . Philosophi nullum idioma vulgare esse completum et perfectum, per quod perfecte exprimere possent naturam rerum, et mores hominum, et cursus astrorum, et alia de quibus disputare volebant, invenerunt sibi quasi pro- prium idioma, quod dicitur latinum [. . .] quod constituerunt adeo latum et copiosum, ut per ipsum possent omnes suos conceptus suffkienter exprimere" (quoted by Pier Vincenzo Mengaldo, in his edition of DVE (Dante Alighieri, Opere minori, p. 80 n.; emphasis mine). In the seventy-eighth story of the Nouellino, we read of a philosopher who was eager "di volgarizzare la scienzia." However, he had a dream in which he was visited by the Muses, who appeared to him as prosti- tutes plying their trade in a brothel; when he asked them why they were frequenting such an evil place, they replied "tu se' quelli che vi ci fai istare"; the philosopher thus came to realize that "vol- garizzare la scienzia si era menomare la deitade" and repented of his rash actions (in: Nouellino e Conti del Duecento, ed. S. Lo Nigro [Torino: UTET, 1963], 177-178). 4. DVE I, i, 4: "Harum quoque duarum nobilior est vulgaris." On the relationship between Dante's evaluation of Latin and the vernacular in the Convivio and the DVE (which lies outside the scope of this paper), see: Cecil Grayson, "'Nobilior est vulgaris': Latin and Vernacular in Dante's Thought," in Centenary Essays on Dante by Members of the Oxford Dante Society (Oxford: Clarendon 52</page><page sequence="23">The Unfinished Convivio as a Pathway to the Comedy, JOHN A. SCOTT Press, 1965), 54-76, with the conclusion "what he [Dante] says in De V. E. about the greater nobil- ity of the vernacular [. . .] is his final explicit word on the subject." Grayson rightly sees a shift from Dante's conception of Latin as evidenced by the First Book of the Convivio and his view of it as locutio secundaria in the De Vulgari (70: "Dante has shifted his ground about nobility in the mat- ter of language"). Throughout this essay, I shall follow the chronology put forward by Maria Corti in LafelicM mentale: Nuove prospettive per Cavalcanti e Dante (Torino: Einaudi, 1983), 143-144: "I primi tre trattati del Convivio abbraccerebbero il periodo forlivese e Veronese dal 1303 e forse anche prima a meta del 1304 circa, il De vulgari eloquentia quello intermedio sino al lunigiano-toscano, in cui sarebbe stato composto il IV trattato. [. . .] La cronologia qui proposta spiegherebbe perche* Dante parli nel I del Convivio di un semplice progetto del De vulgari eloquentia, mentre nel IV egli attua un modello stilistico che presuppone dietro di se il De vulgari eloquentia " 5. DVE I, x, 2: "quicquid redactum est sive inventum ad vulgare prosaycum, suum est: videlicet Biblia cum Troianorum Romanorumque gestibus compilata et Arturi regis ambages pulcerrime et quamplures alie ystorie ac doctrine." 6. Brunetto Latini, Li Livres dou Tresor, ed. Francis J. Carmody (Berkeley-Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1948), I. 1. 7 (emphasis mine). 7. Conv. I, v, 2. All quotations are taken from the monumental edition of the Convivio by Cesare Vasoli and Domenico De Robertis, in: Dante Alighieri, Opere minori, Tomo I, Parte H (Milano-Napoli: Ricciardi, 1988). 8. Conv. I, ix, 4-5; emphasis mine. Cf. Richard Lansing, "Dante's Intended Audience in the Convivio" Dante Studies, ex (1992): "Of the four groups that Dante postulates, three are categor- ically banished from the banquet, in not very flattering terms. [. . .] The benefits of the banquet are expressly designed for and addressed to a lay, not a learned audience [. . .] The intended audi- ence [. . .] is defined in scholastic terms on the basis of its opposite, the uninvited, namely the lit- terati or learned [. . .1 one who uses the language in a professional setting" (19). 9. Typical of this conventional interpretation is the article by Marco Boni in the Enciclopedia dantesca (in six volumes; Roma: Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana, 1970-1978), where he con- cludes: "D. fa seguire [. . .] la scena originalissima dell'abbraccio con Virgilio, in cui S. h fatto sim- bolo della 'carita del natio loco' e assurge a figura emblematica di quell'amore tra i cittadini che potrebbe portare rimedio ai mali d'ltalia," although Boni admits that this role "non ha alcun riscontro nel S. storico" (ED, v, 332B). Recent scholarship has, however, called into question this view of Sordello: M.

As Mengaldo notes udeseruit b piu forte del consueto divertere" (Dante Alighieri, Opere minori, Tomo H, 120). The affective "Mantua sua" in Dante's text should also be noted. 11. The affinities of outlook between Dante and the poet who composed the Ensenhamen d'onor, the lament for the death of Ser Blacatz and the sirventes, "Qui be is membra del segle qu'es passatz," logically justify the choice of Sordello as the guide who names the negligent rulers in Purgatorio vii. They do not, however, explain his role in the preceding canto. 12. Charles S.

On the general problem of apparent absurdity in the pages of Holy Scripture, see, e. g., Hugh of St. Victor (PL 176, 802): "Sic divina pagina multa secundum natu- ralem sensum continet, quae et sibi repugnare videntur, et nonnunquam absurditatis aut impos- sibilitatis aliquid afferre.

Aldo Scaglione, "(Christian) Theologians vs. (Pagan) Philosophers," 123. See also the excellent point made (118), that the Epistle to Cangrande does not claim that "the literal sense of the Commedia is the journey, his journey, but the state of the souls after death: status animarumpost mortem. This is, then, the literal sense, and as such it is undoubtedly and absolutely historical, fac- tual, and literally true, even if the denizens of the nether and upper realms may not be precisely the ones we see [. . .]." 21.

Cf. Contra Gentiles n. 92 and ill. 80. 25. "Puo [. . .] valere sempre l'ipotesi che il Convivio sia stato abbandonato come 'uno scartafaccio', non piu considerato dal suo Autore di divulgazione, oltre che di compimento; sup- posizione [. . .] suffragata dallo stato della tradizione manoscritta, tarda, lacunosa e scorretta [. . .] e dal ritardo con cui questo testo 'entra in circolo', solo a partire dal quarto decennio del Trecento" (Cesare Vasoli, Introduzione, bri; cf. lxxxi, with the observation that all the MSS appear to derive from "un esemplare unico che [. . .] si trovava in deplorevoli condizioni per colpa di amanuensi tra i piu trascurati e distratti che si possano immaginare"). 26. 1 refer, of course, to Robert Hollander's closely argued Dante's Epistle to Cangrande (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1993) and to Stephen Bemrose, Dante's Angelic Intelligences, 147: "It is in Dante's invocation, more clearly than in the allusion to Marsyas, that Apollo's angelic nature is hinted at." In the credits and debits of the debate, our fragment of evidence in favor of the Epistle's authenticity immediately precedes the section where the reference to "Tullius in Nova Rethorica" (xiii, 49) elicits the following comment from Giorgio Brugnoli: "La citazione inaudita e l'uso anormale di Cicerone gettano un'ulteriore ombra sulle capacita cultur- ali dell'autore dzWEpistola" (Dante Alighieri, Opere minori, Tomo II, 627, n.). 54</page><page sequence="25">The Unfinished Convivio as a Pathway to the Comedy, JOHN A.

Vittorio Russo, while postulating a philosophical crisis in Dante's intellectual career, demon- strates that, in the Convivio, Amor che ne la mente "subisce una diffrazione di senso," while, in the Comedy, "le due canzoni [Amor che ne la mente and Voi che 'ntendendo, quoted in Par. VIII, 37] ven- gono risospinte al tempo della loro giovanile stesura e alia loro originaria fruizione o interpre- tazione" (V.

For the complex problem concerning what is implied by "se la prima materia e li elementi era da Dio intesa" (where it must be remembered that, in Aristotelian philosophy, primal matter is not "something," hence how is it possible to know it?), see at least Vasoli's commentary (ed. cit, 529-531). 33.

The immensity of Dante's claims for poetry in the Comedy has been stressed recently by Giuseppe Mazzotta in his exciting study, Dante's Vision and the Circle of Knowledge (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1993), esp. 135: "Not the philosopher or the theologian but the poet, who is installed in the world of the imagination [. . .] plays a crucial role in deter- mining the shape of knowledge." 40.

He did not begin as one 55</page><page sequence="26">Dante Studies, CXIII, 1995 [. . .] It seems likely that the absence [of simile] is to be interpreted as yet another aspect of Dante's negative reaction to the modes prevailing in his youth." 43. Patrick Boyde, Dante Philomythes and Philosopher: Man in the Cosmos (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), 231: "In the Convivio (and again in the Paradiso), Dante takes the blooming of the rose as his favourite metaphor of a life come to fulfilment in maturity. [. . .] Texts such as this are the key to the great pageant in the Empyrean when Dante finally sees the blessed 'in the form of a white rose . . .'." 44. Cf. Conv.

See: Maria Corti, Lafelicitd mentale, 123ff. Dante's stance in the Third Book is similar to that of Albertus Magnus and is replaced by the more orthodox affirmation of the supranatural needs of the human intellect, as expressed, e. g., in Purg. xxi, 1-3.

Giuseppe Mazzotta, Dante s Vision and the Circle of Knowledge, 18. It would be impossible to state with greater force the essential dialectic between poetry and knowledge (cf. 14: "Dante writes a poem that retrieves history, the passions of his own life, fables, and theology together in the conviction, first, that poetry is the path to take to come to the vision of God and, second, that the poetic imagination is the faculty empowered to resurrect and glue together the fragments of a broken world." 52.

Gianfranco Contini, Letteratura italiana delle origini (Firenze: Sansoni, 1970), 361: "Diversamente [. . .] dal De vulgari [. . .] l'incompiutezza del Convivio si devia nel passaggio alia Commedia: cosi stretti e incalzanti sono i legami ideologici, tematici e linguistici col poema che questo va considerate l'inveramento finale [. . .] presso gli spiriti nobili ignari di latino, di capi- tali teoremi pratici e politici." 56</page></plain_text>
