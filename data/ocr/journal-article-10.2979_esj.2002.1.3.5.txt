We make a case for treating a web site as  a valid social actor and argue that the relationship between a web site and her visitors should  be characterized in much the same way one would characterize an inter-personal relationship.  We also argue that a web site could possess different levels of para-social presence depending on  how it is con¤gured and used. We then develop a research framework that illustrates the impact  of new technologies (such as personalization systems) and associated web interface design deci- sions on perceived communication characteristics of a web site, para-social presence, and sub- sequent user evaluations of the web site. 1 Based on the conference paper forthcoming at Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences 2002; Kumar and Benbasat, “Para-Social Presence: A Re-conceptualiztion of ‘Social Presence’ to Capture the Emerging Relationship Between a Web Site and Her Visitors,” Collaborations Systems and Technology Track, Proceedings of the HICSS, 2002 © 2002. e-Service Journal.

The multiple capabilities have also meant that there are numerous ways of con¤guring the web as a medium. Most of the design guidelines for generating web interfaces concentrate predominantly on facilitating ef¤cient communications between the user and the web site. We argue that a second dimension of information exchange that emphasizes the relationship-based aspects of communication, such as, creating a positive company image, trust, and a favorable browsing experience, becomes more important in a virtual environment as the web inter- face is the key contact point between an organization and its customers for e-commerce related activities (Benbasat and DeSanctis, 2001).  Even though the initial hype surrounding the dot.com industry has given way to more modest realities (Gartner, 2000), shopping on the Internet is here to stay and will grow. This increased activity has exposed some of the serious limitations consumers face while buying on-line. In the past few years, there has been considerable research done on what makes an e- commerce site successful. A wide range of predictor variables–such as download times and responsiveness (Dellaert and Khan, 1999; Voss, 2000; Weinberg, 2000), background color and pictures (Mandel and Johnson, 1999), product list navigation (Lohse and Spiller, 1998), interactiveness of the web site (Ghose and Dou, 1998), information control (Ariely, 2000), structural and content quality (Davern and Te’eni, 2000), and interactive decision aids (Haubl and Trifts, 2000)–have been investigated in the e-commerce context.  Most of these studies look at the effect of the aforementioned predictor variables on several important issues such as customer’s overall satisfaction, trust, loyalty, decision qual- ity and intention to buy/re-visit the web site. Hoffman and Novak (1996) looked at flow as an experiential construct that positively correlated with a compelling on-line experience for fun, non-work related activities. While the cognitive aspects of web interfaces have been studied, there has been little research on the effect of experiential aspects, an issue that becomes even more critical in e-commerce activities (especially B2C). Though researchers have attempted to address and understand how the emergence of new media with multiple capabilities impacts on the way a ¤rm sells its products on-line, there are interesting research questions spanning several areas that still need signi¤cant research attention. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study are: 1. To develop a new construct Para-social Presence, so that it captures the emerging interac- tion between a web site and her visitors  Social presence has traditionally been used to measure the extent to which a commu- nication media allows a user to establish a personal connection with other users (Short et al., 1976). We examine the fundamental assumptions that drive the concept social 6 </page> <page sequence="3"> Para-Social Presence and Communication Capabilites of a Web Site presence and recast this construct as Para-social presence (PSP) to measure the per- sonal connection that develops between a web site and her users. PSP refers to the extent to which a medium facilitates a sense of understanding, connection, involve- ment and interaction among participating social entities. The term “para” indicates re-conceptualization of social presence in a way that goes beyond what would be con- sidered normal and natural as we make a case for treating a web site as a social entity. In this research, we focus on PSP in a speci¤c context—online shopping. 2. To develop an instrument to measure PSP We borrow extensively from the communication literature to develop an instrument for this construct. We also review communication literature to examine the role of two inter-personal constructs—af¤liation and dominance—in the conceptualiza- tion of para-social presence. Af¤liation and dominance are two fundamental lines along which human beings relate to each other. Af¤liation is expressed and evaluated along a multiplicity of speci¤c dimensions: similarity, affect, receptivity, equality, composure and formality.  3. To investigate how PSP mediates the relation between speci¤c perceived communica- tion characteristics (modality, synchronicity 2 etc) of a web site and user's evaluation of that web site (satisfaction, trust-competence, benevolence and integrity, and loyalty). We argue that web site design decisions—such as support for personalization systems and virtual communities—impact on the communication capabilities of the web site as perceived by customers. We develop a research framework (Figure 1) that shows the relation between these web site design decisions, perceived communication capa- bilities of the web site, PSP and user evaluations of the web site. We intend to show that organizations can use the potent combination of technology and new media characteristics to foster a strong relationship between a web site and her visitors. The next section will briefly review the theoretical work that supports our conten- tion that a web site can be treated as a social entity. It will further review the work done on social presence and lay the groundwork for the development of a broader construct PSP. Then we will focus on the theoretical underpinnings of the construct PSP and discuss its op- erationalization. Finally, we discuss the research framework and future research directions. BACKGROUND User Interaction in E-Commerce and Relational Communication Shopping is a high involvement activity. A major obstacle to consumers buying on- line is the inability of most shopping sites to engage the users cognitively as well as  2Modality is the extent to which a media can support symbol variety (text, audio, and visual) to present rich information. Synchronicity characterizes whether the interaction occurs in real-time or with a time delay. 7 </page> <page sequence="4"> e-Service Journal emotionally. In this era of new retail, shoppers have become guests, shopping has become an experience and malls have become entertainment centers with communi- ties. Realizing the value of “shopping as experience,” many on-line stores have begun efforts to facilitate a positive experience for the casual browser. Even though, web as channel for shopping has its limitations, we believe that an organization can develop a meaningful and rich relationship with its users by using the web interface as its pri- mary contact point.  Researchers in the Communication ¤eld have drawn a conceptual distinction between the content and the relational aspects of communication (Watzlawick et al., 1967). Any given interaction can be analyzed in terms of the content of the message exchange and in terms of what it reveals about the nature and structure of relationship between two participants. The relational aspect of communication can be used to char- acterize and measure interpersonal relationships between participants. Burgoon and Hale (1987) undertook a survey of relational concepts from different disciplines and proposed 12 distinct dimensions to measure the relational aspect of communication: dominance, emotional arousal, composure, similarity, formality, task vs. social orientation, intimacy, familiarity, affection, inclusion, trust and intensity of involvement.  We propose that the relationship between a web site and her customers should be fashioned in the same way one would measure the relational dimension of communica- tion between human participants. We also argue that we need to conceptualize a new construct PSP to measure this relationship. However, this raises two important questions:   Is it appropriate to draw parallels between “relationship among humans” and “relationship between a web site and her users”?   How is PSP different from Social Presence? Is there really a need for another construct? Computers as Social Entities: Theory of Social Response Reeves, Nass and their colleagues at the Center for the Study of Language and Informa- tion at Stanford have shown that even experienced users tend to respond to computers as social entities (Nass et al., 1995a; Nass et al., 1995b; Nass and Steur, 1994). These studies indicate that computer users follow social rules concerning gender stereotypes and polite- ness, and that these social responses are directed to the computer as a social entity and not to the programmer. When explicitly asked by the researchers, most users consistently said that social responses to computers were illogical and inappropriate. Yet, under appropri- ate manipulation, they responded to the computer as though it were a social entity. This, in fact, is the essence of the ‘Theory of Social Response’ (Moon, 2000; Reeves et al., 1997). Moon (2000, p.325) in a recent paper, argued that, 8 </page> <page sequence="5"> Para-Social Presence and Communication Capabilites of a Web Site “More speci¤cally, when presented with a technology possessing a set of characteristics normally associated with human behavior—such as language, turn taking, and interactivity—humans respond by exhibiting social behav- iors and making social attributions. Consequently, many of the same social conventions that guide interpersonal behavior are also evident in human- computer interaction, even when the conventions no longer make ‘rational’ sense in this different context. . . . The theory of social response also leads to some interesting insights regarding how people generate the psychological boundaries associated with these relationships. The evidence suggests that these boundaries are structured by the physical and behavioral characteristics of the computer. For example, in studies involving text based computer interfaces with unremarkable features, researchers have found that users tend to psychologically orient themselves to the box. . . . In short, it appears that the most salient cue—whether it be the box, the voice (voice based output) or the agent (computer interfaces with text based or graphics based computer agents)—is also likely to become the relational target of the social response” We describe the web site as a social actor/social entity to illustrate the non-trivial fact that there are several points-of-contact between a web site and her users that will result in responses by the users not unlike the way they would respond to a social interaction. Hence, we believe that there is value in conceptualizing the web site as a social actor and that the web site can be equated to the ‘agents’ mentioned above in terms of source ori- entation. While we argue that the structure of this relationship is not dissimilar to the structure of inter-personal relationship, not all elements of the relationship dimensions may apply equally well to interactions with a web site. This research attempts to flesh out those dimensions that are most appropriate. We develop the construct PSP to capture and emphasize the essence of this interaction-dimension between a web site and her vis- itors. This construct would be important, as the decision to browse for more information or to buy is most often based on the interaction of a shopper and the sense of af¤nity and immersion he/she feels with the web site. To develop the PSP construct, we begin by re- examining the assumptions of social presence and attempting to situate it among other conceptualizations of presence. Social Presence Social presence refers to the degree to which a medium allows a user to establish personal connection with the other users (Short et al., 1976). A high presence medium is rated toward the sociable, warm and personal end of the continuum. The theory further pos- tulates that the level of social presence needed by a particular communication task deter- mines the use of a medium (task-medium ¤t hypothesis). The theoretical foundation of 9 </page> <page sequence="6"> e-Service Journal Social Presence draws from Daft and Lengel’s (Daft and Lengel, 1986; Daft et al., 1987) Media Richness Theory, and Short, Williams and Christie’s (1976) Social Presence The- ory. Carlson and Davis (1998) characterize richness of a medium as the capacity for a medium to convey rich information, that is the ability to give immediate feedback, vari- ety of communication cues available, language variety attainable and personalization of the medium. Researchers have long been interested in media selection: given the choice, which media would one choose to accomplish a certain task? For example, one might prefer to use email to convey unpleasant information.  Researchers have used Media Richness and Social Presence theories to rank the media in order of increasing media richness and social presence respectively. Media Rich- ness theory postulates that media selection depends on the equivocality and uncertainty of the task at hand. Social Presence theory postulates that selection of media is based on the degree to which social presence is necessary for a particular communication task. These two theories together have been grouped under “Trait Theories of Media Selection” because of the similarity of their approaches to media selection (Carlson and Davis, 1998). However, empirical evidence so far has been mixed for both of these theories espe- cially in the case of media selection (Dennis and Kinney, 1998; Webster and Trevino, 1995). One of the reasons for this is the insuf¤cient (and still evolving) understanding about the usage of newer media. Media selection and use is also a function of social influ- ences: users over time ascribe certain characteristics to the media that might increase or decrease the richness of the medium. For example Markus (1994) showed that e-mail, traditionally thought of as a lean medium, can be used for richer communication when the social processes surrounding media use de¤ne it as a rich medium. However, we believe that the construct “presence” has great potential and much wider meaning, if we step back and examine the basic assumptions of Social Presence theory.  Presence: A Re-Conceptualization Researchers from a wide array of ¤elds (such as communication, computer science, psy- chology, information systems, organizational behavior and cognitive science) have stud- ied presence, even though the conceptualizations made different assumptions about the construct and the domain it is situated in (from the psychophysical to psychological). Lombard and Ditton (1997) identi¤ed six different conceptualizations of presence:  Presence as “Social Richness.” This is the conceptualization (social presence) that is familiar to most of the researchers in Management Information Systems and Organizational Behavior ¤elds. It has been predominantly used to study media selection. We argue that this construct has great potential if it can be recast to connote a broader meaning. For an excellent summary of the social presence theory and related research, see Carlson and Davis (1998) and Burke and Chidambaram (1999).  10 </page> <page sequence="7"> Para-Social Presence and Communication Capabilites of a Web Site Presence as “Realism.” Presence is conceptualized as the degree to which a medium can produce realistic representations of the “things” one is interested in. This conceptualization has been widely used by researchers in computer graphics and human factors ¤eld. This can further be sub-divided into two orthogonal categories: perceptual and social realism. For example, the movie “Star Wars” may be high in perceptual realism but low in social realism. On the other hand, the usual animation techniques used in seri- als like “Simpsons” are low in perceptual realism, but high in social realism. The well- known Japanese animation (anime) is an example of a representation that is high in per- ceptual realism. Presence as “Transportation.” Sensations of “you-are-there,” “it-is-here” and “we-are-together” are the centerpiece of this conceptualization. Virtual Reality is the clas- sic example of “you are there” sensation and should ideally lead to sensations of being transported to the world generated by the computer environment. The second kind of conceptualization is directly linked to the sensation that television viewers might feel when watching TV. Usually, the viewers feel as though the events are being brought into their drawing room (Millerson, 1969). The third kind of sensation “we are together” is similar to the tele-presence concept used to describe video conferencing applications. Presence as “Immersion.” This conceptualization seeks to measure the extent to which a virtual environment immerses a user perceptually as well as psychologically. Mea- sures have been developed to measure perceptual immersion (Biocca and Delaney, 1993) and psychological immersion (Heeter, 1995). Perceptual immersion usually emphasizes psychophysical responses while psychological immersion primarily emphasizes user’s involvement at a psychological level. Presence as “Social Actor within Medium.” This conceptualization of presence addresses social responses of media users to entities within a medium. Typical examples include: responses of users to television personalities even though this relationship is one- sided, responses of users to interpersonal distance cues from across the medium, and responses of users to virtual actors (e.g.: Microsoft’s of¤ce assistant, Virtual raising of pets through a key chain). Presence as “Medium as a Social Actor.” This conceptualization is similar to presence as “social actor within a medium,” but this presence captures social responses of media users to the cues provided by a medium. Studies have shown that users respond to social cues exhibited by the medium and respond to the medium as though it were a social entity (Nass et al., 1995a; Nass et al., 1995b; Nass and Steur, 1994). Lombard and Ditton (1997) propose that the essential element for conceptualizing presence is the idea of perceptual illusion of non-mediation. However, we argue that illu- sion of non-mediation is an important issue only for immersive environments such as vir- tual reality. When two social actors communicate in a mediated environment, these actors get used to this mediated environment over time and ascribe characteristics to the 11 </page> <page sequence="8"> e-Service Journal media that might increase or decrease the richness of the medium. E-mail (Markus, 1994) and instant messenger systems are two classic examples of this phenomenon.  Hence, we argue that for cases that involve facilitation of communication between two social actors, it is more elegant and parsimonious to concentrate purely on psychologi- cal rather than psychophysical dimensions. We argue that it is possible to reconceptualize social presence (presence as social richness) to include the last two conceptualizations: social actor within a medium and medium as a social actor. The other conceptualizations are equally important, but they do not ¤t well with the construct we are developing and are outside the scope of the paper. PARA-SOCIAL PRESENCE Para-Social Presence: Theoretical Development  Our conceptualization of presence focuses on the underlying structure of relationships facilitated by the medium. We use the term para-social presence (PSP) to denote this construct and borrow extensively from the communication literature (Burgoon et al., 2000; Burgoon and Hale, 1987) to develop an instrument for this construct. Para-social presence refers to the extent to which a medium facilitates a sense of understanding, con- nection, involvement and interaction among participating social entities. Table-1 shows the difference between Social Presence (SP) and Para-social presence (PSP). The arrow indicates the fact that the use of SP has evolved over the years to include synchronous and asynchronous groups. Please see Burke and Chidambaram (1999) and Karahanna and Straub (1999) for recent examples of work on SP. Table 1: Social Presence vs. Para-Social Presence Traditional SP PSP Synchronous Groups (Fulk &amp; Boyd, 1993)  →Synchronous &amp; Asynchronous Groups Organizational Settings              →Org.

(Blurring  a medium of interaction of Media and Interface) Virtual Teams Virtual Teams &amp; Virtual Community Are the users connected through the medium, for a Manner in which the web can bring together  speci¤c purpose, pre-determined? people with similar goals and interests  (connectivity) Unidimensional (Short et al., 1976) Multidimensional We further posit that reconceptualizing SP to connote a broader meaning (as indi- cated by Table-1) will result in the de¤nition of a new construct PSP that will measure the emerging interaction between two or more social entities separated by time and space. PSP differs substantially from the conceptualization of Social Presence in that it seeks to include all valid social actors (such as web sites) and not just human participants.  12 </page> <page sequence="9"> Para-Social Presence and Communication Capabilites of a Web Site The participating social entities, the medium, and the way the medium is con¤gured influences para-social presence. In our view, the advent of the web has blurred the distinction between the media and the interface of the web site. It is possible for an organization to make web interface design decisions that would affect the characteristics of web as a medium for that web site. Our theorizing is still in early stages, but we argue that it would be bene¤cial to de-link the construct PSP from the media as the distinction between web as a medium and the web interface becomes blurred. Instead, we seek to capture the underlying structure of relationship that emerges between participating social entities. Earlier, we proposed that para-social presence should be fashioned in the same way one would measure the relational dimension of communication between human participants. We borrow measures from Burgoon et al., (2000) for dimensions such as sense of under- standing, involvement, immediacy, intimacy and dominance as they capture the essence of the structure of relationship that develops between a web site and her users. Even though Burgoon and Hale (1987) had identi¤ed 12 sub-components of rela- tional communication, Dillard et al., (1999) argued that relational judgments are hierar- chically organized and that most of the relational sub-components can be subsumed under two fundamental dimensions—dominance and af¤liation. They conducted a con¤rmatory factor analysis in an attempt to replicate Burgoon et al’s (1987) study and re¤ned the sub-components to nine: Immediacy, Affect, Similarity, Receptivity, Compo- sure, Formality, Dominance, Equality and Involvement. They empirically showed that the second order factor analysis of the original sub-components yielded just two factors: dominance and af¤liation. The second-order factor dominance is substantively similar to the ¤rst order dominance subscale, while af¤liation is a complex construct. They further depicted dominance and af¤liation as competing frames for interpreting involvement cues during social interaction.  Despite the claim that social relationships are invariably analyzed in terms of dominance and af¤liation, it does not follow that individuals attend to both concepts simultaneously. . . . Group life entails interaction and interac- tion requires making predictions about the intentions of others. If the other individual means to harm, then one must choose between retreat and counterattack. . . . By providing a means of interpreting the actions of others, frames provide a basis for the action. Because the appropriate response to perceived dominance/submission versus af¤liation/conflict are typically quite different, dominance and af¤liation frames tend to be mutually inhibitory. Put differently, they are inclined toward differential salience. When the dom- inance frame is salient, the af¤liation frame recedes into the background of subjective experience. Conversely, when the af¤liation frame is fore- grounded, the dominance frame is less salient. (Dillard et al., 1999, p.52) 13 </page> <page sequence="10"> e-Service Journal This research argues that af¤liation is the salient frame in the context of on-line shopping. Further, this research considers only affect, receptivity, immediacy and involvement as indicative of relational judgments in this context. Similarity, formality, composure and equality are not included for the sake of parsimony and relevance. When one of the social entities is a web site, factors such as similarity, composure and equality may not be as relevant. Further, one needs to be very careful in framing statements of relational judgments, as equating a web site explicitly to a human being might cue the users into rejecting such an attribution according to the Theory of Social Response (Moon, 2000; Reeves et al., 1997).  Of the four sub-dimensions selected, receptivity is replaced with sense of under- standing as this is a stronger form of receptivity and is more appropriate in this context. We use the term ‘positivity’ to denote the sub-component ‘affect’ as the latter term might have strong connotations. This construct can also be used in the context of Distributed GSS (with minor modi¤cations) where the Group Support System replaces the web site and vir- tual teams replace the virtual communities that exist in the shopping or any other context.  We include the major sub-dimensions of the construct PSP and the items used to tap these sub-dimensions in Appendix-1. These are items generated by re¤ning the initial set of items using the card sorting techniques developed and reported by Moore and Ben- basat (1991)[24]. Then we plan to conduct a ¤eld study to validate the instrument and conduct a con¤rmatory factor analysis. In the next section, we develop a research frame- work that conceives of PSP as a central construct that mediates the relation between com- munication characteristics of the web site and user’s evaluation of that web site. The communication characteristics of the web site can be manipulated by the interface design decisions made and underlying technologies used by that web site (for example: level of support for personalization). This in turn affects PSP and subsequently the evaluation criteria. We start the next section with a brief review of the literature in this area and attempt to justify why we use this as a starting point in our research framework. RESEARCH FRAMEWORK In the past two decades, many theories of media choice and effects (Daft and Lengel, 1986; Dennis and Valacich, 1999; Fulk and Boyd, 1993; Short et al., 1976; Walther, 1992) have identi¤ed a set of media characteristics and investigated their impact on media choice and media use. The early theories (Daft and Lengel, 1986; Short, et al, 1976) on media choice and use viewed these media characteristics as invariant and assumed that all these characteristics are salient to the individual. The later theories (Dennis and Kinney, 1998; Fulk and Boyd, 1993; Walther, 1992; Webster and Trevino, 1995) acknowledged the impact of social influence and recognized media characteristics as perceived characteristics. Table-2 reviews the list of characteristics of communication media that have been developed previously. 14 </page> <page sequence="11"> Para-Social Presence and Communication Capabilites of a Web Site Table 2: Media Characteristics Developed in Previous Research Daft and Lengel (1986), Daft, Lengel and Trevino (1987)—Media Richness Theory   Immediacy of Feedback: The extent to which a medium allows users to give rapid feed- back on the communications they receive.   Multiple Cues: The number of cues—such as text, verbal cues or non-verbal cues—avail- able through which information can be communicated.   Language Variety: The range of meaning that can be conveyed with language symbols (numeric information to natural language).    Personal Focus: The extent to which a sender can personalize the message to suit the needs and the current situation of the receiver. Sproull (1991), Valacich et al., 1993—Additional List of Characteristics for the  Electronic Media   Multiple Addressability: The extent to which a message can forwarded to several persons at the same time (exact de¤nition. to be added soon).   Externally Recorded Memory: The extent to which message can be stored for further processing (exact de¤nition to be added soon).   Concurrency: The capacity of media to support distinct communication episodes with- out distracting from any other episodes that may be occurring simultaneously. Dennis and Valacich, 1999—Media Synchronicity Theory: Re¤ned List of Media  Characteristics   Immediacy of Feedback: The extent to which a medium allows users to give rapid feed- back on the communications they receive.   Symbol Variety: The number of ways in which information can be communicated. This subsumes ‘Multiple Cues’ and ‘Language Variety’ developed by Daft and Lengel.   Parallelism: The number of simultaneous conversations that can exist effectively. Similar to ‘Concurrency’ developed by Valacich et al., and 'multiple addressability' developed elsewhere (Please see Dennis and Valacich, 1999 for constructs they looked at before arriving at this list of characteristics).   Rehearsability: The extent to which the sender can rehearse or ¤ne-tune the message before sending. This similar to ‘editability’ developed elsewhere.   Reprocessability: It is the extent to which a message can be reexamined or processed again within the context of the communication event. This is similar to ‘Externally Recorded Memory’ developed by Sproull (1991).  Burgoon et al. (2000) identified an extensive set of properties intrinsic to Face-to- Face (FtF) communication that might be retained, supplemented, ampli¤ed or  suppressed in HCI and CMC formats. They further argued that those properties  individually and/or collectively would account for observed differences in cognitions,  communications and outcomes observed across mediated and non-mediated,  human-human and human-computer interaction. These properties are:   Modality: The extent to which a media can support symbol variety to present rich infor- mation (similar to Symbol Variety).   Synchronicity: Whether the interaction occurs in real-time or with a time delay (similar to Immediacy of Feedback).   (Continued on next page) 15 </page> <page sequence="12"> e-Service Journal   Contingency: The extent to which a person’s queries and responses are dependent on the prior responses of the participating entity (some similarities to ‘Personal Focus’).   Participation: The extent to which senders and receivers are actively engaged in the inter- action.   Identi¤cation: The extent to which the participants are fully or partially identi¤ed or anonymous.   Mediation: Whether the communication format is mediated or not.   Propinquity: Whether the participants are in the same location or geographically dis- persed.   Anthropomorphism: The degree to which the interface simulates or incorporates humanlike characteristics. Dov Te’eni (2001): The Three dimensions of Media Richness   Interactivity: The potential for immediate feedback from the receiver. It is manifested by simultaneous, synchronous, and continuous exchange of information (some similarities to ‘Immediacy of Feedback’).   Adaptiveness: The potential to personalize a message to a particular receiver (similar to ‘Personal Focus’).   Channel Capacity: the potential to transmit a high variety of cues and languages (similar to ‘Multiple Cues’, ‘Language Variety’ and ‘Symbol Variety’) We argue that the communication characteristics of the web site are influenced by a combination of technology and web interface decisions made by the web site. Figure-1 shows PSP as a central construct that mediates the relationship between communication characteristics of a web site and the user’s evaluation of that web site. For example, based on the book that a customer is interested in, Amazon.com recommends similar books (simple ¤ltering/rule based) and books bought by users with similar tastes (collaborative ¤ltering). This type of personalization effort is hypothesized to increase adaptiveness afforded by the web site. This in turn will positively influence para-social presence and then, user’s evaluations of a web site. Figure 1. General Research Model 16 </page> <page sequence="13"> Para-Social Presence and Communication Capabilites of a Web Site Impact of Technologies and Interface Design Decisions on Communication Capabilities Web as the platform of communication affords a range of channels through which infor- mation can be conveyed. Web sites use a combination of multimedia and hypertext to integrate and provide interactive access to both static and dynamic content. The web is more versatile than most other communication platforms as it is an integrated medium with multiple capabilities—synchronous communication (chats, instant messaging, video conferencing), asynchronous communication (web based mail, message boards, web based group support tools with different levels of personalization), memory, storage and retrieval of information, control and security access. These multiple capabilities and versatility allows each web site to con¤gure the media as it sees ¤t.  There are varied and multiple number of ways to con¤gure and use the web. Any web site can offer a number of tools that support a variety of the functions described above at different levels. We argue that social entities can con¤gure the media according to their preferences; examples include voice mail settings (modi¤able by the organization as well as users), web site design decisions made by the organization, customization by the visitor to a site (e.g., myCNN.com, my.yahoo.com). It is also important to under- stand that content of the message exchange will affect the structure of relationship between participating entities and vice-versa. Dennis and Valacich (1999) argued that the communication capabilities of the same media could vary depending on the way it is con¤gured. Previous research has also shown that media characteristics are perceived (by the user) and the characteristics that are salient to a particular individual may not be salient to others. Thus, we argue that it is more appropriate to use the term ‘perceived communication characteristics’ rather than ‘media characteristics’. This research would be focusing on the impact of some of these perceived communication characteristics within the same medium and not across media. The versatility of web allows different con¤gurations to be used to support the avowed goals of a web site. Different levels of support for these technologies and the asso- ciated web interface design decisions, will affect speci¤c communication characteristics of the web as a medium. For example, a decision on what combination of text, images, audio and video to include, affects the modality (symbol variety) of the medium. A deci- sion to include instant messenger systems affects the synchronicity (immediacy of feed- back) of the medium. Decisions made on the type of personalization systems (a wide variety of solutions available based on cost and sophistication required—intelligent agents, collaborative ¤ltering, content ¤ltering, and constraint based recommendation systems) to be used in a web site influences the contingency (personal focus, adaptive- ness) of the medium; decision to include support for some form of consumer reviews enhances connectivity.  17 </page> <page sequence="14"> e-Service Journal Influence of Perceived Communication Characteristics on PSP  Most of the communication characteristics developed previously, with the exception of Burgoon et al., are in some way associated with media richness theory. As Dennis and Kinney (1998) pointed out, media richness theory has, in the past, been confused with media characteristics. While a few studies have attempted to measure media richness by asking about cues, feedback, language, and personal focus, this is a serious confound. Cues etc., are theorized to affect richness; they are not part of richness. Media richness is de¤ned as “the ability of information to change understanding with- in a time interval.” (Daft and Lengel, 1986, p. 560) Dennis and Kinney (1998), argue that examining fundamental aspects of the media such as immediacy of feedback instead of media richness would be one way to understand per- formance effects. We agree with Dennis and Kinney (1998) and use ‘media characteristics’ as a starting point in our research model. This research does not attempt to investigate nor apply media richness theory in the web-shopping context. Rather, this research seeks to portray web site as a valid social actor and attempts to characterize the relationship that emerges between a web site and her visitors by reconceptualizing social presence.  Dennis and Kinney (1998) explicitly demonstrated the relation between perceived communication characteristics and media richness. They argued against attempting to measure media richness by directly measuring communication characteristics such as cues, feedback, language variety and personal focus. They further use Daft and Lengel’s (Daft and Lengel, 1986; Daft et al., 1987) original media richness theory to argue that these communication characteristics affect media richness. Traditionally, media richness and social presence have been grouped together under “Trait Theories of Media Selec- tion” because of the similarity of their approaches (Carlson and Davis, 1998). Even though, work on these research streams have never been integrated empirically (effect of media characteristics on social presence), it is reasonable to argue that a medium that is perceived as being high on these communication characteristics can also be considered richer and more socially present media. Hence, we hypothesize that changes in perceived communication characteristics will also impact on social presence and hence on our reconceptualized social presence—PSP.  Connectivity Table-2 also demonstrates the inter-relatedness of these ‘communication characteristics’ across taxonomies. For example, Synchronicity is quite similar to “immediacy of feedback”. Modality is similar to “symbol variety” and “multiple cues”. Even the characteristics devel- oped within a theoretical framework seem to be interrelated. For example, manipulating 18 </page> <page sequence="15"> Para-Social Presence and Communication Capabilites of a Web Site “multiple cues” would have an effect on “immediacy of feedback” (Dennis and Kinney, 1998) as audio/video cues inherently tend to give some immediate feedback when compared to pure text. This research also introduces connectivity—the ability of a media to bring to- gether people who share common interests or goals—as one of the communication charac- teristics to the list of properties summarized in Table-2. Connectivity is the extent to which, and the ease with which, individuals who share common goals and interests ¤nd each other.  We argue that connectivity is one of the more important qualities that distinguish the Internet from other traditional media as this allows spontaneous relationships to be developed among spatially and temporally distributed participants. While face-to-face communication may have many advantages over computer mediated communication (some of which can be overcome as participants get to know each other over time), face- to-face communication has a decided disadvantage over other communication formats vis-à-vis connectivity. The ease with which web as a medium ampli¤es and supplements this often overlooked characteristic, could partially help offset some other limitations that web may face in facilitating relationships among entities.  While organizations recognize the importance of supporting team members work- ing in different locations using different media and are willing to invest time and resources to acquire associated group support systems, individuals who share a common af¤nity for the music of ‘Miles Davis’ may not be willing to do the same if this would cost them too much money and time. But, the advent of Internet has made it very easy for individuals who share common interests to come together on-line. Usenet newsgroups were the earliest examples of such groups and world-wide-web now makes it even easier to form sophisticated virtual communities.  Web sites can act as conduits through which such relationships can be forged. Sometimes, these interactions are transactional in nature (a user browsing through a rec- ommendation by another user who bought the same product). Other times, the relation- ship blossoms over a period of time (virtual communities at Yahoo.com, MSN.com). In short, Internet in general and world-wide-web in particular, has made this quantum leap from ‘virtual teams’ to ‘virtual communities’ possible. This research argues that if a social actor (including a web site) helps another social actor (visitor to a web site) to connect with others who share similar interest or goals (virtual community), then this would fos- ter a positive relationship between those actors (web site and the visitor to that site). Impact of PSP on Web Site Evaluation This research uses trust, perceived usefulness and loyalty (as measured by purchase inten- tion) as central evaluation criteria. Burgoon et al., (2000) used similar measures (credibil- ity that contained elements of trust measured in this research, utility that is similar to satisfaction) in an inter-personal context. Gefen and Straub (2000) show that social pres- 19 </page> <page sequence="16"> e-Service Journal ence is an antecedent of Perceived Usefulness and that SP also affects the level of trust. Karahanna and Straub (1999) also show that social presence is an antecedent of perceived usefulness. These studies (Burgoon et al., 2000; Gefen and Straub, 2000; Karahanna and Straub, 1999) collectively lend support to the back-end of the research model—link between PSP afforded by a web site and user’s evaluation of that web site. CONCLUSIONS To summarize, this research makes a case for treating a web site as a social actor. We use the “Theory of Social Response” (Moon, 2000; Reeves et al., 1997) to justify this charac- terization. The construct Para-Social Presence is then developed to capture the relational component between a web site and her customers. We believe that web sites can be designed in such a way so as to develop a meaningful relationship with her users. For example, personalization systems and virtual communities are some of the features that may help a web site in this endeavor. This research borrows extensively from communi- cation literature to argue that Para-social presence is a multi-dimensional construct com- prising of closeness, sense of understanding, involvement and positive affect. An instrument has been developed to measure and validate PSP. Using a targeted sample size of 150, a survey is currently being conducted to assess the measurement properties of the instrument. It is hypothesized that these sub-dimensions of PSP will coalesce into a single second order factor- Para-social presence.  We further develop a research framework (see appendix-2) that investigates the impact of new technologies, and associated web interface design decisions, on perceived communication characteristics of a media, PSP and subsequent user evaluations of the web site (perceived usefulness, trust and loyalty). This research argues that one medium could possess different levels of PSP depending on how it is con¤gured and used. In the next stage, we plan to empirically test the notion that support for high levels of personal- ization and transactional communities leads customers to perceive the web site as being a richer communication partner. Speci¤cally, a lab experiment will be conducted to study the impact of a web site's support for personalization and virtual communities. Ama- zon.com is one of B2C retailers well known for her industry leading efforts in personaliza- tion. By ¤ltering Amazon.com real-time, web interfaces corresponding to different levels of support for personalization and virtual communities have already been constructed.  We plan to offer three levels of support for personalization—No support, Medium Support (personalization based on simple ¤ltering/rule based techniques) and High Sup- port (personalization based on simple ¤ltering/rule based techniques and collaborative ¤ltering). This research study will provide for two levels of consumer review support: no reviews, reviews with information about the rater included. To the best of our knowl- edge, this will be one of the ¤rst studies to investigate the impact of personalization and virtual communities using rich data from an on-line store (Amazon.com, in this case) in 20 </page> <page sequence="17"> Para-Social Presence and Communication Capabilites of a Web Site controlled conditions. This research by focusing on web site design decisions that facili- tate PSP and the experiential aspect of web interfaces will focus on the practical relevance of these web site design decisions on users’ trust and loyalty towards the web site.
