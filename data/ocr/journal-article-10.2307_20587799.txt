A Suit of Nettles, by James Reaney. St. Martin's Press. $3.00. The Night ofthe Hammer, by Ned O'Gorman. Harcourt, Brace. $3.75. Poets start from common generalizations, but make their poems out of, and into, irreducible particulars. These four books share a time, a language, and a culture rooted in scholarship and Christianity. They show off the poet's power to turn shared assumptions into poems infinitely individual. John Heath-Stubbs has the habit of excellence. In these three lyric plays-as in poetry and criticism-his range is very wide; his words are right yet not finicky; he deals deftly with reality, both sensual and his torical. The jagged dislocations that stardte us awake to some poetry are absent. The world of these plays holds a grace-addled Arab, an eloquent ass, Helen, Judas, Eve, all in Christocoherent poise. The Harrowing of Hell is a mystery play, not quaint, strongly operative within its para liturgical shape. It was written, and effectively, for church use. As dramatic dialogue, its poetry is viable anywhere. Its author perfectly describes The Talking Ass: "a lyrical, comical, liturgical farce; a topical joke with a pantomime donkey". Balaam, a man in the magic business, is so visited by grace he turns down wealth, power, and his wife's ap proval by prophesying the crucified Messiah instead of cursing Israel. Note that the farce is elegant, and the jokes ironic. Helen in Egypt is a full-scale romantic comedy, an entirely possible Fair Lady for the com mercial stage. After Troy's fall, Helen's ship strays to an Egyptian island she had visited when headed for Troy with Paris. Heath-Stubbs' Helen never left that island, but grew middle-aged entombed and asleep while the Egyptians sent an ageless phantom to Troy. Suspense over Helen's identity dissolves into deeper suspense attendant on Menelaus's decision. He has forgiven an exquisite young phantom's treachery; he has yet to see and forgive the truth of his wife, whose body betrayal, war, and time have aged. The verse in these plays isn't just laid on; it's Heath Stubbs' natural language. His capacity to forego self-expression in favor of self-examination gives his characters independence and psychological 304</page><page sequence="2">MARIEB PONSOT rightness. It is from his contemplation of their quality as persons that the poetry springs. Helen in Egypt has an author's preface remarkable of its kind; an accurate, pertinent statement of aims and influences. He says "the meaning of history and the nature of truth" are two of his themes, and rightly, for the plays are multi-level analogues. They are made theatrical by well-paced dialogue, right-now liveliness of character and action, and strong plot in which a clear moment of decision acts as pivot. They owe their combined intensity and coherence to Heath Stubbs' really original mind and balanced sensitiveness. Certain Poems show John Hardy as a poet of difficult, even anguished questions which he will not compromise or quit. His technique and imagery are in Spartan service, so closely are the poems molded to his mind's heart-wrenching endeavor. That he is not deaf or technically inept at tunefidness is shown by a few pieces like the graceful, most cavalier, Have I Declared My Love? with a delectable octet that ends, "As though to be man or beast were but to dance, / And dying to defy such chance, to dance most well." His vocabulary isn't quixotic, nor his grammar illegible. Yet the poems' surface is hard going in the way that the work of the metaphysical poets is said to be. To many readers (me too) this is irresistible, an excellent device to make readers active acces sories, so long as they get paid off in poetic satisfaction. For Hardy it's surely more than a device; it is inevitable. For he writes of what it is hard to make conscious, hard to feel and think through, and very hard to reproduce honestly. This intellectual honesty outlaws phrases that are stale, inaccurate, or simply seductive. Voyeur (about a window-watcher aware of another window-watcher who has the same girls in view) explores many kinds of love; it is an undecorated beautiful poem. In eight poems, Christ is the "panther we pursue." Hardy makes these poems move out of what he sees from where he is, to how it affects him, to insight, suddenly seized. It's especially effective in dealing poetically with the Christian mystery, since it engages the reader on undisputed and dramatic ground. Take The Chase as example; it both practices and describes his poetry. It has for subject man's hope of tracking down the true word right into that order of reality with which both art and reli gion have always been occupied. He says he wants a language "to hold / converse and not conform, to be informed / and not reflect"; then he tells, fast and in depth, of how he once heard a hunter's tale of a great 305</page><page sequence="3">POETRY marauding cat. Then, the last stanza gets him where he wanted to go, "into the shimmering fields again", mapping out his way to where cre ative knowledge in art and certitude in cognition may occur. These "shimmering fields" aren't muzzy-mystic envisionings but the whole trackless area of human introspection, where strictly speaking anything can happen. The strength of Certain Poems is in how it conveys what is most universal and perfectly unique, one man's attack upon apprehension and comprehension of himself and his acts. James Reaney's A Suit of Nettles is a rare plant to find greenly flourish ing on any foundation these days. Genus: satire; species: allegoric verse essay; attributes: diversity of wit, an ear for intrigue, technical bravura; habitat: Canada, Earth. It is rare because its satire isn't urbane, wry, sly, dry, or implied; and its irony is limited to Reaney's attitude toward poetry and poets. He borrows the superstructure of Spenser's Shepherd's Calendar, using an eclogue a month to tell a lovetale with interludes. He romps through a dozen verse styles focused on inanity in permissive edu cation, arty criticism, propagation of faith in anti-propagation, self dramatization, and the war between the sexes. He mocks fools rather than villains; he ridicules the results of excess. His pitch shifts agreeably; he is brash, merry, deadly, mythic, verbal, hilarious, by turns. (May, with its birth-control ladies loose in philoprogenitive Quebec, is a very fimny idea.) He likes the "unpolish'd rugged verse" Donne recommends for satire (the better to beat with). The athletics of his line is so deliber ately exercised as to be acrobatic; he puts it into alliterative verse, quatrains and couplets elegiac, popish, and skeltonian, monologues and dialogues. It's onlyjust-poeticjustice--that his practice of existing forms should free him from what is dead in them. The lively ease of the April poets' contest in praise of spring is typical-one entry is the sturdy, "I speak, I speak ofthe arable earth, / Black sow goddess huge with birth; / Cry cry killdeers in her fields . . ."; and the other an exquisitely realized lyric that the Joyce of Chamber Music would have loved, "Your body is a bethlehem." At the September country fair, Reaney exhibits nature, human and agricultural, in guises the romnantics never knew. Goose and gander soar and fall through a dantesque view of Canada, go on a merry-go-round of philosophy from eleatics to existentialists, ascend a ferris wheel of anthropomorphic attempts at God, back into a sideshow, come out to hear a drunk preacher's sermon on the Last Supper. This 306</page><page sequence="4">MARIE PONSOT calendar of our years is no program for society's sudden improvement. Keenly observed and boldly noted, it also incidentally favors the non group virtues of good heart and good sense. These are personified in a goose-heroine who, unlike many poets' imaginary ladies, is no Maia- or Kali-female. Reaney's aggressive sanity has made her instead a sisterly good creature whose active love ofthings, in time, as they are, empowers her to imagine and believe in perfection while coping to the point of immolation with the real world. 'Thinking on a work / changes it somehow," Ned O'Gorman's Michelangelo thrice muses, as he smashes a statue he has spoilt by "thinking on" it in The Night of the Hammer's tide poem. "My song in darkness will be found," say the book's last lines. These lyrics do not depend on ideas or conscious poetic structuring but on associative image ry. Many of them charm us into sharing the poet's excitement. Similes tumble up in free play, additive not exhaustive. Subliminal associations make all literature, even Pope, fresh and hauntingly personal. Marvellous recent poems are made of them alone (e.g., Cummings, Thomas), wben a poet's concentric intensity has attracted revelatory, relevant associa tions. So when O'Gorman has intense concern for a theme, his quick tongued enthusiasm shapes a lively poem. That attractive enthusiasm fails to satisfy when he neither edits out irrelevancies nor bends them back toward the poem. In two-thirds ofthese forty-four lyrics featuring simple appositives and undeveloped similes, the word "like" occurs, at least once. He describes by accretion. De Anima II is typical: "The sound of the soul / is not the sound of a bell. / It is a still clock, / a horn not touched, / a giraffe, an idea of mallets, / being all things that would be written down by an unbeliever. / I think it is more likely to be / a hoot owl / a hoot owl and a nightingale together, a line of drummers, / a tug o-war, an idea of arrows / being all things that would be written down / by a believer / but / I tend to think that perhaps the things of men / believers or not, contain contradictions." Neither the list of soul-like noises nor the last banal couplet tells me what this "soul" is, that takes "sound" as an attribute. This vagueness may be because neither subject nor symbols are thoroughly felt, conceived, or lived; the poet has not only "an idea" of arrows and mallets, but a notion of nightingales, giraifes, persons. Other poems offer many such images, from puzzles like "growling gulls" and "awash with sinew" to rare clear pleasures like 307</page><page sequence="5">POETRY "iliads of light". These aren't think-pieces or purely composed technical inventions. The words-which are means and matter-must carry the weight. When they don't work either as big magic or as parlor tricks, the poem crumbles. It's in the several poems about members of his im mediate family and in the few verbal incantations, that O'Gorman en tirely succeeds. Here his omnipresent noun-modifier images are fresh, decent, and exciting. (I note an unusual, almost French, lack of that par ticular strength of English, transitive verbs.) Assonance and alliteration, ad lib. rather than as over-all structure, make up his music. Family poems apart, his relation to his subject is casual, and operates to diminish. High matters are at home here; there are quaint or cozy bright sayings on Jehovah, the Virgin Mary, Gabriel the Archangel, Cain, Abel, Homer, Yeats, the crucifixion, the creation, the sea. O'Gorman offers some sur prises, mostly verbal, but no sense of awe in dealing with great things; mysterium tremendum is domesticated. This is charming. I also find it arch. When arch, O'Gorman's relation to his subject is that of a light versifier; his form, however, hasn't the versatility and enormous, if limited, skills light verse demands. Yet, he is capable of newness, bril liance, and conveyed emotion. He also attracts many readers who do not ordinarily care for poetry. It would be wonderful to imagine him using his capability all the time. Each of these four books has a passage celebrating the Christian mys tery of the Passion. Balaam withdraws from his vision of it, crying, "I cannot su?fer that look of infinite pardon ... I cannot bear this destruc tion of my pride." Reaney's drunk preacher shouts, "So you've all cer tainly betrayed him so you've done / Something for him by my bottle faith fiddlededee you have." Hardy's Good Friday poem has great im plosive force; it begins quietly, "Indeed it must have offended the very wrist of the carpenter's boy, when every way for sunday / he stretched his frame to fit that sorry botched / and knocked together thing." O'Gorman's fourth Adjective Toward the Description of a Crucifix inverts the field-glasses; the viewed object is not brought closer but diminished; the crucifixion is seen as like O'Gorman's poems: "because these songs are crosscrossed / with rhyme which catches up the tags of sense. / Crucfixion was all that...."
