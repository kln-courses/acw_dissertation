<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROSALIND A. WADE HADDON TWO CERAMIC PIECES FROM THE ASIAN ART MUSEUM OF SAN FRANCISCO Several recent publications have defined the histories of the well-known Islamic collections in Europe, Russia, and the United States.' The foundations of these col- lections lie firmly in the nineteenth century, but col- lectors have continued their activities, with many new names added to their ranks, throughout the twentieth century. One collector who has not been acknowledged, probably because he is usually associated with East and South Asian art, is Avery Brundage (1887-1975). The collection that he and his wife, Elizabeth, donated in 1960 to the city of San Francisco forms the backbone of the Asian Art Museum holdings. Avery Brundage was perhaps best known for his role in the Olympic Games movement and as pres- ident of the International Olympic Committee from 1952 through 1972. His extensive travels in pursuit of his Olympic ideals gave him a unique opportunity to visit many Asian countries. The Brundage collection numbers some eight thousand pieces, five hundred of which are West Asian works of art, including prehis- toric Iranian ceramics, Luristan bronzes, and an excel- lent representative corpus of Islamic wares (some 320 artifacts). However, in true museum tradition, there are many more pieces in the reserves than on display. Sadly, there is no supportive correspondence or per- sonal record indicating why Brundage purchased these objects, or if he had any idea of their provenance, if indeed he cared. But it is evident that he had a good eye for the unusual and the interesting. Two ceramic pieces are of particular interest: a polychrome, early Abbasid luster bowl, accession number B60 P478 (fig. 1), and an underglaze-painted blue, black, and white dish, B60 P1962 (fig. 2)-the luster bowl because it is unique, and the underglaze-painted dish because it is an excellent example of its type, and its provenance, whether Syrian Mamluk or Iranian, is open to ques- tion. Most Islamic collections have samples of these wares, but little progress has been made in researching those of Iranian origin since Gerald Reitlinger's semi- nal article was published in 1938.2 The Mamluk wares have received more attention, but no definitive conclu- sions have been drawn to differentiate one ware from the other.3 THE POLYCHROME LUSTER BOWL I precede my discussion of each of these vessels with a brief description of its decoration and state of pres- ervation. Despite the many breaks and mends in the polychrome luster bowl, B60 P478 (figs. 3, 4, and 5 for exterior and profiles), my detailed examination of the bowl under ultraviolet lamp, with the assistance of associ- ate conservator Mark Fenn,4 revealed conclusively that most of the vessel is original. There are a few rogue rim fragments and some plaster infills, the luster has been badly abraded, and at some stage-presumably before it was sold to Brundage-a restorer carried out a somewhat unsympathetic overpainting job, but the design is definitely as originally conceived. This round bowl, with its curved, flaring sides, everted rim, and low, well-shaped foot has the diagnostic, well- levigated, creamy yellow Basran body.' It measures 27.8 cm in diameter and 7.6 cm in height and is covered both inside and out with a tin-opacified lead glaze to pro- duce an opaque white surface for the overglaze-painted bichrome (chocolate brown and golden olive) luster decoration. The exterior surface is noticeably grayer and is flecked with gray specks, probably from intrusive manganese. Even the inside of the foot ring is glazed. The interior design was outlined in a thin double line of golden olive, and a thicker white highlighting line was used to accentuate the motifs. The design includes a central eight-pointed star formed by two interlock- ing squares. The points of the stars are filled in with alternating chocolate brown and golden olive. The cen- ter is a roughly drawn octagon delineated by two fine, golden olive parallel lines; its grayish white ground is undecorated except for traces of a thin, somewhat cur- vilinear Kufic inscription (possibly two lines), which is impossible to read, even under the UV lamp.

The space between them is filled by cruci- form motifs, with a central, seven-petal rosette reserved in each. The cruciform shapes are somewhat irregu- lar, as their contours are dictated by the curves of the bowl's cavetto. Their tops are capped with three-petal motifs that link them to the outer stars, and a pair of "winged" motifs sprouts from each. These cruciform shapes are painted in chocolate brown luster over sche- matic, alternating designs of arrows or wavy lines in golden olive luster. The three-petal motif is formed with a fine line and cross-hatching in golden olive, and a cen- tral chocolate brown lens shape. The half-palmettes are defined with thick lines of chocolate brown, which are heavily overpainted. The rim appears to be bordered with a continuous, thick line of chocolate brown. The exterior is decorated with three large circles and tri- angles in chocolate brown on a whitish ground, with golden olive dashes in between.6 The inside foot ring has two concentric circles-one chocolate, one golden olive. These merge in places, encircling more dashes, which are badly abraded and have been heavily over- painted. It is widely accepted that the type of polychrome wares to which this luster bowl belongs were produced in the ninth century. Extensive research and visits to the storage areas of numerous museums7 have neverthe- less demonstrated that the overall design on this bowl is unique and the first known example of a star-and- cross motif on a ceramic vessel.8 Its individual design elements, however, are common, and many similarly shaped bowls and fragments can be cited.9 In ceramic tile revetments the star-and-cross design is not known to have occurred before the twelfth century in Ana- tolia and the thirteenth century in Iran.10 However, a stucco dado with a star-and-cross design was excavated in House III by the German team at Samarra;" according to Alastair Northedge this house was abandoned around 895 CE.12 The tops of the crosses in the stucco dado of this house also end in petals and palmettes. To date, the ceramic vessel nearest to the luster bowl under consid- eration is an Egyptian Fayyumi jar in the collection of the Islamic Museum, Cairo,'3 which research dates to around 1000 CE or earlier.14 For the other motifs we should look to illuminated manuscripts. Indeed, rosette motifs can be found as verse spacers in ninth- or tenth- century Kufic Qur'ans, although these rosettes seem uniformly to have six petals.15 The numerous frontis- pieces and finispieces of such Qur'ans would have pro- vided endless inspiration for decorative motifs. Geomet- ric interlace designs are common to both illumination and leather bookbindings,16 as well as to woodcarving and stuccowork. A five-petal rosette can be seen on a teak panel from Tikrit, Iraq, dated to the second half of the eighth century.17 THE UNDERGLAZE-PAINTED BLUE, BLACK, AND WHITE DISH The physical state of the dish, B60 P1962 (figs. 6, 7, and 8 for exterior and profiles), is much better than that of the bowl just considered; it has only one sig- nificant mend, with a little overpainting, which is easily discernible (fig. 6). Although the dish languished previ- ously in storage, it is now on permanent display in the new Asian Art Museum housed in the old City Library, opposite City Hall. It measures 28.4 cm in diameter, and 6.6 cm in height. Its thick alkaline glaze is clear and glassy, indicating that the bowl was probably never underground; pitted and crackled, especially on the exterior, the glaze does not cover the foot. The pierc- ing of the low foot ring, reminiscent of that found in so-called Kubachi wares,18 suggests that for many years the dish was suspended on someone's wall by a wire or string. It has a composite, or stonepaste, rather gritty white buff body, a white slip, and a geometric design depicted in underglaze cobalt blue and black on a creamy white ground. According to Dr. Le He,19 curator of Chinese ceramics at the Asian Art Museum, its shallow profile and elegant, narrow foot replicate a very common Ding shape, at least in spirit.20 Unlike the luster bowl, this dish belongs to an extensive family of similarly decorated vessels,21 but among this family its shape is seemingly unique. The decoration consists of a central six-pointed star, or seal of Solomon,22 drawn in a thick cobalt blue line. One fine black line lies just within the central hexagon of the star, and a second one encircles seven blue dots that create a schematic six-petal flower at the very cen- ter of the dish. On a stippled white ground, pseudo- calligraphy in thick black lines, perhaps approximating the repeated word Allah, encircles this central motif. Each point of the star contains three blue dots and two fine black lines. Connecting adjacent points are blue trefoils, their interstices filled with more black pseudo- calligraphy on stippled grounds that are finely outlined</page><page sequence="4">156 ROSALIND A.

The resultant lobed hexagram is framed with a wide white band, filled with a double row of blue dots and fine black "commas," between continuous, thick blue lines the cobalt of which has smudged and run during the firing process. The whole central design is encircled by a white band delineated by fine black lines, beyond which is a band of crosshatched black on white, overpainted with cobalt that has also bled. The six lens- shaped spaces between the central design and the encir- cling white band are filled with more pseudo-calligraphy and feature single blue dots, two of which are framed with fine black lines. The rim is a simple blue band. The exterior has fifteen black schematic spirals23 con- tained by double bands of black; there are dots painted in the interstices above most of these spirals. DISCUSSION OF PROVENANCE The luster bowl is undoubtedly an early Abbasid ware, most probably produced in Basra,24 but its find-spot is unknown. In 1999 I visited Houshang Mahboubian at his gallery in Grosvenor Street, London, to see if he recalled handling these two vessels. The museum records indicated that Brundage had acquired most of his West Asian artifacts through H. Khan Monif25 and the Mahboubians.26 Mr. Mahboubian confirmed that he believed his firm had sold them both to Brund- age, and mentioned that Brundage definitely visited their gallery in Tehran on a number of occasions. He thought that the luster bowl came from Jurjan and the dish from Khurasan, somewhere near Nishapur. He then illustrated the confusion concerning these underglaze-painted wares, producing a photograph of a similarly decorated bowl with an everted rim,</page><page sequence="5">TWO CERAMIC PIECES FROM THE ASIAN ART MUSEUM OF SAN FRANCISCO 157 which he knew had come from Iran, most probably Nishapur or Jurjan, and which he had sold as such in the early 1980s. Since then it had been sold twice at auction, as Mamluk!27 When I discussed the same problem with Prof. Maan Madina,28 he said that he had serious doubts about the Mamluk designation given to his bowl in the exhibition and catalogue, Renaissance of Islam.29 His collection is now in the Los Angeles County Museum, and I had a chance to examine the bowl in July 2003 and consider it to be a similar ware to the Asian Art Museum dish. During a visit to Iran in 2002 I noted that, of all the similarly decorated wares observed in museum collec- tions, the only one with a confirmed provenance, how- ever vague, was a dish in the Islamic Museum, Tehran, no. 4457.3o All the others had been either confiscated from smugglers or purchased on the open market. As the director, Zohreh Roohfar, stated, all her pieces are "good"-in other words, every one has a sound, legit- imate provenance. On a further visit to Iran in 2003 I found a base shard with one of the star points, which had come from Isfarayin, in the Juvayn district in west- ern Khurasan. In the Mashhad pottery storage, which houses all the finds from Khurasan surveys and excava- tions, I located another fragment, found during exca- vations for a modern cesspit in Enqelab, also in the Juvayn area. Thus, although we are no nearer to iden- tifying a precise place of manufacture, it is reasonable to state that these wares were made in Iran, probably somewhere in Khurasan. There was doubtless a consid- erable output of similar underglaze-painted wares in Syria and Egypt at the same period-indeed the Dan- ish excavations at Hama3' and more recent finds in Aleppo and Palmyra32 have produced abundant com- parative material-but their shapes, decorative motifs, and execution differ from those of the dish considered here. Regional differences are not so distinguishable among the so-called Sultanabad wares produced dur- ing the Ilkhanid period-especially the radial bowls- but that is a separate subject. OVERALL DESIGN Each of these two pieces obviously has a geometric design, but between them there is an age difference of at least five hundred years. In this intervening period the potters of Iran, Syria, and Egypt, in their quest to mimic Chinese porcelain, discovered how to manufac- ture a composite, or stonepaste, body from a more por- celain-like paste. These potters also invariably decorated their vessels with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms, evidently disregarding Islamic proscriptions against such forms or inferring that, since such wares were exclusively for secular use by a wealthy merchant class, such proscriptions did not apply. In each vessel considered here we find a horror vacui and the use of the white ground to highlight the designs. Perhaps this is what attracted Brundage to them both. The seal of Solomon (as either a pentagram or a hexa- gram) is a common Islamic design, and it was used in talismanic bowls to protect the owner from evil spirits, malevolent forces,33 and poisons.34 In his article on medicinal bowls, Spoer explains how this hexagram was also the symbol of the sun, with its twelve rays possibly representing the twelve signs of the zodiac, which in turn may symbolize the twelve Arabic letters that begin the Shahada: lI ildha ill 'llah.35 It is tempting to read the letters in the center of the hexagram as a repeat of this formula. It was common practice for Muslim pot- ters to include blessings and good wishes to the owner, and perhaps what we have here is a development of this function, with the hexagram being a shorthand form of all these sentiments, easily comprehensible to the educated and the illiterate alike. It should be remem- bered that life in the fourteenth and fifteenth centu- ries was extremely turbulent, with periods of upheaval, plague, and constant shifts of power that would have encouraged the populace to seek every possible means to protect themselves and their families. However, we have no documentary proof to support such a hypoth- esis. Perhaps the most sensible conclusion is that the decoration on both vessels was an exercise in geomet- ric form, with the potter challenged by having to adapt to a curved surface. CONCLUSION It is a disappointment that we have no real idea of what drove Avery Brundage in his collecting quest for West Asian artifacts, but we must admire his serendipitous fortune in acquiring these two vessels and other pieces. From the limited correspondence it is hard to gauge who had the upper hand-the collector or his dealers. Trunkloads of antiques were shipped across America, terse letters ensued, and objects were returned. There was no sign of profuse thanks for a rarity procured. There were dealers' letters encouraging Brundage to visit their respective New York galleries after his con- siderable absences but no record of what he found there when he did. There is a noticeable shortage of</page><page sequence="6">158 ROSALIND A.
