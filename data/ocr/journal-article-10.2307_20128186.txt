<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON MAN'S KNOWLEDGE OF GOD: A TWENTIETH CENTURY PERSPECTIVE ISAAC FRANCK JIN the opening chapter of his book, Eclipse of God, Martin Buber recalls the hesitant but passionate reaction of a friend, an elderly scholar, against the author's repeated use of the word "God" in one of his writings: "How can you bring yourself to say 'God' time after time?" the old scholar asked. "How can you expect that your readers will take the word in the sense in which you wish it to be taken? What you mean by the name of God is something above all human grasp and comprehension, but in speaking about it you have lowered it to human conceptualization. What word of human speech is so misused, so defiled, so desecrated as this!"1 A long backward leap in time is undertaken in this essay, from the idea of God as adumbrated in the words of Buber's aging friend to the "negative theology" of Moses Maimonides and Thomas Aquinas. On the question, "Can man have knowledge of God?" neither the simple statement by Buber's friend that "God is something above all human grasp and comprehension," nor the more complex views propounded by Maimonides and Aquinas, seem to have wide acceptance among philosophers and theologians today. Indeed, in the past two or three decades several sharp attacks have appeared against negative theology and its doctrine of the unknowability of God. It would thus seem appropriate at this time to set forth some of the elements of a radical negative theology, the principal tenet of which is that while we do know that God is, on the other hand, what God is, i.e., God's nature or essence, in the words of Thomas Aquinas, "remains absolutely unknown" (penitus manet ignotum).2 1 Martin Buber, Eclipse of God (New York: Harper, 1952), pp. 16-17. 2 Thomas Aquinas, On the Truth of the Catholic Faith?Summa contra gentiles, trans.

Before presenting an extended consideration of the views of Maimonides and Aquinas on man's knowledge of God, it will be of value to note that much of the contemporary criticism of negative theology and of the doctrine of the unknowability of God has concentrated, as we shall see below, on exposing alleged logical flaws in its reasoning. These criticisms require and deserve attention, and such comments as need to be made on some of them by way of rejoinder will be reserved for the second half of this paper. However, part of the analysis by one of these critics will be helpful at this point in the pursuit of the question of God's knowability. In his acute and instructive essay entitled, "What We Can Say About God," Fred Sommers provides the reader with a distillation of essentially five views, or doctrines, classified accord ing to their claims as to what attributes we may predicate of the divine being:3 1. That which Sommers calls "the naive, anthropomorphic view" according to which everything predicable of a human being is also predicable of the divine being 2. The "standard or sophisticated conception," rooted in Cartesian ontology and in the theology seemingly entailed by Descartes' ontology, namely, that no material predicates may be predi cated of God 3. The view which rejects Descartes' dualistic ontology, but also rejects the naive anthropomorphic theology (referred to in doctrine 1 above), and therefore must, according to Sommers, end up with an animistic or panpsychistic metaphysics like Doran, 1955), book 3, chapter 49, par. 9, p. 170.

The view, which has been called "negative theology," but which falls short of being thoroughgoingly negative, namely, the view that nothing predicable of man is predicable of God 5. The doctrine that no affirmative or positive attributes of any kind are predicable of God, that God is completely unknown and unknowable, that we can meaningfully say about God only what he is not (to speak of Him in negative attributes); the doctrine that man's highest knowledge of God is to know that we are unable to know Him We need be concerned here only with doctrines 4 and 5, since the views of both Maimonides and Aquinas are clearly at this end of Sommers's spectrum of possible positions. The differences between these two philosophers (albeit minimal on the main issue), and the apparent ambivalence discernible both in Aquinas and in Maimonides, make it perhaps a little risky to ascribe to them categorically doctrine 5 rather than 4, for fear of projecting on them the extreme view espoused in this paper. But at this point we had best let the two philosophers and some of their texts speak for themselves. II Maimonides' incisive and striking treatment of the problem of divine attributes, and of man's knowledge of God, is developed principally in Chapters 51 through 60 of Book 1 of the Guide of the Perplexed.4 His conclusion is that no positive attributes may 4 Moses Mairionides, The Guide of the Perplexed.

One or more translations into Latin were made from the Hebrew and were in circulation among Christian philosophers and theologians well before the middle of the 13th century.)</page><page sequence="4">594 ISAAC FRANCK be predicated of God. The only affirmative attributes that may be employed in speaking about God are those that in fact refer to God's actions and their effects but "do not mean that He possesses qualities" or that such attributes are "notions subsisting within the essence of the agent"?meaning God?or are superadded to God's essence. (This modification of his negative theology is surely a Maimonidean equivocation. It is noted by Aquinas in his De potentia Dei and is properly criticized by him.) Moreover, the ascription of positive attributes to God either constitutes in fact a definition by genus and differentia which would function merely as a stipulative, nominal definition of a term, and would thus tell us nothing about God. On the other hand, it may be a real or essential definition. But this would entail the assumption of a higher genus than God, under which God could be subsumed, and would thus imply an assumed cause for the definiendum. But God, who has no causes anterior to Him, and for Whom there is no higher genus, cannot be thus defined. Another kind of predication of attributes would constitute a partial definition because it would offer only a partial definiens? for example, in the case of man, the assertion that man is a living thing. This kind of predication would suggest that if we could properly ascribe to God part of an essence, then His essence would have to be composite. This we must reject as we reject any notion of plurality within God. The rejection of plurality also requires the rejection of a multiplicity of all kinds of qualities, and thus also a rejection of quantity, as belonging to the nature or essence of God. Finally, any affirmative attributes that might be proposed as predicable of God are human conceptions, and it is an error to assume that there is a relation or a correlation between God and these human conceptions or the referents for which they stand. There cannot be any such correlation between God's existence and the existence of things and their qualities, since God has a necessary existence while that which is other than He has a possible or contingent existence. . . . There accordingly can be no correlation between them. . . . For it is impossible to represent to oneself that a relation subsists between the intellect and color . . . although both of them are comprised by the same "existence." How then can a relation be represented between Him and what is other than He when there is no notion comprising in any respect both of the two, inasmuch as existence is . . . affirmed of Him . . . and of what is other than He merely by way of absolute equivocation . . .</page><page sequence="5">MAN'S KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 595 How could there subsist a relation between Him . . . and any of the things created by Him, given the immense difference between them with regard to the true reality of their existence, than which there is no greater difference?5 This exclusive and absolute distinction between God and what is not God logically rules out for Maimonides even any analogical predication. Aquinas, however, does allow it, though apparently with some reservations. The logic of Maimonides' rejection of analogical predication is clearly based on one or both of two considerations that are corollaries of his negative theology: (1) For an attribute X (e.g., "good") to be predicated analogi cally of two entities, e.g., God and man, it would be necessary first to know that the attribute under discussion as it applies to one of the entities in the analogy is the same as, similar to, or overlaps with the attribute as it applies to the other entity in the analogy. There can be no analogy unless at least such similarity or over lapping exists. However, since we cannot possibly know what the attribute X would mean in its application to God, we have nothing on which to base an analogical ascription of attribute X to both God and man. (2) The doctrine of the absolute and irreducible difference between God and what is not God means that any attribute X when predicated of God, if such predication were possible, would be completely and utterly different from the predicate carrying the same name when it is predicated of man, and therefore, no analogy would be possible. Predicating positive attributes of God would thus result in unavoidable equivocation, not because, as Aristotle maintained, things of different types can never have the same attributes. Indeed, as Sommers has shown, when comparisons are admissible between two things of different types with respect to a given attribute, that attribute can be predicated univocally of both things, as, for example, when it makes sense to say that the duration in time of the solar eclipse was less, or more, or about the same as the duration in time of my working out this algebraic equation.6 Rather, the unavoidability of equivocation when positive 5 Ibid., Chapter 52, pp. 117-18. 6 Fred Sommers, "What We Can Say About God," pp. 63-65.</page><page sequence="6">596 ISAAC FRANCK attributes are predicated of God results precisely because the radical otherness of God makes all comparisons between God and other things utterly impossible, and any term used both about God and about other things therefore cannot be used univocally. There indeed is no middle ground here between univocity and equivocity. What then can we know or say about the nature or essence of God? We can only speak in terms of negative predications. We do not know what God is, but we can and must only say what God is not. This is the doctrine of "negative attributes," or of the knowledge of God through the via negativa. When we say that God exists, the only meaning this can have is that non-existence is impossible for Him. When we say that God is living, the only possible meaning of the statement is that He is not dead or not mortal. When we say that He is eternal, what it means is that no cause has brought Him into existence. When we say "that He is powerful and knowing and willing" this is only to signify "that He is neither powerless, nor inattentive, nor negligent."7 Or, to restate it once more in one of Rabbi Moses' own succinct formu lations: Consequently, He exists, but not through an existence other than His essence; and similarly He lives, but not through life; He is powerful, but not through power; He knows, but not through knowledge.8 By way of anticipation of the next section, on Aquinas' negative theology, it is worth noting here that, whereas in other texts Aquinas states this Maimonidean doctrine as his own, in De potentia Dei (q. 7, a. 2) he quotes in the name of Maimonides, giving an almost exact translation of the above: Rabbi Moses says that God is a being but not in an essence, is living but not with life, is powerful but not with power, wise but not with wisdom. It is not the case, Maimonides insists, that God's existence, or knowledge, or life, or power, are more permanent, more durable, 7 Moses Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed, I, 58, p. 136. 8 Ibid., I, 57, p. 132.</page><page sequence="7">MAN'S KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 597 greater, or more perfect than ours. "The matter is not so in any respect," Maimonides emphasizes.9 God is utterly different. When we say that God is one, what is meant is not numerical oneness. "The meaning is that He has no equal and not that the notion of oneness attaches to His essence."10 God is unique; He is sui generis; He is, to borrow a phrase from Rudolf Otto, "wholly other."11 It is this doctrine of God's otherness, of His uniqueness, that dictates the doctrine of negative attributes. That human descriptions cannot express the essence of God, that the human mind cannot know what God's nature is, is only another way of saying that God is non-human. "We are only able to apprehend the fact that He is, and cannot apprehend his quiddity," says Maimonides.12 Only God can appre hend or know His own essence. God's knowledge and man's knowledge are heterotypical, and in God, in Whom there is no plurality, His knowledge and His essence are one and the same. Accordingly, man cannot even desire or try to know God's essence. For man to desire or endeavor to know God's essence would be as if man wished or endeavored to have God's apprehension or God's knowledge. But "we cannot comprehend God's knowledge . . . for He is His knowledge and His knowledge is He," hence our desire to know Him would be "as if we desired that we be He and our apprehension His apprehension."13 What is known to man is necessarily known in terms of human knowledge. God's essence cannot be known to man because knowledge of God is available only to God himself?His knowledge and His essence being one and the same?and not to man. For man to try to know God would be as if man tried to be God. Thus, the formulation of this doctrine by some commentators in the form of the epigrammatic apothegm, "If I knew Him, I would be He" (Ilu y'dativ, he'yitiv)14 is clearly in full consonance with the Maimonidean spirit. 9 Ibid., I, 56, p. 130. 10 Ibid., I, 57, p. 133. 11 Rudolf Otto, The Idea of the Holy, trans.

God cannot be apprehended by the human intellect, and none but He himself can apprehend what He is, and our knowledge [of Him] consists in our knowledge that we are unable truly to apprehend Him.15 It is interesting to note the slight variations in the rendering of the concluding clause by various translators. However, the core meaning is unambiguously clear. Shlomo Pines's version is: ". . . our apprehension of Him consists in our inability to attain the ultimate term in apprehending Him."16 Friedlander's rendition is "our knowledge of Him consists in knowing that we are unable truly to comprehend Him."17 Jacob B. Agus's translation is: "We understand Him in the measure in which we grasp His final incomprehensibility."18 Ill Let us now turn to the negative theology of Thomas Aquinas. We cannot be diverted for more than a paragraph or two to the in I'yunim Bmahshevet Yisrael (Studies in Jewish Thought) (Jerusalem: Rubin Mass) 1 (1969): 297-331, esp. pp. 297-303. There appears to be some confusion about the authorship of the apothegm, "If I knew Him, I would be He." Rawidowicz does not directly ascribe it to Maimonides, but says only that his formulated doctrine is Maimonides' version of the apothegm. However, Julius Gutmann does ascribe it to Maimonides, in his lecture "Typussim Shel Havayah Datit" ("Types of Religious Expe rience"), in D'Varim Al Haphilosophia Shel Hadat (Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion) by Julius Guttmann (Jerusalem: The Hebrew University, 1958), p. 93. I have not been able to find this apothegm, in his verbis, in any Maimonidean text. 15 Moses Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed, I, 59, p. 139. 16 Ibid. 17 Moses Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed, trans.

One need only refer to such scholars as Richard McKeon19 and Etienne Gilson20 for some of the evidence. However, the following should be noted here, in addition to what has already been said. The works of other medieval Christian philosophers and theologians immediately before and after Thomas contain numerous references to Maimonides' Guide. Among them, probably the most notable was Albertus Magnus (ca. 1200-1280). A German monograph on the relationship between Albert the Great and Maimonides, pub lished in 1863, exhibits many extensive passages from Albert and Rabbi Moses, in parallel columns, which show them to be either completely or almost completely identical. The author of the monograph, M. Joel, stated: Es handelt sich n?mlich nicht um einzelne Stellen, sondern um ganze Abhandlungen des Maimonidischen Werkes . . . die in den Schriften Alberts reproduziert sind.21 Albert was Aquinas' teacher. The very distinguished scholar in medieval philosophy, the late Anton C. Pegis, with whom it was 19 Richard McKeon, "Maimonides the Philosopher," in Essays on Maimonides, ed. Salo W. Baron (New York: Columbia University Press, 1941), pp. 2-8. See especially p. 7. 20 Etienne Gilson, The Philosophy of St Thomas Aquinas: Authorized Translation . . . of Le Thomisme (St. Louis: B. Herder Book Company, 1925). This book contains numerous references to Maimonides. However, one lengthy footnote on page 34 is worth quoting in full: Apart from Christian thought, a special place must be reserved, among the sources of St. Thomas, to the influence of Moses Mai monides. On a good many points the position of the "Rabbi Moses" prepares that adopted by Thomism and their respective interpretation of Aristotle is often analogous. Maimonides is opposed to the Arabic "motecalemin" (theologians) just as St. Thomas opposes the Augustinian traditionalists; their mental attitude, positive and full of common-sense is singularly akin and the study of their relationship would be worthy of an exhaustive treatment. Gilson's later book, The Christian Philosophy of St Thomas Aquinas (New York: Random House, 1956) (which is a much expanded version of the earlier Le Thomisme), contains repeated references to Maimonides, with occasional identification of a Maimonidean idea as the source of a Thomastic passage. 21 M.

There is clearly good reason to suppose that it was Albert who introduced St. Thomas to Mai monides' Guide. On numerous occasions Aquinas quotes directly from the Guide. Locutions and concepts from the Guide are often reflected in Aquinas' two Summas. In De potentia, and in other works, he frequently refers to Maimonides by name, calling him Rabbi Moyses, or Moyses Egyptius, and on occasion voices disagreement with him. Without a doubt Aquinas was significantly influenced by Maimonides' ideas. As Emile Saisset, a Catholic professor of philosophy, said in 1862: "Maionide est le pr?curseur de Saint Thomas d'Aquin, et le Mor? Neboukhim annonce et pr?pare la Summa Theologiae."22 Accordingly, the discovery that so much of Aquinas' negative theology bears a close resemblance to that of Maimonides, should occasion no surprise. What follows relies heavily on the work of Professor Anton C. Pegis, and especially on his definitive and instructive paper entitled "Penitus Manet Ignotum," which appeared some 19 years ago, in Medieval Studies.23 Aquinas shares with Maimonides the doctrine of negative attributes. Affirmative attributes cannot be predicated of God. We can talk about God only by negating any attributes ascribed to Him. It is interesting to note, however, that in some respects Aquinas is more thorough and more consis tent than Maimonides on the matter of ascribing affirmative attributes to God, whereas in other respects he is less consistent and less thorough in his rejection of them. The following discussion will provide some instructive examples. On the one hand, as was pointed out earlier, in De potentia Dei Aquinas disagrees with Maimonides' view that, in talking 22 "Maimonides is the precursor of St. Thomas Aquinas, and The Guide of the Perplexed announces and paves the way for the Summa Theologiae." Emile Saisset, "La Philosophie des Juifs: Maimonide et Spinoza," Revue des Deux Mondes 37 (1862): 296-325. 23 Anton C. Pegis, "Penitus Manet Ignotum."</page><page sequence="11">MAN'S KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 601 about God, it is proper to use some positive attributes, because they indicate only God's actions and their effects, rather than purporting to signify the divine essence. In his strictures against Maimonides here, Aquinas points out that if, because God's actions have produced wisdom in man, it were proper to speak of God as being wise, then, since God's action also produces, as one of its effects, anger in man, or fire in combustible things, why would it not be proper to say that God is angry, or that God is firet He repeats this argument in the Summa Theologiae, again referring directly to Rabbi Moses, by saying that no reason could be assigned why some names more than others should be applied to God. For He is assuredly the cause of bodies in the same way as He is the cause of good things; therefore if God is good signified no more than God is the cause of good things, it might in like manner be said that God is a body, inasmuch as he is the cause of bodies.24 On the other hand, however, Aquinas is less than consistent and thoroughgoing in his rejection of positive attributes, when he allows that some names, or attributes, "signify the divine substance, but in an imperfect manner. . . . We cannot know the essence of God as He really is in Himself, but we know Him according as He is represented in the perfections of creatures."25 This is part of the evidence of the ambivalences referred to at the beginning, in the negative theology of both Maimonides and Aquinas. An additional comment on these ambivalences will appear later. However, it is, I think, quite clear that the main thrust of Aquinas' doctrine is that the essence, the nature, of God is unknowable. Early in the Summa Theologiae he asserts cate gorically that since we cannot know what God is, but rather what he is not, we cannot consider how He is but how He is not. . . . We can show how God is not, by denying of Him whatever is opposed to the idea of Him.26 We cannot know the nature of God from knowledge of crea tures, because this would be claiming to have knowledge from effect to cause. But, says Aquinas, "it is not possible in any of ^Thomas Aquinas, The Summa Theologica, trans. Fathers of the English Dominican Province (New York: Benzinger Brothers, 1947), q. 13, a. 2, vol. 1, p. 61. 25 Ibid., p. 62. 26 Ibid., q. 3 (preamble), p. 14.</page><page sequence="12">602 ISAAC FRANCK these ways to know from the effect what the cause is, unless the effect be adequate to the cause, one in which the entire virtuality of the cause is expressed."27 In Book I of the Summa Contra Gentiles Aquinas establishes that we must use the negative way in our investigations about God, because God surpasses anything that our intellect can know, and is completely and utterly different. Thus, "through negations, when we have a proper knowledge of a thing, we know that it is distinct from other things, yet what it is remains unknown."28 Accordingly, to quote again, "while we know of God what He is not, what God is penitus manet ignotum, remains completely unknown."29 This via negativa, as Professor Pegis pointed out, has momen tous consequences. Nothing positive can be said about God's quiddity. Everything positive that is said about God is a distortion, it is a reduction of God to human terms. We can achieve the highest knowledge about God when we realize that we do not and can not know Him. Then only do we know God truly when we believe Him to be above everything that is possible for men to think about God; ... for the divine substance transcends the natural knowledge of men. Hence, by the fact that some truths are proposed to man about God that exceed his reason, the opinion that God is something above that which he can think is strengthened in man.30 And, to quote once more: It is because human intelligence is not equal to the divine essence that this same divine essence surpasses our intelligence and is unknown to us; wherefore man reaches the highest point in his knowledge about God when he knows that he knows Him not, inasmuch as he knows that that which is God transcends whatever he conceives of Him.31 And finally these words of Thomas: To know God consists in this for us here and now: that we do not know what God is.32 27 Summa Contra Gentiles, Book III, Chapter 49, par. 3, p. 168. 28 Ibid., Book III, Chapter 39, par. 1, p. 127. 29 Ibid., Chapter 49, par. 9, p. 170. 30 Ibid., Book I, Chapter 5, no. 3, p. 70. 31 Thomas Aquinas, De potentia Dei, q. 7, a. 5, ad 14, concluding paragraph. 32 Thomas Aquinas, In Librum B.

Anton C. Pegis distilled out of the Thomistic negative theology consequences which seem most faithful to Thomas, theologically and philosophically sound, and very moving in emotional impact. He called the Thomistic doctrine "a radical doctrine . . . that has not escaped controversy."33 (Let me say parenthetically that Maimonides' doctrine, too, was radical, and that it too has not escaped controversy.) Aquinas' doctrine requires us, according to Professor Pegis, to insist that in fact nothing can be said affir matively about the nature of God. "Man must come to unsay the whole universe in order to say God exists properly."34 Nothing in the universe is in any way God or like God, and man must unsay and unknow everything with reference to any God-talk. Pegis's closing paragraph says it better than any summary possibly could: God transcends anything and everything that we can think about Him. But to be true to Him we must unknow Him rather than simply be ignorant of Him. We must seek Him in all His creation, we must unsay everything that His creatures are, in order thereby to stand nearer and nearer to His transcendence. When St. Thomas said that God was utterly unknown, what was he saying but that man should seek the divine transcendence by a total unknowing?35 IV The doctrine of the utter unknowability of God, or of radical negative theology, has encountered much criticism and resistance. This is not surprising. A relationship of congeniality between this doctrine and many of the traditional assumptions of popular religion, or even of the more sophisticated theologies that are based on the assumption of a personal God, is hardly to be expected. Numerous objectionable or even pernicious implications and consequences have been imputed to the negative theology of Maimonides and Aquinas in the controversies triggered by this 33 Anton C. Pegis, "Penitus Manet Ignotum," p. 225. 34 Ibid., p. 219. 35 Ibid., p. 226.</page><page sequence="14">604 ISAAC FRANCK doctrine both recently and in earlier days. I single out six such critical imputations for brief analysis, discussion, and attempted rejoinder: 1. God, the unknown and unknowable subject in such a theology, is "no subject at all," and therefore negative theology can not even claim to have knowledge that He exists. 2. This negative theology leads to and entails mysticism. 3. This negative theology leads to and entails agnosticism. 4. This negative theology is subversive of religious doctrine, of "The Law." 5. This doctrine leads "directly to the theology of silence." 6. This negative theology is a reductio ad absurdum of rational theology. (1) If God is unknowable, then there can not even be knowledge that He exists. The first of these animadversions has received various formulations. For example, the question is asked, "If God is unknowable, then how could Maimonides and Aquinas know that God exists?" In an article on "The Logic of Negative Theology," George Englebretsen said: If all we ever know of a subject is that certain attributes are denied of it ... we will never know anything about that subject (an uncircumscribed subject is an unknown subject and thus no subject at all).36 And in the same journal, two years later, Joseph A. Buijs concluded his "Comments on Maimonides' Negative Theology" with the assertion, How we can know the fact that God exists without thereby know ing anything positive about His nature is an epistemic and meta physical issue.37 In its extreme form, this criticism alleges that one of the conse quences entailed by negative theology is the denial of God's existence: But if we finally succeed in negating every attribute, we may well ask, what have we left at all. Not only can we not describe what 36 The New Scholasticism 47 (1973): 231. 37 The New Scholastic?m 49 (1975): 93.</page><page sequence="15">MAN'S KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 605 God is, but we must define Him by the very negation of description. The conclusion of the whole matter would seem to be that God is pure negation, not only non-describable, but non-existent.38 In rejoinder to this last version of the allegation, the late Leon Roth, who had formulated it in these words more than half a century before, hastened to point to "the characteristic view of Maimonides that this consequence does not follow."39 However, before reviewing Roth's reading of Maimonides on this matter, it seems proper to go back and note the contrast between Buijs's moderate contention that there is "an epistemic and metaphysical issue" in the doctrine (a cautious admonition from which one can hardly dissent), and Englebretsen's assertion that an uncircum scribed or unknown subject is "no subject at all." It is of course less than axiomatic that "an uncircumscribed subject," or an "unknown subject," is synonymous with "no subject at all." The claim that only the known, or only the knowable, exists, or even that only the knowable can be a subject of discourse, seems far from self-evident. Leon Roth's explication of Maimonides on the ascription of attributes to God, properly emphasized the frequently neglected point that the doctrine does not deny that God has a "nature." That human descriptions are inadequate to express the nature of God does not mean that God has no nature . . . each negation of inadequate conceptions of God's being reaffirms the fact that He exists. Existence in the case of God is not an accident; it is identical with His essence. The more we negate the attributes the more we affirm the essence, and we are left finally with the idea of God as absolute existence.40 Without knowing the nature or essence of God, we know that God exists because we know from our experience that things, contingent things, exist. If anything exists, and obviously finite, contingent things, such as you and I, do exist, then it cannot be the case that everything that exists is contingent. To be contingent means that the existence of the contingent thing is contingent upon, depends upon, some other thing or being. But not everything 38 Leon Roth, Spinoza, Descartes, and Maimonides (Oxford: Clarendon, 1924), p. 77. 39 Ibid. 40 Ibid.</page><page sequence="16">606 ISAAC FRANCK can be dependent on something else, i.e., not everything can have been caused by, or brought into being by, something else. At least one entity must be in existence by itself, independent of anything else, must have come into being (if it did not exist eternally) by itself, must be its own cause, i.e., must exist necessarily not contingently, and its non-existence is inconceivable. This necessarily existent being is what we call God. Some may call it existence itself (whatever this may mean), or the totality of existence. What we call God is thus the non-contingent, that which is causa sui. God is the absolute existent, to whom existence is so essential as to be His very essence. Accordingly, His very existence is different from the existence of contingent things. The very term "existence" "can only be applied equivocally to His existence and to the existence of things other than He."41 We know that God exists, that His absolute, essential existence is radically different from our existence, and our knowledge that He exists is utterly indepen dent of any affirmative attributes we may be tempted to ascribe to Him. (2) Negative theology leads to and entails mysticism. To say that God is unknowable is not to propound or imply a doctrine of mysticism. Admittedly, as Shlomo Pines points out, an approach similar to Maimonides' emphasis on the importance of negative attributes in discourse about God "may be found in mystical writings." However, Pines says categorically, "Maimonides is no mystic," and his negative theology does not recommend any mystical or obscurantist detachment from the knowledge of things that are not God. Its intention and effect is rather the pursuit of the kind of knowledge of things that avoids "misplaced references to God's essence."42 The label "mystic" hardly befits Maimonides or Aquinas. Mysticism is a doctrine or a range of doctrines that espouse a variety of notions about the nature of God and assert that there are modes of apprehending God, such as direct intuition or other "mystical experiences." These mystical methods are putatively different from and more reliable than the "normal" empirical and rational methods of apprehending other entities. To assert that God is unknowable in no way entails the espousal of mysticism or 41 Moses Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed, p. 80. 42 Shlomo Pines, Introduction to The Guide of the Perplexed, p. xcvi.</page><page sequence="17">MAN'S KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 607 the acceptance of its claims; in fact, the two are mutually exclusive. To say that God is unknowable to the human intellect is, indeed, to say, using the word in its narrow, lexical sense, that God is a "mystery." But this is only to say that we do not know or apprehend or understand the nature of God, and that we know only that he exists; and it is not to suggest or propound a doctrine of mysticism with all the claims that it would entail. (3) Negative theology leads to and entails agnosticism. In the article referred to above, George Englebretsen concluded that "the way of negation is no new way to God," and that this negative theology is "indiscernible from agnosticism."43 The charge of agnosticism is also made several times by F. C. Copleston, in his book on Thomas Aquinas: "Exclusive adherence to the negative way would lead to agnosticism about the divine nature."44 "In Aquinas' account of our natural knowledge of the divine nature there is, then, a certain agnosticism."45 "As Aquinas saw clearly, a certain measure of 'agnosticism' is inevitable."46 However, Copleston appears to be equivocating here in two ways. On the one hand he seems to be shuttling back and forth between the interpretation of Aquinas as saying that man can have no knowl edge at all of God's nature, and the interpretation of Aquinas as saying that man can have some knowledge of the divine nature. Admittedly, there is evidence of such equivocation in both Aquinas and Maimonides?a subject to which we shall return. On the other hand, Copleston also appears to be equivocating in his own use of the term "agnosticism," using it at times as a disparaging name for an erroneous doctrine, but at other times as a label for a perhaps regrettable but unavoidable doctrine, the alternatives to which are beset by difficulties. Clearly, Copleston acknowledges, affirming positive predicates of God inescapably leads either to anthropomorphism, or to the reduction of statements about God to myths. But, "Aquinas was not prepared to accept either an anthropomorphic view of God or an interpretation of theological propositions as so many myths."47 43 George Engelbretsen, p. 232. 44 F. C. Copleston, Aquinas (New York: Penguin Books, 1955), p. 128. 45 Ibid., p. 131. 46 Ibid., p. 134. 47 Ibid.</page><page sequence="18">608 ISAAC FRANCK Copleston ends up with a question-begging declaration to the effect that Aquinas' agnosticism, then, is not agnosticism in the modern sense. He has no doubt about the existence of God, and he is far from saying that we can know nothing about the divine nature or that we can make only negative statements about it.48 This conclusion here is question-begging because, first, as was shown earlier, the logic of radical negative theology does not entail doubts about the existence of God. Secondly, it is question-begging because the full, authentic doctrine of Aquinas and of Maimonides (except for the equivocations to which we shall return) says clearly and precisely what Copleston cavalierly claims Aquinas did not say, namely, that "we know nothing about the divine nature," and "that we can make only negative statements about it." The two distinct issues, namely, whether man can know that God exists and whether man can know God's nature or essence, must be kept distinct from each other. To the former question the answer is clearly affirmative. To the latter, the answer is clearly negative: the nature of God is unknowable, and to call this doctrine "agnos ticism" is not to refute it or to disparage it, but only to describe it. It is of some use, in this context, to rehabilitate the terms "agnostic" and "agnosticism" and restore them to respectable company in the philosophical lexicon. In their unadulterated, etymological sense these terms betoken an acknowledgement of not knowing. An agnostic position with reference to any issue is a position which says that the subject in question is unknown or unknowable. And this, simpliciter, is what the adherent of negative theology says about the nature of God. (4) Negative theology is subversive of religious doctrine, of "The Law. " The charge that negative theology is subversive of religion has been lodged principally against Maimonides, and was repeated most recently by the late Leo Strauss, who stated that "the teaching that positive attributes of God are impossible . . . clearly contradicts the teaching of the law."49 In this charge we hear reverberations of nearly eight centuries of anti-Maimonidean 48 Ibid. 49 Leo Strauss, "How to Begin to Study The Guide of the Perplexed," in Moses Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed, pp. xlviii-xlix.</page><page sequence="19">MAN'S KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 609 argument and polemic by some of the teachers and thinkers in the mainstream of Jewish religious and philosophical literature. In elaborating his charge, Strauss averred that: Maimonides' doctrine of attributes would be entirely negative and even subversive. For the doctrine culminates in the assertion that we grasp of God only that he is and not what he is.50 But this is very puzzling, coming as it does from Strauss, since the latter view, namely, "that we grasp of God only that He is and not what He is," is precisely what was held by both Maimonides and Aquinas, as we tried to show above. Moreover, as Strauss surely knew, Maimonides anticipated these attacks, and took the offensive himself, as it were. For he in fact warned that, on the contrary, it is the ascription of affirmative attributes to God that is subversive of religion. In the Guide he stated categorically that "he who affirms that God has affirmative attri butes . . . has abolished his belief in the existence of the Deity without being aware of it."51 Baldly stated, then, the paradox is that on the one hand Maimonides clearly rejected the ascription of positive attributes to God and characterized such predication as equivalent to the denial of God's existence, whereas Strauss, on the other hand, alleged that the teaching which denies affir mative attributes to God contradicts the teaching of the Law and is subversive. It appears to me that what is involved here is a puzzling neglect or circumvention by Strauss, in this relatively recent work of his on Maimonides, of a fundamental, all-important aspect of Maimonides' thought that has eluded very many of his readers throughout the centuries since the publication of his Guide; but in systematically explicating this aspect Leo Strauss himself has generally been among the very few and among the most diligent and incisive readers in recent years.52 In the passages quoted above from his "Introduction to the Guide," Strauss explains that 50 Ibid., p. xlviii. 51 Ibid., I, 60, p. 143. 52 Leo Strauss, Persecution and the Art of Writing (Glencoe, 111.: The Free Press, 1952).

Simoni Publishing House, 1955).</page><page sequence="20">610 ISAAC FRANCK Maimonides' doctrine of the attributes "is a secret doctrine."53 Though a number of other scholars and commentators have made the same observation, including some contemporaries of Maimonides, this aspect of his philosophical theology is neither widely known nor well-understood. Regrettably, the limitations of this paper do not make possible an adequate exposition of it, and a brief and much simplified sketch will have to suffice here. An understanding of this matter can be helped by noting, first, that throughout the text of the Guide there are scattered numerous admonitions by its author not to disclose certain truths to the masses, and second, that these admonitions are not limited only to his doctrine of attributes. Among the locutions conveying Rabbi Moses' wish for secrecy we find the following: "my purpose is that the truths be glimpsed and then again concealed"; "If we explained what ought to be explained, it would be unsuitable for the masses among the people"; "I adjure every reader of this Treatise of mine . . . not to explain to another anything in it"; "in speaking about very obscure matters it is necessary to conceal some parts and disclose others"; "these matters are only for a few solitary individuals of a very special sort, and not for the multi tude"; "it is not permitted to divulge these matters to all people"; "these are obscure matters . . . they are truly the mystery of the Torah . . . matters that ought not to be spoken of except in chapter headings."54 Specifically with reference to his doctrine of the attributes, Maimonides cautions that "this notion concerning them also should not be divulged to the masses."55 The important fact about Maimonides to which these caveats draw the attention of the careful student is that, under a variety of disguises and deliberate obfuscations, he propounded in the Guide two distinguishable though related and overlapping doctrines about God, a manifest doctrine and a secret doctrine; or a "double faith" theory consisting respectively, to use Maimonides own terminology, of (a) "necessary beliefs" and (b) "true beliefs." "Necessary beliefs" embrace a wide range of religious observances and rituals, as well as ethical prescriptions and imperatives that 53 Moses Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed, p. xlviii. 54 Ibid., pp. 7, 9, 15, 18; I, 34, p. 79; I, 71, p. 175; pp. 80-81. 65 Ibid., I, 59, p. 142. 56 Ibid., Ill, 28, pp. 512-14.</page><page sequence="21">MAN'S KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 611 in the aggregate make possible an orderly, civilized, tranquil, and just society and that presuppose belief in the traditional doctrine of a personal God who commands, gets angry, punishes and rewards, and responds to our actions and prayers. "True beliefs," on the other hand, include the de-anthropomorphization and even the de-personalization of God, recognition that the nature and essence of God are unknowable, that God is "wholly other," wholly unlike the things of the world, and is imperturbable and unaffected by human expressions. God, therefore, is an object of pure, disinterested love and contemplation, and man's most exalted worship and piety is this kind of disinterested, contemplative love. Few humans are capable of achieving this purely intellectual love and contemplation. Certainly the masses are not. For the masses it is the system of "necessary beliefs" that is important, and only if these beliefs are followed will there be a civilized society that will make possible the rise of the small number of rare individuals who will be capable of understanding and living by the "true beliefs." "Necessary beliefs" therefore concern actions, behavior, societal interrelations and imperatives, and the system of "practical com mandments" in the written Torah and in the transmitted Oral Tradition of Rabbinic teaching and codes. "True beliefs," on the other hand, concern what Maimonides calls "opinions" or "correct opinions," i.e., philosophical beliefs concerning the nature of the universe, creation ex nihilo, the meaning of words that purport to refer to God, etc. Maimonides explains this succinctly: "Sum up what we have said concerning beliefs as follows: In some cases a commandment communicates a correct belief, which is the one and only thing aimed at?at for instance the belief in the unity and eternity of the deity and in His not being a body. In other cases the belief is necessary for the abolition of reciprocal wrongdoing or for the acquisition of a noble moral quality?as, for instance, the belief that He, may He be exalted, has a violent anger against those who do injustice . . . and as the belief that He, may He be exalted, responds instantaneously to the prayer of someone wronged or deceived."57 In numerous instances the "true beliefs" or "correct opinions" clearly coincide with the "necessary beliefs" which have as their goal the establishment of morality and social justice. One of the 57 Ibid., pp. 513-14.</page><page sequence="22">612 ISAAC FRANCK examples given by Maimonides is the statute of the Sabbath, the "first intention" of which is "the belief in correct opinions, namely, in the creation of the world in time," and "its contribution in fortifying this principle." However, "the intention also included the abolition of mutual wrongdoing among men."58 Now, it is belief in the unknowability of God, God's being "wholly other," imperturbable, depersonalized, not characterized by anthropomorphic attributes, etc., that is among the "true beliefs" to which philosophical thought and analysis will lead the religiously committed Jew who is able to engage in such inquiries. But the masses are unable to comprehend many of these beliefs. Indeed the exposure of the masses to such beliefs may weaken their faith in and jeopardize their adherence to the imperatives that are part of the system of "necessary beliefs." True beliefs may be taught only to very special, singular individuals, and must not be disclosed to the masses. Such beliefs form a secret doctrine, limited to the intellectual elite who form the hypothetical audience to whom much of the Guide is addressed. For this elite group, the secret doctrine, including the denial of affirmative attributes in relation to God and the doctrine that we can know only that God is and not what God is, far from being subversive of their faith, is its very strength and its firm foundation, and the ground for their true contemplative love and worship of God. The secret doctrine does indeed contradict some of the traditional, popular "teaching of the Law" that is part of the system of "necessary beliefs" and is ordained by Divine decree in order to reduce mutual wrongdoing among humans and assure a moral society. It is precisely for this reason that the doctrine should not be disclosed to the multitudes who are unable to understand it and are likely to draw erroneous conclusions from it. Leo Strauss was among those who understood and explicated most acutely this obscure aspect of Maimonidean thought,59 hence the perplexity evoked by his comments quoted above. Now, two questions arise here in connection with Thomas Aquinas. First, was his negative theology among the elements in his thought that triggered controversy and opposition to him in his own day? Second, did Thomas feel or ever say that some 58 Ibid., Ill, 32, p. 531. 59 See n. 52 above.</page><page sequence="23">MAN'S KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 613 philosophico-theological teachings should be considered secret doc trine and not be divulged to the masses? These are interesting historical questions, but I am not familiar with any of the published systematic research on them. However, one Aquinas text seems to indicate that the subject of secret truths to be concealed from the masses did receive some attention in Christian theological literature, and that St. Thomas leaned toward the view that some divine truths ought to be concealed from the masses to whom they might do harm. The discussion occurs in Thomas's Commentary on the De Trinitate of Boethius, in the article entitled "Whether Divine Truths Ought To Be Concealed By New and Obscure Words." After raising the question, and quoting Biblical and other texts on both sides, Aquinas concluded But . . . there are other [truths] . . . which, if openly presented, cause harm to those hearing them. ... If any subtleties are proposed to uncultivated people, these folk may find in the imperfect comprehension of them matter for error.60 Then, after quoting concurring views from Gregory and Augustine, Aquinas reiterates his view that "there is no denial of the fact that there are mysteries which ought to be concealed by obscuring words."61 I leave this matter without further comment. (5) Negative theology leads directly to the Theology of Silence. This charge, in these very words, was made by George Englebretsen whom we quoted earlier,62 and the same charge was also made, but more dramatically and forcefully, by the logician Fred Som mers, in his essay entitled "What Can We Say About God."63 In that essay Sommers claimed that, to the question " 'what can we say about God?' the negative theologian answers, 'nothing!' "64 There is a deceptive appearance of plausibility in this claim by Sommers, deceptive, I venture to suggest, for the author himself as well as the reader, because of the tacit, uncritical, and question 60 Thomas Aquinas, "Commentary on the De Trinitate of Boethius," q. 2, a. 4. According to the standard edition, Sancti Thomae De Aquino Expositio Super Librum Boethii De Trinitate, 2nd ed., ed. B. Decker (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1959), p. 99. I am grateful to John Wippel of Catholic University for bringing this Aquinas text to my attention. 61 Ibid. 62 George Englebretsen, p. 232 (see n. 36). 63 Fred Sommers, "What We Can Say About God," (see n. 4 above). 64 Ibid., p. 66.</page><page sequence="24">614 ISAAC FRANCK begging assumption that underlies it, namely, that rational dis course about God is possible only in terms of affirmative divine attributes. Naturally, therefore, on this assumption, since negative theology insists that affirmative attributes can not be predicated of God, the negative theologian appears self-condemned, strictly speaking, to saying nothing about God. The seeming plausibility of Sommers's charge can be further unmasked if we exhibit the unarticulated tautological syllogism into which he seems to have trapped himself, while trapping the negative theologian as well as the reader: Whatever we can say nothing affirmative about, we can say nothing about. We can say nothing affirmative about God. Therefore, we can say nothing about God. But manifestly, the question-begging, tautological reasoning here is Sommers's, and is not to be charged to the negative theologian. For the latter, discourse about God is not only possible (though of course not via the ascription to Him of affirmative attributes), but is indeed mandatory (see below), and it is negative discourse about God that is mandatory. To the question "What can we say about God?" the negative theologian responds as follows: We have an inexhaustibly large number of things to say about God, namely, to say what God is notl Because erring mankind has for so long in the past been saying and repeating an infinitely large number of things about God in ascribing affirmative attributes to Him, and because mankind will continue in its erring future to make an infinitely great number of attributions of affirmative characteristics to Him, it is the task of negative theologians, and of those who have been persuaded by them, to "unknow" and "unsay" what has been claimed to be known about God, and what has been said about God, and to continue saying and repeating in an infinitely great number of ways what God is notl Now, this can hardly be called a theology of silence! And thus, by this path, we arrive finally at "rational theology" and its place within negative theology. (6) Negative theology is a reductio ad absurdum of rational theology. This imputation also comes from the pen of Fred Sommers, in the same essay in which charge number 5 appeared.65 65 Ibid.</page><page sequence="25">MAN'S KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 615 The rejoinder here is essentially the same as the rejoinder above. For a long time, "rational theology" was taken to mean largely the systematic setting forth, analysis, and explication of affirmative attributes of God. This seems to be also Sommers's assumed definition, and, as explained earlier, understood in this way the enterprise is misguided and also idolatrous. If, however, the discipline of theology were understood to be the systematic pursuit of the countless ways of saying what God is not, then, what can possibly be more rational in that pursuit than to continue with relentless perseverance to deny and unsay the affirmative state ments about God, and thus to spread understanding of God's utter differentness and ultimate incomprehensibility? To teach that every positive attribution that is predicated of God is distortion, is a reduction of God to human terms, and thus is idolatrous, this is the task of "rational theology." Let no one be under any illusion that this task is an easy one. Kennedy Institute of Ethics School of Medicine Georgetown University</page></plain_text>
