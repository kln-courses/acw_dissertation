A second and hitherto unknown shaft in Tomb V (Ml 1.1) was completely cleaned and shows impressive architectural features. The cleaning also demonstrated that there was an archaeological interest during the Mamluke Period. More than 2000 signs of hieroglyphs were copied for an extensive palaeography from the First Intermediate Period/Period of Regions and the early Middle Kingdom. Other tombs from these periods were also examined concerning architecture, paintings and epigraphy (HI 1.1, N 13. 91 and PI 3.1) as well as pottery. The Tomb of the Dogs from the Late and Graeco-Roman Period is covered by several layers proving later usages as Coptic dwellings. The animal re- mains are not only of canids, but also of other species, such as cats. From 17th August to 7th October 2010 the Egyptian-German joint mission of Sohag Univer- sity, Freie Universität Berlin and Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz conducted its eighth season of fieldwork1 in the ancient necropolis of Asyut situated in the western moun- tains.2 Fieldwork focused on the tombs of the First Intermediate Period/Period of Regions3 and the Middle Kingdom, and in particular included cleaning a shaft in Tomb V (Ml 1.1, see below), the examination of the Northern Soldiers-Tomb (HI 1.1, see below) and of Tomb N13.91, where its architecture is now clear for the documentation of stage 7. The epigraphy in Tomb P13.1 was studied and the fragmentary texts are published here (see below). The project of a palaeography of several of these tombs from the First Intermediate Period/Period of Regions until the early Twelfth Dynasty is described below. From later periods, the graffiti in Tomb N13.1 are to be mentioned which again had to be examined. The Tomb of the Dogs was further explored (see below). The pottery from the Pharaonic Period and Coptic Period was examined as well as the animal remains (see below). The mapping of the necropolis was continued as usual.4 1 During the fieldwork we received full cooperation and encouragement from the Supreme Council of An- tiquities. Thanks are due in particular to the Chairman, Dr. Zahi Hawass, to the Head of the Archaeology Sector, Dr. Sabry Abdel-Aziz, to the Director General of Antiquities for Middle Egypt, Dr. Abdel-Rahman El-Aidi, to the Director General of Asyut, Mr. Abdel-Satar Ahmed Mohamed, and to the Head of the Foreign and Egyptian Missions Affairs and Permanent Committee, Dr. Mohamed Ismail. 2 For previous work cf.

Tomb V (Ml 1.1) The cleaning of Tomb V (First Intermediate Period/Period of Regions) continued from 17th August to 5th October 2010. Josephine Malur, Mohamed Helmi, Hesham Faheed Ahmed, Michael van Eisbergen and Monika Zöller-Engelhardt supervised the work. After one un- finished shaft had already been cleaned during last season,5 a second shaft was found at the central axis of the tomb (Taf. 6a). The original floor of the cleaned area around the opening of the shaft was covered by the debris of the tomb's collapsed ceiling and by a layer of burnt bones. The collapse of the ceiling was the result of quarrying activities during the first part of the nineteenth century CE. The layer of burnt bones was probably accumulated by Christian anachoretes, who used the tomb as a dwelling place. Bones, bandages, pottery sherds and gravel were also used to level the uneven ground in Tombs III and IV. Most of the bones used for levelling in Tomb V are canide bones. These bones seem to come from the Tomb of the Dogs, which is situated in stage6 5 below Tomb V.7 The Late Antique dwellers of Tomb V seem to have appreciated the easily accessible material of the animal burials in the Tomb of the Dogs as building material. This layer of burnt bones was about one meter high and evenly dispersed on the rocky ground of Tomb V. Only at one spot, the bones had been disturbed and revealed a kind of opening. This was the spot for the opening of the completely hewn shaft. As the filling of the shaft did not reveal finds which are younger than the Mamluke Period, the shaft seems to have been excavated during the Mamluke Period. Among others, Mamluke pottery as well as fragments of a corroded hoe (fahs) were found.

It was not noticed by the French Expedition in 1799 and must have been covered by debris from the collapsed ceiling latest in the 1830's. The nearly rectangular opening of the shaft measures 3.30 m on the eastern side and 3.20 m on the western side, 2.00 m on the northern side and 1.55 m on the southern side. The shaft leads vertically 10.50 m deep under the surface. At its base, the entrance to a burial chamber opens to the (archaeological) north.9 The entrance is framed by a door jamb (Taf. 6b). A passage (1.48 m long, 1.34 m wide, 1.70 m high), which is situated approx. 10-15 cm above the ground floor of the shaft, leads into a square- cut chamber, which measures 5.20 m by 5.20 m and which is 2.00 m high. In this chamber, the upper edge of the eastern side of the passage's door jamb shows a pivot, which was probably used for a wooden door. Therefore the burial chamber seems to have been visited by priests and other personnel of the necropolis at least on festive days. In the centre of the burial chamber, a pillar supports an architrave leading from west to east (Taf. 7a). The pil- lar tapers upward. The walls of the burial chamber are mostly smooth; the floor is uneven, probably due to unfinished cutting. The floor is situated 10-15 cm deeper than the passage, which means approximately on the same level as the bottom of the shaft. The depth of the shaft and the layout of the burial chamber correspond exactly to the Ancient Egyptian cubit measure: depth of the shaft: 20 cubits (10.50 m), floor of the burial chamber: 10 cubits by 10 cubits (5.20 m by 5.20 m). J.K./J.M. Palaeography of hieroglyphs in Asyuti nomarchs ' tombs Samples of hieroglyphs from the First Intermediate Period/Period of Regions Tombs III, IV and V, from Tomb N13.1 (reign of Mentuhotep II) and from Tomb I (reign of Senwosret I) were collated or drawn again in order to compile a palaeography of hieroglyphic signs from Asyut during the First Intermediate Period/Period of Regions and early Middle Kingdom. Palaeographical studies on the First Intermediate Period/Period of Regions and Middle Kingdom hieroglyphs are still relatively rare and often very selective10 and the statement of Alan Henderson Gardiner is still valid: "The study of the individual hieroglyphs is still in its infancy, though some admirable pioneering work has been done."'1 The situation in case 8 Cf. O. El Daly, Egyptology: The Missing Millennium. Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings, Lon- don 2005,31-55. 9 Under the precondition that the false door on the rear wall of Tomb V is ideally oriented to the west, we may assume that the Ancient Egyptians interpreted the opening to the burial chamber as north. This archaeolog- ical north corresponds to a geographical northwest. 10 Cf. F. LI. Griffith, Beni Hasan III, ASE 5, London 1896, 1-32, Pis. 1-6; F.LI. Griffith, A Collection of Hi- eroglyphs.

SAK 40 of Asyut is comparable: In 1930, Pierre Montet published some examples of hieroglyphs from Tomb I but without giving any comment.12 In 1989, Donald B. Spanel presented some notes on Asyuti palaeography.13 Recently, Rainer Hannig published a huge collection of hieroglyphs from Asyuti coffins based on shots taken by video-camera.14 Unfortunately the shots and their reproduction are often of poor quality. In addition the arrangement of the hieroglyphs is far from being user-friendly.15 The compilation of a hieroglyphic palaeography from the Asyuti nomarchs' tombs (I, III, IV, V, N 13.1) has been a desideratum until now. In addition to some copper-engravings from the French Expedition,16 there are only hand copies taken by Griffith and Montet.17 Complete facsimiles were taken for the first time by The Asyut Project during 2003-2010. Based on these facsimiles, the palaeography shall establish a tool to identify regional pecu- liarities of Asyuti hieroglyphs and date different shapes of hieroglyphs. A distinction will be made between incised and painted hieroglyphs, because the different working process produces different outlines and details. The planned study will deal with a selection of more than 2000 hieroglyphs (M. El-Khadragy, J. Kahl and S. Shafik prepare the final publica- tion). Its arrangement will be based on Gardiner's Sign-list. The samples will be reproduced in relatively large scale (mostly at 50 %) thus being user-friendly. The hieroglyphs from the walls of the nomarchs' tombs are often quite "monumental". Especially the first corridor (height approx. 1 1 m) and the great transverse hall of Tomb I are decorated with long texts written in hieroglyphs, which one can still read if standing in front of the high walls. In general, the method of writing incised hieroglyphs was as fol- lows: A layer of gypsum plaster was applied on the limestone wall, columns and hiero- glyphs were outlined in red, the hieroglyphs were cut into the gypsum plaster, and finally the hieroglyphs were coloured in with blue paint. Painted hieroglyphs were written as fol- lows: Likewise, gypsum plaster was applied on the wall, columns and hieroglyphs were outlined in red, and finally the hieroglyphs were painted in one or several colours (black, red, blue, green, yellow) on the wall. As an example for the palaeography, the attestations for the hieroglyph Gardiner Sign-list D 35 are reproduced in Fig. 1. One can observe two groups: one shows the arms with the thumb upward (Tomb V and III), the other shows the arms with the thumb downward (Tomb IV and I). After all hieroglyphs have been studied a decision can be made if this difference is of chronological relevance. J.K. / M.Kh. 12 P.

The determinative of the papyrus roll is written without ties, which is only attested before the Twelfth Dynasty (cf. W. Schenkel, Früh- mittelägyptische Studien, Bonn 1961, 27-28). (b) hir.t/hír.t (?): The designation of the woman in col. x+2 may be completed to hir.t/hsr.t "the widow" in the context of helping unprotected people ( hj n hzr.t "husband for the widow")21. (c) wbr. The sign being a variant for wbî22 is very interesting showing precisely a woodworking chisel combined with an elbow-shaped bow driving a wooden drill (cf.

Doxey, Egyptian Non-Royal Epithets of the Middle Kingdom, PÄ 12, Leiden 1998, 200: Time of "Am. I - Sen. I., Am.

Morenz, Sinn und Spiel der Zeichen - Visuelle Poesie im Alten Ägypten, Pictura et Poesis 21, Cologne 2008, 141 sqq.</page><page sequence="10">190 J. Kahl et al. SAK 40 don 2003, 29 and 50). We know this kind of tool already from a scene of woodworkers in a tomb of the Old Kingdom, where the accompanying text makes clear, that drilling with this kind of tool is called htj (Epron/Wïld, Tombeau de Ti, pl. 174: drilling the cover of a box, called htj fd.t). In the New Kingdom we find several depictions of this type of drill, but without textual explanation (examples shown by Stocks, Experiments, 33, 50, 208sqq.). Reading wb?, it is remarkable that the word is not written with the usual stone drill (Gardi- ner Sign List U24), but obviously with a special wood drill which surely was very familiar in Asyut during the time of the First Intermediate Period and the Middle Kingdom, when plenty of coffins and statues were made of wooden material. The inscription on this part of the entrance seems to contain some biographical sentences, similar to the Asyutian Tomb M 10.1. 23 For parallels cf. J. Janssen, De Traditioneele Egyptische Autobiografie vóór het Nieuwe Rijk, Leiden 1946, 1, 81; II, 53 and I, 46sq.; II, 29sq. (Thanks to J.F. Quack for this last reference and his affirmation of my tentatively proposed readings). (d) Smr.w (?): This location which is written twice with a plant and a rectangle is ques- tionable. If the last sign can be taken as a variant for the nome sign spz.t (Gardiner Sign-list N 24)24, we can read Šrtf.w "Upper Egypt, South" with this unusual determinative. If not, a possible reading š nsw, with transposition of (n)sw, could be associated with the name of the lake of Senwosret III in the Fayum (cf. also: š rsj ), but this seems unlikely. Jochem Kahl proposed a reading Nhb which would make it possible to read the honorary title [hrß.w-dp Nhb "the chiefs of El Kab" (Wb II, 309. 3; Ward, Index, 126, no. 1074). (e) nb hps: cf. Doxey, Epithets, 325 (Hatnub gr. 16 and 20). (f) wdi šjj.t (?): The sign before the head of the ram is even unsecure, the combination of wdi and sfj.t cannot be found in other sources. The sign ri for the common epithet rz sfj.t "with great authority" seems more probable, but the shape doesn't seem to correspond with this reading. (g) ki rn (?): With this separation and reading of the signs, an epithet seems to be writ- ten which we only know from later sources and for gods. For k? rn cf. Wb V, 2.13; C. Leitz (ed.), Lexikon der ägyptischen Götter und Götterbezeichnungen VII, OLA 116, 166b-c: in Saite, Greek and Roman times an epithet of Osiris, Horus, Haroëris. (h) hitj Šmr.w: cf. Ward, Index, 104, no. 863; Doxey, Epithets, 343, no. 11.2: several examples in Hatnub and El Bersheh; N. Favry, Le nomarque sous le règne de Sésostris I, Paris 2004, 1 1 1, no. 50: title of nomarchs in the Eleventh and Twelfth Dynasty. (i) hitj-c: D. Franke, in: St. Quirke, ed., Middle Kingdom Studies, New Maiden, Surrey 1991, 52 translates this title with "mayor", and points out, that the real nomarchs of the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty were always wearing the combination of the titles hitj-r jmj-n hmw.w-ntr hrj-dp rs of nome XY. Favry, Le nomarque, 90 argues in the same direc- tion, but indicates that sometimes the title hstj-r can be translated directly by "nomarch". d) Dating As Becker has shown, until now we can identify five different important persons with the name Djefai-Hapi (which has the meaning "The Nile is my nourishment") from the Middle 23 U. Verhoeven, in: Middle Kingdom Studies in Memory of Detlef Franke, Philippika, Marburg (in print). 24 In Tomb I (Siut I; P 10. 1) the sign is written with a closed rectangle and lines inside, cf. Griffith, Siût and Dêr Rifeh, PI. 6, col. 268; confirmed by J. Kahl for his palaeography of the Asyutian Tombs. Cf. also J.P.

Since in Tomb I (Siut I; PI 0.1) this sign is already written with ties (in the shape of sign Y 1), Tomb P13. 1 should be earlier than the Twelfth Dynasty. The level of this tomb between the upper terrace with the tombs from the First Intermediate Period/Period of Regions and Djefai-Hapi II and the lower terrace with the tombs of Djefai-Hapi I and III is able to sup- port this opinion. On the other hand, until now the architecture of PI 3.1 with originally three rooms is not attested before the Twelfth Dynasty being for example similar to the tomb of Djefai-Hapi I (Siut I; PIO. 1) and perhaps already Djefai-Hapi II (Siut II; 013.1). The habit to bury the nomarchs in the province is proved for the time span from the begin- ning of the Twelfth Dynasty until Amenemhat III29, but it is not sure that the owner of PI 3.1 was a real nomarch. In the light of the previously stated arguments, it seems probable that the owner of Tomb PI 3.1 was living before or during the nomarchs Djefai-Hapi II and I, what means, at the very end of the Eleventh Dynasty and/or during the reign of Ame- nemhat I: Djefai-Hapi V: Tomb P13.1 end of Eleventh, beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty Djefai-Hapi II: Tomb II (01 3. 1 ) beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty Djefai-Hapi I: Tomb I (P 10.1) Senwosret I Djefai-Hapi III: Tomb VII Amenemhat II Djefai-Hapi (IV): Tomb VI ?

SAK 40 Originally facing east, the tomb façade is now missing; its ceiling has collapsed as has the western wall, which is still preserved in parts but not in its original place. The gap between the standing rock and the block of the northern wall indicates that it might have been moved one meter southwards, thus indicating an original width of about 14 m. The back panel is unfinished. Two horizontal, 1.50 m long niches were cut in its southernmost part. Their regularity points to the original plan, but they might have been reused in later times. The partially preserved south wall is currently about 14 m long31 and shows two projec- tions, one near the front and the other near the rear. The front projection is also a character- istic feature of Tombs III and IV. As the tomb has never been fully documented in photographs or facsimiles and having no published plan, our excursion conducted a thorough documentation of the tomb between the last season 2009 until now. Our work focused on: a) Cleaning the surface of the inner hall of the tomb from the huge blocks and the layer of limestone debris from the collapsed ceiling several meters high32. The surface was cleaned from the western wall onwards. While cleaning, some architectural elements came to light. A large part of the original floor is now visible at the southern wall showing a hori- zontal line above which the wall was smoothed. The upper part of a pillar could be seen in the middle of the hall, 5 m from the western wall (Taf. 10a). b) Documentation of the upper part of the scene of the northern wall after removing the debris (about 20 cm high), as the lower part is still under debris; it was decided not to ex- plore this area due to the fragile condition of the scenes, which must be restored and docu- mented before any further damage is done to them. Magee's33 description of the northern wall decoration overlooked some of the still existing remnants of figures and inscriptions, which were rediscovered recently. The figure of a goddess can be seen, which is preserved from the belly to the knees in a dress with a multi-coloured net of pearls, while her left arm is hanging beside her back. Inscriptions with green division lines are also painted on this thin layer of plaster. The wall surface has suffered much damage, as the plaster has fallen in some areas. c) Restoring the decoration of the huge stone placed in front of the forecourt; this seems to be a part of the ceiling. The restoration work has been undertaken by Mr. Khaled Abdel- malek from SCA Restoration Department, and some hieroglyphic signs are now recognisa- ble (Taf. 10b). d) Documentation of the tomb-chapel via photographs, which were taken by Fritz Barthel. e) Making an architectural plan of the tomb-chapel, which has already been produced by Cornelia Goerlich (Fig. 6). 31 The remaining decoration of this wall has been already published by M. El-Khadragy, The Northern Sol- diers-Tomb at Asyut, in: SAK 35, 2006, 147-164, Figs. 3-7, PI. 12. 32 The ceiling has collapsed due to quarrying activities in the nineteenth century CE. 33 Magee, Asyût II, 36-37.</page><page sequence="13">2011 The Asyut Project: Eighth Season of Fieldwork (2010) 193_ Fig. 6: Tomb HI 1.1 (© The Asyut Project; C.

These ob- jects do not belong to Tomb HI 1.1, they probably originate from the stage above: 1. Blue glazed-composition wedjat-eye, with the excavation number S09/14. It measures 2 cm wide by 4 cm long. 2. A fragment of a wooden coffin that bears the excavation number S 1 0/st 1 2 and measures 15.5 cm long and 3.5 cm wide. It shows an inscription with a diagonal star clock. 3. Blue green scarab bearing number S10/5. It is 1.5 cm long and 1.0 cm wide. 4. Calcite-alabaster vessel, excavation number S 10/30.

Head of a wooden model, S10/st49, that measures 4 cm high and 4 cm wide.34 M.A./H.F. Tomb of the Dogs area The work at the Tomb of the Dogs area concentrated on two different localities.35 On the one hand the cross-section east of the partly cleaned area of the gallery leading to the rock cut chambers of the Tomb of the Dogs (011.13) was cleaned to the gebel (Fig. 7). On the other hand work began on a big entrance (Ol 1 .23) situated below and east of the gallery, as dogs' bones and parts of mummified remains indicated that it might be the original en- trance, to this point unknown, leading up to the complex. a) Forefront of Ol 1.13 While cleaning this season to the rock surface east of the gallery, remains of several tombs belonging to different periods, partly cutting into and destroying each other, came to light. One chamber (Ol 1.14), opening up in the northern part of the gallery, obviously does not belong to the complex of the Tomb of the Dogs itself. It was filled with debris almost up to the ceiling. Some scattered human bones and mummified remains, alongside with wooden uninscribed coffin fragments from several disturbed burials were found on top of the debris. One complete human mummy was also recovered. Especially noteworthy are the remains of a shaft (Ol 1.15: Taf. Ila) with a side chamber opening to the south.36 The shaft's north- ern wall was destroyed in later times by extending the shaft to the north for reasons, which are not clear. A niche37 was found in the western wall belonging to the original shaft which still included a headless non-inscribed calcite-alabaster-statue of a seated man (SI 0/1 6, SCA-No 203). 38 It was found together with some early Middle Kingdom pottery. An offer- ing stand of the same period was laying directly above it. Scattered human bones around the statue indicate that the objects were placed here after the tomb had already been violat- ed. The small chamber to the south of the shaft was disturbed and produced only few finds, 34 For more wooden models found by the Project Team, see M. Zöller, in: J. Kahl/M. El-Khadragy/U.

Kahl is in preparation.</page><page sequence="15">201 1 The Asyut Project: Eighth Season of Fieldwork (2010) 195 among others a bronze model adze blade (SI 0/1 9, SCA-No 210) which was found directly in front of the entrance and a bronze model chisel blade (SI 0/21, SCA-No 209) which was found inside the chamber. Both also point to a Middle Kingdom date of the original shaft and chamber as well as a craft-related profession of the tomb owner.39 In the south-eastern part of the cross-section two anthropomorphic burial pits (011.17) came to light, a burial feature, which is known to be common in the Ptolemaic Period.40 In the eastern niche of an otherwise disturbed and empty tomb (011.16) a ram's skull still showing traces of bandages and the remains of a bird mummy were found on a mud floor. In the north-eastern part of the cross-section another shaft (011.18), cutting an earlier chamber, included a very poor, but undisturbed burial of two individuals. Due to the lack of any grave-goods, the burial cannot be dated, but certainly belongs to a later period. b) Ol 1.23 It was assumed last year that a narrow but very high corridor, situated lower than Ol 1.13 and running from east to west (Taf. lib), might provide access to the chambers of the Tomb of the Dogs. A tomb robbers' hole directly to the east of the corridor suggested that the corridor originally started more to the east, as the edge of its northern wall could be seen inside the hole. Several layers of a Coptic white plastered floor with muddy base lay- ers in the section of the hole (Taf. 1 lb) made clear that this part of the corridor already col- lapsed during antiquity. During the Coptic Period the area was reused as a dwelling and is most likely connected with the monastery at Deir el-Meitin.41 The floor layers were only preserved in the east and totally destroyed in front of the corridor; nevertheless, a small preserved part of the floor in the southwest, directly attached to the gebel, showed for cer- tain that it once extended further to the west. In this section of the floor the lower part of an amphora was preserved in situ. It can be dated to the fifth-sixth century CE.42 Another Coptic floor was discovered in a larger niche flanking the corridor to the north (Taf. 1 le). As it lays approximately 90 cm deeper than the white plastered floor in the east, its date of origin might be earlier. The floor consists of red plaster with a mud basement and was renewed or repaired with white plaster, which was applied directly upon the red floor. At the edges of the floor, partly also still covering a smaller niche in the east of the northern wall, traces of whitish wall-plaster applied on a layer of mud plaster could be observed. The plaster at the bottom of the niche was renewed with a pinkish plaster at a certain point. " Compare e.g. the model tools of the carpenter Antef from Asyut (Twelfth Dynasty), see W.C.

Goerlich)</page><page sequence="17">201 1 The Asyut Project: Eighth Season of Fieldwork (2010) 197 After the documentation of the Coptic floor layers the removal of debris from the corri- dor itself was started. The ground floor of the corridor in the southern half was reached. The northern part was not cleaned to the ground level, as a round mud-brick structure was found attached to the northern wall. Sherds of several broken storage vessels and botanical remains, such as olive pits, were found inside and suggest its function as storage unit (Taf. 12). It cannot be attributed to a special floor layer. The pottery can be dated to the sixth- seventh century CE and points to a Coptic occupancy of the site not before the sixth century CE. Work inside the corridor had to be stopped after a few meters due to a hole in the ceil- ing, which caused large amounts of debris deposited above to slope down to the inside. Several dog mummies and bones included in this debris make it likely that the corridor will not provide access to the rock cut chambers of the Tomb of the Dogs after all, as the detect- ed concentration of dog bones in Ol 1.23 might have derived from debris coming down through the hole in the ceiling. S.P. Animal remains In this season the faunal remains retrieved in front of the Tomb of the Dogs as well as from inside the tomb (011.13), which is dedicated to the canine gods Wepwawet and/or Anubis, were studied. Full-scale work in the tomb has not yet started, therefore the layout of the tomb has not yet been established, but there is only a general sketch of the tomb. According to the extend of our access to the tomb, it consists of a corridor stretching north-south with four pillars in its western part and some openings filled with debris in its eastern part. To the west of the corridor a passage leads to a large room (Taf. 13a).43 Sampling on the surface at some spots in the tomb was carried out. The interior of the tomb is in a very disturbed condition, evidently caused by years of plundering. The majori- ty of remains that we could see in the tomb were of animals and animal mummy-related materials such as linen and string. While bandages of animal mummies were mostly ripped apart, each scattered bone was well preserved. Other finds include human remains, wooden coffin fragments and pottery fragments. Most of the sampled fauna material was collected within an area of approx. 1 m x 1 m on the surface of the chosen locations inside the tomb: two spots in the corridor in 2009 and 14 spots (nine in the corridor, one in the passage and four in the large room) in 2010. The material was identified and recorded on site. This pre- liminary report only outlines the result as of this record. Detailed analysis is currently in preparation. Among the collected animal remains from the tomb the most frequently identified spe- cies was dog Canis familiaris, followed by cat Felis sp. (F. catus and F. silvestris ) and jackal Canis aureus. Two fox species Vulpes vulpes and V. rueppelli, cattle Bos taurus and sheep Ovis arie s were also identified in small numbers. Apart from mammals, a few bird remains (mummified birds) were present as well. 43 J. Kahl, in: J. Kahl/M. El-Khadragy/U. Verhoeven et al., SAK 39, 2010, 198.</page><page sequence="18">198 J. Kahl et al. SAK 40 Inside the tomb canine remains (bones as well as remains of soft tissue), most of which were partially or entirely covered by a dark brown/black substance (i.e. resin/bitumen), were piled up in disordered layers. They were sometimes partially covered with linen and string. This dark colour substance adhered especially to the canid, felid and bird remains. The quantity of the substance varied from material to material; cattle and sheep contained hardly any. So far all mummified remains retrieved on the surface in the tomb were incom- plete torn mummies. Here, preliminary results on the most predominant taxon dog (and dog/jackal) remains will be briefly presented. There was a clear size variation of dogs, ranging from small size to large size individuals. Age also varied from new-born/infantile to old. It may safely be as- sumed that many infantile dogs were included among the sampled dogs (dog/jackal). In most cases it was hard to determine their causes of death. Canids with strangulation marks were not recognised in our materials so far.44 Some infant individuals may have died of natural causes, perhaps due to insufficient care after their birth, and the same holds true for old individuals due to their old ages. It must be noted that a considerable number of dog maxillae and mandibulae with their alveolus/alveoli closed after the loss of teeth were ob- served. Pathological features, such as dento-alveolar abscess, bone fracture, a type of de- generative disease in the spine Spondylosis deformans, rickets and osteomalacia etc., were also found in the sampled materials, all of which were also present in the fauna material collected from the surface survey in 2008. These features could be seemingly related to indirect, if not direct causes of death. During the sampling in the tomb also pottery fragments were found in small numbers. They are mostly dated from the Late Period to the Graeco-Roman Period.45 The samples included one pottery fragment dating back to the Middle Kingdom. A few of them have attributes of pottery for the purpose of embalming. Besides pottery fragments, a few ostraca with Demotic inscriptions were collected. Unlike the animal remains from inside of the tomb, complete mummified remains were found from the debris around the Tomb of the Dogs (Taf. 13b). The trace of black sub- stance (resin/bitumen) could hardly be observed on remains in the torn mummies as well as scattered animal remains outside of the tomb. The study of animal remains both from the inside and outside of the tomb will be con- tinued in the next fieldwork season. In addition, on-site x-raying of the complete animal mummies in cooperation with the SCA is planned. C.K. 44 In previous studies some authors referred to dogs killed by strangulation (L. Lortet/C.

It was fragmentarily preserved, with the non-diagnostic pieces constituting a dominating majority. Although no complete objects have been found so far, it was possible to reconstruct, and subsequently identify, most of the vessel types. The material was very mixed, with fragments of one jar found scattered throughout several, sometimes over five, archaeological contexts. It was possible to identify ceramics representative of periods from the early Old King- dom (Third Dynasty) to the Ptolemaic Period. The majority are Egyptian produce, possibly local, manufactured in various kinds of the Nile silts. A slightly smaller group are the Marl clay ceramics from other regions of Egypt (primarily Upper Egypt and a few fragments from Fayum), as well as imports. It appears that the vessels had been placed in the tomb at a later date and can therefore not be directly associated with its functioning. This interpreta- tion is supported by the preservation state of the pottery, its chronological and typological diversity.47 The Old Kingdom ceramics are represented by infrequent bread mould and beer jar fragments. One nearly complete bread mould (Fig. 8.1) has been found alongside a few non-diagnostic fragments. The object, dated to the second half of the Sixth Dynas- ty/terminal Old Kingdom48, is executed in a fabric, more sandy than organic, described as Nile C by the Vienna System.49 Only non-diagnostic fragments of the beer jars are present, which cannot be dated precisely. In addition, the material of so-called "spatulas" or "pal- ettes" was identified. These are oval, rectangular or trapezoidal fragments of the body with smooth edges. Their function is uncertain, though probably they served as tools or cosmetic palettes.50 46 Previous report on pottery from the tombs see: J. Kahl/M. El-Khadragy/U.

SAK 40 The ubiquitous jars in the assemblage represent the First Intermediate Period and early Middle Kingdom: small or medium sized, round, cylindrical, and sack- or pear-shaped. These wheel-turned vessels are made of Nile B1 or B2 and have either scraped or trimmed round bases. Their surface is usually untreated, though it can be occasionally red-slipped. It is of a significance that the jars are numerous both in this tomb and throughout the necropo- lis and often present irregular asymmetric shapes, crudely worked surface, as well as signs of firing in an uncontrolled atmosphere (such as, cracks, under- or overfiring).51 These fea- tures are the tell-tale signs of the typical Necropolis Ware , that is, ceramics produced on a massive scale to specifically meet the funerary demands in the character of grave goods.52 A fragment of a cylindrical stand with an outwards everted rim (Fig. 8.2) requires spe- cial attention. The vessel, executed in fine version of Nile B2, has a red-slipped exterior surface entirely and only upper part of interior. It appears that the whole object, or at least its top, had been made by slab building, which is indicated by the uneven thickness of the walls and the inward folding of the excess clay in the upper part of the vessel. This rare and interesting method, not present in the analogical, published so far material in other regions of Egypt, seems to be an entirely local invention.53 The Middle Kingdom is the most represented period in the assemblage, due to the best preservation of ceramics dated to this epoch. The most frequent vessels are the carinated bowls (at least three different sub-types) or hemispherical bowls (at least four sub-types). They are made from different variants of Nile B1 or B2, wheel-turned, with scraped and sometimes smoothed base and either red-slipped or untreated surface. The surface of the hemispherical bowls, which date to the early Middle Kingdom phase (2nd half of the Eleventh Dynasty), is entirely covered with the red slip, in distinction to the similar objects from Elephantine, where this treatment occurs only on the inner and outer surfaces of the top half of the vessel, leaving the base uncoated. It appears that the hemi- spherical bowls continued to be made in accordance with the evolution of local designs during the early phase. The style change occurred between the early and mid-Twelfth Dyn- asty, when they started showing an astonishing uniformity in terms of shape, fabric (pre- dominantly Nile Bl), and surface treatment. The local carinated bowls are rather unique and uncharacteristic for other regions of Egypt. Special attention should be given to the two Twelfth Dynasty types. One is defined by an almost conical bottom part, which had been so severely trimmed that in effect the vessel, having an insufficient standing surface, leans on 51 J. Kahl/E.-M. Engel/L.

Zitman, Necropolis of As- siut, Figs. 2.1-3, 7.1-3, 13.8, 15.13, 17.3-12, 18. 52 Some types of vessels are typical for necropoleis and virtually absent from the settlement, cf.: J. Bour- riau, Cemetery and Settlement Pottery of the Second Intermediate Period to the Early New Kingdom, in: BES 8, 1986/87, 47-59; A. Wodziñska, Domestic and Funerary/Sacral Pottery from Fourth Dynasty Giza, in: T.I. Rzeuska/A. Wodziñska (eds.), Studies on Old Kingdom Pottery, Warsaw 2009, 209-224; T. Rzeuska, Between Edfu and Qubbet el-Hawa, Remarks on Upper Egyptian Necropolis Pottery (in print). 53 An analogical pot-stand comes from Beni Hassan, cf. J. Bourriau, Umm el-Ga'ab. Pottery from the Nile Valley before the Arab Conquest, Cambridge 1981, 70, no. 130. The ceramic, which is dated to the Eleventh to Twelfth Dynasties (up to the reign of Senwosret II), resembles the Asyutian in the shape, but not in the manu- facturing technique.

Further, infrequent fragments of tall and large cylindrical stands, occasional globular beer jar fragments as well as medium sized plates are preserved from this period. The stands have polished and red-slipped exteriors and served as objects associated with the mortuary cult. The globular beer jars are also covered with the pinkish-red slip. Moreover, significant is the presence of fragments of vessels manufactured in all three variants of Marl C fabric, Marl Cl, C2 and C Compact, though it is impossible to determine the vessel types as all the fragments are parts of the belly. However, they attest to the existence of commer- cial relations with the Fayum region. This fact is even more interesting considering the absence of the Upper Egyptian Marl clay ceramics, i.e. Marl A3, so typical for Middle Kingdom. So far, no ceramics within the assemblage were identified with the Second and Third Intermediate Periods. The New Kingdom, in turn, is represented by several variants of the luxurious Blue Painted wares: Blue Painted on Uncoated, Blue Painted on White Slipped, as well as, extremely rare, Blue Painted on Red Slipped. Vessels made of the various Nile silts date to the late Eighteenth and early Nineteenth Dynasties and are fragmentarily pre- served, so that pieces of one object can be scattered throughout several different contexts. Hence, it is possible that more fragments still remain to be uncovered, allowing an even more complete reconstruction of the vessels in the future. An especially interesting object dated to this period is ajar fragment with a figurai decoration (Fig. 9). A red-painted male figure, wearing a short apron, is shown within a white painted vertical panel. This is a unique vessel, having no analogies in entire Egypt.56 Furthermore, the New Kingdom peri- od is also represented by fragments of both the storage vessels, such as meat jars, as well as the cream-slipped Marl D amphorae. Sherds representing the Late to Ptolemaic Periods are numerous. However, the majority are fragments of Animal Necropolis Ware (ANW). There are medium sized carinated bowls (Fig. 10.1), lids of various sizes and shapes, sometimes resembling plates or small-footed hemispherical bowls (Fig. 10.2), as well as medium to large cylindrical jars with a charac- teristic rim, grooved on the inside to accommodate a lid (Fig. 10.3-4). Altogether, these vessels represent the same pottery kind, executed in fabrics Nile B2 or C, wheel-turned and with untreated surfaces. Some were soaked with black resin or/and coated with a white plaster-like mixture and occasionally have pieces of bandages adhering to the surface.57 A typical funerary set comprised a jar, which was closed either by a lid or a bowl turned up- side down and sealed with a white plaster. An identical ceramic assemblage is known from the Ibiotapheion at Tuna el-Gebel and the Anubieion at Saqqara.58 Their distinctive, sharp 54 Parallels: M.

SAK 40 resinous odour, identical with the scent of the sacred animal mummies from the Tomb of the Dogs, proves beyond any doubt that these vessels served as containers for mummified animals. Although the material (over 100 kg) contains many different variants of both the jars and the lids, presenting a wide range of sizes and shapes, it is difficult to date them precisely at the current stage of the research. This is due to the fact that the jars, which come from the discussed tomb, had been redeposited there and no analogical and well strat- ified ceramics are known from the Tomb of the Dogs so far. Also dated to the Late Period are fragments of canopic jars (?) with a yellow-painted vertical panel which contains an inscription as well as small fragments of vessels with a painted decoration in white, yellow and red, applied post-firing. Finally, one should note the presence of many fragments of imported pottery. To date, it has been possible to identify two fabrics: one from Samos and the other from Phoenicia (amphorae known as torpedo). b) Tomb V (Khety I, Ml 1.1) Ceramic material from Tomb V analysed during this season is somewhat less numerous than that of Tomb III. It is important to note that the entire assemblage comes from a slump layer resting on top of the collapsed ceiling and as such has no direct relation with the pri- mary function of the tomb. Although the non-diagnostic fragments are the most frequent, a few objects deserve a closer look. There are two Third- early Fourth Dynasty Meidum bowls, one thin-walled made of Marl AI (Fig. 1 l.l)59 and the other from the fine Nile silt (Fig. 1 1.2).60 Another early Old Kingdom example is a beer jar base (Fig. 1 1.3). The Late Period is represented by a rim fragment of a large storage vessel, the so-called "sausage jar" used for embalming remains, executed in Nile B2 (Fig. 1 1.4).61 c) Surface survey During this season the surface survey has been commenced in the upper area of the north- ern part of the Gebel. Despite the fact that the survey is a work in progress, the preliminary observations appear significant enough for the chronological topography of the site to be mentioned at this stage. The area under investigation has yielded a large concentration of pottery dated to the Second (?) and Third to early Fourth Dynasties. It comprises predomi- nantly beer jar bases (Figs. 12.3-4) and a small quantity of beer jar rims (Figs. 12.1-2). At Hermopolis Magna.

All examples are handmade from Nile silt B2 or C: bases in the hollowing and pinching method, the bodies and tops in the coiling method. Importantly, these vessels indicate an earlier date for the origins of the necropolis, pushing it back in time from the Sixth to as early as the Third or even Second Dynasty.63 Additionally, two pottery fragments from the later periods should be mentioned. One is a rim fragment of a Marl Al storage jar, which can be dated to the Late Period (Fig. 13.1), while the second is a ring-base of a small bowl representing Ptolemaic Black Ware (Fig. 13.2), extremely rare outside the Delta and Memphis regions.64 d) Tomb of the Dogs The Tomb of the Dogs has produced rather limited pottery finds and only a few show a primary relation to the cemetery. Paradoxically, there are no examples of the Animal Ne- cropolis Ware among the material. However, fragments of the "sausage" jars in two sizes, medium and large have been found. They are commonly thought to be containers for by- products of the mummification process, but also have been used as containers for the mummified bodies of the sacred animals. e) Summary Summarising the above deliberations on the Pharaonic pottery analysed during 2010 season it is possible to formulate preliminary conclusions regarding some of the chronological periods represented within the ceramic assemblage. The Old Kingdom vessels, though in- frequent, perfectly fit the pan-Egyptian tradition and resemble ceramics discovered from the contemporary sites in the Nile Valley. The astonishing typological continuity and uni- formity of the Old Kingdom pottery has yet to be understood. During the First Intermediate Period, this situation changed with the destruction of the political and economic unity, which forced the emergence of the numerous production centres and development of the distinctive local pottery traditions. Interesting examples from Asyut, dated to this period, are spindle-shaped beer-jars. They are a transitional form, a link in the chain of the typolog- ical evolution, so to speak, in shape resembling similar objects from the late Old Kingdom, but made in a method that marks the next epoch. While those in the Old Kingdom had been entirely handmade, these were executed in a mixed technique, with a handmade base and wheel-turned top half of the vessel. This transitional character makes them very unique on the pan-Egyptian scale. Two phases in the pottery evolution could be observed during the Middle Kingdom (or at least until the mid-Twelfth Dynasty, as no latter Middle Kingdom ceramics have been identified). In the early phase, some vessel types (e.g. hemispherical and carinated bowls) appeared to be embedded in the local, Asyutian, tradition and clearly differed from pottery manufactured in other production centres, such as Elephantine. In the latter phase, however, the original local designs gave way to countrywide trends, and so the particular ceramic types from Asyut became, in effect, identical with those from, e.g., Elephantine, Edfu, or 63 PM IV, 259-269. However already J. Kahl, Ancient Asyut, 1 09 referred to Early Dynastic and/or Third Dynasty stone and copper vessels. 64 H. Jacquet-Gordon, An Indigenous Black Ware of the Ptolemaic Period, in: J.

Curiously, no narrow and spiral-shaped vessels, so characteristic for the Middle Kingdom necropoleis, have been observed in the ceramic material from Asyut to date. Furthermore, the Middle Kingdom ceramics attest to the existence of trade relations between Asyut and Fayum. Unfortunately, the examples of the New Kingdom pottery have so far almost exclusive- ly been limited to the luxurious vessels most likely of Theban provenance, which prevents making any conclusions at this stage. It can be stated, however, that these vessels represent the highest quality ceramics of the period and must have been associated with the tombs of high dignitaries. The Late to Ptolemaic Periods are represented chiefly by the numerous ceramics de- scribed as the Animal Necropolis Ware. Despite their seemingly identical appearance, they pose an interesting challenge for a researcher. They must have been mass-produced in the workshops, most likely located in the immediate vicinity of the Sacred Animal Necropolis. Both the local and imported pottery of this period attests to the intense contact between Asyut and Thebes, Delta, as well as the Eastern Mediterranean.
