<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 1Indirect satire:  theory and Spenserian practice In Edmund Spenser’s Prosopopoia; or, Mother Hubberds Tale, a tonal  shift characterizes the final episode, in which the villainous Fox and Ape,  having wreaked havoc in the three estates as husbandmen, clerics, and  courtiers, go even farther by usurping royal power. The self-conscious  Chaucerianism of the first episodes—summarized by Kent van den Berg  as “the recreative fiction that animals are like men”—gives way to a more  fully developed, and more clearly satirical, fictional world in which “men  are like animals” (“Counterfeit,” 92). Fable shifts to allegory when the  generic landscape of the first three episodes—a vaguely England-like place  that has sheep, priests, a court, and so forth—becomes a more sharply  focused fictional world, an allegorical world that invites the reader to  make connections to the real world and real people. This changed rela- tionship between the fictional world of Mother Hubberds Tale and the real  England of its readers contributes to the shift from the feeling of medieval  complaint to the indirect satire that is the subject of this book. In this chapter, I aim to begin the process of thinking analytically about  indirect satire, an understudied and undertheorized form of satirical  writing. Numerous scholars have described Spenser’s satirical method- ology in ways that emphasize his efforts to balance goals of criticism with  a strong impulse toward self-preservation: Lauren Silberman comments  on the slipperiness of potential topical identifications in Mother Hubberds  Tale: “As the poet holds up mirrors more than one to himself and his  objects ... . Spenser makes it virtually impossible to isolate a discrete  political attack on an identifiable object” (“Aesopian,” 237). Annabel  Patterson, analyzing the repeated references to passports in the same  poem, extends the concept metaphorically (by way of Sidney’s “great  passport of Poetry”) to satirical poetry, which “becomes the safe-conduct  by which criticism of church and state passes through the world with  impunity” (“Still reading,” 444). Speaking of The Shepheardes Calender as  </page> <page sequence="2"> 12 Spenserian satire part of the broader tradition of sixteenth-century protest literature, Scott  Lucas argues that authors of “potentially dangerous material” sought  “rhetorical forms that could at once maximize the communicative func- tion of their works while minimizing the chance that hostile readers  could use their own words against them as evidence of offensive intent,”  a more direct expression of the metaphorically expressed ideas quoted  from Patterson and Silberman (Lucas, “Diggon Davie,” 152). Thus, the why of Spenser’s satirical methodology seems clear. I wish  to add to the conversation an analysis of what indirect satire is and how  authors such as Spenser and his imitators create literary works that  convey criticisms of particular persons or institutions only through hints  or allusions that prompt the crystallization of satirical meanings within  the mind of the reader. In contrast to direct satire, which more or less  clearly identifies its targets of criticism, both scholars and readers have  a harder time identifying and interpreting indirect satire, because of the  satirist’s efforts to provide a smokescreen of deniability about criticisms  launched at those with the power to punish. Thus, it is important to carve  out space from the genres of fable, complaint, and pastoral for the indi- rect satirical poems written by Spenser and imitated by many others at  the end of the sixteenth century.  Indirect satire, distinct from the less focused criticisms of humanity  or society found in fables or complaint, which I will refer to as “general  satire,” creates a fictional world that references the real world—that is, an  allegorical world—in order to criticize the real world. The author uses allu- sion, symbol, and analogy selectively to point the reader to make connec- tions on the appropriate axes between the allegorical and real worlds. If  we imagine the real world as one plane and the fictional allegorical world  as a parallel plane, these indirect references serve to connect points on  the real plane with points on the allegorical plane: more connecting lines  make the reader’s job of interpretation easier but increase the possibility  of punitive or censoring retribution; fewer of these indirect references, of  course, have the opposite effects, leading to the vanishing point of general  satire found in fable, complaint, or pastoral, the genres that indirect satire  often purported to be in the late sixteenth century. Why call it “indirect satire” if allegory is a key to its creation of meaning?  Why not call it “allegorical satire”? I focus on indirection because allegory  is a pervasive mode of satirical meaning-making (and indeed, pervasive  in literary meaning-making in general): the general satire one might find  in a fable or pastoral derives from the allegorical connection between, say,  the barnyard of the fable or the Arcadia of the pastoral and the real world  </page> <page sequence="3"> Indirect satire 13 of writer and reader. Even satires as direct in their attacks on targets as the  Martin Marprelate tracts use allegory to create some meanings simply to  be clever: what is the creation of the brothers Martin Junior and Martin  Senior but an allegory representing the idea that repression of dissent  will breed more dissent? Although I will focus repeatedly in this book on  the way that “allegorical intuition”—which sometimes hits a reader in a  flash midway through a poem with the sense that the work references the  real world in some way—serves as a signal to seek and decipher satirical  meanings, I interest myself here in the approach to and specificity of the  writer’s targets, with indirect satire toeing an uneasy line between general  satire and direct satire. The reader may intuit this sense that the author intends meaning  beyond the text when the author’s use of apparently benign modes such as  complaint, fable, and pastoral is characterized by details that suggest that  the fictional world of the work allegorizes the real world. Satire appears,  in either large or small doses, in a number of Spenser’s works, and the  fruitfulness of his invention and his talent leads to a variety of forms, but  Spenser’s signature in satire is indirection, as we see him create count- less ways of expressing criticism, contempt, disgust, without quite coming  right out and saying it. Before moving into a more theoretical discussion  of indirect satire, I will illustrate my points about the techniques of indi- rect satire by attention to Spenser’s most famous satirical character, the  Fox, with reference to the precursors of the figure. The literary ancestry of Spenser’s Fox Of the two main characters in Mother Hubberds Tale, Spenser repeatedly  emphasizes the greater guilt of the Fox: the first reference to the charac- ters tells us that the Fox “misguided” the Ape, and the last reference calls  him “first Author of that treacherie” (Spenser, Mother Hubberds, lines 38,  1379). In between, Spenser develops a portrait of a bloodthirsty, greedy,  corrupt creature who aims for ever-increasing power, most importantly  through his role as chief advisor to the Ape in his role as the false king.  Whereas sixteenth-century allegorical satire often leads to readerly and  critical dissension, with multiple competing hypotheses regarding attri- bution (including multiple scholarly disagreements about whom Spenser  satirizes through the Ape), reading the Fox has been, from the begin- ning, uncomplicated: the Fox allegorically represents William Cecil, Lord  Burghley, Queen Elizabeth’s chief advisor. We know that Elizabethans  interpreted Spenser’s Fox as referring to Burghley because of Richard  </page> <page sequence="4"> 14 Spenserian satire Peterson’s discovery of a letter from Thomas Tresham regarding the  “calling-in” of the Complaints volume and by Bruce Danner’s careful cata- loguing of numerous sixteenth- and seventeenth-century readers’ identi- fication of the fox in Mother Hubberds Tale with Burghley (Petti, “Beasts”;  Peterson, “Laurel crown”; Danner, Edmund Spenser’s War, chapter 5). So  Spenser succeeded in communicating with his audience, though perhaps  too well, given that Mother Hubberds Tale, after being called in by March  1591, was not published again until 1612, after the deaths of not only  Lord Burghley himself but also his equally powerful son, Robert Cecil,  Earl of Salisbury. Although this indirect satire may thus have been a bit  too direct, the relatively clear interpretive response of its earliest readers  to the Fox makes this an excellent object for analysis of Spenser’s charac- teristic satirical methods. Other foxes in Aesopian fables such as Chaucer’s Nun’s Priest’s Tale,  Reynard the Fox, mid-sixteenth-century anti-Catholic polemic, and  Spenser’s own “Maye” from The Shepheardes Calender illustrate the  two “types” of prosopopoietic foxes in early modern literature—fox as  corrupt courtier and fox as corrupt pastor. Both types of fictional fox  import meaning intersemiotically from medieval and early modern fox  symbolism and natural-historical ideas about foxes (a concept that Sean  Henry explores with reference to the crocodile in Mother Hubberds Tale  in “How doth the little Crocodile”). The varying connections between  the fictional world and reality in these different texts demonstrate the  continuum between fable and satiric fable, and the same continua can be  imagined, of course, between complaint and satirical complaint, pastoral  and satirical pastoral, or any other genre or mode that an indirect satirist  might coopt for satirical purposes. Fable functions allegorically, of course, with the explicitly stated moral  guaranteeing that all readers will be able to make the desired connection  between the forest or barnyard and the real world. In the terms of cogni- tive blending theory, best known to literary scholars through its influence  on cognitive metaphor theory, we can speak of the barnyard or forest as  one of the “input spaces” (see Fauconnier and Turner, The Way We Think,  chapter 3). In Chaucer’s Nun’s Priest’s Tale and the anonymous Reynard  the Fox, “the court” serves as another of the input spaces, but they func- tion differently, with Chaucer juxtaposing court and barnyard language  and imagery in order to create the mock-heroic sense of deflation and  the Reynard poet progressively metamorphosing the setting from a fully  animal world to a hybrid world in which Reynard seems “really” to be  royalty. Although Reynard offers a clearer picture of real-world courtly  </page> <page sequence="5"> Indirect satire 15 abuses, neither poem attacks a specific target, and thus both are, at most,  general satire.  Chauntecleer, Pertelote, and Russell the Fox inhabit a fable-world  barnyard, not a pointedly allegorical version of the real world. Chaucer’s  references to the court create a blended space in the reader’s mind, but  in a way that pushes the scene firmly back to the barnyard, rather than  pointing insistently to the real world. Quick juxtapositions of barnyard  and court crystallize in readers’ minds the sense that Chauntecleer is  not a hero or prince but a mock-version of same. Immediately after a  detail that emphasizes the animality of the characters, when Chauntecleer  clucks to call his hens to him “For he hadde founde a corn, lay in the yerd”  (Chaucer, Nun’s Priest, line 3175), Chaucer describes him as royal (“real”),  as looking like a “grym leoun,” and as walking on his toes because he  disdains to set his whole foot on the ground (lines 3176, 3179–81). Imme- diately thereafter, “he chukketh whan he hath a corn yfounde,” and then  the narrator describes him as “roial, as a prince is in his halle” (lines 3182,  3184). The incongruous blend of barnyard and court doesn’t prompt the  reader to seek real-world targets to connect with Chauntecleer’s pride;  instead, it delineates his character in a way that motivates his suscepti- bility to the flattery of the fox, Russell. Both Chauntecleer and Russell are  susceptible to flattery because they prize themselves too highly, as though  they really are courtiers, but both remain for readers simply animals. The  explicit moral to courtly readers (“Allas, ye lordes, many a fals flatour /  Is in youre courtes / ... / Beth war, ye lordes, of hir trecherye,” Chaucer,  Nun’s Priest, lines 3325–26, 3330) invites readers to apply the lessons of  the fable to real life. Yet this moral, applied from the barnyard to the real  world, clarifies the distance between the two worlds.  In Reynard the Fox (translated into English by William Caxton in 1481  and reprinted several times over the following century before the time of  Spenser’s career), like The Nun’s Priest’s Tale, the work begins in a fable- world, with animals behaving like animals: the initial complaints of the  animals against Reynard, like Chauntecleer’s corn in the yard, remind us  of animal behaviors and preoccupations, not those of humans. Isegryme  the Wolf complains that Reynard “hath bepissed my children where as  they lay, in suche wyse that they therof be waxen blinde” (Raynarde the  Foxe, A5v). Curteyse the Hound accuses Reynard of stealing a pudding  from him. And although Reynard’s home, Malepardus, is called a “castel”  (Raynarde the Foxe, passim), the description calls to mind a fox-hole: “for  Malepardus was ful of holes, here one hole &amp; there an other, and yonder  an other, narow, croked, &amp; longe, with many wayes to go out, whiche he  </page> <page sequence="6"> 16 Spenserian satire opened &amp; shette when it pleaseth hym, and when he had nede” (Raynarde  the Foxe, B5v).1 As the plot progresses, however, the characters begin to seem more  human, and the fable-world contains enough of the institutions of the  real world (a king, legal system, castles, duels, and so forth) to take on  the character of a hybrid world, fully animal and fully human, in which  Reynard’s crimes begin to seem less like those of a fox and more like those  of a sociopath. He expertly plays the typical desires of the animals who try  to bring him to justice (Bruin the Bear wants honey, Tybert the Cat wants  mice) against the fable-humans’ desires to acquire and defend property in  order to punish his animal summoners, allowing him to avoid his day in  court. Reynard’s character changes over the course of the work, so that by  the end, the animal who had “bepissed” the eyes of the wolf cubs becomes  a nobleman who “with his frendes and lynage departed nobly fro the  kynge; and wente unto his castell Malepardus” (Raynarde the Foxe, S8r).  The work by the end clearly references the real world of medieval Europe:  There is in ye worlde moche sede lefte of ye Fox ... though they haue no  reed berdes, yet there ben found moo Foxes now than euer were here  tofore ... These reigne now moche in euery countre ... in ye popes court  ye emperours, the kynges, dukes or any other lordes. (Raynarde the Foxe,  T1r–T1v) Yet the author cautions the reader not to read too closely: “There is no good  man blamed therein[;] it is spoken generally. Let euerye man take his owne  parte as it belongeth &amp; behoueth, and he that fyndeth hym giltye in any  dele or part therof, lette hym amende hymselfe” (Raynarde the Foxe, T4r).  In other words, the narrator avers that this is general satire, not indirect  satire. Reynard the Fox allegorizes the real world more clearly than does  The Nun’s Priest’s Tale, but still not specifically, and so I find no evidence  of indirect satire in the English version.2 The names of the animals are  unremarkable and thus do not suggest allusions to real people. The most  unusual word in the work, Malepardus (“Maleperduys” in Caxton’s 1481  edition), the name of Reynard’s fox-hole/castle, turns out to be a corrupted   1 Compare with Edward Topsell’s description of foxes’ dens: “for the abode of Foxes in the  day time is in the caues and holes of the earth, and come not abroad til the night. These  dens haue many caues in them, and passages in and out, that when the Tertars shall set  vpon him in the earth, he may go forth some other way” (Topsell, Historie, 223).  2 The Reynard tales originated in the twelfth century with the Latin Ysengrimus, and  French, Dutch, German, and English versions and translations circulated in Europe  during the late medieval period. Scholars have found topical satirical content, with  various targets, in the medieval Continental versions; see Varty, Reynard the Fox, espe- cially chapters by Jill Mann, Jean Subrenat, and Jean-Marc Pastré. </page> <page sequence="7"> Indirect satire 17 version of the French word for St. John’s wort: “This plant is called Millep- ertuis (or thousand holes) because the leaues of it are all full of so small  holes, that one can scarce see them, but onely betwixt their sight and  the sun” (de la Primaudaye, French Academie, 335). Obviously a name  that means “thousand holes” serves as a fitting moniker for Reynard’s  confusing den with many paths and exits, not an allusion to signal a  real-world satirical target. Without verbal allusions or plot segments that  parallel real-world occurrences in order to connect fiction to reality in a  way that creates a clear, sharp critique of some particular person or insti- tution, the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century English versions of Reynard  the Fox, in their application to the real world, remain general satire.  Both The Nun’s Priest’s Tale and Reynard the Fox exemplify the Aeso- pian tradition of fable, which Annabel Patterson describes as a “complex  medium of political analysis” that in the late sixteenth century became  in England “a flexible and constantly renewable system of metaphorical  substitutions for actual events, persons, or political concepts that can,  but need not, be recognized as such” (Patterson, Fables, 75, 52). The fable  form itself, Patterson argues, codes political ideas in animal stories (just  as the pastoral and the complaint are known for calling attention to the  evils of the world), but this does not always rise to the level of a clear  particular attack. Nevertheless, in the Reynard stories, the figure of the  fox serves to satirize a specifically courtly set of abuses, even if no partic- ular persons seem to be targeted. In addition to this political, courtly type of fox satire, Spenser also  draws on a distinct tradition of prosopopoietic foxes that derives from  what Katherine C. Little refers to as “ecclesiastical pastoral” (Trans- forming Work, 3–5), in which foxes allegorize one type of corrupt pastor.  Little argues for a medieval influence on early modern pastoral through  the ecclesiastical pastoral that allegorizes priests as shepherds, as distinct  from the classical pastoral tradition that has received the bulk of scholarly  attention for its influence on early modern pastoral. Similarly, with regard  to the literary ancestors of Spenser’s Fox, we can distinguish the foxes that  form part of the Aesopian tradition, which tends to comment on political  situations, from foxes that derive from sixteenth-century ecclesiastical  pastoral and thus comment on concerns about the clergy. Little’s definition of ecclesiastical pastoral as “allegorical pastoral ... in  which the reader is meant to understand the shepherds as priests and the  ‘shepherding’ they discuss as referring to clerical duties and/or religious  beliefs and practices” can illuminate the way that this type of pastoral  shades into satire through extension of the allegory (Little, Transforming  </page> <page sequence="8"> 18 Spenserian satire Work, 3). The evil figure who thwarts the good shepherd is not a bad  shepherd but rather a fox or a wolf; a usefully heavy-handed example of  this appears in the mid-sixteenth-century polemics of William Turner,  who wrote The Hunting and Finding Out of the Romish Fox ... (1543),  The Rescuing of the Romish Fox ... (1545), and The Hunting of the Romish  Wolf (1555; republished with a new preface and title during the 1560s as  The Hunting of the Fox and the Wolfe, because they make havocke of the  sheepe of Christ Jesus). Harold Stein summarizes the overall symbolism of  Turner’s works thus:  Thus to Turner a fox is a person who seems to be or pretends to be a member  of the Church of England, though at heart he has Romish beliefs, while a  wolf is a Romanist in both belief and outward profession. Edwardian foxes  become Marian wolves, and, as we now know, Marian wolves similarly  become Elizabethan foxes. (Stein, “Spenser and Turner,” 349–50)3 Numerous scholars have noted the applicability of this animal symbolism  to Spenser’s “Maye” and “September” eclogues, citing as evidence the  facts that, in “Maye,” Spenser changed the wolf of his Aesopian source  (Caxton’s ninth fable of book 2) into a fox and that, in “September,” Hobbi- nol’s naïve response to Diggon Davy’s comment on (allegorical) wolves  that there are no (literal) wolves in England follows a passage in Turner’s  The Hunting of the Romish Wolf (Hume, Edmund Spenser, 21–23; Stein,  “Spenser and Turner,” 350–51; Norbrook, Poetry and Politics, 66–67). Additionally, at least some readers of Spenser’s Mother Hubberds Tale  in 1591 would come to the text with the knowledge that William Cecil,  Lord Burghley, was nicknamed “the fox” by his enemies. Anthony Petti  cites numerous examples of references to Burghley as a fox, though  Petti is sometimes unclear about whether such references pre- or post- date Spenser’s poem. Within the circle of the court, Robert Devereux,  Second Earl of Essex, commonly referred to Burghley as “the old fox”;  Petti also finds fox imagery applied to Burghley by a (relative) outsider in  a mid-1570s letter written by a Catholic that included a key to the letter’s  animal-themed cipher beginning: “The names of our enemies. The hare,  the ladie Elizabeth that calleth herself queene; the foxe, Cicill” (qtd. in  Petti, “Beasts,” 79). Although Thomas Herron has complicated our under- standing of the topical references in Spenser’s satire by reminding us of  the need to consider Irish readings and identifications of the Fox and  other characters, for the English audience analyzed here, fox imagery   3 Janice Devereux notes that in addition to William Turner, Luke Shepherd and John Bale  also referred to their enemy, the Catholic Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, as a  fox in the mid-sixteenth century (Devereux, An Edition, 121n182). </page> <page sequence="9"> Indirect satire 19 strongly represents Lord Burghley (Herron, “Reforming the fox”). Spenser reinforces the reader’s awareness of the Burghleyan fox  connection in Mother Hubberds Tale by making an even clearer attack  on Burghley in The Ruines of Time, the poem that opens the Complaints  collection. Elegizing Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, Spenser writes:  “He now is gone, the whiles the Foxe is crept / Into the hole, the which  the Badger swept” (Ruines, lines 216–17). The belief that foxes usurped  the dens of badgers, claiming a badger’s clean (“swept”) den by marking  it with urine and excrement, was part of English understanding of the  natural history of real foxes (see, e.g., Topsell, Historie, 34, 223). Calling  to the reader’s mind Burghley (whose political ascendancy following  Leicester’s death makes him the obvious referent for the fox) while also  reminding Elizabethans of the disgust attached to the actual animal makes  this a stinging insult. Bruce Danner argues that Ruines of Time creates  more offense than Mother Hubberds Tale, because “the Ruines criticizes  Cecil without the mediating fiction of an allegorical beast fable... . Such  remarks constitute a level of specificity beyond even the suggestive, but  allegorically inflected allusions to Burghley and Robert Cecil in Mother  Hubberds Tale” (Danner, Edmund Spenser’s War, 92–93). All of these symbolic foxes—the Aesopian/Reynardian political fox,  the ecclesiastical pastoral fox, the Burghleyan fox—inform Spenser’s char- acter of the Fox in Mother Hubberds Tale. Lauren Silberman observes that  Spenser does not characterize the Fox and Ape as static figures; instead,  “the way in which they are presented shifts along the continuum from  naturalistic to anthropomorphic—from the pole of ‘mouse’ to the pole  of ‘Mickey,’ if you will” (Silberman, “Aesopian,” 228). In part, as regards  the Fox, these shifts in characterization occur when Spenser moves to  another symbolic context for the meaning he wishes to convey through  this figure. The first two episodes play with the conventions of pastoral  ecclesiastical satire: as literal shepherds of actual sheep (the Ape disguised  as a “shepheard swaine” and “the false Foxe [as] his dog” [Spenser, Mother  Hubberds Tale, lines 303–4]), they devour their charges mercilessly, just  as allegorical wolf- and fox-pastors do in ecclesiastical pastorals such as  those by Turner and those in The Shepheardes Calender. As always, the  Fox serves as the instigator and is thus more guilty than the Ape:          [E]ver as they bred, They slue them, and upon their fleshes fed: For that disguised Dog lov’d blood to spill, And drew the wicked Shepheard to his will.  (Spenser, Mother Hubberds Tale, lines 317–20) </page> <page sequence="10"> 20 Spenserian satire In the next episode, however, when they infiltrate the clergy, with the  Fox as priest and the Ape as his parish clerk, they shift, to use Silberman’s  analogy, from “mouse” to “Mickey,” because their crimes as clergy are not  the allegorical devouring of sheep, which they have already done liter- ally in the first episode, but everyday corruptions: they “ill / Did order  their affaires” and were accused by their parishioners of unnamed “crimes  and heresies” (lines 559–60, 564). Both episodes draw on native English  traditions of polemic and complaint, with the first episode perhaps more  indebted to the polemics of rural laborers and poverty that draw on the  Piers Plowman tradition, as analyzed by Mike Rodman Jones (Radical  Pastoral). They are linked by their preoccupation with ordinary people,  as opposed to courtiers, and by the clever twist of having the Fox and Ape  perform their crimes of bloodthirsty rapine as actual shepherds, immedi- ately before their turn as clergy members. The rural ecclesiastical satire of the first two episodes then shifts to  court satire for the final two episodes: the Ape as courtier, with the Fox  as “his man Reynold” who “Supports his credite and his countenaunce”  (lines 667, 668), and the Ape as usurper-king, on the condition that he will  swear to be “ruled ... / In all affaires” by the Fox (lines 1051–52). Where the  first two episodes, in line with the fox symbolism of ecclesiastical pastoral  satire, characterized the Fox with reference to his bloodthirstiness (first  episode) and lack of care for parishioners (second episode), the literary  context now changes to the courtly satire reminiscent of the Reynard tales,  especially in the third episode, and political satire akin to the Aesopian  tradition in the fourth episode, which is generally recognized as having the  most direct topical applications but also the most careful efforts at creating  “Aesopian political deniability” (Silberman, “Aesopian,” 242). As van den  Berg summarizes the fourth episode: “on the one hand, it retreats from the  human world to the animal kingdom; on the other, it engages the human  world more directly through sustained topical allusions to actual persons  and specific abuses” (“Counterfeit,” 92). We see this continued concern  with the lines between human and animal in the Ape and Fox’s argument  over which should act as the king, when the Fox says:   where ye claime your selfe for outward shape  Most like a man, Man is not like an Ape In his chiefe parts, that is, in wit and spirite; But I therein most like to him doo merite For my slie wyles and subtill craftinesse, The title of the Kingdome to possesse.  (lines 1041–46) </page> <page sequence="11"> Indirect satire 21 The courtly and royal contexts of these final two episodes are too  obvious to require proof, and I believe that the Fox’s character becomes  inflected here with a slightly different meaning because of the connec- tion to courtly, political beast satire associated with the Reynardian and  Aesopian tales. Significantly, it is also in these final episodes that the connections  linking the Fox with William Cecil, Lord Burghley, come into play. In  Mother Hubberds Tale, although the Fox shows his corruption throughout  the poem, he becomes most similar to Lord Burghley in the fourth  episode, in which the Ape impersonates the king and the Fox serves as  his second-in-command. Here Spenser moves beyond allusion (to earlier  literary foxes and perhaps to fox references to Burghley) and symbolism  (from the disgust attached to foxes from popular natural histories as  exemplified by Edward Topsell) to create satirical meanings by means  of analogous situations. The narration of the Fox’s crimes allegorizes  the litany of complaints leveled against Burghley: he is greedy (nothing  “that might him profit bring, / But he the same did to his purpose wring”  [lines 1141–42]); he wields disproportionate influence with the monarch  (“Nought suffered he the Ape to give or graunt, / But through his hand  must passe the Fiaunt” [lines 1143–44]); he does not support learning  and the arts (“For men of learning little he esteemed; / His wisedome  he above their learning deemed” [lines 1191–92]); and his ostentatious  building projects show his pride and selfishness (“But his owne trea- sure he encreased more / And lifted up his loftie towres thereby” [lines  1171–72]).4 Bruce Danner notes that the Fox’s building program is out of  place: it “plays no previous or subsequent role in the poem,” and so, he  suggests, “Its function ... seems calculated to draw attention beyond the  formal boundaries of the narrative to the arena of contemporary refer- ence” (Danner, Edmund Spenser’s War, 164). Early readers recognized mockery of Robert Cecil’s hunchback in the  reference to the Fox’s cubs, whose “backs nigh broken were” from the  weight of all the honors and offices he heaped upon them (line 1158), a  passage Catholic polemicist Richard Verstegan alludes to by mentioning  “the false fox and his crooked cubs” in his attack on Burghley (Verstegan,  A Declaration, 68). Danner has carefully catalogued the numerous  contemporary identifications of the Fox with Burghley, noting that  these consistent identifications constitute “nothing less than the most  thoroughly documented topical allusion of Spenser’s career” (Danner,   4 See Danner, Edmund Spenser’s War, chapter 5, for a thorough analysis of the historical  context of Burghley’s building projects. </page> <page sequence="12"> 22 Spenserian satire Edmund Spenser’s War, 163). Although we can thus with some certainty  identify the Fox as Burghley, we nevertheless do not know the source  of Spenser’s animus against him; Andrew Hadfield outlines a number of  possibilities before concluding that “we shall probably never know for  certain why Spenser singled out Burghley as the representative of all that  was wrong with court life” (Hadfield, A Life, 275). Certainly the volume  as a whole indicates Spenser’s confidence and willingness to provoke  controversy, as Hadfield notes. The social dynamics of satire  Whereas the many criticisms of the Fox quoted in the previous section  certainly applied to Burghley, the Fox’s building projects, in their speci- ficity and lack of connection to the plot—similar to the reference to his  “cubs” that marks him as a parent—lead the reader to look outside the  text for meaning, that is, to think allegorically by looking for parallels  in the real world to explain something unusual or out of place in the  fictional world. This, I argue, is what makes indirect satire, as practiced  by Spenser and others who imitated him, distinctive: the greater c ognitive  demands it makes of the reader. When the writer places in the text only  clues to satirical meaning—allusions, symbols, and analogies that prompt  the reader to use prior knowledge, outside knowledge, to read allegori- cally to make sense of the text—the reader must interpret the clues to  arrive at the satirical meaning. The author thus increases personal safety,  but at cost to comprehensibility: some satirical meanings may go unno- ticed, and others may be found that the author never intended. This affects  the reception of the text both at the time of composition and in later  centuries, as critics struggle to interpret correctly satirical messages that  depend upon the knowledge and attitudes of the original target  audience. In making a distinction between “general,” “indirect,” and “direct” satire,  my goal is not to return to the somewhat rigid taxonomizing impulses  that characterized the study of Renaissance satire in the mid-twentieth  century. We can see new-critical interests at work in, for example, Alvin  Kernan’s ideas about the importance of the satiric persona, Mary Claire  Randolph’s two-part taxonomy of formal verse satire as attacking a vice  and endorsing the corresponding virtue, or John Peter’s dichotomized  association of complaint with the medieval period and satire with the  Renaissance (Kernan, Cankered Muse; Randolph, “The structural design”;  Peter, Complaint and Satire). In all of these examples, interest focuses  on the text, with attention to the persona of the speaker as found in the  </page> <page sequence="13"> Indirect satire 23 text. Discussions of prose vs. verse satire, “Juvenalian” vs. “Horatian”  vs. “Menippean” have continued to develop the new-critical taxonomic  impulse by focusing on form and tone.  Instead of adding a new type of taxonomy, I want to bring to the study  of Renaissance literature more recent satire theorists’ approaches, which,  taken together, constitute what we might call a “social turn” in satire  studies, expressed most succinctly in W. Scott Blanchard’s definition of  satire as a “genre for the expression of social dissensus” (“Renaissance  prose satire,” 118). The decision to write general or indirect or direct  satire—and these should be conceptualized as a continuum, not a set  of discrete quantum levels—arises in part from concerns related to the  social sphere: 1. The actual specificity of the real-world target: Does the author  genuinely want to criticize a large group of people, such as “court- iers,” or one specific courtier, such as the Earl of Oxford? 2. The potential social costs of directly attacking the target, ranging  from social awkwardness to difficulty getting published to impris- onment or execution. 3. The ability of the anticipated audience to piece together satirical  meanings from indirect clues: the audience will be more able to  make these cognitive leaps if author and audience share extensive  background knowledge. This way of thinking about satire as a social practice draws from and  adds nuance to the work of numerous critics who have considered the  social dimension of satire. Fredric Bogel describes satire’s social function  as exclusion: creating and policing boundaries between the in-group and  the outsider (Bogel, Difference Satire Makes). George A. Test explains the  multiplicity of satirical forms as deriving from the limitless possibilities  created by theorizing satire as exhibiting greater or lesser degrees of four  traits that work together to create satire: aggression, judgment, laughter,  and play (Test, Satire)—characteristics not so much formal or historical  as social: aggression toward, judgment on, laughter at, play with. Test’s  illustrations of these social relations in various examples of satire tend  to emphasize the connections between author and subject, leaving the  reader in a somewhat more passive role. Dustin Griffin balances this view  by arguing that inquiry, specifically the shared inquiry into a subject by  writer and reader, characterizes satire at its most morally complex and  interesting (Griffin, Satire). To the extent that interpreting indirect satire  depends upon reading allegorically to connect the text to the pretext or  </page> <page sequence="14"> 24 Spenserian satire context, I draw also from Maureen Quilligan’s careful analysis of the role  of the reader in making sense of allegorical writing (The Language of Alle- gory, chapter 4).  The distinction I make between direct and indirect satire continues  this emphasis on the social experience of reading or writing satire, specif- ically with respect to the making of meaning. Many of the theoretical  comments on satire refer to and analyze what I am calling “direct satire,”  which we now call simply “satire,” because greater freedom of expression  in Western democracies since the late seventeenth century has dimin- ished authors’ need for a toolbox of indirect satirical methods. Indirect  satire flourishes under repressive conditions, complicating comments  such as Ralph Rosen’s discussion of ancient satire, in which he asserts  “the antagonism itself is always explicit, for it is in the poet’s interest to  clarify who is the blamer and who the target” (Making Mockery, 19).  This tendency to consider only direct satire in analyses of “satire” also  plays a role in the idea that satire must be funny; Rosen again: “it must  be said, at the risk of stating the obvious, that I understand satire as a  species of comedy, or more generally ‘the comic’ ... it exists in order to  make an audience laugh” (19). Of course satire can be funny, but satire  is not the same as comedy any more than satire is the same as pastoral.  Using George Test’s taxonomy, we could say that Rosen is describing a  type of satire strong on aggression and laughter, whereas indirect satire  is stronger on Test’s judgment and play. Thinking of satire as aggressive  and laughter-provoking works well for examples of early modern English  direct satire such as the tracts of the pseudonymous Martin Marprelate,  which attacked particular English bishops by name, referred to specific  foibles and embarrassing incidents, and mocked both; Thomas Nashe’s  satirical abuse of Gabriel Harvey and his brothers; the Catholic apologist  Richard Verstegan’s attacks on William Cecil, Lord Burghley; and the sort  of personal libels collected by Alastair Bellany and Andrew McRae on  their “Early Stuart Libels” website. These four examples of direct, naming-names satire in the late Eliza- bethan and early Stuart period provide a useful primer on the dangers  of direct satire at this time of heavy censorship:5 The Marprelate tracts,  unregistered with the Stationers’ Company and printed on a secret press,  led to a manhunt, a public-relations war, and the execution of John  Penry (Black, “Introduction”). The Bishops’ Ban of 1599, which primarily   5 For general studies of press censorship during this period, see Clegg, Press Censor- ship Elizabethan; Clegg, Press Censorship Jacobean; Dutton, Licensing, Censorship; and  Patterson, Censorship and Interpretation.  </page> <page sequence="15"> Indirect satire 25 singled out specific, named works, made a blanket condemnation of the  whole Nashe–Harvey controversy by decreeing “That all nasshes bookes  and D Harvyes bookes be taken wheresoever they maye be found and  that none of theire bookes bee ever printed hereafter” (qtd. in McCabe,  “Elizabethan satire,” 188). Verstegan’s books were printed on the Conti- nent and smuggled into England, and the libels collected by Bellany and  McRae remained unpublished and circulated in manuscript. In sum,  then, three of these four examples constitute what McRae terms “unau- thorized texts” (McRae, Literature, Satire, 1), and the authorized texts of  the Nashe–Harvey squabble later became censored texts. We can easily understand the rage of the Elizabethan bishops at  the ridicule dished out by the witty and irreverent Martin family (the  pseudonymous Martin Marprelate turned out to have two sons, Martin  Junior and Martin Senior), though we might consider the bishops’  murderous response somewhat lacking in moderation. No one needs to  write an article explaining why the Elizabethan bishops took offense at  the Marprelate tracts; I will provide a single example, a syllogism from  the Epistle, remarkable for the sheer number of bishops that it insults  directly: “Those that are petty popes and petty antichrists ought not to  be maintained in any Christian commonwealth. But every lord bishop in  England, as, for ilsample, John of Cant., John of London, John Exeter, John  Rochester, Thomas of Winchester, the bishops of Lincoln, of Worcester,  of Peterborough, and to be brief, all the bishops in England, Wales, and  Ireland, are petty popes and petty antichrists. Therefore no lord bishop  ... is to be tolerated in any Christian commonwealth” (Marprelate, The  Epistle, 9). It requires no great critical acumen to recognize why a bishop  in the Church of England at the end of the sixteenth century would prefer  not to be named as a petty pope and Antichrist. In direct satires such  as these, plenty of interpretive issues and problems remain, of course,  but the reader does not wonder whom the author is criticizing, even at a  remove of more than four hundred years.  Other censorship episodes, however, offer less clarity. In the case of  the 1591 “calling in” of Spenser’s Complaints volume, scholars treated the  censorship as an unconfirmed rumor until 1997, when Richard Peterson  published a newly found letter from Sir Thomas Tresham written in  March 1591 (new style) during the actual recall of the book. Although  everyone could agree about why Lord Burghley would want the book  censored, the lack of proof that the book had indeed been suppressed led  to scholarly caution and uncertainty. Harold Stein, for example, specu- lated from the lack of an official proclamation regarding the calling in that  </page> <page sequence="16"> 26 Spenserian satire the authorities used “semi-official pressure” to get Spenser’s publisher,  William Ponsonby, to impound the unsold copies himself (Stein, Studies,  85). Cyndia Clegg, presumably partly because she bases her argument on  the belief that critics have overstated the extent of literary censorship in  the Elizabethan period, treats the censorship of Complaints as a minor  event, despite Peterson’s proof by the time of Clegg’s publication that  the book was called in. Clegg dismisses the seriousness of the event by  commenting that “whatever concern Spenser’s tale elicited, it was miti- gated shortly after” (Clegg, Press Censorship Elizabethan, 223). Likewise, scholars have not been able to determine with certainty  against what offense or offenses the Bishops’ Ban reacted, leading to  interpretive proliferation over the past decades. Those arguing for moral  motivations for the ban include John Peter (Complaint and Satire, 149),  Bruce R. Smith (Homosexual Desire, 164), and Lynda E. Boose (“Bishop’s  Ban,” 196). Arguments for political causes for the ban appear in works by  Richard McCabe (“Elizabethan satire”), Annabel Patterson (Censorship  and Interpretation, 47), and Cyndia Clegg (Press Censorship Elizabethan,  198–217). Given the generic diversity of the texts included in the ban,  recent critics have looked for overarching themes that can help to explain  the collective offensiveness of the named works. According to Douglas  Bruster, the named works’ “embodied writing” offended because they  “took liberties with bodies considered either above mention or above  certain kinds of mention” (“Structural transformation,” 50, 53). William  Jones also avoids genre-based interpretations by arguing that the ban  attempted to address a concern about ideology, specifically the Juvena- lian mode as “a tangible threat to the ideological stability of the English  nation” (“Bishops’ Ban,” 332). If we think in social rather than taxonomic  terms, it becomes less important to find a common thread connecting all  of these named works. The books were banned not because they outraged  the public, and not because they outraged one bishop who created the  entire list. Rather, we likely see here a collection of personal prejudices,  but because they are the personal prejudices of a group of bishops, rather  than a single bishop, we cannot find one common offense that each work  offers.  Both of these examples—uncertainty regarding the circumstances  surrounding the censorship of Spenser’s Complaints and uncertainty  about what inspired the confirmed censorship of the Bishops’ Ban—arise  from the slipperiness of indirect satire. It makes sense that the Elizabethan  authorities in charge of these suppressions would prefer to be as vague as  possible regarding their decisions: after all, by its nature, indirect satire is  </page> <page sequence="17"> Indirect satire 27 not readily comprehensible to every reader, so the suppressors would not  find it in their interest to help naïve readers to become knowing readers. Meaning-making in indirect satire: allusion, symbol, analogy,  and  the “allegorical intuition” In the previous section I noted that social considerations play a significant  role in an author’s decision to write indirect satire instead of more general  or more direct satirical works and discussed the specificity of the target  and the potential social costs of writing more direct satire. This section  will analyze the greater interpretive burden that indirect satire puts on the  reader. For any instance of indirect literary meaning-making to succeed,  the writer and the reader must share a common store of knowledge, or  else the reader will not be able to make the appropriate connections in  order to perceive the intended meanings. Brenda Machosky, in a discus- sion of allegory, claims that “all acts of interpretation are metaphoric in  principle, substituting meaning for the literary text. (Hence Northrop  Frye’s famous comment in The Anatomy of Criticism that ‘all commentary  is allegorical interpretation’ [89].)” (Structures of Appearing, 191). Machosky conflates metaphor and allegory in this quotation, but  teasing the two apart is important because of its implications for seeing  the process of understanding indirect satire as allegorical interpretation,  not metaphoric. Cognitive metaphor theorists define metaphor as the  mapping of ideas and images from one conceptual domain (the “source  domain”) on to another (the “target domain”), so that the unknown or  less known can be understood through comparison with a more familiar  domain of meaning (Lakoff and Johnson, Metaphors). Whereas I.A. Rich- ards’s highly influential discussions of metaphor tend to oversimplify the  process of communication and meaning-making (for example, in the  suggestion that the “tenor” or message is uncomplicatedly transported  by the “vehicle,” creating a conceptual barrier between meaning and  expression that underestimates the complexity of the processes of both  writing and reading), contemporary cognitive metaphor theorists postu- late more fluid boundaries between the source and target domains, such  that meaning flows, at least potentially, in both directions.  In several articles extending the work of cognitive metaphor theo- rists to allegory, Peter Crisp argues that we can distinguish allegory from  extended metaphor because allegory includes no direct references to  the target domain (i.e., the meaning or world “out there” that allegorical  figures and events represent); according to Crisp, whereas an extended  </page> <page sequence="18"> 28 Spenserian satire metaphor will bring together linguistic details reminiscent of both the  source and the target domains, allegory creates a self-contained world:  all source domain, with perhaps an allusion to the target domain in the  form of personifications (“Allegory, blending”). I find Crisp’s argument  for the distinction between extended metaphor and allegory compelling,  even though I disagree with him about the cognition involved in making  sense of allegory. The human mind’s ability to make sense of allegory— to correctly identify, say, the real-world satirical target of a short poem  that does not mention the person by name—depends, according to Mark  Turner, on three “principles of mind,” story, projection, and parable,  that allow us to make sense not only of literature but also of reality, with  “story” organizing our thinking, “projection” describing how “one story  helps us make sense of another,” and “parable” being “the projection of  one story onto another” (Turner, Literary Mind, v). Turner’s “parable” uncontroversially names what we mean when we  speak of allegorical interpretation, but, especially when a satirist aims at  self-protection by writing allegorically, how does the reader know what to  project? What hints create the allegorical intuition that prompts further  reflection, leading to appropriate projection? Crisp repeatedly notes that  allegory makes no “direct” reference to the target domain, but he leaves  unexplored the ways that allegory makes indirect reference to the target  domain, and this indirection in the creation of meaning is what makes  indirect satire possible. I will discuss three ways that an author can indi- rectly refer to the target domain, providing clues to spur allegorical inter- pretation: allusion, symbol, and analogy. By “allusion,” I refer to a primarily verbal or naming reference that  points the reader outside the text. Theorists of allusion have focused, not  surprisingly, on literary allusion, but I extend their work here to historical  allusion, given that such allusions are of primary interest when consid- ering indirect satire; we can extend these theorists’ comments about the  relationship that develops between two (literary) texts to the relationship  that develops in the reader’s mind between the text and the historical situ- ation to which it alludes. Ziva Ben-Porat, for example, asserts that “the  literary allusion is a device for the simultaneous activation of two texts,”  leading to “the formation of intertextual patterns whose nature cannot  be predetermined” (Ben-Porat, “Poetics,” 107–8). For Ben-Porat, then,  the desired “end product” of allusion—those “intertextual patterns”— exists not in either text but in the reader’s mind. Allan Pasco uses the  botanical metaphor of grafting, in which “the grafted cutting becomes  an integral part of the new stock,” to define allusion as existing in this  </page> <page sequence="19"> Indirect satire 29 between-texts space: “Neither the reference nor the referent, it consists  in the image produced by the metaphoric combination that occurs in the  reader’s mind” (Pasco, Allusion, 12). Thus, the reader plays a key role in  piecing together the full meaning of an allusion. In Spenserian satire, we  find satirical allusions most notably in The Shepheardes Calender, where  anagrams or nicknames (e.g., Morrell for Aylmer) serve to clue the reader  to the allegorization of historical personages. When I refer to “symbol” as a way of pointing the reader of an indi- rect satire outside the text to prompt allegorical interpretation, I speak of  the complex of an object or image and the set of visual and conceptual  meanings that attach to it within a particular culture. (Note that I believe  Coleridge’s distinction between symbol and allegory, in which symbol  is natural and allegory is arbitrary, has clouded discussion for too long,  so I will simply state that I use both terms here to refer to processes of  meaning-making that depend on social construction and communal  understandings shared by members of a culture.) In The Faerie Queene  (2.4.4), the forelock of the figure eventually identified (allusively, several  stanzas later) as Occasion served within the culture as a symbol of Occa- sion or Opportunity, generally represented in contemporary emblem  books as positive opportunities. Spenser alters this symbolic meaning by  combining it with the negative associations that his culture attached to  ugliness and age, so that the hag becomes an appropriate personification  of the occasion to wrath. I view personification, then, not as a separate  figure of indirection in satirical or allegorical meaning but as a way of  pointing to the target domain that relies on a combination of allusion and  symbol; Spenser is well known for ekphrastically developing the symbolic  signification of a personification before he clarifies the figure’s identity by  allusion to the abstract quality that it represents. What I am calling “analogy” or “analogous situations” in this book  represent the most indirect of the indirect methods of signaling satir- ical meaning. Whereas all satirical meaning-making in allegorical satire  depends upon Turner’s principle of mind “parable,” with analogy, the  reader’s only clue or connection to the real-world target space of the  satire’s critique comes from the plot or narrative’s similarity to some real- world situation that the reader already knows about. Spenser uses analogy  extensively in the satirical episodes in Faerie Queene, especially Book 5’s  trial of Duessa, the Burbon episode, and the Belge episode. But in these  cases, Spenser supplements the use of analogy with allusion and symbol.  When there is high potential for censorship or punishment, however,  creating indirect satire strictly through analogous narratives offers the  </page> <page sequence="20"> 30 Spenserian satire greatest amount of deniability, and we see Spenser relying on this method  in the fourth episode of Mother Hubberds Tale.  As I already noted, from the time of its publication in the Complaints  volume in 1591, readers connected the Fox in Mother Hubberds Tale with  William Cecil, Lord Burghley. By making his main villain a fox, Spenser  alluded to Burghley, who was referred to as a fox before 1591. But not  everyone knew that Burghley was connected to foxes; readers who were  naïve with regard to the allusion to a nickname for Burghley would  perhaps catch the allusions to earlier literary traditions of prosopopoietic  foxes, and even readers not well read in those literary works would still  know the folk culture’s natural-historical ideas about foxes as dirty and  wily, so that this symbolism would attach to a fox character as well. Yet these allusions and symbolism alone might not have been enough  to render the setting of Mother Hubberds Tale no longer a fictional beast- fable world, but a world suggesting clear parallels with the real world of  sixteenth-century England. The situations in the fourth episode that are  clearly analogous to situations in Spenser’s England—an advisor to the  monarch who shows favoritism toward his sons is greedy, holds plural  offices, undertakes elaborate building projects, and controls access to the  monarch—illustrated common complaints about Burghley with suffi- cient detail to help readers, primed by the genre of beast fable to look for  connections, to make the identification. Despite the wealth of allusions,  symbolism, and analogies, the satire is indirect, in the sense that Spenser  does not use Burghley’s name or official titles, but Burghley—presumably  the “Superior awthoritie” referred to in 1591 by Sir Thomas Tresham who  took the poem “in suche earnest” that he “called in” the entire collection  in which the poem appeared—must have seen Spenser’s poem as entirely  too explicit a way of referring (Peterson, “Laurel crown,” 7). Bruce Danner’s chapter on Mother Hubberds Tale illustrates the impor- tance of small details; Danner contextualizes Spenser’s references to the  Fox’s grand building projects as chief advisor to the Ape as false king (that  is, the reference to “loftie towres” quoted above) by exploring the similari- ties to Burghley’s excessive and expensive work at his estate Theobalds,  and he notes that the Fox’s building work does not connect to the rest of  the narrative. The strangeness of the incongruous detail invites readers to  consider real-world applications and satirical meanings. Writing of Aeso- pian discourse in England, Annabel Patterson comments that “The fable  gives up its goods more generously when its details are recognized as spec- ifying, not generalizing; and those details, in turn, constitute an unusual  and untapped archive for the early history of political and social thought”  </page> <page sequence="21"> Indirect satire 31 (Patterson, Fables, 43). Essentially, this is my method in excavating satir- ical meanings from the four-hundred-year-old poems I examine in this  book: I look for strange details, words or images that don’t quite fit or that  introduce a remarkable degree of specificity into a passage—these are one  form of what Annabel Patterson elsewhere calls “entry codes”: textual  material that serves to flag the presence of hidden satirical meaning  (Patterson, Censorship and Interpretation). I then examine those small  details to ascertain in what ways they may function as entry codes that  create allegorical connections between the fictional world in the text and  the real world of the writer and reader. I am especially interested in the  ways that other authors used Spenser as source and inspiration for their  own satirical poetry. Just as, for example, Spenser alludes to and adapts  to his own purposes a number of different textual, generic, and cultural  versions of the fox in creating his own Reynold the Fox, authors devel- oping the indirect, Spenserian form of satire in the 1590s and beyond  often use Spenserian allusions to function as entry codes, so that Spenser  provides for such authors both satirical tools and a satirical tradition to  link to through allusion.  A portrait of the artist as a satirist Scholars have paid a great deal of attention to Spenser’s satirical poetry,  but in a fairly piecemeal and atomistic fashion, looking at individual texts  or, in the case of The Faerie Queene, individual moments of satirical tone  or meaning within the epic. The rest of this book will demonstrate this  same sort of local-level attention to particular texts, with close attention  to Shepheardes Calender and Daphnaïda in the next chapter, followed by  close readings of the satirical inspiration provided to other authors by  specific Spenserian texts. However, because the purpose of this whole  book is to convey a sense of story—the story of Spenser as a satirist  working within and responding to a print culture ever under the threat  of possible censorship, and the story of how that story of Spenser as prin- cipled poet speaking truth to power inspired and influenced other poets  in the 1590s and early seventeenth century—I want to create a narrative  of “satirical Spenser,” a storyline connecting key events in Spenser’s career  in which he adopted a more satirical stance in his poetry.  I do not wish to argue, or at least not to argue strenuously, against  comments such as Richard Helgerson’s that Spenser “studiously avoided”  presenting himself as a satirist, keeping Colin Clout out of the satirical  eclogues in Shepheardes Calender and dissociating himself as poet from  </page> <page sequence="22"> 32 Spenserian satire Mother Hubberds Tale (Helgerson, Self-Crowned Laureates, 85n37). Helg- erson’s and Patrick Cheney’s (Spenser’s Famous Flight) persuasive analyses  of Spenser’s self-fashioning as a poet, the ways that he presented individual  works as part of a career, prioritize individual, self-consciously canonical  works in ways that seem to me to fit with Spenser’s own stated goals as a  poet. Still ... by naming his poetic alter ego “Colin Clout”—even if he does  then send Colin to an undisclosed location when it is time for a satirical  eclogue—Spenser already alludes to satirical poetry by referencing John  Skelton’s most famous poetic narrator, as I will discuss in the next chapter.  Although Spenser does not proclaim himself a satirist, or self-consciously  link a series of satirical works into an oeuvre or career, he demonstrates a  consistent, sustained interest in using his poetry to comment on and crit- icize the real world. This desire to make poetry matter, coupled with an  equally strong desire to avoid punishment or censorship, leads to several  discrete episodes in which we see Spenser trying to negotiate the bound- aries governing licit poetic meddling in affairs, trying to find “the line”  but not cross it, with greater or lesser success. In The Shepheardes Calender, Spenser obviously succeeded, fabulously,  in creating a work that would position him as the premier poet writing  in English, a key work whose importance scholars analyzing Spenser’s  career universally recognize (e.g., Helgerson; Cheney; Rambuss, Spens- er’s Secret). And yet we don’t know to what extent Spenser achieved his  additional goal of criticizing specific abuses in England: he may have  been satisfied that enough people, or the right people, sufficiently under- stood his indirect satirical critiques. Algrind’s identity as Bishop Grindal,  Morrell’s as Bishop Aylmer, the bald-faced reference to Lettice Knollys,  the wife of the Earl of Leicester, as “Lettice”—the ways that these and other  allusions place Spenser as a firm Protestant and as connected with the  Leicester circle have been well rehearsed, including book-length studies  such as Paul McLane’s sometimes too-ingenious allegorical readings in  Spenser’s Shepheardes Calender: A Study in Elizabethan Allegory and the  more cautious readings advanced in Robert Lane’s Shepheards Devises. But did enough readers even at the time of publication understand,  say, the story of Roffy and Lowder in the “September” eclogue, an alle- gorization of some event now utterly lost to us? We can recognize this  episode as an instance of indirect satire by perceiving two allusive names,  Roffy and Lowder. We know that Roffy refers to John Young, Bishop of  Rochester and Spenser’s employer at the time of composition, but we  don’t know to what person the name Lowder alludes, and although we  presume that the plot was recognizable to knowing readers as an analogue  </page> <page sequence="23"> Indirect satire 33 of real-world events, we are unable to connect the analogue to any event  we know of. Our ignorance, however, does not mean that “September”  should be considered general satire—it doesn’t make sense as general  satire that can be understood by a general audience. The episode requires  a knowledgeable audience; it is undeniably indirect satire, but we cannot  understand it and probably never will. Spenser makes so much of the secrets contained in his book through  E.K.’s repeated references to secrets (e.g., the author’s “labouring to  conceale” “the generall dryft and purpose” of the work, the “few” things  “whose speciall purpose and meaning I am not privie to,” and numerous  references within the notes [Spenser, Shepheardes, 19, 23; see Rambuss,  Spenser’s Secret, chapter 2]—did his contemporaries “get” enough of them?  Or did Spenser wish for a fuller appreciation of his work as social criti- cism? William Webbe wrote a great deal about the Calender in his 1586  A Discourse of English Poetry, but he is willfully vague about the extent to  which he himself succeeded in understanding the hidden secrets; instead,  he focuses on some of the most general, banal messages a reader might  take away from the collection, mentioning only briefly the potential for  sharper critiques: The occasion of his worke is a warning to other young men, who being  intangled in loue and youthful vanities, may learne to looke to themselues  in time, and to auoyde inconueniences which may breede if they be not in  time preuented. Many good Morrall lessons are therein contained, as the  reuerence which young men owe to the aged in the second Eglogue:  the  caueate or warning to beware a subtill professor of freendshippe in the  fift Eglogue: the commendation of good Pastors, and shame and disprayse  of idle &amp; ambitious Goteheardes in the seauenth, the loose and retchlesse  lyuing of Popish Prelates in the ninth. The learned and sweete complaynt  of the contempt of learning vnder the name of Poetry in the tenth. There  is also much matter vttered somewhat couertly, especially ye  abuses of  some whom he would not be too playne withall: in which, though it be not  apparant to euery one, what hys speciall meaning was, yet so skilfully is it  handled, as any man may take much delight at hys learned conueyance, and  picke out much good sence in the most obscurest of it. (E4v–F1r) We know that the John Stubbs episode, which had nearly cost Spens- er’s publisher, John Singleton, his hand the month before publishing  Shepheardes Calender, might have induced Spenser to exercise extreme  caution. We know of no censorious objections or reactions to Shepheardes  Calender. We do not know, however, whether Spenser was satisfied with  the extent to which this volume of poetry allowed him to express his ideas  </page> <page sequence="24"> 34 Spenserian satire about and criticisms of the world around him. His choice of the poetic  alter ego Colin Clout, a name that in 1579 stood not for Spenser but for  the satirical poem by John Skelton, and the decision to title his work after  a book that, according to John Foxe in Acts and Monuments, had been  “accused &amp; detected” by Catholic persecutors of Protestants in the early  sixteenth century (both of which I will discuss more fully in Chapter 2),  suggest a greater commitment to poetic intervention into political and  religious matters than he received credit for at the time. At any rate, with  Shepheardes Calender, although we cannot know the extent to which  Spenser achieved his rhetorical goals related to satirical allegory and  critique, we do know that authorities did not judge that he had crossed  the line into actionably offensive work. Eleven years later, when Complaints was entered into the Stationers’  Register, Spenser had a very different status than did the “new poet,”  “Immerito,” at the time of The Shepheardes Calender. The success of that  venture and the publication of the first installment of The Faerie Queene  (1590) established Spenser as the premier English poet, and some have  thus found surprising the publication of Complaints, with its multiple  poems insulting to Burghley, in the following year. Scholars differ on  whether or not Spenser participated in the publication of the work, with  Jean Brink arguing that, because of the offensiveness of some of the poems,  Spenser must have intended for them to remain in manuscript (“Who  fashioned”). On the other side, Andrew Hadfield believes that the care  taken with presentation and the handsomeness of the volume support the  view that Spenser participated in and supported the publication process  (A Life, 273–74, 283–84), and I have argued elsewhere that the multiple  dedicatory materials included in the volume, especially to the Spencer  sisters, constitute a self-conscious bid for patronage and support at the  crucial moment in Spenser’s career when he was waiting for approval of  the pension he was ultimately to receive as reward for his labors on The  Faerie Queene (Hile, “Auto/biographical fantasies”).  Whether or not Spenser participated in the publication process for  this volume, his writing of poems such as The Ruines of Time and Proso- popoia; or, Mother Hubberds Tale indicates that he felt a great deal of  self-confidence (and perhaps also a great deal of self-righteous convic- tion that Burghley had responded unfairly to The Faerie Queene, as Bruce  Danner argues). We can speculate what impact Spenser hoped to achieve  with these poems, but we do not know whether he was surprised and  dismayed by the censorious government response or whether he relished  the knowledge that his barbs had bitten. At any rate, Spenser’s book was  </page> <page sequence="25"> Indirect satire 35 punished, but not his body, and the scandal died down quickly. Thomas  Tresham’s letter, dated “the xixth of Marche 1590” (i.e., 1591 new style),  describes the details of the contemporary scandal, with Spenser recently  having returned to Ireland, authorities trying to collect all copies of the  offending book, and booksellers profiting by selling the book at inflated  prices (Peterson, “Laurel crown”). In the following year, Gabriel Harvey  criticized Spenser for writing the work, because “Mother Hubbard, in heat  of choller, forgetting the pure sanguine of her sweete F[ae]ry Queene,  wilfully ouer-shott her malcontented selfe”; this work was entered in the  Stationers’ Register on December 4, 1592 (Harvey, Fovre Letters, 15). In  Thomas Nashe’s response to this criticism, he charges that “If any man  were vndeseruedly toucht in it, thou hast reuiued his disgrace that was  so toucht in it, by renaming it, when it was worn out of al mens mouths  and minds” (Nashe, Strange Newes, 282). This work was entered in the  Stationers’ Register January 12, 1592 (i.e., 1593 new style), and thus we  learn that the scandal, at least as it touched Spenser, was of relatively short  duration. However, whereas the gossip was short-lived, the impact on  Mother Hubberds Tale was not: Although the other Complaints poems  were republished without Mother Hubberds Tale in 1611, that poem was  not reprinted until 1612, following the death of Lord Burghley’s son  Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury (Lord Burghley having died in 1598).  This censorship episode certainly contributed to Spenser’s credibility  as a satirist to other poets in the 1590s, leading to other poets finding  satirical inspiration in such poems as “March” and Muiopotmos, as I  discuss in Chapter 4, in addition to beast fable and fox allusions more  commonly recognized. This image of Spenser as a principled poet who  was willing to take risks in order to express his ideas about the world  around him affected not only how other poets in the 1590s thought of and  responded to him, but also how Spenser thought of himself, and I believe  this sense of himself, coupled with the self-confidence derived from his  success as a poet, explains the presence of topical allegories, many with  the bite of satire, in the 1596 installment of The Faerie Queene, which  the 1590 books generally avoided. (The extended satirical critiques of the  Roman Catholic Church in Book 1 hardly qualify as dangerous satire [see  Waters, Duessa].)  Daphnaïda’s satire, which I will discuss in detail in the next chapter,  can be seen as intermediate, in that it was composed after the first install- ment of The Faerie Queene but before the censorship of Complaints  (Weiss, “Watermark”). As a private satire of an acquaintance, this work  presumably posed no real risk to Spenser, but his inventiveness in the  </page> <page sequence="26"> 36 Spenserian satire poem—using genre and readers’ generic expectations themselves to create  indirect satirical meanings—indicates a further step in Spenser’s develop- ment of the possibilities of indirect forms of satirical meaning-making.  Similarly, Spenser avoids major risks with the satirical moments in Colin  Clouts Come Home Againe, dedicated December 27, 1591, though not  published until 1595. The criticisms of court life in Colin Clouts Come  Home Againe, even though the court he targets clearly figures the English  one, are much more cautious than the preceding Complaints poems or  the 1596 Faerie Queene books. Continuing this speculation on Spenser as satirist, we can imagine  that, with the 1596 installment of The Faerie Queene, Spenser found  a balance between the caution of The Shepheardes Calender and the  rashness of Complaints, a balance that Aristotle might describe as true  courage. He intervenes into court politics with his allegorical defense of  Walter Raleigh against the displeasure of the Queen at his secret marriage.  He offers multiple opinions on European political and religious struggles  with his allegorizations of the situations in France and the Netherlands.  Most famously, he supports the justice of executing Mary, Queen of Scots,  by allegorizing her as Duessa and putting her on trial. This passage moti- vated King James VI of Scotland, who of course dearly hoped to become  King James I of England, to attempt to influence Elizabeth to punish,  not the book, but Spenser himself. A November 1596 letter from Robert  Bowes to Burghley states: The K[ing] hath conceaved of great offence against Edward [sic] Spencer  publishing in prynte in the second book p[ar]t of the Fairy Queene and ixth  chapter some dishonorable effects (as the k. demeth therof) against himself  and his mother deceassed ... he still desyreth that Edward Spencer for his  faulte, may be dewly tryed &amp; punished. (qtd. in Goldberg, James I, 1)6 Fortunately for Spenser, the queen declined to follow up on James’s request.  Spenser died just over two years later, so he was spared from finding out  if James was able to hold a grudge for as long as Burghley could, and we  missed out on the chance to learn how Spenser, fully mature as both a  poet and a satirist, would have responded to King James I of England. Yes, Spenser built his career in an arc leading to the highest poetic  genre, so that he could claim the status of an epic poet. Over the centu- ries, as he became a specimen for anthologies and survey courses, he  often became only an epic poet, or sometimes a pastoral poet as well. But   6 For additional discussion of this passage, see McCabe, “Masks,” for an analysis of James’s  response, and Ashworth-King, Ethics of Satire, chapter 3, for a discussion of its meaning  within the overall context of Spenser’s satirical meanings in the Mercilla episode. </page> <page sequence="27"> Indirect satire 37 in his time, and for his contemporaries, his inventive muse led him to a  larger array of genres, of experiments, of poetic stances, than he was to  be remembered for. His satirical works were an important part of who  he was, both for his contemporaries and for his own poetic self-image,  and although too much time has passed, and not enough documentation  exists, for us to understand fully everything that Spenser attempted to  say, or that his contemporaries heard, in his satirical poetry, this book  attempts to begin filling in some of the gaps in the story of Spenser as  satirist. </page> </plain_text>
