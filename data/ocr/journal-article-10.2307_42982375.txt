While previ- ously given independent treatments, the concepts of anthropocentrism, human- ism, speciesism, and carnism in this chapter will be differentiated and discussed as having mutually reinforced one another through constructing, legitimating, and reproducing a human-animal hierarchy and binary. As shall be argued, anthropocentrism, which has narcissistically privileged humans as the center of all significance, is not an innate disposition but a histori- cal outcome of a distorted humanism in which human freedom is founded upon the unfreedom of human and animal others. Nonetheless, the humanist aspira- tion to ground knowledge in reason through modern science has undermined the tenability of a human-animal binary and hierarchy, thus resulting in a critique of speciesist beliefs and institutions. Yet still, residue of anthropocentric thought is retained in the work of humanistic thinkers opposed to speciesism who take for granted the presuppositions of classical humanism. Critical Animal Theory (CAT) scholars, including posthumanists and femi- nists, reevaluate the significance of dependencies, emotions, and the specificity of animal being and agency. Further, they aim to dismantle the structures of speciesism at the politico-economic, sociocultural, and psychosomatic levels of existence. Of all the ways humans are subject to speciesism, carnism - the un- recognized ideology that legitimates the killability and edibility of animal oth-</page><page sequence="2">4 Adam Weitzenfeld and Melanie Joy ers - is arguably the deepest, most pervasive and catastrophic in modern West- ern cultures. Vegan praxis is one means of embodying CAT and challenging the hegemony of speciesist institutions and anthropocentrist ideology that keep the human-animal binary and hierarchy alive. Anthropocentrism, Humanism, and the Human-Animal Dualism: The Anthropocentric and Anthropocentrism Once upon a time, in some out of the way corner of that universe which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar systems, there was a star upon which clever beasts invented knowing. That was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of "world history," but nevertheless, it was only a minute . . . [Humans regard their intellect] so solemnly - as though the world s axis turned within it. But if we could communicate with the gnat, we would learn that he likewise flies through the air with the same solemnity, that he feels the flying center of the universe within himself. (Nietzsche, 2000, p. 53) For several millennia, humans - at least those of Western cultures - have assumed a staunch anthropocentric orientation, the effect of positioning humans as the center of meaning, value, knowledge, and action. While the character of the Wests anthropocentric orientation is very explicit, some degree of an anthropocentric orientation is inescapable simply by the fact that as humans, humans perceive the world within the limits of human bodies and cognition. Even if one absolutely rejects anthropocentrist ethics - in which "moral consideration is only properly granted to humans" - anthropocentric metaethics, "the view that [human] con- ceptions of morality are constrained to human perspectives and sensibilities," is a condition of any human moral system (DeLapp, 2008, p. 40). Anthropocentric orientations are thus not exclusive to cultures in which humans are classified as categorically distinct and superior to animal others. Many indigenous cultures, even those that celebrate human-animal hybrids and becomings, are also anthro- pocentric to varying degrees in privileging the value of (local) humans and the meanings and values they assign to all other animal life (Noske, 1997b). Anthropocentrism, on the other hand, is more than the consequence of privi- leging humans knowledge and values. Anthropocentrism is a belief system, an ideology of human supremacy that advocates privileging humans (and those who approximate humanity). Anthropocentrism, as an ideology, functions to main- tain the centrality and priority of human existence through marginalizing and subordinating nonhuman perspectives, interests, and beings. Anthropocentrism requires that a society have a concept of humanity, assign privileged value to it, and measure all other beings by this standard. Meaning and value are partial to the idea of humanity and not partial to certain human beings over others so long as they are not "less human" (i.e., subhuman). Further, anthropocentrism may</page><page sequence="3">An Overview of Anthropocentrism, Humanism, and Speciesism in Critical Animal Theory 5 assume a variety of forms such as a human-animal dualism or continuum. A human-animal dualism posits humans over and above all other animals, radically separated into two homogenous, opposing kinds. Alternatively, a human-animal continuum hierarchically ranks humans and animal others along a scale by the degree to which they are "human," with some human capacity - usually reason - privileged as the most essential and valuable (Ingold, 1994). Although the cultural hegemony of anthropocentric ideologies and institu- tions has been present for at least five thousand years - such as in creation stories and sacrificial rites whereby humans are ordained to have dominion over other creatures in the service of the divine - these stories and rites were grounded and centered in something beyond humans (i.e., deities) that were believed to have mediated and constrained human knowledge and action. Not until modernity would deities be widely regarded as antiquated justifications for humanity's rule, and humans could rule the world with no external constraints set by a nonhu- man actor (Bell, 201 1). Anthropocentrism, in its purest and most pervasive form, could only come into being with humanism - a belief system that defines human beings as ontologically free through a universally shared essence such as reason, and considers humans as the source of knowledge and value. Anthropocentrism is not the effect of inescapable, ahistorical constraints of human sensibilities, but rather it is a historic development born from specific institutional and philosophi- cal traditions. Anthropocentrist Humanism and the Human-Animal Dualism "Humanism," a term coined in the nineteenth century, contemporarily has a va- riety of definitions. With care, the term can be used anachronistically to charac- terize ideological and cultural movements from antiquity to modernity. The first precursors of humanistic thought in Europe were Ancient Greeks such as Pro- tagoras who famously proclaimed, "Man is the measure of all things." Humanism, however, was an unpopular belief system in Europe until interest in classical texts, pedagogy, and independent inquiry were renewed during the Italian Renaissance. During the eighteenth-century Age of Enlightenment, humanism reduced the religiosity of the Renaissance and broadened its project to the Utopian ambition of universal human progress through rational inquiry (i.e., the natural and human sciences), the démystification of the natural world, and the self-authorization of the nation state (i.e., democracy). The dominant tradition of humanist thought since the Enlightenment may be characterized as anthropocentrist humanism due to its ideological commit- ment to conceptualizing human being over and against animal being, and privi- leging human consciousness and freedom as the center, agent, and pinnacle of history and existence. The human-animal dualism and hierarchy of anthropocen- trist humanism is supported by at least three premises: human exceptionalism,</page><page sequence="4">6 Adam Weitzenfeld and Melanie Joy perfection, and dignity. First, human beings are defined by a capacity assumed to be exclusive to humans such as speech, reason, or consciousness itself. Second, hu- man consciousness is conceptualized as an individual and autonomous entity ca- pable of freethinking and thus also self-realization and self-determination. Third, all beings capable of self-determination possess dignity (i.e., intrinsic self-worth). Since only humans have the potential for self-determination due to their exclusive capacity for reasoning, human beings alone possess intrinsic value. In contrast to the self- and world-forming character of human being, all non- human beings are regarded as merely in the world, bound by natural law. As a result, nonhumans have no dignity to violate and, thus, are owed little to no di- rect moral consideration. Normally, nonhuman animals deserve basic welfare, but only indirectly. Gratuitous cruelty and excessive exploitation are not wrong be- cause of the effect they have on animals, but rather on humans (e.g., harm to the human whose companion was damaged, the development of an inhumane char- acter, the diminishment of the utility of resources). These conclusions lead to the attitude that nonhumans are bare nature upon which to exercise human freedom, to project human values, and actualize human potential. In other words, the aim- lessness of other species - in so far as they dont have aspirations that transcend and reform their existences - only achieves meaning instrumentally through hu- man consciousness. For humans to assert their species-being upon the world, to optimize natures utility for human interests, is not merely an option, but a historical destiny to be fulfilled (Linzey &amp; Clarke, 1990). The Ironies of Anthropocentrist Humanism: The Irrational Dualism and Inhumane Hierarchy Anthropocentrist humanisms dualism and hierarchy have "largely been seen, even by its opponents, as part of an ideology that has benefited human beings," writes Aaron Bell (2011); however, in reality, its latent contradictions "have manifested themselves in a violent and self-destructive manner, fatal both to human and non- human life" (p. 163). The violent manifestation of anthropocentrist humanism is due to at least two ironies. The first is anthropocentrist humanisms dogmatic, irrational adherence to human exceptionalism despite the empirical evidence of a continuum and multitude of species capabilities. The second is the inhumane history of exclusionary violence arising from the ranking, ordering, and molding of humankind. What is called dehumanization is made possible by defining the essence of humanity over and against all other animals. The human-animal binary and hierarchy has historically produced and may continue to reproduce a bloody margin of subhumans, thus contradicting humanisms premise of the universality of freedom and dignity. The most glaring irony of humanism is that the dogmatism of human ex- ceptionalism contradicts humanisms commitment to truth based in human ex-</page><page sequence="5">An Overview of Anthropocentrism, Humanism , and Speciesism in Critical Animal Theory 7 perience and empiricism. Shortly after anthropocentrism came into full force through humanism, it was immediately undermined by humanistic endeavors in modern science: the Copernican revolution, evolutionary theory, and psycho- analysis. Consciousness of these three discoveries - heliocentrism, humanity's de- scent from animals, and the unconscious - destroyed humanity's self-image as a purposeful creation at the center of the universe with the exceptional capacity of free will (Davis, 201 1). Without an ultimate meaning, and subject to unconscious processes, humanity could no longer have the same confidence in its God-given or self-directed dominion over being. While Western humans learned that they were not quite as "human" as they thought they were, they later (re)discovered that animal others were much more "human" than they gave them credit. In the last half century, the modern science that once had ideologically dismissed considering animal others as anything other than objects has generated a great many studies that conclude just how untenable human exceptionalism and the human-animal dichotomy is. Nonhumans from ants to apes demonstrate that capabilities that were previously - for a relatively short time by only a fraction of the people on Earth - thought to be exclusive to humans are actually shared with others: planning for a future, long-term memory, deception, a sense of fairness, abstract reasoning, tool use, material culture, ag- riculture, language use, self-recognition, and even a relationship with the dead (Noske, 1997a). For centuries, the belief that animal others possessed such capabilities was considered anthropomorphic, attributing the mental experiences and capabilities supposedly exclusive to humans to nonhuman others. However, contemporary scholars such as Franz de Waal characterize the stigmatization of anthropomor- phism as anthropodenial - "the willful blindness to the human-like characteris- tics of animals, or the animal-like characteristics of ourselves" (quoted in Weil, 2012, p. 45). The anthropocentrist commitments of some scholars, however, have prompted them not to concede these capabilities to animal others, but rather to redefine them, especially "language." As Stephen Clark writes, "It is not that we have discovered them to lack a language but rather that we define and redefine, what language is by discovering what beasts do not have" (quoted in Shapiro, 1990, p. 23). The boundary project of delimiting "the human" from "the animal" has been in a steady retreat since the 1970s and will in all likelihood continue to be so long as humans presuppose themselves as an exclusive class in which what is essential to and valuable about humanity is defined by what all animal others lack. The Anthropological Machine and Hegemonic Centrisms The anthropos in the anthropocentrism of humanism can never be purified of its own so-called animality without redrawing an ontological and ethico-political boundary that risks casting out members of the human species. Through what</page><page sequence="6">8 Adam Weitzenfeld and Melanie Joy Giorgio Agamben (2004) calls the "anthropological machine," each attempt to identify human being through its ontological difference from animal being results in an excision within human being itself as well as the production of an ethico- politically privileged inside and sacrificial outside. In other words, human being is not so much a value-neutral biological fact as a violent political fiction. The historic and fictitious human-animal dualism that is thought to protect the sover- eignty of humans is also ironically the very mechanism that legitimates their sac- rifice. What are believed to be the mutually exclusive moral categories of expend- able animalized lives (e.g., broiler hens) and sacred humanized lives is betrayed "by the furious line drawing at work in the hybrid designations" of the humanized animals (e.g., pets) exempt from slaughter and the animalized humans (e.g., pris- oners at Abu-Ghraib) exempted for it (Wolfe, 2003, p. 101). To this end, the anthropological machine commits at least four forms of vio- lence. First, the anthropological machine performs what Bell (201 1) calls an "auto- vivisection," the violence in the creation of a human-animal binary that alienates humans not only from themselves - their bodies, passions, and experiences - but also from fellow creatures who co-inhabit their world (p. 166). Second, homog- enizing all nonhuman sentient life under the term "animal" is a representational violence that negates the specificity and positive attributes of each being by defin- ing them generically through something "human" they all lack. This classification does not define animals on their own terms, but contingently on the desire of the human animal to exercise its power over them and recognize itself as special and superior (Derrida, 2008). Third, by abstracting the non-substitutable subjectiv- ity of "human" life from the anonymous facticity of bare life - a life reduced to mere biological persistence stripped of distinction and integrity - "animal" life becomes an object to be ordered, ranked, aggregated, and molded to economic and political ends. Fourth is the final material and political manifestation of the exclusionary and sacrificial logic of anthropocentrist humanism: the institutional- ization of the noncriminal management and destruction of animal life in the ser- vice of the state and economy risks extending into the management and sacrifice of the "animal life" of humans (e.g., Nazi Germany s eugenics and mass slaughter of humans) (Patterson, 2002). What is considered most definitely human in its uniqueness and its superior- ity is not objective, fixed, and universal. On the contrary, the concept of what we now call "the human" has been selectively, adaptively, and partially defined accord- ing to a particular form of embodiment and culture against others. The definition of humanity has been a reflection of a particular group of elite mens perception of themselves in opposition to those they ruled over and classified as their others: animals, women, foreigners, disabled people, and more. In ancient times, women and slaves were considered unfit to participate in the proto-humanist democracy in ancient Greece (duBoise, 1982). The development of natural/human rights in</page><page sequence="7">An Overview of Anthropocentrism, Humanism, and Speciesism in Critical Animal Theory 9 modern times fared litde better. According to Lynn Hunt (2007), "Claims about the natural equality of all mankind called forth equally global assertions about natural difference" that "inadvertently opened the door to more virulent forms of sexism, racism, and anti-Semi tism" (p. 187). Joseph Slaughter (2007) explains that while the fictitious creation of human rights "expresses certain laudable aspirations" of egalitarianism, "human rights" obscures its role in practices and discourses of inequality as it became a universal- ized common sense under liberal ideology (p. 5). In the present, Western societ- ies - and the scientific, legal, and economic systems they are built upon - colo- nize other lands and minds, conforming them to the Wests own image of "the human." Many people of non-European descent continue to be either culturally assimilated into Western civilizations or be managed by it, if such people have not already been exterminated for interfering with human "progress" and "freedom" as heralded by Western civilizations. Jean-Paul Sartre (2007) warned of such a humanist "theory that takes man as an end and as the supreme value" (p. 50). When the remarkable achievements of a few humans signal the greatness of all humanity, the value of one individual s achievement is assumed to give value and identity to the collective "us." A humanism that praises and condemns humans through a fixed, unitary meaning and goal of an "us" "leads ultimately to . . . Fas- cism" (p. 51). Just as whiteness was invented and deployed to divide and conquer the multiracial working class - preventing them from uniting to overthrow class hierarchy (Allen, 2012) - so too may the "cult of humanity" function to maintain the market and cultural imperialism of white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy through people s complicity with and celebration of its technological, globalizing a » progress. The hypocrisies of anthropocentrist humanism are not historical accidents, but the logical outcome of the production of subjectivities (e.g., identities and consciousnesses) founded on the negation of others. Val Plumwood (2002) argues that one cannot properly address the injustices against human and animal others independently since they are rooted in hegemonic centrisms - widespread and often unquestioned cultural practices of understanding and evaluating the world through the experiences and norms of an exclusive, elite population. Predicated upon the dominant understanding of the human "us," anthropocentrism funda- mentally intersects with other centrisms such as androcentrism and ethnocen- trism. Together, they operate through a self-referencing conceptual system of op- positional dualisms (e.g., human-animal, man-woman, civilized-savage) in which the implicit, taken-for-granted associations between subordinated identities mu- tually reinforce one another's subordination as Others. Given the intersections of various oppressions based upon a hegemonic human subjectivity, Matthew Calarco (2008) argues that anthropocentrism ought to be the primary target for critical theory since it is "always one version or another of the human that falsely</page><page sequence="8">10 Adam Weitzenfeld and Melanie Joy occupies the space of the universal and that functions to exclude [others] . . . from ethical and political consideration" (p. 10). Liberal Humanist, Posthumanist, and Feminist Anti-speciesism: Multiple Theoretical Fronts Against Speciesism Theoretically, humanism can retain its central project to nourish and protect hu- man reason and freedom without defining human being over and against animals and animality. Humanism can recognize both animal others' similarities and their differences by attending to their perspectives, experiences, and desires and the moral limits these place on human action. Yet, in practice, many humanists con- tinue to insist that humans and all other animals inhabit mutually exclusive moral categories despite the continual scientific undermining of any clear and distinct line between humans and (at least certain) other animals. To continue to insist on the anthropocentrist human-animal dualism and hierarchy in spite of the empiri- cal and phenomenological evidence against them is an act of speciesism - defined recently by Oscar Horta (2010) as "the unjustified disadvantageous consider- ation or treatment of those who are not classified as belonging to one or more [privileged] species" (p. 244). While one need not be anthropocentrist to be a speciesist (e.g., an alien race could be speciesist by privileging its own kind, and some humans may categorically favor dolphins over humans), anthropocentrism is the most pervasive ideological form of humanism and speciesism in the modern Western world. The violent contradictions of anthropocentrist humanism - the irrational dogmatism of human exceptionalism and the inhumane ordering and ranking of human and animal beings - are addressed by multiple, diverging theoretical orientations. The most mainstream orientation is that of liberal humanist anti- speciesists who recognize that the human-animal dichotomy is a false and unjust one, and advocate that the moral and legal principles of liberalism - the privileg- ing of the autonomy of the individual - be extended logically and consistently to each individual, regardless of their species classification. They decry the ir- rational inconsistency of anthropocentrism and speciesisms correspondence to other prejudices though deductive logic and moral reasoning. Those with alter- native orientations like - but not exclusive to - feminist and posthumanist anti- speciesists are critical of the ontology and epistemology of humanist moral and political philosophy, considering the demand for the logical consistency of pres- ent thought and politics insufficient. A radical transformation in thought and politics, they believe, is necessary for challenging the dominant and dominating ways of conceptualizing humans, animals, and morality that are at the very root of the worlds problems.</page><page sequence="9">An Overview of Anthropocentrism, Humanism, and Speciesism in Critical Animal Theory 1 1 Anthropocentric Bias and Consistency in Liberal Humanism Just as modern science has come to undermine its (anthropocentrist) humanist origins, so has humanisms commitment to its own principles demanded that it recognize its moral failure in excluding animal others from equal consideration for being assigned to different biological classes. Enlightenment humanisms dis- taste for appeal to authority and tradition, arbitrary prejudices, and nonrational sources of morality delegitimized previous justifications for human supremacy. Humanist values (e.g., reason, liberty, equality, individuality) could not be fairly advocated without extending moral consideration to each individual, regardless of ones species identity. "With the spread of universalist and egalitarian ideals," writes John Sanbonmatsu (201 1), "it did not take a great leap of logic for some far-sighted individuals to see how other animals too might have an interest in freedom, liberty, and fraternity" (p. 14). Beginning amid the civil rights, femi- nist, peace, and environmental movements of the late 1960s, a movement on the behalf of animal others deployed humanist rhetoric to demand that equal consideration be properly and consistently extended to individuals across species, challenging the unquestioned anthropocentrist ideology. In 1975, Peter Singer articulated what would become the most canonized argument for the equal con- sideration to animal others in his book Animal Liberation. In Animal Liberation , Singer wrote that the advocacy for equality is not an appeal to the fact that everyone is one another's equal in status and performance. Clearly, each being is superior and inferior to other beings in different capacities and by different standards. The advocacy for equality is a moral prescription that each beings interests count equally to the like interest of another, regardless of their present status and performance. The failure to administer equal moral con- sideration to a sentient being for not belonging to a privileged species is specie- sism, a prejudice as irrational and unjust as racism and sexism. One example of speciesism Singer deploys is that nonhuman animals with greater cognitive capabilities than severely brain-damaged orphans are regularly subjected to pain- ful, invasive research while the orphans are not merely because of their biological classification. Singers conclusion is not that the use of human and nonhuman animals as research equipment for medical progress is morally wrong, but that it is morally inconsistent to accept the exploitation of animal others and not also the humans with comparative cognitive capabilities. Although he does not rank preferences as did John Stuart Mill (1993), who wrote "better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied" (p. 164), Singer only recognizes the value of a being s future existence if that being is aware of it and has preferences that extend into the future. Those beings (e.g., chick- ens and severely cognitively impaired humans) who are incapable of projecting themselves and their desires into the future, he concludes, are not harmed by early deaths. Their lives are substitutable and their deaths are not only justified</page><page sequence="10">12 Adam Weitzenfeld and Melanie Joy but also potentially "good" if that means their substitutes will live richer, hap- pier lives (Singer, 1993). A strictly utilitarian approach like Singers may regard genetically engineering animals without consciousness as a moral improvement that resolves the present suffering of billions of animals exploited for food and science (Shriver, 2009). Tom Regan (1983) critiques Singer for inadequately addressing the violation of the integrity of animal others' individuality. According to utilitarianism, since the preferences of sentient beings can be abstracted from their singularity in order to be aggregated and weighed against one another, lives may be sacrificed and exploited for the greater many. The interests of human and animal others are to their personal integrity as liquid is to a receptacle: alienable, quantifiable, and ex- changeable. Regan proposes that moral agents have a duty to respect the integrity of "subjects-of-a-life" - sentient beings with rich desires, emotions, experiences, and thoughts. Animals with complex cognition such as mammals and perhaps birds ought to have equal moral rights because of the inherent worth of their in- ner lives, not simply because they have preferences. Gary Francione (2000, 2009), while sympathetic to Singers attack on speciesism and Regans advocacy of rights, take issues with both Singer s and Re- gans privileging of human consciousness in which animal others are due equal moral consideration only in proportion to how closely they correspond to hu- mans. Singer and Regan represent an anthropocentric anti-speciesism - privileg- ing "normal," adult human cognition by which all other beings are consistently judged regardless of assigned species. In lifeboat scenarios, both Singer and Regan would unquestioning sacrifice a dog - even a million in Regans scenario - for an able-bodied adult human. Francione upholds that no capacity (such as advanced cognitive functioning) beyond sentience has comparable moral relevancy. A being is due equal moral consideration for sentience alone. Joan Dunayer (2004) takes the principle of equal consideration to its most radical conclusion, advocating not only equal moral rights and the right not to be property, but also equal legal protection and penalties when humans violate animals rights to bodily integrity, self-determination, labor, and habitat. Posthumanist and Feminist Challenges to the Autonomous Humanist Subject While Singer and Regan challenged traditional humanisms speciesism, but re- tained its anthropocentric presuppositions, Francione and Dunayer challenged the anthropocentric cognitive prejudices of Singer and Regan in an attempt to push liberal humanism to its limits. Yet Francione and Dunayer, like Singer and Regan, never challenged their liberal humanisms own presuppositions. According to Cary Wolfe (2009a), while ethicists from Singer to Dunayer say they challenge the anthropocentric bias of their predecessors, they are humanist at "the perfor-</page><page sequence="11">An Overview of Anthropocentrism, Humanism , and Speciesism in Critical Animal Theory 1 3 mative level of what philosophy does (and thinks it can do) on a methodological level ... via the autonomy and impartiality of 'reason" (p. 58). Their humanist metaphysics and epistemology, Wolfe boldly declares, are "part of the very prob- lem it wants to think through. It wants to be anti-speciesist, but only because it is already humanist, it really can't be - or rather, it can, but only in a strategic, pragmatic way" (p. 58). Posthumanist and feminist theorists have challenged hu- manist anti-speciesist presuppositions such as the autonomous human subject, morality as a set of universalizable principles, disembodied reasoning as the origin and sole arbiter of moral values, and the marginalization of animal others' speci- ficity and participation in morality and society (Donovan &amp; Adams, 2007; Wolfe, 2009b). Posthumanist and feminist theorists conceive of the human subject as embodied and relational, and morality as embodied care and situational response to the particularities of the multitudes of animal bodies and contexts. Posthumanist theories open both the traditional objects of discourse ("the animal") as well as the subjects of discourse ("the human") to continual reas- sessment and revision. Posthumanism regards "the autonomous, domineering, atomistic subject of modernity" as a myth of Enlightenment thinking; it describes a subject alternatively as a "witness to and bearer of an event that exceeds and calls the singular subject into being" (Calarco, 2008, p. 12). Consciousness is not an intangible, fixed entity on-the-scene independent of and prior to the material and discursive constitution of the world. Rather consciousness is the effect of the institutions and discourses to which it responds. To be a subject is at once to be an active participant in constituting the world and to be subjected to the institu- tions and discourses one is thrown into. Further, according to Wolfe (2009b), posthumanism names the present moment in which "human nature" is thrown into question by technologies and discourses (e.g., cognitive ethology, neurobiol- ogy, bioengineering, cybernetics, global capitalism) (p. xv). Posthumanists may describe a present human condition to be carefully responded, but they do not prescribe a future human kind to be militantly attained. Neither is posthumanism a total rejection of humanism; it is an understanding of how humanist aspirations like reason and equality "are undercut by the philosophical and ethical frame- works used to conceptualize them" (p. xvi). Like posthumanist theory, postmodern (Haraway, 2007; Oliver, 2009) and radical feminist theory (Adams &amp; Donovan, 1995; Donovan &amp; Adams, 2007) contests the universality of the assertive, atomistic, autonomous subject that is foregrounded and sustained only through the disavowal of the "feminine" vulner- abilities of embodiment, dependency, and affect. The liberal humanist subject is not a benign myth but a foundational figure that dominating discourses and institutions are built upon. The myth of the autonomous subject both legitimizes the exploitation of women (and other others) due to the cultural construction of women as partially autonomous while also producing ignorance of the conditions</page><page sequence="12">14 Adam Weitzenf eld and Melanie Joy that both limit their autonomy and prop up the illusion of mens full autonomy: inequity in leadership roles and women's expected, co-opted, or undercompen- sated physical and emotional labor. According to Emily Clark (2012), feminist theory is uniquely and strategi- cally adept at addressing the human-animal binary and hierarchy because of its commitment to the materiality of the body, to attending to those bodies most vulner- able to abuse, to exposing the logic of exclusion and the politics of abjection, and. . . in its commitment to thinking about, and critiquing its own participation in, the ethics of representation and "speaking for." (p. 516) Posthumanism and feminist theory have different genealogies and orientations to overthrowing anthropocentrist norms that divide and conquer, but they some- times converge in ecofeminist theory, which exposes the material, conceptual, and historical interconnections between the exploitation and degradation of women and nonhuman others (Gaard, 1993; Plumwood, 2002). Yet, the impor- tant connections made by ecofeminists among sexism, anthropocentrism, racism, colonialism, militarism, and capitalism continue to be relatively ignored despite having preceded the articulation of similar connections described in recent Hu- man-Animal Studies literature by twenty-five years (Gaard, 2012). Posthumanist and feminist critiques of the illusion and injustices of the lib- eral subject is a challenge simultaneously to the ontology of Enlightenment hu- manism as well as its moral rhetoric of "rights" and "interests." Feminist critics Josephine Donovan and Carol Adams (2007) list several issues with rights-based and utilitarian orientations. First, these theories are founded upon centuries- old liberal humanism that served to protect the territorial interests of competi- tive, atomistic individuals, mainly those of landowning white men. Kelly Oliver (2009) explains that liberal humanist theories have not only an exclusionary logic "whereby one class has rights and the other has none," but also a competitive logic that "leads to calculations of whose interests are more important and whose rights trump others" (p. 36). Thus, equal protection under the law is insufficient since "it pits interests or rights against each other without considering differential power structures" (p. 35). Second, these theories extend moral considerability to animal others, not on their own terms but in correspondence (i.e., conformity) to their similarity to the "gender-neutral" liberal human subject free of dependency. Extentionist ethics only question the inconsistent application of the values and principles of the present system, not the criteria (i.e., content) and methodology (i.e., form) of judgment. As Catharine MacKinnon (2004) writes, "If qualified entrance into the human race on male terms has done litde for women . . . how much will being seen as humanlike, but not fully so, do for other animals?" (p. 271). Third, liberal human- ist ethics "devalues, suppresses, or denies the emotions" in order to codify ethics</page><page sequence="13">An Overview of Anthropocentrism, Humanism, and Speciesism in Critical Animal Theory 1 5 into a formalistic moral calculus, marginalizing the on-the-ground context of moral deliberation (Donovan &amp; Adams, 2007, p. 6). Oliver (2009) contends that basing ethics in principles rather than response to "the ambiguities and uncertainties of our experience" (p. 36) is paradigmatic of "the powerful speaking for the powerless," which replicates, but does not change, "the power structure itself," as it amounts to silencing lived experiences of both the moral agents and subjects (p. 38). Rationality, Rule-based Ethics, and the Marginalization of Embodiment and Care The marginalization (i.e., silencing) of the agency and experience of (human and nonhuman) animal bodies becomes salient when one dissects the self-authoriza- tion of humanist ethics extending from humanist ontology. As Traci Warkentin (2010) lucidly articulates, humanist morality assumes "that humans already have the right to grant' moral status to others, which implies that humans have both the ability and authority to pre-judge who counts morally and who does not" (p. 107). Even moral theorists who attempt to empty moral theory of its tradi- tional anthropocentric standards still accept humanism s anthropocentric orienta- tion that moral valuation and judgment originate and are grounded in the locus of (human) reason. Cora Diamond (2008) interprets the reason-based humanist methodology to moral consciousness and action as a deflection from the difficulty of reality - "something in reality resistant to our thinking it, or possibly to be painful in its inexplicability" (p. 45-46). The moral argumentation of human- ist anti-speciesists ironically reproduces the human-animal binary by deflecting attention from the difficulty of reality produced by two finitudes humans share with animal others: the finitude of flesh (i.e., embodiment and vulnerability) and the finitude of thought (i.e., the non-correspondence between our concepts and reality) (Wolfe, 2009b). First, methodologically approaching the issue of the unjust suffering and ex- ploitation of animals from deductive reasoning fails "to see how 'debate' as we un- derstand it may have built into it a distancing of ourselves from our sense of our own bodily life and our capacity to respond to and to imagine the bodily life of others" (Diamond, 2008, p. 53). The philosophical vocabulary and methodology of humanist anti-speciesism is "a deflection which makes our own bodies mere facts - facts which may or may not be thought of as morally relevant" (p. 59). Whereas a moral theory that begins ethics with "being a live [animal] body . . . transfers the burden of proof" to anthropocentrism to justify excluding animals from moral consideration, notes Ralph Acampora (2006), rationality-based ap- proaches to ethics tend to place the burden of proof on those advocating moral consideration for animals (p. 5). The humanist methodology holds that the pow- erlessness one experiences in the face of suffering - ones subjection to the power</page><page sequence="14">16 Adam Weitzenfeld and Melanie Joy of the powerlessness of another's body - is distorting, and so one must remain at a distance not only from the suffering animal other, but also one s own suffering. Second, the powerlessness that one experiences as a witness to injustices, the horror, and deep woundedness, is doubled as a feeling of powerlessness to repre- sent it in thought and language: "The words fail us, the words dont do what we are trying to get them to do" (Diamond, 2008, p. 67). The powerlessness from the woundedness may even be tripled when ones struggle to give testimony to an injustice is invalidated as irrationality by another to whom "my powerlessness presents itself as ignorance - a metaphysical finitude as an intellectual lack" (p. 68). The humanist anti-speciesist then is not so far from the anthropocentrist humanist in the "shared desire for a 'because'; because animals are this kind of being . . . thus-and-such is their standing for our moral thought" that amounts to "a form of skepticism in the desire for something better than what we are con- demned to (as the kind of animal we are)" (p. 71). The humanist disavowal of and distancing from the finitude of embodiment and language is a performance of a "humanity" defined against the imperfect transcendence and reasoning of animal and human others. For millennia, women (and other human Others) have been excluded from full and equal citizenship due to their discursive and institutional construction as less capable of articulat- ing themselves in speech and being unreasonably moved by external and bodily events. Their finitude, vulnerability, and passivity were thus marked as if power- ful normalized males uniquely transcended these limitations. Beings with any- thing less than full autonomy place less demand on one s enlightened self-interest since they lack the power to fully reciprocate and self-actualize. To care about the exploitation and suffering of those institutionally or intrinsically less capable of reciprocating and self-actualization (such as animals) is considered irrational and sentimental. By this logic, caring for animals is childish, primitive, and femi- nine - identities the modern, rational subject is defined against. Brian Luke (2007) argues that liberal rights- and interests-based theories, grounded in (the universalizability or contractual reciprocity of) self-interest, treat caring about dependent and nonreciprocating others as "the unreliable quirk of a few" versus "the normal state of humans generally" (p. 134). Animal libera- tion, however, is not obstructed because people are naturally selfish and unmoved by animals well-being but because "enormous amounts of social energy are ex- pended to forestall, undermine, and override sympathies for animals" (p. 134). Donovan and Adams (2007) have sought to reevaluate the role relationships and emotions play in ethics with a feminist ethics of care, which places emphasis on the sociopolitical context of relationships and the specificity of responsibilities for caring. While care is a fundamental capability for being human, care is a skill that "requires effort, courage and discipline" (p. 4). An animal care ethics, however, does not preclude an attention to justice, for to care for another is to care about</page><page sequence="15">An Overview ofAnthropocentrism, Humanism, and Speciesism in Critical Animal Theory 17 the conditions of their existence, the structures of their oppression, and opposing those structures that exploit and marginalize their existence. Universal, Individual-based Ethics, and the Marginalization of Ecology and Dependency The humanist anti-speciesist tradition has generally marginalized not only the embodiment and finitude humans share with animal others but also humans' embedding and interdependency in ecological societies. Ecofeminist and post- humanists critique not only the human-animal dualism but also the civilization- wilderness dualism that helps maintain it. They advocate (re)situating humans as ecologically embedded and embodied subjects of interspecies communities (Plumwood, 2002). Humans did not evolve apart from other animals but rather over time as inhabitants in mixed species communities (Midgley, 1984). Donna Haraway (2008) deploys the term "companion species" to describe the species with whom humans have been entangled in their natural (i.e., material) and cul- tural (i.e., semiotic) evolution. The concept of companion species punctuates the reality that we have never been human. Humans have always been part of co-constitutive relationships with other species. Recognizing that humans and animal others are always already entangled, Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka (2012) advocate perceiving animal others "not solely as vulnerable and suffering individuals but also as neighbors, friends, co-citizens, and members of communi- ties ... [in which] animals and humans can co-exist, interact, and even cooperate on the basis of justice and equality" (p. 24). Liberal humanist anti-speciesists favor the moral concepts of the individual, interests, and rights over those of the mixed communities, companion species, and nature cultures. Some liberal humanists are utilitarians who advocate the hyper-management of ecology and eradicating prédation to reduce aggregative individual suffering (Cowen, 2003). Others who, on the contrary, respect the integrity and autonomy of animals identify as abolitionists - animal rights ac- tivists who consider all welfare reform as immoral and ineffective at abolishing institutionalized animal exploitation. For many abolitionists, write Donaldson and Kymlicka (2012), "It is the very fact of interaction and interdependency that is the problem" (p. 63). Some conceive of the status of domesticated animals "as a kind of deviation from their true or natural community in the wild," perceiving their lack of freedom from human dependency not only as a condition enabling their continued exploitation but also as an indignity (p. 100). Because domestic animals have been bred for neoteny (e.g., juvenile traits such as submissiveness) and have lost any ecologically viable niche in which to be free outside of human society, abolitionists like Francione (2000) and Hall (2010) advocate ending the existence of domestic animals.</page><page sequence="16">18 Adam Weitzenf eld and Melanie Joy While Donaldson and Kymlicka (2012) acknowledge that the majority of ani- mals are institutionally bred without agency in ways not in the interest of them or their children, they are also concerned that Francione and Halls abolitionist- extinctionist position supports "a massive [sexual] intervention" and that they make "no attempt to justify [it] in relation to the individuals whose liberty is being restricted" (p. 81). While neither would advocate "policing nature" through eradi- cating animal prédation as some utilitarians have (Cowen, 2003), they seem to have no problem, at least theoretically, with policing animal sexuality until animal cohabitation is eradicated. Kari Weil (2012) interprets this extinctionist position as the sacrifice of domestic animals for the "idea of the world" (p. 136) despite the possibility that animal others "may accept those [human-animal] bonds as the price (and sometimes the point) of life" (p. 134). Instead of practicing a dialogical, attentive care, as advocated by feminist anti-speciesists, to attempt to understand what particular animals may want, some humanist anti-speciesists are more con- cerned with the consistent application of their transcendental ideas. Indeed, some liberals like Siobhan O 'Sullivan (201 1) would accept an overall decrease in animal welfare so long as it was "internally consistent" across nonhuman animal species as part of "legitimate" democratic decision making (p. 171). Anti-speciesists do not always attend to animal others "on their own terms"; occasionally they project their humanist aspirations for consistency and full autonomy upon them. Ironically, what seems to result from the eradication of domestic human- animal relations is a more radical segregation of human and animal societies. This domestic-human/wild-animal dualism is itself part of the very problems humanist anti-speciesists want to address: the reproduction of a human-animal dichotomy and the human exceptionalism of agency. First, the domestic-wild dichotomy treats the two as ontologically distinct entities, ignoring liminal animals such as migrating birds (e.g., Canadian Geese) and urban dwellers (e.g., coyotes) who require no direct human care yet who are partially dependent upon urban habitat (Donaldson &amp; Kymlicka, 2012). Second, the dichotomy insinuates the human exceptionalist idea that humans are the intentional and sole authors of history, outside or above the influence and agency of animal others as if the presence of companion species hasn't facilitated and undermined (human) imperialism (Weil, 2012, p. 132). By recognizing these limits and inconsistencies in liberal humanist anti-speciesism, posthumanist, and feminist theory advance anti-speciesist theory and practice by resisting the inclination to merely extend the dominant discourse that has historically served to justify the subjugation of animal others. The Critical Animal Turn: The Theoretical Analysis of and Opposition to Speciesism Some anti-speciesists are critical of both liberal humanists limited understand- ing of speciesism and posthumanists reluctance to prescribe norms and strategy.</page><page sequence="17">An Overview of Anthropocentrism, Humanism, and Speciesism in Critical Animal Theory 19 Liberal humanism, they argue, attacks the symptoms of the structural violence of capitalism and other dominating regimes without a broader historical and socio- logical critique of their sources, while posthumanists "often seek to bracket, post- pone, or eradicate questions of ethics" despite the fact that "ethico-political and practical questions regarding animal exploitation" are an inevitable consequence of deconstructing the human-animal binary (Jenkins, 2012, p. 506). These criti- cal anti-speciesists gravitate toward CAT, which shares the posthumanist critique of modernity with the humanist advocacy of freedom, engaging in interdisciplin- ary theory and coalition building for the total liberation of all those oppressed by anthropocentrism and other hegemonic centrums (Best, 2009). John Sanbonmatsu (201 1) writes that critical theory originates from the intu- ition that the present world is unfree and "shares with other emancipatory tradi- tions the desire to redeem the conscious living subject, or person, from thought- lessness, violence, and domination" (p. 5). Accusations that critical theory's commitment to defend the "universal freedom" of persons from the indignities wrought by oppressive systems like capitalism is humanistic would be correct, as two of critical theory's major sources are neo-Marxist and existential humanism (p. 6). Kenneth Shapiro (1990), Sanbonmatsu (2007), and Gary Steiner (2013) argue that humanism need not be a lost cause if it is dissociated with its anthro- pocentrist ideological commitments. The problem with past humanisms is not the dignity they recognize in human experience and freedom, but the exclusivity of what counts as freedom (e.g., reason) and whose ought to be respected (e.g., Homo sapiens). Previous formulations of humanism were unjust and illusory be- cause they subordinated what humans share with animal others (e.g., human em- bodiment and desire) to transcendence and instrumental reasoning, and founded a violent antagonism in which human freedom is enacted through the subjection of all that is nonhuman. The central disjuncture between (humanist) CAT and posthumanist theory is that, methodologically, the former begins with human (and animal) others' originary freedom and wholeness before alienation, repression, and fragmenta- tion under capitalist patriarchy, whereas the latter is suspicious of "natural," pre- discursive, pre-institutionalized bodies. The former accepts anthropological and normative universais that define and advocate mutual human and nonhuman animal freedom, while the latter is wary that a call for global unity under the name of "freedom," "liberation," and "progress" would only serve as another pre- tense for empire. Yet, what the two orientations share in common - their critique of anthropocentrism, human exceptionalism, instrumental reason, and the tran- scendence of the finitude and passions of embodiment - overshadow their diver- gences. Posthumanism and critical theory need not be opposed in their efforts to address speciesism's "rootedness in our minds, bodies, practices, discourses, institutions, [and] identities" (Sanbonmatsu, 2011, p. 29).</page><page sequence="18">20 ^ Adam Weitzenfeld and Melanie Joy Both critical animal and posthumanist theorists understand that attitudes and practices founded on human-animal dualism and hierarchy in spite of the empirical and phenomenological evidence against them are not merely human chauvinism - a militant and bigoted patriotism to humanity. Human chauvinism insinuates that the violence against human and animal others is an individual s irrational prejudice; it fails to capture the ideological nature of anthropocentrism, the institutional and discursive mechanisms that ensure its reproduction and en- tangle it with other centrisms. "Speciesism," as a neologism, more effectively ad- dresses interspecies injustices by analogy to and in complicity with other oppres- sive (e.g., sexist and racist) discourses and practices than "human chauvinism." David Nibert (2002) addresses speciesism sociologically as an ideology that natu- ralizes and rationalizes the present unequal political-economic relationships based upon competition and exploitation of animal others that are upheld by the state. Speciesism, accordingly, is not the source but the symptom of oppression that lies in hierarchical material relationships whereby power and capital - fiscal, social, cultural, and spiritual - are accumulated through the exploitation of animals. Speciesism is not mere prejudice but a composite of interspecies injustices within material institutions, discursive regimes, and embodied affects. Speciesism is a complex of material institutions that systematically, non-criminally sacrifice the lives and interests of animals (Noske, 1997a; Nibert, 2002; Torres, 2007; Twine, 2012) as well as cultural discourses and narratives, speech and stories that circulate misrepresentations of animal others as inferiors and proper objects of sacrifice (Dunayer, 1995). The institution and discourse are part of a positive feedback loop, in which the existence of one validates the existence of the other. Material and discursive relations transmitted through human and animal other bodies also become habituated in embodied affect - a visceral force (e.g., anxiety, disgust, rage, lust, joy) that moves bodies toward actions and relations with oth- ers. Affect provides explanatory power for how humans both become subject to speciesism through family meals (e.g., the communal enjoyment and performance of [human] family through eating animals) as well as how they may be freed from it through witnessing - (e.g., grief and rage from the exposure to speciesisms vio- lence as violence). CAT thus requires an awareness of and opposition to the larger political-economic structures that manifest oppression, the discourse and narratives that legitimate these institutions, and the exclusionary affects that may ensue when these institutions and discourses are challenged. Carnism: A Case Study of Structural Speciesism From a CAT standpoint, speciesism is to be understood as a complex of institu- tions, discourses, and affects that structure human existence on a false, patho- logical reality. The most grand and omnipresent occurrences of speciesism are ironically the most banal: the exploitation, objectification, and consumption of</page><page sequence="19">An Overview of Anthropocentrism, Humanism, and Speciesism in Critical Animal Theory 21 animals as food. Carnism - a sub-ideology of speciesism that dichotomizes non- human animals into "edible" and "inedible" categorizations and legitimates the exploitation and consumption of animal others - thus presents an apt case study of speciesism. Carnism is used here for several other reasons as well. First, carnism is structurally similar to speciesism but, while most examinations of speciesism have been theoretical, there is empirical research examining the psychological and social dimensions of carnism (Angyal, 1941; Beardsworth &amp; Keil, 1993; Holm &amp; Mohl, 2000). Naming and deconstructing carnism, therefore, may enable us to make invisible naturalized and normalized practices and affects of speciesism visible objects to challenge and transform. Moreover, carnism enables the oppres- sion of the majority of nonhuman beings who are exploited for human ends. And finally, the perpetual, intimate, and deeply symbolic act of eating animals in large part defines the human-nonhuman relationship. Given the profound impact of carnism on the structure of human-nonhuman relations, vegan praxis - a counternarrative and practice in which nonhuman be- ings are not viewed or treated as appropriate for human consumption - is perhaps the most effective and direct way to subvert the speciesist complex. Deconstruct- ing carnism is a significant step in moving toward such a praxis. This final and most important point reflects a central tenet of Critical Animal Studies: that theo- retical understanding must be grounded in and geared toward practical applica- tion to bring about real change in individual lives and to cultivate a genuine shift in social consciousness. Carnism is the ideology that conditions people to eat (certain) animals and it is a sub-ideology of speciesism, in that it exists within a speciesist ethos (Joy, 2001, 2010). Carnism (like speciesism) is structural and internalized, shaping in- dividual attitudes and behaviors toward those animal others who are classified as "edible." Carnism is a global phenomenon; in animal-eating cultures around the world, a select group of animal others are classified as edible while all other species are classified and thus perceived as inedible and disgusting to consume (Farb &amp; Armelagos, 1980; Fessier, Navarrette, &amp; Navarrette, 2003; Simoons, 1961). The mechanisms of carnism are defenses that are disseminated by and inform material institutions and individual human consumers of animals in an invisible yet potent feedback loop. Such defenses are necessary to maintain the carnist sys- tem or complex, as the tenets and practices of carnism are diametrically opposed to fundamental human motivations and values (e.g., compassion, reciprocity, jus- tice). Carnistic defenses enable gross cognitive and affective distortions in order for human consumers to support the system. Indeed, the empathie response to witnessing the suffering of others has been demonstrated to be a normal, biologi- cal reaction through the discovery of mirror neurons (Blakeslee, 2006; Ramach- andran, 2006). Mirror neurons are neurons in the brain that are activated when a subject witnesses the experience of another, and the subject actually feels with</page><page sequence="20">22 Adam Weitzenfeld and Melanie Joy the other. Though studies on motor neurons have focused on the witnessing of human beings, there is no reason to assume that mirror neurons are not activated when humans witness the experience of nonhuman beings as well. The dominant, carnistic narrative appears to be constructed to obstruct the authentic human empathy and compassion that would disable the system. In short, exploitative systems such as carnism must use a set of institutional and discursive mechanisms that enable otherwise empathie people to participate in violent practices without fully realizing what they are doing. Carnistic defenses operate on two levels: they are institutionalized and inter- nalized, and each level reinforces the other. Carnistic defenses exist to construct fictitious cultural narratives that both validate carnism and invalidate veganism. These narratives tell the respective stories that "eating animals is the right thing to do" and "not eating animals is the wrong thing to do." Carnistic defenses are at once discrete and interrelated; they are distinct but overlap with and reinforce one another, the whole they create becoming greater than the sum of its parts. The primary carnistic defense is denial: denying that there is a problem in the first place erases any responsibility for addressing it. The main cultural narratives told by denial are "there is no problem," "there is no system," "there is no oppres- sion," and "there is no counternarrative." Denial is expressed largely through in- visibility, and the main way carnism remains invisible is by remaining unnamed: if carnism is not named, it cannot be conceptualized, questioned, or challenged. The invisibility of carnism is why eating animals appears to be a given rather than a choice. Thus, carnism strips human consumers of animal others of their freedom of choice, because without awareness, there is no free choice. Carnism also remains invisible by keeping its victims out of sight and thus conveniently out of public consciousness. Indeed, carnism is a system of victim- ization, in that it victimizes all participants in different waysģ Some victims are obvious and direct, such as the 10 billion (land) animals who are slaughtered annually in the United States alone for their flesh and other body parts (as cited by FARM, 2013), and the environment, the degradation of which the United Na- tions says is caused largely by animal agriculture (United Nations, 2006). Other victims are indirect, such as vegans, who one could argue comprise an ideological minority in a repressive dominant culture; or nonvegans who are at once perpe- trators and victims, supporting a system that has conditioned them to act against their core values and their own interests, as eating animals increases ones risk for some of the most serious diseases in the Western world today (Campbell &amp; Campbell, 2006) and requires a fundamental psycho-emotional disconnection. While all carnistic institutions utilize denial, the institution that relies most heavily on this defense is animal agriculture itself. The blatant denial of animal agriculture can be seen through its wildly misleading discourse (e.g., carnistic advertising campaigns promoting the "happy-to-be-eaten" farmed animal) and its</page><page sequence="21">An Overview of Anthropocentrism, Humanism, and Speciesism in Critical Animal Theory 23 refusal to retract the invisibility of its practices, an act most notably manifested in the enactment of new laws that criminalize any attempt to challenge or expose carnistic denial. The denial of carnism and the embodied experience of farmed animals - the fact that "meat," "eggs," and "dairy" are from once-conscious and sentient beings - becomes internalized by human consumers of animal others who end up viewing corpses as cuisine and thus feel delight rather than disgust. Moreover, carnistic denial obscures and minimizes the vegan counternarrative. The vegan movement is obfuscated, and vegan advocates are often silenced and stereotyped. Denial-invisibility is in no way sufficient to maintain the entire carnistic sys- tem; hints of the truth are omnipresent, from the palpable vein in the chicken "drumstick" to the dismembered bodies of dead animals that line the aisles of supermarkets and fill the plates of the majority of consumers. Thus, consumers of animal others must be able to justify their participation in carnism. Justification provides consumers a "good reason," a set of dominant, fictitious narratives, to be participating in an ideological system that in fact runs counter to what are likely their authentic narratives. There is a vast mythology surrounding eating animals, but all myths arguably fall under the Three Ns of Justification: eating animals is normal, natural, and necessary (Joy, 2010). The Three Ns are of course the same narratives that prop up all ideological complexes. Narratives of justification essentially normalize, natu- ralize, and mandate adherence to an ideology, thus legitimizing the system and forcing widespread discursive and affective conformity. Put differendy, carnistic justifications provide a rationale that shapes the way human consumers of animal others think and feel about eating animals and reinforce the human-over-animal dynamic that marks such a relationship. Within the past several years, there has been a shift in cultural attitudes to- ward eating animals, at least in parts of the affluent West. As public awareness of CAFOs and veganism has increased, three distinct trends in the consumption of animals have emerged: "humane," "sustainable/local," and "nutritional" meat, dairy, and eggs. Each of these trends may be understood as part of a backlash against the vegan counternarrative; as such a counternarrative has sufficiently raised awareness of the impact of animal agriculture on animals, the environ- ment, and human health. The new pro-carnism arguments may thus be seen as an attempt to defend the weakened animal-eating establishment against the very real threat posed by an increasingly powerful vegan movement. The aforementioned arguments have morphed into new ideologies - neo- carnisms - that are organized around the invalidation of the vegan counternar- rative (Joy, 201 1). Neocarnist narratives promote the fictions that not eating ani- mals - veganism - is abnormal, unnatural, and unnecessary. In other words, the neocarnisms exist to provide "rational" arguments to invalidate veganism, largely</page><page sequence="22">24 Adam Weitzenfeld and Melanie Joy by invalidating the three pillars of the vegan argument: animal welfare-rights, the environment, and human health. Moreover, because veganism is framed as a (subjective) ideology while the neocarnisms are framed as (objective) ideas, vegan arguments are portrayed as biased and thus invalid. Neocarnisms are reminders that social movements do not grow along a straight trajectory. The radical change demanded by vegan praxis will not come about without great resistance. And fi- nally, neocarnism is a manifestation of the fact that (at least the majority of) those who participate in animal exploitation do in fact care about nonhuman beings; the neocarnisms would not have emerged if eating animals did not trigger a deep moral unease. This last point is easily overlooked or forgotten but it is essential to grasp if people are to move toward vegan praxis. Carnistic discourse and affect are perhaps best understood through a decon- struction of the carnistic schema. The carnistic schema is organized around defen- sive cognitive processes that distort perceptions and therefore cultivate pro-carnist affect. Carnistic cognitive processes include objectification, de-individualization/ abstraction, and dichotomization (creating a perceived binary and enabling a speciesist-carnist hierarchy). Farmed animals are objectified in unique and power- ful ways; they are "livestock" and "broilers" (before they are even killed). They are seen as abstract members of a group about which humans have made generalized assumptions ("a pig is a pig and all pigs are the same"). And they are placed in rigid cognitive categories, classified as "edible" and thus less worthy, or unworthy, of moral concern (Adams &amp; Donovan, 1995). Carnistic discourse plays a key role in reinforcing carnistic ideology, largely through the use of an inaccurate and misleading lexicon. For instance, the phrase "meat eater" describes a behavior as though it were divorced from a belief system (hence vegans are not referred to as "plant eaters"), in essence reinforcing the invisibility of the ideology. And both "omnivore" and "carnivore" refer to ones biological predisposition rather than ones ideological choice; these terms rein- force the assumption that eating animals is natural, one of the most entrenched and compelling carnistic justifications. Because of the power of discourse to con- struct perceptions and affect to reinforce the dominant narrative, it is particularly important that the vegan counterdiscourse not mirror the language of oppression. In other words, moving toward total liberation means examining internal and external structures and taking steps toward shifting such ways of seeing, commu- nicating, and being. Dominant ideologies and narratives, and the complexes they inevitably form, maintain power largely by remaining invisible. The invisibility of the carnist- speciesist complex - and of its defenses - form some of the central pillars on which the system stands. The transformative vegan counternarrative discourses and practices must therefore not only provide alternative narratives but explicitly expose the fictions of the speciesist-carnist narratives. In other words, as men-</page><page sequence="23">An Overview of Anthropocentrism, Humanism , and Speciesism in Critical Animal Theory 25 tioned earlier, vegan praxis cannot replace the speciesist-carnist complex without first exposing normalized practices and affects of these systems, making such prac- tices visible objects to confront and transform. Vegan praxis must incorporate a discourse and affect that reflect not only animal liberation but also total liberation. Vegan praxis must be oriented toward challenging all oppressive power structures, externally - in the realm of material institutions - and internally - in discourse/perception/affect. It must embody and promote the opposing qualities and practices of anthropocentrism, binary and hierarchical categorization, and, thus, othering. A vegan praxis, ideally, is an ever-changing way of understanding and relating to oneself and all other beings based on empathy, authenticity, reciprocity, justice, and integrity - the principles that underscore true freedom.
