SINGH Solar Traditions in Tribal and Folk Cultures of India For early primitive man as well as the tribal and folk mind even today, the sun is the most visible manifestation of nature's power, of energy, of effulgence. The eclipse of the sun or appearance of black spots in it causes widespread fear. The sun is related to health, well-being and also to diseases, particularly skin diseases such as leprosy and their cure. It is believed to sustain crops and plants, regulate agriculture and irrigation. It is, in short, life giver to all. Such ideas permeate folk belief and have percolated from folk into classical traditions, from the non-Sanskritic 'little' traditions to the 'great' traditions of sun worship institutionalised in the chain of sun temples scattered over the country, and embodied in beautifully carved statues of the sun god riding a chariot driven by seven horses. The objective of this paper is to underline the persistence, and the growing popularity of folk forms of sun worship; and their relationship to the classical traditions represented by historical traditions, Sanskrit classics and scriptures particularly the Puranas. Paradoxical though it may seem, not all the five hundred-odd tribal communities as of today make any explicit reference to sun worship. The sun figures in the myths of some of them, not all. The Nagas have no theory about the origin of the sun, but the Zemi Nagas believe that the moon is the younger brother of the sun. The Gonds and the Bhumia sacrifice pigs to the sun god (Suraj Deo). They were reported to have worshipped a representation of the sun during a feast which combined fertility rites with human sacrifices. The Khond worship the sun as the great god representing light. He created a wife, Tari, goddess of the earth, who prevented the great god from creating man; but the sun god eventually won. Tari represents the dark forces. After death, the soul goes to the sun. The Khonds thus believe in the sun as a benevolent god, the creator,</page><page sequence="3">30 / India International Centre Quarterly the abode of the dead. They offer feasts to the sun which they relate to harvest and fertility, at their festival called Salo Katha held at harvest time. The Oraons of Bihar identify their supreme god Dharmesh with the sun. The Bodos of the North-East regard the sun as their god, and the Todas in the South salute the sun. Allusions to waters and their creatures abound in Bengali folktales, which include a reference to the voyage of the sun god by a boat made of sandal wood. The two strong traditions of the sun cult from the North-East and Central India deserve to be described at length. The Adi, one of the major tribes of Arunachal Pradesh in the North-East, have the legends of the Donyi-Polo (the sun and the moon). The story goes that there were two suns in the beginning of creation which beat down harshly upon the people, who could neither sleep nor rest, causing infinite pain and misery to them. A primitive archer named Etung Tulung shot down one of them with his arrow. In protest, the other sun did not rise causing darkness and suffering to the people. This sun was ultimately persuaded to come out but it appeared only after dark; it was pale and less bright. However, the sun remains the great witness in the sky. As Elwin says, he is The eye of the world: he is as important to man as the eye is to the body. He watches everything: he is the witness of truth : he shows man the way to go: he protects them: he treats them with mercy. Above all he is the lord of truth and an oath taken on his name is the most binding of all. The priest of this religion (miri or dondai) presides over festivities. The worship (ipak) or propitiation of various spirits dwelling in rocks, mountains, rivers, waterfalls is performed to protect crops, etc. The Donyi-Polo cult has been revived and organised in a big way today. While Hinduism is spreading along the foothills (Upagiri), and Buddhism in the north (Vahiagiri), the Christian converts among the tribes of this state are estimated to constitute 15 per cent. Donyi-Polo in the central region (Antagiri) seems to be the sheet anchor of this tribal community, holding them together in their tradition. An impressive temple to Donyi-Polo has been constructed at Along. Some see shades of anthropomorphic Hin</page><page sequence="4">K.S.SINGH / 31 duism in the institutionalisation of this primitive cult. But there is far more to it. This cult has become the symbol of the identity of the Adi people, of their cultural autonomy. The Donyi-Poloists participated in the World Religions Congress in 1990. They run schools, charitable dispensaries, a computer training centre and other institutions a la Rama Krishna Mission. i a ihe Singbonga (the spirit of the day) is the great spirit, the spirit of light. Sing, representing light, is the term for excellence. JL Thus Singhbhum is the Sindisum, the best of lands, Sinkula is the lion, best of the tigers and Singbonga is the greatest of the spirits. The sun god, the supreme god among the Mundas, an ancient tribe concentrated in Chotanagpur in Bihar and adjoining regions. The sun determines the direction, the east (singi turo) and the west (singi dumbui). The Singbonga first meant the giver of light, implying both the sun and the moon. The Singbonga now means the supreme spirit, who is both visible as the sun and invisible as the spirit. He is also the "Old One" (Haram Singbonga). He is the creator and sustainer, all pervasive, all powerful. The Munda epic, the Sosobonga or the Story of the Asur (Asur Kahani) commemorates the exploits of the Singbonga which is central to the Munda ethos. The Sosobonga as recited today begins with the story of Creation. In the beginning there was only water. The Singbonga and his wife felt very lonely. So the Singbonga created fish, tortoise, crab, leech; he then created the earth which sprouted grass, plants and trees, and later birds and animals. Finally, out of a big egg emerged two human beings, a boy and girl. The earth, at that time, was ruled by the iron-smelting Asurs. The smoke emanating from their hearth made life difficult. The Singbonga assumed the form of a boy, Khasra Kora, whose body was full of sores and rashes. Here the association of the sun with skin disease is significant. He came down to the Asur settle ment to persuade the Asurs to give up iron smelting, and went about his mission in a planned way. He first contacted the oldest Munda couple, Lutkum, and served in their house. The Singbonga tried to persuade the Asurs to give up their ways, but they would not listen to him. He sent many messengers but they were humiliated and turned away. The Asurs tried to kill him by putting him in their furnace, but he emerged shining like gold, carrying</page><page sequence="5">32 / India International Centre Quarterly utensils of gold and diamonds. He told them that their furnace was full of gold and silver, diamonds and other precious stones. He tricked the Asurs into entering the big furnace where they were reduced to ashes. The boy then rose in the sky, resplendent and awe-inspiring. The Asur women clung to him because they could go nowhere. The Singbonga shook them off. They fell in rivers, on hills and into valleys and became the spirits presiding over them. The Munda priests (pahan) and the magician (sokha) were ap pointed to propitiate these spirits. And then, The Singbonga and the Virgin Goddess ascended in the sky by a rope The lotus and flowers bloomed in the ponds. They overflowed with water Plants and trees sprouted in all directions; Men, animals and even insects became happy. All gratefully remembered that the Singbonga and Virgin God dess Had recreated their world, and put an end to their suffering. Therefore let us give up malice and stay together like brothers. Thus did they ponder, thus did they decide. Throughout the story, which is recited on important occasions, there are references to the sun god, his resplendence, his power, his benevolence and the protection that he gave his people, the Mun das, whose life he controls. At one level, this epic is seen as marking the transformation of the Mundas from a pre-agricultural tribe into an agricultural community. The Mundas vanquished the Asurs and adopted their iron technology in new agriculture. The Singbon ga made the first plough with its shaft, grip and handle all in one piece. He also divided time into day and night. The iron smelting Asurs, who coexist with the Munda today, do not support this version of the events as given in the Mundas' epic. Another way of looking at this story is to note the triumph of the sun cult over the prevailing cult of the Asurs and their spirits, the emergence of monotheism among the Mundas, the belief in the supreme being who controls both spirits and men and who is generally benevolent. When Christianity spread among the Mun das, this story was reinterpreted to reinforce Biblical legends such</page><page sequence="6">K.S.SINGH / 33 as the notion of the great spirit of the old man. In its present form, the Singbonga is not only the sun, he is also invisible and all-per vasive, a benign universal spirit. The Sosobonga legend also con tains a notion of an avatar, an incarnation of the Singbonga who came down to destroy the Asurs. There are some Mundas who, under the influence of Vaishnavism, worship the Singbonga as a personal god. References to the Singbonga also occur simultaneous ly with those to the Virgin Mother Goddess (Devi Kunwari)—which again indicate the impact of the Mother Goddess cult of the Hindus among the Mundas. r | ihe notion of two suns seems to have been widely prevalent among communities located along the Himalayas. The first JL illustration of the two suns occurs at the Burzhom site in Kashmir Valley dating back to about 3000-2000 BC. The concept of the two suns seems to have been present among the Santals also. The original meaning of Singbonga was both sun and moon. (EM. p. 3974). Interestingly the Kol worshipped the sun and believed the moon to be his wife and the stars their children. The Zemi Naga regard the moon and the sun as two brothers, the moon being the younger of the two. The best-known folk festival centered on the sun cult is known as the Chhath, which takes place on the sixth day after the festival of lights (Deepavali). The Chhath festival is celebrated twice, once in the month of Kartika and later in Chaitra. The one celebrated in Kartika when the sun in the Libra sign is considered the more important. One sees the connection between the paddy harvest and this festival. Its geography is also important. It is celebrated in the region on both sides of the Ganga from the adjoining parts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh and throughout Bihar, up to its borders with West Bengal. The elements of the sun cult and the homage to life-giving Ganga seem to be intertwined. The communities from Bihar who have migrated to the tribal areas of Chotanagpur and the Santal Parganas, or to West Bengal, also celebrate it with enthusiasm. The common man describes this festival as the greatest of all festivals. He distinguishes it from the 'classical' festivals in four ways. First, the Chhath involves participation of all communities, while the classical festivals involve the actual participation of only</page><page sequence="7">Chhath Festival at Patna on the banks of the Ganges. Display of offerings to the Sun, at Chhath Festival, Patna.</page><page sequence="8">K.S.SINGH / 35 a few people in the ceremonies. Secondly, the folk festival involves participation of men and women equally, in fact of women more than men. Thirdly, no drinks or meat or animal sacrifices are offered; there is a strong streak of austerity in the celebration. The offerings are of the simplest kind, made up of milk, jaggery (gur), pancake (roti) made of freshly-harvested paddy, sugarcane stalk, coconut, seasonal and dry fruits, vegetables which even an ordi nary family can afford. Lastly, it is a festival which does not recognise commensal barriers. All distinctions based on caste and strata disappear during the four-day long festival, and the offerings are freely exchanged among the people. The sun god shines equally on all. He is the symbol of equality and, therefore, even in the caste-ridden society of Bihar all distinctions are forgotten for a few days. The sun god is a harsh task-master. Therefore, none of the injunctions can be violated with impunity. He punishes people who transgress, and is unsparing in doing so. The preparations for the Chhath start on the fourth day of the Deepavali. Those who participate in making offerings to the sun perform austerities as part of the preparations. They abstain from sex and household chores, wear unstitched clothes, eat simple salt-less food from earthen vessels, fast, sleep on the floor, and maintain utmost cleanliness. The basket-makers and potters do brisk business at the time of Chhath. The first offering to the sun is made in the evening as the sun sets. The second is made when it rises on the following morning. The procession on both days is generally led by married women, with men following with offerings in sieves and wicker baskets, decorated with bits of red-dyed cotton to ward off evil spirits. The site for making the offerings, the Ganga or for that matter ponds or even wells, present a grand spectacle of teeming people, of flickering flames from countless earthen lamps. Men as well as women make offerings standing in water. This is followed by the recitation of the sacred stories (kathas) about the glory of the sun. The Puranas in their typical way glorify sun worship and the month in which it is performed. The sun is described as the source of life, and the sun god as the creator and sustainer of all life. The sun lights up the universe. It cures diseases; destroys sins; removes destitution and want; grants longevity; bestows food, wealth, children, fame, glow of health, intelligence and good fortune.</page><page sequence="9">Surya on royal banner, Rajasthan 19th Century.

The influence of the Mother Goddess cult on Chhath appears to have appeared later. It is explained through myths. Devi, it is said, was born in Bihar to restore happi ness after the great battle between the Asurs and Devas. She is the giver of children and their protector. She ensures the perpetuation of lineage (vansha) by granting the boon of having sons. The anthropomorphic representation of Chhathi Mai has been a recent innovation. The essential characteristics of the Chhath as the festival centered on sun worship, however, remain intact. P I lhe relationship of this folk cult to the institutionalised wor ship of the sun can now be discussed. Historical literature JL has ignored the genesis from folk cults, and has traced sun worship to influences from outside the country. However, the folk and tribal origins of the sun cult are indigenous, uniquely the people's own. Its influence on the classical traditions of sun wor ship, particularly in Eastern India, should be explored. Secondly, there is a continuum between folk and classical perceptions of the sun as the almighty god who cures diseases,and who is linked to harvesting and irrigation. He is both visible and invisible. Thirdly, the region where folk and institutional forms co-exist needs to be closely examined. For instance, central Bihar, where the Chhath festival is held, is also the area which boasts of many sun temples. Strong historical evidence of sun worship is found in South Bihar, particularly in Gaya, Shahabad, Nalanda. The sun cult also penetrated in Chotanagpur where images of the sun have been found in Ranchi, Hazaribagh and other places. The sun temple at Deo in Gaya is one such example. Legend has it that there were a thousand sun temples around Deo. That this legend has substance is evident from a large number of statues of the sun discovered in the areas as close as Sultanighat on the border of Palamau and Gaya. Statues of the sun god have been found all over Chotanagpur and even beyond, along with statues of other gods and goddesses. Man Singh became general and governor of Bihar, during the reign of the emperor Akbar. He belonged to the Kachhwaha clan, which is linked to the solar dynasty of the Rajputs, and constructed sun temples in Bihar. Therefore, it seems that this is one region where</page><page sequence="11">38 / India International Centre Quarterly folk and institutional forms of sun worship enmesh. Sun worship in India at present is said to be an amalgam of many elements—Vedic, local cults, Mithra worship introduced by the Magi of Persia, stories and modes of worship prescribed in the Puranas, and the tradition of Saura worship. The sun is both a transcendental symbol of energy and a planet which is believed to influence life on earth. The sun temples dating back to the fourth and the thirteenth century are now mostly in ruins, but sun wor ship continues at the folk level without the meditation of temple priests and without any fear of pollution. It also continues at the level of the elite who recite the Gayatri mantra, practise the rituals of Suryanamaskar, and make their offerings to the Sun (arghya). In this respect, the worship of the sun dating back to the Vedas and even earlier, still survives while many other gods, Vedic and non Vedic, have faded away.
