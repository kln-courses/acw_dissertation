<plain_text><page sequence="1">+ Mystics Quarterly "PERFECTION IS NOT OF THIS WORLD": SAMUEL BECKETT AND MYSTICISM Beckett's agnosticism is offset by a curious and contradictory fascination with the mystical traditions of the Western Middle Ages. Deeply influenced by Thomas ? Kempis, Beckett yet remained skeptical: his fictional persona, Belacqua, calls himself a dud mystic, a John of the Crossroads; early intimations are parodie; Murphy's "necessary journey" is toward an inner darkness; Watt's attempt to "eff the ineffable" is disastrous; quests in the Three Novels and Texts for Nothing end in an impasse; and How It Is concludes that the impulse toward the light is finally "all balls." Even so, elements of mysticism are manifested in such themes as the "voice" and the "Not-I"; in touches of gnosticism that inform Krapp's Last Tape; in the spectral imagery of "Ghost Trio"; and in the late "closed space" prose. These testify to a lasting legacy of mysticism in a major twentieth-century corpus of religious writing. Like Belacqua in the short story "Yellow,"1 Samuel Beckett might have described himself as "a dirty lowdown Low Church Protestant high-brow" (172), whose religious upbringing left an indelible mark on his character and writings long after he had lost, or failed to find, his own Protestant faith. An early photograph, recalled in Film (43), depicts a child kneeling on the veranda, hands clasped in prayer. A later novel, How It Is (15-16), recalls this moment, and his mother's eyes burning down on him when he looked up. Memories of bedtime prayers in an early poem, "Serena II," in a first novel, Dream of F air to middling Women,1 and in the later autobiographical Company recall a childhood in which religion was part of everyday life. Yet Beckett told Tom Driver in 1961 that he had no religious feeling: "Once I had a religious emotion. It was at my first Communion. No more." In crisis, it had "no more depth than an old-school tie" (Driver 1979, 220). Thus Belacqua notes that his first communion had come and gone, leaving in his breast "a void place and a spacious nothing" (Dream, 185); while Krapp recalls going to Vespers in his short trousers, going to sleep, then falling off the pew (Krapp's Last Tape, 9). 28</page><page sequence="2">Vol 30, #2-2, March/June 2004 These reactions may be autobiographical, yet Beckett's religious sentiments are better described not as atheism but as a complex agnosticism that invariably found expression in the symbols and rituals of Christianity.3 His casual dismissal of these as a familiar mythology is too easy. Asked by Charles Juliet in 1977 if he had rid himself of the influence of religion, Beckett replied enigmatically that outwardly, perhaps, but "pour la reste..." (Juliet 1995, 167). Echoes of religious commentaries, wide-ranging biblical allusions, and a curiosity about Scholasticism and the theological impasses of seventeenth-century rationalism all testify to his lasting fascination with religious matters and their paradoxes, even as these precluded the simple affirmation of any system of belief. Despite Beckett's apostasy, there remains in his writing a concern with the mysteries of faith and their expression in the Western tradition. In the early 1930s he read Dean Inge's Christian Mysticism (1899), entering extensive citations into a private notebook.4 He later told Charles Juliet that he liked the mystical spirit, the flame that "burns away filthy logic" (Juliet 1995,167). Inge defines mysticism as "that dim consciousness of the beyond, which is part of our nature as human beings," arising as we try "to realise, in thought and feeling, the immanence of the temporal in the eternal, and of the eternal in the temporal" (Inge 1912,5). He equates this with the voice of God, stressing that at "the apex of the mind" there is a spark consubstantial with the Deity (7), the "F?nkelein" (divine spark) of Meister Eckhart (156). Inge insists that mysticism is reason applied to a sphere above rationalism (21), and that to believe otherwise is to suppose an irrational universe (which no rational man can do). He further notes: "The Atomists, from Epicurus downwards, have been especially odious to the mystics" (22). Beckett, an irrationalist of the atomist persuasion, has Belacqua describe himself to one "Mr Beckett" as a dud mystic, a John of the Crossroads, a borderman (Dream, 186). Although Beckett in the 1930s read Thomas ? Kempis's The Imitation of Christ, he remained skeptical. Mystical intimations in Dream are mostly mocking; Murphy's "necessary journey" is toward an inner darkness rather than the light; and Watt's attempt to "eff the ineffable" is disastrous. Each quest in the Three Novels (Molloy, Mahne Dies, The Unnamable) and Texts for Nothing ends in an impasse: the Unnamable's aporetic "I can't go on, I'll go on" and the narrator's recognition in "Text 13" that he must return to the dust from whence he came5 anticipate the conclusion of How It Is, that the impulse to seek the light is finally "all balls" (an ultimate reductio of God as a sphere whose centre is everywhere and circumference nowhere). Yet Moran's chronicle begins and ends (Three Novels, 92,176) with "It is midnight," which echoes "Faith is midnight" from 29</page><page sequence="3">+ Mystics Quarterly Inge's discussion (225) of St John of the Cross and the Dark Night of the Soul; and if hope deferred in Waiting for Godot denies redemption Beckett's curious and contradictory attraction to mystical speculation remains. This manifests itself in such themes as the "voice" and the "Not-I," in the touches of gnosticism that inform Krapp's Last Tape,6 in the spectral imagery of "Ghost Trio," and in the late "closed space" short prose, which reflects the mind's attempt to become entirely passive and receptive, thought and reflection turning on itself?a condition of quietism. In such matters Beckett's "curious and contradictory" fascination with the mystical traditions of the Western Middle Ages finds expression. JOHN OF THE CROSSROADS Beckett's early modus operandi was to read for the sake of his writing, entering details into his notebooks ("note-snatching"), and weaving them into his works, often ticking them off as he did. Inge's Christian Mysticism was one such source, entered into the Dream Notebook in the proximity of Thomas ? Kempis and St Augustine but alongside notes about degeneration, flagellation, and onanism.7 Belacqua's mind, entombed then surging in a rhapsody of energy, is described in Dream (17): That was the circular movement of the mind flowering up and up through darkness to an apex, dear to Dionysius the Areopagite, beside which all other modes, all the polite obliquities, are the clockwork of rond-de-cuirdom... the tilted brain flooded no doubt with radiance come streaming down from the all-transcending hiddenness of the all-transcending superessentially superexisting super-Deity. This is St Bonaventura^ apex mentis (Inge 1912,7,360; DN, 98), the doctrine of the spark ("F?nkelein") within the mind consubstantial with the uncreated ground of the Deity, paraphrased by Beckett as the "organ by which the personality communicates with God &amp; knows Him" (DN, 100).8 Dionysius the Areopagite was a follower of Paul (Acts 17:34); a Syrian monk attached the name in pious fraud, 400 years later, to some theological tracts that form a remarkable synthesis of Christian, Jewish, Greek, and Oriental teaching, which in turn influenced Meister Eckhart. These assert life ascending from its lower forms unto the divine source by the circular movement of the mind (Inge 1912,108; DN, 98-99). Inge cites "all-transcending superessentially superexisting super-Deity" (106) as typical of the "barbarous jargon" of Dionysius. 30</page><page sequence="4">Vol 30, #1-2, March/June 2004 Belacqua tries to define beauty, thereby missing the point (as the narrator superciliously comments) that beauty is not subject to categories (Dream 1992, 35): As all mystics, independent of creed and colour and sex, are trans-elemented into the creedless, colourless, sexless Christ, so all categories of beauty must be transelemented into yours. Take it, deary, from us: beauty is one and beauties uni generis, immanent and transcendent, totum intra omnia, deary, et totum extra, with a centre everywhere and a circumference nowhere. This is misquoted from Inge (257; DN, 101), where the Church Father Theophylact says that we are " transelementated into Christ." Inge's "totum intra omnia .. . et totum extra," paraphrased by Beckett as "immanent and transcendent" (DN, 99), refers to Bonaventura's definition of God as "sphaera intelibibilis, cuius centrum est ubique, et circumferentia nusquam" (Inge 1912,35).9 The careless transcription reflects Beckett's attitude; like comments include Plato's dismissal as a "Borstal Boehme" {Dream, 234), from Inge's comment (278; DN, 101) that Boehme lacked only learning and the gift of clear expression to become a German Plato; mockery of "the Great Dereliction" {Dream, 6,185), St Teresa's loneliness when abandoned by God (Inge, 221; DN, 100); and the "consonantal adjustment" of St John's "Dark Night of the Soul" to "Dark Shite of the Hole" (Inge, 224; DN, 101), to facilitate the hypostatical enema, cause of Teresa's post-evacuative depression {Dream, 185).10 Something emerges from the juvenile jesting. If Dream is the expression of one with nothing to say but the itch to make (Beckett's later dismissal of his early work), the close reading of Inge and other mystical sources (Jeremy Taylor was another) prepared the way for Beckett's life-long theme, the sustained exploration of inner consciousness. Another point of departure was Descartes and the cogito. According to Windelband (1914, 211), Beckett's frequent source, dualism is the expression of an inner discord running through the Greek and Roman worlds (and beyond), in the opposition of the sensuous world of the perishable to a supersensuous world of the divine. Augustine regarded the soul as immaterial, man as the union of body and soul, that union an incomprehensible enigma, and the psychomachia or battle between good and evil (light and dark, God and Satan) its expression (the gnostic elements a lasting Christian legacy). Dualism denotes the body-mind problem, the Cartesian crux. According to Descartes, the mind is a thinking thing (res cogitans), while matter is an extended thing (res extensa); 31</page><page sequence="5">+ Mystics Quarterly each is sui generis with respect to the other, so what is spatial is not conscious, and vice versa. Hence a dilemma: how can two such incommensurates interact? Descartes answered with an equal paradox: animal spirits, he asserted, mingle in the pineal gland, or conarium, it being the nature of such entities to affect both kinds of substance. The Occasionalists rejected this, if only because substances that are sui generis cannot (ipso facto) interact. Murphy's attitude is a supreme irony in a novel predicated on that very question: "The problem was of little interest" (Murphy, 109). But for Beckett the problem was of lasting interest, in works as various as Murphy and Krapp's Last Tape, as well as in texts like Still, where the Cartesian divide is re-centered as a schism in language. The early writing, culminating in Murphy (1938), maps the "Beckett country" and the route to be taken thereafter. Broadly, the Christian mystical tradition with its goal of spiritual enlightenment and metaphor of ascent to the light offered Beckett a paradigm for the inverted journey of his various protagonists toward their inner darkness. His early writings are the arena where he disputed with Descartes, whose cosmos is governed by laws that are clear and distinct. Accordingly, the right pursuit of Reason is the highest activity of the immortal soul, leading to the love and understanding of God; in Windelband's terms (209), Reason is at once nous (mind) and physis (nature). Beckett's quarrel was with this rationalist tradition, rather than the mystical one. Michel Fromaget (2002) has affirmed the presence in the writings of Meister Eckhart, St Teresa, and St John of the Cross of a three-fold anthropological model (body, soul, and spirit), in contrast to the binary model (body, soul) that was the consequence of Cartesian dualism. Beckett expresses a similar concept in the tripartite minds of his two early characters, Belacqua and Murphy.11 Parallels to his three zones may be variously adduced: classical doctrines of the tripartite soul; mystical divisions of the soul into its sensitive, rational, and spiritual components (Beckett noted from Inge (224-27; DN, 100) St John of the Cross's three divisions of the Dark Night of the Soul: Sense, Mind, and Will); Dante's Divine Comedy; Spinoza's three levels of knowledge, the third identifying the self with the intellectual love of God; Leibniz's distinction between the unconscious realm of confused perception, the conscious realm of clear perception, and the self-conscious realm of apperception; and Schopenhauer's manifestation of the Will in accordance with the three forms of space, time and causality. The tripartite division is incommensurate with Cartesian dualism, and thereby critiques the Rationalist tradition. Beckett had not yet read Meister Eckhart (as he did in later years), but the incommensurability of the tripartite and binary models, more or less as 32</page><page sequence="6">Vol 30, #1-2, March/June 2004 identified by Michel Fromaget,12 was fundamental to his sense of the inward journey. Before that can be considered, however, a critical change of "faith" must be noted. THE ROOTS OF QUIETISM'5 In the early 1930s, at the instigation of his friend, Thomas MacGreevy, Beckett read Thomas ? Kempis, The Imitation of Christ, in the earliest English translation edited by John K. Ingram.14 He took extensive notes, often paraphrasing rather than copying; Latin citations indicate that he also had an unidentified original to hand. The archaic flavor of the Middle English attracted Beckett, and borrowings are scattered throughout his early work. Belacqua likens Lucien's appropriation of "Black diamond of pessimism" (from Gerard de Nerval) to "the little sparkle hid in ashes, the precious margaret" (Dream 1992,47-48; III.lx; Ingram, 140), and accuses d'Annunzio of having no style, of lacking "the sparkle, the precious margaret" (Ill.xxxvii; Ingram, 108).15 Gide is dismissed as "swine's draff" (Dream, 46), as in "I sawe hem delite in swynes draf" (III.xv; Ingram, 83), empty husks of grain, lees left after brewing, fit only for feeding to swine. "Draff" is the final story of More Pricks than Kich (1934); Beckett wanted to use the title for the entire collection, but his publisher, Charles Prentice, demurred, finding it obscure. One enduring motif was "Laetus exitus tristem saepe reditum paret," that "A glad goinge oute ofte tymes bringith furthe a sorful comyng home, and a glad wakyng ouer even bringith furthe a sory mornyng. So euery flesshly ioy entrith in plesantly, but in the ende he bitith and sleeth" (I.xx; Ingram, 25). Beckett records this (DN, 83), uses it in Dream (16,129), and recycles it in "Ding-Dong" (37),16 the protagonist's transfiguration on his return "very nearly the reverse of the author of the Imitation's 'glad going out and sad coming in'." An early poem, "Sanies I," turns on the laetus exitus theme, a bicycle ride moving from all heaven in the sphincter (going out), to disillusionment in love (coining home). The motif describes Rosie Dew's sad return from Hyde Park (Murphy 1957, 103). After he bought from Jack Yeats, for ?30 that he could not afford, a Sligo skyscape called "Morning," Beckett described his elation as "always morning, and a setting out without the coming home."17 Watt's increeping and outbouncing house and parlor maids (50) reverse the sentiment; but in "From an Abandoned Work" (1954) Thomas's precept of joy and sorrow defines unhappiness at home, the narrator's life ordered by the daily journey and return, "in the morning out from home and in the evening back again" (159). 33</page><page sequence="7">+ Mystics Quarterly What endured from the Imitation was a movement toward the "Internus homo" or "inward man" (ILI; Ingram, 41; DN, 83), whose acquaintance Beckett henceforth cultivated. In the Dream Notebook (85) Beckett boxed two citations purporting to be from Thomas:18 "Qui melius seit pati majorem tenebris pacem. Iste est victor sui et dominus mundi, amicus Xti et haeres coeli" (Il.vi; "He who knows the secret of enduring will enjoy the greatest peace. Such a one is master of himself and of the world, a friend of Christ and an heir of heaven"); and "Nolle consolari ab aliqua creatura magnae puritatis Signum est" (Il.iii; "To desire no comfort from any creature is a sign of great purity"). Both appear in Dream (226, 194), but in a remarkable letter to MacGreevy (10 March, 1935) Beckett adds: "the lovely per viam pacis ad patriam perpetuae claritatis" (the Middle English "by the wey of pes to the cuntrey of euerlasting clennes" (150; DN, 86)), noting that these were phrases made for him. Yet they "conduced" to an irritation: what was one to make of "seldom we come home without hurting of conscience" (I.x; Ingram, 11), "the glad going out &amp; sorrowful coming in" (I.xx; Ingram, 25), and "be ye sorry in your chambers" (I.xx; Ingram, 25)? His was "but a quietism of the sparrow calm upon the housetops?the solitary bird under the eaves" (IV. xii; Ingram, 276); an "abject self-referential quietism" compared with "the alert quiet of one who always had Jesus for his darling" (Il.xi; Ingram, 49). Beckett defines himself as one who, lacking any facility for the supernatural, had tried to replace the terms used by Thomas with others: "I replaced the plenitude that he calls 'God', not by 'goodness' but by a pleroma19 only to be sought among my own feathers and entrails." He doubted he was any more capable of approaching the hypostases and analogies "meekly, simply &amp; truly" (I.v; Ingram, 7) than when he first "twisted them into a programme of self-sufficiency." Any attempt to read "goodness &amp; disinterestedness" for "God" would be to assert the accidental for the essential, to mince the text to allow for the skeptical position, and to replace a principle of faith, "absolute &amp; final," by one "personal &amp; finite of fact." He cannot see how "goodness" could be a foundation of anything, or that "disinterestedness" could relieve "the sweats &amp; shudders &amp; panics &amp; rages" of the irrational heart, simply because his motives are unselfish and the welfare of others his concern: "Or is there some way of devolving pain &amp; monstrosity &amp; incapacitations to the service of a deserving cause? Is one to insist upon a crucifixion for which there is no demand?" Beckett links his physical symptoms with feelings of arrogance that had characterized his dealings with others, until his "old internal combustion heart" brought him to an awareness of mortality. His treasuring of "fatuous torments" 34</page><page sequence="8">Vol 30, #1-2, March/June 2004 and sense of being the "superior man" were part of the same pathology; he could not see how this allowed of any "philosophical or ethical or Christlike imitative pentimenti" (remergence of a design painted over), nor how these might redeem a composition invalid from the word go. This implies a rejection of Thomas, yet Beckett's is less a rejection of the Imitation than of its Christian dogma. The feeling that emerges from this "heart-felt" response is a reluctant acceptance of the way, that of the solitary sparrow, mapped out by Thomas. That he could not believe in it (impossibile est) was no more of a paradox than his feelings for the seventeenth-century rationalists whom he loved but in whom he no longer had faith. Having denied the efficacy of the Imitation as solace, and turning into himself, Beckett nevertheless affirms how much the text has influenced him, the ostensible denial of its ethic negated by the recognition of a change in his innermost being. Beckett was then immersed in the writings of Arnold Geulincx (1624-69), an Occasionalist follower of Descartes, whose "Ubi nihil vales, ibi nihil velis" ("Where you are worth nothing, there you should want nothing"), the central teaching of the Ethica, became the foundation of doubt and "b?tisement" in his own work. The Ethica is a book of Cardinal Virtues, virtue assuming for Geulincx love of right Reason leading to God, and so contrasted with Philautia, or love of the Self. The virtues defined as Cardinal are Diligentia, listening to the voice of Reason; Obedientia, compliance with the dictates of Reason; Justitia, to will no more nor less than Reason dictates; and Humilitas, the sense of one's lack of worth before God. This latter is the ethical core for Geulincx, as it would be for Beckett. It has two parts, each reflecting the Delphic Ipse te nosce, "know thyself": inspectio sui, looking into the self; and despectio sui, contempt of the self. Both reflect the ethical axiom: Ubi nihil vales, by looking one realizes one's essential lack of worth; ibi nihil velis, by so doing one is led to despise the material world (having inspected, one sets at naught). The further consequence (Ethica, 225) that, as a result of self-inspection and the discovery that one is worth nothing, one has no value until dead ("ex Derelectione me") defines the precise metaphysical being of Beckett's derelicts. Thomas ? Kempis and Arnold Geulincx are reconciled in their renunciation of the will and affirmation of humility. Thomas's "in cubilibus vestris compungimini" (I.xx; translated by Beckett as "Be ye sorry in your chambers," though Ingram has "If thou hertly be compuncte, entre into thy pryue closet"), resembles Geulincx's retreat into the little world of the mind, where alone freedom is possible. Thomas's retreat to his "celle wel continued" where "In silence &amp; quiete profiteth 35</page><page sequence="9">+ Mystics Quarterly the deuote soule" (I.xx; Ingram, 25) has affinities to the Aristotelian tag Beckett admired, "Sedendo et quiescendo,"20 and to Murphy's rejection of desire as he enters his mind. Beckett, rightly or wrongly, saw Thomas as a forerunner of Quietism, an ascetic doctrine teaching that man's chief duty is the contemplation of God, or Christ, to which end he must become independent of circumstance and sensual distraction. For Thomas, as for Geulincx, renunciation of the human will permitted God's will; for Beckett this remained problematical. Nevertheless, the Imitation deeply influenced his thought. He was attracted by its self-effacement, its modesty, the uncomplaining acceptance of pain, and the enchantment of the writing. Where Beckett parts from Thomas, as from Augustine, Descartes, and Geulincx, is at the point of transcendental validation. That departure is not a simple affair. Thomas's quietism is implicit not only in the unflinching acceptance of "the ingenuous fibres that suffer honestly," as Beckett had written in an early poem, "Casket of Pralinen," but in the enduring impulse towards the "pryue closet." In his cubicle Thomas in silence and in quiet could profit his soul, his withdrawal from "seculer noyce" permitting God to "nye unto him" (I.xx; Ingram, 25). For Beckett, God was not an option, and the impulse toward the realm of calm was thwarted by his sense of a "meaningless voice which prevents you from being nothing" (The Unnamable, 370), the indistinct but insistent presence of "an ancient voice in me not mine" (How It Is, 7). This, the major theme of the middle works, rises directly from the impulse toward quietism and solitude of the early years. THE NECESSARY JOURNEY James Knowlson's Damned to Fame (1996,179) has identified the Imitation as one of several forces that transformed Beckett from an "arrogant, disturbed, narcissistic young man" to one later noted for "his extraordinary kindness, courtesy, concern, generosity, and almost saintly 'good works'." Attracted to quietism, Beckett was not unaware of its consequences. Anticipating his later cultivation of stillness, he noted in 1937 that the "necessary journey" was illusory ("How can one travel to that from which one cannot move away?"), and that the figure of Murphy, tied to his chair, was a materialization of self-bondage, "acceptance of which is the fundamental unheroic."21 Some clarification is necessary. In the rationalist tradition, whereof Descartes acts as emblem, the soul seeks God by cultivating the highest activity of the mind; in the mystical tradition the seeker gains an enlightenment not of this world, and returns to communicate it to others. For 36</page><page sequence="10">+ Vol 30, #1-2, March/June 2004 Murphy the "necessary journey" is into his own dark, where, loving himself, alone he can be free; but a "deplorable susceptibility" to ginger biscuits and Celia (179) holds him in the Big World of the body and prevents his retreat into the little world of the mind. Murphy discovers in his confrontation with Mr. Endon that he cannot take the final step into the microcosmic world because (and only Beckett could have come up with this twist) the cost would be his sanity. This is a price he is not prepared to pay, for if he cannot apperceive himself then he no longer exists?an antinomy to which Beckett returned in Film. Murphy's crisis is an expression of the ignorance and impotence that Beckett would make increasingly his own. As he stated in 1977: "Negation is no more possible than affirmation... It is impossible to protest, and equally impossible to assent" (Juliet 1995,165). In 1989, discussing Joyce's heroic achievement, Beckett commented: "That's what it was, epic, heroic, what he achieved. But I realised that I couldn't go down that same road" (Knowlson 1996,105). The fundamental unheroic, which denies transcendental validation in favor of apperception (but thereby embraces failure), offered Beckett a way of accommodating the ethic of Thomas and Geulincx to the exigencies of a contingent world. The aesthetic is one with the ethic. Beckett's reaction to Joyce reflects a desire to escape the heroism of language in Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, those endless echo-chambers of resonance, metaphor, and connotation, in favor of the attempt to write "without style." The two writers share a love of demented particularity, but for Beckett particulars lacked the Joycean luminosity; they were the flotsam and jetsam of existence, straws a desperate mind might clutch, but any bricks built from them an imponderable. Beckett distrusted both the epiphany and the Proustian moment?a secular manifestation of a mystical intimation that constituted for Proust the redemption of lost time, and which for Joyce validated the activity of the artist as priest of the imagination, transforming the bread of everyday reality into the sacred body of art (significant details orchestrated to initiate an illumination). This does not mean that for Beckett the mystical experience was unreal: Part 1 of Watt concerns Arsene's "short statement" (39 63) in which he attempts to explain the day when, sitting in the sun, watching the warm bright wall,22 he experienced a sense of change, hymeneal, uncertain ("I trust I make myself clear"), as something "slipped"; he felt that he had been transported (43); that what was changed was existence off the ladder;23 that a change other than a change of degree had taken place (44); as to what reality it might correspond he could not say; but in his opinion it was not an illusion, though he is buggered if he can understand how it could have been anything else 37</page><page sequence="11">+ Mystics Quarterly (45). Both ideal and real, the moment nevertheless differs from those of Proust and Joyce, in that Beckett refuses to validate it as having any significance. The experiential reality is not in dispute, but any endorsement of its transcendental value is ruthlessly withheld. Instead, Beckett offers the metaphor of the mind as a country, as in the 1947 poem, "bon bon il est un pays," a celebration of the realm of the mind and a grumble about the lack of time to explore it. The poet engages an external consciousness ("bon bon": all right, all right), at whom the grumble is directed ("vous voulez que j'aille d'A ? je ne peux pas" ("you want me to go from A to well I can't")).24 He pleads to be left in the mind, to explore its traceless bounds, but is forced out to comment: "oui oui c'est une belle chose que vous avez l? une bien belle chose." The work of the other is acknowledged as a fine thing, but reluctantly, its tangibility an admission he does not care to make. Such reluctance embodies the central tension: his mind is "un pays," a country, with its own reality; he wishes to be left to its solitude, retreating from the macrocosm which, nevertheless, intrudes on that space, asks questions, makes demands; he seeks finally its "calme." This is the realm sought by Malone in Three Novels (1999,198): "beyond this tumult there is a great calm, and a great indifference, never really to be troubled by anything ever again." It echoes Thomas ? Kempis's "post temptestatem, magna serenitas," serenity beyond the tumult of the mind. The fiction of the next two decades traces the "necessary journey" that had to be undergone to attain that inner realm. TO EFF THE INEFFABLE In a note to his early poem, Whoroscope, Beckett claims that Descartes "proves God by exhaustion." The phrase is used of a circle with an inscribed polygon; the area of such a figure, be it triangle or chiliagon, can be calculated. The more complex the polygon the closer it gets to the circle's area, but, however exhaustive, the method leads to approximation only. Likewise, the infinitesimal gap between God (as perfect circle) and reason (ratio) remains inscrutable. Molloy, lost in the dark wood, determines to be as firm and resolute as possible, and invokes Descartes's example from the M?thode, Part III, the traveler lost in a forest who finds his way out by proceeding in a straight line (Three Novels 1999,85). Molloy's head being full of useful knowledge, he knows the fallacy of this, that one so doing goes round in a circle. He therefore tries to go in a circle, hoping thus to achieve a straight line, a strategy meeting with limited success in that he did not 38</page><page sequence="12">+ Vol 30, #1-2, March/June 2004 trace a circle, "and that was something." He refines the method by altering course with every three or four jerks, permitting him to describe, "if not a circle, at least a great polygon, perfection is not of this world" (90). The episode parodies the rationalist "proof by exhaustion." Beckett often referred to the "gulf," his metaphor for the incommensurability of the finite with the infinite, for the disjunction between esse in intellectu and esse in re, of subject and object, or self and world. To cross that gulf, in Arsene's terms, is to eff the ineffable. Beckett was attracted by what he termed "the Dives Lazarus symbiosis";25 the story (Luke 16:22-26) of the rich man, Dives, who, cast into hell, looks up to see the beggar, Lazarus, carried into Abraham's bosom; he cries for mercy, but is told that Lazarus will be comforted and he tormented, and of the great gulf fixed between them. This became for Beckett a parable of the preterit (those passed over) and the saved (goats and sheep, or the two thieves of Waiting for Godot). Watt parodies the logic of the Cartesian Method, working from the cogito until all is known, including, Descartes affirmed, the existence of God. Watt seeks to understand his master, Mr. Knott, but fails to cross the gulf between them. Knott is a God-figure, and the novel forms a frustrated allegory of mankind's quest for salvation (question and answer reduced to fundamental sounds: What? Not). It is cast in Christian terms, although the manner of Mr. Knott's rising and retiring suggests he might be a sun-god, a notion not pursued. A related theme is prominent: Arsene's attempt to eff the ineffable (62) has failed, and Watt's world becomes unspeakable (85). Arsene describes his late employer (57) as "one who neither comes nor goes," but rather abides. Yet he asserts: "Yet come he did once, otherwise how would he be here, and go sooner or later I suppose he must, though you wouldn't think it to look at him."26 Watt is his witness, albeit an imperfect one; for Mr. Knott needs the succession of servants that he might be witnessed, and thus not cease to be. This inverts Berkeley's percipi, as Watt may not appreciate. Watt's "ancient error" is to suppose he might comprehend his master's essential being by his accidental qualities, which he labors to understand. This is to prove God by exhaustion, using the Cartesian Method, moving from the known by rational enumeration until all is clear and distinct. The consequences are tragic: having left Knott's house, little wiser than when he entered and otherwise impoverished, Watt reaches the end of the line, and finds asylum, not in Abraham's bosom nor Mr. Knott's dwellings, but in the mad-house, the 39</page><page sequence="13">+ Mystics Quarterly "mansions" of Bedlam. The one time Watt sees his master face to face, like Adam in the garden (146), Knott's eyes are closed, and the experience is "as it were in a glass," i.e., darkly. The narrator ("Sam") touches the heart of the matter when he comments that the only way to speak of nothing is to speak of it as though it were something (Augustine's dictum that one cannot know what God is, but only what he is not), just as the only way to speak of God is to speak of him "as though he were a man, which to be sure he was, in a sense, for a time" (77); which, with what is called elsewhere an anthropomorphic insolence, Beckett is doing. IN QUEST OF NOTHING In his "German Letter" to Axel Kaun (9 July, 1937) Beckett uses the phrase "Literatur des Unworts" (Disjecta 1983,54), seeking Fritz Mauthner's "gottlose Mystik" that might transcend the limits of language, but avoiding the method of Joyce and others trying to achieve the Apotheosis of the Word. He sees that endeavor "in the sense of the Scholastics" as a kind of Realism (maintaining the ideal existence of genera and species), and suggests the need for some form of Nominalist irony (universals with no corresponding reality either in or out of the mind). Windelband notes (1914, 296) that the metaphysics of individualism that accompany such a theory of knowledge assert that only particulars can be regarded as truly real (he invokes Roscellinus); this is a position that Beckett accepted. The Nominalist irony required is thus one that acknowledges the immediacy of "demented particulars." Such scholasticism constitutes the background from which the voice emerges in Beckett's great writing of the middle period. A "literature of the unword" would constitute an erasure of verbal being through which (negation as cancellation rather than denial) the unsayable or unspeakable might yet be heard. This is the countersign to Beckett's statement in "Three Dialogues" (Disjecta 1983,139), to the effect that there is nothing to express, together with the obligation to express. It leads to what Carla Locatelli has termed "unwording," the via negativa that begins because escape from language is felt as an imperative. Yet "unwording" proves that escape is impossible. Just as the tropes of negative theology are structured on negative predication and characterized by a rhetoric of aporia, evasion, and denial, Beckett's linguistic processes of erasure and erosion have a perlocutionary effect, which Locatelli describes as an "impotence potential" and offering an "inanity challenge." That is, Beckett unveils the efficacy of demented particulars and fundamental sounds so as to constitute from the very love of 40</page><page sequence="14">+ Vol 30, #2-2, March/June 2004 them an "inane" (or "antic") dynamic that is far from nihilism or surrealism, but is rather grounded in the attempt to work through language to something beyond, a mode S. E. Gontarski has called "the intent of undoing." Examples may be selected at will: Moran's "It is midnight. The rain is beating on the windows. It was not midnight. It was not raining" (Three Novels 1999,176); the Unnamable's "I shall have to speak of things of which I cannot speak" (291); his use of "inexistent" (304); his final "I can't go on, I'll go on" (424); the voice "in me not mine" of How It Is (7); the discourse of "Text 11": "Name, no, nothing is namable, tell, no, nothing can be told." Questions abide as to the kind of virtual reality created through such nominalistic irony of negation and aporia; whether any presence exists behind the denials of being (surely no ontological referent); and whether, in the words of the "German Letter," it is something or nothing that begins to seep through. A thousand years "on" and the Nominalist-Realist debate is as unresolved as ever. Negative theology affirms that since God is exalted above all it can be said of Him only that he has none of the finite predicates known to human intelligence; hence "no name names him," and "we can predicate of God only what he is not" (Windelband 1914, 237, 290). Hence Watt's vain attempts to exhaust the possibilities of what Mr. Knott IS: Watt encounters only his accidents, which are ever-changing, and knows nothing of his essence. The deity, in this conception, is above reason and being; "it has no determination or quality, it is 'Nothing'" (Windelband 1914, 335). In other words, it is "Knott." Being and knowledge are one; the God who is and knows creates out of nothing the creatures whose Ideas He knows within Himself, for this knowing is his creating and the process of self-revelation belongs to His essence. Hence Spinoza's intellectual love, by which God loves Himself (Murphy 1957,107). This conception of God passed from Greek thought through Philo to the Gnostics and early Christian apologists, including Augustine; it informed medieval scholasticism in the writings of Duns Scotus, Meister Eckhart, and Nicolaus Cusanus, and in the "extreme theophanism of William of Champeaux" (Murphy, 81), for each of whom the via negativa of mysticism is the way by which the soul might know God. The docta ignorantia, the stripping off of knowledge so that the deity as Nothing might be apprehended as a not-knowing, is the first step along the way to non-being, toward the Not-I. Beckett's rejection of "the loutishness of learning" (see his 1932 quatrain, "Gnome"), his stripping of the self in Three Novels, and his necessary journey towards minimalism testify to his partial acceptance of the negative way. 41</page><page sequence="15">+ Mystics Quarterly Beckett's post-war fiction offers a sustained assault on such mysteries. In brief, Molloy's two sections (one Jungian, the other Freudian) reduce the Cartesian self to the condition of Lear's unaccommodated man; Mahne Dies constitutes an interlude wherein narrative ploys are also discarded; from Malone's death, a monstrous breech-birth, the Unnamable is born, to struggle to comprehend the mysteries of the "Not-I" and "Voice." The search for the voice and self resumes in the 1950s Texts for Nothing, Beckett's dismissal of these as failures testifying to their lack of resolution rather than any lack of narrative subtlety. That search continues in How It Is (1961), where everything is reduced to fundamental sounds and the condition of mankind to a necessary journey through the mud, the rock below and the light above, with a consciousness ultimately denied its metamorphosis and so doomed to "peter out" (all puns intended), to return to the mineral state from which it somehow arose. The period embraced by these supreme fictions is also that of Beckett's most celebrated drama, but for all its radical theatricality the drama is thematically more conservative. For example, the play "Not-I" caused a sensation in 1972 with its neo-surrealist, m?tonymie stage image, a pair of spot-lit lips eight feet above stage level (Mouth), and a ghostly figure who makes four brief movements "of helpless compassion" (Auditor). The audience experiences less the sense that "she" has a story to tell than the tension between the speaking voice and the "I" of identity or consciousness; but this assault on the unity of self was a theme that Beckett had been exploring in the fiction for more than twenty years. "Not-I" is one of his important motifs, with its aetiology in sources as various as Schopenhauer, Nordau, and St Paul. One of Paul's preoccupations is the question of scriptural authority, in particular, by what authority he speaks. His clearest statement is 1 Corinthians 15:10: "But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain ... yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me." This is echoed by Jacob Boehme in De signatura rerum to those critical of his revelations: "Not I, the I that I am, knows these things, but God knows them in me." For Beckett, the words are less a revelation than a metaphor, but they define a voice not that of the self, the comings and goings of which remain a presence (and mystery) in the later works, even after the nameless protagonist of How It Is, trapped between unconscious rock and prescient light, with a sense of himself as perhaps the sole elect, rejects them as a delusion, like everything else "all balls." 42</page><page sequence="16">Vol 30, #2-2, March/June 2004 The attempt to deconstruct, to decompose, to hear and to identify the voice is the incessant concern of this fiction. If "bon bon il est un pays" dramatizes the mind as a place, a location, to which the poet retreats to seek "le calme," then the voice disturbs that peaceful prospect because it constitutes a different imperative.27 The quest for the self is equally a quest for the voice. Molloy intuits the inner voice when he hears the voice of a world collapsing endlessly (Three Novels 1999,40). He chooses not to listen to that whisper, but it is not a sound like other sounds; "it" stops when "it" chooses, and he will hear it always, though it does not suit him to speak of it at this moment. The Unnamable will speak of nothing else. Molloy hears "the small voice" (59) telling him to take his crutches and get out; and he obeys. It tells him (65) that his region is vast; and he acknowledges (86) that he is subject to its imperatives. The voice telling him to leave the forest is a murmur, "something gone wrong with the silence" (88); but at the critical moment (91) he hears a reassuring voice: "Don't fret, Molloy, we're coming." This suggests Matthew 14:27 or Acts 23:11, the voice of the Lord saying "Be of good cheer"; and it anticipates the Pauline voice heard by the Unnamable. Moran undergoes a like experience. Obliged to "see about Molloy" (92), he hears the silence "beyond the fatuous clamour" (121), and a voice that needs no Gaber (the "messenger" from "Youdi," boss of the "organization") to be heard, one within, ambiguous and not always easy to follow, one he is just beginning to know, but one that he will follow "from this day forth, no matter what it commands" (132). Tomorrow, he adds, he may be of a different mind; and, sure enough, he later recounts (169-70) how he first heard that voice (giving orders, a voice without), but paid it no attention. At the end he returns to the voice, getting to know it better, beginning to understand what "it" wants. It tells him to write "this report" (ambiguous and not always easy to follow), which is equally the novel just concluded and the two volumes to come. Malone represents the author who tells stories to pass the time and creates puppets through which he may be heard, but his compulsion towards identity will be stripped away in the endeavor to isolate the unaccommodated voice. Malone can "play" (180), but soon he will find himself alone in the dark. Stories, objects, inventories: he must divest himself of these, little by little, in order to fail, to reach the great calm (198). He hears "noises" (206), but has lost the faculty of "decomposing" them. The voice manifests itself in this text less directly than in those flanking it, but Malone's sense (233) that "it's coming" (death, the voice), like the images of St John that frame the story, cries the way of one to come. 43</page><page sequence="17">+ Mystics Quarterly This is the Unnamable. Like John (14:10), he must speak of things of which he cannot speak; like Paul (1 Corinthians 15:10) he invokes an authority not his own; like Job (7:11) he must speak in the anguish of his spirit; and like Jeremiah he will utter his lamentations. He distinguishes between the self that "utters" and the "not-I," which is not so easily identified. This is implicit in "These things I say" (301), which echoes John 5:34: "these things I say, that ye might be saved"; in the paradox of "this voice that is not mine, but can only be mine"; and in the voices "woven into mine" (309) that must continue to utter, to invent, in order "not to peter out" (307), or go silent (310). If the voice is not renewed, it will disappear (309). His puppet, Mahood, tells his tale, then is silent, "that is to say his voice continues, but is no longer renewed" (325). The narrator is surrounded with murmurs, vociferations, the "burden" of which is "roughly" that he is alive (335). The problem is defined: "if I could only find a voice of my own, in all this babble" (338). Mahood and Murphy sometimes spoke, "but it was clumsily done, you could see the ventriloquist" (348). Yet there is another sound that never stops (349), forcing the recognition that he is in a head, a skull, assailed with "noises signifying nothing" (351). If only the voice would stop (364), what could be worse (a soprano perhaps), he's in a dungeon (369), an oubliette, with a voice that never stops, he wishes it would stop, this blind voice, "this meaningless voice which prevents you from being nothing" (372). His agonies culminate in a remarkable passage, accentuating the contrast between "my voice" and "the voice" (393-94), the gendered euphony in the original French (177) between "Ma" and "La" rendering the difference more poignant. The Unnamable hears the voice failing, fears he is going silent, listens, intimates the real silence, then as he pauses for air listens for his voice in the silence. It returns ("elle revient"), and with renewed breath he moves toward the end. Yet the conclusion is inconclusive, the nature and location of the voice at the end as much a mystery as it was in the beginning. Consider the sub-atomic imagery that governs the novel, the Cartesian "I," that old stable ego (egg, atom) of self split to reveal a quantum world in which the voice may be heard but not located, or located but not heard, and in which the very attempt to "id-entify" it is necessarily frustrated. Such uncertainty (in Heisenberg's sense) suggests why the novel must end in an impasse. The Texts for Nothing try to move beyond the impasse, to resolve the dilemma of a voice within that is equally the voice without. They rehearse the "old aporetics," asking, "what would I say, if I had a voice" (Text 4) only to conclude, "this voice cannot be mine." Text 5 strains for a voice "not from without," but fears it might 44</page><page sequence="18">Vol 30, #2-2, March/June 2004 be "the voice of reason" (118), different from "all these voices, like a rattling of chains in my head" (120). Awareness of "that other who is me" in Text 8 makes it difficult to accept "this voice as mine"; but Text 10 seeks "a voice of silence, the voice of my silence" (again, the disjunction between "la voix" and "ma voix"). The "vile words" of Text 11 make him believe he's here, "a head with a voice belonging to it" (145); for "a voice speaks that can be none but mine" (146); but in Text 12 it's "not me" ("Not-I" in the accusative). The final text affirms, "Weaker still the weak old voice that tried in vain to make me"; and comes to a partial resolution, "nothing but a voice murmuring a trace" (152). The "trace" is both poignant and ephemeral, a tiny flurry of dust disturbed by the movement of air, evidence of the voice that was but cannot endure, or that is but cannot cease, set against "black nothing" (154). How It Is tells of one who crawls through the mud, encounters a fellow, Pirn, "couples," then departs. It asserts three of Beckett's certainties, birth, existence and death: "before Pirn with Pirn after Pirn" (7); then introduces a fourth, the voice that was "once without" and then "in me," "an ancient voice in me not mine." Before Pirn the voice is "afar" (13); "changeable" (15); "barely audible" (23); "not mine" (40). With Pirn, attention moves to the other; Pirn's voice is "extorted" (21), but his is not that ancient voice the narrator seeks. Part 2 ends by restating the voice "in me that was without quaqua," but introduces "the voice of us all" (99), to be examined in Part 3. The narrator is either "sole elect" or there are others; but when the voice comes back "at last" (106), it manifests itself as that of the self alone, just as the possibility of the many is ruthlessly reduced to knowledge of the one. The given is the solitude (129), and the voice that recounts it is the sole means of living it. His life comprises "bits and scraps strung together" (133) by "an ancient voice ill-spoken ill-heard." The only conclusion (134) is that "my life" is constituted by "a voice without" (ill-spoken, ill-heard), now "in me in the vault bone-white" (ill-heard, ill-murmured). This is not an advance on The Unnamable, nor even on the opening of this novel, because no advance can dispute the logic (139) that has reduced "this anonymous voice self-styled quaqua the voice of us all" to the "single voice" within: "this voice quaqua yes all balls yes only one voice here yes mine yes" (144-45). The echo of the end of Ulysses ("and yes I said yes I will Yes") invites a rejection of univocality (Molly affirms Bloom as other; intertextuality implies "company"), but here there is finally "only me yes alone yes with my voice" (146), for that is how it is. 45</page><page sequence="19">+ Mystics Quarterly TOUCHES OF GNOSTICISM For the skeptic, the most disturbing feature of Waiting for Godot is not the significant absence of Godot, nor hope infinitely deferred, but rather the arrival of the boy at the end of each act. The boy reports that Mr. Godot cannot come today but he surely will tomorrow. He looks after the sheep, he says, and his brother the goats. Beckett wished him to look as angelic as possible (Gk angelos, "a messenger").28 Dramatically, he is crucial since he appears just as the spectators may feel that Godot is an illusion and the tramps' appointment a delusion. In his 1961 interview with Tom Driver Beckett mentioned the two thieves, one saved and one damned, and asked: "have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology?" If there were only darkness, all would be clear; but because there is also light the situation becomes inexplicable. He compared Augustine's doctrine of grace with the destiny of Ph?dre, which is sealed from the outset: she will proceed into the dark; she may be illuminated, but unquestionably she moves into the dark. For him, neither Greek nor Jansenist, there was not such clarity: "The question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary?total salvation. But where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable. The key word in my plays is 'perhaps'" (Driver 1979, 220). Even as Beckett rejected illumination, gnostic touches manifested themselves in some of his dramatic works and in his rare comments upon these. Gnosticism arose in the third century, Alexandrian neo-Platonism combining with Manicheism (of which Augustine was briefly an adherent) to accentuate the strife of opposites (good and evil, light and dark, soul and body). Beckett's attraction to Gnosticism is revealed in his reading of the Confessions, his delight in troubadour verse (steeped in the Cathar heresy), and his fascination with dualism. Krapp's hast Tape exemplifies such gnostic principles as the separation of light from darkness, the rift between God and the world, and abstinence from sensual enjoyment.29 Its setting, a pool of light surrounded by the dark, intimates a cosmic conflict, with images of a woman (Bianca) in black and white, a black ball given to a white dog, and a black waistcoat offsetting Krapp's soiled white shirt. Beckett noted: "Krapp decrees physical (ethical) incompatibility of light (spiritual) and dark (sensual) only when he intuits possibility of their reconciliation as rational-irrational" (Krapp's Last Tape, in Knowlson 1992, Plate 47). He is guilty of intellectual transgression, as the duty of reason is not to join but to separate light from dark. Beckett's 1969 production accented this dualism, which seems not to have been a lasting element of his thought. 46</page><page sequence="20">+ Vol 30, #2-2, March/June 2004 Yet while it lasted Beckett's attraction to Gnosticism invested some of his works with an unusual intonation. The Carlton Lake Collection at the Harry Ransom Center, Austin, has a file labeled "SB to Mania P?ron" 1-40, acquired in 1999 and described as "R?my Alfred P?ron material," but consisting mostly of postcards and letters (1954 to 1983) to Mania.30 File #19 contains a card dated "12.6.70" and a one-page typescript commenting on Waiting for Godot. There is no assurance that the commentary is by Beckett, as its tone and style seem at odds with anything he might have said about his play; indeed, it would be a unique and unlikely testament. The typescript stresses the mind's perception of the "miracle" of the leaves appearing on the tree. It identifies a gnostic dualism, man as body and spirit, an invisible God and the boy (his messenger) as hope, but hope that is always falsified. Other characters are discussed in similar terms. Nowhere else does Beckett speak this way, but given that all else in the file is his no alternative source is obvious. The matter awaits resolution, but if the letter is Beckett's and dates from the late 1960s then it attests to a brief and largely unrecognized flowering of gnosticism in his thought at this time. Closer to Godot is the spectral presence of the boy in "Ghost Trio" (1975). In Part I, the solitary figure (F) thinks he hears "her," looks into the mirror, and stands before it with bowed head, the Voice (V) registering surprise. Part III (Direction 24) cuts "to close-up of mirror reflecting nothing"; then (27) a close-up of F's face in the mirror; these moments are crucial as anticipations of the apparition (or mirage) of a small boy in the corridor opposite. This offers an enigmatic suggestion of another dimension, a virtual image the more astonishing for being so unexpected, hinting at an inexplicable beyond, as seen through a glass, darkly. Similar intimations are felt in "Nacht und Tr?ume" (1982), where Schubert's music plays and the light fades down on A, the solitary dreamer, until the words "H?lde Tr?ume," when it fades up on B, the dreamer's dreamt self, sitting on an invisible podium, four feet higher and to the right. A hand ("L") gently rests upon B; another ("R") appears with a cup (a chalice?), and gently wipes his brow (the Veronica?); raises his right hand to meet R, and L reappears to rest gently on his head. The dream fades as A awakens; but when the music begins again the sequence is replayed. "Nacht und Tr?ume" offers a stage icon rather than the mystical experience of "Ghost Trio"; but the two wordless dramas share a sense of "unspeakable" intimations beyond, expressible only in music (Beethoven's trio and Schubert's song). 47</page><page sequence="21">+ Mystics Quarterly THE WAY The title of Beckett's television play, "... but the clouds..." (1976), derives from Yeats's The Tower, the moving description of old age as the poet decides that it is time to "make" his soul, when all that is left is intellect and feeling, the body fading but the mind yet aware. In the short fiction of the 1970s, narrative movement gives way to stasis; the setting is the "closed space" (a distillation of Thomas ? Kempis's "pryue closet"); and the subject is the solitary mind communing with itself in the dying of the light. In Still (as in "As the Story was Told," "Heard in the Dark 2," "Sounds," "Still 3," "Stirrings Still," and parts of Company),31 the eye adapts to the darkness, yet "stillness" is impossible to achieve as the mind yet moves and the body cannot quite cease its activity, hands trembling and breast faintly rising and falling. A condition of tranquility is approached, if not attained, the delicate prose rhythms ("So quite still again then all quite quiet") imitating the failing light and growing stillness?when "suddenly" (splendid hyperbole!) something happens: the right hand, and with it the forearm, slowly rises. This movement constitutes a return to Geulincx, whose dictum Ego non faci? id, quod quomodo fiat nescio ("I do not do that which I do not know how to do") is illustrated by this very act: if "I" do not know how that movement is initiated, then "I" do not cause the arm to rise. Yet the miracle of motion has occurred, and ended, and now all is "still once more." Still is analogous to the dramaticule, "Breath" (1969), in which coming and going into the faint light is reduced to its fundamental sound, that of movement in the silence. A final parable: Beckett's "The Way" is an unpublished, enigmatic prose-poem, the first draft dated "Ussy 14.5.81."32 It offers a paysage symbolis?, featuring "the way": journey 6 miles, time 6 hours, foot to peak 2 miles (Beckett's note). The route describes an 8, symbol of infinity (early drafts are subtitled "8"), from foot to peak then down, one way only, "on is back and back is on," crossing at the halfway point, thorns (tokens of a fallen world), half-light, loose sand underfoot: "so no sign of remaining no sign that none before. Not one ever before so?" A marginal note "Gideon" suggests the "sign" (Judges 6:17) of one talking to the Lord; but the route as much as the title implies the Tao. It retraces (more soberly) a path taken fifty years earlier in Dream (226), where Belacqua following "the way he had chosen" finds that the line of the drink graph loops on itself "like an eight"; if you did not end up where you started, coming down you met yourself going up. As Carlton Lake concludes: "And here, in one short piece?'The Way'?is the distillation of all the journeys made by all of Beckett's eternal wanderers" (Lake 1984,174 (#434)). 48</page><page sequence="22">+ Voi 30, #1-2, March/June 2004 ^^^^ It would be misguided to conclude that Beckett was somehow a closet convert, for his world is intractably one of pessimism, absurdity, irrationality, and despair. Nevertheless, a sustained mystical miserere sounds through his corpus, which, despite its adamant refusal to accept the consolations of faith, constitutes a remarkable body of religious writing. He is best located outside the mystical tradition, to which, like Socrates, he is inextricably bound. The comparison is not casual, despite Socrates7 affirmation of the soul's survival after death (something Beckett occasionally contemplated with horror), for they are alike in two important ways. The first is Beckett's espousal of ignorance and impotence (but only after years of intense study) and the reluctant recognition by Socrates that perhaps he knew more than his fellows, for, unlike them, he knew that he knew nothing. The other is more intricate. Socrates was a man of deep piety and mystical temperament; his life was regulated, he claimed, by an inner voice, neither an intuitive conscience nor a mental disorder, but a kind of interior auditor. Beckett believed in neither the immortal soul nor providential order; but to the three certainties of having been born, existing, and knowing he must die he added a fourth, as inexplicable as it was imperative: the need to express, a need driven by an inner voice that he might never understand, but which he listened to and tried to identify much of his life.

Beckett's "reference" to his unspecified Latin source seems to be inexact. 19. Defined by Inge, 81 (DN, 98), as a totality of divine attributes. 20. From Aristotle's De anima, as copied (from Paget Toynbee's Dictionary of Dante) into the Dream Notebook (44). Meaning "Seated and in quiet," it continues anima effictur sapiens, "the soul becomes wise." 21. As Knowlson indicates (1996,230), during his 1937 visit to Germany Beckett read Walther Bauer's Die notwendige Reise ("The Necessary Journey"), and entered into his German Diaries 4 (18 Jan. 1937) a critique of the figure of Murphy immobile in his rocking-chair (Das notwendige Bleiben, "The necessary Staying Put"). 22. The echo of "Yellow" (see n. 1) is pertinent; indeed, "the warm bright wall" (Watt, 42) was added late to the manuscript, presumably to intimate that echo. 23. Watt offers the jest: "Do not come down the ladder, Ifor, I haf taken it away" (44), to critique the mystical ladder by which the soul ascends, as Descartes imagined he might climb by clear and distinct degrees to truth and the knowledge of God. Inge (9-10) notes three stages of the scala perfectionis: "the first is the purgative life; the second the illuminative; and the third the unitive, or state of perfect contemplation." This is mocked by Walter Draffin's "elevated position on Saint Augustine's ladder" ("What a Misfortune," More 51</page><page sequence="25">+ ^^^^^ Mystics Quarterly Pricks than Kicks, 120); but treated with subtlety in Endgame, where Clov uses the "steps" on a day when (like Arsene) he experiences a sense of subtle change. See also Beckett's later parable, "The Lost Ones" (1966). 24. Written at the request of Geer van Velde to accompany a painting, the poem was later used as text for Avigdor Arikha: Paintings, Gouaches, Drawings (London: Matthiessen Gallery, 8 April to 2 May 1959). 25. Samuel Beckett, "Denis Devlin," in Disjecta, 91-95 (92). 26. Knott seems immortal, but only (perhaps) because he is witnessed from a different perspective. Consider two notes in the Addenda. The first (250 51) describes a second picture in Erskine's room, of a gentleman seated at the piano. Not identified in the novel, in the manuscripts he is said to be Mr. Knott's father. The second (251-53) describes an old man who recalls working for Mr. Knott's father. Watt might once have been pleased to think that Knott too was serial, "in a vermicular series" (253); but he is an old rose now, and indifferent to the gardener. This is an argument against Spinoza's God, for if He is immanent then He too must grow old and die. The serial theme in Watt, as the manuscripts confirm, came surprisingly late, given its importance in the novel and its theological import. 27. This theme is treated in more detail in the entry for "Voice" in Ackerley &amp; Gontarski, Grove Companion (2004). 28. In Endgame, the appearance of a small boy (a possible Christ-child) is regarded as a calamity. Clov's response is to get the gaff, for life could begin over again. 29. In the introduction to his Theatrical NotebooL? edition of Krapp's Last Tape, xxi xxiii, James Knowlson discusses the "specifically Manichean interpretation" (1992, Plates 43-45) in Beckett's "Schiller" production notebook (1969), and in the performances he directed. Knowlson treats these matters judiciously, and notes (xxii) that Beckett was later wary of his own Manichean reading. Even so, these notes indicate that in the late 1960s Gnosticism was a significant part of Beckett's thought. 30. Alfred Peron was a friend who died after being interned in a concentration camp; Beckett kept in touch with his widow, Mania. This typescript was first described in the entry under "P?ron Godot" in Ackerley &amp; Gontarski, Grove Companion (2004). 52</page><page sequence="26">+ Vol 30, #1-2, March/June 2004 ^^^^ 31.
