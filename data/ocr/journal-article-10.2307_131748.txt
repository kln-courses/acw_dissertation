<plain_text><page sequence="1">Positive Heroes at the Pole: Celebrity Status, Socialist- Realist Ideals and the Soviet Myth of the Arctic, 1932-39 JOHN McCANNON In the summer of 1937 the eyes of the USSR, along with those of the international community, were fixed on the frozen expanses of the Arctic, as Soviet explorers and pilots made history several times over with a series of expeditions designed to dem- onstrate their country's mastery over the top of the world. Valerii Chkalov, "the greatest pilot of our time," flew over the North Pole, from Moscow to the United States; in the process, he broke the world record for nonstop long-distance flying and became the first person to fly a transpolar route from Eurasia to America. Only weeks later Mikhail Gromov followed the same course that Chkalov had blazed over the Pole, flying to California and setting yet another world record for the USSR.1 On 21 May 1937, in an even more impressive coup, a converted Tupolev bomber from the Soviet Union became the first airplane in history to land at the North Pole. Furthermore, this exploit was only the initial stage of a larger effort: the great ex- pedition led by Professor Otto Iul'evich Shmidt to establish the world's first scientific outpost at the Pole. Over the next month the outpost, named "Severnyi polius 1" (SP-1), was constructed and placed in the care of four scientists, led by Ivan Papanin. The four "Papaninites" would remain at their station for nine months, until February 1938, when they returned to Moscow as national heroes.2 The SP-1 mission, along with Chkalov's and Gromov's transpolar flights, rep- resented the symbolic culmination of the USSR's long-standing campaign to conquer The material devoted to Chkalov and Gromov is immense.

Always a vital concern for the Soviets, the Arctic took on an overwhelming double significance during the 1930s. On one hand, the economic im- portance of the Arctic and sub-Arctic reached new heights during these years and became a matter of great preoccupation for the Stalinist regime.3 On the other, the Arctic came to play an increasingly conspicuous role in Soviet culture after 1932. As a result of the famous Sibiriakov voyage of that year and the even more publicized Cheliuskin saga of 1934-not to mention the triumphs of 1937 described above- Soviet polar explorers and Arctic pilots were, throughout the decade, figures of na- tionwide renown.4 Individuals like Chkalov, Papanin, Shmidt, and their fellows be- came celebrities of the first magnitude, and their widespread appeal made the Arctic a central, even definitive, feature of Stalinist mass culture and propaganda. It must be noted, however, that Soviet Arctic heroes were not merely passive symbols in the pantheon of Stalinist propaganda. Polar celebrities played an active role in shaping the mass culture of the USSR during the 1930s, and, like a number of Stalinist heroes, proved quite adept at defining their own place within that culture. Precisely how the Arctic heroes did this raises a number of issues concerning the underlying motifs and the manufacture of Stalinist culture during the 1930s. There- fore, this essay will first examine the thematic contribution of the Arctic to the Soviet worldview during the 1930s. It will then discuss the ways in which Arctic heroes helped create the propaganda campaign in which they themselves were symbols. Fi- nally, it will attempt to evaluate the response of the Soviet public to that campaign, which became so prevalent between 1932 and 1939. 3Politburo protocols from 1932 onward indicate that the regime was extremely interested in this question. See the Russian Center for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Recent History (RTsKhIDNI), Moscow, f. 17, op. 3. The economy of the Arctic and sub-Arctic appears in the protocols as an agenda item on a constant basis. From December 1932 to August 1938 the primary agency concerned with Arctic exploration and development was the Main Administration of the Northern Sea Route (Glav- sevmorput', or GUSMP), led by Otto Shmidt.

See Krenkel', RAEM; Boris Gromov, Pokhod "Sibiriakova" (Moscow, 1934); and Dva okeana, RGAKFD, 1-9679. The following year, Shmidt attempted to repeat the success of the Sibiriakov mission in another ship, the Cheliuskin. The vessel became trapped in the polar ice, drifted off course, and sank in February 1934. Shmidt successfully or- ganized an evacuation. After the ship went down, 104 men, women and children were left stranded on the ice, but with their tents, provisions, and radios intact. The "Cheliuskinites" remained at "Camp Shmidt" for the next two months, and their plight attracted the concern of the entire world. Finally, seven pilots managed to save all the castaways. The "Cheliuskin epic" was considered one of the greatest Soviet achievements of the decade, and the pilots who carried out the rescue were rewarded with a special medal created especially to commemorate their feat: Hero of the Soviet Union, which would become the most coveted honor in the USSR.

These high points speak for a whole mountain chain of Soviet achievements. Leon Trotsky, The Revolution Betrayed That the Arctic came to play an overwhelmingly prominent role in Stalinist propa- ganda is unquestionable. From 1932 to the beginning of 1939 the Arctic and its heroes constantly appeared in Pravda and Izvestiia. They produced hundreds of books and articles, appeared in numerous films and radio broadcasts, and inspired a multitude of poems, songs and other works. Explorers and pilots held public office and packed lecture halls with their speeches and addresses. They had their feats celebrated with lavish state rituals, and every sort of cultural ephemera-posters, currency, stamps, and schoolbooks-bore their images. In short, the Arctic and the celebrities asso- ciated with it became firmly embedded in the Soviet national consciousness during the 1930s. This took place primarily because the heyday of Soviet polar exploration coin- cided with the emergence of Socialist Realism as the officially privileged framework for public expression in the USSR. Above all, Socialist Realism was animated by a great spirit of adventure, and, beginning around 1932, titanic exploits became the centerpiece of Soviet culture. This grand epic was played out in reality as well as in arts and letters, and from its inception, Socialist Realism was more than an artistic formula or literary blueprint: it became the overarching cultural ethos of Stalinist Russia, a comprehensive worldview for the entire nation.5 The elements of Socialist Realism's thematic base are familiar: mastery over the natural world, technological progress, patriotism, relentless optimism, Stalin's cult of personality, and heroism. It was in terms of these themes that the major real-life events that became the stuff of Stalinist propaganda campaigns were presented to the Soviet public. The Stakhanovite movement, the intense cultivation of sports and physical culture, the commemoration of literary figures such as Pushkin and Tolstoy, the regime's mammoth construction projects, the glorification of aviation-all were cloaked in the trappings of the socialist-realist worldview and incorporated into the modern myth of the Stalinist era. The same took place with the Arctic. Furthermore, of all the components in- volved in the formation of Stalinist mass culture, it was perhaps the Arctic that fit most snugly into the rubric of the socialist-realist myth. The Soviet conquest of the North encompassed all the motifs listed above; moreover, it added to those themes two powerful symbols that enjoyed universal appeal. The first was the North Pole, 5 Studies that discuss real-life dimensions of Soviet culture include Jeffrey Brooks, "Socialist Realism in Pravda: Read All about It!"

The sec- ond symbol was a key element in almost all of the USSR's major Arctic exploits: aviation, one of the twentieth century's most potent expressions of modernity. Ter- rifyingly utilitarian, yet blissfully liberating, aviation became metaphorically asso- ciated with a broad spectrum of issues: age-old dreams of flight, economic devel- opment, national pride, and the specter of military destruction. As it did in Europe and America, aviation became a cultural leitmotif of enormous popularity and power in the Soviet Union, and the intimate connection between aviation and polar explo- ration served greatly to enhance the symbolic strength of the Arctic as an element of Stalinist discourse.6 Thematically, the Arctic culture of the 1930s was significant to the modern myth of Socialist Realism in several ways. For one thing, the Arctic myth provided an excellent venue for the expression of Soviet public visions of nature.7 If the renowned "struggle with the elements" (bor'ba so stikhiei) was one of the primary facets of the socialist-realist worldview, that struggle found its highest expression above the Arctic Circle. Stalinist discourse personified the Arctic, transfiguring it from a mun- dane geographical space into a tangible, anthropomorphic opponent; not only did the Arctic become the ultimate battleground in the struggle with the elements, it became the ultimate enemy as well. Secondly, the Arctic myth metaphorically ori- ented the Soviet Union's perceptions of itself and the world around it. Images of polar expeditions and Arctic settlements were painstakingly crafted to offer micro- cosmic panoramas of the model socialist society of tomorrow. At the same time, polar heroics helped the USSR to boost its prestige in international circles and enabled it to define itself as a modern nation in every sense of the word: as a country that was simultaneously peace-loving and technologically advanced, and as a mighty military power, ready to defend its borders with overwhelming force. However, the clearest and most important messages contained in the Arctic myth involved socialist-realist attitudes regarding the individual and the individual's re- lationship with the state. One of the fundamental imperatives of Stalinist culture was to provide a model of proper conduct for all Soviet citizens to emulate, and it did so in the form of the positive hero, who was the cornerstone of Socialist Realism. Arctic celebrities were prominent among these "paradigms of the New Soviet Man."8 What made the hero heroic? The defining characteristic of the positive hero in- 6 Works linking aviation with modern mass culture include Joseph Corn, The Winged Gospel: Amer- ica's Romance with Aviation, 1900-1950 (New York, 1983); Peter Fritzsche, A Nation of Fliers: German Aviation and the Popular Imagination (Cambridge, 1992); Claudio G. Segr6, Italo Balbo: A Fascist Life (Berkeley, 1987); and Robert Wohl, A Passion for Wings: Aviation and the Western Imagination, 1908- 1918 (New Haven, 1994). On prerevolutionary Russia's attitude toward aviation see Scott Palmer, "On Wings of Courage: Public 'Air-Mindedness' and National Identity in Late Imperial Russia," Russian Re- view 54 (April 1995): 209-26. In the USSR, aviation was a matter of great cultural fixation, as shown by Kendall Bailes, Technology and Society under Lenin and Stalin: Origins of the Soviet Technical Intelligen- tsia, 1917-1941 (Princeton, 1978), 381-406. Stalin's personal interest in aviation is well known, and Avia- tion Day (18 August) became one of the most important holidays in the USSR's secular calendar. 7 For a detailed treatment of this theme see my "To Storm the Arctic: Soviet Polar Exploration and Public Visions of Nature in the USSR, 1932-1939," Ecumene 2 (Spring 1995): 15-31.

In this Socialist Realism was similar to other conceptions of heroism-Stoicism, chivalry, or the "muscular Christianity" of the Victorian Era-in which it is neces- sary for the hero to be not merely heroic, but virtuously heroic. The heroic spark consists of courage and strength; it enables the hero to take superhuman risks and overcome insurmountable obstacles. But the heroic spark is not sufficient; the vir- tuous hero must also live by a strict code of conduct and strive to attain the self- discipline necessary to temper his or her heroic energy. Katerina Clark frames this near-universal myth in a Marxist context, equating the qualities outlined above with the famous dialectic terms "spontaneity" (stikhii- nost') and "consciousness" (soznatel'nost'), which are most commonly used to depict the working class on its path to political self-awakening.9 Just as spontaneity applies to the working class in its raw, untutored state-possessed of great, elemental power, but unable to use it to its full capacity-it serves to describe the heroic spark. The term consciousness symbolizes maturity. In the socialist-realist context the positive hero represents the dialectical synthesis of spontaneity and consciousness. Moreover, the personal development of the hero as he or she resolves spontaneity with con- sciousness is intended to mirror the development of socialism at large. In other words, Socialist Realism compresses the blueprint for the evolution of Soviet society into the adventures of a single person-real or fictional. This dynamic was faithfully replicated in the Arctic myth. All the polar celeb- rities of the 1930s were portrayed as paragons of this heroic synthesis-brimming with bravery and single-minded persistence, combining fearlessness with training and iron self-control. At the pinnacle of the Arctic myth, it was Otto Shmidt who ex- emplified the perfect unity of spontaneity and consciousness. The ultimate fulfillment of virtuous heroism, Shmidt joined bravery and determination with erudition, cool- headedness, and selfless dedication to the Soviet cause. In one of his essays Shmidt captured the proper socialist-realist view of heroism when he wrote that "we in the Arctic do not chase after records (although we break not a few upon the way). We do not look for adventures (although we experience them with every step). Our goal is to study the North in order to settle it economically ... for the good of the entire USSR."10 And so the synthesis was complete. In terms of their personal qualities the Arctic heroes represented the highest form of human existence, and they were held up to the Soviet public as shining examples of what every person should aspire to become. Just as important as the Stalinist hero's personal characteristics was his or her place in the Soviet scheme of things. Metaphorically the Stalinist cosmos consisted of a rigidly patriarchal pyramid, in which a hierarchy of father figures led the Soviet people, the narod. At the apex of this pyramid stood Stalin himself, the "Father of Nations." During the 1930s the Arctic heroes became the favorite sons in this "Great Family."11 9 Clark, Soviet Novel, 15-24. 10Foreword to Boris Gromov, Gibel' Arktiki (Moscow, 1932), 3-4.

It was Stalin, with his limitless wisdom and patience, who molded the character of the Arctic heroes; it was his brilliance that inspired and masterminded their accomplishments. This theme found its fullest expression in the relationship between Stalin and transpolar pilot Valerii Chkalov, undoubtedly the most beloved son in the Great Soviet Family. This symbolic kinship proceeded from cradle to grave. Like all Soviet pilots, Chkalov was one of Stalin's "falcons"-a "fledgling" (pitomets) to whom Stalin imparted fatherly guidance and discipline. The Arctic myth abounded with anecdotes about Stalin's paternal affection for Chkalov: Stalin repeatedly urges Chkalov to practice his flying; Stalin scolds Chkalov for not wearing a parachute; Stalin plots Chkalov's flight path across the Pole (the Stalinskii marshrut).'2 Chkalov returned Stalin's care with a filial love that was displayed to the entire nation. In a renowned essay entitled "Our Father" ("Nash otets"), Chka- lov spelled out his relationship with Stalin in rhapsodic terms: "He is our father. He teaches us and rears us, we are as dear to his heart as his own children. We Soviet pilots all feel his loving, attentive, fatherly eyes upon us. He is our father."'3 Stalin stood by his "son" even in death; after Chkalov perished in December 1938, Stalin gave him a funeral worthy of the highest dignitary, and even served as a pallbearer for the fallen hero, helping to lay him to rest in the Kremlin wall.'4 If Stalin was the Arctic heroes' father figure, the narod was their extended fam- ily. According to the Arctic myth, the Soviet people animated all of the polar heroes' efforts. Not only did this echo the premium that Stalinist ideology placed on the superiority of collective effort over individual achievement, but it also provided a direct link between the heroes and their fellow Soviets. In doing so, this notion also provided the Soviet people with a concrete image of what their relationship with the Stalinist state was meant to be like. If the nation's greatest heroes were Stalin's sons and daughters, ordinary men and women should conceive of themselves as his chil- dren as well. Thus was the fame of Arctic heroes spread outward to all Soviet citizens, in an attempt to create real and meaningful connections among the people, their heroes, and the state that purported to bind them all together. MYTHMAKING: ARCTIC HEROICS IN PRACTICE If you're a hero, you can be an idiot, behave badly, ruin your personal life, have any number of mistresses and talk about yourself all the time, and nobody minds. Heroes are immune. Jeanette Winterson, Sexing the Cherry Very rarely does reality translate easily into the stuff of which legends are made; such was the case with the USSR's attempts to transform the polar exploits of the 1930s into part of its modern myth. Real-life heroes and episodes could not be made to fit into the socialist-realist mold as readily as their fictional counterparts, and the 2 Izvestiia, 18 August 1938; Chkalov, Dva pereleta, 10-11; Velikii letchik, 128-29. 13 "Nash otets," Izvestiia, 18 August 1938. 14See Pokhorony V P Chkalova, RGKAFD, 1-6655; the final chapter of Velikii letchik; and Pravda and Izvestiia from 17-20 December 1938.

Yet the Arctic myth flourished, at least for the better part of a decade. That it did so can be attributed not only to the myth's inherent appeal but also to deliberate intent on the part of several parties as well. Most obviously, the Stalinist regime cultivated the myth for its own purposes, while the Soviet media did yeoman work in shaping it into a coherent set of ideas and images. Typically, most studies of pro- paganda focus upon "state" and "media," especially with regard to regimes consid- ered to be "totalitarian." There is another group, however, that often plays a crucial role in the formation of propaganda campaigns, but is frequently neglected: the he- roes themselves. Tom Wolfe has demonstrated how America's Mercury pilots, seven men with distinct personalities and (with the exception of John Glenn) fast-living, hard-drinking habits not normally associated with the virtuous hero, were trans- formed into a "goddamned amazing picture of the Perfect Pilot wrapped up in a cocoon of Home &amp; Hearth and God &amp; Flag!"15 One of the strengths of Wolfe's work is that he takes into account the ways in which the astronauts themselves took part in this mythmaking process. The same needs to be done in the context of Soviet mass culture; therefore, this portion of the essay will concentrate on the role that the polar heroes of the 1930s played in manufacturing the Arctic myth. The Arctic's potential as a publicity magnet first became apparent in 1928, when the dirigible Italia crash-landed near the North Pole. The Soviet icebreaker Krasin spearheaded the multinational effort to save the stranded crew, and the public proved quite enthusiastic about the USSR's role in the rescue. According to one newsreel, between 200,000 and 300,000 people gathered in Leningrad to greet the Krasin as it returned to port, making the usefulness of the Arctic as a propaganda instrument crystal clear.16 For the next four years, the attention that polar exploration received in the Soviet media steadily increased. Finally, in 1932, Otto Shmidt led the first single-season traversal of the Northern Sea Route in the Sibiriakov, creating the first definitive episode in the Arctic myth of the thirties. At this point, Arctic heroes started to become very much involved with the construction of the mythic environ- ment in which they existed. Some contributed to it or helped design it; others ma- nipulated it to their own advantage and, on more than one occasion, thoroughly violated its heroic ideals. Whatever the case, the two best illustrations of how polar heroes took part in the mythmaking process are the examples of Otto Shmidt and Mikhail Vodop'ianov. Chief among the polar heroes in rank and fame, Otto Shmidt, the so-called "Commissar of Ice," dominated the Arctic myth in more ways than one.17 During 15 Tom Wolfe, The Right Stuff (New York, 1979), 98. 6 Podvig vo l'dakh, RGKAFD, 1-21054. 17 The nickname "Commissar of Ice" was given to Shmidt by author Lev Kassil'. Shmidt's career was one of the most unusual in Soviet history. A mathematician and scientist of great versatility, Shmidt distinguished himself during the Civil War and the 1920s with his work in the People's Commissariats of Food, Finance, and Education. From 1924 to 1941 he served as editor-in-chief of the Bol'shaia sovetskaia entsiklopediia; in 1928 he led the first expedition to the Pamir glacier. From 1932 to 1939, Shmidt headed GUSMP and worked in the Arctic. Afterward, he became vice-president of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. He died in 1956.

V lakusheva, Otto lul'evich Shmidt: Entsiklopedist (Moscow, 1991).</page><page sequence="8">Positive Heroes at the Pole 353 most of the 1930s, Shmidt was a mass-culture icon of unrivaled stature, and his public persona, the best developed in the myth, towered above all others. As an example of the ideal union of stikhiinost' and soznatel'nost', Shmidt was portrayed to the public in a number of guises. Next to Stalin, he was the chief teacher and mentor in the Arctic myth, and a host of polar heroes claimed him as a spiritual father.'8 As one of the USSR's most versatile scientists, Shmidt was consistently depicted as a modern Mikhail Lomonosov, a new renaissance man for the Soviet era. More fanciful imagery applied as well. In keeping with the Stalinist practice of resurrecting folkloric genres for propaganda purposes, Soviet polar explorers became bogatyri, mighty hero-warriors from the distant past. Standing almost seven feet tall and sporting what was undoubtedly the most impressive set of whiskers in the USSR, Shmidt was tailor- made to fit into the roles of the giant Sviatogor or the latter-day bogatyr' "Beard- to-the-Knees" ("Pokolen-boroda").'9 Shmidt's appearance also tied in well with an even more famous alter ego, that of "Grandfather Frost" ("Ded Moroz"). During every New Year's celebration from 1935 to 1938, Shmidt became the nation's real- life holiday symbol, visiting classrooms and hospitals, posing for photographs, and endearing himself to millions of children.20 Finally, Shmidt was consistently presented to the public as being in close proximity to the sacred presence of Stalin himself; as a signal mark of honor, Shmidt became one of only two individuals ever shown em- bracing Stalin on the front page of Pravda (as a further sign of the Arctic's cultural importance, the other was Valerii Chkalov).2' If Shmidt played the leading role in the pantheon of Soviet polar heroes, he was also best equipped to manipulate the Arctic myth. In doing so, Shmidt's chief con- cern was power: power to keep his expeditions funded, power to keep his agency intact when it began to falter, and power to keep himself alive and free at the height of the Great Purges. Perhaps more than anyone else, he realized what kind of strength celebrity status had to offer, and he pursued it with energy and skill. Shmidt had a talent for show business, and he used it well. When he began his Arctic career in 1929, Shmidt invited members of the media to accompany him on polar expedi- tions and voyages; as the years passed he expanded this practice considerably. When asked why he routinely reserved such a large amount of valuable expedition space for reporters and cameramen, Shmidt replied: Our Northern expeditions are the affair of the entire country. The country follows their progress with the utmost of attention. The country wants to know-and rightly so-how we work, what obstacles we meet, and how 18 Krenkel', RAEM, 29-30; M. V.

This connection between our expeditions and the peo- ple on the mainland is an eternal source of energy and strength.22 It was a useful source of fame as well. Shmidt's real intention was to keep the agency he headed, the Main Administration of the Northern Sea Route (GUSMP), and its exploits-not to mention himself-as squarely in the public eye as possible. Not only did Shmidt encourage the production of Arctic culture, he became a part of that production as well. At his disposal was a combination of positions in the Soviet bureaucracy and a vast array of personal ties in the USSR's world of arts and letters; Shmidt had been a midlevel functionary in the Soviet elite since the days of the Civil War, and his position as head of GUSMP, which operated directly under the Council of People's Commissariats, was roughly equivalent to that of a deputy people's commissar. Moreover, Shmidt held a number of cultural posts throughout his career and belonged to Moscow's most celebrated intellectual circles. In addition to his many years on the Bol'shaia sovetskaia entsiklopediia and with Narkompros, Shmidt worked on a government commission dealing with cinema affairs, headed the State Publishing House, and served on the boards of several prestigious theaters in the capital (among them the Kamernyi and Vakhtangov). His network of cultural connections was therefore extensive and multifaceted.23 Consequently, Shmidt exerted a substantial amount of influence over the way the Arctic myth was shaped. Shmidt hand-picked many of the artists, authors, and journalists who breathed life into the Arctic myth, and a number of these individuals became dependent on him as a patron of sorts. Poets Il'ia Sel'vinskii and Sergei Semenov, for example, served as members of the Cheliuskin expedition, and both wrote Shmidt afterward to plead for money or a favorable word in the ear of "the right people." Not only did Shmidt screen many of the creators of the Arctic myth and, on occasion, play Maecenas, but a good many of the hundreds of books, songs, plays, and movie scripts dealing with Arctic exploits were submitted to him for com- ment and evaluation. Sofiia Mogilevskaia asked Shmidt to review early versions of her popular children's book on the Cheliuskin. Nikolai Aseev, Samuil Marshak, and former commissar of health Nikolai Semashko, in his capacity of director of the Chil- dren's Publishing House, along with others, petitioned Shmidt to look over drafts, include certain authors on expeditions, or transfer GUSMP personnel with literary promise to Moscow or Leningrad, where they could more easily write. Even the Arctic epics of renowned folklore artist Marfa Kriukova were forwarded to him be- fore release.24 The end result was to give Shmidt a chance to make himself one of the best- known and best-loved individuals in the USSR. In the long run Shmidt's efforts in cultivating his heroic image paid off. After its brilliant summer in 1937, GUSMP began to suffer tremendous setbacks: in August, one of its pilots, Sigismund Leva- nevskii, disappeared while trying to complete a transpolar flight; the search mission 22 Literaturnaia gazeta, 6 November 1934. 23For Shmidt's place in the cultural community of the USSR see Kul'turnaia zhizn' v SSSR, 1928- 1941: Khronika (Moscow, 1976), multiple entries; A.

As head of GUSMP, Shmidt bore the responsibility for these disasters on his shoulders, and they could not have come at a worse time. By whatever logic applied to the Terror, Shmidt should have been a frightfully conspicuous target: a former Menshevik, linked with a Trotskyite policy line during the 1920s, and in charge of an agency beset by ca- tastrophes that could easily be construed as "wrecking." But instead of falling victim to the Purges, Shmidt managed not only to survive, but to save his career. Although GUSMP was stripped of most of its power in August 1938, Shmidt suffered no ap- parent harm; in March 1939 he relinquished the leadership of GUSMP to Papanin and went on to become, until 1942, the vice-president of the Academy of Sciences. Shmidt worked actively in the fields of mathematics and planetary studies until his death in 1956. Was Shmidt saved by his prominence as a national hero? Regardless of whether Shmidt gave up his GUSMP post voluntarily or was forced out, the fact that he avoided arrest or death is remarkable. While fame ordinarily conferred little or no protection against the NKVD, the type of Shmidt's fame may have been extraordi- nary enough to make him a special case. The major Arctic heroes, Shmidt above all, seem to have possessed a certain superstar quality that made them genuinely popular as well as famous, and that popularity may have made the difference. To purge a Bukharin or a Tukhachevskii was to eliminate a figure who was well known, perhaps even respected, but not necessarily well liked. To purge a hero who was truly beloved by the entire nation and who had been built up as an embodiment of Soviet virtue would have been to rip the heart out of the very ideals upon which Stalinist culture was based. Did the regime choose to leave Shmidt in peace to avoid doing irreparable damage to the socialist-realist worldview it had labored to create? The answer is unclear.25 Either way, Shmidt's fame was anything but a liability in his efforts to come through the difficult years of 1937 and 1938 unscathed-and, by means of the Arctic myth, he had generated that fame largely through his own efforts. 251 should note that Russia's polar and aviation communities have long entertained rumors that the death of Chkalov (whose popularity equalled, or even exceeded, that of Shmidt) was not accidental, but rather arranged by Stalin. The explanation most commonly used to bolster this notion is that, in 1938, Chkalov reportedly voiced in public his opinion that Nikolai Bukharin and Aleksei Rykov, then defendants in the third Moscow show trial, were innocent of the charges being brought against them. On this see Sergei Taranov, "Valery Chkalov: Did He Have to Die?" Moscow News, 18 March 1989; and Arkadii Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor: The Life of Andrei Vyshinskii (New York, 1991), 342 n.21. This rumor remains unsubstantiated. More plausible explanations for Chkalov's death include the facts that he was a notoriously reckless and daring flier, and that the prototype of the Polikarpov 1-180 he was flying had been rushed into production too quickly (the next model of the 1-180 killed a second pilot in February 1939). Here see Chkalov's copilot, G. F Baidukov, "Esli govorit' vsiu pravdu," Vozdushnyi transport, 10-17 December 1988. Even if Stalin did have Chkalov killed, it does not invalidate the idea that genuine popularity could at least help to save public figures during the Purges. If Chkalov's death was arranged, it was done so in such a way as to preserve, rather than undermine, his reputation-a possible indication that his popular appeal had made him at least partially immune to being purged "normally." Also, Chka- lov, by all appearances, seems not to have taken nearly the same amount of effort that individuals like Shmidt and Vodop'ianov did to cultivate their public images for their own benefit. Finally, it must simply be recognized that no hypothesis about the Terror as a whole can be held up as a hard-and-fast rule.</page><page sequence="11">356 John McCannon A second Arctic hero who took his public image into his own hands was polar aviator Mikhail Vodop'ianov, head pilot for the SP-1 mission and one of the seven fliers who took part in the Cheliuskin rescue. Vodop'ianov's background, personality and approach to the Arctic myth were almost the exact opposite of Shmidt's. Before the October Revolution, Shmidt had received a first-rate education; he was cultured, fluent in several languages, and able to maneuver himself into the Soviet elite quickly and easily. By contrast, Vodop'ianov had been an illiterate shepherd before 1917. In the early 1930s, Vodop'ianov took part in several endurance flights in the Arctic, but it was in 1934, when he became one of the first Heroes of the Soviet Union for his role in the Cheliuskin epic, that he achieved nationwide renown. Vodop'ianov's attitude toward his new-found fame was anything but sophisti- cated; his main imperative was to improve his material and social position. Somewhat ironically, considering that he had not learned to read or write until the age of twenty, Vodop'ianov chose to make his mark in the field of letters. The choice proved suc- cessful, and Vodop'ianov became the most prolific writer among the Arctic heroes. Before his death in 1980 he published several dozen books, a few plays and countless essays and articles; many of his works became staples of the Arctic myth. Vo- dop'ianov told (and retold) the story of his own adventures, wrote about other Arctic exploits, and tried his hand at fiction as well. His best-known work, and the one which launched his literary career, was the play A Pilot's Dream (Mechta pilota), a fictional account of an air expedition to the North Pole, starring the semiautobio- graphical GUSMP pilot Misha "Nameless" ("Bezfamil'nyi"). Vodop'ianov com- pleted A Pilot's Dream in 1935; the script caught the attention of Mikhail Rozenfel'd, the editor of Komsomol'skaia pravda, who quickly arranged to have it published in play and novel form. The play opened in 1937 at Moscow's Variety Theater, and its premiere was timed to coincide with Vodop'ianov's real-life touchdown at the North Pole with Shmidt's SP-1 expedition on 21 May.26 At the time, popular wisdom had it that A Pilot's Dream was the inspiration for Shmidt's SP-1 expedition. This was untrue, but the play did have one lasting effect: it exposed Vodop'ianov to the literary bug, and the play's success only confirmed him in the belief that writing was the key to his future. Although Vodop'ianov had literary ambition in abundance, he had no artistic agenda to advance. His work fell solidly into the category of pulp fiction: his plots were simplistic, his characters were drawn directly from the socialist-realist stockpile of positive heroes, and his world- view was thoroughly Soviet. A Pilot's Dream fairly drips with Stalinist slogans, ritual formulas, and even excerpts from the song "Ever Higher," one of the decade's classic propaganda anthems. Again, Vodop'ianov's principal concern was personal advancement. Although his patriotism was genuine and his loyalty to the USSR unshakable, he lusted after the lifestyle that fame had to offer and believed wholeheartedly that his heroic en- deavors entitled him to it. Unfortunately, the more famous Vodop'ianov became, the more his personal conduct began to diverge from the heroic ideal set forth in the 26 M.

For one thing, it took only a short time for his literary pretensions to become an annoyance to officialdom. Convinced that he deserved to be made a mem- ber of the Union of Soviet Writers (despite his constant need for a writing coach), Vodop'ianov determined to prove his worth as an author by spending more time writing, to the point of disregarding his duties as a GUSMP pilot. He kept on writing no matter how exasperated his superiors became-the head of GUSMP's Political Administration took the matter to the highest level, complaining to Georgii Malen- kov that "all my efforts to make Comrade Vodop'ianov see reason with regard to his 'literary' activities have come to nothing."27 Even Shmidt grew weary of his com- rade's artistic exercises; when foreign reporters asked him in 1938 if Vodop'ianov's latest project, a novel about Antarctic exploration, had any bearing on GUSMP's future plans, he dismissed Vodop'ianov's writings with a discernable note of pee- vishness.28 To make things worse, Vodop'ianov's free-wheeling lifestyle caused the au- thorities no small amount of consternation. GUSMP's Political Administration found the boisterous pilot's liking for copious amounts of alcohol disturbing and felt it nec- essary to reprimand him more than once about his "unbecoming" conduct concern- ing young women. Vodop'ianov also had a distressing tendency to start brawls in public, and one of his most embarrassing moments came in December 1939, when he began a drunken fistfight with fellow Cheliuskin pilot Mavriki Slepnev at a New Year's party at the Central House of Cultural Workers.29 Vodop'ianov's round of fisticuffs with Slepnev demonstrates how he also be- came caught up in the general atmosphere of intense competition that prevailed among the polar heroes. In contrast to the image of mutual effort and comradely support portrayed by the Arctic myth, the heroes' community was a wasp's nest of betrayal, denunciation, and swollen egos. For whatever reason, Vodop'ianov and Slepnev became archenemies after the Cheliuskin adventure, and their mutual dislike manifested itself in ways far more serious than their New Year's Eve donnybrook. For months Vodop'ianov filed bitter accusations against Slepnev, apparently trying to get him demoted or even arrested. Vodop'ianov charged Slepnev with using the Cheliuskin mission solely as a means of gaining glory. His "proof" consisted of the fact that Slepnev made only one flight to the Cheliuskinites' camp, where he rescued two people-"just enough to collect his Hero of the Soviet Union award, and no more." Instead of returning to the camp, Slepnev volunteered to fly Otto Shmidt to Alaska for medical treatment, showing an "unhealthy desire to travel to America." Vodop'ianov further hinted that Slepnev had cozied up too closely to Charles Lind- bergh when the American pilot visited Moscow. He also pointed (rather hypocriti- cally) to Slepnev's "debauched" lifestyle as inappropriate for one of the seven original Heroes of the Soviet Union.30 The authorities duly noted Vodop'ianov's ac- 27 RTsKhIDNI, f. 475, op. 1, d. 16, 11. 38-39. 28ARAN, f. 496, op. 2, d. 311, 11. 1-5. 29RTsKhIDNI, f. 475, op. 1, d. 6, 11. 73-74, and d. 28, 11. 55-58; ARAN, f. 496, op. 2, d. 311, 11. 1-5. 30RTsKhIDNI, f. 475, op. 1, d. 16, 11. 38-39, and d. 28, 11. 55-58.</page><page sequence="13">358 John McCannon cusations, but never acted on them, and Slepnev went on to become head of GUSMP's Polar Aviation Administration. Despite his antics, Vodop'ianov succeeded in his fundamental goal; aside from the occasional dressing-down, he experienced almost no bumps in his path to pros- perity. After the peak of his fame had passed, Vodop'ianov served with moderate distinction in World War II, then went back to his writing. For the rest of his days, Vodop'ianov lived a life of comfort and prestige; heroism-and the Arctic myth- had been very good to him. Unsurprisingly, Shmidt was not alone in his manipulation of the Arctic myth, and Vodop'ianov's hijinks were by no means isolated. A broad spectrum of re- sponses to the mythmaking process existed among the Arctic heroes. There were a few individuals who refrained from misusing their celebrity status. Chkalov and Gro- mov seem to have been circumspect in their character and conduct. Cheliuskin and SP-1 pilot Vasilii Molokov is said to have been as humble in real life as in the Arctic myth, and GUSMP officials constantly exhorted other pilots (especially Vodo- p'ianov) to behave more like him. Ernst Krenkel', the stalwart radioman who ac- companied Shmidt on the Sibiriakov, Cheliuskin and SP-1 missions, may have been more brash and outspoken than Molokov, but was almost as scrupulous in his be- havior. One figure who managed to carve out a unique image in the Arctic myth (and one that was easier to live up to) was Ivan Papanin, the head of the SP-1 outpost and Shmidt's successor as GUSMP chief. Papanin was renowned for his puckish joviality; short, plump, and bristle-mustached, he hardly fit the heroic mold, and so he defined himself in contrast to it by lampooning heroic conventions in an earthy and self- deprecating manner. In one instance, Papanin toyed with the bogatyr' metaphor by assigning a specific folkloric identity to each of the four SP-1 scientists: Petr Shirshov became Alesha Popovich, Evgenii Fedorov was Solovei Razboinik, while the tall, rugged Krenkel' was an obvious choice for the mighty Il'ia Muromets. When he came to himself, Papanin joked that he was chubby enough to assume the role of both Ruslan and Liudmila.31 And only Papanin could reduce a roomful of reporters to helpless laughter by inspecting his crew's equipment for the SP-1 mission and dem- onstrating in graphic detail the structural difficulties the initial underwear design posed when it came to relieving oneself in the snow.32 In essence, Papanin became a jester, transforming his own personal quality of irreverence into a great joke and somehow making that joke an acceptable part of the Arctic myth. Success, however, went a long way toward spoiling many of the Arctic heroes, who frequently misbehaved, grandstanded, and shamelessly abused their good for- tune in order to line their pockets or bolster their career prospects. A number of Arctic heroes indulged in extravagant profiteering, especially on the lecture circuit, which proved to be highly, even illegally, lucrative. In one instance, Krenkel' was horrified to find that the sponsors of one engagement were offering him 450 rubles to speak when, according to the official pay scale for public lectures, Heroes of the 31Papanin, Na poliuse (Moscow, 1939), 32-33. 32 Fedorov, Polar Diaries, 205.</page><page sequence="14">Positive Heroes at the Pole 359 Soviet Union were only entitled to receive 250 rubles per address. Krenkel"s indig- nant refusal to accept such a large sum amazed the sponsors, who informed him that other Arctic celebrities had been demanding rates well in excess of 500 rubles.33 Sim- ilarly, some Arctic heroes used their fame to jockey for promotions, and a few be- came petty tyrants of the worst type in the process. In the most notorious case, Il'ia Mazuruk used his status as an SP-1 pilot to become the head of the Civil Aviation Administration (Aeroflot); almost immediately upon arrival, Mazuruk began to browbeat his employees mercilessly, harassing them with such ominous remarks as, "I will have you shot," or, "How would you like me to acquaint you with Yezhov?"34 That the behavior of Soviet Arctic heroes so often fell short of the heroic ideal put forward by the socialist-realist myth says much about greed and cynicism. At times, it is a source of amusement. Most important, it highlights a key fact about the nature of celebrity in Stalinist Russia. By the time the Arctic myth reached the Soviet public, the polar heroes of the 1930s were already essentialized and packaged as iconic figures, reduced to a set of standard Soviet virtues and one or two individu- alizing attributes. But in real life, they were flesh-and-blood human beings who re- fused to allow themselves passively to be absorbed into the Arctic myth without their needs and desires being met. Therefore, they became factors in the actual creation of the myth, not just emblemic elements within it. Most of the Arctic heroes simply demanded that they be permitted to benefit from their mythic status; a few, such as Vodop'ianov and Shmidt, took a hand in manufacturing the myth themselves. What- ever the case, all the Arctic heroes left their own imprint on the worldview that their exploits helped to define. POPULAR RESPONSES TO THE ARCTIC MYTH Dearest Professor Shmidt!

How closely did the Soviet public identify with the polar heroes of the 1930s? This question is difficult, since answering it in- volves an attempt to reconstruct the prevailing attitudes of a large, heterogeneous society that had limited opportunities for self-expression. By all indications, however, ordinary Soviet citizens found the heroes of the Arctic genuinely appealing. This should come as no surprise; the conquest of the poles was one of the modern age's hallmark enterprises, and millions of people world- wide had thrilled to the exploits of polar explorers for more than a century. It was only natural that Arctic adventures should resonate with the Soviet public; a sub- 33RTsKhIDNI, f. 475, op. 1, d. 28, 11. 55-58. 34Ibid., d. 21,11. 22-23. 35 L. A.

Admittedly, some of this material is of only limited usefulness. Any instance of positive reaction to the Arctic myth that became part of the public record stands some chance of having been altered or completely contrived by the media. Therefore, popular accounts of children playing at being "Cheliuskinites" or "Papaninites" are suspect, as are letters published in mass papers such as Pravda or Izvestiia. Likewise, the hundreds of peasant verses (chastushki) said to have been composed to celebrate polar exploits, such as the following, are not wholly dependable, despite claims that they were collected and documented by professional folklorists: I will hug Baidukov, When I finish school, brothers, I will kiss Chkalov, I have a plan prepared: Around Beliakov I will sail on an icebreaker I will tie a crimson ribbon. Across our Arctic Ocean.36 Such evidence, however, cannot be rejected out of hand. Exaggeration and distorted contextualization, rather than complete untruth, are the trademarks of most effective propaganda campaigns; the examples above were most likely based upon some ker- nel of truth, however small. And even if all were completely faked, it is possible to interpret them as the media's attempt to amplify and broadcast sentiments that were actually present, rather than as total deception. The fact that there are more trustworthy expressions of positive response to the Arctic heroics of the thirties helps to bear this argument out. After many interviews during his visit to the Soviet Arctic, Times (London) reporter Harry Smolka observed that "a Russian schoolboy will dream of [his country's polar explorers] as a French child dreams of Napoleon or an Australian boy of Bradman."37 At least one child was the unlucky victim of excessive enthusiasm about the Arctic. Author Lev Uspenskii recounts the story of the hapless Lagshmivara, a young girl whose parents made her a "living monument" to the Arctic by naming her after Camp Shmidt (LAGer' SHMldta VARktike-A).38 Papanin enjoyed telling the story of how popular outcry played a decisive role in the fate of the SP-l's canine mascot, Veselyi. During his months on the ice, Papanin developed a deep dislike for the dog, and so, upon returning to the mainland, he decided to donate Veselyi to the Moscow Zoo. Veselyi, however, had become dear enough to the public that general indignation compelled Papanin to change his plans and present the dog to Stalin as a pet.39 Even more solid as an index of popular response to the Arctic myth is the torrent of letters written by the public about it. Certainly, letters published in newspapers and other media were routinely screened and edited. But hundreds of unsolicited (and unaltered) letters reached GUSMP or the heroes themselves, and they are ex- tremely helpful in gauging how the public felt about its nation's exploits at the Pole. 36 Flora Leites, ed., Stalinskie sokoly (Moscow, 1939), 199; Sovetskaia Arktika (April 1936): 54. 37 H.

A number of them, however, demonstrated an extraordinary level of excitement and concern. Some people wrote to recommend ideas or offer their assistance; a Moscow rail worker was so moved that he begged GUSMP to "please let me help in the rescue!"41 One of the most unusual letters came from a Minsk agronomist, who proposed a "straightforward and infallible plan" to save the stranded explorers.42 He suggested that the rescuers simply walk from the Chukchi coast to Camp Shmidt over the frozen ocean. To avoid losing its way the search party would set up a signal marker after each kilometer and take readings every twenty-two kilometers, at which point it would also build a "mod- est" supply base, equipped with sleeping bags, food and huts for shelter. Precisely how this "medium-sized" party was supposed to navigate by dead reckoning through the storms of an Arctic winter, much less haul supplies sufficient to provision a small army, all over uneven terrain, was an issue the earnest young agronomist failed to address. The folly of the scheme aside, however, the letter reveals an avid preoc- cupation with the Arctic, if not a terribly impressive understanding of it. As the most overpowering presence in the Arctic myth, Shmidt naturally at- tracted a great deal of attention. American journalist Ruth Gruber discovered the extent of Shmidt's appeal during her travels in the USSR. During an overnight stay on a journey from Moscow to Sverdlovsk, Gruber shared a dormitory room with a young Russian woman. The girl reacted to Gruber, an obvious foreigner, with sus- picion, until shown the letter of conduct Shmidt had written for her: I showed her Shmidt's letter of recommendation. The young woman acted as if she had seen the Holy Grail. I had a letter from Otto Yulevich. I was sacrosanct. "But did you meet him personally?" she asked a little breathlessly. "Yes." "Is he really as handsome as his picture?" "More so." She was my good friend now.43 Shmidt received literally thousands of letters, from all over the Soviet Union. Most were sent by young people, with whom Shmidt seems to have been particularly popular, and the letters tend to follow one of several patterns.44 The author is typically anywhere from grade-school age to the mid-twenties. The younger the writer, the more he or she is simply thrilled with the glamor of "talking" to such a famous celebrity; a few even address Shmidt as Ded Moroz. Older writers are interested in learning how to become polar scientists or explorers; many are in complete earnest and include credentials with their letters. Both boys and girls express a strong interest in working in the Arctic; a number of the girls appear to be equally interested in 40 See the Russian State Archive of the Economy (RGAE), Moscow, f. 9570 (Northern Sea Route), op. 2, dd. 37, 39, 46. 41 Ibid., d. 37, 11. 194-95. 42 Ibid., 11. 174-75. 43 Ruth Gruber, I Went to the Soviet Arctic (New York, 1939), 27. 44Most of these letters are located in ARAN, f. 496, op. 3, d. 364.</page><page sequence="17">362 John McCannon Shmidt romantically-the letters leave no doubt that the tall, heroic Commissar of Ice set a number of hearts aflutter. Shmidt often referred fondly to his young correspondents, remarking in one interview that, "I cannot help but be touched every time I receive a letter that goes something like this: 'Comrade Shmidt, please take me to work in the Arctic. To serve in the Arctic has been my lifelong dream-and I am already 19 years old!' "45 Shmidt seems to have answered personally as many letters as he could. His usual reply in- cluded a tactful apology that GUSMP had more than enough explorers at the mo- ment, and he encouraged those who wrote him to study diligently or become pen- pals with the many GUSMP personnel stationed in remote outposts. Not all public responses to the Arctic myth were positive; tracing unfavorable feedback is difficult, but it did exist. A Leningrad schoolboy drew the NKVD's at- tention by spreading politically dangerous doggerel: "They've killed Kirov, They've sunk the Cheliuskin, Maybe they'll kill Stalin too."46 An even more interesting case involved an anonymous ditty known as "Song of the Cheliuskin." The verses poked fun at the Cheliuskin epic, reminding the listener of the fundamental reality that the ship's voyage had resulted in a colossal blunder and that, in return for simply waiting to be rescued, the crew had been showered with great rewards. One version of the song went: Greetings, Levanevskii, greetings, Liapidevskii, Greetings, Camp Shmidt, and farewell! How did this affair take place? The Cheliuskin sank. Perhaps they were drinking vodka? They took off from Leningrad and got their rewards. What was so bad for them on the ice? What did they lack? They had cheese, butter, preserves, and sausage. What was there to stop them from calling up Vankarem and sending to the Central Committee for more? Shmidt sat on his ice-floe, safe as in his feather-bed. If not for Mishka, Mishka Vodop'ianov, You would never have seen your native Moscow again. You wouldn't have heard all the greetings, You wouldn't have gotten all the gifts. And now the heroes live quite well- A little money in their pockets, their faces on the big screen.47 The "Song of the Cheliuskin" circulated widely; the version above was collected by the authorities in Arkhangel'sk. Other variations surfaced throughout the country, with minor alterations in the text. 45 "Molodezh' mechtaet ob Arktike," Komsomol'skaia pravda, 27 April 1936. 46Central State Archive of Historical-Political Documents, St. Petersburg (TsGAIPDSP), f. 24, op. 5, d. 47, 1. 18.

And this is the crux of the matter in terms of the impact that the Arctic myth had on the Soviet public at large. In his classic treatise on modern means of mass persuasion, Jacques Ellul argues that propaganda is "an organized myth that tries to take hold of the entire person . . . [and] has such motive force that, once accepted, it controls the whole of the individual."4 But the evidence given above indicates that the Arctic myth did not match Ellul's vision of an Orwellian device, enthralling the Soviet public and instilling within it a blind, subservient obedience. Neither did the socialist-realist worldview in general. Propaganda is no easy mat- ter of simple or programmatic compulsion; there are definite limits to what it can do. The "magic bullet" theory of mass media, which postulates that media messages can be tailored to have predictable effects on the members of an entire population, or even a specific demographic group, has been discredited time and again.49 In the Soviet case, the Harvard Interview Project of the 1940s showed that the individual response of the Soviet citizen to the media was far more complicated than complete acceptance or outright negation; as onie interviewee remarked, "I taught myself to translate the lies of the press into my language of relative truth."5? Even so, propaganda is not without its effects. "When one reads [something so egregious] once, one smiles," Ellul astutely points out, but "if one reads it a thousand times, and no longer reads anything else, one must undergo a change."51 Here lay the fundamental strength of the Stalinist regime in crafting the Arctic myth: the state could not control how people reacted to the symbols and myths it sponsored, but it could manipulate and control the symbolic environment that was available to people. This in itself had its own effect; as Peter Kenez notes, "the Soviet people ultimately came not so much to believe the Bolsheviks' world view as to take it for granted."52 This represented a victory of sorts for the state, but not a complete one. Fun- damentally, the Soviet public appreciated the Arctic and its heroes. Did it appreciate, or even grasp, the set of messages and values encoded within the Arctic myth? In some cases, yes; in some, no. Either way, the public was still able to enjoy the heroics. Whatever it thought of the Arctic myth, the Soviet public, on the whole, took pride in its country's triumphs in the Arctic and felt much affection for its polar heroes- all without necessarily equating it with affection for the Stalinist regime. EPILOGUE The grandeur of the Arctic myth began to die away not long after the glorious summer of 1937. The first signs of the approaching decline came before the year was out.

Instead, the ill-fated Levanevskii vanished without a trace after crossing over the Pole. The disappearance triggered an inter- national search effort that continued until May 1938, but resulted in nothing but frustration and the death of Mikhail Babushkin, one of the USSR's first and most experienced Arctic aviators.53 In addition, the early formation of heavy pack ice para- lyzed almost the entire GUSMP polar fleet in the autumn of 1937. Eight of GUSMP's nine indispensable icebreakers were trapped in the Arctic Ocean, and not until the beginning of 1940 was the last of the stranded ships freed. Further embarrassments dogged the Soviets in 1938. Although the Papaninites returned in triumph from their North Pole outpost in February, the Soviet Union lost the world record for long-distance flying to an English bomber crew in November. And in December the worst of all possible disasters occurred: while testing a new aircraft at a Moscow airfield, Valerii Chkalov crashed and died in the blaze. In Au- gust 1938 three female aviators-Valentina Grizodubova, Polina Osipenko, and Marina Raskova-managed to set a world record for women's distance-flying by pi- loting the Rodina from Moscow to Khabarovsk, but this did little to revive the flag- ging fortunes of the Soviets in the Arctic.54 The Arctic myth finally sputtered to a halt in 1939. The USSR's only major polar exploit of that year came in April, when Vladimir Kokkinaki tried to regain the long- distance record by flying through the Arctic from Moscow to the World's Fair in New York. The episode turned into a humiliating farce, as Kokkinaki was forced to make an emergency landing in Canada. No one aboard was seriously injured, but Kok- kinaki's pride was severely bruised as he arrived at the fair's Soviet Pavilion as a passenger in a chartered cargo plane.55 The only polar "exploit" to follow Kokki- naki's debacle was the return of the icebreaker Sedov, the last of GUSMP's castaway ships, in January 1940. The regime's intention here was to create another Cheliuskin epic by transforming catastrophe into victory (as well as to showcase the USSR's newest icebreaker, the 10,000-ton Stalin, largest in the world), and the Sedov drifted into port amid a thoroughly artificial orgy of self-congratulation.56 If the Arctic myth was fading away, however, the root cause was not the dis- tressing string of failures that prevailed after 1937. Instead, it was something far less dramatic: the inescapable fact that polar exploits were falling out of touch with the public spirit. By 1938 the USSR was gearing up for war in earnest; Soviet troops had already clashed with Axis forces in Spain and Manchuria, the Munich Conference 53 Iu. P.

The "northern" aspect of the flight was not as important as the actual aviation; also, Stalinist discourse, against its own professed ideals, tended to bar female heroes from the highest tiers of celebrity status. 55 "Moscow to Miscou," Time, 8 May 1939; Brontman, Vladimir Kokkinaki (Moscow, 1939). 56 V Kh.

The changing times called for the Soviets to channel their national pride away from civilian exploits toward martial pursuits, and there proved to be no place for the Arctic myth in the new worldview that took shape in the USSR during the years immediately preceding World War II. But even though the Arctic myth ceased to be a central part of the socialist- realist worldview after 1939, it had made a permanent, unforgettable impact on So- viet culture. For the Arctic myth proved to be one of the most successful propaganda campaigns of the prewar Stalin period, if not the history of the USSR itself. This popularity derived from the fact that the Arctic myth tapped deeply into a set of symbols and motifs that were universally compelling: the polar exploits of the 1930s became an element in a continuum of heroic episodes which allowed the Soviets to underpin their entire history with a framework built wholly out of grand adventures and cosmic struggles. And what person, from the humblest of citizens to the highest of national leaders, could resist being part of a nation of heroes? Purposely or not, the Arctic myth became one of the few discursive arenas in which the intentions of the state, the efforts of the media, and the desire of the public came at least somewhat close to actual convergence in Stalinist Russia.</page></plain_text>
