<plain_text><page sequence="1">Questions of Method: Some Unpublished Late Essays K. K. COLLINS IN APRIL 1930 Sotheby's auctioned a number of George Eliot's manuscripts belonging to John Walter Cross's niece Elsie Druce. Among them was a notebook containing "three short phil- osophical essays, apparently unpublished, without headings."' Sandwiched between a thick book of quotations and the long note- book including "Three Months in Weimar" and "How I Came to Write Fiction," the item escaped notice in the Times Literary Sup- plement's report of the sale.2 Twenty-five years later the notebook surfaced again, when Parke-Bernet auctioned the rare books and manuscripts of the New Jersey collector Saul Cohn.3 At this time, it was added to the Morris L. Parrish Collection of Victorian Novelists of the Princeton University Library, where it has since lain unpublished.4 ? 1980 by The Regents of the University of California 0029-0564/80/040385+21$00.50 1 Sotheby's auction catalog, 17 Apr. 1930, No. 912. 2 "Notes on Sales: Burney, Austen and Eliot," TLS, 24 Apr. 1930, p. 356. 3 Parke-Bemnet Galleries auction catalog, Saul Cohn Books Part 11, 18 Oct. 1955, No. 28. 4AM 15538; see Alexander D.

[385]</page><page sequence="2">386 Nineteenth-Century Fiction Now in a blue cloth slipcase, this quarto notebook is bound in limp black leather, its spine stamped GEORGE ELIOT-MSS.- THREE ESSAYS in gold. It has eighty-two leaves, twenty-three ruled lines to the page; George Eliot's writing begins on the second leaf recto and continues on one side only for seven more leaves, the remaining ones being blank. Although the notebook is undated and the paper without watermarks, the small, neat handwriting and the page size are characteristic of George Eliot's Middlemarch and Daniel Deronda, composed 1870-76.5 The essays are written in very dark brown, almost black ink, which suggests a date before mid-1872, when George Eliot began to use purple ink regularly.6 Internal evidence, however, indicates composition no earlier than 1874. The first essay almost certainly responds to a number of works published from 1854 to 1872 by Herbert Spencer, Friedrich Max Muller, Edward B. Tylor, and John Fiske. The latest date on which George Eliot recorded reading one of these works is August 1874, though she might have read it as early as 1865.7 The title "Three Essays"-Sotheby's, not George Eliot's-is misleading, since the second one, hereafter referred to as a note, comprises only three sentences. George Eliot frequently kept small notebooks to record comments, reflections, quotations, or queries as she read.8 This particular notebook, however, unlike many of her other ones, has a single continuous subject: social evolution- ism, or the theory that societies evolve progressively according to uniform general laws. Whatever their precise date, the two essays and note take a relatively modern 'perspective upon this prevalent strain of nineteenth-century thought. They offer a shrewd, skep- tical evaluation of assumptions and methods that dominated the social science of George Eliot's day. 5 For this point of information and others I am grateful to Gordon S. Haight. 6 Jerome Beaty, "George Eliot's Notebook for an Unwritten Novel," Princeton University Library Chronicle, 18 (1957), 181-82. George Eliot did not, however, use purple ink exclusively after 1872; e.g., she briefly reverted to dark brown in her 1879 diary (Henry W. and Albert A.

It was based in a comparative method that inferred from resemblances in widespread cultural phenomena the unitary nature of social history; it assumed laws of progress that assured the development of society in a positive direction; and it interpreted these laws as uniform governing agencies in nature. George Eliot's essays and note challenge precisely these elements of social evolutionism. In the first essay, she argues that cultural facts such as language, mythology, and dress originate within human limitations, and that these limitations, not common origins or historical connections, account for similarities among such facts. In the note, she questions Charles Lyell's idea of uniform natural law as an adequate way of understanding the human past. In the second essay, George Eliot affirms the artist's social responsibility to portray both real human beings and ideal moral tylpes, and she places her faith in human nature, not in general laws, as the salva- tion of society. The text of the essays and note is given as written, with de- leted words enclosed in angular brackets. CONTENTS OF THE NOTEBOOK "Es ist dafiir gesorgt dass die Baiume nicht in den Himmel wachsen," says the German proverb;9 in other words, everything on this Earth has its limits which may not be overpassed. Even Imagination which used to be in high repute for its immensity, is seen nowadays to be no more than a worker in mosaics, owing every one of its glinting fragments &amp; every type of its impossible vastnesses to the small realm of experience; nay, finds herself beaten by discovery 8c sits amazed, like a sorcerer out- done. And discovery? That too must end somewhere &amp; under the name of knowledge has long been recognized as a mere parenthesis in a con- text of irremovable darkness. Even the ravings of madness &amp; the vagaries of wilful nonsense have their logical limits. "They all fell to playing at catch as catch can till the gunpowder ran out at the heels of their boots," may be compared to a zigzag made of straight lines &amp; measurable angles, or a sinuosity which however wildly looped is inevitably made up of curves. To be plain, it is obvious enough that a being like man, having 9 "Care is taken that trees do not grow into the sky" (Oxenford's translation); epigraph to Part III of Goethe's Aus Meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit (1811- 33); see Karl Simrock, Die deutschen Sprichworter (Frankfurt: Bronner [1846], No. 855.</page><page sequence="4">388 Nineteenth-Century Fiction a certain shape, certain modes of movement, certain forms of &lt;move- ment&gt; sense, &amp; certain unchangeable wants must continue to be de- termined &amp; limited by these in all his inventions, however far the prog- ress of the ages may carry him; &amp; also that different groups of human be- ings, though in the very beginning of their existence sundered from each other, must inevitably fall upon the same devices for self-&lt;preser-&gt; preservation, communication &amp; analogical' representation. They might have in no single case the same name for the same thing, but over a certain range their speech would be made up of like sounds, &amp; they would of necessity have much agreement in the metaphorical develop- ment of their speech: above &amp; below, light &amp; dark, fast &amp; slow, warm &amp; cold, sweet &amp; sour, hard &amp; soft, smooth &amp; rough, heavy &amp; light, noisy &amp; still, cloudy &amp; clear, wet &amp; dry, far &amp; near, &amp; so on, would be the same qualities for each group, &amp; the words expressing them would be trans- ferred from the external to the internal, from the visible &amp; palpable to the invisible &amp; imaginary. In short, their languages would be to a good extent translatable; they would be different media of ideas held in com- mon. Their grammar must have corresponding elements, however dif- ferently rendered, since the main elements of grammar are simply in- dispensable facts of human existence: that I am not you, that He is neither of us, that the sky is still the sky though it may be either bright &amp; sunny or dark &amp; starry, that my hand is still my hand though it may be hot or cold. Change, active &amp; passive, &lt; &lt;or&gt; (verbs)&gt;, distinction of persons, of substance &amp; quality, &lt; or&gt; (nouns &amp; adjectives)&gt;, are wrought into the experience of every sensitive animal, &amp; where the power of &lt;speech is&gt; language exists make part of its earliest stimuli, however imperfectly represented in words. It would be the same with their clothing where climate forced them into clothing. Tunic &amp; toga, the closer constant garment &amp; the looser occasional covering, would be found out in the same latitude though on different sides of the world, &amp; if a head-covering were taken, one sees that it must be of a shape to stick on, which shape in relation to human skulls, though the extremes of brachycephalous &amp; dolichocephalous,'0 could not vary widely in fundamental character. Indeed, looking at costumes through all the caprices of wealthy fashion in the rolling cen- turies, one sees the restraining influence of such simple facts as our four limbs &amp; trunk, for with all the extravagance that would clearly have gone any possible length the changes are in trivial accessories. Apart from the great division of breeched &amp; unbreeched which seems to have been at first a matter of climate, one sees a comparative anatomy in all va- rieties of apparel. The dress coat &amp; waistcoat of the present day are a tunic of which the fore-part has been injudiciously cut away to supply 'ORespectively rounded and elongated skulls (Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex [London: John Murray, 18713, 1, 148).</page><page sequence="5">Some Unpublished Late Essays 389 another form of frontage, &amp; under-garments are mere reduplications. Breeches, hosen, gaiters, stockings are easily convertible: what is un- changeable is the human leg. One may safely say that while the human race lasts, there will be no wide departure from the typical long or short tunic, the braccae full or narrow, the head-covering of the skull-cap or high-crowned genus, with more or less or nothing of brim. It will never be the general fashion of communities for one man to carry twenty chimney-pots one above another on his head-not because the effect would be ugly, for this would not, we know, be a vera causa, but be- cause the human balance in walking could not sustain that height of absurdity. Nor will ladies ever be able to go beyond a certain height in the heels of their boots while they have to keep their toes on the ground. To every thing human there are limits, &amp; let folly pay invention never so high, inventors in dress will radically be doing the same thing over again, covering four limbs, a trunk &amp; a skull so as to leave a certain power of movement withal. Well, all this is very simple; but I wish it were borne in mind &amp; practically applied in the investigation &amp; discussion of origins. For then we should not see that irrational exclusiveness of theory which insists on interpreting all resemblances between the mythologies &amp; legends of different peoples as a result of tradition or identity of descent. Likeness in the connexion &amp; representation of facts is what we should expect over a large range of experience even in tribes the most remote from each other &amp; with no traceable alliance through descent. Cup-shaped vessels, &amp; sharp-edged implements; terror &amp; worship or attempted propitiation of visible or imaginary powers-of mountains, trees, animals, fire &amp;c storm; ways of accounting for things as due to the will &amp; activity of beings curiously or monstrously &lt;unlike&gt; different from men, &amp; yet fundamentally like them: these ge other forms of human apprehension might be found all over the world without, surely, compelling us to the supposition that they all proceeded from one nest of speech &amp; practice. What we should be surprised at is a novelty, like the boomerang.1" But the likeness would in a great proportion of cases be analogical Sc not direct. There are many animals to whom a more or less anthropomorph- ic view would attribute cunning: stories of cunning arising indepen- dently would be likely to have corresponding incidents, with various animals taken as the agents. I cannot be persuaded that what is the nodus in the story of the Fisherman for getting rid of the alarming Djinn, in the Arabian Nights, namely, that Cunning masters &lt;Force&gt; Strength by piquing Strength to take some position or form in which it can be the easy prey of Cunning, must have been born exclusively in 11 Cf. Tylor, who, arguing that historical connections between Australia and Europe may have existed, subordinated the evidence of the boomerang and em- phasized that all other Australian weapons were "but varieties of instruments com- mon elsewhere" (Early History of Mankind, p. 372).</page><page sequence="6">390 Nineteenth-Century Fiction Asia.12 I should have more confidence in the probability that this idea would spontaneously arise in many different communities than I should have in the circuitous tracing of etymological derivations through muta- tions of vocal sounds which might or might not have happened in a particular instance, however conceivable or deducible on general grounds.'3 But in the investigation of origins &amp; derivations there is another principle to be borne in mind besides this of limitation. It is that in whatever concerns the life of man there is a constantly increasing com- plexity or interaction of various conditions, so that similar phenomena may often be produced by a different concurrence of facts &amp; events &amp; that you can hardly find any phenomenon which is not a highly mixed product. Surely it is as unreasonable to explain mythologies exclusively by the personification of natural forces as by the deification of kings &amp; heroes or the symbolical exoteric teaching of priests; but in considering the tendencies of man in society an unprejudiced judgment sees ground for accepting all these agencies in various proportions according to time &amp; circumstance. Is the interpretation of man's past life on earth according to the method of Sir Charles Lyell in geology, namely, on the principle that all changes were produced by agencies still at work, thoroughly adequate &amp; scientific? Or must we allow, especially in the earlier periods, for something incalculable by us from the data of our present experience? Even within comparatively near times &amp; in kindred communities how many conceptions 8c fashions of life have existed to which our under- standing &amp; sympathy has no clue! 12 Again cf. Tylor, who singles out a Tartar folktale of a demonic giant who keeps his soul in a snake "as very likely indicating the original sense of a well-known group of stories in European folk-lore" (Primitive Culture: Researches into the De- velopment of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Language, Art, and Custom [London: John Murray, 1871], II, 140). George Eliot and Lewes read Primitive Culture in July 1872 (Letters, V, 288). In fairness to Tylor, it should be noted that he himself did not engage in "the circuitous tracing of etymological derivations"; George Eliot may have had Miller's method in mind. 13 "Here is one example of the fallacious estimate of evidence among the leamed. To prove that certain mutations might possibly have occurred-they being accord- ing to discemible operative laws-is not a proof that they occurred here or there even in instances of a direct &amp; simple kind: much less can it fairly be taken as such proof where the transmutations are of a number &amp; complexity to themselves require a strain of belief for the acceptance of such a series as having actually occurred" (George Eliot's note).</page><page sequence="7">Some Unpublished Late Essays 391 Portrait painters may conceal the age of their sitters &amp; deck them in fancy garments, but the living subject is less successful in the cor- responding attempt. Indefatigable Time models as well as colours &amp; of his work everybody is a connoisseur. A woman's face beautified by an excellent master will have an ideal truth; but when the same face is beautified by her own fingers in the decorative way with rouge-pot &amp; henna, such truth as it presents is too often of a grimly real kind not sought for by the colourist.14 And even with regard to the great portrait painters there is a balance of advantages in two possible methods. Let none decry ideal portraits seeing that these must include our most precious pictures of sacred types. But on the other hand we are glad to have Rembrandt's mother, Bellini's old Doge, Holbein's Archbishop Warham, nay, Titian's Philip II. in all his shuffling viciousness of ex- pression, from his wispy yellow hair to his ill-fitting yellow slippers.15 Let us see how mankind might be made lovelier; but let us also see what they are &amp; have been without fastidious selection. It is the same with the histories of men. We cannot afford to part with heroic forms as they have been seen in the high imagination of poets. But it is good that the narrator should also if possible follow the example of those greatest painters who not only painted the finest ideal types they were capable of beholding, but also painted severely veracious likenesses, taking their models as they were with all their facial irreg- ularities &amp; wrinkles &amp;c presenting them in their habit as they lived. It is an old bias to suppose that we can delight in conceiving men as they ought to be only by shutting our eyes to what they are, &amp;c that otherwise we shall not believe in their having those elements or qual- ities which can make them grow towards what they ought to be. Looked at closely this notion seems to hold in it the utmost possible scepticism as to human goodness, &amp;c is an indirect assertion that society is to be saved by silliness &amp; pretence. Everybody can see what mischief would follow if we carried this kind of wilful illusion into our working of metals &amp; our building of bridges. Among some peoples it has been held that fishes could be enticed by flattery &amp; that a storm could be quieted 14 Cf. George Eliot's treatment of rouging in her essay "Taste," ca. 1872-79, where the practice is also found socially harmful (Thomas Pinney, "More Leaves from George Eliot's Notebook," Huntington Library Quarterly, 29 [1966], 366-67). 15 Probably the most famous portrait of Rembrandt's mother (1639), in George Eliot's day in the Imperial Museum, Vienna (Bode and Hofstede de Groot, No. 262); Bellini's Doge Leonardo Loredan (ca. 1501), in the National Gallery, London, since 1844 (museum catalog); Holbein's Archbishop Warham (1527), in the Louis XIV Collection, Louvre (museum catalog); Titian's Philip II (ca. 1554), in the Pitti Gal- lery, Florence, noted by George Eliot in May 1860 as "a memorable portrait" (MS Journal, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University; I am grate- ful to the authorities of the Beinecke Library for permission to quote from this MS, in particular to Miss Marjorie G.

But it is now pretty well agreed in this quarter of the &lt;world&gt; globe that we are the better off for knowing better the nature of fishes &amp; storms &amp; acting according to that knowledge. The mere fact that mankind has a conception of what is pure 8c lovely, might be fairly taken as a ground of faith in the human nature out of which the conception was born, &amp; the proper attitude of faith is bravery. The contents of this notebook should help foster two attitudes already present in George Eliot scholarship: first, a benign skepti- cism about her compliance with the methods and assumptions of social evolutionism, including varieties of Comtist theories and perhaps organic and even radically empiricist ones in general; and second, a cautious willingness to treat George Henry Lewes's ma- ture work as a nonfictional analogy to her own, questions of in- fluence and originality aside. Too much emphasis has been placed, perhaps, on the evolutionary and empiricist ideas George Eliot found appropriate for sympathetic public treatment in her reviews of the 1850s. Certainly her fiction has other dimensions that await further exploration by readers willing to pursue its strains of intel- lectualism, discontinuity, and intricate critical realism.16 The fol- lowing commentary, however, is rather less ambitious. After out- lining the most important elements of social evolutionism, I trace them in the works that seem to have provoked the first essay. George Eliot's own views are then distinguished and explained, with some help from Lewes's treatment of laws. The commentary on the second essay, which also turns to Lewes for aid, as well as to John Ruskin, links George Eliot's conception of law to ideal types, imagination, and progress. As Maurice Mandelbaum has shown, the thrust of social evo- lutionism can be understood most easily by reference to Darwin's On the Origin of Species." To be sure, Darwin's theory did not 16 A few such studies: Elizabeth Ermarth, "Incarnations: George Eliot's Concep- tion of 'Undeviating Law,"' NCF, 29 (1974), 273-86, treats George Eliot's view of law in the light of Feuerbach's; Sara Moore Putzell, "The Seardh for a Higher Rule: Spiritual Progress in the Novels of George Eliot," Journal of the American Academy of Religion, 47 (1979), 389-407, reads the novels in the context of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit; J. Hillis Miller, "Narrative and History," ELH, 41 (1974), 455-73, analyzes Middlemarch as a work of historical discontinuity; and George Levine, "George Eliot's Hypothesis of Reality," NCF, 35 (1980), 1-28, studies her later realism by reference to George Henry Lewes's Problems of Life and Mind. 17 This paragraph and the next three draw freely from Mandelbaum's meticulous analysis of evolution and progress in History, Man, and Reason: A Study in Nineteenth-Century Thought (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1971), pp. 77-92; his treatmnent of social evolutionism, pp. 93-111, has also helped shape my own.</page><page sequence="9">Some Unpublished Late Essays 393 produce the theory that societies evolve. Still, his subject unavoid- ably implied a problem that became central to Victorian sociology -the historical development of society-while his approach pro- vided a working model of one method for solving it. In particular, the popular notion that societies undergo an unbroken, necessary, progressive development may be conveniently interpreted as a mix of two elements present in Darwin's work, his comparative method and his belief in progress, combined with an essentially mecha- nistic view of law. Lacking actual chronological data to support his theory, Dar- win relied upon indirect proof furnished by comparisons among various species. If given specimens resembled each other closely, with continuous, gradual differences, it plausibly followed that they had shared a common ancestry. The comparative method had gained some respectability-especially in philology-before the appearance of Origin of Species. In Darwin's agile hands, however, comparison yielded such spectacular results that to many minds it seemed the one truly scientific way to understand the past. There were other reasons, too, for the method's popularity. In the light of Darwin's research, the biological similarities among all peoples of the earth suggested a vast family linked by a presumably trace- able web of kinships. As anthropological evidence flowed back from expeditions, cultures from every corner of the globe appeared to have only slightly different, occasionally even identical, prac- tices and apparatus. These discoveries in turn indicated that the gradual variation and progression which Darwin had detected among species on the Galapagos Islands were present among cul- tures everywhere. It seemed to follow that different societies rep- resented different stages in human development, and that social facts of all kinds, from assortments of headgear to various mythol- ogies, had descended from common origins. Although Darwin himself (like T. H. Huxley and others) re- jected the notion of some unitary, universal law of progressive de- velopment, in Origin of Species he did reinforce this aspect of social evolutionism. Partly from faith in Providence he believed that progress resulted from the operations of inheritance, variabil- ity, and natural selection. Darwin himself presented these fixed laws in essentially modem terms; they amounted to discursive formulas for describing the differential death rate among members of species based upon their adaptability to changing conditions.</page><page sequence="10">394 Nineteenth-Century Fiction The laws were widely taken, however, as cosmic assurance that the fittest-in the sense of superlative-would survive, and this meant irresistible progress. Thus it seemed but a small distance between Darwin's laws of progress on the level of specific biology to Herbert Spencer's law of progress, formulated in 1857, on the level of uni- versal history: Whether it be in the development of the Earth, in the development of Life upon its surface, in the development of Society, of Government, of Manufactures, of Commerce, of Language, Literature, Science, Art, this same evolution of the simple into the complex, through successive dif- ferentiations, holds throughout. From the earliest traceable cosmical changes down to the latest results of civilization, we shall find that the transformation of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous, is that in which progress essentially consists.18 To conclude this selective restatement of Mandelbaum's anal- ysis, we should note the way in which social evolutionists common- ly interipreted the concept of law, since this particular interpreta- tion helped validate the comparative method. Like Auguste Comte, they ty,pically cast aside Newton's idea of laws as physical forces implanted in nature by God, but they continued to speak about the subject in mechanistic terms partially drawn from the eighteenth- century metaphysics they sought to reject. For many social evolu- tionists, laws were still deeply seated in nature and governed the events under their sway with uniform, constant operation. Understanding the past by recourse to permanent laws often involved applying to human history Charles Lyell's theory of uni- formitarianism, the subject of George Eliot's note. In Lyell's words, his theory hold "that all former changes of the organic and in- organic creation are referrible to one uninterrupted succession of physical events, governed by the laws now in operation." Unifonni- tarianism held that all change, from volcanoes and earthquakes to the ceaseless creation and destruction of species, is "essential to the stability of the system." In this scheme, there can be no more progression among animals and humans than among rocks and tides; as a unique, distinct type, any species could be subject to variation only within fairly narrow limits established at the time 18 "Progress: Its Law and Cause" (1857), in Essays: Scientific, Political, and Spec- ulative, 3 vols. (New York: Appleton, 1914), I, 10. George Eliot read the article when it appeared (Letters, II, 341).</page><page sequence="11">Some Unpublished Late Essays 395 of its creation."' In showing how two or more species could evolve from a common ancestor, Darwin overturned Lyell's orthodox idea of types and with it Lyell's own application of uniformitarianism to organic life. Nevertheless, Darwin consciously retained the chief element of Lyell's theory-its emphasis on gradual, uniform change-in devising the law of natural selection.20 Imported into the arena of human history, this new species of uniformitarianism now suggested that all cultural facts had re- sulted from continuous, constant historical processes. An inductive road to the past lay open, and one could travel back to origins by a number of means. When graduated similarities gave indirect evi- dence of common origins or historical connections among cultural facts, any gaps were filled in by analogical construction. If the sim- ilarities occurred in phenomena from locations so far apart that such origins or connections seemed wildly implausible, they were usually taken as iproof "that the human mind obeys the same lawrs everywhere."2' This application of uniformitarianism indicated that the same cultural facts have always originated, and always will originate, under the same conditions. Through induction from laws presently operating, especially but not exclusively among primitive societies, evolutionists attempted to reconstruct whole systems of lost customs and beliefs. Throughout this entire enterprise, descriptive patterns of events more or less came to represent the laws that produced them, (Mandelbaum, p. 88). Muller took elaborate tables of largely con- jectural word mutations to stand for predictive laws, permitting partial reconstruction of lost languages, the original meanings of their words intact. Finally, the aim of discovering general laws governing the development of culture in all its aspects meant that the larger the,pattern the better. The ultimate goal, as Spencer's law of progress illustrates, was to describe the "one grand system according to which mankind has developed everywhere" (Boas, 19 Principles of Geology, Being an Attempt to Explain the Former Changes of the Earth's Surface, by Reference to Causes Now in Operation, 3 vols. (London: John Murray, 1830-33), I, 144; I, 479; II, 64-65. George Eliot read the work by early 1841 (Letters, VIII, 8). 2?0Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life (London: John Murray, 1859), pp. 95-96. 21 Franz Boas, "The Limitations of the Comparative Method of Anthropology" (1896), in Race, Language and Culture (New York: Macmillan, 1940), p. 273.</page><page sequence="12">396 Nineteenth-Century Fiction p. 275). Hence the widespread indifference among social evolu- tionists to the effects of individual actions and to details (Mandel- baum, p. 89). Indeed, actual chronological evidence became large- ly irrelevant, or at least almost entirely dispensable, more so since the comparative method arose expressly to function without it. Surely no single social evolutionist subscribed fully to all these principles and methods. Each emphasized various aspects of the whole, so that their systems were occasionally, as with Muller's and Spencer's, mutually exclusive in details but similar in essentials. Muller was the foremost proponent of the theory that mythology had originated, as George Eliot puts it, in "the personification of natural forces," Spencer of the view that it had begun in "the deifi- cation of kings &amp; heroes."22 Each also developed a supporting theory of language, with Muiller holding that speech had arisen to express abstractions, Spencer that it had originated in imitation.23 Both found the corruption of speech at the heart of myth'making; both relied upon personification; and iMuller, for one, openly ad- mitted the conjectural nature of comparative mythology.24 None- theless, each felt an overriding concern to protect the exclusive integrity of his system, and Spencer, characteristically, would give no ground even on slight details. George Eliot's first essay points out that certain fixed charac- teristics of human beings-their shape, movements, senses, and wants-account for similarities in the ways they preserve them- selves, communicate, and represent the world. Since grammar re- flects the "indispensable facts of human existence," all languages are more or less translatable. These considerations should lead us 22 Eg., see Miller, "Comparative Mythology" (1856), in Chips from a German Workshop, IV (London: Longmans, Green, 1898), 105-54; and Spencer, "The Origin of Animal Worship" (1870), in Essays: Scientific, Political, and Speculative, I, 325. The other theory mentioned, that mythology had originated in "the symbolical exo- teric teachings of priests," was commonly held in the eighteenth century (Emery Neff, The Poetry of History: The Contribution of Literature and Literary Scholar- ship to the Writing of History since Voltaire [New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1947], p. 108). 23 Muller, Lectures on the Science of Language, 6th ed. (London: Longmans, 1871), I, 404-5, 424, 430-34; first published in 1861 (George Eliot read the book with en- thusiasm when it appeared, and reread it in late 1880 [Letters, IV, 8; VII, 335]); Spencer, "The Genesis of Science" (1854), in Essays: Scientific, Political, and Specula- tive, II, 31-32. 24 "I know that some scholars will say that all this is mere guesswork, and I am the last person to deny that it is. But what else could it be? In ,treating of times far beyond the reach of history, what method is there but the conjectural?" (Chips from a German Workshop IV, 568).</page><page sequence="13">Some Unpublished Late Essays 397 to expect similarities among mythologies and legends, as among other human inventions; such similarities no more indicate a com- mon origin of myths than of languages and clothing. Nor is it sufficient to present transmissions of a given myth that might have occurred, less so when this possibility hinges on an elaborate scheme of coincidence and dependence. Since most phenomena result from mixed conditions, she concludes, similar phenomena may be produced from varying combinations of conditions. Unlike Muller and Spencer, George Eliot does not posit the origins of mythology and language, much less that of dress, in specific faculties and practices. She treats these cultural facts as perfectly obvious devices for weathering the world. All three rep- resent strategy. George Eliot's only inexplicable residuum lies in the adjustment of our structures of sensation and perception-in Lewes's term, our organization25-to the facts of our situation on earth. Our physical makeup provides a limited range outside of which speech cannot occur, just as it determines the general shape of a coat or the maximum height of a shoe's heel. At times lan- guage functions metaphorically-again a part of our psychological strategy-and thus provides devices for conceptualizing and for interpreting the unknown. This last idea should be paused over, for in bringing up anal- ogy George Eliot could be taken to mean that language stands for the world analogically. For George Eliot, however, language originates in the task of experience, not in abstraction, even on the modest level of analogy. Once present, language makes abstraction, one of its metaphorical functions, possible; and, as Lewes also sug- gested, helps shape experience as an important stimulus in its own right.26 While language could not be a closed system independent of experience, therefore, it seems unlikely to have ever had an imitative origin. Language can further appropriate the unknown in terms of experiences it has made familiar. In this capacity of "analogical representation," its other metaphorical function, lies its power to interpret the "visible or imaginary" through myth. George Eliot presents myth, then, as a mode of knowledge, a "con- 25"A Box of Books," Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, 91 (1862), 443; one item under review is Muller's Lectures, which Lewes praised but found too narrow in its presentation of the origin of language. 26Problems of Life and Mind, 5 vols.

Her point is that it is unreason- able to lay claim to any unmixed explanation. Before making distinctions between George Eliot's and Ed- ward Tylor's or John Fiske's approaches to these problems, we should note some possibly misleading similarities between them. George Eliot addresses the question of origins in terms of human economy, pointing out the physical and psychological conditions under which languages and mythologies naturally came about.28 Although Tylor believed that comparative mythology increasingly suggested common descent or historical connections among many races, he too called for more attention to human bodily and mental structure. When similarities among myths were not minute, he admitted that they may have resulted from "the like working of the human mind under like conditions" (Early History of Man- kind, pp. 377, 332). John Fiske also argued that close similarities in myths of different races, unless they resembled in minor details, probably revealed that "Ca similar human intelligence has been at work explaining similar phenomena."29 If these views seem compatible with George Eliot's, the sim- ilarity is only superficial. Both Tylor and Fiske assumed, along with Spencer-though Tylor was generally more cautious-that many practices in present-day savage societies were survivals that more or less reflected those of the common ancestors of at least all Indo-Europeans, and it is hard to see how such an assumiption could be made without recourse to uniformitarianism. To this application of Lyell's theory George Eliot specifically objects. 27 Cf. the modern view, which according to Paul Bohannan was also approached by Tylor, that myth is "a narrative substitute for a theory . . . a handy device for simplifying nature, culture, and psyche into a realizable whole" (Introduction to Researches into the Early History of Mankind and the Development of Civilization, ed. Paul Bohannan [Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1964], p. xvi). 28 George Eliot's essay "Origins" (ca. 1872-79) also recommends a balance of the "pragmatical" or historical and "psychological" methods in historical research (Pin- ney, "More Leaves from George Eliot's Notebook," pp. 369-70). 29"Myths of the Barbaric World" (1870), in Myths and Myth-Makers: Old Tales and Superstitions Interpreted by Comparative Mythology (Boston: Houghton, 1872), p. 159. George Eliot read the collection in September 1872 (Letters, V, 464, n. 5).</page><page sequence="15">Some Unpublished Late Essays 399 Since "our understanding &amp; sympathy has no clue" to much of the cultural life of even relatively recent societies, we should allow in our interpretations of the past "for something incalculable by us from the data of our present experience." In their references to the uniform working of the mind, Fiske clearly urges and Tylor strongly implies the position Andrew Lang adopted: that resem- blances in widespread cultural facts mean that all races "have had to pass through similar conditions of imagination and of society."30 In other words, not only does similarity in the conditions lproduce similarity in the results, but similarity in the results indicates sim- ilarity in the conditions as well. This idea George Eliot decisively rejects. A quotation from Lewes's series of essays on Darwin may help bring these points together: When we see one savage race tipping arrows with iron, and another, ignorant of iron, using poison, there is a community of object effected by diversity of means, but the analogy does not necessarily imply any closer connection between the two races than the fact that men with similar faculties and similar wants find out similar methods of supply- ing their wants.31 Judging from her first essay, George Eliot would agree with Lewes's remark, but she also reminds us of its implications for those who attempt to interpret the human past. If we see savage- or civilized-races tip their arrows, we cannot assume on that basis alone that any ancient society ever titpped or had arrows. If we see actual proof that two ancient societies had arrowlike sticks tipped with iron, we cannot assume a common origin or historical con- nection between them. We cannot even assume what Lewes calls "a community of object," the want to kill: in unthreatened or pacifist vegetarian societies, sticks might have been tipped with iron for decoration, for use in ceremony, or as part of a primitive musical instrument. And these three possible reasons have oc- curred to a modern mind; there are surely many others, George Eliot suggests, of which we now could never even remotely con- ceive. No one would want to argue that George Eliot implies a full conception of law, or anything approaching one, in her criticism 30 "Mythology and Fairy Tales," Fortnightly Review, 19 (173), 622. 81 "Mr. Darwin's Hypotheses," Part II, Fortnightly Review, 9 (1868), 628.</page><page sequence="16">400 Nineteenth-Century Fiction of social evolutionism. Yet she does imply what she believes some kinds of laws are not, or rather that it is not scientifically correct to speak about laws in certain ways. Whatever position George Eliot might wish to take on any specific organic or inorganic law, she does not share the evolutionist belief in widely covering his- torical laws, nor does she suggest that laws of this generality exist.32 Human limitations do not represent laws that necessarily make certain things happen; they provide an experiential context with- in which certain things cannot happen. This interpretation of law also appears in Lewes's Problems of Life and Mind, which sought to refute the erroneous conception, almost universal, of the phenomena of Nature being determined by Law. This must be replaced by the more accurate conception of the Law being determined by the phenomena. What we call Laws of Nature are not objective existences, but subjective abstrac- tions,-formulae in which the multifarious phenomena are stripped of their variety and reduced to unity. (Problems, I, i, 69) Taking laws to dictate the behavior of phenomena produces "the fallacy of suipposing phenomena to be determined by their own resultants" (Problems, I, i, 83), as if facts could be explained by the general patterns emerging from them. Indeed laws are fictions that direct research; no general statement is real, only true "with- in the limits of the formulated terms" (Problems, III, i, 141; II, ii, 68). In practice, this attitude led both Lewes and George Eliot to attempt to discover laws of far lower generality than those to which Spencer-and Henry Fielding33-aspired. Realizing that most phenomena are highly mixed products and eschewing the Comtist method of total vision, both devoted themselves, Lewes in his lab- oratory and George Eliot in her novels, to the careful analysis of multiple conditions among particular webs of facts. At first glance, the second essay seems to have little to do with social evolutionism or conceptions of law. An excellent portraitist, George Eliot remarks, may paint a woman's face and discover in 32 Elizabeth Ermarth has argued that George Eliot distinguishes between cultural laws and natural laws, both of which exhibit regularity but not inexorability; natural law is incomprehensible in human terms, cultural law unimaginably diverse (see above, n. 16).

The great masters sought to represent ideal types as well as "severely veracious like- nesses," and storytellers, following their example, should encour- age our delight in what we ought to be and inspire our belief that we can improve. For this to be possible, art cannot ignore reality, since it needs a reliable point of departure; nor can it do without the ideal, since it should offer a reliable guide. Society is not to be saved, George Eliot continues, by the pretense that nothing is wrong with it. That merely leads to the silliness of covering up imperfections, a practice not only dishonest but, by extension, dan- gerous as well: no one would be in favor of rouging metals or bridges so that they only appear sturdy. "The mere fact that man- kind has a conception of what is pure 8c lovely," she concludes, "might be fairly taken as a ground of faith in the human nature out of which the conception was born, &amp; the proper attitude of faith is bravery." Critics have often noted that George Eliot's realism accom- modates the idealization of character, and this essay reiterates her belief that the real and ideal are not antithetical.34 The idea was common enough in her time. Perhaps its most impressive exposi- tion occurs in the work of Ruskin, whom George Eliot venerated as "one of the great Teachers of the day" (Letters, II, 422), al- though Lewes too had much to say, largely derived from Ruskin, on the subject.35 For present purposes, the heart of Ruskin's anal- ysis is his emphasis on the power of the true artist's penetrating, sympathetic imagination to reach "by intuition and intensity of gaze (not by reasoning, but by its authoritative opening and reveal- ing power), a more essential truth than is seen at the surface of things." For Ruskin the proper exercise of the imagination in- evitably involves the process of moral teaching, the lesson being that the ideal, the image of God, lies in the real. Further, indi- vidual humanity must be taken as the basis for the ideal type: 34 See Hugh Witemeyer, George Eliot and the Visual Arts (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1979), pp. 73-74; and Darrel Mansell, Jr., "Ruskin and George Eliot's 'Realism,'" Criticism, 7 (1965), 203-16. u5 In addition to the passages from Problems of Life and Mind cited further along, see George Henry Lewes's The Principles of Success in Literature, ed.

"36 Ruskin's discussion of types in connection with the idealiza- tion of character in portraiture was only a small part of the wide- spread debate on this subject that preceded the appearance of Origin of Species and intensified in its wake.37 Scientifically, a type was closely allied with the notion of species, though it had kept its biblical overtones, as Lewes described them, of some external "mys- terious force, some plan, not otherwise specified, which regulates and shaipes the parts" of phenomena it governs (Problems, III, i, 111). When Darwin destroyed the notion of species or types as fixed, permanent entities, the idea of design, which his work might also have toppled, was preserved in a less stable form through laws of progress that guaranteed the gradual perfection of society. Lewes himself treated scientific types in the same way as he did laws: as abstractions, not real but true, not sensible but intelligible. They were ideal guides that emerge from phenomena but by no means govern them (Problems, III, i, 111). It was the same, he argued, with moral types, which provide "the standards for our conduct in life": The objection to ideals, on the ground of their surpassing human na- ture, is a misconception of their function. They are not the laws by which we live, or can live, but the types by which we measure all devi- ations from a perfect life. . . . [They] are never wholly to be realized, yet who denies that such ideals are very potent influences in every soul that has clearly conceived them? . . . Like the typical laws of physical processes, these conceptions are solid truths although they exist only as ideals; and he who imagines their validity impugned because human nature can but imperfectly realize them, is as ignorant of Life as he would be who should deny the validity of natural Laws, because of the perturbations observable in natural events. . . . No moving body does move uniformly in a straight line; no man does love his neighbor as himself. (Problems, I, i, 76) George Eliot's first essay makes one wary of filling in gaps by analogy, but Lewes's comments do remind us of the close relation 36 Modern Painters, Vol. II (1846), in The Works of John Ruskin, ed.

In a final criticism of social evolutionism, George Eliot grounds her hopes for social progress not in some general, -uniform historical law but in human nature itself, simply on the basis that it can conceive of, and act according to, moral ideals. True, praise of humanity frequently occurs in works by social evolutionists, but that is another matter altogether. Spencer and Fiske placed their final trust in a law of progress, as did Tylor, though he was less necessitarian and impersonal about it; and Comte's Religion of Humanity quite comfortably co-existed with his absolute convic- tion that society must develop in a positive direction under the governance of undeviating law. George Eliot, however, maintained an almost evangelical conviction that it is ulp to us to design-to save-ourselves. In this task the artist can offer important help. The writer's social responsibility is of course a recurrent theme in George Eliot's aesthetic-silly novels are just one more form of pretentious, possibly injurious rouging-but in her sec- ond essay the idea is linked, through her mention of ideal types, with her view of law.38 George Eliot wanted her art to help im- prove society by helping people improve; to this end she stressed, as Ruskin did, the moral importance of the artist's penetrating sympathetic imagination. If her novels represent the fullest real- ization of Ruskin's ideal in nineteenth-century fiction, it is less because George Eliot occasionally points out some resemblance be- tween her best characters and "sacred ty(pes" than because she con- tinuously dramatizes, through the moral imagination of her nar- rator, these characters' own moral imaginations. Properly operat- ing, imagination reveals to a character fresh relations among be- lief, motive, and action; it exposes an unexpected imiport in the familiar, enriches the common with new significance. The result is moral in the most basic sense: the imagination penetrates to an ideal-sacrifice, charity, endurance, or some other form of duty- which stirs a certain bravery, and the character takes action. But in George Eliot's aesthetic the process is intended to go further. What imagination does for her characters, her works are to do for her readers. 38 See the review "Silly Novels by Lady Novelists" (1856) and the essay "Author- ship" (ca. 1872-79) in "Leaves from a Note-Book," both in Essays of George Eliot, ed. Thomas Pinney (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1963), pp. 300-24, 437-42.</page><page sequence="20">404 Nineteenth-Century Fiction The foundation for this aesthetic is that righteous acts tend to be efficacious, or perhaps the word is contagious, whether they catch from one character to another or from a novel to a reader. Certainly the idea seems empiricist, even derived from association- istic psychology; but its most forceful statement occurs in the in- tellectualist tradition. According to Immanuel Kant, a righteous act for duty's sake "uplifts the soul and rouses a wish that we too could act in this way."39 George Eliot's final emphasis, therefore, goes beyond the imagination and falls upon the moral nature of individual action and the moral responsibility that accompanies it.40 The social evolutionists' general laws of progress, -formulated from large historical patterns in which individual action had bare- ly mattered, are here undercut by an affirmation that good acts, not laws, influence the world for the better, for actions come before laws. As the first essay now suggests, human limitations fix the perimeter of social progress, though this can be discovered only afterwards, never beforehand. Evaluating the older sociology from his perspective in 1893, Franz Boas decided that the comparative method and the assump- tions that had gone with it were inadequate to contain the riches of the human past. Uniform psychic laws, unitary historical pro- cesses, universal ideas-all must give way, he argued, to the pre- sumption that identical cultural facts may have developed along different lines "from an infinite number of starting ipoints" (Boas, p. 274).1 Until laws can be 'formulated by correlating abstract re- lations of the conditions of specific groups of phenomena, Boas concluded, the proper aim of research is not to find general laws by which every culture has developed in a similar fashion but to discover "how it is that the developments of culture so often lead to the same results" (Boas, p. 273). George Eliot largely shares Boas's view of the comparative method, but she has less hope than he of a truly scientific sociology of the past. Her approach is largely destructive. Conjecture, no 39 Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals, trans. H. J. Paton (New York: Har- per and Row, 1964), p. 78 n. 40 George Levine, "Determinism and Responsibility in the Works of George Eliot," PMLA, 77 (1962), 268-79, best explains her complicated view of personal responsibility. 41Cf.

The conclusions of the comparative method are likely functions of the method, not of evidence: patterns inferred from overviews of cultural facts cannot be taken to stand for laws that caused those facts. In the absence of actual chronological evi- dence, one may take recourse to a sort of universal idea like human limitations or anthropomorphism, but its explanatory power is not thorough or orderly. Nor can one deduce the human past from agencies supposedly operating at present; indeed, the notion of general historical laws itself may be incoherent. So bald a state- ment of George Eliot's position on social evolutionism suggests that it may stem largely from her ingrained distrust of systems. Commenting on Darwin's Origin of Species in 1859, she confessed that "the Development theory and all other explanations of pro- cesses by which things came to be, produce a feeble impression compared with the mystery that lies under the processes" (Letters, III, 227). Faced with that mystery, this notebook suggests, one can onlyiplace faith in human nature, act-or write-accordingly, and bravely await the results. Southern Illinois University</page></plain_text>
