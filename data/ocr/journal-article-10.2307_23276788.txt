<plain_text><page sequence="1">31 The human body in Minoan religious iconography* Anna Simandiraki-Grimshaw INTRODUCTION The human body has been the subject of much scholarship in Aegean Prehistory. Numerous, often vociferous, debates have surrounded the represented human body, especially trying to establish its meaning, identification and cosmological significance in what are perceived as religious contexts. However, studies often conflate the meaning of bodies from religious and non religious contexts, different localities, different eras and different socio-economic milieux.1 Further more, it is the contention of this author that the frequent use of aspects of Classical religion and ritual to examine human bodies in the prehistoric Aegean is an unavoidably distorting interpretative lens, which may obscure important aspects of prehistoric corporeality Taking Minoan Crete as an example, I firstly discuss the human body and the identification of religious iconography. Secondly, I make a case for several overlooked investigative lenses, which can perhaps improve our methodological arsenal. In doing so, I use the term 'Minoan body' not as a reductionist construct, levelling the incredible somatic variety available, but as a term encapsulating physical, iconographic, discursive and cognitive aspects of what corporeality is archaeologically traceable. The overall purpose of this brief, exploratory paper, therefore, is not to identify religious personages, clearly distinguish between religious and non-religious bodies,2 or even chart the semiotics of corporal representation and interpretation. I deliberately pose more questions than I answer. Rather, I aim to offer some theoretical stimuli towards a more holistic and nuanced exploration of Minoan religious corporeality and hope to expand upon recent relevant explorations.3 WHAT IS A BODY? WHAT IS RELIGIOUS ICONOGRAPHY? The first question one needs to ask is 'what was the Minoan concept of a human body?' The modernist, 20th century CE somatic notions, still largely prevalent in studies of Aegean prehistory,4 may not reflect what the case was in prehistoric Crete. Indeed, this discussion belongs to a wider shift from a positivist certainty of what the human body is to a post-modernist exploration of what a human body may be. This shift has been predominantly explicit in the fields of sociology, cultural studies, anthropology, philosophy and most recently archaeology.5 Nevertheless, although con ceptualisations of the Minoan human body are the subj ect of a much larger proj ect conducted by the author (hence beyond the scope of this paper), some preliminary iconographic glimpses can be offered here, mainly drawn from a dataset of Cretan glyptic, frescoes, figurines and vessels of the third and second millennia BC. These glimpses point to several different con ceptualisations of the human body, dependent on time, location, clientele, medium, use, association etc. For example, the body as whole or as parts; as the member of a collective; as healthy, ageing, ailing,6 transformed, defaced, ecstatic anatomy. The second question one needs to ask is, 'What gives iconography a religious character?' To answer this, one would turn to a) the contexts of this iconography, with their associated cultic structures and equipment; and b) 'religious' elements depicted in this iconography. * I chose this subject in recognition of Peter Warren's invaluable contribution to the study of Aegean Bronze Age religion. But this paper is particularly intended as a small token of gratitude to him as mentor: during my MA, PhD studies and beyond, he has taught me the meaning of scholarship, patience and dignity in archaeological practice. I also owe my sincere thanks to Nicoletta Momigliano and Olga Krzyszkowska, respectively, for inviting me to participate in the Bristol Colloquium and for the opportunity to contribute to this volume of offerings. 1 As Alberti (2002, 101) and Briault (2007a, 241) point out. 2 I use the term religious in inverted commas throughout the paper in recognition of this. 3 E.g.

In fact, most depicted bodies are deemed religious because they represent extraordinary occurrences of what we consider must have been ordinary somatic templates: e.g. lacking facial characteristics, appearing within a ritual context, even representing mind-boggling hybrids of human and animal anatomies. Or they are doing what we consider as unusual things: e.g. hailing each other, giving birth, flying, asserting themselves while half-naked, master ing several creatures (real or fictitious), gesticulating, spilling liquids. The examples of religious corporea lities which I will use in the following sections will abide by these two broad rules of identification. Three main problems arise here: 1. we do not have the whole story, i.e. we lack the cultural understanding that a contemporary of these depictions would have used to complete the scenes; 2. we examine them as disembodied experiences; 3. we still knowingly use extraordinary depictions to create generalisations about ordinary human corporealities. In order to address any of these, one needs to emphasise that somatic iconography is a palimpsest:7 depiction (content), depicted (original anatomy/ies or ideas), medium of depiction, trope of depiction, author and audience, performativity of depiction and of maker/ user, cultural biography (and therefore time-depth).8 For example, the larger of the Temple Repositories 'Snake Goddesses'9 represents a female interacting with snakes. She was presumably modelled either on a real life woman or a cognitive composite of what constitutes female anatomy. The latter may have derived directly or indirectly from observation and experience of real world human anatomy, but filtered through the interpretative action of (re)creation. The medium of depiction is faience, which may or may not have been related to flesh attributes10 (i.e. the external medium of the original body/ies). We do not know who the author/ audience was or if they were the same person/people. This human form can be also seen as having particular performative properties when interacting with a maker/ user (also see below). Its light refraction changes according to lighting conditions, its temperature induces variable sensations to a real-life human body exchanging heat with it (e.g. if/when held). Finally, this form had a cultural biography whereby it was made and then fragmented and deposited.11 My point here is that archaeological interpretations of Minoan/Aegean iconography frequently limit themselves to an unchallenged discussion of somatic depictions as if these were a textbook illustration with no properties other than their two-dimensional visuality. Such interpretations often overlook the physical, social and emotional affordances that the palimpsestic nature of religious corporal iconography may have had on its authors/users. And they conflate the depicted body (e.g. the 'Snake Goddess') with contemporary real-life bodies (e.g. women's physicality in MMIII),12 with its audiences (e.g. women and their status in Minoan societies in general) and with its performativity (high quality of depiction must mean a focal position in a temple). I believe that we need to disentangle these layers of iconography from each other, in order to avoid confusing and generalising assertions and gain more insights about their potential meaning and significance.13 Thus, in the next two sections, instead of approaching 'religious' bodies primarily through the lenses of form (e.g. figurines) or theme (e.g. women),14 I will give priority to the overlapping lenses of depiction modes, performativity, absence and containment. DEPICTION TROPES Physicality When trying to assess the physical qualities and affordances of a somatic depiction, it is important to consider not only the processing properties of a medium (e.g. its durability and malleability), but also the iconographic properties of this medium (e.g. colour, luminosity,15 weight, odour, temperature, texture, fla mmability, fragility, weathering). These considerations are important, as they may have influenced not 7 Cf. Kyriakidis 2007, 301. 8 Cf. Gosden and Marshall 1999; Appadurai 1986; Kopytoff 1986. Alberti, writing about art objects (in this case Minoan corporal depictions), highlights that 'the aesthetic and formal qualities of the objects in question constitute the crucial link between concepts of the body, their representation and social practice' (2001, 190). 9 Panagiotaki 1999, 97. 10 Cf. Nanoglou 2008. 11 Simandiraki-Grimshaw and Stevens in preparation. 12 SeeAlberti'srightfulcriticismofthisconflation(2001,192). 13 The scope and length of this paper are much too limited for an extended discussion on the merits and pitfalls of pheno menological and embodied archaeological methodology, especially as applied to Minoan material culture. Nevertheless, I can clarify here that my overall methodological position is to be aware of my culturally and ontologically biased standpoint, to examine Minoan artefactual occurrences, and to use additional cognitive interpretative lenses in order to approach the iconography as sensory materiality, meaningful to bodies, not just eyes, in antiquity. 14 Cf. Alberti's criticism of 'relatively uncomplicated classification of the various elements that make up the imagery, especially the iconographic and symbolic aspects' (2001, 192). 15 Cf. Zeimbeki 2005, 246.</page><page sequence="3">THE HUMAN BODY IN MINOAN RELIGIOUS ICONOGRAPHY only the physical and cognitive experience of re ligious iconography, but also attitudes towards the 'religious' body. For example, let us agree that the excavators of Anemospilia are correct in assuming that the two clay feet found in the middle room of the temple belonged to a now lost composite statue.16 The first observation about the physicality of this depicted 'religious' body would be the different media used to constitute it (clay, wood) and their different properties in terms not only of sculpting/moulding techniques, but also of invested labour. The physical human body would have been used as a technological tool to create such a corporal repre sentation. Perhaps this manufacture was considered as or accompanied by religious action.17 What impli cations might the differential physical, psychomotor action of one body fashioning another have had on bodily concepts? What does the combination of different materials imply about meanings of anatomical parts and the desire variably to materialise specific imagined corporealities?18 If we take a step further, we can also assess that the wood would have had different interactions with a human hand,19 a poured liquid,20 a flame. These may have had a different impact on the experience of the xoanon as a 'religious' body.21 'Embodied experience is the starting point for analysing human participation in a cultural world.'22 We therefore need to consider the overall physicality of a 'religious' bodily depiction, not just its visual aspects and effects: its visual stimuli were/are never in actual fact divorced from a complex and multimodal network of sensory experiences.23 As Alberti puts it, 'the culturally bound aesthetic effects of figurative imagery play an active role in producing specific conceptualizations and embodied experiences.'24 Dimensionality and Scale Minoan human bodies in 'religious' contexts are represented in two dimensions, low relief, and three dimensions. Moreover, some representations of the human body appear in some media but not in others or there are differences in the modes of depiction. This raises matters of positioning and scale. For instance, a fresco decorates the wall of a room and therefore not only uses different conventions to depict people, but also perhaps appeals to different audiences moving through different spaces, in comparison, say, to a figurine deposited at a peak sanctuary and experienced by a (presumably) different audience. The comparative scale of figures in a scene may have carried messages of status, perspective, age etc.25 However, further insights may be gained if one introduces the notions of proximity: a seal would have required physical proximity to an almost private religious scene,26 as opposed to the wider user accessibility of a fresco.27 What might this imply about the public/private character of depicted 'religious' bodies? Constructs and Limits of the Human Body The human body in Minoan religious iconography displays a rich gamut of constructs, quality and limits. Relevant analysis28 has addressed somatic types, by examining authority, hierarchy and scale;29 and syntax, by examining clothing, headgear, hairstyles, jewellery, nudity, live animals or animal tokens draped over the 16 Sakellarakis and Sakellaraki 1997, 281-7, 530-9, figs. 238 40, 530-7. 17 Cf. Carter 2004. 18 Cf. Polinger Foster 1997,138-9. Zeimbeki's comments (2005, esp. 245), although referring to the Xeste 3 'Goddess', are also relevant here: 'Meaning is ascribed through the allusion to technological processes, the weaving or embroidering of the crocus in the production of the cloth; the smelting of metal into animal-shaped pendants; the act of using pigment to paint images of lilies on an altar.' One can also apply this theorisation to the interaction between medium, shaping human and shaped human. 19 Haptic experience of texture, temperature, movement? 20 Absorbance, mixed odour of wood and liquid? 21 Cf. Csordas 1993 for psychosomatic effects of religious experience, esp,140ff; also cf. Morris 2001, 250. For a discussion on synaesthesia, esp. of artefacts, see Howes 2006, 166: 'Every artefact embodies a particular sensory mix. It does so in terms of its production (i.e. the sensory skills and values that go into its making), in the sensory qualities it presents, and in its consumption (i.e. the meanings and uses people discover in or ascribe to it in accordance with the sensory order of their culture or subculture).' 22 Csordas 1993,135. The notion of somatic modes of attention becomes relevant here. These are 'culturally elaborated ways of attending to and with one's body in surroundings that include the embodied presence of others' (Csordas 1993,138). For the purposes of this paper, this highlights the need to approach Minoan archaeological materiality not in a disembodied fashion, but in a cognitive, sympathetic, embodied way. 23 Hamilakis 2002; cf. Merleau-Ponty 2006. '... in the lived world, we do not perceive others as objects. Another person is perceived as another "myself" [...] other persons can become objects for us only secondarily, as the result of reflection' (Csordas 1993,149). In the discourses of Minoan archaeology, studied people become the objects of scholarship. But it is not helpful for our understanding of a Minoan religious body to expect archaeological 'objectivity' to illuminate Minoan empathic engagement with material culture. 24 Alberti 2001, 194. 25 Laffineur 2001. 26 Stevens 2007; cf. Morris 2001. 27 Cf.

On many occasions, we can detect distinct bodily parts and perhaps markers of gender, investiture and accoutrements, even in depictions where human anatomy does not reflect a 'whole'. What is evident and yet has not been adequately studied is that the frequent bodily segmentation into head and hair, torso, arms, thighs and legs perhaps implies the notional and physical compartmentalisation of the 'religious' body in the Minoan mind. In fact, the physical fragmentation of several artefacts depicting humans (e.g. vessels, figurines) may not only be due to heavy use or taphonomic processes, but may also reveal interactions between physical bodies, depicted bodies, somatic conceptualisations, space, artistic medium and ritual action.30 And all this even before one starts to address how gender and sexuality are expressed,31 blurred or even deliberately avoided.32 The indexical representations of the 'religious' Minoan body33 also become relevant here in terms of somatic construction. The gendered heads denoting crowds in the Knossos Miniature Frescoes34 are usually casually taken as 'shorthand' representations of human bodies watching presumably more important, full bodied individuals. One might argue that the head is the ideal bodily part to use in such Minoan pars pro toto somatic depictions, as only this can be discerned in an actual thick crowd. But the fact remains that the body's identity is simultaneously abstracted, by not representing it in its physical entirety, and concentrated, by using one bodily part as the essence of the whole body. And there are several indexical somatic depictions which use other limbs to signify humans, e.g. arms. This brings us to the notion of the fluid limits of the Minoan 'religious' body.35 The most obvious example is the case of animal-human hybrids, which display different degrees of fusion (and therefore transcend ence of human physicality).36 There are occasions of heterosomatic fusion, whereby animals, animal parts or animal effigies are draped over the human body, but the latter remains distinct. There are also occasions of homosomatic fusion, whereby animals are grafted onto the human body (and the other way round). In the (rather extreme) case of the 'Zakro Master',37 components of the human body were often taken apart, like the limbs of a modern doll, were mixed and matched with animal elements, and were thrown together in reconceptualised, even psychedelic, combinations of human and animal 'natures'. This may be indicative of Minoan concepts of humanity, ontology and possession (in both a hierarchical and a paranormal sense). Aniconicity can also, in my opinion, be considered demarcation of the limits of the Minoan 'religious' body. Morris has argued that the aniconic heads of several human forms may imply hallucination,38 but Kyriakidis has counter-argued that aniconicity need not necessarily be due to religious but to practical reasons.39 Nevertheless, both positions ultimately raise the issue of somatic limits in different ways. If aniconicity implies hallucination, one ought to consider what the image creator/user intended to convey about transcendence of human consciousness and the (ecstatic?) dissolution of heads rather than, say, legs. If aniconicity implies artistic limitations, it still reflects choices in the detailing of certain parts of the human anatomy over others. This might be another indication of somatic compartmentalisation and hierarchy. The differential detailing of 'religious' bodies also demarcated somatic limits, especially the meticulous renditions of certain personages.401 would argue that, aside from the reasons of individualism and quality which may lie behind such attention to detail, other elements may be at play here: deliberate ambiguity and abstraction, socio-political representational agendas,41 or even attitudes towards accuracy of ritual and its equipment.42 PERFORMATIVITY Although performativity is too large an issue to fully address here,43 I would nevertheless like to propose that we can use this investigative lens in two distinct ways further to illuminate Minoan 'religious' bodies. The first way would be to examine the human performativity depicted in 'religious' iconography. The second way would be to examine the performativity between creators/users and the iconography (already touched upon earlier in this paper). 30 Simandiraki-Grimshaw and Stevens in preparation; Rehak 1995. 31 Cf. German 2000, who points out that gender in depictions of whole human bodies is sometimes constructed through simultaneous concealment of primary sexual organs and emphasis on secondary sexual organs, e.g. breasts (2000, 103).

For gender as performance, see discussion in Alberti 2001, 193-4.</page><page sequence="5">THE HUMAN BODY IN MINOAN RELIGIOUS ICONOGRAPHY Performativity in Minoan 'religious'iconography Several scholars have hypothesised that bodily postures in Minoan religious iconography imply a range of activities: Interactions of humans with other humans, super humans, artefacts, animals, natural and built environments;44 Degrees of interaction: coexistence, proximity, liminality, engagement; Gendered and often segregated types of interaction (e.g. subordination).45 And, I would argue: Scenes of mythical action;46 And hallucinogenic (?) visions.47 But if certain scenes, postures, hierarchies or modes of 'religious' bodily action are indeed repeated, I believe we need to steer away from the temptation to arrange them in a continuum of religious narrative. Such scenes may also represent acceptable somatic rubrics reproduced from artisan textbooks, the existence of which we suspect from the ways some motifs were transferred across two- and three dimensional media.48 These scenes may represent the owner's/user's/artisan's taste, imagination and pre ferences and nothing more. They may refer to secular rather than religious rituals. They may depict fairytales, epics, ideals or abstractions. One way to approach such performative iconography, therefore, is not to overly rely on one medium (e.g. gold rings) or one theme (e.g. flying) where active 'religious' bodies are encountered, but to combine such research more proactively with the notion of performance clusters.49 For example, one may wish to examine the occurrences of snakes on female anatomies throughout the Cretan Bronze Age and subsequently draw conclusions regarding (unchanged?) chthonic beliefs and the connection of females to the underworld. However, one could further contextualise such occurrences in their socio-political performative milieux. To revert to the Temple Repositories 'Snake Goddess' example, it is not enough to note her hetero somatic hybridity with snakes, and to connect her to previous and subsequent depictions of human snake interaction. Was the 'Snake Goddess' typical or atypical of the contemporaneous religious per formances in depictions and/or sites from the area of Knossos or the rest of Crete? What degree of intimacy did her visibility and tangibility command? And how does her context compare with other findspots of other human-snake complexes?50 Finally, what is the significance of the lacunae between the surviving depictions? By looking at performativity in combina tion with each milieu and site, we may thus reach a better understanding of the fluctuating renditions, significance and even ideological manipulations of the 'religious' Minoan body. Two performative motifs are worth our attention at this point, as they are often overlooked in favour of more unambiguous ones. These are the motifs of 'body shock' and corporal time. One example of'body shock' is the depiction of pregnant females and/or birthing scenes,51 which deserve further examination, beyond their potentially supplicatory role. They may have been intended as portrayals of an unusually changed and open human body, about to spring an additional being into existence. And their rendition only in three dimensional media may have carried ideological connotations. Similarly, extremely rare sexually excited52 or ailing bodies were perhaps intended as portrayals of conditions outside the 'norm', as a 'body shock' of a different type, and that is before we even consider questions of gender, age and status. The other performative motif is corporal time, the most obvious marker of which is age. This is denoted in three standardised ways: a) by physical attributes, e.g. baby anatomies and movements, ripe breasts; b) by cultural constructs of age, e.g. head hair manipulation (locks, beards); and c) by association of certain ages with certain environments and engagements. So, the age snapshot and the depth of time are denoted in this way, perhaps alluding to rites of passage, life stages etc. Corporal time is, however, additionally subtly marked by implied movement in 'religious' iconography53 and there is value in interpre tations of multiple human scenes as representing consecutive or parallel movement. For example, on the upper half of the Harvester Vase,54 the processing crowd denotes synchronised, spatially aligned, regular marching, punctuated by song and sistrum. Within this seemingly homogeneously flowing scene there are two 44 E.g. Morris 2001, esp. 248ff. where she sustains an argument regarding performative asymmetry in gesticular iconography; Berg 2004, esp. 28-30. 45 Marinatos 1995; German 2000. 46 E.g. the gold rings from Archanes-Phourni (Dimopoulou Rethemiotaki 2005, 127 top) and Poros (ibid., 128 top). 47 Cf. the 'Zakro Master' sealings (Weingarten 1983). 48 Cf. Walberg 1985; Blakolmer 1999. Polinger Foster also touches upon the transcendence of depiction tropes across media, e.g. 1997, 134. 49 Cf. Wedde 1999; Morris 2001. Morris makes a valid point about the usefulness of adopting such sociological lenses as kinesics, proxemics and haptics (2001, 247). 50 Simandiraki-Grimshaw and Stevens forthcoming. 51 Cf. the Protopalatial seated monkey (?) from Phaistos (Dimopoulou-Rethemiotaki2005,102; Polinger Foster 1982, pi. 35) and the Postpalatial anthropomorphic rhyton from Gournia (Dimopoulou-Rethemiotaki 2005, 94). 52 German 2000, 105-09. 53 Cf. the swinging (?) female from Ayia Triada (Dimopoulou Rethemiotaki 2005, 104). 54 Kanta 1998,100-01; Dimopoulou-Rethemiotaki 2005,186 9; Polinger Foster 1997, 134.</page><page sequence="6">ANNA SIMANDIRAKI-GRIMSHA W temporal and thematic interruptions. A short-term humorous anomaly occurs around a fallen youth (this is perhaps a Minoan expression of bathos). On the other hand, a long-term punctuation is expressed by the gap of age and appearance between the young, half-naked homogeneity of the procession, and the elderly, fully covered individualism of the procession leader. Performativity of Minoan 'religious' iconography The other side of somatic performativity is the relationship between 'religious' iconography and the human beings who made and used it. For the sake of this argument, I subscribe to the idea that both parties (the Minoan human beings and the iconography) had agency, hence my use of the term 'interaction'.55 As noted above, I believe we need to study Minoan 'reli gious' iconography and its depiction of and relationship to the human body not through a static, museum exhibition lens, but from an embodied, experiential perspective.56 For example, different religious iconographies would have demanded different creative performances, different physical movements of preparation and execution.57 They also would have played on different sensory agency between the embodied viewer and the depicted, two- and three dimensional bodies. In fact, the presence of physical bodies would have completed now incomplete religious iconography. The Knossos Miniature Frescoes58 were perhaps designed as more than visual renditions of far-away humans. If the room(s) they adorned was/were crowded in real life, with all the body heat, smells, flickering lights and echoes this may have entailed these frescoes would have created a compelling spatial, synaesthetic illusion of a much bigger crowd. In this, we ought to factor the variable build, age and potential eye conditions of the viewers. Similarly, if the steatite bull's head rhyton from the Knossos Little Palace59 was indeed used for libations, the physical human body holding its low relief mane, its muzzle or, more likely, its horns would have been the necessary 'live' part of an embodied religious iconography (e.g. imitating bull grappling). Lastly, a 'religious' scene worn on a finger presumably 'came alive'. It would become a beacon drawing visual attention to a living bodily part. It would have animated 'negative' bodies through its constant interplay with light.60 It would have created temporary, static, practical, 'positive' bodies when pushed into wet clay. This may tell us something about the manipulation and transfiguration of a depicted 'religious' body by a physical one (and vice versa). ABSENCE AND CONTAINMENT In my opinion, it is not enough to consider the human body in Minoan 'religious' iconography as an obvious, integral anatomical entity. Two issues to also consider are its absence and containment. Their importance becomes particularly apparent in the interpretation of depicted and actual ritual action. The Minoan 'religious' body in absentia includes depictions denoting, but not actually showing the human body. For instance, the faience effigies of female clothing from the Knossos Temple Repositories61 outline contours of the female human body which would probably not have been the case with a real (empty) dress. They even leave space for the low, open cleavage characteristic of the similar attire of the associated 'Snake Goddesses'. The point about the physical body completing a religious scene also applies here (see immediately above). The Minoan 'religious' body was also contained or a container.62 Three instances of the former are two cups from Archanes containing a human figure each,63 and a bowl from Palaikastro containing a shepherd and flock.64 What was the significance of the containment of the human form there? And would this be animated if other contents were added? The few known anthropomorphic vessels, instances of the human body as container, have mostly been connected in the bibliography with 'precious' liquids (water, milk65) and probable libation rituals.66 However, we also ought to examine if the whole or part of the body was con ceptualised as a container; what the original model 55 Cf. Alberti 2001, 191; Mitchell 2006, esp. 390-1; Hymes 1972; Goffman 1990. I thank T. Grimshaw for introducing me to the works of Hymes and Goffman. Also compare with Warren's (1988) framework. 56 Cf. Morris and Peatfield 2002. In fact, it is not enough to consider 'cultural patterning of bodily experience' alone, in this case the renditions of Minoan religious bodies and even their actions, but also 'the intersubjective constitution of meaning through that experience' (Csordas 1993, 140-1), in this case the interaction of ancient and modern human beings and the(ir) depicted bodies. 57 Including paint provision, grid-laying, paintbrush strokes, haste before the plaster dried out, larger arm movements, revision of the scene/body from several paces away from the depiction, perhaps textbook consultation, cf.

PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS In this paper I have briefly focused on theoretical and methodological aspects of the human body in Minoan 'religious' iconography. My first thought is that I see some value in diverging from the predominance of visuality, medium and theme, and instead giving priority to hitherto underestimated and under-utilised discourses. These can be depiction modes (including physicality and corporal limits), performativity, absence and containment, and may prove valuable investigative lenses towards a more rounded understanding of Minoan religious tangible and imagined corporeality. My second, related, thought is that, through such investigation, several motifs of Minoan religious corporeality emerge. These cast the human body simultaneously as a religious stage and performance in the service of memory, socialisation and spirituality. For instance, how often do we regard religious iconographic artefacts as synaesthetic memory structures or socially didactic devices? And how often do we consider the reciprocal agency of 'religious' iconography? Such considerations will be explored in more detail in the near future. My final thought concerns the historical variations of the Minoan body in 'religious' iconography. I am indeed guilty here of not examining 'religious' depictions by Minoan phase, an approach which I reserve for a larger publication. 1 do think, however, that concepts and manipulations of the Minoan human body, in religion and beyond, in the physical and the iconographic spheres, did change over time and per site, even though some motifs remained constant.68 It is therefore hoped that future research will address such fluctuations in two ways: firstly, by closely charting temporal and geographical occurrences across media and themes; and secondly, by examining the relationship between the physical, the depicted and the implied body.
