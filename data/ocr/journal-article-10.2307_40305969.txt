Musculoskeletal Changes in Mice from 20-50 cGy of Simulated Galactic Cosmic Rays. Radiat. Res. 112, 21-29 (2009). On a mission to Mars, astronauts will be exposed to a complex mix of radiation from galactic cosmic rays. We have demonstrated a loss of bone mass from exposure to types of radiation relevant to space flight at doses of 1 and 2 Gy. The effects of space radiation on skeletal muscle, however, have not been investigated. To evaluate the effect of simulated galactic cosmic radiation on muscle fiber area and bone volume, we examined mice from a study in which brains were exposed to collimated iron-ion radiation. The collimator transmitted a complex mix of charged secondary particles to bone and muscle tissue that represented a low-fidelity simulation of the space radiation environment. Measured radiation doses of uncolli- mated secondary particles were 0.47 Gy at the proximal humerus, 0.24-0.31 Gy at the midbelly of the triceps brachii, and 0.18 Gy at the proximal tibia. Compared to nonirradiated controls, the proximal humerus of irradiated mice had a lower trabecular bone volume fraction, lower trabecular thickness, greater cortical porosity, and lower polar moment of inertia. The tibia showed no differences in any bone parameter. The triceps brachii of irradiated mice had fewer small-diameter fibers and more fibers containing central nuclei. These results demonstrate a negative effect on the skeletal muscle and bone systems of simulated galactic cosmic rays at a dose and LET range relevant to a Mars exploration mission. The presence of evidence of muscle remodeling highlights the need for further study. ©2009 by Radiation Research Society INTRODUCTION A fundamental physiological property of the muscu- loskeletal system is the capacity to exhibit plasticity related to the health and lifestyle of the host organism. 1 Address for correspondence: 501 Rhodes Research Center, Clemson University, Clemson, SC 29634, e-mail: bateman@clemson. edu. Stimuli influencing muscle and bone homeostatic regulation, including nutrition, pharmaceutical agents, mechanical loading, and hormonal status, have been studied extensively (/, 2). However, while it is recognized that the environment related to prolonged space flight challenges the musculoskeletal system (3), the effects of space radiation are largely unstudied. The lack of mechanical loading has been examined widely as a stimulus for space flight-induced musculo- skeletal atrophy in astronauts. Analysis of the skeletal system of astronauts who flew on the International Space Station (ISS) for 4.3 to 6.5 months revealed significant cortical and trabecular bone loss in the vertebrae and proximal femur and significant decreases in estimated strength indices (4). Decrements induced by space flight were also seen for skeletal muscle volume, contractile strength (5, 6), and protein content (7, 8). These findings have been corroborated in rats flown in space that were found to have demonstrate a reduction in myofiber cross-sectional area that coincides with decreased muscle mass and muscle strength (9-11). In addition to changing muscle mass and strength, space flight can alter the metabolic phenotype of skeletal muscle. Histological and biochemical examination of skeletal muscle from mice flown in space revealed an increase in the percentage of muscle fibers expressing myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms Hx and MHC lib in the soleus muscle, a slow-oxidative muscle (12). This indicates a phenotype shift that may or may not depend on changes in muscle mass. Such shifts in myosin protein expression after space flight were not found in the primarily fast-type plantaris and gastrocnemius muscles. However, the gastrocnemius had decreased oxidative capacity as indicated by a reduction in citrate synthase activity (12). While it is clear that microgravity is a potent stimulus for muscle and bone atrophy, it is important to understand the effect of other environ- mental factors such as space radiation on these systems. While current long-duration space flight takes place on the ISS, future missions to the Moon and Mars will 21</page><page sequence="2">22 BANDSTRA ET AL. be beyond the protection afforded by geomagnetic shielding, so astronauts will be exposed to higher doses of radiation. The space radiation environment is a complex mix of ions from solar particle events (SPEs) and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR). The majority of GCR flux is from protons. While only 1% of GCR is composed of ions heavier than helium, these high-charge (Z) and high-energy (E) particles (HZE) have high linear energy transfer (LET): Approximately 41% of the dose equivalent is predicted to be from HZE particles with approximately 13% being from iron particles alone (75). Current estimates for travel time to and from Mars are from 8 to 12 months, with an overall mission duration of 30 to 36 months (14). Based on travel time and fluence of GCR particles, it is estimated are that an astronaut will receive a total dose of 0.4 to 0.5 Gy from GCR during a Mars mission (75, 16). In mice, a whole-body 2-Gy dose of several types of radiation relevant to space flight has a profoundly negative long-term effect on trabecular bone. High-LET and low-LET radiation had similar effects on trabecular volume fraction (-29% to -39%) and connectivity density (-46% to -64%), with iron ions eliciting changes of -34% and -46%, respectively (77). A significant increase in osteoclast number and activity has been shown to occur early after exposure to radiation and could contribute to this bone loss (18, 19). Chronic bone loss was also observed in rats by 9 months after exposure to a 2-Gy dose of iron particles, though it was associated with reduced body mass (20). After 1 Gy whole-body exposure to protons, mice had lower trabecular volume fraction (-13%), but a 0.5 Gy did not cause long-term atrophy (21). A few other studies have investigated bone loss using doses and types of radiation relevant to space flight (22-24). These studies have focused primarily on the effect of high doses of carbon-ion radiation. While exposure to relatively high doses of single types of ions present in GCR have been demonstrated to have negative effects on trabecular bone, the effects of mixed particle radiation on bone have not been investigated previously. Although investigations of the effects of radiation on muscle have been performed, they have been performed with high doses (&gt;15 Gy). The release of amino acids in rat muscle 4 to 6 h after exposure to 15 Gy y rays suggested protein breakdown (25). Three to 4 months after exposure to 16 Gy X rays, mouse soleus muscle had smaller masses and produced less force than in controls (26). To our knowledge, no studies examining the effects of radiation doses and types relevant to space flight on muscle exist. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of simulated galactic cosmic radiation on muscle fiber area and bone volume. We hypothesized that radiation would decrease bone volume and myofiber area. To determine this, we took advantage of an ongoing study in which mice were exposed to a collimated beam of accelerated iron ions directed at the animals' heads to examine changes in cognitive function. The high energy of the primary particles (1 GeV/nucleon) caused trans- mission of low doses of secondary particles to the mice that crudely represented a space-like radiation field. Therefore, we were able to characterize the musculo- skeletal response to a complex charged-particle radia- tion field. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Twenty-two male C57BL/6 mice were shipped directly from Harían Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN) to Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Group-housed mice were given access to a standard laboratory chow diet (Harían Teklad) and water ad libitum and kept in a temperature-controlled (18 to 26°C) and light-controlled (12-h light/dark cycle) environment. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at BNL. Irradiation and Dosimetry Up to four animals were exposed simultaneously to brain-only radiation at 16 weeks of age using a collimated beam of 1 GeV/ nucleón 56Fe26+ particles produced by the AGS Booster accelerator at BNL and transferred to the experimental beam line in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility. The delivered beam was restricted to 1 .2-cm-diameter circular apertures that covered the brain area of four animals. The collimator design was modeled by Cary Zeitlin, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Mark Shavers, NASA Johnson Space Center, using the transport code BRYNTRN (27), and the collimator was fabricated by Inland Technical Services (San Bernardino, CA). The collimator consisted of a 10-g/cm2 (8.40-cm) layer of polymethylmethacrylate, a 20-g/cm2 (7.41-cm) layer of aluminum, and finally an 8.5-g/cm2 (8.95-cm) layer of high-density polyethylene. The upstream acrylic layer slows down the primary ions with low-Z material to minimize fragmentation; the aluminum layer then attenuates the primary particles. The polyethylene layer attenuates low-Z fragments (e.g., protons, neutrons and ex particles) produced upstream. Four 1 .2-cm-diameter holes penetrate the material stack. For calibration, an NIST-traceable 1-cm3 Far West™ thimble chamber with an air-filled bulb and tissue-equivalent walls was placed at the target position behind the collimator apertures. Dose delivery and beam cut-off were controlled by three parallel-plate ion chambers positioned along the beam line upstream and downstream of the target plane and referenced to the calibration chamber. The 56Fe26+ ion beam was extracted at 1005 MeV/nucleon and had an energy at the target surface of 969.1 MeV/nucleon and an LET of 151.4 keV/ urn. The beam was delivered as 20 300-ms pulses per minute for an average dose rate of 4 Gy/min. The delivered dose was ±0.5% of the requested value. The reference number for the NASA-sponsored experimental campaign was NSRL-6, and the beam-line exposure conditions requiring head-only irradiations supported experiment no.

Histograms of track counts measured in CR-39 plastic nuclear track detectors exposed in front of the collimator (blue), behind the collimator (pink), and in the center (yellow) and edge (aqua) of the target column during 1 GeV/nucleon iron-ion irradiations. The histograms show how primary iron nuclei (peak at LET of 151 keV/um) are effectively attenuated by the composite collimator materials but that many light ion fragments (bins of LET &lt; 50 keV/um), dominated by helium ions and protons, are still transmitted. region. Using the same methods as in previous analyses (28), the leakage dose behind the collimator was determined to be 7.4% of the total dose in the target region, with a track-averaged LET of 14.9 keV/um. The LET spectra were measured in front of the collimator, behind the collimator, inside the target column, and at the edge of the target column (Fig. 1) using CR-39 plastic nuclear track detectors. The dose profile was measured using Kodak X-Omat V film to determine the dose surrounding the target region. Using the descriptions of the radiation and the distance of the anatomical location from the edge of the collimator, it was determined that the proximal humerus (cranial border of the visible gleno-humeral joint as viewed from dorsal surface) received 19.5% of the total dose, the midbelly of the triceps brachii received 10.2 to 13.0% of the total dose, and the proximal tibia received 7.4% of the total dose in the target region. Each animal was anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and placed in a custom bite-bar cradle to stabilize the head position. The cradles were then placed in a clear acrylic anesthesia box prealigned with the collimator and the beam line. Sedation was maintained with 2.5% isoflurane administered throughout the irradiation procedure. A single fraction of 2.4 Gy delivered to the brain of each irradiated animal (n = 11) resulted in a dose of 0.47 Gy to the proximal humerus, 0.24 to 0.31 Gy to the mid-belly of the triceps brachii, and 0.18 Gy to the proximal tibia. For the entire irradiation procedure, animals were under isoflurane anesthesia for an average of 10 min. Nonirradiated control mice (n = 11) were treated identically without being exposed to radiation. Study End Point Mice were killed humanely 9 weeks after irradiation. The long head of the triceps brachii was collected, glued to a tongue depressor at resting length using OCT, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane, and stored at -80°C. The tibiae and humeri were removed, cleaned of all non-osseous tissue, and stored in ethanol. Analysis of Bone Microarchitecture Bone sections of the proximal tibia and humerus were scanned by microCT (uCT40, Scanco Medical, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at State University of New York, Stony Brook, with an isotropic voxel size of 12 nm and an integration time of 250 ms. Subsequent analysis of microCT images was performed at Clemson University using Scanco software (v. 6.0). Trabecular bone was analyzed in the proximal tibia and proximal humerus regions beginning 300 urn distal to the growth plate (excluding primary spongiosa) and extending 1 .2 mm. Analysis determined microarchitectural parameters, including bone volume fraction (BV/TV), connectivity density (Conn.D), trabecular separa- tion (Tb.Sp), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), structural model index (SMI), and trabecular vBMD. Cortical analysis was performed on 30 slices (-0.36 mm) immediately distal to the site of trabecular analysis. Similar software was used to calculate cortical bone volume (Ct.BV; excluding marrow volume), cortical total volume (Ct.TV; including marrow volume), cortical porosity (Ct.Po), and polar moment of inertia (pMOI). Muscle Myoflber Morphology Transverse sections (14 urn) were cut from the triceps brachii muscle midbelly in a cryostat at -20°C and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) as described previously (29, 30). Muscle sections were then digitized at 400 X magnification and analyzed using a microcomputer and NIH imaging software (ImageJ) to determine cross-sectional area (CSA) (29, 30) and were grouped in 250-um2 increments. Approximately 150 myofibers were traced per sample. Central nuclei were quantified as reported previously (29, 30). Briefly, myofibers that contained a well-defined nucleus in the center of the fiber, approximately equidistant from the periphery/sarcolemma on either side, were defined as a central nuclei containing myofiber. Central nuclei are reported as the proportion of the total number of myofibers with centrally located nuclei.</page><page sequence="4">24 BANDSTRA ET AL FIG. 2.

Compar- isons between head-only irradiated and nonirradiated controls were assessed by two-tailed / tests for both muscle and bone analyses with SigmaStat Version 3.5 (Systat Software Inc., Richmond, CA). RESULTS Animal Mass Animal mass at the end of the study did not differ between control and irradiated groups (37.2 ± 0.5 g and 36.7 ± 0.8 g, respectively). The relative activity level of the mice, from the perspective of the potential for changing musculoskeletal loading, was not different between the groups. Micro CT Analysis of Trabecular and Cortical Bone Analysis of the trabecular bone in the proximal humerus via microCT revealed a significant 17% lower trabecular bone volume fraction (P &lt; 0.05; Fig. 2A) and a 4% lower trabecular thickness (P &lt; 0.05; Fig. 2B) in irradiated mice compared to controls, with no differ- ences in other trabecular bone parameters (Table 1). However, the proximal tibia showed no significant differences in trabecular bone volume fraction, trabec- ular thickness, or any other trabecular parameter. Analysis of the cortical bone in the proximal humerus showed several significant differences relative to control, including a smaller (6%) polar moment of inertia (P &lt; 0.05; Fig. 3A), greater (6%) cortical porosity (P &lt; 0.05; Fig. 3B), a smaller (3%) cortical total volume (P &lt; 0.05; Fig. 3C), and a smaller (4%) cortical bone volume (P &lt; 0.05; Fig. 3D). The proximal tibia showed no significant differences in cortical total volume, cortical bone volume, cortical porosity, or polar moment of inertia. Muscle Morphology The effect of radiation on muscle growth and remodeling 9 weeks after exposure was quantified. Myofiber size, myofiber size distribution, and central nuclei containing myofibers were examined in cross sections taken at the midbelly of the triceps brachii muscle and stained with H&amp;E. The mean myofiber cross-sectional area of the triceps brachii was not significantly different between irradiated and nonirradi- ated controls, indicating that normal muscle size was maintained after radiation exposure (Table 2). Mean myofiber cross-sectional area is not indicative of shifts in the muscle's distribution of large and small myofibers, which can occur with muscle remodeling. The distribu- tion of small myofibers, as determined by their cross- sectional areas, was significantly altered by radiation (Table 2 and Fig. 4). The irradiated muscle demonstrat- ed significantly fewer small-diameter fibers, while the percentage of large fibers was unchanged.

DISCUSSION Though we previously found no long-term effect of proton radiation on bone at 0.5 Gy (27), the results of the present study indicate a high-LET radiation effect on bone at lower doses. The estimated high-LET radiation dose for a Mars mission is of the order 0.4 to 0.5 Gy (75, 16); therefore, the observed effect at 0.47 Gy indicates a clear need for further investigation. This study also documents a deleterious effect on cortical bone from doses below 0.5 Gy. Similarly, our previous study with protons did not identify any negative effects on cortical bone for doses ranging between 0.5 to 2 Gy (27). Bone quality will be compromised significantly, with damage to both trabecular and cortical bone, resulting in a cascade of changes through the structure. For example, the loss of trabecular bone will result in a greater proportion of the loads placed on the skeleton being transferred to cortical bone. The decline in polar moment of inertia represents a reduced ability of this cortical bone to resist both torsional and bending loads, because pMOI is a function of bending moments of inertia. Additionally, any defect in the structure, such as a porous hole, will cause a stress concentration that further compromises structural competence. These structurally compromising changes do not mean that a fracture is imminent, even when combined with micro- gravity-induced bone loss, but the probability of fracture later in life is greater and depends on future regeneration or degeneration and the loads placed on the skeleton. An important consideration in this study is the representation of space radiation. During space flight, astronauts will be exposed to GCR with a broad spectrum of charges and energies. While the spacecraft will provide considerable shielding for solar and cosmic protons, the high energy of GCR limits shielding effectiveness for high-LET components (57, 52). The measurements on bone and muscle were conducted on tissues from animals whose treatment plan was opti- mized for other purposes, namely to observe effects on brain tissue, CNS damage and changes in cognitive function. The experiments were therefore "targets of opportunity" to take advantage of valuable animal</page><page sequence="6">26 BANDSTRA £T,4L. FIG. 4.

Frequency histograms and the frequency of fibers &lt;l,700um2 and &gt;3,000 um2 were compared by a one-group x2 analysis as described previously (29, 45). A statistical significance of P &lt; 0.05 was selected. materials. As a result, the bone and muscle exposures were to a complex and gradient field of secondary particles dominated by light ions, principally protons and helium ions, but also included neutrons. Figure 1 illustrates how primary iron nuclei (peak at LET of 151 keV/|im) are effectively attenuated by the composite collimator materials but that many light ion fragments (bins of LET &lt; 50 keV/^im), dominated by helium ions and protons, are still transmitted. The track-averaged LET for the unattenuated fragments is 14.9 keV/prn while that of the primary particles is 151.4 keV/|Lim. Scattering of primary ions and fragments in and out of the target volume results in intermediate particle mixtures and doses depending on the off-axis position. Behind the collimator the transmitted dose fraction was 7.4% of that delivered to the target. The inclusion of neutrons is particularly important because astronauts will be exposed to secondary neutrons created within the mass of the spacecraft shielding. Secondary neutrons result in high-LET tertiary particles with ranges of the order of micrometers to tens of micrometers throughout the target volume. Therefore, the radiation received at the proximal humerus, while not a high-fidelity representation of GCR, was a low-fidelity model of the complex radiation field expected inside a spacecraft. However, the actual exposure was essentially whole body with gradients of dose relative to the higher-dose head target (2.4 Gy iron ions), so volume and abscopal effects may have contributed to the overall responses. The complex nature of the radiation, which is very different than that examined previously, makes it difficult to compare to previous work. Because the response of cortical bone responded to the low dose of mixed particle radiation delivered in this study, and because cortical bone's response to higher doses of iron- and carbon-ion radiation has not been clearly demonstrated (17, 18), a broader set of measurements using varying charge and energy will be required to understand the biological effects of GCR. However, the clearly greater damage to cortical bone in this study compared to the higher doses of carbon (LET = 13 keV/jim) and iron ions (LET = 148 keV/jim) in this previous work suggest that exposure to this particular combination of mixed-type radiation could be significantly more damaging. Another important aspect of the radiation used in this study is dose rate. The total dose in this experiment was delivered in a relatively short period, of the order of minutes. However, the cumulative dose during a Mars mission will be delivered over the course of 30 to 36 months. It is possible that a lower, relatively constant dose rate would give bone and muscle time to repair or adapt to the radiation environment. However, the effects of dose rate for heavy ions are not well studied, and limited results from other tissue types suggest that neither lower dose rate nor fractionation of heavy-ion radiation significantly reduces the relative biological effect (RBE) (33-35). Further study is necessary to determine the effect of dose rate on the response of bone to heavy ions.</page><page sequence="7">MUSCULOSKELETAL RESPONSE TO SPACE RADIATION 27 During a Mars mission, astronauts will experience a complex and dynamic environment, including radiation and microgravity exposure. The results of this study indicate that radiation exposure from GCR may compromise bone quality. It is unclear how the combination of microgravity/reduced gravity and radi- ation will affect bone and muscle. It is possible that bone and muscle that are atrophied due to microgravity will be even more susceptible to radiation. Studies combin- ing skeletal unloading and radiation exposure of this type are necessary to determine the combined effect on the musculoskeletal system. Previous studies found cortical bone damage after very high doses of radiation (36, 37). However, fractionation of high doses mitigated these negative changes in fracture strength (36). Another investigation of both low-LET and high-LET radiation at doses of 2 Gy found some effects on cortical bone from carbon and iron ions, but they were not this severe (18). Similarly, our laboratory's thorough investigation of cortical bone after 0.5 to 2 Gy of proton irradiation found no effects (21). Although the data described here identifying clear damage to cortical bone may appear to contradict the previous findings, there are several factors to consider: The current study exposed the proximal humerus to a mixture of radiation types. It is possible that the combination of particles has a different effect on cortical bone than a single type of radiation. Time after exposure is also important. The previous study of the effects of 2 Gy iron- and carbon-ion irradiation examined bone 4 months after irradiation, while the current study examined bone 9 weeks after irradiation. It is possible that cortical bone was affected by the 2-Gy dose and recovered by 4 months. We have described a very rapid increase in osteoclast activity after exposure to moder- ate, 2-Gy dose of radiation (18); however, continued bone loss 9 weeks after exposure can be a result of many factors, including increased osteoclast activity, sustained declines in bone formation by damaging osteoblasts, and osteoblast precursors or altered neuronal control of growth and metabolic factors. To appropriately address these many possibilities, comprehensive time-course examinations need to be performed with detailed molecular analysis as a primary outcome. The difference in sex also represents an additional variable, with a clear hormone influence on bone mass. Finally, it should be noted that the current study used skeletally mature mice (16 weeks old), whereas the mice studied previously were 9 weeks old at irradiation. It seems unlikely, however, that cortical bone in older mice is more responsive to radiation than that in younger mice. This study demonstrates a response of trabecular and cortical bone to radiation in skeletally mature mice. Previous studies did not demonstrate gross effects on growth (17, 21), but the possibility that higher bone turnover rates in younger animals contributed to the response to radiation was not investigated/considered. Thus, while the current findings do not permit a direct comparison between this and other studies because of these different variables, the observed bone loss adds to our understanding of how radiation affects the skeletal system and identifies many additional questions to be addressed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine skeletal muscle morphology with fields of radiation that approximate space-flight conditions. Irradiated skeletal muscle has been examined widely in rodents at high doses (&gt;15 Gy) (38-41); irradiation of skeletal muscle decreases muscle adaptation to overload and inhibits muscle recovery from damaging stimuli. The mechanism behind attenuation of muscle plasticity by radiation is related to the inability to activate satellite cells for the initiation of myofiber growth and repair processes (41). Satellite cells are resident skeletal-muscle myoblasts that contribute to myofiber growth and repair (40). However, the 15+ Gy dose of radiation is much greater than that used in the current study, which attempted to mimic space-flight radiation. In the current study, irradiated mice demonstrated morphological evidence that muscle remodeling and regeneration had been induced by radiation. Irradiated muscle demonstrated a large increase in myofibers containing central nuclei. Since myofibers are densely packed with contractile protein, myonuclei are located on the periphery of the cell. Myonuclei located toward the interior of a fiber are markers of a regenerating fiber. Although there was no change in the mean myofiber cross-sectional area after irradiation, this analysis is not sufficient to detect shifts in the myofiber size profile that are indicative of muscle remodeling. Although increases in small-diameter myofibers can be found in regenerat- ing muscle after damage stimuli, we found a significant decrease in small-diameter fibers. The fiber size distri- bution in the irradiated muscle became more homoge- neous, having one distinct peak for fiber cross-sectional area. The small-diameter myofiber peak seen in control muscle was lost after irradiation. Further work is needed to determine whether this is an induction of muscle remodeling related to a phenotype shift or a loss of small-diameter fibers. It is possible that the high dose of high-LET iron ions to the brain (10X greater than background LET) affected the rest of the body. Out-of-field (abscopal) effects are well documented after irradiation (42, 43). A regional effect could account for a more prominent effect in the forelimbs than in the hindlimbs, but it seems more likely that an out-of-field effect would be systemic rather than regional. For example, head-only irradiation of mice with y rays or carbon-ion beams can cause alterations in follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels accompanied by</page><page sequence="8">28 BANDSTRA £T/IZ, reduced spermatogenesis (44). An absence of bone loss in the tibia indicates that the systemic effect on the skeletal system is minimal, but a regional effect may be present. Conclusions This study documents compromised structural integ- rity of bone in a space exploration-like radiation field. The dose range in which these changes were observed is expected for a mission to Mars. Damage to both cortical and trabecular bone would result in a skeletal structure that is less competent, leading to a greater probability of a future fracture. Changes in muscle fibers representing altered modeling are also reported, though their effect on muscle function is less clear. Weightlessness has known effects on the musculoskeletal system, and additional challenges from radiation could further compromise these closely linked structures and possibly lead to accelerated atrophy of both tissues. Further study is needed to investigate the mechanisms behind these changes and ultimately enable testing of appropri- ate countermeasures.
