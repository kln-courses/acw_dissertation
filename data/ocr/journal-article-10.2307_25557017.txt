<plain_text><page sequence="1">jasper mckinney and ann Mccormick Peacock Gallery, Craigavon 3-30 September, 1985 There is something about Jasper McKinney's sculpture and more particularly his drawings, which sets you looking for a disconcertingly evasive thread to a story. The way in which his images are presented, in whatever medium, frequently suggests a concern with narrative or anecdote, not in a continuous sense but rather as though we are allowed glimpses or snips of some slightly absurd drama and are then left, infuriated or bemused, to conjure how the story has come this far and to draw our own conclusions. There is a seeming wilfulness in only revealing part of what appears to be a much longer fable, but revealing it with a compelling vividness, and in that sense the work could be described as being strongly pictorial rather than illustrative. The viewer is only permitted to picture as much as the artist will allow, rather than be provided with a key to a larger whole. The extrication of a thread or threads of progression on a formal level proved almost as difficult. The sculptural work as a body demonstrated a slightly flirtatious awareness of a range of fashionably contemporary concerns, though running in reverse order to touch on Opie cartoon cut-outs backwards to the early seventies Flanagan anthropomorphic rocks; thus moving also from bright painted colour to natural stone and subtly patinated metal. The sculpture dates from 1982 to the present and at the outset McKinney deals with the depiction of places non specific (Tennis Court) and specific ? Methody, a humorous Hammer-House of-Horror rendering of the artist's alma mater. Ski Lift at Badgastein was an unexpectedly successful piece, given the difficulties of dealing with landscape in a sculptural form. The supporting legs of the lift structure, carved in a fairly basic fashion from wood, sat upside-down, 'feet' in the air. A ballooning metal cushion of lush green Swiss (?) landscape was supported in between, sloping to the floor where a large red wheel was embedded in the verdure. By choosing to ignore the kinetic aspect of his subject the artist has inverted at least some of</page><page sequence="2">CIRCA 30 our expectations. Ski-Lift has no point of rest for the eye, no physical 'base' and yet, despite its distinctly awkward appearance, continues to lead the viewer in a dizzying approximation of its cyclical journey. Most of the remaining sculpture was made during this year and used themes that were also taken up in the drawings, titles that had an attractive or witty ring that was not always borne out in the final resolution. Phone call from a Pharaoh however, was a work of disarming simplicity ? a pyramidal relief of beaten and discoloured copper, from the top of which extended a rudimentary telephone receiver of wire and roughly carved and stained wood. It was a subtle combination of visual pun with an element of temporal impossibility. In other cases, works with seemingly irresistible titles, such as the four drawings Pig in a Fishbowl and the sculpture Pig Coming Out of a Fishbowl, remained memorable as titles alone. What Iassume to be the most recent of McKinney's sculpture seems to have moved away from depiction to a more abstracted (though not abstract) version of things: Horse Bridge, a beaten metal relief, is identifiable as neither horse nor bridge but contains traces or echoes of both. An Old Man and a Pelican Touch is as enigmatic as its title, a cliff like plinth of Portland stone on top of which balances a carved piece of the same stone partially covered in cut-out beaten copper sheet, echoing variously animal and skull shapes, beaks and bones as the angle of view changes. On top of this lies a tiny polished stone 'figure'. The most overwhelming effect is of viewing something massive from a great height or distance, the opposite to that achieved in Fallen Hair. Of the drawings, Bride in a Petrol Station, certainly lived as long in the memory as its incongruous title. The aforementioned bride floated, head dipping slightly forward, like a low flying kite above translucent waves. The layers of blue wash revealed floating petrol-pumps, a zig-zag forecourt canopy and patches of texture suggestive of manhole coverings etc. This Bride drawing constituted but one in an occasional series on a nuptial theme. This is Jasper McKinney's first major exhibition since completing degree and post-graduate courses, and it seems safe to conclude that pretty well all the work in this quite large show (thirty-five pieces) was completed during those courses. This highlights, and in part answers, some of the questions thrown up whilst trying to pick a way through, what at first, seemed to be a rather eclectic melange of styles and images. An exhibition of this size, at this point in an artist's career inevitably includes an amount of work which is formative rather than fundamental. McKinney has obvious energy and humour, and a considerable facility in both drawing and various sculptural media, but would be well-served by some effort to focus his concerns. It is interesting to speculate how different McKinney's show might have appeared had he been showing in the smaller of the two exhibition spaces where on this occasion Ann McCormick presented recent paintings. The work of two artists is pretty well completely unrelated, except in the sense that McKinney's concerns and method range far and wide while Ann McCormick demonstrates a clearly singleminded and quite concentrated approach to painting, stylistically based in abstract expressionism, uninterested in flirting with fashionability. (It is partially because of this and partially because McCormick's show was so much smaller that the two artists are afforded apparently disproportionate representation.) The works ranged in scale from some quite tiny paintings on paper through to two largish canvases measuring about six feet high by five feet wide. Flamenco, one of the 'miniature' paintings, featured a suitably fiery flare of energy, though it seemed as though it could have been but one amongst many small ^R2LM^JI^y!\.'9JtV Play'' (not in exhibition).

Acrylic on canvas, 1985. sketchbook works whose value is greater in sum than individually; likewise Fido VII with its funny little doggy felt-tip scrawl. At the other end of the scale, the large canvases felt a little unwieldy for McCormick to manipulate successfully. Both Fringe Folk and Coming to Ground (predominantly an acid yellow) used a more limited range of hues than some works a tenth of their size and demonstrated a harshness of colour which did not seem characteristic of the rest of her work. In spite (or maybe because) of the fact that Fringe Folk contained elements which appeared to relate more closely to the figuration suggested by the title, this painting and Coming to Ground both had a lack of resolution. Both felt as though they could have stood a good deal more working ? certain areas looked as though they were the rapid underpainting for further more complex layers ? and I wondered whether this tentativeness was actually a result of searching (during the last year) for a means of putting more 'body' into the paint and painting. McCormick's work from her '84 MA show had a lighter handling and a more delicate use of drawing with paint. It was in the middle scale range of works on paper that the artist seemed to really find her pace. The Tiger and the Yellow Man used spots and stripes like animal markings, with layering and scraping giving way to gleaming dark greens, reds, ochre and sooty black. In Springfling a 'nest' shape of brown and pale wedgwood blue, overlaid with egg/feather shapes, provided the off centre motif for a rich range of colours, marks and degrees of paint transparency. The pictorial unity and depth that this created lessened the material dominance of the paint. The possibilities demonstrated in the smaller works would seem to suggest that given time and application the large-scale canvases might achieve similar success ? if that is what McCormick wants. There is nothing to say that a work has to reach a particular square-footage before it can be taken seriously. Deirdre O'Connell</page></plain_text>
