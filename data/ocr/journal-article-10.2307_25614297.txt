BENSTON Of all the beings that are, presumably the most difficult to think about are liv ing creatures, because... they are in a certain way most closely akin to us, and ... are at the same time separated from our ek-sistent essence by an abyss. ?Heidegger, "Letter on Humanism" HEIR TO THE DIVIDED ARISTOTELIAN VISION OF NONHUMAN CREATURES AS, ALTERNATELY, MUTE FOILS (POLITICS 9; BK. 1, SEC. 2) AND BEHAV ioral mirrors (Parts 138-39, bk. 2, sec. 4) of "man," the properly "po litical" animal, animal studies has displayed uncertainty about how and where to draw species boundaries. Among the provinces of this field of inquiry, none is more defined by this tension than laboratory biomedical research, where physiological correspondences under write animal models of human maladies, while presupposed onto logical distinctions justify the consignment of nonhuman animals to treatment considered improper for human subjects. Conventionally, those distinctions have centered on a cluster of intellectual capabil ities?reasoning, speaking, intending, remembering?the dearth or deficiency of which abrogates the nonhuman s right to dissent and le gitimates the human claim of priority. "Animal studies" in this sense, designating a wide range of investigative operations employing non human animal bodies, posits material resemblance and metaphysical incompatibility between researcher and the object of research. It has been the self-assigned task of an entirely different mode of animal studies?the interdisciplinary formation arising in the past three decades that views human/animal relations as a problem for historical, sociological, and cultural analysis?to intervene in bio medical animal studies by contesting assumptions of mentalistic and moral difference. Building on the revolution in cognitive ethology associated with Donald Griffin (Animal Thinking and Question) and his successors, this cultural form of animal studies has challenged its biomedical counterpart by locating putatively distinguishing fea tures of "human" identity in the nonhuman experimental figure. Thus setting the researcher and the specimen eye to eye, cultural KIMBERLY W. BENSTON is Francis B. Gum mere Professor of English and director of the Hurford Humanities Center at Haver ford College.

Benston 549 animal studies strategically inverts animal and human "modeling" by making "human" substance (rational, cultural, and moral capa bility) the measure of animal identity. But as the border between animal and human has become blurred by evolutionary genetics (genome sequencing now establish ing between human beings and chimpanzees a mere one degree of separation [Clark et al. I960]) and ethological inquiry (demonstrat ing in a range of animals a plethora of at tributes, from self-consciousness to tool use, once thought unique to human cognition [Beckoff and Jamieson; Rogers]), biomedical and cultural animal studies have drawn closer together, bridging once-strict divisions be tween scientific inquiry inside the lab and so ciological interrogation of the lab. Indeed, in the lab, the inaugural divorce of instrumental and ethical impulses?famously propounded by physiology's founding visionary, Claude Bernard: "A physiologist is not a man of fash ion, he is a man of science ... he no longer hears the cry of animals he ... perceives only organisms concealing problems which he in tends to solve" (103)?yields to practical ac knowledgment of the animal's claim on the scientist's concern in the form of institutional animal care and use committees (IACUCs), whose constitution as self-regulatory guard ians of "care and use policies" (Rozmiarek 2) indicates biomedicine's acceptance of cul tural animal studies' analytic and normative frameworks. As the mom in Ann Gernhardt's biomedical-industry-sponsored picture book The Importance of Being a Mouse tells her daughter in a tale of the generic mouse's he roic role in experimental inquiry (the title's sprightly wink to Oscar Wilde casting an air of seeming shame turned exuberant rev elation), "Remember, honey, because of the scientists, doctors, and lab animals working as research teams, animals and people have healthier and safer lives" (8). Mom's vision of cross-species collabora tion in the common interest of "life" depicts the lab as a space where situational, functional, legal, somatic, and ontological differences be tween human and nonhuman beings dissolve into a community of shared praxis and pur pose. Yet before we celebrate the birth of an enlightened rapport of human and nonhuman animal, we must attend still to the perhaps aptly named daughter, Lucinda, who has the story's last words: "I'll think about that some more" (8). For indeed complications, or cracks, in the aforementioned paradigm of harmoni ously blended "being" appear when we take even a cursory look at material and structural realities sustaining such "research teams." These complications exceed the simple practical and historical elisions that, under standably, Gernhardt's narrative must fur tively enact to unfold its unruffled pedagogy, such as the reported euthanization of nearly seventy percent of all commercially bred male mice after birth (they're often deemed too ag gressive for experimental use)1 or the ongoing debate among scientists themselves regarding the empirical efficacy of extrapolating thera peutically from animals to human beings.2 Of greater value to an understanding of the current state of scientific and cultural ani mal studies are core features of the mandate, rhetoric, and (above all) conceptual founda tion of the IACUC, through which biomedi cine putatively synthesizes "care and use." Formulated in response to legislation passed by Congress in 1985 governing animal re search (the National Institutes of Health Re authorization Act and the amended Animal Welfare Act), IACUCs in the United States (much like their European counterparts) oversee research facilities, paying particular attention to pain control, habitat conditions, and euthanasia protocols. IACUCs review research proposals by following guidelines set by an ensemble of federal and state agen cies that, broadly speaking, generate an aura of juridical oversight affirming the experi mental animal as a sentient, conscious, and morally significant subject.

This consistent thread of exception work ing itself through the IACUC discourse of welfare should compel us to view the interac tion of laboratory and cultural animal stud ies through a new lens, as we set aside our account of an evolving dialogue of discover ies and disciplines and seek instead to evalu ate the underlying system of assumptions guiding animal studies' rhetoric of legal and moral valuation. For when we find ourselves at a juncture where rights are suppressed the moment they are invoked, where biological fact (such as murine animality or animals' ex perience of pain) is put under erasure by legal decree, where life as such becomes subject to a procedural regime, and where procedure itself becomes everywhere entangled with a logic of exception, we have entered the realm Fou cault called "biopower," in which metaphysi cal imperative instead of political or cultural rationality holds sway. Suffusing the IACUC's mandate, the language of exception is not an episodic variable opposing or standing outside the rule but becomes indistinguishable from the regulatory structure itself, foregrounding science as the pervasive potentiality of adju dication per se. Through the welfarist design coauthored with cultural animal studies, bio medicine thus asserts nothing less than what Giorgio Agamben terms "sovereign power," or the exercise of an authority that is both inside the law (as final arbiter) and outside the law (as the force deciding the limit as well as the pur view of judgment): the metaphysical task par excellence through which the very terms of existence?life, being, animal, human?are not merely defined but produced in a "decision" seemingly beyond interrogation or appeal. "Seemingly," because we are now examin ing how animal studies (in all its senses) has become what we could call, again after Agam ben, a threshold domain: a "zone of indistinc tion" (4) where the law engages yet excludes that which has no legal standing, where the right to life becomes enmeshed with protocols of death, where (to evoke, with Agamben, Ar istotle's idiom) zoe (the basic fact of animate life: "animality") remains visible within bios ("raw" animality "cooked" into a form of life proper to an individual or a collective: "cul ture"). Seen from this vantage of coming to, and existing as, a threshold, animal studies faces simultaneously the challenge of an im passe?the threshold as a limit of our ability to think the human and the animal, in them selves and especially in their relation?and the necessity of renegotiation: the threshold as an interim arrival point for institutional and intellectual history from which we must organize a new mode of departure. Appro priately, recent work on the philosophical im port of human/animal relations has argued the need to view "the question of the animal" and "the question of the human" as reciprocal conundrums, recognizing that further insight into material, historical, and ethical features of these questions can no longer bracket metaphysical concerns; rather, it must place them at the heart of animal studies' analytic and pragmatic agenda. Such scholars as Cary Wolfe, Ralph Acampora, and Matthew Ca larco have begun to forge what we might term a critical animal studies (CAS), seeking at</page><page sequence="4">12 4-2 j Kimberly W. Benston 551 once to historicize and to radicalize "the hu man" and "the animal" as diacritical figura tions that, far from being granted to research as stable or prefabricated beings, must be con tinuously reimagined and reconstituted. By thus grasping "the human" and "the animal" equally as effects, not grounds, of what the human and life sciences count as knowledge, meaning, and propriety, cultural animal studies becomes a project capable of identifying the conceptual machinery manu facturing our contradictory relations to ani mals (e.g., the animal as family member / the animal as food; the animal as totemic em blem / the animal as abject clown; the animal as subject of protection / the animal as captive property). With the modest aim of furthering animal studies as a freshly motivated critical enterprise, I'd like to suggest that central to this conceptual machinery is its generation of the human as though "the human" were, in fact, not produced but natural, not belated and contingent but essential and normative? a perspective complementary to biomedicines production of the "animal" as that life which, in being simultaneously recognized and ex cluded by a juridical order, affirms the origi nary sovereignty of that order. More precisely, this labor of metaphysics?which upholds the disciplines that construct epistemologi cal models of human/animal likeness while assuming political authority over nonhuman existence?operates covertly as a form of an thropomorphism, the essential expression of which is sacrifice (a term that suggestively appears in the rhetoric of biomedical labora tory practice [Arluke; Phillips]). For while an thropomorphism and sacrifice might seem, in historical terms, polar substitutive practices (human for animal vs. animal for human, re spectively), ideologically they converge as tech nologies for making and enlarging "humanity" by effacing (writing over, killing) animality, a process in which violence is euphemized and transvalued in celebration of idealized being (cf. Derrida 112-16; Guyer 104-40). The conjunction of anthropomorphism and sacrifice at a site of rigorously anti rhetorical, postirrationalist, and fundamen tally instrumental inquiry like biomedical research?as in other arenas of animal "care and use" such as agriculture, zoos, and pet owning homes?may seem at first blush coun terintuitive. But this presumed antithesis of pre- or antimodern practice and shibboleths of modern enlightenment must be the object of critique for contemporary animal studies. An illuminating gloss or foreshadowing of this project comes to us in H. G. Wells's The Island of Dr. Moreau, that grimly exuberant fantasia of proto-transgenic animal experimentation, a text that has emerged in recent literary inflec tions of animal studies as a reminder of bio medicine's genesis in an atmosphere already heated by competing currents of antivivisec tionist and anti-Darwinian fervor (Harris; Turner). Narrated by a gentleman naturalist, Prendick, the novel centers on Moreau's exile to an isolated space where the doctor, unfet tered by RSPCA protests or anticruelty leg islation, enjoys the freedom to exorbitantly transform animal bodies into humanoid fig ures. The inevitable gothicism of the narra tive's mise-en-scene has shaped interpretation of Wells's fabulism, but were we to imagine an IACUC descending on Moreau's island, impos ing regulatory checks on his experimental pro cedures, the tale would not unravel so much as crystallize as an inquiry into how we produce "the human" by transfiguring "the animal." Stripped of its melodramatic trappings, The Island of Dr. Moreau makes visible thresholds of being and understanding that shape the metaphysical crux of humanity's relation to its own and other creatures' animality. Two framing moments of the story illu minate the crisis of interpretation for which anthropomorphization and sacrificial logic offer imaginative, if impossible, solutions. Here, first, Prendick explains his budding awareness of Moreau's experiments: "I could stand it in that confined room no longer.

It was as if all the pain in the world had found a voice_[I]n spite of the brilliant sunlight... the world was a confusion, blurred with drift ing black and red phantasms ..." (59). The modulation in Prendick's perception of the vivisected animals screams from the af fective (animalistic) appeal of a "cry" to the in tentional (humanoid) articulation of a "voice" works as both figure and materialization of Prendick 's threshold experience. In turn, this aporia of "cry" and "voice" bears a kind of ex plication (or even confession) of the ambiguity and irresolution in Moreau's seemingly defini tive pursuit. For Moreaus experiments don't simply assume but continuously enact the idealism of anthropomorphization through which the ambiguities of animality (is it mere existence or a secret repository of meaning shaping capacities?) would be dissolved into the certainties of human identity. Wells cap tures this process of anthropomorphic trans formation by interrupting it: Moreau's new creatures, situated physically and socially at the threshold of animality and humanity, are cannily named "Beast People." Through this combination of event and philology, Wells's narrative provides the insight that anthropo morphism inheres not just in Moreau's literal effort to "humanize" the island's animal pop ulation but, precisely, in the way his effort's failure exposes the aim of this literalization to be a repression of the contingency, the figural ity, of "animality" and "humanity" as such. Moreau's desire to naturalize, to de figure, the human by "burn[ing] out all the animal" in a literal holo-caust of biomedical transformation signals the sacrificial logic of his project's anthropomorphism (120). When Prendick, in the second key moment framing his experience of Moreau's undertaking, finds himself face-to-face with the Leopard Man "quarry" (such topoi of the hunt signaling the emergence of a sacrificial thematic [Burkert 11-82]), this dynamic surfaces in a burst of affectively charged violence: It may seem a strange contradiction in me?I cannot explain the fact?but now, seeing the creature there in a perfectly animal attitude ... and its imperfectly human face distorted with terror, I realized again the fact of its humanity. ... I slipped out my revolver, aimed between its terror-struck eyes, and fired. (147) Prendick perceives that the "mark of the beast" on the Leopard Man?the hybrid figure's con fused relation to the crucible of pain and trepi dation in which he's been baptized by Moreau's experiments?is what makes him seem so "hu man." Carrie Rohman's reading of the scene as an "inversion of the traditional humanist subject position, which abjects and represses animality... as an a priori... element of the human," admirably captures the historical un derpinnings of Prendick's disturbance (131), though I would suggest that the moment's central concern may be the undecidable rela tion of "animal attitude" and "human face": the former, which appears "perfect" as the always-already-existing (or a priori,) embodi ment of a life form (zoe), confronts the latter as the processural, "imperfect" prosopopoeia of a form of life (bios). To inflect this Aristotelian and Agambean vocabulary yet further, what Prendick "sees" here is the aporia of zoe and bios in any creature. Likewise, as suggested by the mirroring structure of Prendick's encoun ter with "the creature," the bestial hallmarks of terror and confusion are what provoke and threaten the human assertion of sovereign power: they are what drive us to the biomedi cal research we hope will drive away ani mality's mortal limitations, and they are the grounds for an identification that leads us, in a final paradox, to expunge this dread through sacrifice of our fearful animal doppelganger. Read beyond its sensational portrayal of vivisection, The Island of Dr. Moreau clarifies the fractured anthropomorphism by which scientific animal studies seeks, through the exercise of sovereign and sacrificial power on animal being, to produce and purify the hu</page><page sequence="6">12 4-2 ] Kimberly W. Benston 553 man. Historically, this extirpation of animal ity in Homo sapiens sapiens has presumed a purely "human" residuum of feeling and consciousness?a presumption rendered in creasingly suspect by post-Darwinian ethol ogy, evolutionary biology, cultural animal studies, and indeed biomedical experimenta tion. In the wake of such challenges to spe cies demarcation, the amelioration of animal suffering, not just of human dis-ease, has be come an explicit task of both scientific animal studies and animal rights activism (however opposed they remain in political terms). At the same time, the asymmetrical structure of human/animal relations remains in place in the conduct of animal experimentation (in the time you will have taken to read this essay, several thousand animals will have been sur gically or chemically altered, mined for data, and then "sacrificed" in research labs).3 What might this contemporary form of Aristotle's double vision of the animal as meaningfully like and radically other than humanity mean for critical animal studies? And, in turn, what contributions to the theoretical and material understanding of contemporary animal ex perience and human/animal relations might CAS be prepared now to make? First, CAS's effort to probe the metaphysi cal imperatives of spaces (labs, zoos, farms) and practices (experimentation, entertain ment, food production) where the modern animal comes in contact with human desire ought to spur, not foreclose, fresh political and ethical analysis. For CAS can both help us ex plore how such imperatives generate the con ditions of possibility governing any politics of human/animal relations and delineate com plementary contours of ethical consideration (including those of an animal rights agenda). Just as the ending of The Island of Dr. Moreau leaves Prendick restive and less certain of the proper function of "human" values in the or der of natural creation, so a critical animal studies should provide us the means of deep ening our demand for an animal ethics that cannot be subsumed by the procedural agree ments governed by regulatory structures. Second, by interrogating rather than as suming the categories of "human" and "ani mal," CAS can, while remaining responsibly historicized and situational, return us to on tological questions that inhere in any decision we might authorize regarding (say) environ mental, economic, or social policy affect ing life forms. As in cultural theory, in the sphere of animal studies we are well served by a mode of critical inquiry that pinpoints contingencies that might vitiate programs of reform and redress, making more visible the conditions under which genuine awareness and attendant change can be achieved. And finally, returning us to the philosoph ical question of embodied value and the histor ical question of emancipation while fortifying our appreciation of the nonhuman animals place in our traditions formulations, CAS can help us reopen the abiding problem of justice as we gain a more encompassing vision of its proper "subject." For even as justice poses at its core the consequences of perceived (un)likeness among creatures, so CAS might best become a practice that nudges us to the threshold where disparate forms of life meet in uncoercive com munity and unfettered singularity.
