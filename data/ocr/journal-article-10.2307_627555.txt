<plain_text><page sequence="1">'A BOOK TO KEEP' (An address in commemoration of Professor R. R. Marett) IF what I am giving you this afternoon is little more than a series of rather conjectural reflections about well-known matters, my excuse is that I was tempted by an invitation from an old and highly valued pupil to speak in memory of an intimate companion of the distant days when I was young, a companion from whom I learnt much. Marett, like Frazer and Jane Harrison and others, used his knowledge of Greek as a bridge towards the study of anthropology in general. It is a specially helpful bridge, because the Greeks, with their extraordinary command of literary expression, have left articulate evidence about their thought and feelings and customs at a stage of development when other peoples had no literature. One is always surprised at the coexistence in Greece of the highly developed and the utterly primitive. Dr. Galton in a speculative guess at the intelligence quota of different human groups put the fifth-century Athenian about twice as high as the nineteenth- century Londoner; yet an Athenian army was reduced to terror by an eclipse of the moon, con- temporaries of Thucydides worshipped at the Diasia an imaginary enormous snake, and while Aristotle was writing his treatise on dramatic poetry some of his contemporaries were introducing Ludi Scenici to Rome as a medicine against a pestilence. The great essentials of poetic feeling and perhaps the great insolubles of philosophy seem to have existed in many primitive peoples, but somehow they did not preserve their poetry or inspira- tion as the Greeks did, they did not work it up into the same Cosmos or artistic perfection, as a thing of permanent value. We may remember the South Sea Island chief who discussed his poetry with Stevenson. When asked what it was mostly about he gave the admirable answer: ' Oh, sweet- hearts and the sea; not all-same true, you know, all-same lie.' He had the root of the matter in him, like Anacreon or Alcaeus, but it passed as the moment of inspiration passed; no one thought of preserving those songs. When a certain much-loved Governor of Papua died, delegates from a number of villages to the number of 8ooo gathered in what the Greeks would have called a great Panegyris. They fasted for thirty days, and then an old Headman made a long, formal, and really beautiful *,T-ra1CpToS A6yos. An English reporter happened to be present, and so we know about it; otherwise it would never have occurred to the author or his companions to preserve it. A parallel to Hesiod or Orpheus, again, can be seen in those Gilbert Island accounts of the origin of the world of which Sir Arthur Grimble has told us. Many varying accounts are current, but only one par- ticular prophet-king can speak with real authority. What he says is the inspired truth, when he feels inspired to give it; and even he, so we are informed, does not by any means always say the same. Nothing apparently was preserved except in memory, nothing reduced to Cosmos. Not only had no Prometheus given to man in those places the gift of ypd~prra, 'the all-remembering instrument, whence every Muse is born '. They had not even formed, it would seem, the desire for such a gift, except for a few practical purposes. My real theme to-day is to study the growth of this conception of a Book as an artistic unity, a thing to be preserved for ever. One may well apply to the whole process of Greek literature, and perhaps even of Greek civilisation, the famous phrase of Anaxagoras about the origin of the world, that ' all things were mixed up-a chaos, a confusion, what the Book of Genesis expressively calls a Tohubohu-until Nous, intelligence or mind, came and put them in order'. It is a gradual formation of Cosmos; a process of order, of coherence, of enlightenment and lucidity, an advance involving sometimes a loss which is hard to define, as we move from the "TrElpov to the realm of -rpcpas; one can see such a movement from the oracles of Heraclitus and Pythagoras to the definitions of Prodicus and Pro- tagoras; from the poetry of Aeschylus, who, in the words of a great contemporary, ' did things right without knowing how ', to that of a generation which knew all the approved rules of aopicq rather too well and sometimes, like our own eighteenth century, wronged its own poetic genius by following the rules too self-consciously. There is a somewhat similar change from the imaginative ease and abundance of Herodotus' style to the artificial clarity of Lysias or Isocrates. It is a movement, in the happy phrase of Professor J. A. K. Thomson, from a Prophetic Age to a Classical, from an age which spoke from inspiration to one which studied and spoke from Sophia and books. In actual philosophy, of course, the process is pretty clear. Heraclitus never argues, he reveals mysteries: 'All things flow.' 'The age-or the World-is a child playing'. 'Our life is a death of uXvaci, souls, their life is our death ', and so on. But even the Ionian group of philosophers, some- times considered too aridly materialist, have, as Cornford has emphasised, a good deal of the prophet in them. Thales, too, pronounced that all things were 'full of gods '. Anaximenes proclaimed our souls to be air, and air the living soul of the universe. Anaximander saw all individual existence as an act of aggressive injustice for which every individual thing must pay retribution by returning according to the law of Dike into that from which it had emerged. Philosophy was brought to VOL. LXXIV. E</page><page sequence="2">50 GILBERT MURRAY greater precision partly by the Sophists and Socrates, but also, I think, by the influence of two real sciences. First by mathematics, which implied and demanded exact measurement-always an embarrassment to prophets; and also, I would suggest, by the science of medicine, which in Greece developed surprisingly early and in the hands of Hippocrates rejected magic and tried to base itself on records of objective observation. There is significance in Thucydides' detailed account of the symptoms of the plague, nor was it for nothing that Aristotle's father was a professional doctor, trained to observe and record facts and symptoms. The process is clearest of all in the realm of History, where Nous had to produce some order or Kosmos out of a most confused superabundance of tradition. Hecataeus, the first prose writer (fl. 520-516), knows his own purpose. ' I write as seems to me to be true, for the traditions of the Greek are 'rroXi2ol KC(l yYE2Toi, which here means, I would suggest, not merely 'numerous and ridiculous ', but 'inconsistent and ridiculous '. There were many Logoi, or versions, about the same subject. What did Hecataeus really do? He was, according to Heraclitus, who paid few compliments, a man of great learning, though little sense. He knew a great quantity of X?6yoi and p0eoi and selected the versions that seemed most probable. He has much to say about the Caly- donian Boar, and the Argonauts and Deucalion, and he seems to have thought that, in some sense, the Ram of Phrixus really spoke. Yet he sometimes rationalises. Cerberus, the Hound of Hell, was a deadly snake so nicknamed, which infested the so-called 'mouth of Hell' on Mt. Tainaron. He makes intelligent criticisms; for instance, in noting the nationalist bias of the Athenian account of the expulsion of the Pelasgians from Attica (127). He observes that many of the legendary Kings were not Greeks, and that in very early times all Greece consisted of' barbarian settlements '. He gave valuable advice about geography to the lonians at the time of the revolt. He made a map of the world, and was credited with a sort of Gazetteer containing masses of detailed information about remote peoples and places; though, of course, such a collection would never be left as it came from the hands of the supposed original author. Everyone who made a copy of it would extend and improve it. Naturally this first bold creative effort had its weaknesses, as his successors were not slow to point out. Strabo says emphatically that he would sooner believe the poets. Herodotus in criticising Hecataeus' map, with its Ocean River encircling the earth, observes drily that he knows of no such river (ii. 19) and mentions with some malice the comment of the Egyptian priests on his claim to have had, sixteen generations ago, a divine ancestor. They had records going back to 345 successive priests, but no god had appeared during that time. Herodotus 'criticisms are well known. But the greatest flaw in Hecataeus' whole achieve- ment was its terrible incompleteness and its lack of any clear chronology. The next step in reducing chaos to Cosmos was taken by Hellanicus. In the first place he made a much wider and fuller collec- tion of logoi from all sources in the poets and in local traditions; then he made them into something like a complete story by dividing them into three classes, before, during, and after the Trojan War as a central date, and further by treating the whole story as a history of four great families, descended from Phoroneus, Deucalion, Atlas, and Asopus respectively. He followed his poets very closely, assuming that they were narrating real facts, but, as poets will, turning them into the marvellous. The miraculous fight of Achilles with the river god Scamander, for instance, was a real incident in which Achilles, going too far in advance of his troops, was cut off by a sudden flood of the kind that often occurs in that river owing to rain on Mt. Ida, but saved himself, just as Homer says, by clinging to an elm-tree. Similarly, the taking of Troy, complete with the wooden horse and the escape of Aeneas, is given in close detail, but explained and rationalized. Into this account, based on the poetic tradition, he introduced details gathered from local reports, such for instance as the curious remark that the name ' Italy' came from the Latin word 'vitulus', bull; it was a cattle country into which Heracles went in pursuit of the herds of Geryon. He seems to have carried on his record to events in his own lifetime, to have used Herodotus as a source, and even to have mentioned the Battle of Arginusae. Thucydides says he was not satisfactory about the Pentecontaetia between the Persian and Peloponnesian wars. But his great achievement was to record the great mass of early traditions, and reduce them to some sort of con- sistent order by forcing them into a chronological system. In some part of his work he made what was perhaps a new chronological device: he established an era for dating. The Priestesses of Hera at Argos went a long way back, and apparently their years of office were recorded. Hellanicus tells us, for example, that the Sicani were first driven out of Italy in the twenty-sixth year of the Priestess Alcyone. For the most part, however, he worked out his dates by an elaborate scheme of generations. Codrus, for example, was furnished with a detailed genealogy up to Deucalion. Hesiod was in the tenth generation from Orpheus. The trial of Orestes before the Areopagus took place nine genera- tions after that of Ares for the slaying of Halirrhothius, and six after that of Cephalus for killing his wife-the only Greek hero who committed, and that by accident, that fashionable modern crime. The trial of Daedalus for killing the giant Tal6s was three generations after Cephalus and three before Orestes. As for the taking of Troy, he was quite precise. He found it had occurred in the eighteenth year of Agamemnon's reign on the twelfth of the month Thargelion. He is conscientious in accepting the results of his calculations. Theseus, it appears, was just fifty years of age when he</page><page sequence="3">'A BOOK TO KEEP' 51 carried off Helen, who was only seven; but we may well believe that he only took her into safe keeping to protect the precocious princess from less scrupulous suitors. Hellanicus did indeed reduce a mixed multitude of things to an ordered Cosmos. One cannot be surprised that he formed the most convenient and most frequently used authority on early history for mythographers like Apollodorus and commentators on the poets; nor yet that sober historians like Strabo and Josephus speak of him as utterly untrustworthy and indeed ' worse than Homer and Hesiod '. There has been much discussion about his various books. The article in Suidas says he 'wrote very many works both in prose and poetry '. But we do not really know what a book was in Hellanicus' day, particularly a prose book. It always needs an imaginative effort for us modern scholars to free our minds from the misleading conception of the modern printed book, published in a number of identical copies with the author's name attached and intended for private reading. I doubt if any such idea was even conceived much before the time of Aristotle, and in any but a limited intellectual circle even then. About poetry the problem is clearer, provided we cling to one central guiding fact. Poetry was meant for recitation or performance. It was an rTwiiEgis, an exhibition or show; it aimed, Aristotle tells us, -rp6 d&amp;vdyvcoavi -ro-rro yap T6 Epyov acO-ris, at being read aloud or declaimed. That is what it is for. A bard might carry his material about with him in his handbook or his memory, as Xenophanes did, and vary the performance according to the tastes of his audience; but the poem performed on a definite public occasion had of necessity to be a finished unity, with a known author and a fixed text. An Epinikion of Pindar was a special poem with a fixed text, learned and per- formed by a chorus for a particular victory by a particular man, and that was that. A drama of Aeschylus, similarly learned and performed by a Chorus at the annual Dionysia, was a definite unity, with a fixed text-unless, of course, it was performed again and might be altered. It was, as Wilamowitz says, the first book, and even a book with a name, though for some time apparently the name was not quite a title, only a description of the Chorus or the chief character. They spoke of Aeschylus' Suppliant Women, or his 'Op?c-reTa rroiTalS, of Aristophanes' Knights, Birds, or Lysistrata. There is never a name like Midsummer Night's Dream or As You Like It. The greatest' occasion' of all, at least for Athens and the Ionian cities was, of course, the quad- rennial rravi'jyupvp of the Panathenaea; and for that, as we know, two special poems, made of old traditional material but formed into magnificent artistic unities, with a suitable heroic and pan-Hellenic atmosphere, grew to a generally recognised position of absolute pre-eminence and to something approaching a fixed text. True the great 'lIslTroirlal, ' poetry about Ilion', and the '06aaEla rroincrls, ' poetry about Odysseus', never obtained the same textual unity as an epinikion of Pindar. The Pindaric ode was performed once for all. It was not repeated at successive festivals. The Ilian and Odysseian poetry was performed again and again at the recurring Panathenaea. The recitation was competitive, and we do not know how far an individual rhapsode might improve his text. But the poems were widely learnt by heart and recited for educational purposes and copied out for private use by individual literary men. The process led ultimately towards the fixing of an established text, but certainly offered constant opportunities for variety, as is proved by the ancient quotations, especially those in Aeschines and Aristotle, and confirmed by the early papyri. Still the two great poems stood out from the rest in their respective artistic unities. They were accepted as more definitely the true work of the great Homer than all the rest of the tradition. What, then, remained out of the mass of traditional raw material out of which the Iliad and Odyssey had been hewn, and on which collectors like Hecataeus and Hellanicus had based the greater part of their histories ? Most of it was presumably in epic verse, and easily capable of being recited in the form of lays-of which more later: much of it probably stored in the form of memoranda or catalogues; all of it in a very fluid state. Collections were made which assumed the existence and common knowledge of the Iliad and the Odyssey, filled up the gaps before and after, and completed a sort of Cosmos or epic narrative. These so-called cyclic epics, though attributed to definite authors, do not seem to have had much unity in themselves. Their names, we should remember, are all collective: Tr&amp; Krrrpla Trrn, 'The Aphrodite verses', iy plKP&amp; 'Rll1 iroirn1, 'The lesser Trojan poetry', and the like. The Kirrrplca Trrr, or Verses about Cypris, for instance, though centring on the Judgement of Paris and the action of Aphro- dite, contain a great deal of other matter-enough, Aristotle says, for a great number of tragedies. It included, for instance, digressions as far apart as the legends of Oedipus, the madness of Heracles, and the story of Theseus and Ariadne. Obviously ' post-Homeric ' as they are, they are interesting as showing remnants of an older, ruder tradition. Like Attic tragedy they preserve some of the crudities and horrors which were expurgated from the Iliad when it was worked up into a mirror of chivalry and a central instrument of liberal education. Besides this epic material, there must have been a quantity of current oral poetry, used for singing or reciting at banquets or else as an ordinary element of a full man's culture. Every educated man was trained in poetry, and although women, as we are told in the Medea, were not themselves poets, the myths and legends were certainly repeated or sung to them while at work at their spinning. Creusa's attendants in the Ion when examining the friezes at Delphi recognise with excitement the</page><page sequence="4">52 GILBERT MURRAY various heroes whose legends they have heard at their looms. We can perhaps trace three stages in the reduction of the Chaos of traditional oral poetry into Cosmos. There are first what I may call the stores of raw material, the Logoi or legends, mostly in verse, the catalogues, the genealogies, the epic formulae like the descriptions of shields, forms of address to gods; maxims for agriculture or seafaring or general education. These are not meant for performance, or public epideixeis, as they stand. They are only raw material for an epideixis. Then the opposite of these, real epideixeis, poems produced in full dress for a special occasion, like the Iliad and Odyssey and, still more definitely, the Pindaric Odes and the Attic dramas. Thirdly, a sort of middle stage in which the raw material is somehow stuck together, artistically or inartistically, so as to make either a proper epideixis or a least a book with some pretence of unity. Good examples are in the collection of Homeric hymns or prooimia. Most of them (VIII-XXXII) are just what they say; preludes or proper forms of address for opening a hymn to a god or goddess. They would seem to us hardly worth recording, but we must remember that mistakes in such a matter were dangerous. The god must have his right epithet. But Hymns II-VI show a real OpvoS or lay, added to the opening and closing formulae, and in some cases worked into real unity and beauty of form; Hymn III, again, shows obviously an attempt to combine two separate lays into a unity; Hymn VII, to Dionysus, is a pure lay without any opening or closing formulae. But the most instructive and unmistakable example of the process of manufacture which produces from the collected raw material a proper lay, suitable for Epideixis, is the Hesiodic Aspis, or Shield of Heracles. It starts undisguisedly by an extract from the Eoiai, or Catalogue of Women, beginning with the words Ij o rl, 'or like . . .', 'Or like Alcmena, when she left her home and land to follow her husband-Alcmena, who surpassed the whole race of women in form and stature, while in intellect no one competed with her.' So on for fifty-six lines till we hear that she gave birth to Iphicles and Herakles. Then we start 'who also killed Kyknos, son of Ares '. Then from 57 to I22-less than sixty lines-we hear how Herakles and his nephew Iolaus saw Kyknos and Ares blocking the pilgrims' way to Delphi, and Iolaus told Herakles to arm. Then in twelve lines we are told how he puts on greaves, thorax, spear and helmet, also club, bow and poisoned arrows-a very mixed and rather embarrassing accoutrement; then from 138 to 313 we find nearly 200oo lines occupied with a description, obviously traditional and, so to speak, taken ready-made from store, of a great heroic Shield, like those made by Hephaestus for Achilles in the Iliad (18. 478-617) and for Memnon in the Aethiopis. Descriptions of shields were like Prooimia, part of the bard's stock-in- trade. It is worth noting that in one of the Homeric papyri (-rr51) several lines here describing Herakles' shield are attributed to that of Achilles. An echo of the tradition can be noted in the shields of the Seven against Thebes and that of Achilles in Euripides' Electra. Then comes the battle with Kyknos, with what looks like an insertion from some other store about the wounding of Ares by a hero under Athena's guidance-here by Herakles, as by Diomedes in Iliad V and by Odysseus in the Telegonia. A competent but not inspired bard had just stuck together ready-made pieces of his traditional store by the help of a few lines of his own in the proper style and the correct Homeric metre. The necessary Cosmos is achieved. The poem is ready for performance. Far more puzzling and interesting is the effort after Cosmos in Hesiod's Theogony. There clearly is such an effort, some attempt at a selection out of an immense store. The imperfections of the Theogony itself imply the selection; the immense store is implied by the great number of works attributed to Hesiod, and the quotations by ancient authors, using phrases like 'Hesiod or one of those who have inserted verses into Hesiod ', or ' the author of such-and-such ', or more vaguely still -r6 oPEIveEUvIiVOV (cf. Hes. fr. 87, 158, 163, 17I, 174, 177, I88). The Theogony itself professes to be the work, in Professor Cornford's language, of a prophet or shaman like that inspired chief in the Gilbert Islands, rather than a mere poet or ovyypapE~es. It comes from inspiration. Hence it starts with a long appeal to the Muses, or probably a combination of at least two such appeals; this includes a brief but orthodox list of the Olympian gods (I 1-2 I, omitting such unpleasant persons as Ares). Then, having paid this tribute to the Olympians, we start upon the real origin of the world from Chaos; first came Earth and Tartarus, and Er6s; Earth out of herself produced the Sky, and we proceed with the progeny of Ouranos and Gaia. This leads to the sequence of Eniautos gods; an old Sky King who, wedded to Earth, produces a Young Sky King, who in co-operation with his mother Earth kills or removes the Old King and takes his place, till he in turn becomes an old King and is duly destroyed by his son with the same accomplice. The new Kings come and go with the years, but Earth the eternal wife and mother remains The actual Ouranos-Kronos story occurs in 155-200, the Kronos-Zeus story in 454-506. It ought, of course, to continue with the overthrow of the Old Zeus by a Young Zeus, as it does in the Orphica, and so on for ever; but that, in the Olympian tradition, cannot be thought of. On the contrary, we have for some five hundred lines, from about 510o to the end of the poem at I018, the stories of all the sinister or unwise beings who strove against Zeus and were defeated, including a short insertion about the defeat of the over-clever Prometheus. Then comes the War of the Titans; the episode of the three powers of Darkness, Kottos, Gyes, and Briareus, who had been released and forgiven by Zeus and thus became his policemen; then finally the Chthonian monster Typhoeus. It is all a prolonged battle between Zeus and his dark Enemies, and the ultimate victory of Zeus. It is a strange mixture; many lists,</page><page sequence="5">'A BOOK TO KEEP' 53 muses, nymphs, rivers, etc., consorts of Zeus, etc., all of them imperfect; an attempted combination of the very personal anthropomorphic Olympians, and impersonal beings such as Earth, Sky, Darkness, Erebos, etc. What unity of theme can we find? Following a study of Cornford's and some suggestions in Professor Gaster's great collection of Semitic Nature rituals, I am inclined to see in the Theogony not exactly an independent poem, but a p00ioS in its special religious sense of -r \EY6PIEVa iTwi TOiS 8pC~pvoIS. It seems to be the accompaniment or explanation of a great ritual pageant combining two distinct but well-known rituals: the regular eniautos series of Old Kings dethroned each year by Young Kings, and secondly, the battle of Darkness against Light, which we know from the Mummers Play. It is, after all, an epideixis, a performance at a festival, and thus has a right to be a book, a real coycp caOvipcovov, or consistent unity, made out of a selection from a mass of inconsistent local lore. Apart from these public rituals, educated people evidently knew a great lot of current poetry by heart. Niceratus, in Xenophon's Symposium, mentions that he can still repeat the whole of the Iliad and Odyssey, which his father had made him learn 6T'rcs d&amp;yacObs &amp; vilp yivo0-ro. He is reminded, however, that all the professional rhapsodes can do that, and where can you find an A2uOtcT-rEpov ievos, ' a sillier tribe'. This criticism perhaps led to the collection of select passages. One might collect out of the poets the parts that were really calculated to make you good, such as the educational parts of Hesiod, and the moral precepts of Solon, Tyrtaeus, and Theognis. Hence arose educational handbooks, containing as much as the compiler could collect of the suitable elegiac material. Evidently it was often anonymous or its author was forgotten. Hence particular poets, in order to preserve their rights, imposed what they called a 'seal' or aupayis on their compositions. It might be a definite statement Kca Ti68E C00KUiJMSECO, or more artistically the advice or exhortation might be addressed to some special person. If to Kyrnos, you knew the author was Theognis, just as advice to ' the foolish Perses ' was the work of Hesiod. This might protect the authorship of a particular couplet, but was no protection against interpolation. Another proof of the same uncertainty of authorship, or one might say the widespread indifference to that question, is afforded by the con- siderable number of passages in our Theognis collection which are elsewhere attributed to other elegiac poets. I suspect that the chief popular test of authorship was style; indeed, no objective evidence can have been easily available. When in doubt, love poems were presumably by Mimner- mus, warlike poems by Tyrtaeus; political wisdom belonged to Solon, fierce oligarchic 'virtue' to Theognis, and floating verses of uncertain origin were apt to be distributed accordingly. The collection that comes to us under the name of Theognis is in many ways instructive. We can see, roughly speaking, about what time it was made. Isocrates (Nicocles 43) says that people regard Hesiod, Theognis, and Phocylides as apta-rol acppouAho T-r Pic3, but do not attend to them. 'And if somebody were to make a collection of the so-called Gnomae of the most eminent poets it would be just the same.' Evidently the idea was in the air but still new. Again, Plato in the Laws (8 oe) criticises what he regards as the common view that the best education is for boys 'to be constantly hearing and learning' the famous poets till they are ' saturated '; whereas many educa- tionalists make extracts and headings and whole speeches into a collection (EIS TairJOr cwvcayay6v-rES) and set them to be learnt by heart. He himself thinks it would be much better if they learnt by heart good prose philosophy like 'the discussion we are now having '. Our Theognis is evidently just such a collection, based on Theognis and made by someone who shared that poet's strong opinions on democracy, but embracing a good many gnomae of an equally elevating character without much care about their authorship. It is very interesting to note, as Mr. Barns points out in the Classical Quarterly for 1951, I, that another type of anthology was also made, consisting not of harmonious gnomae but of contradictory gnomae; the student was to consider both Logoi, and presumably judge between them. This is quite in the spirit of the early sophists; they may well have noted a few such contradictory gnomae, but any large anthology of them must, I presume, be much later in date. Our Theognis collection was evidently a great success, and seems to have driven the rest of Theognis' poetry out of existence. Hardly anything is quoted from him by later compilers which does not come from this little book. In poetry, then, one can see how a Cosmos, a work in permanent artistic shape, with a definite fixed text, arises out of a mass of VrIOVEwu6dEEVc or IuOEuJ6EEVc . I leave aside for the moment the special songs, like those of the Lesbian and Boeotian schools, the skolia and the songs ofAnacreon. But is there a similar process in prose ? Of course there are lists and catalogues and memoranda, magical charms, contracts, Laws, and Treaties. They are preserved for their obvious utility. Also important speeches, both public and private, political and personal alike, tend to be preserved. Some are useful to the possessor; all are careful works of art recited in public on a specific occasion, in the same way as Pindar's Odes. But what about the 'loropirl or Enquiry of Herodotus, made into a book and called his 'Nine Muses'? They are clearly meant for recitation. Thucydides says so (I. 22. 4)- The ancients generally assume it as a matter of course. Traditions speak casually of recitations at Thebes, Athens, Corinth, and what is more important, Olympia. He himself sometimes pauses to correct the scepticism with which certain of his statements had been received by previous audiences. He often refers to particular Logoi, and sometimes to Logoi that do not now exist. Sometimes he promises Logoi which he does not give. The book may not be quite finished; nevertheless, he has</page><page sequence="6">54 GILBERT MURRAY out of most various materials made ?v crjiO'a c'rv' cvov, ' one harmonious body,' just as Homer did. The whole was too long for ordinary performance; so were the Iliad and Odyssey. But, like them, it was not too long for some very great occasion; not too long for the quadrennial Panhellenic Pane- gyris at Olympia, as the Iliad was not too long for the Panionian Panegyris at the Panathenaea. Perhaps, like them, very suitable to be learned by heart, in long passages, such as -r M6rl)1K&amp;. A public which does not read is capable of wonderful feats of listening and of memory. And, as Longinus and other ancient critics remarked, Herodotus was recognised as 'OlplKT'C)cTO Kal fIavi-yvpKcb-ra-roS, most Homeric and most suited for a Panegyris. The two adjectives, I think, are almost identical in meaning. The Homeric poems, clearly a great artistic unity, clearly composed for recitation yet far too long for an ordinary occasion, demand a great Panegyris. So does Hero- dotus, and he has the more impressive claim to it because he has not only made his great mass of material into a ' single concordant body', he has also made his w3rIv qpdIv 6porv TrIl I KpI-ro-rrl rwonl cE ' his prose language like the noblest poetry' (Dionysius vi. 865). He thus won for his book not only the title of The Nine Muses, but a place in permanent literature like that hitherto reserved for great poetry. The one author who in Longinus' opinion deserves equally or even more the title of 'Oirlp'Kra-roS is Plato. The ten Logoi of the Republic form a acrp aaiiqpcovov, just as Herodotus' Nine Muses do; his prose undoubtedly is ' like the noblest poetry', and when we keep well in mind that recitation or reading aloud, a&amp;vayvcAls or eTri8E~ts, and not private reading, was the normal object of literature in antiquity, we cease to be surprised that Aristophanes in the Ecclesiazusae should have quoted and parodied in detail doctrines and phrases of the Fifth book of the Republic some twenty years before the Republic as a whole can have been what we call published. Evidently the part which we now call Book V, in some form similar to that in which we have it, had been read aloud, had received an FwiT or3v or &amp;vdyvcoats to a select audience, a long time and doubtless many times, before the whole work as a' single harmonious body ' was ready for the public. No doubt a good deal of it was learnt by heart. Probably the Athenian speaker in the Laws was quite serious when he recommended that the young should be encouraged, as a matter of education, instead of mere poetry, to learn by heart a good stretch of his own somewhat prolix wisdom. Herodotus evidently made an epoch in Greek literature. Traditionally there were two kinds of composition which were recognised as works of art and worthy of preservation with a fixed text; poems such as dramas and odes and epics composed for some special epideixis, and prose speeches composed with high rhetorical art and delivered on some particular occasion. Other books were roughly speaking handbooks for information or professional use. Of course, historians and Aoyoroloi read aloud extracts from their works as they moved about. They collected facts, but were hardly artists. Dionysius (p. I8I) mentions twelve predecessors of Herodotus who all wrote in the same way, copying down their sources, and sometimes criticising them, but with no style, no Eiv6Trrls. Herodotus was quite different. He composed something that reminded people of the Iliad and was suited for a great Panegyris, something 'OpI1plK6V Kai V1av)yvp&lt;K6v. He made his prose speech '6opoijav rTll KpaT-ricrrTl Trrolaa' prose, but somehow like the noblest poetry. The book was not quite finished, but it stood there as a great harmonious whole. But what of Thucydides ? He did not seem to fall into any recognised category. No one could call him wrav-nyupIK6v. He was not at all suitable for recitation to a vast audience, only for a selected group of intellectuals. Yet he was full of GrwoerGES -rravrlyuplKtai, ' subjects suitable for large public treatment '. Dionysius seems rather puzzled, not to say peevish, about him. He respects him as a historian, as indeed the greatest of historians; he has rejected the mythical stuff of the earlier historians, rejected their untruthfulness and humbug (yorlETnia). He has seen that History is 'the priestess of Truth '. Yet even as a historian he has faults: his system of chronology by summers and winters of the war leads to terrible confusion, his speeches are not only interruptions to the narrative but are also tiresome (6Xbrl-pai) to listen to (pp. 847, 91o). His style too is full of archaisms, strange words, foreign turns of speech, and even solecisms. He is sometimes so moving, sometimes so cold and indifferent (845). He is d~aqail, constantly obscure, unintelligible, 'more twisted than any labyrinth ' (913). The fact is he writes like a poet, parts of him are TwoirTITKd, parts are actually full of OEarplK&amp; aXipla-ra (869), parts even more like G8tupap~PKl (887). This is just what his fanatical admirers are most enthusiastic about, his grandeur and emotional power. A critic in Marcellinus' Life roundly condemns Thucydides for writing stuff that is neither verse nor yet good prose. It has no prl-roplK&lt;. Marcellinus answers that of course it is prose, not verse, but it is marked out 'by poetical expressions and metaphors' (orolTIrTKaig 2?8ECI KatI -ETaqOpaiS), that, as for rlroplKil, it is not a necessary quality in good prose; Plato does not use it, nor yet do handbooks of medicine. What these critics blame in Thucydides is really a sign of his extraordinary genius-his power and his high artistic ambition, 8ivcarpl Kai WTSEovE(ia. He is like Homer, too, in his oiKOvoplia, that is, in the way in which he works a great and varied subject into a unity. It is interesting to note that the ancient critics were almost as conscious as the moderns of the problems affecting the composition of the great book. They see that it cannot have been written at one go. He began, says Marcellinus, by making a very careful collection of facts, using his great wealth to pay groups on both sides to keep him informed-like the foreign correspondents of a</page><page sequence="7">'A BOOK TO KEEP' 55 modern newspaper. Then, when in exile, he worked up the collection into an artistic whole. Then came the second war. A new conception was necessary. The introduction especially must have been written after all the rest. Some, we are told, divided his work into thirteen books; some into eight. In any case the last book was unfinished and left without speeches, not, as Dionysius thought, because he saw what a mistake the speeches were, but simply because he died before rlv TrpoOEcpiav, 'the appointed day'. A curious phrase, taken apparently from the language of the theatre and meaning the day of the performance. Was there to have been some great 'rfTi E1S? Difficult prose writing, divided by some into eight books and by others into thirteen, and not finished; only intelligible to a small and scholarly audience; it was yet, by some art of genius, iv aWGopa i'rPcovov, and in some strange way 'OCprlpKbV and wravlyupIK6v. It produced not mere wEtiec like a prose speech, but like a great poem, iKTr rlSts: how shall we translate that word ? L. and S. say 'con- sternation ', which will not quite do here. Rhys Roberts says ' transport '. It leaves you ' amazed ' or ' astounded '. Literally it ' knocks you out '. The greatest poetry need not particularly produce TrEtecb or wrratSEia, persuasion, or instruction. It just produces EK1rAritS, ' it knocks you out ', or as Dionysius sometimes puts it, KrT&amp;r'rirlS1 ' it knocks you down '. "eKTrrTT15 was considered a special characteristic of Aeschylus. Genius cannot be analysed. It does not think much of mere cropia or TEXvrY or logic. It is not the same as Cosmos. Yet it was by means of Cosmos and in the search for Cosmos that it ultimately asserted its rights. The reciter must be ready for the occasion, for rTlv wrpoOEaopfiv, the First Night. The thing produced must be a consistent whole, a unity; and for a very great occasion, a great whole. If it is prose it may be a speech which needs TrElech, power of persuasion; if not, it is chiefly a vehicle of useful information, but it always needs some sort of Cosmos or arrangement. It is interesting to note that Thucydides based his claim to have composed not a mere ~TriEtitc for recitation, but a KTrFJpa~C &amp;Ei, ' a thing to keep permanently', on its usefulness as a book of reference in case the same sort of thing as the Peloponnesian War should happen again. Did he suspect that he had made a KTipa E5 &amp;Ei in a much greater sense ? He created ' an eternal possession ' for the human race because, in addition to its Cosmos and its truth to fact, it had genius and produced iKTr?l?iS, if not for ever at least for two thousand years, for instance in historians like Macaulay. Herodotus, Thucydides, Plato, these three more than any others seem to have produced the conception of a serious prose work which should, in addition to the accepted rules of Cosmos and Sophia, reach also by its own methods a power of inspiration or emotional effect akin to that of poetry. After Thucydides we are well into an age which likes to analyse its art and seeks its effects by self- conscious T-rXvnr and aoqpia. The next important step which it took was the style of Isocrates. He could see what Thucydides' faults were: we have just been through them-the strange words, the contorted sentences, the bewildering brevity; Isocrates would be normal and correct in language, use well-constructed periods, and insist on perfect lucidity, crxlqvEica. He would study TrEc1OC and convince his audience. All these things he does. Furthermore, since the greatness of Thucydides and Herodotus was said to be due to their poetic qualities, he would have qualities still more poetical; cola and periods exactly balanced as in a lyric poem; plenty of echoes and paronomasiai and pari- soseis, and lastly, like real poetry, he would make his prose avoid hiatus between vowels. Then he would write a tremendous Panegyricus, like Herodotus, and a Panathenaicus, like Homer. What more could possibly be desired? Only the genius was lacking. There is not much EKTrk S1 in him or any of his followers. GILBERT MURRAY</page></plain_text>
