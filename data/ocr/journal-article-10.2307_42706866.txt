<plain_text><page sequence="1">279 RECENSIONES Varia Peter Kuhn, Gottes Trauer und Klage in der rabbinischen Überlie- ferung ( Talmud und Midrasch) (AGJU XIII). xm + 559 pp. Leiden 1978. E. J. Brill. This work, which offers a German translation of 75 passages of Rabbinic literature, dealing with God's mourning and lamentation, as well as introductory and explanatory notes and comprehensive treat- ments of individual topics, is a masterpiece. The author deserves our gratitude for his faithful translations from the Hebrew and Aramaic sovirces. The task of translation is not facilitated by the fact that as yet we lack adequate scientific editions of some basic Rabbinic texts; and Kuhn has overcome this difficulty with great skill, indicating in his notes why, in any given case, lie has preferred one variant reading over another. If, then, Kuhn had done nothing more than make these texts available to the student of Judaism in Late Antiquity who cannot deal with Rab- binic texts in their original languages, he would already have made a significant contribution. But Kuhn has done more, much more. We still lack a concordance to the literature of the Tannai tic and Amor aie Midrashim. Nor is there one to the Palestinian Talmud. As for the concordances to the Babylonian Talmud, they are word-concordances, and not, in any real sense, and the title of Lazarus Goldschmidťs posthumous work notwithstanding, subject- concordances. Kuhn knows enough of Rabbinic literature to realize that, in dealing with a given topic in Rabbinic thought, one must look for more than the occurrence of certain specific words. Consequently, he himself systematically worked through the Palestinian and the Baby- lonian Talinudim and the Tannaitic and iVmoraic Midrashim, in order to find the passages which are germane to his topic. To a certain extent, therefore, this book might also be regarded as a subject-concordance to (part of) Rabbinic literature on the topic of God's mourning and lamen- tation. This, too, must be regarded as a significant contribution. By working through the Rabbinic materials, Kuhn has found that there are 231 passages in the sources examined by him which deal with such topics as God's lamenting man's or Israel's sins, His own sorrow at the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple and Israel's Kxile, His</page><page sequence="2">280 Recensiones actually performing (Jewish) mourning rites, His feeling the pain of His peo- ple, etc., etc.; yet, in view of the fact that the same text can occur in more than one passage, Kuhn shows that, in reality, there are only 75 texts, i.e., those texts which he has translated and annotated in this volume. He then calculates the frequency with which one and tlie same text appears in the literature examined (pp. 394 ff.). This in itself is useful information, whether or not one totally agrees with Kuhn' s inference, drawn from it, that "diese Zahlen zeigen, dass die Texte und die in ihnen enthaltene Glaubensanschauung von Gottes Trauer und Klage innerhalb der gesamten rabbin. Überlieferung zwar keine beherrschende Stellung einnehmen, dass ihnen jedoch eine grössere Verbreitung und höhere Bedeutung zukommt, als es der rabbinist. Forschung bisher wohl zum Bewusstsein kam" (p. 396). While the first part of this book is of an introductory nature, and the second part contains the translation of texts and Kuhn' s annotations, it is in the third part that the author states his own conclusions, based upon the assembled materials. This is admirable scholarly procedure, and helps to make the work credible. The various indices, too, are both thorough and useful. Whether the author's quite specific conclusions can be main- tained will depend upon the answers one gives to certain methodological questions to which we shall now address ourselves. Kuhn anticipates practically all of the criticisms which can be levelled against his work, and, therefore, he seems to disarm them ab initio . Thus he is emphatic in his "Abgrenzung der Quellen" (pp. 15 ff.), stating that he is confining himself to the standard Tannaitic and Amo- raic Midrashim and to the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmudim. He knows that there is other pertinent literature as well, and he mentions some of it. Indeed, this book of 559 pages would have turned into a veritable library had the author, in addition to the literature which he has examined, also dealt with the Targumim, the Apocalyptic and Mes- sianic Midrashim, the Hellenistic- Je wish literature, the medieval com- mentators, and the synagogue liturgy and poetry. (Yet it is tobe regretted that, while Kuhn occasionally quotes Hebrew and Yiddish writers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries who may carry forward a theme adumbrated in Rabbinic literature, he pays no attention to an early synagogal poet like Ble 'azar Kallir, who did have something to say on the subject dealt with by Kuhn, and who was a near contemporary of most of the literature from which Kuhn takes his texts.) Kuhn's "Ab- grenzung" can, as we indicated, be justified. What might be questioned in the light of this "Abgrenzung" is the absolute validity of Kuhn's conclusions in the third part of the book, seeing that they are based on less than the totality of all possibly relevant texts. (Incorporation of an idea into the liturgy, for example, would tell us more about its accep- tance by the faith-community than the number of times it is mentioned in Talmud and Midrash.) The worth whileness of Kuhn's work is beyond doubt. So is the pioneering role he has undertaken in opening up to scholarly investi-</page><page sequence="3">Recensiones 281 gation this particular area of Rabbinic thought. His brief survey of such little work in this field as had been done by scholars before him (pp. 3-11) is both enlightening and, on the whole, fair. Not altogether without bias, however, is the suggestion on page 3: "Der Hauptgrund für die langdauernde Vernachlässigung der rabbin. Texte, die von Gottes Leiden, Trauer und Klage sprechen, ist vielleicht darin zu finden, dass die moderne 'Wissenschaft des Judentums' weitgehend vom liberalen Judentum be- gründet und betrieben wurde". No doubt Liberal Judaism did not exactly cherish Rabbinic anthro- pomorphism in general, and the Rabbinic God's mourning for Zion in particular. But this unease was not confined to the Liberal Jewish practi- tioners of "Wissenschaft des Judentums". When Abraham J. Hescliel, in 1962, published his book The Prophets in which he "dared" to write about the pathos of the Prophetic God, he was bitterly attacked by ail outstanding representative of Traditional Judaism, Eliezer Berkovits (Cf. E. Berkovits, Major Themes in Modern Philosophies of Judaism, New York 1974, pp. 192-224). It is not the monopoly of Liberal Judaism to shun anthropomorphic and anthropopathic descriptions of the Deity. This goes back at least to Moses Maimonides in the twelfth century; and the real division on this issue is not between Traditional Judaism and Liberal Judaism, but between pre-Maimonidean and post-Maimonidean Judaism, with the mystical tradition going its owrn way in this respect. Nor have Liberal Jewish scholars been unable to appreciate - historically, if not always existentially - the phenomenon of anthropomorphic and anthropopathic theologoumena. Witness Kaufmann Kohler, the oustanding theologian of Reform Judaism in its "classical" or radical period: "On the other hand, we must bear in mind that we naturally ascribe to God a human personality, whether we speak of Him as the Master-worker of the uni- verse, as the all-seeing and all-hearing Judge, or the compassionate and merciful Father. We cannot help attributing human qualities and emo- tions to Him the moment we invest Him with a moral and spiritual nature" (K. Kohler, Jewish Theology , New York 1918, p. 76). And again: "We accept, then, the fact that man, child-like, invests God with human qualities - a view advanced by Abraham ben David of Posquières in opposition to Maimonides" (Kohler, op. cit., pp. 80 ff.). Nor should we overlook the fact that one of the most perceptive studies about the "suffering God" of Rabbinic Judaism was written by the Liberal Jewish scholar, Henry Slonimsky, who for many years was Dean of the Jewish Institute of Religion in New York (Cf. H. Slonimsky, "The Philosophy Implicit in the Midrash", HUCA 27 [1956] 235-290). Cu- riously enough, Slonimsky' s essay does not appear among the secondary literature which Kuhn consulted in writing this work. All of this does not alter the fact, noted by Kuhn, that there has been very little work done by representatives of the "Wissenschaft des Judentums" about God's mourning and lamentation. It is only that the basic reason for this state of affairs may differ from that suggested by Kuhn. We have noted the caesura created by the influence Biblica 61 (1980) 18</page><page sequence="4">282 Recensiones of Maimonidean thought in the realm of Jewish attitudes towards an- thropomorphism and anthropopathy. But an even more fundamental consideration might be adduced which gets us right to the heart of the main problem raised by Kuhn' s book. We have already hinted at our reservations about the conclusions which Kuhn feels entitled to draw from the numerical frequency of the occurrence of Rabbinic texts dealing with God's mourning and lamen- tation, and his insistence "dass ihnen jedoch eine grössere Verbreitung und höhere Bedeutung zukommt, als es der rabbinist. Forschung bisher wohl zum Bewusstsein kam". How does one measure "höhere Bedeutung" within Rabbinic literature? Is the statistical yardstick of frequency of citation really adequate? How, in the realm of aggadic utterances, does one discover what was a position with which the majority associated itself, and what was merely the idiosyncratic expression of an individual ? We know that the Rabbis never, or almost never, took a vote on aggadic matters - unlike their procedures in halakhic decisions. Sometimes a halakhic repercussion of an aggadic teaching can help us determine that teaching's relative significance in the Rabbinic scheme of things. But statements about God's mourning and lamentation (some of them, indeed, attributing to God the observance of Je wish mourn- ing rites!) had little or ]|p influence on halakhic practice. Even the invo- cation of Rabbi Eli'ezer's statement, in b. Berakhoth 3a (pp. 254-257), that God "roars" three times a night, in order to prove that the night consists of three "watches", which figures in the Talmud's attempt to determine the time-limit of the Evening Shema , is really nothing more than an embellishment, seeing that the discussion itself was due much more to the conflicting memories of the three Greek phylakai and the four Roman vigiliae than to Rabbi Eli'ezer's exegesis of Jer 25,30. The evaluation of a "higher" or "lower" significance (and significance to whom and in relation to what?) of aggadic statements is still very much a matter of the subjective judgment of the e valuator rather than an exact scientific discipline. And the valuator, by his very formulation of the questions with which he approaches his materials, often parades his own scale of values when lie speaks in terms of "higher" or "lower" significance. Perhaps, once the study of Rabbinic thought has been developed as an exact scientific discipline, "frequency of occurrence" will be one of the indicators of "significance". But it is unlikely to be the only indicator. One thing, however, is certain. Individual statements about God's mourning and lamentation in Rabbinic literature do not constitute anything like a "Lehrbegriff der Synagoge" - in any way comparable to the Passion of Christ which does constitute a "Lehrbegriff der Kirche", or like the doctrines of Revelation and Resurrection which come very close to being "dogmas" of Pharisaic-Rabbinic Judaism. Kuhn himself points out (pp. 15 f.): "Die rabbin. Haggada soil ... grundsätzlich als von der abendländischen Form des systematisierenden und abstrahie- renden Denkens und Sprechens von Gott, die allein man mit Recht Theologie nennt, verschieden gekennzeichnet werden". One could, by</page><page sequence="5">Recensiones 283 the way, argue with the Occidental monopoly which Kuhn claims for theology. But that would be beside the point here. What does matter is Kuhn's own recognition, clearly stated, of the difference between Haggadah and Western-style theologizing. Similarly, he admits, on page 26: "Der Gefahr einer zu starken Systematisierung. . . versuchen wir zu entgehen, ohne sie immer völlig vermeiden zu können..." (our italics). And again, on page 12, Kuhn recognizes that "... eine gewisse 'Randunscliärfe' bleibt aber trotz allem bestehen, und zwTar aufgrund des Charakters der rabbin. Haggada, der es ja nicht um begriffliche Klärungen, sondern um Anschaulichkeit zu tun ist, deren Texte sich manchmal schwer hinterfragen lassen. Admissions of this kind lead us to our assertion that Kuhn has already anticipated and disarmed the major criticisms which can be levelled against his conclusions. For those conclusions, about such things as "Die Gestalt von Gottes Trauer und Klage", "Trauer Israel als Nachahmung der Trauer Gottes in der Geschichte der jüdischen Religion", "Der Reali- tätsgehalt von Gottes Trauer und Klage in den untersuchten Texten", etc., tend to assume a systematizing and theologizing form which, accord- ing to Kuhn's own admission, is quite foreign to the material itself and, we may add, to the contexts in which it appears. It is not that, in his textual analysis, Ku|n is guilty of mistakes of fact or interpretation. He is not. Rather is it in his synthesizing that the end-product is made to look somewhat alien to a student who has encountered the texts in situ. In this connection, it may not be inap- propriate to recall a story, told by Israel Zangwill. "There is a story of a Jewish witness unable to explain to a magis- trate what a shofar was. At last, to the suggestion that it was a trumpet, he cried in glad relief, 'Yes, it is a trumpet'. 'Then why didn't you say so?' 'Because it is not a trumpet' " (I. Zangwill, The Voice of Jerusalem, New York 1921, p. 260). Yes, Peter Kuhn's Gottes Trauer und Klage in der rabbinischen Überlieferung does represent, within the limits he has set for himself, a superior translation and treatment of the relevant midrashim and aggadoth. But, in the final analysis, the very Problemstellung and the systematization of what emerges from various unconnected texts - a systematization brought to the texts by the author, and not called for by the texts themselves - leave one wondering whether this is really what the ancient Rabbis taught, given all the other things they also said and taught, and the often playful way in which they utilized Scrip- ture verses, and allowing for the different inoods and circumstances in which various utterances on the subject were made by them. This is not to fault Peter Kuhn for what he has done. In the absence, as yet, of a scientifically adequate way of "doing" Rabbinic Theology, lie has probably done the very best that can be done with the material under consideration. His book will long remain the standard work on the subject, consulted by all who want to familiarize themselves with what the ancient Rabbis had to say about God's mourning and lamenta- tion. Kuhn did not set out to supply the over-all frame of reference which</page><page sequence="6">284 Recensiones Solomon Schechter, George Foot Moore, Max Kadushin, E. E. Urbach and others have thus far failed to provide to everybody's satisfaction. If and when a more adequate method of dealing with Rabbinic thought is developed, it is to be hoped that it will learn from Kuhn's book how to meet the philological and historical requirements of textual ground- work before proceeding to further theological elaborations.
