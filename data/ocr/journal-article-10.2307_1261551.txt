<plain_text><page sequence="1">GERTRUDE STEIN AT MARIENBAD BY STROTHER B. PURDY GERTRUDE STEIN belongs to the past now, and her works are generally unread. For most people the questions her works raised are now answered, and all negatively. There can be no literature such as that she wrote and de- fended; the novel, like the opera and the play, could not, and thus has not, turned in the direc- tion she indicated. On several occasions she pointed out that her work was like the film, although she did not greatly admire the film. She simply noted that the basis of the film was a repeated image, and the basis of her fiction was repetition of words and phrases. Alain Robbe-Grillet belongs to the present, and writes, explicates, and defends a new kind of novel that enjoys the same mixture of fashion- able and puzzled admiration that Gertrude Stein's did thirty years ago. Several of his novels are written as film scripts; the first of them to be filmed was L'Annee dernitre d Marienbad, in 1961, and the result was a film of great power and great technical interest. Rather than demonstrat- ing a new emphasis or selection among conven- tional film techniques, L'Annee dernitre d Marienbad demonstrates a new principle: over- lapping repetition of words and phrases put into images, or the extension of the repeated image- a convention shared by every motion picture- into its literary and architectural aspects. Robbe-Grillet's numerous critical essays make no mention of this, perhaps because he has thought first of a new novel and only secondly of a new film. Gertrude Stein's numerous explica- tions of literary theory make repeated mention of it, but she embodied it in literature with gen- erally unhappy results. They were inevitable, for Gertrude Stein was imposing on the printed word something it could not bear-but which the visual image could. It would be unreasonable to expect that a woman trained in literature, with her intellectual formation complete by 1909 and her major work done by 1914, could have realized this, and realized at the same time the potential- ities of the film. When Marienbad appeared, the possibilities of Gertrude Stein's theories were realized. We can now see her in quite a different light, and that is what, primarily, my title is meant to suggest. Secondarily, I hope to show that Robbe-Grillet's film art is elucidated by this application of Stein theory; that we can thereby see things in Marienbad that Robbe-Grillet, Resnais, and their interpreters have not pointed out. In describing her work of 1906-14 (The Making of Americans and Tender Buttons), Gertrude Stein said, "I was doing what the cinema was doing, I was making a continuous succession of the statement of what that person was until I had not many things but one thing.... In a cinema picture no two pictures are exactly alike each one is just that much different from the one before."' In this comparison she could conclude with a paradox: "I say there was no repeti- tion"-the image is not repeated, but offered again with changes. The murderer's hand rises ever so slightly from frame to frame, revealing only after two dozen have passed that it holds a gun. But she did not think to note that the images succeed each other much faster on film than in print, and that this fact makes a decisive psy- chological difference. The frames of a motion picture pass before the eye of a machine as in- dividuals-each one comes down, stops, and then passes on-but at the speed of twenty-four each second, with the result that to the human eye they appear as one image, whether moving or not. Even if a rapid reading rate is supposed, it can- not be said that Gertrude Stein's images pass before the eye faster than one every two or three seconds. It is impossible to see them, therefore, as "not many things but one thing," since we perceive them separately, and the perception can be as boring as being shown even the most thrilling film at the rate of one frame every three seconds. Because Gertrude Stein ignored this dif- ference of speed her comparison of her work to film is a very superficial one, and it would be better if critics interested in showing her relation to modern art by her "cinema technique" ceased repeating it. Gertrude Stein's work does not 1 Lectures in America (Boston, 1957), pp. 176-77. The analogy has been taken up, along with that to Cubist paint- ing, by many critics. Frederick J. Hoffman, in his Gertrude Stein (Minneapolis, Minn., 1961), p. 21, wrote. "Narration, therefore, is a succession of these minute, subtle gradations of change; the image is substantially what it has always been, but it admits slowly accretions of variant meaning." And Michael J. Hoffman, in his The Deveopment of Abstractionism in the Writings of Gertrude Stein (Philadelphia, 1965), p. 160, writes, "We shall call this the 'cinema technique' because like the moving picture frames they resemble, each of the sentences repeats most of what has been stated in the pre- vious sentence and adds a very small additional piece of information." 1096</page><page sequence="2">Strother B. Purdy therefore resemble film as a medium, but it does, since 1961, resemble specific films, like L'Ann6e derniere a Marienbad; L'Immortelle; Trans- Europ-Express; L'Homme qui Ment. Especially Marienbad. When Getrude Stein was seventeen she went to live with several aunts, who wanted to be told of things and what was going on. It was not pos- sible to tell all these aunts the same thing at one time, so there was a great deal of repeating- repeating to the aunts one by one or in groups, and repeating to aunts by aunts: "If they had to know anything and anybody does they naturally had to say and hear it often, anybody does, and as there were ten and eleven of them they did have to say and hear said whatever was said and any one not hearing what it was they said had to come in to hear what had been said. That in- evitably made everything said often." So Ger- trude Stein realized "the inevitable repetition in human expression"2 at a time when she was read- ing novels that carefully eliminate that repeti- tion in order to preserve only what is relevant to the progression of a narrative or story. Nor were even those revolutionary writers, contemporary with Gertrude Stein and changing the form of the novel, like Joyce and Mann and Kafka and Faulkner, to change this-when they used repe- tition it was mythical or cultural, on a large scale, and cyclical in nature, like the Jungian "eternal return" that Griffiths unconsciously exploited in his Intolerance (1916) and Cocteau and Delannoy made their subject in films such as L'Eternel Retour (1943) and Orphee (1950). So when Gertrude Stein wrote The Making of Americans (1906-08), in which she explained a new novel as she composed one, she was describing a prin- ciple others had not described or used and were not to take up in her lifetime: Sometimes in listening to a conversation which is very important to two men, to two women, to two men and women, sometime then it is a wonderful thing to see how each one always is repeating every- thing they are saying and each time in repeating, what each one is saying has more meaning to each one of them.... repeating is a very wonderful thing.... Repeating is what I am loving.3 In Composition as Explanation (1926) she called this the principle of "beginning again," and strengthened its visual aspects. Each new period in art finds a new way of seeing, a new form of composition. The composition she is explaining is that of repetition, superficially that of the film image (as she wrote elsewhere, "our period was undoubtedly the period of the cinema"),4 profoundly a new way to approach the human character: "Beginning again and again is a natural thing even when there is a series ... everything is the same except composition and time.... Nothing changes from generation to generation except the thing seen and that makes a composition . . ." The Making of Americans states, and makes clear, that "There is then always repeating in all living.... Slowly every one in continuous re- peating.... comes to be clearer to some one. Every one who ever was or is will be living some- times will be clearly realised by some one."6 Here repetition is asserted to be the basis of being and of exploring being, or of art, whose purpose that is. And as being able to dominate time, in dissolving the physical separation of dif- ferent people at different times. Repetition al- lows us to recognize the lost one in the stranger, to capture the past and thus the future as well. But how does this work in practice-what form does it take in Gertrude Stein's writing? It takes the form we have just seen, for in her work com- position is explanation (passages of The Making of Americans are statements about the novel), and explanation is composition (her critical es- says and lectures are written in the "beginning again" pattern).7 "The Gradual Making of The Making of Americans" is The Making of Ameri- cans. But the following may also be offered, from A Novel of Thank You (1925-26): After this they do photograph. After this and they do photograph. And after this and they do photograph they photograph near to and at a distance. All of it which is longer and they were frightened all of it which is longer and as they were frightened, all of it and this is longer and they were frightened. They were frightened. As this is longer. As this is longer they were frightened. They were frightened as they were frightened as this is longer.8 This technique cannot be fruitfully compared, in my opinion, to conventional repetition in the other arts or other literary forms.

If a word exists in sound or writing, it represents something; otherwise it is not a word. Repetition in poetry, on the other hand, is reoccurrence of like sounds from small scale (rhyme) to large scale (refrain). Gertrude Stein has these effects, but not the con- ventions to which they belong; if we pose "they were frightened" as a refrain, there is no stanza; if we pose a rhyme we find it difficult to describe the line to which it belongs. Musical compari- sons are far wider of the mark, for music is word- less; nevertheless, they are currently fashionable in analyzing Robbe-Grillet's equivalent repeti- tions. Laurent Le Sage speaks of "orchestration" in Robbe-Grillet's novels, and Bruce Morrissette of their "analogy to musical structure"; but music is only a function of time and has never been vested with semantic convention.10 Music has no demonstrable connection with the visible world or with language, and while language as sound is also a function of time, it is powerfully connected to the visible world by a large body of agreement, or convention. Robbe-Grillet's repetition of words alone, in his novels, is far less frequent and overlapping than Gertrude Stein's: no one would mistake one of his novels for one of hers. It is when he comes to combine words with visual images in repeti- tion that the likeness arises; then we get the frequency, and lack of causality that make up a "Stein effect." To describe this in L'Annee derniere a Marienbad requires the artificiality of naming images, but those that open the film can be represented as follows (the film's three char- acters are "X," the protagonist and narrator, "A," the girl, and "M," the dark man, her hus- band or guardian): ceiling bays and columns... a chandelier ... gilded figures . . . doorway . . . ceiling . . . mirrored walls re- flecting the ceiling . . . corridor ... print of formal garden ... gilded figure ... door ... hallway ... ceil- ing . . . men and women in formal dress... M... actress before backdrop of statue and formal garden ... an actor ... M ... the actress raises her right arm to her left shoulder ... men and women converse after the play... A, with her right hand up to her left shoulder ... groups of people in hallways, before a doorway ... columns ... arches ... X by a mirror, in which appear a man and a woman in conversation ... a man looks at a print of a formal garden in a hall- way... X. The pattern here is to show the setting-the baroque hotel-without people, peopled only with the gilded figures of nymphs and putti; then the people, rigid and silent; then the setting in- cluding people; then the people in conversation; then the setting empty again, to begin again. The soundtrack here is made up of the voice of X, ac- companied by organ music, and until the actress speaks the final line of the play on the stage sound and voice are outside image, rather than seeming to originate within it: soundless rooms where footsteps sink into rugs so deep steps . . . steps are silent to the ear . . . halls and vast galleries of another age . .. this vast hotel ... baroque... dismal... heavy with stucco moldings ... marble... darkening mirrors... murky paint- ings . . . pillars ... hallways . .. crossing hallways as if it were sand or gravel or flagstones on which I moved again. . . through these hallways ... rooms . . . galleries ... in this structure of another age ... vast ... rich ... baroque... dismal where footsteps sink into rugs so deep the steps are silent to the ear as if the ear were far ... far away from the ground . . . from the rugs ... far from this empty setting, from this intricate frieze of boughs and wreaths, like ancient foliage ... as if the ground were gravel or flagstones on which I moved... once again... on my way to meet you amid the walls... panels... stucco moldings... paintings... engravings... through which I moved once again in a place where, even then, I waited for you ... far from where I now stand... before you . . . still waiting for him who will come no more ... to separate us again ... to tear you from me. Will you come?'1 These images and words occupy the first fifteenth of the film, but present all its char- acters and themes: M, A, and X; the hotel and garden, which merge into each other; the carved and gilded surroundings, which include statues, paintings, mirrors, and engravings; the narrator's quest through gardens and rooms, which he 9 Gertrude Stein, p. 18. 10 Laurent Le Sage, The French New Novel (University Park, Pa., 1962), p. 28. Le Sage quotes from Bruce Morris- sette, "New Structure in the Novel: Jealousy by Alain Robbe- Grillet," Evergreen Review, 3 (1959), 105. I do not mean here to deny that a writer can imitate musical form-as it is conventionally described in words. The effort is almost necessarily mechanical (Huxley's Point Counter Point) and superficial (Lanier's "The Symphony"), like Herbert's or Cummings' assumption of spatial form. The "Sirens" epi- sode of Joyce's Ulysses is an outstanding attempt to go further. Semantic content has been assigned to music by writers of program music, but it is not conventional. It cculd be (tone languages can, for instance, justifiably be called more "musical" than stress languages), but it isn't. n Last Year at Marienbad, scenario and dialogue by Alain Robbe-Grillet, directed by Alain Resnais.

From here on all is repetition, rhythmic alternation, as in A Novel of Thank You: The central theme of the novel is that they were glad to see each other. He because he had and she because she had and he because he had and had again and had again come again.... Supposing they had been there as it was often afterwards helped... A story of a young man who was very nearly per- fectly certain that perfectly certain. The next time in winning. A story of an older man who was perfectly certainly perfectly certainly ... not as not as it.... She says not to be always ready to do it.... And now and then when it would be just as well was just as well ... Not so much as an end. Or ending. Not so much... Not impossible at all impossible and not at all and not at all as at all .. .12 Later in the film there are spots of "had and had again and had again" that underscore the method by presenting it at its most perceptible. A and X stand at the bar amid the dancers; in the next instant A is in her bedroom, alone; then A and X stand at the bar again-this is repeated fourteen times in the next few moments. And again, when A waits for M in the bedroom, she walks to the bed from the right and lies down on her right elbow. A jump cut shows her approach- ing from the left and lying down on her left el- bow. Another cut shows her lying down from the right, as before, and a final cut shows her lying down from the left again, and this time she opens the album she has been carrying. But, from a thematic point of view, the only elements added to the opening are illustrative ones: the game of nim that the young man hoped the next time to win from the older man, the chambre imaginaire, and the rape that was not by force. At the end perhaps there is not so much an end as another beginning, for the narrator is once more wander- ing the trackless garden in the company of the young woman.13 Robbe-Grillet has said that to find out what happens to the characters in Marienbad you must simply put the film back in the projector and start over: "Apres le mot 'fin,' il ne se passe plus rien du tout, par defini- tion. Le seul avenir que l'ceuvre puisse accepter, c'est un nouveau deroulement identique: en remettant les bobines du film dans l'appareil a projections."'4 This sets the Steinian repetitions of the film inside a frame of cyclical, large-scale repetition modified by this "rien du tout," and there are as well indications of this in the film itself. The end occurs right at the beginning, in fact; among the first lines spoken on screen are those of the actor and actress on the stage in the hotel in the film, which include: The whole story has come to its end ... In a few seconds it will harden forever in a marble past, like these statues, this stone garden.... Even as this hotel, the rooms now deserted ... the characters mute ... dead ... dead long since. The progression of the film is to work back around to that end on the level of the actors who are not on the stage but in the audience. We might go so far as to say that the theatrical per- formance which opens the film is the same one being performed the night the film ends.15 As Gertrude Stein put it, "always . . . one commences again,"'1 for there is no other way of expressing the "rhythm of the visible world,""7 12 Novel of Thank You, pp. 72-74. 13 Here I cover ground of interpretation that is highly controversial. I dismiss Resnais' implied interpretation of the film he made (in Cahiers du Cinema, No. 123) as the effort of a man used to linear, progressive narrative, to construct such a narrative. Since he followed Robbe-Grillet's text on the whole very closely, he could not do so, and what he thinks of his attempt is essentially irrelevant. The differences be- tween the text and the film are not such as to make more of a conventional story: the greatest is the part-suppression of the rape scene, and that might have been done for fear of censorship. Bruce Morrissette, in his Les Romans de Robbe- Grillet (Paris, 1963), p. 203, states that Resnais substituted the "white scene" for the rape, but the actual order of shots is as follows: X climbing stairs / A on bed, X entering in silhouette and approaching bed as she draws back with expression of fear, raising her arms as if to protect herself / pan rearward out door of room, cutting off view of scene / swift pan down long hall w. overexposed "white effect" / at end of hall swift turn into short side corridor and into room at end, where A stands opening her arms wide in wel- come (the "white scene"). Clearly the rape scene is cut, but not cut out or replaced by the white scene (Morrissette, p. 208), except in that X may be "composing" a scene of force into one of consent. 14 Pour un nouveau roman (Paris, 1963), pp. 166-67. So Morrissette refers to the "circularity" of the film in his Alain Robbe-Grillet (New York, 1965), p. 35; in parallel fashion La Jalousie has both its first and last chapters en- titled "Maintenant l'ombre du pilier," and Olga Bernal, in her Alain Robbe-Grillet: le roman de l'absence (Paris, 1964), p. 152, says that it "se termine donc par ou il avait com- mence, la conscience du narrateur va recommencer son parcours circulaire." The film L'Immortelle introduces all its themes in the first few minutes, and then reworks them. 15 Despite a difference in stage setting, the two actors and their costumes are the same. The first set was the garden, the second an interior; this can itself be said to match the garden/hotel-interior alternation of the film as a whole. Dina Dreyfus, "Cinema et roman," Revue d'Esthetique, 15 (1962), 77-79, says "Le theme dominant, dans toutes ces oeuvres [of Robbe-Grillet] est la repetition.... On voit le lien qui existe entre le theme de la repetition et le theme du labyrinthe: l'un et l'autre designent un monde sans issue." 16 Lectures, p. 194. 17 The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (New York, 1933), p. 145. 1099</page><page sequence="5">Gertrude Stein at Marienbad and as I have noted, this process, by being as- serted as the basis of both the artist's composition and the reality he seeks to compose, merges the artist and his art. This is what Gide (Les Faux- Monnayeurs) and Huxley (Point Counter Point) did, and many other twentieth-century writers: write a novel about a man writing a novel. Gertrude Stein merely thought to express it in the metaphor of repetition, and Robbe-Grillet can then insist that the nature of Marienbad is the nature of reality-the repetitive patterns into which people, gestures, paintings, statues fall-and the effort of the narrator and the spec- tator is that of the artist, to compose them into a whole. For X is what Robbe-Grillet calls the "hero-narrator" of the new novel: "ce n'est plus seulement un homme qui decrit les choses qu'il voit, mais en meme temps celui qui invente les choses autour de lui et qui voit les choses qu'il invente."'8 It is impossible for A to approach the bed from the left and at the same time approach it from the right; she cannot both be shot by M and leave with X: X must choose and compose. This is exactly the effort of the writer creating the fictional character of the hero-narrator, for he in his turn is to "participer a une creation, d'inventer a son tour l'oeuvre-et le monde-et d'apprendre ainsi a inventer sa propre vie."'9 Gertrude Stein put this point thus: "any one creating the composition in the arts . . . [is] con- ducting life and that makes their composition what it is, makes their work compose as it does." The artist lives his composition, while those liv- ing in his time compose their living: "The com- position is the thing seen by every one living in the living they are doing, they are the composing of the composition that at the time they are living is the composition of the time in which they are living."20 Next in line and logically forced into the process is the reader or spectator, who must himself compose for himself, rather than passively accept what is done for him, or all that is taken for granted by more conven- tional art. In Marienbad, says Robbe-Grillet, the images are mental and subjective, so it follows that "Ces choses doivent se passer dans la tee de quelqu'un. Mais de qui?" First in the head of Robbe-Grillet himself, naturally enough; then in the head of X and partly in the head of A; then, and here is the answer Robbe-Grillet gives to awaken his audience to the novelty of his artistic effort, "le seul 'personnage' important est le spectateur; c'est dans sa tete que se deroule toute l'histoire, qui est exactement imaginee par lui."21 "Help yourself," says A Novel of Thank You, which is any novel you want to make of it, "After that at each time no one is any more re- lated." As Michael Hoffman describes Gertrude Stein's work, "The reader is forced to do nothing less than become a part of the creative process himself."22 Imposing the responsibility for composition on the reader or spectator destroys the plot, the order imposed upon events, gestures, and ob- jects by a scheme, and usually by a set of values, in the author's mind. "Nothing should follow something because in this way there will come to be a middle and a beginning and an end and of course that does make identity but not the hu- man mind or not the human mind";23 Gertrude Stein resisted the period or full stop as passion- ately as she did the manufactured ending, for "writing should go on."24 Robbe-Grillet takes the same position for the same reason, that it is truer to life, for the world does not supply plot, the "recit lineaire aux enchainements 'logiques' " that gives such a satisfying but false basis to the novels of Balzac or the cinema du papa.25 The readers who look to find their values, their logic and order, in Robbe-Grillet or Gertrude Stein are frustrated, and in most cases their frustration takes one of two forms-forcing an explication by applying the missing order, or rejecting the work on the basis that explication is impossible. Either course misses the point.26 It is only superficially paradoxical that both Gertrude Stein and Robbe-Grillet demonstrate an interest in the detective thriller, which de- pends on complexity and coherence in plot. Gertrude Stein seems to have been fascinated by the figure of Dillinger, wanted most to meet Dashiell Hammett when in California, and said, 18 Pour un nouveau roman, p. 177. 19 Pour un nouveau roman, p. 169. 20 Selected Writings, pp. 516, 517. 21 Pour un nouveau roman, p. 166. 22 Abstractionism, p. 136. 23 The Geographical History of America (New York, 1936), p. 117, quoted by Allegra Stewart, Gertrude Stein and the Present (Cambridge, Mass., 1967), p. 46. 24 Lectures, p. 217. 25 "Introduction," L'Annte derniere d Marienbad (Paris, 1961), p. 12. 26 Gertrude Stein's work is generally rejected, while the books published on it take the other choice of forcing ex- plication-Stewart (Gertrude Stein and the Present) strains manfully to get an ordered relation to anatomy, but must admit at the same time, "I do not mean that one can always translate . . .into logical English or convince every reader that there is any 'right' reading" (p. 79). Bruce Morrissette cannot resist the temptation to apply the grille of a textbook on hypnotism to Marienbad, and to find order in its chronology and motivation, because, one feels, he would be otherwise unable to write about it-and he apologizes while doing so (Romans de Robbe-Grillet, Ch. vi; Alain Robbe-Grillet, pp. 7-9). 1100</page><page sequence="6">Strother B. Purdy "Anybody can be interested in a story of a crime";27 Robbe-Grillet constantly puts together the elements of a crime thriller-rape, murder, torture, disappearance, pursuit of clues, and so forth-but to both writers the event seemingly most in need of plotting is actually that which best represents the hostility of reality to order- ing, to the acceptance of grilles. An unsolved mystery is the perfect analogy for a reality lack- ing structure, a novel lacking plot. After con- sidering the "deroulement chronologique, intri- gues lineaires, courbe reguliere des passions" of the traditional novel, with its "image d' un univers stable, coherent, continu, univoque, entierement dechiffrable," Robbe-Grillet concludes "Racon- ter est devenu proprement impossible."28 Implicit in the elimination of plot is the elimi- nation of the traditional concept of character, for character is demonstrated by plotted action. Robbe-Grillet doesn't give his Marienbad char- acters names at all in the film version, and only the letters X, A, and M in the printed text. He lists "le personnage" along with "l'histoire" as "notions perimees";29 so Gertrude Stein writes of "letting out names in novels,"30 and progresses from Three Lives, in which character is of the diminished cceur simple form, to A Novel of Thank You, in which "Everybody is named Etienne. Everybody is named Charles. Every- body is named Alice."31 Attendant upon this process of undermining those elements that "give meaning" is an authorial point of view of utter neutrality, a lack of any comment or moral interpretation. The world simply is for Robbe-Grillet: "le monde n'est ni significant ni absurde. Il est, tout simple- ment"; the artist creates from it in order to create from it-in terms of social theory he creates for nothing, and has nothing to say ("l'artiste . . . s'apergoit vite qu'il ne peut creer que pour rien.... le veritable ecrivain n'a rien a dire").32 As Gertrude Stein glorified the sen- tence as an end in itself, Robbe-Grillet says that the author has in mind "d'abord . . . des mouvements des phrases, des architectures ... des constructions grammaticales, exactement comme un peintre a en tete des lignes et des couleurs."33 Line and color make up a painting; a novel so considered is pure form, purely neutral description: "c'est dans leur forme [that of all works of art] que reside leur realite."34 In parallel fashion, Gertrude Stein, in her work, has always been possessed by the intellectual passion for exactitude in the description of inner and outer reality. She has pro- duced a simplification by this concentration, and as a result the destruction of associational emotion in poetry and prose. She knows that beauty, music, decoration, the result of emotion should never be the cause, even events should not be the cause of emotion nor should they be the material of poetry and prose. They should consist of an exact reproduction of either an outer or an inner reality. It was this conception of exactitude that made the close understanding between Gertrude Stein and Juan Gris.35 Of course, no one can really do all these things to a work of literature and still write it; if Robbe-Grillet really wrote to the letter of his principles, we would not be able to read him, for he would have written what Flaubert, the originator of many of these ideas, only dreamed of writing, the novel about nothing. Gertrude Stein came much closer to this ideal. But we are not done with the immediate con- sequences of the Steinian approach: repetition, of whatever type, tends to undermine a conven- tional, unidirectional time scheme. As the "eternal return" or cyclical repetition breaks down difference between the present and the past, the Steinian cinema repetition breaks up the flow of time altogether. Can you be sure that what comes after in clock time does not "belong" before? You have no way of telling the direction;36 "last year" at Marienbad remains always undiscoverable because its events are not distinguishable from those of this year, except by an effort of composition on the part of the 27 Lectures, p. 167. 28 Pour un nouveau roman, p. 37. 29 "Sur quelques notions perimees" (1957), repr. in Pour un nouveau roman. 30 Novel of Thank You, p. 93. 31 P. 43. 32 Pour un nouveau roman, pp. 21, 42, 51. Absence of autho- rial point of view is of course possible along with conventional time scheme and plot, as in Madame Bovary. It can be argued, however, that no one can write without an attitude toward what he is writing, so that the author is always somehow discoverable in his work. 33 Pour un nouveau roman, p. 49. 34 Pour un nouveau roman, p. 49. 35 The Autobiography, p. 259. 36 In his section on the Arrow of Time, David Hawkins, The Language of Nature: An Essay in the Philosophy of Science (San Francisco, 1964), p. 217, takes the example of losing order as cards are shuffled: "If the direction of time is defined as that of decreasing order, of increasing entropy, then, on the average, there is no direction at all. Applied cosmologically, such a model means that, by going far enough into our past or our future, we should reach a time when the direction was reversed; in our future there might be beings for whom the direction was the opposite of ours, so that they also would say that our world lay in their future." We could say that the games of nim in Marienbad are directional, for their moves cannot be played backward, but no order among the games, after the first, is indicated. 1101</page><page sequence="7">Gertrude Stein at Marienbad narrator or the spectator. Last year he took the photograph, he insists, and this year he shows it to her; last year the water in the fountains did not freeze, nor this year either; last year Frank was perhaps there, this year he may come, and so forth. In his role as compositor X offers A, in Robbe-Grillet's words, "a past and a future,"37 for the labyrinth of the hotel and its garden are without time, or, in other words, are always in present time, the time of the utterly neutral work of art that makes no claims about the world and passes out of existence when not experi- enced.38 No medium is better able to assert the immediacy of artistic present time than the film, for on the screen the action is always occurring, and has a natural "presence" with which special measures must be taken to convince the specta- tor that he is watching time anterior to the time of performance-a closeup of an actor's face with eyes closed; a backward riffling of calendar pages; a change to more youthful appearance of actors already seen, and so forth. And even then, such flashbacks cannot run more than a minute or two before the spectators begin to forget the asserted time shift and fall under the spell of the present time of the action going on before their eyes. As Robbe-Grillet points out, "sur l'image, les verbes sont toujours au present... de toute evidence, ce que l'on voit sur l'ecran est en train de se passer";39 a film, like Marienbad, that as- serts no other time than that of the image present on the screen is a film in tune with its medium. As Gertrude Stein put it, "the time of the com- position is the time of the composition,"40 and in describing how she wrote Three Lives she was really telling how the idea of repetition led her into the idea of a continual present: In the beginning... I wrote a negro story called Melanctha. In that there was a constant recurring and beginning there was a marked direction in the direction of being in the present although naturally I had been accustomed to past present and future, and why, because the composition forming around me was a prolonged present.... I created then a pro- longed present naturally I knew nothing of a con- tinuous present but it came naturally to me to make one.41 Gertrude Stein's three principles of composition are continuous present, beginning again, and us- ing everything. Without commenting on the last I may say that the first two and their inter- relation are very much her original contribution to the literature of our century; when Robbe- Grillet speaks of the "present perpetuel" of his film-novel, "qui rend impossible tout recours a la memoire," and creates "un monde sans passe,"42 he is echoing her censure of "remember- ing," which causes "confusion of present with past and future time," and following, consciously or not, her example in the "looking that was not confusing itself with remembering," the chosiste example of Tender Buttons.43 On the other hand, although Gertrude Stein realized that "cinema .. .had a new way of understanding sight and sound in relation to emo- tion and time" that enabled it "to completely express that complete actual present,"44 and not everyone realized that, the fact is that Robbe- Grillet has been the first to embody these prin- ciples in a film, where, I say with a mixture of enthusiasm and regret, they truly belong. II In Marienbad, repetition and time-presence receive the support of an apt visual symbol, the mirror. Its source is not Gertrude Stein, and its history goes far back into the history of litera- ture, but its use in the film underlies the last point of comparison I am going to make, that of the treatment of the object in the two writers. The mirror shows a reflection, a repeated image, when an image is placed before its surface. That repeated image is present in the same time as the original image. If you put time up to a mirror, it repeats itself; if you put structure up to it, the two ends are both beginnings, and a passage through the structure progresses to a midpoint from where things are experienced in reverse order, a discouraging process for those seeking a way out. The reflected image is a trap, for its boundaries are strictly controlled by the limits of the visible: the hall from which A is seen com- ing by X has no end, because it is seen in reflec- tion. The room you see in the mirror also has a door leading out to the garden, but that is not a 37 "Introduction," p. 13. 38 The references made by the actor and X to a "passe de marbre" are part of a total, or enveloping past that X asserts (X narrates the film in the past tense). This past is that of death as well, but does not affect the acted present time of the film, which is static and timeless in the sense described. See Robbe-Grillet: "Pourquoi chercher a recon- stituer le temps des horloges dans un recit qui ne s'inquiete que de temps humain? N'est-il plus sage de penser a notre propre memoire, qui n'est jamais chronologique" (Pour un nouveau roman, p. 150). All memory is past, but inside that frame it is timeless. 39 "Introduction," p. 15. 40 Selected Writings, p. 522. 41 Selected Writings, p. 517. 42 Pour un nouveau roman, p. 165. 43 Lectures, p. 188. 4 Lectures, pp. 104-05. 1102</page><page sequence="8">Strother B. Purdy garden you can leave once you are in it. The only way out is back through the mirror, or out of the story, if it is a mirror story; that is what Alice discovered when she went Through the Looking- Glass.4 In like fashion A, her broken shoe in her hand, runs down one garden alley after another, only to see that there is no way out and is forced to return. She runs from X through the mirrored rooms and out onto the balcony, but then col- lapses at the sight of the garden. She is doomed to break her shoe there once more in his com- pany, to return to her bedroom for another, to be raped, to be killed, to return to the green room and open the book that has the picture of her under the statue in the garden a year before. The garden is a labyrinth that exits only into the hotel, and the hotel exits only into the garden. All doors visible in the film open into other rooms in the hotel or into the garden; there are no others. This is clearly indicated at the "end," when X and A leave together, for they only leave into the garden, where they were before, and X's last words describe them as "lost" there.46 Our first view of X is as he stands beside a mirror, watching a man and a woman whom we see reflected. As he listens they repeat the themes of his conversations with A, which are those in turn of the speeches of the actors in the play we have just seen, after being carried by the long opening pan through the mirrored halls of the hotel. The film's structure can be outlined thematically on either side of this mirror by which we first see the narrator-hero: Labyrinth of halls and mirrors Garden Theater Actor Actress mirror-surfacc Man Woman Frank his niece X A Theater Garden Labyrinth The opening sequence of halls and mirrored walls and doorways establishes what by repeti- tion will become labyrinthine in effect.47 X's narration, with its repeated mention of "boughs and wreaths... ancient foliage" in the gilded interior decoration, draws the parallel between hotel, with its elaborate and geometrical arrange- ment, and formal garden, one whose terms are reversed at the end when the garden is described as being of stone, without plants or living things. The theater stage is set as a formal garden, and the actor, in lines later repeated by X, strengthens the comparison with the assertion that "the whole story ... will harden forever in a marble past... like these statues... this stone garden . . . even as this hotel ... the rooms now deserted ... the characters mute ... dead long since."48 This brings us to the surface of the mirror, in which we see another actor and actress (the "Man" and "Woman" of the diagram), and hear another version of the theme of despairing pur- suit of and appeal to a woman within an orna- mented wasteland. "I can't bear this role any more!" he cries, "Our life here worse than death . . . side by side... like twin coffins buried in a frozen garden, a garden of soothing formality, with clipped shrubs and ordered paths where we stroll .. .always within reach but never coming an inch closer!"49 Before we come to X and A together we hear of Frank and his niece, whose drama of attempted seduction was presumably acted out in the hotel "last year." It may well be this story that X recomposes, or merges himself and A into. They begin in parallel, certainly; Frank had come to the girl's bedroom on the pretense of explaining a picture, but the room contained no pictures; X attempts to ex- plain the picture in the hallway to A, insisting the while that her bedroom contains not pictures but mirrors, in particular a mirror in a place where she claims there is a picture. The last night in the film brings us back to the first night with the repetition of the theater performance. The labyrinth note is sounded again, and merges finally with that of the gar- den-this is only a restatement of the effect of the visual and aural repetition noted previously, but the mirrors add the element of trompe 'oeil and of traditional symbolism-in Cocteau's Orphee the land of the dead lies behind mirrors; in Lewis Carroll the land in which the order of appearance and reality, along with the arrow of time, are reversed. In Robbe-Grillet the effect is of a trap, in which the living are imprisoned among the dead as nature is by art, leaves by gilt, the human form by statues, and space by 46 See particularly the garden scene (The Works of Lewis Carroll, ed. Roger L. Green, London, 1965), p. 129. 46 L'Annee derniere d Marienbad, p. 172. 47 So Robbe-Grillet comments on "l'architecture lab- yrinthique (glaces, colonnes, etc.) caracteristique de l'h6tel" (Marienbad, p. 169) and states that "l'effet de labyrinthe est augmente par la presence de glaces monumentales, qui renvoient d'autres perspectives de passages compliques... on essaie plusieurs routes pour trouver une issue" (p. 98). 48 Parallel French text, Marienbad, pp. 30, 31. 49 Parallel French text, Marienbad, p. 36. 1103</page><page sequence="9">Gertrude Stein at Marienbad corridors, paths, and the surfaces of things. The trompe-'oeil theme is a transformation of ob- jects, making one thing look as if it were some- thing else. This supports the main transformation of Marienbad, that garden equals hotel and hotel equals garden, and also supports the theme of the film, the subjective existence of reality and the necessity for its "composition." The mirror is totally objective, reversing whatever is held up to it without any point of view of its own, and it is also dead. But we are living and inescapably subjective: this is the subjective objectivity of Robbe-Grillet's literary theory, the combina- tion of "les choses sont la" and "l'homme voit les choses."50 Objects crowd Marienbad; the ac- tors are almost never seen without being sur- rounded by them, and there are frequent sug- gestions of their being imprisoned by them. But their existence is totally dependent upon their being perceived and composed by some human consciousness:51 thus the arguments of X and A over the gestures of the statue of Charles III and the furnishings of her bedroom. So far so good: Marienbad is certainly a power- ful demonstration of the dependence of visual perception upon emotional state. But the role of the object in it appears somewhat different from what it bears in Robbe-Grillet's literary theory, at least from 1958 on. Far more fitting to Marienbad than the rigid chosisme of "Nature, Humanisme, Tragedie" is a quotation from Bousquet he made in "Joe Bousquet le Reveur" (1953): "Nous regardons passer les choses pour oublier qu'elles nous regardent mourir."52 This is the humanisme, the anthropomorphism, that Robbe-Grillet professes to scorn; it lurks tacitly in the assumption of a composing conscious- ness-to quote from the Bousquet article again: "le temps et l'espace sont l'oeuvre de l'homme. ... la plus haute qualite de notre esprit est seule- ment la facult . . . de concevoir une forme qui puisse donner l'unite au monde et 'l'elever a notre ressemblance.'"53 We must "reinvent the things that surround us."54 This inner contradic- tion remains in Robbe-Grillet's later writings, for they lead directly into that in which "le monde, c'est l'homme."55 The closest parallel is drawn between objects and people in Marienbad; they are put in analogical contiguity.5 Robbe-Gri- llet's attack on metaphor57 is sadly undermined by the fact that Marienbad is one great metaphor, metaphor raised to the highest power. It is my view that Robbe-Grillet's theoretical difficulty stems from a misapprehension of the nature of language, of the relation of word to ob- ject and to visual image, and that he has only narrowly been saved, by his share of the human- ism he scorns, from committing the same errors that Gertrude Stein, starting from a similar theoretical position, was led into by a mixture of logic and linguistic misapprehension. Life does not exist in terms of objects, it "exists" in terms of human apprehension, and the terms of that apprehension are words. Words and objects are not interchangeable, nor are they separable. The word cannot become an object, nor is there finally any such thing as an objective description, which could exist only if human beings were objects. The word cannot be rid of its human content, its "attitude," because it is the most subjective of human inventions. Gertrude Stein began, in the late twenties, "to describe landscape as if anything she saw was a natural phenomenon, a thing existent in itself," by which she felt she could achieve the perfectly objective style, "her real achievement of the commonplace."58 To her mind, the "great difficulty that bothered anybody creating any- thing in this generation" was keeping the ob- ject seen (as in painting) or described (as in writing) from becoming attached to things out- side itself, things allowed to leak in from outside the artistic presentation.59 This "remembering" spoiled the independence of the object and its continual present time: "The trouble with in- cluding looking ... was that in regard to human beings looking inevitably carried in its train realizing movements and expression and as such forced me into recognizing resemblances, and so forced remembering and in forcing remembering 50 Pour un nouveau roman, p. 21; Le Monde interview with Robbe-Grillet, 13 May 1961. 61 See Le Monde interview; Pour un nouveau roman, pp. 147-49. 62 Both essays are reprinted in Pour un nouveau roman. 53 Pour un nouveau roman, p. 114. 4 "Chaque homme, a son tour, doit reinventer les choses autour de lui" (Pour un nouveau roman, p. 119). 56 Pour un nouveau roman, p. 78. 66 Ben F. Stoltzfus, Alain Robbe-Grillet and the French New Novel (Carbondale, Ill., 1964), pp. 102-21, realizing this, tries to save the film for chosisme theory by depicting A and X as "wrong," tragically committing the error of anthropomorphizing objects, etc., which has the odd effect of claiming that Robbe-Grillet has written a deliberately pre- nouveau roman in order to follow his theory of the nouveau roman. 67 See Le Sage, The French New Novel, p. 35: "Robbe- Grillet has openly repudiated the metaphor"; Pour un nouveau roman, pp. 59-60. 68 The Autobiography, p. 276.

Purdy caused confusion of present with past and future time."60 This remembering prevents the crea- tion of "the thing in itself";6' this concern is exactly that of Robbe-Grillet when he says "l'ambition de tout le roman [aujourd'hui]" is to sever all exterior connections that enable or encourage the reader to bring in associations of his own, and to write "sans avoir a s'appuyer sur quoi que ce soit d'exterieur a l'ceuvre."62 Robbe-Grillet considers this implicit in Flau- bert's desire to write a novel about nothing, "a partir de rien," but neither he nor Flaubert attempted that, or even seriously considered attempting it. Gertrude Stein did. She saw, as early as 1912, that the simplest approach to it was to eliminate the human element and con- centrate on the lifeless object:63 this effort be- came Tender Buttons, with its three parts, "Ob- jects," "Food," and "Rooms." Frederick Hoff- man could thus say that "she sought not le mot juste but l'objet juste."64 To fit words to this kind of description of objects, Gertrude Stein had to seek out words that lacked "any quality of de- scription"; to that extent Hoffman was right to say that she "was engaged in nothing less than nonrepresentational writing." I have already noted the impossibility of such a task. Robbe-Grillet may scorn Sartre for his brilliant subjectivism of view in La Nausee, and set out to capture the "presence opaque des choses,"65 but it is a destination he cannot reach. He has produced a film in which the wonder and terror spring from the danger of people's dying into objects, which are their own creation, and of assuming the marble past by death in life. The message of Bousquet, "asservis-toi a l'existence des choses,"66 is clearly negated. The word may be separated from the image-so X's words on the soundtrack diverge from the image on the screen-but it cannot of itself become the image.67 Robbe-Grillet is saved from the sterility of this by his remembering, even if it is an unconscious act. In 1934, Gertrude Stein wrote "the cinema has never read my work"; I think we can now say that it has. Her theories are ideally, and only, realizable by a film,68 and such a film is L'Annee derniere a Marienbad, where the form of repeti- tion, grounded in the living mind as the agent of composition, presents a powerful synthesis of life and art.

Bufiuel's El angel exterminador (1962) has a remarkable use of repeated acts and speeches, mainly to emphasize the absurd. 1105</page></plain_text>
