<plain_text><page sequence="1">A spatial analysis of rock art located within the lower Pecos region of southwest Texas and northern Mexico reveals the pres- ence of a recurring motif that depicts anthropomorphic figures passing through an opening in a serpentine arch. An exten- sive review of the ethnographic literature and archaeological record of cultures within Mesoamerica and the Gran Chichimeca indicates that this motif is widespread and generally associated with specific beliefs about the shamanic journey into the spirit world. Based on analogies drawn from the ethnographic literature, the lower Pecos region motif can be inter- preted as a pictographic representation of the shamanic journey made by Archaic Chichimecans into the spirit world. The evidence also indicates that the cosmologies of the cultures within Mesoamerica and the Gran Chichimeca were well estab- lished in the Chihuahuan Desert at least 4,000 years ago. Este artfeulo presenta un ana'lisis espacial sobre el arte rupestre en la region de Baja Pecos en el suroeste de Texas y el norte de Me'xico. Dicho ana'lisis revela la presencia de una serie de ima'genes recurrentes que retratan figuras antropomorficas, las cuales atraviesen una apertura o hueco en un arco serpentino ("serpentine arch"). Un estudio intensivo sobre la liter- atura etnogra'fica y el registro arqueologico de las culturas mesoamericanas y de las culturas de la Gran Chichimeca pre- senta notables paralelismos entre las ima'genes pictogra'ficas y la manera en que estas culturas visualizan y conmemoran sus cosmologfas. El me'todo utilizado para el presente estudio es basado en el establecimiento de analogias entre las ima'genes recurrentes en la region de Baja Pecos y los viajes espirituales de los hechiceros ("shamanic journeys") realizada por los antiguos chichimecas. Esto sugiere a su vez que las cosmologias de las culturas de Mesoame'rica y la Gran Chichimeca se arraigaron en el desierto de Chihuahua por lo menos hace cuatro mil anos atra's. Carolyn E.

Copyright (C) by the Society for American Archaeology The art of ancient cultures has served as an enduring record of intellectual and spiri- tual expression. These artistic images served to regulate land ownership; validate hier- archical responsibilities of the priests and clan members; calculate time; record events, tradi- tions, and histories of clans and societies; and commemorate the group's cosmology (Schele and Miller 1986; Spinden 1975). In the archaeological record, art as an artifact serves as a window into all components of the sociocultural system: tech- nological, social, and ideological. For decades researchers thought the meaning behind most rock art was lost along with the artists who created it. The generally accepted idea has been that one person's interpretation of the art is as good as another's. Only recently has there been a shift away from this highly limiting approach to rock-art interpretation to an approach based on ethnographic analogy (Boyd 1992, 1993; Boyd and Dering 1996; Dowson 1988; Lewis-Williams 1981, 1987, 1992; Lewis- Williams and Dowson 1990; Whitley 1992). Before archaeologists were able to secure dates through methods such as radiocarbon dating, they could only speculate on the age of an artifact. We now have the ability to obtain accurate dates, and speculation is no longer acceptable. The same holds true with rock-art interpretation. The use of ethnographies in the interpretation of rock art has proven to be the key to unlocking the mystery behind the art (Dowson 1988; Lewis-Williams 1981, 1987, 1992; Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1990; Whitley 1992). The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness of using ethnographic analogy to interpret the prehistoric rock art of the lower Pecos region of southwest Texas and northern 152 SHAMANIC JOURNEYS INTO THE OTHERWORLD OF THE ARCHAIC CHICHIMEC Carolyn E.

In particular, I show that the elaborate iconographic expression and ideology associated with shamanism among later prehistoric and modern peoples of Mesoamerica and the Gran Chichimeca were foreshadowed by the rock art created by the Archaic peoples of the lower Pecos region (Figure 1). The region referred to as the Gran Chichimeca includes ". . . that area of the Western Hemisphere which is bounded on the east by the natural bar- rier of the Gulf of Mexico, along the 97th degree of west longitude; on the west by the Pacific Ocean, in the vicinity of the 124th degree of west longitude; on the south by the Tropic of Cancer, at the latitude of 23Â°27' north; and on the north in the vicinity of the 38th degree of north latitude" (DiPeso 1974:53). This term is used in support of DiPeso's efforts to "break away from the ethno- centric habit of using the term 'Southwest' when referring to this larger area" (DiPeso 1974:48). The lower Pecos River region is located within the Gran Chichimeca at the northeastern reaches of the Chihuahuan Desert and is situated at the boundary of four major vegetation zones in North America: the Rio Grande Plains zone of southern Texas, the Tamaulipan Thorn Shrub zone of northeastern Mexico, the Edwards Plateau Oak-Juniper zone, and the Sotol- Lechuguilla/Chihuahuan Desert Shrub zone of Trans-Pecos Texas and north-central Mexico (Dering 1979). The ecological diversity in this region provided an excellent habitat for the pre- historic hunter-gatherer inhabitants, whose sub- sistence and technology were based heavily on the xeric plants of the region: lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), sotol (Dasylirion tescanum), bear grass (Nolina tegsana), and various cacti, oaks, and grasses. The lower Pecos region has been included as part of an archaeologically defined tradition known as the southern North American Archaic. These hunter-gatherer groups occupied the Chihuahuan Desert throughout much of the Holocene (Shafer 1986, 1988). Three major rivers in the area-the Pecos, Devil's, and Rio Grande-dissect this arid range- land, creating a senes of deep canyons that house hundreds of rock overhangs or rock shelters (Shafer 1988; Turpin 1982). For thousands of years, the caves and cliff overhangs within the region provided convenient shelter for the prehis- toric residents. Excavation of the permanently dry rock shelters have yielded basketry, skeletal I' - \ LOWER | \ surron1 PECOS { t \ co i REGION g &lt; . _ _ + q n , , x rp / , v t tronr</page><page sequence="3">154 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 7, No. 2, 1996 remains, coprolites, and other perishable items dating back to approximately 3050 B.C., in addi- tion to an assemblage of desiccated botanical materials spanning the Holocene from 7800 B.C. to European contact (Bement 1989, 1991; Dering 1979; Shafer 1986, 1988; Turpin 1982, 1988). The rock shelters not only served as dwellings for the hunter-gatherer inhabitants of the region, but their walls also provided the surface upon which an array of pictographs were executed. These pictographs have been categorized into four distinctive styles from successive time peri- ods. The earliest is the Pecos River style, which is characterized by monochrome and polychrome anthropomorphic figures. The Pecos River style is followed by the Red Monochrome style, which is identified by more realistically depicted human and animal motifs. The next style, Red Linear, is characterized by diminutive red stick figures of both humans and animals. The latest style is referred to as the Historic style and is identified by themes depicting European contact (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Shafer 1986; Turpin 1982) . The rock-art style addressed here is the Pecos River style. It is the best represented and the most ancient of the recognized styles. Radiocarbon ages provided through accelerator mass spec- trometry for the Pecos River style art range from &gt;2,950 to 4,200 years ago (Hyman and Rowe 1996; Russ et al. 1990). Spatial Analysis and Ethnographic Analogy In the fall of 1990, I began an ongoing spatial analysis of the Pecos River style rock art con- tained within the canyons of the lower Pecos region of southwest Texas and northern Mexico (Boyd 1992). Examinations and analyses of the pictographs were conducted to determine spatial variability and patterns in motif association. The primary motifs for each site were identified and recorded, including their frequency or promi- nence within each pictographic panel. These motifs were counted and density figures for each were determined by dividing the total number of occurrences by the total area of the panel. Concurrently, I conducted an extensive review of the ethnographic literature on cultures within Mesoamerica and the Gran Chichimeca, paying particular attention to the occurrence of motifs Figure 2. Pecos River style motif identified at the Mystic Shelter site (41VV612) in Val Verde County, Texas. Illustrated by the author. and motif associations described in the ethno- graphic literature that were similar to those seen in the rock art. The spatial analysis revealed distinct variabil- ity in modes of distribution and patterns in motif association (Boyd 1992). It also revealed the widespread and frequent occurrence of one of the primary motifs. The characteristics common to this primary motif include an arch formed by a serpentine line, a portal or passageway at the top of the arch, and an emerging or descending anthropomorphic figure (Figures 24). For the purpose of this paper, I focus on three Pecos River style rock-art sites in the region: Mystic Shelter (41VV612), Rattlesnake Canyon (VV180), and White Shaman (VV124). Each of these sites is located along a separate drainage system that feeds into the Rio Grande River. Mystic Shelter (41VV612; Figure 2) is a rock shelter located along the Devil's River. There is no archaeological deposit present at this site. The recurring primary motif identified at the site depicts an anthropomorphic figure passing through a serpentine arch (Figure 2). The poly- chrome anthropomorph is painted in two tones of a reddish-brown pigment, fringed along both sides, with a sinuous black line running down the - - 3:. \ \ JI1L E \\ </page><page sequence="4">Boyd] OTHERWORLD SHAMANIC JOURNEYS OF ARCHAIC CHICHIMECANS 155 :f i; f;ideC;XtiN f 7S00 fiTEd S t4009 k 0 f; iV:fRa;X;$0S f 2 il0400 dit:SEt f t:d W;S StiSit fff R 2 A; D f Figure 3.

The object associated with the nght hand of the anthropomorph has previ- ously been identified as an atlatl and the left hand has been associated with dart points (Kelley 1950, 1971). The serpentine arch is polychrome red and black. There is a break in the top of the arch where the anthropomorph appears to be either emerging or descending. Beneath the arch is a row of small monochrome black anthropomorphs surrounded by black and red dots. Beneath these anthropomorphs are several horizontal red and black lines. The rock-art panel located within Rattlesnake Canyon (VV180; Figure 3) contains a poly- chrome red and black anthropomorph, wearing what appears to be a dual feather headdress and depicted with a vertical band running down the center of the figure. An atlatl is associated with the left hand of the anthropomorph and a staff- like object with an enlarged distal end is associ- ated with the right hand. A circle at the top of the serpentine arch is painted over the chest area of the anthropomorphic figure. Above the anthropo- morph are two polychrome red and black zoomorphic figures. There are archaeological deposits associated with this shelter; however, no excavation of the site has been conducted. The recurring primary motif identified at the White Shaman site (VV124; Figure 4), located along the Pecos River, exhibits characteristics common to both Mystic Shelter and Rattlesnake Canyon. An anthropomorphic figure is depicted either emerging or descending through a passage- way in an elaborate polychrome serpentine arch. This antlered anthropomorph is painted in both red and dark gray with lines running vertically down the center of the figure. On the end of each of the tines of the antler headdress are small black dots. Associated with the right hand of the anthro- pomorph is an atlatl and associated with the left hand is a staff-like object similar to that identified at Rattlesnake Canyon. The enlarged distal end of the object has been previously interpreted as the spinescent fruit of Datura sp. (Boyd and Dering 1996). There is no archaeological deposit present at this site. Review of the Ethnographic Literature Early historic Native American inhabitants of the lower Pecos region abandoned the area before ethnographic data could be collected (Hester 1989). The absence of ethnographic information on the inhabitants of the region forced me to review ethnographies of groups spatially removed from the study area. The ethnographic literature on cultures within Mesoamerica and the Gran Chichimeca revealed several groups suitable for ethnographic analogy. From among these, the Aztec, Huichol, Yaqui, and Pueblo Indian groups were selected for in- depth consideration. All of these are members of the Uto-Aztecan language family, which is the most widely distributed language family in North America, stretching from the Great Basin into the</page><page sequence="5">156 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lVol. 7, No. 2, 1996 neys into the world beyond (Katz 1982:115). According to Eliade (1964), the shaman's tute- lary animal plays an important role in the shamanic journey into the Otherworld. The tute- lary animal or spirit companion enables the shaman to forsake the human condition. The situ- ation that existed in mythical times, when separa- tion between humankind and the animal world had not yet occurred, is reestablished each time the shaman is able to change into an animal (Eliade 1964:94). The shaman experiences a rit- ual death, dying to this world and being reborn into the Otherworld. Aztec This cosmological view is entrenched in cultures of both Mesoamerica and the Gran Chichimeca. The Aztec, whose ancestors were the wandering Chichimecs of the Chihuahuan Desert, perceived their cosmos as divided into several vertically aligned horizontal layers. The world above the earth consisted of 13 layers of heavens. Below the earth lay the nine layers of Mictlan, the land of the dead. Entrance into Mictlan was through a cave that was conceived of as the gaping jaws of a reptilian earth monster (Brundage 1979; Ortiz de Montellano 1990; Pasztory 1983). Caves, oztotl, as defined in the Florentine Codex, were the place of the dead: "Our mothers, our fathers have gone to rest in the water, in the cave, the place of no openings, the place of no smoke hole, the place of the dead" (de Sahagun 1951-1970:11:277). It was also a magical place and provided access to the world of the supernat- ural: "It is wide-mouthed; it is narrow-mouthed. It has mouths which pass through to the other side. I place myself in the cave. I enter the cave" (de Sahagun 1951-1970: 11 :276). Burial in natural and artificial caves was com- mon among the Aztec (Heyden 1981). Replicas of caves were created to serve as portals to the land of the dead. For example, in the Florentine Codex, de Sahagun discusses the cremation process for the bodies of Aztec noblemen and commoners. He noted that after cremation was complete, the Aztec ". . . dug a round hole in which to place it (cremated ashes): a pit. This they called a cave" (de Sahagun 1951-1970:3:45). Another example of the replication of sacred Valley of Mexico. Although I have utilized four Uto-Aztecan groups in this paper to illustrate the effectiveness of ethnographic analogy in inter- preting prehistoric rock art, I do not mean to imply that the Archaic inhabitants of the region were necessarily Uto-Aztecan speakers. At this time, we have no knowledge of what language was spoken by the peoples living in the region during the Archaic period. Each of these groups does, however, maintain similar cosmological beliefs and ideologies associated with accessing the spirit or Otherworld. The conception of the universe consisting of various layers or cosmic regions is a belief held by many cultures around the world (Dupre 1975; Eliade 1959, 1964, 1978; Tooker 1979; Tylor 1970[1958]). For people who conceive of their universe in this manner, the center, axis mundi, is the point of intersection between these regions where communication with the spirit world is possible (Dupre 1975; Eliade 1959, 1964). This central axis passes through an opening or portal in the center of each region. It is through this portal that gods and ancestors are able to travel between regions. It is also through this opening that the soul of the shaman is able to enter the Otherworld and personally confront supernatural forces, while serving as guardian of both the physical and psychic equilibrium of the group (Eliade 1959, 1964; Furst 1976; Tyler 1964; Winkleman 1992). Certain geographic features, such as caves, mountains, and bodies of water, are frequently associated with the axis mundi. The portal to the Otherworld is not, however, restricted to natural aspects of the sacred landscape. A second human- made matrix of power points can be created and sanctified through ritual (Eliade 1959; Ellis and Hammack 1968; Heyden 1981; Schele and Freidel 1990). Access into the Otherworld by a shaman can be achieved through such methods as the use of hallucinogenic plants, fasting, blood-letting, self- hypnosis, and various types of rhythmic activity that place the shaman in an altered state of con- sciousness or trance state (Eliade 1959, 1964; Furst 1972, 1976; Winkleman 1992). When a shaman enters this trance state, it is believed that he/she has experienced death, a death whereby the soul of the shaman leaves the body and jour-</page><page sequence="6">Boydl OTHERWORLD SHAMANIC JOURNEYS OF ARCHAIC CHICHIMECANS 157 geography is illustrated in Aztec architecture. The ruins of many Aztec sites contain structures known as ball courts. In the exact center of the ball court, tlachco, is a circular flagstone that rep- resents the center, axis mundi. In Aztec mythol- ogy, Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent, was said to have opened this sacred portal into the world below (Brundage 1979:11). Aztec art elaborately depicts the prominent role of the serpent in Aztec thought. According to Pasztory, "the most elaborate animal structures are feathered serpents with an earth monster carved under the base. They signify the green sur- face of the earth overlying the voracious under world" (Pasztory 1983:234). The serpent as the earth's surface covering the world below is well illustrated in the Codex Seldon Roll (Figure 5). In this codex is a depiction of the cave birth place, Chicomoztoc. The mouth of the cave is symbol- ized by the maw of the earth monster. Covering the maw is a selpentine arch that represents the earth's surface. The serpent representing the earth's surface also is well illustrated in a stone sculpture at the Museo Nacional de Antropologla in Mexico City. The sculpture depicts a coiled feather serpent with a face emerging from its open jaws. Underneath the serpent stone is a relief of the Tlaloc earth monster. Pasztory states that "the human face emerging from the maw of a feath- ered serpent probably renders an image of rebirth. In Mesoamerican art the disappearance and reap- pearance of the sun, the stars, and the planets were represented metaphorically as being swal- lowed and regurgitated by a monster which often demonstrated serpent characteristics" (Pasztory 1983: 162). Several other animals, in addition to the ser- pent, had supernatural associations. Ortiz de Montellano states that Aztec religion combined "an elaborate state religion with shamanism . . ." (Ortiz de Montellano 1990:67). Human-animal transformation and animal spirit helpers were among the characteristics he identified within Aztec religion that are associated with shaman- ism. For example, the Aztec believed that the ani- mistic force of a shaman, tonalli, could enter the shaman's animal double, nahualli. Aztec gods were also believed to be able to transform into f E wiV3 7XC:;0 Vi C 00:: flD0ff;fiSitSSiSSSl:0000700000000f: Figure 5. The open maw of the earth as depicted in the Codex Seldon Roll. Redrawn by the author from Heyden (1981). their animal familiar at will (Ortiz de Montellano 1990). According to Brundage (1979:82), the ancient Chichimec god known to the Aztec as "Tezcatlipoca" excelled beyond all other Aztec gods at transforming into his animal familiar, the jaguar. Brundage credits this well-established ability to transform into an animal to Tezcatlipoca's shamanic origins. He was not modeled, however, on the shaman who served as a socially cohesive force within society, but "the sorcerer of disruptive magic and furtive mind" (Brundage 1979:82). He was "almost exclusively the practitioner of black magic, as one might guess from the fact that he was left-handed" (Brundage 1979:82). Huichol The iconographic expression and ideology associ- ated with the supernatural realm of the Huichol Indians is similar to that of the Aztec. The Huichol today live in the highland geographical zone of the Sierra Madre Occidental within the states of Jalisco and Nayarit in northwestern Mexico. According to Huichol tradition their nomadic hunting and gathering Chichimec ances- tors migrated into the area from a northern ances- tral homeland in the Chihuahuan Desert (Myerhoff 1974). The Huichol perceive the entire world as being surrounded by the sea that, with its serpent-like motions, is the largest of all serpents. A two-</page><page sequence="7">158 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 7, No. 2, 1996 headed serpent serves as a gateway through which the sun must pass on its dangerous journey into the world below upon setting each day (Lumholtz 1900; Myerhoff 1974). The concept of the serpent as the gateway to the world below is demonstrated in Huichol myth and art. A hole made in the center of the Huichol cere- monial temple, tuki, serves as the axis mundi through which communication with the supernat- ural realm is possible. This sacred cavity is believed to be the doorway through which the shaman is able to descend on his magical flight into the Otherworld (Myerhoff 1974; Zingg 1977 [1938]). Covering this sacred cavity is a small round stone disk referred to as a god disk (Lumholtz 1900; Myerhoff 1974). In Huichol mythology it was otuanaka, the com mother, who commanded that the sacred hole be covered with a god disk and that the disk be engraved with her animals: snakes of blue, green, and yellow (Zingg 1977 [1938]). According to Lumholtz, in Huichol art the ser- pent is used to illustrate the sea surrounding the earth (Lumholtz 1900:166). In a yarn painting created by Huichol shaman/artist, Jose Benitez Sanchez, a Huichol soul is depicted joumeying to the land of the dead (Figure 6). The destination of the soul is through a serpentine arch at the base of the painting. The small upside-down anthropo- morphic figure with a vertical band running down the center of the body represents the shaman. According to the Huichol shaman/artist, Ramon Medina, the practice of depicting the shaman in this skeletonized fashion is done specifically so that the figure will be recognized as that of a shaman. When asked why it is done that way, Ramon responded, "because that is how it was established in the time of the ancestors" (Furst 1978:23). The Huichol soul, being guided by the shaman in the middle of the painting, is depicted passing through the dangerous passageway that leads to the land of the dead. The land of the dead is illus- trated at the base of the painting by a serpentine arch, possibly representing the serpent that sur- rounds the world. As with the Aztec, other animals besides the serpent were associated with the supematural. Among the Huichol, the deer is a sacred and mag- Figure 6.

One of the most important services of Kauyumari is to act as the intermediary between the shaman and the gods. According to Myerhoff, there is reason to believe that Kauyumari is "closely modeled on an actual historical personage, perhaps an important early mara'akame (shaman) who later merged with the Sacred Deer Person" (1974:85). The Huichol describe Kauyumari as follows: We call him Kauyumari. We call him Maxa Kwaxi. It is all one. Kauyumari aids Tatewari (Grandfather Fire). He aids Tataupa (Father Sun). He guides the mara'akame (shaman) in what must be done. So that the peyote can be hunted. So that the mara'akame can take the peyote from the horns of the deer, there in Wirikuta (Myerhoff 1974-87). Kauyumari is conceived of both in the form of a deer and as a person wearing antlers (Furst 1972: 149[footnote]). The Huichol believe that when the deer god descended from heaven he brought peyote on his antlers to the Huichol sacred homeland, Wirikuta (Benitez 1975; Lumholtz 1900:22). On the hunt for peyote, Kauyumari accompa- nies the pilgrims in the likeness of deer antlers and ceremonial arrows. The antlers of Kauyumari guide the pilgrims "to the other side," to the sacred land of Wirikuta (Furst 1972: 162). The dangerous passage through the mystical divide is</page><page sequence="8">Boyd] OTHERWORLD SHAMANIC JOURNEYS OF ARCHAIC CHICHIMECANS 159 made possible by Kauyumari, who holds open the portal to the other side with his antlers (Furst 1972: 165). Yaqui The Yaqui Indians, prior to Spanish contact, were widely dispersed throughout the state of Sonora in northwestern Mexico. Today Yaqui settlements are located in southern Arizona, California, and elsewhere in the western United States as well (Spicer 1940). As with the Aztec and the Huichol, accessing the Otherworld figures prominently in Yaqui mythology. The Yaqui homeland and way of life prior to Chrisitanity, yoania, and the beliefs associated with it "form the basis of Yaqui thought and char- acter" (Painter 1986:3). The Surem, which the Yaqui believe to be their ancestors, lived a nomadic life in a world where nature and man had a common psychic life, communicating through a gift called seataka. This was the way things were prior to the prophecy given through the Talking Tree (Painter 1986; Spicer 1940). In the legend of the Talking Tree, a vibrating tree or stick foretells the coming of Christianity. Those who were willing to accept this new way of life continued to live as Yaquis in Yaqui country. Those who were unwilling to accept the changes went underground as Surem, taking the yoania with them. The Yaqui believe the yoania and the Surem are still there today. Their secrets can be learned through yoania visions that appear in far- off places, such as secret caves in the mountains, or can be communicated through dreams (Painter 1986). Only those individuals who possess the gift of seataka, are earnest in their desire to seek the yoa- nia, and are courageous enough to endure the frightening trials associated with obtaining yoa- nia visions are successful. This terrifying ordeal involves an encounter with a very large snake. According to Painter (1986), entrance and exit to the supernatural world of yoania must be made through the mouth of a giant serpent. This was also noted by Beals (1943) in The Aboriginal Culture of the Cahita Indians, which included the Uto-Aztecan-speaking Yaqui and Mayo. He noted that "despite the documentary statement that shamans inherited ofElce, often they acquired power through visions, possibly through dreams, or through some form of initiation which involved death-and-resurrection concepts that included being swallowed and passed through the body of a snake dwelling in a cave" (Beals 1943:64). The source of a shaman's power, according to Beals, "was the dream or vision, through which an individual acquired the assis- tance of a spirit, in animal form usually, which helped him or over which he had certain control" (Beals 1943:64). The pascola dance group is frequently men- tioned in association with yoania visions. Pascola dances are kept separate from church-sponsored activities. They are performed as the result of a yoania vision obtained in a dream. The Yaqui maintain that pascola knowledge comes from the animals of yoania rather than from Christian supernaturals. Pascola rituals and music are thought to have originally come "from a snake which lived in the water in the mountains" (Spicer 1940:261). Hopi As with the other groups previously discussed, the Hopi of northern Arizona believe that the uni- verse consists of various cosmic levels. The world below is conceived of as a series of waterways beneath the earth. The Horned Water Serpent, residing in the interior of the earth, is considered overseer of this watery world and over all waters of the earth. For the Hopi, the serpent serves as the communicator between the earthly world and the world below. Snakes are released after cere- monies to carry messages to the spirits residing in the watery depths of the world below (Tyler 1964). In addition to the serpent, several animals are believed by the Hopi to possess supernatural power. Tutelary animals or spirit companions that enable magico-religious practitioners, such as shamans and witches, to forsake their human con- dition in order to gain power from the supernat- ural realm, are present within Hopi society. According to Parsons, transformation into ani- mals and getting power from animals is "a con- cept rendered collective through the (Pueblo) societies" (Parsons 1939:63). The transformation is "effected through putting on the animal pelt or</page><page sequence="9">160 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 7, No. 2, 1996 through turning over, that is passing through a hoop or ring" (Parsons 1939:66[footnote]). Within Hopi cosmology, caves are revered as openings to the world below, where the serpent and other supernaturals reside. These openings are symbolized by a hole called a sipapu, which is made in the center of the floor of the ceremonial kiva. The sipapu is kept sealed except during cer- emonies, when it serves as a symbolic entrance into the world below (Ortiz 1972; Waters 1963). In summary, I have identified four concepts as common to each of the groups in the study. These concepts include (1) the universe, consisting of various layers with the supernatural realm exist- ing below the earth's surface; (2) the role of the serpent as the gateway through which one must pass on the journey to the spirit world; (3) sacred portals, both natural and human-made, that access the supernatural realm; and (4) animal spirit helpers or familiars. Archaic Shaman and the Otherworld My review of the ethnographic literature reveals striking similarities between the iconographic expression and ideology associated with the shamanic journey among indigenous Meso- american and Gran Chichimecan peoples and the Pecos River style art of the Archaic peoples of the lower Pecos region. I use the four concepts iden- tified as common among the Aztec, Huichol, Yaqui, and Hopi to offer an interpretation of the primary motif identified at the three lower Pecos pictograph sites previously described: Mystic Shelter (41VV612; Figure 2), Rattlesnake Canyon (VV180; Figure 3), and White Shaman (VV124; Figure 4). Three characteristics common to the primary motif, which include an arch formed by a serpentine line, a portal or passage- way at the top of the arch, and an emerging or descending anthropomorphic figure, are inter- pretable through ethnographic analogy. Mystic Shelter The primary motif identified at Mystic Shelter is one of the most vivid depictions of the shamanic journey into the spirit world (Figure 2). This motif contains elements that are strikingly similar to the Aztec land of the dead, Mictlan. The arch of undulating lines, through which the anthropo- morph is passing, represents the serpent as the earth's surface. At the base of the arch is a hori- zontal band of red and black lines that is reminis- cent of the watery world of Mictlan. Small anthropomorphs contained within the arch possi- bly represent the ancestors residing in the land of the dead. Passing through a portal in the earth's surface is an anthropomorph, depicted in a skele- tonized fashion similar to that used by the Huichol shaman/artist Ramon Medina to identify the figure as a shaman. The body of the anthropo- morph is fringed with small lines that give the appearance of animal fur, possibly representing the merger of the shaman and tutelary animal. Rattlesnake Canyon At Rattlesnake Canyon, the recurring primary motif contains similar elements (Figure 3). The same serpentine lines form the barrier between this world and the world below. The serpentine arch is superimposed over an ornate polychrome skeletonized anthropomorph, giving the impres- sion of the figure emerging from the world below. The two felines, possibly mountain lions, sus- pended above the anthropomorph represent tute- lary animals or spirit helpers. The portal through the gateway serpent is depicted by a circle at the top of the arch. The cir- cle is reminiscent of the hoop used in Hopi cere- monies to effect human-animal transformation. The hoop and, in this case, the circle at the top of the arch represent the sipapu or portal to the Otherworld. In reviewing the ethnographic literature, I identified an additional possible analogy. As mentioned earlier, an atlatl is associated with the left hand of the anthropomorph at Rattlesnake Canyon. This is the only Pecos River style anthropomorph known to this author to have the atlatl associated with the left hand. Among the Aztec and the Hopi, the left hand is associated with death and sorcery (Brundage 1979; Lopez Austin 1988; Parsons 1939). As mentioned ear- lier, Tezcatlipoca, the god of darkness and sor- cery, was left handed. The anthropomorph at Rattlesnake Canyon can be interpreted, therefore, as a sorcerer, ie pracfitioner of black magic, as op- posed to a shaman serving as the guardian of the physical and psychic equilibrium of the group.</page><page sequence="10">OTHERWORLD SHAMANIC JOURNEYS OF ARCHAIC CHICHIMECANS Boyd] 161 White Shaman Emerging from an arch created by elaborate poly- chrome serpentine lines is an antlered anthropo- morph (Figure 4) depicted in a skeletonized manner to illustrate the shaman's rebirth into the Otherworld. The antlers indicate that the shaman has merged with the tutelary animal in this case, the deer. This particular anthropomorph bears remarkable similarities to Kauyumari, the anthro- pomorphized tutelary animal of the Huichol shaman, which, according to Myerhoff, was likely modeled on an actual historical personage, perhaps an important early shaman. Through the analogies that can be drawn between the elements contained in the rock art and the elements involved in the Huichol peyote hunt, I have offered (Boyd 1993; Boyd and Dering 1996) an interpretation of this panel as being a pictorial representation of an Archaic peyote ritual. The recurring motif identified at this site is an integral part of that interpretation, for it is Kauyumari who must hold open the por- tal to the other side with his antlers so that the peyote can be "taken from the horns of the deer, there in Wirikuta" (Myerhoff 1974:87). The dots on the ends of the antler tines on the anthropo- morph represent the peyote buttons. Burial Practices in the Chihuahuan Desert The archaeological record in the lower Pecos region provides additional information that can be used to substantiate my interpretation of the Pecos River style motif as an Archaic shamanic journey. A common method of disposing of the dead among the residents of the Chichuahuan Desert, including the lower Pecos region, was to drop the body down a vertical shaft cave or sinkhole (Aveleyra et al. 1956; Bement 1991; Turpin 1988, 1992; Turpin et al. 1986). The sinlSole deposits of Seminole Sink (41VV620) contained the remains of at least 21 individuals from the Early Archaic period. Numerous other caves and rock shelters have pro- duced internments; however, ". . . Seminole Sink produced the first cemeterylike burial population in the region" (Bement 1989:67). Additional verti- cal shaft caves with human remains have been identified since the excavation of Seminole Sink in 1984 (Bement 1989). As discussed earlier, to cultures that conceive of their universe as consisting of tiered cosmic regions, the "center" or axis mundi is the point of intersection where communication with the spirit world is made possible. Certain geographical fea- tures, such as caves and sinkholes, are associated with this "center" and are believed to be imbued with sacred power (Bassie-Sweet 1991; Heyden 1981; Schele and Freidel 1990). The use of verti- cal shaft caves as mortuary sites by Archaic Chichimecans was a means of returning their dead to the place of origin and the place where the ancestors now reside. In considering the elements of the primary motif discussed in this paper, the opening at the top of the serpentine arch is symbolic of the mouth of the sinkhole that served as the portal into the world below. The serpentine lines on each side of the portal represent the earth surrounding the opening, which is symbolic of the serpent that serves as the gateway to the spirit world. Conclusions Cultures such as the Maya and Aztec recorded their religious and secular events on folding screen books and ceramic vessels. These hand- drawn manuscripts, known as codices, contained information on such things as the birth of gods, prescriptions for ritual, mythologies, and their view of the world. The shelter walls of the lower Pecos region served as canvases on which Archaic peoples commemorated their cosmology. Technologically less advanced, these Archaic peoples utilized the blank pages provided by their environment as opposed to the bark paper or ceramic vessels of later generations. The use of shelter walls may well have been the first medium for codex depic- tion in which the shamanic journey into the world beyond was recorded. The conception of the universe consisting of tiered cosmic regions is a belief held by many cul- tures throughout Mesoamerica and the Gran Chichimeca. The shamanic art created by Archaic Chichimecans commemorates a similar cosmol- ogy. The elements common to both the motif of the lower Pecos and the cultures of Mesoamerica and the Gran Chichimeca indicate that the recur- ring Pecos River style motif identified in the spa-</page><page sequence="11">162 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lVol. 7, No. 2, 1996 tial analysis illustrates the journey taken by Archaic shamans into the Otherworld at least 4,000 years ago. The undulating lines identified in the lower Pecos motif represent the serpent as the earth's surface, which serves as the gateway to the world below. The hole depicted at the top of the serpentine arch is the sacred portal through which the soul of the shaman journeys during trance death into the Otherworld. The animals associated with the shaman Elgures can be inter- preted as the tutelary animals in which the shamans manifest themselves as they connect with the world beyond. The shamans are depicted in the skeletonized manner to indicate that this transformation is complete. The artists of the lower Pecos used picto- graphic art to translate their metaphysical concep- tion of the world and human existence into a concrete, representational form. The motif identi- Eled represents a key aspect of the cosmology of the Archaic residents of the lower Pecos region of southwest Texas and northern Mexico. These Archaic people, who lived at least 4,000 years ago, possessed a world view that was remarkably similar, and possibly ancestral, to that of many contemporary peoples throughout Mesoamerica and the Gran Chichimeca.
