<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES BECK Piero della Francesca at San Francesco in Arezzo: An Art-Historical Peregrination Introduction One might be tempted, and with justification, to throw up his hands in dismay when confronted with yet another treat- ment of Piero della Francesca's True Cross cycle, especially in light of the fact that we can expect an avalanche of new writing, following the recently completed restorations of the frescoes. It is not my intention here to comment upon that intervention, but I am obliged to make clear my deep disap- pointment and disillusion at the results as well as the extreme- ly authoritarian control over the work, the data, and the illus- trations exhibited by the authorities and the sponsor. That said, I pretend to exercise the inalienable right of every gener- ation to comment upon those extraordinary statements of the past, which constitute the columns of our visual culture. In connection with the publication of archival discoveries by Enzo Settesoldi and Giuseppe Centauro, I put together some observations about the frescoes which form the basis of this present article.1 In the new monograph hidden among a large number of unpublished documents related to the family Bacci, the patrons of the frescoes, a notice from a Catasto of 1457 was presented for the first time which decisively affects our knowledge of the history of Piero's frescoes. In fact, one can now say with considerable assurance that the work was begun not in 1452, as is widely assumed, or even before as is also suggested from time to time, but in 1457. In tax reports filed in Florence of that year Andrea del maestro Tommaso di Baccio lists as one of his creditors: "Maestro Piero di Benedetto di Borgho per mia parte tocha per di dipintura di la capela grande di San Francesco d'Arezzo, fiorini 30."2 Andrea along with two relatives had credited Piero della Francesca 90 florins, 1/3 of which was Andrea's responsibility. For reasons well argued by Centauro, this represents the first payment, for the lunettes, which he asserts were begun at this time. Because it was a credit and not an actual payment, the dating of 1457-8 for the beginning of the fresco cycle seems to me entirely justified. The post-dating of the inception of the cycle by at least five years after that commonly assumed, effectively undercuts many of the prestigious iconographic treatments offered over the past half century. It also demands a revaluation of the Pierfrancescan chronology and, consequently, issues of styl- istic evolution of the master. Neither of these vast, engaging issues with their implications are specifically the purpose of my presentation at this time, however. Instead, I am seeking a reading based primarily upon the visual evidence.3 In treating Piero della Francesca's cycle of the Story of the True Cross and his personal approach to the challenge of 51</page><page sequence="2">JAMES BECK these frescoes, indisputably among the most prestigious and admired in Western art, a variety of points of departure can and have been taken. Among the most favored methodologies is biographical in orientation. This is a popular avenue for approaching Renais- sance works of art in cases when the identity and lives of indi- vidual masters can be isolated. To be sure, this condition is rela- tively impossible for Medieval artists, due to lack of information and the absence of an historiography. For the Renaissance, it reflects an emphasis upon the role of the individual in the cre- ation of art, in contrast to other factors, like political conditions, social and economic considerations, broader movements in art, and so on. The biographic approach can be divided, especially for artists like Piero, Leonardo, and Michelangelo into sub-units: (a) personal biography including psycho-biography; (b) artistic biography, that is, the works he made; and (c) other activities and other interests, which in Piero's case include scientific, the- atrical and mathematical explorations. An alternative methodology emphasizes the objects them- selves for which, in some cases, the creating artist may never have been identified. The object exists and can be studied, analyzed, admired, and dissected as a cultural and historical document. The rigorous study of objects offers any number of subdivisions which can include (a) pure description, often an extremely challenging and at the same time highly rewarding activity because of its transference of a pictorial, that is to say, visual experience into a literary one; (b) formal analysis of the compositions, the design, the colors, as well as other factors; that is to say, the formal features of the work are placed under a microscope; (c) a stylistic or grammatical examination, which, in turn, can be regarded as encompassing three aspects: personal style, period style and an historical preroga- tive; (d) visual sources, which represent the effort on the part of art criticism to identify those visual stimuli upon which the artist was especially dependent for his own solutions. Part I: Personal Biographical Note In contrast to a large number of other great masters of the Italian Renaissance, Piero di Benedetto di Pietro, known as "della Francesca" - the person, that is, the man, the individ- ual - remains an elusive entity. His name was derived from that of his grandfather Pietro; Benedetto was the name of his father. Not totally unexpectedly, the very nature of the private Piero della Francesca, as with Giorgione, is totally undefined. This is in distinction to, say, Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael, whose personalities can be approached with some confidence. Was Piero pleasant or rude? Was he especially devoted to his family as Michelangelo was? He seems to have had an older brother, Marco di Benedetto, who acted on Piero's behalf from time to time. Marco, who is mentioned in the documents, died in 1487, five years before Piero.4 There was another brother, Antonio, along with Marco, as well as var- ious nephews. Antonio died in 1502. Was Piero generous to friends and pupils, among them Signorelli and Luca Pacioli? And what was his attitude towards women and marriage? Raphael appears to have been among the most gracious in his conduct, in contrast to Michelangelo who was (unfairly, I believe) regarded as 'terribile,' while Leonardo created an intimate circle of individuals who accom- panied him wherever he went. All three remained bachelors but Raphael considered marriage if he could obtain a large dowry, and Michelangelo pretended to be an expert, giving elaborate advice to his nephew about the qualities of women. What about Piero? Like the others mentioned he never mar- ried. At least there is no mention of a wife and children in his will, written in 1487. Did Piero seek financial and worldly success the way Raphael had done, or was he relatively disinterested in fame and fortune, a characteristic shared by both Masaccio and Donatello? Michelangelo became wealthy as an artist, and left a fortune to his nephew. Like Brunelleschi, Piero held local offices so he may have had a commitment to the community and perhaps a social conscience. We know that he was liter- ate, for after all he wrote several tracts, although he is not regarded as a Humanist, as Leon Battista was, and perhaps he should be. Piero had faith in the ownership of property, which he purchased from time to time in the area around Borgo, a pattern that will be repeated with a vengeance by Michel- angelo who also made more than a dozen investments of a similar nature. Piero even took on a commission in part for an exchange of land. At the time of his death, it is fair to say that Piero was well-to-do if not actually rich. Was he an esoteric, as some now claim, a precocious Neo-Platonist, which seems confirmed by his frequently appli- cation of the golden section, and the precision in which he measured proportions of the human body?5 Actually I am con- vinced that new studies now underway will give much more attention to this aspect of Piero's activity. Despite recognition he achieved during his lifetime, Piero's birth date remains a question mark, in contrast to Leonardo, for example, for whom we have documents not only regarding his (illegitimate) birth but the names of those pre- sent at his baptism in Vinci. For Michelangelo too, born in Caprese in the Casentino - far away from Florence, the city of his ancestors - we again not only have details, but his birth is even recorded in a horoscope. 52</page><page sequence="3">PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA AT SAN FRANCESCO IN AREZZO: AN ART-HISTORICAL PEREGRINATION In contrast, there is a vacuum in the documents for the year, not to say the month and day, of Piero's birth. In fact, a clear division among specialists has developed over the approximate date of his birth. Some have followed Vasari (1568), suggesting 1406, which is arrived at by taking what was thought to have been his age, 86 years, at the time of death which occurred in 1492.6 Longhi, followed by C. Ginzburg, C. Bertelli (1991) and A. Paolucci (1990), favors 1415, while P. de Vecchi (1967) takes 1420, and E. Battisti (1971) and Beck (1980, 1999), opt for 1420-22. Circa 1420 may be as close as we can get in light of the present state of infor- mation. This is arrived at by the fact that Piero's mother and father were married in 1416 (at least there was an exchange of the dowry in that year), and since Piero was apparently the third son, it seems impossible to place his birth much before 1418 or 1419. At any rate, documents also point to the fact that Piero was involved with a local painter named Antonio di Giovanni d'Anghiari who had a commission to paint a major altarpiece in San Francesco in Borgo (contract of 1430). The commission, for inexplicable reasons, was handed over to Sassetta in 1437, before any actual painting was begun by Antonio. Newly found documents place Piero with Antonio d'Anghiari as early as 1432.7 The painter from Anghiari at the time owed Benedetto, Piero's father, the rather substantial sum of 56 florins which included something for Piero's work. Already in the previous year, in June of 1431, a son of Benedetto di Pietro, no first name is specified, was mentioned as having painted the wooden bases of candlesticks for a local Confraternity. This is the first notice, in assoluta, for Piero's childhood, when he would have been something like 11 or 12 years old.8 We then find him, now mentioned by name, as an appren- tice or garzone in the shop of Antonio during the following year. With this data in mind, we can come a little closer to establishing Piero's birth date and some of the consequences. If in 1431 the "figliuolo" of Benedetto was not yet officially in a shop, probably he was too young by usual standards to have been so placed. That event occurred the following year, in the month of June. But how young was too young? The age at which a lad was placed in a master's shop varied during the Quattrocento from 10 to 13. On the basis of these supposi- tions, in addition to the other extant data, the year 1420 (and more specifically the month of June) results as the best guess of Piero's birth year given the present state of our data. There are issues which emerge from the recently revealed long relationship between Antonio d'Anghiari and Piero della Francesca, beginning in mid-1432 and continuing until the end of 1437, which amounts to a very substantial and crucial 5 1/2 years. A great deal of credit goes to James R. Banker, whose archival research on Borgo San Sepolcro has expanded our knowledge of the young Piero. One might raise, at least in passing, the larger question here regarding the rapport between teacher and pupil. Does a great master require having, per force, a great master as a teacher? Such was undoubtedly the case with Leonardo, whose maestro, Andrea Verrocchio, was a remarkable talent, or with Raphael whose teacher, Perugino, was the most respected painter in all of Italy during his heyday. The condi- tions can be reversed: there is good evidence to prove that great masters need not make great teachers. Consider the list of pupils of a Leonardo or a Michelangelo for a corroboration of the generalization. Actually a solid case may be presented for the situation in which a modest master could have encour- aged and set his pupils onto the path to fame. Cosimo Rosselli, hardly anyone's favorite painter, was so effective with a certain Piero that he became known as Piero di Cosimo, hav- ing taken on Rosselli's name. With Masaccio too, although the actual identity of his teacher is not certain, he may well have been, at least such is my best guess, Bicci di Lorenzo, a rather droll but highly popular master, who could have given the far more talented Tommaso di San Giovanni Valdarno the correct direction. Simply speaking, it is quite within the realm of possi- bility that Antonio d'Anghiari was a determining factor in Piero's development as an artist. On the other hand, one of the earliest, though not unam- biguous, references to Piero is found in a long poem by Giovanni Santi, Raphael's father, written while Piero was still alive. Giovanni actually had hosted Piero della Francesca in Urbino in 1469. The implication in the poem is that he was older than both Antonio (b. ca. 1431) and Piero Pollaiuolo (b. 1443) as well as Castagno (b. ca. 1419) which seems quite plausible. That he was older than Uccello (b. 1397) and Masaccio (b. 1401) is quite impossible, which probably signi- fies that Giovanni Santi either was not particularly interested in exact dates of birth, or was poorly informed about them. Another, still earlier reference is found in a tract by Filarete, composed in the mid-1460s, which indicates that Piero's repu- tation was already well-founded by then. This date coincides with the completion of the True Cross cycle, probably 1466. Placing Piero's birth year around 1420 would make him about 19 at the time he collaborated with Domenico Veneziano in Florence for the now destroyed frescoes at San Egidio, with payments dating from 1439 to the end of 1440. Notice the word "collaborated." One of the results of the new research of Banker and others is that Piero would have been too experi- enced (and in my view too old) to have continued to be an apprentice in 1439. Hence, we must suppose he was a collab- orator (but probably not an equal one) and that, as a bone fide 53</page><page sequence="4">JAMES BECK collaborator, he had a genuine role of relative independence. Under no circumstances should we regard him as a pupil of Domenico, though without a doubt Domenico's art was to have a decisive impact upon Piero as he searched for an inde- pendent personal style. How long did he remain associated with Domenico Veneziano? Since no convincing independent works can be confidently assigned to Piero until as late as 1450, one must ask what Piero was doing for that long decade of the 1440s, the period of his own twenties, a point I will return to shortly. To linger over Piero's date of birth might seem a pedantic concern, but when the assumptions among specialists vary by as much as ten years, from 1412 to 1422, the presumed early career becomes enshrouded in a thick haze. In distinction to his date of birth however, we do have the exact date of his death, 12 October 1492, the same year as that of Lorenzo il Magnifico and the very day which is celebrated for the discov- ery of America, as Paolucci (1990) has pointed out. It is also convenient for the sake of context to bear in mind that Leonardo da Vinci was then already 40 years old. There is solid evidence that he became blind in later life, although almost certainly this occurred after 1487 when he made some hand-written notes blocking out the details of his last will and testament. Obviously, blindness had an enormous impact upon his life and his art, making it impossible to date any work whatsoever after ca. 1488. More challenging for the critic is the possibility that his eyesight deteriorated slowly. Were this documentable, we might understand features of his later work that could reflect a declining visual condition, as is the case with Degas, for example. For the moment there is no evidence for fixing precisely when the blindness occurred nor have efforts been made to identify a visual crisis in his art. Part II: The Artist. Artistic Biography Vasari's life of Piero is a classic, and continues to the pre- sent day to retain its fascination as well as authority, even after 450 years. The author's prejudices, together with his larger view of fifteenth-century art as a prelude to the work of Raphael, Titian and Michelangelo, are effectively spelled out. Before examining what Vasari has to say about Piero and especially his treatment of the True Cross cycle which is, after all, this paper's purpose, it is imperative to keep in mind that Vasari was a native of Arezzo, the site of Piero's greatest accomplishment. And if Piero was not strictly speaking an Aretine, his origins from nearby Borgo San Sepolcro gave him a special attraction for Vasari's text, where a component of campanilismo is ever-present in the individual biographies. Simultaneously, Vasari operated with solid, first-hand informa- tion, at least to the extent possible concerning an artist born nearly 130 years before he composed the first edition of his Lives. By that time, the hard and fast data related to Piero's personality was so insufficient that the biographer by necessi- ty was required to interweave it with the indications gleaned from the art objects Piero created. Of course such a unification of the artist and his work was not limited to his life of Piero, for Vasari used it as a basic technique, one which has monopo- lized art historical and psychological biography ever since. This category of biographical interpretation - life and works - presupposes that by lining up the known biographical data alongside the various works in painting and fresco, a whole- some profile of the artist will emerge. Of course, in such an exer- cise the results inevitably produce a fiction. Indeed, the question arises as to whether we can gain insight into the makeup of any creative artist through his works and in the case of Piero, by and large, his works alone. Are we able to draw analogies between what is found in his art and what may have been his personal conduct, his ability to function with people, his relationships, that is, of a closer kind? Was Piero an aloof, measured, highly struc- tured individual in his daily life, as one might guess from the imagery? And what about his emotions? Were they so tightly structured that there was no room for whim or accident? Consider for an instant the two young people at the left edge of the Death of Adam (i.e. Adamites) fresco in Arezzo, a presentation without parallel in all of Renaissance art as an example of youthful beauty [Fig. 1]. The blond, wide-eyed, determined woman has her fulsome right breast exposed while the other remains hidden by her garment, which reveals a Classical Roman aura. She turns intently toward her coun- terpart, a muscular man shown in near profile (slightly turning to his mate, i.e. in profile perdu), virtually naked except for a cape knotted at the neck. They appear as lovers from a later epoch. I propose that they should be identified as Adam and Eve, before their expulsion from Paradise. Renzi describes them as a boy and a girl who look into each others eyes ("un ragazzo e una ragazza che si guardano negli occhi").9 Certainly they are not, as Aronberg-Lavin would have it, "two boys stand[ing] together in a kind of embrace."10 Their simi- larity also might be explained by Piero's use of models, pre- sumably all males, on the one hand, and his reliance upon Classical Greek and Roman prototypes on the other. Further confusing a determination of Piero's intention is the fact that this fresco in particular, and this segment specifically, has suf- fered from serious losses to the surface. In fact the situation had brought Kenneth Clark to propose that this group, surely a brilliant invention and passage, was executed by an assis- tant, a conclusion which should be vigorously rejected. 54</page><page sequence="5">PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA AT SAN FRANCESCO IN AREZZO: AN ART-HISTORICAL PEREGRINATION 1) Piero della Francesca, detail of &lt;&lt;Adam and Eve&gt;&gt;, from 5? 4 VSIn ((The Adamites?), Arezzo, San Francesco. And while on this delicious sub-theme of the fresco, one should be aware of similarities between the woman (Eve?) and the middle angel of the Baptism of Christ in the National Gallery in London. It should be recognized that in the Baptism Piero makes use of a very different set of proportions among the figures, the angels being substantially smaller than John the Baptist or Christ, who all occupy the same plane. The London painting is inevitably dated early in Piero's known 1~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~'.' .: ?

If, on the other hand, the connection between the Adamites and the Baptism holds up, then we should redate the London picture toward 1460 or after, as a result of the implications of the new docu- ments dating the Arezzo cycle. In fact, because the picture originally was the central part of a triptych, the side panels of which we know were painted by Matteo di Giovanni around the mid-1460s, it seems reasonable to assume that Piero's share was executed around that time, and not 15 or as many as 25 years earlier (i.e. Longhi). C. Gilbert (1977) is on firm ground when he dates the work to 1460 or later. Returning momentarily to the two young people, their emotive power spreads through the composition, in which the negative space which separates them is heavily charged in such a way that they cannot be separated. Does this represent Piero and his notions? I suggest it does. If the pair had been painted by Michelangelo instead of Piero della Francesca, psychological-minded writers might suggest that the bare breast is an allusion to his Settignanese wet nurse; if by Raphael, it could be considered a reference to his mother, who in distinction to Michelangelo's, nursed little Raffaellino (according to Vasari). But for Piero, who knows? One could claim that Piero found in his art a place to expli- cate a controlled, orderly existence, in distinction to his "real" life which had been without rigor. Paolucci (1990) describes Piero's temperament as "riflessivo e contemplativo" presum- ably on the basis of his paintings. He is known to have been dreadfully slow in carrying out his assignments, even in the face of legal requirements, and at times he was a decade or even two behind schedule. Conceivably, time was not a press- ing factor for the artist from San Sepolcro in his various encounters in Borgo, Arezzo, Rimini, Urbino and Ferrara, and presumably even in Rome. Time in his frescoes, in fact, seems arrested but not frozen, as if the narrative is unfolding before us in a calibrated, slow-motion, lethargic pantomime. Can anything at all be said about his sexual life, his "pref- erences," according to modern terminology? For Piero, no convenient dream to analyze has survived, nor ambiguous poems to dissect. Are there any clues in the work that could explicate Piero's sexuality? I have elsewhere speculated about Michelangelo, proposing that he was so taken with his mission as an artist that he put aside (or if you wish, sublimated) his sexuality.11 Was the same true of Piero della Francesca? As with many (most?) Italian artists of the Quattrocento, and increasingly for those of the subsequent century, Vasari's contribution has remained the basic text. To be sure, newer studies, especially those undertaken in the Nineteenth Century and based upon archival discoveries and the expan- sion of the factual knowledge surrounding the artist's oeuvre, 55</page><page sequence="6">JAMES BECK have necessitated modifications. What has typically hap- pened, however, has been that where new data and new doc- uments had been found, they were inserted into the vita of one or another artist as Vasari gave it. Consequently Vasari's text has persistently held sway, arguably more than it should have. Where there was a total absence of other information or cor- roboration, Vasari's assertions, however inventive, have con- tinued to be regarded as virtual truth. What can be reconstructed, and here too we are con- strained to speculate, is some sort of artistic itinerary. Piero was in Borgo, apparently without interruption, until the end of 1437. In January 1438, he is mentioned as being away. He was, the documents confirm, in Florence in September of 1439, where he was collaborating with Domenico Veneziano on frescoes for San Egidio. Whether or not he was already with Domenico the whole of 1438-in Perugia at least until 1 April-and in 1439 prior to the commission, is another matter, but one may assume so. Since all that is left of the San Egidio cycle is a narrow strip of fresco depicting feet and the ends of drapery together with some high-quality geometric decorations, it is virtually impossible to single out a specific, distinguishable role for Piero. A question already posed is, was he an assistant or a collaborator of Domenico's at this stage? To complicate a reconstruction of the situation, Domenico's career is no bet- ter documented than Piero's. I suppose we can assume that Piero was about ten years younger than Domenico, so that when at they started to work at San Egidio Piero was about 19, and that they shared a measure of compatibility. Domenico's surviving masterpiece was done in Florence for the high altar of the tiny church of Santa Lucia ai Magnoli, a pala of the highest quality which was accompanied by a set of five painted predella narratives. A completely undocument- ed work, I have reason to believe that it was done earlier than is usually believed and that the commission very possibly pre- dates the work at San Egidio (1439-1440), although its execu- tion might well have overlapped with, and continued on after, that of the frescoes. Hence a dating of the late 1430s can be proposed, with work continuing into the following decade. Were this the case, or even if the incarico was awarded to Domenico in the 1440s, the question can still be raised as to whether Piero had a share in the Saint Lucy altarpiece. As an internal mini-excursus, I propose here that Piero indeed had a material and definable share in painting the famous altarpiece. The central panel is located in the Uffizi while the five panel predella has been divided among several public collections, including arguably the finest, St. John the Baptist in the Desert, in Washington's National Gallery [Fig. 21]. While I plan to argue the issue in greater detail in a future publication, several points might be raised now. First, Domenico Veneziano (t1461) was a notoriously slow worker and his total output is remarkably small for an artist whose activity spanned over three decades. At the same time he was very highly regarded by the Medici and therefore was well positioned in Florence. Secondly, no documents have been discovered for the Saint Lucy Altarpiece, and a variety of dates have been proposed, placing it in the mid-1440's or later. Given his record, we might assume that Domenco took a long time to finish the altarpiece, which was made for the family of Niccolo da Uzzano, for which Donatello was said to have made a portrait (Florence, Bargello). Attention can be drawn to an unpublished document of 1425 which provides for "la pittura della tavola" in Santa Lucia in a will of this same Niccolo.12 If the commission began at the time of Domenico's presumed arrival in Florence (1438?) and possibly was the very purpose of coming to Florence, then its execution overlapped that of the San Egidio frescoes, although it may have dragged on after they were finished. Since we are sure that the two painters collaborated, can any portions of the St. LucyAltarpiece be specifically associat- ed with Piero? At least on a preliminary level, one would be hard-pressed to successfully isolate any portion of the main panel as Piero della Francesca's. Only John the Baptist can be considered as a possible candidate. Domenico seems to have moved ahead at his own sweet speed, producing, to be sure, one of the masterpieces of the early Renaissance. But what about the predellas? There is of course a problem with the his- tories of each of them, but given all of the imponderables, the scene with the young St. John in the Desert should be singled out as the one that is the least characteristic of Domenico Veneziano's style. At the same time the Washington panel which once belonged to Bernard Berenson is, in my view, the most Masaccesque of the entire altarpiece, in terms of the more saturated color, the decisive modeling of the body (a fig- ure which correctly has also been related to Donatello), and the proportions, with its powerful torso and heavy legs, ele- ments which find no echo in Domenico Veneziano's known work (except the adult Baptist mentioned above). The connec- tion with Masaccio is best observed in the Baptism of the Neophytes in the Brancacci Chapel, in terms of the youth, who despite the differences in size and scale appear to be a first cousin, if not actually John's physiognomic brother [Fig. 22]. Given this set of conditions, I propose that the younger Piero, in his early twenties, is the author of the highly admired paint- ing in Washington, and as such it is his earliest identified pic- ture. Among the other predellas, the only one that can also be brought into the same pattern of events is the Annunciation in 56</page><page sequence="7">PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA AT SAN FRANCESCO IN AREZZO: AN ART-HISTORICAL PEREGRINATION the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. It does not reveal as much of the flavor of Masaccio as does the St. John in the Desert; on the other hand, it could be regarded as more strict- ly Pierfrancescan. This fact may be explained by assuming that the Domenico represented here was influential on Piero. Consequently I am not at this time ready to take the next step and attribute to Piero the Annunciation, but neither am I ready to rule out the possibility. The impact of Domenico Veneziano on the later formation of Piero's personal style in Florence cannot be underestimated, however. Under any scenario, Piero had an affinity to the art of Domenico Veneziano and was highly sympathetic to his lan- guage, making Domenico one of the formative components of Piero's mature style. His use of a narrow range of high tonality and colors saturated with light are indicative of a keen aware- ness of Fra Angelico's art of the late 1430s and 1440s. It would be going a bit too far from the confirmable facts to speculate that both Piero and Domenico were at some point indepen- dent assistants to the Dominican frate during his work on the Deposition in San Marco. Were documents to surface to that affect, however, I would not be at all surprised. And if the rap- port between the two outsiders and the local master was not formal, still a measurable appreciation of Angelico, in contrast to Fra Filippo whose art would have been too contrived and anti-naturalistic, has to be included in Piero's artistic iter. The landscape and cityscape elements found in Fra Angelico in Florence during this period, but also in Cortona, which is not much of a trip from Borgo San Sepolcro anyway, must have been rewarding to the young Piero. The collaboration between Piero and Domenico seems to have had its final flowering when together they began execut- ing frescoes in the sacristy of Santa Maria of Loreto around 1444(?), but the work remained unfinished for decades. Piero had a major independent commission in Borgo in 1445, which effectively seems to have put an end to his collaboration with Domenico Veneziano. While nothing that I have implied about the nourishment which Piero may have obtained from Domenico Veneziano and Fra Angelico should be regarded as part of a potential minestrone that criticism might wish to concoct for him, anoth- er Florentine has to be mentioned for his formation Masaccio. Without stretching the logic, one can image that had the painter from San Giovanni Valdarno, who died when merely 26 following a truncated career, been reincarnated, he would have been Piero della Francesca. If there was a definable confluence between the art of Domenico Veneziano and Fra Angelico with that of the devel- oping Piero, then one might reasonably ask why neither one of the older masters received the prestigious commission for the choir of San Francesco in Arezzo. Perhaps the fact that Fra Angelico was a Dominican, and hence occupied with projects related to his order, could have precluded his selection. But the other reason to preclude Angelico, but not il Veneziano is that Fra Angelico died in 1455, and given the new documen- tary evidence that is being presented in this book, the contact for the completion of Bicci's frescoes was given out (to Piero) thereafter. The reason that Domenico may have been passed over could have been his age, as he was already well over fifty, and the fact that his reputation, which was mainly for panel pictures anyway, was that he was terribly slow. However, none of what has been presented above effec- tively explains what Piero della Francesca was doing in the 1440s, and that span must remain a puzzling episode, although by 1445 at least he seems to have been back in Borgo, where he obtained a commission for the polyptych of the Misericordia. The other aspects of Piero's life, his scientific interests, his books on mathematics and perspective need not be taken up at this time, any more than a re-creation of his later chronolo- gy, with the focus here being the Arezzo frescoes. Yet there can be no question that his panel pictures painted around the same time, especially the Flagellation (Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria, Urbino) and probably the Baptism, offer insights. These points must await a new monographic treatment of the artist, although on the whole one must still recommend Battisti's excellent study. Part III: The Frescoes of the True Cross at San Francesco in Arezzo The history of art as a discipline has traditionally concen- trated on specific aspects of the frescoes illustrating the legend of the True Cross in San Francesco in Arezzo. Among those given priority have been the questions surrounding the author- ship of diverse portions, that is, a division of hands or other- wise, connoisseurship. A favorite exercise has been to isolate the portions regarded by the sharp-eyed as painted by Piero himself, that is those by his own hand, unaided, from those presumably produced by his assistants. And as a sub-catego- ry, it has become a desideratum to determine which assistant or collaborator might have produced a given figure or particu- lar passage. This activity, though enormously challenging, should be regarded as outside the scope of the present essay and will therefore be largely ignored. Besides, in my view, the frescoes as a unity comprise such a unique example of Piero's creativity that even if one or another figure, head, bit of drapery, clumsy foot, or an ill-proportioned tree in the distance happens 57</page><page sequence="8">JAMES BECK to have been executed by a lad in the bottega or even a mature collaborator, the fact changes not at all the power of Piero's invention. Nor does it, I maintain, alter our notion of Piero as a practising artist. And the drill, admittedly in earlier days more popular than today, is made particularly precarious, under any circumstances, because of the poor condition of the ensemble as it has survived. The frescoes have suffered from excessive humidity as well as from various restorations and repaintings, including the most recent one, just completed. That Piero had assistants and followers is a forgone conclusion. For those who are especially taken with the division of "hands," the analyses of Longhi, Clark, Gilbert, Battisti and Paolucci should serve as an introduction to the issues. Another enterprise to which conventional studies have devoted considerable attention is that of identifying "sources" that Piero may have relied upon for both iconographical insights as well as the composition of individual scenes. The treatments of the subject by Agnolo Gaddi in Florence and Masolino in Empoli, and yet another cycle by Cenni di Francesco in Volterra, were undoubtedly available to him. We could readily concede that he may have been sent to see them all by his Franciscan patrons. One might even grant that there are visual insights here and there which he may have appro- priated from them. But Piero's artistic language was so totally different from these alleged prototypes, especially in terms of his artistic style and temperament, that meaningful parallels, at least ones which could produce new insights, can hardly be drawn. Take for example Piero's Dream of Constantine, which shows a cylindrical tent ending in a broad cone at the top, sup- ported by a pole in the center and opened at the middle like curtains to reveal the sleeping Emperor. Gaddi depicts a vaguely similar tent in the middle of a scene illustrating the Dream of Heraclius [Figs. 2 and 3]. The pose of Gaddi's sleep- ing figure with his raised head supported by his hand, for example, is so entirely Giottesque and the secondary figures are so thoroughly without correspondence in Piero, that even raising the issue of a meaningful dependence is superfluous. And even when compositions are circumstantially similar, as with the Adamites, Piero's conception is so thoroughly dif- ferent, with his emphasis upon the primacy of the actors - a feature totally absent from Gaddi - and a drastic reduction of the number of participants, that once again common sense tells us that a comparison is an empty exercise. If, on the other hand, one insists pursuing this direction, the reader would do well to refer to the more recent monographs for the subject, those of the authors already mentioned, as well as Aronberg Lavin and Bertelli. Another typical topos for Piero studies, one related to the category just mentioned, is the determination of "influences." 2) Piero della Francesca, (&lt;Dream of Constantine,,, Arezzo, San Francesco. 58 *?

For example it is, and with good reason, stressed that Piero, although more Umbrian than Tuscan by origin, was heavily dependent upon Florentine painting of the 1430s and 1440s, at a time when he was moving in and out of Florence, as sug- gested above. This Florentine component refers to, and I think correctly, the example of Fra Angelico in particular, but also Masaccio, especially in the Brancacci Chapel. Nor could Piero have failed to react to the explosion which was unfolding among the sculptors Donatello, Nanni di Banco, and Ghiberti. And with- out doubt, he could not have avoided adjusting his researches to the style of his long-time older colleague, Domenico Veneziano. Earlier still, as we have already seen, there seems also to be good reason to believe that his teacher, Antonio d'Anghiari, must have had, per force, an impact upon on his development. In the case of Antonio, his art is conveniently unknown, although we have to consider it to have been "provincial." The presence of Sassetta in Borgo San Sepolcro in the late 1430s had a role in calibrating the development of the youthful Piero, presumably when he came home from time to time. Once these components-Fra-angelicisms, Masaccesque insights, and the rest-have been identified, other factors are regularly brought into the concoction that art history is prone to brew when reconstructing stylistic sources. The principal among them is a frequently suggested role for Netherlandish 59 !</page><page sequence="10">JAMES BECK art, that is the power of the detail, the tight treatment of objects, the function of light in a restricted space, and the dis- tant landscapes. Whenever some sharply rendered detail in Piero's art is considered, such as the pearls and choker worn by Battista Sforza in her portrait (Florence, Uffizi), or Federico da Montefeltro's armour in the recently over-cleaned Brera Altarpiece (Milan, Brera), a Flemish influence is inevitably pro- posed. That Piero would have been blind to the existence of Flemish art is, of course, unthinkable. And we are reminded of the spread of works of this kind, and the attention the Medici paid to them. Scholars and experts are similarly inclined to triumphantly report that Piero's rendition of architecture in his paintings owes a great deal to Leon Battista Alberti. If it did not, we would have to imagine him to be particularly droll. He is inevitably dubbed a devoted Albertian, and maybe he really was. But when one lines up the buildings he created in his paintings with Alberti's inventions, Piero's architecture is more ideal and more imagined than an (mere) adaptation of any built structures. Besides, Piero was also something of an architect in his own right, having designed his own palazzo and perhaps others as well. Another conventional area of critical comment, one that offers the demonstration of Latin erudition, has been the pre- sumed influence of Classical, mainly Roman, art on Piero della Francesca. Since Piero went to Rome in 1458 where he worked in the Vatican, a marked distinction has been formulat- ed in his development: "before Rome" and "after Rome." Before Rome, he is regarded as much more "Florentine," to the point that even poor Bicci di Lorenzo's art could have spo- ken to him, and as more empirical; after Rome he is thought to have undergone a transformation becoming more Classical, even Hellenistic. This stylistic divide has been used to help date his works, including portions of the True Cross cycle, with more "classical" compositions and treatments regarded as post-Rome. This approach to Piero is similar to one applied to other artists, including Donatello before Piero, and Raphael after him. It has built-in hazards, however, because by the time Piero is documented as having gone to Rome, he was a fully mature artist, about 38 years old. Besides, before 1458 he was well-travelled not only within Florence and Tuscany, but also in the Marches and must have seen Roman sculpture all over the place. And could he have failed to look at the sarcophagus in nearby Cortona which is said to have made such a strong impression on Filippo Brunelleschi? Piero was a keen obser- ver of the new art unfolding in Florence which had its own classical-revival component, anyway. It is quite unnecessary to assume that his Roman stay created a revolution in his lan- guage. If anything, Rome in 1458 (that is, if he had not visited the Eternal City before) would have acted as a confirmation of a direction upon which he and his contemporaries had already embarked. With these reservations set forth, I suppose it can be diverting to seek specific Greco-Roman objects which Piero may have appropriated for his pictures, as Bertelli inter alia appears to relish from time to time. But the question should be posed, one related to that raised for "influences": what do we learn from such time-honored speculations? After all, the clas- sical works he could have known were more often than not fragments, and what Piero saw in them was what he wanted to see or needed to see, anyway. The collection of "sources" for Piero is, in any case, outside the parameters of the present essay and will only be alluded in passing and when it is deemed meaningful for a broader understanding of his art. One of the unavoidable challenges raised by Piero's True Cross frescoes, one which will occupy the remainder of this essay, is an effort at a determination of precisely how to approach the cycle, and specifically, how to look at it. While it would be attractive to try to image how Piero's contemporaries and specifically the donors approached the chapel, such may be too much to ask. We must, instead, settle for functioning as the modern observers we are. Traditionally the overwhelming choice has been to follow the story chronologically, to the extent that it is possible, beginning on the upper right with the lunette of the Adamites, regarded, I believe correctly, as the earliest scene, and work- ing one's way to the historically most recent narrative, the Exaltation of the Cross, which is found in the opposite lunette. They are the Alpha and Omega. If these two seem to function within the system, none of the intervening scenes do, a factor which has caused immense difficulties, calling forth intricate and esoteric inter- pretations as well as daring explanations. Since these propos- als are readily available in the standard monographs on the artist and the cycle, it seems superfluous to summarize them here. Instead it is more becoming to offer an alternative read- ing, one which is disassociated from the chronological straight jacket either of the story or even the possible chronol- ogy of the painting. At the same time, an advantage accrues by beginning at the beginning, with the Adamites (but not end- ing at the end, as it were, which could cause distress). The proposal offered here is simple enough. We should confront the frescoes zone by zone, horizontally, beginning at the uppermost one-the lunettes just mentioned-and then moving downwards. This approach coincides generally with the order in which they were painted, presuming that Piero fol- lowed the usual approach of working from the top down, as is 60</page><page sequence="11">PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA AT SAN FRANCESCO IN AREZZO: AN ART-HISTORICAL PEREGRINATION often supposed, by using the scaffolding for each zone before going down another level. (One could also postulate that he painted, yes, from top to bottom, but one side, including the adjacent section on the altar wall, at a time, before moving to the other side of the chapel.) Additionally, one must also deter- mine in what direction to proceed not only from scene to scene, but within the scenes, from right to left, from left to right, or from the center outward. Moreover, the individual scenes need to be read as separate entities, as independent units within a structured whole. A further step is required, a determination of the relationships between the individual scenes within the cycle, especially, but not exclusively, their opposites, along with those scenes nearby, above, below, or to the side. TOP ZONE The Adamites As a test to the working method, and to begin at the begin- ning, let us examine the Adamites, located on the topmost zone of the right wall [Fig. 4]. I have already had reason to refer to this scene, with regard to the two "ragazzi" or "lovers," from the left corner, who I have identified as Adam and Eve before the Fall. The reading of this pointed (i.e. still "gothic") lunette has a subtlety which is not readily perceived. While the composition can be apprehended as centrally-oriented, with the middle field devoted to the deceased first parent, a second virtually central axis is constituted by the trunk of the tree, found slightly to the right of the gesticulating woman, out of which the True Cross will be constructed. The dead Adam's bare foot is up against the tree trunk, just as those of the second Adam, that is Jesus, will be ham- mered onto a cross made from the same wood. We have here a situation in which there is, in effect, a sliding central axis: one that is truly central, and the other one drifted off slightly to the right. What is Piero's purpose with this device, one that has an analogy in Leonardo's Madonna of the Rocks (Paris, Louvre) probably executed some three decades later? [Fig. 5] The five figures on the right - old sick Adam, an ancient, hag- gard Eve, Seth, and two others - function as a group as a pre- lude to the death of Adam, as well as an introduction to the entire chapel. The eye of the viewer from the floor below is attracted by the nude man leaning on a shepherd's staff (I sug- gest that this figure is Abel) seen from behind, a rare if not unique representation of such a figure in the mid- Quattrocento. The body is illuminated from the left, in accor- dance with the actual source of light (in distinction to the pictorial sources) for the chapel, producing a convincing projection. Next to this group is a break in the relief-like arrangement of figures located on the first plane, where Seth, himself 800 years old, appears for a second time in the scene as he approaches the Archangel Michael. Not only does their diminutive size imply distance, but the clouds, rendered as foreshortened, also lead the eye to the miniaturized pair, in what might be regarded as the second incident of the fresco. The third incident, which occupies the largest area, is cen- tral to the legend of the True Cross. The dead Adam is laid out obliquely on the ground (hardly a "funeral," as Aronberg Lavin would have it) surrounded on three sides as in representations of the Lamentation of Christ, framed by two persons arriving from opposite directions. Here the branch (or root) is planted in Adam's mouth by Seth. The placement of Adam serves to slow down the reading across the surface to allow the viewer to ponder the event depicted. The fourth incident is constituted by the two lovers deeply absorbed with one another. Formally the young man turns to his right, presenting a profile perdu, as on the opposite side of the composition old Eve, depicted like the Cumean Sibyl whom Michelangelo will illustrate half a century later, turns to the left to circumscribe the narrative. Undoubtedly time and its passage is a sub-theme, and it is emphasized by the realization that the tree in the near back- ground, filling much of the painting's upper section, is that of the wood, and it has grown before our eyes, as it were, from a branch to a vast tree. In fact, one should consider the tree, with its branches and leaves, now largely missing, as the fifth separate 'incident' in the scene. Within the whole, the viewer is asked to read the picture from right to left, from old Eve to young Adam across the pic- ture plane.13 Even here within a single, unified and highly con- templated space, time is understood as not strictly chronolog- ical or sequential and is an essential player. The earliest event would be Adam and Eve at left (if my characterization is cor- rect), then one is asked to move back to the extreme right with the family surrounding sick, old Adam. Chronologically, the scene of Seth and the Archangel follows, and then the dead Adam in the center. Since within an individual scene there is no special adher- ence to biblical chronology, need we anticipate such a pattern in the conception of the whole cycle? In other words, a non- chronological plotting of events should not be unexpected within individual scenes or within the whole cycle. The way Piero conceives of the passage of time is worthy of a comment, because it reflects his interpretation of one of life's most pressing factors. He is quite able to render age 61</page><page sequence="12">JAMES BECK 4) Piero della Francesca, (&lt;The Adamites,, Arezzo, San Francesco. without prettification, for his characters from Genesis are por- trayed with the disintegration attached to aging. Eve on the right has drooping, pendulous breasts and her face is that of an old woman. Here Adam and Eve are every man and every woman, who are subject to the ravages of time, and who necessitate the Crucifixion, quite the same as Masaccio's skeleton of Adam beneath the Trinity (Florence, Santa Maria Novella). Pictorially, Piero intuits what Leonardo and Alberti write, namely that the juxtaposition of young and old brings out dra- matically the characteristics of each. The beautiful youths on the left will become, in their time, old. Piero is also highly con- scious of the power of gesture, which he employs with proper restraint. Compositionally, the slipping axis, I suggest, func- tions to move the spectator into the main incident of the scene. The oblique placement of Adam, in fact, has its coun- 62</page><page sequence="13">PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA AT SAN FRANCESCO IN AREZZO: AN ART-HISTORICAL PEREGRINATION terpart in the Exaltation of the Cross on the opposite wall [Fig. 6]. Exaltation of the Cross One should not be surprised to find parallels of concep- tion between the Exaltation and its opposite, leaving aside questions of color. To be sure, due to the poor condition of the frescoes, centuries of deterioration, chemical changes of color and abusive restorations, an accurate determination of the coloristic qualities is virtually impossible. Given this situation, a discussion of the color needs to be postponed until our abil- ity to reconstruct the original color has greatly improved, if it ever will.14 The Exaltation of the Cross should be read from right to left, beginning near the altar and in effect continuing the direc- tion initiated by the Adamites scene, and presumably found in the intervening wall frescoes, which will be considered shortly. Once again the main action unfolds on the front plane with the figures lined up in a frieze-like distribution across the picture. The reading begins again at the right, with the standing figure of the black-bearded man in profile who appears to be in the process of tilting his tall hat. The entry function of this figure is emphasized by the foreshortened walls of Jerusalem to his right, which underscore his role, as does the hoary old man in the middle distance approaching the scene. He, in fact, together with the walls, constitutes the first incident, while the standing man together with the group kneeling in front of the Cross comprise the second incident. The third group is dominated by the barefoot Emperor Heraclius who holds the Cross, which is turned obliquely in space, corresponding, at least in terms of function, to the body of Adam in the scene on the opposite wall. The way in which the Cross is located in space serves to make it visible to the viewer below. If the Cross were shown purely at a right angle to the picture plane, as the figure of Heraclius is, it could not be perceived at all from below. As is quite evident, this part of the fresco has suffered a good deal over time. At the extreme left, two figures, the one at the corner in profile and his neigh- bor turning towards him, are engaged in conversation; com- positionally they function like the two lovers of the Adamites, and together constitute the fourth incident. The two trees con- stitute still another element of this representation, a fifth inci- dent. The composition of the Exaltation has been regarded as old-fashioned, and some art scholars have even speculated that it might be based upon a hypothetical sinopia left by Bicci di Lorenzo, which Piero would have adopted. This sophisticat- ed but far-fetched theory has a strong echo in the art-historical 5) Leonardo da Vinci, &lt;&lt;Madonna of the Rocks,, Paris, Louvre. literature, which also tends to isolate considerable collabora- tion for the execution as well. However, both the refinements alluded to, as well as the correspondence with the Adamites, makes an arbitrary division quite impossible. The central zone of the fresco, which is void of figuration, seems to separate the Emperor, accompanied by the Cardinal, from the inhabitants of 63</page><page sequence="14">JAMES BECK 6) Piero della Francesca, c(Exaltation of the Cross,,, Arezzo, San Francesco. Jerusalem. Such a formulation, that is of leaving the center absent of representation, is characteristic of Piero but hardly of a Bicci di Lorenzo or a Masolino, his presumptive "sources." Piero was an artist who had no compunction about reusing his own inventions, or reusing cartoons, as has been commonly recognised. In this fresco the same template has been employed for the heads of the man on the extreme left, the Cardinal in the center, and the standing man on the right. On the other hand in these instances Piero alters certain characteristics slightly, such as the slope of the nose, the kind of beard, and in the case of the standing figure on the right, the pureness of the profile is slightly shifted, so that we see a bit of his right brow. Even more rigorously, as has been observed by previous writ- ers, he reused the heads of the three women who accompany the Queen of Sheba, as well as the Queen herself, in reverse, for the figures to the right of King Solomon in the scenes depicting 64 ldu * * .r' -" .. 14-- Jr? r. i? ?- -? ? ;* s a *? a i.. i ???? 1.,? ?1 ;? *?'? -cl rb?'JB tl''-'-*LI u</page><page sequence="15">PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA AT SAN FRANCESCO IN AREZZO: AN ART-HISTORICAL PEREGRINATION 44.U ,~i i~ 4 l b 7) Piero della Francesca, detail of &lt;&lt;Queen and Attendants,, from &lt;&lt;Worship of the Wood,, Arezzo, San Francesco. the Worship of the Wood and the Meeting of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba [Figs. 7 and 8]. This system of recycling is prob- ably as old as the employment of cartoons in the first place, as if it is one of the built-in advantages of the process of fresco paint- ing. Can it also be regarded as a sign of shallowness or lack of imagination on Piero's part? Hardly. I believe it is a clue to Piero's artistic sensibility. He is not terribly interested in an infini- ty of figural and facial types, nor in the psychological interpreta- tions of individuals. Instead he sees the value of repetition, as in music, as well as the potentialities of creating a familiar type which he then manipulates. The familiarity gives the viewer con- fidence, which the artist is able to manipulate to his own goals. The Prophets An obstacle arises concerning the reading of the frescoes in horizontal levels when taking into account the smaller scale altar wall frescoes. Should the figures identified as Prophets, if indeed they are Prophets, be read as integral to the top zone? The so-called Jeremiah on the right bears a scroll that may or may not have once had a corresponding inscription, though it is now blank [Fig. 9]. The figure stands flatfooted and participates in the same overall lighting as does the Adamites. Perhaps a nod to the question of attribution can parenthetically be offered, and although both Prophets 8) Piero della Francesca, detail of &lt;&lt;Queen and Attendants,, from &lt;&lt;Meeting of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba,,, Arezzo, San Francesco. appear to be invented by Piero, the Jeremiah (?) has stronger claims for Piero's direct execution.. On the other hand both have suffered considerably and have undergone ample restoration already in the nineteenth century. The opposite figure, Daniel (?), is more harshly drawn, with heavier outlin- ing of the eyes, mouth, and locks of hair than is expected from pure Piero [Fig. 10]. One might sustain that Jeremiah (?) looks back to the Adamites, or at least in the direction of the scene, and that such a glance and turn of the head helps to continue the read- ing across the altar wall. Daniel (?) not only looks across the wall towards his companion, but his outstretched, rather large left hand gestures toward Jeremiah (?). Both share a low hori- zon, which is also the case for the scenes of the side walls. It is fair to conclude that if there is an harmonious, coherent reading of this top zone, the Prophets do not overly empha- size it, although they do not operate in opposition. MIDDLE ZONE Invention of the Cross Approaching the middle zone should begin by simply dropping down immediately from the Exaltation, at the point 65 .I f *"'</page><page sequence="16">JAMES BECK ~~k~~4- K ~~~'?- IP jix ~ 10) Piero della Francesca, (&lt;Daniel) (?), Arezzo, San Francesco. 9) Piero della Francesca, &lt;&lt;Jeremiah&gt;, (?), Arezzo, San Francesco. where it ends at the left corner, and beginning with the fresco found there: the Invention of the Cross (i.e. Finding and Proving of the Cross) [Fig. 11]. The Invention combines episodes of the finding and the proving of the True Cross and may be understood to contain five separate units or inci- dents, of the nature already described. A movement across the fresco from left to right is necessitated by the arrange- ment of the figures and position of the three crosses, the two "false" ones, that is, pertaining to the thieves, and the third, the True Cross, the miraculous one. Despite the noticeable losses on the surface of this scene, we can assume with con- fidence that crowned Queen Helena, shown in profile with her train, including a cardinal, constitutes the point of visual entry. Helena is also accompanied by a bearded dwarf sporting a magnificent hat, making one think of Mantua where 66</page><page sequence="17">PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA AT SAN FRANCESCO IN AREZZO: AN ART-HISTORICAL PEREGRINATION 11) Piero della Francesca, ((Invention of the Cross&gt; (&lt;&lt;Finding and Proving of the Cross&gt;&gt;), Arezzo, San Francesco. a colony of such individuals were quartered within the Gonzaga palace. And it is appropriate to bring up the name of the court artist there (after about 1460), Andrea Mantegna, not only because of the dwarf, a subject he developed, but also because of another figure, the bearded man who is sup- porting one of the crosses. Standing deep down in a hole, the man seems to rise upwards from below onto the main field, in a system similar to that found in a predella illustrating (coincidentally) the Crucifixion (Paris, Louvre) from Mantegna's San Zeno Altarpiece, a work of major propor- tions produced in Verona about the same time that Piero was beginning to paint the Arezzo cycle. Mantegna, on his part, had already finished his share of the trailblazing frescoes in the Eremitani in Padua (1452-57), largely destroyed in the last century during World War II, which revealed echoes of Piero's lost Ferrara frescoes. Linking Piero with Mantegna is hardly a new idea in art criticism. However, the presumed exchange between the two provides an implication that Piero, during his earlier years, had been present in the Veneto, in Verona, Padua, and possibly in Mantua, along with his known stays in Ferrara and Rimini. Piero and Andrea Mantegna, who was a decade or so younger than Piero but who was far more precocious while very young, were unofficial competitors and certainly representative of the finest products of their generation. The historical reputations of both have been diminished by severe losses of major cycles, as well as drastic restorations. Leonardo found himself in the same role when he arrived in Milan in the 1480s, for Mantegna was surely the most highly esteemed painter in Northern Italy at the time. Like many of its counterparts, the Invention is divided nearly in half with the central section devoid of figuration, exposing instead a fragment of landscape. St. Helena, the principal actor, is represented on each side of the composi- tion, in both cases in profile and facing to the right. In her first appearance she provides the spectator with a directional indi- 67</page><page sequence="18">JAMES BECK V 1 ~ ajA j~~~ ,~?n9;f.l*r? ?~ ~??-- ??~; ??.?.4strnd6t 12) Piero della Francesca, &lt;&lt;Flagellation&gt;, Urbino, Galleria Nazionale delle Marche. cation for reading the scene, already implied by the mode in which the crosses are distributed. The horizontal bar of the first cross on the left, while slight- ly tilted off the vertical axis, operates like a finger pointing toward the right. It almost touches the crossbar of the neigh- boring cross, but unlike the first one, the second is located obliquely in space. Its foreshortened horizontal bar functions very much like the Cross in the scene of the Exaltation, name- ly, to encourage a resting place, a pause, in the movement across the front plane. The activity on the left side unfolds with partial independence, with its bracket-like figural disposition, enclosed by the bearded man leaning on a shovel and turning back in the direction of St. Helena. The head of the dwarf and the excavator are probably based upon the same cartoon, which is a favored profile perdu, in contrast the main figure, St. Helena. The man to her right, dressed in white with a maroon hat is nearly frontal. This juxtaposition is repeated with Helena and the man balancing the Cross on the other side of the composition. On the right side of the scene is the second incident, in which the True Cross miraculously identifies itself. Here the fig- ural group is also dominated by Helena, who is worshipping the relic she has so assiduously sought. The group of four women with Helena constitute a separate unit, while the resur- rected youth, with a woman seen from behind and a man 13) Piero della Francesca, &lt;&lt;Raising of Judas from the Well,,, Arezzo, San Francesco. 68</page><page sequence="19">PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA AT SAN FRANCESCO IN AREZZO: AN ART-HISTORICAL PEREGRINATION kneeling reverently (who may be his grateful parents), are yet another. The diagonal thrust of the Cross is spatially more com- plex than the others, providing a directional movement toward the right, emphasized by the cross bar which in this case becomes an insistent horizontal thrust at the level of the next incident, constituted by the three bystanders in fanciful hats. This, the third segment or incident of the fresco, is framed by the side of the grey building together with the building next to it, both located obliquely to the picture plane; they bring us back to the main field of the composition. The three figures in this area are not readily identified in terms of the Golden Legend, but instead have a purpose similar to the three unfor- gettable men on the right side of the Flagellation (Urbino, Galleria Nazionale delle Marche) [Fig. 12]. In both cases, the three appear disinterested in one another. In Arezzo they are witnesses to the miracle nearby, and the congruent figures in the Urbino painting, I suggest, serve that function as well. It has been frequently observed by connoisseurship-ori- ented art historians that the quality of some of the figural pas- sages in the Finding and Proving of the Cross are not up to Piero's standards and are the result of the intervention of assistants. The four women with Helena are often singled out in this respect. Helena's features are similar to those of the Queen of Sheba on the opposite wall, and presumably are based upon the same design: their function in the narrative must have also been seen as analogous by the artist. The dominant Renaissance fagade of the temple/church behind the action is so unique that it should be regarded as an incident all to itself, especially in visual terms. Piero loosely frames the figures in front of it within its pseudo-arcade on the lowest level, but without being overly insistent. In conse- quence, the building retains a presence and unity independent of the narrative. Criticism automatically attaches the building to the ideas found in Leon Battista Alberti, but this forced parallel should be regarded with skepticism. There are no indications of a "temple front" with convincingly stated or implied columns, much less pilasters with accompanying capitals, which would be essential for Albertian conception. Besides, the matched coloristic qualities on the scale found here are equally un- Albertian; instead they are essentially pictorial. The same can be said of the fictive balls which float within the two circular decorations on either side. This fagade, it seems to me, is a pure Piero della Francescan fantasy with its exceptionally heavy pediment, presumably an element based upon ancient Roman examples. Much the same may be advocated for the finely wrought string course which separates this scene from the one above it as well as the one beneath. Even assuming a good deal of repainting over the centuries, Piero gives a framework of his own design to the entire cycle. The fifth incident is the often-reproduced view of Arezzo- Jersusalem on the upper left, with the Church of San Francesco in a dominant position. Its spare medieval fa(ade contrasts with the highly modern one in the main field. One easily can imagine that the public of his day while viewing this "portrait" of the city sought to pick out the identifiable struc- tures, much as one does in a group portrait of family mem- bers. There seems to be little doubt that this element was given a prominent role in the painting. In terms of the rhythm of the composition, the movement continues to lead from left to right and the three figures form a convincing "end;" and if the proposed reading is correct, they are back-to-back to the scene on the altar wall, the Raising of Judas from the Well [Fig. 13]. Raising of Judas from the Well The visual entry into the Raising of Judas is neatly provid- ed by the sharply foreshortened building on the left, a robust structure with bugnato stones at the corner, a heavily project- ing roof, and the ever-present wooden rod on metal hooks which reiterates the angular placement of the building with respect to the picture plane.15 Critics have paid little attention to this scene, by and large determined with some exaggera- tion to point out that the execution must have been by an assistant, perhaps Giovanni da Piamonte, although it is gener- ally agreed that it was designed by Piero. The wooden tripod which forms an off-center truncated triangle has a barely visi- ble pulley.16 An attached rope, which accentuates the central axis, serves to raise Judas from the well after he reveals the location of the Cross. The discomforted Judas, whose hair is symbolically also being pulled by an attendant, is portrayed as a handsome man with a full head of hair who turns slightly upwards and to the right, generally in the direction of the scene on the other side of the altar. He looks remarkably like Vasari's portrait of Piero published in the Vite, and it would have been a witty touch indeed to see Piero painting himself in this guise [Figs. 14 and 15]17. One of the more upsetting aspects of this scene as it has come down to us is that the clouds which should, logic requires, be part of the distant sky, are shown in front of the wooden supports of the tripod.18 This fact is so disconcerting that in a diagrammatic reconstruction they are drawn behind them (cf. G. Centauro, 1990). Since the right side in particular of the Raising of Judas has undergone severe losses, adjust- ments, and repainting, it seems at least possible to think that these clouds were painted during a distant restoration, espe- cially because they overlap the wood still visible beneath them. 69</page><page sequence="20">JAMES BECK 14) Piero della Francesca, detail of (&lt;Judas,) from ((Raising of Judas from the Well,,, Arezzo, San Francesco. The Burial of the Wood The Burial of the Wood, a more distinctive depiction than the Judas, one which vividly recalls "Christ Carrying the Cross," occupies the opposite side of the altar wall [Fig. 16]. Representing the burial of the wood which will become that of the True Cross, three men struggle with the broad plank. The natural grain of the wood, as has been widely noted, creates 15) Portrait of Piero della Francesca, from 1568 edition of Vasari's Vite. a halo for the central figure, who is here a simple workman, but analogous to Christ as a type. The almond-shaped pattern repeated down the middle of the board, revealing Piero's demand for order, is not found in nature as such. The highly regularized pattern which Piero has imposed upon a natural phenomenon is an excellent example of his mode of imposing his own demands upon the physical world. One would be hard put to find a similar repetitive, orderly system on a wood plank. Instead it represents Piero's logic, his need for order and 70</page><page sequence="21">PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA AT SAN FRANCESCO IN AREZZO: AN ART-HISTORICAL PEREGRINATION structure. The identical procedure is found in the treatment of heads throughout the cycle, which are forced into a egg- shaped pattern, so that everyone in the world appears to belong to the same family. Instead of the city views as in the previous scene, here we find a bare landscape (at least in its present state) with a hill in the left background, an oblique reference to Calvary, if indeed the subject can be understood as implicating the Carrying of the Cross. This scene reveals greater pictorial bravura than its companion, with an increased dramatic handling of the drap- ery and the flesh. Piero reused the cartoon for the left foot of the Christ-like man with pale maroon hose for the left foot of the second fig- ure as well. This man holds a pole with both hands, in an action which escapes interpretation. The third man, who is standing almost upright, is expending all his strength to sup- port the wood. The movement of the figures is from right to left, but the strong diagonal formed by the dominating plank brings us back to the right, leading to the next scene on the side wall. In an unexpectedly and uncharacteristically realistic and, at the same time, capricious touch, one testicle of the central figure is exposed, a rare pictorial device for the period. Stories of the Queen of Sheba and Solomon 16) Piero della Francesca, &lt;&lt;Burial of the Wood&gt;&gt;, Arezzo, San Francesco. While the two narrow scenes on the same zone of the altar wall are single narratives, the Stories of the Queen of Sheba and Solomon (Worship of the Wood and the Meeting of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba) once again repeat the imposition of multiple incidents [Fig. 17]. This scene connects with the one next to it, as has been anticipated, by the diago- nally placed board, but also by the conception of similar low hills in the background. Parenthetically, it is quite likely that they were dotted with trees and vegetation painted in tempera or fresco secco which have disappeared over the centuries. A suggestion of how these hills might have looked originally can be obtained from the treatment of the landscape backgrounds of the Montefeltro Portraits (Florence, Uffizi). Among of the most admired inventions in Renaissance painting, a worthy rival of Masaccio's Tribute Money (Florence, Santa Maria del Carmine, Brancacci Chapel), the picture is divided into nearly equal halves with the center devoid of fig- ures. Often related compositionally to Piero's horizontally-ori- ented Flagellation, of uncertain date and confounding mean- ing, the Stories of the Queen of Sheba and Solomon is totally satisfying, in that it offers everything which a Renaissance pic- ture can offer: males and females, landscape, interior and exterior architecture, animals (i.e. the horses) and even the implication of still life in the rendering of, for example, the cap- 71</page><page sequence="22">JAMES BECK 17) Piero della Francesca, &lt;Stories of the Queen of Sheba and Solomon&gt; ((&lt;Worship of the Wood. and the (&lt;Meeting of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba))), Arezzo, San Francesco. itals of the majestic columns. To this variety, one should add a hearty element of the exotic: the costumes, for example, such as the one worn by King Solomon (largely repainted), the fanciful headdresses, and even an African woman located in a distant plane between the horses and the Queen's train on the left. The composition is divided into three clearly separable incidents and the two highly independent trees in the middle ground. The first on the left seems to represent the caravan of the Queen of Sheba with two rather simple attendants and four horses-a white one seen from behind, the head and legs of a black one with its mouth open, a grey horse held by the man in the white hat, and yet another revealed only from the eyes up. This last device, that of fragmented views, is found time and time again in Piero at Arezzo. A slice of a person's head, like the one peering out between the majestic standing woman in profile over the shoulder of the woman shown in full front next to the kneeling Queen, is an example. Such an inclusion adds unpredictability and mystery to the scene, engaging the viewer's imagination, as does the peering eye of a man on the other side of the composition, next to the man in red shown in profile, arguably a portrait of one of the Bacci patrons.19 In proportion, they are small, being located on the second plane, slightly behind the first where the main figures are found, but nonetheless they effectively serve to introduce the momen- tous events. Even further in the distance standing low on the horizon is the African woman, still smaller in proportion because of her spatial location. At the same time her position, in profile and facing right, is repeated by the more grandiose figure next to her on the front plane. Arguably one might wish to consider her a unit or incident all by herself, although the meaning of her role has yet to be unraveled. The next section reveals the Queen praying in the pres- ence of a huge foreshortened block of wood, also with its grainy pattern clearly rendered; she realizes that the wood will become the True Cross. The light is conceived as coming from the real window, that is, from the left, and the Queen of Sheba's shadow falls on the block. Her delicate oval head on her sloping, long neck is in sharp profile and is highlighted, as are her clasped hands. Beside her, the wall has suffered 72</page><page sequence="23">PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA AT SAN FRANCESCO IN AREZZO: AN ART-HISTORICAL PEREGRINATION a severe vertical crack which has been repaired, but miracu- lously it has not affected the figural portions of the scene. The Queen's six maids of honor are disposed behind her, and as has been mentioned above, we find that Piero reused the design of the heads and necks of at least two of them, as well as the Queen's, by reversing the cartoons on the opposite side of the composition. The disposition of the group is worth ponder- ing, as it is a clear demonstration of Piero's language. He seems to enjoy the juxtaposition of the profile heads of the two standing women along with that of the Queen, with the blatantly frontal head of the woman nearest to her. The other three heads in the group are disposed in differing positions, one in near profile, another in near front view, and the third, barely visible. Thus with this section, a certain stability and predictability is established by the three profiles, which are interspersed with less orderly inter- ruptions, functioning like a complex line of music. The colonnade separates this incident from the next, the actual meeting of Solomon and the Queen beneath a portico. The columns are also lighted from the left, and their deep channels accentuate an anthropomorphic potentiality. Any sensible reconstruction of the building as "real" architecture is destined to failure, yet its classicality is everywhere evident, bearing witness to Piero's consciousness of ancient buildings. Perhaps most notable is his appreciation of the coloristic qual- ities of such edifices, with large colored marble walls and even ceilings. Piero will give a similar marbleized treatment to the actual lower wall of the chapel beneath the scenes, which of course follows the tradition as old as Giotto. The arrangement of the main figures along the same level, a constant in all the frescoes, may recall the Roman system found in reliefs. The building, which belongs to the same tem- plate as Herod's Palace in the Flagellation, does not, however, give much attention to the floor, which may have been regarded by the artist as partially cut-off from view. The building implies an expanding area to the right where the Queen of Sheba and her attendants congregate, but the condition of the frescoes does not permit a definitive conclusion. If we assign the follow- ing letters to various poses - a (profile), b (full-front), and c (in between) - the reading here may be taken as: a, b, a, a, c, c, a, as opposed to the Worship of the Wood, which follows the order of: a, c, c, a, c, b, a. But if the order of the scene of the Meeting of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba were reversed, it would read: a, c, c, a, a, b, a. In this case the scenes on the opposite walls repeat one another, with a single dissonant note. While it may be an over-analysis to insist upon such correspondences, a mathematical order can be expected from Piero. Solomon and his four councilors do not form a readily determinable pat- tern in any case, but the man (?) in white behind the King seems to be entirely repainted, making a judgement still more difficult. BOTTOM ZONE The Battle of Heraclius and the Death of Chosroes The validity of the overall reading order here proposed is put to a serious test when dealing with the bottom zone, which is lowest and nearest to both the spectator and the clergy on the floor of the choir-chapel. Logic might require that we move directly down from the right corner of the Solomon scene, to the right corner of the scene below it, that is to the Victory of Constantine. Actually such a reading turns out to be visually unconvincing. Instead, one is required this time to move across the chapel to the Battle of Heraclius and the Death of Chosroes on the opposite wall, as if the viewer, by coming to the end of a line on a page, is required to move down to the following line starting at the extreme left [Fig. 18]. The entire bottom zone moves along convincingly in this mode, and there is no reason to be overly rigid and ignore the visual evidence. This alterna- tion also offers the advantage of ending with a familiar scene in which the Cross is given central status. Any semblance, to be sure, of a chronological viable order collapses. The two battle representations have traditionally been regarded as closely connected. Also a relationship with Paolo Uccello's San Romano panels (Florence, Uffizi; Paris, Louvre; and London, National Gallery), long thought incorrectly to have been painted for the Palazzo Medici certainly before Piero's and very likely two decades earlier, has been postulat- ed. If there are parallels at all, any more than with Castagno's nearly contemporary monumental Niccolo of Tolentino fresco in the Florentine Duomo, they are generic and I fail to see any reading that would make them "sources." Piero has worked out his compositions within the compass of personal visual demands and with solutions that are consistent with a fully mature master in absolute control of his media, i.e. buon fres- co combined with the heavy use of secco. Furthermore he was up to the enormous challenges demanded by the subject mat- ter and the prominent location of the cycle. Exceptionally, here, he fills the center of the Battle of Heraclius and the Death of Chosroes with figural representations, in contrast to the Victory of Constantine [Fig. 19]. As is true of both the horizon- tally-oriented scenes above as well as the two lunettes, but not the Constantine, we find a number of separate and isolated incidents united into the composition, which can be isolated despite the rather poor state of preservation of the fresco. By approaching the picture from the left, the white lance that points upwards and to the right and another one which is flying in the air (from the "wrong" direction) almost horizontal- ly towards the center of the composition, provide a suitable 73</page><page sequence="24">JAMES BECK -ZFE F a ; i.ci ?,.

The situation is emphasized by two figures in profile fac- ing right, and a foreshortened grey horse together with a brown one. This section constitutes an introduction to the battle, with the flag of a white goose on a green field encapsu- lating it on the left, and may be regarded as the first incident. One must recognize that here Piero arranged the figural composition at variance from the other scenes, by effectively creating a shallow stage with two closely knit planes sand- wiched together. The closest generic analogy which comes to mind is Donatello's procedure for the main Cantoria reliefs, though I am loathe to pretend there was a one-to-one relation- ship. The bulk of the picture unfolds with a series of soldiers and horses whose heads line up nicely on the same level. Beneath them on a smaller scale are several encounters, two soldiers on horseback as well as mortally wounded combat- ants. The events on the first plane appear to unfold in front of the plotted confusion of the second, which is punctuated by flags with distinctive and largely fanciful devices. The front plane demands a different ideal horizon than the one behind it, actually a lower one. The portion of the picture on the extreme right does not participate in this binary system, but has its own scale, which is smaller and punctuated by the strange structure shown in foreshortening at the corner. Here is Chosroes' domain, picto- rially constituting a separate incident, where the repentant Chosroes is on his knees, presumably about to be beheaded. As a type he is similar to God the Father (as noted by Aron- berg-Lavin, et. al.) in the adjacent scene of the Annunciation and is in relative harmony with Him, in scale. In considering the two planes that dominate most of the composition, the proportions function so that the nearer plane actually has smaller figures. It is imperative to remember that this zone is closest to the spectator, and perhaps Piero used the shift in scale to compensate for that factor. Dismembered body parts of a youth on the ground at the left, with his head and one leg over it, is a daring if savage device, which prepares the view- er for the encounters nearby on the same plane. By itself, it forms the second incident in this complicated depiction. The trumpet-blowing man in the second plane effectively marks the beginning of the third incident, which is the largest. It 74</page><page sequence="25">PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA AT SAN FRANCESCO IN AREZZO: AN ART-HISTORICAL PEREGRINATION ?r:.C?;t"(?I r:: ::.; ?.y r.' ??5TW? sf'r, ?:r? :r? )?? L?? i. ? .S.L. "' ;?

This figure, one must quickly add, is ambiguously located in terms of the separation of the two planes. The flags are promi- nent with the Imperial Eagle on the left and the rampant Lion and the Cross filling the upper field. Here, too, the painting is dominated by the encounter of two horsemen, including the old man on the left riding a chestnut horse with his right arm raised, about to launch a spear. His age and his distinguishing plumed helmet may identify him as Heraclius. He confronts the man who rides a white horse with its mouth open, furnishing Piero with an opportunity to demonstrate his skill in perspective and foreshortening (to be sure, like Uccello). A fascinating display of weaponry including shields are offered, but it is totally unneces- sary and even ridiculous to postulate that Piero must have been an eye witness to the Battle of Anghiari (1440) in order to invent his battle scene, as some observers have sustained. In this fres- co, as elsewhere in the cycle, Piero reused cartoons for heads, which not only gives an order to the chaotic representation, but also saves Piero the effort of creating alternatives. Within the shallow first plane, there are three separate incidents, the first of which is a dramatic confrontation. It can be designated as incident four. Although a serious loss has made an effective reading difficult, the virtually nude man on the left, clutching a short sword with this right hand, is shown intently facing his adversary who has raised his weapon. As a virtual aside, the treatment of the muscular nude with a degree of anatomical conviction suggests that Piero was studying the male nude first-hand, but also that he had an awareness, as did Antonio Pollaiuolo after him, of both Etruscan painted vases and Roman reliefs showing battles. The nude is unexpected because it is the only figure among several score within the composition so presented. Should we chalk this up to poetic license, does it have a thematic valence, or perhaps it is a combination of the two? After all, this man, who like the old general turns toward the enemy on the right, belongs to the side of the "good guys." On the same plane is the fifth incident in which a flat-hel- meted soldier standing with his legs apart and his feet out, 75</page><page sequence="26">JAMES BECK more like a dancer than a soldier, grabs the hair of his enemy in a gesture recalling that from the Raising of Judas. The des- perate youth stretches out his right hand in supplication. The action is more frozen and symbolic than realistic. This inci- dent unfolds before a backdrop of horses' legs and hooves, alternating between light and dark. Next to this group, beneath the hooves of the white horse, we find a soldier on the ground fatally wounded in the neck. In this case, he should be read together with the horseman, as a separate unit, thus constituting the sixth incident in this remarkable istoria. Back in the second plane there is a brutal depiction of a soldier killing his enemy on horseback, the handsome youth with his throat slit, his body arched in mortal pain. Both con- testants are rendered in profile. This incident, the seventh, ends the division into planes, and introduces the execution of Chosroes, the eighth and final incident in the fresco in which the rump of a horse serves as a linking feature. The relic of the Cross, the raison d'etre for the entire cycle, is shown on a platform erected by the irreverent Chosroes, along with a throne and a rooster on a column. Both objects are presumably references to St. Peter, but the latter is also an inappropriate reference to the Holy Dove. These elements are placed obliquely in space, allowing a comfortable transition from this scene to the following one on the altar wall, the Annunciation [Fig. 20]. Especially noteworthy are the figures behind the kneeling heretic. In addition to the soldiers, there are at least three highly particularized men - an old man in profile facing to the right, another, middle-aged and looking out, and the third one, dressed in a red garment, in a haughty pose. These have been associated with members of the Bacci family, and so they may be, but they also symbolically repre- sent the three ages of man. In addition, there are challenging parallels with the three figures on the right half of the Flagellation who occupy a similar position in this composition. In fact, the oldest of the three is physiognomically a compan- ion to his counterpart in the panel picture, thus suggesting that if he is a Bacci, then the Bacci may have been the patrons of that painting in Urbino as well. Annunciation The Heraclius scene is connected to the adjacent one, the Annunciation, not only by the physiognomic similarity between God the Father and Chosroes, but by the pose of the angel Gabriel, who moves and points from left to right. The same directional stress is underscored by God's gesture diag- onally downward towards Mary, while the wooden bar repeats a series of horizontals which carry the eye across the pictorial 20) Piero della Francesca, &lt;Annunciation&gt;, Arezzo, San Francesco. field.

I opt for the "pure" Annunciation identification, based upon Mark Zucker's interpretation. The scholar ascer- tained that palm branches are found within the Aretine tradi- tion as exemplified by Parri Spinelli's Annunciation, and are even found in Sienese trecento examples (cf. Ambrogio Lorenzetti). Zucker also argues that the scene of the Annunciation of the death of the Virgin is found only in exten- sively evolved cycles of Mary's life. Besides, in the usually cited example, a panel by Duccio which forms part of the Maesta in Siena, the palm is surrounded by stars, which are not present here. What is missing in the scene is the dove of the Holy Spirit: it was either painted in secco and has since flaked off (Battisti), or more likely it was conceived by Piero as invisible, though emphatically implied by God's gesture. In the instance of the other rendering of the Annunciation by Piero, the puzzling upper section of the Franciscan Perugia Altarpiece (Perugia, Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria), the dove does appear, but without God. In this case the Angel seems to be holding nothing, neither the lily nor the palm. We must con- cede that Piero was not averse to sliding over conventions. Formally, the picture is intensely satisfying with its com- plex equilibrium and brilliant resolution of the architectural and figural representations, while rich in potent iconographic implications. The vertically-oriented composition is divided in half both vertically and horizontally, forming an implicit but robust cross. The white column is similar to the one depicted in the Flagellation, except that in the panel picture the column has vertical grooves. Light enters the scene from the upper right, that is from the actual window, so that the smooth sur- face of the column takes on a convincing presence, and the entasis, the swelling which the Ancients imposed upon columns, is readily visible. That the figure of Mary, large in pro- portion to the architecture, has an analogous solidity as she stands in easy contrapposto, has been frequently observed. Behind her there seems to have been an intarsia wall with a convincing perspectival decoration. It should also be noted that the two figures do not occupy the same architectural space. Mary stands at the corner of a loggia, while Gabriel is in a cortile, in front of closed doors. Nor are they on the same spatial plane. The building with its colorful marble inlays is far more fan- ciful than any Renaissance structure ever built, although its all'antica references belong unequivocally to the quattrocento vocabulary. The pole on iron brackets has caused a ripple in art-historical writing because the shadow of the pole runs through the loop at the bottom of the bracket, giving rise to a theory that it connects with the hanging of Judas. While the precise meaning of the shadow and the loop have yet to be convincingly explained, it does seem to me to be too specific not to have a particular meaning, especially because in other renderings of the same metal bracket in this cycle and else- where, Piero did not depict the loop below. Even in the brack- ets on the building on the left side of the Raising of Judas, with the later Judas, no such loop is found. I suspect that the pres- ence of the wooden pole is also revealing as the leitmotif of the entire cycle, while formally it continues that horizontal stress which brings us to the next scene, the Dream of Constantine. Dream of Constantine As in all of Piero's frescoes but perhaps more blatant here, a sensitivity for essential shapes, a kind of proto-Cezannesque formal emphasis, has made the Dream of Constantine excep- tionally admired by modern observers and, for that matter, modern artists [Fig. 2]. This admiration is heightened by Piero's inventive operation of light and daring foreshortenings. We witness Constantine experiencing a vision of an angel who shows him a tiny cross, which will be the source of his military victory the next morning on the battlefield. The angel appears to fly onto the scene from the vast gothic window, which pro- vides the light for most of the representations, although not this one. Instead of using the light provided by the window in the apse of the Cappella Maggiore, in this case Piero creates a light source within the picture itself, the angel swooping down in the direction of the sleeping Emperor, with his eyes closed and his bearded head lying comfortably on a pillow. The supernatural light in this night scene strikes the central conical tent and the pole inside, but especially the bedclothes of the sleeping hero. It bounces off the standing soldier on the right and even is reflected on the bottom side of his helmet. The other soldier in armour with a long spear in hand is lit from behind, while the young man sitting near the Emperor rests his head on his right hand, deep in thought, as if an innocent wit- ness to the miraculous event. If the light has a remarkable independent life of its own, so does the series of geometrical units, such as the wooden pole in the center, which echoes the column in the previous scene, and especially the tents, including the main one in luscious colors, whose tip is repeated four times in the background and indirectly referred to by the shapes of the soldiers' helmets. In this composition, as with its match on the other side of the window, the center is emphasized by a vertical pole. The mas- sive, oversize Mary dominates even the Emperor. 77</page><page sequence="28">JAMES BECK ; t, e? = , ,. ? ,;,. ;-"'i E&lt;. --.. -'t,i ..,.9..... -.%:i .;i * .:. . .-. .'; .':~.":? *! .~, . .-'. ., . ? .?.' . v-b' i ,. _.e.- . -. . ,, . . . . .'

Victory of Constantine There is a cause and effect rapport, or at least a strict chronological one, between the Dream of Constantine and the Victory of Constantine [Fig. 19]. It constitutes the end of the cycle according to the reading offered here, although not the last one 22) Masaccio, detail of &lt;&lt;Baptism of the Neophytes),, Florence, Brancacci Chapel. historically with a pairing widely recognized between this and the other battle scene. Generically, a case can be made for seeing the two together, but formally and compositionally they could hardly be more different. For one thing, no architectural device to produce a perspectival element is to be found in the Victory. Further differentiating the two is the figural void in the central of the Victory of Constantine. Additionally, the picture, which occu- pies a privileged position both in terms of its proximity to the 78 ;? ?I : ?</page><page sequence="29">PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA AT SAN FRANCESCO IN AREZZO: AN ART-HISTORICAL PEREGRINATION spectator and in terms of lighting (Paolucci, 1989), depicts a cav- alry battle with no fighting among foot soldiers. The fact is that it was not really a battle at all, but a victory of the Cross, without wounded and without bloodshed. And finally, the creation of two planes toward the front which organized the scene of Heraclius and Chosroes, here gives way to a more substantial single plane composed of equestrians moving from left to right, brought to order by a horn-blowing soldier at the extreme left and a mysteri- ous man in full armour. As is readily evident, this scene has suf- fered severe losses, with the result that about twenty-five percent of the surface has disappeared, and some of the rest has received substantial repainting over the past two centuries, as can be appreciated by viewing the watercolor copy dating toward the beginning of the nineteenth century. Apparently the bulk of the damage occurred not during the first four hundred years of the cycle's existence, but during the last 150 years or so, coincid- ing with a series of drastic restorations. The presence of an ample landscape with a river and fasci- nating mirror reflections also differentiates the Constantine from its stepbrother across the choir. The latter element, as cri- ticism has frequently observed, is related to the Baptism in London, but here the river with its engaging reflections is given an even nobler function than in the panel picture. The rapport between the Baptism and the True Cross cycle-evidenced by this treatment of water and the appearance of "Easterners" with characteristic hats, as well as the connection between one of the angels and a figure in the Adamites-suggests that the early date often allocated to the London picture may not be correct. After all, the new chronological indications offered by Settesoldi make the scenes on the bottom zone, obviously the latest, datable to the mid-1460s. The central landscape, which is dominated by two trees, the winding river, and the foreshort- ened cross held by Constantine, may very well be a reference to the ritual of Baptism and thus signifies conversion. The retreating horseman nearest to the viewer struggling to extricate himself from the river's steep embankment consti- tutes one of the most striking images in the entire cycle. Since he acts with formal independence he may be regarded as a separate incident, while the helmeted Constantine, who appears in the likeness of a Byzantine emperor in front of his entourage, constitutes another. The landscape should also be regarded as an intrinsic unit in its own right, and finally on the right, the defeated forces of Maxentius make up the fourth inci- dent. One can also imagine that the coloristic qualities of the scene were especially winning, with the strange flags, bright lances, and sweeping headdresses all rendered against the cloud-filled blue sky. The clouds, like the veins on the wood of the Cross are purely intellectual interpretations, not realistic or even naturalistic treatments. They are Piero's clouds which he fits into a strict pattern. Similarly the variations and repetitions of variously colored horses' legs and hooves also exemplify the imposition of Piero's will upon nature. He reused the same cartoon time and time again for these legs and hooves to cre- ate a lively rhythm along the low horizon. Another powerful formal element is the arrangement of lances - mainly vertical at the left, and then turned toward Constantine on the right - along with the inclination of the flags showing a dragon and the head of a Moor. If Constantine's banner with the Imperial eagle is readily identi- fied, the others are more esoteric and probably imaginary, though no less effective. There was once a nearly nude young man on an oversized white horse whose rump is still visible in the lower foreground, known from a copy. Pertaining to a small group, the nudity is not easily explained, unless it refers to the Baptism which will soon take place. CODETTA The representations on the inner arch are only partially preserved, and several of them seem to predate Piero's involvement in the project. Among the saints in Gothic niches and heads of angels in quatrefoils, a single image stands out as very close to Piero, a work which is truly bewildering to interpret. Located nearest to the Proving of the Wood of the Cross, high up on the arch is a winged Cupid. The rare, purely pagan element among the representations, he holds a large bow and his eyes are covered. The delicate and challenging issues regarding the iconog- raphy of the cycle and its strict rapport with the local Franciscans, as well as the aspirations of Arezzo, has been taken up again recently, along with questions regarding the donors. (Cf. G. Centauro and E. Settesoldi, op. cit.) My objec- tive has been to offer a convincing, commonsensical reading of the cycle without demands for an esoteric explanation. The issues of the layering of scenes so common in Giotto and in the century that followed him, gradually gave way toward the end of the Quattrocento and in the beginning of the Cinquecento, first with Filippino Lippi in Santa Maria Novella, and soon after with the unexecuted murals projected by Michelangelo and Leonardo for the Palazzo Signoria in Florence. Even as late as Ghirlandaio's choir frescoes for Santa Maria Novella, the time- honored system retained its vitality. In this respect Piero remained a man of his own moment, but the tightly-controlled compositions, the interconnections between one scene and another, and his insistence upon willfully leading the spectator (and implicitly the patron and the Friars) through the cycle is a formidable aspect of his remarkable contribution. 79</page><page sequence="30">JAMES BECK I am especially grateful for the stimulus of my friends Enzo Settesoldi of Florence and Giuseppe Centauro of Prato to engage in this study. For the preparation of the published version I wish to acknowledge the timely help of Dr. Lynn Catterson-Silver and especially to Denise Budd. 1 G. Centauro and E. Settesoldi, Piero della Francesca: commit- tenza e pittura nella chiesa di S. Francesco ad Arezzo (con nuovi doc- umenti inediti), Poggibonsi [Siena], 2000. 2 Loc. cit., p. 89 and Doc. 44. This being a credit rather than a record of an actual payment already made, the implication is that either Piero was about to start at the time, or had recently started (and was not yet paid). 3 I am not implying that more complex and esoteric readings are unrewarding. 4 It is curious that Marco, the eldest, was not named for his grandfather Pietro, the honor of which was reserved for our Piero. This circumstance may have led Bertelli (1991) to supposed that Piero was the oldest child within the family. The same author seems to make a distinction between the brothers, Marco, perhaps illegitimate, and Antonio, "fratello carnale." If in fact Marco was illegitimate, he would not have been given the grandfather's name, as was actually the case with Leonardo. See below note 8. 5 P Brooks, Ut pictura mathesis: studies in the art of Piero della Francesca, Ph. D. Diss: Columbia University, 1990. 6 One has to be amazed at how Vasari's approximations have persisted in the literature in being taken seriously, and in the case of Piero, have served to confound the situation unnecessarily. Simply speaking Vasari did not know when Piero was born, so that to search beneath the surface of his vita is not particularly useful in this regard. 7 C. Bertelli (Piero della Francesca: la forza divina della pittura, Cinisello Balsamo, 1991, p. 230) assumes that Piero was in the shop from the beginning of the contract, i.e. 1430. The documentation was first located by J. R. Banker ("Un documento inedito del 1432 sull'at- tivita di Piero della Francesca per la chiesa di San Francesco in Borgo San Sepolcro," Rivista d'arte, LXII, ser. IV, vol. VI, 1990, p. 245-7). See also, ID., "Piero della Francesca as assistant to Antonio d'Anghiari," Burlington Magazine, Jan. 1993, p. 16-21. 8 I wondered why Piero and not Marco or Antonio had been named for his paternal grandfather. Enzo Settesoldi gave me the answer. If the grandfather were still alive when the first two male chil- dren were born to his son the name Piero would not have been used. Hence we can probably make the intelligent guess that between the birth of Antonio and Piero, nonno Pietro had died. 9 G. Renzi, Piero della Francesca: storia, leggenda, profezia, teologia nelle pitture murali della Cappella maggiore, Basilica di S. Francesco, Arezzo, ed. G. Centauro, Poggibonsi, 1996, p. 21. With regard to the connection with the angels of the Baptism of Christ, one should keep in mind that the angels have no particular sexual attributes. 10 M. Aronberg Lavin (Piero della Francesca. San Francesco, Arezzo, New York, 1994, p. 40) describes the woman as "this beautiful, round-eyed boy." Eugenio Battisti [Piero della Francesca, 2 vols., Milano, 1992, I: 484, n. 203] refers to a "fanciula" dressed as an Amazon and sees a relationship to Castagno's Eve. 1 J. H.

Thus the juxtaposition of age, and its implications, remains in- tact. The isolation of sub-themes or separate incidents was used effec- tively by the Krautheimers in their masterful monograph on Ghiberti (1956) in the analysis of the individual panels on the doors of Paradise. 14 With increasingly more accurate technology in the reconstruc- tion of older art works through the development of facsimiles, there seems to be little doubt that by combining the known facts, examples of the best preserved works, and expanded knowledge of pictorial techniques, we will, in the near future, have a much better idea of how Piero's frescoes once appeared than we do today. A highly informative photograph of the two lovers, i.e. the young Adam and Eve, is on the cover of Kermes: La Rivista del Restauro (Jan.-March 2001), in which one can readily read her exposed breast. On the other hand, it seems to be quite obvious that a good deal of repainting has occured here, with considerable confusion, for example, in the outline of Adam's out- stretched arm. A coherent treatment of light and its sources within and outside the picture seems to have escaped the restorers. 15 Alberto Cottignoli, whose little book II Segreto di Piero, Monteriggioni [Siena], 2000, gives some clues as to the direction he takes towards Piero, assures me that the scene should be read not as a Raising but as still in the punishment stage. Cottignoli plans to pub- lish his reading along with other readings of the True Cross cycle. 16 Cottignoli also believes that rather than a tripod, we are deal- ing here with rays of light. 17 Recognizing how treacherous it is to identify portraits in fif- teenth century painting, I offer this suggestion as exactly that. 18 This factor might serve to give weight to the views expressed by Cottignoli. 19 Here once again, it does not seem helpful to insist upon these identifications. 80</page></plain_text>
