<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hallucinatory imagery and the origin of early South American figurine art Peter W. Stahl A set of universally redundant sensory phenomena comprise the experiential basis of hallucination. In particular, the onset of visual hallucinatory imagery includes the appearance of symmetrical and geometrically patterned polychrome designs (Stahl 1985: 118) which eventually give way to progressively more complex hallucinatory themes. In this paper, I focus attention on both the content and context of later stage 'true' hallucination, for amidst such associated phenomena as spatial and temporal distortion, the experience of historical and mythical events, and religious introspection, is the repeated, consistent appearance of and/or communion with small anthropomorphic figures. I propose that the ecstatic sighting of otherworldly spirits is both a cross cultural constant of hallucination as well as a response to culturally conditioned expectations. I suggest that in association with other preserved material correlates of native cosmology, shamanism, and ritual ecstasy, the appearance and context of Early Formative Ecuadorian anthropomorphic figurines is consistent with an interpretation that they served as analogues for shamanic aids used during spiritual alteration and flight when the shaman contacts benevolent spiritual intermediaries - the small anthropomorphic images of hallucination. Lowland South American cosmology and shamanism The cosmologies of native lowland South Americans share important similarities with societies throughout the world whose intellectual base is underlain by a belief in ecstatic religion (Eliade 1964). Cosmographically coextant with an observable world of mundane events, is a world of mythic time and space which is most consistently visited through ritually ecstatic alteration of body and spirit. The central practitioner in this cosmographical landscape is the shaman, who mediates at the celestial nave or Axis Mundi with hidden spirit worlds on behalf of his community. Interpretive power, gained from unrestricted movement throughout the cosmos, is the essential feature of the shaman for with it he benefits the community through a bestowal World Archaeology Volume 18 No. 1 Perspectives in world archaeology ?

This is achieved with the aid of spirit helpers who mediate between the societal representative and a distant God/Creator. Through ecstatic metamorphosis into a powerful feline, snake, or raptor, the shaman transcends the mundane world and flies through the cosmos, often to distant spirit villages. With the aid of his acquired spiritual intermediaries, the shaman seeks to understand and rectify underlying disorder. This cosmological 'luminescence' enables the shaman to 'see' and take corrective measures through singing, massaging, blowing - often with tobacco smoke, maraca playing, drug-induced identification of afflictions, and extractive sucking of harmful objects (Barandiaran 1962: 89). Shamanic power can also be used to direct harm through the sending of evil objects intended to inflict a chosen victim. In death, as in life, it is the shaman who guides the soul-spirit to and from hidden worlds. Ecstatic agents, hallucination, and spirits A crucial variable underlying the shaman's role in the cosmos is the control of techniques for achieving ecstatic entrance to hidden spirit worlds. In the human condition ecstatic states are obtained through any combination of fasting, rhythmic exercise, repetitive auditory stimulation, or inflicted pain; however, these techniques become subordinated in the botanically complex setting of tropical lowland South America where a bewildering array of plant compounds are used. I list here only a few of the important or immediately relevant examples. Two stimulants with documented archaeological antiquity in western South America include the San Pedro cactus Trichocereus pachanoi from which mescaline-based drinks or additives to native brews are obtained; and species of Coca Erythroxylum from which alkaloids are membraneously exploited generally with the aid of plant ash. Within the Pulse family (Leguminosae), tryptamine derivatives are consumed from species of Anadenanthera as snuff, chewed in seed form, or mixed into alcoholic brews. Similarly, Mimosa spp. are exploited in snuffs and drinks. Virola spp., members of the Nutmeg family (Myristicaceae), yield hallucinogenic snuffs and pills. Banisteriopsis spp. vines, family Malpighiaceae, are widely used in the production of psychoactive drinks to which other ingredients such as Psychotria spp. buds may be added. A holly, Ilex spp. is prepared into stimulating and emetic drinks. High levels of atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine are exploited from a Nightshade, Datura spp., and used in conjunction with Banisteriopsis and native beers. Tobacco Nicotiana spp., imbibed as smoke, liquid, snuff or admixture is the shamans' principal mediatory aid. Pepper Capsicum spp. toxins are manipulated as smoke, liquid, and applied to the eyes in order to establish mediation. Alcoholic brews, often fortified with powerful psychotropes are a chief constituent of ritual. For the sake of brevity I omit specific mention of various fungi, beans, vines, or plant decoctions from which lesser known snuffs, drinks and eye drops are prepared (see Stahl 1984: 56-65, 94-104 for expanded discussion). Hallucination, particularly when prompted through drug intoxication, is characterized by progressively complex stages of excitation which may be linked to the constantly deeper levels of consciousness tapped by the shaman during ecstasy. The early stages of</page><page sequence="3">136 Peter W. Stahl visual hallucination are dominated by colours and redundant patterned geometrics which have been reported for a wide range of hallucinogens and involve excitation of the Central Nervous System (Kliiver 1966: 66; Oster 1966: 39; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975: 173; Siegel &amp; Jarvik 1975: 108; Siegel 1977). Greater complexity of content is elicited in subsequent stages of excitation when composite visions of animals, people, and various objects, historical and mythical events, religious symbolism and enlightenment, and deep understanding are experienced (Masters and Houston 1968: 88; Siegel 1977: 133-4; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1978: 47). A general distortion of time and space, including recognizably important aspects of shamanic ecstasy as bodily departure, clairvoyance and divination are universally encountered. I focus attention on the repeated visualisation of and communion with otherworldly spirits as a constant associated with later stage hallucination. The visual perception of human figures in various forms and sizes has been documented under experimental conditions in the hallucinatory inventory of Cocaine (Siegel 1978: 31) as well as LSD and derivatives (Malitz, Wilkens &amp; Esecover 1962: 57; Siegel and Jarvik 1975: 111), Cannabis (Siegel and Jarvik 1975: 115), and Banisteriopsis (Naranjo 1973: 120). This is further supported by the accounts of anthropologists under the influence of native psychotropes (Dobkin de Rios 1972: 127; Harner 1968: 28; Kuisel 1965). Psychologically, these visions may be related to the drug-induced conditions of macropsia and micropsia (LaBarre 1975: 13; Dobkin de Rios 1984: 131); however, in native ritual context they are inextricably related to culturally held expectations. It is crucial for the shaman to contact spirits during his ecstatic flights in hidden worlds; therefore, it is not surprising that cultural expectations and hallucinatory visions are intimately related. Table 1 lists ethnographic examples of the repeated and consistent linkage between ecstatic agents, hallucinatory imagery,, and cultural expectations. The shaman uses ecstatic agents as a means for transcending mundane boundaries, principally in order to contact intermediary spirits from which he is to gain knowledge, help, and guidance. It is, therefore, understandable why human images are repeatedly hallucinated and why ecstatic agents and spirits are intimately related. Recent figurine usage in lowland South America Recent examples of non-secular usage, suggest that an intimate relationship is shared between figurines and otherworldly spirits. During ecstatic contact with hidden worlds, the figurine often serves as a mundane repository for otherworldly spirits. Upon completion of the ritual visit, the figurine is vacated. Illustrative examples are known from the historic Arawakan Taino of Puerto Rico, Hispafiola, and Eastern Cuba. Here, Zemis were considered as supernaturally powerful 'messengers' who were subordinate to the Gods. The form of a particular Zemi was governed by shamanic dream or trance under the influence of Cahoba (Anadenanthera spp.) snuff. The Zemi's owner would invoke its power by inhaling the snuff from a tablet on its head, or alternatively with any combination of fasting, vomitory purification, and tobacco inhalation (Roth 1915: 169; Rouse 1963: 535-7; Schleiffer 1973: 78-80).</page><page sequence="4">Hallucinatory imagery and early South American figurine art 137 Table 1 Ethnographic examples of anthropomorphic imagery during ritual hallucination Group Vision Reference Banisteriopsis spp. Cubeo, NW Amazonia Desana, NW Amazonia Chama, Bolivia Acre State, Brazil Sharanahua, Per6 Amahuaca, Peru, Brazil Quijos, Ecuador Siona, Ecuador with Psychotria spp. Cashinahua, Peru Kofan, Ecuador Virola spp. Yanoama, Venezuela, Brazil Witoto, W Amazonia People People, first human-beings spirits People Human-like shori (Ayahuasca) spirits Yoshi sp,i its of Ayahuasca (Banisteriopsis) Doll-like supai Yaje-pai, people of Yaj6 People &amp; villages Oprito, or 'Heavenly people' Hekula, some have human form Little people Goldman 1963: 210 Reichel-Dolmatoff 1970: 33 Hissink 1960: 526 Prance 1970: 67 Siskind 1973: 135 Carneiro 1964: 8 Oberem 1971: 227 Calella 1940-1: 748; Chaves 1958: 133 Kensinger 1973: 12 Pinkley 1969: 535 Taylor 1979: 204-11 Schultes 1972: 44 Datura spp. Shipibo, Peru Joshin spirits Capsicum spp., Tobacco, Fasting Carib, Surinam Towns and people Music Trance Warao, Venezuala Hebu spirits Karsten 1955: 164 Andres 1938: 337-8 Olsen 1975: 19 also, examples of Alcohol use to attract spirits Mojo, Bolivia Favoured food of Gods M6traux 1943: 23 Choc6 To attract Spirits Pineda &amp; Pineda 1958: 448 Certain Guyanese Arawak were said to use small black figurines for divining prognoses during ecstatic curing rituals (Roth 1915: 331); whereas those used by a group in French Guiana were employed for ritual exorcism of the sick (Roth 1915: 350). Similarly, dolls are used by Cariban and Arawakan groups of the Upper Xingu region of Brazil in ecstatic curing sessions (Basso 1973: 57), and in cases of soul loss where health is restored by capturing and returning a pilfered soul to its original owner with the aid of a figurine (Gregor 1977: 327; Carneiro 1982: 315). In northwestern South America, the Chibchan Choc6 shaman jaiband uses small anthropomorphic figures jaiduma which represent the jais or spirits during curing, first harvest, and chicha ceremonies, and serve as ancestral or guardian spirits for young initiates and children (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1961; Torres de Arauiz 1962). The Cuna</page><page sequence="5">138 Peter W. Stahl shaman cures his patient through the use of small messenger figurines mimmisuara, nuchu, nele who, with the aid of burning coca, travel to evil spirit villages in an effort to find the lost soul. They can also be set up in rows against the house wall in order to expel epidemics (Holmer and Wass6n 1953; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1961). Early prehistoric South American figurines Up to this point, I have used examples primarily from lowland South American ethnography to demonstrate that: (1) anthropomorphic images are included in the cross cultural repertoire of later stage hallucination; (2) the principal reason for and expected consequence of shamanic ecstasy is to contact otherworldly spirits; and (3) during ecstatic communion, figurines are often used as worldly repositories for contacted spirits. I now analogically extend these relationships back in time, by arguing that certain archaeological figurine complexes may be considered as preserved material correlates associated with an analogous prehistoric belief system. Furthermore, although attention is focused on small preserved anthropomorphic objects, I recognize from the outset the biasing constraints imposed by the vagaries of preservation, as well as the arbitrary restriction of this study to diminutive figurines from western South America. I believe that related functional interpretations can be extended to a temporally and spatially wide range of anthropo-, zoo-, and therianthropomorphs executed in low relief carving, painted murals, sculptures, and monoliths. Preserved anthropomorphic figurines appear as early as the fourth millennium B.C. in western South America, from as far south as northern coastal Chile (Nufiez 1967-8) to as far north as Ecuador. I will focus my discussion on the earliest Formative figurines of western lowland Ecuador, not only because of their temporal and artistic precocity, but also as they are numerous, well studied, and the earliest examples of a remarkably long continuum of figurine manufacture in this area. The early formative stage of western Ecuador Recent studies have demonstrated that the tropical lowlands of western Ecuador were colonized around 3500 B.C. and occupied for roughly the next 2000 years by ceramic- producing village horticulturalists named after the type site at Valdivia (Fig. 1). Various classes of archaeological data underlie interpretive scenarios dealing with the evolution of settlement patterns, economic systems, and cosmology which basically draw analogues from an ethnographically documented Tropical Forest Culture (Lathrap 1970: 67; 1974: 130; Lathrap, Collier and Chandra 1975; Marcos, Lathrap and Zeidler 1976; Lathrap, Marcos and Zeidler 1977; Marcos 1978; Damp 1979; 1982; Raymond, Marcos and Lathrap 1980; Stahl 1984; 1985; Zeidler 1984). Anthropomorphic figurines are an hallmark of the Valdivia Phase cultures and, together with ceramics, form the basis of an eight-part chronological framework (Hill 1975; Marcos 1978) that begins with early phases at the sites of Valdivia, Loma Alta, Punta Concepci6n and Real Alto (Fig. 1).

Of the 536 figurines and/or fragments located in the most recent excavations at Loma Alta, only 76 exhibited little or no predepositional damage. Furthermore, figurines appear randomly distributed in the midden soils which are located at the site peripheries. Where early phase structural features have been delineated, as at Real Alto (Damp 1979: 73-5), Loma Alta (Stahl 1984: 162-6), and Phase 3 context at Real Alto (Zeidler 1984: 435-43, 487), figurines appear to be associated with domestic refuse. This pattern of incorporating Valdivia phase figurines into general household rubbish with no apparent interest in special curation was earlier observed at Valdivia (Evans and Meggers 1958) and San Pablo (Zevallos 1971). There is also evidence to indicate that figurines were intentionally mutilated before being tossed away. The overwhelming majority (N = 460, 85.8 per cent) of the sample appears fragmented, and are often severely damaged. Two dominant patterns of breakage are apparent. Clearly 191 (35.6 per cent) specimens have been 'decapitated', being either recognizably lower or upper body fragments (Fig. 3). Matching body parts are only rarely found. A second pattern of breakage appears as destruction of the incised or excised facial areas, and the occasional shearing off of the end opposite leg notches (Fig. 4). This pattern is observed in 49 (9.1 per cent) specimens, or 112 (20.9 per cent) specimens if plain figurines with damage to one end are taken into account. Apart from the occasional hinge fracture, it is difficult to prove whether or not these apparent patterns of breakage are intentional. They may, for example, simply be a by- product of the structural weakening of the mudstone matrix through incision or excision. However, by plotting the relationship between worked/unworked and broken/complete figurines to their cross-sectional dimensions, there appears to be no significant correlation between cross-sectional morphology, surface treatment, and discarded appearance (Stahl n.d.). Intentional 'decapitation' and 'effacement' of figurines is repeated at other Early Formative sites as Valdivia (Estrada 1956; 1958: 22-5; Evans and Meggers 1958: 180; Meggers, Evans and Estrada 1965: 96, 98, 99, 106, Plates 117-26; Bischof 1979: Abb. 21), Real Alto (Lathrap, Marcos and Zeidler 1977: 7; Zeidler 1984: 387); San Pablo (Zevallos and Holm 1960: Laminas 15-24; Zevallos 1971: 22, Lamina 10); and El Encanto (Porras 1973: Figuras 44-7). Similar patterns are observable in later context to the south (Bushnell 1951: Figures 19-21, 44), to the north (Saville 1907: 49-56, 81; 1910: 127; Dorsey 1901: 267; Sanchez Montafies 1981: Laminas 3, 8-10, 28, 29, 31-6) and into the interior (Parducci and Parducci 1970: Figuras 7-11, Cuadro 4, Laminas 12-18).

The limited ethnographic documentation on figurine discard in lowland tropical South America indicates extremes of curation from reverential status in special sanctuaries to disposal on domestic trash heaps. Citing the ethnographic observations of the Reichel- Dolmatoffs in Colombia, Evans and Meggers (1958) were the first to draw attention to Dolmatoffs in Colombia, Evans and Meggers (1958) were the first to draw attention to</page><page sequence="11">144 Peter W. Stahl both the quantity of figurine fragments and their appearance in refuse context. As with the Choc6 and Cuna examples, it was suggested that helper spirits were ecstatically contacted and introduced into the figurines. Upon conclusion of the ceremony, the imbued power of the figurine was lost and it was then discarded as a useless item. To this I add the specific destruction of head and facial areas, as Grove (1981) has noted for virtually all examples of natural representations and portrait art amongst the Gulf Coast Olmec. The proposed function of these Early Valdivia Phase figurines as shamanic aids is further supported by their association with other visible material correlates of shamanism (Stahl 1984). For example, excavations at Loma Alta reveal the strong possibility of a 'U'-shaped community in early phase context (Damp 1984: 581; Stahl 1984: 153-67); an observation which can be made for other Valdivia sites as well as for later settlements throughout Nuclear America. This may reflect incorporation of the Axis Mundi into community design; an interpretation which is further strengthened by a consistent pre-- Columbian demarcation of central space through sunken plazas, open courtyards, depressed floors, subterranean shafts and rooms, often with associated niches, and therianthropomorphic and zoomorphic icons (Stahl 1984: 83-7). Various classes of archaeological data reveal the ancient use of stimulants in western South America, some of which occur in Early Formative Stage contexts. A small, round clay container associated with the area of the left hand of an interment (Stahl 1984: 226-9), is similar to examples identified as lime containers used in conjunction with coca consumption (Lathrap, Collier and Chandra 1975: 47; Zeidler 1984: 394, 451). Depictions of coca mastication appear in later phase figurines, as do snuff trays incorporated into figurine heads (Lathrap, Collier and Chandra 1975: 47--8). Snuffing tubes have an extensive pre-Columbian distribution in South America, and have been recovered from Late Formative contexts in Ecuador (Lathrap, Collier and Chandra 1975: 47)? Other potential stimulants that occur in archaeological contexts in western South America include species of cactus, Ilex, tobacco, and pepper. Finally, a large portion of the surviving Valdivia phase ceramic inventory has been associated with the prehistoric production and consumption of fermented brews (Lathrap, Marcos and Zeidler 1977: 9; Marcos 1978: 47; Damp 1979: 88; 1982: 171; Norton 1982: 107; Stahl 1984: 197; 1985: 107; Zeidler 1984: 432). Repeated iconographic portrayal of serpentine motifs on early phase bowls accom- plished by the manipulation of triangles and zoned hachure (Damp 1979; 1982; Stahl 1984: 168-74, see Fig. 5, top) may be associated with ritual metamorphosis. Small zoomorphic clay stools have been uncovered in middle phase context at the Valdivia site (Meggers, Evans and Estrada 1965: 103; Lathrap, Collier and Chandra 1975: '79), and may be identified with shamanic paraphernalia. The iconographic content of early phase ceramic bowls (Fig. 5) may have its genesis in early stage visual hallucination; being comparable to the range of commonly redundant form constants (Stahl 1985: 119). Furthermore, this iconography appears in conjunction with a bold red slip; a colour which becomes visually dominant with increased drug dosage (Malitz, Wilkens and Esecover 1962: 58; La Barre 1975: 13; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975: 162, 164; Siegel and Jarvik 1975: 115; Siegel 1977: 134). Significantly, red is the principal colour associated with ritual mediation of space as it functions to protect the</page><page sequence="12">Hallucinatory imagery and early South American figurine art 145 ) I1 Figure 5 Reconstructed early Valdivia Phase bowls (numbers represent maximum circumference in cm) ritual participant and/or attract benevolent spirits (Stahl 1984: 96-8, 223-5). Not surprisingly, later phase figurines are predominantly red-slipped; an understandable correlation when considering man's relationship with spirits, the ritual role of figurines, and their ultimate hallucinatory origin.

Stahl Concluding statement Throughout Nuclear America, figurines have been considered as symbols of fertility and/or fecundity; curing aids; household idols; votive offerings; charms; cult objects; and teaching devices. In Ecuador, functional interpretations have tended to treat figurines as either objects involved in fertility and procreation (Estrada 1956; 1958; Zevallos and Holm 1960: 10; Zevallos 1971: 23; Zeidler 1984: 390) or as aids in curing rituals (Evans and Meggers 1958; Evans, Meggers and Estrada 1959: 10; Meggers, Evans and Estrada 1965: 108; Meggers 1966; Lathrap, Collier and Chandra 1975: 47). I am in basic agreement with the second interpretive scenario adding, however, that 'curing' in a Native American sense broadly covers the correction of a wide range of conditions which have their etiology in a normally hidden world. This otherworld of spirits is usually entered ritually by a shaman through ecstatic alteration of mind and body in order to uncover the true source of an affliction with the aid of acquired spirit helpers. Visitation with spirits is both an expected consequence of ecstatic ritual and a cross-culturally identifiable form constant associated with later stage 'true' hallucination. The figurines may have served as mundane abodes for summoned spirits within the context of an analogous prehistoric religion. Entirely speculative at this moment is the suggestion that these associations may be applicable to a wide range of archaeological contexts throughout Nuclear America and the New World. The intimate association of native New World religions with ecstatic shamanism is indeed well documented. If the associations and interpretations outlined in this paper receive increased factual support through future research, it may indeed be possible to derive an ultimate hallucinatory origin for much of what we as anthropologists consider to be Native American 'art'. 20.1.86 Institute of Archaeology London Acknowledgments The fieldwork at Loma Alta was undertaken in 1980 and 1982 under the direction of J.

Hallucinatory imagery and the origin of early South American figurine art Hallucination is associated with a set of universal and redundant sensory phenomena which often include the appearance of anthropomorphic images. These are especially apparent through drug intoxication, a technique used by native shamans of tropical lowland South America to achieve ecstatic communion with spirits. The paper presents evidence for the ritual use of figurines as repositories for ecstatically contacted spirits. It is suggested that certain Early Formative stage archaeological figurines in western Ecuador may have had an analogous function in a prehistoric shamanic religion.</page></plain_text>
