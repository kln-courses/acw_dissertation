<plain_text><page sequence="1">Has the Biblical Scholar Failed the Religious Educator? ERNEST J. CHAVE T HE THREE questions of our symposium suggest the unfortunate separation of the specialized interests which reli- gion has developed. It is a significant day when Biblical scholars invite some of their colleagues in the field of religion to sit with them for consideration of common prob- lems. At a time when the whole world situation demands religious leadership we find a grievous lack of unity in the forces of religion and a sad inadequacy for the task. It is not strange that some people have tried to make a strategical withdrawal shifting the responsibility upon their deity. It is not strange that illiterate.and uncritical minds have concocted all kinds of fantastic dreams in their blind outreach for help. The challenge to intelligent educated reli- gious men and women who assume the role of religious leadership is humbling. In one generation we have seen two world wars, and some think another greater world conflict is yet beyond the horizon. Many careful thinkers fear more the com- ing problems of peace, or an armistice, than the difficulties of a global war. What are we as religious leaders, in our varied un- dertakings, doing to change world con- ditions, so that men and women, boys and girls, may have reasons for hope? The seminary is just one school among many on a modern university campus, ignored for the most part by those who are busy in the other schools and depart- ments. The church is one type of organ- ization among many in our modern society, and has few inter-relationships with the others. People deal with religious ideas and practices as if they were inconsequen- tal addenda to the rest of life or unimportant relics of an outgrown age. Leadership is measured by one's following and the ac- complishments of one's undertakings. Many religious leaders are discouraged and depressed. What is wrong? What can be done to change the situation? First of all we should be glad if Biblical scholars would help us as religious educa- tors to identify religion, and to find examples of religion in action. There are many illustrations in the records of ancient days of religion becoming decadent and corrupt in the temples and in the established practices. Yet the vital leavening power of religion has never died. It was frequently found where least expected, and a better form of religion arose out of the ashes of the old. Will the Biblical scholars tell us what they think of a functional definition of religion? Do we have good precedent and justification for trying to shift the focus of attention from doctrines and ceremonial practices to the spirit and operation of reli- gion in the commonplaces of life? Should it be possible to indicate what is meant by spiritual life growing in a child, youth, or adult? Do we have worthy precedent when we attempt to tell what it is that stimulates growth, what hinders it, and how both in- dividuals and groups should be expected to function if religion is a vital quality of everyday experience? As religious educa- tors some of us have become convinced (I) that we can state the basic qualities of reli-. gion in functional terms so that they can be identified anywhere, (2) that religion with the finest qualities of spiritual life is growing fairly well in our democracy, and many different agencies are contributing to its growth, (3) that the church has a bigger op- portunity than it ever had, and (4) religious leaders may have more thrilling tasks than ever before. 83</page><page sequence="2">84 ERNEST J. CHAVE [May Briefly stated these are the ways in which, we believe, religion functions in modern society, and here are some of the questions the religious educator, would ask the Biblical scholar: I. Religion gives growing persons a sense of worth, a feeling of being more than mere animals driven by blind impulses, more than mere mechanisms running on an instinct and habit level. Whenever and wherever growing persons are helped to un- derstand the possibilities of living on this higher level, and develop desires to real- ize their possibilities, the ends of religion are being achieved. Do you as Biblical scholars believe this has always been an important factor in religion? And is this what Christianity is supposed to do better than any other religion? 2. Religion develops social sensitivity, respect of one person for another. It helps people to feel the mutuality of growing life, the interdependence of people. It seeks to call forth the spirit of brotherly love so that people control their social conduct by regard for others, and with desire to help others realize the fullness of their possibili- ties. You Biblical scholars know how this has grown from the narrow tribal concepts, through the messages of the prophets, to the spirit of Jesus. 3. Religion deals with the appreciation of the universe, a recognition of those forces and processes which permit the growth of personal-social values. While mankind develops skills in describing and using the latent forces of life, religion keeps asking the question as to what it all means in the growth of human values. What place does man have in this evolving universe? What is the nature of the ultimate? Religion has developed ideas of God, and man, and possibilities of a better day. You Biblical scholars know how much change there was even in the Biblical period. Can you help us as religious educators, to enable chil- dren, youths, and adults to gain a larger faith than has yet been expressed, a more adequate conception of God, and a greater faith in man and his progress toward a better day ? 4. Religion is an age-old process of growth, with symbols and records to indi- cate the different ideas and visions people have had in the past. It has grown by ex- change of thought, by constant revision and re-evaluation of the highest forms of ex- pression. The Bible is one record of a limited area of human experience, but all countries and people and periods of time have made their contributions to the growth of ideas and to the incorporation of them into the practices of life. Should not the Biblical scholar help the religious educator to get perspective, to mine out the treasures from all kinds of sources of past and pres- ent? Should the religious educator expect to get the needed racial experience, and proofs of the operation of the principles and ideals of religion, from this one collection of the Judaeo-Christian records? Is the Bible the best material to use in starting the educational program of children? Can we get the best theological concepts by limiting our study to the Bible, or can we expect boys and girls to be motivated to the best ways of living by using the Bible as their main text? 5. Religion is a development of discrim- ination in values with a readiness to sacrifice lesser values in order to achieve greater. Sacrifice has become for many a mere abstract concept, or a legalistic term in relation to a deity, but few have dis- covered it as the law of progress. Biblical scholars know how doctrines and practices have centered around sacrifice, and how prophets have struggled to clarify and purify the needed sacrificial spirit. Can they help the educator to show how it should operate in the commonplaces of life, from the cradle to the grave? Can we expect religion to make people more dis- criminating, more refined, and less bound by animal appetites and low or mediocre interests ?</page><page sequence="3">1944] BIBLICAL SCHOLAR VERSUS RELIGIOUS EDUCATOR 85 6. Religion is a co-operative fellowship, an identification of an individual with the groups to which he belongs, so that he seeks corporate as well as personal fulfillment. The Biblical scholar knows how this ideal of religion has been expressed in ideas of the chosen people, the church, and the king- dom of God. Can he help the religious edu- cator to show that it must operate in the family, neighborhood, community, nation, and world family of nations? Can we be specific as to the kind of life which is desir- able and give illustrations of its prac- ticability and attractiveness? 7. Religion has always had special times, places and ceremonies for group celebra- tions. It has developed festivals, holy days, worship, anniversaries, and many means for keeping the focus of attention upon its highest values and goals. It has sought to strengthen the individual by participa- tion in group activities where orientation, meditation, commitment, and re-vitalization are furthered by carefully planned services. 'The Biblical scholar knows how such serv- ices have grown and changed, how stereo- types have lost their meaning, and he may help us in what may be most effective. Can he help the religious educator to plan serv- ices, appropriate to this modern day, ser- vices which may help to integrate and direct the growth of personal-social values and achievements ? These statements sufficiently illustrate the functional meaning of religion. One can readily see that spiritual qualities are being affected by what happens to a child at home, at school, at play, as he listens to the radio, or as he watches a movie. Many forces are influencing his sense of worth, his social sensitivity, his understanding and appreciation of the universe, his feeling as to the reality of and manner of operations of God, his interest in ancient and modern records of human problems and attain- ments, his discrimination and readiness to pay the price for higher achievements, his devotion to the church or loyalty to his family, his satisfaction in worship or regard for the Sabbath. None of us believes that a formal service once a week with most of the language drawn from unfamiliar sources is likely to accomplish very much, where, in- deed, we all share in perpetuating futile forms. Many are giving careful thought to the improvement of these services but some of us feel that that alone- can never be sufficient. We believe that it is necessary to study homes to help parents to function better, to study the systems of general education and to co-operate with leaders in that field, to know more about what is going on in all the varied agencies of our community and to work for higher ideals in every walk of life. When religion is interpreted functionally, along the lines in- dicated, we can see how it is possible to have allies everywhere, and to correct the forces which are hindering the best develop- ment of our boys and girls. This point of view multiplies the tasks of the religious educator and necessitates a broad and care- ful preparation for his work. He must know social psychology, sociology, and pedagogy, and he will not do a religious piece of work without an adequate religious philosophy, psychology of religion, and training in phases of practical ministry. He is expected to be up to date in problems of theology, Bible, church history, ethics, music and worship, recreation, counseling, and a number of other fields. Yet sometimes a religious educator in a church is merely a friendly supervisor of that layman's annex called the Sunday School, and a chore boy for the minister and other officers of the church. Pastors should think of all this work in educational terms and specialists should receive recognition and remuneration worthy of their responsibilities. Instead of the question, "Has the reli- gious educator neglected the Bible ?" it might be fruitful to consider the opposite, "Has the Biblical scholar neglected religious edu-</page><page sequence="4">86 ERNEST J. CHAVE [May cation?" and instead of the third question of our symposium, "Have the special- ists failed the Pastor ?" we might ask "Has the Pastor in his preparation overlooked the specialists, and does he give rightful place to religious education?" There are differ- ent ways of looking at every problem. At any rate while we have the chance to bom- bard both Biblical scholars and pastors may we ask a few more questions which seem related to our total education? I. Does our experience teach us that religion should be emphasized as a per- vasive force operating in all phases of life, and that it should be defined in functional terms so that the religious leader may work co-operatively with people in all types of organized human service? Can we hope to break down the duality of sacred and secular, integrating and unifying life by reli- gion ? 2. Does our experience cause us to want to transcend anthropomorphic concepts of God, and ancient forms of address in hymns, prayer, and ritual? Can we find language which will have regard for our growing knowledge of cosmic forces, uni- versal processes, and human characteris- tics? Can we make use of developing racial experience to build a more realistic and challenging theology and religion ? 3. As far as the Bible may be expected to contribute toward an understanding of reli- gion, and toward the motivation of reli- gious living, has enough research been done so that a few scholars might be released to work on other periods of literature? Are there not other areas of religious literature which ought to be studied intensively? Could some work be done on the evaluation and compilation of contemporary writings? Would it be too much to hope for a day when we might have chairs of ancient and modern religious literature in our seminar- ies instead of Old and New Testament? Would the tasks of religious education and pastoral ministry be served well by such seminary studies? 4. Are Biblical scholars free enough to criticize Bibliolatry? Are they willing to tell lesson writers that they do not honor the Bible, nor recognize the possibilities in religion when they feel compelled to quote scripture to give a teaching religious quality? Will they say plainly that much so-called Bible teaching is nothing more than reading into Bible language and set- ting foreign ideas and precepts? Will they face the total need and think with the religious educator on what Bible study should have in a program of religious edu- cation, and then help prepare suitable guides in Bible study? 5. Will the Biblical scholar help in the practical tasks of defining goals at each age level, selecting the best means for at- taining those goals, appraising outcomes and refining methods, helping to make the church and religion effective forces for inte- grating and exalting all life? Will he use his scholarship, his historical perspective, his well-based faith, and his long-disciplined patience to work co-operatively with his colleagues trying to meet the world chal- lenge of human need? 6. Will the Biblical scholar help us to bring the church back to the centre of community life, to enlarge the concepts and goals of religion, to stimulate the imagina- tion of young people to become religious leaders who can function effectively in a modern world? Will the Biblical scholar and pastor help us to reshape the semi- nary program to train religious leaders for the responsibilities of community, national, and international leadership? Finally, the religious educator has no desire to lay the blame for the shortcomings of religion in this critical hour of need upon either the Biblical scholar or the pastor. He does, however, want to present a hope- ful picture of possibilities for a re-vitalized program of religion in the churches, denom- inations, seminaries, and in the country and world at large. We all assume r6les of (Concluded on page 139)</page><page sequence="5">Religious Educator (Concluded from page 86) religious leadership. Whither are we go- ing? Who values and follows our leader- ship? Is there a better way for specialists to co-operate? Shall we seek to identify the results of religion in the progress of man- kind through the centuries and shall we work more intelligently in the many places where religious qualities show encouraging growth? Shall we follow the example of him who refused to be bound by "Ye have heard it said of old time," and whose vision of "greater things" did not make him fear- ful of leaving the old to achieve the new? 139</page></plain_text>
