<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lin Emery by Philip F. Palmedo introduction by John Berendt Hudson Hills Press, 2012 Reviewed by Deborah Frizzell Lin Emery (b. 1926) is renowned for her kinetic metal sculptures activated by nature's elements, such as wind and water (aquamobiles), and man-made elements such as magnets (magnetmobiles) and motors. She works primarily in aluminum, stainless steel, or bronze, and her sculptures are often polychromed or polished. Lithe and subtle, her kinetic structures suggest biomorphic or anthropomorphic presences in which several shapes or planes approach one other, come into close proximity, alight, and then depart from each another, repeating the cycle in wave after wave of syncopated movement. Yet her sculpture, no matter the scale, retains a unitary integrity, constituting a cohesive structural system. Emery calibrates tension and compression, corresponding to the muscles and bones of human and animal bodies, the bending and twisting combinations of basic push and pull forces in a classic contrapposto, implying that matter aspires to connection. Her sculptures like Pastoral (2009; Fig. 1) move with grace and elegance, revealing the purest examples of elemental structure. Outdoor or indoor, public and private, these installations are responsive to transformations in the light and air surrounding them; they are about fluid movement and change, reminding us that everything is in flux in the micro and-macro realms.

Emery's sculpture captures the essence of Edward Lorenz's "Butterfly Effect"— how the flapping of butterfly wings affects the atmosphere, so that over time, it could cause a tornado. It is no wonder that a physicist, Philip F. Palmedo, has taken an interest in Emery's substantial contributions to the kinetic sculpture movement. Since 1998, Palmedo has written three other monographs on contemporary sculptors—Richard McDermott Miller, Bill Barrett, and Joel Perlman—whose work abstracts form from nature while addressing the body's movement in space.1 This newest effort is a handsome publication with beautiful color reproductions of Emery's oeuvre spanning six decades, from her early years working in the modernist sculptor Ossip Zadkine's Paris studio, to recent projects created in her beloved New Orleans. (This culturally sophisticated and multi-ethnic city, with gritty roots in the shipbuilding industry, has supplied Emery with access to raw materials and technical expertise.) An ardent admirer of Emery's sculpture and an intelligent reader in the history of art, Palmedo follows the trajectory of the artist's life story in conjunction with the development of her sculptural language in a chronological flow. Palmedo offers schematic historical contexts for Emery's modernist influences in the sculpture of Constantin Brancusi, Naum Gabo, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, and Isamu Noguchi. He reviews Emery's basic aesthetic links to as well as her conceptual differences from the kinetic works of Alexander Calder and George Rickey. While Calder's abstract mobiles have playful, organic qualities related to Surrealism, Rickey's geometric forms and machinelike engineering hark back to Constructivism. Emery mingles these stylistic resonances in her large-scale kinetic sculpture, embodying lyrical qualities in sublimated form through geometric reduction; she concentrates the quality of movement generated by her constructions. In addition, Palmedo examines Emery's fascination with learning new technologies and experimenting with materials as well as her prescient awareness of the ways in which technology can transform subjective perceptual experiences. Palmedo emphasizes Emery's ability to match such aesthetic sculptural concerns as proportion, scale, size, o WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="2">configuration, and surface, to the capacity of her materials to withstand stress and endure the corrosions of time and the environment, while engaging a range of expressive, even romantic qualities. For Emery, a particular building method is not merely a manufacturing process but a creative one, not simply a procedure but a discipline. Fîer components are always in motion, often omnidirectional, with modules that build outward from one or more foci, highlighting the rhythms of nature. Most important, Emery's installations are accessible to a diverse audience, attracting and holding the attention of children and adults, artists and physicists! Because she represents and interprets the forms and forces of nature, these typically invisible forces are felt as immediate, bodily experiences, as natural effects, even though they are highly choreographed. Emery creates objects and environments designed to encourage and nurture observation. Although this monograph has laid the groundwork for future study of Emery's work, more remains to be done. Emery's oeuvre, her practices, and the reception of her work in relation to her predecessors and peers in the kinetic art movement and within modernism generally, ideas having to do with seriality, systems, symmetry, and pattern in the early 1960s and 1970s, are yet to be fully explored. Emery's experimentations in kinesis and bodily movement, the modulation of light, atmosphere, and water have been in the forefront of modernism, and deserve rigorous art historical analysis. • Deborah Frizzell teaches modern and contemporary art history and theory at William Paterson University.
