<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rashes Commentary on Genesis 1-6 in the Context of Judeo-Christian Controversy ELAZAR TOUITOU Bar-Ilan University, Israel The exegesis of Scripture in the Middle Ages is not purely an expression of intellectual activity for itself, but essentially a taking of position in regard to the social and religious problems of the time. The evolution of a peshat move ment among Jewish scholars in the twelfth century (the "School of Rashi") is essentially the reaction of the Jews to the Renaissance of this century and to the resurgence of religious controversy between Christians and Jews. The present article develops this thesis and intends to show that Rashi's commentary on Genesis 1-6 contains obvious signs of polemics with Chris tians: 1. The commentary on Genesis 1:1 is the response of Rashi to the conquest of Jerusalem by the Crusaders. 2. The explanation of Rashi to the verse "and the ruah of God moved upon the face of the waters" is intended to counter the identification of this ruah with the Christian Holy Spirit. 3. Rashi's commentary on the story of Adam's sin rejects the Christian dog ma of Original Sin and the prefigurative approach about many details of the story. 4. In his commentary to the creation story, Rashi intends to reject philosophical and theological approaches. 5. Rashi develops a strict angel ology for reasons equally didactic and polemical. 6. Rashi's commentary to the creation of Adam is obviously polemical. Let us try to reconstruct the' Bible curriculum of the institution in which Rashi studied as a child.1 As a child, he studied Biblical vocab ulary in Hebrew together with a vernacular (Old French) translation. The most common textbooks were the local glossaries, of which late cop ies are still available in manuscript form, two having been published in scholarly editions.2 Later on, Rashi would study midrashim (Jewish hom (1) The Jewish sources of the eleventh and twelfth centuries give very little informa tion about Jewish education in Western Christendom at that time. Our attempts at re construction are mainly based on hints and asides in the contemporary literature; see my article "Rashbam's Exegetical Method in the Light of the Contemporary Historical Situation," Studies in Rabbinical Literature, Bible and Jewish History: Dedicated to Professor E.Z.

These would include Bereshit Rabba and other midrashim.3 As Rashi matured and began to teach, the curriculum changed. The Pentateuch was taught not only through midrashim but also together with Rashi's own commentary. It is self-evident that a curriculum reflects a society's needs and aspirations. Thus, a change in the curriculum implies a change in needs and aspirations. We must attempt to answer the key question: What happened at the end of the 11th century which stim ulated the change in the educational curriculum of Franco-German Jew ry? What were the new needs that were not satisfied by the existing cur riculum? This question leads to another: What is the nature and basic approach of Rashi's commentary, and how does it meet its society's new needs? Our third question is: Why did Rashi give his commentary the form which it bears? Our methodological assumption is that medieval Biblical exegesis is not a purely cultural phenomenon completely detached from its histor ical environment. We submit that Biblical exegesis was greatly influ enced by the changes in the society that produced it.4 The commentary is affected by the demands of reality, yet it also attempts to shape reality. The more we know about the historical background to the formation of the commentary, the better we can understand it. Let us now turn to our three questions. The first and third questions will be answered briefly. The second question, which deals with the dif ferent types of commentary and Rashi's methodology, will be answered in detail. This will be done through an examination of several of Rashi's explanations to the early part of Genesis. The last decades of the eleventh century and the whole of the twelfth century witnessed a Renaissance in Christian Western Europe.5 New schools frequently opened as annexes of cathedrals and monasteries, and the number of students increased dramatically. As political bound aries were both uncertain and flexible, students were able to move freely from school to school. Since Latin was common to all students of West ern Europe, knowledge circulated freely. This Renaissance had, of (3) Cf. Rashi's commentary on Genesis 3:8. (4) Cf. J.F.

A new type of intellectual made his appearance. He was characterized by extreme confidence in the ability of man's mind to know and to understand everything.6 How could this confidence be reconciled with obedience to traditional values? Bernard of Chartres propounded his solution in the form of a parable. Truly, he explained, our forefathers were giants and we are dwarfs in comparison to them; however, since we are sitting on the shoulders of giants, we can see fur ther.7 The intellectual energy of the Christians was accompanied by reli gious vitality, primarily expressed through the Crusades. The religious revival left its impression in many spheres and influenced every class in society. Many commentaries on the Bible and works on theological subjects were written, many ecclesiastical buildings were constructed, popular religious customs such as pilgrimages to places which were con sidered holy were extended. The masses played an active part in every cultural event promoted by the clergy.8 Of particular interest is the flow ering of the religious play, which represented Biblical stories and inci dents from the lives of the Church Fathers. The plays were written in French and were an important means of popular education.9 Preaches preached in the vernacular at every opportunity and used their sermons to impart the principles of the Christian faith in a popular manner to their listeners.10 It was only natural that the Christian sages would discuss subjects on which they took issue with the Jews and that literature was designed to satisfy internal and external needs simultaneously: it both strength ened the faith of the student clergy and prepared them for debating with Jews if necessary.11 Indeed, the character of religious polemic in this rich and tumultuous age changed significantly.12 (6) For further information about intellectuals in the Middle Ages, see L. le Goff, Les intellectuels intellectuels au moyen-âge (Paris, 1957).

Inten sive Torah study was common in Jewish communities prior to this pe riod, but there is no doubt that the Renaissance was felt at all levels of Jewish society. Jews and Christians were neighbors, spoke the same language, traded with each other, and exchanged visits on weekdays and probably even on festivals.'3 I assume that in addition to the busi ness and social ties between Jews and Christians, cultural links also ex isted ('culture' in the Middle Ages meant 'religion' and 'sacred books'), and that these links were far more extensive than is generally believed or reflected in the rare contemporary evidence. As a result of these social and intellectual connections, or perhaps of the Zeitgeist, there are significant parallels in Jewish and Christian approaches to Biblical exegesis, education, and teaching. It is worthy of note that literal Bible commentary flourished in both Christian and Jewish circles at the same time. It is also noteworthy that the influence of the incipient rationalist approach to Bible commentary on both Chris dans and Jews was most evident in the last thirty years of the eleventh century. This form of commentary reaches its peak in the twelfth cen tury, declining towards the end of that century in both Christian and Jewish circles. We find Jewish parallels to lectio divina, questio, disputatio, and collatio. The Jewish kara is apparently the Christian lector. The search for undistorted Biblical texts and the great interest displayed by scholars in the grammar of the sacred tongue in that particular period were common to both religions.'4 Although we do not encounter Bernard of Chartres' parable about dwarfs on giants' shoulders in the writings of the French rabbis,'5 we do find many expressions of intellectual self-confidence. Rashbam, for instance, claims that: "Whoever wants to understand the real meaning of these verses will be enlightened by my commentary; my predecessors did not understand them at all.'"6 The Jews were threatened in their religious faith.

Urbach's opinion that the commentator is R. Yosef Kara, a younger contemporary of Rashi, seems tenable. The commen tator says, "Although my mind absorbs their words and my heart is aflame to err after them, even so Your closeness is my good."18 The mind is convinced by the words of the Christian neighbors who strongly tempt him to "err" and follow their ways. Only that special feeling of closeness, which is the God-given privilege of the Chosen People, keeps the Jews Jewish. The danger of Christian influence on the Jews was, therefore, very real. In this context, Rashi's appeal to Israel's best minds to enlist in the fight against external temptation is very understandable. Rashi writes on the Song of Songs, 7:8—10: And And And let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine — confirm my words, and do not be tempted by the non-Jews. Let the best minds and wisest men amongst you stand up for their faith and answer the tempters, so that the younger generation may learn. And the roof of thy mouth like like the best wine — make sure that your answers be like the best wine. That glideth down smoothly for my beloved — I am careful to answer them in order to remain steadfast.... I make you swear — The Jewish entity speaks up against the nations, however much I complain and lament, my lover (God) holds my hand and sustains me in exile, therefore I make you swear, ... though it will not help you. From the end of the 11th century, the leaders of the Jewish com munity were confronted by two important challenges: to meet the chal lenge of the Renaissance spirit and to create a defense against the threat of growing Christian vitality. However, it does seem that the French rab bis took the spiritual-religious contest with the Christians very seriously — and it was a contest and not just polemics. Christian scholars quote Jewish commentaries in their works without, unfortunately, explaining how they reached these sources.19 The Jews make very few references to these encounters.20 (17) Cf. Arugat Habosem, ed. E.E. Urbach (Jerusalem, 1947), Vol. 2, p. 220. (18) On R. Yosef Kara and his involvement in the Jewish-Christian polemic, see A.

On Rashbam's encoun</page><page sequence="6">164 ELAZAR TOUITOU [6] Rashi not only issues his clarion call: he also provides the answer. His commentary to the Pentateuch was a contribution to his people at a time of transition. Rashi understood that studying the Pentateuch in the traditional manner no longer satisfied the intellectual curiosity of his generation. He therefore undertook a new commentary to the Pen tateuch. This was a very complex task. No Franco-German Jew had pre ceded Rashi in this matter. Among the Christians, the situation was dif ferent. Christian scholars of the generations before Rashi had prepared selections from the commentaries of the Church Fathers for their stu dents' use — selections, not collections.21 The external presentation, in eluding continuity, non-citation of sources, and the reworking of the language of patristic sources, resemble Rashi's commentary. Was Rashi familiar with these works, or had he perhaps heard of them as a possible model for a Jewish commentary to the Pentateuch? I do not know, but the hypothesis certainly merits our attention. Rashi explained the principles of his commentary in a comment to Genesis 3:8: There are many homiletical explanations which our Rabbis have arranged in Bereshit Rabba and other midrashic collections. I came only to present peshuto shel mikra and to bring only those aggadot which resolve the words of the verse and its shmu'o22 as a word fitly spoken. This is a famous statement which has recently been analysed thoroughly by Sarah Kamin.23 Scholars have paid particular attention to the second part of the statement, "I came only ...," which describes Rashi's ap ters with Christian scholars, see my article "The Method of Rashbam in his Commentary on the Halakhic Part of the Pentateuch," Millet 2 (Tel-Aviv, 1984) 275—288. (21) Cf. G. Dahan, "L'exégèse de l'histoire de Cain et Abel du Xllème au XlVème siècle en Occident," R.T.A.M. 49 (1982) n. 7. (22) Our version differs slightly from that of Berliner in his second edition of Rashi's commentary to the Pentateuch (1905). In his first edition (Berlin, 1867) Berliner mentions another version, which he decided not to reproduce. Our version is based on several man uscripts and early printed editions. The key word is u-shmu'o 'literally'. One can under stand the importance of this word through a comparison with a commentary to another verse: "For a bribe blinds the eyes of wise men (Deuteronomy 16:20) — in Pentateuchal law. You say in Pentateuchal law, but perhaps only the eyes of wise men ki-shmu'o? [literally]. We learn ..." (Mekhilta of R. Yishmael, Mishpatim, 82, Horowitz-Rabin edition, p. 328) See also E.Z. Melamed, Bible Commentators, Vol. I (Jerusalem, 1975), p. 370. Rashi uses that same term in his comment on Genesis 33:20. (23) See S. Kamin, Rashi — The Literal Meaning and the Homiletical Meaning of the Bible (Jerusalem, 1986), pp. 62-76 [Hebrew]. Kamin makes use of the Berliner version (without using the word u-shmuo), although she is aware of the existence of another version (p. 63, n. 23).</page><page sequence="7">[7] RASHl's COMMENTARY ON GENESIS 1-6 165 proach, but the first part of the statement should not be neglected. The rabbis arranged the midrashic explanations; i.e., the aggadot were ar ranged by subject following the order of the Pentateuch. The collections remain the classic textbooks and Rashi refers his reader to them, "if you are interested in more detail and greater depth, you may refer to these collections." "I," continues Rashi in the same statement, "have only come to present ...". Peshuto shel mikra is the immediate literal meaning of the verse, its primary aspect,24 whereas for the clarification of the ideology, beliefs, and opinions which are to be found in the Torah, Rashi relies on a selection of the sages' midrashim. Rashi did not attempt to produce an independent literal commentary to the Pentateuch, but his avowed intention is to cite a selection of midrashim which explain the verses according to the peshat. The commentary would be traditional: Rashi did not undertake to invent any new explanations, yet he success fully satisfied the demands of the new intellectuals, who were interested in a literal commentary. Thus, Rashi's commentary is neither "a com promise between literal commentary and derash" as Lipschuetz claims, nor is it "a confusion of the two" as Poznanski claims; but it is, rather, an avowed homiletical commentary as Abraham Halevi Bakrat con eludes in his Sefer Zikkaron.25 This was Rashi's aim. Different scholars, who claim that he failed, are mistaken.26 Rashi found himself at a turning point betweeen the past and the future, between tradition and reason (auctoritas and ratio of the Latin authors). In the context of the history of French Bible commentary, one can say that Rashi's approach legitimized literal commentary without af fecting the importance of derash. Among Rashi's pupils, some, such as R. Yosef Kara and Rashbam, would devote themselves to literal exegesis, whereas others would continue to turn to derash. The latter remained anonymous, and their commentaries may be found either as interpo lations in Rashi's commentary itselP7 or as separate appendices to Rashi's commentary.28 (24) We follow Kamin's opinion. See Kamin, op. cit., p. 134; also reproduced in other parts of her book with slight changes. (25) Cf. Sefer Zikkaron, ed. M. Phillip (Petah Tikva, 1980), p. 53. (26) These definitions of Lipschutz and Poznanski's opinions and the conclusion that Rashi "missed the mark" are taken from Moshe Greenberg's article "The Relationship Between the Commentaries of Rashi and Rashbam to the Pentateuch," Sefer Seligman, Vol. 2 (Jerusalem, 1983), pp. 559-567 [Hebrew].

What remains is to consider how he presented his commentaries which served as a response to the minim, i.e. the Christians.29 In order to answer the Christians, one must be acquainted with the principles of their faith. Did Rashi have access to the religious literature of his Christian neighbors? Scholars have linked this question to anoth er: Did Rashi know Latin? — since medieval Christian literature was written in Latin. Very few scholars have felt that they can answer this question with a definite affirmative. Isaac Baer found in Rashi terms which had been borrowed from Latin legal literature.30 Another schol ar, Arieh Grabois, claimed: "Rashi attested that he studied Christian Biblical exegesis."3' However Yehuda Rosenthal demonstrated that the term which served as the basis for Baer's thesis occurs in rabbinic lit erature and that Rashi derived it from there and not from Latin sourc es.32 Grabois' claim is rightly dismissed by David Berger, who states that it rests on hasty conclusions.33 At this stage it is preferable to admit that we are unable to answer this question with an unqualified affirmative.34 Rashi, indeed, observes in different places in his commentary on the Bible that the specific observation was intended as a response to Chris tians. From where did he derive his knowledge of Christianity? Rosenthal rightly observes that Rashi had two major sources of infor mation: rabbinic literature and discussions with his Christian neighbors. Rosenthal also demonstrates that Rashi was familiar with various details of Christian ritual.35 It is likely that Christian neighbors used to visit the first half of the fourteenth century) and other essays.

Christian iconography, "the most powerful auxiliary of thought"37 was there for all to see, including Jewish passersby. Was Rashi aware of it? He does not say so, perhaps because of "an old rule of discretion observed by most Jewish writers of the Middle Ages and the Renais sance."38 It seems to us that we should add a third source of information which other scholars have overlooked. In addition to Christian literature writ ten in Latin, France witnessed the development of a literature written in the vernacular.39 It was mostly made up of translations from the Latin but, as time passed, original essays were written. Daniel Poirion, a spe cialist in medieval French literature, regards translations from the Latin as a dominant feature of the period.40 Through translation, French speakers were able to read books in different disciplines. The books were mostly on religious subjects. The Bible was translated in its entire ty, or almost in its entirety, into French. We have excellent French trans lations of the Book of Psalms. The translations were made, however, at the beginning of the 12th century, toward the end of Rashi's life, or even after his death. Poirion's statement, nevertheless, seems reason able: "Une histoire de la lecture médiévale, fondée sur la date des manuscrits, s'éloignerait beaucoup d'une histoire de la création littéraire."41 Among the books which were written at that time we will refer to the Elucidarium as an example.42 The book was written as a dialogue between a teacher and his pupil. The pupil's questions are concerned with Christian religious topics, such as the creation, angelology, original sin, the Antichrist, etc. The book was written to train student priests and to help them as priests in their work with their parishioners. Schol ars describe the work to Honorius Augustodunensis, who lived in the late 11th to mid-12th century. He was a pupil of Anselm of Canterbury. (36) Cf. Responsa of Rashi, ed. I.

The book was very popular and was translated and edited many times. We may assume that this book, or works with similar content and approaches, may have been acquired by French Jewish scholars in the vernacular version. There is no reason to talk about a language barrier: French Jews knew French. David Berger contends that: When Jewish works, for example, refute Christological interpre tations that are found only in Christian commentaries and not in polemics, we have reason to suspect that the Jewish authors got the information from a literary source.43 His assumptions seem reasonable but it should be pointed out that the source could have been available either in Latin or in French. In short, we may conclude that Rashi certainly had access to contemporary Chris dan literature. Did Rashi take advantage of the opportunity to read Christian writ ings? If so, did he find it necessary to refer to them in his commentaries? Rashi's writings do not give an unambiguous answer to this question. One should, however, pay special attention to those places where Rashi refers to the minim. Rosenthal rightly assumes that for Rashi, the term minim minim means the Christians of his time.44 These references are few and far betweeen and do not provide a sufficient basis for the assumption that there is an anti-Christian tone to Rashi's commentary. Several schol ars have pointed out that Rashi warned against conducting disputations with the Christians.45 Shereshevski refers to the apostate Herman of Co logne in this context. Herman claims that Christological commentaries to certain part of the Bible persuaded him to convert.46 A real danger presented itself and Rashi preferred that disputations between Jews and Christians not take place. Senior ecclesiastics also expressed their oppo sition to disputations with the Jews on more than one occasion.47 Dis (43) Cf. D. Berger, op. cit. n. 68. (44) Among the proofs adduced by Rosenthal, two are worthy of particular interest: "Minim"Minim are the pupils of Jesus of Nazareth who denied the words of the living God" (Rosh Hashana,Hashana, 17b) and in Tractate Sota, 49b: "... those who are seduced by the error of Jesus and his pupils, are called minim." These quotations do not appear in standard editions of the text because of censorship. (45) Cf. E. Shereshevsky, "Rashi's and Christian interpretations," JQR 61 (1970—71) 76; Y.

Contrary to popular belief, the ini tiators of the disputations were not always Christian. On more than one occasion it was a Jew who challenged his neighbor to a disputation.48 Rashi's comments to the Mishnah of Rabbi Elazar (Babylonian Tal mud, Sanhédrin 38b) reveal a practical knowledge of the art of dispu tation. R. Elazar teaches, "make an effort to learn how to answer an heretic".49 Rashi explains that "one must know how to answer a heretic who bases his apostasy on the Torah." The Talmud continues and dis tinguishes between a non-Jewish heretic and a Jewish heretic. The latter is worse, since, according to Rashi, "he knew the Jewish religion and rejected it, he will be very much more meticulous and it will be very much harder to convince him." He also comments, "the heretics are corrupt — and they justify their corrupt faith from the Torah." The heretics, i.e. the Christians, justify their religion through Jewish sources. The Jew must learn Torah for polemic purposes. Rashi, thus, approaches disputation from two directions: the need to try to avoid being involved in a disputation, but at the same time, the necessity of preparing oneself well for that eventuality. His commen tary to the Bible illustrates his position well. It pays very little attention to Christian claims. He apparently ignores them completely. On the oth er hand, his comments include a Jewish response to many Christian be liefs. A survey of recent research on Rashi's commentary with reference to the Judeo-Christian controversy seems to reinforce our viewpoint. Rosenthal found that several comments by Rashi to the Book of Prov erbs were clearly of a polemic nature, although Rashi did not say so openly.5" Shereshevsky points to a large number of references in Rashi's commentary to Psalms which answer Christian claims either overtly or covertly.51 Although Rashi does not admit it openly, Sarah Kamin has demonstrated that his commentary to the Song of Songs includes "par allels and contradictions ... to the Christian exegesis of the Song of were responsible for the decrease in literal Bible commentary among Christians at the end of the 12th century.

Abraham Grossman believes that "R. Yosef Kara's commentary to the Bible attacks Christological commentaries more openly than those of Rashi and Rashbam ... (but) R. Yosef Kara concealed his polemic objectives and motives and it is not always easy to reveal them."53 We have also found that in many of Rashbam's comments to the Torah and in his methodology, his reaction to the Jewish-Christian controversy is very apparent.54 It seems to me that Rashi's commentary on the Cre ation shows a similar approach: there are very few direct or open ref erences to the Christians, yet he offers comments which are potentially useful for anti-Christian polemic. In his treatment of the first six chapters of Genesis, Rashi refers to the opinions of Gentile commentators five times, three times openly, and twice through hints. The open references are in his comment to Genesis 1:1, "If the Gentiles will say to the Jews ..." and Genesis 1:26, "There is room for minim to overrule ... and the answer to the minim is written in the continuation." and in Genesis 6:6, "And this is my an swer to the minim". A concealed reference is to be found in Rashi's ex planation of the nature of Adam's sin. We will treat the subject in more detail. Furthermore, in five separate places in his commentary on the creation, Rashi makes clear his opinion regarding the time of creation (1:1,(1:1, 6, 14, 24 and 2:4). It seems that Rashi's emphasis implies that the commentary was written in response to the different opinions which Christians expressed about the creation. Spicq, a specialist on medieval Christian Biblical exegesis, discovered that Genesis, together with Psalms and the Song of Songs, were the books most commented on prior to the eleventh century. "The book of Genesis satisfies all curiosity about the sources of the world and Man ... for the bible [wrote Scotus Erigena] knows everything and tells everything."55 The awakened awareness of nature and its laws, which was one of the features of the 12th-century Renaissance, stimulated interest in Genesis. Spicq contin ues in a footnote: "The 12th century established the Book of Genesis as the required text for the theology of the cosmos ... in view of the Hexaemerons which were written at this time."56 In the story of the Cre (52) Cf.

Let us now examine six subjects from Rashi's commentary to the be ginning of Genesis: 1. Rashi opens his commentary to the Pentateuch with Rabbi Yitzhak's question: "He should have started the Pentateuch with 'This month shall be unto you the first of months' (Exodus 12:2), which is the first commandment Israel received, and why did he start with 'In the beginning?" The mysterious Ambrosiaster asked a similar question in the fourth century: "Quare legem non in primordio dedit?"57 and it was repeatedly asked by different Christian commentators of the Mid die Ages. Rashi's answer is that the Torah wished to emphasize that the Jewish people's right to the Land of Israel is derived from the will of the Creator. D. Louys recently suggested that this comment was written as a reaction to the First Crusade.58 This Crusade aimed to liberate the Holy Sepulchre from the heretics, and its success presented Judaism with a serious theological challenge: The conquest of the Land of Israel by the Christians was interpreted as additional proof that God had re pudiated the election of Israel, and as additional confirmation of the validity of God's new covenant with the Christians, the real Israel, the spiritual Israel. Rashi's answer was intended to emphasize that Israel's right to the Land remained unaffected by fleeting historical events, since this right was based on God's will. 2. When was the world created? The story of the Creation in the first two chapters of Genesis presents difficult linguistic and theological problems for the commentator. What is the syntax of the phrase 'In the beginning ... ?' The content of the first verse contradicts the de scription of the creation of the heavens on the second day and of the earth on the third day. There is no reference to the creation of darkness, of the waters, the wind, the angels, etc. Yet all the above appear in the Torah. Jewish scholars discussed all these problems and offered many different solutions. Rashi offers a novel solution: "The Bible did not intend to show the order of creation. All the forces of nature were ere ated on the first day and activated at their destined time." Rashi starts (57) Cf. G. Bardy, "La littérature patristique des questiones et responsiones sur l'Ecriture Sainte", Revue Biblique 41 (1932) 343. On Ambrosiaster, cf. A. Souter, A Study of Ambrosiater (Texts and Studies VII, b; Cambridge, 1905). (58) Cf. D. Louys, "En lisant Rashi," Vav — Revue du Dialogue (Paris, 1969).</page><page sequence="14">172 ELAZAR TOUITOU [14] with a negation, "The Bible did not intend ...followed by the positive statement, "all the forces of nature, etc." One can only deduce from the literal sense of the verses at what stage each part of the creation was set in its place, and no more. Rashi refused to offer Biblical legit imization for any speculations about the cosmogony, neither those of the Jewish midrash nor those of the Christian scholars. Whoever wishes to explore the mystical aspects of the creation refer to Sefer Yezira and the other midrashim, but will find no answer in the Biblical verses them selves. The literal interpretation of the story of Creation is in accordance with the Jewish law expounded in the Mishnah tractate Hagiga (1:1): "Two people should not study the mystical aspects of the story of ere ation together." Rashi used very few midrashim in his commentary to the story of Creation, many fewer than was his custom in his commen tary to the rest of the Pentateuch. Those comments that are preceded by the words, "as our Rabbis explained," or "as explained in Bereshit Rabba,"Rabba," etc., are not regarded by Rashi as midrashim which resolve dif ficulties nor did he see them as straightforward explanations. One may summarize the point and conclude that Rashi's intention was to remove the literal form of the story of Creation from the bounds of the various schools of mysticism. The verse in Ecclesiastes 7:23, "I said, I will get wisdom but it was far from me," is explained by Rashi: I I said, I will get wisdom — to know wisdom, what it is. Far — the far things which were at the time of creation. It is very deep — and who who can find it? I am not allowed to meditate about what is above and what is below, what is before and what is behind. This approach was later to be developed by Rashbam, but Rashbam's justification of the avoidance of mysticism which appears in his commen tary to Ecclesiastes is somewhat different.59 3. "And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." (Gen. 1:2) Both early and later commentators were puzzled by this verse. What is the meaning of the word ruah (it can mean both 'spirit' and 'wind') when it is associated with God? And what is the meaning of "moving upon the face of the waters"? Our sages explained the verse in two dif ferent ways. In Hagiga 12a, Rabbi Yehuda is quoted as saying in Rav's name that the winds were one of the ten things that were created on the first day; although from the context it is not clear if Rav was re (59) According to Rashbam, there are two types of wisdom, "regular wisdom, without depth, which the world needs ... and the remaining deep wisdom, that men do not need and do not generally study, the wisdom which I cannot understand and explore — for example, the merkava (the Divine Chariot) and the sefer yezira (the Book of Creation)."</page><page sequence="15">[15] RASHIS COMMENTARY ON GENESIS 1-6 173 ferring to the 'wind' that we are discussing. In Bereshit Rabba 2:4, we find a saying of Rabbi Haggai in the name of Rabbi Pedat (which is connected with the different midrashim) which refer to our verse. The term obviously refers to the natural force, the wind. There are also other midrashim midrashim which regard 'the Spirit of God' as a spiritual phenomenon. In Bereshit Rabba 8:1, Resh Lakish explains the verse in Psalm 139:5: "Forwards"Forwards and backwards You formed me" — backwards to the last day and forwards to the first day, for Resh Lakish said: the Spirit of God which was moving was the soul of Adam, for it is said "and the spirit of God rested upon him" (Isa. 11:2). In another midrash, also in Bereshit Rabba 2:4, Resh Lakish explains the verse in an eschatological manner: Resh Lakish explained the verse (Gen. 1:2) by kingdoms: 'and the arth was waste' — that is Babylon ... 'and emptiness' — the Medes ... 'and darkness' — the Greeks ... 'on the face of the waters' — this current evil empire. 'The spirit of God moving' is the spirit of the Messiah according to the verse (Isa. 11:2). 'And the spirit of God rested upon him', how is it that we deserve this coming upon the water? Through repentance, which is compared to water, 'pour out your heart like water' (Lam. 2:19). In the next midrash, we find the mystical story of Ben-Zoma, who said: I looked at the act of creation and the distance between the upper waters and the lower waters is no more than two or three finger breadths and the verse does not say that the spirit of God "blew", but that it "hovered", like a bird flying and flapping with its wings, his wings touch and do not touch. Rashi uses neither the first explanation, that ruah means 'wind', nor the midrashim midrashim of Resh Lakish. His explanation is that: "The spirit of God moves — the royal throne stands in the air and is moved over the face of the waters by God's breath and His word, like a dove hovering over his nest." Rashi's early researchers found it difficult to identify his source; even Berliner's suggestion is farfetched. Rabbi Kasher's solution in his TorahTor ah Tor ah Shlema seems more feasible. He ascribes it to Midrash Shoher Tov (Psalms 93:3): The The The floods have lifted up, 0 Lord — Rabbi Berachiah said in the name of Ben Azai (Ben Zoma): The waters were rising up and reaching God's Throne as it is written, "The Spirit of God is moving upon</page><page sequence="16">174 ELAZAR TOUITOU [16] the face of the waters" and he also says: "as an eagle appears over his nest and hovers over his nestling." (Deut. 32:11)6° There is a feeling of mythology in this midrash. The next midrash quoted in Shoher Tov tells how the waters in their arrogance tried to wash away the whole word but were defeated by God's rebuke. Why did Rashi choose such a little-known source? This midrash does not give a more satisfactory explanation that the other midrashim] it dies, however, have one advantage — it ensures that the Spirit of God cannot be identified with Christianity's Holy Spirit. 4. Angels play an important role in the world of monotheistic belief: they are, so to speak, God's representatives on earth. The frequent ap pearance of angels in the bible indicates that within the Biblical worldview the existence of angels is beyond doubt and, thus, for me dieval theologians, beyond controversy. The debate concerns the nature of angels, their identity, their functions, their date of creation. While primitive Christianity was much concerned with this subject, it soon be came relatively peripheral. In the second half of the 11th century, how ever, angels again became the focus of discussion. Many Christian the ologians, for some generations after, devoted space to an exposition of their angelologies.61 Angels played an important role in the Jewish world as well.62 Rigorous Jewish monotheism, however, faced a sharp theological problem: cannot these heavenly beings be understood to be partners of God in the creation of the world and its governance? Rashi was an exegete, not a theologian. Hence, a systematic angel ology was not required of him. Nonetheless, his commentary to Biblical texts in which angels are mentioned is worthy of special attention. To the chief question 'When were the angels created?', there is no infor mation explicitly given in the Bible; yet Rashi, commenting on Gen. 1:5, found it necessary to express his view. Rabbinic tradition provided four options:63 1) Angels pre-exist the creation of the world. 2) They were created on the first day. 3) They were created on the second day. 4) They were created on the fifth day. The proponents of these views (60) Rashi may have used a midrash which is unknown to us. However, the identifi cation of the Spirit of God "moving upon the waters" with the Throne of Glory is to be found in the Koran (Sura 11, verse 9), which also makes use of Jewish midrashim.

Rashi writes: One One day (Gen. 1:5) — according to the language of this section it should have been written "the first day", the other days are qual ified second, third, fourth, etc. Why does it say "one"? Because God was one (i.e. alone) in His world, for the angels were not ere ated until the second day. So it is explained in Bereshit Rabba. The comment invites careful scrutiny. The creation narrative in the first two chapters says nothing of angels: why does Rashi introduce them here? To be sure, Rashi's question (why the cardinal number?) is legit imate at the level of peshat as well. It is doubtful, though, whether his answer is peshat. The closing reference to Bereshit Rabba also merits our attention. The citation lays bare Rashi's tendency, insofar as the text presents a dispute rather than a uniform position. R. Yohanan, basing himself on Ps. 104:3-4, states that the angels were created on the second day, R. Hanina holds they were created on the fifth day, utilizing Gen. 1:20 combined with Isa. 6:2. But the principal point of the midrash is the con elusion of R. Yitzhak, the disciple of R. Yohanan: Both according to R. Hanina and according to R. Yohanan it is agreed that none (of the angels or active beings) was created on the first day, that you should not say Michael was pulling in the south and Gabriel in the north and the Holy One, blessed be He, was stretching in the middle etc. Not only did the angels not assist with the creation; they did not even exist at that time. It was this last inference that Rashi wished to bring home to his audience. Rashi's tendency becomes clearer in his commentary to the visit of the 'men' to Abraham (Gen. 18—19) ar1c' to the story of Jacob's struggle with the adversary (Gen. 32:30). Rashi consistently seeks to deny the angels' autonomy or independent identity. The angel promises Abra ham a son at the same time next year when he states "I will return unto you ..." Rashi notes with precision: The angel did not promise him that he would return; it was but the mission of God that he was fulfilling, as it says: "And the angel of God told her: I will multiply thy seed ... (Gen. 16:10)" He has no power to cause increase, but in the mission of God he told him this.</page><page sequence="18">176 ELAZAR TOUITOU [18] We have no midrashic source for this comment; it originates with Rashi who wished to stress the absolute dependence of the angels on God. Even their choice of language is determined by Him. When the angels display a slightly independent streak, telling Lot "we will destroy this place" (Gen. 19:13), they are compelled, as punishment, to concede "I cannot do a thing" (19:22). As Rashi explains: "This is the punish ment of the angels because they said 'we will destroy', making it depend on them, therefore, they did not move from there until they were com pelled to admit that it was not in their power." A reading of the Biblical text shows that Rashi, in a sense, twisted the angels' words, since 'we destroy' is followed by "God had sent us to destroy it." Nor does Rashi's comment to v. 22 appear to be peshat, for the statement "I cannot do a thing" manifests not the angels' dependence, but rather his consid eration for Lot. In any event, it was more important for Rashi to further his idea than to adhere precisely to peshat. Another sign of Rashi's meth od here is that this comment (the punishment of the angels) originates with Rashi, and was not derived from the sources (Bereshit Rabba 58:9 and 68:12) whence he drew the notion of the angel's arrogance. An angel has but a single mission; that missing being fulfilled, he withdraws (Gen. 19:1). Moreover, the insubstantiality of the angels is so complete that they lack even a persisting name. Jacob wants to learn the name of the 'man' with whom he wrestled, only to be asked: "Why do you ask for my name?" (Gen. 32:29), meaning, according to Rashi: "We have no persisting name, our names change according to the mis sion on which we are sent."64 It appears to me that Rashi developed this strict angelology for rea sons equally didactic and polemical. He wished to demonstrate to his enlightenment-hungry contemporaries that there was no place for all those angelological beliefs which arose from peripheral Jewish midrashim and from those popular Christian works which had begun to circulate at that time both in Latin and in Old French. We know, for example, that Honorius Augustodunensis, in his Lucidarium, deals with the topic of angelology.65 He stated that the angels were created on the first day, have free choice, have persisting names, and are ranked hierarchically. (64) Later scholars — perhaps Rashi's pupils — very correctly explain the intention of Rashi's commentary אין לך בידיעת שמי כל תועלת כי אין הכוח, והיכולת כלתי לה' לכדו, אם תקראני לא אענך ומצרתך לא אצילך (Hize Menashe [London, 1908] בשביל שלא יאמרו העולם פלוני המלאך עשה זה, והוא אינו אלא שליח.

Migne, Patrologiae Latinae, CLXX1I, col 1119.</page><page sequence="19">[19][191 RASHl'S COMMENTARY ON GENESIS 1-6 177 These views and their like certainly reached the ears of the Jews, and it was in opposition to them that Rashi wrote his commentaries. Rashi's angelology can be further explored through his commentaries to Gen. 5:24 (the disappearance of Enoch) and the story about 'the sons of God'66 (Gen. 6:iff.). Rashi states unambiguously that Enoch was a human being, righteous to be sure, but flesh-and-blood rather than an gelic. His 'taking' by God is interpreted by Rashi in precise detail so as to eliminate any misunderstanding. The text is somewhat mysterious: "And Enoch walked with God and was no longer for God had taken him." Rashi explains, alluding to Ezek. 24:27, that 'taking' is synonymous with death, with the addes signification of premature death. If so, "God had taken him" means "removed him and caused his death prematurely." "Was no longer" along these lines also means: "is no longer in the world to fill out his year." The only element that is absent from the verse, and which Rashi supplies to make his interpretation plausible and com plete, is the reason for the 'taking'. "He was righteous but prone to turn to evil, therefore He was quick etc." With this approach Rashi rejects all midrashim which attribute to Enoch a quasi-angelic nature and to his 'taking' a trans-human translation. It appears to me that he is also re jecting Christian interpretations and particularly that which sees the dis appearance of Enoch as a 'foreshadowing' of the Resurrection dogma.67 The story of the "sons of God (elohim)" who take the daughters of men as wives is, of course, one of the primary sources for belief in "fallen angels" which occupies a central position in official Christian angelol ogy.68 Rashi stresses: "Sons of elohim — sons of ministers and judges" (Gen. 6:1), i.e., human beings, not angels. Rashi goes on to demonstrate that the Hebrew word elohim contains the fundamental meaning of dom inance, citing as proof Ex. 4:16 and 7:1 where human beings are called elohim elohim relative to other people — Moses vis-à-vis Aaron, and Moses vis à-vis Pharaoh, respectively. The sons of elohim in our story are later called nefilim and 'men of renown'. Rashi takes care to interpret nefilim (66) On the Jewish legends about these stories, cf. L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews (Philadelphia, 1913), Vol. I, pp. 124-127, 130-140, and cf. notes 58-60 for the Christian interpretations, Vol. IV (Philadelphia, 1925).

It is unnecessary to emphasize the centrality of Adam and Eve's sin in Christian dogma. This narrative is the major source for the dogma of Original Sin. Jesus is the 'new Adam' who atones for and liberates mankind from the old Adam's sin. Furthermore, Christians saw in the details of the story a foreshadowing of that which Christ himself was to undergo: Adam sins on Friday afternoon —Jesus is crucified on Fri day afternoon. Adam is cursed with thorns and thistles —Jesus purifies the thorns which became his crown.70 Rashi does not declare any polemical intent here. His commentary to the narrative appears only to address problems of structure and lan guage, as is appropriate to a peshat exegesis. The resolution of these problems, to be sure, is derived from rabbinic midrash, but it is after all Rashi's proclaimed approach to cite midrashim that resolve the Biblical text. Thus, one can understand Rashi's commentary to Adam's sin with out referring to the non-Jewish background, and this is the way it is generally understood. At one point only, it seems to me, Rashi's selection of a midrash appears arbitrary, and this arbitrariness lays bare the com mentator's tendency. However, once that tendency is discovered it sheds light on other detailed features of the commentary to the chapter. "And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the wind of the day" (Gen. 3:8). We have already quoted Rashi's com ment. Rashi had valid reasons for attaching his comment to this verse. The verse is rich in meaning and offered Rashi the opportunity of using his two kinds of commentary. "And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden" is interpreted literally: "They heard the voice of the Holy One for the Holy One was walking in the garden." This explanation is anthropomorphic, but Rashi was convinced that this was the literal meaning of the verse. Several generations later, the scribes and printers were bothered by the anthropomorphism and 'improved' the text; but the many extant manuscrits leave no doubt as to the orig (69) Printed texts of Rashi, including Berliner's, and many MSS contain an additional comment: "Another approach: sons of elohim are the ministers (éarim) who fulfill God's mission; they too mingled with them." Berliner already noted that several MSS have shedim 'demons' instead of sarim, also, the Leiden MS does not document this comment at all. We may add that neither does Oxford Heb. MS 2440. Munich Heb. MS 5 contains it at the end of the entire verse, i.e. as an appendix. All of this indicates (in the light of my analysis in Tarbiz 56, supra n. 27) that it is not by Rashi. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the angelological interpretation of the word nefilim here andin Numbers !3:33 's missing from several MSS. (70) For the Christian sources of the details of this story, cf. M. Alexandre, op. cit.; for the idea Adam/New Adam, p. 324; for the Friday afternoon, p. 43 and p. 306; for the purification of the thorns, p. 321.</page><page sequence="21">[21] RASHl'S COMMENTARY ON GENESIS 1-6 179 inal version. For the phrase "in the wind (Hebrew: ruah) of the day", Rashi reproduces an aggada which 'settles' the midrashim passage in a fitting manner: "Le-ruah ha-yom — in that direction to which the sun travels, which is the west, for towards evening the sun is in the west and they committed the sin in the tenth hour." Rashi's explanation is a combination of a midrash from the tractate Sanhédrin 38b, together with a midrash from Bereshit Rabba. We find two opinions in Bereshit Rabba.Rabba. The first is that quoted by Rashi. The second is that the verse refers to an easterly wind which blows in the morning. It would be dif ficult to determine which of the two explanations is preferable. Rashi used the first of the two midrashim in order to emphasize that Adam and Eve sinned at the tenth (of the twelve) daylight hour. This emphasis was necessary both for polemic and exegetical reasons. Original Sin is a basic Christian dogma. Anselm of Canterbury devoted one of the ma jor chapters in his theological work to this dogma. Honorius, his pupil, presented it in a popular manner. Let us compare Honorius' explana tion of the story of Adam in paradise to that in Sanhédrin which Rashi utilised. Sanhédrin Sanhédrin Lucidarium R. Yohanan bar Hanina said: the The student: How long were they day was twelve hours long. In the in the garden of Eden? The teach first hour his dust was collected, in er: Seven hours. Student: why no the second the body was formed, longer? Teacher: Because the in the third the limbs were woman betrayed them shortly af stretched out, in the fourth the ter she was formed. In the third soul was inserted into the body, in hour after his creation, Adam gave the fifth hour he stood upon his names to the beast, in the fifth feet, in the sixth he gave names, in hour the newly-formed woman the seventh he was united with sunk her teeth into the forbidden Eve, in the eighth two went up on fruit and offered it to her husband the bed and four descended, in and he ate it out of love for his the ninth they were commanded wife, resulting in their expulsion not to eat from the tree, in the from the Garden of Eden by God tenth they sinned, in the eleventh at the end of the eighth hour, they were judged, in the twelfth he was expelled. Thus, according to the midrash, Adam remained in the Garden twelve hours, whereas the Christian version reckons eight hours. The differ ence of four hours expresses the radical difference between the two the ological outlooks. The Jewish view is that Adam had intercourse with</page><page sequence="22">180 ELAZAR TOUITOU [22] his wife Eve, and that she conceived and gave birth before the sin. There is no connection between the sin and the birth. What is more, Adam and Eve's children, who were born before the sin, are not 'stained' by their parent's action and do not need atonement. Many Christian the ologians claimed, however, that "sexual intercourse and original sin are identical." Anselm himself maintained that, "wherever there is a natural birth, there is a transfer of the original sin'"71 and only he who was born from an unnatural birth is capable of atoning for those who are stained by Adam and Eve's sin. Rashi did not need to read Anselm's work to be acquainted with this basic Christian belief; he knew it through his Christian neighbors or through some popular French book, and he used this midrash to show that there is no Biblical evidence for this belief. Rashi will reinforce his view in his commentary to Gen. 4:1 and 5:1. In his comentary to 4:1, Rashi attacks the famous Christian phrase "in paradiso virginitas, extra nuptiae," writing: And And the man knew — already before the events related above, before he sinned and was driven out of the Garden of Eden. So also the conception and birth. Had it been written וידע אדם it would imply that after he was driven out the children were born to him. Rashi found in the Biblical sentence והאדם ידע את חוה אשתו a textual proof for his commentary. We would normally expect to find וידע אדם את חוה אשתו, i.e., a grammatical form which expresses the succession of actions in story, and what we discover instead is והאדם ידע, a pluperfect use, which emphasizes that Adam had known his wife before the previous episode, before the sin and the driving out from Eden.72 In his commentary to Gen. 5:1, Rashi stresses once more: "In the day that God created — this states that on the day when he was created he begot progeny." Let us now turn to other aspects of the story. Rashi develops the idea that the story of Adam's sin is not an independent literary unit but an episode introduced parenthetically into the story about the naming of names: And And the serpent was more subtle (3:1) — What connection is there be tween the following narrative and the statement just made? The latter (chapter) should have been followed by "and He made for Adam and his wife garments of skin and clothed them" (3:21), but (71) Cf. Dictionnaire de Théologie Catholique, Vol. 12 (Paris, 1g33), p. 438. (72) Rashbam implicitly used the same rule to explain that Esau received an amount of money as his birthright, not a pottage of lentils. This explanation would be used by Jews against the Christian argument for the dishonesty of Jacob. Cf. Sefer Yosef Ha-mekane, ed. Y. Rosenthal (Jerusalem, 1970), para. 16, pp. 40-41.</page><page sequence="23">[23] RASHl's COMMENTARY ON GENESIS 1-6 181 Scripture informs you with what plan the serpent assailed them: he saw them naked and he coveted her. This idea is important enough for Rashi to warrant repetition at the end of the narrative: And And the man called (3:20) — Scripture now reverts to its previous topic "and the man gaves names." It broke off only to teach you that through the giving of names Eve became his mate ... but because Scripture writes "and they were both naked" it therefore follows on with the passage dealing with the serpent, to inform you that because he saw her nakedness and that they displayed no feeling of shame in their actions etc. ... In other words, the story of Adam's sin is subordinate to that of naming. It was introduced here to 'teach' proper behavior. Its purport is didactic rather than theological. It warns us against lack of shame in our private lives. It shows us the danger of adding to God's commandment ("do not not touch it — by adding to the command she detracted from it."). It teaches that God conducts Himself according to the principle of 'mea sure for measure': "Shrewder than all the animals — according to his shrewdness and greatness was his dawnfall; shrewder than all, cursed of all." It is also possible to find in Rashi a clear tendency to relax the stringency of Adam's punishment. The 'thorns and thistles' which the earth will grow (v. 18) are "artichokes and cardoon which are fit for food after preparation," and even this curse is abrogated after ten gen erations, with the advent of Noah (Rashi to 5:29, s.v. ze yenahamenu). Adam's sin therefore left no imprint on his descendants. So too the day of the sin — Friday — does not commemorate in any way the episode of the serpent. To be sure, it is distinguished by the Biblical text as 'the sixth day' (i.e., with the definite article, as opposed to the other days of creation). But this distinction is one of honor: it alludes, according to Rashi, to the sixth day of Sivan, the day upon which the people of Israel, in accepting the Torah, will justify the existence of the world. 6. It is hardly necessary to mention the fundamental theological dis pute between Jews and Christians regarding the interpretation of the phrase "let us make man" (Gen. 1:26). It reverberates through the Tal mud and Midrash and the early Church Fathers. Here Rashi explicitly deals with the Christians. He cites Bereshit Rabba and a comparison be tween his language and that of the Midrash is instructive.</page><page sequence="24">[24] 182 ELAZAR TOUITOU blessed be He, said to him, 'Moses, as to this man whom I am going to create, will I not bring forth both great and unimportant de scendants from him? It is so that if a great man has to get permis sion from a lesser person and says 'Why in the world should I have to get permission from an unimport ant person?' people will say to him 'Learn a lesson from your creator, who created the creatures of the upper world and the creatures of the lower world, but when he came to create man, went and took counsel with the ministering an gels'." Rashi Let Let us make man — although they did not assist Him in forming him (the man) and although this may give the minim an occasion to over rule, yet the verse does not refrain from teaching proper conduct and the virtue of humbleness, namely, that the greater should consult and take permission from the smaller; for had it been written "I shall make man," we could not, then, have learned that He spoke to His judicial council but to Him self. And as a refutation of the minim minim minim minim it is written immediately af ter this verse "And God created the man" and it is not written "and they created." Rashi sharply abridged the midrash, thus oudining even more clearly his own exegetical elaborations and additions. The midrash takes it for granted that the creation of man is exclusively the act of God. Rashi stress es: "They did not assist Him in the creation." The moderate phrase "You give an opening to minim" becomes in Rashi's hands: "this may give the minim minim an occasion to overrule." This is definitely belligerent language. The verb lirdot appears in the very same Biblical text: "rule over (redu) the fish of the sea, etc.", where Rashi explains: "This word has the sense of over ruling and the sense of descent. If he merited, he overrules (radah); if he did not merit, he descends lower (yarod) and is dominated by the !)east." It is difficult not to regard Rashi's phrasing as an expression of the ex</page><page sequence="25">[25] RASHl'S COMMENTARY ON GENESIS 1-6 183 istentialistential seriousness he attributed to religious debate, in which the winner rules it over the loser. Again, the midrash concludes in a general way "learn from your Creator", while Rashi specifies "to teach proper conduct and the virtue of humility." Rashi deviates from his custom and justifies his view by explaining why the verse could have said "I will create" without causing misunderstanding. The last sentence in Rashi completes the mid rash rash by adding a sentence drawn from another source. In addition to the interpretation of the verse in itself, Rashi is also set ting down a principle: the purpose of the Torah is to educate us to virtue. The verse we are discussing represents an extreme case, for here the To rah seeks to achieve its didactic aims at the risk of opening the door to corrupt theological views. Nonetheless, character formation takes prece dence over world-view. If we reread Rashi's commentary to the story of the creation, we will indeed recognize that this is the primary purpose of the Torah in this section. It does not say "and it was good at the end of the second day" to teach us that "an unfinished action is not in its full ness and goodness."73 Rashi carefully compares command and execution with respect to the creation of the trees and grasses (w. 11-12) to teach the value of precise obedience to God's instructions. The creation of the sun, the moon, and the stars is an object lesson in humility (16, s.v. ha meorotmeorot ha-gedolim) and forbearance (s.v. ve-et ha-kokhavim). There are many facets to Rashi's achievement and to his personality. This study intends to reveal a neglected one: Rashi's responsiveness to the needs of his generation who stood perplexed before the spiritual awakening that begun to affect Western Europe, and which historians have come to call 'the twelfth-century Renaissance'. On the recondite subjects with which Genesis begins, Rashi proposed a commentary based on peshat and a scrupulous selection from Rabbinic midrash. In the course of this oeuvre he presented a Jewish position in the Jewish-Christian debate. Many relatively controversial topics are discussed in the com mentary, though not all those raised by the Christian theologians. For Rashi is, in the final analysis, an exegete rather than a systematic the ologian: he does not address a subject unless the Biblical text invites his comment. Moreover, Rashi maintained that the Torah's principal aim is not to present a theology but to educate man to the acquisition and exercise of virtue. (73) Jerome found here, among other things, an allusion to the negative nature of the number 'two': "The number two is no good because it divides the unity and prefigures the covenant of marriage." Cf. Jerome, Ep. 49, 19 = Adv. Jov. I, 6, quoted by M. Alexandre, op. cit., p. 113.</page></plain_text>
