<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE ROLE OF EQUALITY AND INEQUALITY IN THE HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS By R. C. H. TANNER THE following essay is adapted from one with the same title read to the British Society for the History of Science on 20 October I958- the anniversary, by a striking coincidence, of the birth of W. H. Young (i 863- I 942). To his memory I dedicated the talk, and now rededicate its publication, not only because I am his daughter and of all that means, but because he invented a method, the method of monotone sequences, which shows the powerfulness of inequalities as a mathematical tool supremely.' In I 63 I, twenty-five years after Shakespeare died, eleven years before Newton was born, Walter Warner, mathematician and philosopher, gave out in print the Algebra of Thomas Harriot,2 his Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes resolvendas. This is the work in which our modern inequality signs are used for the first time in their modern sense, the left-hand pointing arrow-head &lt; to mean 'is less than', the right-hand pointing arrow-head &gt; to mean 'is greater than'. Today these signs are indispensable to the mathematician. To us it appears obvious that here was one of the happiest conceits in the history of mathematical thinking. So much have the signs become merged with the ideas, that even for the printers we have no other name or description for them than just the inequality signs, 'the less than' and 'the greater than'. So ingrown have these symbols become, that they are apt to turn up with only slight modifications whenever a hierarchy exists similar to that established by inequality relations: for instance, informally, as shorthand, to denote 'before' or 'after' in time, or to mean 'implied by' and 'implying' in logic, or to signify 'contained in', 'included in', and the converse, in set theory. That is to say that for a relationship of this kind no better symbol can now be imagined than essentially those devised by Thomas Harriot. Better than any other, they suggest to the modern mind the type of relationship, and the very characteristic standing in logic, that inequalities embody. Thomas Harriot did not, of course, invent mathematical inequality. Neither did Robert Recorde3 in I557 invent equations, by initiating our equality sign =. Famous inequalities are rarer than famous equations I Cp. R. C. H. Tanner, 'W. H. Young et la methode des suites monotones', Actes Soc. helv. sc. nat., 1960. 2 Thomas Harriot, b. Oxford, 1560, d.

TANNER in the history books, and are not always easy to disentangle. They are not listed in tables of contents or indices, as a rule. We have to start at the beginning and read on from there until, without any preamble, some result or some proof is given that involves 'greater than' or 'less than', and not just 'equal'. This happens even in textbooks, books on 'what is mathematics', and introductions to pure and applied mathe- matics. Equality and the rules of the equality sign are clearly set out at the beginning. But most often inequality is taken for granted suddenly in the body of the work. This curious anomaly is consistent with the different status which the two notions have in ordinary everyday usage. Introductions to mathematical logic are meticulously careful to point out that the 'equal' sign represents 'is' in its one most precise common meaning, and to discard, by examples, the other, imprecise, meanings. They do not, and do not have to, do the same for the inequality signs. Parallelism here is complete. The mathematical meaning of 'less than' and 'greater than' coincides with its everyday meaning, their mathematical character is already latent in their linguistic use. This gives a plausible psychological explanation for a discrepancy at first sight hard to credit. But it only shows up this discrepancy in even stronger relief. For by the same token it is through its inequalities that mathematics has its deepest roots in the thought of everyday. Their mathematical content is, in point of fact, not merely latent, in a passive sense, in common usage: it is active in precisely the guise wanted for the mathematician. Any people possessing comparatives in their language, whether in single or multiple word form, will already be implicitly conversant with the whole apparatus required for inequalities in mathe- matics. John is taller than Mary, Mary taller than Dick: so John is taller than Dick (a&gt;b, b&gt;c imply a&gt;c); John and Mary together are taller than Mary and Dick together (a +b&gt;b b1+c); Mary is shorter than John (b&lt;a). What could be more ordinary?4 The layman may be surprised into echoing Moliere's Bourgeois gentilhomme:S 'For over forty years I have been speaking prose without knowing it!' and exclaim 'So we have been doing mathematics all our lives without knowing it!' The echo is more than suggestive: inequality is the prose of mathematics, equality, equations are its prose. History of literature has long since ceased to be primarily a history of poetry. 4 A language in which comparison is possible only through an extremely cumbersome form of circumlocution might be expected to provide correspondingly less ready access to basic mathematical notions. A remarkable example is cited by A. French, Math. Gazette, I962, xlvi, 177, of a seemingly supremely anthropomorphic African language, in which two compared entities have always to be assimilated to two human rivals. Even such extreme metaphorical phrase-forms of comparative, however, still embody the required hierarchical structure. The development of mathematical notions in the Bantu context would appear to offer a fruitful field for research. 5 Le Bourgeois gentilhomme, Ist ed., I67I, Acte II, Scene iv, Monsieur Jourdain: 'II y a plus de quarante ans que je dis de la prose sans que j'en susse rien.'</page><page sequence="3">Equality and Inequality in the History of Mathematics i6i For the historian of mathematics, a corresponding change of emphasis is needed-a change of emphasis which can be carried through right up to present times. For inequality is not merely at the foundation of mathematics, and indispensable today: it is probably by far the most important tool in the workshop of the mathematician, and the most responsible for shaping mathematics as we now know it. An account of these matters might well be founded on Professor Hobson's classical comment in his little book, Squaring the Circle, of I 9 I3.6 Writing about the evaluation of7r by the ancient Greeks, he says (p. I8): 'The method by which Archimedes and other Greek mathematicians contemplated limit problems impresses one, apart from the geometrical form, with its essentially modern way of regarding such problems. In the application of the method of exhaustions and its extensions no use is made of the ideas of the infinite or the infinitesimal; there is no jumping to the limit as the supposed end of an essentially endless process, to be reached by some inscrutable saltus. This passage to the limit is always evaded by substituting a proof in the form of a reductio ad absurdum, involving the use of inequalities [my italics] such as we have in recent times again adopted as appropriate to a rigorous treatment of such matters. Thus the Greeks, who were however thoroughly familiar with all the difficulties as to infinite divisibility, continuity, etc., in their mathematical proofs of limit theorems never involved themselves in the morass of indivisibles, indiscernibles, infinitesimals, etc., in which the calculus after its invention by Newton and Leibnitz became involved, and from which our own textbooks are not yet completely free.' The three phases of our subject are here clearly contrasted: ancient, transitional, modern.7 It is fascinating to observe how the Greeks, without any symbolism to help them, were able to grasp so thoroughly the implication and power of inequalities. This takes us right back to Eudoxus,8 the precursor of Euclid and Archimedes, the first to resolve the impasse in which Greek mathematicians found themselves on discovering by bitter experience the fallacy of arguing from the finite to the infinite or infinitesimal. His strict theory of proportions is infused, throughout, with inequality considera- tions, from the basic postulate and the indirect definition of equality for the ratio of two quantities, to the applications, particularly in approximating to the circle by means of inscribed and circumscribed regular polygons. Corresponding approximation procedures in the mathematics of Babylon, Egypt and India, while not positively proved to be of greater antiquity, were probably independent, notably the method of the arithmetic- 6 E. W. Hobson, b. Derby, I856, d. Cambridge, 1933. 7 The word 'medieval' is inapplicable in its usual sense as we want to include the inception of the infinitesimal calculus, with Newton and Leibniz. The 'Middle Ages' thus have to be extended by the characteristically transitional periods called Renaissance (c. 1400-I540) and Early Baroque (o550-i650) in J. E. Hofmann's pocket Geschichte der Mathematik (Goschen Bd. 226, I953), precisely the periods that interest us most here. 8 Eudoxus of Cnidus (?408-?355), whose works are known only by report, and who had a period in Egypt after a short time with Plato, later returning to Athens with his own School. 5</page><page sequence="4">I62 R.

TANNER geometric mean of the Babylonians,9 which Archimedes set out in its proper inequality form as the approximation formula (in excess) for the square root of a number in terms of the difference between that number and the nearest known convenient square below it in value, V/(a'+B) &lt; a+B/2a in modern notation. In applying this and the rigid inequality methods of Eudoxus, Archimedes and his followers were guided by the same hard-headedness as made them refuse to admit zero as a number. This hard-headedness, however, also saved them from the admixture of mysticism of which Professor Hobson complained as having retarded and still polluting the infinitesimal calculus and the development of modern real number theory; and it was in fact a flight from just such a perverted outlook, of which they knew the danger, as he points out. A striking impression of the incidence of inequalities in the significant work of the period may be gleaned from J. E. Hofmann's Geschichte (loc. Cit., pp. 27-38) or van der Waerden's Science Awakening.I' Even more suggestive is the late nineteenth-century edition of the Works of Archimedes, by J. L. Heiberg,"' where the Latin translation, facing the original Greek, is invaded by the modern algebraic symbols x, +, :, &gt;, &lt;. The very first to appear is &gt; (greater than) on p. 14, Bd. I. Inequalities are on every succeeding page until p. 25, where the sign + (plus) is first found. The sign = (equal) is first shown on p. 3I. In every case the original Greek has, of course, the verbal equivalent in full. Passing to the second, 'transitional', phase, we find the Archimedean standpoint firmly maintained, an inexhaustible source of applications and refinements, in closer and closer evaluations of irrational numbers and geometrical lengths, areas and volumes, and, most important, in a wealth of algebraic and trigonometric inequalities such as are constantly in demand today in theory of functions and series. The value of the two- sided inequality, giving an explicit estimate of the 'error' in an approxi- mation, was already specially noted. Just how clearly the implications were recognized is not certain, whether of the old principles or of the innovations. The admission of negative numbers into the number scale remained very halting; Stifel12 first saw them as all less than zero. But negative solutions of equations were still taboo. The chief characteristic of mathematics of this period before the advent of the Calculus is, however, the appearance of symbolism. And here it is of some, though passing, interest for our topic to note that the 9 The main evidence appears to be in two texts, one in Paris (Seleucid period?), the other in Berlin (Ancient?). Cp. F.

Robert Recorde, in using the same symbols algebraically, associates, almost in punning vein, the idea of 'more' to the sign with 'more' to it (+) and that of 'less' to the sign 'lacking' something (-), to help in remembering which is which. Another point to note, in conjunction with the initial neglect of Harriot's inequality signs (to which we shall return) is that the wealth of other inequality signs tried out by contemporaries testifies to the growing consciousness of inequalities at that time. Without this consciousness, the major invention of the period, that of the Calculus, could scarcely have been made. It did not need the inequality signs: Newton and Leibniz made their discovery without them. Newton and Leibniz were of an intellectual stature adapted to thinking in pure abstractions. But not everyone can be a Newton or a Leibniz, and their researches would never have blossomed out as they did without much more ordinary mathematical workers in the field. We may even reflect that the infusion of medieval mysticism which then supervened, as deplored by Hobson, had some appreciable effect in helping to launch the Calculus at the outset. The theory of relativity also was furthered in its early stages by philosophical interpretations now discarded as fallacious. The modern phase of the history of mathematical inequality as illustrated by the passage quoted from Hobson properly begins with the theory of limits first clearly formulated by Cauchy.I4 A limit relation is neither more nor less than an infinity of inequalities. From a practical standpoint they represent 'approximations', but in strict theory they may be not just an approach to something 'already there': they may be the only reality we have to deal with, a definition in themselves, or, from another point of view, the evidence that there is something there. This is the hard fact that the textbooks Hobson refers to try to fight shy of. Whatever names or notions we may choose to graft on to such data, the fact remains that the inequalities are their essence, and must be brought back into play in any applications. Entities that mask their inequality status abound in modern mathematics. There were, of course, always expressions that did so until translated into mathematical symbols, such as 'positive', 'negative', 'bounded', 'acute', 'obtuse'. In recent times, however, a number of notational innovations came to be made, e.g. for the Lipschitz condition, Lebesgue integrability, orders of infinity or infinitesimal, embodying 13 Cp. R. C. H.

TANNER inequality without the inequality form, and using instead the equality sign in a manner flagrantly violating the dictum of the logicians, that the left- and right-hand sides must be interchangeable. This the '=lim' of limit notation does not do, and it is innocuous in comparison. In the new usage, the equality sign reverts to the imprecise common meaning of 'is'. As can now be seen, the background was the realm of functional analysis-to-be; the symbol for a class was made to do duty also for the adjective designating membership of the class, and '=' stood for 'is a member of', today written as a Greek epsilon-a modification of the 'inclusion' sign (the 'less than' rounded off at the tip), but subject to none of the laws of algebra for equality, or even inclusion. The custom certainly first started as a mere personal shorthand. The motivation for perpetuating it in print may very likely have been a small and very mundane fact: the advent of the commercial typewriter as a prerequisite for printing, and the acceptance of the ready-made. In this respect the device was a master-stroke, by-passing the pitfalls of symbolism inserted by hand, and even, once the inequality signs had been added to the common keyboard, their maddening capacity for getting interchanged. At the same time there was brewing a revolution far more significant in the history of mathematical inequality than the slight local malpractice in a specialist field of research. The same reasons of expediency may well have been operative, but without the compromise. The logical conclusion of a flight from the inequality signs was a flight from inequalities: and this in effect took place, at the two extremes of the contemporary mathematical scene. At school-level, where a chapter on inequalities had formerly been included in the syllabus, this was now exscinded from algebra books of all nations in turn. This unfortunate retrogression is now gradually being again reversed. At the threshold of advanced research, algebraization has meant, implicitly, the preferment of the algebra of groups and of all sections of mathematics that can be exhibited as of the same pattern: inequality has no status comparable to equality, and wherever possible, inclusion supplants it. Yet a glance at the current mathematical literature in most languages would show the inequality sign as much in possession as ever. Unlike school mathematics or new theories being systematized, this is mathematics still in the making. Here lies the key to the relationship between equality and inequality in mathematics, between its poetry and its prose. Mathematics is founded on inequality, the commonest thing in the world. But the kind that mathematicians most pride themselves on, finished mathematics, mathematics for show to the public, is presented as much as possible in equality form. There is a thrill, even for the smallest school child with a mind for the matter, in recognizing that two apparently different numbers are equal. This thrill remains with the mathematician throughout his</page><page sequence="7">Equality and Inequality in the History of Mathematics I65 life. It takes him out of the atmosphere of ordinary doings into just that realm of precision and paradox which makes mathematics so separate, so safe from the vulgar crowd. And also so hated. By overstressing the achievements in terms of exact equations, mathematicians with the best will in the world have surely alienated sympathies which now, so late in the day, we find ourselves very much in need of. Inequalities are much nearer the ordinary man, so-called! Of course, they have an unfinished appearance, and nearly always leave more questions open than they resolve, until they are 'rounded off' and given their final polish by an accompanying equality, which 'closes the door'. But this equality tells only part, a small part, of the story. An equality indicates a boundary, but we are really concerned with what lies inside and outside. By ignoring this simple fact, people get such a distorted view that they conceive absurd heresies like the old one that mathematics is just 'one grand tautology'. An exact equality is like a fine ceremonial dress, beautiful for show, an end-product, never a beginning. Inequalities were in the mathematical workshop from time immemorial and remain the most precious of tools. The history of mathematical workmanship must give a much larger place to them than mathematicians themselves perhaps would like to admit, judging by the pains taken to cover up this part of their technique. The setting of the history of mathematical notation provides a most interesting commentary on these matters. Few would maintain that symbolism was the most important feature of mathematics,'5 but psychologically it is as significant here as in other branches of human thought. The dearth of mathematical signs before the Calculus contrasts with the amazing proliferation since, which continues now at an exponential rate. At the divide between the dearth and the proliferation stand Harriot's inequality signs. They came as successors to a few symbols used at first purely as stand-in for words, the numerals to begin with. The history of mathe- matical notation starts there and has little else to show in thousands of years. Then came the plus and minus signs of the end of the fifteenth century, relating to operations still arduous by the standards of the times, and extremely so with Latin numerals (or Greek). The far simpler fact of equating one entity with another took another good half-century to symbolize. And inequality as much again. The history of mathematical ideas has to reverse this order, going back in time far beyond the first symbolism of numeration, and from the most primitive and deepest-set ideas of more and less proceed to equality as neither more nor less,'6 then to adding and taking away, and finally I5 Such cannot have been the intended meaning of R.

TANNER to counting, and the great illumination in the naming of definite numbers. At that point the need for symbols makes itself apparent, and slowly works back from the most artificial notion to the most primitive and natural. In the meantime, the parallel development of geometry from shapes had evolved its own signs by imitating the shapes, numerals having also originated by imitation of a set of things. Symbols were simply reminders of the things they represented, and had to be as like those things as possible. There was at first no obvious way of carrying on this technique of imitation for more abstract mathematical ingredients such as opera- tions and relationships. The equality sign is probably the first to introduce a more remote principle of suggestion. The Welshman, Robert Recorde, in the Whetstone of Witte (I557) writes as follows: 'And to auoide the tediouse repetition of these wordes: is equalle to: I will sette as I doe often in work use, a pair of paralleles, or Gemowe lines of one lengthe thus: - because noe .2. thynges, can be moare equalle.'I7 Recorde draws his two lines horizontally of equal length rather longer than is now customary. Geometers used the same sign to indicate parallelism between two straight lines, as is still done, but with the lines vertical instead of horizontal. For Recorde, the equal length of the two indicators is an important feature, so that the two are similar in every respect. Historians who have overlooked this explanation imagined that here was yet another corruption of a written word, namely the Latin est. This theory probably greatly antedates the logicians' identification of the 'equal' sign with 'is' mentioned earlier. Recorde made his suggestion quite plain and reasonably acceptable to the English reading public to which he addressed it. When his sign was adopted by Newton and Leibniz, rival equality signs even on the Continent no longer stood a chance. (See Cajori, loc. cit.) In the Artis analyticae of Harriot (published, as already mentioned, in I63I), we read as follows: 'Comparationis signa in sequentibus vsurpanda Aequalitatis ut a b significet a aequalem ipi b. Maioritatis - ut a _ b significet a maiorem quam b. Minoritatis - ut a b significet a minorem quam b.' There seems to be no vindication, explanation or even claim to originality. What Harriot had in mind is, however, plain. He took the equality in Recorde's sign to reside not in the two lengths, but in the '7 It appears from Cajori, History of Mathematical Notation, Open Court, La Salle, Illinois, 1928, vol. i, p. 298, p. iiI and figure 53, p. I29, that the two parallel dashes as symbol of equality appear in a manuscript in the Library of Bologna, conjectured to be lessons of Pompeo Bolognetti, who died in 1568. The discovery was by Prof. E. Bortolotti.</page><page sequence="9">Equality and Inequality in the History of Mathematics I67 unvarying distance between the two parallels. This idea he modified in the simplest way to show on which side lies the larger value. If we ask why the explanation is lacking, and whether that could be a significant cause for the neglect his suggestion suffered for a con- siderable time, we come to what seems to me, humanly speaking, the most interesting aspect of the history of inequalities in mathematics, the aspect that centres on Harriot himself. When Thomas Harriot died in I62I, he had published one book, and not a mathematical one. It is the famous Report on Sir Richard Grenville's expedition on behalf of Sir Walter Raleigh: 'A brief and true report of the New-Foundland of Virginia' (1588). This book had made Harriot famous throughout Europe and is described today as one of the earliest statistical surveys -on a large scale ever written. Harriot had been engaged by Raleigh as mathematical Tutor in his household, and was sent on the expedition expressly as Surveyor. Afterwards Harriot was taken up by Henry, Earl of Northumberland, and allowed a pension of ?300 a year. This must have been a very comfortable income in those days, and enabled Harriot to devote himself to researches in mathematics and more especially in astronomy with a good deal of experimental work on optics and the like. When he succumbed to cancer of the nose in I62 I, there was a considerable mass of papers taken charge of by his two execu- tors and divided between them. But nothing was done with them, and it is doubtful that even the Algebra would ever have appeared in print but for Walter Warner being hard up. Walter Warner was another of the mathematicians in the circle of Harriot's patron the Earl of Northumberland, and when Harriot died he had the bright idea of asking the Earl whether he could have Harriot's pension. The Earl agreed, providing he published something suitable from Harriot's papers. Warner did this, without giving out his own name as the editor, however. With this the Earl was content, as probably seemed just, when Harriot's Algebra proved an outstanding success. Wallis, in i685, claimed that it made Harriot the founder of Cartesian mathematics. This of course annoyed the French. Such is the setting of Harriot's invention of the inequality signs. The first point is then that he never prepared his Algebra for publication himself, so that we do not know whether he would have tried to vindicate his invention. On the other hand it must have seemed obvious to his contemporaries that an inequality sign would have to be a modification of the equality sign, and Harriot could assume this. When Leibniz experimented with inequality signs himself, he went directly to Robert Recorde's explanation, kept the two indicator lines parallel, and made one shorter than the other: - majus, - minus. To get the idea of more or less you had to read upwards. Other suggestions show a degree of arbitrariness that would have appeared as senseless to Harriot as it</page><page sequence="10">i68 R. C. H. TANNER does to us now, and there is no reason to suppose that he ever imagined his sign would have to contend with the like: Oughtred (I574-i660) suggested C* and f in I647; Reyhers, in I698, -1 and F-; Girard, in I629, even more incredibly, ff and ?. Herigone's 3/2 and 2/3 hardly rank as signs. The second point is Harriot's failure to publish any mathematical works at all. His friends' warnings and exhortations appear to have made no special impression, unless to make him feel more acutely whatever inhibition it was that held him back. It has been supposed that he suffered from permanent ill health. But the only evidence adduced is in one letter to Kepler in i 6o6, where he excuses himself from answering some searching questions without delay, on the score of ill health. But in the subsequent exchange this plea is not repeated, although the questions are still unanswered, the excuse this time being excess of business due to the death of a mutual friend. The evidence would rather suggest that any ill health Harriot suffered from was of nervous origin, just as in a case that is in some ways parallel, that of Darwin. It has recently been suggested that Darwin's poor health was actually favourable to the cause of his doctrine, because his followers defended it much better than he would have done himself. The difference is that Darwin lived to see his theories widely accepted, while Harriot was never to know his main claim to immortality. The final point I should like to make is that Harriot's wording in introducing his signs, and the derivation, which I am I think rightly ascribing to them, distinguish them fundamentally from Recorde's. They are presented as mathematical signs, not just as a means of avoiding tedious repetition. Since Harriot made no attempt to teach the signs to anyone, he had designed them for his own private use. They must have done for him what they do for us today, and helped him to think clear. He had proved himself an excellent expositor. If he felt unable to give an equally clear account of his researches, it was no doubt because they were not so concrete and visible before him. He was the first to discover that algebraic equations may be factorizable; we are surprised that he did not see farther than positive roots and so did not complete his discovery. He must have been dimly aware of gaps of this kind, to have held back from publishing all his life. The impression grows that here was just an ordinary mind with a love for the fashionable intellectual pursuits of his day, with the characteristic practical mathematical bent of the British and the British genius for simplicity and relevance. Apart from national rivalries which were rife at the time, the whole spirit of continental mathematicians was different. The correspondence with Kepler well illustrates this-Kepler, the younger man (I57I-I630), urgent, argu- mentative, schoolmasterly, even though in the friendliest manner, Harriot sheltering behind his disabilities, avoiding argument, or</page><page sequence="11">Equality and Inequality in the History of Mathematics I69 meeting it by a statement of fact, by numerical evidence. In the absence of a more detailed study of the manuscript remains that may be available, I like to think that the much-quoted passage in Harriot's reply to Kepler is not a mere ad hoc excuse as Kepler took it to be, but does represent a true cry from the heart, when he laments 'Mihi moles tum sit, vel scribere vel accurate de aliqua re cogitare et argumentari'; and just because he often found it hard either to write or think accurately on any subject or to argue about it-the signs he used to help him in his mathematics have proved themselves an incomparable item of mathematical equipment precisely where it was most needed. We are supposed to be a non-mathematical nation, just as we were once regarded as a non-musical nation. I have a theory that the opposite is true. Inequality is so deeply part of mathematics that it is taken for granted and one hardly thinks of pointing out that it had to be given a symbol in order to become safe and simple to use. Our mathematics also is so deeply assimilated that it is taken for granted. We don't see the fun of simplification and systematization until the less fundamentally mathe- matical-minded insist on it. That is why the decimal system leaves the majority of us cold. It seems to me that this sort of antithesis has always stood between us and Continental mathematics, and is the chief obstacle Harriot encountered too, and of course Newton.</page></plain_text>
