<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FIGURATIVE QUALITY IN JEREMY TAYLOR'S HOLY DYING Should anyone wish, in a single work of Jeremy Taylor's, to find warrant for his title, "The Shakespeare of English Prose", he must consult the pages of Holy Dying. Taylor's priestly character is there unfolded in its complexity and range, in its full picturesqueness and beauty. In no other composition did he so successfully exemplify the principle that the true man of let ters can be relied upon not only to detect inherent resemblances among things apparently remote, but to establish the validity of his findings through effective simile and metaphor. In a treatise inspired by the contemplation, through the eyes of a devout and aesthetically sensitive clergyman, of the transition from this world to the next, it is, indeed, scarcely strange that the constant spectacle of bodily and spiritual metamorphosis should induce a wealth of happy imagery. Nor is it from the mere felicity of Taylor's figures that one derives a clear impression of graphic energy and charm. In selection and use there are a catholicity of taste, a universality of reaction, a sheer magnificence of sweep from largest to small est, which proclaim breadth of poetic vision no less than depth of poetic feeling. Edmund Gosse, who is distinguished among Taylor's biographers and critics, declares that "he examines nature with near-sighted eyes", supporting the point by his alleged indifference to the mountains of Wales and to the "great outlines of the countryside". Even in Holy Dying, there is, it must be admitted, comparative apathy towards what a mod ern observer would call landscape effects. Foliage in the mass, the green undulations of hill and meadow, the aspiring mountain peak and the frowning promontory?all of these, recurrent in the prose of later generations, are virtually wanting in Taylor. The statement that he is near-sighted needs, however, some qualification. For his eye travels; it has, in fact, an unmistak able predilection for large and open space,?for space, prefera bly, above and beyond the earth. There are moments, it seems, and many of them, when his vision pleads for untrammelling,</page><page sequence="2">Figurative Quality in Jeremy Taylor's "Holy Dying" 489 when his spirit craves the prospect of great cosmic stretches. For the profound and terrible experiences of the human soul he can then find, in the inanimate universe, no adequate parallels except the awesome phenomena of the sky and air. Construed in the language of science, his artistic sense then abounds in the realms of astronomy and meteorology. The heavens, the clouds, and the winds comprise, in fact, the sources of an appreciable proportion of Taylor's figures. His mind, like that of the psalmist, discerns Divine Majesty through unattainable distance and boundless expanse. "What tempts the pride and vanity of ambitious persons," he declares, "is not so big as the smallest star which we see scattered in disorder and unregarded upon the pavement and floor of heaven." "God hath scattered the firma ment with stars," he says later, "as a man sows corn in his fields, in a multitude bigger than the capacities of human order." In the heavens by day, as well as by night, Taylor discovers rich suggestiveness. The eyes of the dying man are "dim as a sullied mirror, or the face of heaven when God shows His anger in a prodigious storm." This anthropomorphic league of Divine ret ribution with the celestial moods is, perhaps, the more striking when it stands in comparison with the more tender observation that prayer "moves God to pity, piercing the clouds, and mak ing the heavens, like a pricked eye, to weep over us, and refresh us with their showers." The glory of sunrise, too, had stirred his imagination, producing a daring simile: "The blood of the healthy man is brisk and coloured like the first springing of the morning." Mists and vapors symbolize obscurity and confusion. "Every morning creeps out of a dark cloud, leaving behind it an ignorance and silence deep as midnight." Although sickness is a "cloud", Taylor bids his reader reflect that when a good man dies,? "it is but a little while that the face of the sky was black, like the preparations of the night, but quickly the mists were torn and rent, the violence of thunder parted them into little portions, that the sun might look forth with a watery eye, and then shine without a tear." The imagery of Holy Dying often implies, also, the imaginative querry: "Who has seen the wind?" If Taylor has not seen it,</page><page sequence="3">490 The Sewanee Review his attentive ear has at least caught, its subtle murmurings and its clamorous warnings. Men's joys, he is confident, "converse with the winds"; the grace of their virtues "must be softened with storms and showers. ' ' For interpretative detail and distinct poetic melody the following is notable among prose passages:? "For so have I known the boisterous north wind pass through the yielding air, which opened its bosom, and appeased its violence by entertaining it with easy compliance in all the regions of its reception; but when the same breath of heaven hath been checked with the stiffness of a tower, or the united strength of a wood, it grew mighty and dwelt there, and made the highest branches stoop, and make a smooth path for it on the top of all its glories." Closely interwoven with his reverence for ethereal space is Taylor's keen perception of the properties of light and moisture. The cleansing and comforting functions of water, the rejuvenat ing virtue of light address themselves incessantly to his fancy. God's mercies descend upon charitable people "like the dew upon Gideon's fleece"; sickness and sorrow, when turned back by the unquiet sufferer either with anger or excuses, are like the rays of the sun or moon when they "dash upon a brazen vessel." Physical agony cannot eclipse the sense of secular troubles, as "little rivers are swallowed up in the sea"; death bed charity, in like manner, is comparable to the sudden kind ling of a torch "when we are to descend into our houses of darkness." Taylor's aesthetic propensity towards light and water extends, indeed, to the adoption of figures prompted by artificial, no less than natural, channels. He cautions against laying dry "the wells of God"; he likens the soul of man, newly fallen into sin, to a taper whose crown of flame "is newly blown off", and portrays the plight of the moribund sinner who "can do nothing towards the trimming of his lamp." Still, it is through the broader vistas and areas of light that he achieves his truly supreme effects. No stronger passage, certainly, than the following, quoted by Coleridge as he gazed at Michael Angelo's Moses, can be enlisted to refute the charge that, in his metaphorical visualizing, Taylor is constitutionally "near sighted" :?</page><page sequence="4">Figurative Quality in Jeremy Taylor's "Holy Dying" 491 "But as when the sun approaches the gates of the morning, he first opens a little eye of heaven, and sends away the spirits of darkness, and gives light to a cock, and calls up the lark to matins, and by and by gilds the fringes of a cloud, and peeps over the eastern hills, thrusting out his golden horns, like those which decked the brow of Moses when he was forced to wear a veil because himself had seen the face of God; and still while a man tells the story, the sun gets up higher, till he shews a fair face and a full light, and then he shines one whole day, under a cloud often, and sometimes weeping great and little showers, and sets quickly: so is a man's reason and his life." One may venture to say that, even when Taylor's imagination glanced from heaven to earth, and from the waters to the dry land, it could, if it chose, traverse the wider regions. If he has not always recognized the essential beauty of wild mountain and dull moorland, he is, obviously, sensible of the influence of sun and season upon the receptive acres of fertile soil which lend themselves to the prudence and the labors of man. The chang ing year, and its ministrations to plant and animal, rouse him from abstraction to concreteness. "The autumn with its fruits provides disorders for us, and the winter's cold turns them into sharp diseases, and the spring brings flowers to strew our hearse, and the sum mer gives green turf and brambles to bind upon our graves." Vicious men, he then submits, are like "ripe and pleasant fruit falling from a fair tree, and gathered into baskets for the planter's use." This proclivity towards the association of the impalpable and the palpable adorns the pages of Holy Dying with figures based upon the life of the lower animals and the marvels of plant creation. Pismires, vipers, dragons, screech owls, herds of "evening wolves missing their draught o? blood in their midnight revels", and Libyan lions engaged in com bat with the huntsman, all reinforce the color and movement of this curious tract on death. In the botanical sphere he draws his analogues from mighty tree and tiny flower alike. "In sick ness the understanding is shaken, and the ground is removed ir? which the root did grapple, and support its trunk." By the</page><page sequence="5">492 The Setvanee Review side of that vigorous image hovers the delicate outline of the evanescent rose:? "But so have I seen a rose newly springing from the clefts of its hood, and at first it was fair as the morning, and full with the dew of heaven as a lamb's fleece; but when a ruder breath had .... dismantled its too youthful and unripe retirements, it began to put on darkness, and to de cline to softness and the symptons of a sickly age; it bowed its head, and broke its stalk, and at night having lost some of its leaves and all of its beauty, it fell into the portion of weeds and outworn faces." Human attributes and activities contribute less generously, on the whole, than the manifestations of nature. In compelling relief, however, are the few brief excerpts from the careers of soldier and sailor, the one standing in the breach, undone by cold and hunger, the other tossed and despairing as the keel dashes against a rock and the cordage cracks. Characteristic, too, are the more frequent references to fabrics and teguments, to the adornments, especially, which dress the soul and the veils which separate the mortal from the immortal state. "In sickness the soul begins to dress herself for immor tality, first untying the strings of vanity and putting off the light and fantastic summer robe of wanton appetite ; finally, a sad night of grief and uneasiness draws the veil." Nor is it singular that a writer of Taylor's scholastic attain ments should have drawn figurative material from the manuals and chronicles of races and nations. That alert interest in exotic geography which marked the middle of the seventeenth century, and which Milton revealed in his last poems, is freely represented in Holy Dying. Exceptionally prominent are the Orient and the tropics, and his parallels from those quarters Taylor sometimes vivifies to the point of rare grotesquerie. Con demning, for example, the widow who, soon forgetful of her deceased husband, succumbs to the blandishments of a new lover, he writes:? "For so the wild foragers of Lybia, being spent with heat, andidissolved by the too fond kisses of the sun, do melt with their common fires, and die with faintness, and</page><page sequence="6">Figurative Quality in Jeremy Taylor's" Holy Dying" 493 descend with motions slow and unable to the little brooks that descend from heaven in the wilderness; and when they drink, they return into the vigour of a new life, and con tract strange marriages; and the lioness is courted by a panther." For historical analogies he gives pronounced preference to ancient Greece and Rome, preeminently to the spectacle, now animating and now depressing, of Olympian and gladiatorial combat. He is fond, also, of weaving Biblical story into vari egated imaginative tissues. "They are mistaken and miserable persons, who, since Adam planted thorns round about paradise, are more in love with that hedge than all the fruits of the garden, sottish admirers of things that hurt them, of sweet poisons, gilded daggers, and silken halters." Pursuing the figure with undiminished gusto, he resumes:? "But it is strange that any man should be so passionately in love with the thorns that grow on his own ground, that he should wear them for armlets, and knit them in his shirt, and prefer them before a kingdom and immortality." To Taylor's official connection with the Church of England one can, of course, readily trace a certain element in his figura tive style. Choirs of singing clerks yield him firm sensorial impressions. Theology and creed, however, inspire him far more than ecclesiastical ritual and discipline; outstanding are the tenets relating to punishment and forgiveness. Combats launched between singing angels and raging devils for the custody of neutral souls, charity bearing the fortunali upon wings of cheru bim to the eternal mountain of the Lord, the damned resting their heads on flaming cradles, and the ebbing and flowing of the waters of pardon?these are typical. Taylor, nevertheless, unlike many of his contemporaries, does not involve himself in a network of supernatural preposessions. Holy Dying is a reflec tive and admonitory, not a controversial, work. Written in an age in which sectarian strife was almost continuously within the horizon, it reveals its author's desire to exclude religious polemics from truly spiritual gospel. There is no escape, in</page><page sequence="7">494 The Sewanee Review this document, from the conviction that Taylor wrought his structure from personal observation and professional experience, that his contemplation of successive death-bed scenes impelled him to write what Mr. Gosse has rightly called a "threnody palpitating with emotion", and that, in rejecting metaphysical speculation and conscious mysticism, he gave way to a genuine, deep-lying literary impetus. This freedom from the blurring obsession of the preternatural and the abstract was, however, of higher value in the employment of straightforward figures than in allegorical allusion. It is by no means true that allegory in Holy Dying is entirely impertinent or ineffective. Taylor's splendid conception of the gulf between the finite and the Infinite surely assumes a directness and vividness of appeal,?and a pic torial poignancy, which makes it survive in the memory? through his occasional allegorical flights. The very heart of the doctrinal thesis of Holy Dying appears in an allegorical dress the hue and passion of which recur throughout the work:? "God having in this world placed us in a sea, and troubled the sea with a continual storm, hath appointed the church with a ship, and religion to be the stern ; but there is no haven or port but death." In his descriptions of the dissolution of man's mortal part, Taylor sometimes contrives, moreover, to approximate the con summate graphic strokes of the Holy War. To compare the al legorical touches of Jeremy Taylor with the radiant allegorical fabric of John Bunyan is, nevertheless, to compare the calmly impassioned thinker with the transported zealot. Bunyan's allegory is the soul and goad of his sustained dramatic narrative; Taylor's is a flitting beam, lending colorful point, in only its sporadic way, to his counsel and meditations. The salient virtue, in short, in the figurative quality of Holy Dying, demonstrated both in the specific and the allegorical imagery, is the genius of pictorial contrast, the power to illumine, by rapid and gleaming flashes, the sable background of a partly expository, partly didactic treatise on the passage from mortal life to eternity.
