Res. 123, 331-344 (1990). Cancer mortality in relation to radiation dose was evaluated among 4153 women treated with intrauterine radium (226Ra) capsules for benign gynecologic bleeding disorders between 1925 and 1965. Average follow up was 26.5 years (maximum = 59.9 years). Overall, 2763 deaths were observed versus 2687 expected based on U.S. mortality rates [standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 1.031. Deaths due to cancer, however, were in- creased (SMR = 1.30), especially cancers of organs close to the radiation source. For organs receiving &gt;5 Gy, excess mortality of 100 to 110% was noted for cancers of the uterus and bladder 10 or more years following irradiation, while a deficit was seen for cancer of the cervix, one of the few malignancies not previously shown to be caused by ionizing radiation. Part of the excess of uterine cancer, however, may have been due to the underlying gynecologic disorders being treated. Among cancers of organs receiving average or local doses of 1 to 4 Gy, excesses of 30 to 100% were found for leukemia and cancers of the colon and genital organs other than uterus; no excess was seen for rectal or bone cancer. Among organs typically receiving 0.1 to 0.3 Gy, a deficit was recorded for cancers of the liver, gall blad- der, and bile ducts combined, death due to stomach cancer oc- curred at close to the expected rate, a 30% excess was noted for kidney cancer (based on eight deaths), and there was a 60% excess of pancreatic cancer among 10-year survivors, but little evidence of dose-response. Estimates of the excess relative risk per Gray were 0.006 for uterus, 0.4 for other genital organs, 0.5 for colon, 0.2 for bladder, and 1.9 for leukemia. Contrary to findings for other populations treated by pelvic irradiation, a deficit of breast cancer was not observed (SMR = 1.0). Dose to the ovaries (median, 2.3 Gy) may have been insufficient to pro- tect against breast cancer. For organs receiving &gt; 1 Gy, cancer mortality remained elevated for more than 30 years, supporting the notion that radiation damage persists for many years after exposure. ? 1990 Academic Press, Inc. INTRODUCTION Although many epidemiologic studies have docu- mented excess cancer in irradiated populations (1), few ' Private consultant: Route 1, Box 148D, Huddleston, VA 24104. have provided quantitative risk estimates based on individ- ual dosimetry. The principal sources of information about cancer risks from sparsely ionizing radiation are studies of survivors of the atomic bomb explosions in Japan (2-4), patients given radiotherapy for ankylosing spondylitis (5, 6), and women treated with radiation for cervical cancer (7-9). Here, we describe cancer occurrence and estimate risks attributable to irradiation for another population, namely, women treated with radiation to control uterine bleeding associated with benign gynecologic disorders (BGD).2'3 Although previous studies of irradiated BGD pa- tients have reported increased rates of leukemia and cancers of other sites including the uterus and bladder (11, 14-16), none has provided quantitative estimates of risk based on individual estimates of organ doses. Because most BGD patients were irradiated during the 1930s or 1940s, and post-treatment survival generally was high, the popula- tion provides an opportunity to address long-term effects of radiation exposure. This paper focuses on mortality due to solid cancers, with an emphasis on cancers of pelvic organs (genital organs, bladder, rectum, and colon) and cancer of the breast. Detailed results for leukemia were reported previously (17). 2 Abbreviations used: A-bomb, atomic bomb; BGD, benign gynecologic disorders; CI, confidence interval; E, expected number of deaths; ICD, International Classification of Diseases, adapted for use in the United States; ICD8, eighth revision of the International Classification of Dis- eases, adapted for use in the United States; NOS, not otherwise specified; 0, observed number of deaths; P(j) and P(2) = one- and two-sided P-values, respectively; PY, person-years of observation; RR, relative risk; SIR, stan- dardized incidence ratio; SMR, standardized mortality ratio. 3 During the 1930s and 1940s, irradiation of the uterus and ovaries was a common treatment for menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and postmenopausal uterine bleeding. Hyperplasia of the endometrium, uterine fibroids, endo- metrial polyps, cervical polyps, and chronic cervicitis were commonly as- sociated lesions. The underlying cause in many cases was thought to be excessive secretion of estrogen relative to progesterone by the ovaries, and the radiation was administered to eliminate, suspend, or otherwise alter ovarian endocrine function (10, 11). Sterilizing or nonsterilizing doses were employed, depending on the age and health status of the patient, nature of the disorder, severity of symptoms, and other considerations. In some cases, the radiation was intended to cause atrophy of the uterine epithelium directly (12, 13). 0033-7587/90 $3.00 Copyright ? 1990 by Academic Press, Inc.

METHODS Study Population Eligible women were irradiated for BGD at any one of 10 hospitals in metropolitan Boston or Worcester, Massachusetts, or Providence, Rhode Island between 1925 and 1965, were not known to have had a cancer of the genital tract diagnosed prior to radiotherapy, were of known age, and were residents of Massachusetts or Rhode Island at the time of treatment (17). Searches of surgical and radiotherapy records identified 4153 women treated by intrauterine radium (226Ra) capsules or needles, 281 by external- beam X rays, and 49 by radium plus X rays. This paper limits analysis to the patients treated by radium only. Half [2068] were irradiated in Massa- chusetts and the other half [2085] in Rhode Island. Approximately 1802 of the Massachusetts women had been included in an earlier study that documented mortality through 19664 (16). The pres- ent analysis extends their follow up until December 31, 1984. Unfortu- nately, 504 women from this prior study could not be reidentified by name, because records were destroyed by a flood in a storage facility. No additional follow up was possible for these women, and they contributed only pre- 1967 experience to the present study, based on a computer listing that included information on individual BGD treatments and follow up through December, 1966. The other 2351 women, for whom results are presented here for the first time, were followed through 1984. Most (99%) of the radium-treated patients were white. The youngest and oldest women at the time of first irradiation were 13 and 88 years, respec- tively, and 76% were between the ages of 40 and 55. Eighty-four percent of the women were irradiated between 1930 and 1949. The usual presenting symptom was abnormal uterine bleeding (97%); 78% of the women of known menopausal status were premenopausal at the time of irradiation. Common BGD diagnoses included chronic cervicitis, hyperplasia, or dys- plasia of the endometrium, proliferative endometrium, secretory endome- trium, uterine fibroid, cervical or endometrial polyp, and endometritis.5 Medical records for 23 women noted cancer diagnoses, other than geni- tal cancers, at or prior to the time of irradiation for BGD. The breakdown of these, by site, was breast [n = 14], leukemia [2], rectum [2], colon [1], tongue [1], bladder [1], skin [1], and thyroid [1]. Both of the leukemia patients died with a death certificate diagnosis of leukemia, and 8 of the women with breast cancer died with breast cancer noted as cause of death. These 23 women were included in the analysis in order to maintain compa- rability with U.S. mortality rates used to calculate expected numbers of deaths (see below). Radium Treatments and Dosimetry Radium capsules filtered by 1 mm platinum, or 1 mm brass plus 0.5 mm silver, typically were placed in the uterine cavity for 10 to 24 h. The median treatment was 1500 mg-h, and 76% were between 1000 and 2400 mg-h (range, 28 to 9024 mg-h). Dose from radium treatments was from 7y rays only; source filters and applicators would have absorbed the a and 3 parti- cles. Eighty-one women (2%) were known to have received BGD radium treatments in more than one year. Photocopies of descriptions of BGD radium treatments from medical records or records from the earlier study were sent to medical physicists at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Organ doses were estimated using the same procedures as were used for a large international study of cervical cancer patients (8, 18). Physicists simulated pelvic radiation treatments with anthropomorphic phantoms and used the 4 J. K.

Approximately 300 thermoluminescent dosimeters placed throughout the phantom were used for each irradiation. Dosimeters were positioned to reveal the range of dose, as well as the average dose, to an organ. Average or typical configurations and placements of radium applicators were assumed, and women of unknown height were assumed to have been 160 cm tall. Because the exact relative position of the radium source and body tissue for individual women was unknown, dose estimates for sites close to the radium source are uncertain and subject to consider- able error. However, the uncertainty in average organ doses is substantially less than the uncertainty in dose to a particular point. For example, aver- age dose estimates for the bladder or rectum are likely to be accurate within a factor of two, and estimates for the ovaries within 50%. There is much less uncertainty and within-organ variation associated with average dose estimates for organs outside of the pelvic region. Doses from radiotherapy for cancer given after the radiotherapy for BGD (108 patients) or other non-BGD exposures (18 patients), such as for skin disorders, are not con- sidered. Follow up and Cause of Death Coding Women were traced using state vital records (deaths, births, marriages, divorces), the National Death Index, a computer file of deaths reported to the Social Security Administration, municipal directories, driver license registries, credit bureaus, the U.S. Post Office address correction service, and Health Care Financing Administration files of past and present Medi- care recipients. Cause of death was assigned on the basis of the International Classifica- tion of Disease (ICD) revision in effect when the woman died and then translated into the corresponding code for the eighth revision of the ICD (19). For 209 deaths known only from the computer listing from the previous study, the three-digit code given on the listing was recoded to ICD8. For six of these deaths, the unavailability of the fourth character of the original ICD code made it impossible to identify cause of death more precisely than cancer of digestive organ (1 59X). Three of these deaths oc- curred 10 or more years after irradiation. Death certificates were not ob- tained for 27 women who were known to have died. Tumor Location and Histology Information on tumor location and type was sought for fatal cancers of selected sites by contacting hospitals, physicians, nursing homes, or other institutions mentioned on the death certificate or medical record and re- questing copies of relevant medical record data. Analysis Years at risk were counted for each woman from the date of radiother- apy for BGD until the earliest of the following dates: date of death, close of follow up (January 1, 1984 or January 1, 1967), date of 90th birthday, or date lost to follow up. If a woman had been treated with radium for BGD prior to the treatment by which she was ascertained, either at another hospital or at the same hospital but during a year in which our method of ascertainment would not have identified her, then the earlier treatment was used to mark the time and age at first treatment, but accrual of years at risk began as of the date of the irradiation by which she was ascertained. There were five such women. For regression analyses of excess risk attribut- able to irradiation (see below), women who received more than one radia- tion treatment (for BGD or cancer) were withdrawn from analysis 10 years after the second treatment (or earlier, if death, loss to follow up, or 90th birthday intervened), and all of their time at risk was assigned to the dose from the initial treatment. An interval of 2 years was used for leukemia. For other analyses, all years at risk were included. Years at risk for individual women were summed to determine the group experience measured in person-years (PY); PY were distributed by age at observation, calendar time at observation, and race, using 5-year intervals for age and calendar time, and a white/non-white scale for race. 332</page><page sequence="3">CANCER FOLLOWING PELVIC RADIOTHERAPY Expected numbers of deaths due to a given cause were calculated by multi- plying the cumulative observed PY by the corresponding cause-, race-, age-, and time-specific mortality rate for U.S. women. These values were summed to give the overall expected number of deaths due to a given cause. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was defined as the ratio of ob- served (0) to expected (E) numbers of deaths. 0 was assumed to be distrib- uted as a Poisson random variable, and E was assumed to be known with- out error. Confidence intervals (CIs) for SMRs were computed according to a method described by Liddell (20). A modified version of Monson's (21) program was used to perform these calculations. Expected numbers for several causes of death also were calculated using age- and calendar time-specific mortality rates for Massachusetts women. Because Massa- chusetts data were unavailable for some causes and some calendar years, U.S. rates were used for most of the analyses. Instances in which Massa- chusetts rates were used are noted explicitly in the text, and the use of U.S. rates should otherwise be assumed. All tables, figures, and risk estimates are based on U.S. rates. Poisson regression models (22, 23) were used to test for changes in the SMR with time following irradiation and to estimate excess relative risks (RRs) attributable to irradiation. Background hazards were assumed to be proportional to age (a) and calendar year at observation (p)-specific U.S. mortality rates for females, Ro(a, p). The RR for 10 or more years following irradiation was contrasted with the RR during the first 10 years. Dose- response analyses for solid cancers were restricted to experience that oc- curred 10 or more years following irradiation, on the presumption that this was the minimal latent period for radiogenic cancers of these sites (24). Only linear dose-response models were fitted routinely. For most sites, data were not strong enough to justify a more complicated model. Excess RR models were of the form: Mortality rate (or hazard) = [boRo(a, p)] X [1 + b, dose], where boRo(a, p) is the background hazard and b, dose is the excess RR. As before, Ro(a, p) is the age- and calendar time-specific U.S. death rate for females. The regression coefficient bo equals the projected SMR at zero dose and can be visualized as the y-intercept of a straight line fitted through a plot of SMR versus dose. Inclusion of bo allowed back- ground hazards for the study population to differ proportionally from U.S. mortality rates; that is, the SMR at zero dose was not constrained to be 1.0. Observed deaths and PY were tabulated in a cross-classification defined by age, calendar time, radiation dose, age at irradiation, year of irradiation, and time since irradiation. The following categories were used: age at ob- servation (years): 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-54, 55-59, .... 85- 89; calendar year at observation: 1925-1929, 1930-1934, ... 1980- 1984; organ dose (Gy): four to five intervals were used for each organ; different intervals were used for different organs; age at irradiation (years): 10-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-89; calendar year of irradiation: 1925- 1929, 1930-1939, 1940-1949, 1950-1966; time since irradiation (years): 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-60. Models were fitted using the program AMFIT, which uses maximum likelihood methods to estimate parameters (23). Likelihood-based 90% CIs were calculated for the parameters bo and b,.

For each site, median values are shown, along with the 10th and 90th percentiles of the dose distribution over the population. a Dose was highly dependent on shape and position of radium applica- tor. An average or typical placement was assumed. b Assumes average dose = 4.0 Gy per 1000 mg-h (range within bladder = 1.0 to 15.0 Gy per 1000 mg-h). c Assumes average dose = 2.0 Gy per 1000 mg-h (range within rectum = 0.9 to 5.5 Gy per 1000 mg-h). d An approximate average dose for the colon was calculated by first averaging estimates for two subsections of the ascending and descending colons with equal weights, and then taking an equally weighted average of doses to the ascending, descending, transverse, and sigmoid segments. e The dose to the total active (red) bone marrow was calculated as a weighted average of the dose to each of 14 marrow compartments, with weights given by the presumed percentage contributions of each anatomic compartment to the total active bone marrow. Data given by Cristy (25) were used to assign weights. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Organ Doses The uterus received a very large dose of radiation, in tens of Grays, and tissues in the immediate vicinity of the uterus, including bone and bone marrow in the pelvis, re- ceived between 1 and 10 Gy (Table I). The distribution of dose within these organs was nonuniform. Organ doses were much lower for sites remote from the pelvis. Typical doses to abdominal organs were in tenths of a Gray. The lungs and breasts generally received only a few hundredths of a Gray, and the head and neck not more than one or two hundredths of a Gray. Each organ was irradiated for the same length of time, so organs receiving the highest doses also experienced the highest dose rates. Dose rates were on the order of 2.0 Gy/h to the uterine corpus, 0.4 Gy/h to the bladder, 0.2 Gy/h to the rectum, 0.15 Gy/h to the ovaries, 0.1 Gy/h to the colon, 0.03 Gy/h to the active bone marrow, and 0.01 Gy/h to the liver, gall bladder, stomach, kidneys, and pancreas. Average dose to the ovaries increased steadily from 1.5 Gy in 1925-1929 to 4.0 Gy in 1960-1965, and the average age at irradiation increased from 43.5 to 57.8 years. Higher doses also were used for older women during any given calendar time period and for postmenopausal women. 333</page><page sequence="4">INSKIP ET AL.

These deaths are not included in the "all other causes" category. Follow Up Follow up was complete for 89.1% of the study popula- tion; 66.5% were found to have died prior to the close of follow up and before reaching their 90th birthday, 22.6% were found alive, and 10.9% were lost. The average age at entry into the study was 46.6 years, and the average obser- vation period was 26.5 years. Observation time exceeded 30 years for 1922 women (46%), and the maximum follow up was 59.9 years. There was a total of 109,911 person-years of observation. Cause-Specific Mortality The overall mortality experience of the study population was generally consistent with that expected based on U.S. mortality rates (Table II). A total of 2763 deaths occurred in contrast to 2687.1 expected (SMR = 1.03). Significant ex- cesses were seen for deaths due to cancer (SMR = 1.30) and diabetes mellitus (SMR = 1.28), whereas significant deficits occurred for respiratory diseases (SMR = 0.81) and "all other causes" (SMR = 0.76). The excess of cancer deaths was attributable mostly to organs that received high local doses of radiation (&gt; 1 Gy), namely, the genital organs, bladder, colon, and hematopoi- etic and lymphatic tissue (Fig. 1; Table III). Heavily irra- diated sites for which excess cancer mortality was not appar- ent included the rectum, uterine cervix, and bone. In fact, a notable deficit of deaths due to cervical cancer was re- corded. (It was difficult to estimate an SMR for the uterine corpus alone, because U.S. mortality rate files do not distin- guish cancer of the corpus from cancer of the uterus, not otherwise specified (NOS)). The collective SMR for cancers of pelvic organs was 1.5 for experience of 10 or more years postirradiation. Cancers of "other and unspecified sites," a category which consists mostly of metastatic cancers, also were increased by 50% (Table III). There were twice as many deaths due to leukemia as were expected, based on experience of 2 or more years following irradiation. Fatal cancers of lightly and very lightly irradiated organs, in aggregate, occurred at the expected frequency (O/E = 224/213.7 = 1.0). In these two groups, the only sites for which cancer mortality departed markedly from what was expected were the pancreas and brain, for which there were excesses, and the liver, gall bladder, and bile ducts com- bined, for which there was a deficit (Fig. 1; Table III). A 30% excess of deaths due to kidney cancer (years 10+) was based on only one or two more deaths than were expected. The close agreement between observed and expected numbers for most causes of death, except for cancers of heavily irradiated tissues, supports the validity of compari- sons with mortality rates from the general population. Nonetheless, the validity of using rates for the entire United States to estimate E for this urban New England population should be considered on a cancer by cancer basis. Rates for several cancer sites, including the colon, rectum, breast, and ovary, are generally higher in the northern United States than in the South (26), and urban-rural differences have been reported for the colon, rectum, breast, and pan- creas (2 7-29). When Massachusetts rates were used, slightly lower SMRs for years 10+ were obtained for all cancers combined (1.25 versus 1.30), and cancers of the colon (1.1 versus 1.3), rectum (0.8 versus 1.0), breast (0.9 versus 1.0), and bladder (2.0 versus 2.1), but the SMR for cancer of the pancreas did not change. Complete sets of Massachusetts rates were not available for leukemia or cancers of the uterus or ovary. It has been hypothesized that having high body iron stores increases the risk of several cancers, including cancers of the colon, bladder, esophagus, and lung (30, 31) and, conversely, that having low iron stores is protective (31). Excessive uterine bleeding resulted in anemia for many women (10). However, the occurrence of cancers of lightly and very lightly irradiated sites at close to the ex- pected frequency, rather than in deficit, suggests that dys- functional uterine bleeding did not confer general protec- tion against cancer among these women. Cancers of Heavily Irradiated Organs or Tissues (Average or Local Dose &gt; 1 Gy) Consistent with other irradiated populations (2, 6, 7, 8), the RR for leukemia was highest during the first 10 years following exposure, while the RR for solid cancers of organs close to the radiation source was highest after the first 10 years (Fig. 2; Table III).

Standardized mortality ratios (with 90% CIs) for cancers of selected organs. SMRs are based on experience that occurred 10 or more years following irradiation, except the SMRs for leukemia and bone cancer, which are based on experience 2 or more years postirradiation. Organs are listed in descending order of average dose. "Heavily irradiated organs" received local doses greater than 1 Gy. "Lightly irradiated organs" typically received doses of 0.1 to 0.3 Gy, and "very lightly irradiated organs" usually received less than 0.05 Gy. The category "genital organs other than uterus" includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, vagina, and vulva. Results for the uterine cervix are based on years 1950 to 1984, when ICD classifications distinguished cancer of the cervix from cancer of the uterine corpus and cancer of the uterus, not otherwise specified. remained elevated 30 to 40 years after irradiation, which is similar to results for the A-bomb survivors (2) and cervical cancer patients (8). Time-response patterns did, however, vary among individual organs. The RR for uterine cancer increased over the first 30 years, the RRs for other genital cancers and colon cancer were highest between 10 and 20 years, and a notable excess of deaths due to bladder cancer was apparent only after 20 years (Fig. 2). Among the spon- dylitis patients (6), the overall relative excess of solid cancers other than colon cancer (which was excluded be- cause of its association with spondylitis) was highest 10 to 20 years following irradiation and virtually disappeared after 25 to 30 years. Such a decrease to normal rates is not apparent among A-bomb survivors (2) or cervical cancer patients (8). In our series, the pattern of risk over time since radium treatment indicated an increase in the absolute ex- cess risk (Table III). Colon and rectum. Although the overall excess of colon cancer was small, the SMR increased with radiation dose, and the excess RR was estimated as 0.51 per Gray (Fig. 3; Table IV), which is similar to the estimate for female A- bomb survivors age 40+ at the time of bombing (0.44 per Gray) (3, 4). Applying Massachusetts mortality rates in- stead of U.S. rates gave a lower overall SMR, but an associa- tion with dose was still apparent. Among irradiated cervical cancer patients, however, for whom the doses to the colon were extremely high (tens of Gray), no excess risk was found (8). Boice et al. (8) suggested that the apparent ab- sence of excess risk of colon cancer among the cervical cancer patients might be attributable to the killing of trans- formed cells. The whole-body exposures of the A-bomb survivors were associated with a nearly homogeneous dose to the colon, in contrast to the markedly nonuniform dose for the BGD patients. Irradiation for BGD delivered a large dose to the sigmoid colon relative to other parts of the colon (Table I), and a majority of the colon cancers appear to have origi- nated in the sigmoid (23 of 38 (61%) of cases with informa- tion on tumor location). However, the sigmoid also is the commonest site for colon cancers in the U.S. population in general (29, 32), so an uneven distribution would be ex- pected even in the absence of a radiation effect. Estimates of risk based on dose to the sigmoid, rather than average dose to the colon, gave an excess RR of 0.22 per Gray. The rectum received a substantial dose of radiation (me- dian, 3 Gy), but deaths due to rectal cancer occurred at the expected rate among 10 year survivors (Fig. 1). Relative risk did not appear to be associated with time since irradiation (Fig. 2, Table III) or radiation dose (Fig. 3; Table IV). A radiation dose-response relationship also was not seen for cancer of the rectum among A-bomb survivors (2), but was apparent among irradiated cervical cancer patients, follow- - 335 I 1 1 I I I II I 1: I II</page><page sequence="6">INSKIP ET AL.

Two smaller studies of irradiated BGD patients showed little difference between SMRs for cancers of the colon and rectum, with estimates of 1.1 to 1.2 for cancer incidence (16) and 1.5 to 1.7 for mortality (15). Overall, it appears that cancer of the rectum is not readily induced by low doses of radiation. Bladder. An approximately twofold risk of bladder cancer was observed following a median dose of 6 Gy. The SMR increased with increasing time since irradiation (P(j) = 0.12 for years &gt; 10 versus years 0-9) (Fig. 2; Table III) and with increasing dose (excess RR = 0.20 per Gray) (Fig. 3; Table IV). Excess occurrences of bladder cancer have been found repeatedly among populations receiving substantial pelvic radiation doses, including BGD (11, 15, 16) and cervical cancer (8) patients. Mortality due to cancer of the urinary tract, mostly attributable to bladder cancer, was associated with radiation dose among the A-bomb sur- vivors, and the excess RR was estimated as 1.27 per Gy (3). It appears that a relatively long observation time is required to allow for peak expression of radiogenic cancer of the bladder. The RR was higher for years 20+ postirradiation than for earlier years among A-bomb survivors (2), cervical cancer patients (8), and ankylosing spondylitis patients (6), as well as among these BGD patients. The effect of cigarette smoking, a known risk factor for bladder cancer (33), was not controlled in the present study. If, however, the excess mortality due to bladder cancer was attributable to confounding by smoking, one would have expected substantially higher SMRs for cancers of the respi- ratory system and oral cavity. The literature indicates that the RR for smoking and lung cancer is several-fold higher than that for smoking and bladder cancer (34). Uterus. Patients with BGD were at an elevated risk of dying from cancer of the uterus in comparison to women in the U.S. population at large (Table III).

Cancer of the uterine corpus oc- curred in excess among irradiated cervical cancer patients (dose &gt; 100 Gy), but, again, the excess risk per Gray was very low (8).

The panel in the lower right corner overlays the graph for leukemia with that for cancers of all pelvic organs combined (genital organs, rectum, colon, and bladder). have contributed to differential cancer mortality. Possible sources of bias include (a) exclusion from the study popula- tion of women with uterine cancers diagnosed at or prior to the time of the baseline hospital visit for BGD; (b) bleeding caused by incipient or undiagnosed uterine cancers present at baseline (For example, mortality due to cancer of the uterus was elevated substantially even within the first 10 years among women who were age 55 or older at the time of radiotherapy for BGD (O = 14, E = 2.84, SMR = 4.9), and it is unlikely that radiation caused many of these cancers.); (c) predisposition to later development of uterine cancer among women who develop BGD; and (d) dissimilar rates of hysterectomy among irradiated BGD patients and U.S. women in general. The first of these would tend to decrease the SMR for uterine cancers, the second and third would tend to increase the SMR, and the fourth could operate in either direction depending on whether hysterectomy oc- curred more or less often among the BGD patients. Certain common BGD diagnoses, such as atypical hyper- plasia and dysplasia of the endometrium, are prognostic of increased risk for cancer of the endometrium and may, in fact, represent early stages in a cancerous process (35). Re- sults of the regression analysis suggest that these women indeed were at an increased risk of uterine cancer indepen- dent of their BGD radiotherapy.

Note that confidence intervals would be wider if bo also had been estimated. Wagoner (16) reported an excess of uterine sarcomas among irradiated BGD patients in Connecticut, half of whom had been irradiated by radium and half by X rays. Twelve of 83 incident uterine cancers (14%) were sarcomas or mixed carcino-sarcomas. Only 1.5 cases would have been expected on the basis of Connecticut population inci- dence rates. In the present study of women from states adja- cent to Connecticut, five sarcomas or mixed tumors (6%) were identified among 84 fatal uterine cancers of specified histologic type. Both studies are consistent with a propor- tion of 8-12%. Unfortunately, mortality rates were not available to compute an expected number of deaths by his- topathologic subtype. One might expect a higher propor- tion of sarcomas among fatal uterine cancers than among incident cancers, because survival rates are lower for sarco- mas (36). Seventeen percent of the incident cancers of the uterine corpus recorded among irradiated cervical cancer patients were sarcomas or carcinosarcomas (8). Cancer of the cervix stands out as one of the few human cancers not known to be caused by ionizing radiation (1), and results of the present study do nothing to change the view that the cervix is less susceptible to radiation carcino- genesis than are most other organs. There were fewer deaths due to cervical cancer than were expected (Table III). How- ever, chronic cervicitis was a common diagnosis among these women, and conization of the cervix was a common treatment for chronic cervicitis (37). It is possible that sur- gical removal of part or all of the cervix occurred more often among these women than among women in the U.S. population in general. Other genital organs. Cancers of genital sites other than the uterus had to be combined in the analysis, because refer- ence mortality rates were not available for individual sites. Most of the 37 deaths that occurred 10 or more years follow- ing irradiation were certified to cancer of the ovary,6 and the dose-response analysis evaluated RR in terms of dose to the ovaries. The regression analysis indicated a positive dose response over the range 0 to 4 Gray (excess RR = 0.41 per Gray) (Table IV; Fig. 3). A dose-response relationship also was evident for the A-bomb survivors over the range 0 to 3.5 Gy, and the excess RR was 1.33 per Gray (2, 3, 38). Among cervical cancer patients (average dose to ovaries, 32 Gy) who survived 10 or more years following radiotherapy, the RR for ovarian cancer was 1.4 (8), which is considerably lower than would be expected based on the risk coefficient for the A-bomb survivors. If the sterilizing effect of ovarian doses of 5 to 8 Gy (39-41) is attributable to inactivation of ovarian cells, and these same cells are targets for radiation carcinogenesis, then one would expect the excess RR per Gy to decrease at doses over several Grays. Wagoner (16) reported a 70% excess of ovarian cancers among BGD pa- tients in Connecticut (P(l) &lt; 0.01), while Smith and Doll (15) reported an SMR of 1.0 (upper 90% bound - 1.9) for Scottish patients treated by X rays. Ovarian doses from X- ray treatments for BGD typically were between 4.5 and 15 Gy (14, 39, 42). The same sources of uncertainty that complicate inter- pretation for cancer of the uterus also apply for cancer of the ovary and other genital sites, although to a lesser extent. Endometrial hyperplasia sometimes is caused by estrogen- producing ovarian tumors (35), but it is unlikely that malig- nant ovarian tumors present at the time of irradiation would be responsible for much of the excess mortality more than 10 years after irradiation. Perhaps of greater concern is the fact that many women diagnosed with ovarian cancer have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, suggesting the possibility of misclassification error. Bone, bone marrow, and lymphatic tissue. Radiother- apy for BGD delivered doses greater than 1 Gy to bone in the pelvis, but bone cancer did not occur in excess among 6 The distribution by site was ovary [n = 28], vagina [2] and vulva [ 1]. In addition there were six deaths known only from a computer listing from the previous study. ICD codes given on the listing did not distinguish ovarian cancers from cancers of the fallopian tubes. However, based on the usual ratio of cancers of these sites, it is likely that most of the six were listed as ovarian cancers on death certificates. 339</page><page sequence="10">INSKIP ET AL. these women (Table III; Fig. 1). An RR higher than 1.2 seems unlikely, based on the 90% CI. There is evidence in the literature of induction of bone cancer by sparsely ioniz- ing radiation only at very high doses, in the tens of Grays (24, 43). Leukemia, on the other hand, is among the cancers most readily induced by radiation, and our estimate of the excess RR for leukemia (1.9 per Gy) (17) was several-fold higher than corresponding estimates for cancers of the co- lon, ovary, and bladder. Most of the leukemia deaths that occurred during the first 15 years were due to chronic my- eloid leukemia, whereas the acute leukemias and chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) predominated at later times. CLL is not believed to be induced by ionizing radiation. Multiple myeloma, which was associated with radiation ex- posure among the A-bomb survivors (2), but not among cervical cancer patients (8), could be evaluated in the pres- ent study only as part of a larger category that included other hematologic cancers (Table III). The observed num- ber of deaths for this category nearly equalled the expected number. However, Cuzick (44) combined data from two cohorts of irradiated BGD patients and reported an excess of multiple myeloma (O/E = 10/4.07 = 2.5). An associa- tion of this disease with irradiation also was suggested among spondylitics, based on eight deaths (6). Cancers of Lightly Irradiated Organs (0.1 to 0.3 Gy) Incidental doses from BGD radiotherapy to organs in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head were low, and precise esti- mates of radiation risks for these organs were not expected. Pancreas. The reason for the excess of deaths due to pancreatic cancer (Table III) is unclear. Although the rela- tive excess was highest during late postirradiation intervals, there was little evidence of an association with dose (P(l) = 0.14). The dose-response relationship was nearly flat for doses less than 0.3 Gy, which includes most of the popula- tion (Fig. 3); the excess RR was 0.14 per Gray (90% CI: -2.76 to 28.84) with a bo of 1.5. Because the highest SMR for pancreatic cancer was observed &gt;30 years following ra- diotherapy, it was considered that radiogenic cancer of the pancreas might be primarily a late effect. However, restric- tion of analysis to experience that occurred after 30 years did not yield stronger evidence of positive dose response. The A-bomb survivor data also did not show a dose- response relationship for cancer of the pancreas (2). Anky- losing spondylitis patients received doses to the pancreas in excess of 1 Gy, but mortality due to cancer of the pancreas 5 or more years after irradiation was not elevated (O = 21, E = 20.5, SMR = 1.0) (6). Cancer of the pancreas also was not increased among irradiated cervical cancer patients (average dose, 1.9 Gy), based on 221 observed cases (8). Death certificate diagnoses of pancreatic cancer are no- toriously inaccurate, and measured patterns of occurrence can depend on the level of medical care, the quality of clini- cal records, and death registration practices (27). Further- more, because average dose to the pancreas from radium treatments for BGD was very low, misclassification of even a small number of primary cancers of other sites, including radiogenic cancers, could result in a spuriously high risk coefficient for the pancreas. None of the three pancreatic cancers among women with doses greater than 0.3 Gy was confirmed histologically. Histologic data were, however, obtained for 15 other women. Information supported the death certificate diagnosis for 8, indicated another site for 4 (two ovary, one stomach, one kidney), and failed to identify a primary site for 3 others. Clearly, data in the present study do not warrant strong inferences concerning the magnitude of the risk coefficient for cancer of the pancreas. Associations between the occurrence of pancreatic cancer and a history of uterine myomas (45) or presence of endometrial hyperplasia and ovarian stromal hyperplasia at autopsy (46) have been noted, and investigators in those studies hypothesized that excessive activity of gonadotropic or steroid hormones are involved in the etiology of cancer of the pancreas. These observations raise the possibility that the underlying gynecologic disorders of women in the pres- ent study were responsible for their increased risk of pancre- atic cancer. Contrary to this view is Wagoner's (16) finding of lower than expected incidence of cancer of the pancreas among BGD patients irradiated in Connecticut (SIR = 0.5, 90% upper bound = 1.2). An additional possibility is that the excess of pancreatic cancer was related to a greater prevalence of diabetes melli- tus among these former BGD patients. Deaths attributed to diabetes were more frequent than expected, and an associa- tion between diabetes and cancer of the pancreas has been reported (47). However, the validity of this association has been questioned (27). Stomach. Death due to stomach cancer occurred about as often as expected, and patterns of variation in the SMR with time since irradiation (Table III) and radiation dose (Fig. 3) did not implicate radiation as a cause of stomach cancers in this study population. The estimate of the excess RR was 0.27 per Gray, but the associated 90% CI easily included zero, and only very extreme values (&gt;4 to 5 per Gy) could be ruled out (Table IV). If background hazards are presumed to equal stratum-specific U.S. mortality rates (i.e., b0o = 1.0), then an average excess RR greater than 1.6 per Gy would be judged unlikely, based on the 90% CI for the SMR and an average dose of 0.21 Gy. Shimizu et al. (3) reported a positive association between radiation dose and RR for stomach cancer among A-bomb survivors, and the excess RR (0.27 per Gray), coincidentally, was equal to the estimate from the present study. Wagoner (16) reported an SMR of 0.8 (90% upper bound = 1.4) for stomach cancer among BGD patients from Connecticut. No excess stom- ach cancers were apparent among spondylitis patients (6), whereas a relatively high excess RR (0.69 per Gray) was reported for cervical cancer patients surviving 10 or more years (8). 340</page><page sequence="11">CANCER FOLLOWING PELVIC RADIOTHERAPY Kidneys. There was little evidence that doses of the order of 0.2 Gy increased the risk of kidney cancer. Among 10-year survivors, 8 deaths were observed against 6.3 ex- pected. Wagoner (16) reported a small excess of kidney cancer (O/E = 7/3.4 = 2.1) for the Connecticut BGD pa- tients. Nonsignificant (P() &gt; 0.05) positive associations be- tween RR and dose were noted among cervical cancer pa- tients (8) and A-bomb survivors (2). Liver, gall bladder, and bile ducts. The liver, gall blad- der, and bile ducts are not believed to be particularly suscep- tible to cancer induction by y or X rays (24). The deficit of deaths certified to cancers of these organs might be attribut- able to diagnostic errors or coding inconsistencies asso- ciated with the problem of metastatic cancers. Incidence of cancer of the liver and biliary tract for the Connecticut BGD cohort was close to expectation (16). Cancers of Very Lightly Irradiated Organs (&lt;0.05 Gy) Breast. The observed number of deaths due to breast cancer nearly equalled the expected number (Table III). If the 14 women known to have been diagnosed with breast cancer prior to their BGD radium treatments were ex- cluded from the analysis, the SMR for the first 10 years dropped from 1.2 to 1.0, while SMRs for later intervals were essentially unchanged. The SMR by age at irradiation was 1.3 for women younger than 40 years (O/E = 17/12.7), 0.9 for age 40-44 (20/21.7), 0.7 for age 45-49 (20/27.5), 1.3 for age 50-54 (20/15.6), and 1.2 for age &gt; 55 (8/6.8). The risk of radiogenic breast cancer for women over age 40 at the time of exposure appears to be relatively low, with an estimated absolute risk of 0.8 cases per 104 PY-Gy (9). Most of the BGD patients in the present study received doses to the breasts of only several hundredths of a Gray (Table I). One would expect few, if any, cases of radiogenic breast cancer in this cohort. On the contrary, the literature suggests that pelvic irradiation can protect a woman against breast cancer. Among cervical cancer patients with intact ovaries, radiotherapy was associated with a 44% reduction in the incidence of breast cancer (9), and 10 to 50% deficits of breast cancer incidence (11, 16) and mortality (14, 15) have been reported for irradiated BGD patients as well. The protective effect does not appear to be confined to premeno- pausal women (9, 15). In the present study, the excess RR for breast cancer 5 or more years after irradiation decreased with increasing ovarian dose (Fig. 3), though the decrease was small and easily consistent with an excess RR of zero (excess RR = -0.07 per Gy; 90% CI: -0.43 to 0.29). The RR was not significantly associated with ovarian dose in any of the age at exposure categories. Among the cervical cancer patients, a reduced risk of breast cancer was evident only among women with ovarian doses greater than 6 Gy (9). Boice et al. (9) suggested that the apparent all-or-none response might correspond to the inactivation of a critical number of ovarian cells. Less than 1% of women in the present study received ovarian doses greater than 6 Gy. As noted previously, doses to the ovaries from radium treatments for BGD were substantially lower than doses from X-ray treatments. External-beam therapy was the usual mode of radiotherapy in the studies of BGD patients that reported deficits of breast cancer, and ovarian doses in those studies generally exceeded 6 Gy (14, 39, 42). Wagoner's (16) study of women who were irradiated for BGD in Connecticut included approximately equal num- bers of women treated by X rays and radium, and the stan- dardized incidence ratio for breast cancer (0.9) was inter- mediate between the SMR from the present study (1.0) and the lower values reported for X-ray patients. Results from the different studies of BGD patients and cervical cancer patients thus are broadly consistent in terms of the dose dependence of the protective effect of ovarian irradiation. (Data from the present study are easily consistent with an SMR of 0.9 and, in fact, the use of Massachusetts mortality rates to calculate E gave an SMR of 0.9. There is essentially no difference between overall RRs for the Connecticut and Massachusetts-Rhode Island BGD populations.) Although this discussion has focused on dose to the ovaries, it is possi- ble that irradiation of other organs or tissues, such as the adrenal glands, also can indirectly influence breast cancer risk (48). Brain. The excess mortality due to brain cancer proba- bly was not caused by the radiotherapy. The treatment-re- lated dose to the brain was less than 0.01 Gy and was small relative to typical cumulative exposures from natural back- ground and other unmeasured sources of radiation expo- sure. The number of deaths was small, and this may have been a chance finding. Alternative possibilities are that "be- nign" tumors were misclassified as malignant, that primary cancers of other sites metastasized to the brain and were misdiagnosed,7 or that hormonal or other factors associated with BGD are predictive of the later occurrence of brain cancer. If brain tumors were already present at the time of radiotherapy for BGD, and perhaps somehow related to the uterine bleeding, one would have expected an early rather than late excess of brain cancer deaths. Summary and Comparisons with Other Studies This is the largest study to date of women irradiated for benign gynecologic disorders, has the longest average follow up, and is based on lifetime experience following irradia- tion for 67% of the study population. The long follow up was particularly important in the case of bladder cancer, for which excess mortality was apparent only 20 or more years following radiotherapy. Overall relative risk for heavily 7 Diagnoses given on death certificates for the 11 deaths attributed to brain cancer were glioblastoma [n = 5], astrocytoma [4], malignant brain tumor [1], and brain tumor, assumed malignant [1]. Three death certifi- cates noted that the diagnosis was confirmed histologically. 341</page><page sequence="12">INSKIP ET AL.

This suggests that radiation-induced damage persists for many years. Results from the major studies of BGD patients are com- piled in Table V. Taking account of differences in preci- sion, there is good agreement between summary estimates of RR for leukemia, cancers of heavily irradiated organs, in aggregate, and cancers of the urinary tract. More variation in RR is seen for cancers of the colon, rectum, pancreas, breast, and genital organs. That the RR for incidence of uterine cancer in the Wagoner cohort is higher than the RR from the mortality studies is not surprising, given the rela- tively low case fatality rate for cancer of the endometrium. Variation in the RR for breast cancer is explainable in terms of differences in average dose to the ovaries. Radia- tion doses that were sufficient to induce menopause in BGD patients in the present study appear to have been in- sufficient to effect a substantial reduction in breast cancer risk. A second important feature of the present study is the dosimetry based on radiotherapy data for individual women, which permits comparisons among dose categories and with results from other studies. Dose-related excess mortality was noted among these BGD patients for leuke- mia and cancers of nonuterine genital organs (mostly ovary), colon, and bladder but not for cancer of the rectum. Results for the uterus are equivocal and difficult to inter- pret, except that the risk per Gray appears to be low at these high doses. Estimates of RR attributable to radiation for selected cancers are summarized in Table VI for BGD patients in the present study, for A-bomb survivors (2-4), and for irra- diated cervical cancer patients (7, 8). Average radiation doses to pelvic organs were highest for the cervical cancer patients and lowest among the A-bomb survivors. Risk esti- mates generally were in the opposite order, that is, highest for the A-bomb cohort and lowest for the cervical cancer patients. Other characteristics of exposure also differed among these populations. Dose was accumulated over hours, days, or weeks among the radiotherapy patients and varied widely within pelvic organs for individual women. In contrast, exposures were nearly instantaneous and approxi- mately uniform within organs for the A-bomb survivors. Relatively more cell killing would be expected to have oc- curred among the radiotherapy patients because of the lo- cally high doses, although it is possible that the high dose rate made the A-bomb exposure more effective per Gray at both transforming and sterilizing cells. 342</page><page sequence="13">CANCER FOLLOWING PELVIC RADIOTHERAPY TABLE VI Organ-Specific Estimates of Relative Risk Attributable to Ra- diation for Atomic Bomb Survivors (2-4), Radium-Treated BGD Patients (Present Study), and Cervical Cancer Patients (7-8) Estimated RR at 1 Gy (90% CI) for study population Cervical cancer Cancer A-bomb survivorsa BGD patientsb patientsc Leukemia 4.4d (CI not given) 2.88 (1.96, 4.01) 1.7 (CI not given) Colon 1.44d (CI not given) 1.51 (0.92, 6.61) 1.00 (0.99, 1.02) Rectum 0.97e(0.86, 1.16) 1.03 (0.86, 1.19) 1.02 (1.00, 1.04) Uterus 1.07e(0.95, 1.24) 1.01 (0.99, 1.05) l.Olf(l.00, 1.02) Ovary/other genital organs 2.33 (1.37, 3.86) 1.41 (0.31, 2.51) 1.01 (0.98, 1.14) Bladder 2.27 (1.53, 3.37) 1.20 (1.08, 1.35) 1.07 (1.02, 1.17) Stomach 1.27 (1.14, 1.43) 1.27 (0.00, 5.80) 1.69 (1.01, 3.25) Note. Relative risks are averaged over all ages at exposure and include both sexes for A-bomb survivors, except for genital organs and as otherwise noted. a Risk estimates are from fitted linear dose-response models based on 1950-1985 follow up and DS86 dosimetry, unless otherwise noted. b Risk estimates are based on linear dose-response regressions and ex- clude the first 10 years following irradiation, except for leukemia, for which only the first 2 years were excluded. c Risk estimates for solid cancers were calculated as [(RR - 1)/D] + 1, where RR is the overall RR for 10-year survivors and D is average organ dose in Grays (8). For leukemia, the estimated RR at 1 Gy among 1-year survivors was calculated based on a dose-response model that accounted for anatomic heterogeneity in marrow dose and allowed for competing effects of leukemia induction and cell killing (7). d Estimate is for women aged 40+ years at time of bombing and assumes a relative biological effectiveness of 1.0 (4). e Estimate taken from Preston et al. (2), based on old (T65DR) dosime- try. Shimizu et al. (3, 4) did not present a risk coefficient. f Estimate is for "all female genital organs." A risk estimate specific to the uterus was not given. Reasons for caution in interpretation of data for these BGD patients include the small numbers of deaths ob- served for certain cancers and consequent imprecision of parameter estimates, low doses to organs outside of the pel- vic region, wide variation in dose within organs close to the radium source, possible misclassification of cancers of the pancreas, ovary, colon-rectum, and brain, and the absence of a group of nonirradiated BGD patients, which made it impossible to separate clearly risk associated with the un- derlying gynecologic disorders from risk due to the radio- therapy. These women probably were at elevated risk of uterine cancer because of factors associated with BGD, and similarities in patterns of occurrence of cancers of the uter- ine corpus, breast, ovary, and colon suggest that these cancers have etiologic factors in common or that the respec- tive factors are correlated (35, 49). Fortunately, the avail- ability of data for long periods of time following irradiation and, in the case of the more heavily irradiated organs, for a range of doses mitigates some of the problems associated with the absence of a nonirradiated comparison group.
