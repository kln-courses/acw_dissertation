<plain_text><page sequence="1">Critical Anthropomorphism in the "Age of Biocybernetic Reproduction": A Response to Nicole Merola's "Monkeys, Apes, and Bears, Oh My!" Bart Welling Time: Around 32,000 years ago. Place: A bear cave (now known as Chauve t Cave, Vallon-Pont-ď Arc, Ardèche, south-central France): A boy is being led by torchlight into the womb of the earth. He has known of this place since before he can remember, if only from whispers overheard around the fire, or from significant glances cast by his tribe's shaman up at the cliffs where eagles call and ibex graze. Now, to his astonishment, the old shaman has taken the eight-year-old to the place of power. This is a site of origins and becomings, an opening in the flesh of the living world where dream, song, story, trance, and his people's all- important relationships with their animal kin all converge. The shaman and his new apprentice are the only people breaking the deep silence; no other</page><page sequence="2">Response Essays 661 member of the tribe would have dared follow them here. Still, the boy's breath grows ragged as he tries not to reflect on who else might be present. It is impossible to ignore the scratch marks on the walls, the big bones strewn around the cave floor, the hollows which can only be the beds where the master of the cave sleeps his miraculous winter sleep while his smaller relations - only a few of whom, such as the shaman, can still commune with him - shiver and pray for spring around their fires in the valley below. The cave bear. It may be forbidden for the boy to utter his true name, but he can picture him as clearly as he can recall his mother's face. Grandfather. The great one. After leading him through a narrow tunnel, the shaman pauses and holds his pine torch up. Suddenly the boy jumps back. For the briefest of moments he does not recognize the painting as the work of human hands. In the flickering light, he sees the massive head and bulging shoulder of the great bear looming out at him. Wary, head down, eyeless (why?), coming in for a closer sniff. Not living in the same sense as the huge animals who den up here in winter, but alive all the same. After whispering the bear's true name and studying his new apprentice's face in the torch-glow, the shaman unwraps his bundle and begins with great patience and care to explain the proper handling of hides and pigments, the use of other sacred artifacts, the words of power, the singing of songs, the interpretation of visions. The boy has seen bears many times before; perhaps he has also seen representations of them. He has fingered their claws, eyed their skulls. But he is surprised to find that his sense of awe only grows the more he stares at this image. How cán the shaman not hear the thudding of his heart echo from the cave walls?1 Time: Yesterday. Place: Denali National Park, Alaska, United States of America: This was definitely a mistake. The bumpy road. The drizzle. The semi-rancid reindeer sausage for lunch - ugh. What's worse, three hours and no predators! (Eagles don't count - they're all over the place). Five days in Alaska, and still no authentic wilderness experience. (The whales near the ship don't count, either. Any idiot could watch them at SeaWorld). And what good is a wildlife bus tour without wildlife? Where are the wolves taking down caribou? How about a lynx grabbing a ptarmigan in mid-flight? Shouldn't they guarantee you at least one bear fight, or your money back? Wait . . . the guide is looking at something . .</page><page sequence="3">662 jac There! Up on the hillside. That brown blur - a subadult grizzly! And it's trying to catch something! The driver brings the bus to a stop, and, using a small joystick, the guide zooms in on the bear with a custom-made apparatus consisting of a high-powered motorized video camera, complete with waterproof telephoto lens, mounted on the roof of the vehicle. As if on cue, all eyes pan away from the distant blob swimming in a sea of green and lock onto the small but accurate video screens located on the back of every head rest. People are literally holding their breath. The grizzly is chasing . . . chasing . . . [collective groan]. A ground squirrel. A freaking arctic ground squirrel. Not even a baby moose. And - wouldn'tyou know it? - the squirrel gets away. Biggest. Mistake. Ever.2 These cartoon sketches of human encounters with bears and repre- sentations of them - from what may be the oldest and longest-lasting image of a bear that we will ever know, to one of the newest and most ephemeral - are meant to highlight a major shift in the way that Homo sapiens have used representational technologies to interpret and structure their relationships with non-human beings. Indeed, they draw attention to important changes in the idea of representation itself. If, as paleolithic art experts such as Jean Clottes have argued, the Aurignacian cave painters of Chauvet used representations of animals for ritual purposes (like their modern hunter-gatherer counterparts), then the main image in the Recess of the Bears at Chauvet would not have been perceived as a purely visual outline of the contours of an individual bear - or, for that matter, of an invisible bear god akin to later Western deities.3 Rather, it would have served as a crucial link in a "material-semiotic" network4 connecting living, dead, and unborn bears, as well as bears of story and myth (and, perhaps, of shape-shifting rituals), with the ursine-human politics that were a matter of everyday concern for both species. Likewise, just as modern Western mind/body, human/animal, nature/culture, and related dualisms most likely would have struck the Aurignacians as absurd, the images at Chauvet bear witness to a very different understanding of the relationships between artistic subjects and their backgrounds, between themes and materials, and in fact (although all of these terms are woefully anachro- nistic and imprecise in this context) between art and ecology. Like many other examples of cave art, the largest and most complete animal in the Recess of the Bears incorporates - or emerges from - a geological</page><page sequence="4">Response Essays 663 feature of the cave, in this case a "natural relief in the wall [which] forms [its] shoulder" (Clottes 32), suggesting that its painter meant not only to "ritually materializ[e] [one of] the animal spirits already present in the underground" (White, qtd. in Kalof 2), but that he or she may have wanted to emphasize the continuities between the bodies of the cave's bears and the Ice Age world they shared with humans - who were, of course, just as dependent on this wild and sacred landscape as the bears. Based on a wealth of material evidence and the most plausible theories as to the purposes and meanings of the cave paintings, it seems very likely that the paintings would have "activate[d] the condition of significant otherness" or awakened a strong sense of "symphysis" in those who created and viewed them (see Merola 670). They certainly would have been rich with what Walter Benjamin, in his essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," terms "aura," a sense of uniqueness and even "ritual power" inhering in original and unreproduced works of art that Benjamin in fact traces back to Stone Age cave paintings (see 227, 246 n. 6). Fast-forward over thirty millennia to the age of biocybernetic reproduction, as W.J.T. Mitchell characterizes our era ( What 309-35), and it becomes hard not to share Benjamin's sense that the "aura" of images has suffered a general decay, along with John Berger's deep pessimism vis-à-vis the fate of "the look," by which he means the shared gaze between humans and animals, "which may have played a crucial role in the development of human society, and with which, in any case, all men had always lived until less than a century ago." In Berger's view, the look has been "extinguished," a loss that "is now irredeemable for the culture of capitalism" (28). Berger's thoughts on pets and zoos can apply equally well to the Denali bus tour. It isn't that eco-tourists like the ones parodied here have abandoned the anc ient human desire for mean ingful interactions with nonhuman creatures - quite the contrary. The problem is that the particular constellation of digital and transportation technologies, genres of animal representation (for example, wildlife films and nature photogra- phy), economic formations, structures of class, race, and gender, political and geopolitical issues (the creation of the National Park Service; diesel for the bus), and other elements of recent human history that have brought the tourists to Denali - this array of factors, while itself vast and enor- mously complicated, has, paradoxically, resulted in a radically narrowed</page><page sequence="5">664 jac field of possibility in which the meaning of encounters with wild animals can take shape. Safe from grizzly maulings and cold rain, the tourists are also insulated from surprise, mystery, the pleasures of walking, one-on- one encounters with animals, and a deeper bioregional knowledge of the bear's life-world.5 This is true in no small measure because, while the bear can perceive them with the aid of her eyes, ears, and exquisitely adapted nose, and can draw massive amounts of information about her world through her paws and fur, they (at least in this encounter) have surren- dered every sense but one. And this sense is obviously mediated both by glass and microchip and by a long history of representations of nature, which in recent years have taken a decidedly violent and spectacular turn. Meaning is no longer to be found in the entire range of activities and places of which the animal encounter is part - or even, really, in the encounter itself - but in technologically enhanced visual representations of it (which are by no means magical ly connected to the animal) and only to the degree that it lives up to our representation-driven expectations of it. Like viewings of animals in zoos, such encounters "cannot but disappoint" (Berger 28) under these conditions. For one thing, it would be impossible for a solitary tour guide in a bus, however ski lied, to compete with Sir David Attenborough and the teams of filmmakers who have spent weeks and months setting up so many gorgeous slow-motion, 3-D, IMAX, high- definition, computer-enhanced shots of grizzlies snatching salmon out of roaring waterfalls, not to mention lions dragging down gazelles, gorillas staring deep into the camera lens, baboons attacking flamingos, and countless other strange and wonderful things. In a way, the animal outside the window, along with the whole trip to Alaska, can be seen as superfluous. It might make more sense to stay home and watch Animal Planet. If televisual simulations of "the look" and the wild are insufficiently 'authentic,' they may at least go further towards filling the animal-shaped hole in modern human culture than equivocal non-encounters with animals viewed televisually in the field. The Denali tour bus is only one example, of course, among a virtually infinite number that could be provided to illustrate how animal representations seem to have changed in moving from Chauvet Cave to a postmodern labyrinth of signs. How are those of us who care about animals and how we represent them supposed to find a way out of this labyrinth? Can we ever return to</page><page sequence="6">Response Essays 665 Chauvet? As ridiculous as these questions may seem to some readers, they deserve to be raised, since versions of them have animated any number of arguments about humanity's place in the world both in and out of the emerging fields of animal studies and ecocriticism. Since they are based on flawed premises, however, they can lead only to dead-ends: if not nihilism or solipsism, then technofuturist dystopian or Utopian thinking. (Why not create an Aurignacian Park, complete with sentient free- roaming woolly mammoth cyborgs and virtual reality gear that streams sights and sounds wirelessly to tourists from "wetware" devices implanted in the neocortex of biogenetically resurrected cave bears?). Alternately, we may find ourselves engaged in willful misunderstandings of art and history, or faux primitivism of the Timothy Treadwell variety, in which we insist on the purity of our own ways of seeing and representing animals, while claiming that others, whose tools and strategies of representation may in reality be indistinguishable from our own, are mired in anthropocen- tric selfishness or anthropomorphic fantasy (see Merola 652). At one point in Grizzly Man (2005), Treadwell rants - on camera, in an out-take from a carefully staged scene that he planned to use in a documentary - that the National Park Service has been guilty of "let[ting] the fucking commercial people fuck [the bears] around with their fucking cameras and shit, and the tourists ..." while he, on the other hand, has selflessly served as "the only protection for these animals out here [in Katmai National Park]," having spent many summers with them "in peace and in love, neutral, in respect." "Animals rule," he declares, holding his fist up in a Black Panther salute; "Timothy conquered!" The practical and conceptual limitations of Treadwell's extreme brand of "wilderness dualism" (Plumwood) are made painfully obvious during what director/narrator Werner Herzog describes as the "closest encounter with intruders" documented in Treadwell's footage. In it, given the chance to protect the bear he calls "Quincy" from camera- and rock-wielding fishermen and their guide ("They're going to stone him and then they're going to photograph him"), Treadwell can only keep filming from behind a screen of leaves, gasping and crying as "Quincy" is hit with a rock. He then comes out of hiding to film himself, crouching about twenty yards in front of the "intruders," performatively "submitting" his footage with quasi-military precision ("[It is] Sunday, August 1 . . . [at] 4:35 and eighteen seconds") to some unnamed</page><page sequence="7">666 jac off-camera authority. (The Park Service? Future viewers?). Are cameras weapons - as Treadwell argues in two ways in this scene - or neutral, objective windows on the wild? What Treadwell never acknowledges, at least in the footage that Herzog mined for his film, is that he may have substantially contributed to or even createdthe situation he so deplores by habituating "Quincy" and the other bears to people and their cameras.6 "Quincy's" posture towards the human "intruders" in the scene - bespeaking wariness but also curiosity, rather than hostility- - closely resembles that of the younger bears and foxes who regularly approach Treadwell's camera for a closer look, upon which he greets them with a gentle touch on the nose and some soothing words. What may seem like cowardice on Treadwell's part in the "intruders" scene is just as likely, given that Treadwell was brave enough to live among the bears for thirteen summers, a form of paralysis rooted in the nagging suspicion that he, too, is an intruder, influencing and endangering the wild bears that he claims onlytobe"neutral[ly]"studyingand"lov[ingly]"protecting - that is, when he isn't trying to become one. It would be tempting, taking a cue from Berger, to fit Treadwell's footage into a lapsarian narrative in which, after turning from hunting and gathering to plowing the soil and watching March of the Penguins, the descendants of the Chauvet painters irretrievably lose the capacity to perceive the simultaneous differences and continuities between them- selves and other animate life-forms - seeing, instead, only absolute unbridgeable difference, or likenesses based on superficial similarities, mass-media stereotypes (see Balcombe 38-39), anthropogenically modi- fied behaviors, and human traits actually bred into animals via "anthropo- morphic selection" (Serpell, qtd. in Merola 672 n. 9) or even more direct intervention in the form of genetic engineering. Perhaps a kind of scopophobia1 would be the best critical response to our culture's dangerous combination of scopophilic obsession with animal images, and ignorance about the interspecies politics at work both in the production of the images and in our everyday relationships with nonhuman beings. For example, in the case of images of chimpanzees in advertisements, feature films, and greeting cards, the most "ethical form of engagement" (Merola 659) might involve boycotting these representations and pressuring others to do the same, since they are typically made using young chimps who have</page><page sequence="8">Response Essays 667 been taken from their mothers in infancy and trained using harsh or abusive techniques; upon approaching sexual maturity at age six or seven, as Sarah T. Boysen and Valerie Kuhlmeier note, chimpanzees become impossible to work with as entertainers, at which point they are frequently "disposed of' in roadside zoos or biomedical laboratories, where they may spend their remaining forty or fifty years of life behind bars (225). Isn't the best response to the conventional representations of chimpanzees as "miniversions of ourselves in civilized settings, running playfully amok" (Siebert 77), or to "pathological relationship^]" between animals and animal representations in general (Shukin, qtd. in Merola 66 1 ), simply to turn away? On a similar note, the critic's task may be to confron t "petishism" (see Merola 651) among wildlife documentary and nature photography lovers with unsentimental exposés of the horrors inflicted on animals by image-makers whom Bill McKibben has called "nature's paparazzi" - including 'wild' (actually trained) animals shown in 'educa- tional' nature documentaries that bear an uncomfortably close resem- blance to feature films. This was the approach taken in two documenta- ries, both of them titled Cruel Camera, produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's investigative news series The Fifth Estate in 1982 and 2008. And, to a degree, it was the strategy I pursued in my 2009 essay "Ecoporn: On the Limits of Visualizing the Nonhuman." In their afterword to the volume in which "Ecoporn" appeared, M. Jimmie Killingsworth and Jacqueline S. Palmer observe that "rhetorical criticism often involves the restoring of context that the fram ing of the photographs has eliminated. Further imagery may help in such an endeavor, but resistance to the image, urged by the hermeneutics of suspicion, is the starting point" (301). The starting point, but, of course, only the starting point. The camera can certainly be cruel, but it is not necessarily or exclusively cruel. "Ultimately," Killingsworth and Palmer continue, "neglect will not suffice as a form of resistance to the reductive power of imagery, for neglect also is a form of cessation and truncation" (301). Nor will scholarly icono- clasm - the smashing of images that we fear are misleading viewers who have not attained our own advanced state of enlightenment (children, Discovery Channel junkies, "the uncritical, the illogical, the 'Other'" [Mitchell, What 7]) - because, as Mitchell demonstrates, iconoclasm</page><page sequence="9">668 jac easily morphs into a new form of idolatry by taking for granted the almost magical power of the images it attacks - a power that it had supposedly set out to deny - and, in a way, by idolizing the spectacle of the destruction of idols (21-22). Moreover, in attempting to demystify animal imagery we may end up mystifying our own positions, inasmuch as we try to disavow our own very real fascinated involvement with this imagery (including blatantly eco-pornographic representations) by pathologizing and project- ing this fascination on others, from "petishists" to "nature's paparazzi." Mitchell's call for a "critical idolism" (335), a media theory - or, rather, a "medium theory" - that acknowledges its "middling, muddling location in the midst of media" instead of treating the media as "an 'object' for scrutiny by the master discourses of theory" (22 1 ) resonates powerful ly with Nicole Merola's eloquent efforts to move beyond simply attacking Jill Greenberg's problematic uses of anthropomorphism by analyzing how this over-the-top anthropomorphism may, surprisingly, contribute to "more ethical form[s] of engagement" (659) with photographs of animals. Although Mitchell is not centrally concerned with animal anthropo- morphism per se, his thoughts on idols and iconoclasm are strikingly relevant in this context, given that the "irresistible taboo" against anthro- pomorphism (as Lorraine Daston and Gregg Mitman remind us [1]) originated not in modern science but in the drive by religions like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam to distance themselves from animist and other ' idolatrous' spiritual traditions in which the lines between humans, divine beings, and animals were distressingly (at least for worshipers of a desert sky god) fluid.8 But, the second Mosaic commandment notwithstanding, and despite years of censorious criticism (including mine) of our modern biocybernetic molten calves and high-definition 'graven images' of ani- mals, our - my - fascination with animal images only seems to grow with time, even as cutting-edge technologies appear to distance us from our ancestral attitudes towards our nonhuman kin at what seems like the speed of light, while simultaneously (paradoxically) fostering a more and more detailed understanding of the unsavory material conditions under which pictures of animals are often obtained. Mitchell, while respecting the "significant differences" that obtain "between cultures or historical or developmental stages," treats this sort of "double consciousness" as a "deep and abiding feature of human responses to representation," arguing</page><page sequence="10">Response Essays 669 both that "magical attitudes toward images are just as powerful in the modern world as they were in so-called ages of faith" and that "the ages of faith were a bit more skeptical than we give them credit for" ( What 8). Perhaps the distance between Chauvet and the Denali tour bus isn't so vast, after all. This seems to be the argument behind Janet Zweig and Laura Bergman's multimedia installation Abstraction Device (see Mitchell 326 and plate 1 5), in which a roll of computer paper, featuring copies of cave paintings of animals from Lascaux on the side of the spool, runs through a printer, where it is marked with DNA codes derived from ancient biological materials. While one could interpret the piece as offering critical commentary on genetic engineering and the conquest of reality by digital simulacra, it would make more sense to proceed from the assumption that the printer is not the only abstraction device present in the installation. The cave paintings can themselves be seen as abstraction devices, in that they allowed their painters and viewers to reflect on abstract qualities (color, form, relative size and perceived importance) of the animals among whom they lived, and to participate in well-documented, if poorly understood, networks of Palaeolithic cultural exchange that only would have made sense with the aid of abstract reasoning. DNA, too, can be approached as a kind of abstraction device, the always already biocybernetic code that has been endowing inorganic matter with meaning from the beginning. For an illustration ofMitchell's "double consciousness," we need look no further than Grizzly Man. Even as Werner Herzog criticizes Timothy Treadwell's "sentimentalized view" of "the universe in balance and in harmony," he, too, unwittingly anthropomorphizes the animals by using terms like "fornication" and "murder" to describe their behavior. He anthropomorphizes Treadwell's footage as well as the animals when he celebrates the "inexplicable magic of cinema" that is revealed when a family of foxes interrupts a scene that Treadwell is shooting with one of his favorite bears, "Mr. Chocolate." And at one point, when Treadwell is shown filming numerous takes of "Wild Timmy Jungle Scenes" in which he runs up and down a trail surrounded by trees and grass waving in a strong wind, Herzog even seems to find Treadwell guilty of failing to anthropomorphize nature and film sufficiently, noting that "in his action movie mode, Treadwell probably did not realize that seemingly empty</page><page sequence="11">670 jac moments had a strange, secret beauty. Sometimes images themselves developed their own life, their own mysterious stardom." Similarly, at the end of her introduction to Bear Portraits, Jill Greenberg moves in a few sentences from critiquing "society' s misguided anthropomorphization of all animals" to un-self-consciously observing that "my images seek to capture the awe that [bears] inspire" (emphasis added). Nicole Merola does not manage to avoid this apparently "incorrigible tendency" to "lapse into vitalistic and animistic ways of speaking when . . . talk[ing] about images" (Mitchell, What 2); she offers a smart and much-needed anatomization of the dangerous seductions of anthropomorphism for people who create and view photographs of animals, while unhesitatingly ascribing to Greenberg's work the uncanny power to "simultaneously seduce and discomfit, delight and disturb the viewer" and implyingthat the kind of symphysis one can experience with animals via visual representa- tions is very close to the symphysis one might feel in the actual presence of an animal (645, 670). Needless to say, my "Ecoporn" essay was full of similar moments, and industrious readers will surely find numerous "lapses" of this nature here. The point is not that we need to purge our scholarship of these sorts of inconsistencies. As Mitchell shows through- out What Do Pictures Want?, they are basically everywhere, and, furthermore, "there is no use dismissing the notion of the living image as a mere metaphor or an archaism." Rather, Mitchell writes, "it is better seen as an incorrigible, unavoidable metaphor that deserves analysis" (54). But if it's truly incorrigible, unavoidable, irresistible, then shouldn't we feel free to indulge in the "unconstrained use of anthropomorphism," as the scientific "slayers" of cognitive ethology and related fields - those who deny consciousness and agency to animals, or at least dispute the notion that humans could learn anything meaningful about these phenomena by studying animal behavior - seem to think that ethologists will do if they fail to bring the "disease" or "cardinal crime" of anthropomorphism under control (Bekoff 49-50, 87-89)? Clearly not, any more than, as Renato Rosaldo puts it, "airline pilots, invoking the limitations of human fallibility, should blind their eyes." Rosaldo's memorable way of describing how anthropologists should deal with the fact that they are "somewhat impartial and somewhat partisan, somewhat innocent and somewhat complicit [in the legacies of colonialism]" ( 1 07) certainly pertains to the study of animal</page><page sequence="12">Response Essays 67 1 images in the humanities, where the challenge is to develop theories that account for the fascination we feel in viewing representations of animals, as well as our partial complicity in the acts of exploitation and over- identification that frequently make them possible, without surrendering the ability to engage with the ethics of producing, viewing, and interpreting them. What we need, it seems to me, is a kind of critical anthropomorphism that would place W. J. T. Mitchell's "critical idolism" in dialogue with the ethological models of critical (or biocentric) anthropomorphism that Gordon Burghardt began elaborating twenty years ago. Burghardt has framed critical anthropomorphism as a way in which students of animal behavior can generate scientifically valid research questions by con- sciously factoring in, rather than studiously ignoring, such things as personal intuition and emotional identification with animals, in addition to more conventional sources of ideas like prior research. Critical anthropo- morphism in the humanities would not enshrine ethologists as the ultimate authorities on what animals are or what images of them might mean, but it would turn to science when trying, for example, to unravel some of the complexities of human-animal relationships in the making ofwildlife films, or when attempting to distinguish between superficially anthropomorphic interpretations of an animal' s behavior and more plausible explanations of what the behavior may be communicating to members of the animal' s own species. By the same token, critical anthropomorphism could intervene when anti-anthropomorphic attitudes among scientists threaten to tip over into the sort of iconoclasm-turned-idolatry that Mitchell identifies in the work ofFrancis Bacon, whoexplicitly dedicated science to the elimination of "idols of the mind," but in the process unwittingly idolized modern Western worldviews at the expense of "ancient wisdom" and non- Western "sources of knowledge" (Mitchell, What 189-91). As Erica Fudge argues in addressing the tortu(r)ous logic that underpins many forms of animal experimentation - in which animals are held to be almost exactly like us (physically) and utterly different (mentally) at precisely the same moment - Bacon, along with Descartes, helped commit science to a view of animals that resulted in many practices and studies that can fairly be described as ¿/«scientific (93-1 1 0). For instance, in choosing to ignore compelling evolutionary, physiological, and behavioral evidence that other</page><page sequence="13">672 jac primates feel pain just as intensely as (if not more intensely than) humans, pain researchers may have freed science from pre-modern or non- Western forms of anthropomorphism, but they have enmeshed them- selves in another kind of anthropomorphism by symbolically transforming their non-human subjects in the image of a uniquely human invention: the robot. Critical anthropomorphism in the humanities would be well posi- tioned to challenge science when it strays from the realm of sound logic and dispassionate proof into the kingdom of lethal fairy tales, or what Donna Haraway calls "god tricks" (88). I say "would" and "could," but of course, as my reference to Haraway is meant to acknowledge, some varieties of critical anthropomorphism - or, perhaps, the "[c]areful practice of therio-anthropo-morphisms," as Haraway calls it in recognition of the co-constitutive, rather than merely unidirectional, nature of human and animal shapings of each other (375 n. 55) - have been around for quite a while. Haraway' s work on National Geographic's Crittercam documentaries and countless other representa- tions of animals comes immediately to mind, as does Fudge's reading of a famous 1961 photograph of the "space chimp" Ham (a.k.a. "#65"), in which the chimp seems to be smiling but is most likely baring his teeth in fear after surviving a stressful test of the Mercury-Redstone rocket system (25-27). Nicole Merola's attemptto "illuminat[e]" Jill Greenberg's fascinating but disturbing animal photographs - by, in part, revealing how Greenberg uses elaborate lighting arrays to help humanize her nonhuman subjects - constitutes another excellent example both of critical anthropo- morphism and of what Mitchell calls "Showing Seeing," his label for an exercise that "overcome[s] the veil of familiarity and self-evidence that surrounds the experience of seeing" and "turn[s] it into a problem for analysis" ( What 337). We could even create an analogy based on the relationship between Merola's scholarship and Greenberg's photography: critical anthropomorphism isto superficial anthropomorphism not as light is to darkness, but rather as Merola's "illuminations" are to Greenberg's "shiny-ness." My purpose in adapting Burghardt's idea for the humanities is to draw attention to some of the possibilities that may open up when we try to factor in anthropomorphism's apparently inescapable pull on the human mind, working from a position of avowed impurity rather than spurious objectivity. Merola's essay and the work of other figures in</page><page sequence="14">Response Essays 673 animal studies suggest that the idea of critical anthropomorphism may prove useful in promoting further multidisciplinary investigations into the following issues: • Anthropomorphism in (co-) evolutionary context : [a] Focusing on anthropomorphism's basis in neurobiology, and articulating links between its evolution and the development of art and language; [b] learning more about how anthropomorphism re- lates to similar phenomena in other species, and how this may complicate our understanding of speciesism and anthropo- centrism; [c] inquiring into how anthropomorphism may have itself been shaped by human relationships with members of other species, such as dogs. • Anthropomorphism in cultural and historical context: [a] Developing more precise and nuanced understandings of how modern Western forms of anthropomorphism compare and con- nect with pre-modern and non- Western versions; [b] tracking the evolution of ideas about anthropomorphism within and between different religious, scientific, and aesthetic discourses; [c] exam- ining how iconoclastic anti-anthropomorphism has fed into the objectification of animals and the animalization of people under Western scientific and colonial paradigms. • Types, purposes, and degrees of anthropomorphism: [a] Distin- guishing (following Randall Lockwood) between such catego- ries as allegorical anthropomorphism, personification, superficial and explanatory anthropomorphism, and the more critical variet- ies; [b] addressing the varied uses of anthropomorphism in the service of different ethical, political, racial, sexual, commercial, religious, and other agendas; [c] determining the extent to which representations ascribe uniquely human characteristics to ani- mals, or, conversely, highlight evolutionary continuities be- tween humans and members of other species in scientifically plausible ways. (On this note, it is worth pointing out that the photographs in Jill Greenberg's Monkey Portraits generally avoid treating their simian subjects like clowns - no "smiling" chimpanzees here - and sometimes refrain from ascribing emo- tional states to them at all; the amount of Photoshopping also varies widely from image to image.)</page><page sequence="15">674 jac • The play of human and animal agency in anthropomorphic images: [a] Accounting for the ways in which captive animals anthropomorphize themselves in response to trainers, who ex- ploit pre-existing animal behaviors and appearances to anthropo- morphic effect, as well as to image-makers, whose purposes differ from those of trainers; [b] re-assessing the history and aesthetics of "ecoporn" to see what it can teach us about interspecies relationships, and not just one-way objectifications of non- human beings; [c] mapping the mostly unexplored archive of filmmakers', photographers', and artists' accounts of working with animal subjects; [d] finding more precise ways to assess the ethical impact of anthropomorphic images on viewers, and re- flecting on the role of viewer agency in the meaning-making process (see Burt 48). • The materialities of anthropomorphism: [a] Treating film, for instance, not just as a way of framing animals symbolically but as "an extension of other [material] practices of human-animal relations which impact on filmmaking at every level" (Burt 88); [b] further scrutinizing "the central place of the animal in the devel- opment of film technology" (Burt 85) and, by extension, that of other artistic technologies; [c] identifying pathological relation- ships where they exist (as in the use of gelatin in photography [see Shukin's second chapter; Merola 660-61], or the photographic industry's history of pollution and the publishing industry's role in deforestation), but also paying more attention to self-con- scious and creative uses of animal materials in anthropomorphic representations. Examples: The twenty-fourth riddle in the tenth- century Anglo-Saxon Exeter Book, in which the "animalness of medieval writing" (Holsinger 620) is on full literal and figurative display as a sheep or goat describes its violent death and transformation into a vellum Bible; the "botched taxidermy" works profiled by Steve Baker, which frequently re-purpose road- killed animals or discarded trophy heads of deer to create disturb- ing and ethically challenging new forms of animal art.9 • The genres and styles of anthropomorphism: [a] Attending (more carefully than I have done in this essay!) to crucial generic differences between anthropomorphic visual representations in cave paintings, cartoons, wildlife films, advertisements, video games, scientific photography, animal rights campaigns, and so on; [b] further exploring the " suture of . . . aesthetic style[s]"</page><page sequence="16">Response Essays 675 developed for representing humans "to nonhuman animal sub- jects" in different genres and formats (Merola 646; emphasis added); [c] following Cynthia Chris' lead, in Watching Wildlife , in tracing the development of hybrid anthropomorphic genres (animal cop shows, animal 'crime' scene investigation shows, for example, Anatomy of a Shark Bite [2003]) in emerging media environments; [d] followingthe lead of W. J. T. Mitchell and other theorists of word/picture relationships in drawing distinctions between linguistic and visual forms of anthropomorphism, and making sense of translations of animal images across media borders. • Making anthropomorphism visible in criticism as well as popular culture: [a] Taking a cue from disciplines like whiteness studies in exposing anthropo-morphism and -centrism's natural- ized and normally invisible operations in human culture, but acknowledging that anthropomorphic perspectives are rooted in human biology as well as culture, and thus (to return to Bacon's "idols") cannot simply be "renounced and put away with a solemn and fixed determination, and the understanding thor- oughly freed and cleansed" (qtd. in Mitchell, What 191); [b] documenting anthropomorphism's roles in the formation of humanism, the humanities, and the development of reigning ideas of "the human" and "the animal"; [c] contributing to the reformu- lation of "the human" and "the animal" in the "posthuman ities" (see Wolfe), while resisting the anthropomorphic objectification of animals in modern agricultural regimes as well as in science, and interrogating projects that anthropomorphize animals and other life-forms completely by reducing them to pure genetic and/or digital information that can be edited at will (see Grigely 80; Merola 664). • Analyzing the " mysterious stardom " of animal images (Herzog): [a] Coming to terms with the animal image as "a rupture in the field of representation" both with respect to "the way it unavoidably points beyond itself to wider issues" and "in its capacity to resist or problematize its own meanings . . ." (Burt 1 1-1 3); [b] building a critical vocabulary for interpreting the dynamic relationship between Benjamin's "aura," or Mitchell's "image life," and Berger' s "look," for example, by figuring out what our responses to images of animals owe to our experiences with actual animals, and vice versa; [c] tracing the quasi-viral or meme-like ability of</page><page sequence="17">676 jac certain animal images to spread or 'evolve' in disregard of conscious human interventions, or to subvert their creators' intentions for them; [d] redefining (and questioning redefinitions of) animal life and image life in the context of the extinction crisis and revolutions in biocybernetic technology that blur bound- aries between these forms of life on an increasingly massive scale. On this last note, I can't help but think of five images in Jill Greenberg's Monkey Portraits and Bear Portraits that exemplify a kind of critical anthropomorphism of their own, in spite of all the other less ethically productive examples of anthropomorphism that Merola anatomizes. As mentioned earlier, Greenberg announces in her introduction to Bear Portraits that her images "seek to capture the awe that [bears] inspire." Directly facing this line of text, however, reside two small images of bears that question this process even as they embody it. The photograph on the left features a heavily Photoshopped baby bear, who looks quite a bit like a hand-colored black-and-white photograph from the early twentieth century, drinking milk from a bottle held by a jarringly ««-Photoshopped human hand; the bear and the hand/bottle seem to exist in two different dimensions - or, rather, the two-dimensionality of the bear clashes vio- lently with the apparent three-d imensionality of the hand . It is as if a picture of a baby bear had come to life and started drinking from an actual bottle. The portrait on the right shows a hyperreal, Photoshopped ' roaring' polar bear, caught somewhere between the Discovery Channel and the world of computer-animated talking polar bears familiar to viewers of the 2007 Hollywood version of The Golden Compass. But the image on the right is botched (Baker) or ruptured (Burt) to a more disconcerting degree than the first photograph, because it partially reveals the world beyond the set' s white backdrop, including trees, grass, sky, a portable fence, and one of Greenberg's normally hidden lights (see Merola 675 n. 29). A full-page version of the polar bear photograph, whose expanded frame draws even more attention to the bear's human-controlled environment, can be found in the book' s 'centerfold. ' There it faces a photograph of a ' roaring' grizzly that is also botched - indeed, doubly botched. In addition to incorporating another (deliberately accidental) partial view of trees and sky along one edge, the grizzly photograph includes a detail that is impossible to reconcile with the usual Photoshopped shiny-ness of Greenberg's animals' fur and</page><page sequence="18">Response Essays 677 the clean, abstract, texture-free qualities of her backdrops: the grizzly is standing on a dirty plywood floor.10 Taken together, these bear photo- graphs virtually force viewers to ponder how their lives as images, which depend on the attemptto capture awe in photographs, relate to the captivity of their subjects - the literal capturing (and training, feeding, grooming, transporting, and so on) of these bears. The images also gesture towards the impossibility of photographically capturing the awe that one would experience in meeting a bear in the wild, or even in working with a live grizzly on a plywood set; they may seekůás kind of capture, in Greenberg' s words, but can never fully obtain it. In the process they place (as it were) ironic quotation marks around the bears, seeming to stress that they are more about the long history of stereotypical roaring bears in TV shows and movies than about these particular nonhuman individuals. Even so, the photographs manage to enact an unusual sort of wi ldness by deconstructing themselves, leading the viewer's eye back and forth between their more anthropomorphic and less anthropomorphic visual elements, essentially showing anthropomorphism at work. They are wild (that is, self-willed) images, even if the bears who star in them are no longer fully wild." Two of the most disturbing images in Monkey Portraits, "Welcome to Your Fascist Future" and "Scoldy," take this wildness even further. Although the bears in the portraits described above may resemble toys, computer-animated animal characters, and other representations of bears, the phylogenetic identity ofthe portraits' subjects is never seriously in question. They may look a bit more like humans than bears viewed with the naked eye, but no one would confuse them with photographs of humans in bear costumes. In Monkey Portraits, as Merola observes, Greenberg frequently exploits the greater "relative similarity in human and simian physiognomy" to create forms of "'sympathetic' identification" that are much harder to evoke using images of bears (654-55). In "Welcome to Your Fascist Future" and "Scoldy," however, straightforward anthropo- morphic identification - a unidirectional movement in which the animal is likened to the human and crucial species differences are brushed aside - gives way to a potentially infinite flux of identity back and forth across the human-animal boundary. In these portraits, despite all we may know on a conscious level about how they were created, it becomes virtually impossible on another, more visceral, level to determine whether we are</page><page sequence="19">678 jac looking at a monkey who has been Photoshopped to look like a human, or a human whose image has been altered to resemble that of a monkey. And the impossibility of resolving this visual problem only invites continuous fresh attempts even as it frustrates them. Like the famous Duck-Rabbit illustration, My Wife and My Mother-in-Law, the Necker cube, and other multistable metapictures examined by W. J. T. Mitchell in Picture Theory, "Welcome" and "Scoldy" are "about difference and similitude, the shifting of names and identities ... in the field of vision." Also, like the Duck-Rabbit, they "solici[t] the self-knowledge of the human eye by aligning it with the eye of the animal, depicted as a still center across which waves of shifting identity may be seen to flow" {Picture 56). In the case of Greenberg' s photographs, though, the shifting identities in question are neither both animal (as with the Duck-Rabbit) nor both human (as in My Wife and My Mother-in-Law). Compounding this is the fact that the monkey in "Welcome" is directing what primatologist Frans de Waal calls a "confrontational stare"12 at someone or something not far from the camera, while in "Scoldy" she is looking directly (and, it seems, very sternly) into Greenberg's lens. It is thus impossible to contain the identity shift within the edges of the photographs. Setting in motion (rather than "capturing") an endless movement not just between the 'animality' and 'humanity' of the monkey, but between the human-ness and the primate- ness of the viewer, "Welcome" and "Scoldy" solicit self-knowledge of a visual and cognitive process that is far more central to human identity than our inability to stabilize figure and ground in the Necker cube: namely, the process by which we differentiate human faces and forms from the nonhuman. This process must also, of course, be situated historically and culturally. In that regard, the photographs definitely blur what Jeremy Bentham called the "insuperable line" between humans and animals in modern Western cultures (qtd. in Shanks 83), but it would be more precise to argue that they simultaneously render the normally invisible act of drawing this line disconcertingly visible, and showcase the growing difficulty of drawing the line with any degree of certainty. This makes them especially appropriate metapictures for, and of, Mitchell's "age of biocybernetic reproduction," a point in history when post-Darwinian bioethics crashes head-on with post-Darwinian experi- mental hybridizations of humans and animals. As Joseph Grigely writes in</page><page sequence="20">Response Essays 679 an essay in which he relates textual studies and the Photoshopped hybrid creatures in supermarket tabloids to the "posthuman bodies" of modern science and theory, "[o]ur natural world is no longer just a natural world, but a world that lives and breathes in the space between The Origin of Species and the Weekly World News" (82). In fact, "Welcome to Your Fascist Future" bears a strong resemblance to images of the best-known Photoshopped character in the Weekly World News, Bat Boy, a runaway cave-dwellingtherianthropic hybrid ormutant whose unforgettable scream- ing face and unbelievable story express a generation' s anxieties over how the "insuperable line" is being breached and redrawn again and again in the flesh of living things, almost as fast as such transformations can be envisioned using Photoshop. It is almost too appropriate that the non- human individual depicted in both "Welcome" and "Scoldy," identified in the "Who's Who" section at the end of Monkey Portraits as Asia, is a rhesus macaque, a member of a species that has embodied the paradoxes of animal testing perhaps more than any other primate, since rhesus monkeys have both stood in for humans (that is, been 'like' us) and borne the brunt of human speciesism (that is, been utterly 'unlike' us) in contexts ranging from research on AIDS, cloning, and biowarfare to the psycholo- gist Harry Harlow's infamous "wire mother" experiments on maternal deprivation. (While the "Who's Who" section of Monkey Portraits indicates that a number of Greenberg's simian subjects are, like many of her human subjects, bona fide celebrities, having appeared in everything from Ace Ventura: Pet Detective to The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, the only entry in Asia's "Credits" is " Medical Investigations "). Based on Greenberg's introduction - "For anyone who doubts Darwin (ahem, Mr. President), look in the monkey mirror and think again" - the "fascist future" against which Asia seems to be reacting so strongly would appear to be an era defined by George W. Bush-inspired conservative politics (see Merola 647-48). But, as with Greenberg's bear portraits, the wild lives of "Welcome to Your Fascist Future" and "Scoldy" evade the simple anthropomorphic (or zoomorphic) political "capture" that Greenberg's Planet of the Apes- style "monkey mirror" metaphor attempts to impose on them.13 If Asia's portraits can be said to engage with a fascist future at all, it may be a future characterized more by corporate, scientific, artistic, and legal battles over the power to transform human and animal</page><page sequence="21">680 jac identity in the service of competing quasi-fascist Utopian projects than one defined by anti-Darwinism or conventional political repression. It should be clear that, while I wholeheartedly support Nicole Merola' s efforts to help viewers and critics of photography move beyond the more superficial varieties of anthropomorphism, I do not believe that the search for a totally "non-anthropomorphic relationality" (649; emphasis added) would produce many viable explanations of how "ethical encounter[s]" with animals work in "the realm of representational media" (670), any more than the concerted efforts of science to rid itself of anthropomor- phism have resulted in ethically satisfying models of human-animal interaction. As I have indicated, this is especially true in light of the common tendency to anthropomorphize animal representations, the subjects of our critical representational practices, even when we are critiquing the ways in which they themselves anthropomorphize their animal subjects. Instead of viewing this tendency as a form of hypocrisy, perhaps we should treat it as evidence of the considerable power of animal images to keep mattering, physically as well as ethically, over thirty thousand years after Chauvet. Critical anthropomorphism may prove to be an important approach through which ecocritics and animal studies scholars can intervene in the debates that will have a profound impact on the biosphere as our anthropomorphic drives, not being content with painting animals on cave walls or re-shaping images of them via Photoshop, continue pushing us towards ever-more-controversial imag(in)ings of the human, and the animal, in the living flesh. University of North Florida Jacksonville, Florida Notes 1 . While we will never know exactly what the cave paintings meant to those who created and viewed them, or who these creators and viewers actually were (shamans and worshippers, full-time artists and patrons, or something else?), I have tried to avoid straying too far from descriptions of Chauvet provided by Jean Clottes and the contributors to the official Chauvet website. This sketch also draws on Linda Kalof (1-10), William Faulkner's "The Bear," and Sid Marty's</page><page sequence="22">Response Essays 681 analysis of indigenous North American relationships with bears in The Black Grizzly of Whiskey Creek (22-23). 2. This sketch is loosely based on Amy Clary's description of technology- enhanced Denali wildlife tours in her conference paper "Wild Images: Simulation and Scopophilia on the 'Last Frontier.'" 3. See Clottes 23-25. 4. See Haraway 383 n. 1 1 . 5 . Of course it might be argued that the tour bus arrangement is better for bears and hapless tourists alike, or that the video camera as a tool for image enhancement does not qualitatively differ from more traditional tools like individual cameras equipped with telephoto lenses. I remain concerned, however, about the implica- tions of reducing animals to pure televisual spectacle in this manner. Since they're already in Denali, couldn't these tourists at least be encouraged to stand outside the bus (with binoculars in hand) while watching the bear? 6. The possibility that Treadwell did more harm than good by habituating bears to close human contact is raised in the film in an interview between Herzog and Sven Haakanson, Jr., the curator of Kodiak Island's Alutiiq Museum. In The Grizzly Maze: Timothy Treadwell 's Fatal Obsession with Alaskan Bears , Nick Jans reports on an interview with one "furious" (anonymous) bear biologist who fulminates that Treadwell's "illegal and absolutely selfish . . . touchy-feely Beanie Baby approach" violated a "prime biological directive" in that it "alter[ed] the behavior of his subjects, therefore tainting any results and rendering them useless to researchers. Not to mention permanently altering the behavior of entire populations of bears" (161-62). Jans also quotes two guides, Perry Molían and John Bartolino, who frequently found themselves being filmed from the bushes by Treadwell, and goes on to observe that Treadwell kept the National Park Service apprised via letter of what he called "unsavory human behavior" vis-à- vis the bears (66). 7. See Killingsworth and Palmer on "the endless repetitions ... of the poststructuralist critique of 'The Gaze,' a virtual scopophobic reaction to the scopophilia of Western visual culture" (302). 8. Mitchell notes that the King James version ofthe Bible uses the same term, "abomination," to attack both idols and animals (at least ritual ly "unclean" ones), and voices the suspicion that "the association of the animate image with beasts is ... a crucial feature of pictorial desire" ( What 34 n. 1 8). 9. Baker uses the term "botched taxidermy" to "characterize those instances of recent art practice where things . . . appear to have gone wrong with the animal, as it were, but where it still holds together " (55-56). 10. Numerous other photographs in Bear Portraits retain the dirty floor, which Greenberg presumably could have cleaned up with a few clicks of her mouse in Photoshop if she had wanted to. Another jarring portrait shows a Photoshopped bear chewing on a gory hunk of meat.</page><page sequence="23">682 jac 1 1. I am again indebted to Mitchell, who writes in Picture Theory of the "wildness" of the self-referential image, or metapicture, its "resistance to domes- tication, and its associations with primitivism, savagery, and animal behavior" (57). 12. De Waal's book can be approached as an aesthetically fascinating and scientifically instructive companion volume to Greenberg's Monkey Portraits , since de Waal represents some of the same species and behaviors as Greenberg, but does so in precise, un-doctored black-and-white photographs, accompany- ing the images with detailed notes in which he situates the photographs and the individuals they portray in appropriate evolutionary, (auto)biographical, and historical contexts. An interesting tension between the photographs' status as primatological records and as aesthetic artifacts does run through the book; however, de Waal takes pains to address misconceptions about primate facial expressions, for instance, whereas Greenberg does not distinguish between superficial resemblances and deeper evolutionary homologues shared by hu- mans and other primates. 1 3 . In her introduction to Bear Portraits , Greenberg places her work within the same political context, recalling that she originally intended to use the "epic . . . power" and "animalistic rage" of bears as an "analogy" for the anger that anonymous bloggers directed at her End Times series, in which crying children had stood in (via titles like "Four More Years [of George W. Bush]," "Grand Old Party," and "Nucular") for the "helplessness" and "outrage" that Greenberg felt over such things as the "false reasons [that were given] for going to war [in Iraq]" {End Times', see Merola 647-48). Greenberg goes on to say, however, that her intentions changed as she continued working with bears; the desire to use them analogically yielded to an interest in bears in their own right, as "creatures of immense power, emotion, and beauty" ( Bear Portraits).
