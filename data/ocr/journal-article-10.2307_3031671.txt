<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literary Art in Defoe's Tour: The Rhetoric of Growth and Decay PAT ROGERS IT IS TWENTY YEARS since Godfrey Davies opened an article with the stark judgment, "None of the larger works of Defoe has received so little actual attention as the Tour."' This comment remains as ac- curate today. In the last two decades we have had the first collection of Defoe's letters, the standard bibliography, and one major biogra- phy-quite apart from a growing critical debate on the novels. This makes it all the harder to justify scholarly neglect of the Tour.2 Apart from anything else, A Tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain (1724-26) represents the author's mature literary artistry. Coming where it does in the canon, it draws on something more than his accumulated experience as reporter, spy, and social observer. It derives, too, from the creative enterprises which had occupied Defoe in the preceding five years. The truth is that the Tour functions in a more rewarding and inward fashion than has been generally recog- nised. Defoe gives us abundant documentation of English life, cer- tainly. But the interest of the Tour is not confined to the social and economic data it provides. The book deploys the resources available to a great imaginative writer, and it supplies less a picture of Britain than a vision of nationhood. 1 Godfrey Davies, "Daniel Defoe's A Tour thro' the whole Island of Great Bri- tain," MP, 48 (1950-51), 21-36. Davies' article is concerned with the various editions of the Tour which appeared until 1778. On scholarly and other reaction to the Tour, see also the introduction to my annotated abridgment of the work (Penguin, 1971) and my forthcoming volume on Defoe in the Critical Heritage series. 2 The only full-length study is that of Helmut Singer, Daniel Defoe. A Tour through England and Wales. Eine kulturgeschichtliche Studie (Leipzig, 1938), which confines itself to the English and Welsh sections. Singer's dissertation deals only with social and economic aspects of the Tour: Part I, with Die Gesellschaft, Part II, with Die Landwirtschaft. It relies on obsolete sources and contributes virtually nothing to a literary understanding of the book. On the modern "apotheosis" of Moll, see Ian Watt, "The Recent Critical Fortunes of Moll Flanders," ECS, 1 (Fall 1967), 109-26. 153</page><page sequence="2">154 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES The aim of this paper is to draw attention to three principal ways in which Defoe shapes his Tour so that it transcends mere guidebook status. One of these relates chiefly to structure, the other two concern the handling of language. Other aspects of the book's method would repay consideration; for instance, the question of point of view in the Tour, that is, the management of the authorial voice. Space forbids such enquiry here. Nor have I attempted to relate the various devices which I describe to Defoe's practice as a creative writer. It seems like- ly, however, that a number of fruitful comparisons could be made on the basis of the evidence presented here. I have noted how untypical of the novels certain stylistic usages of the Tour are; otherwise, I have forborne cross references. As a final proviso, it should be noted that the argument of this paper takes for granted (though it does not depend on) one large as- sumption. The making of the Tour has never been thoroughly inves- tigated, and its date of composition remains open to speculation. A priori it would be possible to hold that, since the book obviously in- cludes material garnered twenty or more years earlier, it may have been substantially completed some time before publication. This is a matter to which I have given separate attention, and it is enough here to make explicit my broad conclusions.3 These are that the Tour was indeed written from 1722 to 1725, and that Defoe's claim to have made a special journey for the purpose of his book was probably an honest one. If so, we are on firm ground in allocating the work to a period immediately after the composition of Defoe's celebrated "imaginative" books-the novels, the Journal of the Plagite Year, the Memoirs of a Cavalier-so long as we recall that the date of their composition is not very accurately known. The first aspect of Defoe's literary skill manifested in the Tour re- lates to its structure. Now the immediate and, as it were, effective model for the book is supposed to be [John Macky's I A Journey 3 In an article prepared for the press, "The Making of Defoe's Tolur," I have set out in detail the reasons for this dating. There is abundant evidence that Defoe must, at the very least, have carried out a full-scale revision of the Tour as late as the year of publication-1724-25-26 respectively for the three volumes.</page><page sequence="3">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 155 through England. In Familiar Letters (1714-23).' One has only to glance at this work to see how defective is its organisation. Macky writes a series of short letters, many of which have no organic base as regards subject matter. A chapter finishes when Macky has used up enough pages, rather than when geographic necessity prescribes. London sprawls over from Letter IX in the first volume to Letter XIV, and turns up again in the second volume. Macky has to make a special "excursion" to Bedfordshire: otherwise, as he remarks, it would have been left out. He digresses quite shamelessly on the state of the English language, improved by Sir Roger L'Estrange amongst others-the hack of Swift's Tale could do no more. Beleaguered in the Isle of Man. he calmly observes that he has omitted certain "ex- crescences" and proceeds to fill the gaps. Cornwall might perhaps qualify for this description, stretching a point, but the Lincolnshire fens cannot be said to lie very far from the heart of the country. At this point, too, Macky introduces an account of the orders of society, more appropriate perhaps to the Almanach de Gotha.` Much more serious is the fact that Macky confines himself to largish towns and to the seats of the gentry. There is virtually nothing about the interven- ing countryside or about the route taken. In short, "Journey" is a misnomer. What Macky gives us is a guidebook-a series of entries for places of interest. It would scarcely matter if the putative top- ographical framework were demolished, and the work presented as an alphabetical sequence-Blackheath, Blandford, Blenheim, Bod- min, Boston, and so on. With Defoe everything is different. Not only does he maintain a clear itinerary, with the progress from one county to another care- fully charted: he employs a number of shifts to give the reader a sense of movement. Prospects unfold as we pass through the country, land- scapes emerge before our gaze and fall away, contrasting scenes fol- low one another in smooth succession. This is partly a matter of De- foe's greater visual acuity as compared with Macky's; but it has to do with fundamentals of his literary method. From the outset of the first journey, it is evident that Defoe has a marked awareness of formal design: 4 This is the title of the first two volumes (1714, 1722). The third volume appeared as A Journey throlugh1 Scotland (1723). This book is allotted to Defoe by D. C. Browning (p. xvii of the Everyman edition-see note 6 below). 5 See Macky, Journal, II, 223 ff., 231 ff., 236 ff.</page><page sequence="4">156 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES I began my Travels, where I Purpose to End them, viz. At the City of Lon- don, and therefore my Account of the City itself will come last, that is to say, at the latter End of my Southern Progress; and as in the Course of this Jour- ney I shall have many Occasions to call it a Circuit, if not a Circle ... Again, at the start of Letter V: "As I am now near the Center of this Work, so I am to describe the Center of England, the City of London, and Parts adjacent" (I, 316). When Defoe added his third volume, partly in response to Macky's Journey through Scotland (1723), this second observation ceased to be literally true. But this does not affect the major issue: London is repeatedly described as the nexus of trade, society, fashion, wealth, and its fulcral position in the economic life of the nation stressed.7 It is therefore appropriate that Defoe should construct his first two volumes around a series of trips to and from London, now in one direction, now another. The layout of the tour enacts the processes of human geography. As the book develops, Defoe employs one crucial strategy to for- ward this "enactment" function. What he does is to choose expres- sions which apply both to the progress of his (in effect, fictional) tour and to the description which he is offering to the reader. Often this is simple enough-a matter of a single word ("But to return to my Passage up the River," I, 41).8 It may be explicit in a passage of ex- planatory comment: "I had still the County of Cambridge to visit, to compleat this Tour of the Eastern Part of England, and of that I come now to speak" (I, 77). On other occasions, there is a more complex and effective intermingling of the progress of the journey and the progress of the narrative: I now draw near to Cambridge, to which I fansy I look as if I was afraid to come, having made so many Circumlocutions beforehand; but I must yet make another Digression before I enter the Town; (for in my way, and as I 6 A Tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain, ed.

In an age of computerised literary study, it should be added that my word-counts are "hand" calculations, which means they are likely to be underestimates.</page><page sequence="5">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 157 came in from New Market, about the beginning of September;) I cannot omit, that I came necessarily through Sturbridge Fair ... (I, 80) Here the term "Digression" has much the force of a pun. It is through such linking devices that Defoe establishes the "reality" of his tour, whilst at the same time advancing the course of his own narrative. So vital is this bonding technique, and so important is simple rep- etition in Defoe's rhetoric, that further illustration is ne-eded. At times, the author spells out the connection between his artistic plan and the actual route he is covering: "From Cambridge, my Design obliging me, and the direct Road, in part concurring, I came back thro' the West part of the County of Essex" (I, 88). Sometimes Defoe appears to admit that the union of effects is a mere whimsical fancy, to be indulged but not believed: "About four Miles, over those de- licious Downs, brings us to Epsome, and if you will suppose me to come there in the Month of July, or thereabouts, you may think me to come in the middle of the Season" (I, 159). In places, the punning intent comes to the surface with conscious wordplay: "My last Letter ended the Account of my Travels, where Nature ended her Account, when she meeted out the Island, and where she fix'd the utmost West- ern Bounds of Britain" (I, 254). The word "digress" is exploited more than once, because of its ability to straddle journey and narrative: "'And, having mentioned Andover, though out of the Road that I was in, I must digress to tell you, that the Town of Andover lies ... ." (I, 289). A similar use is made of "excursion," as at the start of Letter VI: "I have spent so much Time, and taken up so much room in my Description of London, and the adjacent Parts, that I must be the more cautious, at least, as to needless Excursions in the Country near it" (I, 380).9 In this connection the motif of the "tour" or "circuit" mentioned in the very first paragraph I quoted, is of special value to Defoe. The word "circuit" figures about thirty times throughout the book. More than half of these occurrences are found near the start or the end of a journey, where the narrator is most conscious of his aims and means. A representative passage comes in Letter VIII: The only Towns of any Note that are to be found on the North Bank of the Trent, are Nottingham, and the other Burton, of which I shall speak in their 9 Other occurrences of "excursion" are at II, 467, 539, 765, 802.</page><page sequence="6">158 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES Order; at present, as I took a different Circuit in my Riding, I must do so in my Account of it also, or else if my Pen does not follow my Foot, I shall wan- der rather than travel, at least in my paper, whatever I did on my Horse. (II, 546) A major part of the Tour's rhetorical energy is expanded in the am- bition to make Defoe's pen follow his foot. Often this desire is re- flected in a direct appeal to the reader: "I cannot but . .. desire you, my Friend, to travel with me through this houling Wilderness in your Imagination, and you shall soon find all that is wonderful about it" (II, 566). Even where apostrophe as such is not in question, Defoe employs a sort of indirect address: "It would require a long Treatise of Commerce to enter into that [question]: But that I may not bring you into the Labyrinth, and not show you the way out, I shall, in three short Heads, describe . . ." (II, 613). The most interesting development of the idea of the tour occurs in Letter VIII also. Having thus passed the Rubicon (Trent) and set my Face Northward, I scarce knew which Way to set forward, in a Country too so full of Wonders, and on so great a Journey, and yet to leave nothing behind me to cali on as I came back, at least not to lead me out of my Way in my Return. But then considering that I call this Work, a Tour, and the Parts of it, Letters; I think, that tho' I shall go a great Length forward, and shall endeavour to take Things with me as I go; yet I may take a Review of some Parts as I came back, and so may be allowed to pick up any Fragments I may have left be- hind in my going out. (II, 552) The most striking element in this paragraph is the constant inter- action between what might be called topographic placing and nar- rative placing (note especially passed, set my Face, set forward, leave behind, came back, out of my Way, in my Return, go a great Length forward, as I go, take a Review, going out). It is apparent that Defoe effects the interplay chiefly through verbs and adverbial phrases. Throughout the work, indeed, he makes verbs do most to leap this aperture: "But I must land, lest this Part of the Account seems to smell of the Tarr, and I should tire the Gentlemen with leading them out of their Knowledge" (I, 351). Or "But though I am backward to dip into Antiquity, yet no English Man ... can go to Carlisle, and not step aside to see the Monument of King Edward I" (II, 687). Again, "If I may straggle a little into Antiquity" (II, 508). A common ad-</page><page sequence="7">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 159 verbial formula is "in my Course" (I, 299), which has the same ca- pacity to look both ways. By this means Defoe gives point and direction to his tour, so that it acquires a trajectory-something Macky's seriatim technique for- bids. Even where he is forced into what could be an awkward ex- planation, he manages things far more adroitly and naturally than Macky, who seems clumsy and naive by contrast. A good example can be found in the second letter. Here I remember'd that I had yet left the Inland Towns of the Two Counties of Kent and Sussex, and almost all the county of Surrey out of my Accounit; and that having as it were taken a Circuit round the Coast only, I had a great many Places worth Viewing to give an Account of; I therefore left Windsor, which was within my View, on one side of the River, and Hampton Court on the other, as being the Subject of another Letter; and resolv'd to finish my present View, in the Order I had begun it; That is to say, to give an Account of the whole Country as I come on; that I may make no incongruous Transi- tions from one remote Part of England to another, at least as few as may be. (1, 144) This impression of taking the reader into his confidence comes to Defoe's aid more than once. As for example, "Before I go forward I should mention Burrow Bridge, which is but three Miles below Rip- pon ... and which I must take in my Way, that I may not be obliged to go farther out of the Way, on the next Journey" (II, 627). Similarly in the Scottish portion: "He that will view the Country of Fife must, as I said before, go round the Coast; and yet there are four or five Places of Note in the Middle of the Country which . .. must not be omitted; I'll take them as I go, though I did not travel to them in a direct Line" (II, 775). Once Defoe achieves an almost Shandean self- consciousness, when he comes to Chatsworth ("perhaps it shall be as many Years describing as it was in building, and the Description be no more finished than the Building" II, 582). Usually. he stops well short of this, seeming content to dovetail the "progress" of his journey and its literary analogue. It would be possible to list a number of refinements on this basic technique. For example, various motifs are combined-in the third paragraph of Letter I, Defoe refers both to "what I think, I may very honestly call a Circuit in the very Letter of it" and to "some Little Excursions, which I made by themselves" (I, 5). Or he dramatises his</page><page sequence="8">160 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES double progression in a sudden vivid phrase: "I am now at the Gates of Edinburgh; but . . . give me leave to take it in Perspective" (II, 707), or "I am now at my Journey's End ... I must now return Sur mes pas" (I, 242).10 But these are sophisticated applications of a method that is in essence notably simple in proportion to its rhetoric- al utility. Without disturbing the primacy of this particular constructional aid, Defoe introduced a number of other devices as the work pro- gressed, again with the idea of promoting drive and impetus. In the second and third volumes especially, he made regular mention of the small "compass" of his book as contrasted with the bulk of the ma- terial he had to cover. This served a number of rhetorical ends. It constituted a kind of apologia in the face of any observable defects or gaps in coverage. It stressed the plenitude of England, the sheer weight of phenomena to be encountered throughout the nation. This was a leading purpose of his tour, as I shall try to show in a moment. Third, the recurrent use of this notion-infinite riches in a little room -serves to reaffirm Defoe's ambition to create a literary vehicle ap- propriate to the material described. In this case, of course, Defoe is saying it can't be done. The confines of the book are too narrow to allow him to render the whole teeming multiplicity of British life. But in deploring the particular failure, Defoe is restating the general, or ideal, aim of his work. The literary survey will be as faithful a copy as can be achieved of the face of England: its failings result (the im- plication goes) from a lack of space and from that alone.'" Some examples will make the point clearer. The word "compass" occurs some fifteen times; scarcely any of these appear in the first third of the book. Not surprisingly, Defoe's sense of being hemmed in grows steadily more apparent as the book proceeds. The first sig- nificant use comes at the start of the fifth letter, when the author comes to speak of London: This great Work is infinitely difficult in its Particulars, though not in itself; not that the City is so difficult to be described, but to do it in the narrow Compass of a Letter, which we see so fully takes up Two large Volumes in 10 Cf. II, 468, "As I am now at Chester, 'tis proper to say something . . ." 11 Compare the very first words of the book: "If this Work is not both Pleasant and Profitable to the Reader, the Author most freely and openly declares the Fault must be in his Performance, and it cannot be any Deficiency in the Subject" (I, 1).</page><page sequence="9">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 161 Folio, and which, yet, if I may venture to give an Opinion of it, is done but by Halves neither. (I, 316) Again we have the transference from narrational issues ("narrow Compass of a Letter") to those of topography. For, within a few lines, Defoe is writing that "London might, indeed, be viewed in a small Compass" and then of the Roman walls ("Fifty Miles in Compass"). Sometimes he uses the word as a simple spatial term-"That Part of the River of Thames which is properly the Harbour ... begins at the turning of the River out of Lime-House Reach, and extends to the Custom-house-Keys: In this Compass I have had the Curiosity to count the Ships" (I, 350). More commonly, Defoe aligns the word with a term such as "description," referring to his own constructional procedures. For example, speaking of the Pool of London, "In what Manner can any Writer go about it, to bring it into any reasonable Compass? The Thing is a kind of Infinite, and the Parts to be separ- ated from one another in such a Description, are so many, that it is hard to know where to begin" (I, 349). However, it is only in the second half of the book that this em- phasis becomes really insistent. Defoe became so conscious of the idea that he extended it to time when writing the preface to his final volume: If all these Additions are to be found in the small Interval between the pub- lishing the second Volume and this of the third, and that in so narrow a Com- pass, what may not every subsequent Year produce? and what Encourage- ment is here for new and more accurate Surveys of the Country? which, whoever travels over it, will always furnish new Materials, and a Variety both profitable and delightful. (II, 536) On another occasion, Defoe turns a deft compliment on Burley in the Hill (rather nobly, as it was the house of his antagonist, the Earl of Nottingham) by utilising this ploy (II, 503). A similar passage occurs in the description of Alloway House, near Stirling (II, 800). That last reference serves as a reminder that the Scottish sections are particularly rich under the aspect I have been considering. This may arise partly from Defoe's awareness that he was skimming over very large tracts of ground in a short space. Even though contempor- aries were ignorant of the Highlands, and even though there was rel-</page><page sequence="10">162 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES atively little to detain the curious traveller (Wade's roads were only half-built anyway), there is a definite sense in the last part of the Tour that Defoe is anxious to get things completed. He may even have been under some pressure from the bookseller Strahan to cut down on space. Witness a remark in the introduction to the Scottish section: Scotland is here describ'd with Brevity, but with Justice; and the present State of Things there, plac'd in as clear a Light as the Sheets, I am confin'd to, will admit; if this pleases, more particulars may be adventured on hereafter ... (II, 690) A number of other hints can be found to support this line of argu- ment, as for example the following: From hence there is nothing remarkable till we come to Aberdeen, a Place so eminent, that it commands some Stay upon it; yet I shall contract its Descrip- tion as much as possible, the Compass of my Work being so great, and the Room I have for it so small. (II, 808) It seems to follow that Defoe's consciousness of restriction was great- est for opposite reasons, in the dense metropolitan area and in the scattered lightly populated outback regions. Judging purely by acre- age, Defoe is about two hundred times more generous in space al- lotted to London and Westminster than to Scotland. But of course this reflects not just his own intent, but also the demographic facts of the time (London accounting for something like an eighth of the British population, higher than a century later)'2 and the taste of the age, when readers were no more interested in hearing about the na- tural splendours of the Highlands than Defoe was in gratifying such an interest. It is possible that Defoe did feel himself genuinely cramped to- wards the end, but it is certain that he was capable of making abun- 12 Depending on how one establishes the bounds of London, and whose figures one trusts, one can arrive at different population figures from three-quarters of a million upwards. In 1725 the total for greater London-i.e., the City and West- minster with the outparishes, plus Southwark-may have been approaching the million mark. Defoe's estimate (1, 324) is "at least, Fifteen Hundred Thousand." This is certainly too high; but it is worth remembering that Defoe would organise his Tour according to this belief. See E. A. Wrigley, "A Simple Model of London's Importance in Changing English Society and Economy 1650-1750," Past and Pres- ent, 37 (1967), 44-45, and H. J. Habbakuk, "English Population in the Eighteenth Century," Economic HistorV Review, 6 (1953), 117-33.</page><page sequence="11">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 163 dant rhetorical capital from the feeling.'3 Nor does this sense of com- pression impair the structural identity of the book-its cleanliness of outline and purposeful trajectory. Macky, as remarked, makes a series of ill-charted trips in any direction that takes his fancy. He supplies no route: one moment he is in Ipswich, the next in Bury St. Edmunds, and in principle there is no reason why his magic carpet should not loft him a moment later to Glasgow. Defoe, on the other hand, plans his itinerary so as to bring in the maximum amount of information as he goes-he likes the phrase en passant, (e.g., I, 350) -and so as to give the reader a definite impression of covering all the ground. Where Macky floats high over the landscape, Defoe hedgehops. Finally, Defoe's tour is much more intelligently conceived than Macky's journey. Initially Defoe keeps to the idea of a "circuit," with London as the start-and-finish line. Letters I and II are complete in themselves. Letter V is a perambulation of the capital. Other trips occupy two letters: thus, III and IV describe a "progress" to Land's End, out and return-similarly VI and VII, with Anglesey the hinge of the journey. When Defoe reached his final volume, he obviously could not retain this scheme-a tour of Northern Scotland could hardly have its base camp in London (a good fortnight's travelling distant even as late as Culloden). What he did was to effect something of a compromise, but a sensible compromise. Letters VIII-IX-X all describe a route taken northwards from the Midlands, starting from the farthest point reached in earlier journeys-either the Trent or the Mersey. Scotland is simply parcelled up into three convenient units: XI, the border to the Forth, including Edinburgh; XII, the border to the Clyde, with Glasgow; and XIII, the circuit of the rest of Scotland, going counter clockwise on the map. As a result of these shifts in the third volume, the Tour loses a little in the way of symmetry of design. Yet it retains a shapeliness in its organisation that is far beyond Celia Fiennes, Stukeley, or Cobbett-not to mention John Macky. The 13 Other rhetorical formulae encountered are suggested by these quotations: "Harwich is a Town so well known, and so perfectly describ'd by many Writers, I need say little of it" (I, 34); "I could say much more to this Point, if it were needful, and in few Words could easily prove . . ." (I, 44); "I can't omit, however little it may seem . . ." (I, 59); "To all this I must add, without Compliment to the Town, or to the People, that the Merchants . . .of Yarmouth have a very good Reputation in Trade" (I, 68); "At the entrance of a little nameless River, scarce indeed worth a Name, stands Whitby" (II, 656).</page><page sequence="12">164 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES following spatial diagram, crude as it must be, gives some approx- imation of the structural layout, viewed chiefly from a London base. out I return out II return out III IV return London V Westminster out VI VII return Trent - VIII Tees Trent - IX Border Mersey - X Border Border - XI Forth/Clyde valley (E) Border XII Forth/Clyde valley (W) (E) Forth/Clyde valley XIII Forth/Clyde valley (W) This complex interlocking pattern is beautifully adapted to Defoe's aim of comprehensive, yet intelligible, coverage. He has ordered his material so that the formal contours of the book mirror geographic, social, and economic reality. Literary expression and human ecology are wedded in the Tour's grand design. The second principal resource found in the Tour is broadly stylis- tic in character. Before it is allotted more detailed consideration, a few words on the style of the Tour as a whole will afford a useful background. Defoe makes sparing use of the "points" favoured by the more orotund eighteenth-century writers.'4 Antithesis, for example, that 14 Despite this, the Tour is of course written chastely and well for the most part. One of the oddest lapses comes early on, with a horrible burst of alliteration, mainly on sibilants, which Defoe can scarcely have read aloud to himself: 'Tis on this Shoar, and near this Creek, that the greatest Quantity of fresh Fish is caught, which supplies not this Country only, but London Markets also: On the Shoar beginning a little below Candy Island, or rather below Leigh Road, there lies a great Shoal or Sand called the Black Tayl, which runs out near three Leagues into the Sea due East; at the End of it, stands a Pole or Mast, set up by the Trinity-House Men of London, whose Business is, to lay Buoys, and set up Sea Marks for the Direction of the Sailors; this is called Shoo-Bacon, from the Point of Land where this</page><page sequence="13">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 165 invariable standby of the less accomplished Augustan compiler, oc- curs rarely. The cases that are found are brief and effective, with no lingering or cleverness for its own sake: "I that had read Cotton's Wonders of the Peak, in which I always wondered more at the Poetry than at the Peak; and in which there was much good Humour, tho' but little good Verse" (II, 564). A page or two later, at the Giant's Tomb, "Here we miss'd the imaginary Wonder, and found a real one" (II, 568). In the introduction to the Scottish sections, we read, "As I shall not make a Paradise of Scotland, so I assure you I shall not make a Wilderness of it" (II, 691). Leaving aside oxymoron, to which I shall return later, there is only scattered and halfhearted use of parallelism; the best example occur- ring in the last journey: The Truth is, Cardinal Beaton was another Sharp, and A[rch]. B[ishop]. Sharp was a second Beaton, Alike Persecutors for Religion, Alike merciless in their Prosperity, and Alike miserable in their Fall, for they were both murther'd, or kill'd by Assassination. (II, 795) More prominent is the use of epigram, although even here Defoe sel- dom places special emphasis on his own bons mots. His curt assess- ment of Bath theatricals provides a representative case: "In the Afternoon there is generally a Play, tho' the Decorations are mean, and the Performances accordingly; but it answers, for the Company here (not the Actors) make the Play, to say no more" (II, 433). In a rather similar spirit: "But Company and Diversion is in short the main business of the Place; and those People who have nothing to do, seem to be the only People who have any thing to do at Tunbridge" (I, 126). Of course, the very rarity of such a roundly phrased apo- thegm lends added force when it does appear. Defoe from time to time gets ironic point from a well-placed parenthesis: "It was a thick Mist, as is often upon those Hills, (indeed seldom otherwise) ... ." (II, 732). But this too is fairly uncommon. Sand begins, which is call'd Shooberry-Ness, and that from the Town of Shooberry, which stands by it. From this Sand, and on the Edge of Shooberry, before it or South- West of it, all along, to the Mouth of Colchester Water, the Shoar is full of Shoals and Sands, with some deep Channels between; all which are so full of Fish, that not only the Barking fishing-Smacks come hither to Fish, but the whole Shoar is full of small fisher-Boats in very great Numbers, belonging to the Villages and Towns on the Coast, who come in every Tide with what they take; and selling the smaller Fish in the Country, send the best and largest away upon Horses, which go Night and Day to London Market. (I, 11)</page><page sequence="14">166 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES Defoe habitually abjures finicky refinements of style, seeking a plain and direct way of writing.15 His use of figurative language is in consonance with that aim. The Tour makes remarkably effective use of dead metaphor-stock images which pass almost unnoticed in reading but focus meaning sharply and neatly. Thus, Tilbury Fort "may justly be looked upon, as the Key of the River of Thames, and consequently the Key of the City of London" (I, 9)-the following paragraph amplifies this description, but without referring back to the particular figure of speech used at the outset. Again, Defoe speaks of the King's army marching over Scotland, "not as a Foreigner and Conqueror, but as a Sovereign, a lawful Governor and Father of the Country, to deliver from, not entangle her in the Chains of Tyranny and Usurpation" (II, 805). He is not inclined to argue with the Jacob- ites; rather he lets the imagery carry its own disvaluing charge. The text is scattered through with such conventional lecutions, adroitly employed to convey the precise weight and drift of emotion which Defoe wants.'6 We read of fear giving wings to news, of compliments with a sting in the tail, of throwing a veil over disagreeable facts, of fatal turns, of ladies shipwrecking their characters, of the Phoenix (of London) reviving, of money flowing and people settling like bees around a hive. The drugget trade makes an invasion on the broad- cloth industry; facts are mastered, tempers bridled, darkness prevails in the remote Highlands, and the "hot" rebels are always likely to spring. One chieftain was drawn into the snare of the late insurrec- tion; others lacked stomach for the fight. In such ways Defoe quietly directs his readers' response to the facts he is presenting. One highly personal aspect of the style is a tendency towards self- conscious mannerisms when a bold figure of speech is introduced. A point of land at Harwich "as it were, laps over the Mouth of [the] Haven" (I, 34); the Isle of Ely "look'd as if wrapp'd up in Blankets" (I, 80); whilst the wool trade in Wiltshire "was first seated in this County, or, as we may say, planted itself here first, because of the infinite Numbers of Sheep" (I, 282). Sometimes we get a formula such as "This, to use a Scripture Elegance, is that City of Oxford" (I, 15 "True Protestant Plainness" is Defoe's own phrase for the London churches (I, 334). 16 Apart from the instances quoted in the text, typical cases are the use of "Bowels" (of the earth), I, 265. II, 802, 827; the word "bubble" for cheat or defraud (II, 786) -a fairly commonplace expression at that time; and "province" in such phrases as "it is not my province" (I, 382, II, 617, 665).</page><page sequence="15">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 167 396). In the region of Newcastle there are "prodigious Heaps, I might say Mountains, of Coals" (II, 659). The caution with which the trope is brought into the account gives it an air of prudence and reliability -the reverse of that "fabulous" quality Defoe so much distrusts.'7 Orthodox simile is used in a similarly canny fashion. Commonest is the "as if" formula: Orford was once a good town, but "the Sea daily throws up more Land to it, and falls off itself from it, as if it was resolved to disown the Place, and that it should be a Sea Port no longer" (I, 54). At Epsom the horses race, "flying over the Course, as if they either touch'd not, or felt the Ground they run upon" (I, 159). In Strathnairn, Defoe finds the lake contracted to the size of an or- dinary river, "as if design'd by Nature to give Passage to the Inhab- itants to converse with the Northern Part; and then, as if that Part had been sufficiently perform'd, it open'd again to its former Breadth" (II, 817). For the rest, a favourite simile is that which compares a dockyard or industrial complex to a town or "well ordered City."'8 More ambitious is the picture of the remains and "Trophies" of Brit- ish antiquity, which "are but, as we may say, like Wounds hastily healed up, the Calous spread over them being remov'd, they appear presently" (II, 663). The rumour of wild pillaging by the Irish dra- goons in 1688 "spread like the Undulations of the Water in a Pond, when a flat Stone is cast upon the Surface" (I, 299). On Cannons, when Defoe may not have expected to be believed-or may not have cared if he was-he lets himself go: "The whole is a Beauty, and as the Firmament is a Glorious Mantle filled with, or as it were made up of a Concurrence of lesser Glories the Stars; so every part of this Building adds to the Beauty of the whole" (I, 386). But such elegantly contrived nonsense is unusual in the Tour. The metaphoric life of the book might surprise those who have combed the novels in vain for a sustained play of imagery.19 The con- 17 Two examples among many of this sceptical attitude are found at I, 185, 188. 18 See I, 108, 138 (Portsmouth docks as "a kind of Marine Corporation"), 193 (Wilton House as "a well govern'd City," and the Earl of Pembroke as "a true Patri- archal Monarch, reign[ing] here with an Authority agreeable to all his Subjects (Family)"-the explanatory parenthesis is characteristic of Defoe's suspicious handl- ing of metaphor.) 19 Closer to the cadence and accents of Defoe's fiction is this, from the start of Letter IV: "There was another Difficulty also, upon which my Navigator, or Com- mander, as I called him, who was an old experienced Seaman, dissuaded me from the Undertaking; and that was, the Necessity of getting Pilots to every Part of the Coast, and to every Port, River, and Creek, and the Danger of not getting them: The Neces-</page><page sequence="16">168 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES crete force Defoe regularly attains can be gauged from a sample list of passages-Camden and Bishop Gibson have "ransacked" the country for antiquities, yet Defoe can still glean "large Handfuls" they have missed. Colchester still mourns in the ruins of the civil war; the inhabitants of Harwich seem warm in their nests; Lord Castle- main was wounded by an arrow shot in the dark, i.e., the South Sea bubble. A cloud of canvas appears in the south coast harbours; mer- chants come to Epsom to unbend the bow of the mind; in the Welsh mountains Defoe converses with the upper regions; whilst at Chats- worth the mountains insult the clouds, intercept the sun and threaten the town. Money is melted into ale; trade is in a kind of hurry; and towns outswell their bounds.20 Two particular kinds of image stand out. The first might be de- scribed as anthropomorphic metaphor. Most common here is the use of the word face to mean aspect, appearance, show-"the face of wealth" and like expressions. This occurs over twenty times in the book, but a single instance may stand for all. The church at Sherburn "is still a Reverend Pile, and shews the Face of great Antiquity" (I, 218). (Actually Defoe uses this word so freely he may have thought of it as a dead metaphor, as discussed above.) Closely analogous to this metaphor is the use of dress, often envisaged as bedizening an antique belle-Hampton Court "put on new Cloaths, and being dress'd gay and glorious, made the Figure we now see it in" (I, 179). Exeter Cathedral is "an antient Beauty" (I, 223); Defoe intends to refrain from "loading [the] Work with Fragments of Antiquity, and dressing up the Wilds of the Borders as a Paradise, which are indeed but a Wilderness" (I, 253). Another striking image of this sort is the description of Leeds as "what I may call the eldest Son of the Cloath- ing Trade in this County" (II, 606). This technique can easily be dis- sity was plain; For that, as I proposed to keep all the Way near, or under the Shore, to enter into all the Bays, and Mouths of Rivers, and Creeks, as above; 1. It would be impracticable to find any single Man that knew so perfectly the whole Coast, as to venture without Pilots. 2. Pilots would not always be found, especially on the North and West Coasts of Scotland; so I laid it aside, I say, as a hopeless, and too dangerous Adventure, and satisfied myself, to make the Circuit very near as perfect by Land, which I have done with much more Pains and Expence; the Fruit of which, you have, in Part communicated in these Letters" (I, 254). Not just the content and vocabulary, but the general mode of utterance, with its painstaking effort to weigh competing alternatives, strongly recalls Captain Singleton. See for instance pp. 113-14 in the Everyman edition, ed. J. Sutherland (London, 1963). 20J, 2, 7, 16, 36, 90, 123, 160; II, 458, 572, 583, 797.</page><page sequence="17">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 169 tinguished from that of ordinary personification. That figure occurs very rarely and then inconspicuously-at Market Harborough cur- iosity turns Defoe west, in Fifeshire Posterity will enjoy the sweets of the new interest in planting conifers. A second group of images is made up of those connected with trade or commerce. In the light of Defoe's background, this is not very surprising, but it does seem more marked than in the fiction he was writing at this period. Phrases like the gross of the people, the properties (i.e., qualities or attributes) of the gossiping part of the na- tion, speaking in bulk, casting up, and comnputing, abound through- out the work. Defoe's word for deceptions practised by an author is a fraud; he claims the balance (of accuracy) in his own favour; he says that a story is too old to have any vouchers, and that antiquity claims the fee simple. Sand beggars the soil, and (one of many legal turns of speech) facts come within the verge of the writer's knowledge. Epsom in the afternoon is like a trading town on holiday (though of course, as Defoe makes clear, it is anything but a hive of business activity); and Yorkshire grooms handle a curry-comb as deftly as a young scrivener does pen and ink. Particularly common is the use of store or fund in a figurative application; stock and magazine are also found, along with treasure, as noun and verb.2' The word business itself is frequent, generally in the context, " 'tis not the Business of this Work to enquire" (I, 158), along with similar locutions. Everything up to this point would prompt the conclusion that De- foe uses language in a conservative and undemonstrative way-uses it well and pithily, no doubt, but without any obvious "creative" in- gredient in his idiom. There is, however, one rhetorical device which is ubiquitous in the Tour, and which goes a long way to give the book its character and its imaginative colouring. This is hyperbole. It is ironic that the Tour has been left aside as prosaic and literal, compared with Defoe's fictional output. The truth is that, if anything, it is Defoe the novelist who sticks within the possible, and rates verisi- militude above what might be summed up by "the marvellous." The Tour is a sustained exercise in the marvellous. Sceptical as Defoe may be with regard to folk tales, he is warmly hospitable to "wonders" of 21 Defoe also speaks of "pay[ing] the Debt of a just and native Writer" (I, 2), and "pleading" antiquity (II, 548). Vast stock occurs several times; inexhaustible store(- house) at least six times, quite apart from treasure not to be exhausted and the like. There could hardly be a more quintessential Augustan image.</page><page sequence="18">170 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES another kind. He is fascinated by extremes of scale, of volume, of age, of frequency, of wealth, of abundance, in short any distributable or variable feature of life. His rhetorical forms are driven constantly to- wards exaggeration.22 Not, that is, the exaggeration of "stretching" (as schoolroom slang puts it), where all figures are doubled and all exceptions quietly forgotten. Rather, Defoe exaggerates by seeking out and citing the extreme case. He does not necessarily falsify mat- ters: he simply fixes his attention on the most striking data he can find. His Tour of Britain incorporates the function of a publication such as the Guiinness Book of Records; he collects all-time highs like an avid cricket or baseball statistician. Arguably this is the common coin of journalism, but few pass the currency with such spendthrift profusion. There are three ways in which this concern affects the words on the page: three varieties of hyperbole which sustain this rhetoric. (A) The first is the direct superlative. Almost every paragraph in the three volumes contains a real or implicit superlative; I will take a single example, chosen pretty well at random (other passages would certainly show a higher density of cases): The best Ornament of the City [Chester] is, that the Streets are very broad and fair, and run through the whole City in strait Lines, crossing in the Middle of the City, as at Chichester: The Walls, as I have said, are in very good repair, and it is a very pleasant Walk around the City, upon the Walls, and within the Battlements, from whence you may see the Country round; and particularly on the side of the Roodee, which I mentioned before, which is a fine large low Green, on the Bank of the Dee. In the Winter this Green is often under Water by the Inundations of the River, and a little before I came there, they had such a terrible Land Flood, which flow'd 8 Foot higher than usual so that it not only overflowed the said Green, call'd the Roodee, but destroy'd a fine new Wharf and Landing-Place for Goods, a little below the Town, bore down all the Warehouses, and other Buildings, which the Merchants had erected for securing their Goods, and carried all away Goods and Buildings together, to the irreparable Loss of the Persons concern'd: Also beyond the Roodee, one sees from the Walls of Chester the County of Flint, and the Mountains of Wales, a Prospect best indeed, at a Distance. (I1, 469) 22 Hyperbole of an orthodox cast-"almost every Gentleman's House is a Castle" (II, 682)-is quite common also. Cf. I, 384 (Hampstead Heath is "so near Heaven" that only a race of "Mountaineers" could live there!), as well as I, 391; II, 807. Cf. T. S. Ashton. An Econoinic History of England: The Eighlteenthl Century (London, 1955), p. 33: "Defoe had an eye for whatever was striking or unusual, and some- times, he ran to hyperbole . . ."</page><page sequence="19">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 171 In this paragraph of 219 words, Defoe employs (i) grammatical su- perlatives, as the best Ornament, a Prospect best indeed; (ii) gram- matical comparatives, as 8 Foot higher than usual; (iii) what might be termed implicit superlatives, as very broad and fair, very good Re- pair, very pleasant Walk; (iv) words connoting totality or absolute state, as the whole City, the Country round, all the Warehouses, car- ried all away; (v) terms of "ultimate" state-this constitutes hyper- bole (B), and is exemplified by irreparable; (vi) words whose semantic basis includes a superlative or comparative notion, as fine large low Green, often under Water, such a terrible Land Flood; and (vii) other phrases with an additive effect, as not only ... but ... also. Some of these categories call for no special comment. As regards the method of the entire book, it should be noted that a common lo- cution, the most , may qualify for either (i) or (iii).23 The most important class, however, in its bearings on the Tour at large, is item (vi). This is like (ii), except that there is no modifier such as most, very, exceeding(ly). All the superlative force comes from within the lexical unit itself. Good examples are prodigious, which occurs over seventy times in text along with prodigy, a rarer variant. The word commonly comes up in juxtaposition to nouns such as sum, number, trade, increase, expence, quantity. Each of these is a significant term in the idiom of the Tour, and several will be mentioned again. An- other instance is the word immense, with its adverbial form. This comes about twenty times, generally with application to a noun like estate, wealth, sum, or the adjective rich. A third case is furnished by infinite(ly). Here there are forty occurrences, often in relation to pop- ulous, full, number. Finally there is exceeding(ly)/excess(ive); I have noted thirty usages, with populous, rich, fine common adjuncts. A number of other expressions turn up with slightly less regularity, but they serve a similar purpose. Amongst these are eminent(ly), extra- ordinary (with more than ordinary, etc.), monstrous(ly) and extreme with its derivatives, all of which appear eight or more times. "Mon- sters for Magnitude" (I, 347) is a noun-based variant. For the rest, the true superlatives include two curious forms, beau- tifullest (twice) and frightfullest. In category (iii) certain adverbial phrases are of common resort, e.g., without exception, beyond (with- 23 Utmost appears in one way or another on at least ten occasions, generally in combination with a word like extent. A strange phrase employed is "so every where" (I, 162).</page><page sequence="20">172 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES out) comparison, to the last extremity, heightened to such a degree.24 A pretty many is one unusual expression. (B) The second mode of hyperbole I refer to as terms of ultimate state. The simplest form this takes is the verbal shape IN(UN) IBLE(ABLE). Frequent examples are incredible, innumerable, im- possible, inexhaustible, invaluable. Others I have noted more sporad- ically are insupportable, indelible, unaccountable, irresistible, unpas- sable, indefatigable, intollerable, inexpressible, inestimable, invul- nerable, inaccessible, inmpregnable, indissolvable (of the Union with Scotland), irreparable. There are closely allied forms like unprece- dented. However, Defoe can achieve the same effect with a phrase, e.g. all the magnificence ... imaginable, in the fewest words imagin- able (a pure superlative, looked at in another way), never to be exhausted, not to be matched, hardly to be valued, not to be de- scribed. This last belongs to a group of negative formulae which Defoe uses freely: so beautiful no pen can describe is another variant. There is a strange concentration of these negatives in Letter V. Per- haps London seemed so vast and marvellouis to Defoe that ordinary superlatives were inadequate. At all events, four pages concerned with the City of London (I, 340-44) supply more than half the book's quota of these phrases; the basic pattern is along the lines "No Ac- counts in the World are more exactly kept, no Place in the World has so much Business done, with so much Ease ... nobody is either de- nied or delayed Payment ... nothing can be shewn like it in the whole World ... no Sum is so great, but the Bank has been able to raise ... nior can a Breach be now made on any Terms ... nothing can be more exact ... we see nothing of this at Paris, at Amsterdam, at Hamburgh . . and so on. All these are ways of connoting the unparalleled wealth/power/importance of Britain, a leading strategy of the l'our.25 (C) A third form of hyperbole resides in the stress laid on sheer 24 Variants are to an extreme, to perfection. Another mode of emphatic superla- tive is attained simply by accumulation: "the first, and best, if not the only Haven" (1, 256). 25 Cf. also II, 427: "Nor can any Nation in Europe show the like Munificence to any General, no nor the greatest in the World; and not to go back to antient times, not the French Nation to the great Luxemberg, or the yet great Turenne: Nor the Emperor to the great Eugenze, or to the yet greater Duke of Lorrain . . . I say none of these ever receiv'd so glorious a Mark of their Country's Favour," as did Marl- borough in the shape of Blenheim.</page><page sequence="21">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 173 multiplicity. There is a whole repertory of words to suggest repletion. They include numerous, innumerable and not to be numbered, mul- tiplied, crowd, throng, as well as an odd little group of words con- course, conflux, confluence, flux, used of people-generally the gen- try or polite society. More important under this aspect are epithets such as considerable26 and populous, on which I shall speak further, and the verb increase, also reserved for the last section of this paper. However, the main work is done by quantity, which astonishingly enters the text no less than two hundred times. (In passing, quality appears fewer than half a dozen times.) The phrase vast quantity ac- counts for twenty-four of these; prodigious quantity for twenty; and great quantity for eighty-four. The sheer iterative power of the word, liammering away through the entire book, contributes a great deal to the sense of abundance which Defoe is seeking. More than that, its overall density is backed by a few areas of high concentration, where the term is sown through the prose with almost reckless abandon. Usually these areas of the text are concerned with trade under one aspect or another. Thus, the famous description of Stourbridge Fair has fourteen instances of quantity in little more than two pages (I, 82-4). An even higher density occurs in the description of Clack- mannan: the county produces not merely "the best" coal in Scotland, but also-a far heavier stress-the "greatest Quantity" (II, 801). Other passages showing heavy concentration include that on the Wiltshire woollen trade (I, 283-5: thirteen instances); that on the fisheries off the west coast of Scotland (II, 829: six occurrences with- in three short paragraphs); and that on the Milton/Maidstone dis- trict of Kent (I, 1 3-4: eight uses of quantity). In all these sections of the book, other words discussed here are prominent-e.g., prodi- gious, numbers, inexhaustible, populous, and so on. Just now I myself had recourse to the word "abundance." Abun- dant and abundance figure largely in Defoe's own writing: there are almost eighty examples. This is to a great extent explained by his fondness for the construction abundance of, meaning "many." The phrase has no article and takes a plural verb as a rule, seemingly by attraction from the noun governed-as, "there are abundance of poor." Defoe places little emphasis on the word, but it does provide 26 This word appears over seventy times. Defoe possibly thought it was not an impressive term without a modifier; very considerable is the commonest usage.</page><page sequence="22">174 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES further support for the rhetoric of quantity which underlies so much of the Tour.27 It might be thought that this unremitting stress on amplitude makes for a lack of artistic interest, as well as a sameness of texture in the prose of the book. An adverse critic might see the prominence of "quantity" as against the latency of "quality" in terms of Defoe's Puritan, middle-class ethos. This tropism towards numbers, sub- sta-nces, Dinglichkeit, rather than qualitative judgments, is certainly characteristic of Defoe at large. But while it may be wrong to see the Tour as a huge collection of Biedermeier furniture, lovingly put to- gether out of a sort of acquisitive patriotism, beyond question Defoe's style relies heavily on this hyperbole of scale. There is left what I take to constitute the main rhetorical ploy. The device involved is the repeated use of contrast, sometimes couched in terms of paradox. Basically what Defoe does here is to set off an idiom of growth-"rising" towns or "flourishing" country-against counter-images of exhaustion-"barren" land or "broken" remains. Of course this is not the picture given us by most commentators on the Tour, who see it as a celebration of the new England. G. D. H. Cole, for example, writes with enviable confidence, "Defoe's Tour is to be read, then, to-day above all for the light which it throws on the economic and social condition of England half a century or so before the coming of the Industrial Revolution." 28 Cole believed that Defoe was at his best in describing "what seemed to him really living and important," i.e., "the great social transition he saw proceeding around him."29 More explicit still is this passage: The things he looked for on his journeys were by no means those which ap- pealed to the ordinary tourist of his day or our own. For "antiquities" he had something of scorn; he liked towns which excelled not in the "tumbledown picturesque", but in good, clean, well-built modem houses; he liked a coun- tryside full of corn and cattle, rather than views and romantic wildness; aid, 27 Abound is employed in a few places, normally in proximity to "growth" clus- ters involving flourishing and the like. 28 T/B, I, vii. For a similar judgment, compare T/C, 1, ix: "It is, then, primarily as a guide to social economic conditions that De Foe's Tour is important." 29 T/B, I, vi-vii.</page><page sequence="23">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 175 above all, his interest was always in the present rather than the past. Not that he was unable to appreciate a fine old building or a "view" which conformed to his sense of beauty. But thew were not the things he was in search of, and he gave them but a passing mention. What really interested him was the state of the country in a social and economic sense. (I, v) Now this is a splendid account of the "official" meaning of the book.30 The deeper implications of the Tour run in a different course, how- ever. Defoe, true, has a marvellously acute sense of process; And this comes out not only in his joyous welcome to the new commercial ven- tures of his day. He does write of the emerging order in graphic and warmly appreciative language. But he repeatedly sets against his picture of health and plenty an idiom of devastation. His Tour is per- vaded by a sense of the fragility of human contrivances, very close to Pope's in that most central Augustan document, the Epistle to Bur- lington. Take the account of Dunwich in Suffolk: This Town is a Testimony of the decay of Publick Things, Things of the most durable Nature.... The Ruins cif Carthage, of the great City of Jerusa- lem, or of antient Rome, are not at all Wonderful to me; the Ruins of Nine- vah, which are so entirely sunk, as that 'tis doubtful where the City stood; The Ruins of Babylon, or the Great Persepolis, and many Capital Cities, which Time and the Change of Monarchies have Overthrown; these, I say, are not at all Wonderful, because being the Capitals of great and flourishing Kingdoms, where those Kingdoms were Overthrown, the Capital Cities nec- essarily fell with them; But for a private Town, a Sea-Port, and a Town of Commerce, to Decay, as it were of itself (for we never read of Dunwich being plundered, or Ruin'd, by any Disaster, at least not of late Years); this I must confess, seems owing to nothing but the Fate of Things, by which we see that Towns, Kings, Countries, Families, and Persons, have all their Elevation, their Medium, their Declination, and even their Destruction in the Womb of Time, and the Course of Nature. It is true, this town is manifestly decayed by the invasion of the Waters, and as other Towns seem sufferers by the Sea, or the Tide withdrawing from their Ports, such as Orford, just now named; Winchelsea in Kent, and the like; so this Town is, as it were, eaten up by the Sea, as above; and the still encroaching Ocean seems to threaten it with a fatal Immersion in a few Years more. (1, 54) This is not an isolated purple passage. Throughout the book we get the same sensitivity to the depredations of time, in the manner almost 30 I use the epithet in the sense developed by Thomas R. Edwards, This Dark Estate (Berkeley, 1963), p. 6 and passim.</page><page sequence="24">176 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES of an Elizabethan sonneteer. It is this which gives tension and energy to what might otherwise be a perfunctory survey of "the improving temper of the present age."'31 If one looks closely at the passage quoted, it is evident that the leading terms-the words and images which carry the principal emotional charge-have very little to do with anything Cole de- scribed. These include decay, Ruins (three times), Time and Change, Overthrown (twice), fell, Decay again, Plundered or Ruin'd (note the capitals, very rare here for verbs), Disaster, Fate, Declination, De- struction, Womb of Time and Course of Nature, decayed yet again, invasion, sufferers, eaten up, encroaching, threaten, fatal Immersion. This is the vocabulary of elegy, or of a medieval ubi sunt lament (the idea of the wheel of fortune is very close), and not the language of confident social prophecy. Since this conclusion departs so widely from the accepted view of the literary substance of the Tour,32 a more detailed and scrupulous analysis of this idiom is plainly required. I shall take, first, the lan- guage of growth; second, that of decay; and third, the passages of juxtaposed imagery which, I shall argue, lend to the Tour its most distinctive artistic effects. The vocabulary of growth, then, corresponds to that celebratory element in the "official" Tour, located by Cole and others. It makes heavy use of words such as plenty (often with vast), health(y), bounty, growing, prolifick, rise/rising, improve(ment), luxuriant, nourish, thriving and so on. An important class of words is that of flourish- (ing), fertile, fruitful. The first of these occurs some thirty times: in about ten of those cases flourish comes in immediate proximity to another key term, increase. As for fertile, it is found fifteen times, 31 (I, 44). Surprisingly, improve(ment) itself is not especially widespread in the text. 32 Cole enunciates the traditional view well enough: "Here then I leave the Tour, making for it no extravagant claim as a work of exceptional genius, but rather sug- gesting that its very plainness and the humble purpose it was designed to serve give it a special value as a work of historical record. It is well written, in clear quickly- moving sentences that make it easy and pleasant reading. That is all De Foe tried to make it" (T/C, I, xxiv). The same notion of Defoe's plain and artless style appears in Esther Moir's account: "Defoe in contrast [to Celia Fiennes] writes a straight- forward narrative prose, cold, critical and measured, scorning to indulge in the hyperboles with which her work is adorned" (The Discovery of Britain [London, 1964], p. 36). My own analysis prompts an opposite conclusion on all the issues raised here, as regards Defoe; even the word "critical" may need some qualification.</page><page sequence="25">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 177 mostly in the first three-quarters of the book-Scotland, understand- ably enough in Defoe's terms, rarely inspires the word. Fruitful is more common, with forty instances spread quite evenly through the Tour. This compares with the most common term of general appro- bation implying a smiling landscape or a prosperous town-pleasant, which turns up over ninety times. This count is in some ways mis- leading-pleasant sometimes figures in a rather negative context, as where it is used four times in a description of the disadvantages from which the site of Edinburgh appears to suffer.33 The most significant individual word, however, is increase, either as noun or verb. (Defoe more commonly spells it with an initial e, though the variant i creeps in steadily towards the close.) This ap- pears at least 140 times in the text, an extraordinarily high figure compared with its frequency in ordinary discourse.34 In no author- concordance that I have checked with does increase figure among the fifty commonest words listed. Even if one included particles such as and, the, of, Defoe must use increase among his twenty commonest. Moreover, as with quantity, this overall dominance goes with excep- tional density in specific regions of the text. Sometimes Defoe repeats increase with almost reckless unconcern. It occurs five times in ten lines in the description of refugees employed in Canterbury (I, 1 18). Exactly the same ratio appears in the entry for Bristol (II, 435), where prodigious, flourishing, magnitude, swell'd are also in ev- idence. Four instances at a short interval, allied with prodigious, quantity, populous, number, are found here: If they were so populous at that time, how much must they be encreased since? and especially since the late Revolution, the Trade having been prodi- giously encouraged and encreased by the great Demand for their Kersies for clothing the Armies abroad, insomuch that it is the Opinion of some that know the Town and its Bounds very well, that the Number of People in the Vicaridge of Hallifax, is encreased one fourth, at least, within the last forty Years, that is to say, since the late Revolution. Nor is it improbable at all, for besides the Number of Houses which are encreased, they have entered upon a new Manufacture which was never made in those Parts before, at least, not in any Quantities, I mean, the Manufactures of Shalloons . .. (II, 605) 33 (II, 710). Other relevant items of "growth" vocabulary are glut, overgrown, throng, multiply. 34 Increase does figure in A Journal of the Plague Year, but by no means so prom- inently. Spread, on the other hand, appears to be relatively more common in the Journal than in the Tour.</page><page sequence="26">178 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES There is something very revelatory about Defoe's adjustment of sense in "which was never made ... before, at least not in any Quan- tities, I mean." Literal nouns such as trade and manufacture call for little gloss, frequent as they are. The point about increase is that it is used in a whole gradation of meanings, from literal to the quasi- figurative. Sometimes it is both subject and predicate, applied to per- sons and things, indicative and conditional, active and passive all at once: The Manchester Trade we all know; and all that are concerned in it know that it is, as all our other Manufactures are, very much encreased within these thirty or forty Years especially beyond what it was before; and as the Manu- facture is encreased, the People must be encreased of course. It is true, that the encrease of the Manufacture may be by its extending it self farther in the Country, and so morn Hands may be emploved in the County without any encrease in the Town. But I answer, that though this is possible, yet as the Town and Parish of Manchester is the Center of the Manufacture, the en- crease of that Manufacture would certainly encrease there first, and then the People not being there sufficient, it might spread it self further. But the en- crease of Buildings at Manchester within these few Years, is a Confirmation of the encrease of People . .. (II, 670) Some degree of repetition might be put down to journalistic haste or clumsiness. But nine occurrences in so short a space lead one to the conclusion that Defoe is doing something analogous to poetic re- shaping-scrutinising a word as he repeats it, as with "wit" in the Essay on Criticism. There is an even greater huddle in the account of Dumfries (II, 725). Here Defoe argues that the growth of trade and the growth of population are interdependent. His main rhetorical bridging device is the bare word increase. This brings us naturally to another leading idea, generally covered by populous. The word is endemic in nineteenth-century gazetteers of Britain and America, and Defoe makes less personal capital out of it than he does with increase or quantity. None the less, a term which is not exactly ubiquitous in everyday speech crops up a scarcely credible 120 times. One sign that the expression carries a lower res- onance for Defoe, despite its currency. is the fact that it never ap- pears in high concentration-rarely more than twice in a given para- graph. It is habitually found in conjunction with exceeding(ly) or with a number of syntactically parallel adjectives-rich, large, well- built and the like. Populous might have been considered above, along</page><page sequence="27">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 179 with abundance, but it generally occurs in a "growth" context, where- as abundance is a routine trick of speech with Defoe and can turn up anywhere. Directly opposed to this set of terms we find a whole thesaurus of "decay." The more regular expressions include destroy/destruction, often in conjunction with time; loss, perish, exhaust, devastation; as well as decrepid, sterile, desert. In the later sections particularly sink becomes an important antonym of rise.3" Remains is common, whilst ruin and its derivatives can be found forty-odd times. But much the most important single term is decay itself, with just over a hundred instances. Many of these form part of an oxymoron, with growth the contrary idea. But the word claims attention for its own sake. espe- cially in the Scottish portions. This passage on Ayr does employ the growth-decay paradox, but the sheer iteration of this latter com- ponent stands out just as conspicuously. Air ... was formerly a large City, had a good Harbour, and a great Trade: I must acknowledge to you, that tho' I believe it never was a City, yet it had certainly been a good Town, and much bigger than it is now: At present like an old Beauty, it shews the Ruins of a good Face; but is also apparently, not only decay-d and declin'd, but decaying and declining every Day, and from being the fifth Town in Scotland, as the Townsmen say, is now like a Place forsaken; the Reason of its Decay, is, the Decay of its Trade, so true is it, that Commerce is the Life of Nations. of Cities. of Towns, Harbours, and of the whole Prosperity of a Country; What the Reason of the Decay of Trade here was, or when it first began to decay, is hard to determine . . . (11, 739) An equally marked concentration is found in the passage on Dun- fermline, where Defoe spells out the "threefold" decay of the town. The word occurs six times. a'long with demo/isl'd, ruis. fallen (in and down), monuments, sinking. mouilderd awayv, injury of tinie, ir- recoverable. As already indicated. this notion of decay is frequently associated with a sense of the lapse of time. Among the phrases used are "time. the great devourer of the works of men," "'defac'd by time." "Time lhas made it look gross and rough," "the very ruins almost eaten up by aa A representative context for sin,k is this: 'But now things infinitely modern . . . are become Marks of Antiquity; for even the Castle of York- ... is not only become antient and decayed, but even sunk into Time, and almost lost and forgotten: Fires. Sieges, Plunderings and Devastations, have often been the Fate of York, so that one should wonder there should be any thing of a City left" (II, 636).</page><page sequence="28">180 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES time," "defaced with age," "sunk into time," "sunk into their own ruins, by the mere length of time," "to crumble, and suffer by time," and "the meer injury of time." At the end of Letter IX, Defoe allows himself a more sustained meditation on the ruins of time, in a vein quite different from anything Cole's description would suggest: I cannot but say, that since I entred upon the View of these Northern Coun- ties, I have many times repented that I so early resolved to decline the de- lightful View of Antiquity, here being so great and so surprising a Variety, and every Day more and more discovered; and abundance since the Tour which the learned Mr. Cambden made this Way, nay, since his Learned Continuator; for as the Trophies, the Buildings, the religious, as well as mili- tary Remains, as well of the Britains, as of the Romans, Saxons, and Nor- mans, are but, as we may say, like Wounds hastily healed up, the Calous spread over them being removed, they appear presently; and though the Earth, which naturally eats into the strongest Stones, Metals, or whatever Substance, simple or conmpound, is or can be by Art or Nature prepared to endure it, has defaced the Surface, the Figures and Inscriptions upon most of these things, yet they are beautiful, even in their decay, and the venerable Face of Antiquity has something so pleasing, so surprizing, so satisfactory in it, especially to those who have with any Attention read the Histories of pass'd Ages, that I know nothing renders Travelling more pleasant and more agreeable. (II, 663) A short portion from this piece of prose was quoted earlier: but the whole passage deserves notice, since it brings together so many of the recurrent topoi I have considered. Nor is the succeeding paragraph any less revealing: here Defoe adopts a curious self-dramatising mode, full of the vocabulary of Puritan discipline. But I have condemn7d myself (unhappily) to Silence upon this Head, and therefore, resolving however to pay this Homage to the Dust of gallant Men and glorious Nations, I say therefore, I must submit and go on; and as I re- solve once more to travel through all these Northern Countries upon this very Errand, and to please, nay satiate myself with a strict Search into every thing that is curious in Nature and Antiquity. I mortify my self now with the more ease, in hopes of letting the World see, some time or other, that I have not spent those Hours in a vain and Barren Search, or come back without a sufficient Reward to all the Labours of a diligent Enquirer, but of this by the way. With its slightly chastened air of anxious self-inquiry, the tone here is closer to that of Defoe's novels, particularly Robinson Crusoe, than</page><page sequence="29">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 181 anywhere else in the book. Significantly, the extra imaginative po- tency enters the Tour in the shadow of the ruins of time.36 Third and lastly, Defoe's strategic contrast between the two ele- ments I have just considered, growth and decay. At its simplest, the device consists of a violent oxymoron set up within these terms. Thus we find full perfection of decay and very perfection of decay, with similar phrases. (There is an equivalent paradox used to underline the emphasis on quantity: several times, Defoe speaks of an innumerable number!) However, the opposition is often more elaborate and more interesting. "If contraries illustrate . . . ," Defoe once muses (II, 583); and his technique does indeed rely heavily on the interplay of favour- ite Augustan antinomies-Nature and Art figured in the last quota- tion, and they appear together on half a dozen further occasions.37 Nevertheless, it is the contrast between expansion and contraction which most occupies Defoe. On the one side there is overplus, en- largement, the world of profitable and delightful activity. Set square- ly up against this is the world of neglect, of shattered buildings and desert countryside. One pole connotes life, health, fecundity; the other suggests dying of age, sinking into rubbish (a surprisingly com- mon noun), burying beneath time.38 Images of plenty, bounty, wealth, are directly confronted by disaster, calamities, delapidation. Filtered through one set of terms, Britain is populous, growing, prolific: through the other, it is seen as stript, sterile, waste. The nation's trea- sure is inexhaustible, her citadels so undemolished still (I, 170, a strange locution). Yet in the same breath Defoe will show us mines quite exhausted or towns all demolished.39 There are some sixty passages in which this contrast is arawn out 36 Esther Moir writes, "Defoe's determination not to be led astray from his avowed purpose of studying the present day into the delightful view of antiquity, has de- prived us of what would undoubtedly have been refreshingly sane and balanced descriptions" (p. 45). This is to take Defoe's protestations too literally; his need to resolve and mortify himself arises from his inability to stick to his declared objectives. Actually the Tour never holds to this self-denying ordinance for longer than a page or two at a time. 37 A well-known instance occurs in the description of Bushey Heath: "It was all Nature, and yet look'd all like Art" (I, 388). See also II, 581. Nature is sometimes used in a personified sense. 38 Defoe speaks of "the Corps of the old English Grandeur laid in State" (I, 365), by which he means the "ruin'd Antiquity" of the Palace of Westminster. 39 Abate and decline also figure on a number of occasions, e.g., II, 449. Depre- dated occurs at I, 187.</page><page sequence="30">182 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES most explicitly. In my view they are the key sections by which the imaginative contours of the Tour are defined. The general character of their contribution to Defoe's purposes can be gauged from a sam- ple survey. Apart from the passage on Dunwich already quoted, there is the carefully etched "View of the Difference between the present and the past Greatness of this mighty City, called London" (I, 332); and the detailed comparison of English and Scottish palaces: Greenwich and Nonsuch are demolished. Richmond quite out of Use, and not able to receive a Court. Winchester, never inhabited, or half finished. Whitehall burnt, and lying in Ruins ... Westminster, long since abandon'd ... Whereas the Kings of Scotland had in King James the Vlth's Time all in good Repair, and in Use, The several Royal Palaces ... (II, 776) Of course, added force is imparted to this contrast by the fact that it runs in the opposite direction from the prevailing antithesis between prosperous England and economically backward Scotland. Defoe returns obsessively to this way of polarising the data avail- able to him. The town of Bideford has flourished; its twin, the town of Barnstaple rather declined, because of an involuntary rivalry (I, 260). Again, "if we calculate Things present, by Things past, the Town of Minehead is risen out of the Decay of the Towns of Porlock and Watchet" (I, 268). The town of Ancaster swelled up into a city, but is now sunk again out of knowledge (II, 501). York is none the less beautiful because its ancient fortifications are now demolished, "for the beauty of Peace is seen in the rubbish" (II, 636). Appleby was once a flourishing city, but is now a scattering, decayed and half- demolished town (II, 681: many other similar examples). Hadding- ton shows the marks of decayed beauty: it is easy to see it is not what it has been, but an "old half ruin'd, yet remaining Town" (II, 700). Nothing will save Ayr from death, if trade does not revive; Ludlow shows in its decay, what it was in its flourishing estate. Defoe often extracts a wry humour from this contradiction: at Worcester, he says, "I went to see the Town-House, which afforded nothing worth taking notice of, unless it be how much it wants to be mended with a new one" (II, 443). Whilst at Doncaster,</page><page sequence="31">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 183 This Town, Mr. Cambden says, was burnt entirely to the Ground, Anno 759, and is hardly recovered yet; but I must say, it is so well recovered, that I see no Ruins appear, and indeed, being almost a thousand Years ago, I know not how there should; and besides, the Town seems as if it wanted an- other Conflagration, for it looks old again, and many of the Houses ready to fall. (II, 589) Abbotsbury, Defoe observes with contempt, is a town "anciently fa- mous for a great Monastery, and now eminent for nothing but its Ruins" (I, 214). Two personal elements can be detected in all this. In the first place, Defoe was obviously keenly interested in the process of restoration after a disaster. It does not seem rash to attribute this to his own ex- perience of the Great Fire and the subsequent rebuilding of London. Possibly one might see the Restoration of the monarchy, that crucial event for seventeenth-century Englishmen, as going some way to ex- plain Defoe's perpetual recourse to phrases like "a general Ruin a little recover'd" (I, 118) or of York "'tis risen again" out of decay (II, 636). Of course, Defoe does explicitly refer both to the rebuilding operations and to the King's return; but it may be that his attitudes were affected at a deeper level too. In the second place, there is a notable tendency to harp on the calamitous effects of the South Sea Bubble. As one who had twice known bankruptcy, it is to be expected that Defoe would have this recent trauma in the national experience strongly imprinted on his mind. All the same, Defoe seems even more obsessed by the topic than one would have anticipated. He just cannot keep off it.40 And it is not simply that he mentions the Bubble and its effects so regularly: his writing takes on a special plangency at such moments, and the familiar imagery of growth and decay is invested with a poetry rarely found in his "creative" work. For example, after dilating on the glory of the houses on the outskirts of London ("they reflect Beauty, and Magnificence upon the whole Country, and give a kind of Character to the Island of Great Britain in general"), Defoe turns to the wealth of the city which makes possible building on such a scale: but there is another side. 40 Cf. 1, 37, 346. Defoe also makes a number of references to the ruin occasioned by the stop of the exchequer in 1672, e.g., I, 353.</page><page sequence="32">184 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES It also would take up a large Chapter in this Book, to but mention the over- throw, and Catastrophe of innumerable Wealthy City Families, who after they have thought their Houses establish'd, and have built their Magnificent Country Seats, as well as others, have sunk under the Misfortunes of Busi- ness, and the Disasters of Trade, after the World has thought them pass'd all possibility of Danger . .. (I, 169) An even more lyrical passage on the "Misfortunes of Business, and the Disasters of Trade" occurs at the end of the first letter. Defoe de- scribes with enthusiasm Wanstead House, the home of the mercantile Child family, and then goes on: I shall cover as much as possible the melancholy part of a Story, which touches too sensibly, manv, if not most of the Great and Flourishing Fam- ilies in England: Pity and matter of Grief is it to think that Families, by Estate, able to appear in such a Glorious Posture as this, should ever be Vul- nerable by so mean a Disaster as that of Stock-Jobbing: But the General Infatuation of the Day is a Plea for it; so that Men are not now blamed on that Account: South-Sea was a general Possession; and if my Lord Castle- main was Wounded by that Arrow shot in the Dark, 'twas a Misfortune: But 'tis so much a Happiness, that it was not a mortal Wound, as it was to some Men, who once seem'd as much out of the reach of it; and that Blow, be it what it will, is not remember'd for joy of the Escape.... This cannot be said of some other Families in this County, whose fine Parks and new-built Palaces are fallen under Forfeitures and Alienations by the Misfortunes of the Times, and by the Ruin of their Masters Fortunes in that South-Sea Deluge. But I desire to throw a Veil over these Things, as they come in my way; 'tis enough that we write upon them as was written upon King Harold's Tomb at Waltham-Abbey, INFELIX and let all the rest sleep among Things that are the fittest to be forgotten. (I, 90) This is much more than a diatribe against the villainy of stock- jobbing. It outlines a little tragic plot, where pity and grief unite in a studied lament on the mutability of things. How conscious was Defoe of what, on this showing, he was provid- ing through the rhetoric of his Tour? Reasonably so, in my view. His preface announces at the very start all the leading themes-the most flourishing and opulent Country in the World, a flowing Variety of Materials, as well as Novelty opposed to Antiquity. In the third para- graph encrease turns up three times; other metaphoric terms include luxuriance, harvest, face of things, glean, fruitful. And by the second page, it is evident that the growth-decay syndrome is present in the writer's mind:</page><page sequence="33">LITERARY ART IN DEFOE'S TOUR 185 The Fate of Things gives a new Face to Things, produces Changes in low Life, and innumerable Incidents; plants and supplants Families, raises and sinks Towns, removes Manufactures, and Trade; Great Towns decay, and small Towns rise; new Towns, new Palaces, new Seats are built every Day; great Rivers and good Harbours dry up, and grow useless; again, new Ports are open'd, Brooks are made Rivers, small Rivers, navigable Ports and Har- bours are made where none were before and the like. Several Towns, which Antiquity speaks of as considerable, are now lost and swallow'd up by the Sea, as Dunwich in Sufjolk for one; and others, which Antiquity knew noth- ing of, are now grown considerable: In a Word, New Matter offers to new observation, and they who write next, may perhaps find as much room for enlarging upon us, as we do upon those that have gone before. (I, 2) It would be otiose to list all the favourite items from Defoe's vocab- ulary here. Enough to recognise the general effect, which is distinc- tively Augustan-antithetical, elevated, sententious, eloquent to its nerve ends. One can hardly doubt that, in setting these pointed lines at the head of his work, Defoe knew what he was doing. This is the idiom of one habituated to placing things; to comparing, contrasting, sorting, and arranging experience. It is a rhetoric of process, which disposes and aligns facts within a historical sequence, A great deal of Defoe's own experience went into the Tour. Yet it is far from a direct transcript. Although there is so much shrewd ob- servation of contemporary Britain in its pages, the inner momentum of the book derives from an astonishingly clear sense of history. De- foe reordered his personal memories, interlarding his own tours (made over half a lifetime) with borrowing from published sources. What he gives us is not a tour, straight, but the experiential equiv- alent of a tour. He imbued the work, too, with a crotchety, sometimes literal-minded poetry of his own. For this task he needed all his liter- ary art, acquired not just as a great reporter, but as a great imagina- tive creator, too. So Defoe achieved the true English epic. (Sig- nificantly, it is a non-martial epic, perhaps closer to Virgil than Homer.)4' His chosen vehicle was not that of the vainglorious Bru- tiad's and Boadicea's which men of the age so often projected, but the homely guidebook form, within which he dramatised his sense of the British nation, in its fullness and all its contrasting moods.
