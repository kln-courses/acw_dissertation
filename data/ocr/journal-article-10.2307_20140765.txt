<plain_text><page sequence="1">JEWISH MYSTICISM ON TRIAL IN A MUSLIM COURT: A FATW? ON THE ZOHAR?YEMEN 1914 BY MARK S. WAGNER Hattiesburg (MS),USA Abstract In the early decades of the twentieth century, a heated debate over the legitimacy ofjew ish mystical texts, foremost among them the /??)har, divided the Jews of San'?3, the Yemeni capital, into two camps. In 1914, one Jewish faction took the other to a Muslim court. There, a Muslim jurist heard arguments for and against Jews' study of the ?ohar. The resulting fatw? sheds light on this fascinating moment of inter-religious dialogue. At issue here is the ex tent to which the Jewish litigants framed their arguments in Islamic terms and the ways in which the Muslim jurist and his employer, Im?m Yahy? Hamid al-D?n, the theocratic ruler of Yemen, understood Judaism in terms borrowed from contemporary debates on Islamic sectarianism. The centrality of this fatw? in later permutations of the schism within Yemeni Judaism will be addressed as well. In 1914, in a Muslim courtroom in Yemen, two groups of Jewish scholars debated the legality of studying the %ohar, a central text in Jewish mysticism.* The question of the legitimacy of the kabbalistic tradition had generated a schism within Yemenite Judaism that split its leadership. Both the presiding Muslim judge, Yahy? b. Muhammad b. cAbb?s al Huth? (d. 1962) and the Zayd? im?m, al-Mutawakkil cal? Allah Yahy? b. Muhammad Hamid al-D?n (d. 1948), weighed in on the issue of the ?ohafs legality. The fatw? that records the decisions rendered by these two men offers a rare example of a Muslim court adjudicating a substantive issue within Judaism.1 Using this document, I will discuss the ways in which the Jewish parties to the court proceedings imagined Islam in making their I would like to thank Bernard Haykel for his help with the text that follows this article and Abdulaziz Sachedina for his comments. 1 For examples of this phenomenon in medieval Cairo, see S.

WAGNER arguments, and the ways in which the Muslim authorities imagined the schism within Yemenite Judaism. I will show that one of the Jewish parties to the court proceedings depicted Islam as the de jure (and perhaps defacto) defender of monotheism. The other appealed to an Islam that defended society from change. The Muslim authorities, in turn, saw the schism within Judaism as an extension of Muslim sectarianism in Yemen. I will also discuss how the conclusions reached in this fatw? reverberated through subsequent flare-ups in the conflict over the kabbalah in Yemen. Scholarship on the schism over the kabbalah in Yemenite Judaism tends to follow three main approaches. The first, a conciliatory tendency aimed by Yemenite Jewish writers at an audience of Yemenite Jews, details the history of the controversy in order to minimize and smooth over the rift in the community.2 (The schism within Yemenite Judaism persists today.) The second tendency, a modernist interpretation aimed at the Israeli general public and an academic Hebrew readership, describes the schism as a rather isolated outcrop in the wider terrain of Judaism's struggles with modernity. This approach emphasizes the European roots of the Yemenite Jewish reform movement and uses terms borrowed from the experience of European Jewry (like haskalah, hasidim and mitnagdim) to describe the conflict in Yemen.3 One or more "enlightened" European scholars who visited Yemen may indeed have planted the seed for the controversy over the kabbalah. The Austrian Jewish archaeologist Eduard Glaser, for example, likely provided Rabbi Yahy? Q?fih, who later became the central figure in the reform movement, with scientific instruments and Hebrew books printed in Europe.4 Nevertheless, the 2 The essay "Hakhme ha-yehudim bi-tsan'a5: mahloqet ve-ha-shalom she-nacaseh bene hem", by R. S?lim Sac?d al-Jamal (Shalom b. Secadyah Gamliel), which he appended to his Hakhme ha-yehudim be-teman be-dorenu ve-cadsamukh letqufat ha-tana im, Jerusalem: Makhon Sha lom le-shivtc yeshurun, 1992, is the best example of this trend. 3 Moshe Tsadoq, "Nitsane 'haskalah' be-teman", Davar, July 30, 1954; cAmram Gam liel, "A Spark of Enlightenment among the Jews of Yemen", Hebrew Studies 25 (1984), pp. 82 89; Yehudah Nini, "Pulmus Mi-'inyan vikuah 'aqar 'al hokhmat ha-qabalah ben hakhme teman be-reshit ha-me ah", Mikha'el 14 (1997), pp. 215-243. 4 One of the candidates most often cited for this dubious honor is the French archaeol ogist Joseph Hal?vy, who came to Yemen to investigate Sabaic antiquities in 1869-1870 on behalf of the Acad?mie Fran?aise. Cf. Yosef Q?fih, "Qprot Yisra'el be-teman le-R. Hayim Hibshush", Sefunot 2 (1958), p. 281, n. 219; Yehudah Ratzhaby, "Le-Toldot ha-mahloqet</page><page sequence="3">JEWISH MYSTICISM ON TRIAL IN A MUSLIM COURT 209 schism unfolded within an Arabic-Islamic milieu and, more significantly, within an Islamic legal framework. The third tendency, which can be designated "Arabist", takes into account the Arabic-Islamic context. The eminent scholar of South Arabia, R. B. Serjeant, briefly discussed the fatw? in question in his study of Sanc?3, describing it as "a very instructive case of co-operation between Muslims and Jews in defence of the traditional way of life in Sanc?"'.5 A Syrian writer, Gamilia Abu Jabal, mentioned the case in her 1999 The Jews of Temen. To her, the case reflected the complete freedom of religious expression which Muslim authorities granted the Jews of Yemen.6 Each of these three characterizations, I will argue, rests upon a rather superficial reading of the dynamics of the fatw? and its significance. In this paper I will depart from conciliatory, modernist, and Arabist approaches by examining the role played by Muslim views of Judaism and Jewish views of Islam within the controversy over the kabbalah. Where does the text of the 1914 fatw? originate? In the 1930s, after the events that are the focus of this paper, a rabbi named S?lim Sac?d al Jamal gained Im?m Yahy?'s confidence and served as the "point man" for interactions between the authorities and the Jewish community. Rabbi al-Jamal (d. 2001) emigrated to Palestine in 1944 and brought cal ha-qabalah beqhilat tsana be-shnot 1913-1914", Pe'amim 88 (2001), p. 99; Yosef Tobi, "Yosef Halevi ve-heqer yehude teman", Pe'amim 100 (2004), pp. 23-72. The Bohemian ar chaeologist Eduard Glaser (1855-1908), who spent several years in Yemen in the 1880s, is also mentioned frequently. He shared an interest in astronomy with Yahy? al-Q?fih and the two apparently were friends. Goitein confirms that Glaser sent Rabbi Q?fih the Hebrew books Qinat emet, Are nohem, She'agat ariyeh and Qol sekhel. Cf. S. D. Goitein, "Mi hayah Edu ard Glazer", Yisrael Yeshayahu and Aharon Tsadoq (eds.), Shvut Teman, Tel Aviv: Hots'at "mi-teman le-tsiyon", 1945, p. 149. In a letter to the Alliance Israelite Universelle in Paris, Yahy? al-Q?fih mentioned these and other anti-kabbalistic works. Cf. Nini, "Pulmus", p. 243; Anonymous, Quntres magen ve-tsinah ha-hosefetha-emetcalkatha-kofrim ha-niqra'im iidarddim'''&gt; umegaleh et partsufo ha-amiti shel ha-omed bi-roshah, Brooklyn/Israel, 1993, p. 46. Yosef Q?fih, Yahy?'s grandson, said that Glaser sent his grandfather scientific instruments and Hebrew books on natural science printed in Vilna. Cf. Nini, "Pulmus", p. 227. Glaser already was the target of the anti-Dor Decah faction in the anonymously authored 1937 Sefer emunat ha shem. There the author states that Glaser was a non-Jew, a fact allegedly confirmed by a Jew who followed him into a bath house and took note of his foreskin. 1 R. B.

WAGNER with him a large trove of Muslim legal documents from his career in Im?m Yahy?'s service. The fatw? in question may have been one of the documents that Rabbi al-Jamal brought with him because it was copied during a period of time when al-Jamal was engaged in procuring copies of other Muslim legal documents. A book on Yemenite Jewry printed in Tel Aviv in 1945 included a rather poor reproduction of this fatw?, along with a Hebrew translation of its contents.7 My edition of this fatw? is based upon this reproduction. The fatw? designates the first of the two parties to the court proceedings the "Q?fih faction" farlq al-Q?fih), after their spiritual leader, Rabbi Yahy? al-Q?fih (1849-1932). Q?fih, a former chief rabbi of Sanc?5, astronomer, and reformer, led a vigorous campaign against the kabbalistic tradition and in favor of a Judaism that he believed to be authentic. Q?fih designed and directed a modernizing Jewish school in Sanc?5 that taught natural science and the Turkish and Arabic languages, as well as a religious curriculum.8 His school was intended to replace the traditional "maktab" where texts were memorized by rote. The second camp, which the fatw? designates the "Ish?q faction" farlq Ish?q), was led by Yahy? Ish?q, the sitting Chief Rabbi of Sanc?5, who defended the kabbalah. Leading rabbis affiliated with each faction appeared in court before the Muslim judge, Yahy? b. Muhammad b. cAbb?s al-H?th?, and later, before Im?m Yahy?. Each side would later accuse the other of having brought the case to a non-Jewish court, something which Yemenite Jews seldom admitted but routinely did.9 Jews in Yemen often brought cases to Muslim courts, even those involving only Jewish claimants.10) The fatw? itself seems to indicate that the im?m took the initiative, having heard about the 7 Yisrael Yeshayahu and Aharon Tsadoq (eds.), Shvut Teman, Tel Aviv: Hots'at "mi teman le-tsiyon", 1945, pp. 223-226. 8 See Joseph Tobi, The Jews of Temen: Studies in Their History and Culture, Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1999, chapter ten. 9 In Yehudah Ratzhaby, "Le-Toldot ha-mahloqet", p. 104 and Anonymous, Quntres magen ve-tsinah, p. 75, the Q?fih faction went to the Muslim court. In Yosef Tobi, "Mi hiber et sefer emunat ha-shem?", Da at 49 (2002), p. 88, and Nini, "Pulmus", p. 233, the Ish?q faction brought the issue to the Imam's attention. 10 Yehudah Ratshaby, "Tnyane yehudim be-arkhacot shel goyim", Haggai Ben Sham mai (ed.), Hikre 'ever ve-arav mugashim le-yehoshu ah blau calyade haverav be-melot lo shivcim, Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv University, 1993, pp. 515f; Yehiel Nahshon, Hanhagat ha-qehilah ha-yehudit be-teman (me'ot 17-18), Tel Aviv: Ha-Agudah le-tipuah hevrah ve-tarbut, 2002, p. 138.</page><page sequence="5">JEWISH MYSTICISM ON TRIAL IN A MUSLIM COURT 2 1 1 controversy that had developed between kabbalists and anti-kabbalists among his Jewish subjects. He ordered rabbis affiliated with each of the two Jewish factions to appear before a Muslim judge. The impression derived from the text is confirmed by Shalom cUzayr?, a member of the anti-kabbalah faction, who writes in his memoir that Im?m Yahy? heard about the strife within the Jewish community and asked each side to send two representatives to his residence in al-Qafla in the territory north of Sanc?' controlled by the H?shid tribal confederation. The Q?fih camp sent Rid? al-S?rum and Avshalom MashriqL The Ish?q faction sent Yosef Ish?q, the brother of Rabbi Yahy? Ish?q, and an anonymous Jew from among the Jews of Khamr, in H?shid territory, who served as his guide. The four Jews stayed with the im?m for several days, during which they informed him of the nature of the dispute. They asked him to appoint a trustworthy judge who could resolve the dispute once and for all. The im?m appointed the sayyid Yahy? b. Muhammad b. cAbb?s al H?th? to the task.11 The proceedings were held in the ?mam's residence in Sanc?\ According to 'Uzayr?, two Muslim guests attended who are not mentioned in the fatw? itself: 'Abdallah, the eldest son of Muhammad al-Sunayd?r, an important merchant who had many business dealings with Jews and Ahmad al-Raf?q, who weighed snuff, including that sold by Jews, in the market.12 According to the fatw?, the goal of the arbitration was the production of a document expressing the consensus of both sides. Roughly its first half contains the comments of the ruling judge. He exhorts the Jews to adhere to established customs in the observance of festivals, prayer, and books to be studied. He also emphasizes the need to avoid both coercion and verbal abuse by one faction or the other. He then discusses the issue of the Zohar. The second half contains Im?m Yahy?'s comments. Im?m Yahy? had a reputation for xenophobia and for "micro-managing" the legal system. In addition to addressing the legality of the %phar and the question what works Jews may study, the im?m seems to have seen the proceedings as an opportunity to settle a number of outstanding, and not 1 ' Shalom 'Uzayr?, Gale or: Pirqe zikhronot, Tel Aviv, 1985, p. 16. 12 Ibid; Muhammad Zab?ra, Nuzhat al-nazarfl rij?l al-qarn al-r?bi cashar, Sanc?5: Markaz al-dir?s?t wa-1-abh?th al-yamaniyya, 1979, p. 583.</page><page sequence="6">212 MARK S. WAGNER necessarily connected, issues with the Jewish community: five synagogues whose construction was of dubious legality, whether or not Rabbi Q?fih's school should be allowed to operate, and the problem of Jewish women who dressed immodestly. Whether or not they initiated the legal proceedings, each Jewish faction sought to use them to their advantage. The anti-kabbalist faction farlq al-Q?fih) sought to use the court proceedings to capitalize on what they believed would be a strong distaste for the kabbalah on the part of the Muslim jurists. The kabbalist faction farlq Ish?q) sought to use the court proceedings to portray their opponents as threats to the existing social order. The text of the fatw? makes clear that the Ish?q faction, that is, the kabbalists, had the upper hand. Leading members of the anti-kabbalah Q?fih faction, including Rabbi Q?fih himself, were imprisoned for a short time soon after appearing before the court. In addition, the fatw? repeatedly asserts the kabbalist Rabbi Yahy? Ish?q's authority. However, the fatw? shows a concerted attempt on behalf of both the presiding judge and Im?m Yahy? to placate each of the two Jewish factions, often at the risk of clarity. This overly inclusive tendency manifests itself most clearly in the fatw?'s emphasis on preserving the status quo in ritual observance and social practice; while permitting those who disagreed with the status quo to follow their instincts, it provided that neither those preserving the status quo, nor those diverging from it, attack the other ? verbally or otherwise. The overriding concern of the Muslim jurists was preserving the social order and reducing strife between the two factions. The kabbalist camp denounced the anti-kabbalists to the Muslim authorities as agents of foreign powers and adherents of the Greek philosophers.13 They made the incendiary charge that the pupils in Rabbi Q?fih's modern school tucked their sidelocks under their tarbooshes, or even cut them off altogether, in imitation of their Turkish 13 Yahy? al-Q?fih, Milhamot ha-shem, Jerusalem 1931, p. 129; Nini, "Pulmus", p. 242; Hayim Shar'abi, "Peraqim mi-farashat cdor-decah5 be-teman", Shvut Teman, p. 206; Yosef Tobi, "Hedim le-vikuah cal ha-qabalah bi-sefer "ets hayim' le-rabi secadyah naddaf (tsanca 1926)", Aharon Ben-David and Yitshaq Gluska (eds.), Mehqarim be-lashon ha-civrit uvimad'e ha yahadut, Jerusalem: Ha-Agudah le-tipuah hevrah ve-tarbut, 2001, p. 109; idem, "Mi hiber et sefer emunat ha-shem?", pp. 88f.</page><page sequence="7">JEWISH MYSTICISM ON TRIAL IN A MUSLIM COURT 213 instructor.14 The text of the fatw? probably reflects this charge when it inveighs against "the removal of sidelocks, shaving of beards, or such things as would change [the Jews'] normal appearance". Both the judge Yahy? b. Muhammad b. cAbb?s, and Im?m Yahy? gave considerable leeway to individual Jewish scholars' beliefs (iHiq?d) about what was firmly established in Judaism (th?bit) and what in it was innovation (muhdath). Along these lines, they emphasized the inappropriateness of coercion as a means of settling the dispute between the two parties, as the judge proclaimed: "none of them is to be coerced into being present or participating in something which they do not believe to be a fixed part of their religion". Im?m Yahy? made his opposition to religious coercion abundantly clear to an unnamed Jew who challenged his ruling during a later phase of the dispute, in the 1930s. Im?m Yahy? asked this man: "Do you want me to coerce you in your beliefs? Coercion is never acceptable. If I were to coerce someone, I would coerce all of you into [following] the law of Muhammad..."15 In the fatw? the judge notes that the two sides made various arguments in his presence about the theological soundness or heresy of the ?ohar (Kit?b al-^awhar or Kit?b al-^uhar). The fatw? shows that the anti-kabbalist camp portrayed their opponents as men who dabbled in polytheism, a position that conformed to Rabbi Q?fih's written polemics against anthropomorphic language in the ?ohar.16 Unnamed anti-kabbalists claimed in the Muslim court that the %ohar "negates God's unicity and His attributes". Given that the Islamic state's tolerance for Jews was contingent upon their monotheistic beliefs, this was a loaded charge. It is unlikely that those who made it were unaware of either its gravity or the potential impact it might have in a Muslim legal setting. Indeed, 14 Yosef Tobi, The Jews of Temen, p. 185. 11 Gamliel, Hakhme ha-yehudim be-teman, p. 218; idem, Bate hakneset bi-tsana' birat teman, Je rusalem: Makhon Shalom le-shivte yeshurun, 1996/1997, vol. 2, pp. 130f. 16 In 1914a ban of excommunication against Rabbi Yahy? al-Q?fih (he first of several) was printed and posted on the walls of Jerusalem, signed by a long roster of Ashkenazi and Sephardi rabbis. Q?fih fired back, excommunicating the rabbis of Jerusalem and mocking their belief in the kabbalah. "It is not enough for them" Q?fih wrote, "that they believe, with perfect faith, in the existence of many goddesses, both holy and impure, [which goes] against [the teachings of] all of our prophets and sages (may their memories be a blessing). Rather, they worship 'potencies' and 'faces,' which they associate with the body [...]." Yahy? Q?fih, (Amal u-recut ruah: heremot utshuvotam, Tel Aviv, Defus Qp'operativi, 1914, p. 15. Rabbi Q?fih expanded on this theme in his 1931 Milhamot ha-shem, p. 95.</page><page sequence="8">214 MARK S. WAGNER the claim that Sunni Muslims practiced anthropomorphism (tashblh or tajslm) was one of the main reasons that many Zayd? scholars held them to be infidels. The fatw?, however, shows that the judge was relatively unconcerned with the directions taken by the two Jewish factions in arguments over the Zonar' This was because both sides agreed that no Jew needed to study it. In his written comments, Im?m Yahy? affirmed the judge's ruling and went even further in defending the ?ohar. He said that the JTphar's contradiction of the Torah "did not appear to be central, as we explained to those present, and as they themselves admitted". Im?m Yahy? ruled that "what should be studied in their synagogues and academies is that which Yahy? Ish?q studies of that which is not new (ghayr muhdath)" By saying this, Im?m Yahy? attempted to placate both camps. Yahy? Ish?q, the head of the kabbalist camp, studied the ?ohar. Therefore, providing that it was not an innovation, the Jews should study it. The question of whether the ?ohar constitutes an innovation is left ambiguous. However, considering the fatw?''s syntactic linkage between the books Yahy? Ish?q studies and the need to preserve the sartorial customs that distinguish Jews from Muslims, one can make a strong case on the basis of the text of the fatw? alone that the study of the %ohar, as a time-honored practice in Yemenite Judaism, should continue. Similarly, the im?m asked that Rabbi Q?fih's modern school be closed but added: "if one of them wished to study an area of knowledge that was unconnected to their religion, like speaking and writing Arabic or Turkish, arithmetic, and the like, there would be nothing to prevent them". Ironically, the dynasty to which Im?m Yahy? belonged, the house of Ham?d al-D?n, took an exceptionally dim view of Islamic mysticism, a position that was rooted in Zayd? tradition.17 In the fatw? the Zayd? judge defends Jewish mysticism in order to preserve the status quo. Thus, it is an example of the ends (the preservation of the traditional order from change) justifying the means (the defense of mystical texts).18 17 Im?m Ahmad, Yahy?'s son, undertook the demolition of the tomb of the Sufi saint Ahmad b.

The fatw? affirmed the authority of their leader, Rabbi Yahy? Ish?q, and reiterated his role in preserving the status quo of relations between Jews and Muslims. Yet the emphasis on a Jewish scholar's individual belief as to whether or not a given aspect of Judaism was fixed in tradition or an innovation, and on the eschewal of coercion in matters of belief, supported the anti-kabbalah faction. In fact, when the dispute between the two factions flared up again in the 1930s, it was the anti-kabbalist faction that routinely demanded that the imam's ruling in the fatw? of al-Qafla be upheld. This case was probably the first in which Im?m Yahy? emphasized the importance of an individual's own beliefs in choosing one of two religious options, the need to avoid coercion, and the need to avoid all recriminations based upon such matters. It was not, however, the last. In 1919 he promulgated a nearly identical ruling to manage the differences in rite between Zayd? Shfites (the majority of the population of Highland Yemen) and ShafT? Sunnis (the majority in Lower Yemen). He ordered that Zayd?s and ShafT?s must pray together in the mosques without disturbing one another.19 This, in itself, showed a strikingly permissive attitude towards Sunni Islam on the part of Im?m Yahy?.20 Looking back on the controversy over the kabbalah some sixty years later, Rabbi S?lim Sac?d al-Jamal astutely observed that Im?m Yahy?'s not translate into his support for Q?fih's rationalistic view of Judaism. Gf. Joseph Tobi, The Jews of Yemen, p. 190. 19 The only historical testimony of which I am aware that the im?m undertook this step comes from Shalom b. Secadyah Gamliel, Hakhme ha-yehudim, pp. 214f. 20 Ahmad b. al-Q?sim al-cAns?'s mid-twentieth century Zayd? legal manual, al-T?j al mudhahhab li-ahk?m al-madhhab, Sanc?': Maktabat al-Yaman al-kubr?, 1947, vol. 4, pp. 467f. provides a convenient summary of Zayd? attitudes towards Sunnis under the rubric of "judging the apostate" (hukm al-murtadd). Some held that Sunnis, as believers in determinism (jabr) and anthropomorphism (tashb?h), and therefore "infidels by [their incorrect] interpre tation" (kiiffar al-taw?l), should be offered conversion to Zayd? Shicism or death. Others be lieved that as believers in a sacred book (the Qur'an) Sunnis should be offered the status of dhimm?s and made to pay the jizya. Others held that Sunnis could be buried in [Zayd?] Mus lim cemeteries, that one could pray behind them in the mosque, and that their testimony in court could be offered equal weight to that of a Zayd??their punishment for infidelity (kufr) would be exacted in the afterlife. Some im?ms rejected the concept of "infidels by [their in correct] interpretation" altogether, holding that Sunnis should only be held to "the laws gov erning Muslim transgressors?[theirs] is a transgression whose adjudication requires neither abasement (sighar) nor holding high (kibary\</page><page sequence="10">216 MARK S. WAGNER policy towards Jewish sectarianism was exactly his policy towards Muslim sectarianism.21 Ultimately, the fatw? failed to resolve the dispute over the kabbalah. Its excessive inclusiveness, however, was not its fatal flaw. It faltered on account of a misunderstanding of the practicalities of Jewish prayer on the part of the Muslims who drafted it. In general, the kabbalists followed one distinct prayer rite, the anti-kabbalists another.22 In the fatw?, Im?m Yahy? ruled that each Jew pray according to his own rite, a solution later adopted for doctrinal disputes between Zayd?s and ShafT?s. This solution, however, possessed a problem in its application to the Jewish community. While Zayd?s and ShafT?s differed substantially in their theological ideas and their views of the Islamic past, the differences between the ways in which they prayed were relatively minor and were unlikely to disrupt the other group. If every member of a Jewish prayer quorum (minyan) did not follow the rite of the precentor, their prayers would be cacophonous. When the controversy over the kabbalah reemerged in the 1930s, the imam's unwillingness to address this discrepancy between Islam and Judaism would become a bone of contention.23 It is possible that the 21 Gamliel, Bate hakneset bi-tsanca birat teman, vol. 2, p. 94. 22 The issue of rite in Yemeni Judaism has its own complex history. The Sephardi rite, called "sham?" in Yemen, was associated with the kabbalists. Most members of the Q?fih faction prayed in the "balad?" rite. This rite was believed to reflect the state of the Yeme ni liturgy prior to the dissemination of kabbalistic ideas in Yemen in the late Middle Ages. There were, however, kabbalistically-inclined rabbis who followed the balad? rite, among them Yahy? Ish?q. Therefore, by demanding that Jews pray according to Yahy? Ish?q's rite, as the im?m once did in the 1930s, the Muslim authorities unwittingly strengthened the hand of the Q?fih faction, while thinking that they were ruling in favor of the Ish?q faction. Shalom b. Secadyah Gamliel, Pequde teman: Mas he-hasut be-teman, Jerusalem: Makhon Shalom le-shivte yeshurun, 1982, p. 167. 23 Rabbi S?lim Sac?d al-Jamal may have deliberately misled the im?m on this issue in the 1930s. Al-Jamal suggested that a prayer precentor (shaliah tsibor) who belonged to the anti kabbalah faction in a synagogue whose leadership was hotly contested between the two fac tions, be allowed to pray according to his rite and that anyone who complained should be fined. Gf. Gamliel, Bate hakneset bi-tsansa birat teman, vol. 1, p. 438. Al-Jamal neglected to men tion that because the man was the precentor, his rite would trump any other congregant's rite. In a similar instance, Rabbi al-Jamal reported telling the leaders of the anti-kabbalah fac tion that it was best to keep the im?m in the dark about the inapplicability of the individual rite solution to Judaism, for fear that it might strengthen the hand of the opposing faction. Gf. Gamliel, Bate hakneset, vol. 3, p. 154. Al-Jamal says that he told a Zayd? judge in two in stances that a solution involving adherents of each of the two rites praying together was un workable. The second time Gamliel told the judge this, he added that the suggestion was a very good one for Muslims, explained the differences between the two Jewish rites in Ye</page><page sequence="11">JEWISH MYSTICISM ON TRIAL IN A MUSLIM COURT 217 view of Jewish sectarianism as an extension of Muslim sectarianism colored Im?m Yahy? and other Zayd? jurists' outlook to the point that they preferred to ignore this contradictory information. The loaded charge that the anti-kabbalah faction made in court, namely, that the kabbalist faction's fondness for anthropomorphisms made their monotheism suspect, reared its head several times during a later stage of the controversy in the 1930s. In a letter to Im?m Yahy? dated September 12 1935, representatives of the anti-kabbalah camp wrote: "we are those who affirm exalted God's unicity and the Ish?q camp [that is, the pro-kabbalah camp] does the opposite".24 Almost a year later, the heads of the anti-kabbalah camp decided to charge their rivals with polytheism (ishr?k) once again in order to discourage prominent Muslims from taking their side.25 One Jew affiliated with the Ish?q camp, Sac?d al-Nadd?f, recently arrived in Palestine, spelled out the implications of this charge for an audience of Yemenite Jews in Jerusalem. In Nadd?f s colorful account of the events of 1914 Im?m Yahy? holds the following exchange with Rid? al-S?rum, one of the two anti-kabbalah scholars who traveled to al Qafla to meet him: [The Im?m] asked "Do you study the ?ohar?" Rid? al-S?rum replied "no, I cannot study it because it makes a number of anthropomorphic statements concerning the Creator." The Im?m replied "What you say may be true but doesn't the entire Torah speak in anthropomorphic language? Does it not say 'Israel is my first-born son' (Ex. 4:22) and 'we shall make man in our image' (Gen. 1:26)? Also, in the Prophets and the Writings there are similar matters, as in what King David says in Psalm 45?what is the meaning of these [statements]?" [The anti-kabbalah scholar] answered: "what is said in that Psalm is said concerning the groom and the bride in order to increase their joy." The Im?m replied: "Nay?these are all spiritual matters, not corporeal anthropomorphisms, and they are all 'eso teric matters' ("ha-nistarof' Deut. 29:28) that are spoken of here. If you persist in asking such thick-headed questions like an uneducated man (God forbid!) it all becomes vanity and emptiness, your religion becomes nothing but vanity, your blood becomes permissible to us, and every person who is called a Hebrew will, God forbid, disappear. Know that if the words of the %phar are not accepted then the Torah must follow and, God forbid, everything will be negated.

WAGNER day forth, understand and return from your [errant] path. Go in the footsteps of your forefathers and do not change a thing.26 In Sac?d al-Nadd?f s letter, Im?m Yahy? defends the ?ohar, quoting Hebrew scripture in the process! The Im?m here is made to push the anti-kabbalah camp's argument ad absurdum: if anthropomorphic language is in itself a sign of polytheism, Jews who follow the Torah are not Jews but polytheists and thus outside of the protection afforded to "peoples of the pact" by the Islamic state.27 Were anthropomorphisms actually to transgress monotheism, the Jews would be offered the choice between conversion to Islam and death. If Zayd? jurists strove mightily to fit the two Jewish rites into the local paradigm of (Zayd?-Shafi 1) sectarianism, how did the Jewish factions view Islam? Islamic law was the law of the land. Therefore, trying to win in a Muslim court by presenting arguments with a Muslim cast, one might argue, had little to do with Islam per se, but merely showed pragmatism on the part of the litigants. Here it should be remembered that the preceding letter was written in Hebrew for a Jewish audience in Jerusalem. Its depiction of Im?m Yahy? as an authority for Judaism transcends power politics in the Jewish community of Yemen. Members of the kabbalist faction, in turn, seem to have viewed Im?m Yahy? as the paternalistic preserver of the social order and, by extension, Jewish tradition, from the encroachments of foreign cultures and misguided would-be reformers. In accusing their enemies of polytheism, members of the anti-kabbalah faction were not only seeking to weaken their opponents in the eyes of their enemies. It is quite possible that they genuinely believed that Im?m Yahy?, and Zayd? jurists in general, would lend a sympathetic ear to their grievances against kabbalistic texts and their teeming anthropomorphisms. They may have seen Im?m Yahy? as the zealous guardian of a pure monotheism that they admired in Islam and sought to instill in Yemenite Judaism. This is not to say that the anti-kabbalah faction and their reformist agenda could be characterized as "Islamicizing" ? at least not consciously 2b Yehudah Ratzhaby, "Le-Toldot ha-mahloqet", p. 120. 27 A similar argument is made in the introduction to the anti-Dor decah work Emunat ha shem, Jerusalem: Dfus Hayim Tsuqerman, 1937; Nini, "Pulmus", p. 237.</page><page sequence="13">JEWISH MYSTICISM ON TRIAL IN A MUSLIM COURT 219 so. Nevertheless, in his lengthy account of the controversy between the two factions, Rabbi S?lim Sac?d al-Jamal made a comment worthy of discussion. Rabbi al-Jamal, it is to be remembered, led the anti-kabbalah faction in the 1930s. Despite being a trusted advisor to Im?m Yahy?, a friend to numerous prominent Muslims, and a person well-versed in the practical application of Zayd? law, Rabbi al-Jamal occasionally indulged in polemics against Islam and its founder. He rounded out one such polemical discussion by conceding that Maimonides was correct in his positive assessment of Islam in the Mishneh Torah.28 The prophet Muhammad, according to Rabbi al-Jamal, "had done a great thing in affirming Exalted God's unity...".29 The anti-kabbalah Q?fih faction likely saw Im?m Yahy? as fulfilling a similar role: that of a militant and uncompromising defender of the monotheistic ideal. By means of this case, I hope to have demonstrated that the schism over the kabbalah that developed among Jews in Yemen and was played out in Muslim courts was not, as the Modernist trend in its interpretation would suggest, merely a Middle Eastern interlude in the paradigmatic modernization of Judaism. Neither did it reflect an ecumenical utopia, as earlier Arabist approaches suggested. Rather, the 1914 fatw? on Jewish mysticism offers a window on a contested arena of religious law in which the outcome depends as much on competing Muslim conceptions of Judaism and Jewish conceptions of Islam as it does on legal arguments. 28 Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Melakhim, eh. 11, Jerusalem: Mosad Ha-Rav Kook, 1962, p. 416; David Novak, "The Treatment of Islam and Muslims in the Legal Writings of Maimonides", William M.

After a detailed exposition of their dispute there was agreement on the part of all of the representatives who had been invited to the Noble Place upon [the need to produce] a document between them. It was ordered that Jewish scholars (ahb?r) from the two sides should come to the third shan a court in San'?' so that there would be a document of their reconciliation (raqm tar?dlhim). From the first side Yahy? Ish?q, cAmr?n Qorah, S?lim al-Jamal,70 Sac?d al-cUzayr?, Ibrahim al-Bad?h?, and H?r?n al-Cohen, arrived. These were the dhimmls from among the followers of Yahy? Ish?q.

Ghayy?th, and Yahy? cAmr. These were the dhimmls who supported Yahy? al-Q?fih. The inquiry into the wish of the two sides and the essence of what was said, on which they reached an accord, was the absence of any objection to anything to which Jews before them conformed such as the fixed [nature of] fringes (al-siy?st) and the movements during prayer and what they know of circumcisions and [wedding] feasts and [the dinner] table. Indeed, their custom should remain as it was without any objection from a single one of them [nor] verbal abuse, vilification, or disdainful speech. However, none of them is to be coerced (majb?ran) into being present or participating in something which they do not believe to be a fixed part of their religion (th?bit? millatihim). For this reason, there is to be no finding of fault with one who eschews such a thing, nor [can one] verbally abuse [such a person]. He who speaks disdainfully of one of the rabbis or of one of the cherished and widely consulted books of their faith or who leaves aside an authoritative tradition while meeting with other Jews should be punished for this.

On the matter of the Book of the ^phar The followers of Ish?q say that it is one of the books that is relied upon in their religion and the followers of al-Q?fih say that it contains matters that negate God's unicity and His attributes.

On the contrary, one could leave it aside and his avoidance of it would not make him blameworthy, nor would it link him to unbelief. Rather, he [may] go in the direction his belief leads him. At that point the followers of al-Q?fih postponed their being satisfied with the aforementioned book and they said that they would not be satisfied with it unless [his] Noble Presence ordered that there not be a single objection or denial from one of them against any other in this matter ([i.e.] even if some of their scholars viewed the contents of this book as being unreliable). This was not objectionable [to the imam]. He who harbored a disagreement with what [Im?m Yahy?] said or a desire to challenge what he wrote [on this matter] would be punished.

We knew some of what was said concerning the Book of the ?ohar, that is, that it contradicted what was in the Torah, but this contradiction was not immediately apparent (ra'san), as we explained it to those present and as they themselves admitted. Then we examined what would prevent discord and put an end to the feud between them with diligence and with care for that which must be taken into account in terms of their adhering to conduct in line with what the pious ancestors did in the past?this they must take into account, as well as their being shown respect by the Muslims, as happened in past generations. What was established, whose observance was agreed to by those present in the Noble Place, was that no one plot any infringement while suppos ing that it was in keeping with the religion of Moses and that him who persists in his opposition is worthy of punishment and that [one] was forbidden from disagreeing in a way that would transgress the noble [religion] of the Hanifs, whether reluctantly or willfully. [They also agreed that] what should be read in their synagogues and academies is that which Yahy? Ish?q reads of that which is not an innovation (ghayr muhdath). And as for that which Yahy? Ish?q reads which is not an innovation, al-Q?fih, al-Abyad, and their followers should read it and teach it. [And they agreed that] none of the Jews would change the distinguishing marks by which they are known. He forbade the removal of sidelocks, shaving of beards, or such things as would change their normal appearance. [They also agreed that] the third judge, the son, the learned man, the pillar, would go with the Jewish officials (cuqq?l)72 and trustworthy men of the administration and police force chosen by the government to the Jews' neighborhood to see the five synagogues which were claimed to be new: The house of al-Q?fih, the house of Yahy? Ish?q, the house of Y?suf Pinhas, the house of Shary?n, and the house of Hayim Qorah. If the claim that they were new proved to be correct, they all must be destroyed. If they do not look like synagogues (ghayr hay'at al-kanais) they should be vacated and returned to their status as normal houses for residents of the neighborhood, along with the seizure of the documents 71 "The pillar" (al-Hm?d) is the standard nickname in Yemen for a man named Yahy?. 12 The term "ciqiF ("knower") possesses a range of meanings in Yemeni Jewish usage, from the Arabic equivalent of "nasi", the leader of Yemeni Jewry, to a more humble equiva lent to "synagogue leader" or "cantor".

[It was agreed] that the school of S?lim S?lih, where al-Q?fih [taught], would be vacated and that if one of them wished to study an area of knowledge that was unconnected to their religion, like speaking and writing Arabic or Turkish, arithmetic, and the like, there would be nothing to prevent them. [It was agreed that] the teaching should take place in the normal places without any change to their familiar customs of education and teaching. [It was agreed that] their learned men would meet to study in the synagogue of Bayt S?lih, as has been their custom. Whenever a dispute arises among them, its merit should be adjudged according to Yahy? Ish?q's knowledge and that of two other cuqq?l chosen by the two sides. That over which they disagree should be resolved according to the manner of the side to which Yahy? Ish?q belongs. If that is not satisfactory, they should bring up their matter to the sharVa court, where the judge will rule between them according to the dictates of Mohammedan law. He forbade each camp and each individual from verbal abuse, vilification, loose talk, and that which causes divisiveness and contention. He forbade [Jewish] women from getting dressed up and mixing with strange men?Muslims and others?and from wearing the robes known among them as "shuqaq" when they leave their houses. The matter of him who commits a reprehensible act (munkar) should be brought to the third judge by their c?qil, Yahy? Ish?q, so that he may determine what the law demands of [the defendant] after the investigation of the act on the part of the judge. By relying on what he said [here] their circumstances will be peaceful and their living conditions will improve. Al-Abyad and al-Q?fih should continue to receive the sum that they received before the outbreak of the controversy.73 The date is 13 Rabiah II, 1332 [March 10, 1914] and on the top is the noble Mutawakkilite seal (may God extend his victory and his might) [and this document] was taken from the original, in word and in meaning, without any addition or subtraction on 18 Dh? 1-Qacdah 73 Yahya al-Abyad ran the imam's mint.
