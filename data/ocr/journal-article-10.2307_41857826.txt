<plain_text><page sequence="1">Quest for Identity: The I-Thou Imbroglio in Tayeb Salih's Season of Migration to the North Joseph John and Yosif Tarawneh Tayeb Salih's novel Season of Migration to the North deals with, among other things, one of the most persistent themes in modern literature, the problem of identity. A major theme in Conrad, Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, Faulkner and others among the most significant modern novelists, the problem of identity has, in the Western novel, been generally presented as a self-other confrontation between the individual and society- an uneven confrontation from which the individual tends to emerge rather badly bruised. In certain novels, on the other hand, the self-other confrontation is presented as an I-Thou confrontation between one individual and another, rather than as a confrontation between an individual and society as a whole. Thus in some of Conrad's novels- in Heart of Darkness and The Secret Sharer , for instance - this self-other confrontation is presented in the form of an I-Thou encounter between the narrator and an enigmatic pseudo-protagonist whose function, in effect, turns out to be that of being a means to an end: a means whereby the narrator, who is the de facto protagonist, attains self-knowledge and, through it, identity or selfhood. It is such an I-Thou encounter between the narrator (the real protagonist) and Mustafa Sa'eed (the pseudo-protagonist) that constitutes the major theme of Tayeb Salih's Season of Migration to the North. Our thesis is that a perceptive reading of Season in terms of the roles of Mustafa Sa'eed and the narrator, should make it clear that the novel is essen- tially, though not exclusively, the story of the narrator who, returning as a naive young man of twenty-five to his native village in Sudan after seven years of study abroad, encounters what might be called the "Mustafa Sa'eed phenomenon." As a result of this encounter, which constitutes a confrontation as much with himself as with Mustafa Sa'eed, the narrator evolves eventually into a mature, integrated individual possessed of a reconstituted self capable of facing the realities of a fast-changing world. To date, critical studies of Season have generally tended to consider the novel as mainly the story of Mustafa Sa'eed, thus regarding him as the protagonist and construing the role of the narrator as a secondary one. One Joseph John and Yosif Tawarneh are members of the English Department, University of Yarmouk, Irbid, Jordan. ASQ Volume 8 Number 2 161</page><page sequence="2">1 62 Arab Studies Quarterly argument, for instance, claims that all the figures in Season , including the narrator himself, are mere extensions, facets, or reflections of the composite figure of Mustafa Sa'eed.1 Other studies have been devoted to commentaries on Sa'eed's multi-dimensional character.2 Still others have perceived the whole novel as Tayeb Salih's complex and challenging response to the North's imperialist domination over the South in general and over Sudan in particular.3 These studies have generally polarized debate around certain questions of crucial importance and have contributed substantially to the elucidation of the novel. The fact remains, however, that the narrator, who gives shape and substance to the vision embodied in Season and whose complex attitude toward, and mounting interest in, Mustafa Sa'eed occupy the whole novel, has not received due critical recognition as the novel's real protagonist.4 Indeed, the most prominent feature of the novel is the narrator's steadily deepening encounters with Mustafa Sa'eed, encounters dramatized as confrontations between two active centers of consciousness interfaced within the ulterior frame of the narrator's own supervening and retrospective consciousness. The whole novel is, in fact, a recapitulation by the narrator of the part played by the "Sa'eedian" phenomenon in his moral education. In order to understand fully the thematic significance of the encounters between the narrator and Mustafa Sa'eed, it is important for us to know what kind of a man the narrator is at the time of these encounters. Like the nameless narrator of Conrad's The Secret Sharer , the narrator of Season , when the story begins, is a likely candidate for an identity crisis resulting from circumstantial and psychological causes. Like Conrad's young captain, experiencing a sense of being "somewhat of a stranger"5 to himself and a total stranger to the crew, the narrator of Season , for all his euphoric sentiments about being back home, is somewhat of a stranger to his village because of his prolonged stay in Europe. This sense of strangeness is conveyed not so much through overt statements as through semi-conscious hints that interlace the narrator's joyous utterances. Although his sense of strangeness is disguised by the lyric fervor of his celebration of homecoming in terms of everything being just as it was before he went abroad, there nevertheless are unmistakable hints of his naive unpreparedness for the slightest change that would mar his seven-year-long nostalgic dream of his "small village at the bend of the Nile" (p. I).6 It is significant that what the narrator cherished in his mind during his long absence is not the reality of the village, but his fantasized image of it. During his stay abroad, as he puts it, "I used to treasure within me the image of this little village, seeing it wherever I went with the eye of my imagination" (p. 49). What he was, and is, in love with, then, is the idea of the village, not its people, not its community. This explains his emphasis on the sameness of everything as the main reason for his being so happy to be back in the village. It also explains why the desired sameness is seen as being more manifest in</page><page sequence="3">Season of Migration to the North 1 63 the natural than in the human setting. Speaking, for instance, of the "fog" that rose between him and the people upon his arrival, he says: But the fog cleared and I awoke, on the second day of my arrival, in my familiar bed in the room whose walls had witnessed the trivial incidents of my life in childhood and the onset of adolescence. I listened intently to the wind: that indeed was a sound well known to me, a sound which in our village possessed a merry whispering- the sound of the wind passing through palm trees is different from when it passes through fields of corn. I heard the cooing of the turtle-dove, and I looked through the window at the palm tree standing in the courtyard of our house and I knew that all was still well with life. . . .1 felt not like a storm-swept feather but like that palm tree, a being with a background, with roots, with a purpose. (Pp. 1-2) Understandably, the narrator finds an emotional domicile not so much in the vaunted "life warmth of the tribe" (p. 1) as in the "merry whispering" of the familiar wind, in the long-remembered cooing of the turtle-dove, in the renewed companionship of the palm tree that was the friend of his adolescent years. When, immensely pleased, he says to himself, "Yes, life is good, and the world as unchanged as ever" (p. 2), the truth of the situation is not lost on the reader, who promptly notes that the "sameness" he so fondly celebrates relates less to the village's human milieu than to its natural setting. That a considerable degree of idealizing, together with a consequent inability to view the village matter-of-factly, is involved in the narrator's slightly bemused initial reaction to his homecoming is made clear by two related statements. The first, already quoted, refers to the "fog" that rose between him and the people. It is significant that he attributes the fog to his having "thought so much" (p. 1) about the people during his absence. This fog, which disables him temporarily from having a matter-of-fact view of the village and its people is, in effect, nothing other than the make-believe "image" of the village that he cherished during his stay abroad. In the second of the statements referred to above, the narrator, describing a later home- coming from Khartoum, is significantly emphatic about the absence of an intervening fog: The steamer turns round itself so the engines won't be working against the current. A fairly large gathering of men and women is there to meet it No fog separates them from me this time, for I am coming from Khartoum only, after an absence of no more than seven months. I see them with a matter-of-fact eye. (P. 63) If the emphasis here on "this time," "from Khartoum only," and "no more than seven months" is duly recognized, then the implied reference to the "last time," that is, the occasion of his last homecoming, not from a place so near as</page><page sequence="4">1 64 Arab Studies Quarterly Khartoum but from Europe, and not after an absence of just seven months but after one of seven years, becomes particularly significant, insofar as it both points to, and accounts for, the absence of matter-of-factness in the narrator's perspective upon his return from Europe. It is the absence of matter-of- factness together with his wishful eagerness to have the village conform to his cherished image of it that tempts the narrator to pat himself on the back, so to speak, for life being so "good" and the world being "as unchanged as ever." The child-like naiveté of his outlook on life is hard to miss. The narrator's naiveté is a significant factor in his encounter with Sa'eed. In fact, their encounter proves to be a confrontation between simplicity and sophistication- a simplicity that is hardly aware of itself, and a sophistication that masquerades as rustic affability. If life, for the narrator, is good simply because the world has not changed, then from the start he is in for a jolt, however mild it may seem. We soon see (as he does too) that the world is not altogether unchanged- not the world of the village, at any rate. There has indeed been one significant change, one fraught with fateful consequences for the narrator. He notices a new face among those who come to greet him. His curiosity aroused, he asks his father about the stranger. "That must be Mustafa," his father replies. "Mustafa who?" (p. 2)- that is the question, the crucial question to which the narrator is impelled to seek an answer. His quest for an answer to this question, his consequent encounters with Mustafa Sa'eed and the self-knowledge (and selfhood) he eventually attains through an empathie understanding of Sa'eed as the seemingly antithetical but potentially identical "other," constitutes the basic theme of Tayeb Salih's novel. The question "Mustafa who?" becomes the narrator's primary concern. The information provided by his father amounts to these bare facts: "Mustafa was not a local man but a stranger who had come here five years ago, had bought himself a farm, built à house and married Mahmoud's daughter- a man who kept himself to himself and about whom not much was known" (p. 2). This information, tantalizingly skimpy, serves only to whet the narrator's appetite for more facts about the stranger. Strangely, he cannot abide the fact that, having seen the man, he does not know enough about him. From the gap between seeing and knowing springs a strange and strong curiosity that finds fertile ground in something he shares with Sa'eed: a sense of alienation that, in the narrator's case, detracts considerably from the elation of his tribute to his native village and, in Sa'eed's case, is not altogether eliminated by his seeming assimilation into the outward modalities of life in his adopted village. At the time of his initial encounter with Sa'eed, the narrator, as we have seen, has not yet found himself. Caught between two worlds, East and West, he has not yet found his feet in his native village. He is unsure about himself despite his lip service to the happiness of being home. He is innocent and he is naive, both morally and emotionally. His outlook on the world is simplistic. He is narcissistic. His happiness, as he puts it, is like that of "a child who sees</page><page sequence="5">Season of Migration to the North 1 65 its face in the mirror for the first time" (p. 4). He likens himself to a "seed sown in a field" (p. 5), and he wants "love to flow from [his] heart, to ripen and bear fruit" (p. 5). The imagery here suggests a person who is on the threshold of growth. This growth, as we shall see, will occur through a triple process of initiation, identification, and disengagement: initiation into the realm of formative experience to be found in the world of Mustafa Sa'eed, identification with Sa'eed as the narrator's alter ego reflecting the dark potential within the narrator himself, and eventual disengagement from this involvement in a triumphant resolve to choose life and love and service as against the spiritual moribundity of the Sa'eedian world. The events that lead to the narrator's initiation into the world of Mustafa Sa'eed are significant insofar as they represent an interesting interaction between two mutually inquisitive egotisms, each seeking to probe the other. As this interaction intensifies, the relationship between the two as observer and observed becomes blurred in a haze of reciprocal curiosity (and latent animosity). This, in effect, brings about an unwritten pact of secrecy between the two, thus binding them in a bond of alienation from the village similar to, though less intimate than, the bond of alienation shared by the captain and Leggatt in Conrad's The Secret Sharer. Soon enough we see that the narrator's interest in Sa'eed is not one-sided. Two days after the narrator's arrival, in an apparently coincidental yet significant response to his curiosity, Sa'eed comes to the narrator with a gift of "some of the first fruit" from his field, saying, "I'd also like to get to know you" (p. 7). During this meeting, in which Sa'eed's subtly sardonic comment on the narrator's "doctorate" brings the latter's "rather high opinion of himself' a few pegs down, the narrator finds his head crowded with "numerous questions" about Sa'eed: "Where was he from? Why had he settled in this village? What was he about?" (p. 9). These and other questions revolve in the narrator's head for days until at Mahjoub's party, under the influence of wine, Sa'eed surprises the narrator by reciting English poetry with an "impeccable accent." Assuming now that he must be someone other than the person he claims to be, the narrator later confronts him, demanding that he tell the truth, but Sa'eed thwarts him with the flat denial, "I have nothing to hide" (p. 16). Coming from a man who has everything to hide, this denial bears the stamp of the colossal lie that has been Sa'eed's life. Strangely enough, Sa'eed soon volunteers to tell the narrator his story. Here again we see that the narrator's interest in Sa'eed is not at all one-sided. It seems that Sa'eed, on his part, wants not only "to get to know" the narrator, but to be known by him as well. Thus the narrator's "strange" curiosity receives an equally strange response from the "object" of his curiosity. The narrator himself is intensely aware of the strangeness of his curiosity. "I do not know," he says, "what exactly aroused my curiosity" (p. 3). At any rate, his encounter</page><page sequence="6">1 66 Arab Studies Quarterly with Sa'eed is characterized by an ambivalence that signifies a split in his attitude toward the stranger who made his home in the village during his absence. His curiosity about the stranger involves both sympathy and antipathy- sympathy stemming from a shared sense of alienation, and antipathy deriving from a muted but real rivalry between them as native son and settler. In fact, the attitudes of the narrator and Sa'eed toward each other are governed by the paradoxical pulls of attraction and repulsion operating not so much at the conscious as at the semi-conscious or unconscious level. The psychological complexities involved in such an attitudinal split are spelled out revealingly, in a different context, by Jacques Lacan, according to whom such a split "constitutes the characteristic dimension of analytic discovery and experience; it enables us to apprehend the real, in its dialectical effects, as originally unwelcome. It is precisely through this that the real finds itself, in the subject, to a very great degree the accomplice of the drive."7 The narrator, who in the present case is the subject driven by a curiosity that is focused on the "reality" of Sa'eed, is goaded on by the latter's response, which is tantamount to a complicitous participation in the subject's inquisitive drive. The resulting I-Thou imbroglio thus becomes a symbiosis of unpredictable possibilities for the narrator no less than for Mustafa Sa'eed. What we find here is the beginning of an intuitive I-Thou encounter between the narrator and Mustafa Sa'eed, the former acting as the questing, inquiring "I," and the latter reacting as the observed, analyzed "Thou," the former making a journey, as it were, through Mustafa Sa'eed, the enigmatic and challenging "other" - a journey of self-discovery similar to that made by the young captain through Leggatt in Conrad's The Secret Sharer .8 As other critics have noted,9 an impressive series of intriguing ambiguities inhere in the I-Thou tangle, in which the destinies of the narrator and Mustafa Sa'eed happen to be knotted together by a patently fortuitous, albeit seemingly predestined, concatenation of circumstances. Mustafa Sa'eed's voluntary move toward admitting the narrator into the secret world of his sedulously concealed past is a crucial step toward the symbiotic entanglement of their two selves in a relationship that will involve the narrator in a harrowing initiatory experience that will all but shatter him before he emerges from it with a reintegrated selfhood. Sworn to secrecy and closeted with Sa'eed in the privacy of the latter's home, the narrator is treated to a revealing monologue that takes him on an initiatory tour of Sa'eed's spectacular but seamy past. The intimacy of "secret sharing" that characterizes this rendezvous is reminiscent of the whispering intimacy between the captain and Leggatt in The Secret Sharer. As the narrator listens with rapt attention, Sa'eed unfolds his life story, describing his brilliant school career, the reputation he gained as a child prodigy, the scholarship he won for study at a secondary school in Cairo, the continuation of his studies in England with more academic laurels won, and his</page><page sequence="7">Season of Migration to the North 1 67 varied achievements as scholar, lecturer, writer, and miscellaneous activist. Sa'eed's narrative reveals that he has been, from his childhood, an exceptionally self-centered person, all head and no heart, with a combination of high intellect and emotional dryness that made him less than human. All "wrapped up" in himself, with a "hard cold feeling" in his breast, and with no gratitude at all toward those who helped him, he became a "heartless machine" (p. 28). Sexually, too, he was, so to speak, a prodigy, as revealed by the erotic tremor that he, then a mere child, experienced when Mrs. Robinson greeted him with a motherly embrace at the Cairo railway station. Of this experience he says, "At that moment as I stood on the station platform amidst a welter of sounds and sensations, with the woman's arms round my neck, her mouth on my cheek, the smell of her body- a strange European smell - tickling my nose, her breast touching my chest, I felt- I, a boy of twelve- a vague sexual yearning I had never previously experienced" (p. 25). The precocity of his sexual reaction, adumbrating as it does the dismal saga of sexual indulgence and dissipation that was to be his life in England, offers a perverse proof of Wordsworth's dictum, "The Child is father of the Man"; for the rest of Sa'eed's story concerns his mad pursuit in England of a way of life that was a betrayal of the highest values of his own tradition and a vengefully exaggerated parody of the worst aspects of Western culture. Acting as a self-appointed avenger and redresser of the wrongs inflicted on the South by the North, he went forth, his phallus his conquering sword, on a relentless pursuit of white women, savoring the taste of victory from each sexual conquest. Assuming the role of a gruesome Sudanese Casanova, by cunningly flaunting his exotic charm in the face of English women already bedazzled by the East's allurements, he inveigled them into his bed and wreaked symbolic vengeance on the white despoilers of his nation. Filling his bed night after night with women "from the Salvation Army, Quaker societies and Fabian gatherings" (p. 30), women imbued with religious, cultural, political, or ideological fervor, he cohabited at one time with "five women simultaneously" (p. 35). The story of his sex life in England is, in the last analysis, a grim necrology of the victims of his lust and hate, an elaborate series of obituaries, as it were, of the besotted white women- Ann Hammond, Sheila Greenwood, Isabella Seymour, Jean Morris - who became victims of his seductive charm. Soon after revealing his past to the narrator, Mustafa Sa'eed dies, presumed to have drowned in the Nile flood. Mustafa Sa'eed comes and goes, but the narrator remains, for the novel is the story of the narrator engaged in a process of "soul-making"10 in his native village in the valley of the Nile. If the narrator outlives Sa'eed, Sa'eed outlives his own death in the narrator's consciousness, even as Mark Antony outlives his own death in Cleopatra's memory in Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra .! 1 The "life and death of Mustafa Sa'eed" (p. 64) becomes grist to the narrator's mill of soul-making. What matters, then, is how his exposure to the "Mustafa Sa'eed</page><page sequence="8">1 68 Arab Studies Quarterly phenomenon" affects the narrator-protagonist. The immediate effect is that he moves from the stage of initiation to that of identification. Sa'eed's story, together with his sudden disappearance, induces the narrator to look inward. He goes through a process of self-questioning that generates inward movements suggestive of a growing identification with the Mustafa Sa'eed phenomenon. He asks himself, in words that sound very much like a self- analyzing soliloquy: "Was it likely that what happened to Mustafa Sa'eed could have happened to me? He had said that he was a lie, so was I also a lie?" (p. 49). From "Mustafa who?" of his first encounter with Mustafa to "Was it likely ... ?" is indeed a long way, in psychological terms, and the significance of the distance the narrator has covered in his journey toward Sa'eed is hard to miss. Quite obvious here are the emphatic accents of the narrator's self-probing identification with the deceased Sa'eed, who is fast becoming his internalized existential "other." The question whether what happened to Sa'eed could have happened to himself indicates a brooding awareness and a humble recognition, on the part of the narrator, of a plausible "might-have-been" of his sojourn abroad. Was it possible that, were he placed in the same circumstances as Sa'eed, he would have fallen as Sa'eed did? That this is no idle speculation resulting from the enormous viciousness of Sa'eed's story, but a clear-eyed attempt by the narrator to explore the dark recesses of his own psyche, is evident from the fact that it comes after his "brain cleared and the black thoughts stirred by the story of Mustafa Sa'eed were dispersed" (p. 48). The narrator's question is suggestive of a cathartic identification of himself with the deceased Sa'eed, rather like the "There, but for the grace of God, go I" sense of oneness with the tragic hero putatively felt by the spectator of a tragic play. The question whether he, like Sa'eed, is a lie relates directly to misgivings on his part about what lies behind his own puritanical mask. Unlike Sa'eed, who sowed his wild oats in England with unique egotistic gusto and with a pernicious missionary zeal, the narrator, despite "seven years in the land of hanky-panky," as Wad Rayyes puts it (p. 80), has not known in the Biblical sense a single "infidel" woman. In light of the libidinous stirrings initiated in his otherwise prudish consciousness by Sa'eed's tale of sexual profligacy, is he a lie, a hypocrite? This is an honest question, and it relates singularly to the experience described below: Passing by Wad Rayyes's low-lying house at the bend of the lane, I saw a dim light coming from the small window, and heard his wife give a cry of pleasure. I felt ashamed at having been privy to something I shouldn't have been: it wasn't right of me to stay awake wandering round the streets while everyone else was asleep in bed. (P. 47) His mind full of Sa'eed's infidel women and their loose sexual mores, the narrator surprises himself not only by listening with erotic excitement to the</page><page sequence="9">Season of Migration to the North 1 69 love play of Wad Rayyes and his wife, but also by indulging in unrestrained visualizations of their love-making: "I remembered the picture that Mustafa Sa'eed had depicted, remembered it with the same feeling of embarrassment as came to me when I overheard the love play of Wad Rayyes with his wife: two thighs, opened wide and white" (p. 48). The impression that the narrator is becoming increasingly less inhibited toward matters of sex is further reinforced by his uninhibited description of what might be called a "seminar" on sex and related matters. This takes place in his grandfather's house, with Wad Rayyes extolling the pleasures of fornication and expatiating, with singular panache, on the relative amatory merits of females of different tribes and nationalities, and with Bint Majzoub, the much-married village Wife of Bath, unabashedly and with Kamasutra-like expertise regaling her male interlocutors with spicy pronouncements on the nuances of love-making. More importantly, it is the effect of his "Mustafa Sa'eed experience" on the narrator's repressed feelings for Hosna Bint Mahmoud, Sa'eed's widow, that opens up for him new avenues to self-knowledge. Wad Rayyes's announcement of his desire to marry Hosna has a traumatic effect on the narrator precisely because of the state of mind induced in him by Sa'eed's salacious revelations. The unconscious nature of the forces at work here is indicated by the narrator's own surprise at the vehemence of his reaction. "I felt," he says, "real anger, which surprised me for such things are commonly done in the village" (p. 86). His anger is raised to an astonishingly high pitch by his grandfather's stout defense of Wad Rayyes's purpose. "Anger checked my tongue," he says, "and I kept silent" (p. 86). However, the anger thus repressed divulges its true source through shockingly erotic fantasies that reveal the narrator's subliminal passion for Hosna- a passion that vaguely harks back to childhood memories of her as "a wild young girl" who "used to swim naked" in the river with him and his friend Mahjoub. This passion now begins to surface to the conscious level under the more favorable circumstance of Sa'eed's death and, more particularly, under the provocative challenge of Way Rayyes's senile infatuation with (as the narrator later puts it) "the only woman I have ever loved" (p. 141). The riot of "savage" rage and erotic imaginings induced by Wad Rayyes's nefarious intent is depicted thus: The obscene pictures sprang simultaneously to my mind, and, to my extreme astonishment, the two pictures merged: I imagined Hosna Bint Mahmoud, Mustafa Sa'eed's widow, as being the same woman in both instances: two white, wide-open thighs in London, and a woman groaning before dawn in an obscure village on a bend of the Nile under the weight of the aged Wad Rayyes. If that other thing was evil, this too was evil, and if this was like death and birth, the Nile flood and the wheat harvest, a part of the system of the universe, so too was that. I pictured Hosna Bint Mahmoud, Mustafa Sa'eed's widow, a woman in her thirties,</page><page sequence="10">1 70 Arab Studies Quarterly weeping under seventy-year-old Wad Rayyes The rage in my breast grew more savage. Unable to remain, I left; behind me I heard my grandfather calling but I did not turn round. (P. 87) Hosna Bint Mahmoud is an important part of the Mustafa Sa'eed phenomenon. Her unwitting influence on the narrator's psyche is an extension of Mustafa Sa'eed's impact on him. Significantly, this impact keeps increasing instead of decreasing after Sa'eed's death. Just as Caesar is more powerful dead than alive in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar , even so Sa'eed dead turns out to be more powerful than Sa'eed alive, exerting a strong influence on the narrator's psychic life. As the narrator puts it, "Mustafa Sa'eed died two years ago, but I still continue to meet up with him from time to time" (p. 50). He goes on to say, "I lived for twenty-five years without having heard of him or seen him; then, all of a sudden, I find him in a place where the likes of him are not usually encountered. Thus Mustafa Sa'eed has, against my will, become a part of my world, a thought in my brain, a phantom that does not want to take itself off' (p. 50). The narrator's chance meeting, on a train journey, with a retired Ma'mur, a former classmate of Mustafa Sa'eed, and his unexpected involvement in a discussion about Sa'eed in the house of a young Sudanese college lecturer in Khartoum, confirm his fear that he is being pursued by Sa'eed's phantom. At the lecturer's house, listening to inaccurate versions of the Mustafa Sa'eed legend, and intimately, though inexplicably, concerned with the truth about his "alter ego," the narrator involuntarily reels off an itemized inventory of the few and simple worldly goods that comprised Sa'eed's modest bequest to his wife and children. This he does in response to the lecturer's yarn about Sa'eed being "now a millionaire living like a lord in the English countryside" (p. 56). While the lecturer's question, "Are you his son?" (asked, as the narrator realizes, without knowing why he asked it) elicits no answer from the narrator, it does make him reflect: "So, in an instant outside the boundaries of time and place, things appear to him too as unreal. Everything seems probable. He too could be Mustafa Sa'eed's son, his brother, or his cousin. The world in that instant, as brief as the blinking of an eyelid, is made up of countless probabilities, as though Adam and Eve had just fallen from Paradise" (p. 57). Not caring to answer the question negatively, as might be expected, the narrator, looking inward and outward beyond the immediate context, seeks a more truthful answer in philosophical and metaphysical speculations about mankind's common culpability as Adam's progeny and about the countless possibilities of mutual kinship devolving upon individual selves from the universal fount of human destiny. Later, the narrator expresses this sense of the universal commonalty of the human lot in more emotional, if less philosophical, terms: The world goes on whether we choose for it to do so or in defiance of us. And I,</page><page sequence="11">Season of Migration to the North 1 71 like millions of mankind, walk and move, generally by force of habit, in a long caravan that ascends and descends, encamps, and then proceeds on its way. Life in this caravan is not altogether bad The going may be hard by day, the wilderness sweeping out before us like shoreless seas; we pour with sweat, our throats are parched with thirst, and we reach the frontier beyond which we think we cannot go. Then the sun sets, the air grows cool and millions of stars twinkle in the sky. We eat and drink and the singer of the caravan breaks into song. (P. 6 1) The awareness, expressed in these words, of human solidarity (a major theme in Conrad too), is even more feelingly expressed in the desert scene where, lying under a "beautiful, compassionate sky," the narrator finds himself feeling that "we are all brothers; he who drinks and he who prays and he who steals and he who commits adultery and he who fights and he who kills. The source is the same. No one knows what goes on in the mind of the Divine" (p. 1 12). These words express a mystique of mankind vaguely reminiscent of the theophanic anthropomorphism of mystics like Jalaludin Rumi; but they reflect no more than a passing mood that looks back to the naive idealism of the narrator's early days in the village after his return from abroad - an idealism which, at that time, found expression in such glib personal shibboleths as "I want love to flow from my heart, to ripen and bear fruit." That this idealism has not yet struck root in a mature understanding of himself and the world is evidenced by the continual shifts in the narrator's world-view according to the mood of the moment, so that at times he seems to be blowing hot and cold in the same breath. For instance, during the desert journey, speaking of the "merciless" sun and the "cruelty of nature," he moans, "This is the land of despair and poetry but there is nobody to sing" (p. 1 1 0); yet, not long after, when the light of the sun is like "henna on a woman's foot," he waxes eloquent with joy and hope: "This is the land of poetry and the possible. . (p. 1 12). These shifting moods bespeak a crisis of consciousness caused by his growing identification with Mustafa Sa'eed and, more particularly, by the shattering impact on him of Hosna's death. The precariousness of his as yet untested idealism is soon seen in his behavior after Hosna's death. News of her suicide brings about a mental and moral upheaval that completely alienates him from others, inducing in him an existential angst that embitters his attitude towards his village and towards himself. He who once proudly asserted his "belongingness" in the village against Sa'eed's "alienness" is now obliged to admit: "There is no room for me here. Why don't I pack up and go" (p. 1 30). He who returned from abroad "with a great yearning for my [italics ours] people" (p. 1), is now obliged to speak, rather like an outsider, of "these people" (p. 130), whose ways of thinking are so unlike his own. He whose creed of happiness once centered on the naive assumption that the world was "as unchanged as ever," is now forced bitterly to acknowledge, "Yet the world has changed" (p. 1 30). He who</page><page sequence="12">1 72 Arab Studies Quarterly once boasted about his deep roots in the village and its age-old traditions now feels uprooted, and is compelled to ask himself, "Where, then, were the roots that struck down into times past" (p. 1 34). And, worst of all, he who, upon his return to his native village, dreamed of a life that would be enriched by love ("I want love to flow from my heart") is brought to a blatant repudiation of love and friendship in an irrational fight with his life- long friend Mahjoub, whom he nearly kills in his murderous fury. Having thus been brought to abjure the basic tenet of his idealism, having lost his sense of belonging within his own community, and being sadly disoriented from life itself, the narrator has arrived at a state of mind that is a sine qua non for total identification with his alter ego, Mustafa Sa'eed. The mental turmoil and the painful self-analysis that follow his fight with Mahjoub are expressed in words that, once again, bear the heavy accents of an anguished soliloquy: The world has turned suddenly upside down. Love? Love does not do this. This is hatred. I feel hatred and seek revenge; my adversary is within and I needs must confront him. Even so, there is still in my mind a modicum of sense that is aware of the irony of the situation. I begin from where Mustafa Sa'eed had left off. (F. 134) Here the narrator's identification with Sa'eed becomes complete. Here is a merger of identities, however ambiguous, however confused. Particularly remarkable is the narrator's assimilation of some of the moral proclivities of Mustafa Sa'eed. Instead of loving, he has begun to "feel hatred and seek revenge" as Sa'eed used to do. And he lapses into a solipsism not unlike, though not so vicious as, Sa'eed's egotism. His world, as he puts it, "had contracted, had withdrawn upon itself, until I myself had become the world, no world existing outside of me" (p. 134). Thus transformed into a living extension of the deceased Sa'eed, thus beginning "from where Sa'eed had left off," as he stands before the door of the "rectangular room" that is the earthly abode of Sa'eed's "ghost," he nervously defines his confused identity: "I am the guardian, the lover, and the adversary" (p. 135). This definition at once signalizes his troubled "Hosna fixation" and highlights his growing conception of Sa'eed as both his "double" and his adversary. This three-fold definition of himself as guardian, lover, and adversary denotes not merely a confusion of identity, but a temporary lack of identity. Indeed, it is a signal that Mustafa Sa'eed has at last taken over. Ironically, "I begin from where Mustafa Sa'eed had left off' implies an ontic switch, whereby the questing self becomes lost in the analyzed "other." The "takeover" by Sa'eed's spirit has been made possible by the gradual infiltration into the narrator's mind of some of Sa'eed's cardinal vices- egotism, hatred, vindictiveness. Here the I-Thou imbroglio becomes a veritable Gordian knot, which the narrator must cut with his "spirit's knife" in</page><page sequence="13">Season of Migration to the North 173 order to free himself from bondage to the "phantom that does not want to take itself off," the phantom that has pursued him from place to place and is now at once within him and without, at once his alter ego and his adversary. This is the context in which the narrator's journey of self- discovery becomes a going through the Sa'eedian "other": in effect, a journey through himself. This is the meaning of the dramatic confrontation that occurs in the "rectangular room"- a confrontation as crucial and as ominous as that of Marlow with Kurtz in Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The narrator's enactment of this confrontation symbolically externalizes it in a mirror image of multiple significations: I turned the key in the door, which opened without difficulty. I was met by dampness and an odour like that of an old memory. I know this smell: the smell of sandalwood and incense. I felt my way with my finger-tips along the walls and came up against a window pane. I threw open the window and the wooden shutters. I opened a second window and a third, but all that came in from outside was more darkness. I struck a match. The light exploded on my eyes and out of the darkness there emerged a frowning face with pursed lips that I knew but could not place. I moved towards it with hate in my heart. It was my adversary Mustafa Sa'eed. The face grew a neck, the neck two shoulders and a chest, then a trunk and two legs, and I found myself standing face to face with myself. This is not Mustafa Sa'eed- it's a picture of me frowning at my face from a mirror. (P. 135) One of the high points of the novel, and probably one of the most intensely dramatic enactments in modern fiction of a nightmarish crescendo of the quest for identity, is to be found in this baffling "shadow-play" of shifting identities, acted out in tandem by the darkly linked selves of the living narrator and the dead Mustafa Sa'eed. The narcissistic implications of the mirror image with its ambivalent relevance to the venal egoism of the narrator and the Gargantuan egocentrism of Mustafa Sa'eed point not only to the complex nature of the confrontation, but also to the hazards to which the narrator becomes exposed. The question now is: Will the as yet unlaid ghost of Mustafa Sa'eed inhabiting the narrator's consciousness like an incubus of vice and corruption prevail over his mind and heart? Or will the narrator be able to disengage himself from its baleful sway in a triumphant discovery of his true identity, through a final realignment of his psychic forces with the benign properties of his higher self? The answer to this question, which constitutes the moral crux of the novel, is provided by the narrator's clear-eyed and unflinching confrontation with the full enormity of the Sa'eedian menace to his integrity. With masterful self-possession, he identifies and confronts, one by one, the evil aspects of Sa'eed's character, commemorated in the rectangular room by memorabilia from Sa'eed's infamous past. He learns with dismay that Sa'eed was no</page><page sequence="14">1 74 Arab Studies Quarterly repentant sinner but a crypto-voluptuary who, while living an outwardly unimpeachable life in the village, had at the same time vicariously relived his hedonistic past. Baffled and incensed by the discovery, he asks himself, "Was this the action of a man who wanted to turn over a new leaf?" (p. 136). One by one he comes across pictures of Sa'eed's women victims, displayed as trophies memorializing his sexual triumphs. It is as though the narrator was "revisiting" their tragic fates as part of his confrontation with their arch- victimizer. And, most instructive of all, he is disgusted by an exhibition of Sa'eed's egomania in a variety of pictorial manifestations: I went up to the photographs ranged on the shelf: Mustafa Sa'eed laughing; Mustafa Sa'eed writing; Mustafa Sa'eed swimming; Mustafa Sa'eed somewhere in the country; Mustafa Sa'eed in gown and mortar-board; Mustafa Sa'eed rowing on the Serpentine; Mustafa Sa'eed in a Nativity play, a crown on his head, as one of the Three Kings who brought perfumes and myrrh to Christ; Mustafa Sa'eed standing between a man and a woman. (Pp. 138-39) The narrator's minor egoism quails before its own potential enormity as prefigured by Sa'eed's limitless egocentrism. His reaction is something like Marlow's reaction to Kurtz's supreme egotism in Heart of Darkness: You should have heard him say, "My ivory." Oh, yes, I heard him. "My Intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my ... " everything belonged to him. It made me hold my breath in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal of laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places. Everything belonged to him- but that was a trifle. The thing was to know what he belonged to, how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own. That was the reflection that made you creepy all over.12 As with Marlow, so with the narrator of Season. The problem now is one of separating judgment from identification. A decisive attitudinal dissociation is an essential step toward disengagement from the seductive "double" who represents one's darker self. As Marlow discovers his higher self by knowing and dealing with his darker self externalized in his Kurtzian alter ego, so the narrator of Season discovers his higher self by knowing and dealing with his darker self externalized in his Sa'eedian double. This is a victory for the "knower," and it is such a victory - resulting from his judgmental abjuration of the Mustafa Sa'eed phenomenon - that the narrator describes in this passage: I became bored with reading the bits of paper. No doubt there were many more bits buried away in this room, like pieces in an arithmetical puzzle, which Mustafa Sa'eed wanted me to discover and to place side by side and so come out with a composite picture which would reflect favourably upon him. He wants to</page><page sequence="15">Season of Migration to the North 1 75 be discovered, like some historical object of value. There was no doubt of that, and I now know that it was me he had chosen for that role. It was no coincidence that he had excited my curiosity and had then told me his life story incompletely so that I myself might unearth the rest of it. It was no coincidence that he had left me a letter sealed with red wax to further sharpen my curiosity, and that he had me made guardian of his two sons so as to commit me irrevocably, and that he had left me the key to this wax museum. There was no limit to his egoism and his conceit; despite everything, he wanted history to immortalize him. But I do not have the time to proceed further with this farce. I must end it before the break of dawn and the time now was after two in the morning. At the break of dawn tongues of fire will devour these lies. (F. 1 54) Here the narrator describes his determination to no longer be manipulated by the posthumous egotistic designs of Mustafa Sa'eed. He will have no truck with his sinister alter ego, much as he knows that his new-found self- knowledge derives directly from his dauntless encounter with that alter ego's puissant presence both within and without. The I-Thou imbroglio is thus resolved, and the narrator, whose journey of self-discovery constitutes the theme of the novel, has at last found himself. Even as Marlow journeys through the Kurtzian darkness without getting bogged down in the primeval mire of Kurtz's self-created "evildom," so the narrator of Season comes through the Sa'eedian moral wilderness without being bamboozled by the false gleam of glamorized self- worship. Having laid the ghost of Mustafa Sa'eed with the naked truth of his new- found identity (not "with a lie" as Marlow laid the ghost of Kurtz), the narrator, determined not to participate any more in Sa'eed's "egolatrous" charade, leaves the sepulchral sanctuary of Sa'eed's ego-cult and enters the Nile "naked as when my mother bore me" (p. 166) in a symbolic return to the primeval womb. Floating on the waters of the Nile "halfway between north and south," suspended in a state of quiescent animation between sleeping and waking, seeing and unseeing, he submits unthinkingly, unconditionally to "the destructive forces of the river," only to find himself buoyed up by the benign "Nilus" so that he might behold "the shore rising and falling." An aching desire for a cigarette wakes him from the "nightmare" and suddenly, as he puts it, "my mind cleared and my relationship to the river was determined. Though floating on the water, I was not part of it" (p. 168). While, on the literal level, this statement denotes a sudden awareness of the need to strive for survival, at the symbolic level it is a re-enactment of his disengagement, his final liberation, from the ghost of Mustafa Sa'eed, laid to rest for ever in the rectangular room. It is important to note that the river episode forms a richly symbolic finale to the narrator's moral pilgrimage. His final cry, "Help! Help!" is a resounding repudiation of the Sa'eedian world of death; it is his everlasting "yes" to life. Every moral insight with which the narrator credits himself in his last words,</page><page sequence="16">1 76 Arab Studies Quarterly is a new- won wisdom that contrasts with the Sa'eedian "unwisdom" that he has, through much travail, learned to overcome. Particularly significant is his proud assertion: "All my life I had not chosen, had not decided. Now I am making a decision. I choose life" (p. 168). These words recall a similar statement by Mustafa Sa'eed about his early life. Speaking of his decision, as a child, to join a school - a decision made without consulting his mother- Sa'eed says, "This was a turning-point in my life. It was the first decision I had taken of my own free will" (p. 21). Each makes his own decision and for each it is a "turning-point," but the important question is: Turning in what direction? In Sa'eed's case, his decision, actuated solely by egotistic ambition, led him on a reckless course of self-destruction; in the narrator's case, the decision to "choose life"- his first free choice as a man- promises to lead him to a future enriched by fruitful participation in the life of others. The narrator's reason for choosing life- "because there are a few people I want to stay with for the longest possible time and because I have duties to discharge" (p. 168) - implies a newly gained moral enlightenment, an other-directed rather than a self-directed consciousness, a mature altruism that has replaced the naive idealism of his earlier days. The narrator has thus not only found himself, he has also found his telos - a meaning and purpose to life. The world has changed and he himself has changed, but life is "good" because love has been restored, faith found, hope gained, and there is ground under his feet - the ground of all the earth. He has found a teleological home in an enduring sense of fellowship with all men everywhere. It takes great strength, however perverse, to destroy oneself. Mustafa Sa'eed had this strength, and he demonstrated it with dazzling insouciance and with a bravado that seemed to taunt fate itself. But it takes a greater strength (less dazzling perhaps and more meek) to mold one's self out of the ruins of a monumental alter ego, from the embers of a "ghoul" ravished by a "phoenix" (p. 155). The narrator-protagonist of Tayeb Salih's Season , in the end, possesses this unique strength, and he demonstrates it with a wondrous plenitude of poetry and purpose as he emerges from his baptismal immersion in the life-giving waters of the immemorial Nile.

In this highly competent article, which nevertheless, as the title indicates, is in the nature of a general interpretation, the author ascribes the rank of "hero" to the narrator, but she is more concerned with the narrator's symbolic "re-enactment" of what she calls the "three dialectical stages" in East-West relations, than with substantiating his claims to the rank of "hero." We, the present authors, seek to establish that the narrator is the protagonist of Season by trying to prove, with evidence drawn from the text, that the novel is basically the story of the narrator's own moral education through his encounter with what we call "the Mustafa Sa'eed phenomenon." 5.
