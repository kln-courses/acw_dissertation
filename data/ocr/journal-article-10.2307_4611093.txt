<plain_text><page sequence="1">theatre of wonder: the children of paris BY ARTHUR HOLMBERG A fter viewing some paintings by children, Picasso exclaimed, "Once I drew like Raphael, but it has taken me a lifetime to draw like a child." For Picasso, drawing like a child meant giving free rein to the primitive energy, the spontaneous creation, and the unself-con- scious playfulness that infuse children's art with its power and its charm. In Paris recently the theater has also turned to the world of the child for inspiration. After having passed through the theater of the absurd and le theatre panique, the theater of silence and of phantasmagoria, le theatre blitz, and all the well-known excesses of the fashionable French directors, the most interesting current trend on Parisian stages is to imitate the genres and techniques associated with children. Some of these vanguard movements changed the course of Western theater; others proved to be transitory flashes of inspiration or exercises in self-destruction. With a resolute determination to be new and daring at all costs came self-consciousness and strain. In seeking inspiration in the abandon and exuberance of children, the French theater is now trying to recapture the sense of joy and wonder we associate with make-believe. The stage has become a playroom, the theater a playhouse. A case in point is the first production of the complete version of Paul Claudel's Le Soulier de satin. Many critics consider Claudel, a disconcerting admixture of worldly diplomat, devout Christian, and literary genius, the finest French poet of the twentieth century and Le Soulier de satin his greatest play. Given its Wagnerian stature - the uncut text would run for nine hours - no producer had dared ask an</page><page sequence="2">134 the antioch review audience to sit through it. In former productions the fourth act has usually been deleted, except for the final scene attached as an epilogue. In Jean-Louis Barrault's new presentation, which lasts for over six and one-half hours, every act is given, albeit minor cuts have been made in some scenes. It is the first opportunity one has had to judge the drama on the stage in its entirety. The play explores the bitter love of a sixteenth-century Spanish conquistador, Don Rodrigue, and a married woman, Dona Prouheze. With a troubled and restless spirit, Don Rodrigue sets out to conquer an empire for his king, but in the process of spiritual growth sparked by a physical desire that can find no earthly satisfaction, he discovers that the only real victory is a conquest of the self. "The play," Barrault commented, "deals with the search for a total and absolute love." The scene of the play? The entire world, and the constant shifts in setting, decor, and tone startle and bewilder. The vast drama - enacted by forty players and ten musicians at a number of different acting stations - is an unwieldy masterpiece that always threatens to careen out of control. It combines aspects of tragedy, romantic mel- odrama, farce, opera (Honegger wrote the music), vaudeville, his- torical drama, and fairy tales into a sprawling and nervous work of pure theatricality. What finally holds the amorphous and polyphonic play together is the unit of Claudel's vision and the splendor of his poetry. The epigraph of the play- "God writes straight with crooked lines" could also be applied to the author. Creating a new type of verse le vers pneumatique - inspired by his readings in Walt Whit- man, the playwright tried to capture the pulse of the heartbeat and the rhythm of human respiration. The result is the most beautiful language heard on the French stage since Racine. Scenes such as the final leave- taking of Rodrigue and Prouheze reach such dramatic and lyrical in- tensity that one surrenders to a joy beyond sorrow. Madeleine Renaud assumed the role of Rodrigue's mother, Dona Honoria. Eighty-odd years old, she remains the youngest actress in France and has reached a point in her art where all technique vanishes. Whatever she says sounds so natural and so simple that it speaks directly to the heart. In the movie Harold and Maude she plays an octogenarian who inspires l'amour-passion in a lad of nineteen. Ra- diating such vitality and beauty, Mme Renaud makes the situation not merely believable but inevitable. It is impossible not to fall in love with her. Barrault's production of Le Soulier de satin emphasized its fairy-</page><page sequence="3">theatre of wonder 135 tale quality through decor and design. Sets, costumes, and tableaux were inspired by the illustrations in children's books, and props seemed like overgrown toys: a large, inflated whale, which suddenly appeared in the middle of the stage spouting water; three large puppet goldfish that shimmied to the undulating, sinuous rumba of Jobarbara, the slave girl who danced a prayer of thanksgiving to the Virgin Mary for having made her "so black and so beautiful"; two sixteenth-century Spanish gentlemen encapsulated in a toy boat and imitating the tossings and turnings of an ocean storm through mime. One of the funniest scenes occurred on the royal barge in the presence of the Spanish king. The nobles were represented, not by actors, but by life-size hand puppets dressed like El Greco's cavaliers. At every word of the king, the grandees shook their heads so rapidly and so mechanically that they finally got seasick. The empty-headed dummies scored a point about courting political favor that no live actors could have made. Similar flights of fancy into the world of the child also character- ized Zadig, another production in Barrault's repertory. The play, based on a parody of the Arabian Nights by Voltaire, raises the question whether a young man who is handsome, intelligent, virtuous, and rich to boot can find happiness in this, the best of all possible worlds. Victimized by the envy of the less fortunate, Zadig, the in- nocent childlike young man in question, finds himself catapulted into a series of misadventures through which he plumbs the perfidy of man and the infidelity of woman. Philosophy turns out to be a brigand and morality a harlot. Shoved into an absurd and cruel world apparently ruled by a ma- licious fate, Zadig encounters a lonely hermit, played by Jean-Louis Barrault, who turns out to be an angel with a message from heaven: blind chance is providence in disguise. "Men judge everything," the angel admonishes the hero, "without knowing anything." But the angel flies off before Zadig can beg further elucidations. Voltaire's angels never tarry on earth too long. Nonetheless, the story, like all good fairy tales, ends happily. Zadig returns home, is crowned king, and marries the woman he loves. Voltaire demonstrates that a certain amount of happiness is possible in this vale of tears, but only through the patient exercise of public and private virtue. Twelve years later Voltaire, a philosophical gadfly, would rewrite the same story but give it a more sober ending. He called it Candide. Seldom, seldom does one leave the theater with a sense of eu- phoria, but this is exactly what happens after a performance of Zadig.</page><page sequence="4">136 the antioch review The sets and costumes recreated the world of the Shahnameh,the Per- sian book of kings whose illustrations in their use of color and per- spective resemble those of children. In addition, dance and mime were used to convey a sense of the marvelous. In one scene, Barrault himself led an ambush of cutthroats. With hobby-horse heads on their hands and tails girding their waists, the henchmen mimicked the movement of the fiery Arabian steeds to the utter delight of the audience. Mime in Barrault serves many functions: it carries forth the action, it creates character, and it even enhances the emotional environment of the spoken word. But above and beyond all these purposes, it exudes an autonomous exhilaration: the joy of play. The high jinks and horsing- around of children express their pleasure in brute, animal existence. A Persian tale also provided Peter Brook with the framework for The Conference of the Birds, a dramatization of a twelfth-century text written by Farid Uddin Attar, a Sufi poet. Ever since Aristophanes, birds have enjoyed pride of place in the theater's menagerie, and Brook used finely crafted hand puppets to suggest the doves, sparrows, fal- cons, partridges, ducks, owls, bats, herons, parakeets, and other or- nithological species that people the play. With Balinese masks and the music of gong and drum, Brook concocted a theatrical entertainment based on one of mankind's oldest dreams: anthropomorphism. The religious allegory began on a note of discord and bickering in the kingdom of the birds. What are the birds fighting over? "A little patch of earth, a few grains of wheat." In order to find peace and harmony, some of the birds set out on a perilous journey to locate their legitimate ruler, the Simorg. Others, tied to the earth through lassitude, habit, or the lusts of the flesh, stay behind. In the course of the journey, the birds listen to a series of parables that expound spiritual truths. The funniest and richest in Freudian overtones in- volves an extremely retentive miser who hoards gold coins in his anus. In one of the most moving episodes a moth flies into the proverbial flame, and a narrator entitled the "Shower of Shadows" explains that the moth at last "found out what he wanted to know, but now only he knows it." Many of the birds die en route, but those who finally persevere must learn an even more difficult lesson from the august Simorg, who vouchsafes them an existential and mystical truth: to find God they must discover the divine within. The final image shows the birds peering into, not the face of the Simorg, but a full-length mirror. Another excursion into the kingdom of animals was Les Peines</page><page sequence="5">theatre of wonder 137 de coeur d'une chatte anglaise, a play Genevieve Serreau adapted from a short story by Balzac. Donning lifelike, furry masks, the actors transmogrified themselves into stuffed animals that made the audience believe that cats, peacocks, storks, foxes, dogs, and mice not only talk but also share other human vices. "By living with men," exclaims Beauty, a snowball cat and the eponymous heroine, "we pick up all their bad habits." The animal fable is not only one of the staples of children's lit- erature, it is also one of the most venerable forms of social satire, and such scourges as Aesop, Swift, and Orwell have practiced it. Balzac uses the genre to rip the hypocritical mask off polite Victorian society. Beneath the cult of bourgeois respectability he finds nothing but com- mercial greed and the desire to dominate, and he encourages animals and women to rebel against the phallocrats-the current French phrase for male chauvinists. Beauty, the heroine, is destroyed by two male myths - romanti- cized visions of women and what she herself terms the "immoral monopoly of marriage." Only after suffering personal tragedy and social disgrace does she find her true vocation: she becomes a political agitator and writes pamphlets urging women and all beasts of burden to resist their servitude to man. But it would be wrong to reduce the pleasure one derives from this carnival of animals to a simple social message. It is a biting satire, yes. But first and foremost, it is a delicate theatrical collage of sight and sound. The Paris Opera regaled the city with another childlike enchant- ment: a major new production of Ravel's L'Enfant et les sortileges, a musical fantasy with a text by Colette and directed by Jorge Lavelli. Much of the credit for the evening goes to the inspired sets and cos- tumes of Max Bignens, who cunningly combined light and shadow to create shapes and forms that seemed more like a reflection of reality than reality itself. Carefully filtered overhead lights, panels of air- blown lace and gauze walls, and more tonalities of white than one ever knew existed spun together a gossamer mirage, the very stuff of dreams. The tale begins with a naughty boy who refuses to do his home- work and shouts back at his mother. Left alone to sulk, all the objects he has mistreated and broken spring miraculously into angry existence. Inanimate matter, it seems, has a life of its own. The Wedgwood teapot begins its routine by asking in impeccable Oxford English, "How's your mug?" It then launches into a vaudeville number with</page><page sequence="6">138 the antioch review the teacup that frightens, yet mesmerizes the child-hero. The scene shifts to the garden where all the animals the boy has tormented wreak their revenge. The opera, or lyrical fantasy as Colette herself called it, is a parable of socialization and initiation. It is a rite of passage in which the child comes to understand that to grow up means to learn to respect not only other people, but also all creatures, both great and small. It is Colette's allegory of man's relationship to nature and func- tions as a cautionary tale. In order to survive, man must acquire the wisdom to value the objects and forces in the universe that serve him. Arrabal's latest play staged in Paris, La Tour de Babel, can also be viewed as a fantasy for adults. An antirealist extravaganza again directed by Lavelli, the play has large doses of the grotesque and the miraculous, both essential elements of any fairy tale. Although the ostensible subject is the decline and fall of the Spanish Empire, the play really explores the slow destruction of the European soul, frittered away in a mindless pursuit of materialistic progress. As in all his plays, Arrabal shrieks with the impotent rage of an innocent child outraged by the immorality and stupidity of the adult world. At the end the hero and heroine soar into the stratosphere, but only after escaping the spiderwebs of the Common Market, Eurodollars, and multinational corporations. Unless handled with the ultimate in artistic discipline, these fables that evoke the vision of the child could easily become silly or senti- mental. As produced on Parisian stages, however, they are not only whimsical fantasies but also mordant social criticism. Behind this trend lies a desire to renew the theater and transcend the limitations of psychological realism, existential absurdity, simplistic political theater, and the self-serving of most director's theater. These plays do, of course, make psychological, philosophical, political, and aes- thetic points, but they work on the level of the imagination rather than of rational discourse. They are moral without moralizing. They hold lessons but do not preach. Instead of direct statements, these plays employ poetic symbols drawn from the world of the child to convey polyvalent meanings on various levels of consciousness. They pro- voke, stimulate, and liberate by stirring the audience's own imagi- native resources. Furthermore, these plays correspond to an international hunger of the imagination that has manifested itself in the mass success of sci- ence-fiction and fantasy movies, posters, and books. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings appeals to the same need. It is a revolt against</page><page sequence="7">theatre of wonder 139 rational explanations of the universe and a search for a deeper and more humane mode of understanding than can be had through knowl- edge alone. Psychologists have recently pointed out the importance of fantasy in a healthy mental life. Far from being irrelevant, fantasy provides, not an escape from reality, but a means of exploring inner possibilities and a way of organizing experience, information, and emotions into a meaningful pattern. It is an integral part of the human experience. Further, these excursions into fantasy reveal a lingering nostalgia for heroes. Ever since Gilgamesh, the hero, who embodies the aspi- rations and values of his society, has occupied a central position in the Western literary tradition. With the advent of realism in the nine- teenth century, however, heroes have tended to become rarer and rarer. During the past hundred years broken men, minimal beings, and anti- heroes have occupied our stages to such a degree that it would be next to impossible to introduce a hero into a realistic work. Heroes do not live here and now. They lived there and then. But in works of fantasy we can indulge our deep-seated need for heroes who reaffirm our faith in human life. And the language of faith, for adults as well as children, is still the imagination.</page></plain_text>
