THE CARIBBEAN At the 1992 Annual Meeting of the Society for Amer- ican Archaeology in Pittsburgh, David R. Watters (Carnegie Museum of Natural History [CMNH]) or- ganized a symposium and workshop on the "Late Ce- ramic Age in the Northeast Caribbean." About 30 re- searchers conducting research on 12 islands or island groups examined ceramic collections from Puerto Rico and the northern Lesser Antilles. The symposium and workshop allowed researchers to gain hands-on expe- rience with ceramics from other islands, and the ex- ercise promoted a synthetic, regional approach to Ca- ribbean prehistory. This meeting provided a very good model for inter-island and international cooperation that might usefully be followed in other Caribbean regions, especially the Greater Antilles and the Wind- ward Islands. Elizabeth Wing (Florida Museum of Natural History [FMNH]) has continued investigations of plant and animal remains from Caribbean sites as part of the Environmental Archeology program at the FMNH. Samples of animal remains from San Salvador (Three Dog site), Samana Cay (SM-2 and SM-7), Puerto Rico (Ballaja Features 25, 28, 57, Entrada al Morro, Calle Cristo), St. Thomas (Tutu, Magens Bay), Anguilla (Rendezvous Bay), Saba (Kelby's Ridge), Nevis (GE-5 and GE-6), and Barbados (Heywoods) have been iden- tified by Elizabeth Wing, Laura Kozuch, Susan de- France, and Mark Frank. Macrobotanical remains from San Salvador (Three Dog Site), Puerto Rico (Ballaja and Calle Cristo), Haiti (En Bas Saline), and Barbados (Heywoods) were identified by Lee Newsom. These samples add to the growing data base on human ex- ploitation of plant and animal resources in the Carib- bean. The results of these studies are being analyzed and prepared for publication. Richard T. Callaghan and Donna Fremont (Uni- versity of Calgary) continue using computer simulation models to investigate the possibilities for maritime movements of peoples in the Caribbean region. Their research indicates that it would have been easier to travel to the Greater Antilles from South America than from Central America, and that direct travel between Venezuela and Puerto Rico, bypassing the Lesser An- tilles, was possible. Drift voyages from an approxi- 149</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY mately 485-km stretch of the northern South American coast have a .3 percent probability of success, while drift voyages from Isla Mujeres (at Yucatfn's northern tip) have a . 1 percent success rate. They calculate that 90.7 percent of all drift voyages from Key West, Flor- ida, would end in Cuba. Intentional voyages, paddling at average daily speeds up to 3.4 knots, are successful from North, South, and Central America; their success is most probable from Florida, and least probable from Yucatfn. Stephen D. Glazier (University of Nebraska) is work- ing on a book-length treatment of aboriginal religions in the Caribbean, with special attention to the Island Carib. Glazier is interested in receiving information and citations dealing with Carib and Taino religions at the time of European contact. BAHAMAS. Mary Jane Berman (Wake Forest University) conducted excavations for the eighth year at the Three Dog site, San Salvador. The field season was devoted to the ongoing study of the site's structure. Excavations were concentrated away from the midden area, in an area that is possibly a house's interior. Ad- ditional research was directed to the area where a pen- dant-making tool kit was recovered in 1991. Pottery found at the site is predominantly related to the Cuban Arroyo del Palo series. An owl-shaped shell pendant and a nonlocally made rim sherd with punctate-incised applique were also recovered. William Keegan (FMNH) conducted a second sea- son of fieldwork on Grand Turk in January, 1992. At site GT-2 he recovered additional shell beads, bringing the total for the site to more than 1,000, along with drill bits and scrap from bead manufacture. The re- mains of a cooking structure were also exposed. The site has been radiocarbon dated to the early thirteenth century A.D. A third site was discovered on Grand Turk at the northern end of the island. Like the other two sites, it appears to have been a temporary camp. The site contained mixed Palmetto and imported pot- tery, and contained a high frequency of marine turtle bones. GREATER ANTILLES. Jamaica. George P. Lechler (Archaeological Society of Jamaica) carried out emergency salvage excavations on the prehistoric site K-11, Chancery Hall, St. Andrew, Jamaica. The site is five miles from the sea at an elevation of 244 m. Ra- diocarbon determinations suggest a thirteenth-century date. Seven burials were located, one consisting of an adult with a child buried on top, and three ceramic vessels on top of the child. One complete stone zemi, three clay zemis, and fragments of other stone and clay zemis were recovered, as were many petaloid celts of various sizes, amulets, pendants, beads, griddles, etc. Salvage excavations are being carried out by Lechler at the site of Martello Tower (K-6) on the delta of the Hope River, Harbour Head, St. Andrew. The site cov- ers the delta and extends up the river gorge, and con- tains several preceramic and historic components. The site is seriously threatened by development. Puerto Rico. Ricardo E. Alegria (Centro de Estu- dios Avanzados de Puerto Rico y el Caribe) is con- ducting ethnohistorical research on European-Indige- nous relations in the early sixteenth century. He is concentrating on the experiment carried out in 1519 to determine if the Indians were able to coexist with Europeans on the island without Spanish governance. Alegria and the Centro de Estudios Avanzados are also publishing an annotated, analytical edition of Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo's Historia generaly nat- ural de las Indias. Angel Rodriguez Alvarez has been studying the pet- roglyph collection of the Institute of Puerto Rican Cul- ture. Most of the petroglyphs come from the Juganns collection and private donations. The pieces in the Institute's collections are on both igneous and sedi- mentary rocks, with the former coming from ball courts, and the latter primarily from rockshelter walls com- mon in the north-central-coast region of Puerto Rico. Anthromorphs (simple, elaborated or complicated fac- es, and swaddled anthromorphs) make up 99 percent of the motifs in both contexts. Microscopic analyses indicate that the grooves were made by chiseling and chiseling/rubbing. Osvaldo Garcia-Goyco and Jose Mufioz Vfazquez conducted excavations in the historical district (dating to 1573 and later) of the city of San Germfn, Puerto Rico. Several building phases were identified, com- prising brick sewers, streets and plazas paved with river stones, wooden-bridge footings, rough clay and glazed pipes, and the foundations and tracks of the old train station. Glass, metal, ceramics, and bone artifacts have been recovered, dating to the seventeenth through twentieth centuries. LESSER ANTILLES. Irving Rouse (Yale Univer- sity) is studying excavated collections from the Antig- uan sites of Indian Creek and Freeman's Bay, in the context of other excavated collections from the Lesser Antilles. This study, and his participation in the SAA workshop/symposium mentioned above, have moved him to revise the interpretation of the Leeward Islands' ceramic chronology published in his recent book The Tainos (1992). Instead of assigning the post-Saladoid ceramics of the region to the Elenan Ostionoid sub- series, he suggests that the ceramics are more closely related to the Troumassoid series of the Windward Islands, and thus designates the later pottery of the Leeward Islands as Mamoran Troumassoid. White-on- red painting survives in the Mamoran subseries until at least A.D. 1000, long after it disappeared elsewhere in the Caribbean area. White-red-and-black painting (Bullen's Caliviny Polychrome) similarly persists in Troumassan and Suazan. Archaeological survey has been carried out by MAAR Associates on the small island of Hans Lollik, off the north coast of St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. His- torical research and surface reconnaissance have been used to identify the extensive ruins of an early- to mid- eighteenth-century cotton plantation, including a great house, slave quarters, and numerous other architec- tural features. The work was carried out in advance of controlled residential/recreational development. Afri- can Americans on Hans Lollik apparently were able to build houses of non-European designs, and Ted M. Payne, research associate for MAAR Associates, found a number of probable wattle-and-daub-house com- 150 [Vol. 58, No. 1, 1993]</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH plexes scattered about the southern end of the island. These sites contained a mix of European and possibly locally made artifacts and features. Additional histor- ical research by George F. Tyson may take place in the future, along with further archaeological field research. James B. Petersen (University of Maine-Farming- ton), and David R. Watters and James B. Richardson III (CMNH) studied excavated collections from An- guilla, Barbuda, and Montserrat. The analyses will allow the completion of site reports on two sites on Anguilla, six on Barbuda, and several other sites on Montserrat. With the exception of the Trants site on Montserrat, most of the artifacts are attributable to the Late Ceramic Age, ca. A.D. 500-1500. Petersen and Watters also secured additional samples of "Afro-Ca- ribbean" pottery from these islands to broaden their base for distinguishing hand-built prehistoric from his- toric ceramics in the region. On Barbuda, David R. Watters (CMNH), Jack Don- ahue, and Tim Evens (University of Pittsburgh [UP]) conducted research at the Archaic River site (BA-4) and the nearby Strombus line, a paleoshoreline near the southwest margin of the island, to determine whether the shells making up this lithified beach ridge were deposited by natural or cultural processes. The River site (BA-4) consists largely of modified or unmodified Strombus shells, with no evidence of Amerindian ce- ramics or other late prehistoric remains. Two modified shell celts from BA-4 were dated to 3825 ? 25 B.P. (PITT-0731) and 3650 ? 35 B.P. (PITT-0717). The ongoing research at the River site is expected to help revise current models of Archaic Age colonization and adaptation in the West Indies archipelago. Elizabeth Reitz (University of Georgia) recently completed study of faunal remains from the English colonial sites of Highland House and Codrington Cas- tle, Barbuda, and is currently studying prehistoric ver- tebrate remains from the Trants site, Montserrat. Lee Newsom (FMNH) is examining paleobotanical re- mains from the Trants site. Elizabeth Wing (FMNH) and Edward Petuch (Florida Atlantic University) are respectively studying prehistoric vertebrate and mol- luscan fauna from the Rendezvous Bay site, Anguilla. Petuch identified the mollusks from the Barbuda En- glish colonial sites as well. Investigations continued on the island of Nevis at the site of Sulphur Ghaut (JO-2) and other sites, di- rected by Samuel M. Wilson (University of Texas- Austin [UT]). Radiocarbon dates from samples col- lected in 1991 place the Sulphur Ghaut midden de- posits in the tenth to eleventh centuries A.D. The geo- morphology and microstratigraphy of the site is being studied by Matthew Tomaso (UT), and vessel-lot anal- ysis is being conducted by J. Daniel Rogers (Smith- sonian Institution). Salvage excavations were also conducted at the post- Saladoid site of Coconut Walk (JA- 1). Coastal erosion had uncovered four Amerindian burials. Stable-iso- tope and trace-element analyses were carried out on skeletal samples from Sulphur Ghaut and two other sites on Nevis, and further analyses will be undertaken on the samples from Coconut Walk. On Antigua, Mac Goodwin (Boston University) and Reg Murphy (Antigua Historical and Archaeological Society [AHAS]) excavated within the tower walls of the historic sugar mill at Betty's Hope. They sought to find the base for the sugar processing machinery that is currently being refurbished in Rochester, New York. The AHAS has been excavating under the direction of Reg Murphy at the site of Muddy Bay (PH-14), Nonsuch Harbour, Antigua. Several shell middens have been found. Excavations have revealed two ceramic complexes-the Mill Reef style of the Terminal Sala- doid period (ca. A.D. 500-900) and the Mamora Bay style of the Mamora-Troumassoid period (A.D. 900- 1200). Martin T. Fuess (UP) is examining two environ- mentally different parts of Antigua to assess to what degree environmental factors may have influenced pre- historic sociopolitical development on the island. Louis Allaire (University of Manitoba) is initiating a research project on St. Vincent. With the assistance of Early Kirby (St. Vincent National Trust) he was able to examine the St. Vincent Museum's collections and visit some of the major sites. A survey is planned for the spring of 1993. Special attention will be paid to the unique Cayo ceramics as well as to the close association of the archaeological sites with volcanic deposits from all periods on the island. On Grenada, Annie Cody (University of California- Los Angeles) conducted a survey for historically doc- umented, contact-period Amerindian sites in Febru- ary, 1992. Sites were identified and recorded in five locations described in seventeenth-century manu- scripts and maps as Island Carib (Kalinago) and Galibi (Kalina) settlements. Two of the sites will be excavated over the next two years. On Barbados, Peter Drewett (Institute of Archae- ology, University College-London) and his colleagues carried out excavations at the site of Heywoods, on the west coast of the island. The site, located around a former marine inlet and mangrove swamp, was exca- vated prior to development. The project was designed to examine the economic basis of a Late Suazoid (ca. A.D. 1200-1400) occupation and to look for prece- ramic settlements. Two apparently Preceramic conch- lip adzes were dated to 3980 ? 100 B.P. (I-16840). Some ceramic evidence for Saladoid and Early Trou- massoid settlement was found (including white-on-red painted ceramics), although the main occupation was of Late Troumassoid and Suazoid date. Mary Hill Harris (Museum of Archaeology and An- thropology, Cambridge University) analyzed the pot- tery from Heywoods, and found that the earliest ce- ramics were near the prehistoric marsh and the latest near the beach. Elizabeth Wing (FMNH) analyzed the faunal remains and found pelagic species including fly- ing fish, tuna, and shark to be dominant. Lee Newsom (FMNH) identified the first carbonized wood from pre- historic Barbados. Samuel M. Wilson THE AMAZON, EASTERN BRAZIL, AND THE ORINOCO BRAZIL. Bahia. Maria da Conceigco de Moraes Coutinho Beltrao (Museu Nacional) reports that the 151</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Central Project is continuing to reveal significant data. This project has studied an area of 210,000 km2 on the lower-middle Rio Sao Francisco, where a total of 243 sites has been identified. The principal aims of the project are: (1) to prove that humans occupied this part of Brazil in Pleistocene times by finding their remains in good association with fossils of extinct fauna, (2) to identify extinct animals that lived in the Pleistocene and trace the development of paleoenvironments up to the present, and (3) to interpret the archaeological and paleontological evidence in terms of the evolution of ecosystems. Special efforts have been directed towards the Toca da Esperanga site, which is a grouping of three caves located on the fazenda of Pe do Morro in the munic- ipality of Central. This site is in a limestone formation known as Serra Preta or Serra Braba, 37 m above the flood plain. Various hearths consisting of rocks ar- ranged in circles with consolidated sediments have been excavated. The matrix of the hearths appears to have been the result of calcareous material percolated from the walls of the cave and mixed with the fat of animals. Tools found consist largely of bone. Perforators and a scraper made of fossil bone shows the characteristic curved fracture of tools made by humans. Stone arti- facts are found only in small numbers. Calcite flakes have been found that show evidence of use, and one flake of quartzite was made with a Clactonian tech- nique (prepared core). Some of the stone material has its only source 30 km from Toca da Esperanca. Food remains found adjacent to the hearths include a variety of equine bones that have been cut and broken possibly for the extraction of marrow. A mold of a tooth with divergent roots is the only fossil evidence of humans found so far. Four samples, one of which has been tested by two different laboratories, have yielded dates ranging between 300,000 and 200,000 B.P. If these dates are correctly associated with cultural material the evidence indicates that a contemporary of Homo erectus was living in South America. Other research of the Central Project has been di- rected toward the study of cave paintings. A new tra- dition called Astron6mica is characterized by geomet- ric representations of stars and astronomic events. The paintings show simple representations of stars, astro- nomic paths together with stars, and systems that mark the lunar phases and record solstices. A lunar calendar may be represented. Also represented are intentionally superimposed figures of hands, lizard-like animals, ar- rows, and other unidentified symbols. Oppositional re- lations suggest an earth-sky dichotomy. Other repre- sentations indicate that hallucinogens were used. A date of 1270 ? 60 B.P. (GIF-7494) from the Toca dos Bfi- zios site appears to be associated with the Astron6mica tradition. Piaui. Anne-Marie Pessis and Niede Guidon (Mu- seu do Homem Americano [MHA]) report that ar- chaeological work is being carried out at two sites, Toca do Sitio do Meio and the Toca do Garrincho. The Toca do Sitio do Meio is a cave site that was first surveyed in 1973. It is located 5 m above the floor of the Mar- anhao-Piaui Basin near the contact with the Sao Fran- cisco depression. The cave was formed by differential erosion of the base of the hill composed of beds of medium-grained sandstone that alternate with beds of fine silt. Rock slides that originate at the weak points where the two kinds of rock meet have blocked any entrance from the sides. The walls of the cave are cov- ered with paintings in the Northeast tradition, Serra da Capivara, and Serra Telhada styles that were doc- umented in 1973. In 1978 and 1980 test excavations were carried out in two sections of the cave. Lithic material and some sherds were collected. Four beds of blocks of rock that fell at different time were discov- ered. The most recent completely closed the cave. Dates obtained indicated a Pleistocene presence of humans. Excavations carried out in 1978 yielded two dates: Bed V has a date of 12,200 ? 600 B.P. (GIF-4628), and Bed IV has a date of 12,400 + 230 B.P. (GIF-5403). The 1980 test provided two more dates: Bed VI from a different section of the cave was dated at 13,900 ? 300 B.P. (GIF-4927), and Bed XVIII has been dated to 14,300 ? 400 B.P. (GIF-5399). The dates are as- sociated with hearths and lithic material. It was not possible in 1980 to reach the lowest levels of the site because of the number of fallen rocks in Bed XVIII. In 1991 four sectors were marked off. Two alter- nating ones were excavated, while the remaining two were left for stratigraphic control. In the excavated units, well-defined hearths with preserved and burned bone, vegetable fiber (grasses and other plant material), armadillo-carapace fragments, lithic material, and pre- pared paint were found. Charcoal obtained in Hearth 10, which corresponds to the most recent rock fall, has been dated to 8,800 ? 60 B.P. (Beta-47494). This date marks the isolation of the site from the valley. The excavations continued in the interior space between the beds of fallen rock and the back wall of the cave. More hearths with lithic material and animal remains as well as pigment used in the rock art were found. Cultural remains were rare in the levels down to 80 cm, where they became more abundant. Artifacts were most abundant in the 120-130 cm levels and again increased in quantity until a depth of 180 cm was reached and excavations were halted, due to the arrival of the rainy season. Bedrock has not been reached. In Squares E and F, a structure made of cobbles and blocks of stone was found at a depth of 1 m. The interior of the structure was filled with ash and carbon. All of the contents of the interior of this hearth were screened, and in the 128-cm level a smooth, plain, gray sherd was found. A radiocarbon date of 8960 ? 70 B.P. (Beta-47493) dates the occurrence of the sherd. A thermoluminescence date will be available soon. An- other 14C date of 8760 ? 70 B.P. (GIF-8988) was ob- tained from the 155-cm level to the east of where the sherd was found. Until this sherd was found, the ear- liest-known pottery in the Sao Raimundo Nonato area came from the site of Toca do Pinga do Boi, where it was associated with a date of 3010 ? 60 B.P. (GIF- 7606). The other cave site being excavated, Toca do Gar- rincho, is located in the Precambrian, limestone de- pression of Sao Francisco 13 km from the city of Sao Raimundo Nonato. The owner of the site made an excavation at the entrance of the cave in 1986 in order to construct a pond. During work, bones of megafauna were encountered. During analysis of some bones col- 152 [Vol. 58, No. 1, 1993]</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH lected by Claude Guerin (MHA) a piece of human parietal was identified. The charcoal gray piece is com- pletely fossilized. The portion of the site destroyed by the owner was passed over in order to excavate the interior of the cave. Exploratory trenches revealed two distinct assemblages in the site. The upper one consists of fine reddish sediments with some concretions and fallen blocks of stone; only nonfossilized bones of pres- ent-day animals were found. The lower level consists of coarser-grained sediments-essentially pebbles- ce- mented into a charcoal gray, clayey matrix. It is in this layer that the fossilized bones of megafauna are found. Fossilized bones are all of the same charcoal gray color, while the nonfossilized bones of the upper level are the reddish color of the deposit in which they are found. The human parietal bone clearly pertains to the lower levels. Work at this site was halted for the rainy season, but work continued in May 1992. Laboratory analysis of ceramic materials excavated by the French-Brazilian Mission of Piaui is underway. Soil analysis has demonstrated that pollen is not pre- served in the excavated sites, and the only evidence of cultivated plants comes from burials excavated at Toca do Bojo I, where beans, peanuts, and calabash were found associated with burials dated to 2090 ? 110 B.P. (GIF-3223). Skeletal material in the area of Sio Raimundo Non- ato is being analyzed by Evelyne Peyre (MHA). The oldest skeletal remains come from Toca da Janela da Barra do Antoniao, which has been dated to 9670 ? 140 B.P. (GIF-8712). This skeleton of an adult woman of a gracile type was found associated with a hearth, lithic materials, and the remains of megafauna. The following fossil animal varieties have been identified in Piaui: Catonyx cuvieri, Eremotherium lundi, Me- galonychidae indet., Dasypodinae div., Pampatherium humboldti, Hoplophorus euphractus, Panochthus gres- lebini, Glyptodon clavipes, Cuniculus sp., Kerodon ru- pestris, Protocyon troglodytes, Candidae indet., Mus- telidae indet., Arctodus brasiliensis, Felis yagouaroundi, Smilodon populator, Macrauchenia cf patachonica, Toxodon sp., Haplomastodon waringi, Hippidion bon- aerensis, Equus neogaeus, Dicotyles tajacu, Tayassu pecari, Palaeolama major, Mazama sp., Caiman sp., Chelonia indet., Dracaena sp., and Plecostomus au- roguttatus. The megafauna recovered suggest that the environment was a tropical humid forest type with uplands of grass and forests. In December 1993, the MHA will sponsor a work- shop on the peopling of the Americas. The objective of this conference is to bring together the best-known specialists who work on this subject, to establish the current status of research, and to determine the manner in which current research has modified theoretical ex- planations. The program will include three parts: (1) A discussion of the status of the principal theories con- cerning the peopling of the Americas in the decade of the 1980s, focusing on the postulates and fundamental assumptions upon which the theories are based; (2) presentations by different specialists of new archaeo- logical data and data from other disciplines, which confirm or disprove the principal theoretical expla- nations; and (3) presentation of alternative proposi- tions based on new data, and evaluation of the already existing data that still fail to support theoretical posi- tions. Based on the latter, recommendations will be made that will permit orientation of future research and better use of research funds. Researchers who have questions about the conference should write to Anne- Marie Pessis, Fundacao Museu do Homem Ameri- cano, Rua Abdias Neves 551, 64770-Sao Raimundo Nonato, Piaui-Brasil. The University of Amazonas and the Smithsonian Institution sponsored a conference on Quaternary re- search in November 1992. Subjects covered included Quaternary geology, paleontology, hydrology, archae- ology, paleoecology, biodiversity, and climatology. Sao Paulo. Dorath Pinto Uch6a (Museu de Ar- queologia e Etnologia da Universidad de Sao Paulo) reports on work carried out at the Mar Virado site by a team of prehistorians, historians, ecologists, geo- morphologists, and anthropologists. Research is de- signed to document the history of the municipality of Ubatuba from prehistoric times until the present. The preceramic site is located on an old marine terrace (6 m asl) on the northeast portion of the island of Mar Virado near the mouth of a small river. Fishing and some collecting of shellfish and vegetable materials are the main activities evidenced at the site. Plant and animal remains indicate that the tropical environment was permanently humid (no dry season) at the time of occupation. Shell mounds characteristic of the sam- baquis are not present. Site area as defined by system- atic excavations is 128 m2, with a depth of 15 to 30 cm. Excavated features include human burials, re- mains of hearths, and ovens. Ten human burials and about 600 stone, bone, shell, and animal tooth artifacts have been recovered. The dating of the site is approx- imately 1875 B.P. based on correlations with radio- carbon dates from the site of Ten6rio located in the region of Ubatuba. PERU. Silvia M6nica Panaifo Teixeira (Instituto Riva Aguero Universidad Cat6olica [IRAUC]) reports that little fieldwork is being carried out in the Peruvian Amazon. In6s del Aguila Rios (IRAUC) is continuing analysis of ceramic materials from Lago Sandoval on the Madre de Dios. Rosa Fung Pineda (Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos) is about to publish work carried out at the site of Nueva Esperanza de Panaillo (Yarinacocha). Silvia M6nica is continuing analysis of materials excavated with Oliver Gyulavari on the Peruvian Amazon. Their work includes a report on evidence of features representing house structures excavated at Cushabatay. ECUADOR. Ecuadorian Amazonia. Patricia J. Netherly (University of Massachusetts-Amherst) re- ports that research sponsored by United States petro- leum companies is continuing. Survey and excavation at Ramirez 1, a UNOCAL exploratory well location in Pastaza Province, located seven prehistoric sites on the southern tip of a long, southeastward-trending ridge south of the broad valley of the Namoyacu River. The Namoyacu is a tributary of the Curaray, one of the principal rivers of eastern Ecuador. It is probable that other sites will be found on the Ramirez 1 ridge when the survey is completed. 153</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Ceramics related to the Pfstaza phase were found at two sites. Thin plainwares made from kaolin clay, pos- sibly related to plainwares of the Napo phase, were found at a third. A test pit excavated in a midden deposit (PaPuCu-03), one of the two sites with Pastaza- related ceramics, produced a 14C date of 1170 ? 100 B.P. (Beta-44257). This twelfth-century date appears congruent with others obtained by Netherly from sites with similar ceramics. Test pits were placed in two additional sites. A test excavation in a site (PaPuCu-05) on a knoll top west of the Ramirez 1 revealed two occupations. In addition to the ceramics found high in the stratigraphic column in a kitchen-midden context, the later occupation was characterized by a low burial mound, an associated smaller mound, and an apparent upright column of petrified wood. No date has been obtained for this occupation, but it would appear to be 650 B.P. or later on the basis of the ceramic comparisons. The lower levels of the site contain refuse and evi- dence of domestic occupation. A charcoal sample from the superior of two hearth features gave a date of 1430 ? 90 B.P. (Beta-44259). This date is congruent with other late fifth- and early sixth-century dates for the initial occupation of ridge tops in this region. Charcoal from a hearth in a very small, single com- ponent site, (PaPuCu-06) produced a carbon date of 660 ? 70 B.P. (Beta-44260). There is no reason to believe that this small occupation was strictly contem- porary with the final occupation at PaPuCu-05, al- though they are probably relatively close in time. The reasons for a mid-first millennium A.D. ap- pearance of populations on ridge top locations in cen- tral-eastern Ecuador are not yet known. Settlements appear to have been dispersed over more or less dis- crete territories with a fairly dense regional population. Habitation sites were apparently occupied for several decades and often reoccupied. More needs to be learned of the geographic, ecological, and strategic reasons for returning to particular ridge-top locations. Netherly has carried out work in 1991 and planned to work in 1992. However, as contract work requires reports to be made to the contracting agency before it can be mentioned in publication, no report on the most recent work in eastern Ecuador is available. VENEZUELA. Bolivar and Territorio Federal Amazonas. John Greer (University of Missouri-Co- lumbia) continues to study pictographic rock art in southwestern Venezuela. Survey so far has located 21 painted caves in the Puerto Ayacucho area, with about 100 more caves reported by local Piaroa Indians and other sources. A tentative sequence of at least five chro- nological styles has been defined, with most apparently related to the Middle Orinoco ceramic sequence (at least Saladoid through Valladoid). The earliest painting with large yellow anthropomorphs and faded red geo- metric patterns has no previous ceramic period equiv- alents. No direct dating of pigments has been com- pleted, and absolute ages are uncertain. There seems to be a temporal change from mineral pigments in the earliest periods, to later composite vegetable paints, which may represent an intensification of plant control by resident populations. Petroglyphs usually occur next to rivers, while pictographs are mainly in upland set- tings. There appears to be little, if any, relation between the two art traditions. Most of the caves have been (many continue to be) used as cemeteries, but the re- lation between art and burial is uncertain. Most art appears to be the result of non-burial-related shaman- istic activities. The study is an extension of past and continuing work on rock art of the Parquaza area by Franz Scaramelli (Universidad Central de Venezuela [UCV]) and previous work by Miguel Angel Perera (UCV). The results are relevant to current projects in adjacent areas by Kay Tarble (UCV) on the Middle Orinoco, Alberta Zucchi (Instituto Venezolano de In- vestigaciones Cientificas) on the Upper Orinoco, and William Barse (Baltimore, Maryland) around Puerto Ayacucho. Ronald L. Weber ANDEAN SOUTH AMERICA COLOMBIA. During 1991 David M. Stemper (In- stituto Vallecaucano de Investigaciones Cientificas [INCIVA] and Universidad de los Andes) and Hector Salgado L6pez (INCIVA) continued survey and exca- vations in the Bocana (Buenaventura Bay) and Pales- tina (San Juan River) localities on the Colombian Pa- cific Coast. Bocana is the Tolita polity's northernmost excavated settlement, located about 350 km from To- lita. A trash pit excavated in Bocana included sedi- ments that were floated and analyzed for pollen and phytoliths. Charcoal from the pit was dated to 2050 ? 50 B.P. (Beta-45781). This assay serves to date other elements in the pit-such as a maize cob, a mold for figurine production, and six to eight figurine fragments (assignable to Tolita Clasico in Francisco Valdez's chronology). Earlier fieldwork at Bocana, a 1 -ha Tolita- Tumaco settlement, was expanded by excavating an additional 10 units (15 m2) and 45 shovel tests. In addition to the recovery of an obsidian flake, note- worthy results were the soil profiles; these show that the Tolita-Tumaco agro-fisherfolk modified the ground surface to construct a mound-like topography that im- proved drainage and reduced tidal- and rainy-season flooding. Stemper and Salgado also are analyzing six- teenth- to nineteenth-century pottery recovered in sur- vey and excavations in the Cali and Pacific Coast regions. In the moist rainforests of the Choc6, excavations were again carried out in the Palestina locality to doc- ument a late Formative site with Catanguero-style pot- tery, a late Prehispanic altar-like structure of pebbles (60 x 60 x 45 cm), and a late Prehispanic terra preta anthrosol (Palestina III). Charcoal from the excavation of this late Formative site was dated to 2190 ? 60 B.P. (Beta-45782). Supporting G. Reichel-Dolmatoffs in- terpretation, the approximately coeval Bocana and Pa- lestina dates suggest that two different pottery styles and, possibly, culturally distinct peoples, were present along an ecological boundary between the wetter Choc6 biogeographic region and the slightly drier mangrove forests and coastal plain south of the San Juan River. Three units (5 m2) were excavated to examine the altar- like structure and the late Formative deposit. 154 [Vol. 58, No. 1, 1993]</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH At Palestina III, five units (8 m2) and 12 shovel tests were used to study the black anthropogenic soil along a cliff edge about 30 m above the San Juan River. The ancient rainforest farmers seemed to have intentionally created the anthrosols in two events: one during which they lived slightly outside the 600-700 m2 of black soil and a later one during which they lived on the soils. Excavations of the anthrosols unearthed 30-50 car- bonized maize cobs and kernels, abundant pollen, two metal objects, and diagnostic pottery (called repujado tuberculado) dated by G. Reichel-Dolmatoff to A.D. 1000-1500. This site represents the first identified ex- ample of anthropogenic soils from the Colombian Pa- cific. The evidence of metallurgy, agricultural inten- sification, and possible ceremonial activities strengthen interpretations concerning late Prehispanic political complexity in this region. Between August 1991 and February 1992 Carlos A. Rodriguez (INCIVA) and David M. Stemper began a long-term project to study Cauca Valley chiefdoms. The survey has covered 20 percent of 1,000 ha between Cali and Palmira. This fieldwork identified 10-15 sites and conducted small-scale test excavations at four of them and at one cemetery. Survey along the Rio Bolo, 3 km east of the CIAT research station, located a late Prehispanic site in the 5-m-deep profile of a quarry. The profile preserved five distinct layers, three of which included pottery in the Bolo and Quebrada Seca styles. Research at this unique stratified site will help to refine the late Prehispanic sequence and to generate geo- morphological and climatic information regarding the constraints affecting ancient farmers as a result of changes from drier to wetter conditions and to periods of flooding along the Bolo River. ECUADOR. A systematic surface survey of the Pi- mampiro District in the province of Imbabura of the northern Ecuadorian highlands was conducted by Ta- mara Bray (Smithsonian Institution) between June and August of 1991. This study constitutes the first phase of a longer-term project designed to investigate the prehistoric linkages between Andean and neighboring eastern lowland populations in the northern sierra. Lo- cated near one of a limited number of natural passes through the eastern cordillera, Pimampiro is described in sixteenth-century sources as gateway to the Oriente and an important multiethnic trade center. The Pi- mampiro district was also a center of coca production during the late prehistoric period. The principal goal of the first field season was to document the settlement pattern of the Pimampiro dis- trict. Thirty-six km2 centered around the valley of the Rio Mataqui, in the southeastern sector of the Chota- Mira drainage system, were surveyed using pedestrian transects. The investigations covered approximately 75 percent of the project area as originally defined. Of the 20 sites recorded, half are situated on the narrow alluvial terraces at the bottom of the Rio Mataqui can- yon, another seven sites are located at varying levels above the valley floor on the relatively broad expanses of ancient river terraces, and the remainder are found on ridge tops or sloping ridge toes. The majority of sites in this district are represented by surface scatters of pottery sherds. Systematic surface collections were made at each site. In contrast to site assemblages from southern Imbabura and northern Pi- chincha provinces, little obsidian detritus was ob- served in this region. Preliminary analysis of the ceramics reveals the presence of the same types of red- slipped and undecorated Caranqui wares known from elsewhere in the province, Tuza Bichrome pottery, and Carchi Negativo or Capuli. Vessel forms typical of the local assemblages include shoe-shaped zapatiform ollas; tripod vessels; elongated, flat-bottomed jars; and ped- estal-based jars and bowls known as compoteras. Con- quero figurines, which date to the Capuli phase, and ocarinas, considered diagnostic of the subsequent Piar- tal phase, were also present in collections belonging to local residents. A number of free-standing, carved stone heads in bas-relief and other pecked-stone objects were recorded in the southwestern sector of the project area. Of greatest interest are the stone-faced terraces that were discovered during the investigations along the bottom of the Rio Mataqui Valley. The presence of stone-faced terraces in this or any other sector of the equatorial Andes has not been previously reported. Five sites with relatively well-preserved terraces were recorded in the Rio Mataqui Valley at elevations rang- ing from 1,820 to 2,320 m asl. These features are typ- ically faced with undressed and unsorted stones ranging in size from boulders to cobbles that are loosely fit in pirca-style construction. The length, width, and height of the terraces varies greatly from site to site. One of the best-preserved sets of terraces is located on the east side of the Mataqui approximately 2 km south of the confluence with the Rio Escudillas. The terraces at this site average 30 m in length, 1.5-1.8 m in height, and vary between 10 and 14 m in width. A small amount of pottery was recovered at this site, including one decorated Tuza rim sherd. Smaller sets of abandoned terraces were noted on the steep slope immediately behind this site and at a separate site located slightly further south. These smaller segments tend to follow the contour of the slope rather than a straight align- ment. Another cluster of terraces with stone facing is located approximately 6 km upstream, beyond the con- fluence of the Rios Pisque and Blanco, in the vicinity of the village of Pueblo Nuevo. Further analysis of the ceramic materials and future research will shed more light on the age, prevalence, and agricultural potential of these terraces. Since 1989, A. Jorge Arellano (Universidad del Valle de Guatemala) has been carrying out a study of the central highlands of Ecuador in collaboration with Er- nesto Salazar and Patricio Moncayo. During the first field season (1989-1990), they carried out archaeolog- ical survey in three areas: the western slopes of the Rio Chimbo drainage, the inter-Andean corridor between Riobamba and Alausi, and the Cebadas Valley on the eastern slopes of the highlands. The valley formed by the Rio Chimbo constituted one of the principal areas with settlements dating to the final phase of the Inte- gration period (A.D. 1400-1500). These occupations belong to the Tomavela culture, which is characterized by polished ceramics with applique decorations of an- thropomorphic motifs and cane-impressed geometric motifs around the necks of vessels. In the ceramic as- semblage there are distinctive tripod globular cooking 155</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY pots with everted rims, as well as various types of bowls and jars. Burials were made in unlined pits excavated in the sides of the hills. These usually include the re- mains of one to three individuals, along with grave goods that include several pieces of domestic pottery and carbonized maize cobs. Architectural remains are found in the northern por- tion of the basin above an elevation of 4,000 m asl. These structures are circular with two or three terrace levels; they were made by the accumulation of earth fill. No evidence was encountered or room complexes or associated artifactual material. The location of these structures on isolated hilltops and their considerable elevation above sea level suggests that they may be shrines for religious worship. Evidence of a preceramic occupation-obsidian and basalt flakes and artifacts-was found in a series of caves and rockshelters in the Salinas de Tomavela area, which is located in the northern sector of the Chimbo drainage. A Formative occupation was located in the southern sector of the Chimbo Valley. The types of pottery recovered include vessels with incised geo- metric decoration in red-slipped zones. The pottery from this area is related to that of Cerro Narrio. Two sites, Tzitus-Pumallacta and La Merced, were found in the inter-Andean corridor between Riobamba and Alausi. Tzitus-Pumallacta is a pucara (fortified site) that contains a ceramic sequence with Formative ceramics in the Cerro Narrio tradition, Integration pe- riod pottery, Puruha-style ceramics, and Inka mate- rials. La Merced appears to correspond to a Preceramic occupation, judging from the abundance of chalcedony and quartzite lithics. A range of denticulates, scrapers, burins, perforators, cores, and flakes was found, and a small amount of highly fragmented incised Formative pottery and later Puruha-style ceramics were also re- covered. During the 1991 field season, excavations were car- ried out in the Cebadas Valley. Important Formative sites were located there, including the site of Hierba Buena Ichubamba. This site has at least 2 m of cultural materials and 7 14C measurements from different levels in this stratified archaeological deposit ranging from 670 B.C. to A.D. 700. The Formative levels included abundant animal remains and ceramics. The ceramics are related to the Cerro Narrio and Pirincay pottery of the southern highlands, but they also show contact with the Upano tradition of the eastern lowlands and the Chorrera culture of the Pacific Coast. James A. Zeidler (University of Illinois [UI]) recently completed the last of four field seasons of regional ar- chaeological survey and site testing in the Jama River valley, northern Manabi Province (Ecuador), as part of a long-term archaeological and paleoethnobotanical project in collaboration with Deborah M. Pearsall (University of Missouri-Columbia [UMC]). Research was initiated in 1988 for the purpose of studying the evolution of prehistoric settlement dynamics, agricul- tural subsistence systems, and social complexity of the poorly studied Jama-Coaque chiefdoms and their For- mative period precursors. A 785-km study area within the Jama River drainage was selected for probabilistic sampling and subdivided into three survey strata on the basis of various physiographic criteria. These in- clude "semiarid coastal plain" (Stratum I), "sub-hu- mid coastal cordillera" (Stratum II), and "humid up- land valley" (Stratum III). In conjunction with ongoing investigations at the large regional center of San Isidro (M3D2-001), the probabilistic survey was designed to examine production throughout the valley as a means of placing San Isidro within a broader regional context. As a result of subsurface testing at selected sites, a detailed regional chronology has now been established for the Jama Valley. Four principal occupations have thus far been documented. They have been subdivided into seven discrete phases on the basis of ceramic se- riation and an absolute chronology based on 26 ra- diocarbon dates. Stratigraphic correlation of three vol- canic ashfalls (tephra) also aids in the chronological segregation of these occupations across the valley. The first two occupations pertain to the Formative period and include a short-lived Terminal Valdivia compo- nent (1680-1550 B.C.) followed by a local variant of the Chorrera culture (ca. 895 B.C.). The Valdivia com- ponent is also associated with the first volcanic ash layer in the sequence (Tephra I), bracketed by four radiocarbon dates, which average to 1627 B.C. The ceramics of these two Formative components are quite distinctive and are respectively termed the Piquigua complex and the Tabuchila complex. Both are clearly identifiable as counterparts to the well-studied Ter- minal Valdivia and Chorrera cultures of coastal Gua- yas, southern Manabi, and the Guayas Basin. Curi- ously only two Formative period sites have been documented in the lower Jama Valley, suggesting a primarily agricultural, riverine focus in the upper val- ley some distance inland from the seashore. It is im- portant to note, however, that these two lower valley sites were buried by subsequent alluvial aggradation. Special subsurface investigation techniques, such as deep systematic coring and/or geophysical prospecting, will be required in order to clarify the nature of For- mative period settlement in this zone. The Regional-Developmental and Integration peri- ods are represented respectively by the Jama-Coaque I and Jama-Coaque II cultures, which form a long ce- ramic tradition spanning from ca. 355 B.C. until well into the Colonial period. Ceramic seriation of utilitar- ian pottery, together with stratigraphic correlation and radiometric dating, has allowed subdivision of this tra- dition into five distinct phases collectively termed the Muchique complex. Muchique 1 corresponds to Jama- Coaque I and spans from 355 B.C. to A.D. 400. The former date marks the eruption of Pululahua Volcano in the Quito Basin (2305 ? 65 B.P. [SI-2128]), which blanketed the Jama Valley with its second layer of volcanic ash (Tephra II). Muchique 1 ceramics have been cross-dated between the middle and lower valley and analyses currently in progress should permit fur- ther temporal subdivision of this long phase. The Jama- Coaque II occupation is segregated from Muchique 1 by the third layer of volcanic ash (Tephra III) and is divided into three ceramic phases. Muchique 2 dates from ca. A.D. 400 to 750, Muchique 3 dates from A.D. 750 to 1250, and Muchique 4 spans from A.D. 1250 to 1532. All three of these Jama-Coaque II ceramic phases have been documented in both the middle and lower valleys. Finally, a Colonial period occupation of 156 [Vol. 58, No. 1, 1993]</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH the same ceramic tradition, termed Muchique 5, has also been defined in the lower valley with an associated date in the mid-1600s. Sporadic finds of Mantefio ce- ramics (principally burnished blackware) have also been noted throughout northern Manabi, but appear to re- flect either trading enclaves or a tenuous political he- gemony of that polity over the Jama-Coaque II peoples during the late Integration period (Muchique 4?), rather than a complete population replacement. A program of stratified-random-cluster sampling was carried out in the three survey strata with differential coverage of high- and low-density areas of archaeo- logical occupation. The strategy involved 100 percent survey coverage of discontinuous pockets of primary alluvium along the principal channels of the Jama drainage as well as the coastal shoreline, since prior research identified these as high-density areas of ar- chaeological occupation with deep multicomponent sites. The remaining landscape, occupying the vast ma- jority of the study area, is composed of nonalluvial upland terrain, along with alluvial deposits in older terraces and small upland tributary streams. This was considered to be a lower density area, and the three strata were randomly sampled with a combined total of 130 small, 1-ha (100-x- 100-m) quadrats. The quad- rats were visually inspected with 100 percent coverage and an optimal crew spacing of 20 m. Where visual inspection was not possible due to dense vegetation, shovel-probe testing was employed at the four comer points and center of the quadrat, or a combination of shovel probes and visual inspection was employed. Although logistically difficult in some cases, shovel- probe testing proved to be a reasonably effective meth- od of site discovery in areas of dense tropical vegeta- tion. The completed survey yielded a total of 206 sites discovered within the sampled areas of Strata I-III. Together with 33 other sites located and registered out- side of the probabilistic sample, some 239 archaeo- logical sites have now been recorded in the Jama Val- ley. Analysis of the surface and shovel-probe assemblages from these sites is still in progress, there- fore precise chronological placement of prehistoric oc- cupations is not yet possible. A series of 11 additional radiocarbon assays and 30 thermoluminescence deter- minations are currently in progress and will consid- erably strengthen the absolute chronology on a valley- wide scale. In general, the sites represent a broad spectrum of site size, function, and spatial location within the drain- age basin, and overall site density was somewhat higher than expected, especially in the nonalluvial upland ter- rain. The majority of the sites pertain to the long Jama- Coaque II occupation of the valley (ca. A.D. 400-1532) when site density and settlement pattern complexity appear to reach their maximum. Many of the larger flood-plain sites have deep multicomponent occupa- tions beginning in the Formative period, suggesting that basic patterns of site location and settlement hi- erarchy were established, at least in rudimentary form, immediately after the initial colonization of the valley in Valdivia 8 times. Once the chronological placement of all components is determined, multivariate analysis of up to 10 environmental and cultural variables re- corded for each site will allow precise determination of valley-wide settlement dynamics through time. In addition to survey work, limited test excavations and "rescue" operations were conducted at several se- lected sites, providing crucial chronostratigraphic in- formation and contextual radiocarbon samples at widely separated points in the study area. These yielded a variety of excavated features from throughout the cul- tural sequence, including occupation floors, postholes, storage/refuse pits, deep clay-lined ovens, hearths, clay- lined canals, and human burial pits. Monumental earthworks were also documented, including habita- tional and/or ceremonial mounds (tolas) and long paired ridges (cordones) of uncertain function. The clearest evidence of monumental architecture in Stratum III includes the large accretional platform mounds located at the San Isidro site (M3D2-001) and the Zapallo site (M3D2-103), a secondary center situated in the upper reaches of the drainage. Project topographer Aurelio Iturralde has calculated total volumes of these mounds at over 88,000 m3 and over 66,000 m3, respectively. Perhaps the most noteworthy discovery of the final field season was a large platform mound (M3B3-012) located in the lower valley alluvium (Stratum I). It is triangular in plan, measuring over 250,000 cubic me- ters in volume and over 12 m in height. The top of the mound exhibits three cordones of probably ceremonial function measuring ca. 30 m in length. Test excava- tions conducted by Marie J. Sutliff (ESPOL, Guaya- quil) revealed stratigraphic evidence for three episodes of construction along with a clay-lined hearth at the bottom of the building sequence. Several badly eroded human burials were also exposed in a profile cut at the southern edge of the cordones suggesting a mortuary function for this area of the mound. A radiocarbon date of 800 ? 40 B.P. (PITT-1129) from the bottom of the cordones places the beginning of this sequence in Jama-Coaque II times, in the later portion of Muc- hique Phase 3. As a tentative interpretation, this mas- sive mound-building activity may represent a gradual shift in the locus of sociopolitical power from the San Isidro site (M3D2-001) to the lower valley alluvium, since existing data indicate that San Isidro was aban- doned by the end of Muchique 3. Several project personnel carried out related field studies in conjunction with the survey. Pearsall con- tinued her long-term comparative study of modem agronomic practices and agricultural yield, while trop- ical botanist Robin Kennedy (UMC) conducted a com- prehensive vegetation survey of the Jama Valley. Jack Donahue (University of Pittsburgh [UP]) completed a geoarchaeological study of valley alluviation through detailed examination of eight sediment columns from Strata I and III. Peter Stahl (State University of New York-Binghamton), John Isaacson (UI), and Laurie Zimmerman (Texas A&amp;M University) each made brief field visits for purposes of their respective studies of archaeofauna, tephrochronology, and palynology. Fi- nally, two graduate thesis projects are currently in prog- ress. Even Engwall (UI) initiated dissertation research on the Late Formative Chorrera occupation of the val- ley through limited stratigraphic excavations at sites found in prior systematic survey of Strata II and III. One of these, El Mocorral (M3B4-03 1), was located in 157</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY the upland headwaters of the Don Juan drainage deep in Stratum II, while the other (M3D2-009) was located in the San Isidro alluvial area of Stratum III. Since the sites occupy very different locations within the Jama drainage net, and different positions within the Chor- rera settlement hierarchy, they provide useful points of comparison for understanding the Late Formative occupation of the valley. In a second project, Cesar Veintimilla (UMC) provided a paleoenvironmental re- construction of the changing biotic communities in Stratum III through detailed analysis of opal phytoliths extracted from a noncultural sediments column. PERU. In 1991, the Tfcume Archaeological Pro- ject (PAT) completed its third season of excavations at the late Prehispanic (ca. A.D. 1000-1532) monu- mental center of Tucume. This site is built on and around La Raya Mountain in the Lambayeque Valley of northern Peru. PAT is coordinated by Thor Hey- erdahl, and in 1991 continued to be codirected by Al- fredo Narvaez (Instituto Nacional de Cultura) and Daniel Sandweiss (Carnegie Museum [CM]). Narvaez continued excavations on the Huaca Larga, the largest structure at the site. On a raised platform in the middle of the mound, he found an adobe building associated with wall paintings and apparently dating to the latest pre-Inka occupation of the site. These adobe construc- tions were covered by stone structures associated with the Inka occupation. Next to the Huaca Larga, Narvaez excavated a small U-shaped temple with abundant of- ferings, including Inka figurines, metal cutouts, and llamas. On the south side of La Raya mountain, Nar- vaez carried out salvage excavations in a cemetery, uncovering over 40 gravelots dating to the Late Ho- rizon and early Colonial period. Sandweiss continued excavations in the West Mound, a buried structure on the west side of La Raya. The earliest building was apparently a niched tomb cham- ber. Over time the surrounding structure became in- creasingly more elaborate until the tomb contents were removed, and a new building with a radically different plan was built over the same area, apparently at or near the beginning of the Late Horizon. Shortly after this new structure was built, watermarks indicate a strong El Nifno event. The new structure has a small (ca. 1-m2) clay model of a ramped, stepped platform with an as- sociated burial. After several minor remodelings, the building was completely buried with midden-rich fill. Sandweiss also excavated a badly looted platform as- sociated with the buried structure, finding several par- tially preserved burials. Bernardino Ojeda (Centro de Investigaciones de Zonas Aridas [CIZA]) mapped the extant structures on La Raya Mountain. The resulting map indicates that the entire mountain had been built over with a com- bination of adobe, stone, and rubble fill. Sandweiss also began excavations in an area on top of La Raya, on the east side, where he found a terraced slope covered with small (&lt; 1 m2) storage units. Above and below the slope were agglutinated rooms. Associated pottery indicates a Late Horizon date for the mountaintop structures and suggests long-distance connections. Just below the terraced slope, in the Cueva Blanca, a 64-m2 cave eroded into the side of the mountain. The upper deposits rested on a possible floor; they consisted of roof fall mixed with water-borne sediments from an adjacent platform, including late prehistoric pottery. Only roof fall was found below the floor; there were no indications of use of the cave prior to the Late Intermediate period. In November and December of 1991, Daniel Sand- weiss (CM) excavated a series of test pits at the Ostra Base Camp, a mid-Holocene preceramic settlement on a stranded embayment north of the Santa River. The main objective of the project was to recover a sample of faunal and floral remains to evaluate whether cli- matic or geographic change accounts for the presence of warm-water mollusks in the fossil embayment and associated site. The invertebrates are being studied by Sandweiss and Harold B. Rollins (UP); Elizabeth J. Reitz (University of Georgia) is analyzing the verte- brate remains; and Asunci6n Cano E. (Museo Javier Prado de Historia Natural) is identifying the scarce botanical material. Eight 14C dates by the Jaan Ter- asmae Radiocarbon Lab at Brock University place the main occupation of the site between about 5800 and 6300 B.P. In addition to the organic remains, the site yielded a lithic industry based on cobbles, cobble flakes, and ground stone. A few shell and bone artifacts were also recovered. One artifact type (small, incised pebbles with one end planed flat) appears most closely related to Valdivia Pamar series figurines from Ecuador, al- though the Ostra Base Camp predates the earliest Val- divia settlements and appears to fall in the hiatus be- tween Las Vegas and Valdivia. Brian Billman (University of California-Santa Bar- bara [UCSB]) completed a survey of the Middle Moche Valley in 1990-1991, and he is currently in the process of analyzing the results. Billman reports that the work covered the section of the valley that extends from the valley neck at Cerro Oreja and Galindo to just above the town of Poroto on the Moche and just above Simbal on the Sinsicap tributary of the Moche. This stretch of land runs from 150 to 750 m asl, and it represents approximately 30 km of the valley. Billman recorded 481 sites including 81 Formative sites, 99 Salinar sites, 61 Gallinazo sites, 120 highland-related Early Inter- mediate period sites, 97 Moche sites, 22 early Chimu sites, 158 late Chimu sites, and 24 highland-related Late Intermediate period sites; 86 sites could not be dated. Of the 481 sites, the most common were hab- itation sites (n = 308), followed by cemeteries (n = 30), forts (n = 15), and ceremonial sites (n = 13). James Vreeland (University of Texas-Austin) con- tinues his long-term study of indigenous cotton culti- vation. Using a combination of archaeological, eth- nohistoric, and ethnographic information, he has assembled a general model for the sustainable produc- tion of native varieties of cotton along the arid Peru- vian coast. The fibers of these ancient cottons include a wide range of natural colors unlike anything in the Old World. Vreeland has used archaeology to help elu- cidate indigenous practices of pest control for these crops. An examination of 125 soil samples collected from a north-coast field system abandoned around A.D. 1250 yielded a wide range of pollen grains. Over 90 158 [Vol. 58, No. 1, 1993]</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH percent of these were identified as Gossypium, the ge- nus to which cotton belongs, and cucurbits, members of the squash family. In addition, the pollen of a weedy shrub identified as mastrante (Lippia sp.) was common in the samples. The latter plant is still grown next to native cotton to control a common pest known in En- glish as the "cotton stainer" (Dysdercus peruvianus), and Vreeland believes it already was being used for this purpose in Precolumbian times. The iconography of textiles is also seen as providing an avenue for iden- tifying Precolumbian strategies for controlling insect populations. For example, the head, abdomen, and thorax of a ladybug endemic in native cotton was rep- resented in a polychrome tapestry. Farmers currently recognize the beneficial actions of these insects and protect the individuals that appear on the leaves of their crops. Vreeland believes that his study of cotton illustrates the rich potential for the multifaceted study of paleotechnologies inherited from the Precolumbian past. The Lurin Valley Project, directed by Richard Burger (Yale University) and Lucy Salazar-Burger (Yale Pea- body Museum) continued a long-term study of Initial period culture and society in the lower Lurin drainage. In July and August of 1991, a second season of inves- tigations was carried out at the site of Mina Perdida. The research consisted mainly of (1) additional map- ping in order to produce a final site map, (2) new ex- cavations to the south of the public architecture in the area devoted to domestic activities, and (3) excavations on the western lateral mound. Some small-scale clear- ing was done along the back terraces and the central staircase of the main mound in order to resolve ar- chitectural problems that came to light during the first field season. The mapping of the U-shaped public ar- chitecture by Bernadino Ojeda (CIZA) confirmed that the site covered at least 30 ha and that the central mound rose 22 m in height. A low platform mound was encountered to the northwest of the western lateral mound, and its contemporaneity with the main com- plex has been confirmed by 14C dating. Extensive areas of domestic refuse were documented outside of the area of public architecture, including 7 ha behind the central mound and 8 ha to the west of the western lateral mound. Selective trenching and ex- cavation of the zone south of the main mound con- firmed that the area has been badly disturbed by mod- ern construction activities, and that most of the Initial period refuse lacks stratigraphic context. However, there are places where intact materials were isolated and domestic features including postholes and a stone-lined pit were uncovered in association with Initial period materials. The western lateral mound has been heavily dam- aged by construction activities, but the investigations succeeded in providing a partial sequence for its con- struction and, in the process, the work offered new insights into the technology and economy of Mina Per- dida. The excavations in the western wing documented the growth of the terraced platform mound by small horizontal and vertical increments, most of which re- quired only a small investment of labor to complete. Several new building techniques were encountered, in- cluding the use of bagged stone (shicras) in wall con- struction as well as fills. Another unprecedented con- struction practice was the facing of uneven terrace walls with a plastered wattle-and-daub veneer. The absence of these techniques in contemporary constructions at the nearby site of Cardal reinforces an earlier conclu- sion that despite the similarity in the layout of U-shaped centers there are significant differences between them, even in the case of neighboring coeval complexes. Midden-rich fills and in situ refuse were recovered in the western lateral mound, and a large collection of well-preserved organic artifacts and ecofacts was ob- tained. Although the sample of cultigens recovered was large, maize and coca appeared to be scarce or absent. Three pieces of cut copper sheet were recovered in sealed late Initial period contexts. These layers date prior to 1000 B.C., and the small fragments appear to constitute the earliest examples of copper metallurgy documented for the central Andes thus far. Laboratory analysis is being conducted to determine how the cop- per sheet was produced and whether it was made at Mina Perdida. Archaeological reconnaissance was conducted in the upper Camana Valley by Michael Malpass (Ithaca Col- lege) and Pablo de la Vera Cruz, Marko Lopez, Lucy Linares, and Willy Yepez, all of the Instituto de Es- tudios del Sur in Arequipa. The survey identified four sites with simple architecture on the south side of the river near the village of Characta. Three of these had no artifactual remains, and one, located on a prominent point above a bend in the river, had ceramics of prob- able Late Horizon cultural affiliation. The main focus of investigations was centered on the village of Sonay, located approximately 25 km upvalley from the town of Camana. On the north side of the river across from Sonay were three architectural sites, two on either side of the Puluvifias Quebrada. The site on the west side was a single enclosure that was partially eroded by the quebrada. Ceramics appeared to date to the Late In- termediate period or Late Horizon. The site on the east side, called Puluvifias by Julio Manrique (Universidad Nacional de San Agustin), has several discrete parts: a large multiroomed complex, a smaller set of three plat- forms with rooms on the steep mountain slope above the complex, and two walls, one small and one large, which partially enclose the other areas. The third site on the north side of the river near Sonay is located 3 km west of Puluvifias. It is a mul- ticomponent site consisting of room foundations and walled compounds. There are two discrete parts to the site (called Sonay), one consisting of two large rect- angular rooms associated with abundant Inka ceram- ics. The other is a square compound of rooms remi- niscent of Wari architecture elsewhere in the central highlands. This compound is composed of four square room complexes with a corridor surrounding them, each with separate entrances. Smaller rooms are found around the walls of plaza-like open spaces in each. Excavations were conducted in one room and one corridor in this compound to recover datable materials and ceramics. Neither carbon samples nor diagnostic artifacts were recovered, although the ceramics iden- tified have Wari forms. A later Inka occupation of the site, apparently restricted to exterior rooms of the com- plex, complicates the understanding of this site's oc- 159</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY cupational history. Three looted cemeteries are asso- ciated with the site. A brief pedestrian survey by Malpass and Yepez farther east along the river identified a major multi- component site called Pillistay on the north side of the river from the village of Socso. This site extends for approximately 1 km along the river, and includes both architectural features and cemeteries. The major part of the site consists of rooms located on a small rise at the west end of the site. Preservation is excellent, and the visible features include storage bins inside cane- walled rooms. Walls are preserved up to a height of 2 m. Of particular interest are two rooms in the center of the complex, which have circular foundations rem- iniscent of chulpas. The ceramics range in date from the Middle Horizon to Late Horizon, with a possible earlier component as well. Several different burial tech- niques were recognized in the five cemeteries near the site. Structural forms are also distinct in different areas, suggesting temporally discrete occupations may be identified with further work. One other small site with architecture and Late Horizon ceramics was located on the south side of the river between Sonay and Socso. Ongoing research on the Preceramic period occu- pation of the coastal sections of the department of Moquegua, Peru, is being conducted by Karen Wise (Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County). Re- search on the Preceramic period occupation of the coastal sections of the Department of Moquegua, Peru continued during the 1991 field season at the site of Villa del Mar. This site, which dates between 6000 and 8000 B.P., contains the remains of domestic, midden, and cemetery areas. The five tombs (a total of eight individuals) excavated thus far are related to the Chin- chorro tradition. The Chinchorro tradition, best known from northern Chile, is characterized by elaborate buri- al treatment including the replacement of soft tissue and bone with vegetal material. Although the Chin- chorro tradition has long been considered to extend north into southern Peru, Villa del Mar is the first well- documented site of this tradition in Ilo. Continuing research on the Preceramic period oc- cupation of Ilo focuses on the development of seden- tism and specialized maritime economies at several sites in the Ilo area. Participants in the project include Heidi Lennstrom (University of Minnesota [UM]), who is investigating the history of Preceramic period plant exploitation; Karen Rasmussen (UCSB) who is ex- amining changes in patterns of faunal exploitation through time; April Seivert (Shippensburg University), who is investigating the development of specialized lithic technology during the Preceramic period; and Ryan Williams (Northwestern University) who is in- vestigating early settlement patterns in the Ilo area. BOLIVIA. During the 1991 field season, the Proy- ecto Wila Jawira, a multidisciplinary archaeological project directed by Alan Kolata (University of Chicago [UC]) and Oswaldo Rivera (Instituto Nacional de Ar- queologia de Bolivia [INAR]) continued research at Tiwanaku and affiliated settlements and agricultural landscapes. The project is investigating the nature, scope, and variability of Tiwanaku's domestic occupa- tion, the spatial and structural associations between Tiwanaku's domestic and monumental architectural complexes, and the relations between this city and its sustaining hinterland. Ongoing interrelated research includes: regional survey, intensive mapping and ex- cavation programs at the site of Tiwanaku, paleoeco- logical research focused in the near-shore environment of Lake Titicaca, and experimental rehabilitation of raised agricultural fields. After four seasons of work, the topographic map of Tiwanaku was completed dur- ing the 1991 season. The map, covering some 8 km2, is now being compiled and rectified. Excavations at Tiwanaku during the 1991 season focused on a number of functionally distinct areas within the site. Domestic residences in the eastern sector of the site were exca- vated by John Janusck (UC), who also complemented his work at Tiwanaku with excavations of domestic structures at the secondary regional center of Lukur- mata. Janusck's excavations at Tiwanaku revealed long- term domestic occupation from the Tiwanaku III-V periods. Over 20 structures dating to Tiwanaku IV and V phase occupations have been uncovered in this sec- tor of the site to date, and ongoing spatial and artifac- tual analyses being conducted by Janusck suggest a broad spectrum of domestic household activities, in- cluding the production of small stone tools, weaving, and food preparation. At Lukurmata, Janusck's exca- vations uncovered substantial evidence of specialized household storage facilities and a workshop that was producing wind instruments (camelid bone flutes of various graduated sizes). At Tiwanaku, Claudia Rivera (INAR) and Sonia Al- conini (INAR) continued excavation of a ceramic workshop on the eastern periphery of the site and gen- erated substantial new information on ceramic pro- duction activities. Nicole Couture (UC) continued her work in the Mollo Kontu (southern) sector of the site, concentrating her activities on clearing sections of a small circular mound structure of apparent ceremonial function and an area of domestic refuse. A series of 16 human burials, dating to late in the site's history, were uncovered along the base of this mound structure. In work continuing from the 1990 season, Javier Esca- lante (INAR) excavated a series of architectural fea- tures set on an artificial terrace in the Lakarania (north- ern) sector of Tiwanaku. Ongoing specialized analyses of artifacts and eco- logical data include: ceramics (Cheryl Sutherland [UC] and Sonia Alconini [INAR]), faunal remains (Ann Webster [UC]), lithics (Martin Giesso [UC]), organic- residue and trace-element analysis (Michael March- banks [University of Wisconsin]), and paleoethnobo- tanical analysis (Melanie Wright [UM]). In addition Michael Binford (Harvard University) and Mark Brenner (University of Florida) continued laboratory analysis of sediment cores from Lake Ti- ticaca Tiwanaku raised agricultural fields in preparation for more intensive field investigations of long-term hu- man-environment interactions to commence in 1992. Kolata and Charles Ortloff (FMC Corporation) inves- tigated major canal and levee systems associated with Tiwanaku raised agricultural fields in the Pampa Koani and the Valley of Tiwanaku (Wafia Jawira System), and began work on analysis of agricultural terrace sys- tems that date principally to the post-Tiwanaku period. 160 [Vol. 58, No. 1, 1993]</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH Oswaldo Rivera continued to supervise a Bolivian team of agronomists working with experimental rehabilita- tion of raised fields. Finally, the summary of the systematic archaeolog- ical survey in the lower Tiwanaku Valley included in last year's Andean South America Current Research section failed to credit Juan Albarracin-Jordan (Insti- tuto Nacional de Arqueologia, La Paz) for this research. Albarracin-Jordan was the principal investigator re- sponsible for organizing and carrying out this impor- tant research project. [Assistant Editor Richard L. Bur- ger regrets this unfortunate omission and notes that a more detailed account of the Tiwanaku Valley findings have been published in Volume 1 of Asentamientos prehispdnicos del valle de Tiwanaku, 1990, which Al- barracin-Jordan coauthored with James Mathews.] Richard L. Burger SOUTHERN CONE With the death of Grete Mostny Glasser (1914-1991) in Santiago in January, 1991, the archaeological pro- fession lost a major contributor to our understanding of Chilean anthropology. Dr. Mostny was bom in Aus- tria and moved to Chile in 1939. She had, in effect, three careers, the first in archaeological research, the second in teaching at universities, and the third in museum administration (as director of the Museo Na- cional de Historia Natural [MNHN]). During her long, illustrious, and productive career, she worked with sev- eral outstanding foreign and national scholars, includ- ing Junius B. Bird, Osvaldo Menghin, Gustavo Le Paige, and Richard Schaedel and Jorje Iribarren, Carlos Mun- izaga, Hans Niemeyer, and Francisco Comely, respec- tively. Not only did she publish widely, but she intro- duced methods fully developed for carrying out substantial and effective archaeological research. Thanks to Mostny's years of tireless and persuasive work, the importance of professional archaeology in Chile now is understood widely. BOLIVIA. Eastern. From June to December, 1991, Donald Brockington (University of North Car- olina-Chapel Hill), David Pereira, Ram6n Sanzetenea, and Javier Gonzalez (all from the Universidad Mayor de San Simon) continued the Cochabamba Formative Period Project supported by a grant from the National Geographic Society. They conducted reconnaissance and test excavations in intermediate elevation valleys and the eastern lowlands, the Chapare region or south- western margin of the Amazon Basin. Forty-six sites, Archaic to Inka, were visited and four were tested. El Tambo, near Comarapa, proved to be an exclusively Mojocoya site with dates of 1850 ? 65 B.P. and 1650 ?+ 65 B.P. (GX- 17572/73), demonstrating that the style predates by several centuries the Tiwanaku expansion into Cochabamba. Laimina, near Pocona, yielded a date of 2290 ? 70 B.P. (GX-17574), probably marking the migration of Cochabamba Valley people into the southern region at a time when both regions underwent drastic depopulation. At Sehuencas, in the high cloud forest on a natural travel route between intermediate elevation valleys and the eastern lowlands, ceramics were in part identical to the undecorated Early and Middle Formative materials in the intermediate val- leys and in part quite similar to decorated eastern low- land ceramics. The Seheuncas dates are 2610 ? 80 B.P. and 2925 ? 70 B.P. (GX-17575/76). Tests at Valle Ibirza, in the Chapare 80 km east of Villa Tunari, encountered ceramics dated to 2430 + 65 B.P., 2810 ?70 B.P., and 2475 ? 70 B.P. (GX-17569/70/71). Like part of the Seheuncas ceramics, those from Valle Ibirza often were decorated by incision and punctation. The eastern lowland ceramics share numerous specific and similar attributes of decoration and vessel form with Formative traditions of eastern Peru and Ecuador and western Rondonia. The data tend to confirm a hypothesis of diffusion of at least ceramic attributes from the western Amazon Basin into southern Cocha- bamba between 1500 and 800 B.C. (based on corrected dates). ARGENTINA. Northwest. In 1992, the Proyecto Arqueolo6gico Calchaqui (PAC) continued its research into the effects of the Inka conquest on the economic organization of the Calchaqui Valley. This project is a collaborative effort conducted under the auspices of the Ministerio de Cultura y Educaci6n, Salta Province, and the Museo Arqueolo6gico de Cachi (Director, Pio Pablo Diaz). The primary research team includes Ana Maria Lorandi (Universidad de Buenos Aires [UBA]), Terrence D'Altroy (Columbia University), Christine Hastorf (University of Minnesota [UM]), Timothy Earle (University of California-Los Angeles), and Veronica Williams (UBA). PAC's fieldwork has focused on two principal elements: (1) mapping, surface collecting, and excavating in two Inka settlements; and (2) comparable work at two subject Santamariana settlements, deter- mined to be contemporaneous with the Inka sites on the basis of ceramic affiliations. The Inka settlement studied most intensively was the provincial center of Potrero de Payogasta (SSalCac 42), whereas the fortress of Cortaderas (SSalCac 65) was studied less intensively. The principal subject settlement investigated was Val- d6z (SSalCac 12). Puerta La Paya (SSalCac 1), a subject settlement with an intrusive sector and adjacent to an Inka installation, Guitlfn, was less intensively studied. Preliminary results of the project relate to subsis- tence activities, production of goods, and public and ceremonial activity. The two principal sites, Potrero de Payogasta and Vald&amp;z, yielded faunal assemblages that suggest differential use of animal resources. The recovered bones included canids (Canids familiaris), guinea pigs (Cavis sp.), and small rodents (Oryzomys sp.), along with armadillo scales (Family Dasypodi- dae). The contrasts between the two assemblages is indicative of differential access to food resources that likely reflects elevated state power in the region. With respect to botanical remains, the recovered taxa include amounts of domesticates such as maize (Zea mays), and quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa). There are also a few occurrences of legumes, tubers, and chili peppers. Spatial and contextual differences are appar- ent between the two major sites-Valdez and Potrero de Payogasta-indicating some types of differing ac- tivities. Valdez contained substantially more midden, 161</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY and consequently denser and more evenly distributed materials. Potrero de Payogasta has more defined floors and occupation areas, and hints that there may have been less maize production (shelling). There also is clear evidence for metallurgical pro- duction at both Potrero de Payogasta and Valdez. Per- tinent materials recovered from excavations include (1) slag, probably from smelting oxide ores, mostly malachite (copper carbonate); (2) crucibles encrusted with copper residues; (3) raw malachite ore; and (4) gold scrap (Ellen Howe [Metropolitan Museum of Art], personal communication 1991). In addition, the site of Potrero de Poyagasta yielded considerable evidence for manufacture of decorative objects in mica and less evidence for shellworking. Little evidence was found for production of utilitarian goods, apart from lithics. In sum, the evidence for production indicates that (1) specialized production occurred at the state center and subject settlement; (2) production at Vald6z focused on copper metallurgy and lapidary work, whereas pro- duction at Potrero de Payogasta included copper and gold metallurgy, and obsidian, mica, and shell pro- duction; (3) utilitarian production was conspicuous at Valdez, but virtually absent from Potrero de Payogasta. The clearest evidence for public and ceremonial con- sumption was recovered from Potrero de Poyagasta. Usnu and kallanka similar to those mapped at this site are noted historically and archaeologically for being foci of ceremonial activities. Excavations adjacent to the usnu yielded only low-density midden, however. In the kallanka, excavations were suspended after modem fetal and infant burials were encountered, in- dicative of local consideration of the structure as a sacred location (capilla). The best depositional evi- dence for public consumption was encountered in one of the two large, centrally located, circular structures. This structure yielded midden deposits with some ca- melid bone, but more importantly, a large subsurface Inka-style flared-rim jar of the type frequently used for chicha production and storage. The faunal assemblage from this site, as noted above, is also characteristic of herd-management practices in which animals were culled and slaughtered at prime meat weight, as might be expected for state-sponsored feasts. Rodolfo Raffino (Museo Nacional de La Plata [MNLP]) and his colleagues Ricardo Alvis, Axel Niel- sen, Jorje Palma, Adriana Callegari, Anahi Iacona, Ay- len Caparelli, Victoria Garcia Montes, Maria M. Tod- dere, Alberto Manso, and Jose Gian Cristofero (all from the MNLP) continued their archaeological in- vestigations in the highlands of Catamarca, with em- phasis on the large Inka site of Shincal. The research team also is studying Inka sites in other areas of north- west Argentina, in addition to the southern Bolivian altiplano. Twelve Inka sites were reported in the Po- tosti and Oruro areas of Bolivia. Two sites, Oma Proco near Lake Poop6 and Cherquiago in the San Juan Mayo Valley, are large administrative centers dating between approximately A.D. 1470 and 1535. Most recently, the team investigated the eastern frontier of the Inka state in Humahuaca, in search of the Inka-Guarani contact zone. The presence of Inka facilities in the area doc- uments a strong state presence. The most notable site is La Huerta, which contains more than 600 architec- tural structures, suggesting that it too was an admin- istrative center. Raffino is also working closely with Chilean colleagues to contrast Inka occupation on the eastern and western flanks of the Andes along an east to west Copiap6 to Catamarca transect. Patagonia. Cecilia Perez de Micou (CONICET- UBA) continued her work with the Proyecto de Rescate Arqueolo6gico in Chubut Province. Recent research has focused on microbotanical remains recovered from early hunting-gathering sites, as well as historic Araucanian and Tehuelche settlements. Part of her study entailed a comparative analysis of modern and archaeological hearth structure and content. Three distinct types of hearths have been identified: (1) drying or heat-treating pits; (2) smoke-signal pits for long-distance commu- nication; and (3) cooking and heating pits. Each is as- sociated with distinctive types of firewood that can be recognized archaeologically, if carbonized or burned wood is preserved. Perez de Micou and Elena Ancibor are preparing a comparative collection of firewood from the Chubut area. CHILE. Extreme North. Juan M. Chacama (Universidad de Tarapacf [UT]) has initiated a study of religious architecture in the puna and highlands of northern Chile. Specific attention is given to the stone- work and facing of Catholic churches in the Iquique and Parinacota areas. Chacama also is involved in an analysis of the public's perception of anthropological museums and the role of museums in expressing mul- tiethnic identities. Also located in extreme northern Chile is Ivan Mu- fioz Ovalle (UT) who is constructing a lithic typology for the Acha-2 preceramic site, where workshops and activity areas have been excavated. Mufioz also is car- rying out survey of late ceramic period sites (A.D. 1000- 1450) in the delta of the Camarones Valley. In 1990 and 1991, Mario Rivera (Field Museum of Chicago), Arthur Aufderheide (UM), Marc Kelley (UM), and Alvaro Carevic (Universidad Arturo Prat-Iqui- que) conducted paleonutritional and archaeological studies at Chinchorro III and Alto Ramirez I sites in the Iquique area. Also, in 1991, Rivera, Carevic, and Greg Graffam (University of Trent) conducted archaeological survey in the northern coastal Atacama Desert. The objective was to locate residential sites of the Alto Ramirez phase. The Ramaditas site was surveyed and mapped in de- tail, with specific attention given to mound structures and areas of mineral production. In 1991, Mario Orellana (Universidad de Chile [UC]) and Agustin Llagostera M. (Universidad del Norte) continued their investigation of materials excavated at the agricultural site of Colar in San Pedro de Atacama, for the purpose of confirming the cultural stratigraphy. This work also led to the definition of discrete subsec- tors within the site, as well as for the social and eco- nomic organization. They report that the architecture is characterized by semicircular and circular rooms. Ceramic styles and other diagnostic indicators suggest that Colar dates around 150 B.C. Norte Chico. Hans Niemeyer F. (Sociedad Chilena de Arqueolo6gia [SCA]), Miguel Cervellino and Gaston Castillo (Museo Arqueolo6gico de Copiap6), and Loreto 162 [Vol. 58, No. 1, 1993]</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT RESEARCH Sole (SCA) concentrated their investigation in Cabra Atada and Punta Brava in the Copiap6 Valley. The earliest site in Cabra Atada exhibits hillside platforms and retention walls, and numerous earthen burial mounds (tumulos). Burials are flexed and associated with a variety of grave furniture, including tembetas and ceramic cups. Tumulos 1 and 4 warrant specific attention. Tumulo 1 measures approximately 88 m2 in size and contains a mortuary "firepit" aligned with stones. Below the firepit were located three burials in the deeper strata of the mound. One skeleton was a male associated with copper ornaments and a tembeta. A young camelid, probably offered as a sacrificial vic- tim, rested beside the male. An infant burial was the third burial. Tumulo 1 dates around A.D. 400. Tumulo 4 contained three human skeletons associated with var- ious offerings. Located near the mounds is a later site, El Pedregal, characterized by 30 subterranean habita- tional structures and storage units. This type of struc- ture continues into the late ceramic period, which is best known at the large urban center of Iglesia Colo- rado, an Inka-Diaguita site. Quebrada Punta Brava contains a pucara with de- fensive walls. Located below the fortress are 60 circular and subrectangular compounds containing Punta Bra- va ceramics. Inka-Diaguita sherds were recovered from a nearby hillside covered with habitational platforms. This site is dominated, however, by a large Inka patio. Evidence of colonial period occupation also is present. Francisco Gallardo (Museo Chileno de Arte Pre- Colombino [MCAP]), Luis Cornejo (MCAP), Alvaro Roman (Pontificia Universidad de Chile [PUC]), and Angel Deza (PUC) began archaeological investigations in the Quillagua oasis where the late Ricardo Latcham excavated more than 70 Prehispanic tombs in the 1930s. Recent excavations in one residential site, La Capilla, reveal a long habitational sequence from middle Ti- wanaku (A.D. 710 ? 70) to Inka times. A series of thermoluminescence (TL) dates on ceramics from the site and, especially, from a "cementerio poniente" date from ca. A.D. 200 ? 70 to 1315 ? 70. Based on these data, a preliminary chronology defined by four Pre- hispanic cultural periods is proposed. Central Valley. Since 1989, Luis Cornejo (MCAP) and Javier A. Simonetti (MCAP) have studied the Pre- hispanic cultural ecology of precordilleran societies in the central valley. To date, 19 open-air, rockshelter, and other sites have been recorded. Radiocarbon dates from these sites range from 8,900 to 1,520 years ago. Recent excavations were carried out at the Los Azules site, located in the upper Rio Maipo drainage, where an early ceramic occupation was defined. Nearby were two large rectangular structures (50 x 2.5 m) and the Aguilakuyuy site, which contains several subterranean structures containing lithic waste debris. For several years, Ruben Stehberg (MNHN) has car- ried out archaeological and ethnohistorical investiga- tions at Cerro La Compafiia, a fortified pre-Inka and Inka hill site, strategically located between Angostura de Paine and the Cachapoal River in the Rancagua Valley. Recent excavations confirm pre-Inka construc- tion of the fortress by the Promaucae culture between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries A.D. The site was modified and occupied later by the Inka when they expanded southward through the central valley. Spe- cifically, the fortress is characterized by three defensive walls that circle the hill at different elevations. A court- yard divided by internal walls and the primary Inka structure are located on a flattened hilltop. The latest work has documented a large number of architectural structures thought to be collcas. Both the defensive walls and collcas are assigned to the Inka period, on the basis of a series of TL dates derived from associated ceramics, ranging from A.D. 1430 ? 60 to A.D. 1530 ?+ 45. Stehberg also reports the recovery of a pre-Inka residential compound and storage area on a lower slope of the hill. The architectural styles, ceramic types, and TL dates associated with these structures (A.D. 1310 + 75; 1380 + 80; 1440 ? 60; 1450 ? 50) indicate a late pre-Inka occupation. Based on these findings, he estimates that the Inka arrived in central Chile around A.D. 1450. In the sixteenth century, Cerro La Com- pafnia was utilized by indigenous groups to resist Span- ish colonization. Ethnohistorical documentation sug- gests that the fortress was defended by cacique Cachapoal from A.D. 1540 to 1541, at which time he was defeated by Pedro de Valdivia. The Cerro La Com- pafnia project is funded by the Fondo de Ciencia y Tecnologia (FONDECYT Grant No. 0316190). Also in 1992, Stehberg and his Argentine colleagues continued their study of Inka roads transversing the Chilean and Argentine mountains between the Huasco River to the north and the Aconcagua River to the south. Fieldwork has included survey in previously unexplored high elevation zones and excavation of structures located along the roads. Laboratory analysis of recovered materials is currently underway. Prelim- inary results suggest that the roads were not built along the entire length of the primary valleys (Huasco, Elqui, and Choapa), but in secondary tributaries. Lateral roads located in these areas were connected to the main north- to-south trending road at an elevation between ap- proximately 2,000 and 4,000 m asl. These data coupled with those collected previously reveal a repetitive Inka plan of isolating local native populations by controlling their access to higher-elevation resources (e.g., grass- lands, minerals, camelids), all of which facilitated con- quest and expansion by the state. Stehberg believes that each lateral road initially represented a temporary fron- tier of state expansion southward. He hypothesizes that the Chilean side of the Andes was controlled admin- istratively by large settlements (Shinkal and Tamberia del Inka) located at the headwaters of Argentine rivers. A series of TL dates obtained from Inka ceramics ex- cavated at Chilean sites suggest an Inka presence be- tween ca. A.D. 1400 and 1450 in the Huasco and Choa- pa valleys, which are located several hundred kilometers north of the Rancagua Valley. Fernanda Falabella (UC) and her associates, Alvaro Roman, Angel Deza, and Eliana Almendras (UC), are conducting detailed technological and stylistic analyses of ceramics from several sites, beginning with collec- tions of Llolleo culture materials. Ethnographic models and statistical studies are applied to classify the col- lections. Eight different forms and 2-3 size modes have been defined. Preliminary results suggest that sym- metrically shaped vessels are used for drinking and asymmetrical vessels for heating food and for consum- 163</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ing beverages. Large vessels were probably used to store items. Large, narrow-necked vessels were best for cook- ing, and wide-necked ones for processing foods. Little variation was observed in ceramic paste and temper. Thermal-mechanical studies also revealed lit- tle variation except for peat-tempered vessels, which were more porous and conducted less heat. In general, all ceramic vessels show use wear. Four different types of use wear are defined: isolated marks, eroded sur- faces, burned areas, and heating scars. Burial urns show previous use, suggesting they were recycled. Only pol- ished blackware jars and anthropomorphic vessels show no evidence of burning. Small bottles exhibit erosion and use along the tips, suggesting drinking. Jars show more use on inside walls, suggesting cooking. In sum- mary, the research shows a strong functional correla- tion between vessel form and type and location of use wear. Fernanda Falabella also is working with Roberto Melendez and Loreto Vargas (UC) to develop com- parative collections and interdisciplinary methods to analyze archaeological maritime fishbones. Ecological, anatomical, and contextual studies are underway along the central coast of Chile. Eventually, qualitative and quantitative indexes will be formulated for the purpose of identifying and interpreting maritime archaeological context and, more specifically, for carrying out species- level analysis. Eliana Durin S. (MNHN) and Arturo Rodriquez 0. (SCA) are investigating Prehispanic Aconcagua cultur- al adaptations to contiguous ecological zones in the Chacabuco area. Several large residential sites are un- der study, including La Victoria 1 and 2, Parcela Que- brada Los Maquis, Asentamiento El Collique, and El Paso del Buey (a tumulo cemetery site). Preliminary results suggest that inhabitants of the site practiced agriculture (maize, beans, other seed crops) and pas- toralism. A large quantity of camelid bones indicates the use of animals as beasts of burden and as a food supply. Duran S. and Rodriquez 0. report that resi- dential sites are located along waterways, and tumulos cemeteries are situated in distant areas. Excavation in the cemeteries reveals distinct burial and construction episodes. The presence of fragmented ceramics, secondary burials, animal bones, and thin lenses of charcoal suggest ritual activity associated with feasting and perhaps animal sacrifice. An earlier cul- tural phase (El Bato tradition) also has been defined. The presence of classic Diaguita ceramics also suggests contacts with populations to the north and later with the Inka. Araucania. Marco Sanch&amp;z A. and Hector Zumae- ta Zufiiga (Museo Regional de la Araucania) have re- ceived a grant from FONDECYT to document and catalog archaeological and ethnographic collections of the Mapuche and Prehispanic cultures of south-central Chile. This is the first project of its kind funded by FONDECYT. Tom D. Dillehay (University of Kentucky/Univer- sidad Austral de Chile) and Ximena Navarro (SCA) initiated an ethnoarchaeological study of the exploi- tation of marine resources among Mapuche lineages. The objective of the study is to document past and present subsistence and settlement patterns and to study the socioeconomic and natural processes determining specific site location, content, and integrity. Canals. Due to the 1990 eruption of Hudson vol- cano, located in the upper Ibafiez River in the archi- pelagos, Francisco Mena (MCAP) and Carlos Ocampo (MCAP) postponed their archaeological investigation of open-air occupation sites. The objective of the re- search has now changed to focus on (1) depositional characteristics of the recent eruption, (2) the impact of lava and ash deposits on archaeological sites, and (3) modem and Prehispanic human settlement patterns in impacted areas. Mena and Ocampo also are working with Argentine colleagues, who are concerned with similar problems on the eastern side of the Andes, in order to standardize research issues and methods. They also report results of their analysis of archaeological materials recovered from previous excavation at Alero Fontana, a large habitational site dating to approxi- mately 5000 B.P. Subsistence and settlement-pattern analyses, coupled with micro-use-wear study of lithics, suggest intermittent occupation of the site by a spe- cialized group of huemul (small deer) hunters. Tom D.
