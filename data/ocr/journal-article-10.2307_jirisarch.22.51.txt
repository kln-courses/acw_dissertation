Their precise function is unclear and has been the subject of protracted debate. Until fairly recently, a consensus appears to have held that, owing to the inherent weakness of their hafting, halberds were primarily intended for some ceremonial rather than practical purpose. However, an Irish example, discovered complete with its wooden shaft and which therefore played a pivotal role in these deliberations, may have proved inadvertently misleading. Second only to swords, halberds are one of the marked on the first edition of the six-inch Ordnancemost prolific of all Bronze Age weapons Survey map and was used as a triangulation point.

Carn Monument, as this common from Scandinavia to southern Iberia, with collection of features came to be known, is the highest over 600 known examples (O’Flaherty 2002, 423). For point in a boggy region where peat-cutting had been many, however, halberds do not sit comfortably in the practised for many years.

The blade remained ‘unwieldy-looking’ (Thorpe 2013, 235).

Illustrations of this piece by both Harbison (1969, pl. 8) and Raftery (1942, 55) show an unhafted blade with a roughly semicircular butt. Raftery includes longitudinal detail of one of the three large, dome- headed fastening rivets, suggesting a shaft head thickness of approximately 20mm. Presumably Harbison’s drawing was based on Raftery’s work, executed prior to the fitting of the reproduction shaft. Raftery (1951, 143) published an illustration of the ‘complete’ Carn halberd with the caption, ‘Bronze halberd mounted on a copy of its original wooden handle’. Harbison reproduced this illustration twice: in 1969 (fig. 4B), describing it as ‘showing a copy of the original wooden handle’ which ‘has only survived’ in this single instance, and again in 1988 (fig. 70), referring to it as an ‘intact example’. Vandkilde and Northover (1996, 194) also reproduced Raftery’s illustration, describing it as ‘showing a copy of the original wooden handle’ and extrapolating that Danish halberds may have been hafted in a similar fashion. Writing of Dutch halberds, Fontijn (2002, 71) referred to Harbison’s 1988 illustration of Raftery’s ‘completely preserved’ Carn halberd and noted that such weapons ‘do not seem to be very practical’. Skak-Nielsen (2009, 355) also reproduced Raftery’s illustration for his work on Danish halberds, stating that ‘one of Ireland’s halberds still retains its wooden shaft’. In reference to Italian halberds, Cornaggia Castiglioni (1972, 252–4) reiterated, on the basis of the Carn example, Ó Ríordáin’s (1937, 241) views regarding the fragility of these weapons. More recently, Brandherm and O’Flaherty (2001, 58) also refer to Raftery and the Carn halberd’s ‘surviving shaft’.  Photo of reconstructed Carn halberd.

In particular, he was of the view that the blades of wooden-shafted examples, such as those found in Ireland, could easily have been detached, while German metal-shafted halberds were Illustration of the reconstructed Carn manufactured from bronze with levels of tin that halberd (Harbison 1969, fig. 4A). rendered them impractically brittle. Since its discovery, the Carn halberd has been held to validate the ‘ritual use’ hypothesis, with Ó Ríordáin (1946, 155) proposing that ‘the slender shaft shown in the reconstruction of the Carn halberd also argues against its effectiveness’. He then goes on to dismiss any discussion of how halberds might have been used against or in conjunction with shields, on the grounds that the latter did not make their début in the archaeological record until the late Bronze Age. This would appear to be a direct rebuttal of Raftery’s (1942) suggestion that the halberd might have been wielded with one hand while a shield was held in the other. While it has become clear that shields came into use in Ireland well before the beginning of the late Bronze Age, there is still no evidence for their use early enough to match conclusively the current dating of Irish halberds to the third and the very beginning of the second millennium BC (Uckelmann 2012, 158). Many more have relied directly or indirectly on the proportions of the Carn halberd to demonstrate this class of weapon’s inherent weakness (Harbison 1969, 39–41; Cornaggia Castiglioni 1972, 252–4; Vandkilde and Northover 1996, 194; Fontijn 2002, 71; Skak-Nielsen 2009, 355). Some have argued for a purely ceremonial or ritual use (Butler 1963, 11; Mallory and McNeill 1991, 102). Others have made more practical use of its form in the field of experimental archaeology. Although the morphology of metal-shafted halberds from central Europe and rock-art illustrations were also taken into consideration, this particular halberd, notwithstanding the known shortcomings of its reconstructed handle (O’Flaherty, Rankin et al. 2002, 32; O’Flaherty 2002, 166), was considered during the design of a replica produced by O’Flaherty (2007, 424) to assess the practical effectiveness of this style of weapon. While many appear to have lost sight of the fact that the shaft of the Carn halberd held by the National Museum was actually a replica, remarkably few can have appreciated a much more fundamental error in turning to this piece as any sort of blueprint for practice or principle Photo of pickaxe relating to real halberds. handle. During his time on the staff at the National Museum, Etienne Rynne appended a note, dated February 1962, to the file of the Carn halberd recording his concerns over the veracity of its </page> <page sequence="4"> Bell and Brandherm_O’Flaherty.qxd  17/09/2014  14:46  Page 54 54 David Bell and Dirk Brandherm Halberd-brandishing rock-art figure from the Vallée des Merveilles in the Mont Bégo region of the Southern Alps (after Dufrenne 1995, fig. 4). reconstruction (Barry 2012).
