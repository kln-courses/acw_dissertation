Verbin Received: 5 July 2012 / Accepted: 16 August 2012 / Published online: 14 September 2012 © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012 Abstract Believers regularly refer to God as "forgiving and merciful" when praying for divine forgiveness. If one is committed to divine immutability and impassability, as Maimonides is, one must deny that God is capable, in principle, of acting in a forgiving manner. If one rejects divine impassability, maintaining that God has a psy chology, as Muffs does, one must reckon with biblical depictions of divine vengeance and rage. Such depictions suggest that while being capable, in principle, of acting in a forgiving way, God has a difficulty to manage God's anger and do so in practice. Employing a Wittgensteinian perspective, I argue that utterances, e.g., "God merci ful and gracious, slow to anger... forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin", need not be understood as involving mistaken or confused descriptions of God's nature and manner of acting. Rather, they can be understood as speech-acts of various types and functions: mystical, theurgic and others, that purport to bring about or transform various states of affairs in this world and/or beyond it. As such, they can function as non-semantic instruments that purport to elevate the believer to the "upper worlds", or as anger-management devices that purport to help God implement His second order desire to act in a forgiving manner, despite His difficulty to do so.

The paper has three parts. In the first part, I discuss the nature of forgiveness, arguing that overcoming resentment plays a central role in processes of forgiveness; in the second, I discuss logical and empirical difficulties that are involved in the concept of divine forgiveness, using two opposing theologies, using Maimonides and Yochanan Muffs; in the third and last part I show that although such theologies render problematic various phrases that are uttered in prayers for forgive ness, believers are neither confused nor mistaken when uttering these phrases in their prayers and may, therefore, continue to pray and continue to seek God's forgiveness. The nature of forgiveness is highly disputed among philosophers. Philosophical accounts, however, often emphasize three components: (1) Overcoming hostile emo tions toward the wrongdoer; (2) A change of heart toward the wrongdoer, which goes beyond the cessation of hostile emotions and involves the acquisition of a more positive outlook or attitude toward the wrongdoer, and, (3) A willingness to restore the relation ship and proceed toward reconciliation (Murphy and Hampton 1988; Roberts 1995; Garrard and McNaughton 2003; Griswold 2007). In what follows, I shall focus solely on the first component. I shall do so for the following reasons: (1) There is widespread agreement among philosophers that this is a highly central feature of forgiveness (Griswold 2007; Bennett 2003; Roberts 1995; Murphy and Hampton 1988; Butler 1896); (2) I do not believe that either the second or the third components are necessary features of forgiveness. I have elsewhere argued that coming to see the wrongdoer in a more favorable light and being willing to be reconciled with him or her are mere contingent features of forgiveness (Verbin 2010); (3) be that as it may, the second feature of forgiveness does not seem prima facie less problematic for an account of "divine forgiveness" since it seems to involve an initially partial judgment of the wrongdoer (Minas 1975); and, (4) although the third feature may seem more promising for an attempted analysis of "divine forgiveness" it blurs the logical distinction between "forgiveness" and "reconciliation". As has been argued, reconciliation need not involve forgiveness and forgiveness need not be followed by reconciliation (Govier 2002; Verbin 2010). Thus, I shall focus on the overcoming of resentment in processes of forgiveness. ' Exodus 34, pp. 6-7. It is uttered in the "Tachnun", during the Jewish morning and afternoon prayers, as well as during certain periods and certain holidays. 2 "Amidah" Jewish prayer, uttered three times a day. 3 Anglican prayer of penitence.

For the purpose of this paper, which is concerned solely with divine forgiveness, I shall assume Murphy's conception of mercy as having to do with the infliction on a wrongdoer, of "a less harsh consequence ... than is allowed by institutional (usually legal) rules..." (Murphy 2003, p. 14). See also Murphy and Hampton (1988). I shall discuss the nature of forgiveness in the first part of the paper. Springer</page><page sequence="3">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:181-199 183 Resentment, anger, indignation and moral hatred characterize our emotional responses to wrongdoing. These emotions may be bundled up together in a single victim. It is, however, useful to tell them apart.5 I shall follow Hampton and perceive resentment as "an emotion whose object is the defiant reaffirmation of one's rank and value in the face of treatment calling them into question in one's own mind" (Hampton 1988, pp. 59-60). Resentment involves: (1) Fear that the insulter has acted permissi bly. This fear can be analyzed as involving some degree of belief that the insulter is right to treat the victim as low in rank and value, and a wish that the belief is not true; and, (2) an act of defiance against the belief that the wrongdoer has acted permissibly (Hampton 1988, p. 57). As a way of fighting a personal insult directed at oneself, as a way of defying treatment that calls into question one's self-worth in one's own mind, resentment is internally related to the victim's sense of humiliation. As such, it is a reaction that is characteristic of the victim, qua victim.6 Unlike resentment, which is limited in scope, blame, indignation and moral hatred are emotional responses that characterize both victims and non-victims who care about the moral value that has been violated. I follow Hampton and maintain that blame and indignation are types of "emotional protest against immoral treatment whose object is the defense of the value which ... [an] action violated..." (Hampton 1988, p. 59) and do not involve self doubts about one's self-worth. Blame and indignation are directed at the immoral act. Moral hatred is directed at the person who has committed the immoral act: it is "an aversion to someone who has identified himself with an immoral cause or practice ... accompanied by a wish to triumph over him and his cause or practice, in the name of some fundamental moral principle or objective..." (Hampton 1988, p. 61 ). Thus, I maintain that while victims may and do characteristically express a higher degree of blame, indignation and moral hatred toward their wrongdoers, they also respond in a manner that is specific to them, qua victims, i.e., with resentment. If, as a matter of logic, one cannot forgive a wrongdoer for a wrong that he had inflicted upon someone else, if the victim only is logically able to forgive the one who had wronged him then it is those reactions and responses that are characteristic of vic tims, qua victims, that have to be overcome in processes of forgiveness. Overcoming resentment rather than indignation or moral hatred must, therefore, play a central role in processes of forgiveness. As Murphy, Hampton and others point out, the resentful victim feels threatened by the humiliating message that is conveyed by his attack, worrying that he is worthy of the humiliating treatment that he is receiving. If the victim's resentment is a personal defense against the humiliating message and a defiant reaffirmation of his value, then the victim cannot have too low or too high a sense of his self-worth. A victim with a very low sense of self-worth, who fully accepts the humiliating message, believing that when we suffer harm by means of another, "we have to believe that it has not lowered us, but has revealed our true level" (Weil 1987, p. 5), could not resent his wrongdoer nor could he forgive him. Perceiving the attack as consistent with his low 5 For a different account of the nature of these emotions and their inter-relations, see Griswold (2007). 6 Maintaining that only victims (or those that are very closely related to them, such as their family members) are resentful toward their wrongdoers, I am in disagreement with others, e.g., Bishop Butler and Griswold. See Butler (1896), Griswold (2007). 'S Springer</page><page sequence="4">184 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:181-199 self-worth, such a victim could not see the wrong as a wrong, which violates his rights, humiliates him and diminishes him. From his perspective, there is nothing to forgive.7 A victim with a very high sense of self-worth, who fully rejects the humiliating message, could feel indignation and moral hatred. Being confident about his self worth, however, such a victim could not feel humiliated by the wrongdoer, diminished or resentful toward him, too. Such a victim would respond to the wrong as if it had involved someone other than himself. He could not, therefore, overcome his resent ment and forgive the wrongdoer. Thus, the victim who can overcome his resentment in forgiveness has an average conception of his self-worth; he does not completely reject nor does he completely endorse the humiliating message that is conveyed by the wrong; rather, he "converses" with it, entertains it and feels threatened by it. In Hampton's terminology, such a victim partially accepts the humiliating message that is conveyed by the wrong. Roberts' conception of the emotions sheds light on what the victim's "partial accep tance" of the humiliating message may involve. Roberts conceives of the emotions as perceptual states, analogous to "aspect perceptions", to the states that we are in when we view gestalt figures in psychology books, when we hear a melody as sad, see a shape as hanging from the sky, etc (Roberts 1995, p. 290). Relying on Roberts's con ception of the emotions we may conceive of the resentful victim who partially accepts the humiliating message as perceiving himself in terms of two different judgments: one which asserts his high self-worth and status, in terms of some of his characteris tics, achievements or assets, and another, which asserts his low self-worth and status in terms of other characteristics that he has, which he grasps in relation to the wrong. Perceiving himself alternately through one or the other, the victim may be said to "partially accept" the humiliating message, while resentfully attempting to fight it off.8 If the victim's resentment involves his partial acceptance of the humiliating mes sage, his seeing himself in terms of alternating judgments concerning his high/low self-worth, then his overcoming his resentment must involve his coming to see him self, primarily, by means of his judgment concerning his high self-worth. In other words, overcoming resentment in forgiveness involves a shift in the victim's percep tion of himself. Certain features of himself, which had seemed salient, which had grounded his lower sense of self-worth, his humiliation and sense of diminishment now seem peripheral. The victim comes to see himself primarily by means of his strengths, his achievements, his moral nature, intellect, his harmonious relationships etc. Seeing himself, primarily, by means of these facts, he can see himself, primarily, by means of his perspectival judgment concerning his high self-worth. He can then overcome his resentment and forgive the wrongdoer.9 7 For a helpful discussion of the role of one's sense of self-worth in one's manner of responding to wrong doing, see Hampton (1988, pp. 43-53). 8 There are various differences, however, between Roberts' conception of forgiveness and my own. See Verbin 2010. 9 Various factors of various types can help the victim in this process of overcoming resentment: distance in time from the assault, psychotherapeutic treatment, learning about the wrongdoer's suffering, repentance or punishment, etc. These helpful factors, however, play a mere contingent role in forgiveness. £l Spri nger</page><page sequence="5">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:181 -199 185 In light of the above, what could "God merciful and gracious, slow to anger... for giving iniquity and transgression and sin" mean? Can God's forgiveness be understood by means of an analogy with inter-personal human forgiveness? Approaching "divine forgiveness" via the first feature is casting God in the role of the victim who suffers certain types of harm. What types of harm might these be? Murphy distinguishes between tangible, sensible types of harm and intangible ones. The latter have to do with the disrespectful symbolic features of an offense, with the demeaning message that it implicitly conveys ("I can use you for my purposes"; "you are not worthy of better treatment", etc.). Murphy states: "[Ijntentional wrongdoing insults us and attempts (sometimes successfully) to degrade us—and thus it involves a kind of injury that is not merely tangible and sensible (Murphy 1988, p. 25). Garrard and McNaughton refer to the intangible aspects of the harm as a "wrong" (Garrard and McNaughton, 2003, pp. 47-48). They point out that when human beings are wronged, they normally have two grounds of complaint: the tangible harm, the loss and damage that they suffer (physical damage, financial damage etc.), and the failure to show them respect, the failure to treat them according to their rights. They emphasize that wronging someone, in itself, amounts to a harm. Hampton and Bennett refer to the "wrong" as an "insult" (i.e., an inappropriate act of disrespect). They consider blame and indignation appropriate responses to it, shown by those who suffer the insult and by others who do not but who nevertheless, perceive the wrong as a violation of a person's right to be treated respectfully. Hampton and Bennett point out that the person who suffers the insult may further believe that the "insult" has reduced his status and self-worth, that it has in fact degraded him, diminished his value. As Bennett points out: "The wrongdoing can, as a matter of psychological fact, distort your view of yourself..(Bennett, 2003, p. 137). As such, the wrongdoing constitutes a psychological harm. In this case, the victim characteristically comes to resent the wrongdoer: perceiving the wrong as a degradation (rather than as a mere insult), the victim fears that the insulter has acted permissibly; he has some degree of belief that the insulter is right to treat him as low in rank and value; at the same time he wishes that it is not true, and defies that belief. In other words, the resentful victim characteris tically perceives the wrong that he had suffered as a degrading insult (Hampton 1988). As a non-corporeal agent, God cannot suffer a tangible sensible harm. He can, however, suffer a "wrong". He can be addressed or responded to disrespectfully. The "wrong" may function, at least as far as the logical analysis of the moral concepts involved is concerned, either as an "insult", as an act of disrespect, or as a degra dation, a disrespectful act which diminishes what God is owed, either in God's own self-understanding, or in others view of him. Thus, God's "victimhood" may have to do with either of the following: (1) with his having been treated disrespectfully, but without his having suffered any further harm beyond the insult, or, (2) with a more substantial sense of victimhood, which involves an insult and a psychological harm, i.e., divine self-doubt as to God's value, status or self-worth, which has to do with God's conception of the insult as a degradation, or (3) an even more substantial sense Springer</page><page sequence="6">186 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:181-199 of victimhood, which involves an insult, psychological harm and an actual diminish ment in God's value or status. If my account of forgiveness is correct, and forgiveness necessarily involves over coming resentment, i.e., necessarily involves a victim who suffered a psychological harm, then God's victimhood must be more substantial than the mere suffering of an insult. God must view the insult as a degrading insult, worrying that it had diminished him; He must come to doubt his self-worth and resent the agent who had performed the wrong against him, to be logically capable of forgiveness.10 This discussion raises various questions. '11 shall focus on the following two clusters of questions: ( 1 ) Is it possible to perceive God as a victim who suffers a psychological harm? Is it possible to understand God as a potentially resentful agent who worries that certain "insults" diminish him, perceiving them as a degradation? Can God, in principle, feel resentment? and, (2) if God can suffer a psychological harm, if God, in principle, can feel resentment, does he have a tendency to overcome it? Does God have a forgiving nature, a forgiving personality? I shall use two opposing theologians to address these questions: Maimonides and Muffs. The two thinkers are separated by almost 900 years. They are conceptually dis parate too, occupying the extreme ends of a spectrum on how to understand the biblical narrative and the "grammar" of the religious utterances that it contains. Despite the historical and conceptual disparity, their views play a dominant role in Jewish thinking, outlining the two most central strands in Jewish thought, the philosophical one (with Maimonides as its clearest representative) and the mythical one (with Muffs, as one of its most creative recent representatives). Moreover, despite the disparity, each of them, in his own way, directs us away from the surface grammar of utterances, such as "merciful and always ready to forgive" that are applied to God. In so doing, each of them helps to move the discussion forward, toward the Wittgensteinian emphasis of the logical, "grammatical" relation between religious utterances and the practices in which they are embedded. Maimonides does so openly and explicitly; Muffs does so inadvertently.12 I shall start with Maimonides. Maimonides Maimonides seems to be committed to the existence of an eternal, immutable, incor poreal, simple and perfect being: "there is a perfect being, who is neither a body nor 10 I do not believe that it is helpful to construe "divine forgiveness" in such a manner. I merely wish to explicate the consequences of a certain view of language, which disregards the significance of the context in which a concept is used for a determination of its meaning, for the concept of "divine forgiveness". In other words, I do not believe that it is useful to understand "divine forgiveness" by means of an analogy with inter-personal human forgiveness, which involves our casting God in the role of the victim in the aforementioned sense. For more, see section "III" of this paper. 1 ' For an enlightening discussion of various other difficulties pertaining to the concept of "divine forgive ness" see, e.g., Minas ( 1975, pp. 138-150). 12 For more, see the third part of this paper. This paper focuses on the Jewish context. A comparative, Jew ish-Christian study can greatly benefit from an examination of Aquinas's analogia entis and its implications to the concept of "divine forgiveness". See, Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica (London and New York: Blackfriars in conjunction with Eyre and Spottiswoode, and McGraw-Hill Book Company), la question 13. ö Springer</page><page sequence="7">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:181-199 187 a force in a body, and ... He is the deity... no sort of deficiency and therefore no affection whatever can attain Him." (Maimonides 1/35 p. 80); and: "God, may He be honored and magnified, is not a body or subject to affections. For affection is a change and He, may He be exalted, is not touched by change." (Maimonides 1/35 p. 81). In Maimonides's view, God has no feelings, passions, emotions or sensations. He is immutable and impassable. God's immutability has to do with God's perfection. Whatever changes acquires something new. God cannot acquire anything new, since God cannot be better or more complete or more perfect than He is, nor can an eternal God diminish in perfection and cease to be God. If God is immutable, God cannot suffer harm or injury of any sort. He cannot be affected in any way by what human beings do or refrain from doing. He cannot be a "victim" in any substantial sense. It, thus, follows that God cannot, in princi ple, feel resentful nor can he overcome his resentment in forgiveness. God's inability to forgive is a logical one. In principle, neither the act of "forgiving" nor the ten dency to "forgive", or the attribute of "forgivingness", (or their opposites) can be applied to God in their ordinary sense. The attempt to ascribe such a manner of acting, such a tendency or an attribute to God is fundamentally confused, in Maimonides's view. Moreover, from a Maimonidean perspective, the confusion in attributing forgiv ingness or any other attribute to God is a deep and serious one. Maimonides believes that nothing can be said about God as He is in Himself; no positive attribute can be ascribed to Him. God cannot be said to have a forgiving or an unforgiving nature. Even "existence" cannot be applied to God.13 Maimonides provides several arguments for the strict limitations that he imposes on religious discourse, which have to do with his conceptions of logic, language, and their relation to the world. Maimonides believes that an attribute may be one of two things: It is either the essence of the thing of which it is predicated, in which case it is an explanation of a term... Or the attribute is different from the thing of which it is predicated, being a notion superadded to that thing. This would lead to the con clusion that that attribute is an accident belonging to that essence (Maimonides 1/51, p. 113). For Maimonides, the essence of a thing, which gives us its definition, provides the explanation of an item in terms of its location in the inventory of beings. It always involves genus and specific difference. It involves reference to the item's causes. Maimonides, thus, concludes: This kind of attribute should be denied to God according to everybody. For He, may He be exalted, has no causes anterior to Him that are the cause of His exis tence and by which, in consequence, He is defined. For this reason it is well known among all people engaged in speculation, who understand what they say, that God cannot be defined (Maimonides 1/52, pp. 114-115). For more on Maimonides's views on religious discourse see Verbin 2011 &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="8">188 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:181-199 An attribute that signifies an essential or accidental quality of an item too, cannot be attributed to God since "if He has a part of an essence, His essence must be composite" (Maimonides 1/52, p. 115); if He has accidental qualities superadded to His essence "He would be a substratum of accidents" (Maimonides 1/52, p. 115) and as such com posite and changing. Any alteration or change in a perfect being involves its transition from a state of perfection to imperfection. The most central types of predication are thereby rejected.14 God cannot be defined. Neither essential nor accidental attributes can be ascribed to him. As a faithful Jew, committed to Scripture and to the oral tradition, Maimonides had to contend with the seemingly positive information that they contain about God's nature and actions. Maimonides insists that all biblical attributes, including "exis tence", apply to God in a completely equivocal manner: Similarly the terms "knowledge", "power", "will" and "life", as applied to Him, may He be exalted, and to those possessing knowledge, power, will and life, are purely equivocal, so that their meaning when they are predicated of Him is in no way like their meaning in other applications... these attributions have in common only the name and nothing else (Maimonides V 56, p. 131). This austere view concerning religious language appears to be somewhat modified. Maimonides interprets Scripture's references to God's nature as references to his man ner of acting, thereby allowing "attributes of action": "Every attribute that is found in the books of the deity, may He be exalted, is ... an attribute of His action and not an attribute of His essence..." (Maimonides 1/53, p. 121). Since Maimonides also denies the application of relational attributes to God, insist ing that God cannot be related to a time or a place, his "attributes of action" cannot and, indeed, do not refer to God's own manner of acting in the world.15 By "attributes of action", Maimonides means our human and perspectival tendency to interpret and describe certain worldly realia as effects, brought about by an agent. When we per ceive embryos of living beings and the manners in which they are cared for by their caregivers, we tend to say of God that he is kind: One apprehends the kindness of His governance in the production of the embryos of living beings, the bringing of various faculties to existence in them and in those who rear them after birth... (Maimonides 1/ 54, p. 125). When we perceive calamities annihilating whole tribes or regions, exterminating both young and old, we tend to say that God is jealous and avenging: Similarly we find among His actions that proceed with regard to the Adamites great calamities overtaking certain individuals and destroying them, or some universal event annihilating whole tribes or even an entire region, exterminating 14 Maimonides also discusses relational predication, involving, e.g., an item's relation to a particular place or a particular time. He denies a relation between God and the world, thereby denying relational predication too. He, nevertheless, views relational predication as less problematic since "it does not entail the positing of a multiplicity of eternal things or the positing of alteration taking place in His essence..." (1/52, p. 118). 15 See The Guide of the Perplexed 1/52. •£) Springer</page><page sequence="9">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:181-199 189 the children and the children of the children, leaving in existence neither the products of the soil nor the offspring of living beings... With reference to these actions He is called jealous and avenging and keeping anger and wrathful... (Maimonides 1/54, p. 126). Maimonides insists, however, that no conclusions concerning God's nature can be drawn on the basis of what we tend to identify as the effects of his agency. "Attributes of action" are merely the ways in which we describe certain states of affairs or occu rences. Thus, strictly speaking, God, in principle, cannot be said to forgive our sins or to be forgiving toward our sins.16 Given that God cannot be forgiving, is praying for his forgiveness mistaken, irratio nal, and confused? Perhaps a different theological framework can salvage the insatiable religious urge to praise God's mercy and forgivingness, thank Him or beseech him to act in a forgiving and merciful manner? I shall now turn to discuss the implications of an opposing theological perspective on "divine forgiveness". Muffs Muffs provides a challenging alternative to the austere Maimonidean perspective on God and how we may speak about him (Muffs 2005). He denies divine immutability and impassibility, endorsing anthropomorphic depictions of God. Muffs insists that God is a person with a full blown psychology, a will, things that he cares about, affec tions, emotions, and desires: "There is no doubt that God appears in the Bible as a person possessed with a wide range of emotions: concern, joy, sadness, regret, and chagrin, among many others" (Muffs 2005, p. 3). Muffs perceives God's rich psychol ogy as necessary for the maintenance of a meaningful relationship between God and human beings. God's very perfection, according to Muffs, has to do with his capacity to be affected by what human beings do or refrain from doing, by his care and love, by his capacity to be disappointed, to feel resentment and rage.17 If God has a psychology, God can suffer a psychological harm. He can feel dimin ished by an insult and resentful toward the agent or agents who had performed it. If God can feel resentment and rage God can, at least in principle, overcome his resentment and forgive offenses against him. He can, at least in principle, have or assume a forgiving personality. In other words, given such a perspective, there are no logical difficulties involved with the notion of "divine forgiveness", no a priori con straints on our use of it. But does God have a forgiving personality? Can utterances, e.g., "The Lord, The Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abound ing in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin"18 or "Most merciful God, Father of our Lord Jesus 16 The question of Maimonides' own views on prayer has received a great deal of attention by his com mentators. See, e.g., Benor (1995); Fox (1990). I shall later make a few brief comments about the nature of prayer in the Guide. 17 According to Muffs, the difference between the God of the Hebrew Bible and the gods of antiquity has to do with the freedom of the Hebrew God, with his insubordination to nature or fate. 18 Exodus 34:6-7, uttered during the Tachnun. See fn I. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="10">190 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74: ! 81 -199 Christ... In your mercy forgive what we have been",19 be taken as true descriptions, or as containing true descriptions of God's nature? Allowing for a psychological perspective on biblical narratives, be it a Jewish or a Christian perspective, is having to contend with depictions of divine vengeance and rage, which render such titles as "merciful and always ready to forgive" or "most merciful", when considered as descriptive titles of God, seriously problematic. Let us briefly consider several examples, which depict God's response to human wickedness, both in the early days of humanity and later on, in God's special relationship with the Israelites. Observing Noah's generation, God is deeply disappointed: The Lord saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually. And the Lord was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the Lord said, 'I will blot out from the earth the human beings I have created—people together with animals and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them.' ... And God said to Noah, 'I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence because of them; now I am going to destroy them along with the earth. Make yourself an ark... For my part, I am going to bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die. But I will establish my covenant with you' (Genesis 6:5-7, 13-14, 17-18). The divine intention to destroy everything alive is excessive, revealing not only sorrow but also outrage, indignation, moral hatred and a deep sense of resentment. The destruction of the animals, of creeping things and birds reveals that excess. After all, animals, creeping things and the birds of the air were not practicing agents of wickedness. What could possibly warrant their destruction? What could motivate it, other than outrage? God takes human wickedness as an all-embracing personal attack against him. Per ceiving human wickedness as his failure, he is filled with resentment and rage, doubting his self-worth as Creator. Being overcome by his resentment and rage, unable to tran scend them in forgiveness, God plans utter destruction, wishing to destroy everyone and everything. He does not call for moral reform. He does not scold human beings, nor does he attempt to display their ill doing before their eyes in order to motivate genuine repentance. He does not give any warning. Was there nothing other than com plete destruction that God could have done in response to human wickedness? The God depicted in the narratives of the flood seems unforgiving; he seems resentful and vengeful. God's intentions after the flood, too, reveal the flood as an outburst of divine anger and rage, the very opposite of forgivingness: Then Noah built an altar to the Lord, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. And when the Lord 19 Ibid., "prayers of penitence".

After his resentment subsides and his rage is soothed God can come to see that destroying everything living on account of human wickedness is inappropriate. He can then acknowledge the excessive nature of his previous rage and seek a mechanism by means of which he would be able to control it in the future, namely, the rainbow (Lorberbaum 2009). With his singling out the Israelites from among the nations, the Israelites become the focus of divine attention. Particular divine plans and expectations are made for them and intense emotions are elicited in response to their actions. Manifestations of bitter resentment and of vindictive rage in response to the Israelites' failings abound in the bible. I shall mention two examples from Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Being personally offended by the sins of Judea, God is overcome by resentment and rage, plotting excessive acts of vengeance against the people of Judea: For thus says the Lord concerning the sons and daughters that are born in this place, and concerning the mothers who bear them, and the fathers who beget them in this land: They shall die of deadly deceases. They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried; they shall become like dung on the surface of the ground. They shall parish by the sword and by famine, and their dead bodies shall become food for the birds of the air and for the wild animals of the earth (Jeremiah 16:3—4). Comparing Judea to an unfaithful nymphomaniac wife who commits adultery with every passerby, Ezekiel makes the following statements about the horrific fate of Judea/the unfaithful wife: [T]herefore, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and all those you hated; I will gather them against you from all around, and will uncover your nakedness to them, so that they may see all your nakedness. I will judge you as women who commit adultery and shed blood are judged, and bring blood upon you in wrath and jealousy. I will deliver you into their hands, and they shall throw down your platform and break down your lofty places; they shall strip you of your clothes and take your beautiful objects and leave you naked and bare. They shall bring up a mob against you, and they shall stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords. They shall burn your houses and execute judgements on you in the sight of many women; I will stop you from playing the whore, and you shall also make no more payments. So I will satisfy my fury on you, and my jealousy shall turn away from you; I will be calm, and will be angry no longer (Ezekiel 16:37—42). Feeling deeply humiliated by his betrayal, God has a difficulty to mange God's resentful anger since the very early days of humanity, since the flood. The Bible and the Jewish oral tradition openly acknowledge that difficulty. God is said to be a jealous God (El qana), jealousy being one of the divine attributes, one of God's names: "for , &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="12">192 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:181-199 the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God" (Exodus 34:14). Christians cannot dismiss offhand such depictions nor can they dismiss such narratives of vengeance. After all, it is the same God to whom they pray, and the same "salvation history" in which they participate. Thus, if one subscribes to a Maimonidean perspective, one must insist that in princi ple, a tendency to forgive or a forgiving nature cannot be ascribed to God. God cannot be a "victim" in any substantial sense. If one subscribes to a divine personhood, mythi cal approach, one must insist that God is psychologically vulnerable, that he neverthe less has a difficulty to handle his vulnerability, and manage his resentful anger; God, therefore, cannot be characterized as "always ready to forgive" or as "most merciful". What, then, is the status of utterances such as these, which are uttered in prayer? Are they mere wishful thinking? Is praising God as "merciful and always ready to forgive" simply false or confused?20 In the next section, I shall argue that despite these seeming difficulties, using such phrases in prayer is neither mistaken nor confused. In his later philosophical work, Wittgenstein had famously emphasized the relation between a concept's meaning and its use: "For a large class of cases—though not for all—in which we employ the word 'meaning' it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language." (Wittgenstein 1973: §43); "these kinds of use of 'understanding' make up its meaning, make up my concept of understanding..." (Wittgenstein 1973: §532). Concepts, however, are used in different practices in dif ferent manners. Thus, Wittgenstein also emphasizes the significance of the practice in the determination of meaning: "Practice gives the words their sense" (Wittgenstein 1984, p. 85). Wittgenstein, therefore, points out that we are to look at utterances in the activities and practices in which they are woven when we seek to understand their meaning. These Wittgensteinian observations underlie his distinction between "surface gram mar" and "depth grammar", between how a concept or an utterance appear to function in terms of their place in the sentence, in terms of their superficial form, and how they actually function in a particular context or practice, when the practice has been duly taken into account: In the use of words, one might distinguish 'surface grammar' from 'depth gram mar'. What immediately impresses itself upon us about the use of a word is the way it is used in the construction of the sentence, the part of its use—one might say—that can be taken by the ear.—And now compare the depth grammar, say of the word 'to mean', with what its surface grammar would lead us to suspect. No wonder we find it difficult to know our way about (Wittgenstein 1973: §664). 20 Even if such utterances were to be understood as ways of addressing God, their surface grammar may lead one into viewing them as involving descriptions of God's nature. In that case, a Maimonidean perspective and a "divine personhood" approach would render them problematic. &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="13">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:181-199 193 Wittgenstein repeatedly emphasizes that the true grammar of a concept, its "depth grammar" reveals the kind of concept that it is: "Essence is expressed by grammar." (Wittgenstein 1973: §371 ); "Grammar tells what kind of object anything is. (Theology as grammar.) (Wittgenstein 1973: §373).21 Drawing on the later Wittgenstein, Winch insists that we take note of the differences in "depth grammar" between "asking something of God" and "asking something of the Yugoslav ambassador": I want to argue that there is a difference in grammar between 'asking something of God' and 'asking something of the Yugoslav ambassador'.... What constitutes asking (and also answering) is different; or that the point of prayer (presupposed in any discussion of the rationality of particular cases of prayer) can only be elucidated ... [by] considering it in its religious context; that it cannot be elu cidated by starting simply with the function 'making requests to x' substituting 'God' for 'x', and then asking what difference is made by the fact that God has different characteristics from other xs (Winch 1987, p. 119). Winch emphasizes the logical-grammatical differences between religious utterances and non-religious ones. He argues that the practice in which utterances are embedded has to be reckoned with, when we seek to understand their meaning.22 A similar emphasis, (albeit supported by a different metaphysical and semantic worldview) was made by Maimonides, 800 years before. Similarly to the later Witt genstein, and to philosophers of religion who were inspired by him, Maimonides emphasized that it is utterly confused to suppose an analogy between, e.g., "God exists" and "Black swans exist", or "The Lord is merciful and always ready to for give" and "Abraham is merciful and always ready to forgive": Now everything that can be ascribed to God, may He be exalted, differs in every respect from our attributes, so that no definition can comprehend the one thing and the other. Similarly, as I shall make clear, the term 'existence' can only be applied equivocally to His existence and to that of things other than He (Maimo nides 1/35 p. 80). Underlying this passage and various others is the distinction between "surface gram mar" and "depth grammar". Being concerned about the consequences of the failure to see beyond the "surface grammar" of religious utterances, Maimonides wished to usher a new language game that can help us climb out of the confusions of equivo cation. Realizing the danger in construing "God is forgiving" as a statement affixing an "attribute of action" to God, Maimonides calls for "negative theology", negating in thought and speech what God is not: Know that the description of God, may He be cherished and exalted, by means of negations is the correct description—a description that is not affected by an 21 For a recent and highly nuanced account of the significance of the concepts "grammar" and "practice" in the life of faith, see Citron (2012). 22 D. Z. Phillips has repeatedly emphasized this point too in his early and later works. See, particularly, his famous discussion of prayer, in Phillips (1965). •Ö Springer</page><page sequence="14">194 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:181 -199 indulgence in facile language and does not imply any deficiency with respect to God in general or in any particular mode (Maimonides 1/58, p. 134). Maimonides' negative theology introduces a new "language game" into the life of faith. We do not merely negate various attributes (deficiencies) when using his via negativa, stating, e.g., that God is not unforgiving. We also deny the appropriateness of applying attributes, any attribute whatsoever, including "forgivingness" to God. His via negativa involves double negations that cannot be replaced by positive utterances. It involves double negations that undo themselves, thereby gesturing at our inability to speak about God. His via negativa is a "language game" with a logic of its own, which reveals that it is not possible to know God's nature, to entertain thoughts and utter statements about Him: As everyone is aware that it is not possible, except through negation, to achieve an apprehension of that which is in our power to apprehend and that, on the other hand, negation does not give knowledge in any respect of the true reality of the thing with regard to which the particular matter in question is negated—all men, those of the past and those of the future, affirm clearly that God, may He be exalted, cannot be apprehended by the intellects, and that none but He Himself can apprehend what He is, and that apprehension of Him consists in the inability to attain the ultimate term in apprehending Him (1/59, p. 139). Given the Maimonidean/Wittgensteinian awareness of the manner in which "prac tice", is internally related to "grammar", and of the ways in which religious practice determines the meaning of religious utterances, we need not suppose that believers are confused when uttering e.g., "0 Lord, who is merciful and always ready to forgive". "Divine forgiveness" cannot be assumed to be analogous to inter-personal human for giveness. What, however, is being done when such prayers are uttered? What is (are) the grammar(s) of such utterances? In his "Prayer and Jewish Thought", Shalom Rosenberg discusses different func tions of prayer: didactic, institutional, existential, mystical, theurgic and others. Rosen berg points out that the semantic units play different roles in each of these types of prayer. In theurgic and mystical prayers, the semantic units are transformed or broken down: Theurgic prayer brought about a symbolic reinterpretation of the text, while mystical prayer sometimes brought about its disintegration. In both cases, the normal semantic units lost their value, but where in theurgic prayer, new seman tic units with symbolic meanings were formed, in mystical prayer the emphasis was transferred almost completely to non-semantic units (e.g., letters), which became a medium by which to reach a higher level (Rosenberg 1996, p. 79). Mystical prayer (e.g., in the Kabbalistic tradition) has an ecstatic function; it is designed to elevate human beings to heaven. The words, letters and sounds become an instrument for achieving that purpose. They "became transformed into a type of instrumentality for elevating man to the upper worlds (Rosenberg 1996, p. 79). The semantic units, therefore, disintegrate, since it is by means of the letters and/or the sounds that prayer performs its mystic role, words becoming the mere apparent substance of prayer. ô Springer</page><page sequence="15">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:181-199 195 (Rosenberg 1996, p. 79). In such a context, the formula "God merciful and gracious, slow to anger... forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin" does not function as a faulty, confused description of God's nature but as a vehicle of self-transcendence by means of the letters which constitute it. The letters become the significant non-seman tic vessels of religious meaning that the believer contemplates in a meditative act, designed to take the believer to the upper worlds (Rosenberg 1996, p. 78). Rosenberg emphasizes that From the standpoint of the mystic, regular prayer is an act with overtones of impropriety... Petitionary prayer in the usual sense is seen as 'begging a reward from one's master' and thus, paradoxically, the more one concentrates on the literal meaning of the words, the more distasteful to God is one's prayer (Rosenberg 1996, p. 80). It is interesting to note that within a highly sophisticated intellectual framework, such as the Maimonidean one, prayer has a similar contemplative role by means of its semantic units, which are emptied out of their meaning. For Maimonides, the end of human life is intellectual union with the active intellect. Prayer, understood as contemplation, plays a central role in the realization of that ideal.23 Denying the possibility of predication, denying the possibility of speaking about God, Maimonides understood the semantic units of prayer that appear to speak about God as an empty vehicle, a kind of a (Tractarian) ladder that can lead the philosopher toward a dazzling mystical perception: Thus, all the philosophers say: We are dazzled by His beauty, and He is hidden from us because of the intensity with which He becomes manifest, just as the sun is hidden to eyes that are too weak to apprehend it (Maimonides 1/59, p. 139). The Maimonidean "via mystica" consists of two components: (1) a preliminary philosophical phase that is directed at cleansing the mind of its erroneous, idolatrous ideas about God. This phase involves one's ascent from the lower, idolatrous liter ary reading of the canonical texts, into their reading in terms of God's attributes of action, then proceeding to use negative attributes and ending with silence, i.e., with the realization that God's nature cannot be grasped and, that we cannot, therefore, say anything about God, and (2) a positive mystical phase of contemplation of the divine name, YHWH, designed to lead us toward a "moment of enlightenment", toward non propositional knowledge, toward a super-rational perception or apprehension. Thus, for Maimonides too, utterances, e.g., "O Lord, who is merciful and always ready to forgive" are not used as faulty or confused descriptions of God's nature but as empty vehicles of self-transcendence, as sentences stripped of their meaning that we are to climb over. The mystical interpretation of Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed is the minority interpretation. For a prominent proponent of this interpretation, see Blumenthal (2006). Blumenthal characterizes the post rationalist phase in Maimonides' Guide as "philosophic mysticism". He states: "Reason is the way to post-rational experience" (40) and "Philosophy... is the prelude to religious experience..." (41). For more on the history of the Guide's mystical interpretation, see Chapter 1 of Blumenthal's Philosophic Mysticism. See also Lorberbaum (2011 ), p. 33 fn 74. Springer</page><page sequence="16">196 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:181-199 Not only does mystical prayer transform the role of the semantic units in prayer, but theurgic prayer does so too. Theurgic prayer uses words to affect a change in the Godhead. The words, uttered in prayer, do not describe God, praise him or implore him to act in certain ways; rather, they bring about various changes in him; they affect him: "by means of our prayers and blessings we should repair and unify the upper worlds and forces so that they may be fit to receive the holiness of the upper light." (Rosenberg 1996, p. 80). Prayer, here, is repair of the world, of the upper worlds, and of the Holy Name (Rosenberg 1996, p. 76). Used theurgically, praying for forgiveness can be used to bring about and foster divine mercy and forgivingness. In other words, I propose that phrases, e.g., "God merciful and gracious", in various contexts are not used as descriptions but rather, as anger-management mechanisms, designed to affect a transition toward mercy and forgivingness in the Godhead. As I pointed out in the previous section, in various biblical and post-biblical narra tives, God does not appear as a forgiving person. God nevertheless appears as having second order desires to be merciful and forgiving. These second order desires are man ifest in various mechanisms that God establishes to control his anger, among which, I propose, are various types of prayers. In other words, I maintain that uttering phrases that ascribe forgivingness and mercy to God in worship is used, in certain contexts, to help God overcome his anger, to help him act in a merciful and forgiving manner. The biblical narrative of the flood does not present a forgiving image of God; it nevertheless portrays a God aspiring to be forgiving and merciful, or at the very least, aspiring toward moderation: Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him, 'As for me, I am establishing my covenant with you and your descendants after you, and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the domestic animals, and every animal of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark. I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth. God said, 'This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations: I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.' (Genesis 9:8-15). As Lorberbaum points out, the rainbow is instituted by God, primarily for God, as an anger-management device, designed to help him suppress his anger: God therefore fixed the bow as a mechanism for self-control. The passage of the rainbow... implies the recognition (...) of human beings' faulty nature. In acknowledging the inevitability of his corruption, God knows that His jealousy will strengthen, causing Him to forget His promise... God creates a mechanism that will halt Himself and stop His anger. This is the primary purpose of the bow that appears 'in the cloud' whenever human beings sin and a flood threatens to Springer</page><page sequence="17">Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:181 -199 197 come. Its impressive appearance reminds God of His covenant; He will restrain Himself, and in so doing, also the flood clouds (Lorberbaum 2009, p. 531). Lorberbaum reads a similar second order divine desire to suppress anger in God's exchange with Moses after the sin of the golden calf. God says: "I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people; now therefore, let Me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them; but of you I will make a great nation" (Exod 32:9-10). Lorberbaum makes the following comments concerning the purpose of the exchange: The destructive jealousy is an essential part of His personality and His will ('let Me alone that My wrath may burn hot'). It seems that, more than asking permis sion, God is hinting to Moses that He wants him to act so as to help to restrain his anger that is becoming stronger and stronger—for if this were not the case, why does He need to ask permission? Moses has not even begun to pray! Why does God not allow His anger to grow and to break out? The hint 'Stop Me'! is part of the emotional logic of asking permission in such situations. Moses is pressured and 'through a joint effort', helps to halt the Divine fury and prevent the destruction that was likely to follow (Lorberbaum 2009, p. 533). Prayers for forgiveness, I propose, are sometimes used as an institutional joint divine human effort to help halt the divine fury. The Talmud too, depicts God as acknowledging his difficulty to manage his anger and his second order commitment to handling his anger, so that his mercy and forgiv ingness override it. It depicts God as praying that his mercy suppress his anger: Rabbi Johanan says in the name of Rabbi Jose: How do we know that the Holy One, blessed be He, says prayers? Because it says: Even them will I bring to My holy mountain and make them joyful in My house of prayer. It is not said, 'their prayer', but 'My prayer'; hence [you learn] that the Holy One, blessed be He, says prayers. What does He pray?—Rabbi Zutra the son of Tobi said in the name of Rab: 'May it be My will that My mercy may suppress My anger, and that My mercy may prevail over My [other] attributes, so that I may deal with My children in the attribute of mercy and, on their behalf, stop short of the limit of strict justice'. (Babylonian Talmud, Berachot 7a). Acknowledging his jealousy and rage, acknowledging his difficulty to manage his anger, God prays that his mercy prevail over his anger, thereby revealing his second order desire to act in a merciful and forgiving manner, despite his tendency not to do so. In writing about the will, Frankfurt argues that it is characteristic of human beings that they are able to form second order desires. While many kinds of animals appear to have simple first order desires to act or choose, human beings also want to have cer tain desires and motives; they want to choose certain things and refrain from choosing others. They have the capacity for reflective self-evaluation: One essential difference between persons and other creatures is to be found in the structure of a person's will. Human beings are not alone in having desires and motives, or in making choices.... It seems to be peculiarly characteristic Springer</page><page sequence="18">198 Int J Philos Relig (2013) 74:181-199 of humans, however, that they are able to form what I shall call 'second order desires' or 'desires of the second order.' Besides wanting and choosing and being moved to do this or that, men may also want to have (or not to have) certain desires and motives. They are capable of wanting to be different, in their preferences and purposes, from what they are. Many animals appear to have the capacity for what I shall call 'first-order desires' or 'desires of the first order', which are simply desires to do or not to do one thing or another. No animal other than man, however, appears to have the capacity for reflective self evaluation that is manifested in the formation of second order desires (Frankfurt 1971, pp. 6-7). It appears that God too, as He is depicted in biblical and post-biblical narratives, has the capacity for self evaluation and reflection. He does not merely act out his emotions and desires but also reflects upon them, forming second order desires and attitudes toward his first order ones. God's having second order desires is part of God's person hood. Upon reflection, God acknowledges his various emotions and tendencies and shows commitment to act on some and refrain from acting on others. Even after severe lapses, God seeks various ways to improve himself, establishing various devices that contribute to his self-improvement, among which, we may suppose, are human prayers that seem to describe him as forgiving. To summarize, the appeal for divine forgiveness, in various contexts, has perfor mative, theurgical and mystical functions. Praying for God's forgiveness, in various contexts, need not be understood as involving a commitment to God's mercifulness or forgivingness. Phrases, such as "God merciful and gracious", "always ready to forgive" do not always purport to describe God's nature; they are sometimes used as instruments in God's arsenal of anger-management devices. They are used to fos ter, or build a certain divine character, to help God suppress his anger, overcome his resentment and act in a forgiving and merciful way. They function as mechanisms that help God implement his second order desire for moderation, mercifulness and forgivingness. They are used theurgically, to affect a change in the Godhead. On other occasions, such phrases disintegrate into the letters or sounds that constitute them, and are used "mystically" to foster union with the divine realm. In this paper, I focused on two non-descriptive uses of such phrases in the Jewish tradition, which I had found surprising and daring. Other uses of prayers for for giveness in the Jewish and the Christian traditions are not excluded by this analysis. Addressing God as "always ready to forgive" may function in a restorative way, i.e., to help the believer constitute him/herself as temperate and forgiving, as a loving person who trusts all, loves all and hopes for the best for all (Kierkegaard 1998). Such a use and various others await further analysis. On the basis of the two non-descriptive uses that I discussed in this paper, I conclude that even if God is neither forgiving nor capable of acting in a forgiving way, believ ers may continue to rehearse their prayers and pray for God's forgiveness. Whether such prayers are efficacious, whether such prayers have "satisfaction conditions" is an altogether different matter.
