Amsterdam-Oxford, North-Holland Publishing Company - New York, American Elsevier Publishing Company, Inc., 1975. X, 185 pp. f 60.-/ $ 23.25. This book contains the photographic reproduction of eleven papers, to which a conclusive chapter has been added with the title "What could be the Relevance?" We first mention the titles of these papers, adding the page-numbers in the present volume. Three of them have been published in vol. 28 (1974) of this periodical, viz., "God Cosmos History. Christian and Neo-Platonic Views on Divine Revelation" (52-80), "HN JIIOTE OTE OYK HN O YIO1. A Discussion on Time and Eternity" (81-88), and "Wie platonisierten Christen? Zur Grenzziehung zwischen Platonis- mus, kirchlichem Credo und patristischer Theologie" (133-146). The titles of the remaining eight are: "Zehn Jahre Forschung zum Thema Platonis- mus und Kirchenvaiter" (from: Theologische Rundschau, N.F. 36 [1971]: 1-18); "Irenaeus' Relation to Philosophy in the Light of his Concept of Free Will" (from: Romanitas et Christianitas. Studia J. H. Waszink oblata [Amsterdam 1973]: 19-30); "Some Observations on Irenaeus' Polemics against the Gnostics" (from: Nederlands Theologisch Tidschrift 27 [1973]: 31-38); "Die 'physische Erl6sung' in der Theologie des Irenius" (from: Nederlands Archief voor Kerkgeschiedenis 53 [1973]: 39-51); "Athanasius on the Father as the Origin of the Son" (from: id. 55 [1974]: 89-102); "The Doctrine of the Will and of the Trinity in the Orations of Gregory of Nazianzus" (from: Nederl. Theol. Tidschr. 27 [1973]: 103-113); "Cyril of Alexandria on the Platonists and the Trinity" (from: id. 28 [1974]: 114-127); "Some Reflections on Cyril of Alexandria's Rejection of Anthropomorphism" (from: id. 28 [1974]: 128-132). The final chapter has as its subject the relevance for the present times of the doctrines and theories of ancient theologians examined in these eleven papers. The chapter is opened by an introduction (147-149) concerning the different duties of the historian of theology and the</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW 319 systematician, both of whom should have done "to a limited degree (and undoubtedly as amateurs) work in each other's field". The reviewer would like to add here from his own experience the observation that this requirement is particularly appropriate to a description of Tertullian's activity, who nowadays is more and more regarded as an author whose work can be explained for the full hundred percent from external facts, amongst which the continuous influence and practising of the main rules of Roman rhetorics is by far the most important factor. It is true that this importance is very great, and we must be thankful to Mr. R. D. Sider to have analysed it so well (Ancient Rhetoric and the Art of Tertullian, Oxford 1971), but on the other hand we must never forget that all the polemic firework is eventually based on the very solid, and fairly limited, foundation of Tertullian's Christian faith which has a remarkably strong structure. In accordance with the major problems discussed in the eleven papers mentioned above the author chooses for this final systematic reflection the notion of unchangeability in God and man, and the notion of divine revelation in history. The discussion is both exact and sagacious, and well worth reading for all types of patristic scholars. Particularly interesting is the critical description of the treatment of the notion of the unchange- ability of God in the theology of Karl Barth and some of his modern critical followers of whom Berkhof should be mentioned in the first place. No less important - of easier access to scholars who are more historically or philologically trained - is the question of the relevance of the ancient doctrines concerning the divine reality in history, where Barth and Berkhof are joined by Troeltsch and Tillich as the major figures. Occasionally the reviewer (who must add at once that he is a classical philologist and not an expert at all) wonders about the absence of certain names: in his opinion, some quite important observations can be found in the work of von Campenhausen, and at all events some major Catholic theologians should have entered the scene. One short observation: When speaking about the fairly small differences between Jewish theology of Late Antiquity and the contemporaneous forms of Platonism concerning their treatment of the subject of God's unchangeability, the author observes (150): "the great Jewish thinker Philo did not differ from the Platonists in this respect." But Philo cannot be characterized as "a Jewish thinker" as such: the two greatest specialists, Theiler and Wolfson, have qualified him as one of the most important adherents of Middle Platonism. At all events Philo is to be treated as a</page><page sequence="3">320 REVIEW special case and cannot be regarded as just representing a certain group of thinkers. Finally, the reviewer would like to tease the author a little on account of his characterization of H. J. Adriaanse's thesis (148 not 2) as a "very learned and therefore extremely difficult thesis". His experience is that frequently very learned books, from the times of Scaliger and Grotius to those of Courcelle and Hadot, are considerably easier to read than those written by less learned authors.
