Dickinson 1 ABSTRACT. In 1973, Ernest Becker, a cultural anthropologist cross-trained in philosophy, sociology, and psychiatry, invoked consciousness of self and the inevitability of death as the primary sources of human anxiety and repression. He proposed that the psychological basis of cooperation, competition, and emotional and mental health is a tendency to hold tightly to anxiety-buffering cultural world views or “immortality projects” that serve as the basis for self-esteem and meaning. Although he focused mainly on social and political outcomes like war, torture, and genocide, he was increasingly aware that materialism, denial of nature, and immortality-striving efforts to control, rather than sanctify, the natural world were problems whose severity was increasing. In this paper I review Becker’s ideas and suggest ways in which they illuminate human response to global climate change. Because immortality projects range from belief in technology and materialism to reverence for nature or belief in a celestial god, they act both as barriers to and facilitators of sustainable practices. I propose that Becker’s cross-disciplinary “science of man,” and the predictions it generates for proximate-level determinants of social behavior, add significantly to our understanding of and potential for managing the people paradox, i.e., that the very things that bring us symbolic immortality often conflict with our prospects for survival. Analysis of immortality projects as one of the proximate barriers to addressing climate change is both cautionary and hopeful, providing insights that should be included in the cross-disciplinary quest to uncover new pathways toward rational, social change. Key Words: environmental behavior, birds, icons, social psychology, terror management theory, conservation; immortality projects INTRODUCTION attests to a belief that increasing awareness helps change individual behavior and promotes advocacy, Reversing the trajectory of global climate change but there is little real evidence that this is so requires widespread support for policies and (Blumstein and Saylan 2008).

In The Denial of Death (1973), he proposed understanding advances rapidly, but (ii) avoidance, that human beings are predisposed to suppress denial, and recrimination characterize the overall thoughts of death to manage anxiety about the societal response, therefore (iii) there is relatively inevitability of mortality.

One component of why the connection is so flimsy between what we consciousness is awareness of a “self” (Dennett know, what we value, and how we behave. 2004), and with this awareness comes awareness of the inevitability of mortality. Becker invoked This question is rooted in the ideas of Ernest Becker, Rank’s (1941) assertion that fear of annihilation is whose work culminated in two companion the primary source of human anxiety. The flip side syntheses: The Denial of Death (1973) and Escape of fear of annihilation is anxiety about the self, from Evil (1975). Here I expand Becker’s cultural which is the basis of neurosis. and proximate psychological understanding of human behavior to provide new insights into the Becker suggested that thinking about death is so challenge of implementing a rational response to costly that denial of death is ubiquitous and explains global climate change. First, I summarize Becker’s the majority of human mythologies and world ideas on psychological repression of death anxiety views. He proposed that we repress thoughts of through symbolic perpetuation of the self, and death and dying by pushing them out of clarify the empirical framing of these ideas within consciousness and creating a mythical, culturally the branch of social psychology known as “terror and socially informed reality that provides a context management theory” (TMT). I then use TMT for self-esteem or even heroism. We use our unique research paradigms, which examine how thinking self-awareness and imagination to create a fictional about death influences human behavior (Pyszczynski self through shared meaning, myths, cultural world et al. 2006), to make predictions about how views, and projects for building self-esteem (causa individuals and groups respond to mortal sui or Oedipal projects). Cultural world views environmental problems like global climate change. include all ways of viewing the world, from belief The purpose of this synthesis is to explore one of in the supernatural to the creation of meaning within the key psychological links between the reality of cultures of honor, materialism, myths, nationalism, global climate change and the difficulty of religion, and reverence for youthfulness, beauty, or mobilizing individuals and groups to confront the artistry. Ancestral cultures were more integrated problem in a rational and timely manner. I focus on and provided a consistent context for self-esteem Becker’s mechanistic (proximate) understanding of with well-defined roles that governed interactions self-esteem striving, transference idealization, within ritual units or social groups, but, in the world view defense, and outgroup antagonism, modern world, in which people no longer operate illuminating several ways in which death-denying within a single culture, we have a larger variety of defenses and perpetuation of the symbolic self are contexts or world views within which to strive for psychological barriers to the development of self-esteem as doctors and scientists, soldiers and modern, rational, sustainable belief systems, nationals, parishioners and priests, consumers and advocacy, and action. aesthetes, artists and athletes, cult or gang members, and world leaders (Becker 1973, Lifton 1993). ERNEST BECKER’S IDEAS ON DENIAL OF Another way to reduce anxiety about mortality is to DEATH AND THE SYMBOLIC SELF project power and importance onto some idealized other, often a celestial god. In Becker’s (1973) Becker’s ideas have their historical roots in words, we are “meaning seeking creatures.” We psychoanalysis (Rank 1941, Freud 1957, Brown have the capacity to see ourselves in relation to </page> <page sequence="3"> Ecology and Society 14(1): 34 http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss1/art34/ larger systems, including the cosmos, and to why so much of human motivation is subconscious comprehend the idea that we are small and and thus outside awareness. insignificant relative to what we see in the sky: the stars, the planets, the universe (Leifer 1997). Applying these ideas to the environment, I propose Because this is terrifying (Rank 1932), we repress that unconscious defenses identified by TMT can thoughts of death and project a power and both block and promote rational responses to global importance onto something larger that will save us. climate change. Given the paradox that most This psychological phenomenon, known as modern immortality-striving hero systems hinder transference, was proposed by Freud (1957) to our chances of survival, what might we learn by describe patients’ projection of aspects of the investigating the psychological mechanisms parent-child power and love relationship onto the governing our choices? Understanding proximate analyst. Recently, controlled behavioral experiments behavioral mechanisms, particularly unconscious provide empirical support for transference motivations that govern decision making, may idealization with anxiety-reducing effects that can reveal methods for generating a sustained response be understood using neural network approaches to global climate change in the short term and (Gabbard 2006) and visualized with neural imaging provide insights that individuals and institutions can techniques (Gerber and Peterson 2006). Charismatic use to foster rational responses to escalating leaders and deities are common soteriological environmental crises over the long term. transference objects, but so are movie stars, political leaders, lovers, and teachers. The exact nature of transference varies, but what is critical is that TERROR MANAGEMENT THEORY AND transference objects appear larger than life and more EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR DENIAL OF enduring than the mortal self. DEATH AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR The proximate psychological mechanisms that form the basis of the ideas presented here neither conflict Terror management theory (TMT) is the with nor support hypotheses at the ultimate, formalization of Becker’s ideas within the field of evolutionary level of analysis, at which the social psychology. Although not universally experience of and defenses against existential terror accepted (Navarrete and Fessler 2005), TMT is can be viewed either as costly byproducts of the supported by evidence from more than 300 evolution of consciousness (Landau et al. 2006) or, empirical studies testing a wide range of predictions more plausibly, as products of selection resulting with Western and indigenous societies in various from the advantages of ideologically based within- parts of the globe (Pyszczynski et al. 2006).

Proximal defenses are launched when death view, placing his ideas within the context of Western thoughts rise to consciousness, whereas distal society’s increasingly distant relationship to nature defenses are responsible for keeping death thoughts and rejection of death as an integral part of life unconscious. The experiments ask whether TMT is (Becker 1975, Lifton 1979).

Experiments indicate that death to the distant future (Pyszczynski et al. 1999). bolstering self-esteem helps to keep death thoughts Distraction, planning, and biased cognition, such as at bay (Greenberg et al. 1992b). Consequently, denial of risk and rationalization, all serve to threats to self-esteem can elicit terror management suppress thoughts of death, reducing abstract defenses, whereas factors such as a history of secure awareness of mortality. Individuals filter attachment or thinking about one’s own secure information in ways that appear rational, biasing relationship have buffering effects (Florian and cognition away from the inevitability of death.

Terror management theory predictions for how thinking about mortality in association with climate change (GCC) affects people’s behavior. GCC primes include a range of stimuli that cause people to think about the impacts of and risks associated with global climate change. Hypothesis Predictions GCC primes increase death thought accessibility. Death thought accessibility will increase when people are asked to think about global climate change. High-severity forecasts will increase death thought accessibility more than low-severity forecasts. People will exhibit proximal defenses in response to information about GCC by: Denying that the threat exists; GCC prime increases both the frequency and intensity of climate change denial. Accepting GCC, but denying that humans are the cause; GCC prime increases the intensity of denial that humans cause climate change. Accepting GCC, but pushing the timing far into the future. GCC prime increases estimates of the amount of time until the occurrence of severe climate-change effects or the tipping point. People will exhibit distal defenses in response to information about GCC by: Striving for self-esteem; GCC prime increases striving for self-esteem within the context of the individual’s world view. Defending their world views; GCC prime increases the intensity and frequency of the world view defense, e.g., making donations to a political party, espousing a world view, defending a world view.

However, when driving and self-esteem </page> <page sequence="6"> Ecology and Society 14(1): 34 http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss1/art34/ are linked, Becker’s hypothesis makes the opposite Thinking about climate change may also result in prediction, and this was borne out in an experiment ideological conflict within individuals. Environmental in which subjects who linked driving with self- awareness and a tendency to promote conservation esteem drove faster and became more reckless in behavior will be undermined when the response to stimuli that made them think about environmentalist ideology threatens an individual’s death, sacrificing true safety for false safety in the self-esteem within some other ideological context. form of defense of the ego (Ben-Ari et al. 1999).

This is the crux of Becker’s personality type. Lifton (1993) discovered that argument: The behaviors people exhibit are not “doubling,” i.e., the creation of separate selves, necessarily those that reduce the risk of death, and occurred among doctors who became killers at in fact they may sometimes increase it as long as Auschwitz; this is an extreme response that allows they also bolster the individual’s symbolic self and people to retain deeply discordant ideologies, which the complex, immortality-striving hero system that is difficult because internal conflict undermines defines it.
