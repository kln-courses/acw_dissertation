<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eugene O'Neill and the Cruelty of Theater Joseph J. Moleski The division between signifying written language and in- toxicating spoken language opens up a gulf in the solid massif of verbal meaning and forces the gaze into the depths of language. Walter Benjamin The Origin of German Tragic Drama' I O'Neill's influence, as hypnotic as the rhythm of decompo- sition that marks one of his plays in the form of a drumbeat (The Emperor Jones), has abated little in the years since his death. The negativity of his judgments on human life and possibility, seemingly the very insignia of courage and sincerity, easily reconcile themselves in the mind of theater-goer and critic alike with an intoxicatingly rich "theatrical experience." Possessor of an almost violent stylistic fecundity, a fecundity whose origin in the positing of a noumenal "reality" which can only be death itself as one of his late plays tells us,2 a fecundity we simply enjoy without questioning the price we are expected to pay on its behalf: O'Neill and his heirs continue to hold sway over the American stage. Ruthless critics though they are pro- claimed, their popularity seems hardly to have suffered for it. Yet behind the sumptuousness, the profusion of forms and techniques (the term "technique" here summarizing the whole of a tradition that reduces art to the status of a mere supplement to physis), stood, according to O'Neill, a simple self-conception and modest intention: he was to be thought of as having been "a bit of a poet, who has labored with the spoken word to evolve original rhythms of beauty, where beauty apparently isn't. . . ." The innocuousness, the innocence, even the humanism of that project - as much a program in public perception as an aesthetic manifesto - are assumed to be obvious, especially 327</page><page sequence="2">328 Comparative Drama when we read in the phrase immediately following that this "beauty" is associated with discovering "the transfiguring no- bility of tragedy, in as near the Greek sense as one can grasp it, in seemingly the most ignoble, debased lives."3 It is a familiar schema, "Nietzschean" in its hypostatization of the tragic and its belief in the aesthetic justification of suffering.4 As a statement, these words of O'Neill define the level and degree of his complicity with the culture whose critical son he was to have been, taking us as they do to the constitutive center of Western theater and beyond, to the cardinal postulate of the logocentrism that inspires Western culture in its most funda- mental project. The privilege of speech; the unity of voice and meaning in the spoken word; the human voice as origin of difference (thus turning difference into rhythm which is tradi- tionally the realm of patterned recurrence); speech as archon of a system of differences from which it is itself exempt, which it sustains without participating in: all these point out the paralle- lism of O'Neill's dramatic program with the most tenaciously pursued project of our culture.5 Influence, the spell of the other proposing and imposing itself as self-subsistent presence outside the play of difference, is produced by this elevation of the voice. My intention here is not to trace O'Neill's work in its contours back to the project he defined for us, a course that would serve his purposes as well as another, but to situate it, inscribe it in a system of differences it cannot command but whose occlusion is decisive. П The most incisive of Antonin Artaud's objections to clas- sical representational theater was its domination by, its orien- tation to speech.6 In that phenomenon, really a radical historical intention, he saw the very name of all that the "Theater of Cruelty," that site not necessarily of bloodshed and carnage but rather of "the affirmation/ of a terrible/ and, moreover, implac- able necessity,"? was to raise itself up against. Artaud's denunci- ation of the inherently theological word was not, however, un- dertaken as an act of simple metaphysical or aesthetic terror- ism, but as a preliminary to achieving a form of writing, a "veritable theatrical passigraphy reaching beyond empirical languages/'^ as distinct as can be - because it includes it, local- izes it - from the phonetic writing, writing subject to speech, of</page><page sequence="3">Joseph J. Moleski 329 the West. Rigor, necessity, the responsibility of theater could only be achieved, Artaud knew, by deposing the voice, liberating writing as the play of difference from its thralldom to the voice. Against the phonocentric theater, against its psychology and metaphysics, he brandished the limit at which the possibility of a pure theater (one from which all representation had been purged, that would be life itself in total non-differentiation) joins with its impossibility. If I now turn to the case of Arnold Schoenberg, it is not to produce an analogy in musical history to the demand Artaud made of the theater. I do so because music, a certain kind of music, a certain perception of music, is critical to the situation of O'Neill's work, as the quotation from which we began indi- cates. Starting from the voice as the source of music (to O'Neill pure, rhythmical, vocalic sonority) in the askesis of meaning, O'Neill condemns himself to the dream of a music that possesses all the self-subsistent presence, the nature and necessity, that the "meaningful voice" alone lacks, precisely because of the sacrifice of meaning that was performed to achieve the musical- ity of speech. This fact is sufficiently indicated in the musical form that is found throughout his plays, the folk song. 9 His entire work can be read as the surrender of dramatic reality to the putative substantiality of a certain kind of music. The whole of Schoenberg's revision of music, like Artaud's revaluation of drama, turns on the issue of the relationship between speech and writing. It can, in fact, be read as the derivation of music from writing (but can we still speak of derivation, a term that implies an ontological primacy it is the very function of writing to contest?). As Theodor Adorno describes the liberation of music, always still to be accomplished, sought by Schoenberg and his followers (though, like Artaud, Schoenberg made imitation precisely infidelity), the sense of his act consisted in this: "All organic music proceeded out of the stile recitativo. From the very beginning this was patterned after speech. The emancipation of music today is tantamount to its emancipation from verbal language."10 The resituation of speech is one in Schoenberg with the abandonment of musical repre- sentationalism, with the critical revision of the organicist heri- tage in music. One could trace in Schoenberg's articulation, first, of free atonality - itself an impossible limit - and later the necessarily arbitrary institutionalization of free atonality in the</page><page sequence="4">330 Comparative Drama twelve-tone system as motivated by the same intention that compelled Artaud first to criticize the (phonetic, logocentric) writing of the theater and then to demand, to dream a totally different form of writing that would organize the totality of theatrical "elements." If we now resume our reading of O'Neill in terms of Stra- vinsky, the extremity of whose work from Schoenberg's is studied in Adorno's Philosophy of Modern Music, it is not in the spirit of a rampant analogism. Nor is it the mere tracing of a circle which would lead us through a certain controlled detour to our starting point in O'Neill. Rather, the point is to achieve a certain squaring of our study according to four positions, nodes, opaque points, which will give us a quasi-theatrical space or page on which to play off music and drama against one another, not in the direction of a totalizing interpretation, but toward a certain opening of the work of O'Neill. In other words, the argument of this essay lies in its structure. Very few of the possibilities this admittedly violent or artificial resituation of O'Neill's work in a structure neither he nor we can command can be more than adumbrated here, not for accidental but for essential rea- sons. But perhaps, in a small way, this essay itself, in its tactics and their implications, will form a gloss, when we come to read it, of O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night, itself a play constituted by a ternary structure, though one giving itself out as a natural one, i.e., as a family. Ш The Peyote dance is inside a grater, in its time-tempered wood, endowed with the occult salts of the earth. It is in the taut and involuted fibres of this wand that the healing virtues of the rite dwell, and it is so complex, so withdrawn, it must be hunted and tracked down like some beast in the forest. Antonin Artaud, "Concerning a Journey to the Land of the Tarahumaras" H The Emperor Jones is a Stravinskyan ballet of dissolution. It exposes the subject to a rhythm, a pulsation, that is split off from content, fetishized, in much the same way as it is in Petrouchka and Le Sacre du Printemps. As a play, The Emperor Jones can be read as the burlesque of individuation, a fascistic denunciation of fascism; as constructed upon a wholly non- dialectical interpretation of the selfs claim to difference, to not</page><page sequence="5">Joseph J. Moleski 331 being fully accounted for by its position in the collective. The subject's conception of difference is presumed, by the way Jones is characterized and by the very fact that he is uncontrasted in the play, to be a totalitarian act, self-aggrandizement, oppor- tunism. The very idea of a difference that would be neither romantic negativity, the Hegelian "beautiful soul," nor inher- ently a claim of superiority, is alien to O'Neill, as the play Different attests. 12 Adorno's description of the role of rhythm in Stravinsky's early ballets is apposite: Rhythmic structure is, to be sure, blatantly prominent, but this is achieved at the expense of all other aspects of rhythmic organ- ization. Not only is any subjectively expressive flexibility of the beat absent . . . but furthermore all rhythmic relations associated with the construction and the internal compositional organization - the 'rhythm of the whole' - are absent as well. Rhythm is underscored, but split off from musical content. This results not in more, but rather in less rhythm than in compositions in which there is no fetish made of rhythm; in other words, there are only fluctuations of something always constant and totally static - a stepping aside - in which the irregularity of recurrence replaces the new.13 The hypostasization of rhythm in O'Neill, the rendering-virulent of rhythm by means of its enthronement (for rhythm is Jones's double), has the effect of drying up the source of rhythm, of delivering up duration to the quasi-spatial tableau. Devoid of the rhythm of or at the source, hence of duration and the sub- jectively expressive, O'Neill writes plays which juxtapose "blocks of time" in the manner of Diff'rent and All God's Chillun. O'Neill's and Stravinsky's positions in their respective arts are near-doubles of each other. Rhythm, in its tradition and in O'Neill's work, is, first of all, the rhythm of respiration: ingathering, expulsion; dilation, con- traction. This rhythm, because it is "involuntary" perhaps, gives itself out as being natural, which even allows it to be confused with spontaneity and freedom. It dominates in O'Neill's theater, not simply in the sense of the rhythm of the speaking voice - the chant of Lazarus Laughed, for example - but as the virtual subject of the plays. Psychological explanations of this phe- nomenon, as much a factor in Stravinsky's music as in O'Neill's drama, are of no avail; as an extreme reaction to or repression of the limits of logocentrism, it is perhaps explicable. O'Neill's theater respires; his drama traces the simple alterna-</page><page sequence="6">332 Comparative Drama tion of inversely related movements representing itself as nature, objectivity. This inverse parallelism, this respiration, is the signature of the phonocentric work. In comparison with rhythm itself (but is such a thing possible?), "content" is unimportant in this sense: the more extreme the dualities, the more reassuring their inscription in the anthropomorphic movement that prof- fers and withdraws them. Even dualities like God the Mother and God the Father (Strange Interlude) or hope and despair (The Iceman Cometh) are primarily significant insofar as they provide this rhythm with substance on which to act, with a "medium." The presence of rhythm, as the movement of an inverse parallelism, may be interpreted as the signature of the human in non-human or transpersonal phenomena like history or "nature." Its "perception" there can produce a fundamentally reassuring, because "familiar," non-alien, effect. "Rhythm" is, thus, one of the resources of anthropocentric reassurance, the reassurance of anthropomorphism, even when this rhythm's "matter" is inherently destructive. The entire point becomes clear when we see Artaud ultimately attempt to create what is a writing of the breath itself (see, for example, his "An Affective Athleticism"). At the nadir of Jones's disintegration in The Emperor Jones, then, lies a trance-like state that brings us, I think, to one of the points of greatest difference between O'Neill's and Artaud's response to the historical repression of writing, a repression which, because it served the purpose of his desire for status as a classicist, O'Neill was never to seek to undo, but which he was therefore condemned to repeat endlessly as if in a dream. At the limit of his attempted escape from the collective his prétentions have incited to homocidal fury - the escape presided over by the pulsation of the drum, the tympanum, the ear against which O'Neill delivers his blows - Jones finds himself confronted with a "Congo Witch Doctor" who brandishes "a charm stick with a bunch of white cockatoo feathers tied to the end "14 Jones is "paralyzed with awed fascination. . . ." The Witch Doctor's voice "rises and falls in a weird, monotonous croon, without articulate word divisions." But, though he cannot speak, the Witch Doctor can nevertheless make himself understood: he "points with his wand to the sacred tree, to the river beyond, to the altar, and finally to Jones with a ferocious command.</page><page sequence="7">Joseph J. Moleski 333 Jones seems to sense the meaning of this. It is he who must offer himself for sacrifice" (p. 201). The "wand" wielded by the Witch Doctor points out the elements of a pre-constituted space, an apparently primordial theater, and this action is experienced as a commandment of self-destruction. Originary malice on the part of the Other com- bined with fear on the part of the Self, a quasi-Hegelian opening to a dialectic of Master and Slave? Certainly it is this, but other elements of the scene are more decisive for our purposes here. As we have already noted, the dominant note of this crooning voice that O'Neill hears at the origin is this: it is "without articulate word divisions"; an originary voice which writing, the principle of articulation, has not yet divided, not yet subjected to meaning. Inviolate, it stands at the origin with all its presence intact, all cruelty already delegated to the "wand" - or writing instrument - that must thereafter carry the full burden of the gesture of authority as of cruelty. As speaker, at least as speaker intent on reactivating the purely musical origin of speech, I am innocent, the innocent master. Insofar as I write, in any active sense, affirming writing, I am inculpated, doomed to the dialec- tical movement of history. O'Neill dreams a virginal speech exorcised of the spirit of domination as a sanctuary from evil, cruelty, writing. For O'Neill as for the baroque writers studied by Benjamin, "sound is and remains something purely sensuous; meaning has its home in written language. And the spoken word is only afflicted by meaning, so to speak, as if by an inescapable disease; it breaks off in the middle of the process of resounding, and the damming up of the feeling, which was ready to pour forth, provokes mourning. Here meaning is encountered ... as the reason for mournfulness."l5 We are not far from O'Neill's Mourning Becomes Electra: as Orin says to Lavinia, "I hate the daylight. It's like an accusing eye! No, we've renounced the day, in which normal people live - or rather it has renounced us. Perpetual night - darkness of death in life - that's the fitting habitat for guilt!"16 And the mask-like quality of the human face, the face insofar as it functions as a sign within a system of similarities and differences, committing the presence of the true face to meaning, is experienced as well as a doom. The other side of the situation is Lazarus Laughed; there joy can express itself in a chanting of the triumphant "liberation" of</page><page sequence="8">334 Comparative Drama voice from the necessity of meaning - in a burning which finds its absolute contrary in Artaud's vision of an utter expenditure: "And if there is still one hellish, truly accursed thing in our time, it is our artistic dallying with forms, instead of being like victims burnt at the stake, signaling through the flames" (my italics). 17 O'Neill's dream of a (lost) spontaneously arising plentitude played out within/ as language, within/ as the affliction of writing as incision/ mark/ stigme/techne, has these consequences for his work: the repeated eruption of fantasies of "primitive" cul- tures - the crews of the old sailing ships, island natives 18 - as innocent as they are distant in time or space; the recourse, when it is a question of representing his own culture, to the virtual apotheosization of a principle that operates with the automatic functioning of a machine (a "return of the repressed" automatic functioning, or death, within speech) as in Dynamo or, as we have seen, in The Emperor Jones, where the drumbeat that rules the action finally becomes a "baffled but revengeful power"; and, finally, the "internalization" of this still unassimilated mechanical principle as the repetition-compulsion that charac- terizes the mother of Long Day's Journey into Night as well as the society of The Iceman Cometh. In other words, a dramatic opus that is the endless tale of possessed self-dispossessors; be- cause - unlike O'Neill and like Artaud - we confess now to never really having believed that the discovery of the wand already in the possession of another was a situation before which we are powerless, must destroy ourselves. The wand, as Artaud's journey to the Land of the Tarahumara shows, can be - if not stolen, an act that would confirm the proprietary right - earned. IV If Artaud, too, in his way dreamt the eve of history-as-the- time-of-dispossession, of all those doublings and repetitions that (under the names of God, Being, and a certain dialectics) come to rob the self and its theater of presence, he will thus be seen to have been very close to O'Neill. The difference, consumate because it derives from the greatest similarity, lies in the difference between two kinds of reaction to the loss of originary presence. Faced with the "same" insight, Artaud and O'Neill do "act" differently and that difference can reveal, in a limited</page><page sequence="9">Joseph J. Moleski 335 way, the difference between a theater that would erase repetition from the "standpoint" of the origin (Artaud's) and a theater that seeks to ceaselessly reactivate the origin of repetition (O'Neill's). The line, taken rigorously, is imperceptible, a threshold, the difference between a before and an after, between a cruel generosity and a generous cruelty. In a passage cited by Derrida, Artaud writes: ". . . as for my forces,/ they are only the supplement,/ the supplement of an actual state,/ it is that there has never been an origin."l9 In O'Neill's Strange Interlude, we read: ". . . the only living life is in the past and future ... the present is an interlude in which we call on past and future to bear witness we are living."20 Contrasting the recognition of the absent ground, basis of a whole metaphysics and its theater, to the situation of the un- divided voice within that absence of the present, these quotations show us the difference between Artaud and O'Neill at its most acute. Strange Interlude expresses much, if not all, of O'Neill's response to the dissipation of force and disruption of presence so unremittingly denounced by Artaud. It is a drama of the loss of presence, of the origin insofar as it is representable within language, a certain language; O'Neill is rigorous in his exclusion of presence in this drama in which virtually every scene is prospective or retrospective, deferral of consumation until its possibility has become merely the memory of what was apparently possible, allusion to an elsewhere. It is a drama purged almost completely of all but speech. Its law of operation is that of the "compensating substitute" (p. 166), as one of the characters calls it, simply repeating the irrationality of the con- cept of mimetic representation. For if the "substitute" merely doubles, "stands in for," a presence or present that could appear in its own right, for what does it "compensate," com- pensation requiring a previous defect, partiality, absence?21 Nevertheless, the description, delivered by one of the characters a propos a particular situation within the play, cannot be localized in its significance because it exposes the law of the working of language itself: language as the mimesis of the object forever announces itself as the "compensating substitute" for a thing, a self, that can always be recovered, whose absence is not fundamental but accidental, temporary, conditional. The present can always be restored, even if it is only the articulation</page><page sequence="10">336 Comparative Drama of the loss of the present, a "call" upon the past and the future to affirm existence. In the figure - more accurately, in the voice - of Nina, the "central" character, we find dramatized precisely the thirst for presence amidst a succession of unsatisfactory substitutes, dis- placements, deferrals that beset that thirst. The events that set this chain of "compensating substitutes" in motion, that account for the lack that inaugurates these series, that beget desire and memory, as in the whole of the tradition that interprets language metaphysically, are made to appear as catastrophes coming from the outside: the incursion of war, the genetic accident, etc. Had war not destroyed Gordon Shaw, for example, eternalizing the desire for consumation in an endless succession of surrogates to atone for an initial deferral; had not a hereditary defect arisen to drive Nina to further substitutions, substitutions for substitutions; fulfillment, it seems, the negation of past and future in the living present, could have been achieved. Every- where and always, Strange Interlude accounts for the absences that some form of surrogation must come to cover, redeem, as the result of empirical, accidental, catastrophic events that come to contaminate, to disrupt.22 As in the relation between Self and Other, so, too, in lan- guage: the Professor's library, within which the Greek and Latin that death has historically befallen are entombed, provides a context for some of the play's most passionate utterances about the emptiness of words and the prerogatives of life and its speech. In that library, itself a metaphor and projection of the self that withdraws from the call of the present, the distance between the self and the present is explained by recourse to psychology: it is the effect of a cowardice and allows for the play of a variety of other emotions. In the library, "secure with the culture of the past at his back, a fugitive from reality can view the present safely from a distance, as a superior with condescending disdain, pity, and even amusement," as the stage directions tell us. In other words, with a certain cruelty that is the effect of an unnecessary non-participation, the result of fear or the desire for superiority. Thus far, we have seen a pattern of valoration take shape that is highly traditional in all its elements. Psychology, history, genetics, and a variety of other disciplines are called upon to so shape the play as to account for the loss of presence and the</page><page sequence="11">Joseph /. Moleski 337 present; to make absence, distance, death derivative, equipped as we are with explanatory events and states that make them seem inessential, non-originary, above all non-linguistic. Char- acters who refuse the call of the present like the Professor are condemned; those like Nina who accept it are praised. But how are we to explain the very profusion of explanation of the differences that divide the self from itself, the present from itself, if not as the hysterical reaction to, or repression of, absence, distance, death in all its forms? The very profusion of explanation registers in reverse the recognition against which the speaking self must defend itself, that absence is not "acci- dental," the acute suspicion that loss is not loss at all but original difference, division at and of the origin . . . and that it inhabits even the calling voice itself. If the whole of Strange Interlude can be read as a defense of the possibility of presence and the present against radical absence, such an interpretation must take account of the play's most obviously innovative "technical" achievement, the presen- tation of internal monologue in alternation with mundane speech. On the one hand, this technique brings a strong de- constructive force to bear on what could be called the "Roman- tic" view of subjectivity: "thought" or the internal monologue, traditionally taken to be situated in some inner reserve of absolute self-proximity within which no interruptive distance that would turn this interior into a theater need neccessarily arise, is directly staged, with no apparent denaturing of that "thought." In fact, much of the play's interest derives from the characters' reactions to this "thought" with which they can have a specular relation. Marsden, for example, is said to "stare idly at his drifting thoughts" (p. 4). From this point of view, Strange Interlude delivers a liberating blow against the illusion of a privileged, pure interiority lying beyond/ above language and the world. At the level of spectacle, however, the case is different: this abrogation of the difference between thought and speech, in- teriority and exteriority, representation and presence, is an act performed by and for the theatrical spectacle. The interiority that the characters will themselves, mark off, refuse to put in circulation, is simply negated, sacrificed to the collected spec- tators and the authority of the spectacle. The act is simultane- ously a castigation of the impulse to withdraw/preserve and an</page><page sequence="12">338 Comparative Drama implicit claim that this withholding is only illusory. The specta- tor is allowed to watch this dispossession of interiority, survive his own death, secure in his distance and putative difference from the figures on the stage. And it is this that turns Strange Interlude into a Mass, a ritual of human sacrifice, one precisely to the God that Artaud struggled with - the interloper or thief who always already has dispossessed me of my speech, divided me from myself. The ritual of the author/ god who steals from the self its own self -proximity is celebrated in Strange Interlude, renewing the acceptance of that original theft in the assembled spectators. The proximity here between these two men of the theater is so great that, if we were to image it, we would say that Artaud himself - whose cardinal demand was for a total exposure, an absolute self-expenditure without reserve in reality and not in theatrical illusion - is the victim of O'Neill's sacri- ficial theater. We touch, perhaps, the uttermost difference within a nearly complete similarity when we juxtapose these two voices that cry out as if to one another across the threshold of history- as-dispossession: My three men! ... I feel their desires converge in me! ... to form one complete beautiful male desire . . . which I absorb . . . and am whole . . . they dissolve in me, their life is my life ... I am pregnant with the three! . . . husband! . . . lover! . . . father! . . . and the fourth man! . . . little man! . . . little Gordon! ... he is mine too! . . . that makes it perfect! . . . Strange Interlude, p. 135. I, Antonin Artaud, am my son, my father, my mother, my self . . . "Here Lies"23 V As O'Neill's early plays stage the sacrifice of thought to poetry, the late works, like those of Stravinsky's neoclassical phase, perform the sacrifice of poetry to thought. Adorno's description of the later works of Stravinsky could stand as an interpretation of plays like Long Day's Journey Into Night and The Iceman Cometh: "Out of the disintegration of the subject it [objectivistic music] designs for itself the aesthetic integration of the world. It recoins in counterfeit the destructive law of society itself - of absolute power, that is - as the constructive law of authenticity. The farewell trick of Stravinsky - who other-</page><page sequence="13">Joseph J. Moleski 339 wise, in an elegant gesture, renounced everything astonishing - is the enthroning of the self -forgotten negative as the self-con- scious positive."24 Long Day's Journey Into Night: a play written "with deep pity and understanding and forgiveness for all the four haunted Tyrones."25 In the play, "understanding," the word itself already including forgiveness and pity (the emotion Nietzsche dreaded most and Artaud labored against in the Theater of Cruelty), is the acceptance of the self and other as products, as the necessary effects, of the past to which all generative power and substan- tiality is relegated. Tyrone says: "Mary! For God's sake, forget the past!" And Mary, with a "strange objective calm" replies: "Why? How can I? The past is the present, isn't it? It's the future, too. We all try to lie out of that but life won't let us" (p. 87). Understanding here is the capitulation to the past, not in a recognition of its role in the construction of the present, but in its co-extension with the present and future. Thus, under- standing is always already the understanding of fate and itself a fatality. Fate, pure objectivity, is the obverse of the doctrine of presence. This theater of understanding, of understanding understood as a fundamentally passive relation to a priority that has assumed complete authority, can only endlessly stage one thing: the gift of the mother's bridal gown to the father. At the play's conclu- sion, Mary, now deep in a narcotic state, re-enters: "Over one arm, carried neglectfully, trailing on the floor, as if she had forgotten she held it, is an old-fashioned white satin wedding gown . . ." (p. 170). To the father's question, "What's that she's carrying, Edmund?" the son replies, "Her wedding gown, I suppose." Then Tyrone "gets to his feet and stands directly in her path - in anguish. Mary! Isn't it bad enough - ? (controlling himself - gently persuasive.) Here, let me take it, dear. You'll only step on it and tear it and get it dirty dragging it on the floor. Then you'd be sorry afterwards. (She lets him take it, regarding him from somewhere far away within herself, without recognition, without either affection or animosity") (pp. 171- 72). Mutely, the sons watch the act, the consummation of the play Long Day's Journey and of every other theater of memory and understanding as objectivity: the repossession by the father of the bridal gown, sign of virginity, virgin sign, the pure present. Like Jones before the wand of the sorcerer, the sons</page><page sequence="14">340 Comparative Drama watch, never even tentatively raising a hand to intervene, never questioning, their sonship confirmed/reconstituted in the act. To be a son is to be condemned to watch endlessly this recon- firmation of the father's proprietary right, the celebration of the power of sheer anteriority; is to understand. Long Day's Journey Into Night stages the impossibility of any dialectical confrontation with the past: on the one hand, there is an immutable, inviolable past that simply is, right or wrong; on the other, is its product that only through willful ignorance, through a deluded sense of "originality" or "authen- ticity," can assert its own inaugural power, can possesses itself at all. Within this framework of filiation, given this familiali- zation of the relationship between self and other within history, no non-violent solution is possible. The best that can occur is to travel the interval between a past from which we were absent and its repetition; to inhabit for a while that numbed passage of time when, for a moment, there is an apparent uncertainty about the ultimate recipient of the wedding gown, before the circle closes upon itself. Under the given conditions, O'Neill's, however, we were never really ever in doubt about the gown's destination. The wand of the magician, the bridal gown of the mother: between these two reflected dispossessions we have tried to show something of O'Neill's addiction to a certain form of cruelty, the cruelty to which one perhaps must yield if one respects the limits of the possible, respects the factuality of the subjugation of writing to speech, of difference to identity. But, to this possibility, we can reply with the Manifestos of the Theater of Cruelty and the music Schoenberg finally came to write. Both are thoroughly proleptic; both total in their demand; both essentially articulating what is impossible and therefore most worthy of hope. The one premeditates an invis- ible theater, the other an inaudible music.26 Kalamazoo, Michigan</page><page sequence="15">Joseph J.

A single, inanimate, unchanging "reality" beyond phenomena is the prerequisite of a "stylist" like O'Neill who draws his freedom, animation, richness from the fact that all these styles as styles are equally distant from an origin. 3 From a letter to Arthur Hobson Quinn, in O'Neill and His Plays, ed. Oscar Cargill, N. Bryllion Fagin, William J. Fisher (New York: New York Univ. Press, 1964), p. 125. 4 The reference, of course, is to Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy and the claim of an aesthetic justification of suffering. For a rhetorical reading of this text and an interpretation of that claim that is completely the reverse of O'Neill's, see Paul de Man, Allegories of Reading: Figurai Language in Rousseau, Nietzsche, Rilke, and Proust (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1979) where he shows that Nietzsche's state- ment "should not be taken too serenely, for it is an indictment of existence rather than a panegyric of art" (p. 93). 5 On the ensnarement of Western language in the onto-theological constitution of Western metaphysics, a fact manifested in the historical project of phonetic writ- ing, see all the works of Jacques Derrida, especially Speech and Phenomena and Other Essays on Husserl' s Theory of Signs, trans. David B. Allison (Evanston: Northwestern Univ. Press, 1973); Of Grammatology, trans. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1976); and "La Pharmacie de Platon," in La Dissémination (Paris: Éditions du Seuil, 1912), pp. 69-197. б My remarks throughout this essay and especially those on Artaud draw on Derrida's reading of Artaud's argument with the single, coherent system of Western metaphysics and theater. Though Derrida refers throughout his published works to Artaud, he discusses him directly in "La Parole Soufflée" and "The Theater of Cruelty and the Closure of Representation," Writing and Difference, trans. Alan Bass (Chi- cago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1978), pp. 169-96 and pp. 232-51. 7 The description is quoted by Derrida, "The Theater of Cruelty and the Closure of Representation," p. 232. 8 "La Parole Soufflée," p. 191. 9 Nietzsche's description of the folk song, read without the vigilance de Man calls for, accurately reflects O'Neill's sense of it and defines the kind of function folk song plays in O'Neill's works: "But what is the folk song in contrast to the wholly Apollonian epos? What else but the perpetuum vestigium of a union of the Apollonian and Dionysian?" - F. Nietzsche, Birth of Tragedy, trans. Walter Kauf- mann (New York: Vintage Books, 1967), p. 53. O'Neill implicitly interprets the folk song in this manner, ignoring the adjective "perpetuum," i.e., he implicitly ignores the fact that the folk song is the trace (vestigium) of a present, a unity, that never was (a) present. Music can have, for O'Neill, the wholeness, the self-subsisting being, that drama cannot possess; but, by another interpretation, music is the wholeness drama does not wish to possess, i.e., is relieved of attempting to achieve, as Artaud seeks to achieve it. 10 Philosophy of Modern Music, trans.

Similarly, Derrida describes Artaud's theater of cruelty as a theater delivered from appearance: "The Theater of Cruelty and the Closure of Representation," p. 249.</page></plain_text>
