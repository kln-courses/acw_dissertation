NOVIKOFF Biology Department , Brooklyn College WE bomb MUST in hope New that Mexico, the explosion another of on a Hiro- small bomb in New Mexico, another on Hiro- shima, a third on Nagasaki, and a few more on some warships in the Pacific Ocean will be enough to rouse the peoples of the world to act, in sufficient strength and in time, to pre- vent atom bombs from destroying us all. Is it too much to hope that there will come also a general recognition in society and in our schools that our educational system, "from the cradle to the Ęh.D . . . adjusting to changes decades late ... is still founded on non-scientific scholasticism"?2 For many years before the atom bomb we had been living in a scientific age. Many of our people albeit too few, have for some time been enjoying benefits of our advanced sci- ence. But even today only a handful under- stand the universe, about them. This is a com- mentary both on the limited educational op- portunities offered our people and the inade- quate science teaching in our schools. The average citizen has always wanted to learn and to understand. Witness the popu- larity of natural sciences at institutions like the Jefferson School of Social Science, where ma- ture men and women come to class after a long day at office or factory. Unquestionably the need for adult education will increase in the "Atomic Age". Society, schools, and sci- ence teachers must prepare to meet this de- mand adequately. THESE come MEN science and specialists. women do Neither not wish do to most be- come science specialists.

These aims can be simply stated: to help the indi- vidual understand phenomena in the world about him, and 2) to teach the social rela- tions of science so that the individual under- stands the role of science in modern society and can act intelligently on scientific matters. Genuine science teaching should emphasize neither rote learning of fact upon fact, nor the mastery of certain techniques; it should stress basic principles and social implications of the subject. It should help our students, includ- ing the future specialists, to become human beings. We want them to be world citizens who understand the essential one-ness of all mankind. And we want them to act upon that understanding - to help eliminate from society all practices based upon prejudice. We need men and women able to resist the prejudice and pressures which overcame the German na- tion, scientists along with the rest. Of the specialists as of the general citizen we expect a deep sense of social values. We expect the scientists to take part in shaping the "Atomic Age" with some of the same vigor displayed in shaping the atom bomb. TO ILLUSTRATE and explain basic prin- ■ ciples, a careful selection of facts is neces- sary. The more these facts center about prob- lems of everyday life, the more significant will the principles be to the student. Facts and principles need to be presented so as to con- vey : 1 ) the manner in which science develops, 2) the way in which relationships are sought and discovered in known facts, and 3) how the discovery of these relationships leads to new facts. The significance of newly-discov- ered facts, and areas still unknown, needs to be discussed so as to demonstrate that science NOVEMBER, 1 947 157</page><page sequence="2">is a constantly expanding body of knowledge and not a closed catalogue of facts. To provide understanding, it is not enough simply to describe things. It is essential that we explain them, that we show cause and effect relationships at every point A frequent complaint of medical school in- structors, writes a college professor in a com- munication to Science , is that "college fails most seriously in the formal education of the student. Their faculty of logical reasoning and independent thinking are not sufficiently de- veloped".' And we have all heard college in- structors complain that students are trained in the high schools simply to follow teacher and text blindly and to regurgitate at the expected moment what they have been previously spoon- fed in predigested form. I suspect that many high school teachers have similar complaints about elementary school teaching. WHY reasoning ARE students and independent slow to develop thought" "logical ? That reasoning and independent thought" ? That the fault lies with our teaching is suggested by the results of a recent study on the develop- ment of children's concepts of casual relations. Seven hundred and thirty-two boys and girls, ranging in age from 8 to 16, in grades 3 to 8 in three Minneapolis schools, were asked ques- tions about physical phenomena, beginning usually with "Why?" or "What causes?" Their answers were judged in terms of ade- quacy as explanations of the phenomena. The results indicate that "training or experience, as acquired through the schools, outweighs in- telligence or innate maturational factors in de- termining the ability of children to answer the questions of this test . . . Undoubtedly maturation and innate factors have a delimit- ing effect on casual thinking, but the answers to specific questions are more closely related to school experience and whatever that im- plies in the way of direct or indirect instruc- tion and training."4 This is further borne out by the virtual absence of correct casual relations in the thinking about biological phenomena on the part of college students, even those who have had high school biology and the traditional 3 - Viktor Hamburger, "Biology in the Premedicai Curriculum", Science, vol. 102, 1945, p. 511. 4 - Jean Marquis Deutsche: "The Development of Children's Concepts of Casual Relations", in Barker, Kounin and Wright: "Child Behavior and Development", New York, 1943, p. 129. college course in General Biology. "Why does the heart beat?" To bring food-laden blòod to all cells of the organism. "Why does the leaf bend to the light?" To intercept more energy for photosynthesis. There is no awareness that ascribing such purposive behavior to the heart or the plant imparts the ability to reason and to look into the future, in one case to a small individual part of the organism, and in the other, to an organism which lacks a nervous system, let alone a brain ! How amazed the students are when they hear for the first time that the answers to these ques- tions require a discussion of cardiac muscle contraction, in the first case, and the distribu- tion and activity of plant growth hormones, in the second case. SURELY the nature it is of not the the phenomena inherent difference which ac- in the nature of the phenomena which ac- counts for the absence of correct casual think- ing about biological phenomena by students who already think correctly about physical phenomena. It stems in large measure from a basic failing of biojogy teaching. The teach- er of biology needs to make a determined ef- fort to overcome the carry-over from the anthropomorphism of early childhood, in which animals and plants are endowed with human physical and social attributes. Yet I dare say that most science teachers in elemen- tary and high schools and many instructors of college biology are blissfully unaware of the problem. Let us agree that our task is to develop the individual's "logical reasoning and independ- ent thinking" as we teach the social relations of science and important scientific principles necessary for an understanding of problems of current life. If we are to succeed in this task, a certain change of attitude on the part of Boards of Education and Boards of Estimate seems necessary. They need to recognize a few ele- mentary pedagogic realities. How can a labor- atory class of 40 students in high school chem- istry be taught adequately? How can one laboratory be sufficient for 500 students of chemistry? (This is the situation in one of our best New York high schools). How can you develop "independent thought" in biology class when inadequate provision is made for Continued on Page 184 158 THE SCIENCE TEACHER</page><page sequence="3">ATOMIC AGE Continued from Page 158 laboratory work? And, on the college level, is the trend towards larger and larger lec- ture classes, with 200 or 400 students in one room, likely to help develop "logical reason- ing" as much as it will gratify the budget- trimmers? SUCH severe PROBLEMS in the "Atomic will Age". surely become There will more be severe in the "Atomic Age". There will be an increased interest in science on the part of the general student, particularly if our teach- ing is geared to his interests. And there will be an increased number of students training to become science specialists. The war has catalyzed the growing need for specialists in several ways: 1) by the enormous expansion of scientific research undertaken because of necessity, to supply the means of victory; 2) by the drafting of college men without re- gard to the scientific and technical post-war needs of the nation, thereby creating a great deficit of specialists in all fields of science which must now be made up; and 3) by the widespread dissemination of scientific knowl- edge to members of the Armed Forces, result- ing in the discovery by many men and women, who might otherwise not have known it, of the fascination which science holds for them and their aptitude for it. The future appears to call for more science teachers, moře labora- tories, more visual aids and other equipment. Essential for the success of our task is an interest on the part of all teachers of science in the promotion of science teaching at all levels. This interest must extend at least to the point of being familiar with what the sci- ence teachers are trying to achieve at each level. Mr. Charles Gramet, Administrative Assistant in one of New York's high schools./ is to be applauded for pleading, through the pages of Science , that college science profes- sors not "remain aloof" from the problems of high school science education." It is bordering on irresponsible negligence for a college teach- er of freshman science to be unconcerned with what the high schools have attempted in his 6 - Charles A.
