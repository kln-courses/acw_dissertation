ROGERS 4014 Skyline Drive Farmington, New Mexico 87401 ABSTRACT The Shield Bearing Warrior image is widely distributed in Native American rock art of the western United States but is generally found east of the Continental Divide. The origin of the image is uncertain but its appearance in this large geographic area began somewhere around the twelfth or thirteenth century. This paper examines the presence of the icon in the Navajo era of the seventeenth through the nineteenth century in an extensive region west of the Divide. The image itself is described and its possible symbolism and causes for its disap- pearance are considered. RESUMEN La imagen del Guerrero Blandiendo un Escudo se ha distribuido ampliamente en el arte rupestre del oeste de los Estados Unidos. Sin embargo, se encuentra con mayor frecuencia al este del Continental Divide. El origen de la imagen es incierto pero su aparicidn en esta gran drea geogrdfica comenz6 alrededor de los siglos doce o trece. Este documento examina la presencia del icono en la era Navajo entre los siglos diecisiete a diecinueve en una extensa regi6n al oeste del Divide. Asimismo, se describe la imagen, su posible simbolismo y, ademdts, se consideran las causas de su desaparacidn. The Shield Bearing Warrior is a common motif in western American rock art and has been reported from Canada to Mexico and from Kansas to Oregon. It is also one of the most studied icons and perhaps bears the distinction of being one of the first reported rock art images in the U.S. Southwest. On September 9, 1776, Fathers Dominguez and Escalante were on their epic journey to discover a route from New Mexico to California. In what is now known as Rio Blanco County, Colorado, they wrote: Halfway down this canyon toward the south there is a quite lofty rock cliff on which we saw, crudely painted, three shields or 'Apache shields,' of hide, and a spearhead. Farther down on the north side we saw another painting which supposedly represented two men in combat. For this reason we named it El Cafion Pintado... (Chavez and Warner 1995:49). These sites have been relocated and the three shields partially hide the bodies of anthropomorphs and so would now be described as shield bearers (Gebhard 1966:721). The Shield Bearing Warrior may be defined as an anthropomorph standing behind a large disc that covers most of the body. The legs are often depicted and are</page><page sequence="2">248 ROGERS usually portrayed in profile, suggesting a direction of motion. The arms, when present, are upraised and the hands sometimes grasp an object. The head usually includes representations of the eyes, nose, and mouth, and upturned homs are commonly portrayed as well. A weapon often protrudes from behind the shield. After Dominguez and Escalante, interest in the Shield Bearing Warrior waned for some 150 years. Morss (1931) reported the image in Utah and associated it with the Fremont culture. Wormington (1955) examined the problem of the shield bearer in Fremont rock art more closely and published numerous examples both from her work in Utah and similar petroglyphs and pictographs found in Montana (Wormington 1955, Figs. 49, 51, 60, 61, and 62). She postulated, on the basis of the rock art, that there was either a migration of the Fremont to the north or, more likely, a dissemina- tion of the image from the plains into the Great Basin (Wormington 1955:186). Because of the concentration of shield bearing images in southern Montana as well as in Alberta and Wyoming, much research has been done in that region. Keyser and Klassen (2001) and Francis and Loendorf (2002) have recently published comprehensive studies of the rock art of that area and include sections on the Shield Bearing Warrior symbols. They summarize evidence for the ethnicities of the artists that includes Fremont, Shoshone, Crow, Cheyenne, Sioux, Blackfoot, and Athapaskan. Moyer (1999) also considered this confusion of ethnicity and concluded that the Shield Bearing Warrior was a symbol common to the Plains Indian tradition in the period immediately prior to the advent of the horse. Gebhard (1966) examined the problem of diffusion closely and suggested that perhaps the symbol arose in Mexico, passed through the Anasazi to the Fremont, and then to the northern plains. It then traveled south again and entered the later Pueblo iconography. As Gebhard (1966:730-731) stated: "If this suggested pattern of diffusion is correct, it represents an intriguing phenomenon of a cultural element completing an almost full circle over a number of centuries and over a large geographic area." More recent evidence seems to refute a circuitous route of diffusion over such a long period of time, but instead indicates that, beginning in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the image rapidly became a pan-Native American symbol throughout the west. Closer to the geographic area of Navajo era rock art, Schaafsma (2000) has produced the most comprehensive summary of shields, shield bearers, and other Pueblo war images in the Southwest. She suggests that the Shield Bearing Warrior is of probable Mexican origin and first appeared on the Pueblo II-III/Fremont frontier late in the thirteenth century. She is then able to trace it directly to the Pueblo IV rock and kiva art of the Rio Grande. It is not the purpose of the present paper to investigate the origin or early diffusion of this ubiquitous image but instead to chronicle its demise. The shield bearer seems to disappear from Pueblo iconography shortly after the arrival of the Spaniards with their suppression of Native American religion, and from the Plains with the advent of horse warfare. Among the Navajo, however, the Shield Bearing Warrior icon continued well into the nineteenth century.</page><page sequence="3">The Shield Bearing Warrior in Navajo Era Rock Art 249 Navajo shield bearers have been noted by others but no specific study of the images has been conducted. The most popular of these are included in the present study: Figure 1 appears in Roessel (1983:6) and Schaafsma (1980, Plate 30) and Figure 2 is shown by Roessel (1983:30) and Schaafsma (1975, Fig. 38; 1980, Fig. 37). At least a dozen shield bearer images are known in northwestern New Mexico and several are found elsewhere. Chronology is essential in establishing cultural affiliation of rock art and none of these images have been accurately dated; therefore, the term "Navajo era" will be used. As none of the artists either signed or dated their work, ethnicity of the workmen can only be surmised. Although most of the rock art in the areas to be described is thought to be of Navajo origin, Copeland (2001) points out that Pueblo peoples were known to have been in the area of northwestern New Mexico at the same time as the Navajos, and some of the rock art images there bear a perhaps more than coincidental similarity to Pueblo imagery. This study is confined to that of the Shield Bearing Warrior and does not examine images of anthropomorphs holding disc-shaped objects to one side or to the numerous discs often designated as shields, although these are found in the immediate areas. Discs can represent many things, including not only shields, but also celestial bodies such as the sun and moon, other presently unrecognized symbolisms, or even two- dimensional representations of three-dimensional objects such as spheres. This uncertainty led Copeland and Rogers (1996:223) to term these frequently encoun- tered icons as "big round things," or "BRTs." THE SHIELD BEARING WARRIOR IN DINETAH ROCK ART Dinetah is a Navajo word describing an area of northwestern New Mexico that traditional Navajos consider to be their homeland. To these people it is a land of myth and legend and, as such, can have no set geographical boundaries. Navajos would define it simply as the land of mesas and canyons that surrounds two sacred mountains, now known as Gobernador Knob and Huerfano Mesa, and the place where certain sacred events occurred. We of a twenty-first century mindset, however, cannot allow such vagueness and so a more formal definition is offered. Dinetah may be described as being roughly bounded to the north by the Colorado- New Mexico border, to the east and southeast by the Continental Divide, to the south and northwest by the route of present-day U.S. Highway 550, and on the west along the Animas River back to the state borders. Great canyons that come down from the Continental Divide to join the San Juan and Animas rivers charac- terize the landscape and these canyons contain hundreds of miles of cliff faces that have served as canvases for rock artists for well over 1,000 years. Archaeological evidence places the Navajo in Dindtah as early as A.D. 1541 (Hancock 1997), but most of the investigated sites are from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (Towner 1997). As no Shield Bearing Warrior images have been found in</page><page sequence="4">250 ROGERS Figure 1. Shield Bearing Warrior, Crow Canyon, Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. Shield diameter 75 cm.

Shield diameter 45 cm. Photograph by the author.</page><page sequence="6">252 ROGERS association with dated sites, the time period for the placement of the icons on the rock must remain uncertain. Schaafsma (1963:55), in her seminal work on Navajo rock art, concluded that the Navajo era images were created in the eighteenth century, influenced by Pueblo refugees fleeing the 1792-1796 Spanish reconquest of the Rio Grande and other pueblos. Copeland and Rogers (1996:219-222) pointed out that several of the Navajo era pictographs and petroglyphs bear strong resemblances to known seven- teenth century and earlier Pueblo kiva art and could well date before the time of the 1680 Pueblo Revolt. It would seem, then, that the Dindtah Navajo era rock art, including the Shield Bearing Warrior images, were produced sometime in the seven- teenth and eighteenth centuries regardless of the ethnicity of their artists. There is a temptation with the collected shield bearer images of the Navajo era to note their similarities to shield bearer images of other geographical areas and other cultures. For instance, Figures 3a and 3b can be compared to images of the Fremont, Figures 3c and 3d to those of the northern Plains, and Figures 1 and 2 to those in the Gallisteo Basin. This temptation shall be resisted. Given a view of all of the published Shield Bearing Warrior images, randomly chosen and without benefit of provenance, it is difficult to properly identify geographical area of origin or ethnic artistry. Almost monotonous in their similarity, the images seem to differ most in the artistic abilities of their creators and individual variations of the icons. The Shield Bearing Warriors of Dindtah are thus described both as to their similarities and their differences. Geographic Distribution Dindtah is a large piece of real estate covering more than 600,000 ha (about 1,500,000 acres). The Shield Bearing Warrior images are scattered about this area with no seemingly chosen pattern, and no single icon, save the conjoined pair illustrated in Figure 3h, occurs within at least several kilometers of another. There is also no apparent directional orientation to the symbol and the images were placed on cliff faces seemingly without regard to compass bearing. Finally, there seems to be no obvious correlation of shield bearers with other images on the panels of rock art on which they are located. Sometimes making up a single image on a panel, they may also be found mingled with game animals, equestrians, known and uniden- tified Navajo Holy People, etc. The Shields Dindtah shields are round; no examples are known with a square, oval or other shape. That they are shields rather than a part of a round or globular bodied anthropomorph is demonstrated by the transparencies, or x-ray forms, which reveal the anthropomorphs behind them (Figs. 3c and 3d). In every case the shield covers the entire torso of the anthropomorph.</page><page sequence="7">The Shield Bearing Warrior in Navajo Era Rock Art 253 g ( a b c d e f g h Figure 3.

These large, full-bodied shields are known in archaeological and historical contexts. Schaafsma (2000:9) notes that the few Anasazi shields found thus far are of massive basketry construction. Dimensions are not given but those observed while on public display would easily cover the torso of the wielder. The Pectol shields of hide, discovered in Utah and dating ca. A.D. 1500, are also of this full-body</page><page sequence="8">254 ROGERS style. Loendorf and Conner (1993:222), in their examination of these artifacts, note historical records that describe these large shields being carried into battle by pedestrian warriors on the northern Plains. Once horse warfare began, these large shields proved cumbersome, and smaller, more easily handled shields were adopted. Shield design is denoted in Figures 2, 3a, 3d, 3e, and 3f. Figure 3d has two plus signs thought to represent stars. Figure 3e has circles on one-half of the shield face and stripes on the other. Ceremonial practitioners and other traditional Navajos who have viewed this image believe this pattern represents night and day, the circles representing heavenly bodies and the stripes, sunrays. The shield design of Figure 3a is thought by some to represent a cloud with rain falling from it. Figure 3f has a circle divided into quadrants as a central motif, denoting the four directions, the Four Sacred Mountains, or some other metaphysical concept. Figure 2 has a complicated pattern of triangles. Roessel (1983:6) interpreted this as an image of Monster Slayer holding a flint shield and the petroglyph is known locally as "Flint Armor Man." Once again, however, Navajo ceremonialists and traditionalists who have viewed this icon with the author feel that it is J6hoona' i, the Sun Bearer, holding shd', the sun disc or shield. The design on the shield represents sunbeams and the way the shield glistens in the sky. All five of these designs seem to represent geophysical or celestial phenomena: rainfall, day and night, the sun, stars, and the four directions or Four Sacred Mountains. The Franciscan Fathers (1910:317) collected ethnological data from the Navajos at the beginning of the twentieth century and noted, "the outer surface of the shield was richly emblazoned with figures relating to war, such as figures of the sun, half sun, rainbow, crescent, a bear's foot, and the Slayer of Enemies." Kluckhohn et al. (1971:245) suggested that shield design reflected the particular war way or war ceremonial used by the individual warrior. The Din6tah sample is perhaps too small to confirm or refute the recorded anthropological data. The Anthropomorphs The shield bearers are seen face on except for those depicted with a feather head- dress. Heads are round with the exception of Figures 1 and 3e. From ethnological data collected from the Navajo for over a century, head shapes of the Holy People are important in ceremonial iconography. Matthews (1902:19) collected infor- mation about the dry paintings of the Night Chant and noted, "The most important distinction presented in the pictures between male and female characters is that the former are shown with round masks and the latter with quadrangular masks. The quadrangular mask always indicates the female...." Reichard (1974:156) disagreed with this simplistic evaluation, believing that there are many exceptions, and noted variations in head shape not only between different chant ways but within the same ceremony as well.</page><page sequence="9">The Shield Bearing Warrior in Navajo Era Rock Art 255 Arms are rudimentary when depicted, and appear as lines, triangles, or "stick figure" drawings; fingers are rarely shown and vary in number. The legs show more anatomical attention and are seen in profile with the calves emphasized. All of the Din6tah shield bearers studied to date show their legs and feet facing to the right, possibly indicating a direction of motion. Although the number is small, this 100 percent correlation may have some significance. Faces are depicted with eyes and mouth. The triangular left eye of Figure 3i is exceptional and unexplained. The male figure on the left of Figure 3h is apparently phallic while his conjoined mate is not. The shield bearer in Figure 3g is depicted at a 450 angle from vertical and in that respect is unique among the anthropomorphic imagery of Dinetah. These and other variations undoubtedly once had meaning to the artists but are now unexplained. As Schaafsma (Muench and Schaafsma 1995:16) has so succinctly stated: "[R]ock art is an artifact of ideas." Material Culture Two of the images carry lances (Figs. 3c and 3d) while three have bows (Figs. 1, 3e, and 3g). That these are recurved, or double curved bows, has some signifi- cance. LeBlanc (1999:99-103) recorded that the recurved bow appeared in the U.S. Southwest sometime between A.D. 1200 and A.D. 1450, while Baldwin (1997:7-8) put it at sometime after A.D. 1300 and argued that its introduction was due to Apache influences. I have noted previously (Rogers 2001:45-46) that in the Dindtah region, the recurved bow clearly marks crudely drawn hunting scenes to be of the Navajo era while the simpler self bow denotes Anasazi work. This would seem to hold true for the Shield Bearing Warrior images as well. The "flying" shield bearer in Figure 3g is rich in weaponry detail. He is reaching for a recurved bow and an arrow; that the bowstring does not touch the tips of the bow undoubtedly has some symbolic significance. Across his back is a quiver, either fringed at the top or holding more arrows. The pendant-like object at- tached to the quiver is probably either the bow case or the tail of the animal whose skin was used in the making of the quiver. Kluckhohn et al. (1971:46-51) described the manufacture of the Navajo quiver and noted that mountain lion hide was the preferred material. The tail of the animal was retained and allowed to hang free. Figure 3e also shows a wealth of detail. The image holds a recurved bow in the left hand and a rattle or some other ceremonial item in the right. In current Navajo religious philosophy, the right hand is the "feminine" side, given to careful thinking and planning, and the rattle is always held in that hand during ceremonies. The left hand is the "masculine" side, the side of action. Navajo ceremonial practitioners who have viewed this image are quite satisfied that it is "made properly." In addition to the important shield decoration, the image also wears ear bobs, the only jewelry shown among the shield bearers of the Navajo era.</page><page sequence="10">256 ROGERS Headdresses are of two types. Feathers are depicted in Figures 3c and 3d. While some could argue that the protrusions from the head of Figure 3d represent some sort of "antenna," the tip of the projection in Figure 3c is carefully made and clearly denotes an eagle feather. Six of the shield bearer images have curved projections portraying bison horns. Bison never inhabited the Dindtah country and yet the animal is well repre- sented in the rock art of the area as the zoomorph itself, homed deities, and other manifestations (Rogers 2002). In Navajo dry painting, only certain deities are homed. Reichard (1974:565) explained: Horns are an evidence of power. Sun may be depicted as a disc with a face, feathers, lightning and rain, but he is considered more powerful if he has horns; the same is true of Moon, Dark Wind and Yellow Wind, Water Monster, Water Horse, Sky and Earth. Snakes of the Wind Chants are horned; those of the Shooting Chants are not. Possibly horns represent shine, glint, or the control of lightning. Shield bearers with horns are known in the Anasazi/ Fremont rock art and are found throughout the northern Plains and among the Pueblo IV period of the Rio Grande. Whether this represents a homed deity such as a buffalo or a mask or headdress for a more humanoid supernatural being is probably not important. Many Navajos of the author's acquaintance shrug and say, "They're all the same." This demonstrates the hazards of interpretation of symbolism of another culture. Artistic Technique All the Dinetah shield bearers are petroglyphs except for Figure 3e. This icon is a pictograph painted in a reddish color with a heavy coating of pigment that has not been identified. Work was done with a brush, and bristle marks in the paint indicate the stroke. The brush appears to have been vegetal, possibly a yucca leaf. The petroglyphs were created by both incising and pecking. It is quite possible that at least some of these images were at one time carved into the rock and then painted, but time and weather have now removed all traces of the colored design. This might explain the "transparent" shields of Figures 3c and 3d. Workmanship in most cases was quite precise. Some of the shields are so nearly true round that a string and sharp tool were probably used initially to circumscribe the outline. It is possible that Figures 3f and 3i are either incomplete, once having the "pictoglyph" appearance suggested above, or unfinished. Figure 4, however, is unique in that it shows an apparent shield figure under construction. In Figure 4, the artist had begun the image by pecking in the outline of the legs and shield. He (or she) had then begun to complete the shield by chiseling between the peck marks to do a "connect the dots" process that would be more accurate and less time consuming than a pure peck or incise method alone. It is interesting that Figure 4. (right) Unfinished Shield Bearing Warrior, Largo Canyon, San Juan County, New Mexico. Shield diameter 45 cm.

Without accurate dating techniques, the time sequence of image manufacture remains as enigmatic as the reason the artist ceased work before completion. In concluding this section on Dinetah shield bearers, several incidental obser- vations not directly related to the subject of this paper should be noted. V-necked or V-shouldered anthropomorphs are common in northern Plains rock art (Francis and Loendorf 2002:132-135; Keyser and Klassen 2001:196-201). Similar figures are found in Din6tah and Schaafsma (1980, Fig. 257) has illustrated several ex- amples. None, however, are associated with shield bearing images. Horses abound in Navajo rock art and have been well studied (Brugge 1976, 1981; James and Davidson 1976). Horses and horsemen are quite common in the Navajo era rock art of Dindtah but no images of equestrians with shields are known. Din6tah imagery is generally thought to be ceremonial in nature and ritual in purpose, while the shield bearing equestrians of Plains rock and robe art are biographical. This perhaps explains their absence in Dindtah. Beginning about 1748 there was a gradual exodus of Navajos from Din6tah to regions to the south and west. A severe drought in 1748 accompanied by lesser droughts in the early 1750s was one cause of this (Brugge 1972), while increased warfare with the Utes was another (Brugge 1963, 1972; Towner et al. 2001). The last firmly dated Navajo site was a pueblito built in 1754 (Towner 1997). Exodus, however, does not necessarily mean total abandonment, and it is possible that some Navajos remained in the area and others returned for religious purposes. The Din6tah rock art tradition could have continued for some time after 1754, but the majority of Navajos were then living to the south and west. THE NAVAJO ERA SHIELD BEARING WARRIOR BEYOND DINETAH Navajo era rock art in the areas to the south of Din6tah has not been well studied. The region south of Chaco Canyon and around Mount Taylor is remote and archaeological investigations have been few. The rock art of Chaco Canyon is presently being carefully documented and no Shield Bearing Warriors have been recorded to date, either from the Anasazi or Navajo eras (Jane Kolber, personal communication 2003). There are two petroglyphs of interest at Chaco, however. Schaafsma (1975:59 and 1992:39) illustrated a shield bearing equestrian image that is horned; location in the canyon is not given. Chaco site CHCU 931 contains an equestrian figure holding up a disc-like object that obscures or replaces the head. Williamson (1983) has noted that CHCU 931 is a sun-watching site for the winter solstice and that the rock art is clearly Navajo. Clark (1966:11-41) recited many myths of the Navajos and Apaches concerning the relationship of the sun and horses, and this shield bearing equestrian may well be Jhhoona'edi, the Sun</page><page sequence="13">The Shield Bearing Warrior in Navajo Era Rock Art 259 God, mounted on his horse and carrying shd', his shield, across the sky. Perhaps this is a later image that has replaced the pedestrian sun bearer in Figure 2. West of the Chuska Mountains and deep within the Navajo Reservation, the classic Shield Bearing Warrior reappears. Grant (1978:235) illustrated five shield bearers in Canyon de Chelly rock art and assigned one of them to the Anasazi era and one to Shoshone authorship. Schaafsma (2000:11) was not so certain and suggested that all may date to the Navajo era. These images have not been reexamined for the present study. Navajo occupation of this western area is known to span at least from the seven- teenth century to the present (Gilpin 1996), making the Navajo era rock art diffi- cult to date with accuracy. A major rock art site in the Middle Chinle drainage emphasizes this point. At Talking Rocks (AZ E:2:5 [ASU]) are images of Anasazi origin and modern Disney characters, with examples of classic Navajo petroglyphs in between. It is here that a typical Shield Bearing Warrior is found (Fig. 5). Anglo-Americans have visited this site at least since the Canby expedition of 1860, but the image was first photographed and published by Morss (1927, Plate 1). Gilpin (2001:64) has given a more detailed description of the site and the rock art and includes a line drawing of the shield bearer. The petroglyph is rendered at about half life-size and the shield is fringed on the outer border and shows a reticu- lated pattern on the disc (Fig. 5). The anthropomorph seems to wear a peaked hat with feather decorations. About such hats the Franciscan Fathers (1910:460-461) wrote: Helmet shaped caps were worn by warriors on raids and journeys, and hung up outside on their return, as good custom forbade the use inside the hogan. They were made of buckskin, though some clans preferred mountain lion and wildcat skins, by which they were usually recognized. The cap was decorated with owl, turkey, crow, and eagle feathers, which hung loosely over the rear of the cap. The onset of usage of such caps by the Navajo is unknown but it was obviously common in the nineteenth century. As shown in Figure 6, James Mooney photo- graphed an "old warrior" with lance, shield, and cap in 1892 and the resemblance of the petroglyph to the photograph is remarkable. It is possible, then, that the shield bearer at Talking Rocks was made in the nineteenth century. One final rock art site is of note. Grant (1978:224-225) discussed and illus- trated a panel located in Canyon del Muerto known as "The Ute Raid Panel." This large layout was done in charcoal and in black paint and depicts a battle fought between the Navajos and Utes that, according to oral history, took place in January 1858. As shown, the attacking Utes are mounted on horses and many carry small shields. The defending Navajos are on foot and at least seven are shield bearers as well. Although biographical in content as well as style, the similarity of the pedestrian anthropomorphs to the Shield Bearing Warriors found elsewhere is striking. The shields fully cover the torsos, the legs are well delin- eated, weapons project from behind the shields, and at least one individual wears a horned headdress.</page><page sequence="14">260 ROGERS Figure 5.

How then does it come to be found so prominently portrayed among the Navajo era images between the Four Sacred Mountains? That the Athapaskans who eventually became the peoples now called Apache came from the Canadian north is generally accepted, but their route of migration and time of arrival in the U.S. Southwest is hotly debated. As far as the Navajo era shield bearer is concerned, the argument is moot. The Athapaskans could have brought the image with them or encountered it along any proposed route, and recorded it on the canyon walls soon after their arrival or much later, when their ceremonialism had undergone changes due to outside influences. Loendorf (1990), working at a shield bearer site in Valley of the Shields, southern Montana, was able to recover the tools used to create the pictographs. Still stained with paint, these implements could be reliably radiocarbon dated to establish the time of creation of the image. The numerical age of the rock art panel was established by radiocarbon at A.D. 1104. Some researchers believe the shield bearing warrior motif was a product of Shoshonean speaking groups, but A.D. 1100 is two to four centuries older than their arrival to the area. Another candidate for the makers of the motif is the Avonlea, who are thought to represent Athabascan movements through the area at this time (Loendorf 1990:45). The earliest dated Southwestern Shield Bearing Warrior pictograph is "The All American Man" found in the Canyonlands country of southwestern Utah (Slifer 2000, Plate 12). Coulam (1992) used radiocarbon methods to place the painting of the image in the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century and ascribed it to the Fremont Culture. Several investigators (Aikens 1966, 1967; Reed 1965) have postulated that the Fremont were of Athapaskan ethnicity. This view is no longer widely held and Grant (1967:62) has stated that "the earliest shield drawings are associated with warfare between the Fremont people and aggressive nomads from the north- probably the Indians later known as Navajo and Apache." If the Athapaskan mi- gration was south through the Great Basin, observation of the shield bearer glyphs would have occurred in that area even if the artists were no longer dwelling there. Keyser (1975) has argued for a Shoshone origin for the Shield Bearing Warrior in Montana and Wyoming based on dates, the distribution of the image and diagnostic Shoshone artifacts, and the ethnohistorically known range of the Plains Shoshone. The Utes, also a Shoshone people, utilized the image, and a classic example of a shield bearer with flintlock pistol is found in Canyon Pintado south of Rangely, Colorado (Slifer 2000:204, Fig. 206). This glyph is attributed to the Utes as are other historic images in the area. If the southerly migrating Athapaskans came by an intermountain route, they could have encountered the shield bearer image among the Shoshones and Utes. It is interesting to note that Canyon Pintado is the canyon traveled by Dominguez</page><page sequence="17">The Shield Bearing Warrior in Navajo Era Rock Art 263 and Escalante in 1776 and where they first described the Shield Bearing Warriors as noted above. They attributed the shields to the Apache. As Utes guided them, they may have obtained this identification from their companions or have learned of shield imagery during their stay on the Rio Grande among the Pueblo peoples. When the great migrations of the Anasazi out of the San Juan Basin began, the Shield Bearing Warrior icon apparently traveled with them. The image appears not only in the rock and kiva art of the Pueblo along the Rio Grande corridor, but also at Zuni and Hopi. Thought to date between A.D. 1325 and 1650, it was a common rock art symbol to most, if not all, of the many language groups making up the Pueblo IV societies. Crotty (2001) and Schaafsma (2000) have examined shield bearer and other war imagery in Pueblo rock and kiva art. Many investigators have noted that there was a significant Pueblo influence on the Navajo era rock art of Dinetah. Schaafsma has written: Navajo rock art of the Gobernador Phase is believed to have been directly instigated as a result of Navajo contact with Pueblo refugees from the Rio Grande Valley during this period. The influence of the contemporary Pueblo art is evident, and in the Largo in particular, Rio Grande Style impact is strong enough to suggest that particular figures, or groups of figures were made by actual Pueblo immigrants into the area. Navajo borrowing of Puebloan art styles and figures at this time is related to the fact that Pueblo religion and all its ramifications was heavily influencing the Navajo (Schaafsma 1975:31). Regardless of the origin of the Shield Bearing Warrior, that the Navajo era rock art of Dindtah was religious in nature and related to ceremonial practice is generally accepted. The images carved and painted on the rock are of supernatural deities and do not represent actual persons or events, leading Schaafsma (1980:305) to term the artistic approach as the Gobernador Representational Style. As Keyser (1987:45) has noted for such art among the Plains tribes, "[t]he ceremonial art style is rigid and static, with individual glyphs portrayed for their intrinsic importance, and small groups of glyphs drawn in very structured relationships. The postures of humans and ani- mals and the structured associations between figures indicate a highly symbolic art whose meaning was primarily individualistic and probably ceremonial in nature." So it is with the Shield Bearing Warriors of the Navajo era in Dindtah. Most investigators assume that the shield bearer was some sort of war symbol, but what meaning the icon held is not known. Present-day Navajos who view the rock art believe that the Shield Bearing Warrior was involved in some sort of pro- tection rite, but state that such rituals have now been forgotten. Only the shields themselves, now valuable artifacts, can give us clues. The Pectol shields are three bison hide artifacts that were discovered in a dry cave in southern Utah by Ephraim Pectol in 1925. Subjects of examination and speculation since their discovery, the most thorough report has recently been published by Loendorf and Conner (1993). Presently in the possession of the National Park Service, these artifacts are now being evaluated for repatriation under the guide- lines of NAGPRA. As a part of that investigation, Robbins (2001) recorded the following:</page><page sequence="18">264 ROGERS According to representatives of the Navajo Nation, the Naayee [sic] (Protection Way) ceremony deals with the armor and shields of Navajo deities and Navajo people. People who have possession of such shields must be knowledgeable in the proper songs, prayers, and oral history of the Naayee ceremony. Jon Holiday, a recognized Naayee chanter, has identified the designs and colors on the three shields as representing earth, sky, day and night, stars, and the male and female mountains, as described in Navajo oral history. Mr. Holiday has indicated that he intends to use the three shields in the Naayee ceremony. The Naayee ceremony provides individuals with a protective barrier behind which they may regain strength, harmony, and balance after a physical or mental illness (Robbins 2001:63556). While the present physical possession of a shield is perhaps symbolically different from the creation of a Shield Bearing Warrior image in the past, these clues give evidence that the shield bearer was involved in some sort of protection rite relating to raid and warfare. The Navajo word for shield is naagddh, meaning "behind the back," and indicates protection from all sides rather than the way the object would be used in actual combat (anonymous informant, personal communication 2002). The Shield Bearing Warrior has now disappeared from the lexicon of Navajo sacred art. No known examples of the image appear in published reproductions of dry paintings and the staff of the Department of Dine Studies, Dine College, Tsaile, Arizona confirm that it is not known to them in present-day ceremonialism. Why such an important symbol, present in the American West for almost a millennium, should now be absent from Navajo ritual is perhaps a matter of conjecture. The ceremonies practiced by the ancestral Navajos, or Dindsazi, of Din6tah are not known, but an examination of the rock art gives valuable clues. Navajo ceremonial practice has been of great interest to anthropologists and ethnologists for more than 100 years and a great deal of information has been recorded. Observation of dry paintings and the masked dancers of the Nightway ceremonies as currently practiced can be used to identify many of the images found in the rock art of Din6tah. These are images of the Holy Ways, or healing ways, used to correct physical and mental problems and to restore balance and harmony for an individual. Din6tah hunting ritual is also suggested by many of the images portraying anthropomorphs and zoomorphs (Rogers 2001). The War Ways are perhaps repre- sented by the Shield Bearing Warrior. At the end of the Gobernador phase and at the time of the exodus from Din6tah, there was an apparent shift in ceremonial practice and Blessingway, now the modem core ritual of Navajo ceremony, came into ascendancy. Brugge (1963:22) believed that this was "a nativistic re-assertion of the Athabascan way of life with mecha- nisms for the integration of foreign elements that were compatible with it." H6zh66ji is the Navajo word for Blessingway and so the H6zh66ji Shift is a term that can now be used for this transformation and alteration in ceremonial practice. The H6zh66ji Shift is important for archaeologists as well as ethnologists because Blessingway prohibits, among other things, the erection of dwellings with square comrners, the manufacture of painted pottery, and the creation of permanent imagery of Navajo Holy People. Construction of pueblitos rapidly declined, Gobernador</page><page sequence="19">The Shield Bearing Warrior in Navajo Era Rock Art 265 Polychrome pottery disappeared, and the depictions of presently recognizable Navajo deities in rock art were no longer produced. Some religious elements are found in the rock art of Chaco Canyon, Canyon de Chelly, and Talking Rocks, but these are no longer of the Gobernador Representational Style. They instead seem to fall under what Brugge (1999) has described as the Navajo Realistic Style and more closely resemble the Plains Biographical Style as found in Plains rock art, robe paintings, etc. Hunting scenes and possible indications of hunting ritual are, however, found at Chaco Canyon, Canyon de Chelly, and Talking Rocks, and Shield Bearing Warriors have been noted at the latter two places. This would suggest that hunting and war ceremonials were not under control of Blessingway and therefore not affected by the H6zh66ji Shift. This separation of Holy Ways, Hunting Ways, and War Ways may also be referred to in the historical record. The Spaniards, Mexicans, and Americans who dealt with the Navajos to conclude treaties and other affairs noted that there were "peace chiefs" and "war chiefs." To their frustration, all of these groups found that there were no "chiefs" among the Navajo but instead naat'dnii or "those who are known to speak well." Some of these men with the ability to "speak well" were possibly ceremonial practitioners, a trade that requires the memorization of hundreds of songs and prayers that must be repeated without error and in sequence over the time of a ceremony that may last many nights. That there was a separation of "peace chiefs" and "war chiefs" suggests that war ritual was practiced well into the nineteenth century. We know very little about the war ceremonies. Hill (1936) was able to collect some information from elderly Navajos and noted that there were different rituals for the raid, conducted by a few men for the purpose of gaining loot, and reprisal, which involved a large number of warriors bent for revenge for some act or per- ceived slight by members of another tribe. These rites were conducted to ensure safety of the Navajos while in hostile territory and to sedate or actually kill the intended enemy in advance of an attack. Because of their powers, these war ceremonial practitioners were generally feared. It is unfortunate that we know nothing in detail of the ritual or imagery of the war ceremonies. That the Shield Bearing Warrior rock art icon is a part of these rites can only be assumed. If it is, then it could have persisted into the nineteenth century. Raid and warfare increased during the Mexican and American adminis- trations of New Mexico, and it would appear from historical accounts that the ceremonial system controlling these activities was sometimes disregarded. The "chiefs," or headmen, complained to authorities that they could no longer control their young men. Hostile activities were so numerous that the Navajo were considered to be the biggest problem for the American government, eventually resulting in the removal of the tribe from their homelands to Fort Sumner. The Navajo incarceration at Fort Sumner, 1864-1868, was not only physically but also psychologically devastating to the Din6. After their return, anything associated</page><page sequence="20">266 ROGERS with warfare or witchcraft was censured and reports circulated widely of "medicine men" who could shoot poisoned objects into the bodies of intended victims or otherwise cause illness and death by ritual means. The witch purge of 1878 led to the death of several of these people, killed by other Navajos, and to the repression of the practice by the American army (Brugge 1977). The days of ritual war preparation were over and the Shield Bearing Warrior was relegated to archaeological artifact. Acknowledgments. This study could not have been done without the help of the many Navajo men and women who have traveled the country with me and freely shared their traditional lore. They shall remain anonymous as too much knowledge about "war things" might indicate to other Navajos that they themselves are practitioners of the "dark ways," rumors of which still abound. Harry Walters and Don Dinetdeal, of the Department of Dine Studies, Dine College, Tsaile, Arizona, have also visited many of the sites with me and made the facilities of their institution freely available. Jim Copeland and Peggy Gaudy, archaeologists with the Farmington District, Bureau of Land Management, have assisted in locating and recording the many rock art sites of Dinetah. David M. Brugge read an early draft of the manuscript and encouraged me to continue. Ronald Towner and Dennis Gilpin reviewed the manuscript before final publication and made invaluable suggestions. Dale Anderson and Daniel Hise of Aztec Media assisted in production of the figures. To all of these people a sincere ahdhee, and thank you. REFERENCES Aikens, C.
