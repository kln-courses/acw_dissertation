<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SCIENCE TEACHER LOOKS AT THE NURSERY SCHOOL CHILD EGGERT MEYER ,;F«W. PARKER SCHOOL ROOSEVELT COLLEGE Our children are born into a complex society, in which a realistic orientation is difficult to achieve. As embryonic citizens of a democracy in the atomic age, it seems imperative that they acquire tools for such orientation in order to be prepared to cope with the contradictions, confusions and inse- curities which are inherent in our times. Now it is more than ever necessary that our children be encouraged to question, to criticize, to find out for themselves and to evaluate independ- ently. The teacher and parents of the nursery school child, can lay the groundwork for such habits of thinking and doing, in ways which are appropriate to the child's level of learning. Tommy ran to his teacher with a dark rock-like object in his hand. "Loòk what I found. What is it?" "I am not sure," she answered." "What do you think it is?" "It's coal," he asserted. "Maybe - but we can find out if it is. Coal will burn you know." s "OK." Tommy was eager. "Let 's burn it." "Yes, we can try to burn it. Let's put it in the fireplace and see." The processes of learning by doing and of-f inding-out- for-oneself require scientific attitudes and scientific methods. -18-</page><page sequence="2">Among the former are reliance upon facts and the ability to think in cause -and-ef feet relations. Among the latter are' the conduction of simple experiments and the observation of processes. The children were playing on the ice. Janie had fallen several times. "Why do we have to have ice on our playground? she complained. "Do you remember how it snowed yester- day? her teacher asked. "Then the snow melted, and during the night it got freezing cold. What is the ice made of?" "Water", said Michael promptly. "Let's take the chunk of ice indoors and find out what happens". After the children had seen the ice melt their teacher said, "Yes, Michael water turns into ice when it gets cold and freezes. It turns into something else when it gets hot and bcils. Let's Eut oil this it. water We can into see our what tea happens kettle to and oil it. We can see what happens to it then. In contrast with practices in autocratic societies, in which children are taught to accept without question the explanations and interpretations of quasi-authorities - their teachers, the young citizen in a democracy should be characterized, in part, by his challenge of authority; by his ever-questioning "How do you know?" "How can I find out if it is so?" This character- istic involves -an attitude which has specific implications for the nursery school teacher. " She daily is confronted with the simple what, why, and how of the world which come directly under the children's feet, in reach of their fingers, in sight of their eyes, in sound of their -19-</page><page sequence="3">ears and in the things they smell and taste. It is so easy to satisfy their curiosities by supplying ready-made answers, thus planting early in their minds, the idea that the teacher wears the mantle of infallibility. Aside from the fact that no teacher can possibly be an authority in all fields, many opportunities, meanwhile, have been missed to encourage child- intiated investigations and to foster the questioning experimental attitude. In order to further these ends, the nursery school must provide an 'environment which includes living and growing things. The nursery school will have cages for pets such as mioe or hamsters and if space permits, for larger mammals, such as rabbits, guinea pigs or rats. The animals will live in pairs so the pupils can experience the life cycle. There will be flower boxes in which to grow potatoes, birdsee, orange and lemon seeds. and anything which the children bring to plant. Andy had a prune pit wrapped in a piece of wax paper. "I had prunes for breakfast," he said. "I brought a seed to plant in our box." "Your prune was cooked, Andy. Maybe it won't grow. But you may plant it and see for yourself." The school environment also will include articles and instruments indi- genous to the child's daily life. Articles such as a churn to make butter, an ice cream freezer, a large-handled magnifier and similar tools bring children in contact with many realities which are meaningful to them. The promotion of scientific attitudes makes it mandatory that books which are used impart authentic information and be void of the "laterna magica" approach. Stories of the "sly fox," the "kindly sun," the "good Mother Nature," are anthropomorphic and mislead the young child rather than help him. It is through habituation in the field of scientific attitudes and methods, On the developmental level of the child, that we may hope to develop the citizen' who prefers to-f ind-out-f or -himself . We may hope to educate him to discern between real and false authorities and to be impervious to propaganda because he has learned to view the world around him with his eyes wide open. ***** -20-</page></plain_text>
