Emerson“,Experience”, Essays II, 1844 Spokesman for the New Age Leaving for Europe in late 1832, having resigned his pulpit and still in grief  over the loss of his wife Ellen, Emerson sought to renew his severely tested  faith and optimism. He began his recovery in an unexpected place, the Jardin  des Plantes in Paris, where Antoine Laurent de Jussieu’s Cabinet of Natural  History presented an array of plants arranged by botanical classification.  To Emerson’s hungry eye, this display suggested interconnection,  transformation, and all-encompassing unity, the verities that his recent  crisis had brought into question. He saw vitality in this collection of living  plants, the constantly transmuting yet interwoven processes of the natural  world, a unified cosmos defined by its perpetual energy and unending  metamorphosis. “I feel the centipede in me — cayman, carp, eagle, &amp;  fox”, he wrote in his journal. “I am moved by strange sympathies, I say  continually ‘I will be a naturalist’.”1 Before returning to America, he began  1 T he Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks of Ralph Waldo Emerson, 16 vols., eds.

With increasing clarity Emerson became aware that the tangible natural  world could be the most accessible entry into an intangible realm of the  spirit. For him, there could be no division between a scientific perspective  and a religious one. Scientific advances strengthened his belief in a unified  cosmos, the manifestation of a single force or energy. “Every natural fact is  a symbol of some spiritual fact”, he declared. To study the processes and  development of nature was also to penetrate the transcendent laws that  governed the spiritual and moral realms.3  2  For discussions of Emerson’s visit to the Jardin des Plantes and its impact, see David M.

The full range of human  awareness — observation, reason, aesthetic sensitivity, and emotion — was  necessary to comprehend the bond between nature and the human. At  the outset, Emerson recounted a dramatically revelatory moment “in the  woods” in which he felt “uplifted into infinite space”, and freed of “all  mean egotism”. His vision was transformed, and the natural and spiritual  worlds opened to him: “I become a transparent eye-ball. I am nothing. I  see all. The currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part  or particle of God”.4 In other passages, he seemed to become part of the  natural world itself, speaking of “an occult relation between man and the  vegetable”, and proclaiming, “I expand and live in the warm day like corn  and melons”.5 These were moments of unburdened freedom from material  reality, but they were paradoxically triggered by a deep sensual immersion  within it. Emerson’s exuberant responsiveness to nature traversed the  barriers between world and soul, each of which was encompassed in “the  immutable laws of moral Nature”.6  Such exuberance can be infectious, but it can also evoke wry amusement.  Christopher Pearse Cranch, one of Emerson’s most ardent devotees, seized  on Emerson’s weirdly striking images of the transparent eyeball and the  occult vegetables for several gently satiric caricatures which circulated  among friends in his day, but went unpublished until 1951.7 For helpful interpretive discussions of Nature, see Sherman Paul, Emerson’s Angle of  Vision: Man and Nature in American Experience (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University  Press, 1952); Barbara Packer, Emerson’s Fall: A New Interpretation of the Major Essays  (New York: Continuum, 1992); David M.

P. Cranch, caricature of Emerson’s transparent eyeball, c. 1838–1839. However odd they may have seemed, Emerson’s evocations of his  encounters with natural events suggested that thoughtful interactions  with nature would awaken a fulfilling and purposeful life. But to activate  this potential, one must renounce settled doctrines and conventions. “Let  us demand our own works and laws and worship”, he declared.8 His  sustaining faith was that every individual had access to a greater spirituality  through contemplation, self-examination, and attention to the suggestions  of the natural surroundings. “Who looks upon a river in a meditative hour  and is not reminded of the flux of all things?” he asked. “Throw a stone  8 C W 1: 7. </page> <page sequence="7"> 2.1 The “New Thinking”: Nature, Self, and Society, 1836-1850  85 into the stream, and the circles that propagate themselves are the beautiful  type of all influence. Man is conscious of a universal soul within or behind  his individual life, wherein, as in a firmament, the natures of Justice, Truth,  Love, Freedom, arise and shine”.9  Nature began as a hymn to the beauty of the woods and streams, but  Emerson steered his argument toward the transformative beauty of nature,  the capacity of creation to evoke a new energy within the human psyche.  “All things are moral; and in their boundless changes have an unceasing  reference to spiritual nature”, he asserted in the chapter “Discipline”, a  pivotal chapter in his argument. Drawing on the eighteenth-century  concepts of the moral sense, and a longer tradition of Platonic idealism,  he depicted a cosmos whose deepest self-expression was concordant,  harmonious action. “Every natural process is but a version of a moral  sentence. The moral law lies at the centre of nature and radiates to the  circumference. It is the pith and marrow of every substance, every relation,  and every process”.10 Plato, and his many later followers, maintained that  a deeper source of ideas gave the apparent world its material form. Plato  was, as Robert D. Richardson explained, “the single most important source  of Emerson’s lifelong conviction that ideas are real because they are the  forms and laws that underlie, precede, and explain appearances”. Early  discussions with his Aunt Mary Moody Emerson piqued his interest in  Platonic idealism, and he was introduced to later versions of neo-idealism  by his reading of the seventeenth-century English “Cambridge Platonists”,  Ralph Cudworth and Henry More.11 His preferred contemporary writers,  9 C W 1: 18. 10 C W 1: 26. British ethical philosophers Lord Shaftesbury (1671–1713), Francis Hutcheson  (1694–1746), and David Hume (1711–1776) principally developed the concept of the  moral sense, an innate human capacity for moral discrimination and benevolent action.  Hutcheson’s work, in particular, directly influenced one of Emerson’s key mentors,  William Ellery Channing, minister of the Federal Street Unitarian Church in Boston.  Closely connected to it was the concept of “self-culture”, an important doctrine of  Channing and other Unitarian thinkers of the generation preceding Emerson.

Emerson withdrew Henry More’s Divine  Dialogues (1668) from the Boston Athenaeum on November 19, 1830. He acquired Ralph  Cudworth’s The True Intellectual System of the Universe (1678) on April 23, 1835. See Albert  J. von Frank, An Emerson Chronology (New York: G. K. Hall, 1994), 54, 101. For further  information on the Cambridge Platonists and their impact on American Unitarianism  </page> <page sequence="8"> 86 Mr. Emerson’s Revolution the British Romantics William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and  Thomas Carlyle, had also reformulated a version of Platonism, seeing it  as a liberating alternative to the dry empiricism of John Locke and the  skepticism of David Hume.12 Emerson regarded the Romantics’ resurrection  of a modern form of idealism as a revolutionary turn in modern thinking,  and as Barbara Packer noted, their powerful message, especially that of  Carlyle, was a call to action. “If Carlyle preached a new gospel, how were  his American disciples to put it into practice?”13  For Emerson, idealism breathed new life into the physical world,  transforming it from lifeless matter into energy, and giving it vast religious  dimensions. “Idealism saith: matter is a phenomenon, not a substance”,  he wrote in Nature, reaffirming his Parisian insight that creation was not  static and unmovable but changing and malleable, a cycle of energies and  interactions.14 This leap from “substance” to “phenomenon” was crucial  to Emerson because it resolved the dualism of body and spirit through  the unifying agency of the event. To recognize that both matter and soul  were continually revealed in the processes of nature was also to see those  processes as expressions of a vital, evolving unity. “A spiritual life has  been imparted to nature” and “the solid seeming block of matter has been  pervaded and dissolved by a thought”, he wrote.15 He redefined religion as  the enactment — the making real — of idealism, “the practice of ideas, or the  introduction of ideas into life”.16 This is the reason that Emerson concluded  Nature with a call to action. Proclaiming Nature’s ultimate message through  the voice of an “Orphic Poet”, Emerson emphasizes “building” rather than  “seeing” or “understanding” as the conclusive wisdom. “Build, therefore,  and Transcendentalism, see Daniel Walker Howe, “The Cambridge Platonists of Old  England and the Cambridge Platonists of New England”, in American Unitarianism,  1805–1861, ed.

In October 1834 he relocated from Boston to Concord, where he had familial  roots.

The first of four children,  Waldo, was born in Concord in 1836, the month after Nature was published.  As Bliss Perry explained in his still indispensable portrait of Emerson’s  domestic life, his neighbors “welcomed him as a true son of Concord into  the ordinary life of the village. They put him on the School Committee. He  taught in the Sunday School. He joined the Fire Company, and the Social  Circle”.18 His home thus became not only a retreat for study and writing  but a literary headquarters for the emerging American Transcendentalists.  His door was open to frequent visitors, and through a combination of his  Concord hospitality and his frequent forays into Boston, he built a network  of like-minded friends. He played an important role in the gatherings of  the “Transcendental Club”, a group of rebellious Unitarian ministers who  supported each other in dissent from what they regarded as the exhausted  structures of their church. The club met thirty times in Boston, Concord,  and other nearby places between 1836 and 1840, and became a rallying  point for the Transcendental new views.19 Even though he had resigned his  Boston pulpit in 1832 before traveling to Europe, he resumed week-to-week  supply preaching at a nearby church in East Lexington. This job required  no ministerial duties except the one he preferred — preaching — and he  had carefully preserved his stock of manuscript sermons (now held in  the Houghton Library at Harvard). Throughout this busy Concord life  Emerson continued to be remarkably productive and creative in his work  as a “scholar”.20 He was a vigorous writer with a steely discipline, who  conducted extensive correspondence and generated a continual flow of  lectures, essays, and poems. Most crucially, he maintained a voluminous  18  Bliss Perry, Emerson Today (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1931), 47.

The  origin of the name Transcendentalism seems to be obscure, but was most likely used  first as a pejorative description. Emerson offered an explanation of the movement in  his 1841 essay “The Transcendentalist” (CW 1: 201–16).

He was able to accomplish  all this, Bliss Perry explains, through “the long, inviolable mornings in  his study”, which began early and were sustained by “two cups of coffee  and — it must be owned — a piece of pie”.21  Foremost among his projects in the middle and late 1830s were annual  winter lectures in Boston, performances that developed a local following  and eventually enabled Emerson to expand his travels into other areas  in the Northeast and the growing Midwest. His Boston lectures were a  testing ground for his newest thinking, and served as the basis for the essay  collections, published in the early 1840s, that became the cornerstone of his  literary career. Two controversial public addresses at Harvard accelerated  his rise as a public figure; these remain among his best known and most  enduring cultural legacies. The first was a provocative address to the 1837  meeting of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, traditionally a celebration of “The  American Scholar”. 2.6 “American Scholar Address”, 1837. 21  Perry, 54. </page> <page sequence="14"> 92 Mr. Emerson’s Revolution Emerson used the title as a vantage for critique rather than celebration,  charging that “the spirit of the American freeman is already suspected  to be timid, imitative, tame. Public and private avarice make the air we  breathe thick and fat. The scholar is decent, indolent, complaisant”.22  Applying the primary message of Nature to the literary and creative life,  he urged original independence rather than passive compliance. While  books were presumably the scholar’s chief concern, Emerson called them  dangerous when they stood in the way of independent thinking. “Meek  young men grow up in libraries, believing it their duty to accept the views  which Cicero, which Locke, which Bacon, have given; forgetful that Cicero,  Locke and Bacon were only young men in libraries when they wrote these  books”. Each new generation, he argued “must write its own books”,  using the past for inspiration, but testing all received values against the  conditions of the present.23 “Books are for the scholars’ idle times”, he  declared, cautioning against imitative, passive, or merely receptive reading  that leads not to “Man Thinking” but instead to “the bookworm”.24 He  urged the scholar — he might have said the “author”, “the artist”, or “the  builder”, or anyone of a creative and critical mind — to return to the  primordial energy of nature to become original and authentic. “The one  thing in the world of value, is, the active soul”.25  As we view it now, this appears to be the moment when Emerson  emerged into public prominence. Controversial to some of his listeners  because of its hard-edged critique of American intellectual culture, “The  American Scholar” was nevertheless memorable. As time passed”,  Richardson observed, “the talk became famous, even legendary”.26 He cites  Oliver Wendell Holmes’s enduring claim that “The American Scholar” was  “our intellectual Declaration of Independence”,27 a characterization that  addressed America’s deep-rooted sense of literary and artistic inferiority  in the face of Europe.

In the spring of 1838 the graduating students from Harvard Divinity School,  the stronghold of New England Unitarianism, invited Emerson to speak at  their commencement the next July. These beginning ministers numbered  only seven, but the ceremony in the chapel at Divinity Hall was filled with  close to a hundred alumni, faculty members, local pastors, friends, and family.  Several key figures in the Unitarian establishment were there, including the  erudite Biblical scholar Andrews Norton; Divinity School Dean John Gorham  Palfrey, later prominent as an antislavery politician and historian; and Henry  Ware Jr., a Harvard faculty member who had been Emerson’s predecessor and  mentor in the pulpit at Boston’s Second Church.29 In “The American Scholar”,  Emerson had applied the principles of originality and direct experience to  literature, scholarship, and action. In what became known as his “Divinity  School Address”, he measured religion and contemporary worship by this  same standard. He argued that the religious spirit itself was being stifled by  the routine performance of empty ceremony and rote creed. Emerson called his listeners back to the “sentiment of virtue”, an  inherent “delight in the presence of certain divine laws”. To assure  them that he was not opening a conventional theological exposition,  he explained that “these laws refuse to be adequately stated”, but are  instead revealed through direct experience, what we encounter daily  “in each other’s faces, in each other’s actions, in our own remorse”.30  Such experience was, he believed, innate, the sign within us of the same  ceaseless energy that coursed through nature. “This sentiment”, he  explained, “lies at the foundation of society, and successively creates  all forms of worship. The principle of veneration never dies out”.31 28 C W 1: 52. 29  On the background and setting of the Divinity School Address, see Conrad Wright,  “Emerson, Barzillai Frost, and the Divinity School Address”, in his The Liberal Christians:  Essays on American Unitarian History (Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, 1970); and Wright,  ‘“Soul is Good, but Body is Good Too’,” Journal of Unitarian and Universalist History 37  (2013–2014): 1–20. 30  CW 1: 77. 31  CW 1: 79. </page> <page sequence="16"> 94 Mr. Emerson’s Revolution 2.7 “Divinity School Address”, 1838. Emerson wanted to return the church and its ministers to the direct,  experiential roots of religion and thereby free them from the hollow forms  of belief and worship that were now too common. He audaciously rejected  the significance of Biblical miracles, and explained Jesus’s claim to be the  son of God as an arresting metaphor for his sense of a divinity within every  man and woman. Jesus demonstrated an inner spiritual power that was not  unique, but potentially universal. “Alone in all history, [Jesus] estimated  the greatness of man”, Emerson maintained.32 While he showed a reverence  for Jesus, he by no means granted him a divine or supernatural character,  as it was broadly understood in the 1830s.  Making himself more explicit, and more shocking, Emerson also  denied the personhood of God in his description of the shortcomings of  his religious tradition. “Historical Christianity has fallen into the error  that corrupts all attempts to communicate religion. As it appears to us,  and as it has appeared for ages, it is not the doctrine of the soul, but an  exaggeration of the personal, the positive, the ritual. It has dwelt, it dwells,  32  CW 1: 81. </page> <page sequence="17"> 2.1 The “New Thinking”: Nature, Self, and Society, 1836-1850  95 with noxious exaggeration about the person of Jesus. The soul knows  no persons”.33 Uneasy with the theological use of anthropomorphic  terms such as “Father”, Emerson saw the personification of God as  a false projection of limited human qualities onto an unfathomable  power. His rejection of the personhood of God was one of his most  disquieting ideas, inviting the strong criticism of his former ministerial  mentor, Henry Ware. Ware insisted that an impersonal God lacked  religious value. But Emerson held that to personalize God was to limit  one’s access to deeper sources of religious energy. Emerson sometimes  used the word “God”, in his journal and in his published work, but he  constantly searched for other ways to express this originating energy:  “Soul”, “Over-Soul”, “World Soul”, “Spirit”, “One”, “Moral Sense”, and  “Moral Law”. Emerson’s conception of a continually developing deity  corresponded with his belief in the potential for a continually growing  spiritual awareness of the individual, and provided the basis for a  revitalized spirituality, stripped of religious mythology and churchly  traditions.34  Emerson himself was a product of the tradition that he was so frankly  condemning. He revered the eloquent preaching of William Ellery  Channing, whose landmark sermon of 1819, “Unitarian Christianity”, had  separated Unitarians from the Calvinist-grounded Congregationalism  that had been New England’s dominant theology for two centuries.  The Unitarians dismissed the concept of original sin and affirmed  the spiritual resources of every individual. They advocated a life of  disciplined self-examination and continuing spiritual development. But  Emerson’s skepticism about Biblical miracles and Jesus as a supernatural  figure touched sensitive points of Christian belief that were still dear to  most Unitarians. He asked this graduating class — and by extension  their professors and everyone gathered — not to accept these cherished  precepts without intense scrutiny. Only through their witness to a  direct experience of the holy might they preach with influence to their  churches, and “convert life into truth”.35 33  CW 1: 82. 34 O n Emerson’s stance of openness and change, his essay “Circles” (CW 2: 177–90) is  of particular importance.

While the “American Scholar” had ruffled some of its listeners, this  attack on both Christian doctrine and church practice provoked a  storm of controversy. A week after the address was published, a Boston  newspaper brought out a stinging attack against it by Harvard’s leading  Biblical scholar, Andrews Norton, who himself had been a leader in the  Unitarian break with Calvinism. A year later, at a meeting of Divinity  School alumni, Norton expanded his attack on Emerson’s Address with  a fiery rebuttal, “A Discourse on the Latest Form of Infidelity”.36 Norton  36 F or Norton’s initial response, see Andrews Norton, “The New School in Literature and  Religion”, Boston Daily Advertiser (August 27, 1838), 2, http://bit.ly/1E9IslN; reprinted  in Joel Myerson, ed., Transcendentalism: A Reader (New York: Oxford University Press,  2000), 246–50.

Cranch,  ever loyal to Emerson, lost no time caricaturing Norton in an outrage and  circulated the cartoon among his transcendentalist friends. Although  ruffled, Emerson refused to engage his critics directly in public debate,  rejecting a pamphlet war that would drain his energies for the campaign  that he wanted to continue.37  Emerson believed that these conflicts were signs of much more than  a theological schism. They registered a wider divergence of perspective  and values in his culture, and they held the promise of a significant  cultural transformation. “The two omnipresent parties of History, the  party of the Past and the party of the Future, divide society to-day as  of old”, he argued in his series “Lectures on the Times, 1841–1842”. He  could feel the progressive currents of egalitarian change and predicted  that “the present age will be marked by its harvest of projects, for the  reform of domestic, civil, literary, and ecclesiastical institutions”.38 In  this atmosphere of contending parties, Emerson and his allies recognized  that stronger efforts to spread their views were needed, and that one of  their most pressing needs was a journal of Transcendentalist opinion  and artistic expression. In July 1840, Emerson, Margaret Fuller, George  Ripley, and others launched a new quarterly, The Dial. In its first issue, Emerson provided a rationale for the journal as a  voice in “the progress of a revolution” in New England, challenging  the adequacy of present forms of literature, religion, and education.  Its sources would be innovative, as Emerson described them in “The  Editors to the Reader”, not the familiar work of established authors, but  rather “the discourse of the living, and the portfolios which friendship  has opened to us”.39 Fuller served as The Dial’s first editor, making her  among the earliest American women to edit a literary journal. 37 F or the reaction to the Divinity School Address, see McAleer, 247–65; Packer, The  Transcendentalists, 121–29; David M.

Access to The Dial was also vital for Fuller, whose work is now recognized  as pioneering on several counts.

Fuller expanded this article into Woman in the Nineteenth  Century (1845), a book that brought her to prominence and became  a founding document for the women’s rights movement in America.  Thoreau’s early essays on nature and Emerson’s defining lecture on “The  Transcendentalist” also first reached print via The Dial.40 Bronson Alcott’s  “Orphic Sayings”, aphoristic prose-poems that seemed impenetrably  abstract to many readers, were among its most controversial pieces.41 One  40 S ee Joel Myerson, The New England Transcendentalists and the Dial: A History of the  Magazine and Its Contributors (Rutherford, NJ: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press,  1980). 41 O n the reception of Alcott’s “Orphic Sayings”, see Joel Myerson, “’In the Transcendental  Emporium’: Bronson Alcott’s ‘Orphic Sayings’ in The Dial”, English Language Notes 10  (1972): 31–38. </page> <page sequence="21"> 2.1 The “New Thinking”: Nature, Self, and Society, 1836-1850  99 of the magazine’s most forward-thinking projects, jointly promoted by  Emerson and Thoreau, was a series of “Ethnical Scriptures”, translations  of ancient Hindu, Buddhist, and Confucian religious texts. This pioneering  effort disseminated knowledge about world religions, encouraging a  modern, comparative view of Christianity, and suggesting its place as one  faith tradition among the world’s religions. Both Emerson and Thoreau  remained keenly interested in Asian beliefs, finding links between their  radical explorations in spirituality and these classic non-Western traditions.  Although The Dial was publishing what we now recognize as historically  important texts, its subscribers never exceeded about 300, and Emerson,  busy with other matters, was finally forced to cease publishing it. But  its four-year run had given his friends important encouragement and a  common purpose in addressing America’s need for a cultural revolution.42  2.10 Emerson’s four volumes of The Dial. Emerson’s ever-enlarging journal and his rich backlog of public lectures  were the foundations for the work that would assure his place in the global  literary canon: Essays I (1841). Characterized by its sharp-edged aphorisms  and epigrammatic turns-of-phrase, this book established Emerson as a  42  Myerson, N. E. Transcendentalists and the Dial, 95, 96.

He spoke directly to a rapidly shifting religious climate in which the  findings of modern Biblical research and emerging science generated  doubt and anxiety, and proposed fresh and revitalizing approaches to  spiritual questions. He urged his readers to higher levels of integrity and  ethical awareness, and offered them desperately needed freedom from  tightly sanctioned limits on their thought and behavior. The best known  of his remedies for doubt and anxiety was an essay that codified his own  early struggle for self-acceptance and social confidence. He entitled it “Self- Reliance”. “Trust thyself; every soul vibrates to that iron string”. “Nothing  is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind”. “What I must do,  is all that concerns me, not what the people think”. “Let us affront and  reprimand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times”.43  These and other lasting affirmations were vivid reminders of the code of  courage and balanced self-possession necessary to resist modern society’s  crushing demands for acquiescence and conformity.  Emerson contended that the self-reliant individual gained strength not  from external social approval but from inner resources — spiritual trust and  recognition of the moral sentiment — that built and sustained character.  Emerson’s belief that the self was grounded in a greater Self discouraged  egotism on the one hand, and social anarchy on the other. But such trust  was hard to achieve and to retain. The distinctive tone of high confidence  and optimism in his writings actually disguised his ongoing inner struggle  with self-doubt and pessimism. “In the dark hours our existence seems to  be a defensive war”, he privately recorded in 1835, “a struggle against the  encroaching All which threatens with certainty to engulf us soon, &amp; seems  impatient of our little reprieve”.44 This voice of insecurity stayed largely  hidden in Emerson’s speeches and published works, where he regularly  put forward a self-assured and resolute persona. But a long history in his  own experience with building courage lay behind “Self-Reliance”, making  his words apply first to himself, then to his readers. “Self Reliance” was one of twelve essays in this first collection, which  included subjects ranging from “History” to “Friendship” to “Art”. Together  they constitute a loosely structured theory of human culture and the ethical life.  While “Self-Reliance” attained cultural significance through its articulation of  43  CW 2: 30, 31, 35.

For Emerson, friendship and self-reliance are not mutually exclusive  qualities. Each virtue depends on the other for its completion. Friendship  must not be taken as a denial of self-reliance, Emerson cautions: “we must be  our own, before we can be another’s”. But true friendship demands careful  cultivation and what he terms “a long probation”, or period of testing and  trial. But its achievement stands as one of the greatest of human fulfillments,  the sign of an aware and ethically purposeful life. Friendship is “the nut itself  whereof all nature and all thought is but the husk and shell”.45 Emerson’s  discourse on friendship, with its careful analysis of interpersonal bonds, is a  crucial indicator of the social trajectory of Emerson’s work in the 1840s and  1850s, which is more directly engaged with the daily conduct of life, its social  contexts, and the imperatives of political reform.   2.11 Emerson house, front hallway looking north. 45  CW 2: 124; 119.

Self-Reliance and the Challenge of Reform By the early 1840s Emerson was becoming more engaged in social criticism,  developing a more relational theory of the self, and responding to the  increasingly rancorous national political climate. Deep personal tragedy  reinforced this shift of perspective. In January 1842, soon after the his  success with the publication of Essays I, his first child Waldo, age five,  developed scarlet fever and, within days, died. “I comprehend nothing of this fact but its bitterness”, he confided in his  journal. “Explanation I have none, consolation none that rises out of the  fact itself; only diversion; only oblivion of this &amp; pursuit of new objects”.46  No stranger to disappointment, injustice, uncertainty, and loss, the death  of the cherished Waldo affected him much more deeply than the earlier  losses of his father, three brothers, and even his beloved first wife Ellen.  Waldo’s sudden absence jarringly refocused his attention on the meaning  of life’s major reversals. The loss accentuated the fragility of life and the  tenuous stability of its moods and perspectives, and encouraged openness  46  JMN 8: 205. </page> <page sequence="25"> 2.1 The “New Thinking”: Nature, Self, and Society, 1836-1850  103 and patience, virtues that clarified the limits of the self. Stunned by the  loss, Emerson’s grief-guided search for a response pointed him toward  determined engagement in this world, and quickened his already discernible  turn toward the pragmatic. Meaningful life and true character demanded  purpose, will, discipline, stoical patience, and active involvement.47 2.13 Waldo Emerson, Jr. (30 October 1836–27 January 1841). Compelling evidence of this change is Emerson’s poem “Threnody”,  an elegy for Waldo written over many months. It registers Emerson’s  tortuous passage from blank despair to a renewed worldly purpose. His  guide out of this morass is the voice of a “deep Heart” that responds to  his personal pain with the assurance that death does not erase abiding  values and affections: “Hearts are dust, hearts’ loves remain; / Heart’s love will  meet thee again”.48 The poem’s companion piece was “Experience”, now  47 O n Emerson’s intellectual evolution, see Stephen E.

A complex meditation that blends  surrealistic imagery with a succession of gripping voices and shifting  moods, the essay records Emerson’s voyage from numbed bewilderment  to a tempered determination to rise “up again” and confront experience.49  Strikingly candid in its portrayal of personal loss, “Experience” also sets  the direction for the later public phase of his work. Beginning half-way  up the stairway of life, Emerson depicts his dazed effort to find his way in  a chaotic and misfortune-filled world. “Experience” poses a labyrinthine  series of dilemmas in which the resolution of one adversity leads inevitably  to another. In contrast with the earlier epiphany in the Jardin des Plantes,  or the ecstasy of the transparent eyeball image of Nature (only eight years  in the past), Emerson now dramatizes the loss of energy, desire, and self- confidence that darkens every purpose. His way forward is less to heal or  redeem the private self than to envision the eventual emergence of a more  communal justice. He calls for patience, resilient courage, and a conviction  that “there is victory yet for all justice”.50 The antidote to misfortune is “the  transformation of genius into practical power”, the resolute application  of one’s intellectual resources and ethical commitments with reasoned,  persistent effort.51 Devastated by tragedy, Emerson turned mourning into a  motivation for dedicated service.  This evolution toward a larger role in public affairs was not an easy  one for Emerson. In 1838, concerned friends and family called on him to  protest President Van Buren’s order forcing the Cherokee nation to leave  Georgia for the West. He wrote a blistering condemnation of the policy  as a moral outrage to American civilization. But privately, he recorded  his unhappiness at entering this debate over public policy, expressing  his inner conflict between his literary calling and his sense of a citizen’s  public duty to advance progressive political causes.52 As his stature as a  public figure grew, so did his recognition of his responsibility to use his  influence productively, especially as the national crisis over slavery and  other abrasive issues intensified in the 1840s and 1850s. The revolutionary  currents of the 1840s in Europe also began to be felt in the United States,  49  CW 3: 49.  50  CW 3: 49.

Reynolds has shown, those ideas had a profound impact on  Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Walt Whitman, and other American writers.53  One important sign of the political turn among the Transcendentalists  was a growing interest in the philosophy of Charles Fourier, a French  utopian social theorist whose work was translated in 1840 by Albert  Brisbane. Fourier’s complex and sometimes bizarre theories focused  on the formation of small communes or “phalanxes” that could create  liberating alternatives to the competitive market economy. Emerson’s  friends George and Sophia Ripley urged him to join them in launching  Brook Farm, one of the best known communal experiments of the era, but  Emerson demurred. “I think that all I shall solidly do, I must do alone”,  he wrote to Ripley, remaining sympathetic but skeptical of communal  alternatives to familial life.54 In one sense he was right — the communes  did not last long. Brook Farm, though a rewarding experience for many  of its members, disbanded after six years in financial failure. Another  close friend, Bronson Alcott, launched Fruitlands, an even more short- lived communal experiment that disbanded when facing its first winter.55  Despite their clear failures as enduring institutions, these efforts were  nevertheless valuable expressions of dissent, as Emerson recognized.  Their formation signaled important opposition to the powerful new  America that was coming into being.  The search for a more harmonious and cooperative form of social  organization reflected a deep concern about the nation’s hypocritical  professions of democracy and its egregious social injustices. In an 1839  journal entry Emerson observed that “the number of reforms preached  to this age exceeds the usual measure”, an indicator, he believed of “the  depth &amp; universality of the movement which betrays itself by such variety  of symptom”. He offers a brief list of these oppositional groups, suggesting  53 L arry J.

One of the pieces that Emerson contributed to The  Dial was an 1841 speech to the Mechanics’ Apprentices’ Library Association  in Boston, entitled “Man the Reformer”. Len Gougeon called attention  to one moment in the speech in which Emerson lauded abolitionism for  showing Americans their “dreadful debt to the Southern negro”.57 The  goods produced by slave labor provided consumers in the North, even  those opposed to slavery, with items of comfort and luxury. “We are all  implicated, of course, in this charge”, Emerson asserts. “It is only necessary  to ask a few questions as to the progress of the articles of commerce from  the fields where they grew, to our houses, to become aware that we eat and  drink and wear perjury and fraud in a hundred commodities”.58  Emerson remained an advocate of the reform movements, including  antislavery, over the next few years, but a somewhat distanced one. He  concluded Essays: Second Series with the 1844 lecture “New England  Reformers”, a text that Richardson describes as “calm and qualifying”, and  containing little mention of the antislavery movement.59 A brief sentence  near the end of that lecture, however, provides an important clue to his  attitude about his public role as a spokesman for reform: “Obedience to his  genius is the only liberating influence”.60 Emerson was reluctant to leave  the path he had set for himself as a “scholar” of philosophy and literature.  56  JMN 7: 207.

Well  after he had entered the antislavery effort unreservedly, he would express  his misgivings in these arresting words: “I do not often speak to public  questions; — they are odious and hurtful, and it seems like meddling or  leaving your work. I have my own spirits in prison; — spirits in deeper  prisons, whom no man visits if I do not”.61 But as the national political crisis  over legal slavery simmered, he realized that the epitome of social injustice  was the slave, the man or woman robbed legally of self-possession and  the right to act and choose freely. The slaveholder had no right to oppress  another individual who was by right his equal. The slave came to represent  for him the greatest moral contradiction of modern civilization.62  A pivotal moment for Emerson came in the summer of 1844 when he  was invited by the Concord Female Anti-Slavery Society to speak on the  tenth anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the British West Indies.  Urged onward at home by his wife Lidian, and by other women friends,  he began to research the history of the slave trade as well as the British  parliamentary debates and legislation leading to the abolition of slavery  in the Caribbean. This assiduous homework resulted in one of his most  stirring addresses in which he described the horrors of slavery in detail and  made a powerful case, emotionally and intellectually, that slavery was a  moral violation.63 Emerson’s reading had given him a wider understanding  of the slave trade and of the physical conditions of slavery in the Caribbean,  and had moved him to portray slavery, in vivid terms, as a viscerally moral  61  EAW 73. 62 F or a discussion of Emerson’s changing views of race, see Philip L.

International Fame and National Crisis Increasingly in demand as a lecturer, Emerson traveled extensively on  the expanding lyceum circuit, an important source of his income from the  1840s onward.65 His itineraries first focused on New England, expanding to the greater  Northeast and the Middle Atlantic States, and then after 1850 following  the nation’s westward expansion to include frontier cities and towns.  Conditions for travel were often arduous, and though some audiences were  thirsty for culture, others were less than receptive. But Emerson persisted,  combining a need for new audiences and continuing income with a desire  to bring the life of serious thinking to all who would listen. Emerson clearly  wanted to know his country, as his unremitting travels show. But he was  a frank and incisive observer, and was often disappointed in what he saw.  “Great country, diminutive minds”, he noted with disgust in a June 1847  journal entry on “eager, solicitous, hungry, rabid, busy-body America”. His  lament for American culture centered on its scattered attention and aimless  energy. “Alas for America as I must often say, the ungirt, the diffuse, the  profuse, procumbent, one wide ground juniper, out of which no cedar, no  oak will rear up a mast to the clouds! it all runs to leaves, to suckers, to  tendrils, to miscellany. The air is loaded with poppy, with imbecility, with  dispersion, &amp; sloth”.66 A little over three months later he was on his way to  a lecture tour in Great Britain, where his writings had gained a substantial  following.  64  EAW 10.

The ten-month  journey to Britain was an eventful and transformative one for Emerson. As  Richardson so expressively put it, “England jolted Emerson. Everything  seemed different, bigger, faster, heavier ... All was bustle and activity in  England”.67 Lecturing in Liverpool, Manchester, and cities in the Midlands,  he got a close look at England in the midst of its Industrial Revolution, and  spoke to a varied audience that included workingmen’s groups. He had  Thomas Carlyle’s assistance in London, and met literary celebrities such  as Tennyson, George Eliot, and Dickens. Yet the England that Emerson  visited was also an anxious nation, concerned about its own stability as  it witnessed continental Europe erupt in political revolution in 1848. In a  three-week interlude during the spring of 1848, he traveled to Paris where  he witnessed the barricaded city in open revolution. He corresponded  with Margaret Fuller, then in Italy, who had become an ardent proponent  of the Italian Risorgimento led by Giuseppe Mazzini.68 This tense political  atmosphere kept him in constant thought about the divided, rancorous  America to which he would return. In this sense, Emerson was a tourist  with a double vision; he wanted to see and understand the new Britain that  was rising as the world’s greatest commercial and industrial power, and  he also wanted the perspective that this other nation could give him on  America. These questions were at the heart of his 1856 volume, English Traits,  a work that combined descriptive aspects of the travel narrative with social  analysis directed ultimately at the prospects of American advancement. The future of America, he recognized, would be determined by how  it responded to the slavery crisis, a question deeply rooted in the issue of  race. Emerson’s initial reaction to England’s remarkable industrial growth  and commercial power was to attribute it to the power of the Saxon “race”.  The category of race was a large one in the 1840s, much under scientific  discussion, and it was a form of classification that included a variety of  peoples, as Philip F. Nicoloff has written.69 Drawn to racial explanations  of British power initially, Emerson was forced to look into theories of  race more deeply, and ultimately rejected one of the central ideas of the  67  Richardson, 441. 68 O n Emerson’s lecture tour in England, see von Frank, An Emerson Chronology, 218–37;  McAleer, Emerson, 428–77; and Richardson, 441–56.

In appealing to the vastness of  historical time, Emerson dissolved the “frail boundaries” of racial division,  and clarified the grounds of human equality upon which the essential  moral objection to slavery rested.70  2.16 Emerson’s study, 1972. Emerson’s English tour had another powerful impact on him. He saw not  only the growing industrial economy of England, but also the history- making achievements of its scientists. The most crucial evidence of this  impact can be found in the set of new lectures that he wrote and delivered  in London in the early summer of 1848, “Mind and Manners of the  Nineteenth Century”. Addresses he heard by the prominent paleontologist  70  CW 5: 27.

Freshly appreciative of America as a young nation with hopeful ideas,  he was also reminded of his nation’s faults and areas of blindness. The  political crisis accelerated on the 7th of March, 1850, when New England’s  most respected political figure, Daniel Webster, delivered the speech  that enabled passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, an integral part of the  Compromise of 1850.
