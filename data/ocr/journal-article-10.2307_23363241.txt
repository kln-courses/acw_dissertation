<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WORLD OF ANGELS IN HUMAN FORM by M. Idel This paper examines the earliest source in which the world of angels is presented as an anthropomorphic structure. In this direction the author interprets the significance of "Aletheia," a female angelic figure described by the Gnostic Markos. Markos believed the Greek alphabet to be inscribed on the body of Aletheia, and the peculiar arrangement of the letters in his treatment fits ancient Jewish traditions concerning mysterious names. Furthermore, several medieval texts related to the Shi'ur Qomah are adduced, wherein the unintelligible names appearing in that work are perceived as names of angels appointed to the various divine limbs. This view of Shi'ur Qomah and the angelic world passed, according to the author, into early Kabbalah: the Sefer ha-Bahir and the circle of the Sefer ha-Iyyun. In the last third of the thirteenth century, the fragmentary evidence discussed above gives way to a clear picture of the world of angels as comprising a human form of either seventy or two hundred and forty eight components. Such ideas were accepted by classic kabbalistic sources, like the later compositions appurtenant to the Zohar literature, and were largely disseminated in later kabbalistic books. The last major occurence of this conception is Emmanuel Swedenborg's visions of the heavens — i.e., the angelic world — as a human body, apparently under the influence of kabbalistic sources. [V]</page><page sequence="2">Summaries ON THE SOURCES OF RABBI MOSES DE LEON'S EARLY KABBALISTIC SYSTEM by A. Farber In thirteenth-century Spain theosophical Kabbalah developed into several central schools, most of which can be recognized in historical profile. Along with kabbalists whose speculative interest focused on the hidden life of the divine Pleroma and its symbolic representation, there were esoteric groups that evolved nontheosophical systems — also called "Kabbalah"—centered on contemplation of the mysteries of the Hebrew language. Rabbi Moses de Leon, author of the Seferha Zohar, and his colleague Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla, one of the greatest kabbalistic theosophists, devoted their first literary efforts largely to the nontheosophical mysticism of language. Various manuscripts preserve a number of anonymous kabbalistic treatises that explore the secrets of the letters and the divine names. These texts betray a profound affinity with the pre-theosophical phase of de Leon's Kabbalah; i.e., Or Zaru'a, his first known kabbalistic work, composed before the Midrash ha-Ne'lam of the earliest zoharic stratum. They combine traditions of angelology, which are linked to speculation on the structure of the divine Chariot, with an array of philosophic ideas and terms. Their method of deriving theological, metaphysical, and cosmological truths is based on manipulation of the elements of written language, including the divine names and the letters of the alphabet. Supplementing our knowledge of language mysticism among other circles of kabbalists, primarily those of Rabbi Abraham Abulafia and Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla, such literature indicates the existence of a separate school with its own distinguishing features. In the present study we establish that the treatises under consideration originate in the thirteenth century, from a school of adepts who cultivated the mysteries of the letters and names behind the screen of pseudepigraphy. Within the context of this group the early [VI]</page><page sequence="3">Summaries kabbalistic system of Rabbi Moses de Leon crystallized, as it maintains in the Or Zaru'a and as its traces linger in one of his theosophical works in manuscript. Or Zaru'a even alludes to his sources in this obscure circle through unusual rhetorical signals. Comparison of the main ideas in Or Zaru'a and its sister texts with Gikatilla's early system dictates an additional conclusion. Although the literary relationship between Or Zaru'a and Gikatilla's Ginnat Egoz, his major composition on alphabetical mysticism, is beyond doubt — the direction of influence is undecided — there is no question that these works delineate two different schools. The fundamental contrast is exhibited in Gikatilla's divergent understanding of the active intellect, which he identifies with the angel Metatron. At the current stage of research, therefore, we might differentiate between at least three prominent circles of kabbalists concentrating on the secret lore of the Hebrew language and the divine names in the thirteenth century. These circles share common sources, personal contacts, and reciprocal ideological and literary influences. Their historical representatives are Rabbi Abraham Abulafia and, in the formative periods of their careers, Rabbis Joseph Gikatilla and Moses de Leon. Some of their sources are inaccessible, and a special investigation of the rich tradition concerning the divine names handed down by the Ashkenazi Hasidim and its possible influence on Spanish Kabbalah would be fruitful. THE NARRATIVE OF THE LETTERS AND ITS SOURCE: A STUDY OF A ZOHARIC MIDRASH ON THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET by M. Oron The "narrative of the letters" in the preface to the Zohar (1:26-36) is related to a large group of Midrashim that expound the symbolic [VII]</page><page sequence="4">Summaries importance of the letters of the alphabet and their connection with the creation of the world. They may be divided into two classes: (a) very short homilies lacking a literary framework and (b) homilies with distinct literary elements, built around a dialogue between God and the Torah or the letters. In this essay the author investigates the midrashic sources of the Zohar, and presents a comparison of the Alfabet de-Rabbi Akiva (version B) and the zoharic author's midrash. An analysis of the Zohar's homiletical technique and its use of sources is also included. THE KABBALISTIC BOOK BADDEIHA-ARON AND KABBALISTIC PSEUDEPIGRAPHY IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY by J. Dan Rabbi Shem Tov ibn Gaon wrote his kabbalistic work,Baddei ha-Aron, in Jerusalem and Safed between 1315 and 1325. This work is different in many respects from his earlier kabbalistic works, written in Spain before his immigration to Eretz Israel. One of the most important differences is his constant use of pseudepigraphy, which he vehemently denounced in the beginning of Baddei ha-Aron, but adopted wholeheartedly in the second half of the book. This is especially important concerning the treatise called "The Epistle of Worms,,י which he described as an ancient traditional work received by him, while evidence is presented in the paper which makes it most probable that he wrote the treatise himself. The dramatic change that Rabbi Shem Tov underwent while writing this book can be explained by the impact on him of the pseudepigraphical works of Rabbi Isaac ha-Kohen of Soria and his school, and probably some tendencies in the kabbalistic traditions prevailing at that time in Eretz Israel. [VIII]</page><page sequence="5">Summaries THE BEGINNING OF RABBI JOSEPH ASHKENAZI'S COMMENTARY ON GENESIS RABBAH by M. Hallamish Rabbi Joseph Ashkenazi, a fourteenth-century kabbalist, is known mainly for two large treatises. His commentary on Sefer Yezirah is available in print, albeit under the name of Rabbi Abraham ben David. His commentary on the bereshit lection of Genesis Rabbah, an earlier work, has been heretofore extant only in manuscript. The authors individuality lies in weaving philosophic argument into the fabric of his commentary, but with a proclivity to juxtapose Kabbalah as antithesis. A manuscript of the Genesis Rabbah commentary will soon appear in a critical edition, based on comparison with the three remaining manuscripts. Here an advance publication of the introduction and annotated text of the first chapter is offered. "HA-KELIPPAH ZOREKH HA-KEDUSHAH" by B. Zak Rabbi Moses Cordovero discussed the necessary goal of evil, a subject that gained major importance in Jewish thought after the rise of Lurianic Kabbalah. The novel expression ha-kelippah zorekh ha kedushah ("the impure husks are the requisite of sanctiflcation") in Cordovero's commentary on the Zohar, Or Yakar, constitutes an approach that discerns in evil the means of effecting a divine imperative. Triumph of the forces of evil in historical situations brings about an intensified downward flow of holiness to the realm of humanity, [IX]</page><page sequence="6">Summaries according to Cordovero, so that it can withstand evil. Cordovero also probed the status of the evil powers at the time of redemption and the future destruction of the kelippot. There is consistency in Cordovero,s theory of evil and its function. This world in all the phases of its existence depends to a degree on evil. Nevertheless, in consequence of certain sins, such as that of Adam, the strength of evil sometimes exceeds its allotted measure. Yet even then evil has its purpose in arousing the forces of sanctity to help overcome it. Just as the world needs evil, so does evil constitute an essential element in man's being, and so does the struggle against evil shape religious life. THE DOCTRINE OF METEMPSYCHOSIS IN GALYA RAZA by R. Elior The kabbalistic theory of metempsychosis (gilguf) achieved broad circulation and appreciable sway with the spread of Lurianic Kabbalah at the close of the sixteenth century. However, a systematic exposition of transmigration had actually been developed in Kabbalah during the first half of that century, a generation before the Ari. The anonymous kabbalist who authored the book GalyaRaza discussed this doctrine at great length. Galya Raza was written intermittently between 1543 and 1553, free of the impact of the Kabbalah of Safed. The work suggests an environment where the Kabbalah was striving for prestige in Jewish intellectual life and where Muslim and Christian cultures domiciled together, although no Christian censorship was operative. These impressions may indicate the region of Turkey-Greece as the place of composition. [X]</page><page sequence="7">Summaries The theory of metempsychosis that characterizes Galya Raza drew on dreams, visions, and revelations of supernal authority, conferred upon an author who assumed high spiritual attainment for himself and an eschatological mission for his book. His readiness to divulge the secrets vouchsafed to him ensues from his faith in the speedy advent of the end of days and his imputation of apocalyptic spirit to the Zohar's then-increasing reputation. Through the propagation of his visions and historiosophical exegesis, grounded in the zoharic scheme, he aspired to hasten the redemption. The author of Galya Raza proposed an original historiosophical interpretation of the meaning of exile and redemption by way of two interrelated doctrines, that of evil and that of gilgul. The connection insinuated in kabbalistic literature between these two doctrines evolves in Galya Raza into an elaborate teaching, which elucidates from a sweeping historical perspective the substance of evil and its import for psychology. The relationship of evil to the soul, in turn, serves to explain the interregnum of the Diaspora and vindicate the legitimacy of Jewish national restoration. A foundation of zoharic dualism is observed in Galya Raza. The work incorporates an extreme duälistic world view that entails mutual complementariness of good and evil on the one hand, and mutual independence of the two contending dominions on the other. Yet, unlike in the Zohar, the main rivalry here does not erupt in the realm of the Sefirot. Instead, the arena is the historical vicissitudes of Israel, the cryptic meaning of which is bound up in the conflict. In the opinion of the book's author, the full spectrum of Israel's annals dramatizes the struggle between the profane and holy forces, which are adjoined in a complex dialectical fashion. Moreover, the outcome is determined by the prowess of Israel and its weapons: the mysteries of transmigration and the kabbalistic construction of the mizvot. The crucial battle takes place in the realm of transmigration of the soul. Gilgul is twofold, embracing divine justice and mercy. In its aspect of justice, metempsychosis is a punitive procedure implemented directly or indirectly by the sinistral emanations of the sitra ahra, [XI]</page><page sequence="8">Summaries commensurate with man's deeds and unbeknownst to him. In its aspect of mercy, the graded retribution of sequential gilgulim involves a symmetrical cleansing and ascent of the soul from one level of existence to the next. It thus provides Israel a vehicle for repentance and restitution, and a safe traverse of the successive cosmic millennia. Metempsychosis is a symbol and expression of the collective state of the Jewish people, rather than a mere individual penalty. Galya Raza's theory of metempsychosis encompasses reincarnation in animals, atonement for sin, animal sacrifice, the powers of evil, and the commandments, but the guiding interest is historical eschatological. Indeed, the author holds the law of transmigration perpetually incumbent upon all being as a manifestation of God's dynamic immanence in history. The historical problem that most intrigued him was the question of redemption. In an endeavor to fathom its true nature and hidden solution he summoned the doctrine of gilgul. He understood the soul's transmigration as its redemption, and historical redemption as the purifying redemption of the body. The author of Galya Raza declared historical redemption to be a reflection of metahistorical redemption, the goal of which is to rescue Israel from the clutches of the sitra ahra. In so doing he transformed a vague, arbitrary notion of redemption into an intricate teleological program for the deliverance of the Jewish people from exile to redemption, and from history to immortality. NOTES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RABBI MENAHEM AZARIAH FANO'S KABBALISTIC DOCTRINE by A. Altmann It is well known that Rabbi Menahem Azariah Fano originally followed the teachings of Rabbi Moses Cordovero, but later adopted [XII]</page><page sequence="9">Summaries Lurianic Kabbalah in the form presented by Rabbi Israel Sarug. The present study seeks to show that there was an intermediate stage in Fano's development, an adoption of Lurianism in the form of Rabbi Moshe Yonah's version of it. Evidence of this may be found in the changes than can be traced in successive editions by Fano of the Sefer Kanfei Yonah, a treatise by Moshe Yonah adopted as it were and revised by Fano. In the oldest extant version (HUC Ms. 505) the Lurianic doctrine of zimzum is portrayed as implying a mere "gradation" (haqpalah) of emanation, not as assuming a self-limitation of Ein-Sof In the final version there appears what to all intents and purposes amounts to the essential elements of the Lurianic-Sarugian doctrine, which Fano first expressed in his Yonat Elem, shorn of some of the more strikingly mythological features of Sarug's system. Fano also omitted the motif of sha'ashu'a, which implies a motion on God's part toward creation. He remained faithful to Cordovero's distinction between the will of God and the Supreme Deity as the possessor of the will. Ein-Sof he identified with the will. However, no change was possible in the still higher principle of the possessor of the will. Evidence of Fano's intermediate stage can be detected also by a comparison of two recensions of his Glosses on a treatise written by Hayyim Vital, and sent to Italy by Samson Baqi (Baq), of which Fano seems to have been the recipient. JONAH AS THE MESSIAH BEN JOSEPH by Y. Liebes Various passages in midrashic literature evince that the sages considered the prophet Jonah a messianic figure, specifically the eschatological warrior Messiah ben Joseph. A similar motif is found in the New Testment and the works of the Church fathers, which see in [XIII]</page><page sequence="10">Summaries Jonah a prefiguring of Jesus of Nazareth and a proof of Jesus' resurrection. The Christian authors presumably borrowed this theme from Jewish sources, relying also on numerous midrashim that identified Jonah with the son of the woman of Zarefat whom Elijah had retrieved from death. The pairing of Jonah with the Messiah ben Joseph recurs extensively in Lurianic Kabbalah — especially in its seventeenth-century Polish form, the preeminent exponents of which were Rabbi Nathan Shapira of Cracow and Rabbi Samson of Ostropol. In their writings demonological and anti-Christian trends stand out. Christianity's doctrines are converted into vividly described demons that must be engaged in battle. For example, there is the frequent characterization of Jesus as a canine demon. The forces that are to fight and defeat these demons must resemble them in several ways, such as the correspondence of their names in gematria. Thus Jonah becomes in this literature not only the Messiah ben Joseph, who combats Gog and Magog, but the "annihilator" (mevattel) of Jesus as well — that is, from the Christian point of view, the antichrist — and at the very same time the image drawn of Jonah approximates that of Jesus. These anti-Christian kabbalists seem to have been influenced by the Christians' idea that a prototype of Jesus abided in the prophet Jonah. Samson of Ostropol, the mystic with a tempestuous nature, apparently thought himself to be both Messiah ben Joseph and Jonah. In his martyrdom for the sake of kiddush ha-Shem during the massacres of 1648, an end for which he prepared throughout his lifetime, he envisioned the climax of the Messiah ben Joseph's war against Christianity. The second part of the article examines the biblical portrayal of Jonah in an attempt to clarify what caused the assignment of the messianic role to this particular figure. A definite difference emerges between Jonah and the other prophets, which warranted naming him the Messiah ben Joseph. Jonah had enjoyed an unparalleled personal empathy with God that demanded a unique ethic, one in which mercy precedes judgment. Careful attention to the account of the Ninevites' [XIV]</page><page sequence="11">Summaries penitence and God's final reply to Jonah reveals the ironical tone of the narrator. God pardoned the inhabitants of the city, not because they repented of their wickedness; the decisive factor was His attribute of mercy, which regards man and beast equally. This predilection for beneficence over severity points to the source for the Christians' identification of Jonah with Jesus. However, the Christian orientation departs from Jonah's expressly national conception of mercy in the Bible. It had been difficult for Jonah to suffer mercy toward the non-Israelite people of Nineveh, but in Second Kings he had zealously prophesied consolation for Israel regardless of their transgressions. There is another aspect of the biblical image of Jonah that befits the Messiah ben Joseph, who will sacrifice his life in the fulfillment of his charge. The prophet yearned deeply for death, a further sign of a close personal relationship to the Divine, as well as one of the motives for the association of Jonah with the child revived by Elijah.
