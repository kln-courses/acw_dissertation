<plain_text><page sequence="1">Edvard Munch's Self-Portrait with Cigarette: Smoking and the Bohemian Persona Patricia G. Berman "One can no longer regard Herr Munch as a man to be taken seriously, nor as even having a normal mind. He either seems to be, in an artistic sense, hallucinating or joking, and he looks down upon the public and degrades art and human life."' Such was the reaction that Edvard Munch (1863- 1944) received when he held a large and much-anticipated one-man exhibition in his hometown of Kristiania (present- day Oslo) in the autumn of 1895. The exhibition included some of Munch's most stylistically and psychologically chal- lenging images, including The Scream (1893), Vampire (1893), and Madonna (1894-95), as well as less overtly audacious yet nonetheless maligned works such as Portrait of Ragnhild Backstrim (1893).2 This exhibition, the artist's first in Kristi- ania in three years,3 consolidated Munch's critical reputation as both visionary and malefactor. Central to this process was Munch's Self-Portrait with Cigarette, exhibited as Self-Portrait (Fig. 1). Painted in 1895, when Munch was thirty-two years old, Self-Portrait with Cigarette is loaded with subtle contradictions. Lacking an identifiable environment and depicting the artist viewed frontally and slightly from below, the self-portrait represents Munch as a man directly engaging his viewer yet distanced from the world. Lit theatrically from below, his face and his right hand stand out in sharp relief against the blue background in a manner that is, as one of his critics noted, related to Rembrandt.4 Tiny spatters of blue paint, which form a mist across his cheeks and shirt collar, initiate the gradual absorption of the artist's darkly clad body by the swirling blue background. The control and self-assurance projected by Munch's rigid posture and direct gaze are belied by the physical dissolution suggested by the sickly ocher highlights on his hands, eyelids, and mouth. The cigarette that Munch holds in his right hand, from which plumes of blue smoke rise upward to thicken the already hazy atmosphere, is the symbolic agent of this dissolution. Scholars have suggested that Munch included the ciga- rette as a formal device, "a quasi-naturalistic explanation for the symbolically enveloping haze,"5 as a sign for sexual potency,6 or as a loose reference to the caf6 society that the artist was known to frequent.7 It could also be argued that tobacco is foremost a physical addiction, and that by repre- senting himself smoking, Munch provided a public view of his daily life. Although the cigarette smoke unquestionably furnished Munch with a practical source for the theatrical lighting and disjunctively hazy quality of his painting, and revealed a private habit, it also provided him with an identity that was accessible and familiar to his audience. The smoldering cigarette, Munch's sole prop in his self- portrait, was an object that served as a nexus for marginal social identities in the 1890s. At that time, the cigarette was associated with deviancy--caf6 society, poverty, and illness- and with death. Suggesting a slippage between social catego- ries-identities both male and female, upper- and lower- class-and between intact and disintegrating mental states and physical and political bodies, the cigarette challenged the notion of their boundaries. As a symbol of such social dissolution, the cigarette played a role in both Max Nordau's condemnation of Degeneration andJ. K. Huysmans's celebra- tion of Decadence, in medical and sociological theories of aberrancy, and in popular constructions of gendered behav- ior. By selecting the cigarette as his chief attribute in Self-Portrait with Cigarette, Munch elevated the social ritual of smoking into a metaphor and invited the spectator to transfer the cigarette's associations onto himself. This study examines the background for this constructed identity and the social base for its reading. It proposes that the cigarette, which was only mass-marketed for the first time in the 1880s, constituted an emblem of Bohemian and Decadent culture, and that Munch included the cigarette in his 1895 self- portrait as a programmatic assertion of his affiliation with the European Decadent community. At the time of Munch's 1895 exhibition in Kristiania, Self-Portrait with Cigarette was cited by critics as an expression of the artist's highest achievements. In a lecture delivered before the University Students' Organization, the writer Sigbjorn Obstfelder called the artist "a lyrical poet with Portions of this article were presented as a paper in May 1990 at the annual conference of the Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Studies in Madison, Wisc., under the title, "Emblems of Decadence"; and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in March 1991 under the title, "Edvard Munch, Smoking, and the Bohemian Persona."

A genius."8 The power of Munch's imagination was, according to Obstfelder, concentrated in the self-portrait, which "describes the soul more than any facial characteristic." Obstfelder compared its "deep underlying beauty" to the psychological resonance of Rembrandt's work,9 thus establish- ing both a formal lineage for the painting and an artistic genealogy for the painter. The writer Helge Rode wrote of the painful sensitivity of Munch's art and even referred to its aristocratic qualities, claiming the self-portrait to reveal a "noble head."''0 At the same time, however, Self-Portrait with Czgarette also occupied the center of a controversy over Munch's mental condition, and over the social threat posed by his "abnormal" works. By October 1, 1895, when Munch's exhibition opened, the artist was already established as an important if deeply troubling presence both in Germany and in Norway. In Germany, Munch's work had been targeted repeatedly as corrupting, dangerous, and sick." The assaults on his art and character provoked by this particular exhibition, how- ever, were especially damaging because they came not only from art critics, but from within the medical community. A particularly vitriolic attack against Munch was launched in Norway by Johan Scharffenberg, a twenty-six-year-old medical student. In statements made before the University Students' Organization at the time of Obstfelder's lecture, Scharffenberg established a direct link between Munch's radical images and the occurrences of illness in the artist's family.12 By placing art criticism under the aegis of science, Scharffenberg gave credence to the notion that the peculiar nature of Munch's creativity was the result of a medical condition. The artist's motifs, palette, and orchestration of pictorial space were not the fruits of artistic labor, but the result of an inherited morbidity. Scharffenberg placed Self- Portrait wzth Czgarette at the center of this proposition: "As [Munch's] self-portrait demonstrates, he is by no means a normal man. When an artist is abnormal, a shadow is thrown over all of his art."'3 Suggesting that Munch's work was the direct materialization of the artist's abnormal mental state, or his "degeneration,"'14 he even invoked the possibility of a contagion: the obvious moral laxity and decadence of Munch's work would exert a corrupting influence over Norwegian youth. This assertion was repeated, and contested, in the Kristiania press.15 Unlike other negative art criticism which merely dismissed Munch as inept-one Kristiania critic described Munch's work as operating "on the borderline between earnestness and caricature" '6--Scharffenberg diag- nosed the artist as both sick and dangerous. Having repeatedly been the target of similar attacks, Munch understood the ease with which social commentators, such as Scharffenberg, were able to translate his aesthetics into other discourses: "I do not think that my art is sick- despite what Scharffenberg and many others believe. Those kind of people do not understand the true function of art, nor do they know anything about its history.""17 For Munch in the 1890s, the true artist, the progressive artist, rejected the minutiae of daily life and focused instead on broader philo- sophical and spiritual issues.18 Like many others of his generation, Munch considered illness a paradigm for creativ- ity. Illness suggested a condition in which the aesthetic imagination could exceed the constraints imposed by the rational mind, and provided a space within which the artist's creative faculties could operate. Indeed, Munch often as- serted that illness and anxiety were central to his work. Through such (by-now) well-known statements as "sickness and insanity were the black angels that guarded my cradle,"'9 Munch asserted that mental and physical disintegration were the creative starting points for his investigations. Such statements, however, should not be interpreted as evidence of Munch as either suffering from uncontrollable pessimism, or as victimized by an inevitable genetically encoded degen- eration. They suggest, rather, that Munch viewed aberrant states of emotion, and particularly the emotional world of social outsiders living beyond the boundaries of bourgeois life, to be genuine points of germination for progressive art. As Barbara Spackman suggests, illness commonly served as both metaphor and conduit for such ambitions at the turn of the century.20 Scharffenberg, the son of a public official, an ardent nationalist, and a strong supporter of Positivist art and literature,21 extracted a different message from Munch's work. He viewed it as a threat to national health. In an article published in the Kristiania weekly Den 17. Mai shortly after Obstfelder's public lecture, Scharffenberg contrasted Norwe- gian youths the way he wished to see them-"healthy youthful sportsmen out skiing"-with those seduced by the 8 S.

His statements about Munch were consistent with the animus with which he viewed mysticism and Deca- dence in art and literature. As Reinhold Heller and others have observed,23 Scharffenberg's rhetoric in 1895 relied heavily on the reduc- tive arguments of the Hungarian-born physician and critic Max Nordau, whose influential medical study of deviancy in art and literature, Degeneration, had been published in the previous year. In Degeneration, Nordau attributed recent developments in European art to the decline of national vigor, and in turn linked social enervation to the influence exerted by diseased artists on the general population: "Books and works of art exercise a powerful suggestion on the masses. It is from these productions that an age derives its ideals of morality and beauty. If they are absurd and anti-social, they exert a disturbing and corrupting influence on the views of a whole generation ... especially the impressionable youth."24 Providing the underpinnings of Scharffenberg's attack on Munch, Nordau identified modern art as a contagion and the modern artist as pathological, and posited vision and perception as conduits for both physical and psychic degeneration. Scharffenberg's commentary on Munch coincided with the broader introduction of Nordau's theories of Degeneration to Norway. Between January 1 and February 17, 1895, the Kristiania newspaper Morgenbladet had published in its spe- cial supplement a six-part series of articles analyzing a recently published book by the literary critic Christian Collin entitled Art and Morality. Contrzbution to the Critzcism of Realist Poets and Critzcs.25 The articles, also entitled "Art and Morality," examined in detail Collin's belief that the purpose of art is to edify society and provide optimistic models of humanity, and they summarized his consequent assertions that "the new aestheticism" was socially destructive. Collin wrote that an artist should be "like a doctor trying to save lives,"''26 and, like a doctor, should act as "[a consul] who has the responsibility to see that the state will not be damaged.""27 Like Nordau, Collin compared Decadence in literature to an illness, and stressed the danger posed to the nation, and particularly the nation's youth, by pessimistic themes in art and literature. This threat of pessimism and Decadence to the vitality of the nation was also examined in articles in the popular press in Kristiania throughout 1895, as for example in Morgenbladet's edition of March 31, which examined "Modern Decadent Christendom," and Morgenbladet's Sep- tember 8 edition, which focused on secular and mystical beliefs among the disaffected youth of France. While Scharffenberg claimed only partial agreement with Collin, he acknowledged that he would rather "have youth follow him than the Decadents" in order to support social health.28 The nation's youth should inject vitality into the body politic, and not, as it seemed to be doing, initiate its decline. Nordau's Degeneration had set the tone for such debates. In his anthropomorphic model of civilization, Nordau defined late nineteenth-century society as aging, degenerative, and decaying. The morbid artist was its legitimate heir. In describing the etiology of degeneration, Nordau attributed the condition not only to the effects of art, but to poisoning through indulgence: "A race which is regularly addicted, even without excess, to narcotics and stimulants in any form (such as fermented alcoholic drinks, tobacco, opium, hash- ish, arsenic) . . . begets degenerate descendants who, if they remain exposed to the same influences, rapidly descend to the lowest degrees of degeneracy, to idiocy, to dwarfishness, etc." Statistics, he claims, attest to the increasing poisoning of "civilized peoples," and he cites, among other examples, tobacco consumption in France, Germany, and England, which had doubled between 1841 and 1890.29 A second form of poisoning, inherent in the urban environment, also contributed to degeneration: through rootlessness, adulter- ated food, and the overstimulation of the senses, the city, according to Nordau, could even exert a feminizing influ- ence on male morphology.30 Thus in Nordau's equation, substance abuse and the pressures of urbanism are elevated from the sphere of social concerns to the arenas of national decline and medical crisis. They are also inscribed specifi- cally on the body of the "progressive" or decadent artist- urban, indulgent, contagious, neurasthenic,31 feminized. Central to Nordau's argument was his appropriation of one of the chief rhetorical devices of Decadent literature- the artistic attachment to dissolution and even self-annihila- tion-as a weapon against Decadence. The Parisian literary movement of the 1870s and eighties known as "Decadence" advocated a rejection of Naturalistic narrative in art and literature, and a turn toward the authenticity and authority of subjective experience.

Further, they maintained a rhetoric of moral deformity as a source of artistic redemption. In turn, the authors were themselves accorded attributes of a culti- vated disintegration. Th6ophile Gautier's description of Charles Baudelaire in the introduction to an 1868 edition of Les Fleurs du mal provides an archetypal description of the Decadent artist: Baudelaire is attuned to ". .. the most subtle confidences of neurosis, the confessions of aging passions which enter depravity, and the bizarre hallucinations of obsession turning into madness."32 By the early 1890s, the physical attributes that corre- sponded to this psychological condition were well defined. The Viennese critic Hermann Bahr identified them in a de- scription ofJames McNeil Whistler's 1891 portrait of Robert de Montesquiou, in his essay entitled "Decadence": There he is, the haggard, pale Dandy ... entirely in, black, very tall, very thin, very sleek, a little affected, heroic yet bizarre, nearly sublime, but comical.... He appears [to his friends] as the great artist not through his works, but through his power .. . to hallucinate [while] fully con- scious, to escape into unreality, to live a poem, that is "the art of the Decadence"; in this he is the master. . .33 Whistler's studiously artificial representation, including a setting removed from any references to nature, was for Bahr, as for the comte de Montesquiou (on whom Huysmans based the protagonist of his novel A rebours),34 a virtual personifica- tion of Decadence. The ambivalence of such an identity-- located between the aristocratic and the Bohemian-is affixed by Bahr to Whistler's portrayal of the author's body. It should be emphasized here that cigarette smoking was still uncommon in Norway in the 1880s. Even in the nineties, when tobacco taxes amounted to nearly twenty-three percent of all import revenues in Norway,35 cigarettes accounted for only the smallest profits realized by Tiedemann's Tobacco Company, the largest Norwegian tobacco concern. Indeed, 1895 was the first year in which any profit was reported by Tiedemann's cigarette division at all.36 Tobacco sales else- where in Europe support the image of the cigarette as a relatively rare but growing commodity: in 1900, only twenty percent of the tobacco purchased in Great Britain was consumed in the form of cigarettes.37 It should also be stressed that, prior to the 1890s, artists rarely fashioned self-portraits that included cigarettes.38 A few examples of these rare images might, however, have been available to Munch. One that has been cited as a direct source for Munch's painting is a photographic self-portrait by August Strindberg from 1889 (Fig. 2), in which the play- wright has incongruously removed the glove from his left hand in order to extend a smoking cigarette toward the camera.39 Another likely source is the well-known litho- graphic self-portrait by the Parisian painter and caricaturist Paul Gavarni from 1845 (Fig. 3). Widely reproduced and readily accessible in Volume II of Richard Muther's Geschichte der Malerei im XIX. Jahrhundert from 1893-94, the image could have been known to Munch and his circle.40 Muther's text accompanying the reproduction of this image41 de- scribes the sitter, Gavarni, as the prototypical Decadent: "In his own dress [Gavarni] had a taste for what was dandified, and plunged into the enjoyment of Parisian life that eddied around in a world of pleasure ... at bottom Gavarni was ... an artist of strangely somber imagination, a profound and melancholy philosopher who had a prescience of all the mysteries of life.'"42 Like Munch's self-portrait, the message extracted from Gavarni's image-of night life, effeteness, marginality, and dissolution-is enhanced by the inclusion of the cigarette.43 Dissolution was also presented as a model for artistic authenticity. This model, defined through a series of opposi- tional images, was applied by the Symbolist critic Albert Aurier to Vincent van Gogh in 1890: ". .. a thoroughbred with the brutal hands of a giant, the nerves of a hysterical woman, the soul of a mystic, .. . [who] is at once too simple and too subtle for the contemporary bourgeois spirit." 44The connection between artistic creativity and illness that runs throughout this text was central to much late nineteenth- century art criticism. It had been well enough established 32 T. Gautier, "Charles Baudelaire," foreword to C. Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mal, Paris, 1868, 17. 33 H.

As Rein- hold Heller has noted, he used as his vehicle a review of Munch's work. Drawing upon a parallel repertory of images to those invoked in the description of Van Gogh, Aubert defined Munch as: ... nervously sensitive, seeking stimulation to the very point of sickness; in his veins is the blood of an extraordi- narily noble race. . . .

This perspec- tive informed and reinforced the way in which artists created images of themselves. When first introduced to Scandinavian art criticism in the 1890s, the concept of Decadence pro- vided a point of departure for young artists who struggled to record and legitimize their subjective experience. They strove to produce works that specifically announced the artists' identification with urban and international values. Munch's Self-Portrait with Cigarette suggests such an affilia- tion. Here, the artist has portrayed himself almost program- matically as an alienated, mysterious, "sickly sensitive," and yet intellectually powerful aesthete. His act of hermeticism, his clothing, pallid complexion, and smoking cigarette func- tion as loci for such an interpretation. The condition of neurasthenia, which Aubert attributed to Munch, had first been identified in 1869 by the American psychologist George M. Beard as a functional disorder of the nervous system that resulted in lassitude, enervation, and a diminution of sexual vigor.47 His 1879 book The Treatment of 45 P.

The disorder was first described for the Scandinavian community by the Danish psychiatrist Knud Pontoppidan in 1886.49 By the 1890s, neurasthenia was widely known, if not well defined. The sociologist Emile Durkheim identified the condition in 1897 as a series of intermediate stages that exist "between mental alienation properly so-called and perfect equilibrium of intelligence."50 In language that might describe the highest aspirations of the Decadent artist, Durkheim pointed to the unusual sensory apparatus of the sufferer: "Due to the extreme sensitivity of his nervous system, his ideas and feelings are always in unstable equilibrium. Because his slightest impressions have an abnormal force, his mental organization is utterly upset at every instant, and under the hammer of these uninterrupted shocks cannot become definitely established. It is always in process of becoming.""51 Durkheim also proposed that the neurasthenic may be predisposed to suicide, "for by tempera- ment neurasthenics seem destined to suffer."52 As Eric T. Carlson has demonstrated,53 neurasthenia was absorbed into the discourse of Decadence by the 1890s. Max Nordau incorporated neurasthenia into his etiology of Degen- eration, linking it to the negative forces of urban life. Intoxi- cants, as cited by Beard and others,54 were among those forces. The cigarette, one token of urban decline, came under special consideration in the literature of the late nineteenth century as an agent of neurasthenia, in part because it emerged as a popular form of tobacco in the same decades that neurasthe- nia became known. As Beard noted in his 1881 supplement to Nervous Exhaustion, the use of cigarettes was becoming widespread, replacing the previous generation's enjoyment of cigars and pipes.55 Cigarettes, the "national accompaniment of the creeping neurasthenia of urban existence,"56 were, ac- cording to the German surgeon Theodor Billroth, a "disgust- ing vice" that "ruins health, and the passion for it to be the result of idleness and ennui .... Society is becoming more and more neurotic, and this is due to alcohol and tobacco."'57 Beard also suggested a shift in the demographics of smoking, noting "fewer persons of the same classes who made an excessive use of it than formerly, and of those who use it, even but lightly, there is an increasing number who are perceptibly injured by it."58 A broad spectrum of social meanings were associated with the cigarette in the later nineteenth century. With its Euro- pean origins in the beggars' society in sixteenth-century Seville, where the poor re-rolled discarded cigar butts in paper in order to provide themselves with tobacco, the cigarette only gained respectability during the Napoleonic Wars among French soldiers both in Spain and in the East. Turkish cigarettes became fashionable during the Crimean War, at which time tobacconists in England and France first began to hand-roll cigarettes for the luxury trade. Like the cigar, the hand-rolled cigarette was more expensive than pipe tobacco, and was to be reserved for the well-to-do.59 Cigars remained the tobacco of preference among (male) members of the bourgeoisie, although by mid-century, the cigarette was a viable, if less popular, alternative to the pipe and cigar. Finally, the introduction of better-quality tobacco and finer paper in the 1860s enhanced the appeal of cigarettes, especially in Austria and France.60 Technological and marketing innovations initiated in the United States eventually made cigarettes the least expensive form of tobacco on the world market. In 1880, the American James Bonsack applied for a patent for the cigarette rolling machine, and by the early eighties, the machine was able to produce two hundred cigarettes per minute. A leading innovator in production and advertising, W. Duke, Sons, and Company, as well as its competitors, reduced the cost of cigarettes by more than half, to approximately five cents for a package of twenty, making them the cheapest, and thus most democratic, form of tobacco available.6' The prices in Eu- rope dropped accordingly as American tobacco increasingly found its way into European markets. Thus, as George Beard noted, by the mid-1880s the demographics of cigarette smoking had shifted. The ciga- rette had become associated with the laboring classes. Au- guste Renoir's Dance at Bougival (1883; Fig. 4) is in part premised on this association. The cigarette butts and matches that litter the ground under the couple dancing at the center, and the detritus of the open-air caf6 society illustrated in the background, suggest the discards of a proletarian outing, while they assert the working-class identity of the dancing couple in the foreground. Th6ophile-Alexandre Steinlen's first lithographic poster, advertising the singing duet Mothu et Doria in their musical revue Sclnes Impressionnistes (1893; Fig. 5), makes the class-specific association with the cigarette even clearer.

In 1895, following a period of treatment by Pontoppidan, the Norwegian author Amalie Skram published two novels in which she accused the psychiatrist of extreme unprofessionalism and abuse.

The cigarette identified its smoker as someone living outside middle-class boundaries, or as someone with pretensions to working-class status. The eradication of such boundaries was one of the ideals of Munch's circle of friends and associates during his early adulthood in Kristiania. There, in the 1880s, the cigarette was an accepted part of the artist's social environment. A painting by Christian Krohg, A Corner of My Studio (Bohemi- ans) (Fig. 6), records the studio life of Munch in 1885. Krohg represents four of his young friends and students seated under aJapanese umbrella in his studio. The twenty-one-year- old Munch lights a cigarette to the left, the painter and actor Kalle Lochen stands smoking a cigarette to the right, while the actress Constance Bruun and painter Oda Lasson (later Christian Krohg's wife) look on.63 Munch's etching, Christi- ania Boheme II (1895; Fig. 7), chronicles another aspect of his social environment: the caf6. Positioned around a table are 62 This type of contrast can be found in the literature of the period as well, including Henrik Ibsen's The Wild Duck, in which the pipe and the cigar are used to symbolize contrasting social milieux in the first act. Schulerud (pp. 61ff.) catalogues many examples of Naturalist literature of the latter 19th century that rely on cigars and pipes as indicators of social and political standing. 63 Oscar Thue identified the models and the locale in Christian Krohgs sosiale tendenskunst, Oslo, 1955, 126 and 135; and in Christian Krohgs portretter, Oslo, 1971, 249. Again, the figures are placed within a milieu that identifies an alignment of their political and aesthetic affiliations: non-European objects associate the artists with the culture of Parisian Impressionism, and the casual postures of the youthful male and female figures suggest their identification with a Bohemian social environment.</page><page sequence="9">EDVARD MUNCH'S SELF-PORTRAIT WITH CIGARETTE 635 ct- MAO- Joe?i ........ .. ......... . . 6 Krohg, A Corner of My Studio (Bohemians), 1885, oil on canvas.

Munch, appearing in the extreme left foreground, sends cigarette smoke coiling up into the com- pressed space of the room. In both images, cigarettes serve as signifiers of transgressive social situations-the meeting of intellectuals of both genders in the studio setting, and the amoral social commerce of the caf6. Hans Jager, a left-wing writer (and later an anarchist) who dominated radical Kristiania art politics in the 1880s, was a leader and chronicler of the fledgling urban Norwegian Bo- hemian milieu in the mid-eighties. On the basis of his books, including Fra Christiania Boheme (From Kristiania's Bohemia) (1885), which chronicled the marginalized artists who mod- eled their intellectual lives on the literary vanguard in Paris, and Sick Love (1893), which promoted in graphic terms the doctrine of free love, the right of men and women to choose their sexual partners, Jaeger was viewed as one of the leading figures within the oppositional youth culture in Kristiania. As one of his closest associates in the 1880s, and as one of the most prolific visual recorders ofJaxger's caf6 milieu, Munch was seen by his contemporaries to be operating within the Bohemian subculture that Jaeger helped to define. Indeed, several of the critics who reviewed Munch's 1895 Kristiania exhibition suggested linkages between the Decadent or sub- versive themes in Munch's work and Jager's influence.64 As attested by Munch's etching of the "Kristiania Boheme," and a caricature of Jager published in a Kristiania newspa- per in 1888 (Fig. 8), cigarettes and alcohol were emblems of Jaxger's Bohemian persona and community. The two scenes at the right of the caricature contrast two forms of opposi- tional activity-destructive and constructive-within Norwe- gian art circles. While the painter Frits Thaulow sits ironically imprisoned and chained to his easel in Norway, a palette- halo signifying his social position at home, the free and urbane Jager sits in exile in a Parisian caf6, smoking, drink- ing, and, as the caption tells us, spreading his gospel of "Free Love."65 Here Jaeger's cigarette, in its elegant holder, rein- forces the stereotype of the author as a poseur, a disengaged and effete Bohemian. For Jager's contemporaries, Bohemia represented the assertion of a disquieting subcultural voice that threatened to destabilize middle-class life. The "Kristiania Boheme" of the 1880s had been heavily dependent on the Parisian bohemian ideal. As George Snyderman and William Josephs have observed, "the institu- 64 See, e.g., "Nye Arbeider af Edv. Munch. Udstillingen hos Blomqvist" (as in n. 1). 65 In 1888, Thaulow had been sent to jail after slapping a newspaper editor. He remained in the same cell in which Jaeger had been incarcerated in 1886 for the publication of his book, From Kristiania's Bohemia. See O.

Oslo, Munch Museum (photo: Museum) tions of one Bohemia tend to become the institutions of every Bohemia."66 These institutions, according to C6sar Grafia, include dress, comportment, and rhetoric promoting dissent from prevailing middle-class modes of behavior, and the caf6, which provides the social setting for bohemian self-fashioning.67 The idea of Bohemia as a social space was most popularly mapped out by Henri Murger, author of Scenes from Bohemian Life, of 1849. More recently this mate- rial was reviewed by the historian Jerrold Seigel in his 1986 study Bohemian Paris.68 As Seigel has suggested, artists framing themselves as Bohemians occupied the borderland between bourgeois stability and the anarchy of the streets. Living on the margins, but aspiring to the center, the Bohemians of the nineteenth century defined themselves in relation to the stable middle class. Rejecting the "inaction" of domestic life, these intellectually cultivated individuals chose instead the caf6s, nightclubs, and music halls of Paris. These became the favored loci for the spectacle they made of their aesthetic debates. The definitions and boundaries of Bohemia changed with each generation of the nineteenth century. By the 1880s, the concept of Bohemia was enriched by the discourse of Decadence. Cigarettes and cigarette smokers, associated with the Bohemian milieu, came to play a well-defined role in literature as symbols of social deviancy. Th6ophile-Alex- andre Steinlen's vast chronicle of Montmartre, which in- cludes a view of the interior of the caf6 Le Mirliton (Fig. 9), in which trails of cigarette smoke rise upward, attests to the symbolic value of the cigarette for Bohemian caf6 life, and for the cross-coding of social class. Within the Bohemian caf6, the collapse of class differences became pronounced. Cigarettes also were emblematic of erotic exchange. For example, in The Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde repeat- edly used the cigarette as a device of transport and arousal.69 After first introducing Lord Henry Wotton, gazing at the world through "the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whirls from his opium-tainted cigarette,"70 Wilde couples virtually every philosophical monologue, or every transformative event in the story, with the ritual lighting of a cigarette. The cigarette itself is also a pivotal 66 G. S. Snyderman and W. Josephs, "Bohemia: The Underworld of Art" [1939], repr. in Grafia and Grafia, 92. 67 C. Grafia, intro. to ibid., xv. 68The term originated in reference to gypsies, whom the French mistakenly identified as coming from the geographic region of Bohemia, and to whom the French gave the name "Bohemians." The gypsies/ Bohemians were understood to be visionary, non-materialistic, rootless, close to nature, creative, and exotic. Their lives, seen to be circum- scribed by rootlessness, illness, and poverty, yet full ofjoy and creativity, became the model by which other marginal populations in Paris were identified in the 1830s and forties, and most specifically the oppositional artistic communities.

It is exquisite and it leaves you unsatisfied. What more could anyone wish for?"71 In J. K. Huysmans's A rebours, published in 1883 and one of the defining novels of Decadence, the cigarette was likewise the locus of self-referential activity, reverie, aesthetic inquiry, and erotic commerce. When he finds a young boy on the rue de Rivoli "sucking laboriously" on a cigarette that would not light, the protagonist Des Essientes not only offers him one of his superior "scented" cigarettes (and lights it), but he takes the boy to a brothel to introduce him "to the habit of these pleasures which his means forbid him enjoy- ing.""72 In these texts, one subversive pleasure begets another. The presence of the cigarette also accompanies a shifting of gender roles. In each story, the male protagonist assumes "feminine" characteristics, a transformation that helps to define him as an aesthete. His deviancy from bourgeois male modes of comportment, in fact, is supported by another association that the public had with cigarettes: in the hands of an upper-class male, the cigarette was viewed as a feminine attribute. From its first popular appearance at mid-century, the cigarette was widely understood to be an effete or feminized form of smoking. In 1854 the eminent American surgeon and author Russell Thacher Trall observed of New York: "Some of the ladies of this refined and fashion-forming metropolis are aping the ways of some pseudo-accomplished foreigners in smoking tobacco through a weaker and more feminine article which has been most delicately denominated cigarette" (emphasis in the original).73 Indeed, the cigarette's heavily processed tobacco and thin, cylindrical shape made it the tobacco of preference among women.74 As early as the 1840s, Louisa S. Costello, a British traveler in France, reported that the smoking of cigarettes had become "la grande mode with certain French ladies."75 It was assumed by the middle class that a cigarette smoked by a woman signaled other vices:76 "It is generally understood that the practice of cigarette-smoking by women is confined to two classes of the fair sex," wrote one tobacco historian at the turn of the 71 Ibid., 70. 72 J.

The other is-well, the demi-monde."77 This second cat- egory of female smoker entered popular imagery through the chroniclers of courtesans in Paris in the 1840s, and most notably through Paul Gavarni. As Baudelaire and others noted, Gavarni's images of courtesans functioned not only as archetypal images for the illustrations of these women, but as models of comportment for the women themselves.78 La Lorette (Fig. 10), an image strongly dependent on Gavarni's visual repertory,79 includes the full complement of signs for sexual availability-alcohol, the peignoir slipping from her shoulder, a dark chamber opening in the background, and a cigarette.80 The smoking cigarette as a sign of female sexual availabil- ity and satiation, as employed in this illustration, appeared throughout caricatural imagery in the late nineteenth cen- tury. One example is the Norwegian satirical magazine Krydseren, which announced the coming of autumn in its August 25, 1888 issue (Fig. 11) by parodying the annual cycle of Kristiania's highest cultural institutions. The opening of the National Theater is depicted through a contentious representation of Henrik Ibsen under the title "Art." Under the designation "Scholarship," the beginning of the University's new semester is represented by a male student with a fashionable woman, her moral turpitude indicated by her cigarette and alcoholic drink, perched on his knee. At about the same time, the painter Hans Heyerdahl used the cigarette as a sign for sexual commerce in his controversial painting Nude with Cigarette (Svarte-Anna) (ca. 1887; Fig. 12), an image that Hans Ja~ger apparently took with him to his jail cell when he was imprisoned in the autumn of 1886.81 A commentary on contemporary debates surrounding the role of prostitution in Kristiania society,82 this painting presents a strongly sexualized image of a model surrounded by em- blems of that work. The cigarette, held in the model's slack hand, adds to the tension between her robust youth and her sexual experience. The smoke issuing from between her rouged lips reinforces the message of sexual satiation, otherwise relayed by her reddened cheeks. By the 1880s, the cigarette was also believed to have aphrodisiac properties. Exploiting these ideas, cigarette manufacturers and importers linked the cigarette with fe- male sexuality in their sales campaigns.83 The Czech artist Alphonse Mucha's well-known advertising posters for Job cigarette papers of the later 1890s (Fig. 13) conveyed through feminized tobacco the titillating message of moral slackness, and the potential for conquest.84 Job capitalized 77 J.

Stamm, Gavarni and the Critics, Ann Arbor, [1979], 1981, 44. 79 The author of this image was identified as Gavarni in ibid., pl. 3. 80 As Mitchell, 1991, notes (p. 4) as a way of indicting the widespread appearance of the cigarette as a sign for (transgressive) female sexuality, Emile Zola linked smoking with the sexual drive of the courtesan in Nana. 81 See A. Brenna, "Hans Jaegers fengselfrise," St. Hallvard, 1972, 238-266. 82 T. Aslaksby, Hans Heyerdahl 1857-1913, exh. cat., Modum, Stiftelsen Modums Blaafarvevaerk, 1981, 88. 83 The British "cigarette cards" were perhaps the ultimate form of this linkage within the arena of commerce, replacing the thin white cylinder of the cigarette with the form of a woman. 84 Mitchell, 1987, 31, and 1991, 4, points out that the cigarettes in Mucha'sJob posters represent the female appropriation of male sexuality.</page><page sequence="13">EDVARD MUNCH'S SELF-PORTRAIT WITH CIGARETTE 639 (iiCortt _i i __iiii iii :~_i~i~ -:ii~ a::ii .............................................. :_: :: :-: .:. ::-- :: ::;-;-:- :-:::::-:: i :- : - --::--:::: ::: :: :-:: :--:::----- :--:-::-: 10 Anonymous engraving after Pialli, "La Lorette," from de Kock, La Grande Ville.

The cigarette as a trope for female sexuality was reflected in satirical literature of the turn of the century. In an homage to the cigarette of 1906, the satirist John Bain, Jr. reflected this gender-specific association: "There are times in most men's lives when a warm, manly grip is hungered for; and there are moments, too, when naught but the tender, quieting touch of fair fingertips can fill the need. And so have there come hours to you and me . . when ... we would feel the gentle influence of some mild and soothing frankincense.

"85 An 1896 ode to the cigarette by Georges Lorin performed at the Com6die Frangaise more explicitly sexualized the cigarette: "The cigarette is day and night like a kiss of arousal."86 Yet while the cigarette was cast in a feminine role, and while women accounted for the majority of the labor force in cigarette-rolling factories, women were, of course, generally Hosten er kommen.

The female smoker was defeminized by the cigarette while, at the same time, she was deeply sexualized. Her sexuality was, however, reconsti- tuted according to "masculine" modes of sexual conduct- the active, aggressive, and public display of the sexual self. Conversely, the male smoker was feminized by his cigarette, the slender cylinder functioning as a sign for his displaced phallus. Such readings of gender transgressions were central to theories of criminology, such as Cesare Lombroso's popular studies,89 which identified the feminized male and the masculinized female as archetypal criminals and social deviants. They were also, as Emmanuel Cooper suggests, deeply implicated in the concept of Decadence.90 Such shifting gender significations seem to have excluded the middle-class male and female. As numerous social commentators had observed,91 it seems that only the upper and lower classes were identified with cigarette smoking, and with its attendant deformities and deviancies. The presence of the cigarette, therefore, seems to have negated an other- wise middle-class identity on the part of the smoker in the 1880s and nineties. Like the confusion of middle-class male identity signaled by the cigarette, bourgeois female identity was nullified by the masculinizing cigarette. It is perhaps precisely for this reason that women artists who forged bohemian identities for themselves, smoked, and represented themselves smoking, cigarettes.92 The Norwe- gian painter Oda Lasson, mentioned earlier as a model for both Krohg and Munch, was, according to all accounts, a constant and public cigarette smoker. Her younger sister, Bokken Lasson, reported that cigarette smoking was a kind of trademark of Bohemian culture in the later nineteenth century, but that it held special meaning for the female Bohemian. Lasson recalled her affiliation with the "Kristi- ania Boheme"-sitting with her artist friends and smoking cigarettes: It was, of course, revolutionary that young women and men went out and drank wine and smoked cigarettes together until the early hours of the morning.

Lathion, National Gallery) bouts of tap-room apathy, almost masculine in their brazenness, killing time with cigarettes. .. .95 The tension that these women generated between their intellectual aspirations and their public assumption of devi- ant behavior defined the social space within which they could operate as independent women and creative artists. The dangers associated with the cigarette-both social and medi- cal-tallied with the Bohemian rhetoric of self-annihila- tion.96 In this case, the smoking of a cigarette suggested a new definition for bohemian womanhood. Engaging in masculine social rituals, the Bohemian woman insinuated herself into other masculine spaces as well. Munch's Norwe- gian colleague at the Berlin caf6 "Zum Schwarzen Ferkel," Dagny Juel Przybyszewska, like other women who defined themselves as Bohemian intellectuals, created a mythos around herself that was rooted in that tension. One of her colleagues described her as "a singing angel-an angel with a cigarette in her mouth. She even smokes in a nearly ethereal way, and small, heavenly rings float like a halo around her lips."97 Creating an image of herself that devi- ated from norms of feminine beauty, Przybyszewska asserted her independence through the assumption of an attribute that defied rigid social labeling. By 1880, cigarettes had assumed a special cultural signifi- cance in Scandinavia. In that year the Danish author and critic Herman Bang, soon to be recognized as one of Europe's leading exponents of literary Decadence and of homosexual literature, published an essay on tobacco in the Copenhagen newspaper, The National Times, in which he wrote: Cigarettes are here at home on their way to being modern.... Moreover, cigarettes have something of a myth about them, a myth about French sophistication, boulevards, and night caf6s. Cigarettes are dissolute, less homely, more chic, most of all, more French [than cigars]. When a young [Dane] smokes a... cigarette, he portrays himself as a kind of Parisian, more of a Dandy and more of a sophisticate. For older people, the cigarette represents ... unfortunate importations of foreign amorality, but for the young they are a welcome dose of the same medicine.98 Thus while cigarettes blurred class and gender distinctions, they also separated radical youth from the older keepers of the status quo. Christian Krohg's 1885 portrait of the dandified painter Gerhard Munthe (Fig. 14), who holds a cigarette, juxtaposed with the aging, conservative, cigar- smoking seascape painter Reinholdt Boll, seated at the lower left, embodies such a message. Bang also associated the cigarette with visionary experi- ences. Perhaps because of its ephemeral nature as a sub- stance of pleasure, in comparison to the substantial bour- geois cigar or pipe, Bang claimed, "One can meditate with a cigar, but one can find inspiration with a cigarette. The cigarette and fantasy are the same."99 Second sight, reverie, and even hallucination were associated with the cigarette in part because of its popularly understood origins in Turkey and in European colonial possessions.100 A one-act drama performed in Paris in 1878 entitled La Cigarette capitalized on these Exoticist and Orientalist associations. In it, a wealthy woman, desirous of marriage, is assisted by her exotically clad Javanese maid, Tch6rita, who provides spe- cially rolled cigarettes ("as in her homeland") which compel their smokers to reveal their innermost secrets.101 The 95 C.

Such rhetoric characterized the literature of "Decadent" movements throughout Europe and in the United States. Cigarettes were identified as "implements of Decadence" in the May 28, 1892 issue of The Mahogany Tree, an idea elaborated upon in the July 9, 1892 issue: "We have sung the praises of cigarettes and coffee, not for themselves alone, but because they stand for a mood opposed to that prevailing one of our times which turns life into an express train and makes old men at forty."

The environment of mystery and inspiration that surrounded the cigarette was later evoked by the poet Sigbjorn Obstfelder, Munch's associate and supporter. In Obstfelder's poem entitled "Cigarettes," the smoking of a cigarette becomes the conduit for reverie, "the braiding of dreams."'12 As the poem indi- cates, there was an element of risk present in the intellectual release associated with cigarettes. A shift in the perception of tobacco, and in the symbolism of smoking, arose with the increased popularity of cigarettes in the late nineteenth century. By the 1890s, health threats posed by tobacco, and the evils engendered by smoking, were known by the general public. It was widely rumored that cigarettes contained opium (as Oscar Wilde had indi- cated),'03 and that commercially produced cigarette papers were treated with arsenic in the bleaching process, making them especially deadly.'04 As early as the seventeenth cen- tury a Dutch medical treatise warned against the addictive properties of tobacco,'05 and by the late nineteenth century, this concern was heightened by the belief that smoking contributed to a loosening of morals, and to a loss of social and physical control. One of the strongest indictments of tobacco, Henry Gibbons's Tobacco and Its Effects, first pub- lished in New York in 1868, then in England and Germany in the mid-1870s, became one of the most widely read authori- tative guides to the illnesses both to body and to body politic associated with tobacco. According to another prevalent theory, smoking was linked specifically with insanity. In a publication of 1892 entitled Tobacco, Insanity and Nervousness, Dr. L. Bremer stated that "the majority of the insane smoke,"'06 and determined that tobacco had initiated their condition. At the turn of the century, a French physician even reported a case of"hysterie tabagique"'07 in a medical journal. A popular moralizing headline of the period, "Gone Insane from Cigarette Smoking," points to the special threat that cigarettes were believed to pose. It was reported that "the cheapness and easy acquisition" of cigarettes made them especially danger- ous as agents of corruption, and "the action of cigarette smoke on the nervous system is totally different from that of the cigar." By virtue of inhaling, "the adult victim in time becomes fidgety and cranky, sometimes barely able to move along the narrow strip of the borderline of insanity."'08 According to such models, the cigarette itself functioned as a signal of the disease and the inevitable mental deterioration to follow. By the 1880s, the cigarette served as a sign for social deviancy and insanity in popular culture. It was reported, for example, that in F. C. Burnand's burlesque Bluebeard, produced in London, a young man smoked cigarettes on stage as a way of identifying his aberrant mental condition to the audience.109 Other social and physical ills were attributed to tobacco consumption. Additional diseases linked to smoking at the time included a dimming of sight, appetite loss, diminished lung capacity, and "a weakening or destruction of the functions of the sex organs.""'1 So strong was the evidence that the Societe contre l'Abus du Tabac was founded in the early 1880s to combat actively the threat against the moral- ity, hygiene, and stability of French society posed by to- bacco."' In its publication of statutes and regulations, the society quoted Balzac as saying, "Le tabac detruit le corps, attaque l'intelligence et hebete les nations." This was the underlying assumption of the organization, that bodies both physical and political were under siege by tobacco abuse. A publication of 1889 that received a prize from the Societe examined one particular aspect of this problem. Maurice Fleury's Des effets du tabac sur la santi des gens de lettres, de son influence sur l'avenir de la litterature franfaise examined the degeneration of French intellectual culture due to poisoning from tobacco. Following the line of reasoning that artists, by virtue of their refined nerves, are inherently more suscep- tible to artificial stimulation, Fleury described the special danger posed by tobacco to authors. Presaging Nordau's pathology of modern art in Degeneration, Fleury and his colleagues forged links between recent developments in art and the medical sciences. This assumption was confirmed by Cesare Lombroso, who provided a list of "insane geniuses" who "have been excessive in their abuse of stimulants and intoxicants," including Baudelaire, who "abused opium, tobacco, and wine." He concluded, "Nearly all of these great men ... showed anomalies of the reproductive functions.""112 Such associations were acknowledged by artists and au- thors as well. The pathology of smoking seems to be built into the program of Symposzum, 1894 (Fig. 15), by Munch's colleague, the Finnish painter Akseli Gallen-Kallela. The painting depicts members of the nationalist circle of intellec- tuals who identified themselves as "Young Finland," a group dedicated to the restructuring of Finnish art. In the tradition of seventeenth-century Dutch "Smoking Company" pictures, such as William Buytewech's Merry Company of 1620-23, but 102 Quoted in Schulerud, 69. 103 See n. 70.

Private collection (photo: Helsinki, Central Art Archives) perhaps closer in spirit to William Hogarth's satirical print, Midnight Modern Conversation of 1734, Gallen-Kallela poses himself on the left with the composer Oskar Merikanto, who has passed out on the table, and two other composers, Robert Kajanas and Jean Sibelius, positioned in various stages of inebriation on the right half of the canvas. A giant sphinx, the product of a mass hallucination, flies off to the left. The still life of empty bottles and half-empty glasses, and the smoldering cigarettes held absent-mindedly by two of Finland's self-identified leading intellectuals, attest to the artificially induced states of hyper-awareness that led to the group vision. The apex of the carefully constructed, pyrami- dal still-life composition points toward Kajanas's cigarette, emphasizing its centrality, literally and figuratively, in the painting. In turn, the cigarette serves as the point of intersection between the material world, as represented by the still life, and the visionary world of the abstract back- ground and the truncated wings of the sphinx: the smoke drifting from this cigarette flows into, and seems to form, the red-tinted cloud that enframes Gallen-Kallela's self-portrait and partially obscures the moon in the fabricated back- ground landscape. Thus the cigarette smoke provides the medium of transportation for the group of inspired, pallid, inebriated artists. Gallen-Kallela's carefully rendered inven- tory of still-life objects points the way to, and interrelates with, the visionary imagery surrounding the artists. In such a painting, the cigarette must be understood as a vehicle for the aberrant visionary experiences that provide the thresh- old for the new anti-Naturalist program in the arts. It is also a sign of resistance to the safety of middle-class norms-it is unhealthy, it is urban, it may contain opium, and, counteract- ing the effects of alcohol, it is a stimulant. As this image suggests, in caf6 society at the turn of the century, tobacco consumption was the natural corollary to alcohol consumption, and alcohol consumption was the natural conduit to the dual acts of dissolution and creativity. In the visual arts, this coupling was used to suggest the linkage of moral and physical decay and intellectual rigor, one aspect of the program of Decadence. The images that Munch created of the "Kristiania Boheme" (Fig. 7) position that society specifically within this tradition. Such an associa- tion between tobacco and dissolution was built into other of Munch's images of himself and the authors with whom he associated in Kristiania in the 1880s and Berlin in the 1890s. This is certainly the case with Self-Portrait with Cigarette.

Oslo, Munch Museum (photo: Museum) Munch's lithograph of the same year, Self-Portrait with Skeleton Arm,1" in which the artist's image is allied with death through the device of the skeletal arm which forms a macabre decorative border at the bottom of the composition. Likewise, in related images of the writer Stanislaw Przybys- zewski from the mid-1890s (Figs. 16 and 17), Munch seems to represent a cigarette and a skeletal arm as alternative symbols for the linkage between the artist's creative faculties and degeneration. In accordance with the Decadent aes- thetic ideal, Munch represented himself, and Przybyszewski, as the byproducts of an ebbing life force, and chose as his emblems the artificial stimulants that induced and repre- sented the strong nervous sensations that they cultivated. The decadent physical characteristics with which Munch chose to endow himself in Self-Portrait with Cigarette-the thin, dissolving body, the sallow skin--challenged Norwe- gian ideas of normalcy and health. His self-representation as a Bohemian or Decadent placed him at odds with his aesthetically and socially conservative homeland, and identi- fied him with the Bohemian circle in which he had partici- pated in Kristiania and Berlin,114 milieux dedicated to the cultivation of self-analysis through the abnegation of a "normal" social environment. In this light, Munch's Self- Portrait with Cigarette is an image of youth in rebellion against social and aesthetic norms, and in rebellion against regional and national orthodoxies. The cigarette featured in this T.A A .,M 17 Munch, Stanislaw Przybyszewski with Skeleton Arm. ca. 1895, tempera on canvas, Oslo, Munch Museum (photo: Museum) painting, bearing associations with Parisian urbanism, youth, dissolution, and a blurring of economic, gender, and social boundaries, forms an essential part of Munch's iconography of Decadence and of Bohemianism in the 1890s. By virtue of this self-image, Munch proclaimed his rejection of middle- class values and assumed for himself the role of social outsider. It is precisely this image of the artist as outsider that made Munch's work vulnerable to attack by such critics as the medical studentJohan Scharffenberg in 1895. Exhibited in a year in which the Kristiania press had been especially attentive to the potential social harm of the Decadent program, Munch's paintings fueled the ambitions of the opponents to Decadence. By enlisting Christian Collin's restrictive definition of the moral role of art in society, Max Nordau's reductive understanding of Decadence and degen- eration, and his own nascent medical views,115 Scharffenberg could effortlessly pose Munch as an enemy of social health and stability. As a sign of such discord, Munch's cigarette was specifically apprehended and commented upon by at least one observer. The satirical magazine Vikingen published a cartoon (Fig. 18) shortly after Munch's exhibition in Kristiania opened on 113 Heller, 1984, 153. 114 W. Rasch, "Literary Decadence.

In the center of the upper register, accompanied by the legend, "A Loving Woman Who Loves Tobacco," the sexually potent Madonna has been transformed into the image of a woman puffing energetically on the cigarette that has migrated from Self-Portrait with Cigarette. In addition to the satirical denigra- tion of both paintings that has occurred through this graft- ing, two significant cross-codings have been effected by the caricaturist. Because the cigarette was a trope for prostitu- tion, its inclusion transforms Munch's image of a libidinous, earth-bound Madonna into the image of a prostitute, thus twisting and extending the sexual reading of the painting. Moreover, the artist, no longer present bodily in the carica- ture, has been reduced to a sign-the cigarette-that has been transposed into a feminine realm. The caricaturist's feminization of the artist and repositioning of Madonna's social identity were made possible by the multivalent associa- tions that the cigarette held in the mid-1890s. Artists' self-portraits often present staged images of care- fully constructed selves. These images engage or explore assumed personae, and, as Richard Brilliant suggests, fre- quently confront their audience with the problem of dually registering likeness and fiction.116 Self-Portrait with Cigarette is such a work. Viewers such as Scharffenberg understood Munch's depiction of his bohemian persona not as an exercise in the social construction of the self, but as an unmediated representation of physical degeneration. For less literal observers, the self-portrait provided not a diagno- sis, but a formula. Balanced between the bourgeois and the Decadent, between marginality and control, sensuality and abnegation, Munch declared his affiliation with a program- matic amorality in 1895. Assisted by popularly understood sociological and medical theories of degeneration and decay, Munch, condemned by the same theories, predicated his identity on a smoking cigarette. Patricia G.
