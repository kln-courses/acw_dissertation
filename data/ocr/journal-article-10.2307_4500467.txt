<plain_text><page sequence="1">London, St Pancras Church: Francis Pott's 'The Cloud of Unknowing' Francis Pott's The Cloud of Unknowing - an epic piece of 80 minutes' duration, evoked a spontane- ous standing ovation from a discerning audience at its world premieire by the Vasari Singers at St Pancras Church, opposite Euston station, on 13 May 2006. Akin in style to Britten's immortal War Requiem, but with organ in place of orches- tra, the work's emotive, apocalyptic vision defies analysis, so broad is its scope in terms of place,</page><page sequence="2">FIRST PERFORMANCES 61 time, and cultural orientation. Though in fact written in 2005 and originally dedicated 'to the memory of Margaret Hassan and all innocent life lost in Iraq and beyond', the work took on a new meaning when, as the composer describes in his programme notes, just 24 hours after conductor Jeremy Backhouse phoned him to say the premieire would be in St Pancras Church some time in 2006 'a bomb detonated on a bus (Tavistock Square, 7/7/05) brought carnage to the very steps of that building'. The work opens with a sombre organ introit, delivered at the premiere by Jeremy Filsell, increasing in intensity over several minutes, building up to the choir's ominous entry: 'There where the sun first dwelt', the words translated from an heroic elegy by the Greek poet Odysseus Elytis. Pott draws on a variety of sources 'of periods and original tongues (in translation) both sacred and secular', and he describes his central figure, the tenor soloist (sung by James Gilchrist) as: 'an anthropomorphic presence, part Christ, part Everyman'. In his very opening stanzas, the tenor sets the scene of foreboding with the words: 'Now as though God were sighing, a shadow lengthens ... something evil will strike'. The prescient nature of this phrase - written some months prior to 7/7, as was most of the work - intoned in this quiet church at the premiere, just round the corner from Tavistock Square and directly opposite Euston station, took the audience almost 'outside time' in its impact. Later, again in the solo tenor part, Pott (like Britten) uses Wifred Owen's: 'I am the enemy you killed, my friend', followed by - likewise meditating on the sheer futility of war - 'The dead are all on the same side' (R6n6 Arcos). Using the lyrical flow of the choir, punctuated by solemn intoning from solo tenor, with sombre organ interludes and undulating accompaniment catching the mood of the text, Pott has managed to employ an accessible style whilst introducing dark harmonies, rich textures, dramatic contrast, often with an insistent crescendo of key motifs, to keep the audience constantly on their toes. It is unusual for a choral work of this length, with quasi-religious overtones, to receive such rapt attention throughout, and evoke such in- depth emotional response from performers and audience alike. My first introduction to this piece was hear- ing a short peaceful extract from it: 'The Lord is my Shepherd' sung at the Vasari Singers' 25th Anniversary concert at St John's Smith Square in May 2005. As Port explained to me on that occa- sion it would appear better in context at the world premiere of the complete work, when the fury of the 'Armegeddon' that surrounds it in the full text is revealed. The use of women's voices alone to add poignancy to maternal mourning, following the noise of battle, and this quiet interlude of the 23rd Psalm, are examples of how Pott manages to embrace the horrors of war, but also plumb musi- cally the depths of its aftermath, across the cho- ral palette. Vasari's conductorJeremy Backhouse, renowned for inspiring vivid, passionate perform- ances, rose to the occasion with customary verve. This prescient war-torn oratorio should enter the repertoire as an apt epic of our time. Jill Barlow</page></plain_text>
