<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS In Face of Mystery: A Constructive Theology. Gordon Kaufman. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1993. 509 pages. $40.00. (Reviewed by Robert Cummings Neville, Boston University.) In Face of Mystery fulfills the hope of many theologians for a systematic theology that is empirical in the most sophisticated sense and truly liberal in its orientation. It follows in the general tradition of the Chicago School of empirical theology and bears many affinities, both in program and conclusions, to the thought of Henry Nelson Wieman and John Dewey. But the Chicago School has often combined a kind of naive empiricism reading religious stuff off of experience with a mind-bending preoccupation with methodology, neglecting the dialectical and critical middle-ground where a theology needs to find justification. Kaufman, by contrast, supplies the middle ground while improving on the methodological sophistication. He abandons naive religious realism completely in favor of an updated critical Kantian constructivism. Who would have thought that the nearly century-long Chicago project would be brought to fruition by a Yale graduate whose Systematic Theology, preceding this volume by a quarter-century, was widely regarded as American Barthianism? In Face of Mystery is a splendid book, the best empirical, liberal systematic theology, I believe, and perhaps the last. Kaufman divides the book's careful argument into five parts. The first is an exposition of the theological method of imagination construction he has developed in previous works. Pointing out that theology has always taken place in a socio-cultural context, each context itself being a modification of previous imaginative constructions, Kaufman describes theology in every period as the ongoing attempt to make sense of life's basic elements. Theology in our time thus imaginatively reconstructs our ancestral images to meet the needs of contemporary life. Contemporary theology, most particularly, must find life's meaning in a world interpreted also by science, which was not a problem for the theologians at Nicea. The most significantly "Uberai" of Kaufman's claims is that theology is not intended to refer to independent realities such as God. Yet Christian theology can appeal to the ancestral images of the absolute and transcendent creator of the universe to make sense of the encompassing mystery that appears behind everything. The appeal to God can also be used to make sense of the ultimate claims on our moral behavior that are part of the Christian</page><page sequence="2">328 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy worldview, providing fondamental orientations for human practice. The hedging of transcendent reference and the tendency to let predetermined ethical commitments determine theological conclusions express Kaufman's liberalism. His trenchant and repeated appeals to mystery, however, constitute an important counter-thrust, a memory, perhaps, of Barth. Part is Kaufman's modern theological anthropology, emphasizing biology, moral claims, the importance of self-consciousness, subjectivity, freedom, responsibility, and how issues such as ecological concerns require a reordering of the human agenda Kaufman's understanding of human nature draws much from John Dewey, particularly Human Nature and Conduct. Part constructs a concept of the world as the context of human existence. The world, in Kaufman's view, has no intrinsic purpose nor is it for human Ufe in any special sense. Rather it is the outcome of serendipitous natural processes, set off perhaps by the Big Bang. But Kaufman recommends for Christian theology the taking of six "small steps of faith" (outlined in a chart on 287), each so innocuous as not to offend a folly modern sensibility but cumulatively adding up to Christian faith in God. The first step is to commit ourselves to thinking through a responsible position on "ultimate questions about Ufe, death, and reality" (244). The second is to opt for a view of the world as evolutionary and historical, with a serendipitous place for human life, rather than a view of the world as mere physical structure and order which is also compatible with the scientific facts. The third is to take note of the fact that serendipity manifests creativity, that is, the development of the new. In the human context this novelty gives rise to the achievements of human responsibility and civilization. Fourth, from this it is but a small step of faith to see the serendipitous creativity of the universe as setting a trajectory toward (among other things) the human and humane. The fifth step is to summarize the imaginative riches of the Christian concept of God as the ground for humanization in those creative serendipitous forces; God is the mystery behind or in those cosmic forces that make human culture and morality possible. The sixth step is to take Jesus Christ to be the key both to normative humanness and humaneness and to the nature of God as the sum of humanizing forces. The fourth part of the book develops the concept of God as an ultimate point of reference, not as a being or ground referred to by the theological concept but rather as a way the humanly creative cosmic processes</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 15, No. 3, September, 1994 329 are to be understood in the life of faith. With this concept of God, Kaufman argues, we can understand sin and evil and our own responsibility. The Christian understanding of Jesus Christ provides the character content for this, although God is not to be understood as a person in any traditional way. Part Five draws out the implications of this view of God for the practice of Christians in their churches. Readers trained in philosophy will be struck that Kaufman calls theology so much of what others would call philosophy. As mentioned, the anthropology, the ethics, and much of the epistemology in this book are extremely similar to the philosophy of John Dewey, which, for this reviewer, is largely to the good. On the critical side, several questions need to be raised about this book, however, beginning with some Dewey would raise himself The first Deweyan point addresses Kaufman's strategy of avoiding a large leap of faith by taking several small steps of faith, each of which seems unobjectionable though gratuitous. Dewey would reverse the argument and point out that the danger in small steps of gratuitous commitment is their cumulative consequence, namely a great unwarranted fiction laid upon the evidence. The evidence in fact is that creative serendipity is countered by destructive serendipity. Although we are not in a position to assess proportions of creativity and destruction, cosmic entropy drags pain, dissolution, and frustration of promise in its wake. The only reason to pursue humanness and humaneness, Dewey would say, is that they are the local human goods. While avoiding supernatural references, Kaufman slips into the chief fault of what Dewey would call supernaturalism, namely, dependence on the fictional crutch that cosmic forces eventually aid the human endeavor: greater realism about expanding gasses is required. Dewey's second point would be to qualify Kaufman's epistemology. Dewey would say that concepts are valid to the extent that the things they represent have the traits the concepts attribute to them, taking into account the respects in which the concepts interpret their objects and the qualifications introduced by human biology, culture, semiotic systems, and purposes. Truth, said Dewey, is warranted assertibility in the sense that behavior shaped by the concepts engages the relevant objects and is corrected and reenforced in the engagement. Now Kaufman says (334) that "our religious symbolism is not valid in its own right, but only to the extent that it represents, and thus reinforces, those cosmic and historical tendencies and forces which are moving</page><page sequence="4">330 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy us toward further humanization." But does he not have it backward? Religious symbolism on Kaufman's interpretation, because it chooses to refer only to those cosmic and historical tendencies that agree with it, could only be valid "in its own right." If religious symbolism were meant to be truly referential, it would have to refer to all cosmic and historical tendencies and forces, and adjust itself to represent the terrible, wicked, and destructive movements as well as the humanizing ones. Dewey would link this to his first point, that labeling only benign forces as divine distracts us from a realistic assessment of the human ethical task, which might demand that we press for goodness in face of powerful and eventually overwhelming cosmic forces of destruction and decay. Kaufman's constructions leave out the evil and tragic as not being religiously constitutive, and treat them merely as forces to be opposed. The third criticism, concerning Kaufman's metaphysics, moves away from Dewey*s orientation. To talk about world, humanity, God, and Christ as Kaufman does is to suppose some traits about what reality consists in. Metaphysical hypotheses articulate these and allow for criticism, Kaufman would agree. Since the beginning of the Christian era, if not from the time of the prophets, theology has been driven by the dialectic of the greatness of God to identify God with the whole, the most real, or the source of all things. That sense of greatness in God is the source of worshipfulness, as Anselm argued. Kaufman argues that the concept of God as creator is no longer plausible; but he fails to identify God with the whole of the metaphysical traits he cites, which include cosmic forces that do not tend toward greater humanization. Kaufman's affiliation of God with the forces of goodness alone is too small, even on his own reading of the metaphysics of the cosmos. Fourth, Kaufman's metaphysics of natural tendencies fails to pick up on the issues of the radical contingency of all nature. As Stephen Hawking wrote (at the end of A Brief History of Time), "the usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe." Following in a long tradition, Hawking suggests that a God might be needed to create the universe. Kaufman declines to answer this important theological question. He objects that this would entail that God exists outside the created universe. On some conceptions of God, his objection would hold. But it does not hold</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 15, No. 3, September, 1994 331 on the model of creation ex nihilo so central to the Christian tradition : God is the creator of place, time, and difference. Fifth, Kaufman's strategy of telling the story of the anthropomorphic origins of the idea of Yahweh obscures the fact that subsequent thinkers conjured with the obvious objections. They developed theories according to which the anthropomorphic expressions of God as rock, personal agent, and subjective consciousness are given metaphoric validity within certain limited contexts. The God of Origin and Augustine who creates time itself, or the Act of Esse of Thomas Aquinas, are not anthropomorphic conceptions, and yet they have been related richly to the symbolic Ufe of the Christian movement. Sixth, a crucial part of Christian theology, on a par with philosophical theology and cross-reUgion comparative theology, is church theology, namely, the reappropriation and reconstruction of the symbols and traditions of the church so that the cult of Jesus Christ can have a continued and better life today. Kaufman is so deeply apologetic for the failures of the church in the past that his theology expresses hostility to the institutions rather than reforming zeal. Does this not weaken his theology's connection with living religion that is required for balance and good taste in representing what Christianity is supposed to be? Seventh, the plot of Kaufman's argument seems externalizing and objectifying. This is tolerable in philosophical theology if it is kept at the abstract metaphysical level. It is inappropriate for comparative theology, however, where one must enter the hermeneutic circle, and also for church theology where, either in oneself or in those whom one trusts, one tastes the power of transforming love and salvation. As a Methodist this reviewer admits to his own overheated heart. But Buddhists too say enlightenment comes from the Buddha-mind within, Taoists say atonement comes from the power of the Tao to disregard our illusions, Jews and MusUms say salvation comes from God. Without relating to the fact that at least some of us are rehgious because God calls and prods us, as Christians say, Kaufman hasn't quite got the topic of religion in hand; perhaps his real topic is ethics to the exclusion of fiiUy formed theology. Having made these critical points, let it be said that Kaufman is absolutely and bril?antly right to put Christology near the end of the system adjacent to ecclesiology and after an interpretation of the human condition. He is right to insist that Christian theology address the contemporary world</page><page sequence="6">332 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy on its own terms, although perhaps the Christian gospel has some criticisms to make of those terms as well He is right to return the theological sphere to the context of nature, with the history construed as a part of nature. Kaufman is right in his ethics to see that grand schemes are mischievous and that progress is made by making our neighborhoods ever more humane. His interpretation of ecological matters on the model of causal patterns rather than global unities is exactly right. His emphasis on fallibilism and humility is wonderful. This is a great book of liberal theology. That I say it might be the last book stems from my fear that humanistic ethics might accomplish his purposes without the need for reimagining any religious symbols whatsoever. Only his continued appeal to mystery hedges this conclusion.</page></plain_text>
