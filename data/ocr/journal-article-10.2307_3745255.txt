<plain_text><page sequence="1">The chief merit of this book is that it faces clearly an issue of grave moment and offers a solution which, whether we assent to it or not, is at all events courageous and uncompromising. The aim, we are told in the Preface, is " to express definitely the consequences in ethics and religion of accepting the principle of evolution in philosophy." God and moral obliga? tion are necessities of thought, from which there is no escape; and it is fair to add that Professor Wildon Carr shows no desire to escape from either of them. But they must be justified on the ground, not of religious or moral experience, but of metaphysics. Professor Carr has no use for the outworn shibboleths of traditional theology. The God he has sought and claims to have found is not the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to whom Pascal appealed (p. 71), but the God of the philosopher, a God who is in harmony with the fullest scientific knowledge of these latter days. For it is the physical and biological sciences that furnish the data for the metaphysical synthesis. The sciences aim at an ideal of description which " invites interpretation," and it is " a philosopher's job " to respond to the invitation and offer a rational explanation (p. 19). We know from Professor Carr's previous writings, and especially from his Theory of Monads, the lines on 419</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES which he answers this requirement. The secret of the universe lies in the life-energy, manifested alike in material organization and in purposive activity, and presented to us on our planet as a process of creative evolution (p. 68). In this process " we have the one fact in our scientific survey of the cosmos which offers to us an analogy of what the universe in itself may be, the one fact which gives us the key to the construction of a metaphysic of existence. . . . It may seem too bold a generalization, but at least we can say that in life as we experience it we have a concrete, self-consistent reality on a limited plane which may be typical of the reality we try to conceive on a universal plane " (p. 69). Within the evolutionary process, revealed by science and interpreted by philosophy, moral standards and God must find their place. The door is bolted and barred against any intrusion of the timeless, the absolute, and the transcendent. The issue thus raised is undeniably a grave one; it involves a drastic transvaluation of ethical and religious values. The first four chapters, together with Chapters VII and VIII, present, in broad outline and with admirably lucid illustration, the situation created by the advance of the sciences during the last half-century. Professor Carr has a rare gift of simplifying for the general reader the results of highly complex inquiries and of throwing into relief their bearings on the meta? physical interpretation of Nature. For example, his sketches, modelled on Father Daniel's satirical Voiage du Monde de Descartes, of a journey through the Newtonian universe, and subsequently through that of Einstein, are delightfully illuminating. The situation is, naturally, explored in the light of the author's own philosophical system, discussion of which would carry us beyond the scope of this review. One point, however, appears to call for criticism. Professor Carr stresses the contrast between living organisms which are informed by a unifying activity, are self-changing, and bear their past within their present, and inanimate material objects which lack these characteristics and change without internal making or remaking (e.g. pp. 16, 40, 45); and follows Bergson in principle when he interprets this contrast as that of two movements, continuous but in different directions, the one an uprush, the other a descent, like the rising and falling water in Berkeley's image of the fountain (p. 31). The suggestion is that in inert matter we have the ddbris east off by the life-activity of the universe (p. 69). Is the antithesis as pronounced as Professor Carr maintains ? And is his hypothesis the only way of escape from a dualism of life and matter ? What if the so-called inanimate objects should prove to be akin to the organic ? This is the alternative recently presented by Dr. Whitehead, and it surely deserves serious consideration. Professor Carr asserts that " an atom of oxygen or of hydrogen or of carbon is not affected in any way by the fact that it enters into the structure of a living body. Its physical and chemical nature are the same whether its locus be my blood-stream or a glacier in the Himalayas " (p. 36). This is precisely what Dr. Whitehead denies in his doctrine of prehensive unification. " An electron," he says, " within a living body is different from an electron outside it, by reason of the plan of the body " (Science and the Modern World, p. iii). There is nothing in the passage of Nature that does not bear about it a past and a future, integrated with the present. If it were not so, the ascription of change in any sense to inanimate matter would be unintelligible. We should be left with mere addition or subtraction of material, constituting no change at all. We fear that Pro? fessor Carr, for all his grasp of the implications of modern science, has not swung wholly free from the fetters of " simple location " (see especially pp. 169-170). 420</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS In Chapters V (on " The God of Philosophers ") and VI (on ' Evolution and the Moral Law ") we come to grips with Professor Carr's main problem, of the requisite moral and religious revaluation. As far as ethics is con? cerned, the reconstruction is one of method rather than of conclusions. " The theory of evolution requires us to conceive our reason, and the moral law with all its meaning in the human mode of existence, as themselves the outcome of evolution. This is an entirely new standpoint for philosophy. It implies that the force expressing itself in evolution, the activity in itself which we identify with God, is super-rational and super-moral " (p. 103). Since the life-principle, though manifested only in individuals, uses them ruthlessly as a means and not as an end (pp. 107, 139), it follows that the ethics of evolution cannot be, what they were for Spencer, individualistic (p. 91). " There is not throughout the whole range of evolution the slightest indication that the individual satisfaction of individual cravings has any part whatever in the evolutionary scheme " (p. 106). Hence the rule of conduct prescribed is " the subordination of the individual to the general good." We are to work for " the ideal of a perfected humanity." " To realize this in our individual conduct and in our life purpose is, therefore, what I mean by the mind's intellectual love towards God " (ibid.). There is here nothing revolutionary, nothing that involves a radical revision of traditional, or even of Christian, ethics. The disturbing factor is that the conclusion does not appear to follow from the premisses. As the references to Kantian ethics imply, Professor Carr is anxious to justify the concept of moral obligation. But it is not easy to see how a life-principle which as super-moral is indifferent to man's ethical valuations can lend them sanction or authority. Purposive though it is said to be, its end is beyond our ken; and an unknown end can have no claim on our allegiance. Where is the guarantee that in serving our own species we are placing ourselves in accord with the life-activity of the universe ? For all we know, its eventual pur? pose may demand the extinction of the human race, as it has demanded that of so many other races in the course of its relentless march. " Vexilla regis prodeunt." Yes, but we know not whither; and how can we know the way ? Not only is the basis wanting for obligation, but the service of man and the intellectual love of God fall hopelessly asunder. The last-mentioned concept gives the clue to Professor Carr's proposed reconstruction of religion. For him, as for Spinoza, it furnishes the antidote to anthropomorphism. Till evolutionary philosophy proclaimed its saving message, men were self-enslaved to the gods they fashioned in their own image. There is a note of fine sincerity in Professor Carr's Lucretian de- nunciation of the atrocities committed in the service of the brutal idols of their imagination. He rides gallantly into the lists and throws down his gauntlet of challenge in the name of the new gospel. But there are weak spots in his armour that make us hesitate to predict his triumph. " Man is the only animal which has evolved codes of behaviour presuming the presence and influence of unseen spiritual forces, and invariably man has conceived those forces as cruel. The gods are naturally bloodthirsty" (p. 208). Is he not over-hasty in this wholesale condemnation ? " God," he writes again, " is not the potter fashioning vessels of clay, the father rejoicing in the return of the prodigal, the good shepherd, the righteous Judge, the ruler over spirits made perfect" (p. 85). There are indications here of features in the traditional religion of quite another order than those which form the staple of Professor Carr's anathemas. The teaching of Jesus of Nazareth and of the Buddha, to which he refers with just appreciation, tell a very different story from the holocausts of Mesopotamia and of Mexico 421</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES (pp. 208-9), and even, be it whispered, from those of the evolutionary process. For the God of evolution evinces a strong family likeness to the God of battles and of human sacrifice from whom he claims to Iiber ate us. The fact that he is unmoved by deliberate resentment hardly suffices to make him worshipful. If he has no malice, he has no benevolence (p. 78). " Like the God Saturn, evolution devours its own children " (p. 205). In? deed, as we read these passages, we are almost persuaded to feel indulgently towards the Fundamentalists of Tennessee. Professor Carr himself allows that " it may seem like mockery to suggest the possibility of a religious attitude towards a God so conceived " (p. 86), nor does the subsequent apologetic avail to efface this sinister impression. Here at least we have a first obstacle to Professor Carr's ideal of the intellectual love of God. But there is another, which, on the ground of metaphysical speculation, is even more serious. For Spinoza, the human mind had adequate knowledge of the infinite and eternal essence of God. Professor Carr's God is infinite indeed, but He is not eternal. The ends and operations of the life-principle are discernible up to the human level of evolutionary development, but not beyond. How can we love with intellectual apprehension that which lies beyond the grasp of our intelligence ? If, on the other hand, we are to love him as we know him, i.e. below and within human experience, how are we emancipated from anthropomorphism ? In his concluding chapter, Professor Carr looks to the poets, among whom he groups the great religious prophets, to reveal the vision of " the new Jerusalem." After all, he finds a refuge in the realm of human imagina? tion. To the question, where, then, is the God of philosophy ? he answers that metaphysics comes into play as a " cathartic " of the prophetic revela? tion. We catch here an unmistakable echo of Croce's famous distinction between aesthetic intuition and the logical concept as forms of theoretic activity. It may be questioned whether the philosopher-kings of Professor Carr's ideal society are likely to see eye to eye with the poetic visionaries in the task of framing the new theology. Plato had his good reasons for entrusting the former with exclusive sovereignty over the construction of religious myths. Nor is this admission of the creative function of imagination in strict accord with the maxim of Erigena prefixed to the opening chapter : Non alia est philosophia et alia religio. We are led back at every turn to the crucial problem of Professor Carr's philosophy, the problem of knowledge. He has many wise and illuminating things to say on the privileged position that man, as possessed of reason, holds in Nature; for example, in the treatment of the questions of personal survival (ch. ix) and of the freedom that ensues from man's unique capacity for intellectual detachment from his natural environment (ch. x). But it is not easy to reconcile his conclusions with the principle, maintained throughout, that " our rationality is the outcome of evolution." If reason in man be merely relative to a specific grade of development, a response " to the psychical disposition which evolution has created in us " (p. 180), how can it claim to give knowledge at all ? We can never know things as they are. " The intelligible world, like the sensible world, is a human world. It has no claim to exist absolutely " (p. 192). " No knowledge is absolute, or, what is the same thing, human knowledge is only absolute for man in the same sense in which canine knowledge is absolute for dog, ant knowledge or bee knowledge for ant or bee " (p. 125). Even the evolutionary process and the philosophical synthesis it provokes are but appearance; an appear? ance, moreover, which is accounted for by conditions that fall within itself. For all Professor Carr's valiant endeavour to obviate this paradox, our fate 422</page><page sequence="5">NEW BOOKS is that of the squirrel turning in its cage, the fate which inexorably awaits any metaphysics that strives to side-track Mind. We have not attempted to disguise our dissent from Professor Carr's main line of argument. ,But this in no way lessens our appreciation of the many merits of his book. It is full of the ripe learning and the speculative insight that we look for from a thinker of his distinction. The very fact that it frankly challenges accepted doctrines makes it unusually stimulating and instructive. It will appeal not only to those who are at one with the author in his view that the science of to-day demands a thoroughgoing reform of spiritual values, but to the wider public who desire to study from all sides the problem of the relation of philosophy to morals and religion. It deserves attention also from adherents of orthodox beliefs, who will do well to inform themselves of the difficulties besetting their position by reading a book whose reasoning is never captious or superficial, and which is inspired by a generous enthusiasm to furnish a stable intellectual foundation for devotion to the service of mankind.
