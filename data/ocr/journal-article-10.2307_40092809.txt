<plain_text><page sequence="1">* Elena Quiroga. La sangre. Barcelona. Destino. 1952. 361 pages. 50 ptas. ". . . los humanos se suceden como frutos de un mismo arbol." The characters likened here to the fruits of one tree are members of four generations of a family of landowners in pre-Civil War Spain. The story progresses with poetic delicacy to- ward a decline which is more the end of a way of life than the end of a particular line of hu- man sangre. There is, however, little of the stark pessimism of Zola or the feeling of decay found in Pardo-Bazan. In choosing a centenarian tree as narrator, the author (Nadal Prize, 1950) often belabors anthropomorphism. But the characters are alive and the reader - once he has accepted the tree's "personality" - will find himself compar- ing his sympathies and dislikes with those of the oak.
