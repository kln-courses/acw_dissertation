<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Waking Europa: Joyce, Ferrero and the  Metamorphosis of Irish History Salvatore Pappalardo  Rutgers University  In the “pre-history of Ireland,” an early section of Finnegans Wake, Joyce compiles a  Hiberno-Punic mythography through which he rewrites the rape of Phoenician Europa  as told by Ovid. Joyce believed that the Irish descended from Phoenician merchants, a  conviction that predisposed him to the early works of the Italian historian Guglielmo  Ferrero. Ferrero’s discussion of trading habits and sexual mores of the ancient Mediter- ranean population provided Joyce with historical insight upon which the author would  later elaborate in the reconstruction of a nebulous Irish past. The key to glossing the  “annals passage” is Joyce’s historic parallel between the Roman colonization of Phoenicia  and the English colonization of Ireland. The cultural politics of this poetic history aims  at the separation of Ireland from the Anglo-Saxon colonizer and its placement within  the context of a future United States of Europe. Keywords: James Joyce / Finnegans Wake / Guglielmo Ferrero / Phoenicians /  Ovid / Europe The influence that the Italian historian Guglielmo Ferrero (1871–1942) exerted on James Joyce has not been adequately assessed. This unfortunate state of affairs is largely due to the fact that Ferrero, once an internationally  known and respected intellectual, today remains a marginal, non-canonical fig- ure. The cultural and political ostracism imposed by the Fascist regime consigned  the liberal Ferrero to a historiographic oblivion from which he still needs to be  rescued. Another reason why we have not fully appreciated Ferrero’s influence  on Joyce is that the 1897 Europa giovane — for Joyce a crucial text he read with  abiding interest — was reprinted in a very few successive editions and has never  been translated into English. The initial success of Ferrero’s comparative study of  European mores was soon overshadowed by his more mature works such as Il Mil- itarismo (1898) and the monumental Grandezza e Decadenza di Roma (1902–1906).  Critics have associated Ferrero with Joyce’s positions on contemporary issues such  as anti-Semitism, militarism and socialism, shedding light on his imprint in Dub- liners, A Portrait and the construction of Bloom in Ulysses. While illuminating the  relationship between Ferrero and Joyce, critics have, however, generally failed to  </page> <page sequence="2"> Joyce, Ferrero and the Metamorphosis of Irish History 155 register at least two aspects: Ferrero’s influence on Joyce as a classical historian  and his background presence in Finnegans Wake. Ferrero’s influence was not only  immediate but also continuous throughout the literary activity of the Irish writer.  L’Europa giovane, in particular, stimulated in Joyce an enduring reflection about  what place Ireland should occupy in a modern Europe. In the course of this essay I argue that Joyce, combining Ferrero’s association  between militarism and sexual politics with the trope of a young Europe, rewrites  in the Wake’s “pre-History of Ireland” the rape of Europa as told by Ovid in the  Metamorphoses, moulding Jupiter’s ethnic rape of the Phoenician maid into a foun- dational myth for Ireland. In establishing a parallel between the Roman coloniza- tion of Phoenicia and the English colonization of Ireland, Joyce realizes the quirky  ethno-linguistic premise of his 1907 lecture “Ireland: Island of Saint and Sages,”  in which he argued that the Irish descended from Phoenician settlers. Joyce’s  poetic rewriting of Irish history exploits the intrinsic colonial subtext underlying  the tale of Europa’s rape. By means of this Hiberno-Punic mythography, Joyce  separates Ireland from its connection with the British Empire and places Irish  identity in a wider European context, one of “Iro-European ascendances” (FW  37.26). First, I will show how Ferrero’s discussions of Phoenician history informed  Joyce’s reception of the ancient population. Subsequently, my analysis will shift to  Ferrero’s L’Europa giovane. I then turn to Ovid’s rape of Phoenician Europa and  its textual metamorphosis in the Wake, where the episode reappears as a Viconian  ricorso in the “annals passage” (FW 13.33–14.15). Early FErrEro in latE JoycE Joyce was an enthusiastic reader of Ferrero,1 who was reaching his peak in popu- larity around the turn of the century. As a young and brilliant student, Ferrero was  taken under the wing of Cesare Lombroso, whose daughter Gina he eventually  married. Joyce became familiar with Ferrero’s works in Habsburg Trieste, where  the historian gave public lectures and published in the local newspaper.2 Despite  his popularity in the Adriatic city, where Ferrero enjoyed the friendship of many  leading intellectuals including Silvio Benco and Umberto Saba, the historian  caused much controversy in the recently proclaimed Italian kingdom. His early  works earned him a reputation, but drew much pugnacious criticism in conserva- tive circles. In their judgments, Italian intellectuals were quite unforgiving of Fer- rero’s critical attitude towards historical figures who were traditionally celebrated  as embodiments of political and national virtues. Julius Caesar, for instance, was  in the eyes of Ferrero more of a Machiavellian opportunist and the demolisher  of a republican tradition than a noble and shrewd statesman. Ferrero drew a par- allel between the socio-cultural and political decadence of the Roman Empire  and the contemporary crisis of Italian liberalism. The departure from traditional  interpretations of history was grounded in a novel methodological approach. He  believed that the positivist impulse to collect and categorize data necessitated  answering precisely formulated research questions and guiding hypotheses that  </page> <page sequence="3"> 156 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 34, Number 2 would bestow meaning upon an otherwise dry taxonomic classification of unre- lated historical events. The historian’s research agenda had to be grounded in  contemporary problems, since only the point of view of the present could offer  a functional key of interpretation for history. According to Ferrero’s philosophy  of history, the object of study should not be the analysis of distinct episodes but  the organic concatenation of these very events. This historiographic epistemol- ogy required an interdisciplinary approach, according to which the synergy of  political, economic and social factors could provide a deeper understanding of  historical transformations. In these years, Ferrero believed that Italy, in sharp contrast to the develop- ment of industrial capitalism in northern Europe, was still paralyzed by the  socio-political quagmire of “Caesarism,” by which he meant a corrupt society  founded upon militarism and an agricultural economy. Economic systems played  a significant role in Ferrero’s analysis of past and present, to the extent that even  his pacifism was informed by economic considerations. For the young and at this  point somewhat naïve historian, militarism was a phenomenon occurring mainly  in ancient and pre-industrial societies, in which waging war constituted a means  of accruing wealth. With the rise of industrialism, Ferrero argued, capital tended  to be channeled toward investments useful for the multiplication and improve- ment of technological equipment. Warfare was thus an anachronistic remnant  that would disappear with industrial development. Ferrero’s immediate success was accompanied by a manifold criticism. In  the eyes of his critics, Ferrero’s stylistic grace and narrative talent, necessary  tools in his reconstruction of past events, cast doubt on the scientific rigor of  his work. Methodological differences aside, Ferrero’s detractors were motivated  by political reasons. Leaning towards socialism at the beginning of his career,  Ferrero harshly criticized the colonial aggressiveness of the governments of the  conservative Crispi and their handling of the “southern question.” More generally,  Ferrero’s open criticism of national problems, his unflattering depiction of Italy  and his admiration of foreign role models were all positions that were difficult  to accept in a country that had gained independence a few decades before. Years  later, the proposal to institute a Chair in Philosophy of History at the University  of Rome, to be occupied by Ferrero, was adamantly opposed by many intellectu- als, amongst whom famously figured no less than Benedetto Croce. After the  advent of Fascism, Ferrero’s condemnation of Latin decadence, together with  his internationalism, earned him the status of persona non grata among officials  of the regime. Teaching history at a university was possible only abroad: in 1929  Ferrero accepted a professorship in Geneva. He died in his Swiss exile in 1942. By the time Joyce was lecturing at the Università Popolare in Trieste, he  might not have read Ferrero’s massive five-volume history of Rome in its entirety,  but certainly significant portions of it. In his lecture on Irish saints and sages,  Joyce’s early mention of Ferrero’s historical revisionism is a clear attempt to cap- ture the audience’s benevolence: “Ferrero now tells us that the discoveries of these  good German professors, as far as concerns the ancient history of the Roman  </page> <page sequence="4"> Joyce, Ferrero and the Metamorphosis of Irish History 157 republic and of the Roman empire, are mistaken from beginning to the end, or  almost” (“Ireland” 109). With a still somewhat shaky Italian, Joyce was hoping  to predispose an audience receptive to Ferrero. In fact, while Charles Vallancey’s  essay on the Phoenician origin of the Irish3 mainly informed Joyce’s linguistic  ethnography, Ferrero provided a fitting methodological paradigm. Joyce embraced  a revisionist history of the ancient world, claiming, just a few lines down from  his reference to Ferrero, a linguistic, ethnic and cultural continuity between the  Phoenicians and the Irish: This language [Irish] is eastern in origin and has been identified by many philolo- gists with the ancient language of the Phoenicians, the discoverers, according to  historians, of commerce and navigation. With their monopoly over the sea, this  adventurous people established a civilization in Ireland, which was in decline and  had almost disappeared before the first Greek historian took up his quill. It jealously  guarded the secrets of its science, and the first mention of the island of Ireland in  foreign literature is to be found in a Greek poem of the fifth century before Christ  in which the historian reiterates the Phoenician tradition. (“Ireland” 110)  Reminding his audience that the Phoenicians are credited with inventing the  alphabet, a writing system later adopted by the Greeks, Joyce asserts with this  “Orientalist” genealogy Ireland’s long-lost cultural prestige.4 However peculiar  this Hiberno-Punic ethnography may sound today, the notion of a Phoenician  origin represented an important topos in the cultural politics of Irish Revivalists,  invested in demonstrating ethnic otherness and cultural superiority with respect  to the English colonizer. The alleged Phoenician lineage of the Irish clearly pre- disposed Joyce to Ferrero, whose texts offered historical insights into Phoenician  mores. We have usually looked at Victor Bérard’s Les Phéniciens et l ’Odyssée as  the main source for Joyce’s knowledge of the Phoenicians. The close association  between Ferrero’s revisionism and Joyce’s discussion of the Phoenicians, however,  suggests that Ferrero contributed substantially to Joyce’s knowledge of the ancient  population. As is well known, Bérard’s work was influential in Joyce’s construction  of a modern Phoenician Odysseus. In parallel fashion, Ferrero provides Joyce with  the interpretative coordinates for another Phoenician character, young Europa. Ferrero never wrote a dedicated monograph about the Phoenicians, but he  believed that the origin of Western civilization was to be found not only in  the Greco-Roman tradition, but in the Phoenician thalassocracy as well. The  Punic wars of Rome, waged against the Phoenician colony Carthage, occu- pied an important section of Ferrero’s historical inquiry. Economic and cultural  exchange between the two populations dated back to early Roman history. In  the first volume of Grandezza e Decadenza di Roma, Ferrero maintains that early  Roman trade was exclusively entertained with the neighboring Etruscans and the  Phoenicians: “Perciò Roma comprava poco fuori: Ceramiche per le costruzioni  pubbliche e metalli in Etruria; ninnoli artistici, punici o fenici; gingilli di avorio;  profumi per i funerali e porpore per gli abiti da cerimonia dei magistrati; qualche  schiavo” (Grandezza I, 4) [“It was little enough, therefore, that Rome required  </page> <page sequence="5"> 158 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 34, Number 2 to buy from abroad: Terracottas for the decoration of her public buildings and  some imports of metal came in from Etruria, Phoenicia and Carthage, besides  ivory work and ornaments, perfumes for funerals, purple for the ceremonial  robes of the magistrates, and a few slaves” (Greatness I, 3)]. In Ancient Rome and  Modern America: a Comparative Study of Morals and Manners, Ferrero continued to  underscore the fundamental role of the Phoenician contribution to the Western  world. In his comparison between antiquity and modernity, the Italian histo- rian maintains that together with Roman militarism, Christian morality and  Greek philosophy, the Phoenician economy is one of the four founding pillars of  Western civilization: “In war, we fight like the Romans, and in peace, we turn  our eyes away from bloody spectacles. We should hold the gladiatorial games in  no whit less horror than the most pious of Christian monks. We trade like the  Phoenicians and we love knowledge like the Greeks” (112). Already in the much  earlier Il Militarismo — which Susan Humphreys identifies as a main source for  Joyce’s works — Ferrero attributes to Phoenician trade a primary role in ancient  Mediterranean civilizations: Il mercante fenicio sbarca sulla costa greca; trae dalla nave molte mercanzie del suo  paese e le espone sulla spiaggia: ecco allora dai villaggi vicini vengono donne e fan- ciulle a guardare, e intorno ai campioni di una industria più raffinata i primi bisogni  di un lusso più eletto nascono negli spiriti semplici dei barbari. (Il Militarismo 421) The Phoenician merchants landed on the Greek shores, took from their ships the  merchandise of their country, and exhibited it; then from the neighboring villages  came troops of women and girls to gaze at them, and through these samples of a  more refined industry, the desire for more luxurious things took birth in the minds  of the barbarians. (Militarism 299)  The Phoenicians were a Western Semitic maritime tribe, related to the Jews,  and famous for their commercial activities in the Mediterranean. Ferrero discusses  the establishment of colonies and trading posts, adding that, upon the merchants’  arrival, the first to inspect the foreign goods are “troops of women and girls” who  develop a “desire” for these luxury items. The semantic fields of militaristic lan- guage and sexual desire overlap in Ferrero’s description. Temptation and satisfac- tion of desire continue to frame this commercial transaction. The display of exotic  goods produces an inexorable drive to purchase: “poi tutti se ne sono invogliati e  hanno comperato, credendo di soddisfare senza danno un desiderio innocente. Ma  il sacco del mercante era inesauribile; ogni giorno ne usciva qualche cosa nuova,  qualche sorpresa più strana, e intorno ai nuovi oggetti le voglie resistevano sempre  meno alle tentazioni rinnovate” (Il Militarismo 422) [“until all bought a specimen,  thinking that they thus satisfied an innocent desire. But the merchant’s treasure- bag was inexhaustible. Every day he produced thence some new object, and the  temptation to indulge in them grew ever stronger” (Militarism 300)]. To Ferrero,  female sexual desire appeared as an economic drive regulating the contacts among  different populations in the ancient world. </page> <page sequence="6"> Joyce, Ferrero and the Metamorphosis of Irish History 159 The association between Phoenician sexual mores and ancient politics had  occupied Ferrero’s mind since the beginnings of his career. In Cesare Lombroso’s  seminal La donna delinquente: la prostituta e la donna normale, first published in  1893, Ferrero is listed as the co-author.5 In their interdisciplinary approach,  Lombroso and Ferrero divided up research topics according to their respec- tive competence and areas of specialization. Lombroso delineated the theoreti- cal framework, grounded in psychiatry and anthropology, whereas Ferrero was  responsible for the historic and juridical ramifications of their argument.6 In their  discussion of female criminology and prostitution, the authors make an excursus  into what they believe is the historical background of their object of investigation.  Ancient sexual customs entailed a tripartite socio-behavioral pattern, articulated  in secular, hospitable and sacred prostitution. The two latter forms of prostitution  were a phenomenon that could be observed in Phoenician culture: Secondo Erodoto, tra i Babilonesi le donne nate nel paese erano obbligate, una volta  almeno nella vita, ad andare al tempio di Venere, ed ivi abbandonarsi a uno straniero;  né potevano tornarsene a casa se prima qualche forestiero non avesse loro gettato  danaro sulle ginocchia e non le avesse invitate al coito fuori del luogo sacro: questo  danaro diventava sacro.  Tra i Fenici esisteva la prostituzione ospitale e sacra; essi, secondo le afferma- zioni di Eusebio, prostituivano le figliuole vergini ai forestieri a maggior gloria  dell’ospitalità. (Lombroso, Donna delinquente 220–21) According to Herodotus, Babylonian women were obligated to go at least once to  the temple of Venus and abandon themselves to a stranger; they were forbidden to  return home until a foreigner had thrown coins in their laps and invited them to have  intercourse outside the holy place. This money became sacred.  The Phoenicians practiced both hospitable and sacred prostitution. According to  Eusebio, they prostituted their virgin daughters to foreigners to demonstrate their  hospitality. (Lombroso, Criminal Woman 102)  Given Ferrero’s training as a classical historian and his specific interest  in Phoenician history, this passage can without any doubt be attributed to his  pen. Ferrero’s historical contribution to Lombroso’s study in criminology must  not have escaped Joyce, always eager to acquaint himself with Phoenician lore.  Motivated by a keen interest in the history of sexuality and sexual degeneracy,  Joyce was familiar with Lombroso’s theories, which partially intersected with  Ferrero’s early positions. In a letter to his brother Stanislaus dated 19 August  1906, Joyce indicates that he was aware of this close association between Lom- broso and Ferrero. At the time, Joyce was working as a foreign correspondent  in a bank in Rome and, while commenting on his unhappy residency in the  Italian capital, recounts an incident in the office: “I absorbed the attention of  the three clerks in my office a few days ago by a socialistic outburst. One of  them is a German and he was ridiculing Lombrosianism and antimilitarism.  . . . I think he was surprised not to find an ally in an Inglese” (SL 97). Joyce is  </page> <page sequence="7"> 160 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 34, Number 2 clearly defending the positions of Lombroso in close association with Ferrero’s  positions. l’Europa giovanE  Ferrero would later develop further this association between sexuality and mili- tarism in L’Europa giovane. In his study, the Italian historian maintained that the  male tradition of belligerent nationalism envisions sexual encounters as domi- nated by brutal violence and conquest instead of the courteous gallantry expected  by the female counterpart. Vincent Cheng and Dominic Manganiello have shown  how Joyce employed these ideas in Dubliners, particularly in “Two Gallants” and  “The Dead.” In addition, however, Ferrero maintains that this connection between  sex and war is particularly evident in the ancient world, where one can observe  in the sexual politics of rape a deep analogy to the imperial politics of conquest.  Examples in classical literature, Ferrero believes, support this argument. The  narrative nuclei of both The Iliad and The Odyssey associate sexual violence with  colonialism. The rape of Helen carries military and colonial implications, as it  becomes the reason (or excuse) for Greeks and Trojans to wage war against each  other. The quarrel over Briseis between Agamemnon and Achilles responds to  the same logic. By the same token, when Odysseus finally returns to Ithaca, he  has to fight the suitors who intend to usurp his nuptial bed along with his throne. Besides having an interest in the interlocking dynamics of sexual violence  and colonial politics, Joyce paid particular attention to Ferrero’s other lines of  argumentation. The Italian historian discussed Irish affairs, especially the case of  Parnell, within a larger, European context. Ferrero saw an affinity between Ital- ian and Irish emigration patterns (L’Europa 116), an affinity that complemented  Joyce’s opinion about similarities between the Irish claim to independence and  Irredentism in Trieste. Ferrero was a Dreyfusard and his pages on anti-Semitism  were conceived as an intervention in the debates around the Affaire. Joyce was  struck by Ferrero’s examination of Jewish identity contributing to a European  cultural transnationalism and the implicit assumption that anti-Semitic hatred  was one of the factors that made a more just Europe realizable only in the future.  Joyce elaborated the vital role the Jewish community played in the definition of  European identity later in the construction of Bloom. While Ferrero’s influence is recognized in Ulysses, traces of L’Europa giovane  in Finnegans Wake are generally not acknowledged. And yet a passage in the first  chapter of Ferrero’s study exhibits a paradigmatic character for the multilingual  explosions in the Wake. Ferrero starts his book with the unmistakable imprint of a  Nietzschean analysis. He claims that the success of many great statesmen — such  as Napoleon, Parnell and Bismarck — is to be found in what he calls the “law  of singularity” (5). According to Ferrero, the moral and intellectual character  of these leaders is different from that of the people they govern. As an example  illustrating this theory, Ferrero argues that one of the reasons for this difference  was the leaders’ mixed ethnic origin. European leadership is thus identified with  </page> <page sequence="8"> Joyce, Ferrero and the Metamorphosis of Irish History 161 Nietzsche’s mixed race, the “good European.” In particular, the “intellectual  exoticism” (17) of Bismarck’s writing style strikes Ferrero: E così questo fanatico patriota tedesco non fu mai, in lingua, un purista; anzi egli  mostra una inclinazione fortissima all’esotismo filologico, a mescolare il linguaggio  di motti e frasi straniere, specialmente francesi, non trovando spesso nella lingua  patria l’espressione acconcia per il suo nervoso e preciso pensiero. (L’Europa 17–18) Thus, this fanatic German patriot was never, with respects to language, a purist.  On the contrary, he shows a strong inclination to philological exoticism, mixing his  language with foreign mottos and phrases, especially French, since he often does not  find in his own language a suitable expression for his nervous and clear-cut thought.  (My translation)  Let me suggest that this passage may have functioned as a programmatic  incipit for the “philological exoticism” and multilingual structure of the Wake.7 It  is indeed very likely that Joyce’s own mixing of different languages, the constant  search for the mot juste, reflecting the expressive inadequacy of the very English  language in which the author is writing, owes much to Ferrero’s analysis of Bis- marck’s style. Although Joyce did not identify with the Prussian statesman, the  rhetorical strengths Ferrero ascribed to Bismarck must have appealed to Joyce. The  question of Joyce’s polyglot pastiche, I believe, needs to be addressed in the con- text of the writer’s formative years in Trieste. Joyce was surrounded by the Babel  of languages in the Adriatic city while he was reading Ferrero. John McCourt  has insightfully argued that the metamorphic language of Finnegans Wake can  be considered an amplified version of the Triestine dialect with its tendency to  incorporate all the languages of the empire.8 I accept McCourt’s idea that Trieste’s  multifaceted dialect struck polyglot Joyce, and would add that Ferrero’s passage  offered the writer an aesthetic and linguistic program to be realized in the Wake. In addition, one should not overlook the pregnant title of Ferrero’s study that  carries further political implications. Ferrero’s Europa giovane echoes Giuseppe  Mazzini’s 1834 movement Giovine Europa, in a gesture that represents an implicit  rehabilitation of the nineteenth-century intellectual and his advocacy for a Euro- pean political unification. After the proclamation of the Italian kingdom in 1861,  Mazzini’s democratic republicanism bequeathed monarchic post-unification Italy  with an uneasy legacy. Despite his zealous patriotism and indefatigable propa- ganda, Mazzini was branded an unwelcome antagonist, one to be excluded from  the secular pantheon of Italy’s founding figures. Both Mazzini and Ferrero were  advocates for a future Europe of federated democracies, and their allusion to the  young Europe of mythology is suggestive of an audacious political project, albeit  one still in its infancy. In Finnegans Wake, young Europe embodies one of the many semantically  cloaked and morphologically blurred dramatis personae of the narration. Fer- rero’s discussion of the interconnection between sexual violence and colonial  conquest in L’Europa giovane informs Joyce’s construction of the maiden. At the  </page> <page sequence="9"> 162 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 34, Number 2 very inception of the work, the semantic coordinates of young Europe oscillate  between geographic expression and fictional character. The opening lines intro- duce a seafaring Tristan, embarked upon a quest of dubious romance and warfare:  “Sir Tristam, violer d’amores, fr’over the short sea, had passencore rearrived from  North Armorica on this side the scraggy isthmus of Europe Minor to wielderfight  his penisolate war” (FW 3.4–6). Tristan’s epithet is indicative of an amorous viola- tor. Sexual violence is also suggested in the image of a recurrent (German wieder)  wielding of a penis, the male member brandished like a sword in battle. The Wake  constantly envisions the human body as an inscribable map, which makes it pos- sible to read “Europe Minor” as a geographic expression and its own personifica- tion at the same time. Europa’s oscillation between onomastics and geography  appears to be analogous to Homeric Greek and its “anthropomorphic interpreta- tion of Phoenician toponomy” (Gilbert 223) that Stuart Gilbert identifies in his  early commentary on Ulysses. In fact, while Europe indicates a young maiden in  Greek mythology, its etymology derives from the Phoenician term Ereb, “the land  of the setting sun,” thus indicating the West. Joyce was aware of the Phoenician  toponymic etymology of Europa: “The phaynix rose a sun before Erebia sank his  smother!” (FW 473.16) “Europe Minor” also indicates the region of Asia Minor,  associated with the expression “Phenicia or Little Asia” (FW 68.29) that occurs  later in the text. The expression also cues the maiden Europa as a transfiguration  of ALP/Issy/Iseult. In the text, the erotic tension between land and sea reaches its  climax in the archetypical violence perpetrated on Europe’s raped and colonized  body. In physical geography an isthmus is a thin strip of land in a larger body of  water that connects two territories. The “scraggy isthmus of Europe Minor,” the  place where the sexual warfare is waged, is evocative of Europa’s hymen, the very  locus of male sexual violence. The vestiges of a Phoenician origin of Ireland appear repeatedly throughout  the Wake. The ethnic and geographic distinctions between Ireland and Phoeni- cia are blurred and often undistinguishable. Tristan’s recurrent homecoming to  Dublin is a “return to the atlantic and Phenitia Proper” (FW 85.20). His vessel  re-emerges at later stages both as a “punic judgeship” (FW 90.36) and the “gran  Phenician rover” (FW 197.31). The alleged and undefined transgression of HCE  takes place in Phoenix Park and the protagonist is described as a “foenix culprit”  (FW 23.16), an ambiguous expression that puns on the Christian theological  concept of the felix culpa. In the economy of the text, the transgression in Phoenix  Park is a felicitous, albeit sinful, fault as it functions as a narrative catalyst. Ferrero’s Europa giovane materializes as Europe Minor, and returns in Shaun’s  vilification of his brother Shem. In describing his sibling “Shem Skrivenitch” (FW  423.15) Shaun says: “Then he caught the europicolas and went into the society  of jewses. With Bro Cahlls and Fran Czesch and Bruda Pszths and Brat Slavos”  (FW 423.36–424.1). The “europicolas” are an allusion to Ferrero’s work, but also a  pun on Il Piccolo, the Triestine daily newspaper in which the Italian historian, and  also Joyce, published a series of articles. The “society of jewses” mixes Jesuits and  Jews, pointing at the religious diversity of Habsburg Trieste. Shaun’s accusation  </page> <page sequence="10"> Joyce, Ferrero and the Metamorphosis of Irish History 163 of European internationalism is framed as an infectious disease, a syndrome that  makes Shem an outcast. Shem joins the “European family” (U 12.1202) presented  as an interethnic brotherhood. John McCourt has appropriately glossed this pas- sage, pointing out, among other things, Joyce’s reference to the complex and diffi- cult relationship with his brother Stanislaus, the first to recognize Joyce’s talent as  a writer. The prefixes “Fra-(n),” “Bro,” “Brud” and “Brat” are all variations on the  Indo-European root *bhră ́ ter, meaning brother. The expression “Fran Czesch” is  suggestive of the Italian francese and also Czech brother. “Bruda Pszths” and “Brat  Slavos” are a pun on a Slavic brotherhood and the Habsburg cities of Budapest  and Bratislava. rEwriting ovid To Ferrero, Ovid was not only the “poet of rakes and mistresses,” but also the  literary interpreter of Rome’s rise to geopolitical prominence in the Mediterranean  (Grandezza V 303). Joyce was certainly not unreceptive to this political reading of  the Latin poet. In his guide Latin and Roman Culture in Joyce, R.J. Schork writes,  “There are many references to Ovid and his work in Joyce’s fiction. A few (like the  epigraph to Portrait) are acknowledged; others were embedded in various levels  of the text, especially during the complex formation of Finnegans Wake” (154).  Schork maintains that uncovering allusions, quotes and the “highly camouflaged  references” (158) pertaining to Ovid requires an “exercise in literary archaeology”  (154). Before discussing the appropriate passage in the Wake, let me digress in an  excursus of textual archaeology that allows us to reach the underlying sediment  of Joyce’s reinterpretation of the rape of Europa. In Books II and III of the Metamorphoses, Ovid places the mythical account  into a frame of colonial discourse. Ovid’s source for the Europa episode was the  Sicilian Greek poet Moschus (second century bce), who thematized in a short epic  poem the early encounter between Greeks and Phoenicians. Moschus was drawing  inspiration from contemporary exchanges between the Greek colonial settlements  in Eastern Sicily and Phoenician trading posts located in the Western part of the  island. Similarly, Ovid gave mythical and poetic substance to Rome’s colonization  of Ptolemaic Egypt that included Phoenician territories. The victorious Battle  of Actium (31 bce) secured Rome with these territories. In addition, the Punic  wars against the Phoenician city Carthage, waged two centuries before Ovid’s  time, were still a vivid part of the cultural imagination in Rome. In fact, some  thirty years before Ovid’s poem, Virgil had fictionalised the Roman-Phoenician  encounter through Aeneas and Dido of Carthage in the Aeneid. Given their status  as economic and military archenemy, capable of threatening the geopolitical integ- rity of the Empire, the presence of Phoenician figures in Ovid’s poem constitutes  a political subtext for discourses associated with colonial dominance. According to Ovid, Europa is the daughter of Agenor, the Phoenician king  of Tyre. She is a beautiful maiden whose comeliness attracts the attention of  Jupiter. One day, as the virgin is playing along the shore, the god metamorphoses  </page> <page sequence="11"> 164 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 34, Number 2 into a snow-white bull and browses around her. The girl is struck by the docil- ity of the handsome bull and once she overcomes her initial diffidence she pets  the animal, plays with it and adorns its horns with flowers. While playing, the  tame bull reclines and invites the princess to mount its back. In a sudden move,  bovine-shaped Jupiter runs off with the virgin on his back and swims to Crete.  There, according to various other mythographers, she will bear him two (Minos  and Rhadamanthus) or three sons (including Sarpedon). Ovid’s poetic narration of the divine abduction, however, does not terminate  at Europa’s seizure, but continues to recount the aftermath of the rape, which  coincides with the Phoenician foundation of Thebes. In Ovid’s seamless narrative  continuum, Cadmus’s colonization represents an episode in its own right, but also  serves as an explicatory appendix to the rape of Europa, providing an interpreta- tive key to Jove’s abduction in the preceding episode. Agenor sends out Europa’s  brother Cadmus in order to find her, admonishing his son that if he fails to find  his sister, he will be banished into exile. Cadmus’s search is fruitless and given  his status of expatriate, he looks for a land to colonize. The oracle of Phoebus  advises him to look for a heifer, one that has not yet known the yoke and has not  penetrated the earth with a curved plow. According to the oracle, he should follow  the young cow and build his home where she finally rests. When the heifer at last  lies down, Cadmus kisses the foreign earth and honors the unknown landscape.  He promptly discovers a virgin timber that conceals a cave with an underground  source of fresh water. With the swift narrative pace of Ovid’s poem the following  episode already leads into the process of colonization of Thebes. The heifer that  Cadmus follows is clearly a mythic transfiguration, an implicit and tacit metamor- phosis of Europa herself. Both are virgins and both are mates for a bull. When  Cadmus finds the heifer, he symbolically accomplishes his mission since, after all,  finding the mate for a bull was the ultimate goal of his explorative mission. Cad- mus’s quest is described through a pervasive sexual imagery. The heifer is explicitly  described as not having borne the yoke, one that has “not broken up the earth  with a curved plow” (Met. III, 14–15). The earth is coded as a female body, as  he kisses the ground and when the underground cave, a uterine symbol, conceals  water, an image of vaginal liquid and more generally signifying the fertility of the  soil. The plow breaking up the earth is highly suggestive of sexual violence. The  image of the yoke, by the same token, unambiguously suggests colonial subjuga- tion. Agenor and Cadmus proceed according to a misogynist and colonial logic  that operates in a parallel fashion to Jupiter’s ethnic rape of Phoenician Europa.  Her impregnation will give life to Greek individuals, not to barbarians. A close reader of Ovid, Joyce exploited the colonial subtext of this myth in  order to draw a Viconian parallel, a historic ricorso, between the colonial history  of the Phoenicians and the Irish colonial experience. In the Wake, the episode  is placed within the context of a parody of the Annals of the Four Masters, who  undergo a textual metempsychosis and reappear in the Mamalujo quartet. In  La donna delinquente Ferrero indicated Herodotus as a source for sexual mores  in antiquity. Not surprisingly, then, the source for Joyce’s poetic history is the  </page> <page sequence="12"> Joyce, Ferrero and the Metamorphosis of Irish History 165 “herodotary Mammon Lujius in his grand old historiorum” (FW 13.20–21).  The term “herodotary” conflates the ancient historian Herodotus with notions  of heredity and erudition. Herodotus’s historiography famously chronicled the  introduction of Egyptian and Phoenician civilization to Greece. The ancient  historian recognizes a factual event behind the myth of Europa’s rape: “Some  Greeks landed at Tyre in Phoenicia and abducted the king’s daughter Europa.  The Persian sources are not in a position to name these Greeks, but they were  presumably Cretans” (Histories 3). This episode is part of Herodotus’s introduction  to the Persian wars, in which the abduction of four mythical women constitutes  the origin of military conflicts.9 From the notesheets that Joyce prepared for the  composition of Ulysses, we know that Joyce had read Herodotus’s Histories and  had taken notes from its initial pages: “Herodotus opens hist with Phen. version  of rape of Helen” (qtd. in Schork, Greek 20). The association between rape and  colonial conquest is central to the annals passage, worth quoting at length:  1132 a.d. Men like to ants or emmets wondern upon a groothwide Whallfisk  which lay in a Runnel. Blubby wares upat Ublanium.  566 a.d. On Baalfire’s night of this year after deluge a crone that hadde a wickered  Kish for to hale dead turves from the bog lookit under the blay of her Kish as she ran  for to sothisfeige her cowrieosity and be me sawl but she found hersell sackvulle of  swart goody quickenshoon and small illigant brogues, so rich in sweat. Blurry works  at Hurdlesford.     (Silent.)  566 a.d. At this time it fell out that a brazenlockt damsel grieved (sobralasolas!)  because that Puppette her minion was ravisht of her by the ogre Puropeus Pious.  Bloody wars in Ballyaughacleeaghbally.  1132 a.d. Two sons at an hour were born until a goodman and his hag. These  sons called themselves Caddy and Primas. Primas was a santryman and drilled all  decent people. Caddy went to Winehouse and wrote o peace a farce. Blotty words  for Dublin. (FW 13.33–14.15)  Devoid of a distinct and linear chronology, the quadripartite structure of  the chronicle indicates the record of four different versions of the same mytho- historical event. The chiastic disposition of the narration stages two competing  versions of the respectively consensual and forced sexual encounters. The first and  fourth vignettes appear to function as a prologue (the arrival of the foreigner) and  the aftermath (the birth of offspring) to the coitus proper. The dates 1132 and 566 ad, while alluding to events in Irish history, provide  clues to a blurry and uncertain time continuum, suspended between competing  chronologies, gaps in the timeline and numerical symbology. Throughout the text  the number 1132 is associated with virility and its numeric half 566 stands for  a female principle. For all their symbolic meaning, the dates provide important  thematic clues. The setting is clearly Dublin, as each of the four versions of the  toponym indicates. “Ublanium” evokes the ancient settlement of Eblana, but also  suggests the notion of oblivion. “Ballyaughacleeaghbally” indicates the ancient  </page> <page sequence="13"> 166 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 34, Number 2 Gaelic name of the city, Baile Átha Cliath, meaning Town of the Ford of Hurdles.  566 ad is the year in which the Irish High Kings Domnall and Forggus mac  Muirchertaig, who reigned jointly, die in a battle close to the Liffey. Laurence  O’Toole, the patron saint of Dublin, was born in 1132. In 1132, Diarmaid Mac  Murchadha, also known as Dermot Macmurrough, Irish king of the province of  Leinster, burned the abbey at Kildare and ordered the rape of the abbess. In his  attempt to become High King of Ireland, Dermot sought English help. Taking  advantage of the political and military instability of Ireland, the English king  Henry II was convinced to invade Ireland. Traditional readings consider Dermot  responsible for the English invasion and thus a betrayer of the Irish cause. Catho- lic defenders of Dermot took a more moderate stance, emphasizing his association  with Church reform. In fact, in the same year St. Malachy is consecrated arch- bishop of Armagh, with the intent to impose Roman liturgy on the independent  Irish Church.10 1132 is the year in which Ireland becomes “servant of two masters  . . . an English and an Italian” (U 1.638). In his lucid study Joyce and the Invention of Irish History Thomas Hofheinz  claims that “Joyce stages a semantic scrambling in the passage that reflects prob- lems faced by Irish nationalist historians as they dug for Ireland’s past in the  ruins of Gaelic history. He strips back these problems in order to discover deeper  ones within them, primal motives locking the Irish into a constant repetition of  misery” (106). Vico’s archetypical family, Hofheinz continues, articulates the  cyclical recurrence of these historical patterns associated with patriarchy, incest  and misery in the vicissitudes of HCE, ALP, Issy, Shem and Shaun. This his- torical chronicle narrates “cycles of events grand and national” (FW 13.31–32)  assuming the features of a creative storytelling, constantly playing a variation on  the themes in a spiral timeline, always producing “another tellmastory repeating  yourself ” (FW 397.7–8). The Wake’s poetic chronicle is not solely indebted to Vico’s  philosophy of history based on the cyclical returns of social configurations. Fer- rero’s historiographic methodology, in evident conversation with Vico, emphasizes  the recognition of parallel patterns between the present and the past as a crucial  instrument for the deeper understanding of contemporary history. Joyce’s read- ing of Ferrero reinforces the status of Vico in the Wake. The archetypical coitus  occurs between a male principle, associated through HCE with patriarchal and  colonial violence, and a female principle, embodied by the “daughterwife” (FW  627.2) cluster of ALP/Issy. Underneath the morpho-semantic encrustations of the  language and a family structure of systematically metamorphosing characters one  can extrapolate yet another underlying narrative nucleus. The mythical rape of  Hiberno-Punic Europa, perpetrated by the ogre and placed in the pre-history of  Ireland, foreshadows the sexual union of an Irish woman with a foreign master.  In the annals passage, Europa is associated with both Issy and ALP: the for- mer inasmuch as she represents a young maiden, the latter for her childbearing  attribute. Joyce, however, is far from simply lamenting Ireland’s status of colonial  victim. The two sections dated 566 ad describe the same scene (hence the same  </page> <page sequence="14"> Joyce, Ferrero and the Metamorphosis of Irish History 167 date) but from different perspectives. Joyce introduces a double vision of Irish  history, presenting his own annals as a mytho-poetic record that puts into focus  two competing interpretations. The term “silence” represents the axis of symmetry  and functions like a mirror between the two sections. In the first section, one can  observe a Europa seeking out the sexual encounter, a Europa willing to be done,  probably a female version of the Duke of Willingdone. The following section is  indeed a mirror-like distortion of the preceding narrative. What is emphasized  here is the rape of Europa. Before adopting this rhetoric of victimization, Joyce  depicts the complicity of Ireland in its own colonization. He places Ireland’s  collaboration first, giving in this way priority to a revisionist approach to Irish  history. In the first section of the episode, the whale stranded in the narrow waterway  cues the coitus. The stranded whale furthermore suggests the Viking invasion and  their arrival on the Irish shore. Significantly, in “Proteus” Stephen wanders along  the shore of North Bull Island, associating in his aimless reverie the arrival of  Danish invaders in Ireland with the stranding of whales in 1331. The meat of the  cetaceans provided sustenance for a famine-stricken population: Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the  collar of gold. A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting hobbling  in the shallows. Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs,  my people, with flayers’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whale- meat. Famine, plague and slaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.  (U 3.301–07) Once again, Ferrero’s L’Europa giovane provides a key to the passage. The  autochthonous dwarfs of Stephen’s daydream turn into colonizing ants, highly  reminiscent of the mythological Myrmidons. The ants are also associated with  emigration and colonization. For Ferrero, the term colonization is often syn- onymous with nineteenth-century mass emigration. He identifies three forms  of colonization: plasmatic, typical for the English; adhesive, characteristic of  Chinese, Italian and Irish emigration; and diffusive, distinctive of the Germans.  The German diffusive emigration pattern is likened to an anthill, from which  the antlike emigrants move to colonize and inhabit new territories: “Dovunque si  dovrà colonizzare un continente deserto, . . . verranno subito le lunghe processioni  delle pazienti formiche tedesche” (119) [“Wherever a barren continent needs to  be colonized . . . the long processions of the patient, German ants will at once  arrive” (my translation)]. In the expression “Baalfire’s night” Joyce inserts a Nordic layer in an already  existing context of cultural and religious syncretism between the Phoenician and  Roman worlds. Baal is a Semitic fertility god and the name of several kings of  the Phoenician city Tyre, home city of Europa (Aubet 56–57). In Heliopolis of  Phoenicia, today the Lebanese city of Baalbek,11 a temple dedicated to the syn- cretic deity Jupiter-Baal, also known as the Heliopolitan Zeus, was built when  the Romans colonized the city in the first century ce. The nexus linking Roman  </page> <page sequence="15"> 168 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 34, Number 2 Jupiter to Phoenician Baal is the common tradition of their auxiliary bovine  nature, a common characteristic among bull-worshipping cultures in ancient  Mediterranean traditions.12 The vowels in the term “Baal” suggest the Hebrew  letter aleph, the pictographic image of which is the bull or ox. The association  between the letter aleph and the bull reappears later in the character of “Olaph  the Oxman” (FW 132.17–18), a spin on the Northern “Oxman” (FW 15.6) and  the metonymic toponomy of “Oxmanstown” (FW 47.24), suggestive of North  Bull Island in Dublin Bay. “Baalfire’s night” also suggests Walpurgis Night, a  Northern European fertility rite celebrated at the beginning of spring with nightly  bonfires. It is probable that Joyce was aware of Sir William Betham’s comparative  analysis of Gaels and Phoenicians. Betham was well-known as a member of the  “Gaelophile-Phoenicianist school of Irish antiquarianism” (Nadel 156), to which  Vallancey also belonged. In his book The Gael and Cymbri; or an Inquiry into the  the Origin and History of the Irish Scoti, Britons, and Gauls, published in Dublin  in 1834, Betham argues that “Baal . . . has the precise meaning in Gaelic as in  Phoenician — the lord of heaven” (226). Baal is thus presented as an Irish-Semitic  god, the “bog,” Slovenian for god, to whose sexual prowess the “Kish,” from the  Hungarian adjective kis meaning “little,” succumbs. The annals continue to record the sexual encounter between Europa and the  foreigner. Ferrero’s account of hospitable and sacred prostitution, described as a  customary practice among the Phoenicians in La donna delinquente, provides the  cultural coordinates for the characters’ behavior in this first section dated 566 ad.  The crone is pushing her daughter to hail and welcome the divinity, suggest- ing that the mother looks favorably upon her daughter’s sexual encounter. The  alteration of “herself ” into “hersell” strongly reinforces the notion of ritualized  prostitution. Europa is eager to offer her sexual favors, for which she receives a  dowry of shoes and elegant robes. This version symbolically represents an Ireland  cooperative in its own colonization, receiving only a meager compensation in the  economic transaction. The outcome of this sexual encounter is a pregnancy: “she  found hersell sackvulle” indicating that she was full of seed from his scrotum  (Hodensack in German), but also gifted with a dowry, in the form of a sack full  of black (swart from the German schwarz) and elegant shoes. The sack of goods  she receives alludes to Ferrero’s passage in Il Militarismo, in which the Phoeni- cian women buy a specimen of the merchant, “thinking that they thus satisfied  an innocent desire. But the merchant’s treasure-bag was inexhaustible. Every  day he produced thence some new object, and the temptation to indulge in them  grew ever stronger” (Militarism 300). Shoon is archaic plural for shoes, whereas  brogues were heavy leather shoes worn in Ireland. The term “brogue” also indi- cates a strong Irish accent in English, indicative of the Gaelic substratum of the  Hibernian dialect. In the “Finnegan’s Wake” ballad, Tim Finnegan is said to have  “a beautiful brogue, so rich and sweet” (Hutchins 214).13 The Hiberno-English  intonation is another clue suggesting a colonial dynamic. For their intercourse, the maid approaches the bull in order to “sothisfeige her  cowrieosity” (FW 14.2–3). This portmanteau registers a confluence of manifold  </page> <page sequence="16"> Joyce, Ferrero and the Metamorphosis of Irish History 169 meanings. McHugh’s annotations indicate that Sothis is the Egyptian of Sirius,  the star of Isis. The cow would consequently be the cow that is sacred to Isis.  More meanings, however, can be extracted. First of all, the expression is a pho- nological distortion suggesting the phrase “to satisfy her curiosity,” while at the  same time indicating her bovine nature. The phrase again emphasizes her active  role in the sexual encounter. It is likely that Joyce had also read about Europa  taking the initiative in Wilhelm Roscher’s Ausführliches Lexikon der griechischen  und römischen Mythologie, an encyclopaedia of classical mythology the author had  consulted. In Roscher, the entry concerning Europa stresses her audacity, depict- ing her as courageous and daring: “Europa, die schönste und übermütigste von  allen, [welche] es sogar wagt, sich auf den Rücken des reizenden Tieres zu setzen”  (1410) [“Europa, the most beautiful and audacious of all, [who] even dares to sit  on the back of the handsome animal” (my translation)]. The term “cowrieosity”  can be glossed in two ways, indicating a cow and at the same time a cowrie. Her  bovine nature makes Europa the appropriate match for the bull, with whom she  can satisfy her curiosity and sexual appetite. I shall discuss Europa’s cow-like  reappearance in the text shortly. For now, suffice it to say that the maiden’s characterization as a cowrie is  yet another element that unmistakably identifies her as Phoenician Europa. The  Phoenician thalassocracy was famous in the Mediterranean for the production of a  highly priced purple dye, a cloth colorant produced from a cowrie, i.e. the marine  gastropod Murex brandaris. Given its laborious production process, the purple dye  became a luxury item in antiquity.14 The Greeks identified the Phoenicians with  their purple dye production to the extent that their name comes from the Greek  phoinós, meaning reddish purple. In Ancient Greek, the toponym Phoenicia  indicates “the country of purple cloth” (Aubet 7).15 Accordingly, Issy/Europa later  makes another veiled appearance in the text as the “purple cardinal’s princess” and  “cowmate” (FW 243.30 and 32). In the section described as “annadominant” (FW 14.17), Europa is described  as a “brazenlockt damsel.” This marks a shift from her bold initiative. Chastity  takes the place of her audacity if we take the expression as suggestive of brass- locked, the description of the closing mechanism of a chastity belt. The term  damsel is evocative of medieval courtly love and the ideal of a distant and unreach- able lady. In this passage, Joyce masterfully stages the paradox of multiplying the  identities of the god and the girl, while at the same time stripping them of any  secondary traits attaining a minimalist reduction to their sexual organs. Rapist  and victim, the “ogre Puropeus Pious” and “her minion” are reduced to a penis  (peos in Greek) and a vulva (mouni in Greek). She expresses her grief sobre las olas,  ‘above the waves,’ another reference to the ancient myth in which Europa is taken  across the sea to the island of Crete. The raping god is presented as “Puropeus Pious,” a pun that signals the con- vergence of Vico and Nietzsche as primary sources. The pure and pious qualities  of the god hint at Vico’s religious wars of the Heroic Age, characterized with the  Latin formula pura et pia bella in the New Science. This reference to Vico, however,  </page> <page sequence="17"> 170 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 34, Number 2 is a successive layer that Joyce added. The earliest version of this passage reads  “Europeus Pius” (First-Draft 53), an allusion to Nietzsche’s notion of the “good  European” echoed in the “goodman and his hag” (FW 14.11–12). Their union  produces the birth of Caddy and Primas, mythic precursors of Shem and Shaun  and embodiments of the tension between Ireland and its colonial masters. Once  again, Joyce makes a Phoenician character prefigure an Irish one. The prehis- toric Caddy — whose name is a diminutive for Cadmus, Europa’s mythological  brother — appears as a pacifist author and thus foreshadows the later appearance  of Shem the Penman. Shem’s rival brother Shaun undergoes a dual characteriza- tion as a belligerent archbishop — the Primate drilling all decent people — who  personifies Ireland’s two masters, in the form of English military aggression and  the ecclesiastical power of the Catholic Church. In a text rich with interpenetrating personalities and blurring borders, where  everyone has their own “multiple Mes” (FW 410.12) the Phoenician/Irish maiden  undergoes a “doublin” (FW 3.8, 578.14) or “Doubling” (FW 97.9, 197.5, 290.16,  295.31, 413.25, 462.19), metamorphosing from a female and ravished Europa  into a male ravisher Europe. In this way, young Europa is paradoxically ravished  by her own masculine double, by that “Puropeus Pious” who epitomizes the  colonial imagination of a European imperial project. Ferrero’s historical sketch  of Phoenician sexuality provides the textual background to this transformation: I templi della dea Astarte a Tiro, a Sidone e nelle principali città della Fenicia, erano  consacrati alla prostituzione: Astarte nelle sue statue scolpiva gli organi maschili e  femminili a significare il travestirsi degli uomini in donna, e delle donne in uomini,  allorchè celebravansi le notturne feste della Dea. (Donna delinquente 221) At Tyre, Sidon and the major cities of Phoenicia, the temples of the goddess Astarte  were consecrated to prostitution, and her statues depicted the goddess with both  male and female sexual organs to signify the cross-dressing of men into women,  and women into men, when the goddess’s nocturnal festivals were celebrated. (My  translation)  The Wake also offers an alternative account for the masculine metamorphosis of  Europa into Europe. For someone who is associated with the ancient clothing  trade, it is not surprising that the transgendering process occurs through trans- vestitism. The maiden puts on different clothes; Europe becomes “Newrobe” (FW  155.5). Cross-dressing constitutes an underlying subtext in different episodes  of the Wake, a recurrent leitmotif whose overtones are associated with Europe’s  double characterization as male and female. In the “Burrus and Caseous” epi- sode, which will be discussed in more detail shortly, Europe the “new robe,”  despite being a “seducente infanta,” is unable to “conceal her own more mascular  personality by flaunting frivolish finery over men’s inside clothes, for the femi- ninny of that totamulier will always lack the musculink of a verumvirum” (FW  166. 23–26). The ambiguous status of Europa’s androgynous character cluster is  suspended between the poles of a masculine and aggressive militarism associated  </page> <page sequence="18"> Joyce, Ferrero and the Metamorphosis of Irish History 171 with the bull and a feminine, pacifist anti-colonialism associated with the image  of the cow. Depending on her dress code, Europa can assume a more feminine  personality to hide the masculine aspects of her character, even though as a total  woman she lacks true virility. Clothes and militarism are also associated in ALP’s  letter. The envelope of ALP’s letter “exhibits only the civil or military clothing  of whatever passionpallid nudity or plaguepurple nakedness may happen to tuck  itself under its flap” (FW 109.10–13). ALP’s letter, clothed by a semi-transparent  envelope, is an over-written palimpsest from which only fragments of Europa’s  tale can be recognized. The “military clothing” and ”plaguepurple nakedness” are  the vestigial traces of the rape of Phoenician Europa. The bull and the cow make a systematic return in the text. The metempsy- chotic reincarnation of archetypes in history associates the figure of the bull  with colonial conquest as can be seen with “Ivaun the Tauribble” (FW 138.17), a  condensation of Ivan the Terrible and a taurus, which is Greek and Latin for bull.  Another association between military conquest and a bull is made in the passage  that introduces “Ussur Ursussen of the viktaurious onrush,” described “as bold  and as madhouse a bull in a meadows” (FW 353.12–13). A few lines down, this  “viktaurious bull” is described as “Deo Jupto” (FW 353.18), as the raping Jupiter/ Zeus. In the archetypical bull one cannot help but also recognize a zoomorphic  adaptation of John Bull, the personification of England in late nineteenth- and  early twentieth-century propaganda, as well as a comment on the papal bull  Laudabiliter that in 1155 sanctioned the English invasion of Ireland. In that year,  Ireland was “bulledicted” (FW 458.3) to English rule. Next to the recurrent image of the bull, the cow makes several appearances  in the course of the novel. Europa has to be “Playing bull before shebears” (FW  522.15), meaning that she has to become a bull before she can bear his children.  Later, the theme of a young Europe, carried over the sea and bearing the offspring  of a bull, returns in a passage in which a sympathetic narrative voice says, “Poor  little tartanelle, her dinties are chattering, the strait’s she’s in, the bulloge she  bears!” (FW 583.3–4) The “cowrymaid” (FW 164.8) appears as a maternal figure  for later appearances such as “Sweet Margareen” (FW 164.19) and the brothers  “Burrus and Caseous” (FW 165.12).16 The offspring of the cow-maid, respectively  butter and cheese, are personified dairy products. These multifaceted names  combine matrilineal genealogy with a patrilineal logic of descent. While the  children retain maternal characteristics in their names, Europa’s union with the  Ovid-inspired Jupiter produces avatars of Brutus and Cassius, markedly Roman  offspring. Burrus is presented as “full of natural greace” and quite paradoxically  also as “obsoletely unadulterous” (FW 161.16 and 17). Burrus is full of grease — as  well as full of grace like the Virgin — and absolutely unadulterated. But then, this  unadulterated state appears to also be obsolete. This adulterating mixture of butter  with grease is already foreshadowed by the accusations made to HCE in chapter  I.3. Among the 111 allegations to the father figures the claim that he mixes butter  with grease: “Grease with the Butter” (FW 71.13). When the rumours about HCE’s  transgressions attain international scope in the “Casaconcordia” (FW 54.10), he  </page> <page sequence="19"> 172 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 34, Number 2 is accused of dishonest business practices that take the form of “cowhaendel”  (FW 54.27). The term suggests the German Kuhhandel, literally ‘cow-business,’  that indicates devious bartering exchanges. Burrus’s sibling Caseous is “obversely  the revise” (FW 161.18) of his brother. The Phoenician origin of the offspring of  Europa as a “cowrymaid” is emphasized twice in the “Burrus and Caseous” epi- sode. First in the sentence: “The older sisars (Tyrants, regicide is too good for you!)  become unbeurrable from age” (FW 162.1–2). The two Caesars become Tyrants  and unbearable, with a pun of the French beurre, ‘butter.’ The term “Tyrants” is to  be understood in two ways: in the sense of oppressor, but also in the sense of being  citizens of the Phoenician city Tyre, legendary birthplace of Europa. The same  concept is reiterated shortly afterwards, in the passage “Caseous, the bruther- scutch or puir tyron” (FW 163.8–9). These references to the Phoenician city Tyre  conveniently overlap with Tyrone, one of the traditional counties of Ireland. In  this expression Joyce makes Phoenicia and Ireland overlap again. At this point it is  probably useful to bear in mind that the etymology of the term “butter” mediated  through Germanic languages derives from the Latin butyrum, borrowed from the  Greek boutyron, which appears to be a combination of bous, ‘ox, cow,’ and tyros,  ‘cheese.’ Joyce must have been aware of this etymology and exploited it for the  construction of the children and Shem, Shaun and Issy that here become Burrus,  Caseous and the mother/sister Margareen (FW 164.14). This “emended food theory” (FW 163.36) that regulates the interpersonal  dynamics of the family with a pronounced “eatusup complex” (FW 128.36) is  linked to the Habsburg Empire and Europe. The Austrian-Hungarian monarchy  becomes “old Auster and Hungrig” (FW 464.27–28), Joyce’s own comment on his  precarious life in Trieste and the meager food supply in the early years of his stay  on the Adriatic. Given the fact that in Trieste Joyce and Nora lived well beyond  their means (at the expense of Stanislaus), it seems likely that the oysters (German  Austern) mentioned refer to the lavish spending the couple indulged in whenever  the possibility arose. The ghostly appearance of the crumbled Habsburg Empire is  regulated by a recurrent cycle of destruction and Phoenix-like resurrection, since  history “moves in vicous cicles yet remews the same” (FW 134.16–17). Joyce’s last  work is not only the wake for Finnegan, but also the “the wrake of the hapspurus”  (FW 557.6). While the expressions cues Henry Longfellow’s poem “The Wreck of  the Hesperus,” it also suggests the “wake of the Hapsburgs,” in terms of a funeral,  or “funforall” (FW 458.22), and the wreckage of the Austrian monarchy. After the  demise of imperial Habsburg, Joyce envisions the possibility of a resurrection of  the multicultural and polyglot state as becomes clear in the expression “Osterich,  the U.S.E.” (FW 70.1). Here Joyce makes the explicit connection between Öster- reich, i.e. Austria, and the United States of Europe. Joyce’s stay in Central Europe,  or “Zentral Oylrubber” (FW 69.1) has informed Shem’s preference to “far sooner  muddle through the hash of lentils in Europe than meddle with Irrland’s split  little pea” (FW 171.5–6). Joyce’s description of the European empire and Ireland  in terms of victuals suggests an association with the basic alimentary concerns of  a writer who had lived through days without food. </page> <page sequence="20"> Joyce, Ferrero and the Metamorphosis of Irish History 173 conclusion Although in Ferrero’s historiography the Phoenicians do not occupy a position  as prominent as in Bérard’s, the high esteem in which Ferrero held them made  the books of the Italian historian a crucial source for Joyce’s permanent inter- est in the ancient population. I have suggested not only that we read Ferrero’s  Philo-Semitism in close connection with Bérard’s theories, but also that Fer- rero’s influence rivals Bérard’s in importance. The reason for this suggestion is  that Ferrero’s sympathetic, albeit occasionally racialist, attitude towards Semitic  populations translated into two main arguments. First of all, as a historian, he  considered the Phoenicians as important as Greeks and Romans in the genealogy  of Western civilization. With the exception of nineteenth-century Ireland, this  position was far from common in continental ancient historiography, which was  eagerly invested in downplaying or blatantly denying any significant encounter  or a Semitic influence on the West.17 Predisposed by Ferrero, Joyce reads Ovid’s  tale of Europa as the mytho-poetic elaboration of Roman colonization of Semitic  Phoenicia. In addition, in L’Europa giovane Ferrero considered the Jews, cultur- ally and linguistically very close to the Phoenicians, as an integral and indivisible  part of contemporary Europe. Reading Ferrero corroborates Joyce’s acceptance  of the idea that the Semitic Phoenicians are Irish progenitors, hence Europeans. As far as contemporary politics are concerned, Ferrero’s early work was largely  driven by late-nineteenth-century optimism, a misguided faith in continental  peace that represented a powerful allure to an entire generation of young Euro- peans. In 1906, Joyce was certainly not immune to the appeal of a new Europe  and the prospect of a new continental order that would redefine the future role  of Ireland. The most immediate effect of Joyce’s engagement with Ferrero was  his reclaiming of an allegedly more authentic Irish identity within the context  of a European cultural cosmopolitanism. The early Ferrero provided Joyce with  a pacifist and anti-colonial notion of Europe, envisioned as a confederation of  democracies. Such utopia of a “United States of the Europe of the future” (Joyce,  Portrait 191–92) allowed Joyce to imagine an Ireland free from the yoke of English  imperialism and represented an alternative to the nightmarish contours assumed  by contemporary history. Joyce’s commitments to political projects and ideological agendas were always  half-hearted at best, first timidly embraced but ultimately marked by a profound  distrust. By appropriating and exploiting the colonial subtext of Europa’s rape for  his Irish pre-history, Joyce craftily exposes a fundamental problem in what has  been considered a myth of foundation by Western tradition. The author chal- lenges his audience not simply with an audacious language and plot, but asks the  uncomfortable question of what it means to consider a rape the foundational myth  for a civilization. In this way, the sexual politics leading to imperial conquest  would be intrinsic to the very notion of Europe. The subtle political commentary  embedded in the passage evokes a critique of European imperialism, which puts  Europe on a path of self-destruction. Joyce had already voiced such a concern in  </page> <page sequence="21"> 174 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 34, Number 2 the early poem “Dooleysprudence” in which “Poor Europe ambles / Like sheep  to shambles” (Poems and Exiles 81). For the later Joyce, however, this appears to  be only a partial depiction. In the annals passage, the tension between Ireland’s  status as imperial victim and the image of eager collaborator in its own coloniza- tion subsumes a highly ambiguous role for Europe, suspended between the old  imperial paradigm and the promise of an anti-colonial future. The polyglot cross-fertilizations of the Wake appear as an attempt to capture  in memory the multilingual fabric of Habsburg Trieste, an attempt to “regain  that absendee tarry easty, his città immediata” (FW 228.22–23), considered by  many Triestine intellectuals of that time a microcosm of the multinational empire  and thus an urban experiment of a future United States of Europe. Joyce hopes,  not without moments of imperial nostalgia, that the Habsburg state will once  again rise like Phoenix out its ashes in the new form of a confederation of Euro- pean democracies. As a united Europe was still far from its political realization,  Finnegans Wake is, under Ferrero’s influence, a playful rehearsal, the textual and  linguistic performance of a young Europe. Notes 1. The few critical contributions on Joyce and L’Europa giovane that are available have helped a great  deal in the understanding of how the work influenced the Irish writer. Critics that have elucidated  Ferrero’s role in Joyce are Manganiello, Humphreys, Spoo, Scholes and McCourt. While Man- ganiello and Humphreys both individuate the presence of Ferrero in the textual genesis of Ulysses  and especially in the Jewish Bloom, the critics disagree on one particular aspect. Manganiello sees  in L’Europa giovane a crucial source for “Two Gallants,” whereas Humphreys believes that Fer- rero’s Il Militarismo should be considered the most likely resource for the short story. Spoo agrees  with Manganiello, adding to the corpus of texts directly influenced by Joyce’s reading of L’Europa  giovane another story contained in Dubliners, namely “A Little Cloud.” Spoo suggests that Joyce read  L’Europa giovane twice: a first and more superficial reading in late 1905 or early 1906 and a deeper  engagement in November of 1906. 2. During Joyce’s stay in Trieste, Ferrero is mentioned several times in the author’s letters. The first  time Joyce mentions the historian is in his letter of 5 May 1906 to the unwilling publisher Grant  Richards to explain the rationale behind the story “Two Gallants.”A few months later, in a letter  dated 13 November 1906, Joyce informs his brother Stanislaus that he had “ just read” (128) Ferrero’s  history of Rome and his Europa giovane. 3. I am referring to Charles Vallancey’s An Essay on the Antiquity of the Irish Language, being a  Collation of the Irish with the Punic Languages from 1772. 4. For a recent discussion of Joyce and the Phoenicians, see Cullingford. She offers a rich and useful  account of the Phoenician presence in Joyce, focusing on Joyce’s 1907 essay, Dubliners and Ulysses. 5. As a promising but inexperienced intellectual, Ferrero was little more than a research assistant  to the more experienced Lombroso. 6. For the division of their research topics, see Calloni. 7. Joyce was an extremely attentive reader of Ferrero’s work. Several critics have attested to Joyce’s  close reading and creative use of Ferrero’s text. Spoo claims that the title of “A Little Cloud” in  Dubliners is much indebted to Ferrero’s somewhat whimsical expression “una piccola nuvoletta” used  by the Italian historian in his book (Spoo, “Nuvoletta” 405). Scholes even goes so far as to maintain  </page> <page sequence="22"> Joyce, Ferrero and the Metamorphosis of Irish History 175 that Stephen’s intention to “forge in the smithy of [his] soul the uncreated conscience of [his] race”  is an almost literal translation of a passage in L’Europa giovane (Scholes 101). 8. McCourt describes the local dialect of Trieste as “a living encyclopaedia of the cultures, nations  and languages that had been assimilated in the city” (52). It is easy to understand how polyglot Joyce  was fascinated by the linguistic wealth in the city. McCourt further suggests that the international  language of Finnegans Wake is “an exaggerated, exploded version of Triestino . . . which itself was used  and misused, understood, half-understood, sometimes misunderstood at all” (52–53). 9. The four abducted women were: Io of Argos by Phoenician traders, the Phoenician princess  Europa by Cretans, Medea at the hands of a crew led by Jason and Helen by the Trojan prince Paris. 10. For the historical background, see Gardiner and Wenborn. 11. In the Wake, the city of Baalbek figures as “Bullbeck” (FW 627.2). 12. Besides the Greek and Roman traditions, bull cults are present in Egyptian, Minoan, Meso- potamic and Ugaritic cultures. In Ugaritic mythology, particularly, Baal lies with his sister Anat, a  virgin goddess of fertility, who bears him a son in the form of an ox. 13. There are several versions of the ballad that slightly differ from each other. In the version quoted  by Patricia Hutchins in 1957, Tim Finnegan has “a beautiful brogue, so rich and sweet.” Richard  Ellmann, and with him the majority of Joyce scholars, rely on a version that reads, “He had a tongue  both rich and sweet” (Ellmann 543). 14. Purple robes became a status symbol in imperial Rome and evolved into “royal” purple. The color  was later also incorporated in the chromatic symbolism of religious garments. 15. For more details on the history of the Phoenicians, see Aubet. 16. This morphological reconstruction contradicts Schork’s assertion, according to which “it would  be pushing allusion to the limits to claim that ‘cowrymaid’ . . . refers to the metamorphosis of Io,” a  priestess of Hera transformed into a heifer by Zeus to hide his infidelity (Schork, Greek 2). 17.
