<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARD A NEW DEFINITION OF RELIGIOUS ART' By Peter Fingesten THE symbolic art forms which have accompanied Christianity illustrate its growth and changes through the millennia. Just as there are manifold interpretations of early Christian frescoes, a multiplicity of individual opin- ions on certain sayings in the Gospels, so there are today many points of view on Christian symbols. The greatest force lies in the symbols themselves, many of which transcend time, country and religion. All of the various styles in Christian art, from the Early Christian to the Baroque, have utilized the same symbols . . . and a sacred art without symbols is unthinkable. At this time the problem of art and religion has captured great public interest. Practically all the major Christian denominations have voiced their concern in the relationship between modern art and the church.2 In Jewish circles this problem of art and religion has also received more than casual interest.3 To this sampling of published statements one may add the recent exhibition of Ecclesiastical Sculpture sponsored by the National Sculpture Society (May-June, 1950, French Gallery, New York), another sponsored by the National Association of Women Artists (November, 1950, Argent Gallery, New York). In Oklahoma City there was an exhibition Art and Religion (October, 1950) and, on an international scale, the exhibition of Modern Catholic Art at the Vatican which opened September 4, 1950. No doubt there are many creative artists with an interest and leaning toward devotional themes who form but a small proportion of all the circles, ecclesi- astic and lay, who feel this to be one of the particular problems of our present day religious crisis. For over 1500 years Christian art and architecture have accompanied the 1 The material for this article has been selected from a manuscript by the author, Christ, the Cross and Krishna, A New Study in Christian Art and Symbols. 2 Pope Pius XII, Encyclical Letter (Mediator Dei), On the Sacred Liturgy, New York, The America Press, 1948.

They have bridged whole civilizations, linking the Hellenistic with the western and the Oriental-Byzantine with the northern. What was once a close relationship between the artists and the church has come to a parting of the ways. Today, few creative artists work for the church. The artist has not only gained social freedom but he has outdistanced the more conservative tastes of most ecclesiastics who prefer the traditional styles, or even if they are more inclined towards modern art they insist upon the use of traditional symbols. When a churchman commissions "religious art" he has something partic- ular in mind. When an artist creates "religious art" he has probably some-, thing else in mind, not less "religious" but perhaps less traditional. An ab- stract carving by a devout sculptor has the same religious significance for him as a saint surrounded with symbols would have to an ecclesiastic. Since there seems to be a constant misunderstanding on the definitions of religious art, some remarks are in order to help clarify this problem. The art of the church is commonly called "religious art." We believe this to be a misnomer, a misunderstanding of what the arts were expected to ac- complish within the religion. It disregards the true position of the craftsmen who rendered it and the immense influence of ecclesiastical authority which, through its patronage and supervision was largely responsible for its creation. To call church architecture and icons "religious" is romantic at best, for it neither describes its true purpose and derivation, nor does it necessarily cor- respond to its deeper content. A careful analysis of the function of the arts and symbols that served the church is imperative, since their goal was, above all, religious instruction. Art as such is neither sacred not profane. It is either good or bad art. What determines the difference in these classifications is the function it is put to and the presence or absence of certain traditional symbols. "Ecclesiastic" art is the general term which encompasses all the arts and architecture that pertain to any church, generally speaking. "Canonical" art is a more specific definition. It refers to an art that follows particular rules and regulations prescribed by official decrees, ecclesiastic councils, synods, encyclicals, etc., which defined the role of art in the church or worship and limits it to approved symbols. "Didactic" art refers to all the canonically defined arts and symbols that in addition have the specific purpose to teach dogmatic and theological precepts by sight and not by the word. "Liturgical" art comprehends prescribed, approved and fixed arts and symbols that correspond in material, shape and tradition with the require- ments of the liturgical uses to which they are put. It is prescribed in the sense</page><page sequence="3">A NE'W DEFINITION OF RELIGIOUS ART 133 as the liturgy of public worship is prescribed. Thus it must also be canonical. "Sacred" art (hieratic) is the general term which sums up all the above definitions. It means the arts or symbols especially dedicated for religious use. Sacred art, including altars, vessels, vestments, architecture, sculpture and painting is consecrated by prayers, rites and ceremonies. Sacred art, therefore, refers mainly to canonical correctness and to the approved symbols contained therein than to the intrinsic, that is, the stylistic or artistic quality of the art work, symbol or architecture itself. Even though we have reason to believe that style was also subject to ecclesiastical decrees the above definitions prescribe what the artist must do, not how. At this point we may say all devotional art not subject to the above restrictions is religious art. It does not always find its way into a church. It is not an art commissioned by an ecclesiastic but created by the artist as a free creative effort like so many works by Rembrandt, Blake, Rodin, or Rouault. Religious art, in contrast to sacred art is a personal mode of ex- pression chosen by those artists who were religiously inspired. They often invented personal symbols for their feelings, visions, or sensations, instead of employing the approved symbols handed down by tradition or defined officially. Many artists, ancient and contemporary, have created religious art while in their most inspired moods, but this art is more difficult to define since such inspirations which sometimes border on the mystical underlie many of the greatest artistic creations of all times. The Latin church was always aware of the problem of art in its relation to religion. Records of the various church councils which dealt with sacred art from the Synod of Elvira, about 315 A.D., the Second Council of Nice (Nicaea) 787 A.D., to the Council of Trent, 1545-1663 A.D., and the recent encyclical Mediator Dei (1947) by Pope Pius XII prove that there has never been an unanimous definition and acceptance of sacred art. There have always been discussions about the role, purpose and subject matter of sacred art and its service of the church dogmas. It is generally known, of course, that up to the 4th Century A.D. the primitive church rejected the figurative arts be- cause of the then potent prescriptions against idolatry. Most of the symbols we now consider typically Christian were either completely unknown before the 4th Century, or were still claimed by other religions and mystery cults.4 ' Clement of Alexandria, the great Christian writer of the early Third Century, expressed himself against symbols. 'If one go round and inspect the pictures and images, he will at a glance recognize your gods from their shameful forms: Dionysos from his robe; Haphaestus from his art; Demeter from her calamity; Ino from her head dress; Poseidon from his trident; Zeus from the swan; . . . and if one sees a</page><page sequence="4">134 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL Before that time the primitive church had exhibited a remarkable consistency with the highest ideals of the New Testament. It was a time when the spiritual aspects of their religion absorbed the attention of the people. They had as yet no familiarity with luxuriously decorated churches, colorful priestly vestments, symbols, icons and mosaics. The writings of the great church fathers Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Lactantius, Arnobius of Sicca and others, testify to their rejection of material symbols and an in- sistence upon a purely spiritual approach to God with purely spiritual means. During the first few centuries of its existence the primitive church had no art of its own. A Christian art arose only after classic art had lost its sense of proportion, its techniques were forgotten and its characteristics weakened. Early Christian icons, with their stiff, formalistic attitudes, reveal a profound engrossment with the ascetic ideal which is more spiritual than mundane. They reflect the Judaic tradition which rejected completely, in accordance with the Second Commandment, anthropomorphic representations of spiritual concepts or of God. The ancient religions of the East relied upon art and sym- bolism as concrete evidence of their notions of the universe. This relationship has since changed though the affinity between art and religion still exists. This mutual dependency of religion and art and symbolism had been weakened considerably during the first few centuries of Christianity but later, especially during the Middle Ages and the Counter Reformation they were brought into a closer relationship again. Christianity, in its radical social concepts, drew no caste lines between slaves and master, and between rich and poor. The ensuing revolution reverberated not only in social and spiritual spheres, but also, inevitably, in statue of a naked woman without an inscription, he understands it to be the golden Aphrodite." The Ante Nicene Fathers, New York, 1917-1925, II, p. 188. "For, in sooth, the image is only dead matter shaped by the craftsmen's hand. But we have no sensible image of sensible matter, but an image that is perceived by the mind alone,-God, who alone is truly God." Clement of Alexandria, op. cit., p. 186. During the Third Century the pagan Celsus attacked Christianity on the ground that its very lack of symbols indicated that it was a mystery cult. Origen refuted this attack brilliantly in his book Contra Celsum. "It is not therefore true that we object to building altars, statues and temples, because we have agreed to make this the badge of a secret and forbidden society; but we do so, because we have learned from Jesus Christ the true way of serving God, and we shrink from whatever, under a pretense of piety leads to utter impiety those who abandon the way marked out for us by Jesus Christ. For it is He who alone is the way of piety, as He truly said, 'I am the way, the truth, the life'." op. cit., IV, p. 647. The Synod of Elvira, about 315 A.D., in its 36th canon, prohibited the figurative arts in churches. "There should be no pictures in church building, lest what is wor- shipped and adored might be painted on the walls." Walter Lowrie, Art in the Early Church, New York, 1947, p. 29.</page><page sequence="5">A NEW DEFINITION OF RELIGIOUS ART 135 the domain of art. Its symbology had to be all-inclusive to be universally appealing. Christianity abhorred the appeal to an elite. It offered the possi- bility of salvation to all men. The liberating forces that advanced with a vigor- ous Christianity took from the select the carefully guarded symbols and prof- erred them to the masses. For this reason, some of the cryptic symbols of old became general property even though their meanings were not always re- vealed to the people.5 Certain symbols like the vescica piscis, the nimbus, the wheel cross, the triangular nimbus, the trident, the lily, the dolphin, the dove, the hand of God, etc., had gained such influence over so many people that early Christian- ity would not eradicate them altogether. It included many of these earlier elements into its own symbolical vocabulary. We may assume that the early Christians were familiar with the ideas and symbols of the Asiatic and Medi- terranean religions that flourished in Rome as well as in the Near East. Many theologians of the medieval and modern church realized this and without categorically prohibiting the use of the latter, maintained that these symbols, in the borrowing, were transfigured and spiritualized. In this respect the great tradition of sacred art continues unbroken from the earliest sun-worshippers with their wheels, circles and the like, to medieval and modern canonical representations of Christ with His head framed in a golden halo, a nimbus or emanating rays. Christianity and certain already established symbolic art forms met, clashed, and ultimately united, but not without centuries of violent con- troversy. The artists and craftsmen who were asked to symbolize the new religious concepts had to draw for inspiration upon forms already established by the older cults. It was not considered offensive to frame Christian concepts within art forms hallowed by tradition and burned into the memory of the people.6 5 "In Byzantine church architecture a fixed rule developed by which all walls and vaults were ornamented with pictorial representations that had an underlying secret symbolism." Wilhelm Schamoni, The Face of the Saints, New York, 1947, p. 27. "The origin of this symbolism is not to be defined." H. Jenner, Christian Sym- bolism, London, 1910, p. xiii. 6 "When, after the triumph of the Church, Christian sculptors were confronted with subjects hitherto unattempted, and found themselves under embarrassing obligations of depicting on stone the personages and stories of the Bible, they were happy in the opportunity of being able to draw inspiration from the portrayals which the Persian Mysteries had popularized. A few alterations in costume and attitude transformed a pagan scene into a Christian picture. Mithra discharging his arrows against the rock became Moses causing the waters of the mountain of Horeb to gush forth; the Sun, raising his ally out of the ocean, served to express the ascension of Elijah in the chariot of fire; and to the time of the Middle Ages the type of the tauroctonous god was perpetuated in the images of Samson rending the Lion." Franz Cumont, The Mysteries of Mithra, Chicago, 1910, p. 228.</page><page sequence="6">136 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL We know from considerable evidence that the non-Christian sculptors who were commissioned to carve sarcophagi for the Christians were responsible for the choice and arrangement of the various symbols to be carved thereon. They were instrumental in patterning their choice of devices by which to symbolize the soul or the Resurrection, for instance. When the motifs were not offensive to the Christian buyers, the sculptors left them untouched. In time such ancient theriomorphic symbols as the phoenix, the pelican and the peacock were believed to contain a meaning particularly Christian. In this manner a new tradition rose upon the old. Most of the symbols we know as Christian had their prototypes in the East and in certain pre-Christian religions. Admittedly it is very difficult to ascertain how the symbols migrated toward the West and into western Christianity. The process is fairly clear for some of them, for others we know only that they existed in the iconography of eastern religions and then re- appeared in Christian sacred art. How this transition was effected is not always clear. We have some idea though as to who introduced them into Christian sacred art. It included pagan sculptors who sold sarcophagi to the Christians, and pagan artists who became priests of the church during the Second to the Fourth Century.7 Many Christian artists copied older symbols or were influenced by them. Other symbols were assimiliated by official decree in religious councils. Some of the people who embraced Christianity after Constantine's Edict of Milan, 313 A.D., brought along with their devotion elements of earlier cults. As the Catholic Encyclopedia (VI, p. 12) puts it: ". . . the evil which the West felt so deeply after Constantine, that is to say, of the crowding into the church of multitudes who were only half Christianized, because it was the fashion- able thing to do ... ." Syncretism among the various religions and cults during the first few centuries of our era exerted an especially powerful influence upon Christian acceptance of symbols. Still another potent factor in the diffusion and distribution of symbols were the Roman armies, traders, travelers, and 7 "Idol-artificers are chosen even into the ecclesiastical order." Tertullian, Ante Nicene Fathers, III, p. 64. See also H. M. Kallen, Art and Freedom, New York, 1946, pp. 76-77, who throws some light on the conditions that provoked this statement. The artists of the Roman empire were banded in unions. They had their own statutes, customs and religion (Bacchic). As the empire declined the artists and craftsmen became serfs of the emperors. They were not permitted to move, or to choose any but the hereditary profession. Some could not even marry out of their occupational group. Their only way out towards freedom was to join the ranks of the Christian priesthood. Apparently so many craftsmen became priests by 365 A.D. that it was prohibited for certain crafts to join the priesthood.</page><page sequence="7">A NEW DEFINITION OF RELIGIOUS ART 137 migrants of all kinds, who exchanged ideas and symbols, as well as coins and merchandise with the peoples of Europe and Asia. There can be no doubt that this exchange of symbols existed, even though some of the paths by which this was accomplished are now obscure. The transition of these symbols into Christianity met with greatest op- position however from the eastern churches. They denounced ". .. the ignorant artist who with sacrilegious lust for gain depicts that which ought not to be depicted and with defiled hands would bestow a form upon that which ought only to be believed in the heart."8 The Latin church and its partisans in the eastern provinces emphatically affirmed the inclusion of sacred art into worship and anathematized all those opposed to it. The Second Coun- cil of Nice, in 787, vigorously condemned "those who dare to reject any of the things which are entrusted to the church,-the Gospel, or the sign of the cross, or any pictorial representation of the holy relics of a martyr."9 Byzantine opposition to sacred icons can be traced back to the early days of Christianity. In the Syriac churches this opposition evinces itself as early as the Second Century A.D. (In Greece, opposition to belief in images and their magic properties arose as early as the Sixth Century B.C. with the philosophers Heraclitus and Pythagoras. Thereafter it was a constant theme in Greek philosophy.) The subsequent struggle between Rome and Byzantium was the logical outcome of the entire Syriac attitude toward images. But Byzantine hostility extended only to the excesses of image worship which had reached in the eastern provinces the proportions of a mania. The people would grind icons into fine powder and mix them with some fluid. Then they drank the potions as medicine for the magic powers believed to be contained in them. Others would choose as godfathers for children not living persons, but sacred icons. Famous pictures of saints were washed on the feast-days of those saints; the waters sanctified by this process were sprinkled over the congrega- 8 Walter Lowrie, Art in the Early Church, p. 34. The following is a more accurate quotation from the "Epitome of the Definition of the Iconoclastic Conciliabulum" held in Constantinople, A.D. 754. "What avails, then, the folly of the painter, who from sinful love of gain depicts that which should not be depicted-that is, with his polluted hands he tries to fashion that which should only be believed in the heart and confessed with the mouth? . . . The evil custom of assigning names to the images does not come down from Christ and the Apostles and the holy Fathers; nor have these left behind any prayer by which an image should be hallowed or made anything else than ordinary matter."

In Edessa, this water was also used as a lotion for the eyes. Likewise, the water with which portraits of saints had been washed, or into which some color from the image had been scraped off, was admin- istered as a medicine to invalids. Sacred art was attacked but religious and decorative art flourished greatly in Byzantium both during and after the iconoclast controversy. "True, the Iconoclast epoch was marked by great in- tellectual and artistic progress. The Isaurian emperors were not puritanical: while proscribing the images, they loved ostentation and the worldly glamour of court life; and for the better decoration of their buildings, they encouraged a profane art inspired by ancient tradition as well as by Arab models. ... ."10 The symbols and art forms that were attacked so forcefully in the East met with little or no opposition in the West after the Fourth Century. The ecclesiastics confirmed them with new interpretations and allegories supported by scriptural passages and thus they became sacred in a relatively short time. From the Fourth Century onwards sacred art became an important factor in the western church. Nobody has expressed this with more clarity than Jacques Maritain: "Sacred art is in a state of absolute dependence upon theological wisdom . . . because the sovereign interests of the Faith are at stake in the matter, the Church exercises its authority and magistracy over sacred art."" Similarly we hear from James Cardinal Gibbons: "Why should not we make the eye the instrument of edification as the enemy makes it the organ of de- struction? Shall the pen of the artist, the pencil of the painter and the chisel of the sculptor be prostituted to the basest purposes ? God forbid! The arts were intended to be the handmaids of religion."12 As early as the Second Council of Nice it was stated that art (the perfec- tion of the work) alone belongs to the painter, while ordinance (the choice of the subject), and the disposition (treatment of the subject from the sym- bolical as well as technical or material point of view) belongs to the Fathers. At this crucial council the Bishops not only defined precisely the veneration due to images but absolutely restricted the subject matter, symbology and treatment of sacred art to ecclesiastical authority. Sacred art became fixed and dominant while religious art faded into the background. These decrees on sacred art and the subordinated role assigned to the artists gave the ecclesi- astics a free hand and removed any responsibility from the artists. The Second Council of Nice, however, was not universally recognized. Not only did the successors of Irene revert to iconoclasm but Charlemagne, 10 Charles Diehl, History of the Byzantine Empire, Princeton, 1925, p. 64. n Art and Scholasticism, New York, 1938, p. 144. 12 The Faith of Our Fathers, Baltimore, 1917, p. 208.</page><page sequence="9">A NEW DEFINITION OF RELIGIOUS ART 139 her contemporary, did not agree with or accept its decisions on sacred art. The libri carolini, which Charlemagne sent to Rome, daringly set aside the decisions of this council. In spite of the controversies and strange history sur- rounding these Caroline Books it is with great wisdom that they declare: "We permit images of the Saints to be made by whoever is so disposed, as well in churches as out of them, for the love of God and of His Saints; but never compel anyone who does not wish to do so to bow to them (adorare eas); nor do we permit anyone to destroy them, even if he should so desire."13 Where the Second Council of Nice decreed under threat of anathema and excommunication, prostration, veneration, the embracing and kissing of holy images, and reserves for itself the absolute right to "choose and dispose of" the symbols, Charlemagne's stand illustrates rationality and tolerance toward religious art. He invites beauty to enter the House of God, and offers it protection, but he discouraged superstition. In this respect Charlemagne foreshadowed the Protestant position toward art in its relationship to religion. The Reformation rejected sacred art, but at the same time it opened the way for an art of the people and for a religious art without outside interference. As John Calvin said, "Yet am I not so scrupulous as to judge that no images should be endured or suffered; but, seeing that the art of painting and carving images cometh from God, I require that the practice of art should be kept pure and lawful. . . . Therefore men should not paint nor carve any thing but such as can be seen with the eye; so that God's Majesty which is too exalted for human sight may not be corrupted by fantasies which have no true agreement therewith."'14 And Martin Luther: "Pictures, bells, eucharistic vestments, and the like I hold to be free. . ... We concede that they may be used freely, provided pomp and luxury be absent; for you please not God the more by blessing in vestments, nor the less by doing without them."15 About 850 years after the Second Council of Nice, during another great crisis, a council was evoked to define questions of dogma and sacred art. Where formerly the Byzantine emperors and their armies opposed sacred art it was challenged by the upheaval of the Protestant Reformation. Therefore, "The Council of Trent enjoins bishops and pastors to instruct their flocks that 'the holy bodies of saintly martyrs and others now living with Christ-are to be venerated by the faithful, for through these (bodies) many benefits are 1 A Select Library, XIV, p. 582. 14 G.

"And if perchance some have strayed, from their lack of knowledge in their veneration, it were better to teach such an one, rather than that the veneration of august images should be banished from the Church."17 Sacred art had acquired still another quality, not only in the eyes of the faithful but in highest ecclesiastical quarters, namely that it is "holy"". ".. . according to the Nicene Council [confirmed by the Council of Trent] there is something in the images themselves which entitles them to veneration, inasmuch as they are 'sacred objects' (res sacrae S. .) and as such must be treated with reverence."18 It is exactly this belief in the "extra something" in sacred art which the Protestants challenged and which prompted even Geremia, Bishop of Cremona to write in his Pastoral letter of 1905: "The image in itself is nothing. There is nothing superhuman or divine in it, nothing whatever. It is not to it that we pray or do reverence, it is not to it that we put our faith, but in that which it represents. For this reason the having one image or an- other, this statue or that, is a matter of indifference. Every now and then it is not so with the faithful. They want a particular image or statue and honor and venerate it more than another, although often it might be artistically in- ferior to the other, and even not decorous; yet if it is suggested to alter or re- move it somewhere else, or exchange it for a better, they all protest and cry out and oppose its removal. Is not this a sign of superstition? If they act thus because the image is dear to them, and dearer as having been reverenced by their fathers, because bound up with memories, or because it excites their devotion to a greater degree, then their conduct may be tolerated. But I am afraid that the true reason is that in their ignorance they see in it an un- definable something divine, a certain mysterious virtue, and this is a remnant of paganism and idolatry prohibited by the Council of Trent."19 This council not only reaffirmed all the decrees on sacred art formulated "1J. Pohle, Mariology, p. 155. 1A Select Library, XIV, p. 554. 1 J. Pohle, op. cit., p. 168. 19 On Religious Worship and Some Defects in Popular Devotion, London, 1906, pp. 105-106.</page><page sequence="11">A NEW DEFINITION OF RELIGIOUS ART 141 at the Second Council of Nice, but proceeding one step further, it also re- stricted the field of style, the last domain in which the artists could express themselves freely. . . images shall not be painted and adorned with a seductive charm. . ... That these things may be the more faithfully observed, the holy Council decrees that no one is permitted to erect or cause to be erected in any place or church, howsoever exempt, any unusual image unless it has been approved by the bishop."20 Whereas a schismatic northern Europe experienced its Renaissance as a result of the Reformation and, overcoming a belated Gothic, opened up the field for the discovery of itself, of nature and the people, sacred art was arrested by the decrees renewed and passed by the Council of Trent. Even though the decrees of the Council of Trent concerning sacred art are still binding within the Latin church, she reserves for herself the right to change them. "The veneration of holy images is no positive command, but the Church is free either to introduce and encourage or to limit or even pro- hibit it. .. ."21 It is clear that the artists, after the Second Council of Nice, had no voice in the important subject of sacred art. They were craftsmen in the strictest sense of the word. Up to the period of the Council of Trent there had been left to them the small area of "art" (the perfection of the work). After Trent however, even this was placed under ecclesiastic authority. The Early Christian and medieval craftsmen who became free artists during the late Gothic and early Renaissance lost their precious ground gained during the Counter-Reformation. The modern agency which supervises matters on sacred art and the ritual is the "Sacred Congregation of Rites" in Rome. This organization enforces the decrees of all the councils and synods which dealt favorably with sacred art. The recent encyclical Mediator Dei (1947) supports this tradition in paragraph 187. "First of all, you must strive that with due reverence and faith all obey the decrees of the Council of Trent, of the Roman Pontiffs, and the Sacred Congregation of Rites, and what the liturgical books ordain con- cerning external public worship." This encyclical tries to pave the way for a modern sacred art in a church whose spokesmen have traditionally preferred the Classic, the Gothic and the Baroque. "It is perhaps significant that of all this contemporary Catholic art nothing strikes us as truly artistic, save that which continues and reinterprets a traditional style."22 Such a formula for style has been given recently by the Right Reverend " E. G. Holt, Literary Sources of Art History, Princeton, 1947, pp. 243-244. * J. Pohle, Mariology, p. 1.65. * E. I.

That this large conception be in- spired with warm meaning is the second. Finally, in as much as all true greatness is linked with balance, and all real meaning with form, the art of the Church demands formal, restrained expression. A combination of early- Christian, Roman grandeur and medieval Germanic depth of feeling, crowned with the distinguished beauty of the antique--that is the ideal of religious art, an ideal which, in the consummate synthesis of form and expression, tradition and progress, assures a truly communal art."23 Unfortunately this formula is so general that it could be of little assistance to artists who might wish to follow it. In another context we find corroboration for the fact that the modern artist is expected to sacrifice his individuality and his school (style) when he creates sacred art. "It is the duty of the Christian artist to serve the Church as she should be served. Sacred art has a purpose, for its object is religious teaching by the powerfully effective means of plastic representation. The mis- sion of the artist is to lead the way in this teaching and not to betray it. This exacts from the artist the sacrifice, to a greater or less extent, of his individ- uality, of his own small rights, but if he learns to obey, and to understand the high significance of obedience--how great will be his reward! ... Cath- olic art demands sacrifice of the artist's individuality. . .. When the artist subordinates religion to his artistic imagination, taking no account of the dogmatic, liturgical and social requirements to which sacred art is necessarily subjected-it being an 'instructive art'-he falls into individualism. ... In fact and in deed, when an artist treats of sacred art he is called upon to abandon his individuality, his lonely studio, and the confines of his school."24 After the above statements were published, the encyclical Mediator Dei came out in favor of modern art in the Latin church. It invites modern art to serve dogma and faith but it subjects sacred art to the rigors of tradition and demands the cession of the artist's individuality. As paragraph 195 expresses it, ". . . Recent works of art which lend themselves to the materials of modern composition, should not be universally despised and rejected through preju- dice. Modern art should be given free scope in the due and reverent service of the church and the sacred rites, provided that they preserve a correct bal- 28 "The Nature of Religious Art," Liturgical Arts, I, No. 1, 1931, p. 6. 24 G. de Reynold, "The Mission of the Christian Artist," Modern Sacred Art, 1938 Annual, London, pp. 97-99.</page><page sequence="13">A NEW DEFINITION OF RELIGIOUS ART 143 ance between styles tending neither to extreme realism nor to excessive 'sym- bolism', and that the needs of the Christian community are taken into con- sideration rather than the particular taste or talent of the individual artist. Thus modern art will be able to join its voice to that wonderful choir of praise to which have contributed, in honor of the Catholic faith, the greatest artists throughout the centuries. Nevertheless, in keeping with the duty of Our office, We cannot help deploring and condemning those works of art, recently introduced by some, which seem to be a distortion and perversion of true art and which at times openly shock Christian taste, modesty and devo- tion, and shamefully offend the true religious sense. These must be entirely excluded and banished from our churches, like 'anything else that is not in keeping with the sanctity of the place'." More recently again the Pope singled out and condemned two modern styles on the occasion of the reception for artists at the first International Congress For Catholic Artists (Rome, September, 1950). " '... all maxims which made art fall down from its sublime role profane it and make it sterile. "Art for art's sake." As if it could exist by itself and be an end in itself, con- demned to move, to drag itself on the same plane as sensual and material things. As if through art the human sense did not obey a higher calling than that of simple appreciation of material nature.' The Pope said that 'immoral art' professes openly to 'lower and enslave the spiritual powers of the soul to carnal passions.' He added, 'for the rest, "art" and "immoral" are two words which are a contradiction in terms.' He implicitly condemned all surrealist and abstract art whose meaning is not perceived immediately by normal per- sons."25 There can be no doubt that sacred art amply defined by the Second Council of Nice, the Council of Trent and the encyclical Mediator Dei has a very particular role and function in worship and the liturgy, which is far dif- ferent from that of religious art. One seeks inspiration from without, the other from within. One is subject to authority, the other to the freedom of expression. The arts of India and those of Tibet are illustrations of "sacred art" par excellence. The deities of the Hindu, the Mahayana Buddhist and Lamaist pantheons are subject to the most exacting rules set down in Jlstras which prescribe the mudras, vahanas, attributes, proportion, and even the expres- sions of the deities in greatest detail. This sacred art of the East has been static for centuries, for these rules are faithfully obeyed by the artists and artist-monks. When the arts dedicated for religious use froze into a canon, 25 The New York Times, Sept. 6, 1950.</page><page sequence="14">144 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL further artistic and stylistic development was stopped.26 In its repetition of canonical symbols and stylistic execution of icons, sacred art has been more confined in the East than in the West. As much as there exists besides good sacred art one without religious content (mechanical repetition of traditional symbols) there exists a religious art in the West without a sacred content. Religious and sacred art, contrary to common usage, are neither synonymous nor interchangeable. These terms should be applied henceforth with greatest discrimination in order to avoid confusion at this period of renewed interest in the mutual relationship between art and religion. 26 "In the early period of the history of Indian art, the imagination of the artist was not tied down by mechanical rules, which became the base in later times. The early sculptor was guided by his own observation and imagination, and dealt with his subjects with a freedom, which made him able to produce very pleasing results. He had an eye for the beautiful as well as for the humorous, and he always gave free scope to the display of his powers, although he never forgot the religious motive behind his workmanship. . . The second and the most potent cause that has injuriously affected Indian iconoplastic art is the hard and fast rules laid down in the Agamas and the Tantras for the making of images. There is no doubt that the authors of the Agamas devoted a large amount of attention to the beauty of the human figure studied in general; and as a consequence of this they naturally laid down the proportions and measurements of the various limbs and organs of the human bodies. The belief that these measurements ought not to be disregarded under any circumstance came into vogue later on in recognition of the authority of the Agamas and the Tantras. The artist thus became handicapped, and his imagination had no freedom of action. Not much scope could be given to the display of the genius of the artist, under any cir- cumstances, although there is an Agama rule to the effect that 'the artist should fashion the image as best as he could'. . . It is not that the Hindu does not desire that the images of his gods and goddesses should be sculptured beautifully; but he will not easily tolerate any glaring departure from the rules laid down authoritatively in his Sdstras." T. A. Gopinatha Rao, Elements' of Hindu Iconography, Madras, 1914, I, part I, pp. 29-32. ("The Hindu Idstras prescribe image worship to weak unevolved persons in particular. The Jibala-upanishad distinctly asserts that the ydgin perceives Siva in his heart, and that images are meant for ignorant men. Again, the worship of images it is said brings on re-birth and is not therefore to be resorted to by the yjgin who desiries to free himself from them") op. cit., p. 27. "The statues have an opening in the lower part or back, into which prayers (mani), printed on rolls of paper are put. Statues become sacred images as soon as these prayers are ceremoniously enclosed and the opening sealed. These sacred images are identified by the differences in ornaments, the various symbolic hand gestures, called 'mudrds,' the sitting or standing positions, called ',sanas,' the thrones on which they sit, the mounts called 'vahanas,' and by the various symbols they hold. Often the symbols vary, but identification is usually possible in the more popular deities, because the old Tibetan images and paintings were made by monks or lamas according to certain rules."

Gordon, The Iconography of Tibetan Lamaism, New York, 1939, p. 7.</page><page sequence="15">A NEW DEFINITION OF RELIGIOUS ART 145 Modern religious art sprang from the decaying canon of sacred art at the close of the Gothic period. The increased power and independence of the craft guilds, together with the growing awareness of the craftsmen as creative artists, resulted in an art detached from the church. This new art had a greatly enriched vocabulary and possibilities of expression. Representations of Christ changed from canonical stiffness to much more humanized attitudes. The Madonna and Child became expressions of the maternal relationship be- tween a mother and her child. Scenes of the trades were included in stained- glass windows. Base sculptures commemorated the dignity of the crafts. Gradually the art of the church became an art of the people. Religious art, which is a free art, can dispense with the canonical symbols since it expresses deepest religiosity by psychological insight and expression alone. Religious art has emancipated itself from the fixed pattern that had been prevalent for over a millennium. The right to interpret the Lord according to the individual conscience began with the Humanism of the Renaissance and the Reformation. Many Twentieth Century artists have chosen Christ as their subject, but they express their feelings and meditations, or any other devotional theme in the light of their individual religious experience and artistic styles. These representations are not necessarily less spiritual than those that follow the definitions of sacred art. Such religious art which surely is acceptable to all people has risen to great prominence because modern artists are capable of expressing the most intense religious feelings without following the dogmatic tradition. We firmly believe that the most meaningful heritage of the past is con- tained in the figurative arts, architecture and literature. Religious feelings have always been among the most vital inspirations to art, from the cave frescoes of Cro-Magnon man to the easel paintings of many present day artists. In contrast to sacred art which is always subject to the tradition and ecclesiastical authority and decrees, Dr. Russell C. Stroup, a contemporary minister, sums up the position of the Protestants in regard to religious art. "We must not lead the artist captive bound to the chariot wheel of the Church. We must follow him as he, in turn, must follow the Spirit which 'bloweth where it listeth'. If we believe in inspiration, and I do, then to seek to circumscribe the artist is to seek to fetter God, Himself. We, of the Protes- tant church, do not believe that the Church has supreme authority. . ... Every man, but especially the artist, may as certainly interpret the will of God or be guided by the spirit of God." Only from a free religious art can we hope for a new definition of the spiritual truth in terms of art. William Blake wrote: "The world of Imagina-</page><page sequence="16">146 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL tion is the world of Eternity". This world of eternity is accessible to every artist who, when inspired ascends into the realm of intuition and even prophecy. In last analysis, the sublime is always mysterious, beyond dogmas, canons, and time. Genius transcends tradition, and all great art has something of a religious spirit in it.
