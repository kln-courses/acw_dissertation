Claire almost single-handedly discovered, excavated, and reported on a unique late fifth-early fourth millennium B.C.E. culture which she linked to the Chalcolithic period. The present volume represents Claire Epstein's long-term commitment to the archaeology of the Golan Heights which fell into Israeli hands in the aftermath of the Six- Day War in 1967. When the dust had hardly settled, Claire, then in her 50s, began her exploration of the Golan by hitchhiking from the shores of the Sea of Galilee on a weekly basis up to the basalt plateau that overlooked her home on Kibbutz Ginosar. While this is not an obituary, in reviewing The Chalcolithic Culture of the Golan, it is im- portant to keep in mind the context in which Claire Ep- stein worked-that is, virtually alone, with very limited funding mostly from the Israel Department of Antiquities (now the Israel Antiquities Authority) and with the help of a small crew of devoted Druze workmen. The book under review represents Claire's final report on some 30 years of archaeological devotion to the late prehistory of the Golan. The Chalcolithic culture of the Golan is important for many reasons. The Chalcolithic period in Palestine saw a wide range of new developments, including the first popu- lation "explosion," new achievements in agro-technology, the beginnings of metallurgy and other dimensions of craft specialization, the first distinct cemeteries separate from village settlements, and other features. Epstein's identification of a distinct Chalcolithic "culture" in the Golan should be examined in light of these sociocultural developments in the southern Levant as a whole. Epstein's surveys (Part 1) revealed some 25 sites that she divided into scattered farmsteads, small groupings of houses thought to represent extended families, hamlets with up to 15 houses, and large villages consisting of between 15 and 37 houses. Based on the excavation of approximately 9 sites and 15 surveyed sites, Epstein presents models for what are perceived to be typical settlements, houses, courtyards, cooking facilities, and other features of the Golan Chalcolithic settlement. Unlike in other regions in Palestine, the house plans in the Golan are remarkable for the many "house-chains" that are characteristic of many of the excavated sites. House-chains are series of broad- houses that often include two to six long rooms linked together in long lines. The structures usually have dimen- sions that range from 5-6 m x 15-16 m and are made of dry-wall masonry. While several beautiful aerial photo- graphs of sites of Rasm Harbush and CEin el-Hariri are presented in the beginning of the book, the architectural plans of the village excavations presented in The Chal- colithic Culture of the Golan are printed as separate sheets and placed in a pocket at the end of the book. This is a pity because these would have been more instructive if they had been presented at the beginning of each site report and superimposed on topographic isolines. Using fairly reliable ethnoarchaeological data from the Near East, Epstein gives well-considered projections concerning population estimates for the houses in seven of the most important sites she investigated. However, the total esti- mated population for each site as a whole is not addressed. This may be due to the difficulty of mapping out the limits of sites found on the basaltic soils, volcanic deposits, and boulder-strewn landscape that characterize the Golan Heights. The descriptions of the settlement excavations are ac- curate (Part 2), useful, and supplemented with overviews of the main artifacts found inside each room. Excellent photographs help contextualize many of the artifacts found in situ. Epstein is to be commended for presenting the general inventories of these materials in a qualitative format. Many excavation reports fail to outline what the contents of each excavated room actually were. These data are critical for making social reconstructions. However, for comparative studies of the Golan as well as between the Golan and other parts of the Levant, it would have been useful to list all of these data in quantitative tabular form for each site. The same can be said of the reports on the surveyed sites. There is no table listing the size of the different sites reported on in this book; nor do the maps printed as inserts situate the excavated buildings in relation to the site area as a whole. The lack of quanti- fication in this volume for pottery (Part 4) and ground- stone (Part 5) is more a reflection of the culture-historical tradition of archaeological research in which Epstein was trained many years ago. These data are presumably avail- able for review should a future researcher want to study these aspects of the Golan Chalcolithic excavations. An important exception to the quantification problem noted above is Epstein's treatment of the spectacular assemblage of basalt "pillar figures" identified from the Golan Chalcolithic sites (Part 5). These are large (approx. 15-20 cm high) anthropomorphic figures (heads) that usu- ally have large nose features, a bowl-like depression on the top of the head, and sometimes contain additional fa- cial features such as eyes, hair, beards, or horns. In Part 5 of the book, an extremely useful table (p. 232) is pre- sented which quantifies the distribution of pillar figures by excavated site for the Golan. A total of some 50 of these enigmatic figures have been recorded in both excavated (N = 43) and uncertain contexts (N = approx. 7). Accord- ing to Epstein (p. 230), pillar figures were "present in many households, sometimes two-and as many as five- statues being found in the same house." Most scholars ac- cept the cultic/ritual significance of the pillar figures. In</page><page sequence="2">2001 BOOK REVIEWS 83 many of Epstein's writings, these objects are consistently linked to a domestic cult. However, with the new data pre- sented in this book, other hypotheses can now be sug- gested and tested. It is now possible to see that the majority of the pillar figures have been found at three sites: Site 12 with 44% (Rasm Harbush, N = 19), Site 21 (Daliyyot Waterfall) with 18.6% (N = 8), and Site 20 (CEin el-Hariri) with 14% (N = 6). The remaining seven sites with in situ pillar figures have from one to two samples each. When this distribution pattern is considered with re- gard to the Chalcolithic settlement pattern on the Golan, these three sites with the majority of pillar figures clus- ter around tributaries leading to Wadi Daliyyot. While difficult to determine based on the published record pre- sented here, it seems that Rasm Harbush is the largest of the sites in the Golan settlement pattern and perhaps some kind of regional center. Thus, there is a fall-off in the dis- tribution of the pillar figures from Rasm Harbush, a site that seems to be the central polity in the Golan Chal- colithic settlement complex. This is only a cursory ob- servation. However, as indicated here, the potential for investigating the relationships among ritual, socioecon- omy, and settlement are certainly present in this book. A closer look at the links among excavation sample size, site size, and the quantified inventories of the Golan sites will provide an important basis for testing whether there were indeed regional cults in the Golan Chalcolithic versus domestic cults. The late prehistorian, Tamar Noy, presents an excellent study of the chipped stone industry found at the Golan Chalcolithic sites. Noy reports on some 8,500 flint items from eight sites. These quantitative studies present both typological and attribute analyses of the assemblages. There is an in-depth examination of the rather unique "perforated star-shaped tools" that first became known, in small quantities, from work done by J. Nasrallah in the Hauran in the 1940s. The presentation of the data is superb. There are concise definitions for each of the identified tool types, the highest quality of flint drawings, and the numerical data alluded to above. This makes for an ideal chipped stone report that can easily be used for comparative studies by other scholars. The relative small size of the lithic assemblages for the sites reported on here (Sites 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22) may indicate a lack of sieving during the excavation process at these sites. There are four short appendixes in this book devoted to an analysis of charred wood and seed samples by N. Liph- schitz, Y. Waisel, and M. Hopf; faunal remains by S. Davis and C. Grigson, 14C dates by I. Carmi and D. Se- gal, and petrography by N. Porat. While not explicitly stated, the small sample size of cereal grains Triticum dicoccum (emmer wheat) and Triticum monococcum (ein- korn wheat) and the lack of reportage on weed species indicate that no specific sampling for palaeobotanical re- mains or flotation took place at the Golan excavations. Similarly, the very tiny sample of faunal remains (N = some 60 identifiable bones) from the five sites reported on may indicate that these materials were either not collected or almost totally absent from the sites. Six radiocarbon dates from three sites (12, 18, 21) are presented which place the Golan Chalcolithic sites in the main and later phases of the period. Petrographic and X-ray diffraction studies of four pottery sherds from Site 12 show that they were manufactured with local clays most likely from the wadis adjacent to the site. While these specialist studies are all based on extremely small sample sizes, they point to two factors that must be borne in mind when assess- ing the book: (1) the author had very little institutional support to carry out specialist studies, and (2) there is a tremendous potential for further characterization and specialist studies to clarify the socioeconomic dynamics of the Golan Chalcolithic. Simply put, the Golan is ripe for one or more new Ph.D. theses that will explore these avenues of research. In conclusion, this is an extremely important reference book that presents much of the hard data that characterizes the Chalcolithic culture of the Golan Heights. While there is a lack of quantified analyses of the material culture as- semblages, the descriptive data is presented in a clear, concise, and well-illustrated format that provides signifi- cant comparative source material that can be readily used by scholars working on the late fifth-fourth millennium B.C.E. throughout the Levant. Claire Epstein's devotion to the study of the Chalcolithic period in the Golan resulted in the preservation of many of these important localities. The book is truly a labor of love carried out by one of Israel's remarkable field archaeologists. Thomas E. Levy University of California, San Diego tlevy @weber.ucsd.edu</page></plain_text>
