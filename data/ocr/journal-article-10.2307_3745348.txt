<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHICAL SURVEY PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY Summary: This survey first deals with German Philosophy in the Twentieth Century and Forms of Thought, both by Hans Leisegang. It then summarizes Theodor Ziehen1 s Foundations of the Philosophy of Religion. Next it refers to a revised edition of Hermann Cohen*s Religion of Reason, and to two small books by Louis Anderson. Finally some shorter announcements of other new books, including Hans ReichenbacKs Philosophy of the Space-Time Theory, which Einstein has praised, Nicolai Hartmann's Hegel, and a new edition of Bolzano's Theory of Science. There has recently appeared a very useful little book on German Philosophy in the Twentieth Century,1 by Hans Leisegang, Professor of Philosophy in the University of Leipzig. It deals with a great many philosophers; it puts each in his proper pigeon-hole, and it provides bibliographies and even photographs. It also makes plain the vigour and extent of contemporary German philosophy and the large number of separate schools. The expositions are necessarily brief, but they clearly show the aims of each philosopher and the influences that have affected him. The book is divided into three main parts. The first is devoted to scientific philosophies, like vitalism, neo-Kantianism and phenomenology; the second to philosophies of life, like those of Keyserling and Simmel; the third to philosophies of culture, like those of Windelband, Rickert and Dilthey. In the first section of Part I the change from materialism to vitalism is considered. In 1910 Wilhelm Ostwald became the leader of the Monistenbund, which Haeckel had founded in 1906. He holds that nothing but energy exists. Life and consciousness are special forms of energy which interact with all other forms. Ostwald, however, is more optimistic than most devotees of energy, for he believes that its despotism is beneficent, and that science will do every thing which men have vainly asked of God. But as the materialism of Haeckel has been followed by energism, so it has also been followed by vitalism. Leisegang has little sympathy with the vitalism of Hans Driesch. He accuses him of veiling the fiction of entelechy in the reprehensible expres? sion Ganzheitscausalitdt (causality of the whole); and he dislikes his depre- ciation of history and his interest in occultism. But Leisegang mentions many other vitalists, like Erich Becher, who believe that only a super- individual, spiritual being can give to organic nature the purposiveness, which, in their view, it undoubtedly exhibits. Most of them draw a sharp distinction between the inorganic world, which is subject to causality, and the organic world, which, they hold, is ordered teleologically. But William Stern and Friedrich Kottje aim at showing that the two worlds are continuous. The second section is concerned with neo-Kantianism and other forms of idealism and with neo-scholasticism. The 'Back to Kant' cry, which arose towards the end of the nineteenth century, has led to the Marburg School of Hermann Cohen and Paul Natorp. This school has its own paper, Kant- studien, and its own organization, the Kantgesellschaft. The fundamental principle of the neo-Kantians, as of Kant, is that thought creates its own objects. Mathematics, which consists only of self-evident premises and what is deducible from them, is the exemplary science. Cohen, who died in 1918, was a very rigid rationalist, whose methods have been extensively applied 1 Deutsche Philosophie im XX Jahrhundert. Breslau: Ferdinand Hirt. 1928. Pp. 152. Price RM. 3.50. 105</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES by Ernst Cassirer.1 In ethics he thought that justice is the fundamental concept, and that Christianity has obscured moral concepts by basing morality on our love for others instead of on their rights. Natorp, who died in 1924, was less rigid, for, says Leisegang, although he first studied Plato because he saw him as a neo-Kantian, he gradually became influenced by the real Plato. In this section Leisegang also refers to Rudolf Eucken and the inspiration he drew from Fichte's faith in the supreme status of moral activity. He concludes by pointing a contrast in the philosophical views of contemporary German theologians. On the one hand, many protestant theologians have allied themselves with the neo-Kantians?Ernst Troeltsch, for example, introduced the notion of a priori religious principles. Catholic theologians, like Clemens Baumker and Joseph Geyser,* on the other hand, go back to the Schoolmen, and especially to Saint Thomas Aquinas. In the third section of Part I Leisegang deals with the positivists, who base themselves on Hume and the English utilitarians, and stress the objective constituent in the subject-object unity. He regards Mach and Hans Vaihinger as the most important members of this school. Mach analysed the common- sense world into sensations whose nature is jointly determined by the body, the mind and physical objects. The self, for him, consisted of successive sensations, and its unity was a fiction constructed for economy of thought. Thought, which he considered biologically, was a tool for dealing with the mass of sensations. Vaihinger's philosophy3 is also closely connected with this view of thought. The mind, he says, created thought, and thought created fictions. A fiction is a hypothesis, known to be false but used for the sake of attaining a legitimate end. Vaihinger puts forward as examples Adam Smith's view that men are wholly selfish; the chemists' view that the ultimate constituents of matter are atoms of a certain weight, and his own view that we should live as if there were a God and we were free. In the last section of this part Leisegang deals with philosophies based on psychology and with phenomenology. The first, he says, was that of Wundt, who founded his psychology on physiology, introspection and experiment and advocated psycho-physical parallelism. Psychological processes, he held, have their own laws, and among them is the 'creative synthesis' which combines psychological elements into new wholes. Wundt believed that this synthesis is an act of will and the fundamental factor in all living organisms. This view developed into the philosophical outlook of voluntarism. Leisegang also refers briefly to psycho-analysis, autosuggestion and spiritualism. He praises psycho-analysis for its fine discrimination of mental facts and con? demns it for its mechanical conception of the unconscious. In connexion with spiritualism he quotes Christian Bry's opinion that, if spiritistic phenomena, are real, they are certainly supersensible but also senseless. Leisegang doubts the success of attempting to base philosophy on psychology. The psychologist, he says, is so absorbed in explaining that he ceases to evaluate. The section concludes with a reference to Edmund Husserl and other phenomenologists. These philosophers are all vigorous opponents of Psychologismus, as they call the extension of psychology to logic, ethics and other studies. But, as we have seen in previous surveys,4 in their attempt to discover what is essential in the world, they study external objects bf minutely analysing the mind's awareness of them. ?

I06</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHICAL SURVEY Part II deals with an entirely different type of outlook, which, as Leisegang says, has almost nothing in common with that of academic philosophy. The philosophers here considered have developed along the line which began with Goethe and led through Schelling, Schopenhauer and Nietzche. They are many, and include such well-known names as Spengler, Keyserling and Simmel. Their outlook is romantic and mystical, their writings are unsyste- matic. They distrust science. They believe that reasoning and inductive generalization are of little account, and that every discovery of importance is due to intuition. Their standpoint is aristocratic in that almost all of them divide mankind by some principle into the creative or saved and the imitative or damned. Every philosopher takes it for granted, observes Leisegang, that he himself is one of the creators, and it is comforting to know that it is possible to rise from the lower to the higher group. Leisegang vigorously seconds Rickert's contention that philosophies of life are bound to be false if they try, as they often do, to evaluate everything in terms of health and disease. It must be realized that life is not the highest value, and the aim should be to find the connexion between mere living and good living. The acknowledgment of this aim has led many of these philosophers to remedy their neglect of science. They have investigated the nature, growth and decay of culture and the philosophy of history. They emphatically maintain that the truth of history does not lie in its correspondence with facts. To reach truth the historian must lose his own self and absorb the character of his subject. Then he can use the subject's standard of values and write from its point of view. He needs intuition similar to the artist's. He must know neither good nor evil, neither truth nor falsehood. This type of historian, Leisegang thinks, is found in Oswald Spengler, from whose morphology of cultures the principle of causality is eliminated. Each culture is an organism which blossoms, flowers and decays. It was desire for such understanding?to see, for example, the Indians as they see themselves? that led to Keyserling's travel diary. The finest, profoundest and most conscious work in pursuit of this ideal has been done, says Leisegang, by the poet Stefan George and his circle. This work includes Gundolf's books on Shakespeare, Goethe, Kleist and George. Art naturally has a very impor? tant place in the scheme of these philosophers. According to Keyserling, metaphysics, so long thought to be "the driest and most abstract of sub? jects"?"the quintessence of boredom"?is really an art. The philosopher, he says, expresses himself in concepts, the musician in sounds; but the purpose of both is the same. Art, of course, is not imitation of nature; it is an excellent way of knowing reality. In fact, not only is metaphysics art, but art is metaphysics. Finally, the complete man must, in the view of these philosophers, have not only science and art, both based on intuition, but also religion. And the religion which is the summit of culture is impossible without science and art. Philosophies of life are influential, says Leisegang, because they appeal to the many who desire religion, but not in its traditional forms. The philosophers whom Leisegang groups together in Part III are interested in cultural values. Those of the South-West School set out to construct purely formal systems of values. Wilhelm Windelband's aim was to find the a priori foundations of history as Kant found those of natural science. History consists of events selected because of their value as measured by a system of values. These values are a priori and are deducible, in the Kantian sense, from the three functions of the human mind, thought, conation and feeling. They are truth, goodness and beauty. Hugo Munsterberg1 also deduces an ? Cf. this Journal, vol. iii, pp. 89 ff. IO7</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES a priori system of values, but he regards conation as fundamental. It is through human action that the world derives its value. Our will that the world should be valuable guarantees its value, and all the individual values are derived from our various demands. Heinrich Rickert,1 a pupil of Windel- band, distinguishes six kinds of value: truth, beauty, impersonal holiness, morality, happiness and personal holiness. Other philosophers, of whom Scheler% was the first, objected to the a priori formalism of these systems. Among them is Nicolai Hartmann, who urges that values are external to us, and that a special capacity is required for their apprehension. It is the misfortune of individuals and states that they fail to recognize each other's value. The philosopher should enlighten them. According to Wilhelm Dilthey, the ideal of all the mental sciences is that understanding by which we know conscious objects by entering into their experiences. To obtain an all-round understanding of the history of philosophy, Dilthey divides philosophical systems into various types, each of which is the outcome of its creator's onesidedness. The truth is to be found in a synthesis of the various systems, and it should be the aim of everyone to understand the systems of others. Such understanding is not mere knowing and has practical effects. Hence, concludes Leisegang, such understanding is very important in these days, when there is so much conflict in every sphere. We are not asked to give up our own view, but we must understand the views of others. Leisegang has also recently made a contribution to philosophy of his own. The main thesis of his Forms of Thought 3 is that there are a number of different logics, each arising from a special kind of material, and each giving rise to a special kind of outlook. Each logic has its own fundamental laws which determine the validity of the thought which it governs. We are most familiar with rationalistic logic, with its laws of identity, contradiction and excluded middle, and its proof by syllogism. We therefore condemn as fantastic nonsense many propositions which break these laws. But this condemnation may be mistaken and due to our inability to understand the laws of the logic which governs the propositions we condemn. For example, says Leisegang, the statement "I am the way, the truth and the life," if judged by rationalistic logic, is clearly false. Such statements as "out of all one, and out of one all" puzzle us. But our condemnation and bewilderment indicate that we have not discovered the appropriate logic. Forms of Thought was written to help the understanding of alien thought, and the author is more anxious to defend his method than the actual distinctions between forms of thought which he himself draws. 'Thought-form'?Denkform?is the expression Leisegang uses for the structure of a logic; and the method to be used in discovering such forms is inductive examination of thoughts as expressed in different writings. His book illustrates his method by applying it to different writings; it also gives the classification of thought-forms which he reaches. Many writings are examined; the examples cited below are only selections. The first thought-form considered is called the thought-circle. It is to be found in Herakleitos, Saint Augustine, Bruno, Goethe and a host of others. It is the typical form of mystical speech. Its structure is circular, because the first concept leads through other concepts back to itself. It is produced by the world of spirit and life, where seed leads to organism and organism to seed. The concepts in the thought-circle are not related to each other as 1 Cf. this Journal, vol. ii, pp. 85 ff. 3 Ibid., vol. iv, pp. 387-90. 3 Denkformen. Walter de Gruyter: Berlin. 1928. Pp. 457. Price RM. 20. 108</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHICAL SURVEY genus to species but as opposites. Among writings closely considered are those of Herakleitos and Saint Paul, which, Leisegang says, cannot be understood unless they are recognized to exhibit this thought-form. [But are those who apply rationalistic logic to the Epistle to the Romans bound to say, as Leisegang says they are, that, in arguing from the sin of Adam to the sin of all men, Saint Paul merely committed the elementary fallacy of inferring a universal conclusion from a particular premise?] The "circle of circles," to which Leisegang devotes a whole chapter, was the thought-form used by Hegel. In Hegel a thought-circle has only three constituents, none of which can have a place in any other circle. But each circle is itself a constituent of a larger circle. Hence arises the circle of circles. Of rationalistic logic the thought-form is the pyramid of concepts. It is constructed by dividing a concept into those which fall under it. This thought-form is derived from mathematics and is quite appropriate to mathematical concepts, for it can exhaust their content. But it is inappro? priate to other material. For, although it may bring order into a chaotic mass of individuals, it entirely fails to disclose their essence. Leisegang therefore condemns any attempt to understand the whole universe by this rationalistic form, and he regards some of the Platonic dialogues as the best examples of such fruitless attempts. Plato mistakenly believed that the world is ordered as the pyramid of concepts is ordered, and this belief was shared not only by the neo-Platonists but also by Aristotle and the Schoolmen. Hence their horror both of an infinite regress and of continuity. Hence, too, puzzles like those of Zeno. Leisegang believes that Kant's important contribution to thought-forms was that he showed that the pyramid of concepts is but a scheme of order superimposed upon the world by our reason. He did not realize any more than his predecessors that there are other thought-forms which his arguments do not touch. The value of understanding, so Leisegang concludes, has only recently been realized. When we look at the history of philosophy, what strikes us most is that different philosophers are always making incompatible state? ments. Some explanation is required. We may be sceptical and hold that we cannot choose between these conflicting views. Or we may believe in the Hegelian circle which leads from conflict to synthesis. Leisegang finds neither of these answers at all satisfactory, but thinks that the distinction between thought-forms solves the problem. Thought-forms are adequate only to the material from which they arise, and philosophical conflict is due to ignoring this fact. The rationalists accuse the mystics of obscurity, and the mystics accuse the rationalists of superficiality. Leisegang would do justice to both. The Foundations of the Philosophy of Religion,1 by Theodor Ziehen, Professor of Philosophy in the University of Halle, is mainly a short and interesting survey of the religious elements in various philosophical systems. But it also alludes to the philosophical elements in various religious systems. Every religion, even the most primitive, contains, according to Ziehen, some philosophy. It is instructive, for example, to compare the early Indians with the Jews. Among the former we find philosophic doubts about many things, including the nature of God, whereas the Old Testament is relatively unphilosophic. Ziehen considers the question whether the God of philosophy is also the God of religion, and whether, if there be a difference, it is funda? mental. The God of religion, he says, is vaguely conceived, but that He is personal and transcendent is invariably believed. In some philosophies, like * Die Grundlagen der Religionsphilosophie. Felix Meiner: Leipzig. 1928. Pp. 166. Price RM. 3.80. 109</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES those of Aristotle, Leibniz and Kant, God possesses these characteristics; in others, however, like those of Plotinus, Spinoza and Fichte, He does not. Ziehen does not himself believe that the existence of a personal, transcendent God can be plausibly maintained. He finds all the alleged proofs of His existence unconvincing, and criticizes the various philosophical modifications of the view. The weakness of the view is most glaring, he thinks, when we consider the facts of evil, and in so far as Leibniz's attempt to reconcile God with evil is especially thorough its failure is especially marked. In Ziehen's view, if the conception of God is to be retained at all, philosophy must be allowed to change it radically. This is of course what it has frequently done. We get the various mystical conceptions of God, which Ziehen discusses at length, and the pantheism of Spinoza. But the mystical conception of God suffers from lack of ascertainable content, and Ziehen holds that the same is true of Spinoza's conception. He allows that Spinoza's conception of God has some resemblance to that of religion, in that God alone has absolute value, and for us at least is transcendent. Kant's view, though untenable, has the great merit of basing religion on ethics. Fichte goes a great deal further and identities God with the moral law. Comte, although founding his view almost entirely on the data of natural science, yet sees in humanity an object of religious worship. But Ziehen is not disposed to deify humanity. The anthropomorphic error, he thinks, is more glaring in Comte's system than in orthodox religions. It is essential that an object of worship should transcend man and his little world. In quite recent times there have been approximations to the mystical view; for example, by Rudolf Otto and Max Scheler, who lay emphasis on contact with God through intuition of His essence. The last chapter contains Ziehen's own solution of the problem?which he describes as nomotheism. He has already asked whether such purpose as there is in the world can be explained without the hypothesis of a personal creator. He now answers that it can, but that the explanatton leaves us with a God, though a very much modified one. Fichte, we have seen, identified God with the moral law. Ziehen identifies Him with the totality of laws. This identification, he contends, allows to God many of the qualities which are traditionally attributed to Him. God remains omnipotent, one, timeless and omnipresent?though of course in a somewhat different sense. This view is free from anthropomorphism, and yet avoids the emptiness of the mystical conception. There are, he says, three different kinds of laws: logical laws, which are quite independent of human thought; causal laws; and epigenetic laws, which determine the parallelism between mental and bodily events and include the laws of value. These three sets of laws constitute God. He considers two objections to his view: that it deprives God of holiness and that the name 'God' rightly belongs only to a person. He answers, first, that laws have the same claim to holiness as a personal God, and he cites Kant's reverence for the moral law; secondly, that philosophy has the right to transform concepts and give words new meanings. It is true, he concludes, that most men are unable to feel amor intellectualis Dei, and it will be necessary for them to personify the object of their worship and to substitute a law- giver for the laws. Ziehen thinks it quite permissible to know God as the totality of laws and yet to feel towards Him as towards a person. The past year has seen a second edition, revised by Bruno Strauss, of The Religion of Reason,1 by Hermann Cohen, whom we have mentioned * Religion der Vernunft. J. Kauffman: Frankfurt am Main. 1929. Pp. 629. Price, RM. 18 s 110</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHICAL SURVEY above. The author's general principle that reason alone is the source of all our concepts is here applied to religion. Religion consists of concepts; it is therefore the product of reason and has the characteristics of any knowledge rationally acquired. Hence no historical inquiry into religion can be merely inductive. History reveals the various forms in which rational religion has been manifested, and Cohen believes that in Judaism it was manifested best. What Judaism is and why it occupies this eminence are what this long book sets out to show. In his two books, The Logical? and The Soul and Conscience, Louis &gt; Anderson advocates an axiological explanation of the world?an explana? tion in which values are the fundamental factors. There are three kinds of substance, metapsychical, psychical and natural; and the laws on which the existence of the world depends are laws of value derived from the meta? psychical substance. In The Logical he distinguishes between logical source, logical process and logical effect, and he applies this three-fold division everywhere, with a neatly ordered universe as the result. The metapsychical substance is the logical source of the world; and the categories, which he discusses at length, fit into the all-pervading pattern. In The Soul and Conscience his three-fold division is applied to the human mind. Chief place is given to the will and conscience. The latter both reveals the metapsychical order and is the soul's attitude towards it. The laws of this order are the laws of worth, of truth and of love, and the psychologist who desires more than superficial results must study the soul as the product of these laws. Among other books on logic is the Logic 3 of Akos von Pauler, Professor of Philosophy in the University of Budapest, who attempts to base a logical system on three fundamental propositions. There is also a short essay on So-called Analytic and Synthetic Judgments,4 by Walter Dubislav, who maintains that the distinction exists only among subject-predicate proposi? tions. In Dubislav's view, a judgment is analytic in relation to a system of presuppositions if it is deducible from it by presupposed principles. An important book on philosophical questions raised by physics is The Philosophy of Space-Time Theory,S by Hans Reichenbach, Professor in the University of Berlin, who bases a space-time theory on his own analysis of causality. Among historical books are several on Kant and Hegel. In his Commentary on Kant's Main Writings in Ethics and the Philosophy of Religion,6 August Messer,7 Professor of Philosophy at Giessen, seeks to overcome the diffi? culties which arise in these writings through Kant's obscurity of expression. i Das Logische, seine Gesetze und Kategorien Felix Meiner.

Nicolai Hartmann, Professor of Philosophy at Cologne, has just published a book on Hegel*', he had previously published, in the same series, a volume on Fichte, Schelling and the Romantics. From Mysticism to Baroque: 1400-1600,3 by Wolfgang Stammler, deals with all the personalities of the period. It contains many notes on sources and a very full list of names and dates. Among less technical works are The English Conception of Freedom,* by Rudolf Henne, and The Philosophy of Films,5 by Rudolf Harms. In the former, freedom is taken to be the absence of compulsion. In England, says Henne, the rights of free individuals are not catalogued, but there is a strong consciousness of freedom, which is mainly due to the substitution of social for legal restraints. In The Philosophy of Films Harms considers films historically, technically, sesthetically and ethically. He also reviews the relevant literature. We may note, in conclusion, that The Theory of Science* by Bernard Bolzano, is being republished in four volumes, under the supervision of Wolfgang Schultz, who has added a list of the authors quoted. Bolzano has greatly influenced Edmund Husserl, who first revealed his merits. His works are of special interest to those who hold that the subject-matter of logic is independent of thought.
