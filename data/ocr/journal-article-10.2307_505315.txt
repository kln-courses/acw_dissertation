<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PARTHIAN PERIOD, by M.A.R. Colledge. (Icono- graphy of Religions 14:3.) Pp. xiii + 26; ills. 17; pls. 48. E.J. Brill, Leiden 1986. G 84 M.A.R. Colledge's contribution to the Iconography of Religions series, The Parthian Period, consists of 26 pages of text and 48 well-selected plates accompanied by a detailed catalogue of illustrations. The text includes a historical in- troduction and brief essays on religions, religious and funer- ary art and architecture, and religion in the Parthian Em- pire according to its figured monuments. The section on art provides an admirable statement of the limitations of our knowledge of "Parthian art." The attempt to synthesize the religious beliefs of a domain which covered a wide geo- graphical area (extending at least from eastern Syria through Iran and into south Russia), included a number of peoples, and lasted for some 500 years inevitably leads to the presentation of a complex picture in a rather schematic form. This inevitable difficulty is exacerbated by Colledge's decision to include the religions of India as well, where he introduces a rather simplistic opposition between "polythe- istic Hinduism" and a "more humanistic and spiritual" Buddhism. In the Parthian world, where many religions co- exist, leading to syncretism and blending of originally sepa- rate beliefs and deities, scholarly interpretations are bound to differ. Colledge does a commendable job of differentiating what is known from what is only conjectured, but the lack of footnotes (which is standard for this series) will leave a read- er unfamiliar with the literature at a loss about where to go for further discussion. The inclusion of principal biblio- graphical sources in the detailed captions to the illustrations partially alleviates this problem. The section entitled "Religion in the Parthian Empire According to Its Figured Monuments" is organized accord- ing to the three main sources of religious belief: Iranian, Se- mitic, and Greek, with an additional section on religions outside the Parthian Empire. Within each of the three main headings are further subdivisions: myth and legend, reli- gious practices, anthropomorphic deities, other objects of worship, and divine attributes. For most subjects, references to several illustrations are given, and it is often difficult to pinpoint the precise point of reference. An example is the identification of Artemis and Poseidon (Elq6nera ?) in one of the reliefs from the temple of Bel at Palmyra (pl. 38b). Col- ledge's categorization tends to obscure the equivalence be- tween deities who appear in both a Greek and a Semitic form, e.g., Nebo, who is represented at Dura in the guise of Apollo Citharoedus. That the same images illustrate several points may not be .pparent to a reader unfamiliar with the monuments. The sections on animals include animals as ob- jects of worship (the eagle at Hatra), as divine attributes (lions of Atargatis), mounts, and even in forms such as the lion skin of Herakles and lion-head architectural orna- ments. To me, this kind of listing (which Colledge has used in other studies) blurs important distinctions. This volume has value as a highly condensed synthesis of information and for illustrations otherwise available only in widely scattered publications. Many of the faults are en- demic to the format of the series. SUSAN B.
