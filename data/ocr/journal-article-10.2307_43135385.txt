<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Review The Prehistoric Rock Art of Morocco: A Study of its Extension, Environment and Meaning. By Susan Searight. BAR International Series 1310, 2004, 246 pp., ISBN 1-84171-659-6. Price £36.00. When the editors of this journal asked me to write a review on S. Searight's book, I was very interested to know what she had found out about Morocco's prehistoric rock art in its entirety. Abrief overview had been given before in a catalogue established by A. Simoneau (Catalogue 1977). In recent years, several authors have concentrated on regional studies (e.g. Kaache 1999; Rodrigue 1999; Heckendorf 2004). S. Searight's treatise is based on her Ph.D. thesis, which was accepted in March 2001 by the Department of Conservation Sciences of Bournemouth University (UK). Her objective is to examine all aspects of Moroc- can rock art and to place it into an archaeological and environmental context. Considering the overall state of research on rock art, prehistoric settlement and envi- ronmental change in Morocco, these aims seem to be highly ambitious. In the introduction, the author places her study of Moroccan rock art into the wider scheme of her- itage-conservation. The term "rock art" is to be used as a simple way of discussing the images in question, independently of any aesthetic appreciation. Quoting internationally recognized rock-art researchers (e.g. R. Bradley, W. Davies, K. H. Striedter), she repeatedly stresses that rock art provides information on "non material phenomena", that it is important for the "re- construction of prehistoric values", and as a "me- dium for a wider study of prehistoric society". Deplor- ably, the actual potentialities of the application of these notions to the rock art under study are not put into concrete terms. Nevertheless, in the face of in- creasing man-made destruction, there is no doubt that there is an urgent need for systematic survey and complete recording of the Moroccan rock art sites. Part I (Chapter 1-5) is meant to place Moroccan rock art into its general setting. In Chapter 1 (Aims and methods), eleven aims of the study are specified and nine approaches to achieve these aims are enumerated. For the purpose of the enquiry, Morocco has been di- vided into nine main zones. Their delimitations are il- lustrated on two identical maps (Fig. 2 and Fig. 50). The description of their geographical features (appen- dix 1) was done without taking notice of some relevant geographical literature (e.g. Despois &amp; Raynal 1967; Le Houérou 1990; Müller-Hohenstein &amp; Popp 1990). Moreover, there is no clear definition of key terms, such as "pre-Sahara". Furthermore, Fig. 51 (page 182) has been doubled and the descriptions of zones 3-6, which would be on page 181, are incomplete or miss- ing (at least in my copy). This is regrettable, as the major part of the rock art known in Morocco is situated in these zones. In preparation for the fieldwork, the available information about the rock art sites was re- corded on individual data-sheets (Fig. 3). A single "site" was defined either as one listed as such by A. Simoneau (Catalogue 1977), who has never explained his site-concept, or as a unit which is separated by at least 500 m from any other. Unfortunately, these defi- nitions do not allow for any analysis of the position of rock art sites in the prehistoric landscape as intended in subsequent chapters of the study (Chapters 7 and 13). It goes without saying that S. Searight's deserv- ing fieldwork in the remote mountains and deserts of Morocco took often place under extremely difficult cir- Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 3 (2), 2005 305</page><page sequence="2">Book Review cumstances. About one half of the known sites have been visited in the field. Four sites were considered to be representative of the four main rock art groups dis- tinguished by her and have been studied in detail (Chapter 8). There is no particular reason to contest the author's notion that the rock art had a purpose and a meaning, or that the engravers had seen the animals and objects they depicted. Nonetheless, it is quite il- logical to assume on the one hand that the animal im- ages did not necessarily represent the full range of the living fauna, and on the other hand that the frequency of depiction of one species against another corre- sponds to their real proportions in the contemporary environment. Chapter 2 (Previous research on Moroccan rock art) consists merely of an enumeration of the "who is who" and "who found what" throughout the Kingdom in the last 130 years or so. Decidedly, it would have been more interesting to discuss the classificatory concepts that were applied to Moroccan rock art in the past and the interpretations that were advanced by the different authors involved. By do- ing so, it would have become clear to what (large!) ex- tent S. Searighťs own conceptions are committed to them. Chapter 3 (Holocene climate and flora) regards the reconstruction of climatic change during the Holocene in North Africa and the Sahara in general, and in Mo- rocco in particular. The author assumes that these changes had indirectly affected the distribution of rock art sites and are reflected to a certain extent in the rock art. Again, it would have been profitable to con- sider a larger choice of the relevant literature (e.g. Lauer &amp; Frankenberg 1980; Fontes &amp; Gasse 1989; Hooghiemstra et al. 1992; Nehren 1992a: 26, Abb. 6; Adams &amp; Faure 1995). Besides, the particular difficul- ties that impede climatic reconstruction in the area un- der study should have been taken more seriously. Even today, climatic variety is a dominant characteris- tic of the Maghreb, and especially of Morocco. This is due to the peculiarities of its orographic structure and the specificities of its north-south and east-west extension, which did not change very much during the Holocene. In Chapter 4 (An outline of the Prehistory of Morocco), the author is trying her hand at an exami- nation of Morocco's prehistory. This quite incomplete overview suffers from the neglect of some older, but thoroughly prepared and therefore still not outdated compilations, such as those presented by D. Grébénart (1997) and by R. Nehren (1992). In the review of radiocarbon dates for Neolithic sites, some relevant articles published in J. Evin et al. (1999) were also omitted. The contributions that were made particularly by G Souville (1959, 1965, 1968) on the subject of pre-Islamic tombs and monuments in Morocco are likewise ignored. Additionally, the ori- gins of the drawings that were put together in Fig. 5 and which show copper and bronze items that were found in Morocco are not indicated. Chapter 5 (Neolithic and later fauna as revealed by excavations and texts) contains a list of animals that were either mentioned by ancient authors or iden- tified in archaeological excavations only in North Mo- rocco. In this account, the judicious archaeo-zoologi- cal observations that have resulted from B. Ouchaou's (2000) study of the excavated faunai re- mains from archaeological sites in northern Morocco are left out. A discussion of the evidence concerning the introduction of domesticated animals is given in Chapter 10. Part II (Chapter 6-9) concerns the rock art and the rock art sites. In Chapter 6 (Themes represented in Moroccan rock art), the themes that were found on the sites are listed and the inventory of engraved animals is compared to the faunai evidence from archaeologi- cal excavations (Chapter 5). A proper thematic analy- sis would have necessitated a systematic classifica- tion of the rock art motifs and a survey of the part each motif has in the total number of engravings of the rock art sites under study. At present, the overall state of research on site composition clearly does not per- mit any well-founded statistical investigation. Aston- ishingly, the author considers that, in view of the vari- ability of the contents of the rock art sites in the dif- ferent zones (Chapter 7), such an exercise would not be very useful (page 47). There is also no clear defini- tion of key concepts, such as "scene". In addition, the animal species are only named on a general level and some determinations are dubious. To give two evident examples, a pecked cattle engraving with a forward pointing horn was identified as "barbary sheep" (Fig. 19c) and two polished lion drawings were classified as "monkeys" (Fig. 37a). Anyway, as a result of her re- view, the author believes to have demonstrated that the people responsible for the rock art were interested in material objects (chariots, trapping equipment, weap- ons) and that they were preoccupied with animals as 306 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 3 (2), 2005</page><page sequence="3">Book Review a source of food or danger (page 55). Her comparison between animal images and faunai remains leads to the amazing conclusion that "antelopes (including ga- zelles) were the most eaten and the most engraved" (page 54). Chapter 7 (Review of Moroccan rock art sites) is about the main characteristics of the 290 rock art sites that the author has located within the nine geographi- cal zones. On the whole, the account covers the situ- ation, size and contents of the sites and any archaeo- logical material that was noticed in their vicinity. The perfunctory descriptions are illustrated by roughly sketched site-distribution maps and by reproductions of a small selection of engravings, essentially black- and-white photographs without scale. It is patent that neither the overall state of research on relevant site features, nor the author's personal knowledge of the rock art sites does actually allow for any well-founded examination of their distribution and of their composi- tion. Surprisingly, in the author's opinion, the past in- ventors have correctly reported the typical traits of the sites so that she can eventually rely on these data. According to my own experience in South-Morocco, careful examination will more often than not invalidate a previous preliminary report on the main traits of a rock art site. Anyhow, as an outcome of her review, the author thinks to have shown that "several different modes of existence and ideologies" have affected the people responsible for the rock art. Because of differ- ences in patina, style and theme of the engravings, she reckons that a number of rock art sites went through "several periods of occupation" (page 83). Chapter 8 (Detailed studies of four rock art sites) is made up of the description of four rock art sites that are felt to be representative of the four main rock art groups (characterized by theme, technique and "style") distinguished by the author. The site of Oum el Aleg (South Morocco) is supposed to illustrate the pictures of the "Tazina type", the site of Adrar n'Metgourine (South Morocco) stands for the images of the "Pecked Cattle type" (also known as "Bovidien" or Moroccan "Pseudo-Bovidien"), the site of Oukaimeden/Tizi n'Tifina (High Atlas) exemplifies the drawings of the "Dagger/Halberd/ Anthropomorph type", and the site of Foum Chenna (Anti- Atlas) corresponds to the de- pictions of the "Libyco-Berber type". The purpose of the investigation of these more or less "homogenous" sites is "to test the hypothesis of the existence of dif- ferent groups of engravings" (page 98). However, this study is not based on a complete inventory of the en- gravings to be found on each site, but on a "suffi- ciently representative selection for certain major de- ductions to be made" (page 85). The criteria underly- ing each assortment are not disclosed either. Chapter 9 (Extent of Moroccan rock art, identifi- cation of distinct types of engravings, classification of sites and their distribution) is dedicated to a discus- sion of the extent of the rock art and to an analysis of the results of the preceding chapters. The subdivision of Moroccan rock art into the four main groups men- tioned above has repeatedly been presented before (Sbihi Alaoui &amp; Searight 1997; Searight 1998). It re- mains within the largely inadequate classificatory frame that was mainly advocated by A. Simoneau about 35 years ago. The description of "engravings not-forming recognisable groups" (page 113) reveals some major deficiencies of this division. Obviously, the grouping is based on a misconception of the uni- formity of open-air rock art sites as well as on the theme and technique of the depictions, but not on their style. A stylistic classification would permit comparisons be- tween e.g. pecked cattle pictures and images of wild animals that are not associated with them on the same site. Indeed, they could very well belong to the same stylistic group. Besides, the question about what to do with the "unclassifiable" engravings remains unan- swered. The author's preoccupation with the classifi- cation of a site according to the dominant type of en- gravings present (page 113) is another conceptual legacy from the past. On account of the spatial distri- bution of the classified sites, she concludes that "cer- tain types of engravings were concentrated in certain areas and that little mixing took place" (page 121). How- ever, 148 of 290 rock art sites remain "unclassifiable" - about one half of them because their contents are "very mixed", "unusual" or "recent" (page 1 16). Judging by my own experience with a number of carefully studied rock art sites in South-Morocco, a homogenous site- composition is the exception, and not the rule. Part III (Chapter 10-14) is devoted to the discus- sion and interpretation of the collected data. Chapter 10 (Elements for the establishment of a chronological framework for the rock art) deals with the basis for the chronological classification of the rock art. Chapter 1 1 (Chronology adopted in the present study, and its im- plications) discusses the clues that were brought for- ward in the preceding section. Some evidence is clearly arranged in Table 29 and the resulting rock art se- quence is presented in Table 30. As a consequence of the author's misconception of site-homogeneity Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 3 (2), 2005 307</page><page sequence="4">Book Review and the concomitant mode of stylistic classification, she is also concerned with the dating of open-air rock art sites as a whole. A number of basic chronological indicators relate to climatic change, to the absence/ presence of certain species of wild animals, to the in- troduction of domestic animals, to the possible age of a few depicted objects of material culture, and to datable inscriptions. Several clues were introduced with the necessary caution in Part I, but now they are taken for sure. The author is quite right to state that the presence of dated finds in the vicinity of a rock art site cannot be taken as suggestive of the age of the engravings. All the same, she is persuaded that scien- tific dates that were obtained on archaeological mate- rial from the lower rock shelter of Amzri (valley of Toulkine, High Atlas) also apply to the rock paintings decorating the backs of the upper rock shelters that are situated 10 m above, on the same steep slope (see also Heckendorf &amp; Salih 1999: 240, Fig. 2). Moreover, the author should have taken into consideration that large mammals can survive in a variety of habitats and that even today, tropical species are common in South- Morocco, up to the 30th parallel (Le Houérou 1990: 253). Furthermore, with regard to the discussion of metal weapons, Ch. Züchner's (1998) clarifications on the noticeable links of various types of depictions with western and southern European rock art of the third and second millennium B.C. are left out. In addi- tion, with respect to the comparison between engrav- ings of the so-called "southern Moroccan axe" and apparently similar depictions from Valcamonica (page 134), the actual state of research on these essentially alpine weapons (the so-called "Hallebardenaxt") of late La Tène age is ignored. Unfortunately, the author has also misunderstood the style concept that could profitably be applied to the dating of rock art (see e.g. Züchner 2001). Chapter 12 (The rock art sites: their place in the landscape and an interpretation of their contents) con- sists of speculations about the relationship between the symbolic meaning of the rock art and its place in the landscape. Unfortunately, as regards Moroccan rock art, there are obviously no appropriate (oral or written) sources that allow for a proper reconstruction of symbolic meaning and the underlying site concept is unsuitable as well. In Chapter 13 (The rock art of Morocco in a North- West African context), the themes of Moroccan rock engravings are compared to those known from Algeria, Libya and Mauritania. Considering the over- all state of research, the ensuing deductions on the diffusion of ideas, on the movement of populations, etc go far beyond any reasonable level of rock art in- terpretation. Chapter 14 (Rock art, excavation and environ- ment) contains an overall view of the prehistoric trends and developments as they are supposed to be re- flected in Moroccan rock art. The author's commitment to outdated concepts is plainly reflected in proposi- tions such as the following: "It is intuitively felt by the present researcher that the whole idea of engraving rocks passed into Morocco from the Algeria Atlas via the Zenaga pass at Figuig" (page 168). Similarly, the author's notions about the economy of the people re- sponsible for the engravings are deeply rooted in the views that were mainly advocated, about 35 years ago, by A. Simoneau - who was again deeply influenced by the writings of P. Huard. However, up to the present day, we have no confirmation whatsoever that the depic- tion of hunting or herding activities actually was an outstanding characteristic of Moroccan rock art. To sum up, S. Searight's study shows a striking lack of critical awareness as to the methodical and theoretical problems that are connected with the study of rock art. Once again, a number of very prejudiced notions on Moroccan rock art are reiterated. From a methodological point of view, these obsolete views cannot be maintained. Notwithstanding the criticism that was expressed in this review, there is absolutely no doubt that the complete recording of the Moroccan rock art sites and adequate measures for their preser- vation are of urgent necessity. Hopefully, S. Searight's report will enhance the sense of responsibility of eve- ryone who is concerned about Morocco's most fasci- nating prehistoric rock art.
