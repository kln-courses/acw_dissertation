Sifri Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville Cell communication in bacteria occurs through a vernacular of small diffusible chemical signals that impact gene regulation during times of high cell density. This form of intercellular signaling, known as quorum sensing, optimizes the metabolic and behavioral activities of a community of bacteria for life in close quarters. Quorum sensing is best characterized as a means of communication within a bacterial species, whereas competitive or cooperative signaling can occur between groups of bacteria or between bacteria and the host. These systems are often integrated into complex, multilayered signal transduction networks that control numerous multicellular behaviors, including biofilm formation and other virulence traits. In addition, quorum signals, sensors, and signaling pathways are increasingly recognized as having biological properties that extend beyond cell communication. The deeper understanding of microbial cell communication promises to shed light on the complexities of the host-microbe relationship and may lead to novel therapeutic applications. Cell communication and signaling are essential for the proper growth and development of all living multicellular organisms. Because of its universal importance, it is not surprising that many fundamental aspects of cell communication have been evolutionarily conserved between plants, animals, and unicel- lular eukaryotes, even though these kingdoms diverged more than 1 billion years ago [ 1 , 2] . However, the ability to coordinate cellular behavior was once thought to be restricted to eukaryotic organisms, and bacterial perception of neighboring bacteria was thought to only occur indirectly (e.g., through sensing changes in nutrient availability). Now, work over the past 2 decades has firmly established that sophisticated communication systems are also used by bacteria to coordinate various biological ac- tivities, including the production of virulence factors and growth in biofilm communities [3]. Cell communication in bacteria and in some eukaryotic microorganisms occurs in a population-density dependent manner and is based on the pro- duction of and response to small pheromone-like biochemical molecules called autoinducers. Differential gene regulation in response to intercellular signaling provides microbes with a means to express particular behaviors only while growing in Received 18 January 2008; accepted 30 June 2008; electronically published 9 September 2008.

This process has been termed quorum sensing to reflect the need for a sufficient population of mi- crobes (and concentration of signal) to activate the system [4]. Quorum-sensing systems have been shown to be key viru- lence regulators in both gram-negative and gram-positive path- ogens. In addition, quorum sensing in Candida albicans has been found to influence filamentation [5, 6], which is intimately associated with virulence [7]. Interestingly, quorum sensing- regulated genes encode not only classic virulence factors but also other proteins, including those that are involved in basic metabolic processes. Indeed, a significant portion of a bacterial genome (4%-10%) and proteome (20% or more) can be in- fluenced by quorum signaling [8-11], which suggests that quo- rum sensing is a mechanism used by pathogenic bacteria not only to modulate virulence factor production but also to adapt to the metabolic demands of living in communities. It has been suggested that quorum sensing represents a novel target for the development of agents to treat or prevent bacterial infections. Theoretically, development of resistance to these an- tipathogenic compounds would be minimized, because they would target virulence mechanisms and not growth [12]. Ac- cordingly, significant efforts in both academia and industry have been committed to the development of compounds that inhibit or inactivate cell density-dependent signaling. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that quorum sensing is significantly more complex than first appreciated. Impeding these signaling pathways may have unexpected and unintended consequences in vivo. In some cases, bacteria with disabled cell communication systems may be particularly well-suited for cer- 1070 • CID 2008:47 (15 October) • HEALTHCARE EPIDEMIOLOGY</page><page sequence="2">tain types of infections. In addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that interspecies communication among pathogens and between pathogen and host adds another layer of complexity that likely impacts clinical disease. In this article, I will review the general mechanisms of quorum sensing in bacteria and discuss recent findings that underscore the evolving complex- ities of these systems. QUORUM SENSING: AN OVERVIEW Quorum sensing can be divided into at least 4 steps: (1) pro- duction of small biochemical signal molecules by the bacterial cell; (2) release of the signal molecules, either actively or pas- sively, into the surrounding environment; and (3) recognition of the signal molecules by specific receptors once they exceed a threshold concentration, leading to (4) changes in gene reg- ulation. One common consequence of quorum sensing induc- tion of gene expression is increased synthesis of the proteins involved in signal molecule production. Increased synthesis of the signal molecule creates a positive feedback loop, which is why quorum signals are commonly called autoinducers. One limitation to this model of microbial intercellular com- munication is that environmental conditions for autoinducer diffusion are not taken into account. Recognizing this, Redfield [13] has proposed a less anthropomorphic explanation as to why bacteria monitor and respond to changes in the concen- tration of self-generated signal molecules. Autoinducer con- centration, rather than sensing population density, is used by bacteria to gauge the rate of diffusion of extracellular molecules. Presumably, reduced diffusion (as assessed by increased au- toinducer concentration) is a marker of favorable conditions for the production of specific bacterial products. Although there is some experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis [14], it remains to be seen whether diffusion sensing will be a generalizable model of small molecule-based signaling in bacteria. At least a half-dozen types of quorum-sensing systems have been described in pathogenic bacteria, and more are almost certain to exist. A brief mechanistic review of quorum sensing, with a focus on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus as prototypical pathogens, is presented here. GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA N-aqrlhomoserine lactone (AHL) signaling. The lux-type quorum-sensing system is the archetypal and preeminent mechanism for species-specific communication in gram-neg- ative bacteria [15]. First identified in marine Vibrio species, lux- type quorum sensing is based on the production of and re- sponses to AHLs. In general, lux-type systems consist of 2 components, an autoinducer synthase (e.g., Luxl), which syn- thesizes AHLs from S-adenyosyl methionine, and a transcrip- tional regulator (e.g., LuxR). Because of its small size and li- pophilic character, AHL freely diffuses across cell membranes. As the population density increases, intracellular AHL binds the functionally linked (cognate) LuxR-like receptor at a suf- ficient concentration within the cytoplasm to induce differential gene expression. P. aeruginosa virulence traits are controlled by 2 distinct lux- type quorum-sensing systems, termed las and rhl, which are named after their influence on elastase and rhamnolipid pro- duction, respectively. The las system regulates the rhl system as part of a cascade of virulence regulators (figure 1). This hierarchical circuitry controls multiple virulence traits beyond elastase and rhamnolipid, including exoprotease and toxin pro- duction, motility, and biofilm formation [16]. Genetically en- gineered las and rhl system mutants have been shown to have significantly reduced virulence in several animal models of in- fection [17-19], and las and rhl AHLs (N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone [OdDHL] and N-butanoyl homoserine lac- tone, respectively) have been detected in sputum samples ob- tained from individuals with cystic fibrosis who were infected with P. aeruginosa [20, 21]. These studies support a central role for AHL quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa disease. Interestingly, AHLs may have biological functions that extend beyond quorum signaling. For example, OdDHL and other AHLs spontaneously degrade to tetrameric acid derivatives in water [22]. These tetrameric acids and OdDHL itself have bac- tericidal activity toward gram-positive organisms, including S. aureus, but not toward gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, AHLs may serve to enhance the competitiveness of P. aeruginosa in a consortium of mixed bacteria. Quinolone signaling. In addition to the las and rhl systems, a third non-AHL quorum-sensing system has been identified in P. aeruginosa. Cell signaling in this system occurs through members of a family of quinolone compounds termed 4-hy- droxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) (figure 1) [23]. Synthesis of HAQs is controlled by the transcriptional regulator MvfR, which modulates expression of several genes involved in the production of anthranilic acid and its conversion to 4-hydroxy- 2-heptylquinoline (HHQ) [24, 25]. HHQ is then converted to 3,4-dihydroxy-2-heptylquinoline, also known as Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), through the action of PqsH [25]. LasR controls production of MvfR and PqsH, thereby intertwining the mvfR signaling pathway with AHL quorum sensing [25]. Transcriptional analysis has shown that MvfR regulates ex- pression of a set of quorum sensing-regulated genes that par- tially overlap with but are distinct from those modulated by AHL autoinducers [26]. Interestingly, both PQS and HHQ have dual roles as MvfR ligands and as intercellular signaling mol- ecules for the mvfR regulon, although there are differences in their biological properties [27, 28]. PQS is markedly hydro- phobic. To be trafficked between cells, PQS is packaged inte small membrane vesicles that pinch off from the P. aeruginosa HEALTHCARE EPIDEMIOLOGY • CID 2008:47 (15 October) • 1071</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1. The hierarchical Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing systems. P. aeruginosa contains 2 LuxR/Luxl-type quorum-sensing systems, termed the las and rhl. Lasl produces the acyl-homoserine lactone autoinducer A/-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone (OdDHL; squares), whereas Rhll produces A/-butanoyl homoserine lactone (BHL; diamonds). OdDHL and BHL bind to their cognate receptors, LasR and RhIR, respectively. Activated LasR or RhIR induce expression of a complement of genes, including their own loci (completing the autoinducing circuits). Activated LasR also enhances expression of the rhl locus, as well as mvfFI, leading to increased production of 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ; triangles) and Pseudomonas qu\no\one signal (PQS; inverted triangles). Thus, the las system is placed squarely above the rhl and mvfR system in a hierarchical cascade of virulence regulators. Trafficking of hydrophobic PQS to neighboring cells occurs through small, extracellular membrane vesicles. HAQ, 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinoline. outer membrane and disperse through the bacterial population in a manner analogous to vesicular trafficking in eukaryotic cells (figure 1) [29]. Although PQS and HHQ have no known intrinsic antibiotic activity, other HAQs do. Like tetrameric acids, this antibacterial activity may enhance P. aeruginosa fit- ness in a mixed population of bacteria [25]. Finally, it should be understood that the las; rhly and mvfR quorum-sensing systems are components of a large network of regulators that control a wide assortment of cellular functions. Why does P. aeruginosa possess such a complex regulatory net- work? One possibility is that it may facilitate a temporal pro- gression in virulence factor production during infection that is optimized for P. aeruginosa pathogenesis [8]. Another possi- bility is that different combinations of chemical signals allow P. aeruginosa the flexibility to fine-tune its virulence programs and other social behaviors to adapt to many different environ- ments. This theory of modulated chemical communication us- ing multiple small- molecule messengers is neither new nor unique to bacteria. Over 40 years ago, naturalist Edward O. Wilson noted that changes in the pheromone concentrations and blends expand the repertoire of behavioral responses ob- served in social insects [30]. GRAM-POSITIVE BACTERIA Intercellular communication is also used by gram-positive pathogens to control virulence. Rather than using AHL or quin- olone-based signaling molecules, cell communication in gram- positive bacteria is based on the production and detection of modified oligopeptides called autoinducing peptides (AIPs). The best-studied system is the quorum-sensing system of S. aureus, which is encoded by the accessory gene regulator (agr) locus. Analogous to the function that quorum sensing plays in P. aeruginosa virulence, the agr system is central to a complex regulatory network that controls the production of a broad array of S. aureus virulence factors [31]. Moreover, agr also has a complex relationship with biofilm formation, which has sig- nificant clinical implications. The agr locus is composed of 2 divergent transcripts, RNAII (encoding agrB, agrD, agrCy and agrA) and RNAIII, which act 1072 • CID 2008:47 (15 October) • HEALTHCARE EPIDEMIOLOGY</page><page sequence="4">to suppress cell wall-associated protein production and en- hance secreted exoprotein production in response to high cell density (figure 2). Cell wall-associated adhesins facilitate S. aureus colonization, whereas secreted products are necessarily for invasion and dissemination. The 4 genes encoded by RNAII are involved in the production and sensing of the AIR agrD encodes the precursor of the autoinducing signal peptide, whereas the integral membrane protein AgrB is involved in its processing and secretion as a thiolactone-modified cyclic oli- gopeptide. AgrA and AgrC constitute a two-component histi- dine kinase- response regulator pair that respond to the extra- cellular accumulation of the AIR Activation of AgrA-AgrC induces transcription of RNAII (completing the autoinducing circuit) and RNAIII [31]. Remarkably, instead of encoding a regulatory protein, the 0.5 kb RNAIII transcript itself acts as the regulatory effector molecule for the agr system, largely through translational inhibition of the virulence gene repressor Rot (i.e., repressor of toxins) and perhaps other gene regulators [32, 33]. In addition, RNAIII itself encodes 5-hemolysin. Ge- netically engineered agr mutants have been show to be atten- uated in many animal models of S. aureus disease [34]. Sequence variability in AIP and AgrC allows S. aureus strains to be assembled into 4 different agr groups. The interaction between the AIP and AgrC receptor is highly specific, such that a given signaling peptide will activate only group-specific re- ceptors. By contrast, AIPs cross-inhibit AgrC signaling in strains of discordant agr groups [31]. This phenomenon has been cited as an example of intraspecies (or, more accurately, intergroup) interference, lending credence to the concept of quorum-sens- ing inhibition as a therapeutic approach. In fact, co-coloni- zation by isolates of different agr groups is rare in healthy individuals [35]. Co-colonization by strains of interfering agr groups may not be uncommon, however, in certain clinical situations. S. aureus isolates of interfering agr groups were si- multaneously recovered from sputum samples obtained from 40% of all patients with cystic fibrosis; many of these isolates were found to have dysfunctional agr systems [35]. Neverthe- less, dysfunctional agr strains are able to express agr-regulated virulence in vivo [36]. Taken together, these studies suggest that agr defects may allow interfering S. aureus strains to coexist, at least during certain chronic infections, and in these cases,, regulatory elements other than agr may direct the production of virulence factors. GENETIC SUPPORT OF QUORUM SENSING Quorum sensing is of ancient origin in many species, although when it first arose in the evolution of bacteria is not clear [37]. The components of quorum-sensing systems are typically en- coded by chromosomal genes, which likely were acquired by horizontal gene transfer [37-39]. The recent discovery of a functional AHL system within a mobile transposon in Serratia Figure 2. The accessory gene regulator (agr) system of Staphylococcus species. RNAII is a polycystronic transcript of 4 genes, agrBDCA, which encodes a 2-component signal transaction system (AgrCA), a 46-residue propeptide (AgrD), and a product (AgrB) involved in the processing and transport of the mature 7-9-residue autoinducing peptide (AIP). Activated AgrA is autoregulatory, inducing transcription of RNAII and the divergent transcript RNAIII from the P2 and P3 promoters, respectively. RNAIII, the effector molecule of the agr locus, acts as a posttranscriptional repressor of the virulence gene repressor Rot. RNAIII also contains the 6-hemolysin gene hid. RNAIII directly regulates expression of a-hemolysin (hla) and protein A (spa) genes and may alter expression of other virulence gene regulators (not shown). marcescens supports this hypothesis [40]. Once transferred to a new bacterial genome, quorum-sensing systems integrate with native signal-transduction systems to produce regulatory net- works that are often unique to a given species. CROSS TALK BETWEEN MICROBES AND HOST Recent studies have shown that, in some instances, bacteria of different species and bacteria and host are able to detect and react to each others' chemical signals [3, 41]. For example, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli appears to produce an un- identified autoinducer, termed AI-3, that activates genes that are involved in intestinal colonization, including genes neces- sary for the formation of the characteristic attaching and ef- facing lesion [42]. Interestingly, the AI-3 signaling pathway is also activated by epinephrine and norepinephrine, which sug- gests that enterohemorrhagic E. coli may monitor host cate- HEALTHCARE EPIDEMIOLOGY • CID 2008:47 (15 October) • 1073</page><page sequence="5">cholamine levels to alter gene expression during intestinal car- riage [43]. In another study, P. aeruginosa was found to bind dynorphin [44]. Binding and internalization of the K-opioid peptide, in turn, induces production of PQS and other HAQs, thus augmenting P. aeruginosa virulence and competitive fitness [44]. Taken together, these and other studies suggest that bac- terial pathogens monitor and respond to host-derived small molecules, and in some circumstances, the response occurs via quorum-sensing pathways. Although P. aeruginosa may use quorum signaling to help respond to endogenous host products, such as dynorphin, Pseu- domonas autoinducers themselves may be important virulence determinants that promote infection. OdDHL has considerable immunomodulatory effects, although the response may be stimulatory or inhibitory depending on the model used [45- 50]. Similarly, PQS has also been shown to modulate immune responses [51]. Although the full impact of quorum signals on host defense responses remains to be determined, it appears that some autoinducers may interact with eukaryotic cells in a manner that promotes infection. However, pathogens are not engaged in a one-sided con- versation with the host. Although autoinducers may be toxic to mammalian cells or undermine their normal function, some host cells target autoinducers for destruction. Recent studies have shown that the paraoxonase PON2 produced by human respiratory epithelial cells can enzymatically degrade P. aeru- ginosa OdDHL in vitro [52]. Similarly, neutrophil-derived ox- idants like NADPH oxidase can degrade S. aureus AIP [53]. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES Quorum Sensing and Biofilm Coincident with the elucidation of cell communication systems in bacteria has been the growing appreciation of the importance of biofilms in bacterial physiology and virulence. Most bacteria in the environment reside in biofilms, as do many of those involved in human infection [54]. Interestingly, another small- molecule signaling system, based on the intracellular second messenger bis- (3&gt;-5&gt;) -cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (cyclic-di-GMP), has been shown to control the ability of flag- ellated bacteria, such as P. aeruginosa, to switch from planktonic to biofilm growth [55]. The close proximity of bacteria and limited diffusion of molecules within the biofilm matrix suggest that quorum sensing may be crucial for the development of biofilm-associated infections. P. aeruginosa. The first evidence that quorum sensing may influence biofilm formation was reported in association with P. aeruginosa, when a lasl mutant was found to produce a thinner biofilm that was more susceptible to disruption by detergents [56]. These findings, along with reports of the con- tribution of quorum sensing to biofilm formation in other bacteria, have led to considerable interest in the development of quorum-sensing inhibitors as a means to prevent or treat biofilm-associated infections. In fact, recent work has shown that compounds that inhibit quorum sensing impede biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa [12]. It should be noted, however, that P. aeruginosa strains that lack functional quorum-sensing systems can, nevertheless, still cause infection [57]. Staphylococcus species. In contrast with quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa, quorum sensing in staphylococci does not promote biofilm formation. Rather, agr inhibition enhances surface attachment and biofilm formation in both S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis [58, 59]. Indeed, absence of ó- hemolysin synthesis (a marker of defective RNAIII production) has been associated with chronic, biofilm-associated infections, including methicillin- resistant S. aureus lung infection in pa- tients with cystic fibrosis and persistent bacteremia [36, 60]. Furthermore, loss of agr signaling has also been implicated as an early step in the development of vancomycin tolerance in both clinical and laboratory-derived vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus agr group II strains [61, 62]. Nonfunctional agr sys- tems are also more frequently observed in S. epidermidis clinical isolates from infected prosthetic joints than in isolates from healthy individuals, and a genetically engineered agr mutant increased biofilm formation in a rabbit infection model [63]. These studies suggest that strategies designed to inhibit agr quorum sensing could have the unintended consequence of altering bacterial physiology to favor chronic, biofilm-associ- ated staphylococcal infection. How does the agr system inhibit biofilm formation? As noted earlier, agr signaling suppresses adhesin production and induces secreted exoprotein production. Therefore, it is conceivable that agr dysfunction or inhibition may increase the adhesive prop- erties of S. aureus and hinder lytic enzyme production. In ad- dition, studies using fluorescent S. aureus have shown that agr is not activated in all areas of the biofilm. Rather, agr is pref- erentially expressed in areas of the biofilm-surface interface that later appear to detach from the cellular agglomeration [64]. Detachment, once thought to be a passive process (the result of a complex interplay between shear forces, bacterial cell vi- ability, and host immune factors), appears to also be influenced by specific bacterial factors [54]. In 5. epidermidis, 6-hemolysin itself and a group of agr- regulated small peptides called phenol- soluble modulins have been suggested to act as detergents that facilitate detachment [65]. Quorum Sensing as a Therapeutic Target Recently, compounds that inhibit quorum sensing have re- ceived considerable attention as a potentially novel class of antimicrobial agents (recently reviewed by Persson et al. [66]). Pharmacologic inhibition of quorum sensing is a particularly attractive approach for the prevention or treatment of chronic 1074 • CID 2008:47 (15 October) • HEALTHCARE EPIDEMIOLOGY</page><page sequence="6">infections with high bacterial cell density or limited diffusion environments, such as chronic lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic wound infections [67]. In addition, it has been hypothesized that the development of resistance to quorum sensing inhibitors should be limited, because these agents would attenuate virulence but not impede bacterial growth [12]. Pharmacologic interference of intercellular signaling can be envisioned at several steps in the quorum-sensing circuitry. Potential strategies include inhibiting receptor synthesis or function, reducing production or release of functional autoin- ducer, stimulating autoinducer degradation, or inhibiting au- toinducer- receptor binding. Examples of each of these mech- anisms can be found in nature [68]. For instance, the observation that fronds of the Australian red seaweed Delisea pulchra are rarely fouled with marine biofilms led to the dis- covery of a class of halogenated furanones with quorum-sensing inhibitory activity. Structurally similar to AHLs, these furanones appear to act as competitive inhibitors of LuxR-type receptors [69]. With use of natural furanones as lead compounds, syn- thetic halogenated furanones with potent in vitro and in vivo anti-quorum-sensing activity have been developed [12]. CONCLUSION The ability of bacteria to adapt to environments of high cell density or limited diffusion is fundamental to their competitive growth and survival; for some bacteria, these adaptive responses are accomplished using autoinducers. The challenge for the future will be for clinicians to apply their understanding of autoinducer-based signaling to the development of effective therapeutic agents or prevention strategies.
