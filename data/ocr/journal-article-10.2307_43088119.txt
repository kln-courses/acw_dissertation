In the preface, the author describes which sections of the book might be of interest to particular fields of study. The book is divided into four sections, each of which contains several chapters. Each section describes one of the following approaches to user interface design theories: • "Empirical Approach" describes how the user interface design process can benefit from good experimental design techniques. • "Cognitive Approach" discusses how to apply human problem-solving techniques to create more usable interface designs. • "Predictive Modeling Approach" assumes that human information processing stages can be used on a stage- by-stage basis to model a user interface. • "Anthropomorphic Approach" uses physical human characteristics to create a more intuitive interface. These approaches are not mutually exclusive, and the author describes the areas of research overlap. Each set of chapters has references to a master list at the end of the book that contains numerous studies and experiments for each of the four approaches. Course developers can easily scan the table of contents and locate information about any of the four user interface design approaches. Although the scope of the research and references in the book is impressive, there is a dearth of real-world examples. Regrettably, you won't find the "war stories" from actual usability problems in real companies that would have made the theories, studies, and experiments presented here more relevant.
