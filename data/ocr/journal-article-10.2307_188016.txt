<plain_text><page sequence="1">TENDENCIES* QUENTIN GIBSON Department of Philosophy Australian National University The question is raised, what is going on when there is a tendency for some- thing to happen, but it does not happen. A conspicuous case is that in which there is an equilibrium between opposing forces. One answer, given, for ex- ample, by Anscombe and Geach, Harre, and Bhaskar, is that such tendencies are in a sense real, though not manifest. The other answer, given, for example, by Braithwaite and Mackie, is that statements of tendencies are conditional state- ments about what is manifest but ones in which some antecedents are not spec- ified. The first of these answers is criticized and the second defended. This paper is concerned with what one might call the tug-of-war sit- uation. Two groups of people pull their hardest on each end of a rope, yet in fact no movement occurs. When I did some elementary physics at school, I was told that the desk I was sitting at was being drawn down- wards in such a way as to fall 16 feet in a second, but that fortunately there were counteracting upward thrusts sufficient to keep it in place. In the economics class I learnt that the price of bread was held steady be- cause, while a certain number of sellers were wanting to charge more, a corresponding number of buyers were wanting to pay less. Then there was Hamlet, in a state of inactivity, torn between a desire for vengeance and the urge to end his troubles by suicide. Everywhere the status quo, the absence of change, was being accounted for as an equilibrium be- tween the balance of opposing forces. The question that naturally arose was: What was actually happening? The question has recently come into some prominence in connection with criticisms of those theories which treat scientific laws as stating in- variable connections in nature. Some who hold such theories regard these connections as necessary, others as involving some kind of nomic im- plication, and others as mere constant conjunctions. But however they differ on this matter, they agree in thinking that laws involve universal regularities of occurrence, and that explanation of particular happenings is by subsumption under these regularities. Against this, the critics argue that scientific laws are not like this at all. Newton's law of universal *Received April 1982; revised November 1982. Philosophy of Science, 50 (1983) pp. 296-308.

It is not a statement either of nec- essary, nomic or de facto regularity. In point of fact, bodies only rarely gravitate towards one another with the rate of acceleration mentioned in the law. Apples may fall from trees, but birds and aeroplanes, let alone the moon, cannot be subsumed under this law. In fact, it is pointed out, these laws are always treated as statements of tendencies, rather than as statements of universal regularities of oc- currence. And explanation of actual events consists in showing that they are the resultant of the operation of different tendencies. If you mention only one law, and intend it as explanatory, you must cover yourself with a ceteris paribus clause. In this way, you can retain your law of gravi- tation despite the behavior of aeroplanes; you can retain your law that increase in demand increases price, despite the stability of the price; you can retain your law that being beset by outrageous fortune leads to sui- cide, despite your Hamlets who do not commit it. This point is made much of by Anscombe and Geach when they are expounding Aquinas' Aristotelian doctrine of inclinationes, or (as they translate it) "natural tendencies" (1961, pp. 101-103). The idea that there can be interferences with the laws of nature cannot, they claim, be brought into line with a uniformity doctrine of causality. In explaining what ac- tually happens, scientists look for the natural agents involved, and find out what their tendencies are. These tendencies, they go on to say, are not mere potentialities; they are "somehow actual", and their presence "will always make a difference to what actually happens". The same idea has been made extensive use of by Rom Harre in his doctrine of powers (Harre 1970; Harre and Madden 1975). On his view, the explanation of events has to be given not in terms of regularities but in terms of generative mechanisms, i.e. in terms of the powers things have to produce events in virtue of their natures. Though he speaks of "6powers" rather than "tendencies", he takes this view to be very similar to that of Anscombe and Geach (Harre and Madden, pp. 98-100). The difference is that he says little about the sort of situation I am considering in which opposed powers are manifested together. But he clearly envis- ages it as fitting within his scheme.' It has, however, been left to one of his successors, Roy Bhaskar, to present the tendency problem as central in the critique of what he calls regularity determinism. In "A Realist Theory of Science" (Bhaskar 1975), he talks, like Harre, of generative mechanisms, but his great point is that generative mechanisms do not act in isolation, rather they combine to iSee, for example, Harre and Madden (1975, pp. 141-2). Though they claim that ex- planation of persistence is not required, they admit "cases of pseudo-persistence where countervailing powers produce an uneasy equilibrium".</page><page sequence="3">298 QUENTIN GIBSON produce highly irregular sequences of events. To detect them, one has to make them act in isolation, thus producing an artificial regular sequence. One has, as he puts it, to induce a closure, this being the point of ex- perimental activity. The universe in general remains an open system, con- trolled by a great variety of tendencies, but always open to the possibility that something else will interfere. In referring to these recent authors, I do not want to suggest that the tendency approach to scientific laws has been ignored by writers in the "regularity" tradition which they oppose. John Stuart Mill was the one who in fact explicitly introduced the notion of a "tendency", to meet the case in which the effects of certain laws are counteracted by the operation of other laws (Mill 1947, III, 10, Sect. 5). Conceiving of total causes as made up of sets of conditions, he considered what he called "the laws of the separate causes" (i.e. of the separate conditions) and the intermixture of their effects. His trouble was that he did not see that there was a prob- lem here, and hence made no attempt to guard himself against the charge of Anscombe and Geach that his "unofficial doctrine of tendencies" (to use Bhaskar's phrase) is inconsistent with his view of laws as invariable sequences. Unlike Mill, Carl Hempel is aware of the problem, but minimizes its importance by treating statements of tendencies as giving only "expla- nation sketches", needing to be filled out in order to become explanations proper. He therefore pays little attention to them, which is a pity, since one of his best-known examples of a law used by historians ("Populations will tend to migrate to regions which offer better living conditions") is a statement of this kind, the tendency mentioned being, as we all know, often counteracted by traditional conservatism etc. (1iempel 1965, pp. 236). It may seem plausible to regard the laws used by historians as giv- ing only explanation sketches. But it has to be remembered that the same treatment would need to be given to the most central laws of the most advanced sciences, such as Newton's law of gravitation, or the supply and demand laws in economics. While complete explanations may require reference to numbers of such laws, we never regard the laws themselves as replaceable by ones filled out to state actual invariable sequences. Mill and Hempel happen to be writers in the Humean tradition. But it must be emphasized that one need not take a Humean view of causal laws to be involved with this problem. All who think in terms of invariable connections have to integrate statements of tendencies in some way into their view of explanation. Otherwise, they are faced with the need to admit a tendency as something which belongs to causal agents in their own right, invariably making a difference to the situation, yet often with- out producing any actual effects. In recent years, those who have concerned themselves with this inte-</page><page sequence="4">TENDENCIES 299 gration have often considered only the epistemological question of how to justify statements about tendencies, given that one can never deduce from them any testable consequences. One view put forward on this ques- tion has been that we always treat them as parts of theories which we test as a whole by estimating the effects of tendencies in combination (Gibson 1960, Ch. 13). Another has been that we can test such statements separately by a refined form of the method of difference, the assumption being that factors kept stable can always be discounted (Mackie 1965 or 1974, Ch. 3). These views are, I think, both partly right, and between them they scotch the old criticism that the insertion of a ceteris paribus clause into a law makes it unfalsifiable. But this does not solve the on- tological question of what in fact is going on when something tends to happen or is subject to the operation of one or another causal factor. This is the question we are concerned with here. I am assuming that when we state sufficient conditions for something to happen, there is no problem about what is being said. There is at least no further problem than that about the assertion of any universal prop- osition. The same is true when we say of any given condition that it is a necessary condition. The problem comes when we state what C. D. Broad long ago called contributory conditions (Broad 1944, p. 16), and what Mackie recently called inus conditions (1965, p. 245). The meta- phor about contributions to an effect, in fact, proves dangerous. When various people contribute to a discussion, their contributions remain as audible parts of the discussion. When people contribute to party funds, the amounts they contribute can, in principle at least, be listed. But when we are asked about the contributions to the resultant stalemate of those people pulling on both ends of the rope, we cannot give the same kind of answer. Physicists give the appearance of overcoming this problem by talking about pressures and forces. In the parallelogram of forces, we are given, in fact, a nice picture of the body in question being moved in one direction by one force and in another direction by another force, the ac- tual movement being along the diagonal of the parallelogram so formed. But every school child knows that the body does not move in two direc- tions at once, it only moves in the resultant direction. It has been pointed out by Anscombe and Geach, and by Alan Ryan in his book on Mill (Ryan 1970, Ch. 4, pp. 64-5), that Mill was inclined to fall foul of this metaphor. He spoke as if the effects of the separate causes actually occur, and are then somehow fused together into the re- sultant. In this way he gave the impression that tendency statements could be retained as statements of invariable sequence, the difference in this case being that all members of the set of invariable sequences somehow merge into one. But this clearly will not do. In the tug-of-war, the rope is not actually moving at all, since the opposed pulls cancel out.</page><page sequence="5">300 QUENTIN GIBSON II To the problem created by this predicament, two opposed kinds of so- lution might be offered. One is to say that something really is going on but that, when counteraction occurs, it is not manifest in the actual, or at least the observable, course of events. Anscombe and Geach advance this view when they say that a tendency is "somehow actual", and "its presence will always make a difference to what actually happens" (1961, pp. 103). One of Harre's "generative mechanisms" is here envisaged as really at work. Bhaskar caps this by claiming more explicitly that a ten- dency can be exercized without being fulfilled. Mill's mistake, he says, was not to realize this (1975, pp. 99-100). The other solution is to deny the need for supposing any such under- cover goings-on. On this view, tendency statements are not categorical statements about the operation of generative mechanisms, they are, rather, conditional statements about what always happens under certain condi- tions. They differ from other scientific laws, however, in that in them some of the conditions are unspecified. Sometimes these conditions are not even mentioned, as when we say that all bodies gravitate towards one another with such and such an acceleration. But this is unfortunate, be- cause it gives the impression that something is always going on when often it is not. The addition of the ceteris paribus clause-"unless there are (unspecified) counteracting forces"-is, on this view, absolutely es- sential for the statement. A view of this kind was expressed by Stephen Toulmin when he in- sisted that scientific laws are never supposed to hold under all conditions, and that we must distinguish between their formulation and their appli- cation (Toulmin 1953, pp. 77-9). It is presented by Braithwaite when he says that tendency statements must be taken as conditionals with un- specified antecedents (Braithwaite 1953, pp. 361-6). And it is embodied in Mackie's view of causal laws as universal propositions which are "el- liptical" or "gappy" (Mackie 1974, p. 66). The issue between these two kinds of solution has been represented as one between realism and positivism in the philosophy of science. Harre in particular, in attacking positivism, describes his view as a realist one, and so does Bhaskar. But there is great danger of confusion here. "Pos- itivism", as we know, may mean many things, and the same is true of "realism". "Realism", in fact, can mean as many things as there are things one can claim to be real. Some people are realists about the seamy side of life, some about universals, and again some about material things, including unobservable ones such as electrons. Harre's realism, however, is different from all these in that it is a realism about powers and hence also about tendencies. This is something which is not entailed by any of the other realisms.</page><page sequence="6">TENDENCIES 301 In particular it is not entailed by that scientific realism which holds to the reality of unobservable entities. For the reality of unobservable en- tities is quite compatible with all the laws concerning them being of the straightforward invariable sequence type, without tendencies entering into the picture in any way. Conversely, realism about tendencies does not entail such scientific realism. For the reality of tendencies is quite com- patible with there being no unobservable entities at all. Tendencies are regularly attributed to macroscopic things such as billiard balls and peo- ple. They are so attributed, for example, in classical mechanics and clas- sical economics, neither of which have any special interest in theories about microstructure. It follows, therefore, that to associate the first so- lution of our problem with scientific realism, as this is commonly under- stood, is to obscure its real character. This same danger of confusion arises in another form when tendencies are regarded as dispositions of enduring objects to behave in certain ways under certain conditions. Those who take dispositions to be persisting features of the objects which behave in these ways are commonly called realists. But it certainly does not follow from such realism that these features have to include tendencies. Some dispositions, admittedly, are of the tendency type. Vain people, for example, only tend to behave in certain ways under certain conditions, they do not always do so. This, however, leaves it entirely open whether this tendency is to be treated as part of their nature, along with the other persistent features, or whether the tendency consists in the fact that in ascribing vanity, some of the conditions for the behaviour in question remain unspecified. Realism about dispositions is quite as compatible with the second of these possibilities as with the first. III With these warnings against misunderstanding, we may now consider which of the two solutions to our problem we should adopt. It is easy to see why the first solution is so attractive. For, on the one hand, a tendency has to be dissociated from the occurrence of any actual effect, it being perfectly possible for there to be a tendency for something to happen without its happening. Yet, on the other hand, it cannot be identified with any of the ordinary describable features of the entity which has it, or with the surrounding circumstances. You may describe a billiard ball, for example, mentioning its shape, size, mass and so on, and you may specify its circumstances, saying that it is moving with such-and- such a speed in such-and-such a direction, and that another ball is lying in its path, but you still have not said anything about its tendency to move that other ball in a specific direction. We seem therefore to need the tendency as an extra element to fill the gap between the nature and cir-</page><page sequence="7">302 QUENTIN GIBSON cumstances of things on the one hand, and their actual effects on the other. This, I think, accounts for the strong feeling that something is going on even when no effect occurs, that when pressures are being ex- erted or forces are operating, these are in some way additional items which need to be mentioned in our account of the universe. It would, however, be a grave mistake to yield to this feeling and thereby be led into adopting the first solution of the problem. I wish to argue that to do so would have quite unacceptable consequences. In the first place, we have to recognize that the additional items, said by Anscombe and Geach to be "somehow actual", must be actually pres- ent in particular things, episodes or situations. The tendency of the rope to move in one direction or another in a particular tug-of-war must be part of that particular situation where identifiable individuals are pulling at both ends. So it would seem reasonable to conduct a search for it, in a manner reminiscent of Hume when he searched for necessity in causes. The search would not be an empirical one where we knew what we were looking for and were trying to find evidence that it was there. It would rather be a conceptual one in which we were trying to find out what kind of thing we could be looking for. The prospects of success in such a search are, as in Hume's case, not rosy, and I do not intend to dwell on it. However, because we do not know what we are looking for, it is very easy to present a picture of the tendency situation which gives the concept of a tendency some apparent empirical content. I will mention two ways in which this is done. The first of these is to think of a tendency as a kind of process. Ref- erences to tendencies in play (e.g. Bhaskar 1975, p. 95), forces operat- ing, generative mechanisms at work (e.g. Harre 1970, p. 1 3), all suggest that something is literally going on all the time when the specified cir- cumstances are present. The picture we have is of a kind of power-station, a mechanism for generating electricity, which is not lying idle but is tick- ing over with its engines running ready to produce light when the switches are thrown. The trouble with this, of course, is that such processes are not tend- encies, rather they have tendencies; and so we are left in the same position as before. We look as if we have got somewhere because we have intro- duced internal change into the picture. An idle power-station will never produce light, but an operating one may. A stationary ball will never move other balls, but a moving one may. We are thus one step nearer the production of the effect.2 But that is all. We can ask exactly the same 2Reflect on Harre's statement (1970 p. 278), "A tendency is a power in abeyance, a power in the course of coming to be exercised, a power about to be exercised or mani- fested".</page><page sequence="8">TENDENCIES 303 questions about these processes as we asked before about the things that enter into them. In the detailed description of the operating mechanism of the power-station, we will never come across its tendency to produce light. Where then is the tendency? For a second source of empirical content, we might turn to the case of human action. For it is here that the concepts of pushing and pulling, of using force and exerting pressure, would appear to have their original home. We tend to lose our tempers when cars cut in front of us, and we are aware of this, even though, in Bhaskar's words, "we just manage to keep our tempers" (1975, pp. 99-100). We know what it is to pull on a rope, even though this output of energy has no effect. Having got the concept of a tendency in this way, we can apply it in other kinds of case, as when we speak of the pressure exerted by a gas on the sides of its container, or of the force that pulls the table towards the Earth, or of the tendency waves have to wear away the rocks on which they crash. The question remains, however, what sort of help this gives us? Since we started with the tug-of-war, let us consider the case of pulling. What is happening with those people on the ends of the rope? They undoubtedly all have certain desires and beliefs, they are surrounded by various cir- cumstances, such as the team-captain shouting "Pull", they grip the rope, their muscles become taut, the rope stretches, and so on. In telling the story, we will use the word "tendency" frequently. The rope has a ten- dency to stretch when the muscles are tautened; this tendency is fulfilled. The rope has a tendency to move when it is stretched; this tendency is not fulfilled. Another tendency which is usually fulfilled is the one the people concerned have to grip the rope when they desire to get it moving and when the team-captain shouts "Pull". At none of these points, how- ever, does the word "tendency" refer to any observable feature of what is going on, over and above the desires, beliefs, shouting, muscle-taut- ening and rope stretching. Yet the people are undoubtedly pulling their hardest. It may be said here that I have been very off-hand about the desires, and that these really are tendencies, along, of course, with wishes, wants, motives, inclinations, and the rest. The word used by Aquinas was in- clinationes, and this has a definitely mental ring.3 The point about de- sires, wishes and so on is their intentionality-they are directed toward objects, even when there are no such objects. And it is to this notion of being directed towards something which may not exist that tendencies might easily be thought to be assimilated. I do not wish to get caught up in issues about intentionality here, but I do not think there is any need. I will merely make two points. The first 3Though, as with its English derivative, "leaning" or "bending" is its original use.</page><page sequence="9">304 QUENTIN GIBSON is that being directed towards intentional objects and being directed to- wards non-existent effects are very different things, and though we might give some sense to the first, it is hard to see what sense we could possibly give to the second. The second point is that neither Aquinas nor An- scombe and Geach nor Harre wishes to restrict tendencies to cases of human action; and if we do not wish to go in for a kind of pan-psychism, which they do not, we cannot say that the tendency of the earth to pull the table towards it, or of the sea to wear away the rocks, has anything to do with their having intentional states. I think therefore that we should not regard the appeal to the intentionality of mental states as in any way relevant. Let us agree, then, that a Hume-type search for tendencies proves a failure. But this, it will be said, is not surprising, since tendencies are not observable features of a situation which we could expect to find by looking. To establish their reality, what we must do is, rather, show that they fill a necessary explanatory role similar to that filled by unobservable entities such as electrons. The question we must now ask, therefore, is what their explanatory role could be and whether they are necessary for the filling of it. To answer the first of these questions, we need to look carefully at what the precise relation is between appealing to tendencies and appealing to invariable sequences. Tendencies, we must remember, are sometimes fulfilled and sometimes not. So it looks as if in appealing to tendencies we are abandoning the appeal to invariable sequences. We picture our- selves as embarking on a distinct kind of explanation in which we make no reference to general laws. It may now be pointed out, however, that this picture is extremely deceptive. The reference to general laws has not really been abandoned, it has only been relocated. To see this, we need only consider what Bhas- kar says about closed and open systems (1975, pp. 33-36). The point of experimental procedure, he says, is to produce a closure, that is, to elim- inate all interferences. Under these conditions, tendencies are invariably fulfilled, so that the tendency-laws, the real laws of nature, give rise to invariable sequences. This enables us to detect what the tendency-laws are, and having discovered what they are, we can proceed to posit their operation in open systems, that is, in the world outside the laboratory, and explain what goes on in terms of them. We can see from this that the appeal to laws is being taken for granted as necessary for explanation. What Bhaskar is doing is noting that in- variability of sequence is, on the surface, usually missing, and inferring from this that explanation of what goes on must be in terms of some hidden invariability of sequence, in which tendencies figure as an item. The sequences are hidden because the tendencies are not observable and</page><page sequence="10">TENDENCIES 305 their effects are often not observable, but they remain as sequences never- theless. Thus, according to Anscombe and Geach, the presence of a ten- dency "will always make a difference to what actually happens" (1961, p. 103; my emphasis) even where nothing actually happens. According to Bhaskar a tendency is invariably exercized, even though not invariably fulfilled. This being the position, we may well ask about the status of these underlying laws which are not fulfilled in the actual world. Anscombe and Geach say evasively of tendencies that they are "somehow actual". Bhaskar, however, is more explicit and is thus driven to the inevitable conclusion that the distinction between the surface and the hidden is one between different kinds of reality or levels of existence. The sequence of events takes place in the actual world. The tendency laws apply in a real world which underlies and explains it. And Bhaskar condemns as "ac- tualism" the doctrine that only the actual is real (1975, p. 64). To commit oneself to such a division into ontological compartments is to take the last stand of the metaphysician in trouble. It is no doubt very handy, for it at once removes the need to find a place for tendencies in a world already full of actual things. But to dump them into some other realm of being is nothing more than a hedging device. It is, moreover, a very dangerous device, in that it makes impossible any discussion of what the world-the actual world-is like. If something is found not to happen in that world, that ceases to be the end of it. A home can always be found for it in some other world. It is true that if we are prepared to accept these consequences we still retain an explanatory role for tendencies, and from this we may argue to their hidden or other-worldly reality. But this is clearly a very high price to pay. So we may now reasonably turn to the second of our questions and ask whether tendencies so conceived are required for the explanation of observable or this-worldly happenings. If they are not, we have every reason to reject the first solution of our problem. The way to answer this question is, of course, to turn to the second solution of our problem, according to which tendency statements are uni- versal conditional statements about what happens in the actual world, but ones in which some of the conditions are not specified. If this solution is acceptable and includes a satisfactory account of explanation, there could be no possible reason for returning to the first. IV It is easy to understand people's uneasiness about this second solution. If you generalize about what goes on in the world, it is presumably your business to say what the generalization is about, that is, to specify the</page><page sequence="11">306 QUENTIN GIBSON terms of the generalization. If you fail to do this, you cease to give in- formation about the world. If you say that whenever anyone pulls on a rope, and . . ., the rope moves in their direction, you are not saying that it always happens, or that it sometimes happens, or that it happens in any particular case. How then is your statement connected with the ordinary actual world? It is in view of this that Braithwaite says that tendency statements are not propositions at all, but quasi-propositions which we can pretend are propositions for some purposes, but no more (1953, p. 364). Alterna- tively, without committing ourselves on the use of the word "proposi- tion", we might say that what is being said is neither true or false, since it is not descriptive of the world. The introduction of tendencies as items in the world is undoubtedly spurred on by the consideration that there must be something for tendency statements to be about, something which makes them either true or false. What could this be if it were not the real existence of tendencies? If for these reasons we were to deny a truth-value to tendency state- ments, we might still claim that they were useful, thereby retaining a function for them. Whenever we try them out and find that what we claim tends to happen does not happen, we immediately start looking for what prevents it. In that way tendency statements can be said to have value as a guide to further enquiry. We may put together a whole set of them and call it a model, in the sense of "model" in which it is not itself a theory, but a simplified substitute used as a heuristic device in the process of theory construction. As such it may be said to be useful but not true. This attempt to divorce usefulness from truth, however, should be looked on with suspicion, if for no other reason than that to be a guide to enquiry is to contribute to that enquiry, and it is hard to see how any statement could contribute to an enquiry if it did not, as we normally say, have an element of truth. I think, therefore, that instead of trying to find a distinct function for tendency statements, we should challenge directly the orig- inal claim that, as conditional statements with unspecified antecedents, they give no information about the world. What we need to do is to distinguish between the truth and the whole truth. The whole truth is something which it is generally impossible to attain, and the attaining of it would moreover be generally irrelevant. When we describe particular things or situations, it is generally not to the point to attempt complete descriptions, even if we could approach them. The witness who swears to tell the whole truth about what the accused said to him at such and such a time and place is not expected to describe, say, the pitch of his voice, or his exact forms of expression. Similarly, when we explain how such situations come about, it is generally not to the point to attempt complete explanations stating everything that goes</page><page sequence="12">TENDENCIES 307 into making up a sufficient condition for their occurrence. Unspecified antecedents in a general conditional are like unspecified details in a de- scription. In each case the statement would be a fuller one if they were specified, but it does not follow from this that it would be truer. Let us admit, then, that tendency statements do not give us information about what always happens or what sometimes happens, or what happens in particular cases. What they do is give us information of another kind. They are general statements which relate some specified condition to an event of a specified kind. What they state is that the specified condition is one of a set of conditions given which an event of that kind invariably occurs-constantly, nomically, or necessarily, according to one's view of the matter. This is what we have in mind when we say that the con- dition in question is causally relevant for the occurrence of such an event. This is something which either is or is not the case, and we have standard methods for establishing or refuting the claim. In the light of this, if we ask ourselves what is happening when there is a stalemate in a tug of war, or in any other cases of opposed forces in equilibrium, the answer is clearly as follows. (1) Nothing is happening, except of course that both teams are pulling, the rope is stretching and so on. (2) It is the case that team No. 1's pulling in direction A is one of a set of conditions given which the rope will move in that direction. (3) It is the case that team No. 2's pulling in the opposite direction is one of a set of conditions given which the rope will move in that opposite direction. In neither case is the complete set of conditions present, so the tendencies described under (2) and (3) are not fulfilled. If we take the two pulling together, then of course we can say (4) that they constitute one of a set of conditions given which the rope will be stationary. In this case, the tendency is fulfilled. It so happens, however, that, given suf- ficiently precise knowledge of the pullings, we could deduce (4) from (2) and (3) using a well-established law about the composition of forces. It may be said that the information provided by (2) and (3) is very thin. For, after all, it is also the case that a team's pulling in one direction is one of a set of conditions given which the rope will move in the opposite direction. This tendency is also not fulfilled, but it would be if one of the unspecified conditions were the presence of a powerful mechanism for winding up the rope in the opposite direction, a mechanism which was released by a single pull. Is it not the case then that, on this account, there is, for anything that happens, a great variety of tendencies, many inconsistent with one another? The reply to this is that it is indeed the case, and a moment's reflection will show us that when we consider tendencies in isolation we all accept it. Any event is indeed causally relevant for a great variety of possible outcomes, and this is something which the terminology of tendencies can</page><page sequence="13">308 QUENTIN GIBSON easily accommodate. The only lesson to the learnt is that in giving ex- planations we select our tendencies in the light of background knowledge. But there is nothing new about the idea that in practice any form of en- quiry requires the use of background knowledge. It may be said, finally, that adopting this second solution removes all action from the world, with its attendant tensions, pressures, forces, push- ings and pullings. But this is not so. In the case of human action, every- one knows that people pull on ropes. All I am doing is protecting the conception of such action against metaphysical misuse. In the case of physical action, everyone knows likewise what it is for a gas to exert pressure on the sides of its container. In this case there is admittedly the danger not only of metaphysical misuse but of anthropomorphism. But that is another issue. REFERENCES Anscombe, G. E. M. and Geach, P. T.
