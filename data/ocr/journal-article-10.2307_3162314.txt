University of Pittsburgh, 1966. Director: Dr. Seymour Drescher. In 1825 Rev. John McEnery, the Roman Catholic Chaplain of Tor Ab- bey in Devonshire discovered human fossil remains and artifacts in conjunc- tion with the skeletons of extinct mam- mals in Kent's Cavern on the Devon- shire coast. The problems which faced him in interpreting what he had found so that it did not contradict the "true" meaning of the account of creation in Genesis set the stage for the confron- tation which developments in the earth and life sciences were forcing upon conservative, iconodulic natural theo- logians. Though McEnery's work seems to have been little known until the post- humous publication of his manuscript in 1859, the logic of events forced sev- eral other English Catholics to publicly encounter the problem of reinterpret- ing the meaning of Scripture in light of developments in science. Those in- dividual Catholics most centrally in- volved in forming an approach to what was variously called the "developmen- tal hypothesis," or "transformism," or "evolution," were men such as Nich- olas Cardinal Wiseman; the Catholic Egyptologist Peter Le Page Renouf; the convert and sometime editor of the Rambler, Richard Simpson; William Kirby Sullivan, the principal scientific contributor to the Home and Foreiqn Review; the convert founder of the Rambler, John Moore Capes; the con- vert editor of the Tablet, Frederick Lucas; and John Henry Newman. The available alternatives were much less exclusive of each other in this early period of the encounter than they came to be in the latter part of the nineteenth century when scientists such as Thomas Henry Huxley took on believers such as St. George Jack- son Mivart. Since the theologians often knew little about modern science, and the scientists came to care little for theology, the struggle between the two parties to this dispute was car- ried out on the common ground of philosophy. Perennial questions such as those involving the role of analogy, the nature of causation, the difference between the utility and the truth of any hypothesis, the distinction between "providence" and "chance," and the relation of language to the things sig- nified through it were contested be- tween the champions of positivistic natural science and those who defend- ed idealistic natural theology. The realization that there was much more than mere anthropomorphism in Genesis, plus their traditional reliance upon the teaching of the Church as the arbiter of the Bible saved English Ro- man Catholics from utimately predi- cating the truth of the Scriptures upon the "truth" of any one particular sys- tem of natural theology. The thought of Catholics in England moved from a predisposition to dismiss each new de- velopment in geology or biology as a mere fad to the point where, in 1864, some realized what was happening in these fields, and one, at least, could speak appreciatively of "the influence of time upon form." The record of this difficult but hopeful transition may be traced in the writings of Cardinal Wiseman, John Henry Newman, and in the English Catholic periodicals, the Dublin Review, the Tablet, the Ram- bler, and the Home and Foreign Re- view. By 1864 the first generation of Cath- olics in England to be fully enfran- chised since the sixteenth century had slowly become aware of what the great scientific issues of the age were. And, thanks to the largely unrequited efforts of a handful of "Liberal Cath- olics," it was not yet certain that the Catholic Church would lose the mod- em world by intellectual default.
