<plain_text><page sequence="1">ESSAY-REVIEWS EXPLANATION IN BIOLOGT. By J. H. Woodger. Being a Review of Experimental Embryology, by G. R. de Beer, M.A., B.Sc. [Pp. 148 with 51 illustrations.] (Oxford: At the Clarendon Press, 1926. Price 7 s. 6 d.) This attractive little book contrives, within the small com- pass of its 148 pages, to cover the whole field of modern ex- perimental inquiry into developmental processes, including regeneration and tissue culture, in a way well calculated to set the reader strenuously to think and to whet his appetite for more. The latter contingency is provided for by a tabular summary of the experiments at the end of the book, in which full references to the original sources are given. The birth of Entwicklungsmechanic was a momentous event in the history of the biological sciences. How lustily the infant has grown, and what shrewd knocks it is already giving to some of the cherished dogmas of its sedate predecessors 1 Before the advent of the experimental method, morphology occupied itself with speculations about events which were supposed to have happened at a period of time so remote as to be entirely free from all danger of verification or refutation. The application of experiment has shifted the focus of atten- tion from speculations about what organisms were once to questions about what they are and do now - problems to which we can reasonably hope to find a solution, and which are of vital interest for biological theory. Each short chapter in this book bristles with interesting controversial questions. The new data revealed call for the formation of new concepts to deal with them, and this has been done in regard to certain general features of the develop- mental process. These new notions give the general impres- sion of being crude tools for such intricate work, and when the attempt is made to think them out more fully and give them greater precision, many contradictions present themselves. Particularly do there seem to be cleavages between the con- cepts of genetics, cytology, and experimental embryology. But this is inevitable at the present stage of the problem, in which any suggestion which offers guidance for research will, so far at least, justify a trial. 697</page><page sequence="2">698 SCIENCE PROGRESS We may turn from questions of detail and consider certain fundamental matters of principle of a more general nature. It is interesting to note that the generation of biologists who are devoting themselves to this work is discovering that its first duty is the establishment of biological concepts ; in other words, that the problems of biology are not to be solved by a wholesale importation of the explanatory equipment of another science - neither by forcing the concrete facts pre- sented by the living organism into the abstract moulds of physics, nor by having recourse to the deus ex machina offered by the various sects of vitalism. In illustration of this change and of the seeming reluctance with which it is made, the following passage from Mr. de Beer's book may be quoted (P- 133): "Just as the properties and behaviour of chemical substances had to be determined before any great advance could be made in that science, so in biology the experimental method is revealing phenomena which one must call ' bio- logical properties ' of living matter ; such as the organisation of the axial structures by the dorsal lip of the blastopore or the formation of a lens by the activity of the eye-cup." There is a faint air of apology about the wording of this sentence which suggests that the author has not yet entirely freed his mind from the trammels of the mechanical philosophy. Chemical properties are quite correct, but biological properties require inverted commas ! Again, on p. 134 we read : " There is no hiding the fact that most of the complex components of development are as yet unintelligible, but by the experimental method the analysis is gradually splitting them up." Why should there be any question of " hiding " facts, except in the interests of a made-up mind which does not wish to be dis- turbed from its dogmatic slumbers ? The unconscious influence of the mechanical philosophy of the last three centuries is revealed in a curious way in the following passage from p. 1 34 : " With regard to the term ' explanation ' it must be remem- bered that ultimately nothing can be really explained. It is idle and absurd to imagine that experimental embryology will explain the development of organisms. What it can do is to show that the processes involved therein, however complicated and dissimilar they may be, obey certain definite laws." When experimental embryology succeeds in establishing these laws, surely it will thereby have offered an explanation of development. What other meaning can the word have in science? Mr. de Beer himself, in the second passage quoted, speaks of certain " components of development " as being " not yet intelligible " - implying that the progress of in- vestigation may some day render them so. A convenient word for rendering intelligible is explanation and that is its</page><page sequence="3">EXPLANATION IN BIOLOGY 699 usual meaning, without any reference to ultimate explanations which lie beyond the scope of science. Consider the following example of a genuine biological explanation. Suppose we have the following propositions : " All mammals secrete milk n and " All mammals bear hair." From this we might conclude that milk secretion and hair production always occur together in the same animal class. This suggests the further question : Is this connection merely " accidental " or are the two facts causally connected ? Further investigation shows that the first proposition can be put into the form : All mammals have milk-secreting glands in the skin ; and the second into the form : All mammals have a skin in which hairs develop. This narrows the common term down to the skin. Now it has been shown that the mammary glands are a specialisation of glands which always develop in connection with hairs. The connec- tion between mammary glands and hair is thus explained, i.e. made clear, and it is seen to be no mere chance association, by a gradual narrowing of the terms common to them both down to their developmental Anlagen. If now we go back to the original propositions, we see that a great deal has been accom- plished. An intelligible connection has been established between two things which at first seemed without any link save in the fact that they occurred together in the same animal group. It would be in the highest degree pedantic to deny the title of explanation to this process merely because still further questions present themselves. And yet we frequently find, even in biological literature, this denial of all claim to explanation. Whence comes this modesty of science ? It is to be traced to a remark in the introduction to a book on mechanics by Gustav Kirchoiï in which he declared the task of that science to be " die in der Natur vor sich gehenden Bewegungen vollständig und auf die einfachste Weise zu beschreiben.1' 1 This view was furnished with a philosophical basis and elaborated by Ernst Mach, into phenomenalism - a doctrine which has found much favour among those men of science who have considered such matters. It has been made familiar to English readers by Prof. Karl Pearson's Grammar of Science. The doctrine has been read by biologists, and faithfully copied by them in accordance with the belief that what is good for mechanics is good also for biology. There are grave objections to phenomenalism, and especially to the arguments by which it is reached, which are worth considering from the standpoint of biology. We can first inquire how it came to recommend itself to physicists, leaving aside the wider issues and concentrating on the question of explanation. During the development of science two processes have been going on. On the one hand there has been thinking in terms</page><page sequence="4">700 SCIENCE PROGRESS of real perceptible things, and on the other the working out of the discovery of Galileo that most of the qualities of bodies could be neglected for the purposes of physics if attention was confined to those which admitted of measurement, and hence of mathematical treatment. Now, when the corpuscular hypo- thesis of matter was employed for the investigation of terres- trial phenomena these two processes of thought continued. Physical objects were thought of as composed of ultimate particles far below the level of perception. But it was pos- sible to imagine these particles on the basis of perceptual experience, and the mental picture rendered many processes intelligible, e.g. the expansion of bodies under the influence of heat, etc. But at the same time the calculating process was also applicable. It was possible to treat the particles just as perceptible objects had been treated, in accordance with the Newtonian laws of motion, and, as everybody knows, with astonishing success. Later it began to be realised that the mental pictures of these things must be to a large extent illusory. A modern textbook of physics still tells us to regard molecules as " hard, perfectly elastic spheres," but how can they be spheres when they usually contain at least two atoms which are themselves particulate ? What meaning can be attached to such terms as hard or solid on the infra-perceptual level ? Finally, if we never meet perfectly elastic bodies in the perceptual world, upon what grounds can we assert their existence in the molecular realm ? Thus the tendency is to discard the mental picture as a convention or fiction which plays no lasting part in the explanatory process, the real work being done by the mathematics. In other words, progress is seen to lie in increasing precision and scope of calculation, but this brings no increase of intelligibility, and so explanation tends to be abandoned. This is still more clearly recognised to-day when the very latest concepts of physics can no longer be represented in the imagination at all because they are not directly borrowed from the perceptual world, and hence the doctrine of relativity can only be expounded in mathematical terms. These considerations enable us to see why Kirchoff wished to renounce explanation. If we add to these facts the banishment of force from physical thought as a mere anthro- pomorphism, and the fact that the criticisms of Hume have had their due effect, we realise why physics has tended to abandon all the real categories and come to rest finally on the formal ones which are all that is required by mathematics. This, of course, means the complete abandonment of explana- tion, and the question arises how far these facts concern biology. Anyone who takes the trouble to inquire will find that the changes now in progress in the fundamental principles of</page><page sequence="5">EXPLANATION IN BIOLOGY 701 scientific thought are nothing short of revolutionary, and are likely to have important consequences far beyond the confines of science. The difficulties of the mechanical philosophy, which has dominated that thought for more than three cen- turies, are no longer able to conceal themselves. Thinkers like Prof. A. N. Whitehead are endeavouring to repair the damage wrought by that " murderous stroke " (as the late Prof. James Ward called it) by which Descartes cut the world into two halves : the physical on the one hand, and the mental on the other. Later physical inquirers, who did not share the Cartesian theological predilections, which provided a link between the two, found no difficulty in seizing one half and abandoning the other. Thus natural philosophy exploited the mathematical treatment of the " real " primary qualities, and banished the secondaries to the " illusory " world of mind. Moral philosophy, on the other hand, gave its attention to the latter half and to the problems of the relation between the two. Phenomenalism oifered a way out of these perplexities by abandoning the real world and by contenting itself with renouncing all claims to make assertions about it. It tells us that in science we can do no more than devise conceptual schemes for subsuming the phenomena which, so it asserts, are all that is given to us in perception, because there is no real world apart from it. Mach says : " Das monstrose, unerkenn- bare ' Ding an sich,' welches hinter den Erscheinungen steht, ist der unverkennbare Zwillingsbruder des vulgaren Dinges, welcher den Rest seiner Bedeutung verloren hat !" 1 You may have as many alternative conceptual schemes as you please, preference only being given to the simplest. This doctrine claims to give its adherents freedom from the diffi- culties which beset others, but one wonders how many of its supporters really believe it, and how far it is possible to avoid difficulties by not looking at them." From this point of view we should look with suspicion on the fact that the last great English idealist - F. H. Bradley - gave this doctrine his bless- ing as a doctrine for science, for this suggests that such thinkers saw in it a convenient means of drawing the teeth of physical science - of rendering it harmless because meaningless. Under the influence of the New Realist Movement in epistemology phenomenalism must tend to lose favour, and modern thought 1 E. Mach: Erkenntnis und Irrtum, dritte Auflage, Leipzig, 1917, p. 10. 2 For example, how does the Doctrine of Evolution stand in the light of Phenomenalism ? Is it only a conceptual scheme for describing certain morphological appearances, or does it claim to apply to a real historical process ? Phenomenalism would seem to be committed to the former alternative, in which case it is difficult to see how it can use the doctrine in the way Mach does to interpret human psychology.</page><page sequence="6">702 SCIENCE PROGRESS is grappling with the difficulties which phenomenalism was content to set aside. This movement, in some directions at least, involves an abandonment of the all-embracing character of the mechanical philosophy with its over-generalising of abstractions, and a reinstatement of secondary qualities, mean- ings, activity, purpose, and values, and other non-spatial or non-measurable things into the real world. Because mechanics quite rightly banishes " force " and " activity " from its con- ceptual equipment as mere anthropomorphism is it correct to turn this deanthropomorphising process upon avOpwiros him- self? Because such things are now recognised as projections of ourselves upon the inorganic world, does it follow that they can also be dismissed from the very sphere from which they have been projected ? Yet it has been considered " necessary " on such grounds as these to consider spontaneity, activity, etc., as myths even in the organic realm. After more than three centuries under the dominion of these notions, thought is trying to reach a Weltanschauung, which will have an equal place for psychology as well as physics, and for art and ethics too. This means that biologists can take heart again and forge their own weapons for the attack on their own proper problems, without feeling the need to apologise for their bold- ness. In experimental embryology concepts borrowed from the physical sciences do not admit of calculations being made, and until they do that they are not really playing the same rôle as they do in" the sciences from which they have been borrowed and for which they were devised. Consequently they may be playing a spurious part tending to mislead rather than to guide. Explanation and calculation are quite different means of interpretation, as we see in those sciences in which calculation plays little or no part. It has been the custom to define natural science in such a way as to exclude all possibility of the introduction of pyscho- logical concepts, but, when this is extended to biology, it involves (at least in the case of man) the very process of cutting the organism into two which has been the source of all our troubles. It means regarding the body exclusively as a machine, and the mental function as either a meaningless col- lateral process of some kind, or as an utterly disparate thing with the flimsiest connection with the body. This complete separation of the biological from the psychological point of view is now recognised as having had unfortunate consequences for psychology, and there can be no doubt that the progress of biology has also been thereby retarded. We have a great deal to learn about organisms from psychology, as we have already learnt much from the physical sciences, but in neither case does this necessitate the crude and uncritical use of explanatory</page><page sequence="7">EXPLANATION IN BIOLOGY 703 tools taken directly from these related sciences. The notion of a hierarchy of sciences with mathematical physics at the bottom and biology at the top is totally misleading. Know- ledge may be more correctly likened to a net. Each science is independently concerned with the construction of its own portion of the whole, and although two portions will approach one another and involve mutual aid for their completion, this never absolves each one from devising ways and means for the fulfilment of its own task.</page></plain_text>
