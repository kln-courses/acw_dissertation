<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTHROPOMORPHIC CORPORATIONS, ELITES, AND MONOPOLY POWER By EARL LATHAM Amherst College This is a paper on political theories of monopoly power, with special reference to Galbraith, Mills, and Berle. The political scientist who reads material on monopolies written by economists is struck by three things. First, people who write about monopoly are usually talking about something else, not about monopoly in the strict sense of the word. The talk is rarely about an industry situation dominated by a single seller, but often about the sizes of enterprises, collusion among businessmen, oligopolistic co-operation, unfair competitive practices (like price discriminations), and so on. For this paper, the formulation made by Walter Adams and Horace Gray is useful: ". . . an industry situation where a single firm or a small group of firms-by virtue of horizontal, vertical, or conglomerate integration-possess substantial economic power." The key phrase is "substantial economic power," for it is in the governance of this power that political science is interested. Second, the political scientist is impressed by the scholarship that has produced many valuable prescriptions for the regulation of specific aspects of the antitrust problem. In the interests of making the economy more competitive, there is no lack of wit and wise counsels to make it so; only a lack of will. Third, there seems to be an increasing tendency to discuss monopoly as a problem of power although some who do so show less respect for precision than when talking, say, about the marginal utility of differential increments. The political scientist concerns himself with the phenomena of power, and although many of its manifestations cannot be quantified, some can, and to read discourse that treats "power" without definition or discrimination can be as fruitless as economic discussions which are confined to general statements about "wealth." But precise or not, theories of power in human relations are "political theories"; and theories of monopoly power are political theories in a sociological context. 1. The Politics of Economics. The study of politics within the last twenty years has tended to push away from an earlier preoccupation with the forms and institutions of the public government; and political scientists have learned again what Madison and Calhoun never forgot; namely, that government and society intersect each other and that 303</page><page sequence="2">304 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION both contribute links in the same mesh of social controls. Business is a system of power, says one. The American Medical Association has a political life, says another. The A. T. and T. is a structure of private government. Such statements show an awareness that systems of sanc- tions wielded by official agencies and private organizations resemble each other closely; and that the differences are sometimes merely ascriptive and not organic. Some economists seem to exhibit the same insight. Corporations are structures of power. There are structures of power and patterns of influence in the factory as surely recognizable as in city hall or the United Nations. What the authors of the American Business Creed call the managerial view of the economic system is a recognition of the essentially political nature of that system, that men used to say was autonomous and automatic, untouched by human hands. To one out- side the guild, it has seemed that economists have moved from talk about perfect competition to talk about imperfect competition, oligopo- listic competition, workable competition, or, as Adams and Gray say, "workable monopoly"; and that this change reflects growing under- standing of the basic political nature of the economy. The very notion of competition assumes the existence of regularized rules (imposed by natural forces) upon the struggle of large numbers of men for scarce resources. This is a problem of power which for a long time seems to have been obscured by the fiction that men did not make the rules. 2. Unavailing Countervailance. Still a further sign of the growing awareness of the political nature of economic activity is the appearance of theory about monopoly power, a phrase preferred to "monopoly competition" because discourse about monopoly competition seems to apply to monopoly, analysis that was originally developed for situa- tions assumed to be non-monopolistic. The phrase "monopoly power" seems more accurately to state the new interest, because prime con- cern is not with aberrations in the performance of an ideal price mechanism (although this is involved) but with control of the behavior of monopolists as the commanders of important social power. Three such theories of monopoly power are of special interest: one by an economist, one by a sociologist, and one by a lawyer-economist. All three may be viewed as explanations and interpretations of the pre- siding political characteristic of the economy in the twentieth cen- tury-concentration of economic power-and may be judged, there- fore, as works of amateur political theory. The first of the three writers is John Galbraith. In a 1953 review of his book on American Capitalism, Walter Adams pointed out that the thesis of countervailing power was undermined by vertical integra- tion and top-level financial control; and he thought that bilateral</page><page sequence="3">THE MONOPOLY PROBLEM 305 monopolies created through countervailance were not a happy solution of the economic power problem, that interindustry competition was not a meaningful substitute for competition in the neoclassical sense, that countervailance through governmental regulation was often sub- verted by the creation of a community of interest between the agency and the clientele it was supposed to regulate, and that the whole thing anyway rested upon the dubious assumption that giant-sized firms are the inevitable result of modern technology and economics. The political scientist can accept such criticisms where they seem to be justified and add certain others. He would reject the claim of the author that the phenomenon of countervailing power "has gone un- recognized in economic or political theory." In fact it is one of a numerous family of political theories with a sociological base, dating at least from the time of Polybius. The elements of countervailance that Polybius analyzed in the Roman Republic were "accurately adjusted and in exact equilibrium," so as automatically to oppose power with power. There are many other such theories in the literature of politics. James Madison, for example, had a theory of interests, or the elements of such a theory, more sophisticated in its understanding (although not worked out in the same detail) than that of Marx who, with Hegel, called "dialectic" what Galbraith calls "countervailance." John C. Calhoun also had a theory of interests in which substantial social and economic elements were expected to block and countervail the power of adver- sary groups. It is perhaps the name of Arthur Bentley, among the Americans, which should be given most credit and prominence for inventing Galbraith's conception of countervailing power. Borrowing his basic concepts from sociology, he saw society as a seethe of groups intersect- ing and crisscrossing each other; in continuous social competition for advantage; making and unmaking organizations to counteract and countervail the power of adversary and hostile groups; shifting weights and influence from one plane of social tension to another; moving and thrusting for position, preferment and power; working in, through, above, behind, beyond, and under the formal institutions of the public government; now joining, now resisting these formal institutions of the public goverment, themselves parties in interest and combatants in the fray. Bentley did not make the mistake that Galbraith seems to make throughout, in supposing an artificial separation between govern- ment and the social and economic groups it regulates. When government intervenes, it is often merely another form of pressure which social and economic groups can bring to bear upon each other. The government in an open society like that of the United States tends to take on the form and color of the principal groups that</page><page sequence="4">306 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION put it in power and tend to support it; and policy tends to be formed in the interests of and for the benefit of such supporting groups. The cur- tailment of monopoly power will not occur by virtue of the semiauto- matic operation of Galbraith's simplified pluralism. It will occur at that point when a large enough combination of groups of farmers, unions, small businessmen, organized consumers in various walks, lawyers, intellectuals, and so on elect enough congressmen and per- haps a president who will put into law any one of the excellent pro- grams for the control of monopoly (like that of Stocking and Watkins, for example) that are now available. This happened twice before, dur- ing the periods of Populist and Wilsonian progressivism, and it may never happen again. If it does not, it will be because indispensable elements in such a coalition lack the necessary will to organize. 3. The Power Elite. Opposed to the unavailing political theory of countervailance is the doctrine of The Power Elite, recently published by the second of the three writers considered in this paper, C. Wright Mills. Mills rejects Galbraith's position as the "romantic pluralism of the Jeffersonian ideal," denies that the people really govern themselves either directly or through responsive representatives, and asserts that decisive power in America is in the keeping of an interlocking struc- ture of three orders, whose ruling circles constitute the power elite- the orders being the economic, political, and military. False, says he, is the "image of a balancing society in which no unit of power is powerful enough to do more than edge forward a bit at a time, in compromised countervailance with other such forces, and in which, accordingly, there is no unity, much less co-ordination, among the higher circles." So we learn that effective power in America is in the hands of the corporate rich, the warlords, and the political directorate. These orders have an interlocking membership and transfer from one to the other at the top is relatively easy. General MacArthur sells typewriters and Charlie Wilson manufactures defense and security. The power that this elite wields derives from the institutions the membership occupies. The merit of this approach, as Robert Lynd has pointed out, is that contemporary power is viewed not piecemeal but as a whole, a point of view which is often weakened by "analyses that deal only in immediate terms of personality, or of whether monopoly is or is not efficient, or of bureaucracy, or of other isolated aspects." A further merit of this approach is that it does not talk just of economic power- as economists do-or of governmental authority-as political scientists tend to do-but of what Lynd has also described as the "most charac- teristic feature of power in society" in that "separate powers . .. tend</page><page sequence="5">THE MONOPOLY PROBLEM 307 to flow together in working arrangements and so to become a structure of power coterminous with the society." But the theory is inadequate in many respects: it is incomplete, partial, and unsystematic; the orders somehow appeared as a conse- quence of capitalism but no explanation says why; the orders are too rigidly stratified and unwarrantedly autonomous and separate; unlike other elitist theories, that of Mills does nothing with the con- cept of class and therefore has no explanation for the asserted co- herence of supposed interest among the upper circles of the three orders. Presumably corporate power is the decisive member of this triad of twentieth-century estates, although the analysis also seems to assign equal weights to the other two elements at times. Perhaps the greatest weakness, however, is that the theory is simplistic, like that of Marx who assumed the existence of two classes of adversary but homogeneous interest in fateful war with each other. It is the suggestion of this paper that Galbraith and Mills are both wrong for reasons peculiar to their particular shortcomings. The countervailance of monopoly power is not so easy as Galbraith im- agines, nor so automatic; and the impregnability of corporate power is not so great as Mills thinks, because the society is not constructed the way he says it is. The pattern of opposing interests is more complex than he will allow; and the ways to organize them against any one of his orders through political action are many and viable. 4. Corporate Anthropomorphism. This leads to the third of the writers on the political theory of the economy, A. A. Berle, whose book, The Twentieth Century Capitalist Revolution, may convince some readers that it is foolish to oppose corporate power. Like Galbraith, Berle claims the discovery of lands explored and mapped by others long ago. The corporation is a political institution (Mills says this also) and deserves to be studied as such: "This is the stuff of pure political theory [otherwise unidentified]. It has been disregarded thus far, chiefly because in recent years, pure theory in political science has received all too little attention." One gets the feeling that this would not have been so if Berle had not been so busy. The tremendous work in the political theory of corporations done by von Gierke, Figgis, Maitland, Pollock, Laski, and others is not mentioned. Hobbes in the seventeenth century had some appropriate strictures on corpora- tions, which he likened to worms in the body politic. Berle goes beyond this. For him, corporations seem to be people-not just folks, exactly, but institutions endowed with some of the attributes of personality. Berle's anthropomorphic corporations have life and survival, are par- thenogenetically reproductive, have intelligence, will, and, above all,</page><page sequence="6">308 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION conscience. The older checks on corporate power (the capital market and competition) have lost their vitality but others may be emerging: the force of public opinion and the fact that although the "concen- trates" are powerful, ordinarily they are not single sellers. There is also the power of the state to balance the power of the concentrates. Thus Berle stands midway between Galbraith and Mills and shares the errors of both. He perpetrates the fallacy of the separation of state and society (Galbraith) while he ascribes to the corporation most of the attributes of what political science used to call state sovereignty (Mills). It is in his Millsean mood that Berle comes close to abolishing the state and turning its functions over to the corporations. The power of the corporation, he says, "though limited, is in large measure, abso- lute." And further, there is sound historical basis for asserting "that the corporation has some color of state authority." Indeed, the corpora- tion has "de facto at least invaded the political sphere and has become in fact, if not in theory, a quasi-governing agency." And it seems to govern quite as well if not better than the public agencies of the state. The State Department, for example, has left most of the important decisions in important sectors of international affairs to the judgment of private corporations. Corporations, more successfully than nation- states, have achieved stable world government (in oil). In a final surge of Utopian vision, Berle commits posterity to the benevolent gover- nance of soulful corporations: "In the coming 'City of God,' the state is not to be the dominant factor." Although the state has not exactly withered away, most of its functions will have become unnecessary because they will be performed by corporations. 5. Towards a More Perfect Union. These suggestions of Berle are very interesting and imagination moves to draw the features within the profile he has sketched. Berle speaks of the corporations as though they were states of the Union and even says that he expects the time will come when the Supreme Court will hold under certain circumstances that corporations are under the restrictions of the Fourteenth Amend- ment. This may not be unreasonable. Some of the historical states of the Union began as commercial corporations. It needs only a small push of speculation to imagine a constitutional convention like that of 1787 to bring the new corporate states into a more perfect union with the rest of the country. Although the prospect is remote for the estab- lishment of a "Corporate States of America," the fancy may contain a grain of truth that is worth salvaging. When men like David Lilienthal in his book, Big Business, can pro- pose the adoption of a "basic economic law" which bids us to embrace even bigger businesses and to cast out worry about preserving compe-</page><page sequence="7">THE MONOPOLY PROBLEM 309 tition and small business, the time has come to consider patterns of control that will be commensurate with the size and nature of the objects to be controlled, as Lilienthal says, in the public interest. No mere commission administering a single statute of regulation will be equal to the task. Perhaps the whole power of people should be summoned to the task before Berle dissipates the state. The Constitu- tion of 1787 provides a pattern of control and power for the integration of the historical states into a single Union. Perhaps Berle's conscience- guided corporations and Lilienthal's supergiants of business might be similarly integrated. The 1787 pattern would at least have the merit of arresting the push towards domination of the state which he previ- sions and which Mills says has arrived. At a stroke, the 1787 design deprived the historical states of military and diplomatic powers and of the power to coin money. The condot- tiere of the twentieth century-Brink's, Pinkerton's, and other protec- tive services-might be disarmed and their functions given to the central authority. It should be possible to recover control of foreign policy from Berle's corporate states; and to recover control of the currency by transferring the functions of commercial banks to the central government. The 1787 Constitution guaranteed to each state a republican form of government. Berle speaks of corporate power as "in a large measure, absolute," and Mills says of corporations that they are "of course totalitarian and dictatorial." The credentials of corporate states could be refused until reorganization had made them less absolute and dictatorial and more republican in form. The 1787 Constitution gave the central government the power to regulate elec- tions in the states, and this might be a useful power to vest in the central government over the corporate states. Since no one in a political election can vote by proxy, the central government might require each of the voters in stockholders' elections to exercise the franchise himself. The purchase of elections would be forbidden, and the cost of elections would be borne by the candidates and the parties they represent and would not become a charge against the corporation, as is now some- times the case. As in 1787, the right of taxation would be a concurrent power, taxa- tion being understood as the power of a corporate state to appropriate, by manipulating prices, certain sums from the buyer for the mainte- nance of the corporate state. Each citizen of a corporate state, like each citizen of a historical state, would be entitled to the privileges and im- munities of citizens of the several corporate states. Among these rights is immunity from discriminatory taxation. Discriminatory prices would therefore be unconstitutional. Since no new state can be created out of another without the latter's consent and no state may acquire the</page><page sequence="8">310 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION territory of another, there will be ample constitutional justification for policing mergers, amalgamations, and other attempts at combina- tion. The control of patents will be vested exclusively in the central government after being taken away from the corporate states. It will not then be possible for the larger corporate states to maintain and even increase their size by patent arrangements, all of which will be under the direct supervision of the central government. If the 1787 design were to extend not only to the control but to the representation of the corporate states, it would be necessary to devise a bicameral system. The lower house would be elected by the people of the corporate states and would represent them on the basis of numbers. All corporate states would have equal representation in the upper house. This presumably would automatically take care of the interests of small corporations, since they would have equal (even su- perior) power. One corporate Nevada would equal one corporate New York. As the small historical states knew when they strove for equal representation in 1787, such a device as a corporate Senate will prevent the exploitation of the small by the large members of the Union. The opportunity that equal representation would give the small states to set the tax (price) level would also automatically free them from the domination of the big ones in this field. The new upper house would confirm ambassadors to foreign countries, as is now the case, and the principle of senatorial courtesy should give small corporations a chance to take their places in the embassies abroad, alongside Gen- eral Foods, Crown-Zellerbach, American Telephone and Telegraph, and other large corporations. If the 1787 experience were to be repeated, the fight over the ratifi- cation of the new corporate constitution would be stern, with the anti- federalist party among the corporate states arguing, as the historical states did, that there is no need for a strong central authority, that the corporate states could be trusted to observe equity and do justice. Berle's statements about the moderating effects of the new conscience which he has observed among his humanoid corporations might be cited to support this view. But James Madison may be offered in rebuttal: "In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed. . ..</page></plain_text>
