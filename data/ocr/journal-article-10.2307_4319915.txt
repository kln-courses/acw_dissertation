<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROD BERTOLET SPEAKER REFERENCE (Received 4 August, 1986) It is a plausible thought that speaker's reference is somehow a function of the intentions of the speaker. To give any real weight to this thought, though, the details of a theory centering on such intentions must be provided. I try to sketch and defend such a theory in this paper. After some preliminary remarks, I shall start with two views that seem to me inadequate. My own approach is detailed in Section III, and the remainder of the paper is a defense of that approach. There are by now sufficiently many papers whose titles contrast speaker's reference and semantic reference for it to be reasonable to simply assume that there is a viable distinction between the two, but a couple of examples may be helpful. As Kripke observes, one might refer to Smith, the fellow raking the leaves in the distance, when one utters "What's Jones doing over there anyhow?", though "Jones" is not a name of Smith and (on the usual stories, a fortiori) Smith is not the semantic referent of "Jones".' Donnellan is famous for having earlier made a similar point concerning descriptions - one might refer to a given teetotaler with the phrase "the man with the martini" if one mistakenly took him to be imbibing, or if one knew one's audience to have that mistaken belief.2 I shall assume that what a speaker refers to by using a singular term in such cases is not determined by the factors which determine what the semantic referent of the term is, even if there is one. (In the "man with the martini" case just noted, it is my view that on at least some ways of more fully describing the example that phrase does not have a semantic referent.)3 The issue I am concerned with is what factors do determine the speaker's reference. I also assume that the kind of singular term a speaker uses when referring to something is irrelevant. Whether reference is achieved via a name or a description or a pronoun (anaphoric or deictic) or a demonstrative or what have you, the theory of what the speaker refers Philosophical Studies 52 (1987) 199-226. C 1987 by D. Reidel Publishing Company.</page><page sequence="2">200 ROD BERTOLET to ought to invoke the same factors as the determinants of the speaker's referent. The final assumption that seems worth mentioning is that there is a difference between simply referring, and referring plus actually getting the hearer to recognize what is referred to.4 If I utter to my class "Frege's argument for this is interesting, so let's examine it", I will have referred to an argument of Frege's even if they do not yet know which argument shall occupy us. People with large families are constantly saying things like "My brother broke his leg yesterday!", leaving the rest of us to wonder just which of four brothers this might be, hence which of eight legs is now encased in plaster. My concern is with reference, understood and otherwise. Here is what Keith Donnellan advertises as the main idea of his theory of reference: ... when a speaker uses a name intending to refer to an individual and predicate something of it, successful reference will occur when there is an individual that enters into the historically correct explanation of who it is that the speaker intended to predicate something of. That individual will then be the referent ...5 Doing some violence to at least the letter of this passage, I shall promote it into a full-blown theory.6 There are at least two problems I see with the resulting view. One difficulty involves the utterance of sentence fragments. Were a colleague to inquire whose work I was thinking about, my somewhat laconic response would be "Donnellan". Now I have no doubt that I would, by uttering this, refer to Donnellan. And I have no wish to deny that my hearer would be intended to recover from the context of the conversation what he is intended to believe about the referent - in this case, that Donnellan is the person whose work I am considering. Indeed, were this not so, the practice of responding to who-questions simply with names would be impossible. Not all that I intend my audience to believe, even as a rather direct result of my linguistic performance, is something I predicate, however: consider Gricean implicatures. To predicate is to perform a particular linguistic act, and I think it clear that there is no such act I would perform, or intend to perform, in uttering "Donnellan". References of this sort are a commonplace of ordinary conversational life, but they do not appear to be construable in terms of an intention to predicate</page><page sequence="3">SPEAKER REFERENCE 201 something of the referent: not all acts of reference have as their point setting up a candidate for predication, common though this may be for the utterance of a full indicative sentence. Let's see what the opposition looks like before turning to the other problem with Donnellan's view. II Grice's analysis of meaning suggests a natural adaptation to a theory of speaker reference.7 Gail Stine once published a version of such a theory which runs as follows, where indentifying is glossed as "picking out who it is one has in mind (a transparent notion for which substitutivity of identity for singular terms holds)": (A) By uttering X U referred to a =df U uttered X intending: (1) that his utterance of X bring it about that a certain audience A identify a; (2) that A recognize U's intention in (1) (3) that A's recognition of U's intention (1) shall function as at least part of A's reason for identifying a.8 Earlier I said that Donnellan's view has two shortcomings, but I noted only one. The second drawback, one that Gricean theories sidestep nicely, is that it fails to take us beyond purely linguistic intentions. Intending to predicate something of x is a notion applicable only to linguistic behavior, and it seems to me a step forward to work with a notion that has application beyond such behavior. The project, or at least what I take to be the ultimate project of the philosophy of language, is to understand the linguistic (and underlying) skills that enable us to communicate with one another. Progress toward this dimly visible goal is to be made by introducing non-linguistic factors, rather than remaining satisfied with specifically linguistic factors such as intending to predicate something of an object.9 (At least this is where progress lies on the road to the kind of naturalistic theory of persons and their place in the universe that I favor.) There are then two ways in which the view Donnellan sketches fails to be fully adequate: it would at most apply to references accompanied by actual acts of predication, and it remains rooted in a family of linguistic terms. The move to a Gricean theory is then a step in the right direction.</page><page sequence="4">202 ROD BERTOLET However, I think Stine backed the wrong non-linguistic intention, since I think that the view that results from building the account around the intention that the hearer identify the referent is too strong. To revert to my earlier example, in which I begin to turn my class's attention to an argument of Frege's, I do not intend that my students identify, at this stage, Frege or an argument of his that I wish to discuss: part of the point of the class is that I'm going to set it out for them. (There is, it is true, a fair bit of education that consists of teachers and students telling one another what everyone already knows and what everyone knows everyone already knows - were it otherwise the examination system would require substantial revamping. But it isn't all like that!) There are questions, neither easy nor unimportant, about just how "identify" is to be construed, whether in intending that you identify my cat Phoebe you be able to distinguish her from other cats of similar coloration, or even the other cat in my house. Such is suggested not merely by the term, but also by the background literature on identifying descriptions which informs this discussion. What is nice about the Frege example is that it precludes all but the most torturous construals of "identify".'0I III I propose to build the account of speaker's reference around a different notion, intending to direct someone's attention to something. This notion also has application outside of linguistic behavior; I can e.g. intend to direct your attention to my bleeding finger by holding it up in front of you. Perhaps a bird can intend to direct the attention of a predator toward itself and away from its offspring by parading in front of that predator; if not it is only because this typical nature program description is unduly anthropomorphic. The drawback with the notion is that it is a least a little vague, and I cannot do more here than rely on an intuitive understanding of it. Perhaps the addition of a word or two will help though. There is a model of thinking of an object on which the mind's long arm, equipped with either a complete description of the object or a map of the external world (or both), reaches out and grabs onto the object, thereby making it the object of thought. Aside from a curious mixing of metaphors or perhaps images, the model suffers the defect of being</page><page sequence="5">SPEAKER REFERENCE 203 wrong (and that is a primary lesson to be learned from the negative aspect of the program pursued by causal theorists of semantic refer- ence, whatever the merits of the positive pictures they provide). That, in brief if too briefly, is why there is no need to identify an object in order to have one's attention directed to it, nor a need to intend that someone identify an object in order to intend that that someone's attention be directed to that object. (This, again, on the construal of "identify" that I think is most natural in light of the philosophical literature.) Magicians are deceivers, but they do not in asking us to direct our attention to the value of the card that has been selected by a member of the audience (but not yet revealed) ask us to indulge in the logically impossible or conceptually incoherent. Perhaps a homely example will prove helpful. Imagine that you bring home your child's Christmas present in a large box, and show the child the box saying, "Well, your present is in here. I'm not going to tell you what it is, I don't even want you to ask me for any clues, and I'd surely better not find you peeking in the box". You will have mischievously if not maliciously intended to direct your child's attention to the present, no doubt with some success. You will certainly not have intended that the child identify the present." This may still leave the notion of intending to direct someone's attention to something fuzzy around the edges: nonetheless, I think that we may gain a deeper understanding of what reference is utilizing this notion, specifying in what way a speaker has to intend to direct his hearer's attention to something in order to refer to it. It certainly cannot be in any old way, since I can intend to direct your attention, and indeed so direct it, to my office by setting it on fire. It's almost time for the story, but first some abbreviations. Since we are interested in situations in which people refer to things with words, we shall need some words, some expression e. (I don't think one can refer to something, as opposed to indicate it, without doing so with some words.) Let S vary over the sentences or sentence fragments in which e will occur (we allow for the possibility that S = e),12 and let U range over speakers (utterers) and H over hearers. "U D-intends x" will abbreviate "U intends to direct the hearer's (H's) attention to x". Now we want there to be some connection between e, or the utterance of e, and the hoped-for focusing on the referent by the hearer. We might as a</page><page sequence="6">204 ROD BERTOLET first shot try to put all this together as follows: (R) U refers to x iff U utters some S such that (1) e occurs in S (2) U D-intends x by uttering e. Clarification (or if you like qualification) is immediately in order. All of this is in relation to a certain set of circumstances c, so that every clause in (R) deserves to end with "in c". Since the qualifier belongs everywhere, we can drop it so long as we do not forget about it. But it is important not to forget about it, since U might D-intend quite different objects by uttering the same expressions (different tokens of the same type) in different circumstances; the point is obvious enough with "that" but has broader application. No special connection,between e and x is assumed to necessarily hold; in particular no semantic connection is presumed. Demanding such a connection would preclude us from explaining how one might refer to something by using a description it does not satisfy, or a reference to Smith via "Jones".'3 Consequently, x need not be in the extension of e - indeed it may be that nothing is. Otherwise it would be hard to account for a reference to Mitterand with that notoriously vacuous phrase, "the present king of France". Neither, however, is a semantic connection between e and x precluded. Such a prohibition would be a singularly bad idea, since using a description an object does satisfy, or its name, is in general a quite splendid way to further one's referential intentions. Even so clarified/qualified, (R) isn't right. Those familiar with Grice's discussion of meaning will suspect, quite correctly, that the intention mentioned in (2) must be of a certain kind. If I know that you have been hypnotized to think of little red devils who attack the inside of your lungs with blowtorches whenever you hear the word "cigarette(s)", perhaps so that you will quit smoking (though you may if you like amend the example to feature an even more perverse hypnotist), I can utter "Cigarettes are getting really expensive" intending to direct your attention to those creatures by uttering "cigarettes". But were I to do that, I would not be referring to the little devils. The explanation for this is not that there aren't any little devils, but that I've caused you to think of the torch-wielders, whereas when I refer to them I want my utterance to be the reason your attention is directed to them.14 The way to try to make my utterance a reason for you to attend to</page><page sequence="7">SPEAKER REFERENCE 205 something, it would seem, is to try to get you to see why I have produced it; the best way to incorporate this point into the theory being developed seems to be to add to (R) the stipulation that U intends that H recognize that U D-intends x by uttering e, more briefly, (3) U intends that H recognize that (2). There is also the not entirely separate matter of the connection between these intentions. There is a point here concerning the essential openness of communicative efforts about which it is difficult to be concise, clear and convincing all at once. and this is not the place to be expansive. The idea, perhaps too briefly, is that there is something about the thought of covertly telling someone something that is incoherent. I do not, of course, mean that one cannot whisper, pass notes or signal for a slider. The point is rather that my intending that an audience come to think something on the basis of what I utter, even while intending that this intention be recognized, without intending that the audience form the thought because intended to recognize that this is what I'm up to, is not my telling the audience something, or my meaning, in the sense with which Grice has long been concerned, that thing is the case. (It may indeed bring the audience to think something, but so too does the electrical stimulation suffered by the star of our Brain in a Vat stories.) The situation is similar, I think, with reference: in the genuine cases, U intends that H's attention be directed to x on the basis of H's recognition that he is so intended to focus on x. This being so, we should add to (R) U intends that H's attention be directed to x at least partly on the basis of H's recognition that U D-intends x by uttering e. The account, when amended (and written out with greater care) is this: (R) U refers to x iff (3e) (3S) (3x) (3H) such that U utters S and (1) e occurs in S (2) x is such that U D-intends it by uttering e (3) U intends that H recognize that (2) (4) U intends that H's attention be directed to x at least partly on the basis of H's recognition that (2).15</page><page sequence="8">206 ROD BERTOLET Clause (2) is written as it is to emphasize that there is no proposition (not even a Kaplan-style singular proposition) that U is attempting to convey here.'6 I think this is satisfactory as is stands; those who would insist that all reference must proceed under some mode of presentation and that this should be reflected in our theories of semantics and speech acts rather than those of psychology will be happier if (2) is rewritten to say that U intends that there be some mode of presentation such that U D-intends x under it by uttering e. (Not, though, that there is a mode of presentation under which U intends that the hearer's attention be directed to x: I may not care at all whether you think of our friend John as the 0 or the U or whatever; all we could demand is that there be some mode of presentation under which you think of John. And if modes of presentation are to be insisted upon, I would in turn insist that they not be limited to descriptions.) '7 A further qualification is called for once we remember that conversations persist over time. It may in the case of a continuing conversation seem a bit odd - one might even think dead wrong - to claim that the speaker intends to direct the hearer's attention to someone on whom the hearer's attention is already firmly focused. This may be accommodated by construing "U D-intends x by uttering e" in such cases as "U utters e with the intention that H's attention be directed to x". (Two further qualifications will be introduced in Sections V and IX below.) There are, to put it mildly, a number of counterexamples one might attempt against this view. I have discussed some of them, involving demonstratives, elsewhere, and will not repeat that discussion here.'8 The remaining sections of this paper will be devoted to some of the rest. IV Since there is a substantial body of literature with putative counter- examples to Grice's analyses, initial and amended, of meaning, it is only natural to look to that literature for counterexamples to (R).'9 Before descending into the details, we can say of the examples due to Urmson, Stampe, Strawson and Schiffer which Grice discusses that they are all nonlinguistic: they all involve doing something, without speaking, which</page><page sequence="9">SPEAKER REFERENCE 207 does not mean anything, or at least not what the analysis requires. I do not think it possible to construct cases analogous to these which employ genuinely linguistic utterances, and since I think that reference essen- tially involves such utterances I don't think counterexamples analogous to these will be forthcoming. Be that as it may, let us see what an attempt to develop such counterexamples would be like.20 The provisional account of meaning with which Grice begins is "U meant something by uttering x" is true iff, for some audience A, U uttered x intending (1) A to produce a particular response r (2) A to think (recognize) that U intends (1) (3) A to fulfill (1) on the basis of his fulfillment of (2).21 The counterexamples in question gain their force from the fact that someone can produce certain "utterances" broadly construed (that is, actions) which do not mean anything (or at least not what Grice's story requires) and are such that (4) and (5) below are not fulfilled, so that (4) and (5) must apparently be added to the analysis: (4) A's production of r to be based (at least in part) on A's thought that U intended that (1) (that is, on A's fulfillment of (2)) (5) A to think that U intended (4). I will use as models the cases Grice concedes force revisions in his analysis. One, due to Stampe, is this: A man is playing bridge against his boss. He wants to earn his boss' favor, and for this reason he wants his boss to win, and furthermore he wants his boss to know that he wants him to win (his boss likes that kind of self-effacement). He does not want to do anything too blatant, however, like telling his boss by word of mouth, or in effect telling him by some action or signal, for fear the boss might be offended by his crudity. So he puts into operation the following plan: when he gets a good hand, he smiles in a certain way; the smile is very like, but not quite like, a spontaneous smile of pleasure. He intends his boss to detect the difference and argue as follows: "That was not a genuine give-away smile, but the simulation of such a smile. That sort of simulation might be a bluff (on a weak hand), but this is bridge not poker, and he would not want to get the better of me, his boss, by such an impropriety. So probably he has a good hand, and, wanting me to win, hoped I would learn that he has a good hand by taking his smile as a spontaneous give-away. That being so, I shall not raise my partner's bid".22 Now Grice's three conditions are satisfied - the man (1) intended that</page><page sequence="10">208 ROD BERTOLET the boss should think that the employee had a good hand, (2) intended that the boss should think, because of the smile, that the employee intended the boss to think that the hand was a good one, and (3) intended that the boss' reason for thinking the employee had a good hand should be that the employee wanted him to think that. What seems to be missing, Grice notes, is the intention that the boss think that he is intended to think the employee wants him to think the hand is a good one; the employee wants to curry favor, but he wants his boss' insight into his performance to stop at the realization that he is being self-effacing. A similar counterexample, directed against my analysis, might appeal to the following sort of maneuver. Suppose I want to get on your good side, and that I believe a way to do this is to make you think that I agree with you that Ed Meese isn't really trying to subvert the civil rights laws. But I am afraid that just telling you this is too obvious, and that you will either see through my ploy or just doubt my sincerity. So, I arrange for you to overhear my conversation with a third party, during which I (heatedly) say "Meese is not trying to turn back the clock on civil rights". Here, the analog of Grice's fourth condition is not satisfied: I do not intend that you are intended to think that I want your attention directed to Meese, since I want you to believe that you are accidentally overhearing me. But it is also quite clear to me that I have referred to Meese in this attempt to get you to think I have a belief that I don't actually have, so this does not show that a condition analogous to Grice's (4) is needed. Another example, which leads Grice to formulate his fifth condition, is due to Stephen Schiffer. The utterer U is in a room with a man A who is notoriously avaricious, but who also has a certain pride. U wants to get rid of A. So U, in full view of A, tosses a five-pound note out of the window. He intends that A should think as follows: "U wants to get me to leave the room, thinking that I shall run after the five-pound note. He also wants me to know that he wants me to go (so contemptuous was his performance). But I am not going to demean myself by going after the banknote; I shall go, but I shall go because he wants me to go. I do not care to be where I am not wanted."23 Now, what would an example similar to this be? (Things begin to get rather strange here, and the bizarreness of the example is not exactly a point in its favor, but let us indulge Russell's advice against being afraid of absurdity if we wish to be philosophers and pursue it anyway.)</page><page sequence="11">SPEAKER REFERENCE 209 Suppose that you are a Nixon apologist, but know that I am not. I utter "I see that Nixon's credibility is on the rise again" intending that you reason thus: "He wants me to think of Nixon, thinking I'll do this when he utters 'Nixon'. But he only wants me to thinik of Nixon so that he can ridicule Nixon, and I won't fall for that again (I'm tired of hearing such a great man mocked). I will think of Nixon, but only because I want to!". Whether I could rationally intend that you go through this chain of reasoning is I think a very good question, but if I can, the example poses no problem. For it is again clear that I have referred to Nixon, and since the analog of Grice's (5) is not satisfied, the example fails to show that such a condition is required. Thus Schiffer's counterexample to Grice does not translate into a counterexample to (R) either. So far as I can tell, none of these difficulties with Grice's theory of meaning translate into objections to (R). There is one further notorious difficulty with Gricean theories to consider, that of soliloquy, but for reasons which will emerge, I shall put off discussion of this issue until Section X. v One may question, as Donnellan did in commenting on an earlier version of this paper, whether reference can really be completely divorced from predication in the way that my view allows. He suggested that the president might, in uttering "We must remember that we always have a duty to resist terrorism and also to protect the lives of American citizens abroad", fulfill (R)'s conditions for a speaker's reference to the invasion of Grenada in using the words "to protect the lives of American citizens abroad". But surely there is no reference to the Grenada invasion here. The difficulty I think Gricean theories face here is, in general terms, distinguishing reference from allusion: there are numerous things to which speakers allude but to which they do not actually refer. The distinction needed to accommodate this fact contrasts the relatively narrow responses one intends to provoke in one's audience by the use of singular terms (or sentences), and the broader purposes, or perhaps intended (hoped for?) direction, of the conversations in which one</page><page sequence="12">210 ROD BERTOLET engages. There is surely some such distinction as this. For convenience, I shall speak as if the distinction is between different kinds of inten- tions, though it seems more accurate to say that what distinguishes these intentions is a difference in the mechanisms by which they might be satisfied. The distinction is perhaps best appreciated if we consider another example, forgetting about reference for the moment. Suppose I encounter a colleague whose office is next to mine and inquire, "Heard from Jim lately?". I have two distinct goals in mind. One is to ask her whether she has heard from her brother lately, rather than to ask how her dogs are or how her work is going. Let us call this my expression-specific goal. It is the relatively narrow response of which I spoke earlier. My other goal, involving the broader purpose or intended direction of the exchange, is to initiate a conversation to while away some time, avoiding having to think about how to improve this part of this paper. Call this my conversational goal. (One could have a number of these operating at different levels; consider the none too clever opening line "Come here often?".) Now it seems clear that these are quite distinct goals, and that I have distinct intentions to accomplish them. Either goal, as well as either intention, could exist without the other. My expression-specific intention involves, as the term suggests, what I intend to accomplish by uttering this expression rather than some other, viz. to inquire whether my colleague has heard from her brother lately rather than how her pets are or what shape her book is in. My conversational intention involves the course of events that I intend to bring about subsequent to this inquiry. (The terminology should not be taken to suggest that the content of the expression "Heard from Jim lately?" is irrelevant to my conversational intention. It is such as to be one among several ways of initiating a pleasant little chat, with quite distinct advantages over say "You know, I've always thought that you're the dumbest philosopher in the midwest".) Let us now return to reference, and, eventually, Grenada. In the previous example, I have an expression-specific intention to direct my colleague's attention to her brother by uttering "Jim", and so on. I may also have a somewhat nasty intention to direct her attention, to allude, to his (purely imaginary) tendency to fail to contact her for extended periods of time. Any such intention, however, would be conversational rather than expression-specific. And, to return to reference, there is</page><page sequence="13">SPEAKER REFERENCE 211 no expression-specific intention with which "to protect the lives of American citizens abroad" is uttered which is an intention to direct H's attention to the Grenada invasion (or to update the example, the raid on Libya). Rather, there is a conversational intention that H be put in mind of the Grenada invasion or the raid on Libya. Such military actions may be alluded to - and indeed we now have the basis for an explanation of this fact in the conversational intentions of the utterer. This might seem more persuasive if a clearer account of the differ- ence between expression-specific and conversational intentions can be given. There seem to be two complementary aspects which underlie this distinction. One is that expression-specific intentions, but not conversa- tional intentions, are such that they could be satisfied by the hearer just by an understanding of the expression uttered and the context of utterance. (The latter is required in order to account for the hearer's understanding of indexical expressions such as "he", "tomorrow", "this". etc.) This cannot be done in the Grenada example: some understanding of recent political events and for that matter political jingoism is required if the hearer is to catch the allusion to some recent military adventure. The second aspect of the distinction is that with conversa- tional but not expression-specific intentions, the hearer must to satisfy the intention work out through some pattern of inference the object or message that is intended. Such an inference - not necessarily, obviously, a consciously carried out step by step deductive or inductive argument - is required to get from the utterance of "We must always remember that we have a duty to resist terrorism and also to protect the lives of American citizens abroad" to the latest bit of military bravado. But such is not required to get to what we might briefly call the content of the uttered sentence. The repair required to handle the objection is then simply that the intentions to which (R) appeals must be expression-specific rather than conversational intentions. I think this suffices to show that Donnellan's objection is not decisive.24 There is another objection to consider however, due to Jonn L. Pollock. Suppose that you and I both know a rather spacy teenager named Maria, who goes around singing a certain song to herself all the time. We are sitting in a restaurant and I see Maria walk in. In order to direct your attention to her in a somewhat humorous way, I might softly</page><page sequence="14">212 ROD BERTOLET sing the first line of her song. If the song is sufficiently characteristic of Maria, my singing it may well be sufficient to make you realize that I am trying to call your attention to her presence by singing it. In this case I intend to direct your attention to Maria, I intend that you recognize that I do, and I intend that your attention be directed to Maria at least partly on the basis of your recognition that this is what I am trying to do. It seems as though (R)'s conditions are satisfied, but it seems clear that I am not referring to Maria by singing the song. It seems to me that the previously introduced distinction can be appealed to to deflect the force of this example. I have no expression- specific intention to direct your attention to Maria. While I do have an intention to direct your attention to Maria, and so on, this is rather a conversational intention. (It is true that the content of the first line of the song is relevant to your unraveling of what I'm up to, but as we have seen, this does not preclude my intentions from being conversa- tional rather than expression-specific. Note also that the example will work out the same way if we imagine Maria's song to be a series of nonsense syllables, so that its first line has no "content".) So (R)'s conditions, contrary to appearances, are not satisfied after all, and this objection fails. VI I wish to turn now to a series of examples purporting to show that (R)'s conditions are not necessary. These seem to me in some ways more serious than the previous set of objections, as they call into question the connection (R) postulates between referring and the having of commu- nicative intentions. One such involves an apparent existential claim. One of my col- leagues, in teaching critical thinking, is wont to use as an example "One of my dogs is stupid". If it is correct to say that in doing so she refers to her distinctly unbright German shepherd Jenny, (R)'s conditions aren't necessary, since she does not intend to direct her class's attention to that particular dog. But it seems to me that here, and with existential generalizations generally, there is no singular reference made. It may be that there is some sense in which the example sentence is about Jenny, though I am dubious of even this. One thing that might prompt one to say that a reference is made is the fact that my colleague "has Jenny in</page><page sequence="15">SPEAKER REFERENCE 213 mind" when she gives the example. But this vaguely expressed fact is surely not enough to secure reference to Jenny; consider again the phenomenon of allusion discussed in the previous section. Another temptation involves the fact that Jenny is the canine making the sentence true - but this does not entail that the canine serving this function is referred to in the utterance of the existentially quantified sentence. There is also the "arch" use of an existentially quantified sentence. One might at a department meeting utter "Someone has been in the Scotch, I fear" in order that one's hearer take note that Jones is once again drunk in mid-afternoon but without actually referring to Jones. It is plausible to suppose that one who does so intends the hearer's attention to be directed to Jones, and so forth, but I would contend that this is a conversational rather than an expression-specific intention. There is, however, a way of embellishing examples that philosophers have often contended are to be construed as existential claims so that it seems less implausible to claim that a reference is made, and this is related to some interesting observations concerning indefinite descrip- tions that have been made by Charles Chastain.25 If my colleague utters "One of my dogs is stupid - she is the older of the two, the one that tries to uproot trees . . ." she will have referred to Jenny. (Note that this does not require that we say a reference is made prior to the utterance of "she", however.) Similarly, as Chastain has observed, one may make a reference by uttering "A man was sitting underneath a tree eating peanuts. A squirrel came by, and the man fed it some peanuts". (Again, this does not entail that a reference is made prior to the utterance of "the man" and "it".) There are quite a number of difficult and important issues raised by Chastain's paper that I cannot even begin to address here; I shall limit myself to potential consequences for (R). Chastain holds that some tokens of indefinite descriptions are singular terms, ones to which subsequent terms are anaphorically linked.26 Let us examine some of the arguments which purport to show this. Supposing that he has encountered the following in his morning paper Houston, Texas, March 10 (UPI) - Dr. Michael DeBakey stated at a press conference today that an artificial heart could be developed within five years. The famed Baylor University surgeon said that such a development would make heart transplants unnecessary.</page><page sequence="16">214 ROD BERTOLET Chastain further supposes that he reports this by saying D8 #A doctor in Texas claims that artificial hearts will be developed within five years. # 27: Chastain continues ... is 'a doctor' in that token of D8 a singular term? Is it possible to trace a referential connection between that expression and a particular person, such that what I said is true if and only if that person claimed that artificial hearts will be developed within five years? Or am I merely asserting that the class of Texas doctors claiming that artificial hearts will be developed within five years is non-empty, as the existential quantification reading of D8 would have it? In that case what I said would be true even if the news report about DeBakey were wholly erroneous and DeBakey had never made any such claim but some other doctor in Texas had, say in a private conversation, unknown to the reporter who wrote the story. Which reading is the correct one in this case? Imagine how the conversation might continue: you ask 'Who said that?' and I answer 'Dr. Michael DeBakey.' Or perhaps: you say 'I can't quite believe that' and I say 'Well, it was DeBakey who said it and he ought to know. He's a famous surgeon.' Or perhaps: you say 'what's his name?' and I say 'Michael DeBakey.' Such continuations would be unintelligible on the existential quantification reading, for they presuppose that one and only one person is being said to have claimed that artificial hearts will be developed within five years; they presuppose that there is a unique referent of 'a doctor' whose name can be requested by asking 'Who?' or 'What's his name?' and can be identified by saying 'Michael DeBakey'.28 There are perhaps two different arguments against the existential reading of D8 in this passage, though not much stress is placed on the first. Neither is decisive. It is, first, by no means plainly wrong to say that what the speaker says is true even if DeBakey said no such thing, but some other unheralded Texas doctor did. I would grant that the speaker doesn't know that a doctor in Texas said that - note the parallel with Gettier's famous examples - but I'm also inclined to say that though the speaker gets no credit for the fact, it is a fact that what he says is true. So it is not at all clear that there is any difficulty with this consequence of the existential quantification reading. The second argument, in the second half of the passage quoted, relies on a premise which I think is simply not true. There need be no presupposition of the sort Chastain notes for the questions he intro- duces to be intelligible. Even if I were to make explicit the quantifica- tional reading by uttering "There is at least one thing, and at most one thing, that is a doctor in Kentucky that has put artificial hearts in human beings", a hearer might quite intelligibly respond "And who</page><page sequence="17">SPEAKER REFERENCE 215 might that be?" or "Oh yeah, the surgeon who moved from Utah to the private hospital in Kentucky - what was his name?" What such questions presuppose is simply that there is a unique individual of whom it is true that he implanted an artificial heart in a human. While a pedant might query "Who is the individual satisfying the open sentence 'x is a doctor in Kentucky who has put artificial hearts in humans and (y) (y is a doctor in Kentucky who has put artificial hearts in humans - y = x)'?", a more colloquial way to pose the question is just "Yeah? Who's that?". The intelligibility of the continuations Chastain notes does not hinge on the presupposition of a referent for "a doctor", where this is construed as a singular term.29 This doesn't settle the question of whether a reference is made, however; as Donnellan notes whether this is so is a question separate from whether indefinite descriptions are themselves singular terms. I'm not sure whether there is or not. As Donnellan cautiously puts it, a sentence containing an indefinite description in subject position which initiates a discourse of this sort "in some sense ... introduces a particular person .. ."; he agrees with Chastain that the truth value of what it expresses depends upon the properties of a particular man, and that the existential reading is therefore erroneous.30 I have already questioned the latter two conclusions. While it seems reasonable to say that a particular person is in some sense introduced, it is not especially clear in what sense this is so. If there is actually a reference here, can (R) account for it? I think so. If there is what we might call a referential rather than an existential interpretation intended, we may say that it is because there is a particular man to whom the hearer's attention is intended to be directed, and so on.31 Both Chastain and Donnellan might be dubious of this claim, but I think we shall see that their reasons are not compelling. Though Chastain does not specifically address the sort of view under discussion here, some of his remarks might be thought to tell against it. Criticizing an argument of Quine's designed to show that "a lion" is not a singular term because "I saw a lion" is not "presumed to refer to some one lion, distinguished from its fellows for speaker and hearer by previous sentences or attendant circumstances .. .", Chastain claims that a possibility Quine overlooks is "that 'a lion' refers to some one lion which is not distinguished from its fellows for the hearer by</page><page sequence="18">216 ROD BERTOLET previous attendant circumstances, but which is distinguished from them for the speaker".32 In a similar vein, Donnellan notes that ... in many cases we cannot suppose that the speaker believes or intends the descrip- tion plus any background assumptions to pick out something uniquely. Our initial examples show this. (9) [A man came to the office today. He tried to sell me an encyclopedia.], (9a) [A man came to the office today. The man tried to sell me an encyclopedia.], or (9b) [A man came to the office today. The man who came to the office today tried to sell me an encyclopedia.] might naturally begin an anecdote about an event at one's office told to friends who know little or nothing about what goes on there. Even if one used the fully expanded description, as in (9b), ..., the speaker is surely not committed to, nor does he intend to suggest that just one man came to the office that day. Nor would he suppose that there are background assumptions shared by the audience that would allow them to recognize a particular man. There is a particular man presumably about which the speaker is talking, but that person is not identified by the descriptions used plus the circumstances of utterance.33 This argument is directed against the "initially attractive idea" that it is not merely the indefinite description but rather the whole initial sentence in the discourse that "serves, if everything goes right, to identify an individual by providing a unique description".34 I think Donnellan's argument and Chastain's point provide yet another reason to be dubious of the claim that whenever a speaker refers, he intends that the hearer identify the referent, in any rich sense of "identify". It serves to support Donnellan's claim that the speaker need not expect or intend his audience to recognize anyone as the subject of the story, in a similarly rich sense of "recognize".35 But it is another matter whether the speaker intends to direct the hearer's attention to a particular man, and it is not so clear that it is unreasonable to suppose that this is so. Any reluctance one has on this score is likely traceable to the thought that one cannot have one's attention directed to, think about, etc. someone or something without knowing who or what that some- one/something is, and that one who only knows that this fellow is some guy who showed up at my office lacks such knowledge. But this is not really so plausible a thought. I open my university telephone directory and encounter a listing for Gyanendra Kuman Gupta, about whom I know precious little. There are construals of "recognize" on which I cannot recognize Gupta. But I know enough to wonder whether Gupta is male or female, what his or her nationality is, whether he or she is related to Anil Gupta, whether he or she would mind having his or her name used in this illustration, and so on. All these wonderings, and my</page><page sequence="19">SPEAKER REFERENCE 217 thoughts, etc. are about Gupta (the person, not the name). It just doesn't take much to know who a person is, for the purpose of referring to that person.36 Correlatively, to expect or intend that a hearer's attention be directed to someone - not that he identify or "recognize" that person - need not be to expect or intend a great deal. That the contrary is so widely held may be, as someone once said, a tribute to the education of philosophers. VII A somewhat different challenge to the necessity of (R)'s conditions, also drawn from Donnellan's writings, concerns a name (actually, a pseudonym) rather than any sort of description. Donnellan supposes, counterfactually, that Woodward and Bernstein have included the following in their account of the Watergate scandal: We now had a telephone call from a man high in the inner circle. He asked us to meet him at a certain suburban garage where he would give us confirmation of some of our conjectures. We later decided to give the man the code name "Deep Throat".37 Donnellan notes that "Woodward and Bernstein never, of course, reveal to their readers who this high official is, and while some have tried to guess his identity and some may be certain of it, the authors did not intend that there should be such recognition". Now I think there is no doubt that there is here a counterexample to Stine's (A), so that you should reject her analysis on the basis of this example even if you weren't impressed by what I said against it earlier. In later writing, e.g. "Deep Throat told us to pressure x about the CREEP slush fund", Woodward and Bernstein would not in the circumstances Donnellan imagines have had the conflicting intentions of intending that their readers identify a and intending to conceal from their readers Deep Throat's identity. (They would not in other words have wanted their readers to recognize and not recognize that a = Deep Throat.) I am not however persuaded that Donnellan's example harbors a counterexample to (R). What needs to be established is that clause (2) of (R) fails, that although Woodward and Bernstein refer to Deep Throat they do not intend to direct their readers' attention to Deep Throat. Now there is no doubt that the lack of clarity in the notion of</page><page sequence="20">218 ROD BERTOLET intending to direct someone's attention to something doesn't help one's confidence in what to say about the example, but I do not see why Woodward and Bernstein should not be said to have this intention. Indeed I am not at all sure how to describe the example if we do not assume that they have some such intention. For what would the communicative point of their remark be if not to direct our attention to ($ identify!) Deep Throat, so that we may be informed, come to know, that it was he who was suggesting trying to get information on the CREEP slush fund by pressuring the pusillanimous x? I think that one's inclination to reject (2) of (R) traces to a tendency to read "D-intends" as "intends that H identify", but that one can, by taking care to distinguish these, reasonably contend that (2) is not shown to fail by the example.38 VIII The possibility, or alleged possibility, of intentional misdirection raises the specter of a different kind of counterexample. Suppose that I know that Deep Throat is John Dean, but don't want you to recognize this I prefer that you think that Deep Throat is Al Haig. Can I, in uttering "Deep Throat then told us to check with the CREEP treasurer", intend that your attention be directed away from Dean and toward Haig, so that although I refer to Dean I do not intend to direct your attention (etc.) to him? If so, (R)'s conditions are not necessary. But I do not see that this is really possible. We need to begin with a fuller story as to how such purported misdirection might be attempted. One initially promising strategy involves reliance on certain non- linguistic cues. If there is in view a newspaper with a photograph of Haig, for example, I might roll my eyes towards it when I utter "'Deep Throat is . . .". Even supposing that I here refer to Dean, it is not the case that (R)'s conditions are satisfied, where x is Haig: the mechanism by which the intention is to be effected is wrong. For it is not by uttering "Deep Throat", but rather by my eye-rolling, that I intend (if I do) that your attention be directed to Haig. There are other ways to fill out the example; one might be to exploit false beliefs the hearer has. Suppose I know that you mistakenly believe Haig is Deep Throat, and utter "Deep Throat .. .", intending, partly on the basis of your false</page><page sequence="21">SPEAKER REFERENCE 219 belief, but also partly on the basis of what I utter, that your attention be directed towards Haig. This will be a problem for (R) only if it is intuitively correct to say that I refer to Dean, and I do not find it at all clear that this is correct. As it is difficult to back up such a judgment with an argument, I shall attempt to deflect what seems to me the main reason one might have for thinking otherwise. That reason is that the semantic referent of "Deep Throat" ought to be Dean. But here as elsewhere, this does not show that Dean is in fact referred to. Consider a case of misdescription. Knowing that you take the person at the end of the bar to be female, I utter "The woman at the end of the bar is 0", intending that your attention be directed to the female impersonator at the end of the bar. Let there also be, for the sake of symmetry, a woman disguised as a man at the end of the bar. To whom do I refer, the man in the dress or the woman? By my intuitions, the man, despite the fact that the other person would be the semantic referent of the term "the woman at the end of the bar". I think the case with "Deep Throat", Dean and Haig is similar - though the fact that the semantic referent of "Deep Throat" would (or "ought to" be) Dean may incline one to say that Dean is referred to, this doesn't show that Dean is referred to, and I don't think he is. Setting aside the semantic properties of "Deep Throat", we would have to maintain that I intend to refer to Dean, but D-intend Haig, and act in accordance with this D-intention. But at this point, it is not clear that there is anything left to the notion of intending to refer to Dean.39 There is, moreover, an explanation of why this should be which is available from the theoretical perspective I have endorsed, involving the possibility of rationally intending what (R) requires. To return to the misdescription case, one reason the female impersonator and not the actual woman figures in my intentions is that it would not be rational for me to intend that your attention be directed to the woman by uttering "the woman at the end of the bar", simply because she doesn't look like a woman. Here as elsewhere, what I may rationally intend is in part a function of what it is rational for me to expect to achieve, and given the appearance of the people at the bar, the only person I can reasonably expect that your attention will be directed to by my utterance of "the woman at the bar" is the unconventionally attired man. This is indeed why I choose to misdescribe that person as a</page><page sequence="22">220 ROD BERTOLET woman in order to convey to you who it is that I refer to. And if I think that you believe that Deep Throat is Haig, I cannot rationally intend that your attention be directed to Dean by uttering "Deep Throat is .."; I would first need to disabuse you of your mistaken belief. It is a nice feature of the view I have presented that if I am correct in thinking that Dean is not referred to, there is a simple explanation as to why this is so. I think, then, that it is possible in various ways for me to utter "Deep Throat . . ." intending that you misidentify Deep Throat as Haig, but I don't think that in doing so I can refer to Dean. So I don't find that such examples constitute a refutation of (R). Ix Cases in which it seems that there is more than one person involved in the speaker's intentions provide yet another difficulty. A modification of a well-known example of Linsky's suggested by Donnellan will serve to make the point. We may suppose that someone sees a man across the room wiping the fevered brow of a woman and, taking the man to be her husband, utter "Aha! Her husband is being kind to her again." The speaker believes that Jones is the woman's husband, and relying on the audience's knowing this, he intends to refer to Jones by uttering "her husband". He also intends to refer to the man across the room who, as luck (or perhaps the ingenuity of philosophers) would have it is neither Jones nor the woman's husband. So who is referred to - Jones or the man across the room? It seems to follow from (R) that both are referred to. While intuitions about this sort of case are varied and uncertain, it is certainly not clear that this result is satisfactory. My own inclination is to say (on certain assumptions about the example) that the man across the room but not Jones is referred to, and to invoke a distinction which allows us to amend (R) to achieve this result. The distinction, due to Castanieda, is between primary and derivative intentions.40 An intention is derivative if one has it only because of other intentions one has, i.e. if one's having other intentions explains one's having it, but not vice versa: otherwise it is primary. In the example, presumably the speaker intends to refer to Jones only because he intends to refer to the solicitous man across the room, and believes that man to be the woman's husband, hence Jones. The amendment to</page><page sequence="23">SPEAKER REFERENCE 221 (R) is to stipulate that if there are multiple intentions of the sort involved in the example, it is the primary intention that counts. So amended, (R) entails (on the factual assumptions indicated) that the man across the room is referred to, while Jones is not.4' I think, incidentally, that appreciating the role of the distinction between primary and derivative intentions helps to explain why intuition is both variable and uncertain with respect to examples of this sort. Since there are two distinct people who are the objects of the speaker's intentions, we tend to vacillate between them in trying to determine who the referent is (or resort to the to me rather unwelcome claim that there are actually two referents). Once we note that one of the people is involved only because those intentions are derivative from others, we have a principled reason to select the nonderivative intention, and the object of that intention, as the one on which our theory should focus. x At the end of section IV, discussion of soliloquy was postponed. I shall now take up that issue, and also make a final remark about the initial Deep Throat case examined in Section VII. It is a familiar complaint concerning Grice's theory of meaning that it seems to have no applica- tion to diary entries, soliloquy, and so forth. I think it legitimate to set such cases to the side as somehow derivative or secondary, but not everyone is so inclined. Those not so inclined might consider the following, also familiar from Grice.42 Letting 0 range over properties of persons such as being an English speaker, being someone who nosily peruses the diaries of others, etc., we may rewrite the clauses of (R) so that (to limit our attention to (2)) there will be some property 0 selected by the utterer which is such that (2') x is such that U intends that anyone with 0 will have his attention directed to it and so on. Now suppose that I am wrong about Donnellan's Deep Throat example, and that while Deep Throat is referred to, U has no intention to direct the hearer's attention to Deep Throat. An extension of the reformulation just discussed will suffice to overcome this problem, if it is a problem. To manage the Deep Throat example, we</page><page sequence="24">222 ROD BERTOLET need only note that this is a non-standard case involving deception, and modify (2') to (2 ) x is such that U intends that anyone with 0 whom U is not trying to deceive will have his attention directed to it. I am not persuaded that this maneuver is motivated, but I suggest that if it is motivated it is also successful. CONCLUDING REMARKS There are a number of issues left unresolved by the foregoing, and some of the replies offered against putative counterexamples may not be wholly satisfying to some philosophers. Those that bother me most are the ones mentioned in the previous section. Some of the difficulty resides in the degree of clarity surrounding the notion of intending to direct someone's attention to something, and I do not see my way clear to enhancing this at the moment. I confess that I do not find it impossible that the truth is that some cases of reference are simply not linked to intended communication in the way my theory demands. I am not persuaded of this, but if it is correct the theory offered, ignoring the refinements of Section X, might best be viewed as an account of those cases of reference in which communication is intended, and it is surely worth having an account of this. Despite these reservations, I hope to have made it plausible, if not clearly and unassailably correct, to claim that a theory of speaker reference based on the intentions of the speaker is tenable, and worthy of further investigation.43 NOTES Saul A. Kripke, 'Speaker's Reference and Semantic Reference', in Contemporary Perspectives in the Philosophy of Language, ed. P. French, T. Uehling, and H. Wettstein (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1979), p. 14. 2 Keith S. Donnellan, 'Reference and Definite Descriptions', in Readings in the Philosophy of Language, ed. J. Rosenberg and C. Travis (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice- Hall, 1971), pp. 195-211. (As Donnellan points out, the point had previously been made by Linsky; I have heard John Searle maintain that a number of others had also made it.) There is by the way no need for anyone to have any mistaken beliefs, as Donnellan shows with the final example of Section IV of his paper. The obvious way in which this might occur is if one had wandered into an Aa meeting where no martinis were being consumed. But I think it also holds when there are numerous people drinking martinis, none of whom is referred to by the speaker.</page><page sequence="25">SPEAKER REFERENCE 223 4 This is pretty much the orthodox view. For a dissent, see A. P. Martinich, 'Referring', Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 40(1979), 157-72. I Donnellan, 'Speaking of Nothing', Philosophical Review 83 (1974), 16. It is worth noting that Donnellan is using "predicate" and its relatives in the sense they have in such expressions as "predicate calculus", and in the broad sense in which something can be predicated in questions, commands, and so on. I am not entirely sure that this sense of "predicate" is the one most useful in linguistic, as opposed to logical, theory, but if so it obviates the criticism that references made via expressions occurring in predicates, e.g. the reference to Bill in "Tom hit Bill", cannot be analyzed in terms of an intention to predicate something of Bill. In the sense Donnellan intends, though not I think in another sense, the same thing is predicated of both parties in "Tom hit Bill" and "Bill was hit by Tom". I am grateful to Donnellan for correcting a misunderstanding of mine on this point. Perhaps I should note that there is a slightly different formulation Donnellan offers in "Speaker Reference, Descriptions, and Anaphora", in Contem- porary Perspectives in the Philosophy of Language, pp. 28-44. The suggestion offered there, that speaker's reference be tied to an intention concerning the truth conditions of one's utterance (p. 38), does not seem to differ substantially from the one quoted, and at any rate the same objections will apply to it. (See Note 31 for an additional difficulty.) 6 Of course it isn't the statement of a theory, but rather the specification of two conditions jointly sufficient for reference. Should this provoke you to think that my comments merely glance off Donnellan's, think of them as a contribution to the search for something that is the statement of a theory. 7 See H. P. Grice, 'Utterer's Meaning and Intentions', Philosophical Review 78 (1969), 147-77. 8 Gail C. Stine, 'Meaning Other Than What We Say and Referring', Philosophical Studies 33 (1978), 323. (If you're not a Grice aficionado you may well wonder about the point of some of the clauses in this analysis; I will put off discussion of the motivation for this sort of account until Section III.) ' It may be worth pointing out that I do not mean to suggest that the notion of -intending to direct someone's attention to something is clearer or better understood than ideas such as intending to predicate. Its virtue is that it is a more basic cognitive state than intending to predicate. I" I would like to be more confident that this is fair to Stine; her remarks in section VI of her paper may suggest it is not, though I find it very hard to be sure just what she had in mind. It may be that the view I set out is closer to what she had in mind than my remarks would indicate, though differences in our approaches would remain. On the other hand she does gloss identifying as picking out an individual, and most of what she says certainly seems to favor the view that I argue to be too strong. ' This is not to deny that there could be some descriptions, perhaps even individu- ating descriptions, that the child could attach to the present (e.g., some expansion of "the thing in the box that jerk is teasing me with"). It is to deny that the child might, when confronted with a pile of objects, identify - pick out - the one which is the present. The child's predicament is similar to that of my students, who could not identify Frege in a pile of philosophers - not even if they all came with annotated curriculum vitae. 12 The point of this is to allow the theory to handle the sort of case discussed earlier, in which Donnellan is referred to via the sentence fragment "Donnellan". 13 I am assuming that the proper treatment of referential uses of definite descriptions does not involve claiming that they denote the things they are used to refer to. For a defense of this approach see 'The Semantic Significance of Donnellan's Distinction', Philosophical Studies 37 (1980), 281-88, and 'Donnellan's Distinctions', Australasian Journal of Philosophy 64:4 (1986), pp. 477-87.</page><page sequence="26">224 ROD BERTOLET 14 I do not mean to assume that reasons aren't causes. If they are the point is that the cause or causal chain is not one of the "appropriate" sort. 15 Those who think that there are nonexistent objects to which we refer will want to relax "(3x)" into a quantifier hospitable to such objects. I have not done this because I do not believe that the "data" alleged to support this view forces it upon us. This is sort of a long story, to be found in 'Reference, Fiction, and Fictions', Synthese 60 (1984), 413-37, 'Inferences, Names, and Fictions', Synthese 58 (1984), 203-18, and 'On a Fictional Ellipsis', Erkenntnis 21 (1984), 189-94. 16 There are two reasons for this. One is that if there is some proposition U intends to convey in the total speech act, it is not merely by referring that this is intended. The other is that there are cases, such as the answer "Donnellan" noted earlier, where there is apparently no proposition asserted (though there is, perhaps, one U intends the audience to come to believe). '7 In this I follow Kent Bach, 'De Re Belief and Methodological Solipsism', in Thought and Object, ed. Andrew Woodfipld (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982), pp. 121-51. 18 See 'Demonstratives and Intentions', Philosophical Studies 38 (1980), 75-78. This paper is criticized by M. J. More in 'Demonstratives and Intentions Again', Philo- sophical Studies 41 (1981), 193-96, by John L. Biro in 'Intentions, Demonstration, and Reference', Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 63 (1982), 35-41, and by Howard Wettstein in 'How to Bridge the Gap between Meaning and Reference', Synthese 58 (1984), 63-84. I reply to all this in 'Referring, Demonstrating, and Intending', forthcoming in Philosophy Research Archives. 1 The subsequent examples are taken from Grice's 'Utterer's Meaning and Intentions'. 20 It should be noted that one of Schiffer's examples involves the raucous singing of "Tipperary", another a performance of "Moon over Miami", either of which you might mistakenly think to be a linguistic act (Stephen Schiffer, Meaning (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1972), pp. 18 and 22). If you're not prepared to share my lack of enthusiasm for singing as a speech act, you might note that there is nothing essentially linguistic about these examples. They could just as easily involve making some horrible noise without the use of one's vocal cords. 21 Grice, 'Utterer's Meaning', p. 151. 22 Grice, 'Utterer's Meaning', p. 154. 23 Grice, 'Utterer's Meaning', p. 155. 24 Donnellan's formulation avoids the problem altogether, since it is not plausible to suppose that Reagan intends to predicate anything of the Grenada invasion when he utters the sentence (or any of its constituent parts). Notice though that there is something that Reagan might well intend that his audience believe about that invasion, that it was a stunning success, or preserved the lives of allegedly endangered medical students, etc. The importance of this is that it is a case on which I think Donnellan and I would agree that even though this is intended to be believed, it is not predicated. Donnellan once at least was tempted to respond to the example of my utterance of "Donnellan" given in Section II by claiming that there is a predication in the offing, to be recovered by the hearer from the context of the utterance. But so too in this example, and it is difficult to see how one could distinguish these cases so there is a predication, if only in the offing, in the "Donnellan" example but not in the Reagan example. 25 Charles Chastain, 'Reference and Context', in Language, Mind, and Knowledge, ed. Keith Gunderson (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1975), pp. 194-269. 26 Chastain, 'Reference', pp. 204-5. An anaphoric chain is "a sequence of singular expressions occurring in a context, such that if one of them refers to something then all the others also refer to it". "Context" is a technical term explained in section 1 of Chastain's essay; it will do here to view it as the bit of discourse in which the description occurs.</page><page sequence="27">SPEAKER REFERENCE 225 27 No need to learn to pronounce " # "; the " # "'s mark discourse boundaries and are not part of the utterance. "D8" is of course just a label. 28 Chastain, 'Reference', pp. 212-13. 29 Similar objections will I think defuse the claim that the speaker would make it clear that he intends "a doctor" to be taken as a singular term if he uttered sentences such as "A doctor in Texas - DeBakey, the heart surgeon - claims that artificial hearts will be developed within five years" (see Chastain, 'Reference', p. 213). 30 Donnellan, 'Speaker Reference', p. 43. 31 And I would claim that when the speaker has no such intentions the proper understanding of what he says is existential. There may be a point against Donnellan's truth-conditional analysis in "Speaker Reference" (see Note 5) in this. There may well be someone who the speaker intends to figure in the truth conditions of an existentially quantified sentence, and it would appear to follow from Donnellan's view that this person is then referred to. But this seems neither true nor what Donnellan might be expected to want to say. Incidentally, while I make no attempt here to assess the main point of Donnellan's paper, which is that speaker reference "cannot be divorced from" semantic reference, I might note that this is a fairly loose formulation. I agree with Kripke's claim in 'Speaker's Reference' (p. 26) that speaker reference is not itself a semantic notion, though, like lots of other non-semantic things, it can be relevant to semantics. See also 'The Semantic Significance of Donnellan's Distinction'. 32 Chastain, 'Reference', p. 208. 33 Donnellan, 'Speaker Reference', p. 37. 3 Donnellan, 'Speaker Reference', p. 36 (emphasis added). 35 Donnellan, 'Speaker Reference', p. 38. 36 I have adapted this example from one given by Dennis W. Stampe in 'Pragmatics and Causal Theoretic Aspects of Semantics', in Possibilities and Limitations of Pragmatics, ed. H. Parret, M. Sbisa and J. Verscheueren (The Hague: John Benjamins B. V., 1979), pp. 683-712. His own conclusions are more cautious than mine. Also, consider again, in this context, the Christmas present example in Section III. 37 Donnellan, 'Speaker Reference', p. 38. 38 If you find this obviously mistaken, you may look forward to some mollifying remarks in Section X. 39 I owe the point of the final two sentences to John Biro. 40 See Hector-Neri Castafieda, 'Intentions and the Structure of Intending', Journal of Philosophy 68 (1971), 459. I owe my awareness of the usefulness of this notion in this context to Michael McKinsey's 'Names and Intentionality', Philosophical Review 87 (1978), p. 177, and a reminder from Howard Wettstein. I' One could vary the example to alter the direction of explanation; it might be that the speaker intends to make a remark about Jones, and, just noticing the person he mistakes for Jones across the room, then comes to form the intention to refer to the man across the room. This may appear to yield the wrong result. (This objection is also due to Pollock.) Intuitively, if I look around the room, see someone I mistakenly take to be Jones, and while pointing to him say, "that is the man who is going to give the dinner speech tonight", it seems as though I have referred to the man to whom I have pointed. But since my intention to direct your attention to that man is derivative from my intention to direct your attention to Jones, the theory says I referred to Jones. While I grant that this result is (at least) somewhat counterintuitive, I do not think that this forces us to abandon the theory, since I think that we can distinguish the person referred to (Jones) from the person demonstrated (the man I mistook for Jones), and use this distinction in defense of (R). See again 'Demonstratives and Intentions' and 'Referring, Demonstrating, and Intending', op. cit. (It is perhaps also worth mentioning that while some philosophers have firm intuitions about this sort of example, others are</page><page sequence="28">226 ROD BERTOLET unclear as to which person is referred to, and even willing to tolerate the claim that both are referred to.) 42 Grice, 'Utterer's Meaning', pp. 174-75. 43 An earlier, abbreviated, version of this paper was presented to the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association in December of 1983, with Keith Donnellan providing very helpful and stimulating commentary. Portions of versions were pre- sented at Illinois State University and Miami University of Ohio in 1984 and 1985. Dennis Stampe provided much sound advice on its most remote ancestor. I am further indebted to John Biro, John Pollock (notably but not solely for provoking improve- ments in Section V), Lilly Russow, James Stephens, and especially, for tireless devotion to philosophical inquiry, William L.
