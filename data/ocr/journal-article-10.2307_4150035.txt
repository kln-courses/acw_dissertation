Thus the gods enter; thus the season of the gods falls From the shadows down to men, shaking the depths. Friedrich H61derlin, "Brot und Wein" A S one scholar has recently expressed the matter, "Greek tragedy is about nothing if not religion."' It is therefore fitting that the study of gods and rituals has stood at the centre of much recent work on tragedy.2 The present paper seeks to contribute to this enquiry, and to do so from a less familiar perspective, for my main topic will not be the central role of the established Olympian gods in the action of the plays, whether as figures on stage3 or through divination and oracles, but I Fowler (1999) 174; cf. Nestle (1934) 1.117 "Die sch6nste und vielleicht dauerndste Frucht griechischer Religiositdtt ist die Trag6die." 2Cf., e.g., Sommerstein (1989) 6-12, Seaford (1996) 30-52, Krummen (1998) 296-325, Allan (2000) 233-266, Wildberg (2002), Mastronarde (2002). Most recently, Sourvinou-Inwood (2003) offers a detailed treatment of the ritual setting of tragedy and the relationship between religion in tragedy and that of the Athenian polis. Despite its unfortunate neglect of Sophocles' plays, her discussion deals forcefully with both gods and rituals, resisting the scholarly tendency to give more attention to rituals than to the gods (a trend that has continued for the past century in the study of Greek religion in gen- eral, not only in tragedy: cf. Bremmer (1998), who discusses (13) the "nineteenth-century depreciation of ritual [in contrast to modem works]," and asks (24) "Do not the gods and heroes lend Greek religion its specific 'colour,' more than its ritual?").

As a preliminary indication of the impact of the new gods on fifth-century Athenian culture, and as a marker, by contrast, of tragedy's more nuanced approach to the topic, it may be helpful to recall the testimony of Cicero, who reports that novos vero deos et in his colendis nocturnas pervigilationes sic Aristophanes, facetissimus poeta veteris comoediae, vexat, ut apud eum Sabazius et quidam alii dei peregrini iudicati e civitate eiciantur. (Laws 2.37) "Aristophanes, the wittiest poet of Old Comedy, attacks the new gods and the all-night festivals involved in their worship by depict- ing Sabazius and some other foreign gods as brought to trial and banished from the city."6 The production of a play including the trial and explusion of new gods suggests, at the very least, a widely shared public awareness of the "dif- ference" of some gods from others. We shall return to comedy later, but it is useful for now to bear the Cicero citation in mind since it serves to remind us that Athenian religion was in a constant state of change, and that these changes did not please everybody.7 The study of religious innovation in antiquity has long been bedevilled by various aberrant assumptions: for example, that Athenian interest in, or increasing open- ness to, new gods was a sign of "decline,"8 or that because the new 4 Despite the studies listed above (n. 2), little attention has been paid thus far to the lit- erary treatment of the "new gods." 5 Bruns (1894) 20 stated confidently that "mittelbar werden sich aber iiberall, wo G6tter in der Trag6die auftreten, religionsgeschichtliche Folgerungen ziehen lassen." The nature of these conclusions, however, has proved controversial. 6 Kassel-Austin 111.2.296 identify the play as the Seasons, which was probably pro- duced some years before the Birds (414 B.C.): see Dunbar on Birds 873-875. 7 For caution regarding the acceptance of new gods, see in general Rudhardt (1992). 8 Kern (1938) 145-151 described the "Theokrasie" of the late archaic and classical periods as a "Vorbereitung des Synkretismus," but even he regarded the latter with suspi- cion (145): "Synkretismus bezeichnet stets den Verfall einer nationalen Religion: fremde Gottheiten sind eingedrungen und vermengen sich mit den nationalen." Mikalson (1983)</page><page sequence="3">Religious Syncretism: The New Gods of Greek Tragedy 115 cults were, it was thought, particularly popular among women, the lower classes, and slaves, they did not merit serious attention.9 We shall see reason to question these assumptions, and others like them, in the course of our discussion, but it is important to emphasize that the new gods mark no deterioration in Greek religion and that polytheism flour- ished at all levels of society for many centuries beyond the classical period.1' Moreover, as this paper seeks to show, it is essential that we do not take a patronizing attitude towards the new gods, as if the reli- gious emotions that they evoked were any less authentic or powerful than those inspired by the long-established gods of public and private cult. No less than the worship of Apollo, the veneration of Bendis, for example, was a genuine and serious form of religious expression. In a similar vein, we should avoid viewing the new gods as something added willy-nilly to the menu of Greek polytheism; nor, in the specifi- cally Athenian context which will be the focus of our enquiry, will it suffice to explain away new Attic cults as a reaction to the pressures of the Peloponnesian War, as if the gods the Athenians had were not work- ing and they quickly decided to call in some new ones.II Resist the idea though one may, the study of Greek religion of any period, and especially Athenian religion of the fifth century B.C., means the analysis of a ritual and cultic complex that is continuously, and in various ways, syncretistic, that is, a system which is predicated upon, and pervaded by, influences from "foreign," or non-established, reli- gious groups and practices. For this reason, before we get to grips with the new gods as they are represented in Greek literature, let us consider, first, what syncretism is; secondly, how fundamental it is to Greek reli- gion; and thirdly, what we mean in a Greek context by the phrase "new gods." 110-111 notes the scholarly tendency to detect "various 'symptoms' of the degeneracy of popular religion in the fourth century," a decline caused by "the introduction of orgiastic foreign cults of Bendis, Sabazius, Attis, Adonis, and others." 9 For women as especially prone to ecstatic worship, cf., e.g., Nilsson (1940) 91-95, concluding (95) "On the whole, women are more emotional than men, a fact which is very apparent in Greek religion." "o See Lane Fox (1986) 64-101. I Even with Bendis (discussed below), widely regarded as the likeliest case of politi- cal motivation for a new cult (cf. Nilsson [1960]), the evidence is far from conclusive, and it is simplistic to see politics as the be all and end all of her worship by Athenians (let alone Thracians resident in Athens): cf. n. 106 below.</page><page sequence="4">116 William Allan I. SYNCRETISM The term syncretism is generally taken to refer to two distinct, but related, types of religious change.12 The first kind, so-called "contact syncretism," refers broadly to the appropriation of one people's gods by another or their reinterpretation in the other's terms. The great debt of the Greek pantheon to Near Eastern religion and myth is a familiar example of the former kind of fusion, to which we shall return in a moment. The latter, the equation of other people's gods with one's own, is perhaps the most obvious way to make sense of an alien religion,'3 and it is accordingly practised from the very beginning of the Greek ethnographic tradition.14 Not surprisingly, Herodotus furnishes us with the fullest and most wide-ranging examples, particularly in his treat- ment of Egyptian religion, where he equates Dionysus with Osiris, Apollo with Horus (2.144.2), Artemis with Bubastis, Demeter with Isis (2.59, 2.156.5), and so on.15 As Walter Burkert has shown, Herodotus' presentation of foreign religions reveals much of value about Greek religion itself.16 So too, I would argue, does the presentation of "new gods" in Attic tragedy. The second type, known as "internal syn- cretism," involves the transfer of powers, characteristics, and divine epi- thets within a specific religious domain.17 In tragedy, therefore, where we are dealing with the conflation of new gods with the established divine identities of the Olympians, it is this second type of syncretism 12 For the terms "contact/fusion" and "internal/assimilation," see, e.g., Le6vque (1973b). 13 Cf., e.g., Hdt. 4.59.1-2 on the gods of the Scythians and their Greek equivalents; Gould (1994) 103. 14 In their encounters with foreign gods the Romans followed similar patterns of assim- ilation: cf., e.g., Caesar BG 6.7, Tac. Germ. 43.3. 15 A character in Sophocles' Andromeda equates the Carthaginian god Baal with the Greek Kronos as the recipient of human sacrifice (fr. 126 Radt). The Chorus of IT address Artemis as "Dictynna of the mountains" (AcrKuvv' oi'pela [127]), an originally Cretan goddess, emphasizing (for an Athenian audience) the remoteness of the Taurian Artemis; at Hipp. 145-146 the Nurse's mention of nokMOrlpov AKcruvvav underlines Phaedra's own "wildness". 16 Burkert (1990); cf. Harrison (2000) 208-222. 17 Less exotic examples (in that they involve established deities): Artemis identified with Hecate (Ag. 140-144, Phoen. 109-110; Aesch. fr. 170 Radt [as moon goddess; cf. Artemis and Selene, (IA) 1570-1571]); as the poison makes its way to Ion, the Athenian Chorus invoke Enodia, a patron of witchcraft, as the daughter of Eleusinian Demeter (Ion 1048).</page><page sequence="5">Religious Syncretism: The New Gods of Greek Tragedy 1 17 that is in evidence, and, as we shall see, such mixing of divine personae builds on the fact that the first stage, or "contact syncretism," has already taken effect in the extra-literary world of the audience; that is, the new gods have already been appropriated by Athenian devotees and are being worshipped quite freely, most of them in polis-sponsored, as well as in private, cult.'8 Finally, one might note that although the term syncretism in the sense of religious "assimilation" or "blending" is a relatively recent coinage, first appearing in theological works of the early nineteenth century (usually, it is worth adding, with a pejorative undertone), the phenomenon was not unknown to the ancient Greeks, one of whose words for it was ouvoetKEiootq.19 However, while the popular etymology that derives "syncretism" from oayKEpaivvwgt ("mix together") is mistaken,20 it does perhaps suggest the fundamental aspects of the process, namely, those of cultural interaction and creative transformation.21 Let us turn briefly to the status of Greek religion as a syncretistic amalgam. As is now widely appreciated, Greek religion did not spring fully formed from the head of Zeus, but developed through a complex process of cultural contact with, and appropriation of, Near Eastern models, whose formative period came at the end of the Dark Ages.22 The growth of the polis in the eighth century B.C., and increas- ing interaction with the Near East, led to many of the distinctive fea- '8 Cybele, Bendis, Pan, and Asclepius were granted public shrines; the rites of Adonis and Sabazius were more informal. 19 Cf. Obbink (1996) 17 n. 2, 280 on oavotcEtCOaEtS as "'accommodations' of divini- ties to other divinities, elements, principles." 20 a6UyiKprttaL6q is attested only once, used to describe the unification of the Cretans, "who, though they often quarrelled and fought with one another, repaired their differ- ences and united when outside enemies attacked; and this they called 'syncretism'" (Plut. Mor 490b). 21 While the term "syncretism" is rarely used in reference to pre-Hellenistic religious phenomena in the Greek world (see, e.g., Nilsson [1967-1974] 2.581-701, who discusses under the heading "Der Synkretismus" only post-classical forms of worship, including Isis cults and Gnosticism), it is hoped that its ultimate relevance for archaic and classical Greece will emerge from our discussion. For a history of the term in scholarship on reli- gion, and remarks on related expressions (synthesis, symbiosis, assimilation, eclecticism), see Berner (2001). Henrichs (1998) 37 observes that the Greeks had no exact words for what we call "religion" and "ritual." Similarly, though "syncretism" itself is not an ancient term (for the study of religion), it is nevertheless useful and picks out an impor- tant feature of Greek polytheism. 22 Cf. Burkert (1992) esp. 41-87 (a distillation of his pioneering work), with 1-8 on his predecessors; also West (1997a) esp. 107-167. Powell (2002) 33-47 highlights some of the consequences of their work on Greece's debt to the Near East.</page><page sequence="6">118 William Allan tures of Greek religion, including temples with cult statues and the roles and provinces of individual gods within divine society.23 Though the break from the Minoan-Mycenean period was not complete, as is shown by the survival of several deities' names from the Linear B tablets,24 there can be little doubt that the religious rituals, images, and terminology taken over from the Near East after the collapse of the Minoan and Mycenean cultures transformed Greek religion, giving it a shape and orientation that was to endure with remarkable resilience until the twilight of the idols, as it were, in the fourth century A.D. How- ever, as we shall see, it would be a mistake to imagine these external forces as limited only to the archaic age, for oriental influences, com- bined with the introduction of new gods and cults, both major and minor,25 from other parts of Greece, ensured that the religious universe of every Greek polis was continuously changing, even if it seems likely that the rate of change, and the complexity of the interactions, were more marked in cosmopolitan communities such as fifth-century Athens. While it may be true that Greek, or (for our purposes) specifically Athenian, religion is profoundly syncretistic (in both appropriating oth- ers' gods and conflating figures within the pantheon), syncretism is not a feature peculiar to Greek culture, nor is it limited to polytheistic reli- gions. Syncretistic religious change is universal, for the simple reason that no human culture is immune to contact with outsiders, and its effects can be seen within monotheistic as well as polytheistic tradi- tions: the God of the Old Testament, for example, was in large measure shaped by the Israelites' interaction with their neighbors and their gods.26 Nevertheless, there are two features of Greek polytheism, quite apart from the plurality of gods, which make the introduction of new divine figures a much easier process than in, say, the Judaeo-Christian tradition: the first is the very nature of the Greek view of divinity, while the second, related to the first, is the insistence on the ultimate 23 For Near Eastern influence on the Greek language, as well as religion and myth, see Szemer6nyi (1974). 24 Iveque (1975) 40-51 discusses the structure of the Minoan-Mycenean pantheon; cf. also Marinatos (1993), Hiigg (1998). Such parallels as exist between Zeus and the Indo-European God of the Daylight Sky, or between the Dioscuri and the AMvins, point to further, though deeply obscure, continuities: cf. Sergent (1995) 323-392 on Indo-Euro- pean religion. 25 For the syncretism of minor figures such as nymphs, see Larson (2001) 125. 26 See Smith (2002) Index s.v. syncretism, Lohfink (1969).</page><page sequence="7">Religious Syncretism: The New Gods of Greek Tragedy 1 19 unknowability of the divine.27 Talk of the nature of the divine perhaps suggests something more grand and metaphysical than is in fact intended here. One might express the point better by saying that the job description, as it were, of a Greek deity was, compared to his or her peers in other cultures, comparatively modest: one need not be unique, all-good, or all-powerful, but simply an immortal being of superior power and knowledge, sufficient to ensure a blessed and carefree exis- tence. Combine this with the fact that humankind's knowledge of the gods and their ways could never be anything more than partial,28 and it is easy to see how, from a Greek perspective, there may exist many more gods than we humans currently know about.29 Moreover, given the understandable displeasure of the gods at being rejected,3" we natu- rally reach a point where it is always wise to respect new gods if they appear before us. However, showing respect for new gods, or for those of another people,31 is not the same thing as worshipping them.32 The 27 In addition, polytheistic systems are always open-ended and able to accommodate "new" gods (cf. Gladigow [1998]). Greek polytheism is no exception. No less significant perhaps were the absence of a central religious authority (the Delphic oracle responded to questions; it did not take the initiative) and the Greek aversion to all forms of dogmatism about the gods. Graf (1997) 497 reminds us that "Was die Konstruktion eines Pantheons vieler G6tter gegeniiber derjenigen einer einzigen Gottheit leistet und weswegen die eine die andere abl6st, ist noch weithin unverstanden; auch die Eigenheiten des griechischen Polytheismus sind wenig systematisch erforscht." 28 One of the most eloquent statements of this fundamental religious belief (cf. Rud- hardt [1958] 60, 100-101, 107-111), a type of epistemological humility, is made by the Chorus of the Helen, baffled by the unlucky life of the heroine, who is a child of Zeus: 6rnt E6; i ii9 el e; ij 'r . t oov / i ( rl&lt;o' apeva6aa;q Pporiov; K r. ( 1136-1150). Com- pare Herodotus' arresting confession, "I think that all men know an equal amount about these matters [sc. tr 8"Ea]" (2.3.2). 29 This position was later advanced by Epicurus and his followers: cf. Cic. Nat. D. 1.18-124, Schmid (1962) 730-755 for Epicurean theology and its critics. 30 Aphrodite states this most explicitly: toO; plv aVoovrxaq &amp;r'&amp; 1tpE pe oia) rKpaql, / ap0Xio 6' oaot (ppovo3otyv ci ilj&amp;S jiiya. / ivECat ' Pyp ij K/rv 6Eov yvErt 166"E / xttCig evot Xaiporotyv d&amp;v6piuatv iTo (Hipp. 5-8). Cadmus, who was once willing to connive with the "new god" Dionysus in a profitable deception (333-336), generalizes the folly of Pentheus' conduct into a broader statement of piety: Ei 8' iEorlv oartg ; atPov&lt;ov IOcteptppovEi, / g ,;to06' &amp;dptijaa; Ovatov ilydEioao Oco$; (Bacch. 1325-1326). 31 Herodotus treats the Persian gods even-handedly, despite the country's hostility to Greece and the (from a Greek perspective) startling absence of anthropomorphism in its religion (Hdt. 1.131.1). 32 The Egyptian Herald of Aeschylus' Suppliants naturally worships "the gods who live beside the Nile" (ro;g &amp;dwA;pi NEtiov 6acjlova;q aGepioat [922]); his mistake is to disrespect the suppliant rights granted by the native gods of Argos: ouroT &lt;popoocpat 86atova;q 'ro; EvAd6ie / o1 ynap g9' 0peipiav, o86k yrparoo 'rpo(pfit (893-894).

NEW GODS Before we consider the impact of the new gods in Athens and in tragedy, we should first ask, who are these new gods and what is it that makes them new? The Anatolian goddess Cybele, for example, also known as the Great Mother, the Mountain Mother, and the Mother of the Gods, had been worshipped in Athens for at least a century (and probably more)34 before the Nurse's reference to her in Euripides' Hip- polytus of 428 B.C.,35 and yet, naturalized as she was in cult, even she remained an exotic outsider in literature and myth. The solution to this paradox lies in the unique role of poets (&amp;otio0) in popularizing and maintaining a distinctive vision of the Greek gods. Famously, the poets' central role in the formation of the Greek pantheon led Herodotus to claim for two of them, Homer and Hesiod, the prestigious status of ItpwToq EpcEETi;: 06ev 8 6yEvovVTo i'Kotoxog TOV 08E'v, EitE aiXEi Toav 1 rtEVTr;, o6otioi rE MVE t Et&amp;i' , OKm 'ptatotaTxo L pt o TpQinv TV T aE K(Xi x0;6q cq eitE)fv ,6yot.

Cf. also Hdt. 2.156.5-6, where he explains Aeschylus' unique genealogy of Artemis as the daughter of Demeter (fr. 333 Radt) as a result of conflation with the Egyptian pantheon, where Bubastis (Artemis) is a child of Isis (Demeter).

(2.53.1-3) But it was only, so to speak, yesterday or the day before that the Greeks came to know whence each of the gods derived their exis- tence or whether they had always existed and what they were like in appearance. For Hesiod and Homer lived not more than 400 years before my time, as I believe; and it is they who through their poetry gave the Greeks a theogony and gave the gods their titles, and they who assigned their statuses and skills and gave an indica- tion of their appearance.36 With the benefit of a broader view, Homer and Hesiod now appear not as theogonists ex nihilo, but as heirs to an anthropomorphic tradition that owed more to Near Eastern myth and religion than to everyday rit- ual practice in eighth-century Greece. Nevertheless, although the very worship of a pantheon of twelve gods was itself an eastern import,37 the Greek poets succeeded in creating a distinctive vision of divine society.38 And as their poetry on divine and heroic themes spread throughout Greece, its popularity helped articulate a Panhellenic reli- gious koine from which the non-Homeric, or post-Homeric, gods were naturally excluded. Thus, while later religious imports such as Cybele or Pan eventually became established figures of Athenian cult, they and others like them were always "new gods" since they arrived after the poets had defined the shape of the Greek pantheon.39 36 Trans. Gould (1994) 104, adapted. 37 Burkert (1985) 125. The number twelve was canonical, though Dionysus, Ares, and Hestia are not always included; cf. Georgoudi (1996). 3X For the Altar of the Twelve Gods in the Athenian agora, dedicated by the younger Peisistratus in 522/521, see Thuc. 6.54.6-7, IG 12 761 (= ML I1); cf. Hdt. 2.7, 6.108, Ar. Knights 235 (an oath by the Twelve Gods), Diod. 17.95.1 (Alexander builds an altar to the Twelve in India). The depiction of the Twelve on the east face of the Parthenon frieze, at the culmination of the scene's ritual narrative, marks the gods' unique status at the core of the Athenian pantheon. 39 Burkert (1992) 98 observes of Aphrodite, for example, "It is possible that the name Aphrodite itself is a Greek form of western Semitic Ashtorith, who in turn is identical with Ishtar." Bonnet and Pirenne-Delforge (1999) confirm and elaborate Burkert's description. Yet despite her origins outside Greece, Aphrodite was part of the divine world of epic and so never a "new god" in this sense. On the Panhellenic gods of Greek epic and tragedy, see Mastronarde (2002) 21-22.</page><page sequence="10">122 William Allan Although the definition of "new gods" just outlined is, it will be argued, the one reflected most prominently in tragedy's representation of its own religious history, it is nevertheless important that it be seen within the larger context of Greek thought about the origins and history of the gods. Here, too, especially in the Hesiodic tradition of "former gods" who were displaced by the current ruling powers, Greek religion is deeply influenced by Near Eastern literature and myth."4 But it should be stressed that the Greeks developed a wide range of ideas about the ages and generations of the gods, so that even the "succession myth" came in various forms, as when (in the Orphic theogony of the Derveni Papyrus) Zeus swallows the penis of Ouranos.41 In the Prometheus Bound, the divine Prometheus, son of the Titan Iapetus, rails against the leader of the new Olympian regime; the gods who ruled before, he says, are being arrogantly abused: atyapta yxp T66 ZEiS i6totq v6totq Kpatv'ov nEpigqpavov OEO'; tO;T idtpo; EvieiKvXotyv aixtCgiv. (PV 402-405) Ruling by self-appointed laws in this unrestrained manner, Zeus displays a spear of arrogance against the former gods. As the god who prevented Zeus from utterly annihilating the human race (PV 233-238) and as the cultural benefactor of mankind (450- 506), the tortured Prometheus is a sympathetic figure, and the audience will take seriously his far from flattering view of the new powers that be.42 (Even if the trilogy ended with Prometheus' release by Heracles, uneasiness with Zeus' conduct is not annulled.) In the Eumenides, by contrast, where the Erinyes present Apollo's support for Orestes partly in terms of arrogant younger gods versus the venerable old,43 both the 41 Cf. West (1997a) 111, 297-299, 568. 41 Pace West (1983) 85-87, BernabW (2002) 105-111 has argued that Proto- gonos/Phanes does not appear in the theogony discussed by the Derveni commentator, and follows the latter in taking ai6oiov (PDerv. xiii.4, xvi.1) as a noun, referring to the penis of Ouranos (not to Protogonos, the predecessor of Ouranos), a no less un-Hesiodic account; so too Burkert (1999) 97 n. 49. 42 In a fragment of an unknown play by Aeschylus (fr. 281a Radt), Dike gives a posi- tive account of Zeus' overthrow of his father Kronos. 43 m na At6i . / i tAiKho7to; ntiJkit, / vioq 6&amp; ypaia; 8ailova;q wanatrir6oo (149-150);</page><page sequence="11">Religious Syncretism: The New Gods of Greek Tragedy 123 outcome of the trial and the Erinyes' acceptance of their new identity and cult as cg.tva&amp; cai' (1041), goddesses of fertility and marriage (834-836) rather than barrenness (784-787 = 814-817), create the impression of divine and human progress combined. The transformation of the Erinyes is also particularly interesting because, although it does not involve, strictly speaking, the creation of new gods, it does combine the identity of the Erinyes with that of the Semnai for the first time in surviving sources.44 In other words, it is a striking instance of internal syncretism within tragedy, and may per- haps be an innovation by Aeschylus himself, an imaginative combina- tion whose positive thrust (insofar as the formerly implacable avengers, the Erinyes, become powers who bless their worshippers) well suits the optimistic and conciliatory spirit of the closing scenes of the Oresteia.45 Moreover, the final play of the trilogy begins with a fascinating (and, again, highly innovative) description of Apollo's first arrival at Delphi: the arrival of the new god of prophecy provokes no violent struggle with a monstrous snake or reluctant goddess, but a birthday party, as Apollo receives the oracle as a present (yewviWtov 8dotv [Eum. 71) from Phoebe.46 Bearing in mind, then, our definition of the new gods as those absent from the divine and heroic myths of Panhellenic poetry, let us now turn to the reception and worship of these gods in Athens. As Robert Parker has recently shown, "the common supposition that the last quarter of the fifth century saw a sudden outburst of interest in bar- barian gods is simply false."47 The truth is, moreover, far more compli- cated and more interesting than previous studies would have it, with a desperate and demoralized Athens suddenly prey to alien penetration.

If one seeks a reason for the schol- arly bias against "foreign" cults, it is likely to be found in too literal a reading of Aristophanes (see below), combined with the fact that the new gods appear more often in later fifth-century tragedy than before, the period (it was thought) of Athens', and tragedy's, decline. On the contrary, if the new gods and their syncretism bulk largest in Euripides, this is no sign of decadence and corruption (religious or generic), but because that author foregrounds religion (in the broadest sense, includ- ing both ritual acts and reflections on the origins and history of reli- gious practices) far more than Aeschylus and Sophocles (or any other Greek poet). Furthermore, it will be argued here that we should see the new gods and their syncretism (in both literature and cult) as a positive phenomenon, diversifying the religious life of Athens and enriching the superhuman world of the dramas. Such religious innovations were not aberrant or unprecedented, either in Athens or any other city.49 Beneath the calm and apparently stable surface of the Olympian divine society there existed a plethora of cults and divine figures, while the religious system of every polis was constantly developing, each in unique ways.50 It was standard through- out the Greek world to refer issues of religious change such as the introduction of new cults to oracular authorities.51 However, the approval of Delphi or Dodona, for example, would come, if at all, only at the end of a period of lobbying by the new cult's supporters, both in their own city and, one can well imagine, at the shrine of the oracular god concerned. This leads us, in turn, to a fundamental issue, namely, the importance of official public approval for new cults. Though a group's rituals need not change, ratification by the assembly trans- formed them from a "sect" into a part of established religion.52 Thus, 48 Dodds (1951) 193. 49 Also, as Parker (1996) 163 has shown of Athenian religion, "foreign gods arrive ear- lier and in greater number than is sometimes recognized, and are more variously received." 5o In the city outlined in Plato's Laws, the twelve Olympians are made the eponyms of the city's twelve tribes and there are no new gods (cf. Morrow [1960] 434-470); like much else in Plato's ideal state, this is far from the reality of his native Athens. 51 E.g., IG 13 136.31 (permission granted from Delphi regarding the introduction of Bendis at Athens, c. 413/412); cf. Rosenberger (2001) 69-78. 52 As Parker (1996) 163 observes, "The crucial distinction is not between foreign and native but between established and non-established cults."</page><page sequence="13">Religious Syncretism: The New Gods of Greek Tragedy 125 although Athens later enjoyed a reputation for 4eviax towards foreign gods,53 one risked prosecution if one attempted to establish a cult with- out the assembly's permission.54 The notion that new gods could be added to the pantheon with little fuss derives ultimately from Christian polemic against pagan polytheism. As the fate of Socrates shows, it was dangerous to introduce, or confess belief in, "new divine things" (icatv'x x6ai6vta) unless they were recognized by the polis at large.55 And while a private individual might establish a new cult at his own expense, as Telemachus did at Athens with the Epidaurian god Ascle- pius in 420/419,56 he could do so only after consultation with the polis authorities.57 If one considers how deeply embedded religion was within Greek society, it is clear that the introduction of new cults will always have been a serious political issue (using the word "political" in the widest Greek sense).58 Insofar as the worship of new gods entailed that the bal- ance of divine powers within the local pantheon be adjusted, and inso- far as ritual tends by its very nature to be conservative, the new gods can only have won acceptance if they were widely felt to be offering real and novel benefits. Fear of divine anger was, as noted above, one motivation for acceptance, but equally important was the expectation that new gods would promote the interests of their worshippers. More- over, as a negative corollary, the divine arrivistes and their personnel might be perceived as a threat to the interests of established religious groups, where "interest" pertains to many sources of value and prestige, both economic and spiritual.59 Such tensions would have to be handled 53 Cf. Strabo 10.3.18, who says of the Athenians that "they welcomed so many of the foreign rites that they were ridiculed by comic writers." 54 In the fourth century the priestess Nino was executed in Athens on a charge of initi- ating people in the rites of non-established gods (Josephus Ap. 2.267; cf. Dem. 19.28 1). 55 Cf. Yunis (1988) 62-66, Parker (1996) 199-217. For Socrates as ai0Eoq in his intro- duction of new gods (PI. Apol. 26c), see Auffarth (1995) 341-342. 56 IG 112 4960; cf. Garland (1992) 116-135, Parker (1996) 175-185. 57 Themistocles is said to have offended many people by setting up a shrine to Artemis Aristoboule (of Excellent Counsel) after the battle of Salamis (Plut. Them. 22). As Gar- land (1992) 75 persuasively argues, the offence was at least partly due to the lack of offi- cial approval for the new cult. S For the "embeddedness" of Greek religion, see Bremmer (1994) 2-4, Connor (1988). 59 The economic aspects of religion, and by extension the economic consequences of religious innovation for both its promoters and rivals, are reflected in the scenes of tragedy where a king suspects a prophet of prostituting his craft for profit: OT 387-389, Bacch. 255-257. More concretely, a new deity would need to buy or rent land for his or</page><page sequence="14">126 William Allan carefully if the new cult was not to alienate potential members.6t The very fact that one can speak of "potential" worshippers at all raises another crucial point, namely the status of many new religious groups, especially those with ecstatic rites, as elective cults. The actual number of elective cults in Athens is irrecoverable but must have been large, proportionate to the number of metics and slaves who lived there, and the (more or less) transient non-Athenians and non-Greeks, all of whom will have sought to express their (religious) identity and satisfy their religious needs, creating a ritually multifarious community.61 As Athens' empire expanded, not only would awareness of foreign gods grow, but increased trade, migration, and slavery will have brought more of them to Athens.62 Moreover, the authority of the popular assembly in religious matters will have weakened the ability of wealthy and exclusive priestly families to block the incorporation of new cults.63 Although one should not take the approval of the popular assembly as implying that the new cults were specifically "democratic" in a partisan sense, their popularity among people of all classes is sig- nificant. The scholarly tendency to see the new gods, and especially those with ecstatic rites, as the sort of thing the lower classes might be more prone to indulge in, betrays the same misconceptions that have her shrine. The only probable fifth-century case of land ownership being granted to non- citizens is that given to the Thracians for a shrine of Bendis in the Piraeus (IG 112 1238. a decree of the third century B.C., but referring to the original grant). The Erinyes begin to change their mind when Athena offers them "part-ownership of this land": AO. iSEortt yhip aot rfi o6e ya(X6po Xov6q / Evact Gticaoq Eci; t6 irtv tt;oLp'g vrlt. / XO. iivosc' 'A0dvoa, rtiva LE (pilit EXEtv ~6pav; (Eum. 890-892). 6o The dispute preserved in Lysias 30, the prosecution of Nicomachus in 399 B.c., testi- fies to the perils of unauthorized religious change (for Nicomachus' revised sacred calen- dar, set up in the Stoa of the Archon Basileus, see IG 13 239-240; cf. Parker [1996] 43-45, 218-220). 61 The accounts from the 420s (IG 13 369 and 383) of the Treasurers of the Other Gods list around three dozen deities (other than Athena) supported by the public purse, includ- ing Adonis, Bendis, Sabazius, and the Mother of the Gods. Although metics could take part to some extent in the public cults, they also had their own private associations; cf. Whitehead (1977) 86-89. 62 For the contrary flow, see Parker (1994), Lveque (1973a) 52, "Ce syncr6tisme a permis, en sens inverse, un acces plus facile des indigines i la religion grecque." Cf. also IG 13 14, decreeing that the Erythraeans on the coast of Lydia should contribute to the celebration of the Panathenaic festival (c. 450). 63 Price (1999) 151 discusses, by way of contrast, the closer links between religious authority and political power in Rome.</page><page sequence="15">Religious Syncretism: The New Gods of Greek Tragedy 127 long obscured the prevalence of "magic" at all levels of ancient Greek society.64 III. COMEDY Though the relationship between literature and cult is always oblique, the diversity, range, and complexity of Athenian religion are reflected in both tragedy and comedy. Let us consider comedy first, not simply because it represents the religion of everyday life more closely than tragedy does, but because it allows us to see how, in terms of syn- cretism, tragedy presents the gods in revealingly different ways. To begin with comedy is also to re-emphasize that, despite the appeal of tragedy and comedy beyond Athens in the fifth century and beyond, we are dealing primarily with Athenian religion, and should seek to relate the new gods to the Athenian pantheon and its changing divine identi- ties.65 As is shown by the surviving plays and fragments, religion was no more exempt than politics from the irreverent and absurdist logic of Old Comedy, and we see religious language and rituals being freely adapted, as when Dicaeopolis wins the drinking contest of an imagi- nary Anthesteria at the end of the Acharnians (esp. 960-962, 1225- 1234), or the Chorus of Eleusinian initiates combine cult-like hymns to Iacchus with demands that traditional enemies of comedy (politicians, tax-collectors, musical innovators, and other comic dramatists) stand apart from their holy dances and Mysteries (Frogs 316-459). Comedy differs most obviously from tragedy in that new gods actu- ally appear on stage. However, it is important to note that these divine figures are not the new gods of Athenian cult and religious syncretism. The immortal Amphitheus who brings the Spartan treaties to Dicaeopo- lis is a purely invented figure, even if his genealogy is linked (in a ludi- crous fashion) to Demeter of Eleusis (Ach. 47-50), while the Triballian god who accompanies Poseidon and Heracles on the embassy to Cloud- 64 See Fowler (2000) 321. It is significant that the Nurse in Eur. Hipp. imagines her royal mistress as potentially possessed by the new gods (Pan, Cybele, and her Corybants): see n. 35 above. 65 Insistence on the particularism of polis religion is both necessary and illuminating, since it counters the tendency to flatten out the differences among the cults and rituals of the Greeks: cf., e.g., Parker (1988), who argues that Demeter and Dionysus had a greater role in the Spartan pantheon than was previously thought.</page><page sequence="16">128 William Allan cuckooland is merely a divine version of the stereotypically savage and stupid barbarians ridiculed elsewhere in comedy (Birds 1520-1524, 1567-1573, 1628, 1677-1682). Socrates refers to the Clouds as "our own deities" (Clouds 252) and later adds Void (X&amp;og), Tongue (Fi~tora), and Whirl (Aivo;) to complete a fantastic pantheon (380- 381, 424, 1470-1474). Interestingly, when Peisetaerus announces that he will sacrifice to the new gods of Cloudcuckooland, two of the bird divinities are mod- eled on the new gods of Athens, namely, Sabazius and Cybele, the Great Mother (873-876).66 In the opening scene of the Wasps Sabazius is mentioned alongside the Corybants, Cybele's divine attendants: the humor plays on the Corybants' frenzied dancing and the sleepiness induced by Sabazius (perhaps through wine: 8-10).67 Elsewhere Sabaz- ius is associated with ecstatic music and unruly women: &amp;p' SXXaiCtW E TOv 7vvatiKcv 7 tpuTJpii / da tinavtio;b~ Xot iEKvoi XapoLtot (Lys. 387-388).68 The male magistrate here condemning the women contin- ues: 06 T' 'A8tovtaaC b o' oT ot1i t)Iv T·Tyov, / o 'yw 7toTr' Ov TijKOJOV iv triKKXo(iat; (389-390).69 Do these deities (Sabazius, Adonis, and the Corybants) have anything in common? Although it is often claimed that Sabazius was especially popular among women and slaves, the evi- 66 Cybele becomes an ostrich; Sabazius is called qpputpiXoq opvtq for the pun on Opi3ytoq, but the exact identification of the bird is unclear (see Dunbar on 762-763); Sommerstein calls it a "frigate-bird" for the sake of the word-play. For the rich cultural background to the cult epithet ALoxtotva Kupi3rl, see Henrichs (1976). 67 Bdelycleon attempts, without success, to use Corybantic rites as a cathartic cure for his father's "illness" (Wasps 119-120); cf. Dodds (1951) 77-80, Burkert (1987) 19. 68Cf. also Ar. Seasons fr. 578 Kassel-Austin tbv Opwya, rov arj'Xrfipa, trv laplýtov. The earliest representation of Sabazius in Greek art is on a classical Athenian volute-krater (LIMC s.v. Sabazios 1), which shows the god enthroned beside Cybele; both Sabazius and the thiasos of dancing women have snakes around their heads. For the con- flation of Sabazius and Dionysus in the private mysteries of Dem. 0,: 18.259-260, see Yunis (2001) 254-256. 69 The women's nocturnal rooftop meetings are presented from a similarly suspicious male viewpoint in Menander, Samia 39-48, where Moschion recalls his rape of a girl at the Adonia. Gomme and Sandbach (1973) 549 remark "The festival was much kept by hetairai (Diphilos frag. 43, 50), because of the association with Aphrodite, and we may see the occasion as one likely to arouse Moschion's passions." Many of the ancient (male) sources refer to drinking and licentiousness; the references are collected by Deub- ner (1932) 220-222. For the death of Adonis in early Greek poetry, see Sappho frs. 140, 168 Voigt; cf. also LIMC s.v. 45-51 for depictions of the festival and the gardens of Ado- nis. In Panyassis fr. 22a EGF he is conflated with Erichthonius, as Aphrodite entrusts the baby Adonis to Persephone in a chest and the goddesses quarrel over his return.</page><page sequence="17">Religious Syncretism: The New Gods of Greek Tragedy 129 dence is too scarce to allow certainty. And while Adonis was wor- shipped only by women, they came from all social classes. Neverthe- less, it does seem significant that none of the three new gods targeted by comic criticism had official polis cults.70 All three were celebrated privately, and two (Sabazius and the Corybants) involved ecstasy and initiation.71 The marginal status of these new gods and the suspicion of orgiastic rites made them ripe targets for comedy, but the jokes in the surviving plays are (by Aristophanes' standards) rather gentle;72 never- theless, as Cicero's report (quoted above) indicates, a far more hostile approach was possible, and this may have reflected the contempt of some Athenians for these (and other) non-established gods.73 However, as we shall soon see in more detail, the syncretism one finds in comedy is on the whole more limited and straightforward than that of tragedy. Insofar as Old Comedy, unlike tragedy and satyr play, is generally set in the here and now of the audience, it is closer to the everyday religion of Athens.74 The new gods, therefore, are part of the plays' religious uni- verse (which shows the consequences of contact syncretism). More- over, the gods are presented in terms of separate divine identities; that is, they reflect their manifestation in contemporary religion, where gods and their cults tend to be distinct. By contrast, the heroic and mythical world of tragedy requires an altogether more radical type of syncretism if the new gods are to be included at all. IV. TRAGEDY The relationship between the gods of tragedy and those of real reli- gion has long been a controversial theme.75 Some, indeed, have denied 70 Although Cybele had a public cult, the frenzied Corybants involved private thiasoi. 71 For Corybantic initiations, cf. Pl. Euthyd. 277d; also Parker (1996) 162 n. 33, 194. 72 The attack on Socrates is a good deal more spirited, but his "new gods" are of a dif- ferent kind, as his "atheism" takes the form of private "kainotheism." 73 Sabazius and Adonis are not mentioned in fifth-century tragedy. Dionysius 1, tyrant of Sicily, wrote an Adonis in the fourth century: TrGF 1 76 F I. Comic resistance to reli- gious innovation is accompanied by humor at the expense of old-fashioned festivals and rituals, as when the Kronia and Diopolieia are called antiquated (note, however, that the attacks come from Socrates and the Worse Argument: Clouds 398, 984-985). 74 Mythological settings and parody became more popular in Middle Comedy: Nessel- rath (1990) 188-241. 75 The debate about tragedy's own ritual origins knows no end, but is not our concern here, since we must distinguish between theories of ritual origins and the analysis of ritu-</page><page sequence="18">130 William Allan that there is any relationship at all: as one scholar has declared, "The gods of poetry are, I would claim, the products of literary fantasy and genius, not of the Greek religious spirit."76 Yet, given what we know of the myriad connections between the gods of Greek literature and their manifestations in art, sacred laws, curse tablets, votive gifts, and so on, such a radical disjunction seems implausible, to say the least. While there is clearly no simple one-to-one correspondence between the all- too-human gods of myth and those of everyday religion, the areas of overlap compensate for the distancing and abstracting effects of the artistic medium, and the resulting connections drawn by the audience of tragedy make it, from the perspective of religion, a peculiarly exploratory and challenging genre. At the same time, however, it would be simple-minded to see criticism of the gods in tragedy as an attack on religious worship. 77 Myths are not scripture, and tragedy does not seek to undermine religion, but to explore it. The meeting of tragedy and religion leads us to another area of con- vergence, namely, that of overlapping divine identities. The Great Dionysia were open to non-Athenians and enjoyed a Panhellenic repu- tation.78 Yet a Thessalian visitor, say, could comprehend the Apollo of the tragic stage as recognizably the same divine figure worshipped in his native cults. Thus, although the study of tragedy, and of the new gods therein, involves thinking about Athenian religion first and fore- most, the presence of the new gods in public and private worship throughout Greece should not be forgotten. The interaction of the new gods with the established Olympians will have fascinated audiences far beyond Athens, even if Athenian religion, due to the nature and provenance of the evidence, will be our primary focus. In what follows, then, we shall ask to what extent the new gods of tragedy reflect devel- opments in the religion of fifth-century Athens, but always bearing in als embedded in tragedy: see Easterling (1993). Nestle (1934) remains a valuable collec- tion of primary material on the religious outlook of the tragedians: see 1.I 17-133 on Aeschylus, 2.83-102 on Sophocles, and 2.114-130 on Euripides. 76 Mikalson (1991) 5, searchingly criticized by Sourvinou-Inwood (1997). 77 Having experienced the Trojan Women, for example, it is unlikely that the audience would stop honoring the gods of cult, for all the divine indifference to mortal suffering within the play; nevertheless, they would be encouraged to reflect on the precariousness of their relationship to the gods, including their manifestations in everyday ritual. 78 Moreover, the tragedies were being performed and enjoyed far beyond Athens from an early period: cf. Easterling (1994), Allan (2001). For the deme Dionysia of Attica, see SEG 43.26 and Pickard-Cambridge (1968) 42-56.</page><page sequence="19">Religious Syncretism: The New Gods of Greek Tragedy 13 I1 mind that such innovations were not peculiar to that city. Naturally, the goal of the argument is not to claim that the new gods are the most important feature of the religious world of Greek tragedy, but to show that they deserve and repay closer attention. Let us now turn to the plays, beginning with two fragmentary but intriguing passages. The first is by the late fifth-century tragedian, Dio- genes of Athens: oKaiot oKX Ci)( iv 'Aao o Ctd ;go ttrp 06poU0 K4up3in; yuvaiiCa;, nait6a; 6X1(owDv Opuy~ov, 'runacvotat KW r 64po1otaIO t K ck XcoKTOl'n(0v 36p43LPot; pqoioa;r 0;v 'rt'pt K'41tcxXWV oofpiv ~OEV (Ov UvOni6v itp6v 0' i~pa. (TrGF 145 F 1.1-6) I hear the women with their mitred heads, followers of Asiatic Cybele, daughters of the blessed Phrygians, who with their tym- pana and the whirling of the resounding brass and the clashing of cymbals in their hands roar out &lt;... &gt; the wise and healing musi- cian of the gods.79 Athenaeus, who quotes the passage, ascribes it to Diogenes' Semele (14.636a). If he is right, the description (narrated, perhaps, by Semele herself) points to the syncretism of the myths of Dionysus and Cybele, and perhaps even to a dramatic Chorus of Cybele's devotees. Of course, the syncretism of these two deities is familiar to us from the Bacchae (58-59, 78-82, 123-134), to which we shall return, but the extract from Diogenes suggests that Euripides was not alone in combining Dio- nysiac myth and cult with that of the new gods.80 The second fragmentary passage comes from Euripides' Cretans, probably produced early in his career."8 Addressing their anapaestic entrance song to King Minos, the Chorus of Cretan priests of Zeus declare: 79 Trans. Roller (1999) 151, 183, adapted. 8o It is unclear whether the Suda's remark that Diogenes "y'yovEv at the time of the dissolution of the Thirty [403 B.C.]" (T I Snell-Kannicht) refers to the poet's floruit or to his first production. 81 Cf. Cropp and Fick (1985) 70, 82 (between 455 and 428, Webster's "severe style" in metrical terms); see further Webster (1967) 3-4, 87-92, Collard (1995) 58.</page><page sequence="20">132 William Allan &amp;yvv  , 3 iov TEi VOpEV E oi~ AtbO'IxSai ou~ CoTrl ytv6lgTIV KaC v1CtOutnOXo1 Zaypxo; po6trlq; trx(; cLo(p(Xyo; 6ai"ta;, rXo(Ya;, Mrltpi t' 6pEiat 6&amp;ta; &amp;vCaoX(Ov g&amp;etx Koupeitov 13XKXOS ci¢cri1rOv 6oti0oeei . np lcX; ca &amp;' lov Ei'pxata (pE'7o yEveaGv -E ppor'wv cai verCpoOijaO; ( ) oU Xptgixr6dpvo; poex'tv 68royrTv tE(Pi3 aygxt.

Dressed all in white I shun both the birth of mortals and the burial-places of the dead, not approaching &lt;.. .&gt;,82 and I have guarded myself against the eating of living food.83 The passage is remarkable, even by Euripides' standards, for the sheer number of conflated rituals and cults: Idaean Zeus is combined with Dionysus (implied by Zagreus, the herdsman, nocturnal rites, raw flesh, and bakchos), while Zeus' mother Rhea is associated with Cybele, the Mountain Mother. Yet the mixture is not yet complete: the priests are also white-robed vegetarians who are keen to preserve their ritual purity. Is it possible that such a group of ritually hypereclectic, raw flesh-eating vegetarians had any basis in reality? Clearly not, yet the description is enlightening in several respects:84 firstly, it is early evi- 82 Diggle (TrGFS, p. 116) suggests, e.g., roiotv oaapoiq ("the polluted"). 83 Trans. Collard (1995) 59-61, adapted. 84 Nock (1933) 30, presumably influenced by the priests' vegetarianism, took the pas- sage as evidence of "the possible existence of Orphic communities"; so too Harrison (1908) 478, who called it "the most important literary document extant on Orphic cere- monial." However, if Euripides did have any ascetic community in mind (and the hodge- podge of ritual details tells against this), they are more likely to have been Pythagoreans, since they (unlike Orphics) lived in exclusive communities: see Parker (1995) 504. By contrast, the mystical-intellectual-vegetarian attacked by Theseus is clearly labeled</page><page sequence="21">Religious Syncretism: The New Gods of Greek Tragedy 133 dence for Euripides' particular interest in the details of cult; secondly, it shows an awareness of new or foreign cults and the possibility of trac- ing similarities and connections between them; and thirdly, it suggests how the new gods may be used in tragedy for a variety of ends, as here the artificially exotic rites of the Cretan priests are a prelude for the bizarre events to come, including the appearance of the baby Minotaur. In short, the impact of a new god's appearance depends on context, yet his or her involvement invariably extends and diversifies the supernatu- ral context of the action. In tragedy religion is always integrated into the theatrical perfor- mance and its setting within heroic myth. Thus, the more developed form of syncretism found in tragedy (compared to comedy) is a direct result of the need to incorporate the new gods and cults within the reli- gious framework of the established myths. Significantly, this observa- tion also allows us to appreciate tragedy's own role as a syncretizing force, both within Greek culture and, perhaps no less significantly, within our modern concept of Greek religion. For if we tend to think of Greek religion as inherently syncretistic, we might pause to ask whether such blending and conflation really did take place in cult-or is our view of syncretism overly influenced by the picture of religion presented in tragedy? Yet, even if syncretism was not as pervasive in everyday religion as tragedy makes it seem, the level of syncretism in the plays does point to the strong presence of the new gods in fifth-cen- tury ritual and cult, as the poets included them in myths that did not originally have a place for them. In this respect the tragedians may be described as "historians" of religion (in the widest sense), whose works offer us snapshots, however transmuted, of the developing pantheon of fifth-century Athens. So let us look in more detail at the new gods in action.85 Having considered Adonis and Sabazius above, we may begin with the closest group, the non-Attic immigrants Pan and Asclepius. Notably, the arrival of these two Greek gods in Athens is better, and more positively, attested than that of their "foreign" counterparts. (Of course, from the Orphic (Hipp. 952-957). Here, however, the audience will recall Hippolytus the hunter from the prologue (cf. 108-110, where he orders his servants to prepare "a table full from the hunt") and so realize that Theseus' rage fuels his distorting rhetoric. Nevertheless, it is significant that Theseus chooses to insult and marginalize Hippolytus in these terms, stressing his religious abnormality. 85 As Parker (1996) 188 observes, the new gods "need to be considered one by one."</page><page sequence="22">134 William Allan perspective of traditional Athenian cult, Pan and Asclepius are every bit as "foreign" as Adonis, Bendis, Cotyto, Cybele, and Sabazius, yet their Greekness influenced their popular perception.) Herodotus tells how the Athenians, accepting Philippides' claim that Pan had appeared to him on Mt.

For now I intend to dance. The god is summoned from Cyllene, his birthplace in Arcadia, yet he is also called "sea-roaming" and the dancer of "Mysian and Cnossian steps." Sung by a Salaminian Chorus and addressed to an Athenian audience, the epithet "sea-roaming" will evoke Psyttaleia, the small island beside Salamis, known for its cult of Pan.

Here the Attic Pan enhances the audience's identification with the Chorus, while the com- bination of a local cult with the rites of two ecstatic goddesses height- ens their sense of the Chorus' overwhelming rapture and relief: Ajax, they now believe, has given up his anger against the sons of Atreus (cf. 716-718), and the Chorus' response is an outburst of pure joy.95 Insofar as the audience can see through Ajax's feigned change of mind, the blissful syncretism of the Chorus' song stresses their naivet6 and sharp- ens the foreboding of Ajax's great deception speech (646-692). 93 At Ag. 55-56 the Chorus name Pan along with Apollo and Zeus as avengers of the bereft vultures (the Atreidae); in context the "lord of the mountain forest" (Fraenkel on 55 f.) becomes a stern punisher of the Trojans. In an opening scene of great alarm Hector wonders if the Chorus of Trojan sentries have been "panicked" by the god: &amp;XX' ik Kpo- vio l navbq rpogLep&amp;at / idart¶ (ytpopfit; (Rhesus 36-37). 94 As it happens, the manuscripts all have Niota at Aj. 699, but MUata is restored from POxy. 1615 (3rd/4th cent.

Hymn 26.5, Bacch. 566-569, 951-952), which would suit the tenor of the Chorus' song, but the association of Pan and Cybele is more frequently attested (cf. Krummen [1998] 312 n. 39) and supported by the papyrus (Lloyd-Jones and Wilson [1990] 23): cf. Pind.

Here too we must ask why the artists have chosen to combine the particular divine figures as they have.</page><page sequence="25">Religious Syncretism: The New Gods of Greek Tragedy 137 Though not a frequent figure in tragedy, Asclepius is of interest since his life and afterlife allow us to trace one particular route for the evolution of a new god. In Homer Asclepius is a mortal healer from Thessaly,96 but at some point in the archaic period he received hero-cult (centered at first in Thessaly and Messenia) and by the late fifth century he was a popular god of healing throughout Greece.97 One is reminded of Prodicus' theory that the gods developed from the deification of material and human benefactors of mankind.98 In the prologue of the Alcestis, Apollo tells how Zeus killed his son Asclepius (3-4), his crime the raising of the dead. Such resurrections not only offend the gods, but also run counter to the traditional eschatology of heroic myth, where death is final (even Heracles, the greatest Greek hero, cannot be resurrected, but becomes a god). So here the death of (the mortal) Asclepius is used at the start of the play to reinforce the idea that humans are not meant to return from the dead, but at the same time alludes to its possibility, thus presaging the seemingly untragic resur- rection of Alcestis. As it happens, the closest connection between tragedy and the divine Asclepius relates to a poet rather than a play. According to the Telemachus monument, erected on the southern slope of the Acropolis by the god's private sponsor, Asclepius came to Athens in the form of a snake from his great shrine at Epidaurus in 420/419.99 Later sources say that Sophocles "received the god in his own house and established an altar; and for this reason he was called Dexion [after his death].""'l The posthumous heroization of Sophocles as Dexion has been disputed,0"" but two fourth-century decrees support it.102 Nevertheless, even if the heroization of Sophocles were a later invention, parts of Sophocles' 96 Cf. 11. 2.729-733, referring to his sons Podalirius and Machaon, also healers. 97 Burkert (1992) 75-79 discusses the influence of the Babylonian healing goddess Gula on Asclepius' iconography (particularly his association with dogs).

As we shall see, however, the deities who are most frequently syn- cretized (Cotyto, Cybele, and Dionysus) are all associated with wild- ness and ecstasy. One might have added the Thracian Bendis, whom Strabo (10.316) says was worshipped with Dionysiac (i.e., orgiastic) rites, were it not for the fact that she does not appear in surviving tragedy. Hipponax associates Bendis with Cybele (cxit Atbq Ko'pl KU13ij3 iccal OpEi'KiT1 BEv6t; fr. 127 West), supporting a connection with ecstatic states. Her absence from the syncretistic mix of Attic tragedy is therefore all the more puzzling: it may be sheer coincidence (after all we possess less than 4% of the tragedies produced at the Great Dionysia in the course of the fifth century) or, more speculatively, it may be related to Bendis' peculiarly integrated place within Athenian public cult.105 Her new Piraeus festival is evoked in the opening scene of Plato's Republic (327a-328a), whose dramatic date is around 410 B.C., but her Athenian cult goes back much further.106 In any case, the 103 Furley and Bremer (2001) 1.261-262, 2.219-221 defend the authenticity of Sopho- cles' Paean to Asclepius, based on an Athenian inscription from the third century A.D.; f. Henrichs (1985) 298-301. "4 A connection between the introduction of Asclepius in 420/419 and the recent plague in Athens (430-426) is possible (Parker [1996] 180 calls it "an obvious and plau- sible conjecture"), but we should not extrapolate from this instance that all new cults were a response to a specific political crisis (as does Auffarth [1995] 342). For the healing of a city, cf. OT 151-215 (an invocation of Apollo, Athena, and Artemis to ward off plague), described by Furley and Bremer (2001) 1.307 as "a supplicatory paian addressed to Apollo and the gods most closely associated with him at Delphi." Aristarchus of Tegea, a tragedian contemporary with Euripides, is said to have written an Asclepius (to thank the god for curing him from illness), but nothing of it survives (TrGF 1 14 F 1). I11 comedy, Bdelycleon takes his father to Asclepius' temple at Aegina and makes him undergo incubation in the hope of receiving a cure (Wasps 122-124). In Wealth the blind god regains his sight after a night at the Asclepium in the Piraeus, despite Cario's antics (stealing Asclepius' porridge and farting at him: Wealth 410-412, 633-640, 653-747).

The earliest reference to Bendis in Athenian literature comes from Crati- nus' comedy Thracian Women (frs. 73-89 Kassel-Austin), performed c. 430, where it seems likely that the Chorus of Thracian Women were depicted worshipping her. Bendis was perhaps called the "great goddess" in Aristophanes' Lemnian Women (fr. 384 Kassel- Austin), though the reference could be to Lemnos' eponymous deity. 107 Cf. LIMC s.v.

In any case, this is an interesting example of syncretism that is apparently indepen- dent of Attic cult but nevertheless understandable for an Athenian audi- ence, suggesting their familiarity with the practice (crucial to poetic syncretism) of comparing different rituals and tracing similarities between them. Turning to our final example, the goddess Cybele, it is perhaps no coincidence that she is both the new deity best established in Athens and the one most frequently and extensively syncretized in tragedy. As the Greeks came into contact with the cultures of Asia Minor in the course of the eighth century B.C., their imports included the great Ana- tolian mother goddess, worshipped as Matar, "Mother," and known locally as Kubaba.112 As her cult spread westwards, it combined with indigenous mother goddess cults throughout Greece, including that of the Mother of the Gods known from the Linear B tablets at Pylos.113 ''" For Lycurgus, theomachos of Dionysus, cf. 11. 6.130-137, Ant. 955-965; and for the influence of Aeschylus' Lycurgeia tetralogy (frs. 23-25, 57-67, 124-126, 146-149 Radt) on the Bacchae, see Dodds (1960) xxviii-xxxiii; cf. also Thesm. 134-148. 11 Produced between 424 and 415 B.C., though the majority of editors favour 416 or 415.

Thus, from the very beginning, Cybele's Greek identity was fundamen- tally syncretistic.114 Nevertheless, two features of Cybele's cult contin- ued to display her Anatolian origins, namely her wandering beggar priests, called Kic6prlpo by Semonides (fr. 36 West),"'15 and her repre- sentation in art, carrying a tympanon and enthroned between lions.6 And it is her foreignness which most interests Greek poets, who, signif- icantly, call the goddess Kupril, a name never used in Greek inscrip- tions or votive offerings, where the goddess is thoroughly "naturalized" as MiirlTp.117 However, for a fifth-century Athenian audience, Cybele had, in con- trast to the other new gods, a peculiarly central place in their city's landscape and a correspondingly high status among their respected cults."8 For her shrine, the Metroon, stood in the agora and towards the end of the fifth century even became the official state archive.' 19 As Robert Parker observes, "Cybele in charge of the state documents is an image no less startling than that of Dionysus wedded to the archon basileus' wife."'20 With Metroa built throughout Greece, it is no sur- prise to find the goddess in the works of many different poets. Yet her total absence from the pantheon of heroic myth could only be remedied by much deft assimilation and invention. Hipponax, as we saw, calls Cybele "daughter of Zeus" (fr. 127 West), but her identity as Mother of the Gods made an equation with Rhea, mother of Zeus, an even more "logical" assimilation:'121 thus, in the parodos of the Bacchae, the Cho- I14 As Henrichs (1976) has shown, behind Cybele's Greek cult-titles of "Mother" and "Mistress" (easily attached to indigenous Greek mother and mistress cults) lies centuries- old "Kultursymbiose" (286) between Greece and the Near East. 115 For Cybele's itinerant priests (also called gyrlxpay-uprl; or ya, og;), see Burkert (1979) 102-105, 118-122 (distant origins in Neolithic hunting society). 116 For archaic and classical Greek iconography of Cybele (especially her throne, tym- panon, and lions), see LIMC s.v. Kybele 29-39, 81-98. 117 Cf. Roller (1999) 145. The Scythians' response to her foreignness was rather less nuanced, according to Herodotus: when the Scythian Anacharsis was caught performing Cybele's rites (which he had picked up from an all-night festival in Cyzicus), he was killed by the outraged Scythian king (4.76).

(fr. 70b.8-11 Maehler) In the presence of the awesome Great Mother the rumbling of drums begins, and the castanets clack, and the torches blaze beneath the flame-lit pinetrees. Like Euripides in the Bacchae, Pindar uses Cybele's uncanny presence and exotic music to express the intense ecstasy of Dionysus' rites, while their performance by the Olympians before Cybele creates a scene of elemental religious intoxication.124 repeat their invocation of Cybele-Rhea-Earth (6pEa·r Ipa nactPovrt F&amp;, / atrep axrtoi At6q), first made at Troy (Kr&amp;rE) to witness the award of Achilles' arms to Odysseus. For the possible role of Cybele-Rhea in Sophocles' satyr play Kophoi (Dumb Ones), see Krumeich (1999) 352-354. 122 The myth is aetiological, explaining how Dionysus' worshippers came to have the Mother's drums; in another version Dionysus was cured of madness by Cybele's ecstatic rites and took over her paraphernalia (Apollod. 3.5.1). Cybele's fondness for wild music is the core of Hom. Hymn 14; cf. also TrGF II Frag. Adesp. 629. Socrates compares the rhapsode Ion's "possession" by Homer to that of Cybele's worshippers when her music is played (Plato, Ion 536c). 123 Roller (1996) remarks that (308) "the picture we receive [in tragedy] is significantly at odds with the established Meter of political cult." However, one should not discount the likelihood that some audience members had experience of Cybele's ecstatic rites in private cult associations. Cf. also Eur.

It is also said in the Hymns: "Demeter Rhea Ge Meter Hestia Deio."'26 Similarly, one of the gold leaves from Thurii in southern Italy (4th/3rd c. B.C.) juxtaposes Mother, Cybele, Kore, and Demeter.127 However, such religious and mythological syncretism was by no means limited to Orphic circles.128 The analysis of Ar-gLjitlp as Earth Mother (fi- Mi'trlp) is reflected in tragedy, for example (Phoen. 685-687, Bacch. 275-277),129 and there is much evidence to suggest that Cybele and Asclepius to cure Hieron, the reference is probably to Cybele's powers as a goddess of healing.

The ode begins: 6pEca 7tot~ 6powxL&amp;t K W- X(ot M "trlp y1~dOi 08e v (Xv' iX.vza vcxnirl 7toZtajLtov -r XEi31t' a35&amp;itwv pap13poji6v tE i6Ci' &amp;Xtov n6ot600)1ot S TotyoglVaq aCpplitot Kouopag. (Helen 1301-1307) Once the mountain-dwelling Mother of the Gods rushed on speed- ing feet along the wooded glens and the surging river waters and the deep-roaring waves of the sea in longing for her missing daughter, whose name must not be spoken. Moreover, the final stanza equates Cybele's rites with those of Diony- sus (1358-1365), forging a link between all three deities (Cybele, Demeter, and Dionysus).132 Yet, even if one can in this case surmise real syncretism in cult as well as in myth,'33 one must also insist on 13O Pindar, for example, speaks of "Demeter of the clashing bronze" (XQ.kcoKp6ro1 ... Agadxepo;, Pind. Isthm. 7.3-5), employing an epithet characteristic of Cybele. For the literary sources, and the wider context of fifth- and fourth-century o-voriic o&amp;wt;q, see Obbink (1994). 131 Furley and Bremer (2001) 1.219. 132 In the second strophe Cybele's laughter and return to her orgiastic rites (1349-1352) parallel the laughter of Demeter and her introduction of the Eleusinian kykedn (Honi. Hymn Dem. 202-211). 133 An altar of Demeter and Kore stood next to the Athenian Metroon, while statues of Meter have been found at Eleusis; cf. Roller (1999) 175. For Demeter and Kore as mother goddesses, see Petersmann (1987) 173-186. For Dionysus with Cybele and Demeter at Agrai, see Kannicht (1969) 2.332. lacchus and Dionysus are merged in poetry (Ant. 1146-1152, Bacch. 725-726, Frogs 316 ff.), but not in Eleusinian cult: Graf (1974) 51-58, Sfameni Gasparro (1986) 114-122. In the Helen ode Zeus refers to the Mother of the Gods as Deo (1343). The stasimon is our earliest literary evidence for syncretism of the Eleusinian cult of Demeter and the rites of Cybele, but as Kern (1938) 148 observed, "Schwerlich wire diese Umbiegung der heiligen Legende von Eleusis, wic sie uns die Oiberlieferte Gestalt des sog. homerischen Demeterhymnos zeigt, durch Euripides erfolgt, wenn nicht in Athen der Boden fUr den Synkretismus lingst bereitet gewesen wdire, so daB man an der in eine Me-yXa oi rlp verwandelte Demeter keinen Anstol. mehr nahm."</page><page sequence="33">Religious Syncretism: The New Gods of Greek Tragedy 145 some dramatic point to the remarkable syncretism of the ode, for nei- ther Cybele nor any other new god is ever introduced into tragedy gra- tuitously, but is always related to the wider drama and its themes. So here Helen has been likened to Persephone earlier in the play,134 and the stasimon breaks off its treatment of the Persephone story at the moment Cybele-Demeter laughs and relaxes her anger against the other gods (1352). The underlying narrative of Persephone's return mirrors Helen's hopes that she too may return to her family, winning release from another land of the dead, Egypt. Cybele-Demeter's passage from grief and isolation to prospective happiness bodes well for the escape plan of Helen and Menelaus which is still underway. Yet, one may ask, why introduce Cybele when Demeter would have sufficed, at least for the Persephone paradigm? The answer may lie in the notoriously cor- rupt final stanza, where, despite the textual problems, it is clear that Helen is faulted by the Chorus for having neglected to sacrifice to the Great Mother (Cybele-Demeter): pijvtv 6' riXEI; vyj a; Matp6;, j na i, Ouo(a; o oEpa oau a OE~C;. (Helen 1355-1357) And so you have incurred the wrath of the Great Mother, my child, by not honoring the sacrifices of the goddess. The Chorus end their song by insisting on the power of the goddess' nightlong celebrations, which are syncretized with those of Dionysus (1358-1368). As we saw earlier, Cybele and Dionysus are assimilated in ways that Demeter and Dionysus are not, and Euripides stresses the former connection here since it better suits his new Helen, not a sexy adulteress, but a respectable and chaste woman who might well seek to avoid the nocturnal rites of Cybele.135 Finally, insofar as the Chorus 134 Helen hopes that her paean of grief will reach Persephone in the underworld (175-178), and recalls that she was gathering flowers when abducted by Hermes (244-249; cf. Hornm. Hymn Dem. 6-16). 135 Commentators generally acknowledge the striking syncretism of the stasimon, but few attempt to explain what relevance Helen's failure might have for the rest of the play. Dale (on 1301-1368) calls it a "strange ode" and speaks of the "complete irrelevance " of Helen's actions for the wider drama. Kannicht, by contrast, suggests that Helen should be seen as a "Metapher fir eine bestimmte Mi6glichkeit menschlichen Verhaltens zu den spirituellen Maichten der Orgien und Mysterien" (2.334). The interpretation offered here in terms of Helen's conduct and fate seeks to be less om xro 6pjpaaroq.</page><page sequence="34">146 William Allan perceive Helen's failure to sacrifice as a reason for the goddess' anger against her, their song also reflects the struggle, essential to the play's exploration of divine justice, to explain Helen's misery, innocent though she is, and the daughter of Zeus himself (cf. 1144-1148, n. 28 above). As often in matters of Greek religion, Dionysus stands at the inter- section of many paradoxes, but in the case of his "newness" these paradoxes are especially relevant to our theme. As his presence in the Linear B tablets from Pylos and Chania shows, he is from one perspec- tive as Greek as any other divinity. Yet his status as the epiphanic god par excellence,136 combined with his mystical and ecstatic rites, brought him (of all the Olympians) closest to the new gods, making syncretism between them easier. 37 As H. S. Versnel has shown in his magisterial study of Dionysiac ambiguities, the Dionysus of the Bac- chae reflects contemporary uneasiness concerning new cults and their ecstatic worship.'38 Yet even here, where Euripides exploits to the full the syncretism of Cybele and Dionysus' rites, the effect is not merely to stress the potential destructiveness of the new gods, but to celebrate their raw energy and power. Pentheus may scorn Dionysus as obv vEcoodx &amp;caigova ("this divine arriviste," 219), but his disintegration, both mental and physical, at the hands of the god and his enthusiasts illustrates the necessity of his worship. Most strikingly, the Bacchae exploits the audience's awareness of Dionysus as simultaneously a newcomer and an established god (e.g., 71-72, 201-203, 331), who was integral to their own religion (not to mention the honorand of the dramatic festival itselt). In this way the Bacchae captures perhaps better than any other document of Greek reli- gion the feelings of fifth-century Greeks as they contemplated these non-Olympian and non-epic deities: such powers are new to our polis and its religious and mythological traditions, but their rites are immemorial and demand recognition and respect. This is not to deny the evidence that the new gods were regarded with suspicion by some (or treated as suspicious in order to make a rhetorical point),139 but at 136 For Dionysus as Greek, yet perpetually "der kommende Gott," see Otto (1933) 75-81, Detienne (1986); on divine epiphanies as a distinctive feature of Greek and Roman religion, cf. Lane Fox (1986) 102-167. '137 Cf. Segal (1997) 352. 131 Versnel (1998) 131-205. 139 Cf., e.g., Dem. Or 18.259-260, with n. 68 above.</page><page sequence="35">Religious Syncretism: The New Gods of Greek Tragedy 147 the same time we should beware lest the relative literary and mythical poverty of the new gods leads us to neglect or deny their religious importance. We should take the new gods seriously, not least because the Greeks themselves did, or else they would not have chosen to wor- ship them. So, in conclusion, this discussion has sought some insight into the status and roles of the new gods within the changing divine identities of the Greek pantheon. Tragedy was chosen as the medium since the tragedians are among the most active religious thinkers of Greek soci- ety. As one scholar has stated, "it was no part of a tragic poet's office to introduce religious innovations."140 Yet, by including the new gods in their plays, despite their absence from heroic myth, the tragedians were responding to, and reflecting on, the religious polyphony of their times. The new cults were incorporated within polis religion to differing degrees,141 yet no matter how thoroughly assimilated or domesticated a particular cult became in terms of polis administration or authority, the standing of the new gods within the literary and mythical tradition marked them as different, and it is these differences that we see the dramatists exploiting in various ways. However, as we also noted, the similarities, and the possibilities of syncretism, proved no less intrigu- ing or productive.'42 The tragedians' insight into the syncretistic nature of the new cults (and, by extension, of polytheism itself) shows them to be, along with Herodotus, the most acute historians of (Greek) religious experience. Among the surviving tragedies it is those of Euripides which use syncretism most prominently, as befits that author's particu- larly overt interest in religious phenomena and religious history. Liter- ary syncretism implies the ability to take a detailed and analytical view 14() Lloyd-Jones (1983) 174. 141 Parker (1996) 197 concludes, "the 'foreign gods' were indeed diverse, in nature and in their reception in Athens." 142 The fact that the bulk of references to the new gods in tragedy occur in the songs of the chorus should not surprise us (divine reference tout court being more prominent in the stasima), but it also calls to mind the choruses and songs that honored the new gods in the everyday religious world of audiences throughout Greece: cf., e.g., the Paean to Ascle- pius best preserved from Erythrae 380-360 B.c. (but also found in Athens I st/2nd c. A.D.: Furley and Bremer [2001] 1.211-214, 2.161-167), the Hymn to the Mother of the Gods from Epidaurus 4th/3rd c. B.c. (1.214-224, 2.167-175). To speak of a new god in tragic dialogue would have the effect of an "anachronism." Comedy, set in the here and now, and prone to deal directly with Realien, presents the new gods in dialogue as well as lyric.</page><page sequence="36">148 William Allan of the gods and their qualities, judging which are similar and (could be) related. Yet such conflation in tragedy is not merely a rational, or rationalizing, enterprise (in this respect the tragedians differ from such religious thinkers as, say, Xenophanes). For it is an imaginative and creative endeavor, and unlikely to occur to anyone who is merely inter- ested in performing and preserving ritual. The cult aetiologies that are a part of so many tragedies, particularly those of Euripides, show an interest in religious history (often, significantly, that of Athens itself), but also an awareness that religion is, at least partly, a human construct, as the cults are shown to have a human as well as a divine origin.143 Syncretisms of various kinds were to flourish in the Hellenistic period throughout the Greek world.'44 Yet the survival of Attic tragedy and comedy allows us to focus, from an oblique perspective, on a remarkably innovative period in the history of Greek, and particularly Athenian, religion. As was noted at the outset, how the gods of litera- ture and myth related to the religion practised by people in their every- day lives is one of the most fascinating questions of Greek culture. In every case of tragic syncretism there is a dramatic point to the play's blending of rituals and gods, yet the poets' very decision to include such features tells us much about their audience's shared religious atti- tudes. Finally, as one scholar has said, the Greek gods "are in the last analysis reflections of the conditions of human life."'45 Study of the new gods of tragedy, therefore, may help throw some light on one soci- ety's attempts to articulate and make sense of their world. rtokkax Loplpai ,,v (tl.toviv.146 HARVARD UNIVERSITY 143 Nevertheless, as Schlesier (1986) 46 remarks, "Die G6tter werden bei Euripides von keiner Todes-Diimmerung umnachtet." 144 For Euripides as foreshadowing many aspects of Hellenistic religious thought, see Versnel (1998) 189-205, Krummen (1998) 324.
