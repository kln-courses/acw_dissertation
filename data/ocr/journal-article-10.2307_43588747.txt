XII</page><page sequence="10">PREFACE This third and final volume of the final reports on the excavations at Timnah (Tel Batash) between the years 1977 and 1989 presents the finds from the second millennium BCE (Strata XII-V). This is one of the richest known sequences of stratified finds in the Land of Israel, spanning a period of about 700 years, from the Middle Bronze IIB until the end of Iron Age I. In addition, Chapters XIV-XX consist of specialist reports spanning the entire stratigraphie sequence of the site. The bulk of the Middle Bronze finds came from Area B, while some came from the stratigraphie section in Area A. The Middle Bronze Strata XII-XI are represented by collections of sherds from certain well-defined loci and from the earthen rampart. This is a small collection due to the limited exposure of these strata. The violent destructions of Late Bronze Strata X-VII in Area B yielded rich restorable pottery assemblages as well as additional finds from the 16th-14th centuries BCE. The long process of pottery restoration provided a sequence of large assemblages of complete vessels from these strata, a rare feature in the archaeology of the second millennium BCE in the southern Levant. Stratum VI (the final Late Bronze occupation) was exposed in limited parts of Area B and is the least well known in our sequence. The Iron I Stratum V is represented in Areas A, B, C, D and E; however, since this stratum was not violently destroyed by fire, most of its finds are sherds. For all of these strata, descriptions of the stratigraphy and architecture, together with detailed locus lists, are to be found in Timnah I. The pottery assemblages and the other finds published in this volume have important implications for many issues treated in studies of the second millennium BCE, such as the gradual change in the local material culture during this time range, the transition between the Middle and Late Bronze and between the Late Bronze and Iron I, household organization, settlement ranking and cultural interaction in the Late Bronze, and the relationship of this peripheral town in the northern Shephelah with the great nearby political centers of Gezer (during the Middle and Late Bronze) and Tel Miqne-Ekron (during Iron I). Though the pottery and various artifacts are presented here in detail, the report on the faunai remains is incomplete. The lack of a detailed report on the rich faunai collection from our excavations is particularly regrettable. The little that could be assembled from previously published papers is to be found in Chapter XVI. Many have participated in the preparation of this volume over the years since the end of the excavations in 1989. We thank Linda and George Keim, who enabled the field work. Moshe Fleitman registered many finds during the initial processing of the finds. The pottery processing, registration and discussion were carried out by Nava Panitz-Cohen as part of her Ph.D. dissertation for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Naama Yahalom- Mack prepared for publication and studied many of the non-pottery finds. Other types of finds were discussed by various experts, as detailed in their chapters. The pottery was restored by Ora Mazar, assisted by Linda Keim. Drawings are by Adrian Boas, Sara Halbreich, Carmen Hersch, Shani Kuliner and Rahel Solar. Rahel Solar did most of the graphic work. The photographs were taken by Gabi Laron, Vladimir Naikhin, Zev Radovan and Mariana Salzberger. The data processing was done by Nachum Applbaum and Nava Panitz-Cohen. The volume was edited and produced by Sue Gorodetsky and designed by Noah Lichtinger. We sincerely thank all of the contributors and technical staff for their efforts. The research and technical work needed for this volume was supported by the Muriel and Philip Berman Center for Biblical Archaeology in the Institute of Archaeology, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. An additional generous research grant was donated by the family fund of Mrs. Christine Allen of New York City, The Clarence and Anne Dillon Dun wÃ¶lke Trust. We thank both for their support.

VII (including local VIIA and VIIB) LB IIA 14th (Amarna period) VIII LB IB/IIA Late 15th to early 14th (?) IX LB IB Mid- 15th X LB IA Second half 16th to early 15th XI MB IIB Late 17th to mid-16th (?) XII MB IIB 17th Note that in Timnah /: XIV, Str. IX was dated to the mid- 15th century, as here, but assigned to LB IA. A Note on Periodization and Terminology* Various terms are used for the periodization of the second millennium BCE in the Levant (for a detailed comparative table, see Dever 1992a: 3). For what is termed here the MB IIB there are three major systems, compared in the following table: System A System B System C MB IIC MBm MB IIB MB IIB MB II MB IIA I MB IIA [MB I A: Albright, Wright, Bietak and followers. B: NEAEHL and the present volume. C: Dever and others. In this book we use System B for the MB II, since in our view a clear-cut division between MB IIB (=MB II in System C) and MB IIC (=MB III in System C) is not feasible in the present state of our knowledge. For the period between the end of the Egyptian 12th Dynasty and the beginning of the 18th Dynasty (our MB IIB), the following terminology and dates have been suggested: Source Terminology Dates BCE NEAEHL and MB IIB 1750-1550 Ben-Tor 1992: 2 Mazar 1990: 30 MB IIB-C 1800/1750-1550 Dever 1997: 286 MB III (=MB IIC) 1650-1550/1500 MB II (=MB IIB) 1800/1750-1650 Bietak 2002 MB IIC 1680-1590 MB IIB 1580(?)-1540(?) For the LB we use the division used in NEAEHL , with additional subdivision into LB I A and LB IB. Iron I is divided into Iron IA (the time of the 20th Dynasty) and Iron IB (until ca. 1000/980 BCE). * For the references, see pp. 144-150. XIV</page><page sequence="12">PART ONE THE FINDS OF THE SECOND MILLENNIUM BCE</page><page sequence="13">CHAPTER ONE CONTEXTUAL DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA IN THE PLATES Nava Panitz-Cohen Drawings of the pottery and other finds discussed in this volume are presented in 84 plates. The emphasis is on presenting all the complete vessels and representative sherds from well-defined units belonging to each architectural and stratigraphie horizon (stratum). The plates are arranged chronologically, from the earliest to the latest stratum, according to excavation areas within each stratum, as follows: Stratigraphie Section (Area A): PL 1: MB; Pis. 2-4: Str. IX-V. MB-LB (Str. XII-VI): Area B: Pis. 5-8: Str. XII-XI; Pis. 9-15: Str. X; Pis. 16-20: Str. IX; Pis. 21-37: Str. VIII; Pis. 38-54: Str. VII; Pis. 55-60: Str. VI (including finds from Areas C and J). Iron I (Str. V): Area B: Pis. 61-70; Ãrea C: Pis. 71- 74; Area D: Pis. 75-80; Area E: Pis. 81-84. The presentation of the pottery and other finds in this volume follows the rationale described in Timnah II' 1-2. The most comprehensive assemblages are the restorable vessels from destruction contexts found in the houses of Str. X-VII, while those levels whose exposure was limited (Str. XII and XI) or did not terminate in destruction (Str. VI and V) contain mostly sherds. The latter are arranged according to loci or groups of related loci. Objects other than pottery are presented according to context, accompanied by a detailed typological description in the relevant chapters. Continuing the practice used in Timnah II of accompanying the stratigraphie context of the pottery with a typological overview, the main pottery types are presented in separate typological figures at the beginning of the discussion of each class of pottery (Chapter II.4). These typological figures are organized according to the order in which the types appear in the textual discussion. Accompanying the graphic presentation of each type in these figures is a table summarizing the quantitative data for each type by stratum. Additional tools are an index to the pages of the textual discussion of each pottery type (p. 333) and the index of loci (pp. 331-332), which contains references to the pottery plates (detailed locus lists, with descriptions of the loci, appear in Timnah I). In order to avoid repetition in the list of parallels for each type, a list of accepted dates of the strata at sites mentioned in the pottery parallels (aside from tombs, which are noted in the text itself) appears on pp. 11-12. In the following, the various assemblages presented in the plates are briefly described (for detailed descriptions of the stratigraphy and architecture, see Timnah I). MB-LB-IRON I (STR.

THE RESEARCH METHOD The typological series presented below encompasses the stratigraphie sequence excavated at Tel Batash spanning the period from the end of MB II through Iron I (Str. XII-V). The pottery assemblages of these periods were found principally in Area B, with Iron I being represented also in Areas C, D and E. Since there is both a stratigraphie and typological affinity between these assemblages and the Iron II corpus (Str. IV-II), the series presented below takes into consideration the Iron II typology as published in Timnah //, both in numbering and in typological designations. The method of typological registration and quantitative analysis employed in the study below is the same as that presented in detail in Timnah II: 10-14, though with minor differences in registration categories and without the factor of rim circumference. When we compared the amount of vessels registered using the rim circumference coefficient and that obtained from a direct count, the result was similar enough to warrant our omitting this aspect of the quantitative analysis, especially in light of the generally large amount of restored vessels ( Timnah IL 14, graphs on pp. 25-29). The registration categories used in this volume are as follows: Forms 1 Rim 2 Rim and body 3 Complete profile 4 Complete vessel (restored or intact) 5 Almost complete vessel 6 Base 7 Handle 8 Body 9 Base and body 10 "Spoon" of flask 1 1 Top of stirrup jar 12 Disc base 13 Ring base 14 Rim and handle 15 Body and handle 16 Strainer of jug 17 Basket handle Slip 1 Red 2 White Painted decoration 1 Red 2 Red and black 3 Black 4 Philistine Bichrome 5 Red band on rim 6 Red and white 7 Black and white Burnish 1 Out 2 In 3 In and out The abbreviations used for the pottery types are (in alphabetical order): AM Amphoriskos FN Funnel BL Bowl JG Jug BT Bottle JT Juglet BV Biconical vessel KR Krater CH Chalice LP Lamp CP Cooking pot PT Pithos CS Cup-and-saucer SJ Storage jar CV Closed vessel SP Stirrup jar FL Flask ST Stand GB Goblet 9</page><page sequence="19">CHAPTER TWO Table 1.

The database that served as the basis for the following analysis numbered 2806 vessels and sherds, including local and imported vessels (see Table 1). Of this total, 1 147 appear in the pottery plates and 1659 do not (see Table 2). Of the total of 2806, 2251 are indicative sherds (rims of vessels and sherds, or distinctive body sherds that could be classified typologically); the registration categories counted in this amount are: 1-5, 10, 1 1 , 14, 15. This figure also includes vessels unequivocally identified as to type by body fragments, as follows: BL48 (4 fragments), BL 8 (15), BL 58 (12), BL 59 (3), KR 2 (30); SJ 2* (12), JG 1 (4), and JG 1* (4). This total also includes imports. The variation seen in Table 1 reflects the nature of the different strata, which dictated the presentation of pottery in the plates. Those strata that suffered sudden destruction (Str. X-VII) are represented by more complete vessels than those which were exposed to a limited extent (Str. XII-XI) or were abandoned or simply rebuilt (Str. VI-V) and thus contain Table 2.

Altogether, 318 complete or near-complete vessels (including imports) were recovered, comprising ca. 1 1 % of the entire assemblage. Following is the breakdown of the complete or near-complete vessels by stratum: Str. XII-XI: 3; Str. X: 20; Str. IX: 25; Str. VIE: 144; Str. VII: 90; Str. VI: 15; Str. V: 21. While the rim count is commonly used to represent the quantity of vessels in quantitative ceramic studies (e.g. Orton 1982: 1-11; Rice 1987: 292; Schiffer 1996: 284), it is obvious that each corpus has particular traits that warrant a certain degree of flexibility. Such specific characteristics were identified in the Tel Batash corpus during the typological count, and consequently for certain classes some vessel parts other than rims were counted as well (see above). This approach was especially valid for distinctive decorated types, where the vessel could be identified by a sherd not from the rim. In such cases it was considered legitimate to deviate somewhat from the rim count method and thus to reach a relatively reliable minimum vessel count in each stratum, whether or not it included complete vessels found in a destruction level. The comparative study of this material focused mainly on parallels at sites in the Shephelah and adjacent regions in order to establish the types in their most relevant spatial and temporal setting. Since many of the shapes and decorative patterns in our LB assemblage can be found in other parts of the country as well, comparisons from coastal, northern and Transjordanian sites were consulted mainly to explore possible distribution patterns for particular vessels. For brevity's sake, especially for common types, only a representative selection of parallels is presented in list form. An attempt was made to compare our material to that from excavated strata, though the lack of such assemblages and/or their publication in this region for the Late Bronze Age prompted us also to utilize tomb groups for analogy in some cases. The same geographic distribution for parallels was sought for the Iron I corpus, which enabled us to follow changes and continuity of the pottery from the Late Bronze Age to the early Iron Age on a regional level. The main sites studied for parallels are Aphek, Tell Beit Mirsim, Beth-Shemesh, Tell el-Far'ah (S), Gezer, Tel Harassim, Tell el-Hesi, 'Izbet Sartah, Jericho, Lachish, Tel Miqne and Tel Sippor. Coastal sites include Tell Abu Hawam, Tell el-'Ajjul, Ashdod, Tell Qasile, Tel Michal and Tel Mevorakh. Northern sites include 'Afula, Beth- Shean, Dan, Tell el-Far'ah (N), Hazor, Megiddo, Tel Qashish, Taanach and Yoqne'am. Tomb groups include 4 Akko (Persian Garden), Deir el-Balah, Dominus Flevit, Tell 'Eitun, Jatt, Tel Jedur, Nahlat Ahim and Palmahim. Transjordanian sites include the Baq'ah Valley sites and Tell Deir 'Alia. For a limited number of types, Ugarit and the Uluburun shipwreck were consulted as well. A vexing limitation of the use of parallels, especially for the LB in the south, is the general lack of published sites with secure stratigraphy and well-stratified assemblages. Thus, many of our conclusions concerning regionality and chronology should be viewed with due caution. The following is a brief list (in alphabetical order) of the chronological attributions of the main sites used for the pottery parallels.

FABRIC GROUPS AND PETROGRAPHIC ANALYSIS A. INTRODUCTION The fabrics of the second-millennium pottery assemblages presented below were examined and grouped into broad categories termed "fabric groups" (FG), each designated by a random code letter that has no intrinsic meaning. The method followed is identical to that used for the fabric analysis of the ceramics of the first millennium at Tel Batash, as described in Timnah IL 15-16. This method entails visual inspection of a freshly clipped section with the aid of a magnifying glass and classification of the fabric. Following this, fabric groups with similar visual characteristics were defined and prototypes of each group were subjected to supplementary pÃ©trographie analysis (see below). Only the vessels and sherds illustrated in the plates were subjected to this examination: of the 1147 items, ca. 80% (922) were assigned to fabric groups, though almost 12% (110) of these could not be well defined due to severe burning (defined as FG Q; see Table 4) and were thus omitted from the analysis below. The sample was considered representative. One goal of this generalization was simply to facilitate the description of the pottery and make it less repetitious and tedious. Another goal was to attempt the identification of patterns of change and continuity in the fabric groups on a temporal as well as a typological level. Some of the questions asked are the following. Were some fabrics used specifically for certain types? Did the fabric groups change, and if so to what extent, from stratum to stratum and from the LB to the Iron Age? Are there any foreign or "local" imports (i.e., 12</page><page sequence="22">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V vessels made in Canaan but not close to our region)? What is the relationship between the fabric groups used for Philistine as opposed to Canaanite types in Iron I? Can we discern a difference between the pottery fabrics of the second millennium and those of the first millennium, as analyzed in Timnah /: 16-24? Though answers to these and other questions were not always attainable or clear-cut, the very asking of them served as a thought-provoking guideline in our examination of the ceramic assemblages. The fabric description includes hardness, texture, visible inclusions and color. Though it is known that fabric color is essentially not a consistent criterion for determining fabric type, since it is related to factors such as firing and post-depositional conditions, the color was noted in order to provide a general "baseline" of reference, using the Munsell Soil Color Charts (Shepard 1995: 111-113). The description pertains to the fabric color of the section and the surface. Any perceptible difference between the two was noted. Much of the pottery from Str. VIII and VII was burnt to some degree, thus affecting both color and matrix. Some fabric groups were subdivided, indicating that the fabrics appear to be related in their main characteristics but differ in certain details. Table 3 presents the fabric group designations and definitions, along with a summary of the range of strata in which they appear, as well as the particular vessel or sherd that was used as a fabric group prototype (marked in the plate description with an asterisk, Table 3.

PETROGRAPHIC RESULTS OF SELECTED FABRICS OF THE LATE BRONZE AGE AND IRON AGE I FROM TEL BATASH* Anat Cohen-Weinberger This study presents the pÃ©trographie results of LB and Iron I pottery from Tel Batash. The aims of the pÃ©trographie analysis were to identify the raw materials used, describe their variability, determine the geologic sources of the raw materials, and assess the possible geographic region in which the vessels were manufactured.1 As mentioned above, the present study also aims to compare the pÃ©trographie determinations with the pottery analyst's visual classification of fabric groups (see below). In addition, we attempted to identify differences between the raw material used to produce the Philistine shapes and that of the local Canaanite pottery of Str. V (Iron I). Several pottery kilns with dates ranging from the MB to the Roman period, such as Horvat Zafit,2 Yesodot,3 Tel Malot,4 Tel Miqne-Ekron (Killebrew 1996a, 1998a, 1998b), and KfarMenahem (Ben-Shlomo 2005), have been excavated in the Shephelah and inner coastal plain. Pottery found in some of these kilns has been petrographically examined (Killebrew 1998b; Ben-Shlomo 2005; Cohen- Weinberger unpublished);5 it serves as reference data for local production and * I thank Lydia Grossowicz of the Geological Survey of Israel for the foraminifera determinations. contributes to the differentiation between the various production sites in the same geographic region. All the above sites are located 7-12 km west and southwest of Tel Batash in the outlet of Nahal Sorek and Nahal ha-Elah to the coastal plain. PÃ©trographie study was also conducted on vessels from the potters' workshop in Lachish further to the south (Magrill and Middleton 1997, 2004). The pottery from the kilns at H. Zafit and Yesodot is characterized by loess soil, accompanied by fine sand-sized caliche (known by the local name of nari) fragments and quartz grains. The pottery from the kiln at Tel Malot is characterized by Paleocene marl of the Taqiye Formation, accompanied by fine sand-sized quartz grains. The pottery from the kiln at Kfar Menahem is characterized by loess and terra rossa soils (Ben-Shlomo 2005). The raw material of the pottery from Miqne-Ekron is described by Killebrew as belonging mainly to two fabric groups: Group ME- A, for which no soil type or specific formation was identified, and Group ME-B, which has an aeolian source (loess) and a fluvial source in the vicinity of Tel Miqne-Ekron (Killebrew 1998b: 202-203). Several provenience studies of Iron I Philistine Bichrome vessels have been conducted (Perlman and Asaro 1969; Edelstein and Glass 1973; Gunneweg et al. 1986; Gunneweg et al. 1994; Killebrew 1998b; Gilboa et al. 2006). According to these studies, Philistine Bichrome vessels were made at sites located along the Israeli coast such as Ashdod, as well as at sites in the eastern coastal plain such as Tel Miqne-Ekron. Several Philistine Bichrome sherds from Tell en-Nasbeh, which is located outside the main geographic distribution of this ceramic ware, were shown to be of local origin (Gunneweg et al. 1994: 227). 16</page><page sequence="26">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V Table 7.

The numbers presented in this table should be understood in relation to the total vessels and sherds registered in each stratum in the plates, since these numbers are only part of the total. This partial registration is due to several factors, for example: fabrics too burnt to identify (FG Q), vessels that could not be located to examine, etc. The total sherds and vessels registered and appearing in the plates by stratum (see Table 2) are: Str. XII-XI: 95; Str. X: 120; Str. IX: 77; Str. VIII: 187; Str. VII: 176; Str. VI: 107; Str. V: 395. Thus, it is clear that the amount of vessels and sherds that we were able to classify for fabric groups average about 50% of the total in each stratum aside from Str. V, where 71% of the vessels and sherds were registered for fabric groups. THE GEOLOGIC SETTING An assessment of the geologic setting of the site of Tel Batash and its surrounding area was carried out with the aim of identifying the potential provenience of the raw material. Tel Batash is situated on alluvial beds of Nahal Sorek, which drains the Judean hills and the Shephelah (Buchbinder 1969). The Paleocene Taqiye Formation is exposed north and south of the site, on the flanks of Nahal Sorek, and east of the site, in the vicinity of Beth- Shemesh. The Taqiye Formation is characterized by marl, clay and chalk rocks. South of Tel Batash, chalk and chert rocks of the Eocene Adulam Formation are exposed. This area is also characterized by rendzina and Mediterranean Brown Forest soils with presence of lime (Ravikovitch 1970). Calcareous caliche (nari) crust develops on the chalky rocks of the Shephelah (Buchbinder 1969: 1). East of the site, the Senonian Mishash and Menuhah formations are exposed, characterized by chert and chalk. Further east, hard limestone, dolomite, marl, and clay rocks of Turonian and Cenomanian age are exposed (Sneh et al. 1998). Quaternary hamra soils and kurkar ridges are exposed several kilometers to the west of the site (Buchbinder 1969: 9; Sneh et al. 1998). In the eastern Coastal Plain grumusols soils are exposed. These soils were developed from aeolian, alluvial, or silty clay (Dan et al. 1977: 12, 136). Sediment rich in clay is essential for pottery manufacture. The following potential raw materials are exposed in the vicinity of the site: (1) marl of the Paleocene Taqiye Formation; (2) soils such as rendzina , hamra , alluvial and aeolian soils. Marl or clay of the Moza Formation and the terra rossa soils found somewhat further away are also potentially raw material for pottery manufacture and were widely used in antiquity (Glass et al. 1993: 272, 276; Goren 1995: 301; Goren et al. 1996). RESULTS The analyzed pottery clustered into pÃ©trographie groups A-E according to the characteristics of the raw material: 17</page><page sequence="27">CHAPTER TWO Group Al This is characterized by calcareous marl containing foraminifera and about 5% silty quartz. The foraminifera assemblage within the matrix is of Paleogene age and includes the planktonie genera Morzovella, Subbotina, Acarinina and Planorotalites , and the bentonic genus Cibicides (Photo l:a). Fine, fibrous carbonate crystals that sometimes exhibit weak optical orientation (length fast) are abundant in the matrix. The clay was mixed in some cases with terra rossa soil, which appears as dark mudballs. The non-plastic components comprise about 10% of the field and include mainly well-sorted, fine (300 'im), rounded to subangular quartz grains and some feldspar grains (Photos l:b, 2:b). Some coarser carbonatic rock fragments, such as chalk, which is often oxidized, nari, and limestone (up to 2 mm), and rarely chert and dolomite (up to 1 mm), are also observed. Based on its mineralogical and paleontological affinities, this clay is identified as marl of the Taqiye Formation of the Paleocene age (Bentor 1966: 72-73). The abundant inclusions of quartz grains accompanied by some feldspar grains indicate an aeolian contribution from the coast. The outcrops of the Taqiye Formation in the Shephelah, located a short distance from the coastal sands, are the likely origin of the raw material observed. The same combination of the Taqiye Formation and fine coastal quartz sand was observed in the Amarna Tablets from Gezer (Goren et al. 2004). It is noteworthy that the Taqiye Formation is widely exposed in other areas, including the northern and central Negev, central Sinai, Judean Desert, along the western slopes of the Judean mountains and other regions in Israel. Equivalent beds appear in Egypt (Esna shales) and even in Morocco and Turkey (Bentor 1966: 73). Group A2 This group is similar to Group Al in its clay and non- plastic components. However, the raw material of this group includes highly aeolian silty components (about 10-20% of the paste), comprising mainly quartz but also other silty minerals such as mica and feldspar grains. This raw material is identified as reworked marl of the Taqiye Formation. Group B1 This group is characterized by silty carbonatic clay (Photos l:c, 2:c). The silt is well sorted and contains mainly quartz but also a recognizable quantity of other minerals including hornblende, mica, and feldspars. The non-plastic assemblage comprises about 5-10% of the paste and includes mainly carbonatic rock fragments such as rounded limestone, nari, calcite, and mollusc fragments (Photos l:c, 2:c). Some fine quartz grains appear as well. Based on a bulk of comparative material and published data (e.g., Porat 1987: 112-115; Goren 1996), the matrix is identified as loess soil. Group B2 The clay is similar to Group B1 but the dominant non- plastic components are fine quartz grains (300 p,m), with only a few carbonatic rock fragments (Photo l:d). A local provenience is suggested for the vessels belonging to this group. Group C This group is characterized by fine clay, somewhat calcareous, containing iron oxides. The non-plastic components are homogenous, densely spread, well- sorted, fine sand of idiomorphic, rhomboid dolomite crystals (Photo 1 :e). This pÃ©trographie group is identified as originating from clay of the upper member of the Moza Formation and dolomite sand quarried from the overlaid 'Amminadav Formation. The Moza and 'Amminadav formations are exposed in the Cenomanian section of the Judean Mountains (Bentor 1945). Only two items, both from Str. IX, were made of this clay: a small storage jar decorated in the Bichrome Ware style and a sherd with thick white slip. Group D This group is characterized by ferruginous clay rich in silt-sized quartz grains (Photo 2:e). This pÃ©trographie group is identified as terra rossa soil, which is commonly exposed in Judea, Samaria, and the Galilee Mountains. The parent material is hard limestone, dolomitic limestone, or dolomite. A large amount of aeolian particles from an external source was incorporated into the soil (Wieder and Adan-Bayewitz 2002: 395). Terra rossa soil was extensively used as raw material for pottery in antiquity (e.g., Goren et al. 1996). Only one sherd, a cyma-shaped bowl of Iron I, was identified as being made of this clay. Group E This group is characterized by somewhat silty carbonatic clay with mica laths. The non-plastic components (5- 10% of the paste) comprise rounded limestone and basalt fragments (Photo I:f). The mineralogical assemblage rules out Israel as a possible provenience and suggests 18</page><page sequence="28">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V Photo 1.

Only one vessel, defined as a "Bichrome" jug (JG 3), belongs to this group. The pÃ©trographie results were compared to the fabric groups classified by macroscopic examination (Table 6). Fabric groups A, C, E, G, and I were identified as belonging to pÃ©trographie group Al ; fabric groups B and D were identified as belonging to pÃ©trographie group A2; fabric group H belongs to pÃ©trographie group Bl; and fabric groups F, J, K, LI , L2 and L3 belong to pÃ©trographie group B2. No fabric group name was assigned to three other pÃ©trographie groups (C-E), which appear rarely in the pottery assemblage of the LB-Iron I in Tel Batash. CONCLUSIONS The pÃ©trographie analysis shows that a number of fabric groups can be combined together to one pÃ©trographie group. The classification achieved by macroscopic examination takes into account features such as the color of clay or the existence of a core, which are not necessarily related to the mineralogical assemblage of the raw material and seem to be linked to firing conditions or post-depositional processes. It is noteworthy that the two main pÃ©trographie groups identified in the second- millennium assemblage at Tel Batash contain fine quartz grains as their dominant inclusion, making it virtually impossible in some cases to differentiate between them with the naked eye or even a magnifying glass. The common raw materials used for pottery at Tel Batash in the LB-Iron I are marl of the Taqiye Formation and loess soil. The same raw materials were commonly used for locally made vessels from kilns in other sites of this region. By using the term "loess" I refer to a set of aeolian and alluvial carbonatic silty-clay sediments. Loess soil occurs mainly in the northern Negev and southern Shephelah regions (Rakovitch 1970). However, pÃ©trographie studies of the pottery from the kilns in the inner coastal plain, just west of Tel Batash, such as Yesodot, H. Zafit and Kefar Menahem, show use of clay that cannot be distinguished petrographically from the loess used for vessels made in the northern Negev and southern Shephelah. The carbonatic inclusions accompanying the matrix of pÃ©trographie group Bl, and the relatively fine quartz sand of group B2, point to the Shephelah or inner coastal plain as the possible provenience of this group, while the loess-made vessels in the coastal Negev sites are characterized by coarse quartz grains and other coastal sand-sized grains of accessory minerals, such as hornblende, feldspar, and kurkar fragments (Goren 1996: 54). Thus, the raw material of pÃ©trographie group B ("loess") could have been quarried close to Tel Batash, for instance at one of the inner coastal plain sites such as Tel Miqne (see also pp. 24-26). The Philistine vessels examined are related to both of these two main pÃ©trographie groups, though the loess group is much more common (see further below). It is noteworthy that Philistine Monochrome and Bichrome vessels from Tel Miqne-Ekron were mainly made of Killebrew's pÃ©trographie group ME- A (1998b: 202, 205). Though Killebrew did not identify the raw material of her Group ME-A, she described it as "calcareous clay with moderate amount of well-sorted silt-sized quartz . . .sand-sized quartz temper. . . mudballs and foraminifera also occur in this ware group" (ibid.: 202). According to Killebrew, the Taqiye Formation was not in common use at Tel Miqne-Ekron and was used only for storage jars (ibid.: 205). In light of the discovery that marl of the Taqiye Formation was used for vessel production at Tel Batash (mainly in the LB) and at Tel Malot, and that exposures of this marl are found only 2 km from Tel Miqne-Ekron, the rare use of this clay at Tel Miqne- Ekron is most likely a chronological issue, as most of Killebrew's sample dates from the late 13th century and Iron I. Identification of Killebrew's Group ME-A will aid comparison of the clay of the Philistine Bichrome vessels from these two adjacent sites. In the pÃ©trographie results of the Philistine Bichrome pottery from Tell 'Eitun, Tel Ashdod, Beth-Shemesh, and Tel Sippor as presented by Edelstein and Glass (1973: 126-129), only the non- plastic components are described. Consequently, the raw materials used for Philistine vessels at those sites cannot be compared with those used at Tel Batash. Only one vessel, a jug of Bichrome Ware, was found to have been made overseas, most likely in Cyprus. C. DISCUSSION Several general comments may be made before an attempt is made to analyze the above data. A broad distinction can be made between the appearance of the fabrics found in the LB strata and those found in Iron I. The LB fabrics tend towards reddish-yellow and browner hues, with more gravelly temper, cores and organic material; most are not hard-fired and are rather easily "scratched", mostly with smoothed and wiped surfaces. In contrast, most of the Iron I fabrics are fired to a reddish, light red, or pinkish color, with some buff ware as well; their general "feel" is 21</page><page sequence="31">CHAPTER TWO sandier, both in section and on the surface, and they are harder. They are relatively well levigated and rarely have a core. For a very similar description of the Iron I pottery at Beth-Shemesh, see Ain Shems /: 34. The LB ceramics (with the exception of FG F) are rarely metallic, though some vessels and sherds of other fabric groups are higher fired than others of their group; this trait is noted in Table 3 and in the plate descriptions where applicable. The Iron I ceramics tend to be more metallic, though none are entirely so. Most of the LB fabrics are not particularly well levigated and have numerous inclusions, whether naturally as a part of the clay matrix or added during manufacture; this, however, is a difficult parameter to identify since it depends on numerous variables, such as the type of temper used, the way in which the potter prepared the temper, and, of course, the nature of the clay material itself (Shephard 1995: 117, 161-162).6 The distribution of the fabric groups as presented in the tables above demonstrates several trends and points for discussion: 1. The 15 fabric groups identified by visual examination were consolidated into only four pÃ©trographie groups. This is a rough proportion of fourvisually determined fabric groups to one pÃ©trographie group.7 In addition to this, three other pÃ©trographie groups were identified, but each was represented by only a few vessels or sherds. These data should be taken into account when considering the validity and applicability of our method. Indeed, there was a definite discrepancy between the visual definitions of the fabric group and the pÃ©trographie groups, i.e. sections that looked very different from one another were all made of the same pÃ©trographie fabric; this was especially noted for the various fabric groups belonging to marl of the Taqiye Formation. The opposite situation, fabrics that visually look identical but are petrographically different, exists as well; this was especially noted for FG A (marl of the Taqiye Formation with fine quartz sand) and FG L (loess with fine quartz sand clay). There are a number of possible reasons for this variability, for example that all the fabric groups were indeed made of marl of the Taqiye Formation, but the exact location from which the clay was quarried within its outcropping was decisive in determining the type and size of inclusions. If the clay was gathered from the surface, it might contain more windblown quartz sand or river-borne sand than if it was quarried from deeper down, when it might contain more and larger inclusions, such as terra rossa mudballs. The intentional addition of temper (which, as mentioned above, is an act that is difficult to identify) obviously also affects the appearance of the fired clay. Other influencing factors include firing conditions (reducing, oxidizing), placement in kiln, duration of firing, etc. The possible reasons for a similar-looking final product despite clay variability are also numerous; in our case, the reason that FG A (marl of the Taqiye Formation) and FG L (loess) are so visually similar in their sandy matrix may be related to the large amount of quartz sand that both contain, in FG A possibly as an additive and in FG L most likely naturally. Thus, myriad variables play a role in determining the final appearance of the fired vessels, which may be very different from one another though all are made of the same basic clay source and thus have the same provenience. Having said this, it appears that the division into visually determined fabric groups that are physically different but petrographically similar, or visually similar but petrographically different, reflects the reality of ceramic production from the moment of clay mining until the final product emerges from the kiln. Human cultural as well as natural ecological factors interact in this process (Matson 1965; Arnold 1985). The various fabric groups reflect a diversity of production strategies that is in fact not detectable by thin section analysis, which emphasizes macro-processes. This diversity - an array of micro- choices conducted within the uniform framework of the local ceramic industry - provides, when analyzed together with the vessel typology, a window into the level and organization of production. Ultimately, despite the complexity and pitfalls of the method we employed, we feel that important information is provided by the division into visually determined fabric groups, since they do indeed exist and can be defined by the analyst with relative ease. The supplementary pÃ©trographie analysis adds a crucial dimension that rounds out the technological and regional picture. Since it is impossible to subject the entire assemblage to pÃ©trographie testing, methods must be developed to improve the ability of the analyst to identify the fabric correctly through visual examination and to refine the correlation between the pÃ©trographie group and the fabric group. 2. All but one of the examined samples are local, with two basic clay types identified: marl of the Taqiye Formation (pÃ©trographie groups Al and A2) and loess (pÃ©trographie groups B 1 and B2). The majority of the fabrics common in the MB and LB strata (XII-VI) belong to the former, while the Iron I fabrics clearly tend toward the latter 22</page><page sequence="32">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V (see Tables 6 and 7). The proportions remain relatively consistent throughout Str. XII-VII, with an average of 93% of all fabrics belonging to marl of the Taqiye Formation. In Str. VI, this changes notably, with a drop to 57% belonging to marl of the Taqiye Formation and 43% to loess. In Str. V, the proportion is totally reversed, with 90% made of loess (see also No. 3 below). These data show that the industry in both periods was not monolithic and though there was indeed a majority source for each period, vessels were produced of the other clays as well, though in much smaller amounts. Since marl of the Taqiye Formation suggests a more eastern production source (Batash itself, Beth-Shemesh, Gezer) and loess a more western and southern source (Batash itself, Tel Miqne, Ashdod), this is meaningful for our interpretation of each period. 3. The MB strata (XII-XI) have the smallest number of fabric groups (five), while each of the LB strata X-VII have an average of seven fabric groups. However, in each stratum there were two dominant fabric groups, while the rest were represented by considerably fewer examples. Str. XII-XI and Str. X show an identical distribution of their two main fabric groups (FG A and B; see Table 7), while the other LB strata have different distributions of the dominant fabric groups: FG D and E in Str. IX, FG C and D in Str. VIII, FG A and D in Str. VII, and FG D and K in Str. VI. This points to a higher degree of similarity between the final MB phase (Str. XII-XI) and the stratum that we define as transitional MB-LB (Str. X) than between the subsequent LB strata. Notably, throughout the LB strata FG D is one of the dominant fabric groups. FG B virtually disappears after Str. X. FG C is almost exclusively used in Str. VIII-VII. Str. VI, the final LB occupation, shows a certain shift; of its two dominant fabric groups, one is common in all the LB strata (FG D, marl of the Taqiye Formation), while the other fabric is one that becomes common in Iron I (FG K, loess); FG I is another Iron I fabric that first appears in Str. VI.8 This might be indicative of a transitional condition of pottery production at this time; such a conclusion is partially supported by the typological analysis. A marked change took place in the Iron I Str. V; though it has a total of five fabric groups, only one basic group (all subtypes of FG L) was dominant. This points to relative stability in the choice of clay during the MB-LB strata, with a marked change occurring in Str. VI. Continuity between Str. VI and V is minimal. To summarize the above data, it may be said that while the industry was not monolithic and vessels were produced from other clay types as well, there was indeed a majority source for each period. Marl of the Taqiye Formation suggests a more eastern/northern production source (such as Beth-Shemesh and Gezer) in addition to Batash itself, and loess a more western/southern source (such as Tel Miqne) in addition to Batash. This is meaningful for the interpretation of each period. Another discernible feature is that in the LB there was more diversity in fabric recipes, suggesting a number of production venues, techniques and modes. On the other hand, the Iron I ceramics display only one basic fabric recipe (with three subtypes), suggesting a more centralized production. 4. Two vessels in Str. IX were made of Moza-4 Amminadav clay (pÃ©trographie group C). It appears that this clay was not used for any other vessels during the entire period under discussion (at least among those that were visually examined and/or subjected to pÃ©trographie analysis), though it became a commonly used fabric at Tel Batash in Iron II (see below, No. 9). One of the vessels made of this clay was a small painted storage jar in the Bichrome Ware tradition (PI. 19:2). The fact that such a jar may have been produced in the region of the Judean hills is somewhat incompatible with what we know about the distribution of this ceramic group (see p. 127). Moza- ' Amminadav clay has been identified in vessels from several MB-LB burials in the vicinity of Jerusalem, as well as in el-Amarna tablets sent from Jerusalem and Shechem (Goren et al. 2004: 263-269). 5. PÃ©trographie group D, defined as terra rossa clay, consists of only one Iron I vessel. PI. 83:16 is a fine example of a cyma-shaped bowl painted with red concentric circles. Since almost all the other bowls of this type (BL 59) were made of the typical fabric groups of Str. V (FG Ll-3 and K; see Table 14), this example is a complete anomaly and is apparently an import from the area of the Judean hills to Tel Batash. Though non-existent in the Bronze Age ceramics at our site, and extremely limited in Iron I, terra rossa clay was a common fabric in the Iron II assemblage at Tel Batash, used almost exclusively for the production of the ubiquitous LMLK jars ( Timnah /: 18-19). 6. PÃ©trographie group E too was defined for a single vessel: a Str. X jug (JG 3; PI. 14: 1) that was typologically ascribed to Bichrome Ware of the transitional MB-LB period. This was the only vessel examined that was imported from abroad (except, of course, for the Cypriot 23</page><page sequence="33">CHAPTER TWO imports discussed in Chapter III). The source was most likely Cyprus. 7. Perusal of Tables 8-14, which detail the distribution of the various fabric groups by vessel class and stratum, illuminates certain trends. Generally speaking, there is a rather widely dispersed distribution of fabric groups in all classes, and no particular correlation between fabric type and vessel class could be discerned. Of course, absolute vessel numbers must be considered when analyzing these results; since the bowls and storage jars are the most numerous vessel classes in almost all strata (see Table l)and thus a larger sample was examined, more fabric groups were identified for each of them than for most other categories. Despite this limitation, we may point out certain trends: In Str. XII-XI there was a definite preference for FG A in bowls and FG B in storage jars. FG A is a much better levigated fabric, while FG B contains numerous inclusions (see Table 3); this may have been a guiding factor in the choice (or preparation) of the clay for each class. Three of the five pithoi examined in Str. X were made of FG B as well. FG B virtually ceases after Str. X. Table 8. Distribution of fabric groups by pottery class: Str. XII-XI.

VIII, there was a preference for FG C for bowls and FG D for storage jars. The painted jars of Type S J 2c are generally made of FG E, and less frequently of FG D. While both fabrics were commonly used for other vessel types, and thus no fabric type was used exclusively for the painted jars, this specificity implies a deliberate selection (for a similar observation, see Hazor /: 121). The choice of FG E may be due to its being a better levigated clay mix, which would be suitable for painting. Several cooking pots were made of fabrics that differ from the most common cooking-pot fabric (P3): four in Str. X made of FG B, one in Str. VIII made of FG B, and one in Str. VI made of FG D. 8. By far the most dominant fabric group used for the Philistine pottery in Str. V is FG LI- 3; FG K and I are also used, though in much smaller quantities.9 The 24</page><page sequence="34">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V Table 12.

This clearly shows that the same fabrics were used for the quintessential Canaanite and Philistine types. The prevailing fabric for all Philistine types was FG LI , along with L2 and L3, while FG LI was dominant for the non- Philistine types as well (and L2-3 much less so). FG K was used in almost equal proportions for Canaanite and Philistine types alike. A similar situation was noted at Beth-Shemesh, where it was stated that "... Philistine influence can be seen not only in the typical painted pottery but also in many of the undecorated vessels, the paste of which is as well cleaned and as well baked as that of the former which it closely resembles" (Am Shems V : 25</page><page sequence="35">CHAPTER TWO 127). The same situation was found at Tell Qasile, where NAAhas shown that Philistine and non-Philistine shapes were made of the same local clay ( Qasile II: 111-114). At Gezer too, NAA produced similar results, implying that both types were made locally at Gezer (Hughes and Smith 1986: 273-274). At Tel Miqne, although it is somewhat difficult to correlate the pÃ©trographie results reported by Killebrew (1998b: 202-205) with ours, it appears that there is much overlap in fabrics between the Myc. IIIC: 1 and Philistine Bichrome vessels and those of local Canaanite shape. This situation is telling, with implications for the relationship between the Philistine and Canaanite pottery industries at this time. 9. Comparison of the results of the pÃ©trographie analysis of the Bronze Age and Iron I ceramics with those obtained for the Iron II fabrics ( Timnah /: 16-24) reveals major differences between the ceramic industries (Table 16). The main clay source used for the Bronze Age ceramics of Tel Batash (marl of the Taqiye Formation) was not used at all in the production of the first-millennium ceramics. This represents a total break in production practices between the two periods. The main clay source used in the Iron I Str. V (loess with fine quartz sand) is still in use in Iron II, mainly in Str. IV (10th century) and becomes rare in Str. III (8th century) and virtually non-existent in Str. II (7th century); in these strata, especially Str. III-II, the main fabric is hamra of coastal origin.10 This clay source was not used at all for the MB, LB or Iron I pottery at Tel Batash. Thus, there is a total difference between the Bronze Age and Iron II industries as far as clay sources are concerned, while the main Iron I clay source continues to be used in Iron II, mainly in the first half of that period. These results have implications for the geopolitical, economic, and (possibly) ethnic orientation of Tel Batash during these periods. The sources of marl of the Taqiye Formation point to a provenience from the vicinity of Beth-Shemesh westward to Tel Miqne. The loess points to sources in the southern Shephelah or northwestern Negev (including southern coastal sites such as Gaza and Ashkelon), while hamra clay comes mainly from the coastal region, from Ashdod northward. Terra rossa and Moza-4 Amminadav clay focus attention eastward to the inner Shephelah and Judean hills. Table 15. Distribution of fabric groups in Str.

TYPOLOGICAL AND COMPARATIVE DISCUSSION BOWLS (Fig. 1; Table 17) OPEN ROUNDED BOWLS MB Open Rounded Bowls: BL 44, 45, 47 The pottery found in MB contexts includes sherds from the "Citadel" in Area B {Jimnah I: 39-41) as well as various sherds from the rampart exposed in Areas A and B {Jimnah /: 35-38). Though these were allocated typological designations and quantitative registration was carried out, the fragmentary nature of the material and the limited sample collected preclude any meaningful conclusions. These typological designations were made as part of the general LB-Iron Age type series in order to trace ceramic continuity and change from the MB to the LB (for a similar conception, see Qashish : 277-318). BL 44: Small, delicate open rounded bowl Str. XII-XI: PI. 5:1 Str. XI: Pl. 6:1, 11? Str. X: Pl. 15:1-2 These are five rim sherds of a small, rather delicate bowl type whose diameter does not exceed 17 cm. The rim is either plain or slightly molded (e.g. Pis. 6:11; 15:1). PI. 15:2 has a small coil handle and three sherds have a red band painted on the rim. These can be compared to several bowls from Beth-Shean, all dated to the final phases of MB II (Maeir 1997: 90-92; e.g. Bowl Type la: PI. 1:1-3, Str. R5-3; Bowl Type 3d; PI. 3:1, Str. R3-R4). BL 45: Straight- walled bowl with hammerhead rim Str. XI: Pl. 6:14-15 These two bowls are represented by sherds of rim and body; the only preserved diameter is ca. 25 cm. Both are very similar, though the different rim profiles and fabrics show that they are not part of the same vessel. The rim is a small hammerhead and the walls are almost vertical. Under the rim exterior is an incised design consisting of a horizontal line, above which are vertical hatches. Such a design is known from various MB II vessels (Aphek /: Fig. 10. 1 .21 , Str. AXV). A few such rims appear on both open rounded and carinated bowls from Beth-Shean, generally larger than ours, all deriving from late MB II strata (e.g. Maeir 1997: PI. 3:11-12, 15). BL 47: Open rounded bowl with molded rim Str. XII: Pl. 5:11 Str. XI: Pl. 6:4-7, 10?, 12?, 13? Str. XII-XI: Pl. 5:2 Str. X: Pl. 9:4, 6 Str. IX: Pl. 16:6 BL 47 should be considered together with the ubiquitous plain open bowls that are so typical of the MB and LB (see BL 50 and BL 53 below). This bowl type is differentiated by its somewhat more delicate and symmetrical fabrication, as well as the treated rim, which generally has a beveled or slightly thickened top, horizontal, inverted or everted. This feature is found on such bowls mainly in Str. XII-XI (11 examples), continuing in smaller numbers into Str. X and IX (6 and 4 respectively). BL 47 ranges in diameter from 20 to 28 cm. PI. 6:12-13 are larger and have a slightly more inturned stance. Since no complete profile is preserved, the base types are unknown; however, it seems that ring and disc bases found in the same loci belonged to these bowls. Several bowls have red bands painted on the rim, while the one published example from Str. IX (Pl. 16:6) is red slipped and burnished. The treated rim that sets these bowls apart from their plain-rim counterparts (BL 50a-b, below) is an identifying characteristic of the so-called open or platter bowls in MB IIA {Aphek /: 194) and continues to be common in late MB II assemblages, with few chronological or regional distinctions (Amiran 1969: 91, 124-125; Cole 1984: 41- 42; Ilan 1996: 213; Maeir 1997: 90).11 As we progress from late MB II to LB I, the molded rim is increasingly replaced by the plain rim on open bowls (our BL 50, below) (Maeir 1997: 91); this accords with our quantitative data, as there are half as many such bowls in Str. X as in Str. XII-XI. The very presence of BL 47 in Str. X (6% of the bowls) is characteristic of the transitional nature of this stratum (see pp. 123-126).

They continue throughout the LB and into Iron I (see BL 50c-d below), with differences over time related mainly to proportions, size, fabric type, and rarely decoration, as detailed below. The longevity of this type is certainly due to its simple utilitarian shape and manufacture. The solidity of these bowls should be noted; they were apparently manufactured to resist breakage.

This durability may be one of the factors behind the conservativism of this bowl shape. No "fine ware" or delicate bowls of this shape were found at Tel Batash (Mullins 2002: 175). Many of these bowls have prominent smoothing lines, often accompanied by concentric "scrape" lines on the lower exterior.12 Because of these marks, it is difficult to determine whether these bowls were made by hand or on the wheel, or perhaps a combination of both (Rice 1987: 124; Killebrew 1998b: 246-247, 399). Concentric lines etched into the bottom of some of the disc bases attest to the use of a turning device, perhaps in combination with other secondary formation techniques, such as trimming. The general homogeneity and rather careless quality of many of these bowls suggests a relatively routine mode of manufacture, though it is difficult to determine the level of production; while the bowls are of a uniform make and fall into two basic size 30</page><page sequence="40">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V categories (BL 50a and 50b), they display a modicum of diversity that suggests individual workshops rather than industrial manufacture (Mullins 2002: 281). This diversity may also be related to different uses of these bowls, such as varying cuisine or the age/gender of those eating from them. In a number of cases these bowls are distorted, apparently as a result of careless manufacture, whether due to poor clay preparation, an uneven drying process, improper removal from the fabrication bat, or the manner of stacking in the kiln (Rice 1987: 67-70, 155-156, 161-162; Arnold 1985: 29-30). In any event, they were fired and used despite these "mishaps". Most of these bowls are undecorated, with the exception of a rare red band painted on the rim or red slip (e.g. PL 16: 12). Most of these bowls have disc bases, often concave, while low ring bases are less common. Almost none have flat bases. While a general tendency from ring to disc base as time progressed is noted at our site, it is not a dominant feature (Shiloh: 93; Megiddo III : 192). The base is generally well proportioned in relation to the body, with wider bowls having wider bases and deeper bowls having narrower bases. Thus, despite the simple, heavy and utilitarian nature, and the often rather careless finish, of this type of bowl, it has a pleasing effect and shows a skill of manufacture that accompanies the standardization of the type (Rice 1984a: 47^48; Longacre 1999). BL 50a-b must be considered together with BL 53, described below. As such, the open rounded bowl comprises the most common bowl, far outnumbering the carinated bowls. At Tel Batash, as at other sites, bowls with the proportions of our BL 50a and 50b coexist throughout all phases of the LB, though there is a general tendency over time for bowls to become deeper and smaller (Mullins 2002: 178; Zuckerman 2003: 113). In Str. V of Iron I, the wider, shallower bowls virtually disappear and the smaller, deeper BL 50c is found exclusively (see pp. 36-37). A number of factors could have prompted this change, such as (among others) a change in raw material, technology or function, fluctuating family size or composition, outside influence, or market demands. Despite the ubiquity of this shape throughout the country, certain regional differences can be discerned. In the north the bowls often tend to have straighter sides and more decoration (e.g. concentric red circles inside at Hazor and Dan). Sites with Egyptian influence tend to have more flat bases than ring or disc bases (e.g. Beth- Shean). As mentioned above, these variations seem to point to local regional production lines that on one hand produced a large amount of similar functional vessels, but on the other hand left room for individual diversity. PÃ©trographie analysis showing that most bowls were locally produced supports this conclusion (Mullins 2002: 278-288; pp. 16-21 above). BL 50a: Large open rounded bowl (Photo 3) Str. X: Pl. 9:1 Str.

V: Pis. 61:3; 69:7 Though this bowl is similar to BL 50a in general concept, it differs in size and proportions: the average diameter is 17 cm and the average proportions are 1:2.5, making it smaller and deeper. Some of the examples included with this subtype (e.g. Pl. 21:4) are borderline with BL 50a; the cut-off point of 22 cm diameter is used to distinguish between the two. This subtype first appears in Str. X, in which it comprises only 3% of the bowls. It appears in almost consistentquantitiesinStr.IX-VI(10%, 8%, ll%and 12% of the bowls in each stratum respectively). As mentioned above, it coexists with the wider and shallower BL 50a in Str. X-VII, though it becomes more frequent in the later strata. Like the latter, this bowl can be found in tomb and settlement settings throughout the entire country, with minor regional variations in wall stance, base type and decoration. Bowls with these proportions are very common in Beth-Shemesh Str. IV, especially the end of this period (Ain Shems V : 123). A number of these bowls had holes about 2 cm in diameter bored through the thick base after firing, suggesting that they were in secondary use as funnels.

V: Pis. 61:5, 7-8; 67:7?; 72:10 These bowls are essentially similar to BL 50a-b in details of manufacture, general shape and proportions, but are characterized by a thickened inner rim, which varies from short and bulbous (PL 20:5) to long and flat (Pl. 38:8). The rim treatment of BL 53 was probably originally intended to reinforce the bowl, but eventually crystallized into a stylistic feature. This feature is one of the most long-lived in the Canaanite ceramic assemblage, continuing virtually unchanged from MB II to early Iron I (Ain Shems V : 123; Maeir 1997: Bowl Type 3f, Pl. 3:7; TBM I: 23; Lachish IV: 180-181; Zuckerman 2003: 116-118).13 It seems that the rim thickening was formed by one of three methods. 1) When the bowl's walls were drawn up, the clay left at the rim top was folded over to the inside. 2) When the walls were drawn up, the potter pulled up an addendum near the inside rim, which was then molded and trimmed. This trimming is sometimes seen as a groove emphasizing the lower rim exterior, where the thickening joins with the body; this groove is sometimes uneven, suggesting a slow and interrupted turn of the bowl or an unpracticed hand. 3) A third method, noteworthy on bowls with an everted rim exterior, was simply to push in slightly under the rim exterior as the bowl turned, thus creating a bulge in the rim interior. In this case, there is no groove or differentiation between the body and rim interior, but the inner thickening effect is the same. The rim exterior of these bowls is either straight or everted, though this differentiation is not extreme. The straight rim exterior bowls are designated BL 53a, while those with an everted rim exterior are designated BL 53b. These two subdivisions are further divided into size categories: bowls whose rim is up to 25 cm in diameter (1) and bowls larger than this (2); the largest bowls in the latter category did not exceed 32 cm. Thus, the typological designation included both the exterior rim stance and a size criterion, creating the four subtypes detailed above. This division was made to attempt to trace any significant patterns based on these morphological variations (see Table 18 and below). Disc bases, sometimes convex, are most common. A few bowls have ring bases, sometimes with a concave center. Pl. 9: 1 1-12 are very large bowls that are included in this subtype despite the difference in their stance and size. These bowls, like BL 50a-b, are sometimes distorted. These bowls are rarely decorated; the rim interiors are occasionally painted with a red band, a trait that becomes more common in Str. VI, in which ca. 10% of these bowls have such treatment. This decoration is most common on bowl rims of the late 13th and early 12th centuries at Gezer ( Gezer IV: 58). Pl. 20:5 is red slipped and burnished. One bowl (BL 53b 1 , Pl. 52:4, Str. VE) has a red cross painted inside. One (BL 53a2, Pl. 5:4, Str. XII) had one extant handle extending from the rim; originally there were most likely two handles, on analogy to bowls of this type that are contemporary with our PL 5:4 (e.g. Lachish IV: Pl. 69:579-580, Tombs 129 and 1552) and later as well (e.g. Lachish II: Pis. XXXIX:67-68; XLII: 135; attributed to Fosse Temples I- III). Summarizing the subtype division (Table 18), the general trend is a consistently more frequent appearance of the straight rim exterior (BL 53a) from Str. XII-XI until Str. VII, while in Str. VI the everted rim (BL 53b) dominates. In all strata from X to VI, the large bowls dominate, except for Str. VIII, in which there is an almost equal amount of small to medium and large sizes. These bowls are made of the entire gamut of fabrics used in the LB at Tel Batash, though about 15% of the Str. VI examples are made of a fabric that becomes common in Str. V (FG K). Though we have defined this type as "LB", it continues in small amounts in Str. V, in which all four subtypes together represent no more than 9% of the bowls. All are rather small rim sherds, some of which appear to be intrusive, thus casting doubt on whether this is a valid Iron I type at Tel Batash. The continuation of such a rim treatment into the early Iron I at other sites is also very limited. At Tell Beit Mirsim, a few rim sherds can be found in transitional LB-Iron I contexts, such as Silos 3 and 6 (Greenberg 1987: Fig. 4:15), but this type of rim treatment virtually disappears at that site after Str. C (TBM I: 39; Greenberg 1987: 63). Note also several bowl sherds from Gezer Str. XIV-XIII (Gezer II: Pl. 26:12-13, 24, Str. XIV; Gezer IV: Pl. 17:21, Str. XIII).

This is the most common bowl rim type in Str. III at 'Izbet Sartah, but virtually disappears after this {'Izbet Sartah : 47). These contexts are all dated to the early part of Iron I and this rim type apparently died out in the course of the late 12th/first half of the 11th centuries. It seems that in the north this type did not continue into Iron I in any substantial amount, as very few parallels could be found in these contexts (e.g. Taanach : Fig. 8:9, Period la). Though these bowls are common throughout the country during the LB, it seems that there are minor regional distinctions. The everted rim type (our BL 53b) is not found in the north (Mullins 2002: 313) and it seems that in general BL 53 is somewhat less common at northern sites (e.g. at Hazor, where it is ca. 10% of the LB bowls: Zuckerman 2003: 116).

A large open bowl with a diameter range of 30-50 cm. The sides are straight or very slightly rounded and the rim top is rounded. A fairly prominent ridge is found below the rim exterior. Some of these bowls have conspicuous coils on their bodies; they are thick walled and heavy. The bowl shown in PI. 17:1 was subjected to pÃ©trographie analysis and found to be of local manufacture. Though they were not analyzed, all the other examples of this bowl type appear from their fabric to be local products as well. This bowl is considered an Egyptian-style type and parallels may be cited from various 19th and 20th Dynasty sites in Egypt, including el-Amarna, Deir el-Medineh and the Semna Fort (Aston 1998: 165, 255, Nos. 829-836; Killebrew 1998b: 148, Type EG6; Mullins 2002: 173), as well as contemporary contexts in Canaan such as Lachish ( Lachish II: PI. XXXVIII:55- 56, attributed to Fosse Temple III); Gezer ( Gezer IV: PI. 18:21, mixed context); Aphek Str. X12 (Gadot 2003: Pl. V.31:14); Tel Sera4 Str. IX (Yannai 1996: 276, n. 52); Tell el-4 Ajjul {Ancient Gaza II: Pl. XXVIL27, 7u). However, comparisons that would be contemporary with our bowls, predating the 19th Dynasty, are rare; they include a few such bowls at Beth-Shean Str. Rib (Mullins 2002: 173, PI. 44:14-16; Bowl Type 4a); Tel Miqne Str. X (Killebrew 1996b: PI. 2:4);14 Megiddo C Megiddo III: 210; Fig. 9.10:26, Str. F-9=Str. VIII); Aphek Str. X14 (Gadot 2003: PL V.6:9); and Hazor (Hazor III-IV: Pis. CLVIL29-30, Str. XV; CCLXII.24, Str. 2). None of the bowls of this type at Batash had the cord impressions that may be found on a fair amount of these bowls; this type of decoration on open shapes is considered an Egyptian-inspired practice at this time (Mullins 2002: 172-173). This is the only ceramic form of possible Egyptian affinity that was found and it is very infrequent, with a total of ten examples coming from Str. X to VII (six were found in the latter). It is curious that, of all the Egyptian shapes that were either imported or locally produced in LB Canaan, this is the only one to have reached Tel Batash. Its simple utilitarian shape does not imply any particular function, though in view of its heaviness and straight open stance we may assume that some kind of food preparation like grinding took place in it. This raises the question of why this particular bowl shape appears at the site in such small quantities in the 15th-14th centuries. On the basis of the meager appearance of this bowl we certainly cannot claim the presence of Egyptians, and this is not a luxury item. It is possible that Egyptian-style food preparation requiring such a vessel took place on a very limited scale in the patrician houses. Alternatively, the shape may have entered the household in small amounts without being used for its original "Egyptian" function. BL 60: Open rounded bowl with small hammerhead rim Str. VI: Pl. 55:9-10 Str. VIA: Pl. 58:21 Three rim and upper body sherds that appear to belong to an open rounded bowl. All three are decorated, with a red band on the rim (PI. 55:9), a bichrome decoration outside (PI. 55: 10) or red slip (PL 58:21). The fragmentary nature of these sherds precludes a clear definition of this type; it may be a rim variation of BL 53. Though they are also rather small sherds, a comparison may be made to several bowls found in Iron I silos at Tell Beit Mirsim (Greenberg 1987: Figs. 7:3, Silo 6, Str. Bl; 8:8, Silo 16, Str. B1-B2; 9:11, Silo 1, Str. B2). Another possible comparison is a rounded bowl sherd with a small hammerhead rim decorated with a red band (Ashdod V: Fig. 33:17, Str. XII).

This Iron I bowl type belongs generally to the group of open rounded bowls of simple heavy manufacture and with plain rim (see BL 50a-b above). However, its somewhat more incurving stance, smaller size and deeper proportions set it apart. Its diameter ranges from 10 to 15 cm and its average proportions are 1:2. Note that some of the examples (e.g. PL 69: 10) are difficult to assign decisively to either BL 50b or 50c based on rim diameter alone, since the size is borderline. Obviously, the criteria we have chosen for the division between the subtypes is subjective and should not be considered a parameter that guided the manufacture (or use) of these vessels; there is a similar subjective division between BL 50a and 50b. The rim is generally plain, either round-topped or tapering. However, a number of bowls included in this type have a slightly molded or thickened rim interior (Pis. 67:2, 69:2, 79:8, 82:8,11; 69: 1 1 ; 70:2 are smaller and have a red band on their rim). These have parallels in Gezer Str. XII-XI, most with a red band on the rim (Gezer I: Pl. 27:15; Gezer IV : Pis. 28:4; 39:13), as well as in Ashdod Str. Xlllb ( Ashdod V : Fig. 14:1-7). Bowls of similar shape and size with this particular rim treatment are common in Tel Miqne Str. V.15 Most of the preserved bases of BL 50c are narrow ring bases, though there is one disc base. Thus, though the regularity of shape and size of these bowls point to their having been mass-produced, differing details of manufacture in the rims and bases suggest that production was not entirely routine. As noted with the earlier open rounded bowls, this possibly reflects different, though concurrent, levels of production, both domestic and workshop (van der Leeuw 1976; Wood 1990; Killebrew 1998b: 254-255). Of the 13 bowls whose fabrics were registered, four different fabric groups were discerned. Three of these are subtypes of the same fabric group (FG L), which is the dominant fabric in most of the Philistine vessel shapes. A few sherds of this bowl type were found in Str. VI (7 examples, 8% of the bowls in Str. VI), though none are represented in the plates. While parallels show that such smaller, deeper proportions and incurving profiles do already occur in LB IIB (e.g. Lachish II : Pl. 42: 143- 146, Fosse Temple III; TBMI: Pl. 43:13-14, Str. C; Tell Jedur tomb, Ben-Arieh 1981: Fig. 16-7; Ashdod V: Fig. 1 1 :7-8, Str. XIV), this is not very common. At Gezer, this bowl type first appears in Str. XIV but becomes the most frequent bowl type in Iron I ( Gezer IV: 57). Indeed, this type doubles in our Str. V (15%), in which it vies with BL 59 (see below) as the second most common bowl. It can be equated with Tell Qasile Bowl Type 1, the most common bowl at that site ( Qasile II : 33). Such bowls begin at the end of LB and become common in the early Iron I levels at Tel Miqne as well (Killebrew 1998b: 89); Killebrew claims that these bowls are less dominant in the north at this time. At Hazor, only a few such bowls were found in the pits of Str. XII; these are generally larger than our BL 50c (Ben- Ami 2001: 160). At 'Izbet Sartah, incurving round-sided bowls are designated BL 5 (undecorated, common in Str. III-II) and BL 8 (red- slipped and burnished, common in Str. I) ( ' Izbet Sartah : 54-56, 60); however, these are generally of somewhat wider diameter and shallower proportions than our BL 50c and might represent a local variant. It is noteworthy that the comparanda from the Str. VI layer in the western section at Lachish (Yannai 1996: Pl. 18:1-7) do not include bowls as small and deep as our BL 50c.16 Selected parallels Beth-Shemesh: Ain Shems IV: Pis.

This shape, though rare, is found in LB II contexts; see, for example, a bowl from Lachish Tomb 1003 dated to LB IIA ( Lachish IV: Pl. 70:606) and a possible analogy from Beth-Shemesh IV (Ain Shems IV: Pl. LVIII: 14). However, this is more the exception than the rule at that time; the deep proportions are more at home in Iron I (e.g. Qasile II: 38, Bowl Type 4, Fig. 11:12, Str. XII; 'hbet Sartah: Fig. 20:1, Str. I). BL 51: Iron I open rounded bowl with red concentric circles Str. V: Pis. 71:1; 75:2-3, 20; 78:1-2, 3?; 83:12 Post-Str. V pit: Pl. 70:1 A medium-sized to large round-sided thick-walled bowl with a slightly incurving rim or upper stance. Its diameter ranges from 18.5 to 25 cm and its proportions average ca. 1:2.5. The plain rim top is round or tapering. The only preserved base is a ring base. Though only nine examples of this bowl were registered, it is possible that some body sherds registered as BL 58, which also bear red painted concentric circles, belong to BL 51. Indeed, BL 5 1 has a typological affinity with BL 58 (see below), which is similar but has a softly carinated and shallower stance. The size and proportions of this bowl are reminiscent of the LB open rounded bowl (BL 50a-b), which is virtually non-existent in the Iron I Str. V, having been replaced by a smaller and deeper version (BL 50c). The additional feature that distinguishes this type is the interior decoration with thin red bands that form concentric circles, usually in groups of three or four and beginning as a spiral in the bowl's interior (Pl. 75:2 has very faint traces of red paint that do not appear in the drawing). In some cases, the red paint is applied over a thin unburnished whitish or buff slip; this slip is reminiscent of the white slip found on the Philistine Bichrome vessels (see BL 8, KR 2, JG 6 below). The origin of the decoration of BL 58 is not clear. Concentric painted circles, generally formed by rather wide bands (bichrome or monochrome), do appear inside bowls during the LB (Amiran 1969: 125; Qasile II: 83; Beit Arieh 1981: Fig. 2:1, 3; Zuckerman 2003: 127; Beck and Kochavi 1985: Fig. 2:7), and red monochrome decoration appears to become especially common in the south in the late 13th century ( Gezer IV: 57, n. 100). 17 However, in all of our LB strata the interiors of bowls are very rarely painted. Thus, the appearance of red painted concentric circles inside bowls in Iron I is essentially an innovation at Tel Batash and would seem to derive mainly from Philistine influence. Both concentric circles and spirals are painted on the interior of bowls in the local Mycenaean UIC18 assemblages; in fact, linear decoration, though found throughout the sequence, is considered a hallmark of the earliest phase of production of this ware (Dothan and Zukerman 2004: 36). Moreover, though they are more commonly painted outside, concentric circles occur in the interior of Philistine Bichrome bell-shaped bowls (Dothan 1982: 98). Concentric circles join Philistine motifs on the interior of bowls designated as "derived from Canaanite types" in the Philistine corpus (Dothan 1982: 185-188, Type 13). Thus, red concentric circles seem to be a hybrid feature, combining the Canaanite painted tradition, especially the red monochrome that became common in the late 13 th century, and the Aegean tradition that inspired the early (and later) Philistine wares. Their presence on the ubiquitous open rounded bowl would have appealed to both Philistine and Canaanite tastes, and indeed this type is found mainly in a region that accommodated both populations (see further BL 59 below). The overwhelming majority of these bowls were made of the fabric (FG LI) that is most common among the Philistine types but was also used to produce local Canaanite shapes (see Chapter II.2). The distribution of BL 5 1 (see parallels below) supports this conclusion. An identical bowl type 38</page><page sequence="48">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V is common in Beth-Shemesh Str. III, where it was considered a "typical Philistine bowl" {Ain Shems V: 127). Chalices with such decoration were also found at Beth-Shemesh (Mackenzie 1912-13: PL XXI:7, 9). Identical bowls are common in Tel Miqne VI-V as well (e.g. T. Dothan 1990: 30, photograph). The published material from Ashdod shows two examples of such a bowl C Ashdod V : Fig. 33:6, Str. XII; Ashdod VI: Pl. 111.4:4, Str. XIII), though it is not very common there. Plain open rounded bowls with such decoration are not represented at all in the published material of Gezer or Tell Beit Mirsim. Red concentric circles painted inside open rounded bowls are relatively rare at Tell Qasile, found only in Str. XI-X; red and black circles, and later on (Str. X), black circles on a red slipped background, are more common ( Qasile II: 82-83). Thus, the painting of thin red concentric circles, often in groups, in an open rounded bowl may be a feature of a micro-production line whose products reached a limited area within "greater Philistia" in Iron I (Beth- Shemesh, Tel Batash and Tel Miqne), with smaller numbers reaching Ashdod and Tell Qasile to the west (see also BL 59 below).19 Selected parallels Beth-Shemesh: Ain Shems /-//: Pl.

A small deep bowl with an average diameter of 15 cm. The rim is everted and the walls are slightly rounded, with a soft carination. Five sherds of this type were recovered, four in Str. XII-XI and one small rim from Str. X which may be related to this type, but is questionable. One complete profile is preserved. Pl. 5:12 has a red band painted on its rim. Pl. 6:16 is fired metallic and is covered outside with a fine horizontal combing. The fragmentary nature of these bowls makes it difficult to determine comparisons. These bowls can be allocated to the category that Amiran calls "gently carinated bowls" (Amiran 1969: 94). Some of the examples included in Tufnell's Class B, dated to the late MB II, recall the profile and proportions of this bowl ( Lachish IV: Pl. 68:524-525, 527). These bowls may perhaps be compared to the so-called "S-profiled" bowls that first appear in the palace phase at Aphek; some of them covered with fine combing as well ( Aphek /: 192; Fig. 10.10:3-6). See also Mevorakh II: Fig. 11:1,3 (Str. XII) and Gezer II: Pl. 16:18-21 (Str. XX-XIX). BL 56a: Closed carinated bowl with short everted rim (Photo 12) Str. XII-XI: Pl. 5:3? Str. XI: PL 6:18?, 19-21 A deep bowl with proportions averaging 1:1.8; it is medium-sized, with a diameter range of 16-19 cm. The carination is located above mid-body and the bowl is nicely formed, with wheel marks visible inside. Above the carination the wall is inverted and the short rim is everted. These bowls are rare and are found only in Str. XII (one uncertain sherd), Str. XI (three complete or near-complete) and Str. X (four rims). The shape of BL 56a is similar to the closed sharply carinated bowls common in MB II. Bowl profiles that fit this type are termed "closed carinated-cyma" bowls by Maeir, who notes that the particular type found at our site is indeed more common in the southern part of the country in MB II (Maeir 1997: 94). Bowls similar to these are included in Tufnell's Class C, defined there as derivatives of the closed angular carinated bowls of MB II C Lachish IV: 179). Mullins (2002: 193) notes that the closed carinated bowl is a common MB II shape that becomes rare in LB contexts. See below, BL 56, for a general discussion of carinated bowls. Photo 12.

VIIA: Pl. 54:9 There are several variations of carinated bowls, in which the most significant morphological trait is the placement of the carination: above, below or at mid-body. This, Photo 13. BL 56 (a: Pl. 27:11; b: Pl. 34:8). along with the base type and height, determines the body proportions. An attempt was initially made to categorize the bowls by this factor, as well as upper body stance (flaring or vertical).20 However, there turned out to be no major chronological significance in this division; in each stratum most of the subtypes coexisted (e.g. Pl. 20:14-15). At our site, it seems that the placement or type of carination and the upper stance, as well as the proportions, reflect factors other than chronological, such as the potter's skill, formation technique, type of clay or stylistic tradition.21 Though Tufnell noted a broad typological pattern of chronological significance among the carinated bowls from Lachish, ranging from the earliest "Class A" (MB II-LB I) to the latest "Class E" (LB II), in fact the bowls that are presented in the plates include both "earlier" and "later" types ( Lachish IV: 176-180). At Lachish, as at Tel Batash, the differences between most of the carinated bowls appear to be the result of production lines or peculiarities rather than significant chronological or regional aspects. There is a general tendency towards somewhat less well-executed shapes over time, but this is true of other classes within the LB ceramic assemblage as well. Related to this is the question of whether the degeneration of the carination from a true Z-shaped "fold" to a vestigial external pinch is a chronological indicator (Amiran 1969: 129; Lachish IV: 178; Zuckerman 2003: 128). This is a common trait on LB carinated bowls at Hazor (Zuckerman 2003 : 1 3 1 ), Dan ( Dan II: 66, Fig. 2.54:6-8), Megiddo ( Megiddo III: 210, Fig. 9.10:6) and, to a lesser extent, Beth-Shean (Mullins 2002: 194), but is rarer in the south. Only three examples from Tel Batash (Pis. 38:16-17; 52:5) demonstrate this feature, and most examples of our BL 56 have a well-defined, "pushed-out" carination.22 Moreover, at Hazor, this trait appears on bowls as early as Str. 2 (Zuckerman 2003: 133), so that if it represents a deterioration, it appeared quite early in the LB sequence. In fact, this trait may be considered a change in manufacturing technique, possibly the result of a shift to leaner clays, and not necessarily a degenerate feature (Mullins 2002: 194). It thus seems to be a regional or technological and not merely a chronological phenomenon. These bowls are mostly medium-sized, with a diameter ranging from 16.5 to 20 cm. Many could be stacked, an indication of their rather standard size. The rims are tapering or rounded, but generally not everted. Bases are usually flat disc or convex disc bases, and more rarely ring bases. The six small sherds of this type found in Str. XI are mainly of small bowls with a low sharp 40</page><page sequence="50">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V carnation, which is the typical open sharply cannateci bowl of the later MB (Amiran 1969: 95). No complete profile was found, but it seems that they emulate the shape of the so-called "Eggshell Ware" bowl typical of late MB II; though the fabric of these sherds is not fine and delicate, the sharp low carination recalls this mode of production. The only extant base (PL 6:26) is a slightly convex disc base. One Str. X bowl (Pl. 10:1, Photo 14) is significantly larger than the others, with a high rounded carination and flaring upper stance. Tufnell separated the larger from the smaller carinated bowls, placing them early in the sequence (the 17th and early 16th centuries; Lachish IV: 178). Most of the bowls in Str. X have rounder carinations and shallower proportions (averaging 1:3; Pl. 10:3 is deeper due to its higher base but not its bowl) than the later carinated bowls (Str. IX-VII), which are somewhat more angular and have average proportions of 1:2.5. Shallow bowl profiles like those in Str. X (generally with the trumpet base typical of the late MB IIB: Shiloh : 130; Maeir 1997: 94) are commonly found in Chocolate-on- White ware, in assemblages ascribed to late MB IIB and LB I contexts (Mullins 2002: 289-291 ; Yannai 2000b: 51). The open carinated bowls of Str. IX- VII are the typical LB shapes, though it should be noted that this shape (e.g. Pis. 17:5; 20:12) already appears in MB IIB contexts, such as Str. R3 at Beth-Shean (Maeir 1997: 93, Pl. 4:6-7). Most of the carinated bowls are undecorated, with the exception of two examples with red slip (Pis. 10:2; 17:7), a bowl with a faded red and black design outside (Pl. 54:9, a small sherd that differs somewhat in shape from the other carinated bowls), and notably a bowl with a red cross inside (Pl. 52:5), a rare motif in carinated bowls. BL 56 spans Str. X-VII (19%, 28%, 27% and 12% of the bowls respectively).23 Aside from one small Photo 14. BL 56 (Pl. 10:1). sherd, none were found in Str. VI. Though this might be due to the more fragmentary exposure of the latter level, it seems that the typical LB carinated bowl indeed ceased to exist at our site in Str. VI. Beck and Kochavi (1985: 33) have raised the possibility that carinated bowls were not manufactured at all after the early 13th century, suggesting that the presence or absence of this type is a chronological indicator. It has been suggested that in the latter part of the 13th century the soft carinated cyma profile took over, continuing into Iron I (see BL 59 below). Though it is possible that this lack at Tel Batash is due to factors other than chronological, the LB -type carinated bowls in the south are indeed not as common in contexts of the 13th and early 12th centuries as they are in earlier contexts. Several large carinated bowls were found in or near Fosse Temple III ( Lachish II : Pl. XXXIX:63-65); curiously, their closed shape is similar to our BL 56a, which is more of an MB II type. Several smaller examples from this phase of the Fosse Temple that conform to the description of our LB carinated bowl are presented ( Lachish II: Pis. XL:85-86; XLL122, 124); however, none of these is stratigraphically unequivocal. At Tell Beit Mirsim, while carinated bowls are plentiful in Str. D, they do not appear in Str. C, the published material of which includes mainly Str. C2 of the later LB (TBM /: 37; TBM la : 89). At Gezer, only a few sherds of carinated bowls can be found in late (mostly insecure) LB IIB contexts (e.g. Gezer II: Pl. 24:9-10; Gezer IV: Pis. 15:7; 20:5, Str. XIV), where it was claimed that this bowl type "died out before the end of LB IIB" ( Gezer IVÄ£. 49, n. 86). In this context, a fine LB-type carinated bowl from a 12th-century lamp and bowl deposit is anomalous (Gezer IV: Pl. 22:13, Str. XIII; Bunimovitz and Zimhoni 1993: 118); the few carinated bowls in the LB IIB post-burial phase in Tomb LIO A consist only of sherds and come from uncertain contexts (e.g. Gezer V: 71; Pis. 8:19; 10:24-27). At Ashdod, this bowl type is not particularly popular in Str. XV and none are published from Str. XIV. At Beth-Shemesh, these bowls are not common among the published material; the only example comes from Tomb 11 (Ain Shems IV: PL. XXXV:7). However, though the tomb is dated to the 14th and mainly 13th centuries (Str. IV), this bowl is attributed to an earlier Str. V burial in this tomb (Ain Shems V: 125). It is not possible to trace the exact stratigraphy of the other few bowls of this type published from Beth-Shemesh (see parallels below) and carinated bowls are not mentioned at all in Grant and Wright's summary discussion of the pottery of 41</page><page sequence="51">CHAPTER TWO Str. IV ( Ain Shems V: 111-126). The only such profile from Str. VI at Tel Sippor, dated to the 13th century, is a sherd presumed to be "considerably earlier than the other vessels" (Yannai 2000a: 212). No such bowls are presented by Yannai (1996: PI. 47) in his typology of carinated bowls in southern contexts of the 20th Dynasty, including Lachish Str. VI, and only two LB- type carinated bowls from Megiddo are presented in his northern carinated bowl typology (Yannai 1996: PI. 48:6-7).24 However, of these two, one is attributed to Str. VIIB but comes from an insecure context {Megiddo II : 114), while the other is ascribed to Str. VIII-VII and could therefore date from the early 13 th century. The excavators of the renewed excavations at Megiddo confirm the lack of carinated bowls in the second half- of the 13th century {Megiddo III : 220). Thus, it appears that there was a general decrease in the manufacture and distribution of the typical Bronze Age carinated bowl in the Shephelah at the end of the LB that might be taken as a regional and chronological pivot, though further study is necessary. It seems that a similar trend may be noted at northern sites (Mullins 2002: 193). The carinated bowl that came into vogue at this time and continued into Iron I is the S-profile (see BL 59 below). The question remains as to why this happened. Reasons may be functional (e.g. change in cuisine), technological (e.g. change in clay recipe or formation techniques), economic (e.g. change in market demand, competition or imitation), or political (e.g. external intervention in the pottery industry, relocation of potters, etc.).

The rim top is slightly thickened. The soft carination at mid-body is wider than the neck diameter and the base is a concave ring base. The two thick horizontal handles extend from above the carination at a vertical stance, reaching the level of the rim top.

The rim top is thickened and there is a slight ridge below the rim exterior. The base is a convex disc base. The horizontal handle is attached to the soft carination below the neck and is slightly raised. It is not clear whether this bowl originally had one or two such handles, as parallels suggest that both possibilities are valid. The rim has a painted red band; both sides 42</page><page sequence="52">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V have eight vertical lines extending from the rim band, bordered by a thick horizontal band below, placed in the zone of the soft carination. The one extant handle is painted red as well. The composition and execution of the decoration is careless. The fact that these two bowls are unique in their respective strata and have the singular feature of horizontal handles, unknown in any other local bowl type in our corpus, points to them having been distinctive vessels. The careless decoration on both appears to contrast with this assumed special status, though ethnographic examples (e.g. Meadows 1997: 24) show that some poorly made and utilitarian vessels can be imbued with meaning and value. PI. 39:10 is questionably included in this type. It conforms to two of the criteria that define this type: the Photo 15. BL 70 (a: PI. 34:9; b: PI. 38:19; c: PI. 39:10). shape and decorated exterior. However, the three extant sherds of this vessel do not include a handle of any kind, though this could have been on a part of the vessel that is not preserved, and of course the handle(s) was not necessarily horizontal. Another departure from the other two bowls is the relatively high quality of the decoration, consisting of a metope design in red, including an ibex and palm tree motif. The surface is cream-slipped and lightly burnished. The presence of horizontal handles is the result of Aegean influence. Such handles are usually found on decorated bowls or kraters. Some bowls have only one such handle, which might be due to Cypriot influence (Amiran 1969: 125; Negbi 1989: 52). The kraters with horizontal handles from the Fosse Temple at Lachish are elaborately decorated, apparently related to their cultic context. In fact, most of the bowls and kraters found with horizontal handles are nicely painted, possibly reflecting their more exalted or "exotic" status. Our bowls are a dim reflection of the intricate and well-executed designs often found on such vessels. A variety of reasons might be behind the poorer quality of our vessel: a different function, the domestic context, the poor skill of the potter or artist, a lower economic status of the owner or possibly regional differences.

It was found in two parts that did not exactly join. The unique 43</page><page sequence="53">CHAPTER TWO feature of this bowl is its base, which has a prominent conical protrusion, 2.5 cm high, in its interior. The base is a nicely made thick ring base. The upper exterior is decorated with groups of five vertical red bands, bordered by a thick horizontal red band below, placed below the soft carination. This design is somewhat reminiscent of the decoration on PI. 38:19, though much more precise in execution. The placement of painted metopes on the upper exterior of bowls and kraters is a well-known design in LB assemblages (e.g. Lachish II: Pl. 39:60, Fosse Temple I). Note also a krater from Tel Miqne Str.

V-III: Pl. 77:2 A thick- walled medium to large shallow bowl (average proportions 1:3; diameter ranging from 15 to 25 cm) with a soft carination just above mid-body and a vertical upper stance. The rim top is tapering or rounded (though note PI. 75: 1 1 with a small hammerhead rim like BL 60). The only preserved base is a shallow ring base with a slightly concave interior. This bowl is found only in Str. V. BL 58 shares many features with BL 51 (see above) and the two should be considered together, apparently part of the same production line. The shared features include similar decoration (red painted concentric circles inside). Both bowls have a limited distribution in the region of "greater Philistia", from Beth-Shemesh to the coastal plain, where it appears from Ashdod in the south to Tell Qasile in the north. These bowls were found in Tel Miqne Str. VI-V as well. Most bowls of both types (BL 58 and BL 5 1) are made of similar fabric (variations of FG L), an indication of affinity between their manufacture. Note that the example from Ashdod Str. Xlllb (see selected parallels below) comes from a potter's installation and was apparently produced at the site {Ashdod V: 55; Dothan and Zukerman 2004).

V-IV: Pis. 65:1; 82:11; 83:15-16 A medium-sized to large bowl with a rounded carination on the upper third of the body under the short everted rim, forming a cyma- or S-shaped profile.26 The rim top is rounded or tapering. The proportions average 1:2.5 and the diameter ranges from 20 to 30 cm, though a few are smaller and deeper. Thus, this bowl shape was not produced in an entirely standardized manner. The only preserved base is a concave ring base. Several (e.g. Pis. 70:4; 73: 13) have horizontal handles, a feature borrowed from the contemporary Philistine repertoire and found on cyma-shaped bowls at Beth-Shemesh, Ashdod, Tel Miqne, Tell el-Far'ah (S), Tell Jemmeh, Azor and Tell Qasile ( Qasile IL 41, n. 34, Bowl Type 8a).27 The S-shaped profile already appears in late LB IIB assemblages, such as Beth-Shemesh Str. IVb ( Ain Shems V: 123); Lachish Fosse Temple HI and Str. VII-VI C Lachish II : PL XLI: 125; Lachish IV: PI. 69:555, Tomb 570; Lachish V: PI. 39:11; Yannai 1996: 354, n. 18, PI. 18:26-28); Aphek Str.

VIIB (Megiddo IL Pl. 65:13); see also Qasile II: 40, n. 30 and 'Izbet Sartah: 49-52. It seems these bowls were more common in the south than in the north at this time. The reason for its 44</page><page sequence="54">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V Photo 16. BL 59 (a: PI. 83:15; b-c: not in plates). absence in Str. VI at Batash is not clear. While it could be argued that this bowl type is absent from the Str. VI assemblage because of its relatively small size and fragmentary nature, it seems that we should look for other reasons. Regional factors must be ruled out in light of the numerous examples in our region in the late 13th century. It is possible that the reason is chronological and Str. VI ended before this bowl became popular. However, since we have enough evidence to date this level to the late 13th century, we may look for other factors that explain the presence or absence of pottery types. The reason may be technological: if this bowl shape is the result of a shift to a more plastic clay and a faster wheel, it is possible that this technology did not reach Tel Batash until later in Iron I, with the Philistine pottery. Other factors may be symbolic or social. Such bowls may perhaps have been the innovative product of potters who moved into the southern part of the country during the 13 th century, but did not market their ware to Tel Batash at this time, the distribution occurring only later with a change of population (Hodder 1991; Jones 1997; Sillar 1997; Bunimovitz and Faust 2001). The appearance of these bowls in Str. V follows a hiatus of carinated bowls (see BL 56 above). BL 59 comprises 16% of the bowls in Str. V (59 examples). This shape spread throughout the country during Iron I, in which it became a hallmark of most assemblages of the 12th and 11th centuries (Greenberg 1987: 65; Ain Shems V : 130; Qasile II : 40-41; Killebrew 1998b: 88; Ben- Ami 2001: 160; Megiddo III : 252). It is a common shape in Iron I levels in the Shephelah (see parallels below), such as Beth-Shemesh Str. III (Ain Shems V: 130),GezerStr. Xlll-Xl(GezerIV: 80), Tell Beit Mirsim Str. B ( TBMI : 38; Greenberg 1987: 65). This bowl type is common in Ashdod Str. XIII-XI.28 At Tell Qasile it is one of the most common bowl shapes in Str. XII-XI, declining in Str. X ( Qasile II' 39-40, Bowl Type 8). It represents 15.7% of the bowls in 'Izbet Sartah Str. III (' Izbet Sartah : 50, Bowl Type 3). While the carinated bowl is deemed the most common in Iron I assemblage at Tel Dor, the illustrated examples are actually different from our S-shaped profile, with a short vertical stance above the carination and a thickened rim (Gilboa 2001a: 106-107, BL 23, PI. 511). Notably, this bowl shape is rare at Iron I Beth-Shean. Iron I sites in the central hill country appear to lack this shape, or to have a different variation of it (Killebrew 1998b: 88). The interaction between the Canaanite cyma- shaped bowl and such bowls in the local Mycenaean UIC assemblage is interesting. Small, delicate and medium-sized to large cyma-shaped bowls with a sharp carination and horizontal handles, often with red bands and spirals painted inside, are common in the local Mycenaean UIC assemblages, such as at Ashdod (e.g. Ashdod II-III: Fig. 74:1; Ashdod V: Figs. 14:24-26, 16:11; Ashdod VI: PI. 111.3:3-4), Tell es-Safi and Tel Miqne Str. VII-VI (Dothan and Zukerman 2004: 7-8; Figs. 5:10-11; 6:3-5; Killebrew 2000: 236). Killebrew (1998b: 99) notes that while the Canaanite cyma-shaped bowls (her Form CA 7) are common in Str. VIII in Field 45</page><page sequence="55">CHAPTER TWO I at Tel Miqne, they appear only sporadically in Str. VII, in which the Mycenaean UIC carinated bowls apparently replace them. Interestingly, the sharp cyma profile with horizontal handle of the local Mycenaean UIC group does not continue into the Philistine Bichrome repertoire as defined by Dothan (1982). It thus may be suggested that at the time when the local Mycenaean UIC ware was on the wane, there was an attempt to adapt the Canaanite S-shaped bowl to the Philistine Bichrome repertoire, lending it the "look" of the previously popular Mycenaean UIC bowl, in a kind of typological amalgamation. Indeed, the common red concentric circles (see below) do not appear in any of the LB IIB examples and follow the decorative pattern set by the earlier local Mycenaean UIC tradition. Another interesting feature is that some examples of our BL 59 have a light buff, well-levigated, metallic-fired fabric, similar to the texture of the typical local Mycenaean UIC ware found at Tel Miqne, Ashdod and Tell es-Safi (Killebrew 2000: 243-244; Dothan and Zukerman 2004: 31). However, pÃ©trographie analysis showed that this is the same fabric as that used for the typical Philistine wares (FG LI); it was simply prepared and fired differently (see also BL 8 below).29 It is interesting to note that in ca. 80% of the cases, the fabric group used for BL 59 is that used to manufacture the typical Philistine shapes (FG L; see also Dothan and Zukerman 2004: 32). This interaction between the Philistine and local Canaanite pottery traditions and modes of manufacture is exemplified in this bowl type and its decoration (see below).30 It appears that this bowl type virtually dies out after Iron I, and only a handful of rims are found in a few contexts of the 10th century, such as Lachish Str. V ( Lachish V: PL 41:1-3). Only eight rims of this type were found in 'Izbet Sartah Str. I (' Izbet Sartah : 50). It is not found in Str. IIa at Beth-Shemesh (Am Shems V: 130) or in Str. IV at Tel Batash. The continuation of this profile in Iron II has a sharper and lower carination and is often red-slipped and hand-burnished inside and halfway outside ( Timnah II: 41-42, BL 27; see also Ashdod V: Fig. 45:3, 8, Str. Xa; 'Izbet Sartah: 52).31 Decoration Though many of the S-shaped bowls are plain or have a red band painted on the rim interior, these bowls are often decorated inside with one of two main designs: 1) variations of a design painted in red, termed "the palm tree and paneled zig-zag motif'32 by Macalister (1912a: 190-191, Figs. 346-347), that divides the bowl interior into three or four "slices"; or 2) thin red concentric circles, usually in groups, sometimes beginning as a spiral inside the base and sometimes applied on a whitish slip recalling that of Philistine ware (see also BL 5 1 and BL 58 for similar decoration). The "palm tree and zig-zag" motif begins in the late LB IIB in both plain rounded and cyma-shaped bowls (e.g. Lachish II: Pis. XXXVIL27, 31 ; XLI: 125; Lachish IV: Pis. 71:615, 72:630; Ben Arieh 1981: Fig. 1:4; Beck and Kochavi 1985: 33; Megiddo II: Pl. 65:13; Ashdod I: 79, Fig. 20: 10, Str. XV; Tel Sera4 Str. IX, Oren 1985: Fig. 4:12). It continues into Iron I, though it is less common (Qasile II: 44) and somewhat less elaborate than the LB IIB examples (Yannai 1996: 354, n. 19). In Iron I, this motif appears mainly on cyma-shaped bowls ( Gezer IV: 80, n. 137) and more rarely on rounded bowls (e.g. Lachish IV: Pl. 72:630, Tomb 571; Tell Beit Mirsim, Greenberg 1987: Fig. 9:16, Silo l).33 At Tel Batash, though no complete example was found, unmistakable traces of this motif are found on three cyma-shaped bowl sherds (Pis. 70:5-6; 80:13). At Ashdod, only two published Iron I examples can be cited (Ashdod VI: Pis. 111.4:12, Str. XIII, with thickened rim and bar handle; 111.22:13, Str. XII). This motif is common in Gezer Str. XIII-XI ( Gezer IV: 78, 83). It is present in Tel Miqne Str. VII-V, but only in very small amounts (A. Zukerman, personal communication). It is found at Tell Beit Mirsim Str. B and Tel Sippor Str. V-IV, but its quantities are unknown. Only one example was found at Tell Qasile, with a unique motif of a tree surrounded by red and black concentric circles ( Qasile II: 44; Fig. 15: 17). From Beth- Shemesh, only two small sherds of uncertain provenance with interior zig-zags are illustrated ( Ain Shems /-//: Pl. XXXII:8; Beth Shemesh: 215, lower right); these may, however, date from the LB rather than Iron I. The motif of thin red concentric lines, sometimes beginning inside as a spiral, is not found in the LB and appears initially in Iron I, much more frequently in the south than the north34; it is found in both rounded and cyma-shaped bowls. Concentric red bands are a very common motif at Batash, found on 47% of BL 59. This motif is also common at Ashdod; though S-shaped bowls are well known in Ashdod Str. XIII, this decoration begins to appear on them only in Str. XII. The motif is also found in Iron I cyma-shaped bowls at Beth-Shemesh, Tel Harassim, Tell el-Far' ah (S), Tell Qasile and Tel Sera', where this type of decoration appears to have been common (Yannai 1996: 114). Only one sherd with a somewhat similar motif was published from Gezer Str. XI (Gezer IV: Pl. 41 : 1 8)35 and another questionable sherd comes from Tel Yarmouth (Jasmin 1999: Pl. 78:18). A 46</page><page sequence="56">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V combination of thin red and black painted concentric circles in such bowls is found in substantial amounts only at Tell Qasile in Str. XII-XI (but not Str. X), suggesting a separate production line for these bowls at that site ( Qasile II: 83; e.g. Figs. 12:20; 22:11); note also the tree motif in bichrome from this site mentioned above. The only other assemblage containing bowls with bichrome decoration inside is Ashdod Str. XII, with two small sherds of rounded bowls ( Ashdod VI: Pl. 111.22: 12, 19).36 The later expression of the concentric circle motif, applied in black paint on a red-slipped background, becomes common at Tell Qasile in Str. X ( Qasile II: 83-84). It thus seems that the S-shaped bowl was a universally popular Canaanite form that was influenced by the Philistine repertoire in both shape and decoration. The distribution of the decoration as detailed above, the fabric, and the addition of horizontal or loop handles reflect this interchange (though of course these conclusions are tentative since most of the published data lack quantitative or technological production information). It seems that the Canaanite motif of palm tree and paneled zig-zags in red is more frequent at inland sites and virtually absent from coastal Philistine sites, where the red concentric circles (sometimes on a white slip) are far more common. Tell Qasile seems to have had its own decorative tradition,, considering the preponderance of the concentric line motif (and even the tree motif) in bichrome, hardly found elsewhere. Thus, Beth-Shemesh and Tel Batash mark the easternmost sites at which the red line motif was popular. If indeed this is the case, the inhabitants of Tel Batash, though having access to both traditions, clearly preferred the "coastal" Philistine-oriented decoration. However, this "preference" may simply reflect a chronological development, since it may be claimed that the Canaanite motif died out at the time when the Philistine motif became predominant or occupation at these inland sites (e.g. Lachish) was abandoned at this time in any case.

The sides of the bowl are slightly curved, with an everted rim. The few bases that are preserved are narrow ring bases or small, well-formed convex disc bases. All these bowls have two horizontal handles just above the body curvature. This bowl is 47</page><page sequence="57">CHAPTER TWO Photo 17. BL 8 (a: PL 71:3; b: PL 74:15; c: Pl. 79:12). defined as a "bell-shaped" or "deep" bowl, derived from the Mycenaean skyphos; this is Dothan's bowl Type 1 (Dothan 1982: 98-106) and bowl Type 16 at Qasile (Qasile II : 87-90). The horizontal handles are mostly round-sectioned and well formed, though there are some with smaller and more "pressed-in" handles and a few have "depleted smears" (e.g. PI. 74:15), a trait found on such bowls in later contexts of the early 10th century ( Timnah /: 32- 33). It is interesting that two size and capacity categories were discerned: 0.3-0.4 liter and 0.7-0.9 liter. This is somewhat surprising, as one would expect that such a product would follow a pre-set concept in light of its assumed function in ritual or ethnically related drinking practices (Gilboa et al. 2006). Most of the bowls (86%) are made of variations of FG L, the locally made fabric found to be dominant for all the vessels in the Philistine repertoire. Almost 5% of these bowls were made of a whitish, well-levigated, metallic- fired fabric that was also used for some examples of BL 59. Most of the bell-shaped bowls were well made with thin walls and often with a smoothed finish. At Tel Dor, it was noted that most of these bowls are quite coarse and crudely decorated and are mostly locally produced (Gilboa 2001a: 404). Such quality seems to be more characteristic of northern sites ( Qasile IL 90, note 4). The vast majority of the bell-shaped bowls at Tel Batash consist only of sherds, a condition typical of almost all the ceramic material of Str. V and especially the Philistine ware. This high breakage rate might be related to its use as tableware (Bunimovitz and Yasur- Landau 1996: 92). Gilboa (2001a: 404, 447) surmised that they were used as drinking vessels reflecting "Western" feasting habits and may be considered an ethnic marker (assumedly of Aegean origin). Decoration on the outside of serving or drinking bowls usually fulfills a function of "visual performance" in ceremonial consumption (Mills 1999: 113). However, while the custom itself may have been foreign, it should not be assumed that only "foreigners" used these vessels in this way, or that this was necessarily the function; thus ethnicity should not automatically be assumed when such bowls are found (Bunimovitz 1990: 212-213). The majority (ca. 82%) of these bowls bear red monochrome decoration, with motifs well known at Ashdod Str. XI-XI and Tel Miqne Str. VI-V: horizontal lines or antithetic spirals outside (Table 19).38 The Table 19.

Only those vessels and sherds that were large enough for reasonably secure identification of their decoration, totalling 74 out of the 110 examples of BL 8, were counted. These motifs all appeared individually and none were combined. 48</page><page sequence="58">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V spirals on our bowls apparently belong to the antithetic spiral motif (Dothan 1982: 208), though most are too fragmentary to categorize; see PI. 79:12 for the most complete example, which has spirals that are larger and better preserved than the others. Interestingly, a close parallel to this design can be seen on a late Iron I A bell- shaped bowl from Tel Dor, which pÃ©trographie tests showed to have been made on the Carmel or Galilean coast (Gilboa 2001a: 403, PL 14.1:6). One bowl has black "scallops" along the rim exterior; this motif is known in the local Mycenaean IIIC1 repertoire. None of our bowls is decorated inside and the most common design is red painted horizontal bands, often a line on the outer rim and a pair of lines on the lower body exterior. This contrasts with the quantitative picture from Tell Qasile, where the most common motif is pairs of spirals, with red horizontal bands a rarity; black and bichrome decoration are more common than red monochrome at that site ( Qasile II : 90). It seems that at Ashdod as well, the bichrome decoration is dominant (Qasile IL 90, n. 3); though no quantitative data have been published, perusal of the plates in Ashdod V and Ashdod VI shows that the spiral motif is somewhat more common than the red horizontal bands. At Tel Miqne, the spiral motif is more common than the horizontal bands motif. At Gezer, despite the lack of published quantitative data, the material in the plates indicates that red horizontal bands are more common than spirals on these bowls. At Aphek, though only a few such bowls were found in Str. Xl 1-10, these all had black spirals (Gadot 2003: Pis. V.33:8-9; 36:11; V.39: 10), aside from one with a red band outside (Gadot 2003: Pl. V.36:4).39 Thus, the bell-shaped bowls at Tel Batash are similar to these bowls in Philistia in their general manufacture but differ somewhat in details of decoration; there seems to be more of a similarity of decoration to sites outside of Philistia proper, such as Gezer. However, this distribution of motifs might be a chronological issue (horizontal bands may be later than spirals) and only quantitative publication will resolve this issue. The handles often had red smears on the top, or less frequently, vertical hatches. On about 25% of the bowls, traces of a wash-like white slip could be discerned, and it is not clear whether there might originally have been more and the slip eroded away; possibly the paint was simply originally applied on an unslipped smoothed surface. At Tell Qasile, this was found to be a chronological indicator, with a decrease in the amount of white slip (or "wash", as it is termed there) from Str. XII to Str. X ( Qasile IL 88). This bowl is found exclusively in Str. V, in which it is by far the most common bowl (30% of all bowls). Such bowls are dominant in the local Mycenaean UIC monochrome corpus (Dothan and Zukerman 2004: 8-12) and continue to be the most common ceramic type in the Philistine repertoire at all sites at which this pottery is found (Dothan 1982: 98; Qasile IL 88). Thus, its dominance among all the bowl types at Tel Batash is intriguing in connection with the nature of the Philistine presence at the site in Str. V. At Gezer, these bowls first appear in Str. 6c in Field VI (general Str. XIII) and are found throughout Str. XII-XI ( GÃ¨zer IV: 80); no quantitative data for its frequency are supplied. At Tell Qasile, it was noted that these bowls may have gone out of use during Str. X ( Qasile IL 88). Some examples of our bowls are of a somewhat debased type (e.g. Pl. 73:12 with a mid-body carination and non- protruding handles); this type is paralleled mainly at Tel Miqne in Str. Va-b and IV (A. Zukerman, personal communication). The continuation of this bowl type into Iron II, with depleted horizontal handles and red slip and hand burnish, is discussed in Timnah IL 32-33 (Type BL 8a). Parallels to this bowl are found at numerous Iron I sites and tombs, mainly in Philistia and the Shephelah (e.g. Ashdod, Ashkelon, Tell Qasile, Azor, Tel Miqne, Tell es-Safi, Tell 'Eitun, Tel Sippor, Tell Beit Mirsim, Gezer, Tell el-Hesi, Tell el-Far' ah (S), Beth-Shemesh and Gezer; see Dothan 1982: 99-101). Other sites with small amounts of such bowls are Tel Masos ( Masos II: Pl. 142:8,14, Str. III), 'Izbet Sartah (' Izbet Sartah : 91, Fig. 7:28), Tel Harassim (Givon 1997: Fig. 11:8), Tel Dor (Gilboa 2001a: 403, Pl. 14.1:6) and Aphek (Gadot 2003: Pl. V.33:8-9, Str. X10). Dothan (1982: 105) presents several bowls of this type in Iron I contexts at northern sites such as 4 Afula, Beth-Shean and Megiddo. To this we may add Tell Keisan (Keisan: Pl. 66:2, Str. 9c), 'Akko (Killebrew 1998b: 175, n. 700), Tel Qiri (Qiri: Fig. 42:5-6) and Tel Rehov (A. Mazar, personal communication). The presence of this bowl in limited numbers at sites outside Philistia represents a different phenomenon, both quantitatively and qualitatively, from its appearance in Philistia and its regional sphere of influence (Gilboa et al. 2006). The ubiquity of this bowl type at Tel Batash, a site on the eastern border of Philistia, should apparently be related to the "mainstream" of its production, based on parameters of both quantity and quality. This raises the question of the portent of its frequency at our site and the possible social and ethnic implications; see further, pp. 136-138. 49</page><page sequence="59">CHAPTER TWO BL 42: Deep rounded bowl with thickened rim Str. V: Pl. 83:1 Str. VA?: Pl. 80:1 Medium-sized deep rounded bowls (17.5-20 cm in diameter) with short, rounded, thickened rim exterior. No bases have been preserved. Two small horizontal handles may be found below the rim exterior; sometimes the handles are very small and almost vestigial (PI. 82: 1). The bowls are usually decorated with two red painted bands outside and a red band on the rim top. Faint traces of white slip can be discerned outside. There is a general affinity to the shape of the Philistine KR 2 and it appears that BL 42 is an offshoot of this generic Philistine krater (see below). It should possibly be considered a product of the local pottery industry that was influenced by the influx of Philistine shapes and decorative traditions, alongside the continuation of shapes of the local Canaanite Iron I repertoire such as the hemispherical or small deep rounded bowl (such as our BL 50c). Only two examples of this type were found in Str. V; however, 11 examples (2% of the bowls) were found in the lowest loci attributed to Str. IVb ( Timnah II : 33 and parallels there). This is curious, since the shape and especially the decoration of this bowl point to its being a derivative of the Philistine repertoire, and it would be expected to be more frequent in Str. V than in Str. IV. BL 61: Bowl with soft carination and handles Str. V: Pis. 61: 12; 74:3 Str. V-IV: PI. 78:21 Several sherds of small bowls with a vertical upper stance and a soft curve below the mid-body. The rim is slightly thickened. A loop handle extends from rim to the carination. Only one handle is preserved and it is not certain whether there was a second handle as well, though from the few parallels found (see below) it appears that it did. Though the general profile is reminiscent of the Philistine bell-shaped bowl (BL 8), the handle and rim shape set it apart. The diameter averages 11 cm and no base is preserved. PL 74:3 has traces of thick white slip outside, while Pis. 61:12 and 78:21 are red-slipped. This type may be related to Qasile Bowl Type 9, carinated bowls with two loop handles found there in Str. XI-X ( Qasile II : 42). See also Ashdod V: Fig. 33:18 (Str. Xllb?), where it was considered a rare type ( Ashdod V: 78). A very similar profile appears on two- handled bowls set on a high hollow trumpet foot at Tel Miqne in Str. VI-IV; this foot makes the vessel more of a chalice, vaguely reminiscent of the Mycenaean kylix. The examples from Tel Miqne are plain, or decorated with Philistine Bichrome motifs or the so- called "degenerate" late Philistine spirals. None have the red slip of our examples. This appears to be a hybrid product of a local industry confined to a few Philistine sites at this time, combining Aegean-inspired shape with Canaanite-style handles and decorated with Philistine Bichrome decoration or red slip. Imitations of Imported Bowls Str. X PL 10:22 : A rim and body sherd of a hemispherical bowl with a tapering rim (Photo 18). The interior and exterior are covered with a thick grayish-white continuously burnished slip, painted on the exterior in brown in a horizontal and vertical ladder pattern; this is a fair approximation of the Cypriot White Slip motifs. PÃ©trographie analysis of this sherd showed it to be locally produced from marl of the Taqiye Formation, the most commonly used fabric source at the time. It was found in the same building as two sherds of White Slip I hemispherical bowls (see Chapter III). This imitation Cypriot hemispherical bowl found in our Str. X is one of the earliest known examples of such an imitation; both the original and the imitation are rare at this early date. Our dating of Str. X to the mid- 16th century, corresponding with the very beginning of the 18th Dynasty, represents a time prior to the large scale-importation of White Slip II to the Levant, which apparently began no earlier than the later 18th Dynasty (Oren 2001 : 143). Though one might surmise that imitations are the product of an entrenched Photo 18. Imitation White Slip bowl (PI. 10:22). 50</page><page sequence="60">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V tradition in which familiar objects are desirable enough to imitate, it seems that there were already a few imitations at the stage when the Canaanite consumer was just becoming acquainted with the Cypriot White Slip wares. Though they are not identical to our sherd, examples of imitations of Cypriot hemispherical bowls in such early contexts are Megiddo Str. X (Megiddo II: PI. 45:20) and Hazor Str. 3 (Hazor I: PL CXXIV:1, Str. 3, LB I). Str. VI Pl. 60:11 : A small rim and body sherd with a plain rim, soft carination and remains of a horizontal handle that rises above the rim. The fabric is local and, though the fragment is small, it appears to be hand-made. Its profile and handle shape point to its being an imitation of a Cypriot Base Ring bÃ³wl. A close parallel is found in Str. VI at Tel Sippor, dated to the 13th century (parallel to Lachish Str. VII) by Yannai (2000a: 215). Other imitation Base Ring bowls were found in Tombs 557 and 559 at Lachish, dated to the late 13th and early 12th centuries 0 Lachish IV : 246-247; PI. 82:906-907). Str. V Pl. 63:15 : This is a rather large wishbone-shaped handle with a narrow two-pronged end. It is made of local fabric and nicely painted in black arid red. Its Str. V attribution is curious, since though horizontal handles were familiar at that time by way of the Philistine repertoire, the wishbone shape is found mainly on local imitations of Cypriot wares of the LB (e.g. Lachish IV: PI. 85:909-911). Thus, this sherd may have originated from one of the LB levels. Red-slipped and Hand-burnished Bowls: BL 11, 26, 26a, 24 These types are common in Str. IV and are fully described in Timnah II (references below). BL 26: Medium-sized to large rounded bowl with molded rim Str. V-IV: PI. 71:17 BL 26a: Smaller, more delicate version of BL 26 Early Str. V: Pl. 68:13 Two sherds of an open rounded bowl with molded rim and ridges under the rim exterior; BL 26 is medium-sized to large, while BL 26a is a smaller and more delicate version. In Str. IV these two types constitute 1% of the bowls and are mainly red-slipped and hand-burnished ( Timnah II: 36-37). Of the four examples found in Str. V (two in the pottery plates and two additional ones), two are from mixed Str. V-IV contexts; consequently, this bowl should not be considered a valid Str. V type. BL 11: Open, softly carinated bowl with ledge or molded rim Early Str. V: Pl. 68:14 Str. V: Pis. 75:19; 77:7-9?; 78:5 Str. VA: Pl. 79:2 Nine sherds of this bowl type were found, constituting 3% of the bowls in Str. V; seven are red-slipped and burnished with a few horizontal lines. In Str. IV this bowl constitutes 7% of the bowls (lÃ¬mnah II: 40-41). It is difficult to determine whether this is a valid Str. V type, since the extant sherds are small, though from relatively secure Str. V contexts. BL 24: Shallow softly carinated bowl Str. V-IV: PI. 71:18 One sherd of this shallow carinated bowl came from a mixed Str. V-IV context, while two more sherds were registered as belonging to Str. V; however, it should probably not be considered a valid Str. V type. This bowl is the most frequent one (33%) in Str. IV ( lÃ¬mnah II: 44-45). Bowl Varia The following are bowl sherds that could not be classified according to the above type series: Str. XII-XI PL 5:13: A small rim and body sherd with a slightly flaring stance, possibly belonging to a sharply carinated bowl (see BL 56); there are traces of red slip and burnish on the rim top and interior. Str. X Pl. 9:9: A rim and body sherd of a large, thick-walled open bowl, ca. 30 cm in diameter; it is coarse and heavy and apparently hand-made. PI. 9:17: A small sherd of a thick- walled open bowl with a sharp inverted rim, slightly protruding and sharp on the exterior. This kind of profile is common in MB II bowls (Beck 2000: Figs. 8.11:14, Str. BV; 10.10:9, Str. AXIV; Megiddo III: Fig. 9.4:4, 14, 19; Ashdod V: Fig. 51</page><page sequence="61">CHAPTER TWO 2:1, Str. XXII) and less common in early LB contexts (Mullins 2002: 188). PL 9:19 : A small rim and body sherd with a slightly inverted stance, possibly belonging to a small closed carinated bowl; traces of red slip and burnish are found inside and on the outer rim. See Megiddo III : Fig. 9.5:6. Str. IX Pl. 17:2 : A small rim and body sherd of an open bowl with an inverted rim, similar to PI. 9:17 but without the exterior rim treatment (Beck 2000: Figs. 8. 10:4, Str. B V; 10.12:11, Str. AXIV). This is either a late expression of such a profile or a stray sherd originating in the MB strata. PL 17:4: A small rim sherd of a large open bowl with a soft carination below the rim exterior, ca. 25 cm in diameter. Compare to the more sharply carinated MB IIA bowls at Aphek (Beck 2000: Figs. 8.5:5-7, Str. BVII; 10.1:15, Str. AXVI; 10.10:14-15, Str. AXIV). This too might possibly be a stray sherd from an earlier stratum. Str. VIII Pl. 37:15: A storage jar base reworked to serve as a deep open bowl (Photo 19). The interior contains a chunk of clay, left untrimmed during manufacture of the original vessel. The breakage line is slanting rather than horizontal. The "rim" is clearly smoothed and worn. Obviously such a "bowl" could not stand on its own and needed support, either sunk in an earthen floor or in a stand. This is clearly a deliberate secondary use of this vessel. A specific localized need for a deep open vessel apparently dictated this re- working of a broken storage jar, perhaps since such a vessel was not manufactured Photo 19. Storage jar base m secondary use as a deep bowl (Pl. 37:15). as part of the regular pottery stock and could not be acquired ready-made. Str. VII PL 46:10: An incomplete asymmetrical miniature bowl, hand-made and low-fired. Str. V Pl. 63:16: A complete miniature bowl, hand-made and low-fired, slightly burnt. Pis. 67:9; 75:18: Two rim sherds of two large open bowls of unknown diameter. The rim top is rounded and knobs protrude under the rim exterior. Since only a small fragment has been preserved of each bowl, is impossible to determine whether there were additional knobs around the rim. Bowl Type lb at Tell Qasile, found there in Str. XI-X, was defined by the knobs under the rim ( Qasile II: 36-37). Pl. 73:3: A small rim and body sherd, 1 1 cm in diameter, with a sharp carination below the rim exterior. There are traces of red slip inside and on the upper exterior. Pl. 80:2: A small rim sherd of a large bowl with a careless bar handle running along the rim exterior. The rim and handle are painted with vertical red hatches. Bar handles occur, though not frequently, in Iron I (Qasile II: 37). Pl. 80:10: A small, delicate rim and body sherd of an incurving shallow bowl, possibly related to BL 25 ( Timnah II: 34). It has a narrow, well-shaped bar handle under its rim exterior and a red band painted along the rim. This may possibly be compared to several bowl rims with bar handles in Lachish Str. VI (Yannai 1996: 21-24). Pl. 83:2: A rim and body sherd of a large heavy bowl (ca. 32 cm in diameter) with rounded sides and a pronounced hammerhead rim top; though its size is more typical of a krater, its stance defines it as a bowl. CHALICES (Fig. 2; Table 20) Chalices are rare at Tel Batash during the MB and LB and the two types defined here are similar. They continue to be relatively rare in Iron I, though the total amount of chalices found in Str. V is almost double the total found in all the LB strata together. The chalice form reaches a peak of popularity throughout the country in Iron I (Amiran 1969: 213), and its relative scarcity at Tel Batash at this time is noteworthy. All the chalices come from domestic contexts. 52</page><page sequence="62">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V Fig. 2. Typology: chalices and goblets. Table 20. Distribution of chalices by stratum; N=31.

This chalice has a bowl with a soft round carination below the rim. The only completely preserved foot is short and flaring and has a sharp ridge just above the bottom, very similar to that found on CH 2 (the base fragment PI. 39: 12 has been included here, though it could equally well be classified as CH 2). A comparison to this type of sharp ridge may be found on a chalice with a somewhat less marked carination from Str. IB at Hazor ( Hazor II: PL CXVIIL22). Very sharply upturned edges on trumpet bases can be found in Str. VI at Shiloh, dated to LB I/IIA {Shiloh: Fig. 6.33:10-12, 14). No comparisons to this type of base were found at southern sites. Iron I Chalices: CH 4, 6 CH 4 (Photo 22) Str. V: Pis. 73:4, 15; 82:9 Str. V-IV: Pl. 82:12? This chalice has a rounded bowl with an everted rim; the rim is usually short but can be long as well. Pl. 73: 15 has a more everted "shelf' rim than Pl. 82:9. Two bases are preserved, one with a ridge or step above the flaring bottom (Pl. 73:15) and the other smooth (Pl. 82:9); these were not separated into subtypes, though technically they represent two different shapes. Though Pl. 82: 12 lacks the foot, it is designated a chalice due to the shape of its bowl, which is a variant of the everted rim type. It is decorated with vertical drips of red paint inside. The rim top of Pl. 73:4 is painted with a red band. Pl. 73: 15 bears traces of a thick white "slip" inside and outside, which may in fact be postdepositional encrustation (there is such "slip" on GB 2 as well, Pl. 73:16 below). Chalices with everted rims are the most frequent type found in the Iron II levels at Tel Batash. The only preserved Iron II base is a high, slightly flaring foot with a raised edge ( Timnah II: 55-57); it differs from the ridged foot of Pl. 73:15 and, though similar to the smooth foot of Pl. 82:9, is taller. Thus, though the rim and bowl shape are similar, there are deviations in some typological details between the Iron I and II. Since only Photo 22. CH 4 (a: Pl. 73:15; b: Pl. 82:9). 54</page><page sequence="64">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V two bases are preserved in Str. V, it is impossible to say which is the more common and it appears that ridged and plain bases coexisted during this period. Chalices with everted rims and ridged bases are common in Iron I throughout the country and continue into the early Iron n, after which they become much less frequent {Timnah II: 56; Qasile Ih 49). Though Amiran claims that all Iron I chalices in the south have ridged bases, she presents a smooth example from Beth-Shemesh (Amiran 1969: PL 68:7), similar to our PL 82:9. Several everted rim chalices with smooth, non-stepped bases were found at Tell Qasile ( Qasile IL Figs. 40: 8; 47:9, Str. X). CH6 Str. V: PL 74: A small rounded bowl with an elongated, flat and horizontal rim creating a protruding shelf. The rim top is painted red. A single example was found in Str. V, though the type is known in Iron I at other sites (e.g. Aphek, Str. Xl 1 : Gadot 2003: Pl. 33. V: 16). It was also found in small amounts in all three Iron II strata at Tel Batash ( Timnah II : 58). The small amounts and fragmentary nature of the examples found in both Iron I and II preclude any definitive conclusions about its possible continuity between these periods. Chalice Varia Str. X PL 17:11 : The lower flaring part of a chalice foot, red- slipped inside and outside. Pl. 17:12Ä£. This complete foot is smooth and its base is relatively straight and non-flaring. Str. VII PL 51:7Ä. A fragment of the join to the bowl and the upper foot. Str. VI Pl. 58:22 : A small rim and body sherd of a shallow bowl with an incurving rim, ca 16 cm in diameter. The rim exterior is thickened and rounded and painted with a faint red band that has dripped down. Parallels from Aphek suggest that this sherd belonged to a chalice (Gadot 2003: Pis. 19:14; 28:3, Str. X12). See such chalices from Megiddo, Str. VII {Megiddo II: PL 72:11-13) and a similar rim and bowl from Transjordan, dated to late LB II (McGovern 1986: Fig. 33:7; Deir 'Alia sanctuary: Franken 1992: Fig. 4-9:23, Phase E). Str. V Pl. 72:13: A sherd of the bottom of a flaring base, apparently belonging to a chalice. Pl. 83:17: A fragment of the join of the bowl and foot; the latter appears to have been narrow and straight. GOBLETS (Fig. 2; Table 21) The distinction between chalices and goblets is based mainly on variations in the height of the foot and the shape of the bowl, though sometimes stance and decoration are taken into account as well (Amiran 1969: 95, 129, 134). Goblets are extremely rare at Tel Batash and only the three examples presented below definitely belong to this class, though is possible that other fragments classified here as chalice varia (e.g. Pis. 17:12, 83: 17) may have belonged to goblets. None of the goblets is decorated, except possibly for Pl. 73:16. GB 1 (Photo 23) Str. IX: PL 19:9 A small deep bowl with a soft low carination, above which are almost vertical sides). The rim is tapering and the base is a wide, low ring base. It is not decorated. Its classification as a goblet is based mainly on Amiran's definition of a similarly shaped vessel that is well known at Hazor in Str. 2-1B (e.g. Hazor I: Pis. XC:5, 13; Hazor III-IVÅ. Pl. CCLXIIL34). Note also a somewhat comparable vessel from Lachish; it is broken just below the carination, so it is not known if the base was high or low ( Lachish IV: Pl. 72:639, Tomb 4004, MB III-LB III). A very similar vessel was found in Megiddo Str. IX ( Megiddo IL Pl. 53: 14), alongside examples with higher bases (Gadot 2003: Pl. 55: 13-24). Still more were found in LB I tombs at Megiddo ( Megiddo III: 206, Fig. 9:8, Tomb 94) and an LB I/early LB IIA context at Shiloh (; Shiloh : Fig. 6.35:1, 4). A similar base and body were found in a Str. X14 fill in a drain at Aphek (Gadot 2003: Table 21. Distribution of goblets by stratum; N=3.

Thus, this shape occurs in both domestic and funerary contexts, both decorated and plain, in north and south alike, in contexts contemporary to our Str. IX. GB 2 (Photo 24) Str. VII: Pl. 39:13 Str. V: Pl. 73:16 Essentially, the shape of the bowl of these two examples is similar to that of GB 1. However, the high foot and more accentuated carination set them apart, though the two differ from each other and are also chronologically dispersed. PI. 39:13 has a wide, low, soft carination, above which are slightly flaring sides; the rim is tapering. The foot is flaring with a thickened edge and upturning edge, somewhat reminiscent of the base of CH 2 and CH 3 (above). It was distorted by fire, apparently during the destruction of Building 475. Pl. 73: 16 has a much sharper carination, the rim top is rounded and the foot has a ridge, characteristic of Iron I and IIa chalices (e.g. CH 4; see PI. 73:15, with which PI. 73:16 was found). This type of "goblet bowl" is known from MB IIB and continues to occur throughout the LB, though in LB IIB a more globular or hemispherical body shape develops, which becomes well known at sites in the Jezreel Valley, Jordan Valley and Philistia in Iron I (Amiran 1969: Pis. 28:8-9; 40:1-2, 4, 9; 68:4-5; Qasile II : 51); this globular shape was not found at Tel Batash. Thus, the bowl of our PI. 73:16 from Str. V is a late rendition of the earlier vogue in goblet bowls, though the ridge or step on its foot suits the Iron I trend in chalices (see CH 2 above). PI. 73: 16 bears traces of a thick white "slip" or encrustation, identical to that of PL 73: 15 (CH 2); both were made of the same fabric and were found together in Area C (Locus 668), and they were apparently manufactured together. This affinity emphasizes the fine line between chalices and goblets. The reason for the "throwback" to this goblet style is not known; it is rare Photo 24. GB 2 (a: PL 39:13; b: Pl. 73:16). at this time (for a contemporary, smaller version of this bowl shape, though with its foot missing, see Ashdod V : Fig. 33:16, Str. XII). Our Pl. 39: 13 may be compared with several similar vessels from Hazor, Str. IB ( Hazorll : Pl. CXVIIL28-29; Hazor III-IV: Pl. CCLXXIIL9-10, 18-19), most from cultic contexts. Several examples also come from the Deir 'Alia sanctuary (Franken 1992: Fig. 3-7:9, Phase E). Goblet Varia Pl. 75:21 : This trumpet base may have belonged to a goblet.

Vpit: Pl. 70:10 A deep krater (average proportions 1:1.7) with a rounded carination above mid-body, though a few sharper examples exist (e.g. Pl. 4:6). These kraters are medium- sized to large (ca. 25-37.5 cm in diameter) and most are thick-walled. The stance above the carination is either vertical or slightly inclined. It seems that a vertical upper stance is somewhat more common in the earlier strata, while the inclined upper stance is more frequent in Str. Vn-VI. The most common rim shape on these kraters is a hammerhead rim (angled-in, angled-out or horizontal), though there are variations, protruding only inside or outside. Two loop handles extend from the rim top to the carination; though they are preserved in only two cases, the LB parallels suggest that this was common. Variations of this krater occur with two horizontal handles in the LB (e.g. Lachish IL Pl. XLVHI:245; Megiddo IL Pl. 66:4) and in Iron I ( Qasile II : P1.46:10, Krater Type la); these are considered Aegean- or Cypriot-inspired (see BL 70 above and Dothan 1982: 115; Amiran 1969: 135). The few preserved bases are concave ring bases or wide disc bases. The average capacity of these kraters is 11 liters. This krater is virtually the only type in use during the entire LB.40 The initial appearance of this shape is marked by no more than three sherds in Str. X and four in Str. EX. Though they differ somewhat from the later examples in that they have a longer, more prominent neck, it is clear that they are forerunners of KR 1; indeed, such krater shapes can already be found in MB IIB contexts (e.g. Hazor L Pl. CXV:1, everted rim), though none were found in our Str. XII-XI. This scarcity in Str. X-IX may indicate that this krater was only just appearing on the local market. On the other hand, this lack might simply reflect the general scarcity of kraters in most of the LB occupation levels, a scarcity that is surprising in light of the domestic nature of our assemblages; a relatively substantial number of kraters (45) occurs only in Str. VE. Mullins (2002: 214) notes that during the LB carinated kraters tend to be more common in the north, though numerous examples exist in southern sites as well (see selected parallels below). In the LB strata, KR 1 was made of four different (local) fabric groups (C, D, E and I), though one (D) was dominant (65%); see Chapter n.2. This might be related to the vessel's function, lending it stability and resistance (note that ca. 40% of the storage jars in Str. IX-Vn were made of FG D as well). In Str. V, all but one of the examples examined were made of FG K, while the exception was made of the fabric typical of the Philistine vessels (LI). However, despite this technological modification in Iron I, the basic shape of the vessel hardly changed. Thus this alternation is most likely part of the broader change in the source of pottery rather than a change in function or consumer demand for this long-lived vessel shape. In other words, the change in fabric is barely expressed in the vessel shape or mode of production. Apart from one example with a red wash on part of the vessel (Pl. 21:10), KR 1 is undecorated. This contrasts with other sites, where many kraters of this type are decorated, usually on the upper part of the vessel, above the carination. For example, such kraters found in the Fosse Temples II and III at Lachish are richly decorated ( Lachish IL Pl. XLVIII), though this may of course be related to their cultic context. It seems that a fair portion of these kraters from Beth-Shemesh, at least among the published material, are decorated (e.g. Ain Shems IV: Pl. LVHL21-24, 31-33). At Hazor, decorated and undecorated kraters were found together (Zuckerman 2003: 137). As with BL 70, this lack of decoration at our site possibly reflects differences in function, context, economic conditions, ceramic skills or localized traditions. In Str. V there are minor variations in rim shape and details of manufacture, such as a somewhat lower carination (see above concerning the change in fabric). The only complete profile found in this stratum (Pl. 61:16) differs somewhat in its higher carination and inverted upper stance; a very close, though somewhat earlier, parallel to this vessel is found in Str.

KR 1 (PI. 39:4). is similar to Tell Qasile Krater Type 1 , a carinated krater with two loop handles from the rim that is common throughout Iron I at that site ( Qasile II : 45^46). Northern examples of this krater are somewhat different in Iron I, mainly in details of proportion, number of handles (four or more) and decoration (more decorated than in the south) (Yannai 1996: 228-229). Often, they are deeper as well (e.g. Beth-Shean Level VI: James 1966: Fig. 55:4). In Str. V, KR 1 decreases to only 14% of the kraters and is joined and outnumbered by other krater types, especially the Philistine KR 2 (below).41 The relationship between the shape of the long-lived KR 1 and that of the typical Philistine krater KR 2 should be examined as well; though the latter derived from external sources, there is an obvious morphological connection between the two forms (see below, KR 2; Gezer IV: 79, n. 134; Dothan 1982: 115). Despite their diversity in fabrics and certain details, these large, sturdy, utilitarian kraters form a consistent group in both general shape and type of manufacture. This shape is common at sites throughout the country during the entire LB and is found in domestic, funerary and cultic contexts, both decorated and undecorated. The relative homogeneity of the shape makes it difficult to establish regional or chronological subdivisions. The concept of this vessel remains virtually unchanged from at least the beginning of the LB until the beginning of Iron II, making this one of the most long-lived forms in the entire assemblage. This phenomenon has been noted at other sites as well (Ain Shems V: 132; Amiran 1969: 216; Qasile II : 47). The standardization of this vessel type is not the result of mass production, but is apparently related to its function and cultural concept. In light of the utilitarian function of food preparation (and possibly serving) generally assigned to this vessel, such longevity, homogeneity and stability of shape is noteworthy (Arnold 1985: 144-158).

VIII: PL 25:3 60</page><page sequence="70">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V This krater is represented only by the two examples in the plates, which are broadly related in their similar shape but do not comprise a homogeneous type. It is a large, thick- walled krater with a rounded body. PL 11:7 has two large handles extending from the rim down to the body curve; the handle attachment is careless. The inner rim is thickened, either rounded or angled. No exact parallels were found for this shape, which is relatively uncommon in the LB, when carinated bodies were preferred. Globular kraters were more popular in the earlier part of the MB (Amiran 1969: 99). Comparisons might be made to a rounded krater with a thickened rim found in Str. XVII at Ashdod ( Ashdod V : Fig. 8:18) and a similar shape, with two handles, found in Str. la at Hazor (Hazor II: Pl. CXXIV:9). In light of the lack of parallels and the dispersion between Str. X and VIII, it is possible that these vessels simply represent a variant, or a particular shape manufactured for a specific function, rather than a valid pottery type of regional and chronological value. KR 5: "Pithos krater" Str. IX: Pl. 17:14 A complete restored example of a very large, deep closed krater with a thick-walled piriform body (height 52 cm; rim diameter 37 cm); an additional rim in Str. IX might belong to such a vessel as well. The rim is thickened and everted, with a rounded top and a slight step below its exterior. Traces of two loop handles are found on the shoulders. The base is narrow, thick and flat; it is not a functional base for such a heavy vessel and it must have been supported by a stand or possibly sunk in the floor. Its capacity is ca. 50 liters. It was found on the floor of Space 716, the northern part of Building 715 ( Timnah II: 51) and was apparently a stationary element that served a specific function in this building, most likely storage. A krater of similar shape and size was found in Str. Ia at Hazor, in a cultic context ( Hazor III-IV: Pl. CCLXXIV: 1-2). A large number of extremely large kraters with broadly similar body profiles, decorated with plastic bands and with four to six handles, were found in the LB palace at Hazor; these are termed "pithos kraters" (or "krater pithoi") and date from the 14th and 13th centuries (Zuckerman 2003: 141-142; Pl. 4.4:10-11; Mullins 2002: 219, Pl. 51:4). Mullins notes that such vessels are essentially a northern phenomenon that begins in MB IIB. However, despite the general similarity in size and proportions of our krater to these, the temporal and spatial differences make it difficult to see an affinity between them. Their similarity may be explained by the fact that both fulfilled Photo 26. KR 7 (Pl. 73:22). the same function, stationary storage in an open vessel. Notably, the Tel Batash krater was found in a domestic context, as opposed to the official palatial and possibly cultic context of the Hazor kraters. Iron I Kraters: KR 7, 9, 15, 2a, 2b KR 7: Necked krater with spout (Photo 26) Str. VIA: Pl. 59:4? Str. V: Pl. 73:6, 22 A closed krater with a short neck, rounded rim top, sloping shoulders and rounded body. In the best-preserved example, two handles extend from rim to the shoulder and a spout with a trefoil rim extends from the neck at an angle of almost 45Â°. Only the three examples in the plates were found; of these, only Pl. 73:22 has an extant spout and it is not certain that the other two originally had a spout as well. Such an appendage seems to have been a functional element that is not particularly related to the shape of the vessel but rather to its desired function. Comparisons to the specific shape of our KR 7 are rare; broad comparisons may be made to vessels from Beth-Shemesh Str. IVa (Ain Shems IV: Pl. LVI:7, 15) and Tell Beit Mirsim Str. B (TBMI: Pl. 50:9).

The rim is short and everted with a plain or slightly molded top. Pl. 79:10 is red-slipped inside and out but not burnished. It is difficult to determine the full shape of this krater 61</page><page sequence="71">CHAPTER TWO type, especially in light of the relative heterogeneity of the shapes included in this type. No direct parallels were found, with the exception of a small rim fragment from the acropolis at Tel Yarmouth, Str. IV (late 12th century) (Jasmin 1999: PL 83:3). KR 15: Large, heavy "barrel krÃ¡ter" Str. V: PL 81:14-15 Two sherds of large, heavy open vessels with thickened hammerhead rims: the rim of Pl. 81:14 is horizontal, while that of Pl. 8 1 : 1 5 angles in. While traces of handles extend from the rim, parallels show that such kraters may have any number of handles between four and ten and it is not certain how many handles our kraters originally had. Pl. 81:14 has a rope decoration below the rim exterior, a trait often found on multiple-handled kraters in Iron I (Amiran 1969: 216). These vessels are common in Iron I contexts (Amiran 1969: 223; e.g. Masos II : Pis. 132:7, 143:8, 150:6-7, Str. III-II). They are the forerunners of the four-handled "barrel kraters", which continue well into Iron II ( Timnah II : 70-71, KR 35). Yannai (1996) views these as the continuation of the LB "krater pithoi" (see KR 5 above). The fact that only two relatively small fragments of such large vessels have survived is indicative of the fragmentary state of preservation of Str. V in general, but may also indicate that this was a rare type in our region at this time. Selected parallels Gezer: Gezer IV: Pl. 26:8 (Str. XIII) Shiloh: Shiloh: Fig. 6.52:6, 8 (Str.

The diameter of these kraters ranges from 20 to 30 cm, with an average of 22.5 cm.43 Though the smaller kraters are approximately the size of large bowls, their rim shape classifies them with the kraters. Most of the bodies are bell-shaped, while a few are more globular (e.g. Pl. 79:3), recalling the profile of our BL 42. Pl. 68:16 recalls the stance of the S-shaped BL 59 and should possibly be related to it. The rim top is either a shelf rim (round-topped or flat, angled in or out) or a hammerhead ( Qasile II: 90). This distinction is the basis for the division into subtypes KR 2a and 2b (see below);44 since there are almost equal numbers of each rim type, this difference is not a significant factor. There are two round-sectioned, well-formed horizontal handles below the rim; one krater with a short vertical band for a handle was questionably included in this type due to its body shape (Pl. 80: 14).45 Bases that could be probably related to this type are all ring bases. Despite the frequency of this type, not one complete profile has been preserved; this is indicative of the nature of the Str. V pottery in general and particularly of the pattern of use and discarding of these kraters as tableware (see also BL 8 above; for a similar phenomenon, see Qasile II: 91). KR 2 is found exclusively in Str. V, in which it is the most common krater, comprising ca. 69% of all the kraters at this time. This phenomenon has also been noted for the Philistine bell-shaped bowl (BL 8 above; see also Dothan 1982: 98). As with that type, this high percentage raises the question of its significance for the question of the ethnic identity of the Str. V town's inhabitants, as well as the prevailing economic or consumer structure. A somewhat degraded form of this krater (KR 3) continues in very small amounts into the early Iron II Str. IV ( Timnah II: 59, 62). At Tell Qasile, Photo 27.

XII but are rare in Str. XI-X ( Qasile II: 104). Bell-shaped kraters with Philistine Bichrome decoration are common in Ashdod Str. XIII-XI and Tel Miqne Str. VI-V. Some 52% are decorated, though this figure may be higher, since registered rims that lacked decoration may have belonged to vessels that are decorated on the body. The decoration is always on the exterior of the vessel, aside from a red band on the rim interior. The most typical decoration (75%) is painted Philistine Bichrome motifs, often well executed and quite elaborate (Dothan 1982: 106). About 18% are painted with red horizontal bands outside and 7% showed vague traces of decoration. This contrasts with the simpler nature of the decoration on the Philistine bell-shaped bowls (our BL 8), which are painted mainly with horizontal red lines and less frequently with monochrome spirals. This is true of other sites containing Philistine pottery as well. In ca. 40% of these kraters, traces of white slip could be discerned; as with the bell-shaped bowls, it is not always clear whether the lack of slip is intentional or due to erosion. It seems that the bell-shaped kraters are more frequently white- slipped than the bowls, perhaps because of the more elaborate bichrome designs that they bear. At Tell Qasile, a thick white slip is common in Str. XII but decreases in Str. XI and almost disappears in Str. X ( Qasile II: 104). It is not certain whether this can be considered a chronological indicator at our site as well. Combinations of the following Philistine motifs are found on our KR 2 (see Dothan 1982: 198-218; Qasile II: 87-105; Dothan and Zukerman 2004: 35-41): running spirals, false antithetical spirals, winged spirals, concentric semicircles, hourglass lozenges, Maltese cross, wavy vertical lines, vertical parallel lines, and a joining motif of horizontal lines surrounded by concentric semicircles. Philistine motifs that do not appear on our bell-shaped kraters are chevrons, scale pattern, tongues, birds, fish, checkerboards, triangles and ladders; some of these, however, may be more typical of closed vessels (see JG 6 below). In light of the relatively small assemblage and its fragmentary nature, it is difficult to trace a deliberate pattern that might suggest selectivity on the part of the potter who decorated these vessels or regionality in the choice of motifs. Such selectivity has been proposed for Tell Qasile, where it seems that a limited number of motifs was used ( Qasile II: 103). In the Philistine repertoire, the possible combinations of motifs are very numerous and were probably the result of free choice on the part of the artist rather than being dictated by functional, regional or other considerations. Perhaps skill played a role in determining the choice of motifs. The dissemination of the motifs could have occurred in several ways, depending on the locale of production of the pottery itself. A local potter could have access to a pattern book or could apprentice himself to a master potter in a Philistine workshop. Alternatively, the vessels (or some of them) could have been imported to Tel Batash from workshops in Philistia proper; subsequently, some degree of imitation could have been carried out by local craftsmen. The overwhelming majority of these kraters were made of the fabric that is most typical of all the Philistine shapes but that was also used to produce local "Canaanite" shapes (FG L). The relationship of KR 2 to KR 1, which continued the LB Canaanite tradition into Iron I, was noted above. Though the Mycenaean antecedents of KR 2 are indisputable (Dothan 1982: 115), it seems that there was mutual influence between the ubiquitous Canaanite krater and the Aegean-style newcomer. Essentially, the general form and rim shape of the former lends itself well to the characteristics of the bell-shaped krater: the softly carinated body and thickened rim that is often ledge or hammer shaped and the wide space available for decoration on the upper body. Thus, the bell-shaped krater, though an innovative shape for the Canaanite consumer, entered a market that had been familiar with elements such as horizontal handles and decoration on kraters since the LB (Amiran 1969: 134). Notably, while Iron I Canaanite carinated kraters were sometimes made with horizontal handles, no Philistine bell-shaped krater with loop handles has been found. Noteworthy also is the interaction in decoration, with some bell-shaped kraters being painted with Canaanite motifs (e.g. Gezer I: PI. 28:24, Str. XIV; Gezer IV: PI. 36:10, 18, Str. Xl; Ashdod //-///: Figs. 1:4; 3:1, Str. XIII-XI; Ashdod V: Fig. 44:2, Str. Xb; Azor: Dothan 1982: Fig. 10:3). Another aspect of this interaction is found in kraters from Qasile Str. X that are shaped like our KR 1 but have red slip and black painted spirals reminiscent of the Philistine spiral motif (Qasile II: 45-^6, KR Type IB; Dothan 1982: 197-198). This suggests that there were common manufacturing centers with each production line influencing the other in fabric, shape and, to a lesser extent, decoration. The question of the significance of this phenomenon, in light of the relative frequencies of each type, will be discussed in the Summary. Parallels for this krater are found generally at the same sites as the bell-shaped bowls (see BL 8 above and Dothan 1982: 107-115). At sites outside Philistia and its close environs that yielded Philistine pottery, such 63</page><page sequence="73">CHAPTER TWO kraters are relatively rare; though based only on meager published material, it seems that they are somewhat less common than the bell-shaped bowl. Gilboa et al. (2006) note that Philistine Bichrome closed vessels are more common than open forms (kraters and bell-shaped bowls) on the northern coast, while at inland hill-country sites the open forms (especially kraters) are more frequent.

V silo: Pl. 69:13 Str. V-IV: Pl. 83:18-19 These are rim and body sherds with a shelf-like rim top, which is mainly at an angle, but may also be horizontal. In a few cases (e.g. PI. 72:2), the differentiation between KR 2a and 2b is indistinct. KR 2b: Hammerhead rim Str. VI-V: PI. 65:2-5 Early Str. V: Pis. 68:17; 69:3 Str. V: Pis. 69:6,8; 75:24, 26; 77:12; 78:6 Post-Str. V: PI. 70:16 Str. V-IV: PI. 71:20 These are rim and body sherds with a hammerhead rim top. KR 2: Body sherds Early Str. V: Pis. 66:2; 67:16; 68:5 Str. V: Pis. 62:2; 78:7-8? These are body sherds or bases that could not be assigned to either KR 2a or 2b. In some instances, it is difficult to discern for certain whether the sherd belonged to a krater or a jug (see JG 6 below), and this too is significant when considering the nature of production of the Philistine repertoire. Red-slipped and Hand-burnished Kraters: KR 14, 14c, 17 These are rim sherds of types that are common in Iron II and are fully described in Timnah II (references below). KR 14: Carinated krater with thickened rim Str. V-IV: Pis. 83:20; 84:1 KR 14 is the most common krater in Str. IV at Tel Batash. It is a medium-sized to large vessel with a soft carination and a thickened hammerhead rim. Two or four loop handles extend from the rim to the carination. Most of the Str. IV examples are red-slipped and hand- burnished inside and out ( Timnah II : 62, 64). Since the two examples presented in the plates here belong to mixed Str. V-IV loci, this probably should not be considered a valid Str. V type. However, it is evident in view of the morphological affinity to KR 1 (the LB krater that continues into Iron I), that KR 1 is a forerunner of this krater. This is especially evident in the subtype KR 14c. KR 14c: Carinated krater with angled-in ledge rim Str. V: Pis. 72:3; 81:13; 83:10 Three small rim sherds of kraters with an angled-in rim and tapering rim top. There is a slight bulge below the rim exterior. PI. 81:3 is red-slipped inside and out. This is the shape defined in Str. IV as subtype KR 14c ( Timnah II: 63-64, where it was noted that it continues an earlier rim shape). Note the similarity of this rim stance to some of the kraters classified with the generic LB type KR 1 in Str. V (e.g. PI. 70:10). As noted above, this subtype emphasizes the continuity of general shape from KR 1. KR 17: Carinated krater with plain rim Str. V: Pis. 73:5; 78:11?; 79:14 Only three examples of this Str. IV type were found in Str. V, one of which is typologically uncertain. All three are red-slipped and hand-burnished, a rare feature in Str. V; it is not certain whether this is a valid Str. V type ( Timnah II' 65). Krater Varia Following are sherds of kraters that could not be classified according to the above type series: Str. XI Pl. 7:4: A rim and upper body fragment of a short-necked krater with a hole made before firing under the neck. A remnant of what might have been a spout remains above the hole. This krater is not classified with KR 7 (above), since the spout here is uncertain and the chronological discrepancy is great. A very similar rim with remains of a spout below ( Hazor II: PI. CXVI:18) is dated to LB I, a period in which kraters with spouts are common at Hazor ( Hazor II: 107-108). Another example of LB IA from Beth-Shean can be cited (Mullins 2002: PI. 27:3, 64</page><page sequence="74">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V Str. Rib). Spouts on kraters are common in MB II as well {Qashish: Fig. 89:16). Str. X Pl. 11:3: A flaring rim above a rounded shoulder; the vessel is very large, with a diameter of over 40 cm. Though the stance is similar to CP 2 (below), the sherd is not made of the typical fabric of all the other cooking pots of this stratum and is thus classified as a krater. Str. VII PL 39:7: A rim and sloping shoulder of a krater with an inverted stance. The rim is slightly thickened and everted. Prominent wheel marks are visible inside. Str. V PL 61:15: A small rim and body sherd with a slightly inverted stance and a small thickened rim. Though classified as a krater, it might have belonged to a holemouth jar. COOKING POTS (Fig. 4; Table 23) MB and Transitional MB-LB Cooking Pots: CP 16, 17,2 CP 16: Hand-made, straight-walled cooking pot MB: PI. 1:1? Str. XII: Pl. 5:14-15 Str. XI: Pl. 7:8 These are small sherds of hand-made, straight-walled cooking pots with a flat base. Two sherds have perforations below the rim; none has the typical plastic rope decoration below the rim or below the perforations, though this may simply be due to their fragmentary preservation. Pl. 1 : 1 is included in this type since, despite its everted stance, it is made of the fabric that is typical of this particular cooking pot. There are several examples from other sites of straight-walled cooking pots with a similar everted stance ( Aphek I: Fig. 10.10:23, Str. AXIV, with holes; Maeir 1997: 100, CP 1, PI. 13:10; Beth-Shean, Str. R3, with plastic decoration). This type is rare at our site, represented only by the four rims presented in the plates (though in general the amount of MB II material uncovered is limited). The cooking pot with vertical or upright wall is well known throughout MB II in the entire country, though it appears to become progressively less common towards the end of MB II, especially at northern sites ( Shechem 1: 64; Maeir 1997: 100-102; Edelstein et al. 1998: 43; Bonfil in preparation). The presence of holes under the rim (with a plastic band below) is most typical of MB IIA and becomes less common in MB IIB, while the type with a plastic band below the rim is more typical of MB IIB (Amiran 1969: 102; Gonen: 83). However, recent studies show that perforated examples appear sporadically until the end of MB II, especially in the south (Singer 1983: 193-194; Maeir 2000: 38; Qashish: 201). Our two perforated rims come from a Str. XII context. The coexistence of hand-made straight-sided cooking pots and wheel-made rounded cooking pots (see CP 17, CP 2 below) may reflect different, though contemporary, culinary practices, as well as separate production modes (Maeir 1997: 101). CP 17: Cooking pot with globular body and molded rim Str. XII: Pl. 5:16 Str. XI: Pl. 7:7, 9-21 Rim and body sherds of a wheel-made cooking pot with a molded (rounded or squared) or rolled-back rim; several rims are everted as well. The rim sometimes has a concave or gutter interior. Though no complete examples are preserved, the parallels indicate that the body was globular with a semi-closed holemouth stance ( Qashish : 201 , 284-286; Type GCP I-IV). All are made, of a variation of the common LB cooking pot fabric, different from the fabric of CP 16 above. PL 7:7 has one extant handle rising above the rim, but the fragmentary nature of our cooking pot and suggested parallels makes it difficult to determine whether there were one or even two handles; handle are a relatively rare feature on this type of cooking pot: see Cole 1984: 65). PL 7:7 also has a small hole under the rim, drilled after firing. Another feature noted on two examples is red paint: PL 7:9 has a band of dark red paint along the rim that dripped down inside; PL 7:10 is red-slipped or painted on the entire extant upper exterior. Such treatment appears to be relatively uncommon on cooking pots of this and other types. This type of cooking pot is common at sites throughout the country in MB IIA and IIB.46 Maeir (2000: 37-38) claims that it became less common in the final stages of MB IIB (especially in the north), apparently being replaced by the cooking pot with carinated body and plain everted rim that heralds the typical LB cooking pot (our CP 2, see below; Qashish: 285).

E-D, and Beth-Shemesh, where CP 17 is found in Str. V and CP 2 in Str. IVA (see parallels below). There is a broad morphological affinity between CP 17 and CP 2 ( Aphek I: 113). The reason for the gradual replacement of the former with the latter is unknown and might be related to technological developments, external influence or (minor?) changes in culinary practice.

IX: Pl. 18:2 This type is the forerunner of the ubiquitous LB cooking pot (see CP 1 below). Like the latter, the few preserved profiles from Str. X show a softly carinated body with a broad rounded base and a fairly open stance. However, CP 2 does not have the typical triangular rim exterior of the later vessels, but rather an elongated plain everted rim with a rounded or flat top. Sometimes the rim exterior is slightly thickened and has a slight inner gutter (Pis. 11:13; 15:3). Of the ten examples whose fabric was examined, five were made of the fabric (FG P3) most commonly used for the generic LB cooking pot, CP 1. The only complete example (PI. 15:3) had a capacity of ca. 4 liters. It seems that the lower part of this vessel was made in a mold, while the upper part was coiled or wheel-turned. This type first appears in Str. X, in which it is the most common type (17 examples, 52%). Three rims (12%) of this type, which might be residual, were found in Str. IX. This vessel is contemporary with the initial appearance Photo 28. CP 2 (PI. 15:3). 67</page><page sequence="77">CHAPTER TWO of CP 1, of which there are 13 examples in Str. X (39%). Thus, the two types are relatively well represented together during this transitional MB-LB phase and, as mentioned above, there is also an affinity in their fabric. CP 2 represents the late MB cooking pot tradition as it develops into CP 1, the quintessential LB carinated cooking pot with triangular rim. This development from CP 2 to CP 1 is gradual, bridging the transition from MB to LB ( Gezer V : 73; Qashish : 285). The reason for the change is obscure, though it is possible that the triangular rim exterior was initially introduced to facilitate gripping and eventually coalesced into a stylistic feature. The broad rounded base is conducive to the conduction of heat, though it is not clear whether the carinated body shares this property or is a result of the general trend towards carinated shapes. The carinated body might be a result of the manufacturing technique, with the lower body being made in a mold and the upper part added by coils or turning (see CP 1 below). This cooking pot is found in contexts throughout the country (Maeir 1997: CP 4d, globular bodies; see selected parallels below). Though its initial appearance may have been as early as MB IIA, it becomes a common shape only in late MB IIB (Cole 1984: 65-67; Maeir 1997: 103). It appears in Str. IXA-VIIB at Tel Qashish, dated to MB IIB-LB I, after which it disappears (Qashish: 285, CP I). At Beth-Shean this type is found mainly in the late MB II-LB I Str. R3-2 (Maeir 1997: 104; Mullins 2002: 223-224; CP la) and becomes rare in the LB IB Str. lb (Maeir 1997: PI. 22:1, 3). After LB I such rims are extremely rare.

V: Pl. 74:12-14 This is the generic LB cooking pot, appearing in a number of rim and body variations. After close inspection, it was decided that these features are mainly the result of specific manufacturing conditions or functions rather than representing significant chronological or regional traits; most were found together in the same contexts at our site and others as well (Killebrew 1999: 91). Since it is unwieldy to classify each peculiarity of manufacture as a separate subtype, most of the rim variants are included in only two broad categories, and other nuances will be mentioned in the discussion below. The cooking pots from the LB strata comprise one of the largest collections of such vessels from this period. Altogether 43 complete or nearly complete vessels were restored and measured for capacity (for descriptions of Photo 29. CP 1 (PL 40:5). 68</page><page sequence="78">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V the method, see Steinbach 2006; Karasik and Smilansky 2006). These include two from Str. X, two from Str. IX, 28 from Str. VIII, nine from Str. VII and two from Str. VI (Table 24). The general concept of this cooking pot is an open or slightly restricted "bowl" with a wide rounded base, a carination on the upper body and an everted rim that has a triangular exterior or flange. Their method of production is debated: either they were entirely wheel- made or, as noted above (CP 2), a mold-made base was combined with a coil- or wheel-made upper part (Franken and Kalsbeek 1969: 119, discussing Iron I cooking pots; Maeir 1997: 102; Magrill and Middleton 1997: 70-71; Killebrew 1999: 106). Most of the rims on our vessels are of the pinched or overhanging type, but pressed-in (PI. 21:15) and indented (PI. 40:8) rims are also represented. Some rims have sharp edges, while others are blunt or trimmed. The soft carination above mid-body usually protrudes beyond the line of the rim exterior, though there are less restricted examples as well Table 24. Capacity of cooking pots, Str.

(e.g. PL 28:7). In Str. X the body of this vessel tends to be rounder (e.g. Pis. 11:19; 15:6), while later vessels are more carinated. The base is usually broad and rounded, though in some cases it tapers towards the center (see PI. 34: 14); Mullins (2002: 222) postulated that this might be a southern trait, as it is relatively rare in the north. None have handles or decoration. The average proportions are 1 : 1 .8, though several deeper pots are found (e.g. PL 21:1-12, proportions ca. 1 : 1 .4). The size range is medium to large, with the diameter ranging from 25 to 30 cm. The average capacity is 5.5 liters, most within a range of 6-8 liters. This figure excludes the very large and very small examples detailed below (Table 24). These larger examples (Pis. 21 : 1 1-13; 27: 15; 37: 10) are found in Str. VIII (and one in Str. X, Pl. 11:19); their diameter ranges from 35 to 40 cm and the capacity of these large pots is ca. 1 1-15 liters. The massive pot shown in Pl. 1 1 : 19 has a capacity of ca. 32 liters, and one from Str. VIII (Pl. 21:15) a capacity of ca. 3 1 liters. Ethnographic parallels point to the use of such large cooking pots on special occasions, such as ritual feasting (Dietler and Hay den 2001); see further Chapter IV. Such extremely large cooking pots seem to be uncommon in the LB, though note several similar-sized cooking pots from Hazor (Hazor II : PI. CXLII:2; Zuckerman 2003: PL 4.5:5; LB II) and those attributed to Fosse Temples I- III at Lachish ( Lachish II : Pis. LV:352, 257-258; LVI.362, 363, 368).47 In addition, a number of much smaller examples were found in Str. VIII (Pis. 28:7-9), Str. VII (Pis. 2:3-4; 4:7) and Str. VI (PL 59:14); their diameter averages 15-20 cm, with a capacity of 0.5-1 .3 liters (Table 24). Small cooking pots were found at Hazor as well (Hazor I: Pis. CXVI: 13-16, MB II; CXXXIX:7-8, LB I; Hazor II: Pl. CXXXVIIL1, Str. IB). These might have been used for specialized cooking of small amounts, such as for children, or to heat medicines (De Boer and Lathrop 1979: 105). An interesting feature of these cooking pots is that the overwhelming majority of examples found in Str. X-VII are made of the same fabric (FG P3). In Str. VI, while six of the 1 1 examples examined were also made this fabric, five were made of FG P4, which becomes more common in Str. V. This change, however, did not affect the shape of the cooking pot, like the changes in the fabric of KR 1 (above). Thus, the manufacture of these vessels, in shape and fabric alike, remained conservative over a long period. Several of these cooking pots (e.g. PI. 28:8) are distorted, apparently during manufacture; this apparently did not prevent their use. CP 1 first appears in Str. X, in which 13 examples 69</page><page sequence="79">CHAPTER TWO comprise 39% of the cooking pots at this time; as mentioned above, it coexists with CP 2 in this stratum. In Str. IX it greatly increases to 80% of the cooking pot types, while in Str. VIII-VI it is the only type that occurs. There is virtually no morphological change over this extended period. In Str. V, this type declines to only 11% (ten examples) of the cooking pots. Though more than half of these are found in relatively secure Str. V contexts, they are all only small rim sherds and it is difficult to say whether this is a valid Str. V type at Tel Batash, or whether they were in secondary deposition. The last vestiges of the everted-rim cooking pot can be found in various Iron I contexts, especially in the earlier contexts of the central hill country (e.g. Giloh : 21, Fig. 7:1-5, 7-8, 11, 13) For somewhat later appearances in Iron I see; Shiloh : 156, Fig. 6.47:4-5; Qasile II : 52, Str. XII; 'Izbet Sartah : 64, Cooking Pot Type 11 (and parallels there). Several small everted-rim sherds were found in loci attributed to the 12th century at Tel Yarmouth (Jasmin 1999: Pis. 75:9; 77:13). Despite sundry later appearances, by the end of the 12th century it had virtually disappeared (see below, CP 4; Killebrew 1999: 91). Thus, though the evidence shows that such cooking pots could have been in use during the early part of Iron I A, our date of Str. V in the later 12th and 11th centuries ( Timnah II: 274) points to the possibility that these ten sherds are intrusive. This cooking pot had a longevity and widespread distribution equivalent to those of KR 1 (above), both at our site and throughout the country. Its body shape begins to appear in MB IIB, while the everted triangular rim is found throughout the entire LB, continuing into the early Iron I in limited contexts. The basic conservatism and homogeneity of the cooking pot in shape and fabric is noteworthy, especially in light of changes that took place in other aspects of the ceramic repertoire during this long period, from Str. X to Str. VI. It seems that both KR 1 and CP 1 , which played a pivotal role in food preparation and cooking, remained basically stable throughout the entire second half of the second millennium. This is most likely due to unchanging culinary habits during this time. Numerous parallels can be stated for the variations of this type, as it is the most common cooking pot in the LB throughout the country (Amiran 1969: 135, PI. 42; see references in Killebrew 1999: 85-91; Mullins 2002: 223-227). CP la: Short, square rim exterior Str. X: Pl. 11:17 Str. IX: Pl. 18:1,3 This subtype lacks a distinct triangular rim exterior and the rim is rather short and square. This is a rare type, represented only by three examples, one in Str. X and two in Str. IX. These may be compared to rims from Gezer (i GezerlV : PI. 12:7, 6, Str. XVI-XV; Gezer V : PL 8:34, Cave 1. 10A, post-burial phase) and Tel Harassim (Givon 1992: PI. 15:4, Str. V), though these are somewhat later than ours. Iron I Cooking Pots: CP 6, 4a-c, 15 CP 6: "Krater-shaped" cooking pot Str. VIA: PI. 59:5 Str. V: Pl. 62:5 Though one example belongs to Str. VIA and one to Str. V, this type is presented with the Iron I cooking pots. Since only these two examples were found, it is difficult to determine the validity of this type in either stratum. The distinct feature of this vessel is its folded-over rim exterior, lacking the typical triangle that characterizes both LB and Iron I cooking pots. Both examples are large, reaching 30 cm in diameter. PI. 59:5 is an almost complete profile with a pronounced protruding carination in the upper third of the body. The rim stance is slightly everted; the rim top tapers and the exterior is very lightly dented, a result of smoothing to finish it. It is unknown whether the base was rounded like those of cooking pots or a ring or disc base like those of kraters. A noteworthy feature of these two vessels is the difference in fabric: while PI. 59:5 is made of FG D, which is not a cooking pot fabric, PI. 62:5 is made of the most typical cooking pot fabric (FG P3), though it is fired to a lighter color and metallic consistency. Thus, the two criteria that determine whether a vessel should be defined as a cooking pot (shape and fabric) are ambivalent in the case of CP 6. This situation is found in other vessels as well. As examples, we may cite a red-slipped carinated bowl with handles from Megiddo that is defined as a cooking pot on the grounds of its fabric ( Megiddo III. 218, Fig. 9. 14:8), and a vessel shaped like a cooking pot made of non-cooking-pot fabric from Beth-Shean Str. R2 that is defined as a krater (Mullins 2002: 218-219, PI. 51:2). Such vessels were perhaps interchangeably used for cooking and food preparation as well as serving; the strict morphological and technological traits that we tend to use to characterize vessels are not always entirely valid. Note a similar rim and vessel size on a cooking pot from Str. X at Tell Qasile ( Qasile II' Fig. 44:24). The 70</page><page sequence="80">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V rim and body stance are also generally reminiscent of a group of handleless kraters typical of late Iron I and Iron IIA northern contexts, such as Horbat Rosh Zayit (Gal and Alexandre 2000: 40), Tel Rehov (Mazar 2003: Fig. 18:10-11) and Megiddo (Megiddo II: PI. 29:110). However, since our vessels are larger and somewhat more sharply carinated as well as regionally disparate, they are seemingly unrelated. CP 4a-c: Cooking pot with vertical rim, triangular on the exterior CP 4a Early Str. V: Pis. 67:12; 69:4 Str. V: Pis. 62:9; 70:12; 78:13; 79:15; 81:16 Post-Str. V silo: PI. 69:14 CP 4b Str. V: Pis. 62:10; 72:6, 17, 19; 81:19 CP 4c Early Str. V: Pl. 66:3 Str. V: Pis. 62:11; 72:20; 73:8; 78:12; 81:17-18 This shape is a continuation of the typical long-lived Canaanite cooking pot (Killebrew 1999: 84). In general, the partially open stance and carinated body remain the same. However, the change to a vertical rim stance and the beginning of the addition of handles mark a departure that is one of the hallmarks of the transition to the Iron Age. Despite a small degree of overlap with the LB everted-rim cooking pot (see above, CP 1 , and below), this transition is relatively abrupt (Franken and Kalsbeek 1969: 1 19). The question is whether this change in rim stance is the result of technological innovations or regressions, changing culinary practices, population shifts, or other adaptive factors (Rice 1984b: 245-246; 1 987 : 27 1 ). Just as the cooking pot remained conservative and basically homogeneous throughout the country during the LB, the modified rim shape and addition of handles is common in the north, south and coast alike in Iron I. Though this change most likely occurred at somewhat different rates in different regions, it seems to have been a broadly consistent and simultaneous phenomenon with very few regional distinctions. If indeed changes in cooking pot shape are to be related mainly to changes in cuisine and food preparation (Killebrew 1999: 106-109), the portent of this shift at the beginning of the Iron Age is considerable. Innovations of this sort are "risky" and most likely will be made only if the potters are quite certain that the consumer will buy the product. Arnold (1985: 228-230) contends that such a "risk" is more easily taken when production is carried out in a workshop or industrial setting, where the workshop owner is apt to take responsibility for marketing and possible losses. Alternatively, such a change, especially if it came in the wake of different culinary practices, could have been produced at a household/household workshop level to answer such needs. This common function would generate a basic similarity while at the same time allowing for minor variations (Balfet 1965). The fact that the rim shape changed so consistently in Iron I has implications for the type of pottery industry and distribution mechanisms that were in existence at the time. Though generally the state of ceramic preservation of Str. V is poor, it is noteworthy that the cooking pots are among the most fragmentary types found. The vast majority are only small rim sherds and only in a few cases is a profile preserved down to the carination (e.g. PL 69: 14). This phenomenon most likely reflects the high breakage and discard rate of cooking pots due to intensive use (Arnold 1985: 153). This is especially true of the base, which would be the weakest spot of the cooking pot, being exposed to fire and more apt to crack (Franken and Kalsbeek 1969: 244). It is thus difficult to achieve conclusive and meaningful categories of subdivision, especially for body shape, and this should perhaps be defined as a group rather than a homogeneous type; this is especially true in light of the many variations found in the shape of the rim at all sites throughout the country. Almost all examples of our CP 4 have a vertical rim stance, apart from a few (e.g. PI. 81:16) with an inverted stance and three examples (Pis. 62:8, 67:11 and 72: 1 8, designated "CP 4?") whose everted rims may be a vestigial feature of the LB cooking pot tradition (see discussion of CP 1 above; Giloh : 21; Qasile II: 52; Greenberg 1987: 65) or simply a random quirk of manufacture. Parallels show that there are numerous variations among the vertical cooking pot rims of Iron I (Killebrew 1999: 92; Qasile II: 52-53) and at Tel Batash the different variations seem to have coexisted. We may note the following variations of the (mostly elongated) triangular exterior found at our site: CP 4a: The rim overhangs and sometimes has a slightly upturned edge ( Qasile II: 52-53, CP lb; Killebrew 1999: Type CA19a). This is the most common subtype, comprising ca. 72% of the total of CP 4 (45 examples). Variations of this particular rim shape are the most common among the published Iron I cooking pots throughout the country. 71</page><page sequence="81">CHAPTER TWO CP 4b: The rim is pressed in with a very narrow triangle ( Qasile II: 53, CP lc). This subtype is rare and is represented only by the five examples in the plates (8% of the total of CP 4). CP 4c: The rim has an overhanging triangular exterior with a concave interior ( Qasile II: 53, CP Id; Killebrew 1999: 92, Type CA19b). This subtype comprises 20% of the total of CP 4 (1 1 examples). This rim is similar to our CP 15 (see below) but is distinguished from it by the overhanging exterior, which relates it to CP 4. It is generally accepted that rim length has chronological significance, with the short rim being more characteristic of the early 12th century and the elongated rim (ca. 1-1 .5 cm long) representing a development of the second half of this century, when it is still relatively rare, becoming common only in the 11th century and continuing well into Iron IIA ( Qasile II: 52-53; Ilan 1999: 79).48 While indeed the cooking pot rims of later Iron I contexts are elongated, e.g. at Tell Beit Mirsim (Greenberg 1987: 76, late phase of Str. B2 silos), Tell Qasile ( Qasile II: 52-53, Str. XI-X) and Shiloh {Shiloh: Fig. 6.52:11-14, Str. V), such rims are also found in earlier 12th-century contexts, such as Giloh, where they were considered "shorter than the fully developed Iron Age I cooking pot rims" ( Giloh : 23; Fig. 7:8-9, 12). However, measurement of these rims in comparison with rims from Qasile Str. XII-XI did not show a significant difference in length. If we accept the first half of the 12th century as the date for Iron I phases A-D at Deir 4 Alia, there are additional examples of elongated rims in such an early context (Franken and Karlsbeek 1969: 244-245; see, however, Qasile II: 52 for reservations about this early date). Several long rims come from Lachish Str. VI (Lachish V: PI. 39:14-17) and one from Taanach Period IA ( Taanach I: Fig. 2:8). Moreover, short rims can, albeit rarely, be found in later Iron I contexts together with elongated rims (e.g. Shiloh: Fig. 6.52:9; Qasile II: Figs. 27:12, 20; 44:27, Str. XI-X; see also our PI. 67:12). Thus, the elongated rim, while basically a valid criterion, is not a watertight reason to date assemblages to the later part of Iron I and should be further examined, preferably on a quantitative basis ( Gezer IV: 78, n. 126). Additional factors, ceramic and otherwise, should of course be taken into consideration.49 An additional chronological criterion that has been noted for these cooking pots is the addition of handles, which is very rare in Iron I, with only a few examples occurring in contexts of the 1 1th century ( Qasile II: 53). Only two examples of our CP 4 had handles: Pis. 66:3, from an early Str. V context, and PI. 69:1, from a silo that contained much Str. V material, including Philistine Bichrome, but cut a Str. V wall and thus is defined as a Post-Str. V context ( Timnah I: 80). Thus, handles on CP 4 are virtually non-existent in Str. V and became common only in Str. IV (see below, CP 15, and Timnah II: 83). It is not clear whether this should be considered a chronological indicator or a regional feature, especially since handles were found on a small amount of Iron I cooking pots at other sites, such as at Gezer Str. XIII-XI, Beth-Shemesh Str. III and Shiloh Str. V. This lack might simply be the result of the fragmentary nature of the finds in Str. V. CP 4 comprises 68% (62 rims) of the cooking pots in Str. V, making it the most frequent cooking pot of the stratum. There are slightly more typological variations in the cooking pots of Str. V than in those of the LB, though basically these are limited to minor differences in the treatment of rim and neck (see CP 6, 15) or the (rare) addition of handles (for a similar phenomenon at Tell Deir 'Alia, see Franken and Kalsbeek 1969: 119). While the reason behind typological and technological diversity in cooking pots is often related to varying culinary practices, which may be affiliated with ethnic identity (Killebrew 1999; Bunimovitz and Yasur-Landau 1996), it seems that this is not the case at Tel Batash, since there is a basic morphological similarity between the three Iron I cooking pot types (CP 4, 6 and 15). There is a certain difference in their fabric composition: half of the CP 4 examples that were examined are made of the typical LB cooking-pot fabric (FG P3), while the other half are made of fabrics that are common in Iron I cooking pots (FG P4, P5). However, the minor diversity within these contemporary vessels contrasts with the distinct typological and technological differences between the Canaanite-type cooking pot and the Aegean-type cooking jug that were noted for various sites in Philistia, such as Tel Miqne and Ashdod (Killebrew 1999; Dothan and Zukerman 2004: 34-35).50 This type continues in very small amounts into the Iron IIA Str. IV ( Timnah II: 80-81; see also parallels for Iron I there); at this time, CP 15 replaces it as the dominant cooking pot. At numerous other sites, cooking pots like our CP 4, often with the addition of handles, are ubiquitous in contexts of the 10th and 9th centuries (i Qasile II: 5-53). The virtual absence of this type at Tel Batash at this time is noteworthy (see CP 15 below). Non-triangular Rim Cooking Pot: CP 15 This cooking pot type is prevalent in Str. IV but first appears in Str. V, as discussed in Timnah II. It continues the 72</page><page sequence="82">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V concept of the typical Iron I cooking pot in body shape and rim stance, but differs in its lack of an external triangular rim and the addition (in most cases) of handles. CP 15: Cooking pot with concave interior Str. V: Pis. 73:23; 76:1; 77:14 Str. V-IV: PL 84:2 In this type the rim is pushed out, forming a concave interior. The average rim diameter is 30 cm, similar to that of CP 4. Only small rim sherds have been preserved in Str. V and thus none were measured for capacity. Though we previously stated ( Timnah II : 83) that Iron I examples lack handles, this must now be amended (e.g. Pis. 66:3; 84:2); comparisons can be found in Gezer Str. XI {Gezer I: PI. 26:9; Gezer II : PI. 30:7) and Beth- Shemesh Str. III (Am Shems IV : PL LXII:31). This type first appears in Str. V, in which the 18 examples found comprise 20% of the cooking pots. In this stratum it coexisted with CP 4, the most common Iron I cooking pot. There is a definite affinity to subtype CP 4c (see above) and the criterion of an overhanging rim exterior for the latter is not always clear-cut. CP 15 continues into Str. IV in large amounts and replaces CP 4 as the dominant cooking pot at that time. In Str. IV, CP 15 is subdivided into CP 15a and 15b, based on a vertical or inverted rim stance ( Timnah II: 81, 83). The inverted rim stance is not found in our Str. V. This is Qasile Cooking Pot Type 251 ( Qasile II : 53), found in Str. XII-XI and IX, and 'Izbet Sartah Cooking Pot Type 14, found in rather small amounts in Str. II- I {'Izbet Sartah' 67-68). It can be found at other Iron I sites, mainly in the south. The few examples from Shiloh Str. V are somewhat different. This is a rare rim shape in the north; none are published from Hazor Str. XII, Megiddo Str. VIIA-VI, Tell Keisan Str. IX or Beth-Shean Level VI. Thus, it can be considered a type that bridges the transition from Iron I to Iron II, common mainly in the Shephelah and Negev (Greenberg 1987: 75-76). The fact that CP 4 (a type common throughout the country) is dominant in Str. V, as opposed to the frequency of CP 15 (a type common mainly in the Shephelah and Negev) in Str. IV, might imply more restricted regional ceramic distribution in Iron IIA than previously. Selected parallels Beth-Shemesh: Ain Shems IV: Pis. LIX:17; LXII:27, 31 (Str.

Baking trays Str. XI: PL 7:5 Str. V: PL 72:16 These are the only two baking trays recovered from the entire excavation at Tel Batash. The identification of Pl. 7:5 (Str. XI) as a baking tray is not secure; while it is made of cooking pot fabric, its stance is not typical. Pl. 72:16 (Str. V) is the lower rim and part of the body. It is smoothly finished, with no traces of the pockmarking often found on baking trays in the Iron Age. It is made of typical cooking pot material, but shows no traces of burning. Baking trays occur regularly in the MB (Bonfil in preparation), and our fragment from Str. XI fits this horizon. During the LB such objects are virtually non- existent, though they reappear in Iron I (e.g. ' Izbet Sartah: Fig. 12: 1 1 , Str. m), becoming more common in Iron H.

Str. XI: Pis. 8:1-3; 5:6-7 Str. XII-XI: PI. 5:5, 8 Str. X: PI. 13:11 This is a storage jar with a molded or profiled rim, typical of MB II throughout the country (Maeir 1997: 107, SJ 3d; PI. 21:1-3). The rim is either vertical or slightly everted, molded on both the interior and the exterior, or only on the exterior. At Tel Batash only rims and necks are preserved, a situation that is typical of Str. XII-XI in general. Thus we cannot establish the jar's body shape or whether it had handles. Parallels (see below) suggest an ovoid body with a rounded or flattened base. The average rim diameter is 15 cm; those with a larger diameter (e.g. PL 5:17) may have belonged to pithoi, with or without handles (Amiran 1969: 102-103; Bonfil 1992; Maeir 1997: 110, PT 3, PI. 23-26; Qashish : 290). This is the most common storage jar type in Str. XII-XI (52%). Eight small rims (13% of the jars) of this type, which may be residual, were found in Str. X and represent the last appearance of the type. Selected parallels Gezer: Gezer /: Pis. 30:17 (Str. XVIII); 31:8-10 (Str. XIX) Tell Beit Mirsim: TBMIa : Pl. 14:10 (Str.

Only in PI. 12:7 are the neck and rim preserved; the neck is short and the rim is plain and everted with a slight thickening of the rim exterior. This rim might be compared to Maeir 's PT 2a, which is a rare type at late MB IIB Beth-Shean (Maeir 1997: 1 10, PI. 23:3); the rim is also somewhat similar to our PT 1 , though smaller (see below). Though no complete profile could be restored, Photo 30. SJ 5 (a: PI. 12:4; b: PL 12:7). 75</page><page sequence="85">CHAPTER TWO there is enough evidence to allow us to reconstruct their height as ca. 60 cm, which would point to the definition of a large storage jar or small pithos (Bonfil 1992: 26). The capacity may be estimated as ca. 32 liters. Five jars of this type were found in Building 720; three of these were found together in Locus B1035, the southwestern space of the building, while the fourth was found in Locus 717, the northern room.52 Two main types of fabric could be discerned: three jars were made from a crisp pinkish fabric with dark inclusions and one from a yellowish softer fabric. One "pink" jar analyzed petrographically (PL 12:5) proved to be made from loess of the northern Negev or southern Shephelah. A major characteristic of these jars is their decoration: a thick horizontal band encircles the shoulder, from which vertical bands extend down. There are two kinds of paint, associated with the two different fabric types: the pinkish clay is painted with streaky white bands (PL 12:5-7), while the yellowish clay has streaky black bands (Pl. 12:4). Though the general shape of this vessel conforms to that of the well-known large storage jars and pithoi of MB II, and the element of painting on storage jars is also a common trait at this time, these jars are set apart by their particular type of decoration. It is not certain whether this differentiation had anything to do with the contents or use of these jars. One jar had a thick, peeling, dark-colored encrustation on its interior that may be a residue of its contents. A photograph of Tufnell's Storage Jar Class A, Type 1006 shows similar light-colored bands painted on the upper part of a pithos ( Lachish IV: Pl. 50:34); the drawing of this type ( Lachish IV : Pl. 87:1006) depicts it as a handleless pithos similar to our PT 1 (see below). Three such vessels were found in Lachish Tomb 119, dated to 1700-1600 ( Lachish IV: 228). Such jars were found at Tel Haror as well (E. Oren, personal communication). In view of the pÃ©trographie analysis of a jar of Type SJ 5 noted above, there may have been a production center of these jars in the northern Negev or southern Shephelah. Though of course very different in size, shape and provenience, the bands painted on these jars somewhat recall the composition painted on Cypriot White Painted V jars found at Tel Mevorakh in Str. XIII ( Mevorakh II: 58, Fig. 17:4) and in a tomb at Ashkelon (Gershuny 2002: 187, Fig. 3). S J 1: Ovoid jar with everted, slightly molded rim MB (general) : Pl. 1:5?, 6 Str. XII: PL 5:20-21 Str.

VII: Pl. 2:8 An ovoid storage jar with a moderately flaring medium- sized neck and a slightly thickened or folded-over rim exterior; sometimes there is a low ridge about a third of the way down below the rim exterior. Rim and neck variations include a short flaring neck (PL 12:8, with a ridge at the base of the neck) and a straight neck (Pl. 12:10). Pl. 15:11 has a slightly more thickened rim exterior, which recalls the shape of the LB storage jar SJ 2 (see below), but whose general shape, fabric and characteristics group it with S J 1. The rim diameter ranges from 10 to 12 cm and the five complete or almost complete examples are 50-60 cm high. The body is ovoid with a round or slightly flattened base. Two large loop handles extend from below the shoulders to below mid-body. Rarely, thin horizontal lines are incised on the shoulder. Pl. 15:10 has no handles and its shoulder have a pressed-in distortion caused during manufacture; the vessel is overfired to a metallic consistency. Such a "production mishap" is evident in Pl. 12:10 as well. The capacity of the complete vessels up to the rim are: Pl. 12:8: 28.5 liters; Pl. 12:9: 30.9 liters; Pl. 12:10: 33.7 liters; Pl. 15:10: 30.4 liters; Pl. 15:11: 17.1 liters. Nine rim sherds of this type were found in Str. XII-XI, all of which appear in the plates (36% of the storage jars). Though only the rims of these vessels are preserved, this is typical of all other storage jars in these strata, so it seems that this may be considered a valid type for these strata. Thirteen examples in Str. X include five complete or near-complete vessels; at this time, SJ 1 comprises 23% of the storage jars. In Str. X, when SJ 1 is at its peak, it is found together with SJ 4 (though the eight small rims of the latter may be residual), SJ 5 (which is essentially a small pithos) and S J 2b (14 rims, marking the initial appearance of the generic thickened- rim LB storage jar, see below). It seems that while Str. X demonstrates a degree of typological diversity in storage jars and pithoi (reflecting the transitional nature of this stratum), SJ 1 may be considered a prominent type, especially since complete vessels were found as opposed to rims of the other types. The substantial representation of this well-known MB IIB storage jar in our transitional MB II/LB I Str. X emphasizes the chronological proximity of this stratum to the end of the MB (see below). This is also supported by the fabrics from which SJ 1 is made: more than half of the examples examined were made of FG A and B, the two 76</page><page sequence="86">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V most dominant fabric groups of Str. XII-XI. Five small rim sherds in Str. IX either represent the tail end of SJ 1 or (more likely) are residual, and one rim and neck sherd from Str. VII is either residual or is an accident that occurred during production of a storage jar without a thickened rim. The parallels confirm the gradual decline of this type of jar rim and its disappearance by the end of LB I. This type is similar to Tufnell's Storage Jar Class B- C, assigned to MB II (. Lachish IV: 221, 224). At Aphek, similar jars called "large ovoid jars with elongated rim", mostly with flattened bases (Aphek Type SJ 2), are common throughout MB IIA and early MB IIB, with various rim profiles that are similar to ours (Aphek L 177-178). Such body shapes and rims are also very common in late MB II contexts throughout the country, continuing these traditions from the earlier phases of MB II. Variations of rims of such jars are included in the type called "folded-rim jars" found in the MB IIB Str. IX at Tel Qashish; these do not continue there into Str. VIII of LB I (i Qashish : 290-291 , SJ lib). The widespread presence of this type suggests that these vessels may have been used in trade (Maeir 1997: 107, with parallels).53 Indeed, imported Canaanite jars have been found in Egypt in MB IIA and IIB contexts (Aston 2002: 43-45). The contexts in which our S J 1 were found are in a public building, possibly a citadel, in Str. XII-XI ( Timnah I: 39-41) and what we surmise is part of a large dwelling in Str. X (Building 720; Timnah L 41-45). Thus, such jars might have served for trade, surplus storage and domestic storage alike at our site during MB IIB and the transition to the LB.

CXVIL1-5 (Str. 5) LB Storage Jars: S J 2, 2*, 2a-c/cl; S J 3 (transitional) There is essentially only one storage jar type during the entire LB at Tel Batash. Our division into sub-groups is minor, reflecting traits such as number of handles or decoration rather than shape or manufacture: SJ 2a with a short rim, S J 2b with four handles and S J 2c with painted decoration. SJ 2 is the generic main type; SJ 2* is the designation for those jars that were restored up to the neck and clearly belong to SJ 2 but lack the rim (see typological details below). The general concept of proportions, body shape and rim is a continuation of the ovoid jar of the MB (see S J 1 above), though the LB jar is a coarser, heavier, mass- produced wheel-made version that contrasts with the greater typological diversity and better quality of the former period. The manufacture of thicker-walled jars is often related to the need for durability in transport (Rice 1987: 227; Raban 2001a: 11*); this development may be connected to the increase of trade in the LB. The elaborate molded rims, as well as the more delicate folded over rims, disappear and all the rims are simply thickened and rounded on the outside, some quite sloppy and even distorted. Most jars are not smoothed on the outside and some have quite prominent, often uneven wheel and scrape marks or morsels of clay that were not removed. An indication of the industrial nature of their production was supplied by the restoration process. A relatively large number of jars could not be totally restored, especially those from Str. VII; it was almost impossible to isolate the body sherds, handles and rims of a particular jar since the fabric and manufacture of all were so similar. The size and volumes of these jars are also relatively consistent. They are almost all about 60 cm high. The average capacity (Tables 26-27) of the main type (SJ 2) is ca. 27 liters, while the subtype SJ 2c is generally smaller (average capacity 13 liters) and S J 2a is considerably larger (average capacity 50.88 liters). The average capacity of S J 2 is not far from that of the Biblical "bath", which is equivalent to the Ugaritic "KD" (ca. 22- 77</page><page sequence="87">CHAPTER TWO Table 26.

The so-called "Canaanite" jar or amphora is found in two basic shapes: those like our SJ 2 and jars with more angular shoulders and narrower bases, the latter generally smaller. Both forms played a pivotal role in the international trade of the LB, and are found in the Levant, Cyprus, the Aegean, and Egypt (Grace 1956; Raban 1980: 5*-6*; ÃstrÃ¶m 1991; Cline 1995: 95-97; Bourriau 1990). The numerous jars from the shipwrecks along the Anatolian coast, Cape Gelidoniya and especially Uluburun, provide important evidence of the role these jars played in the international trade in LB II. The capacity of the largest jars from the Uluburun ship is 26.7 liters (Pulak 1997: 240). This is almost identical to the average capacity of our SJ 2, as detailed above (27 liters). This joins the other evidence suggesting that there was not a separate production line for commercial and domestic storage jars, but rather that the vessel was used for transport or household storage as the need arose. Note that the angular-shouldered, narrow-bodied Canaanite jars that are considered trade or commercial vessels by Amiran (1969: 140-142) are also found in domestic contexts, e.g. Beth-Shean Str. VII (Killebrew 1998b: III. 111.10:2; James and McGovern 1993: Fig. 37:2) and Megiddo Str. VIII (Megiddo II: PI. 59:11-12).

It should be noted that the capacity figures obtained by measuring up to the neck as opposed to up to the rim show an average difference of no more than 0.35 liter. Since it is debatable whether storage jars were filled up to the neck or the rim, it was decided to present rim measurements when the latter was preserved and neck measurements for those lacking the rim. 78</page><page sequence="88">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V its contents in domestic and trade situations, it has been suggested that in funerary contexts (especially in the Argolid), such vessels acquired a prestigious significance (Cline 1995: 96). It thus seems that the distinction between "domestic" jars (sometimes painted, e.g. SJ 2c below) and "commercial" jars (usually of the type with angular shoulder and tapering base) is far from clear-cut and the typological and functional interaction represents the complex relationship between various economic spheres in the LB.55 Our S J 2 (with its subtypes) was made of a number of different fabrics, predominantly FG D but also FG A, C and E. Studies have shown that the greatest variety of fabrics is seen in storage jars, a trait ascribed to the use of these containers in local or long-distance trade (Killebrew 1998b: 252). The question remains whether our jars were brought to the site with their contents or were purchased or produced to store household surplus. The presence of so many storage jars in a single household (especially in Str. VIII and lesser so in VII) is a noteworthy phenomenon and is further discussed, along with the subject of the capacity of storage jars, below (pp. 192-193). The short, thickened rim exterior of subtype SJ 2a marks the initial appearance of this jar in Str. X. However, since only rims and necks of this subtype are preserved, the body shape and number of handles is unknown. These rims seem to be a development from SJ 1 (see above) and are the forerunner of the subsequent SJ 2 with its longer thickened rim exterior. The thickened rim appears to be a technical feature that accompanied the more heavy-duty manufacture of this jar, with its generally thicker walls and coarser clay than its MB predecessors (Rice 1987: 227, 241). Only two rim sherds of the main type (SJ 2) were found in Str. X and the bona fide debut of this ubiquitous form is in Str. IX, when it represents 54% of the jars.56 In Str. VIII and VII, SJ 2 with its subtypes is the only storage jar present. Though SJ 2b, the four-handled version of SJ 2, is represented by only three complete jars in Str. VIII, it must be kept in mind that many of the numerous handles that could not be restored to complete jars from Str. VIII and VII could have belonged to such four-handled jars. SJ 2c designates painted jars; these are quite frequent at Tel Batash, making their initial appearance in Str. X (six sherds) and comprising 22%, 26% and 22% of the storage jars respectively in Str. IX, VIII and VII. SJ 2 virtually disappears in Str. VI, in which only five small rim sherds were found. This is a noteworthy phenomenon in light of our assumption that Str. VI should be dated to the 13th and early 12th centuries BCE {Jimnah /: 253; see also pp. 132-134). A slimmer variation with two to four handles is found in contexts of the 13th century near our site, such as Lachish Fosse Temple III, Gezer XV, Aphek X12, Tell el-Far'ah (S), 19th Dynasty contexts. Similar shapes are found as late as transitional LB/Iron I contexts as well, such as Tell Beit Mirsim Str. B1 and Gezer Str. XIV (see parallels below and SJ 3). Thus, this cannot be considered a regional factor. Though this lack might be due to the generally fragmentary nature of Str. VI, other factors (functional, technological, chronological and ideological) should be considered when analyzing this phenomenon. The parallels to this jar show a basic similarity throughout the country during the LB, particularly LB II. Most examples have the ovoid body with tapering base and thickened rim exterior of our S J 2; others have the angular shoulder and narrow tapering body of the so-called "commercial" Canaanite jar. However, despite the homogeneity and conformity of size, shape and manufacture emphasized above, several other variations exist, such as short round bodies that are more typical of northern contexts, mainly in the earlier part of the LB. These are found with and without the thickened rim exterior and are often painted, e.g. our SJ 2c (e.g. at Hazor: Zuckerman 2003: 155-157, SJ I, PI. 4.7: 1-4; Dan II' Fig. 2.56; Beth-Shean: Mullins 2002: 234-235, SJ 1, Variant 1, PI. 54:1); they are considered a continuation of the MB II Canaanite jar.57 SJ 2: Storage jar with thickened rim exterior (Photo 31) Str.

S J 2. the base, which might have been formed separately (Rye 1981: 134-137; Killebrew 1998b: 232-233). PI. 35:10 has an exceptionally long stump base (see Killebrew 1998b: 111. 111.15:22 for a similar base from Deir el- Balah). Two thick loop handles extend from the bottom of the rounded shoulder to just above mid-body, at the point where the body begins to taper. A few jars (e.g. PL 35:2) have a slight ridge on the upper shoulder, near the join of the shoulder to the neck; this trait is found mainly in Str. VIII and on subtype S J 2b (see above) and may be found at other sites as well (e.g. Qashish : Fig. 122:15, Str. VI). The vertical neck is ca. 6 cm high with an average diameter of 10 cm. Though the rim is usually vertical, some (e.g. PI. 22:11) are slightly everted. The rim exterior is always thickened and usually rounded, but flattened in a few cases (e.g. Pis. 22:9; 35:3). In most cases the rim is clearly folded over, though in some a roll of clay was possibly added while pulling up the neck.58 Some jars have a rim distortion, perhaps due to the separate manufacture of body and neck/rim that resulted in different drying rates. Other indications of a modular mode of production may be the ridge marking the join between neck and shoulder and the secondary formation of the base. This assumption of modular production is also supported by the similarity between many of the necks and rims of SJ 2 and JG 2, which are virtually interchangeable (see below).

Since only rim and neck fragments have been preserved, the body shape and number of handles are unknown; we assume that the shape and size may be reconstructed on analogy to the main type, SJ 2. This rim type is most frequent in Str. X and virtually terminates in Str. IX. It may thus be considered the forerunner of the typical Canaanite storage jar with its longer thickened and rounded rim.

VIII Building 475 had four rather than two handles. All have a slight ridge at the join of the neck to the shoulder, a feature found on some examples of SJ 2. These are large heavy jars with capacity of ca. 50 liters, almost twice that of the regular S J 2 (see above, Table 26, for capacity); the addition of two extra handles is possibly related to their weight. Raban (2001a: 13*) suggests that four handles were placed only on large jars that did not take part in the sea trade but were only used for limited intra-regional transfer. If this is so, subtype SJ 2b did not share the versatile nature of SJ 2, which played a role in both maritime trade and domestic storage. As mentioned above, it is impossible to establish whether subtype SJ 2b is in fact more plentiful, since numerous handles could not be restored to a complete jar. Comparable four-handled storage jars mostly date from the latter part of the LB and the early 12th century and appear in numerous southern late LB II/early Iron I contexts (Killebrew 1998: 112-113, Type CA21b). Photo 32. S J 2b (PL 29:1). However, not only are these jars later than our SJ 2b, but they are also somewhat smaller and narrower.61 The four-handled Canaanite storage jars at Batash (SJ 2b), which are much earlier, are not related to these jars and apparently represent a large version of the generic storage jar with two additional handles. The only parallel that seems temporally and spatially valid is from Beth-Shemesh Str. IV (Ain Shems /-//: Pl. XL:3; Beth Shemesh: 17 1 , top left, Tomb 1 1 , Str. IVb). A very large ovoid jar with a wide neck and four handles placed in a semi-equidistant manner may be noted from Lachish Fosse Temple I, where it was found set in the floor (Lachish II: Pl. LVIL384); however, it differs from ours. No northern parallels were found. SJ 2c: Painted storage jar (Photos 33-35) Str. X: Pis. 13:18-19; 14:13 Str. IXA: PI. 19:1-2 Str. IX-VIII: PI. 20:21 Str.

Most of their features are similar to the generic shape of SJ 2. A few have a slight ridge at the join of neck and shoulder (see also S J 2b) and in some cases a sharp ridge below the rim exterior as well. In some examples (e.g. Pl. 30:1) the missing neck/rim is smoothed, apparently to enable the jar to be used after it was broken. Since these painted jars are generally smaller, and FG E was selectively chosen for their fabric, it would seem that they were produced in a separate production line as a result of a conscious a priori decision. The potter did not simply make a jar that was later chosen for decoration, but rather manufactured these jars 82</page><page sequence="92">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V specifically for painting. This apparently represents specialized production, though the exact definition is difficult to identify: production for elite use, relationship between potter and painter, resource specialization, etc. (Rice 1989: 109-110). The characteristic that sets these jars apart, in addition to their generally smaller dimensions, is the red and/or black painted decoration on their exterior. The painting was not always carried out meticulously and the paint has sometimes dripped (e.g. Pis. 30:1; 53:1). The paint was applied directly onto the unslipped and sometimes even unsmoothed surface of the vessel; at Batash there is no sign of the white slip or smoothed surface as a base for the paint that is observed at other sites (Negbi 1989: 58). Some designs are very faint, perhaps indicating that the painting was executed after firing. The designs include horizontal bands, vertical straight and wavy lines that form triglyphs and metopes, ladders, and rarely zoomorphic and anthropomorphic motifs. The palm tree motif is not found on these jars. Handles are painted mainly with intersecting horizontal and vertical lines. The so-called "Union Jack" motif often found on the handles of painted vessels in the LB is rare at Tel Batash (e.g. PL 42:4). The typical body design is composed of three basic elements: horizontal bands on the neck, a design on the shoulder, and a wide horizontal band just below the bottom of the handle, below mid- body. The shoulder design is either horizontal bands or metopes formed by triglyphs of straight and wavy vertical lines; the metopes are usually empty but in one case (PL 25:4) are filled with schematic ibex. Pl. 31:1 from Str. VIII, the smallest of these jars, is unique in shape and decoration. This is a small jar (total preserved height 36.5 cm; it is broken above a ridge on the lower neck). Its entire exterior is painted with a rather crudely executed composite bichrome design62 (Photo 34). Four groups of two black and one red horizontal bands encircle the lower neck and body down to a point above the base (of the uppermost group only one black band is preserved). There is also a single black horizontal band on the lower part of the body. Two black bands frame a wide horizontal frieze at the level of the handles. One face of this wide central panel contains red and black vertical straight and wavy lines, one wide and one narrow ladder pattern painted in red and black, and an unidentifiable object painted with black contour lines, its oval body filled with red. Though this object looks like a jar, the black lines on its left side are enigmatic. The artist perhaps meant to depict an animal, though in this case it would be perpendicular to the horizontal band. Inside the wide panel on the opposite side of the jar is a scene painted only in black. Since its upper part is not fully preserved, the scene cannot be identified. It could be a hunting scene or a procession consisting of two human figures, an unidentifiable line that might be the leg or hindquarters of an animal, and a small animal. The figures all face the right. The human figures are very schematic; the left-hand one is shown with both hands turned to the right, while the second figure has one hand bent at the left side of the body and its right hand is raised, perhaps in blessing or holding an object that is now missing. This figure is dressed in what appears to be a kilt with three tassels. The small animal on the right appears to be a horned quadruped. The freehand, schematic style and unique motifs and composition set this jar apart from the more standardized decoration on the other jars. No parallels could be found for this scene and its composition, though a modicum of similarity to our horned animal may be noted in the rendition of some animals on painted sherds from Gezer: a frieze with red and black birds and horned animals (Macalister 1912b: 175, Fig. 337), a schematic horned animal in a metope (i CPP : 17, G, 1608; 17, G, 167-4) and "stick figure animals" (Macalister 1912c: PL CLXVII:1, 11). Note also a sherd from Tell el-Hesi on which are two horned animals with similar bodies facing right, though their legs are rendered differently (CPP: 17, MMC, Dynasty XVI, MB). A frieze with metopes on a krater from Lachish Fosse Temple III has a schematic quadruped figure that somewhat recalls the spirit of ours (Lachish IL Pis. XLVIIL251; LIX:3). Sherds of a storage jar painted in red from Beth-Shean Str. VII depict human and animal figures in a free-style composition (James and McGovern 1993: Fig. 25:1). A small storage jar elaborately painted all over was found in Megiddo Str. VIIB (Megiddo IL Pl. 64:4). However, these comparisons are only to selected elements and differ greatly in their style, as well as details and composition. The relatively small size of this jar indicates that it might have been a serving vessel rather than a storage vessel, or perhaps used to store a special, prized commodity. It may have been a specially commissioned jar, possibly meant to commemorate an event with intrinsic meaning for the members of the household in which it was found. It is difficult to trace a chronological pattern in the motifs on SJ 2c (Table 28). Red and black horizontal lines appear in all strata, while red horizontal lines appear in all strata except for Str. X (in which there are only a few such jars; see below). Red shoulder metopes of straight and wavy vertical lines, with or without painted motifs 83</page><page sequence="93">CHAPTER TWO Table 28. Distribution of decorative motifs on S J 2c. Motif/Str. [X I IX I VIII I VII Red horizontal lines - _+ + + Red and black horizontal lines + _+ _+ + Red shoulder metopes + - Red shoulder metopes with ibex - _+ - Red and black shoulder metopes - + Red and black lines, metopes + and animal and human figures |___ (ibexes), are found only in Str. VIE. Similar metopes in red and black are found only in Str. VII. These are rendered by hanging red triangles extending down from the neck. On PL 2:9, the four metopes are painted diagonally from the neck, which is unique; the metopes are composed of five and six straight and wavy vertical lines, as opposed to the more common three and four. PL 42:2 has three metopes separated by three red triangles; this too is a unique composition. No close parallel could be found for the latter two. Thus, it seems that while certain styles continued throughout the strata, there were particular styles in Str. VIH (red metopes with or without animals as well as the elaborate procession painting on PL 31:1) and in Str. VII (red and black motifs of individualistic design). This points to a certain shift in style between Str. VIH and VII, with the most diversity of composition being found in Str. VID. It may be concluded that while the jar's shape is common, the painted motifs are individual and were expressly created for each jar. This freedom of composition, which on one hand is guided by individual choice (of the potter and perhaps the consumer) and on the other hand employs recurrent, well-known motifs, is typical of most of the combinations of painted storage jars in the LB ( Megiddo Tombs : 156). The question remains of whether the choice of motifs and their combination is meaningful (e.g. signifying the producer's or user's identity, denoting the contents and/or function of the vessel, displaying status, possessing a personal or private cultic significance, and so on), or whether simple aesthetic considerations guided this choice. The findspots of the complete and near-complete jars are domestic and do not provide additional illumination as to their role or function. Of the seven painted jars from the Str. VIII Building 475, two were found in Room 494, while the other five, including the small elaborately painted PL 31:1, were found together in Room 467 (see Chapter IV). As opposed to Building 475, the six complete or partial jars (PL 42: 1-6) from the Str. VII Building 315 were found in locations dispersed throughout the building and were not concentrated in one particular room (see Chapter IV). One partial jar (Pl. 54:5) was found in the courtyard south of Building 315 and an additional concentration of Str. VII jars was found in Building 481, just to the southeast of Building 315 (Pis. 52:8-9; 53:1-2). The smaller size of SJ 2c points to its having been a household rather than a trade vessel like the main type SJ 2, though some transport jars, for example among those found in the Uluburun shipwreck (Pulak 1997: 240), are of about the same small size as our SJ 2c.63 Painted storage jars are a legacy of the MB, though they become much more common in the LB, with bichrome designs as well as the monochrome of the previous period (Amiran 1969: 102-103; Epstein 1966: 1-2). Negbi (1989: 58) discusses the impact of the Bichrome and Chocolate-on- White Wares on the motifs commonly applied to these jars (see also Fischer 1999). Sherds of painted storage jars (six examples) first appear at Tel Batash in Str. X. One of these (PL 14: 13) has a red band bordered by black bands, a composition that recalls the Bichrome Ware design style (Epstein 1966; see, e.g., Balensi 1980: Pl. 13:5-11, Abu Hawam; Megiddo Tombs: PL 51:7; Hazor II-IV : PL CCXL:6; Ugaritica VII : Fig. 13:1-2). Along with this sherd, we may also consider PL 19:2 from Str. IX, a neck-to-body profile of a small storage jar with red bands flanked by black. It is made of clay of the Moza-' Amminadav Formation, pointing to its manufacture in the Judean hill country. This jar has a well-levigated, light-colored fabric and is smoothed on the exterior. The design is well executed and is similar to the typical arrangement on Bichrome Ware vessels (Photo 35). Though these painted jar fragments in Str. X and IX do not belong to the "true" imported Bichrome Ware (Epstein 1966), they may be considered part of the broader definition that is suggested for this group, including both imported Cypriot and local wheel-made and hand-made wares (Artzy 2001: 168; Karageorghis 2001: 148-149). The chronological implications of this are further discussed under JG 3 and in the Summary (below). In Str. IX, there are 1 1 sherds of painted jars, as well as one complete jar from a pit dug into the Str. IX building (PL 20:21); these comprise 22% of the storage jars in Str. IX. Str. VIII sees a peak in the appearance of such jars (26%, 34 jars), while there is a slight decrease in Str. VII (22%, 26 jars). In Str. VIII and VII, there are 15 complete or almost complete jars. Only one 84</page><page sequence="94">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V painted body sherd was found in Str. VI, so that they are essentially missing from this phase; the same is true for the main type SJ 2. Thus, during the main LB sequence at Tel Batash (Str. IX-VII), the proportion of painted jars remains relatively consistent with a slight increase in Str. VIII, but in the final LB stratum (Str. VI) they have virtually disappeared. Painted storage jars are known throughout the country during the LB in domestic, cultic and funerary settings (see selected parallels below). Thus, the tradition of painted storage jars is both temporally and spatially widespread, though their amount and type differ at various sites (it is difficult to determine this precisely due to publication limitations). Notably, no painted storage jars appear among the rich assemblages that included numerous decorated bowls, kraters and goblets from the three Fosse Temples at Lachish. The few painted jars from LB tombs at Lachish bear only red or red and black horizontal bands.64 Moreover, it seems that such jars are not common at Gezer during the LB: none are shown from Cave I.10A or other published LB contexts from that site, and only a few sherds with red horizontal bands are published from the late 13th- 12th-century horizon of Gezer Str. XIII-XI. This type of decoration is considered a chronological hallmark of this horizon in the south and is a different phenomenon in both type and time from the painted decoration found on our SJ 2c ( Gezer IV: 57, n. 100; see also below and selected parallels).65 Painted storage jars are not mentioned in the discussion of the painted pottery of Str. C at Tell Beit Mirsim, where all the decorated sherds shown are defined as jugs ( TBMI : 46- 50), though some handles and body sherds decorated with horizontal red lines (e.g. TBM la: PI. 27:14-15, 23-31) may have belonged to painted storage jars. At Beth-Shemesh as well, virtually no jars with more elaborate decoration than red horizontal lines (e.g. Ain Shems IV: Pis. LVII:4, LIX:3, Str. IV) are published. At Tel Miqne, the limited LB sample published so far includes two similar jars (Killebrew 1998b: 112). At Ashdod, only a few published sherds appear to belong to LB painted storage jars with plain red horizontal lines;66 however, there is also a lack of unpainted LB storage jars in the published LB assemblage. It seems that painted storage jars are not common either at Tell el-Far' ah (S), Gerar and Tell el-' Ajjul, judging by the published material. Thus, it seems that in the Shephelah and southern coastal regions, painted storage jars (especially those with metopes on the shoulder) are not especially widespread in LB contexts. The many fine painted storage jars at Tel Batash (and apparently also at Tel Miqne) are noteworthy, both spatially and temporally, in light of this situation. In the north, painted storage jars are much more common, at least in the published material (see selected parallels below). However, most of the painted jars at northern sites are the smaller and rounder version of the Canaanite shape, while jars of the elongated tapering shape of SJ 2c are generally not decorated (Mullins 2002: 236). While shoulder metopes are certainly familiar and quite common, some of them with intricate geometric and zoomorphic compositions (e.g. Hazor I: PI. LXXXVI: 1, 10, Str. IB), the more frequent decoration on these smaller rounder jars is red or brown horizontal bands on the rim, shoulder and down to below the handles {Hazor I: PI. CXXIX). A number of painted jars, some with designs similar to ours, were found at Tel Zeror in Str. 17-15, dated to the 15th- 14th centuries (personal communication, E. Yadin; see also Zeror II: Pl. IX: 13). The relative frequency of painted storage jars in the north, as opposed to their scarcity in the south, suggests the possibility that the painted storage jar tradition is a northern feature that was adopted only selectively in some southern contexts during the LB. Could the elaborate decoration on the Tel Batash jars result from northern influence or special connections of some kind, such as women potters with northern traditions arriving through marriage, or itinerant potters of artists? However, this suggestion should be treated with caution, since the apparent scarcity of these jars in the south may result merely from publication lacunae. The relatively high frequency of painted storage jars, some of quite intricate design, among the domestic assemblages during most of the LB sequence at Tel Batash (especially Str. VIII-VII) is noteworthy and raises the questions of their function, status and symbolic value. Together with the biconical vessels (see below), this is the most frequently decorated vessel class at Tel Batash, in contrast to the general lack of decoration in the ceramic assemblage of the site throughout the LB. While the decoration of biconical vessels is understandable in light of their assumed function as tableware, that of storage jars is less comprehensible, since it is unlikely that these vessels were generally displayed (although their smaller dimensions raise the possibility of their being tableware as well). The tradition of painted storage jars, most with red horizontal bands, continues well into Iron I in the north, particularly in the Jezreel and Beth-Shean Valleys, e.g. Yoqne'am (Zarzecki-Peleg 1997: Fig. 9:1-2); Beth- 85</page><page sequence="95">CHAPTER TWO Shean (Yadin and Geva 1986: Fig. 32:4-5; James 1966: Fig. 51:15); Megiddo II: Pis. 68:2; 73:10, Str.

XIII-XII at Gezer (e.g. Gezer I: PI. 27:27). The fact that the sites in the northern valleys are believed to have remained under Canaanite control in Iron I may be of significance in relation to the absence of painted storage jars at our site (and other southern sites) in this period. The reason for this could be a decrease in demand due to impoverishment, population changes, a decline in resources or ceramic skill, or some other factor, possibly symbolic. Whatever the reason, the fact that these jars are already virtually absent at our site in the final LB stratum (Str. VI) is a noteworthy feature. Selected parallels Lachish: Lachish II' Pl.

VI and V, since it is a transitional type it is included in the discussion of the LB storage jar. Only rim and neck sherds have been preserved, averaging 10-12 cm in diameter and ca. 7 cm high; this fragmentary state of preservation is typical of the finds in both Str. VI and V. They are somewhat flaring, with a long, slightly thickened rim exterior. Many have prominent, though shallow, wheel marks on both the interior and the exterior. Better-preserved parallels (e.g. Ashdod V: Fig. 34:4; Gezer IL PI. 23:3) suggest that the body was long and ovoid, with a narrow base. Though the general rim shape is reminiscent of the generic LB jar SJ 2, on SJ 3 the outer rim has a less prominent thickening and appears to be a forerunner of the long plain necks and rims of the Iron I SJ 21 (see below). It might thus be considered a link between the Bronze Age tradition of rounded thickened rims and the straight plain rims of the early Iron Age. Greenberg (1987: 76) noted this progression from thickened folded rims to straight rims in the transition from the LB to Iron I at Tell Beit Mirsim as well. A complete jar with a rim of this type from Gezer Str. XV has a narrow ovoid body with two handles. The rim of our S J 3 is similar to some of the rims of four-handled jars of the late 13th and early 12th centuries (above, S J 2b). These rims may possibly have belonged to these four-handled jars, frequent in the south in late LB II and Iron I ( Gezer IV: 83). S J 3 is the most common type in Str. VI, comprising 58% of the jars, a total of 11 rims. In Str. V, though it declines to 28% of the jars, it is represented by 29 rims. The relative frequency of this transitional LB/Iron I type in Str. VI at Tel Batash, especially in light of the absence of the generic LB storage jar SJ 2 in this stratum. From the parallels, it seems that this type is found in the late LB II and Iron I in the Shephelah and coastal plain. 86</page><page sequence="96">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V Selected parallels Gezer: Gezerl : PL 28:2-3, 18 (Str.

The neck is vertical and usually thick- walled, with a rounded, slightly thickened rim top. The average rim diameter is 12 cm and the average neck height is 3.5 cm. This jar type comprises 38% of the storage jars in Str. V. It appears to have developed from S J 3 (see above) and continues into the Iron II, when it is the most common jar of Str. IV at Tel Batash ( Timnah II: 92 and Iron I parallels there). At Beth-Shemesh this is the most common type of jar in Str. III, some of them found filled with lentils and figs (Ain Shems V : 129). Thus, like CP 15, this is a ceramic type that begins in Str. V and continues as a dominant type into the Iron II Str. IV. SJ 21d: Storage jar with long vertical neck and plain rounded rim Early Str.

It is classified as a subtype of SJ 21 due to a general similarity and is differentiated by its longer and slightly narrower vertical neck (average height ca. 5 cm: average rim diameter 10 cm). The stance of the body is unknown but was possibly shaped like the main type, SJ 21. A storage jar with a similar neck and rim from Gezer Str. XV has a tapering ovoid body and a narrow base that may allude to the body shape of ours as well; this shape is reminiscent of the four-handled storage jars common at this time in this region (see SJ 3 above). PI. 76:2 is the only example that retains its shoulders, which are rounded and sloping; its neck is a little longer than average and it has groups of thin red horizontal bands painted outside. PI. 7 1 : 10, a painted body sherd, might belong to this type as well. This decoration continues the tradition of painted storage jars from the LB (see S J 2c above). However, the miniscule amount of this painted decoration on storage jars at Iron I Tel Batash is the exception and not the rule. In general the painted tradition is extremely rare at our site in Iron I; aside from the Philistine vessels, only three types of bowls are decorated with red concentric circles (BL 51, 58, 59).68 Other Iron I closed vessels painted in similar style include amphorae and jugs (e.g. Qasile II : Fig. 30:12, Str.

Marked Storage Jar Handles Several handles with incised marks were found; they 87</page><page sequence="97">CHAPTER TWO apparently belonged to storage jars, though it is possible that some (e.g. PL 19:3) are from jugs. Most were incised after firing, and most come from Str. VIII. Hirschfeld (2000; 2002) discusses the various potential meanings of potmarks, whether related to the manufacture of the vessel, its contents or its context, and their possible relationship to writing systems, particularly Cypro- Minoan. Her conclusion is that the marks, which are mostly incised after firing on the handles of closed vessels, might relate to the use of the vessel or more likely to the process of its transit or exchange- a way of keeping track of the vessel as it moved from workshop to consumer, passing through the hands of middlemen along the way. While marked Cypriot and Mycenaean vessels are often found in funerary contexts, Canaanite storage jars with potmarks are found mainly in domestic and storage contexts at Ugarit (Hirschfeld 2000: 171). This implies a separate handling procedure for the Canaanite jars and their contents (Hirschfeld 2002: 93). Some of the signs on the storage jars from Tel Batash Str. VIII (e.g. PI. 22:5-7, 36: 1-2) are similar to those from Ugarit and Enkomi; however, it is difficult to determine if there is any relationship between the two or if the similarity is coincidentally based on the inherent simplicity of an incised "x" or cross as a kind of generic mark. This is especially true for our Str. VIII handles, since they are considerably earlier than the main bulk of marked handles at Enkomi, which are most numerous and diverse in LC IIC and LC IIIA (Hirschfeld 2002: 91). Since at Batash most of the signs were incised after firing, we may assume that they were incised by persons other than the potters; this could have been done at any time during the lifetime of the vessel. If we assume that these storage jars were locally made in the immediate region, such marks may be related to the localized transfer of these jars and/or their contents. Str.

X; only a few small sherds came from the subsequent LB and Iron I levels. The relative lack of pithoi in the LB as opposed to the MB (with the exception of northern sites, such as Hazor and Dan; see also Beth-Shean, Str. R2: Mullins 2002: PI. 15:5; Gilboa 2001b for Cypriot "wavy-band" pithoi) is a well-known phenomenon with social and economic implications (Amiran 1969: 143; Bonfil 1992: 26, 34; Qashish: 292). Though the reintroduction of the pithos in the later LB IIB and during Iron I has been considered an ethnic marker, it is now understood to reflect much wider economic and social trends as well (London 1989; Killebrew 2001; Raban 2001b; Cohen- Weinberger and Wolff 2001).

It lacks handles and is well fired. It stands ca. 80 cm tall, with an average rim diameter of 15 cm and a capacity of ca. 70 liters. The different examples of this pithos were not found together, but rather were dispersed throughout Building 720 in Str. X. The complete vessel (PL 12:1) was found in Locus B765, in the northeastern corner of the southern room, while the near-complete vessel (Pl. 12:2) was found in Locus 720, the northern room. The rim sherds were concentrated mainly in Locus 717, on the stone floor in the northwestern corner of the northern space of this building. The presence of so many large and apparently stationary storage vessels in one building is noteworthy; if indeed each rim represents a vessel, together with the two complete pithoi there were ten pithoi in this building, with a total capacity of about 700 liters. This figure should be considered in conjunction with the estimated capacity of the other storage jars found in this building: SJ 5 (four jars) a total of ca. 128 liters and SJ 1 (13 jars) a total of 365 liters. Thus, a total of at last 1 193 liters could have been stored in Building 720. Though this figure is of course conjectural, being based for the most part on the reconstruction of fragmentary jars, it reflects a very 89</page><page sequence="99">CHAPTER TWO substantial storage capacity for a private household (see the discussion in Chapter IV). This pithos apparently belongs to Bonfil's Type 5a or 5e and is paralleled at Tel Qashish, Lachish and Tell el-'Ajjul in contexts dated to the end of the MB (Bonfil 1992: 30; Fig. 5:1, 5).69 A close parallel came from Tomb 1 at Gezer (Macalister 1912c: Pl. LXL21). Such jar rims were found in a domestic context at Manahat in Jerusalem, where reconstruction of the size of the vessel to which they might have belonged suggests that their capacity could have been as much as 60-100 liters (Edelstein et al. 1998: 45, Fig. 4.8:1). Such pithoi are found in both domestic and funerary contexts. Handleless pithoi are considered by Bonfil to be characteristic of the Shephelah and coastal plain in MB IIB, though several such vessels with handles were found at Gezer and Beth-Shemesh as well (Bonfil 1992: 34). PT 2'Ä£ Pithos with large, thickened rounded rim Str. VIB:P1. 57:10 Str. VIA: Pl. 60:5 Early Str. V: Pl. 66:4 Rim sherds with a thickened rounded rim profile and a thick wall. The rim diameter averages 27 cm, suggesting that this was a huge vessel. Only two such rims were found in Str. VI and three in Str. V. This rim type is similar to some of the so-called "collared-rim jars", though we lack the part of the neck that would have had the actual collar ridge. If indeed our rims belong to this type, the presence of such pithoi in Str. VI-V accords with the appearance of such vessels in late LB contexts, continuing into the Iron I (Esse 1992; Artzy 1994; Killebrew 2001). Collared-rim pithoi are very rare in the Shephelah, with only a few rim fragments being found at Beth- Shemesh and Tell Beit Mirsim (Killebrew 2001 : 379, n. 7). They are virtually non-existent in Philistia south of the Yarkon River, though they do appear at Tell Qasile {Qasile II : 57-58, Str. X, VIII; Mazar and Harpazi-Ofer 1994: 24, Fig. 15:15). These few rim fragments, if indeed they belonged to collared-rim pithoi, are perhaps indications of connections with regions to the east and north of the Shephelah, where such pithoi are common. One of the pithoi from 'Izbet Sartah Str. III has an identical rim ('Izbet Sartah: 51, Fig. 9:1). Pithoi Varia Str. VIII PL 26:14 PL 37:20 Two body sherds of a thick-walled vessel; though they are of varying thickness and found in different locations, they probably belong to the same vessel, as the fabric is very similar (light brownish-yellow, 10 YR 7/3; thin light gray core, 10YR 7/1 ; few medium and some small white and gray particles); the fabric is relatively lightweight and porous. These sherds each have three incised wavy bands reminiscent of those on the Cypriot "wavy-band" pithoi (Keswani 1989: 14-16; Gilboa 2001b). However, pÃ©trographie analysis has shown that both are locally made of Taqiyye Formation marl. "Wavy-band" pithoi have been found at a number of sites throughout the Levant in LB levels, notably Ugarit, Sarepta, Tyre, 'Akko and Hazor (Pilides 2000: 51-53; Gilboa 2001b). Additional examples were possibly found at Ashdod and Beth-Shemesh. However, the question of their origin remains open, as none has been examined for provenance (Gilboa 2001b: 164-165); some may be imported (from Cyprus?), while others may have been locally manufactured, perhaps by itinerant potters. Most of these pithoi date from LB IIB, much later than the Str. VIII (LB IB) context of our sherds, and it remains open whether our sherds indeed represent such a vessel. If so, it would be an exceptionally early example that we may definitely show was locally made and not imported. JUGS (Fig. 7; Table 30) Essentially, only two jug types (the piriform jugs JG 1 and JG 2) are represented in the LB, both of which have narrow bases and could not stand unsupported. They are essentially similar in concept and differ only in placement of handle and shape of rim. There is a chronological and quantitative distinction between the two, with JG 2 being found in limited numbers mainly in Str. VIII, while JG 1 is well represented in both Str. VIII and VII. Since there is a general dearth of jugs in Str. X-IX, it is impossible to draw conclusions concerning the jug typology of this earlier part of the LB. The scarcity of jugs in the houses of these two earlier strata may be related to function, but could alternatively be the result of the more disturbed and partial nature of the finds in these levels.

In addition, discussion of the LB jugs should take the vessels defined as biconical jugs into account on a functional level, though they are classified separately in our typology (below, BV la-b). It seems that the less frequent jug types (including, of course, imported jugs; see Chapter III) were purely tableware or containers of special materials, while the more common and utilitarian JG 1 and JG 2 also served for other purposes, such as food preparation and preservation, storage and perhaps transport or even cooking. This is supported by their lack of the ring or disc base that would make them more practical as tableware, while the narrow base of these jugs recalls that of storage jars. The number of Iron I jug types (JG 30, 7 and 6) is also limited, though the vessels defined as closed vessels that might have been jugs should also be noted. JG 6, the Philistine jug, is dominant in the corpus of the period. As during the LB, it seems that these two types represent different functions: the plain jug may reflect a utilitarian household function for which one basic type sufficed, while the decorated Philistine jug may perhaps represent an ethnic marker or a status symbol. Since these later jugs are small and have a limited capacity, their function must have been different from that of the larger and heavier LB jugs.

The rim is plain, sometimes everted (PI. 36:5) and sometimes beveled on the interior (PI. 43:3). The body is piriform with sloping shoulders above a wide, soft carination. A thick loop handle extends from the rim to the shoulder; in a few cases, the handle begins just below the rim exterior. The narrow base is flattened or a slightly rounded "button" base. Often (e.g. PI. 23:4) the base is very thick and left untrimmed on the interior, showing traces of the potter's closure of the vessel at this spot, similar to some examples of S J 2. All these jugs were found in domestic contexts and are plain, heavy and utilitarian. PI. 32:3 is the only decorated example found; it is also smaller (Photo 37a). PI. 32:1 has two knobs on its neck.

Table 3 1 summarizes the height and capacity of these jugs. On many of the jugs part or all of the neck is missing; in some instances, such as Pl. 43:5, there are traces of filing of the break, perhaps indicating that they continued in use after breakage. Thus, the capacity measurement supplied for incomplete vessels is a legitimate figure, assuming that the jug could have been used (probably for solids) despite its missing neck. The jugs range from as little as 22.5 cm to as much as 40 cm high, though most of the jugs in Str. VIII average 35 cm high, with an average capacity of ca. 7 liters (excluding the two small jugs).

Thus, there is a difference between the two strata on two accounts: the Str. VIII jugs have a larger average capacity than those of Str. VII by almost 25%, and there is somewhat more variability in size, shape and capacity among the Str. VIII jugs. One of these jugs, which contained a concentration of almonds and bronze weapons, was found in the destruction debris of the Str. VII Building 315 (Photo 38). Only seven vessels and sherds from Str. X-IX can be related to this type (note PI. 19:3, whose handle was incised after firing with a vertical line crossed by nine short horizontal lines). These jugs are especially common in Str. Vni-VII (46% and 66% of the jugs respectively) and do not appear at all in Str. VI. Thus, this type joins other typical long-lived and common LB shapes (e.g. SJ 2, BL 56) that have already disappeared in this last phase of the LB at Tel Batash. Parallels to our JG 1 at Lachish display a rather large amount of variations in body shape and rim (Tufhell's Jug Class D, see parallels below), though most are smaller. Tufnell notes that they are not common at Lachish, most likely due to the fact that "such a vessel would be more at home in a domestic than a funerary setting" ( Lachish IV: 188). However, many such jugs have been recovered from funerary contexts as well. Judging by the published material, these jugs are not common at Gezer (see parallels below). This type is frequent at Beth-Shemesh, where it was found mainly in tombs and cisterns and thus considered a "water pitcher"; the type with a base like that of our JG 1 is by far the most frequent (Ain Shems V : 122). A small jug of this type (neck missing) contained a hoard of jewelry ( Ain Shems IV : PL LVI: 13). In the north, medium-sized to large piriform jugs tend to have ring or disc bases; when jugs with a rounded base like our JG 1 are found, the bodies are often smaller and rounder (e.g. Megiddo Tombs : Pl. 17:2-3, 5) and the neck is shorter and everted (e.g. Hazor /: Pl. CVIII:6-7).70 This shape appears less common at northern sites in general, though this might be due to vagaries of publication. It is difficult to judge whether this jug type is common at coastal sites due to the lack of securely dated and well published LB sites in this region. None appear at Tel Michal, but the assemblage is small. One with a rounded base is published from the Str. IX temple at Tel Mevorakh ( Mevorakh II : Fig. 8:5). A jug in an LB I burial at Ashkelon is similar in shape, though smaller, with a shorter everted neck (Baker 2003: Fig. 29, 35). Only one example is published from Ashdod Str. XIV (Ashdod I: Fig. 23:3, handleless). It seems that this shape is common at Tell el-' Ajjul in LB II (see parallels below). It thus appears that the medium-sized or large piriform jug with trefoil mouth with rounded base is more common in the south of the country during the LB, though it is known in northern contexts as well. Since many of the contexts in which these jugs were found are in tombs, it is difficult to establish a particular chronological range within the LB for them. We can trace the roots of this shape to the MB H jugs with pronounced shoulders (often with shoulder handles like our JG 2, e.g. Oren 1973: Fig. 32:4; Beth-Shemesh: 131: 662, 690) and find these jugs, with or without ring or disc bases, in contexts of the 15th-14th centuries, the time of their main appearance at our site. Though, as mentioned above, this type has disappeared by Str. VI at Batash, its shape can be found in some other 13th-century contexts in our region, such as Ashdod Str. XIV, Aphek Str. Xl 2, Gezer Str. XV and Lachish Tomb 503 (see selected parallels below). A similarly shaped jug in Tomb 7 at Jatt is dated to Iron IA (Yannai 2000: Fig. 10:116).

VIIA: PI. 53:8 This jug is similar in size, body shape and type of manufacture to JG 1, but is differentiated mainly by its rounded, thickened rim exterior, round mouth and handle placement on the shoulder. The rim shape is extremely similar to that of SJ 2; in fact, it is difficult to differentiate between rim and neck fragments of the two, an indicator of interrelated mass production of these two types. Some examples have slight ridges at the join of the neck to the body, a trait that was noted on some examples of SJ 2 as well (see above). The suggestion that a thickened rim contributes to the durability of a vessel was made for SJ 2 and may be applicable to JG 2 as well; this type possibly contained a commodity or was used for a function that required more strength than JG 1. None of these jugs is decorated. Table 32 summarizes the metric data for this jug. In Str. VIII, the average height is 33.5 cm and the average capacity is ca. 7 liters (excluding the very large PI. 36:3), almost identical to JG 1. Though in Str. VII the sample Photo 39. JG 2 (PL 36:1). consists of only three jugs, it seems that the trend towards smaller average height (ca. 29 cm) and lower capacity (ca. 6 liters) applies to JG 2 as well as JG 1. Like JG 1, JG 2 has greater size variability in Str. VIII, with a range from 25 to 44 cm high. The variant rim of JG 2, as noted above, may be related to a use that required rim reinforcement. The great decline in the appearance of this feature in Str. VII is noteworthy and may be due to the cessation of whatever task necessitated such durability. This jug is less common than JG 1 and appears mainly in Str. VIII, in which the 12 examples found constitute 44% of the jugs; only three examples were found in Str. VII. However, this number could be higher, since some rims registered as SJ 2 might have belonged to JG 2. Shoulder-handled jugs with more rounded bodies and ring bases are well known in MB II and early LB I Table 32. Height and capacity of JG 2 (complete and near-complete vessels) Str.

The earlier handles are often double, generally on smaller jugs (e.g. Pis. 5:10; 8:10). Amiran (1969: 146) contended that shoulder-handled jugs had completely disappeared by LB IIB; at Tel Batash they apparently become rare as early as Str. VII (LB IIA) and, like JG 1, are altogether absent from Str. VI. These jugs may be compared to Tufnell's Jug Class B, representing a direct development from MB shapes. However, the particular rounded thickened rim that is the hallmark of these jugs is found on only a few of these jugs at Lachish, Gezer, Tell 'Eitun and Tell el-'Ajjul (see selected parallels below).71 It thus seems that the fact that only 15 examples of this type were found at our site, mainly in Str. VIII, and the particular configuration of the shoulder handle, the thickened rim and the narrow base on JG 2 mark it as a localized regional product, inspired by the general shape of the popular contemporary piriform jug and provided with a thickened rim for functional purposes. This is one of the few cases in the Batash ceramic repertoire of a local product with a limited regional distribution, limited in time and quantity. This is not to say that this is a unique vessel type, since it is well rooted in the LB jug tradition and does appear at other southern sites; however, it seems to be more of a localized response to a particular functional need or the result of a limited production line.

VILA: PL 53:9 This designation is used for jugs that could not be classified as JG 1 or JG 2, due to the lack of rim, neck or handle. It is possible that these vessels were reused after breakage, though obviously the lack of a neck and handle would limit the uses for such a vessel and make it more difficult to maneuver. Other LB Jugs: JG 3, 4, 15 JG 3: Globular body, bichrome decoration Str. X: Pl. 14: 1-2 These are two jugs from Str. X that share only the broadly related characteristics of rounded body and decoration in red and black on the body. Pl. 14:1 is composed of numerous sherds that were not entirely restorable, though most of the vessel has survived. It has a squat globular body, a disc base and a narrow concave neck with an everted rim. It is impossible to reconstruct whether the handle was on the shoulder or extended from the body carination to the rim, though the former seems more likely. Extremely faded decoration consisting of a black horizontal band bordered by two red bands encircles the body at its widest point. The exterior is covered with very fine horizontal combing, especially visible on the lower body. The vessel is made of well-levigated light-colored clay with a few small dark inclusions. PÃ©trographie analysis showed that the origin of this vessel is somewhere outside the Levant, most likely Cyprus (see Chapter II.2). Pl. 14:2 is taller and more ovoid, with a ring base; no neck, rim or handle is preserved. Red and black horizontal bands are painted rather carelessly at just about mid-body. The fabric of this jug is also light buff in color, but it is local and has more and larger inclusions. The firing of this vessel to a light color, different from the more typical reddish- yellow or pinkish color of most of the other vessels in Str. X, appears to have been intentional. Jugs with wide rounded bodies, light-colored clay and red and black lines near the curvature share the shapes and decorative motifs of Bichrome Ware. Our imported jug certainly belongs to this group. Current definitions of Bichrome Ware tend to include both Cypriot hand- and wheel-made vessels of varying quality 96</page><page sequence="106">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V and their Levantine-produced counterparts (see above, SJ 2c; Karageorghis 2001: 148-149; Artzy 2001: 168). This broad definition allows us to relate our local jug to the Bichrome Ware group as well, albeit as a distant relative. Another such vessel is the small storage jar from Str. IX that is included with SJ 2c. If indeed all three of these vessels may be considered "Bichrome-related", then our Str. X-IX should broadly correspond with the chronological range of this ware in Canaan (see pp. 124, 126, 127-128). The presence of "Bichrome-related" and imported Bichrome Ware vessels (e.g. PL 14:1) in the Shephelah is noteworthy, as they are not common in that region.

The flat-sectioned loop handle (broken) rises above the rim and extends down to the rounded shoulder. Its fabric is well levigated and fired to a metallic ring. It is covered with a self slip and a light continuous burnish. The "feel" of the vessel is somewhat reminiscent of the fabric of Base Ring jugs and it is perhaps an import. This jug was found in Room 467 of Building 475 with a very large assemblage of vessels (see Chapter IV). The wide, open mouth of this jug seems to preclude its use as a container for a precious oil. On the other hand, if it was used as tableware, its delicacy and small rhoto 4U. JU 4 (Fl. 33:2). size are somewhat anomalous. No parallels were found for this jug, though there is a broad similarity to a local imitation of a Base Ring tankard in Tomb 2 1 6 at Lachish ( Lachish IV: Pl. 80:854). and to a jug in the Tell 'Eitun LB tomb, attributed to "Cypriot Red Slip Handmade Ware" (Tzaferis and Hess 1992: Fig. 4:7).

It was found in Building 315, where three complete imported Base Ring jugs were also found. Pl. 5 1 : 16 is the rim and upper neck of a jug with everted rim, similar to the stance of the Base Ring jugs. It is wheel-made and painted with horizontal black bands on the exterior and vertical hatches on the rim top. It was found in a street level together with fragments of two Cypriot imports: a White Shaved juglet and a Base Ring II juglet (Pl. 51:13-14). Pl. 57:8 (Str. VI) has a globular body and a high flaring ring base (Photo 41b); the neck and rim are missing. There is a slight ridge at the joint of the neck and shoulder. The body is painted with groups of red and black intersecting diagonal lines in a careful composition; the neck shows traces of red and black horizontal bands. This type of decoration emulates the typical design of painted lines, usually in white, found on Base Ring II jugs. This jug was found not on a floor but in debris attributed to Str. VI, together with a sherd of an imported Cypriot White Slip hemispherical bowl of the "Late Style" (Pl. 57:9). To this handful of imitation Base Ring jugs, we may add only two other imitations of imports: a pyxis from Str. VII (PL 54:14) that imitates Mycenaean ware and an imitation White Slip hemispherical bowl in Str. X (Pl. 10:22).72 Though Base Ring jugs and juglets are found in all the LB strata (Chapter III), imitations of these jugs are extremely rare at our site and are represented only by the four examples described above. Imitations of virtually all the imported Cypriot and Mycenaean vessel types are quite common in tomb contexts but far less so in domestic or other settings during LB II, especially LB IIB. In fact, the ratio of imitations to imports is generally quite high, especially in tombs (Prag 1985: 160). Tufnell claimed that imitations began to replace imports at the time when the imported Base Ring ware became progressively scarce, some time in the late 14th century ( Lachish IV : 209-210, Pl. 81:886-896). However, as Prag noted, "importation and imitation went side by side" well into the 13th century (Prag 1985: 160-163 and selected parallels there). Since most of these jugs were found in tombs, precise dating is difficult. Parallels suggest that their last appearance is in late LB IIB contexts and that they were no longer manufactured or deposited in tombs by the beginning of the 12th century. At Batash the imitation jugs seem to run somewhat counter to the main trends noted for such imitations: while our finest example comes from the 14th century (Str. VII), the majority appear in the 13th century, and ours come from domestic contexts. Assuming that these jugs were used as containers for precious substances when placed in tombs (Prag 1985: 163), we may speculate that they fulfilled the same function in a domestic context. The few parallels found for such imitation jugs in non-funerary contexts are all from southern sites. Note that at our site there are other vessel types that are generally found in tombs: two Cypriote imports (a White Shaved spindle bottle and a Base Ring bull rhyton; see Chapter III), an Iron I amphora (AM 2) and, and to a lesser degree, a biconical amphora (B V 3). Though this of course may simply be the result of poor publication of non-funerary assemblages dating from this period, this appears to be a genuine trend.

Its biconical body relates it to the LB tradition, which continues into Iron I in the form of various jugs, amphorae and even goblets ( Qasile II: 59; Megiddo II : PL 75:6, Str. VIA); note also some jugs, with and without strainers, from Iron I contexts in Transjordan (McGovern 1986: Figs. 52:36; 53:41).

Eight sherds of this jug were found, comprising 6% of the jugs in Str. V. This shape continues into Str. IV, though it continues to be rare (5% of the jugs in Str. IV; Timnah II: 109-110). The stance and neck of this jug are somewhat reminiscent of the Aegean-style cooking pot that was locally produced in Philistia in Iron I (Yasur-Landau 1992; Killebrew 1999; Dothan and Zukerman 2004: 34-35). It is possible that our sherds indeed belong to such vessels (A. Zukerman, pers. comm.).

No complete profile has been preserved and most examples are body sherds. Some of the thicker- walled sherds could have belonged to kraters (KR 2). Limited subdivision of the type was carried out, designating strainer jugs as JG 6a and narrow necks with basket handles as JG 6b. Though strainer jugs could obviously have had basket handles, they were separated because of the fragmentary nature of our material (very few of these were found in any case). It should be borne in mind that though Philistine Bichrome jugs often have basket handles and strainers, these features are not exclusively Philistine and also appear on other jug types in the local Canaanite repertoire (Gilboa et al. 2006); thus JG 6a is not merely a strainer jug but one with Philistine Bichrome decoration, and strainers with red slip are not included in this category.73 Apart from those of subtype JG 6b, only one rim was found (Pl. 72:21; compare to Ashdod V : Fig. 32:14, Str. XII).74 The few preserved bodies are rounded and have Photo 46.

The very fragmentary preservation of the Philistine jugs shows that they had a high breakage and discard rate. It is not clear whether this is related to intensive use, the relative delicacy of this jug, or both. Thus, the shape of JG 6 must be pieced together mainly on the basis of analogy to known types. Dothan's typology of Philistine jugs includes Type 6 (strainer jug) and Type 7 (jug with basket handle and spout or "feeding bottle") (Dothan 1982: 132-157; see also Type 17, pp. 191-194). Both of these are combined in JG 5 at Qasile ( Qasile II: 64). Some body sherds from Batash may have belonged to stirrup jars (Dothan's Type 3; Dothan 1982: 115-125). JG 6 comprises 56% of the jugs in Str. V and its dominance in the assemblage is evident in virtually all contexts of this stratum, both inside Building 313 and in its courtyards, as well as in all phases of Str. V. It thus may be considered a ubiquitous element of the local household repertoire at this time rather than a rare or exotic vessel. Most of the Philistine Bichrome designs are of high quality and include a wider range of motifs than the kraters (KR 2) and the bowls (BL 8), the latter bearing only horizontal lines and spirals. The motifs on the jugs include spirals, lozenges, concentric semicircles, scale pattern, the double axe and the Maltese cross; two birds were found as well (Photo 46). It is interesting to note that both birds are somewhat different from most of the parallels presented by Dothan (1982: Figs. 61-62). PI. 63: 14 shows the tail end and legs, which are composed of one curved horizontal line from which the legs descend, as opposed to the norm of two distinct legs descending from the body itself. PI. 70: 19 shows a rear-turning head with a short neck that does not extend along the bird's back, as do most of the others (however, other examples of a "too short" bird neck are Dothan 1982: Fig. 61 : 14, 21 from Tell el-Far' ah (S) and a krater sherd from Ashdod Str. XI, painted underneath another bird with a longer neck; Ashdod VI : PI. 111.37:9). Though the freehand execution of the birds on Philistine vessels resulted in each one being somewhat different (Dothan 1982: 200), the details of the two birds found at Tel Batash deviate even from the wide range of normative attributes. PI. 70:17 has a triangle reminiscent of some of the lotus flower patterns, for example from Tell el-Far' ah (S) (e.g. Dothan 1982: Fig. 46), Beth-Shemesh (Dothan 1982: Fig. 47:1) and Gezer (Dothan 1982: Fig. 47:2), though the latter all appear on the neck and not on the body as does ours. Thus, while all of the designs are typical of Philistine Bichrome, there is a rather high degree of freedom in their execution. Traces of white slip could be discerned on many of these jugs. Almost 90% of the jugs examined were made of a variation of the fabric commonly used for the Philistine Bichrome vessels, FG L. The remaining 10% were made of FG K, used for many vessels in Str. V, with one vessel being made of the rare FG I. Thus, JG 6 joins the other Philistine Bichrome vessels (BL 8, KR 2) in their similar manufacture and it may be assumed that all were produced in the same locale. The few examples of JG 6 that are made of the more typically "Canaanite" fabric (FG K) might have been made somewhere else, though locally as well. Another possible interpretation is that all vessels were produced in the same workshop, but that the potters uses surplus "Canaanite" clay to create some typical Philistine forms, abandoning the specialized choice of "clay for type" that is typical of the Philistine repertoire. This provides further evidence for the interaction between these two sectors of pottery production (Dothan and Zukerman 2004: 35). Str.

BICONIC AL VESSELS (Fig. 8; Table 33) These are vessels characterized by the biconical body shape that is so common in the LB (Amiran 1969: 147). They are wheel-made and differ in a number of morphological details, mainly the number and placement of the handles, as well as base, rim and neck type. Those with one handle are designated jugs and those with two handles we deem amphorae (sometimes called "amphora-kraters"); see the details of the typological division below. Our inclusion of all variations in one broad category or class, determined by the general body shape and divided into subtypes, emphasizes the significance of this shape as an LB hallmark, though it begins in the late MB and has its final appearance in Iron I. The technique of manufacturing the biconical body appears similar in all these vessels, and the proportions, addition of a neck or number of handles are basically secondary traits of limited chronological and regional significance, as detailed below. Table 34 shows that the average height is 24.32 cm and the average capacity is 5 liters, excluding the very Table 33.

Though PI. 32:10 is much lower than Pl. 37:12, its capacity is not very different, due to the high ring base of the latter; thus, aesthetic considerations won over practical function, since such a base imparted an elegant look to the vessel but reduced its capacity. Note that the average capacity of both JG 1 and JG 2 is 7 liters in Str. VIII and 5 liters in Str. VII. Thus, the common biconical jug or amphora contained on average ca. 35% less than the typical contemporary jug, which would point to the former's use as tableware rather than for storage; the base and decoration on most of these vessels supports this suggestion as well (see below). PI. 36:6 is much larger and represents a different vessel concept. It was perhaps used for small-scale storage, since when full it would have been quite unwieldy to maneuver as tableware; it is undecorated as well. Though most of them were probably used as tableware, these vessels are far from delicate and are of rather coarse manufacture. They were apparently 102</page><page sequence="112">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V Fig. 8. Typology: biconical vessels. designed to be breakage-resistant; their wheel-made manufacture, as well as their decoration (see below), may have made these vessels expensive to purchase and replace. Indeed, though they were apparently considered rather special vessels owned in small numbers, their fabric and quality of manufacture (aside from PL 42:7) are not superior to most of the other vessels in the assemblages to which they belong (for a similar observation, see Beth-Pelet II: 26). All are made of typical fabrics of the LB strata, particularly FG E. Thus, though these vessels share a similar concept of size and shape that defines them, the variations in proportion and details, as well as decoration, point to a freedom of manufacture that might reflect individual function, needs or taste/style, on the part of potter or consumer (see further below). Only three sherds of biconical vessels were found in Str. X, one of which (Pl. 14:12) is a body sherd of fine quality and careful decoration. They are lacking in Str. IX, perhaps because of the limited exposure of this level. Almost equal numbers are found in Str. VIII (six) and VII (seven). Two examples, including one complete vessel, were found in Str. VI and only one rim and body sherd (PL 63:10) comes from Str. V. It is thus difficult to determine whether this is a valid Str. V type, though typologically the stance of this fragment is at home in Iron I (see below). The angular biconical shape first appears in transitional MB II-LB I contexts. A biconical body profile is found in the Bichrome Ware repertoire (Epstein 1966; Amiran 1969; Artzy 1972: Figs. 7, 11), though these vessels differ somewhat in shape from our 103</page><page sequence="113">CHAPTER TWO biconical vessels, as they are wider and their carination is broad and soft.75 However, the taller, more angular biconical shape with one handle and no neck (our BV la-b), as well as the narrow-necked amphora (our BV 3), is found in the Chocolate-on- White Ware, beginning with Fischer's "Chocolate-on- White H" phase (Fischer 1999:13, Figs. 10:1, 3; 11:1-2). Various sources for the biconical shape have been suggested. Artzy (1972: 35, Figs. 18, 27) points to Cypriot White Painted askoi, popular mainly in Middle Cypriot assemblages, as the prototype for the typical LB biconical vessel. However, the question of the morphological and chronological relationship between carinated Cypriot shapes and Canaanite biconical vessels remains open. Lale Cypriot wares have been suggested as well, and the shape of White Slip or Base Ring tankards is indeed somewhat reminiscent of some biconical vessels. However, these are hand-made and have a rounded carination. Moreover, these Cypriot vessels are not chronological prototypes since they are contemporary with the earliest Canaanite biconical vessels. Thus we can postulate a possible mutual influence but not a definitive origin. Oren (1973: 80) proposed an Anatolian-Cilician origin for this shape (specifically for that of our B V 3), but not for the decoration. The shape of some MB Canaanite vessels defined as "goblets" II (e.g. Megiddo II : Pis. 1 1 :6; 17: 10, Str. XHI-XII) may possibly have influenced the development of the biconical jug. Nor should metal prototypes be ruled out. It seems that the ability to wheel-throw carinated shapes with highly plastic clay, which reached its peak at the end of the MB and very beginning of the LB, was the basis for the floruit of the biconical shapes in general, and that this skill was applied to both open and closed vessels. If indeed this was the case, it is notable that the wheel-made biconical shape continued to be extremely popular throughout the LB, during which there was a general technological decline in ceramic production and less plastic clays were used, although the biconical vessels are sometimes rather asymmetric. Notably, the biconical profile on closed vessels continued to be popular in LB ÃB, a time when there was a decline in the production of angular carinated bowls (see BL 56 above). The persistent popularity of biconical vessels may have been the result of its inherent morphology, which lent itself so well to decoration and thus to use as domestic tableware, as well as in cultic or funerary contexts (Yannai 1996: 242). It was apparently a meaningful vessel in the Canaanite ceramic assemblage, justifying the higher investment, in both technology and decoration, required for its manufacture. At Tel Batash all the biconical vessels were found in domestic contexts; parallels from other sites, like most other vessels of the LB , were found in domestic, funerary and cultic contexts. Though certain studies have dated the initial appearance of the biconical jug or amphora to the beginning of LB IIB (Zuckerman 2003: 166) or "mid- LB" (Yannai 1996: 242), it seems that this vessel was already at home in LB I, as demonstrated by its presence in our Str. X (LB IA) and. VIII (LB IB) and the parallels below (see also the discussion of this shape in the Chocolate-on- White repertoire, above). It is indeed more common in LB II, though at Tel Batash it is most frequent in LB IB-LB IIA (Str. VIII-VII) and declines in LB IIB (Str. VI).76 This form continues into the 12th century, mostly at northern sites (e.g. Dothan Tomb 1, Level 1, Megiddo VIIA,77 Beth-Shean Level VI and Tel Sera* IX; see the parallels below for the different subtypes). The Iron I biconical vessels are squatter and strainers and basket handles,78 as well as a short shoulder and wide neck, were often added (e.g. Megiddo IL Pis. 69:2, Str. VIIA; 84:6, Str. VI; James 1966: Fig. 56:4, Level VI; Cooley and Pratico 1995: Pl. 20:6; Keisan : Pis. 71:8c; 72:1, Str. 9c; Qasile IL Figs. 34:20; 35:2, Str. X).79 The biconical vessels are the most frequently decorated class of vessels in the entire LB repertoire, a situation also noted at other sites such as Beth-Shean (Mullins 2002: 285) and Hazor (Zuckerman 2003: 165- 166). Of the 19 vessels of this period found at Batash, 12 (7 of these complete or near-complete) are painted. The decoration (with rare exceptions) is applied on the upper part of the vessel, above the carination as well as on the rim and handle. The decoration is varied, including red or red and black metopes consisting of vertical straight and wavy lines, as well as lattice patterns and hourglass motifs. PL 37:12 is painted in red and white; a light burnish covers its painted upper half, while its lower part is left unsmoothed. PI. 32:10, found in two non-joining parts, is red-slipped and painted with a white and black design. PI. 42:7, of which three sherds were found, included an intricate paneled design in red with a tree, bird, dots and a spoked wheel; it is burnished and relatively delicate. A notable feature of biconical vessels is that though the typical LB motifs and designs repeat themselves in varying combinations, there are virtually no two vessels that are identical at any site. The individuality of each piece in details of shape, handles and decoration, as well as their relatively low frequency in the pottery repertoire, indicates that these vessels were perhaps custom-designed, either on commission or by selection; this might be true especially for the 104</page><page sequence="114">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V painting of the vessel, which might have been done separately from its manufacture (see also SJ 2c). This diversity was most likely the result of a less standardized mode of production, although it should be noted that this relatively low degree of standardization does not contradict the definition of these vessels as specialized products (Rice 1989: 111).

It should be noted that several stout biconical vessels from Tomb 216 at Lachish, all decorated, were said to have lacked handles altogether, though this is rare ( Lachish IV: 219, PI. 85:987, 988).

It is undecorated and of heavy manufacture, with prominent wheel marks; it has a slightly concave disc base (Pl. 60:6 appears to be the rim of another such vessel, though it is included in the general type of BV 1 since its handle is not preserved). Though its stance is slightly more open (rim diameter 13 cm), Pl. 63:10 of Str. V has been included in BV lb; it possibly belongs to the type with a strainer and a basket handle, mentioned above (e.g. Qasile II: Fig. 35:2, Str. X; Ain Shems IV: Pl. LVII: 10, 15, "LB cistern"; Lachish IV: Pl. 86:1002, Cave 4034, LB IIB-Iron I). The affinity of this subtype to the vessels called "mugs" by Tufnell should be noted ( Lachish IV: 217-218, Pl. 84:959-962, 966-969; Ben-Arieh and Edelstein 1977: 17, Fig. 9:5-6). Though the basic shape is similar, the "mug" is smaller and generally has a wider diameter ( Dan II: 12-1 A). Tufnell understood these vessels, dated mainly to the 13th century, to be inspired by Cypriot shapes, such as the Base Ring or White Slip tankard.81 Several biconical vessels with rim (and shoulder) handles are defined as "goblets" at Hazor (e.g. Hazor I: Pl.

BV 2a (PI. 32:10) has a body shape similar to that of BV lb and differs from it mainly in the presence of two handles rather than one. Two loop handles are placed on the shoulder. The rim is a shelf with an everted or thickened exterior (diameter 12.5 cm). The base is a very convex ring base. The vessel is red-slipped, with white horizontal and vertical bands painted on the upper body and handle (note that a parallel from Tel Harassim for BV 3 below is decorated in a similar manner). This combination of red slip covered by black and white decoration is very rare at our site. B V 2b (PI. 51:12; Photo 50) has a different stance, with a unique wide vertical neck (diameter 18 cm; rim diameter 20 cm) and a sharp protruding carination below. The handles extend from the carination to the upper neck. The hammer-head rim is angled in. The neck and body down to the carination is decorated with a red geometric design, intricate but carelessly executed. A light burnish covers the painted upper painted part of the vessel. Parallels for PI. 51:12 are rare, and virtually the only Photo 50.

VIII: PL 36:6 This complete vessel is the only example of its kind in our assemblage. It has a long, relatively narrow neck (diameter 12 cm).It has a round-topped hammer-head rim, protruding on the exterior. Below the neck is a biconical body, with its carination just above mid-body. The tall vessel (33 cm high) is well proportioned. The base is a very convex ring base, similar to Pl. 32:10 (BV 2a). The vessel is undecorated, unlike most of the comparisons to this shape. This, and its large size, may indicate that it was used for small-scale storage rather than as tableware. This shape is a kind of composite of a jug and a krater; note a similar vessel with only one handle from Lachish (Lachish IV: Pl. 74:687, LB IIA). Some versions of this vessel have a more rounded body. The interaction between the jugs, necked kraters and biconical amphorae indicates that they were manufactured as "variations on a theme", with the differences possibly resulting from functional reasons such as the manner of pouring or the degree of restriction required by the contents, or perhaps even the ultimate context, as this shape seems elsewhere to be somewhat more prevalent in tomb contexts than the other biconical vessels. The parallels show that this shape is generally prevalent in the earlier part of the LB (Oren 1973: 80-81; Ain Shems V: 114-115).The earliest appearance of this shape is in the Chocolate-on- White repertoire (see parallels below). A wider-necked version of this shape is Mullins's BV 3; he emphasizes the Anatolian-Cilician roots of this form, along with its affinity to shapes in the Bichrome Ware repertoire. It seems that this shape is most common in LB I, though it continues into LB II (Mullins 2002: 254-255). A related vessel shape with a narrower neck (short and long) and a lower carination is considerably smaller and found mainly in tombs, e.g. Ain Shems III: Fig. 2: 1-2, Str. IVa; the Tell 'Eitun tomb (Tzaferis and Hess 1992: Fig. 2:8); Jericho (Garstang 1933: Pl. XXIL8-11, 13, Tomb 5); Beth-Shean (Fitzgerald 1930: Pl. XLII:25; Oren 1973: Figs. 36; 39:21-22, LB I, Northern Cemetery); Jatt (Yannai 2000b: Fig. 5:59-60) and Transjordan (McGovern 1986: Figs. 37:13; 38:1, 3-4, 9). The tendency of this shape (especially the smaller version) to occur in tombs contrasts with its domestic setting at our site. However, this discrepancy may simply be the result of lack of excavation and publication of domestic sites. Selected parallels Lachish: Lachish II: Pis.

Such rims were found mainly in Str. V, reflecting the fragmentary nature of that stratum's ceramics, which did not include complete vessels. These rims were thus registered separately.

The stance of the neck is slightly flaring or vertical. The diameter ranges from 10 to 13 cm. Since two such rims were found in Str. VI and eight in Str.

Typology: juglets. JUGLETS (Fig. 10; Table 36) Juglets are relatively rare in the MB-LB-Iron I assemblages at Tel Batash. There are no examples of cylindrical or piriform juglets in Str. XII-XI (aside from four sherds of Tell el-Yahudiyeh juglets, see below). Virtually all the juglets found in all the strata under discussion are variations of the well-known dipper juglet that begins in the MB and continues well into the Iron Age, with changes mainly in proportions and details of body shape. JT 1: Small dipper juglet with ovoid body Str. XI: PI. 8:12-13 Two small juglets with wheel-made ovoid bodies and pointed bases. The completely preserved body of PL 8: 12 is 10 cm long. These belong to the type of dipper juglet that begins in MB IIA and continues into the LB throughout the country. The pointed bases are generally more indicative of an earlier date in the sequence, a date which suits our juglet (Amiran 1969: 111). The lack of slip is also considered a late MB II trait, but our sample is too small to determine if this lack is common at our site. This is Maeir's JD 2 (Maeir 1997: 113, Pl. 29:4).

Pl. 8:14-16 are small body sherds with traces of incised dot designs. Pl. 8:17 is a base and lower body that shows a clear design, with four triangles emanating from a well-formed button base; each triangle is filled with a herringbone pattern of incised dots and is delineated on both sides. It is likely that these sherds belong to the same juglet. This type seems to belong to Kaplan's Piriform Type 2a (Kaplan 1980: 21-22).This type is distributed throughout Egypt and the Levant, though it is not found farther north at sites such as Byblos or Ugarit (Kaplan 1980: 42). Neutron Activation Analysis of six examples of this type showed that they were manufactured in the Levant (Kaplan 1980: 62). Comparisons to our juglet may be found at Tell el- Dab'a Str. E/2; they continue until the end of Str. D/2 but are very rare (Bietak 2002: 38). Juglet Varia Str.

V Pl. 78:17: A squat bag-shaped body (6.5 cm high, neck missing) with a wide round base; there are traces of a handle on the sloping shoulder. The shape of this juglet is somewhat reminiscent of some variants of the so- called "black juglets" that become popular in Iron II (Timnah II: 111). PL 82:14: A wide flaring neck (rim diameter 6 cm), plain rim, sloping shoulders, loop handle from rim to shoulder; lower part missing. AMPHORISKOI (Fig. 11) Amphoriskoi are very rare and the only three examples were found in Str. V. It seems that these are specialized vessels that were manufactured for particular purposes, such as the small AM 1 , possibly used to contain a small quantity of oil. AM 1: Small amphoriskos with tapering base (Photo 54) Str.

V-V: PI. 78:24 This small vessel is similar to AM 1 in general concept, though it is squatter (10 cm high to the neck) and has a ring base; it is somewhat reminiscent of a pyxis. Traces of two loop handles remain. Prominent wheel marks are visible inside. It is undecorated and no close parallels could be found. AM 2: Medium-sized amphoriskos with tapering base (Photo 56) Str. V: Pl. 62:7 This is a medium-sized vessel, preserved in three non- joining fragments, ca. 30 cm high up to the base of the neck. The ovoid body ends in a tapering, slightly thickened base. The neck is relatively wide and has a slight ridge at the join to the shoulder. The exterior is decorated with pairs of thin horizontal red lines, burnished to a light polish. Note the similarity of this type of decoration to the groups of red lines found on some examples of S J 2 Id, as well as inside bowls (BL 51,58, 59). This vessel can be compared to several similarly decorated amphoriskoi from Tomb 11 at Bet Shemesh ( Beth-Shemesh : 180, Nos. 185, 478) and Lachish (Lachish IV: PI. 85:984-985 with white slip, Tomb 571, dated to the late 13th/early 12th century). A small Photo 56. AM 2 (Pl. 62:7). version of this vessel with a pronounced button base, painted with red horizontal bands and traces of a vertical metope, was found at in association with an LB tomb at Tel Miqne (Killebrew 1996b: PL 5:9; Killebrew 1998b: 131-132 for additional parallels). Thus, the domestic context of our vessel differs from the funerary context of the close analogies. This amphora type is more common in southern contexts. "FEEDING BOTTLES" (Fig. 12) BT 5: Small round spouted "bottle" (Photo 57) Str. V: Pl. 73:19? Str. V-IV: PL 84:12-14 This is a small round-bodied bottle with a short narrow neck. A short spout, angling up, is located on the shoulder. The only extant rim (Pl. 84:14) is slightly thickened on the exterior (Pl. 84:14 apparently belongs to this type, though the characteristic spout is not preserved). The base is a ring base. Pl. 73:19, consisting only of a base and lower body, has been included with this type due to its general similarity, though it may have been a small jug.84 All the vessels are decorated on the outside with groups of red horizontal bands, encircling the areas below the spout and above it on the neck (red horizontal bands are the most popular painted motif on open and closed vessels at our site in Str. V; see BL 8, 51, 58, 59; SJ 21d). Pl. 84:13 also has a red band around the base of the spout. Several of these vessels are covered with a light burnish as well. Seven such vessels, the most complete of which are 113</page><page sequence="123">CHAPTER TWO Fig. 12. Typology: bottles. presented in the plates, were registered. It is possible that narrow basket handles classified as JG 6b (e.g. PL 78: 16) belonged to such a vessel, as all the complete vessels of this type have such a handle (Dothan 1982: 157). The three vessels shown in PL 84:12-13 came from a mixed Str. V-IV fill that contained mainly Iron I pottery ( Timnah /: 180); one was found in the lowest levels of Str. IV as well (! Timnah II : 131-132; see also below). This shape is rare in the Philistine repertoire, in which it is termed a "feeding bottle", Dothan's Type 7 (Dothan 1982: 155-157, with parallels from Ashdod, Gezer, Beth-Shemesh, Tell el-Far4 ah (S), Azor and Tell Qasile; note also parallels from Tel Sippor: Biran and Negbi 1966: Fig. 3:5). This is Jug Type 7 at Qasile ( Qasile II: 97-98). Killebrew (1998: 180-181, Type AS 8) calls it a "spouted bottle" and presents parallels from Tel Miqne Str. VII-VI (Killebrew (1998: Ills. 22:30-31; 26:22). This vessel never has the typical Philistine Bichrome decoration but rather narrow red bands, often with white slip.85 The only exception to this rule is a bottle from Qasile Str. XI that has red and black bands ( Qasile II: Fig. 30: 11). All the parallels point to a distribution within the boundaries of Greater Philistia. The fact that, despite their relative rarity, several such vessels were found at Tel Batash, points to the markedly Philistine character of the ceramic assemblage of Str. V. The chronological range of this vessel in Philistia is from early Iron I (e.g. Ashdod Str. Xmb) to the early 10th century, when it appears with burnished red slip ( Ashdod II-III: Fig. 74:12, Str. X). This late appearance accords with the find of such a bottle in the earliest phase of our Str. IV, differing somewhat in its horizontal spout and lack of decoration ( Timnah II: 131-132, Pl. 1:21, Str. IVB). Note two small spouted jugs from Beth-Shean Level VII with loop handles from rim to shoulder (James and McGovern 1993: Fig. 22:1-2). If indeed these two vessels are Aegean-inspired "feeding bottles", they mark the earliest appearance of this shape and are the Photo 57. BT 5 (a: Pl. 84:12; b: Pl. 84:13). only such vessels to be found in the north. Killebrew (1998b: 181) cites as parallels White Painted Wheel- made vessels from Cyprus, dating from LC IIC-LC HIB and with antecedents in MC and earlier LC contexts, as well as a somewhat different vessel appearing LH IIB-LH UIC contexts in the Aegean. However, spouts do sometimes occur on small local jugs (e.g. at Hazor, LB II: Zuckerman 2003: Pl. 3.3:3) and thus these vessels may simply represent such an occurrence. STIRRUP JAR Str. V: Pl. 71:15 This is the disc top of the false spout of a stirrup jar (Photo 58). It is round, 4.3 cm in diameter, and the beginnings of the handles have survived. The top has a small protruding knob. The top of the disc is painted in a deep red with two narrow red concentric circles, with an additional thin circle encompassing its perimeter; it is covered by a light cream-colored slip. The design is neatly executed. The stirrup jar is Dothan's Type 3 (Dothan 1982: 115-125) and Qasile Type 3, found in Str. XI-X there {Qasile II: 92-95). All examples are decorated with rich Philistine Bichrome motifs. The discs are usually ornamented with red spirals (e.g. Qasile II: Fig. 38). A Photo 58. Disc top or stirrup jar (PL 71:15). 114</page><page sequence="124">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V close comparison to the design on our disc comes from Ashdod Str. XII, though the top is much more pointed than ours (Ashdod VI: PL 111.18:2). Dothan (1982: 115) claims that the later variants, such as an example from Megiddo Str. VI (Dothan 1982: PL 30, Fig. 17:6) have concave disc tops. However, the tops of the stirrup jars from Qasile Str. X have knobs; it seems that this type continues during the 11th century as well and that the abovementioned concavity might be a regional feature of a product made outside Greater Philistia. This and a small sherd of another disc top found not in situ are the only stirrup jar remnants found at our site. However, some fragments related to JG 6 might have belonged to such vessels. The frequency of their occurrence at other sites on the Philistine periphery, such as Beth-Shemesh and Gezer (e.g. Ain Shems /-//: Pl. XLVI:20; Ain Shems III : Fig. 2:15, 17, 19; Macalister 1912c: Pis. LXX:14; LXXXV:7), suggests that with further exposure of Str. V, more such vessels might be recovered at Tel Batash as well. FLASKS (Fig. 13; Table 37) Only one fragment of a flask dating from the LB was found; they greatly increase in Str. V, though they never become very common. LB Flask: FL 2 FL 2: Flask with V-shaped handle attachment Str. VII: PL 51:20 The rim, neck and handles of a large flask; the rim is everted and thickened outside.

A potter's mark was incised before firing on the upper handle. The exterior is covered with a light orange slip and is burnished to a polish, with some vertical burnish lines visible. This fragment is the only flask found in Str. VII and in fact in any of the LB levels (for a similar paucity at Hazor, see Zuckerman 2003: 178). This lack is surprising in light of the ubiquity of this vessel during this period (Amiran 1969: 166-167, Pl. 51; Killebrew 1998b: 124-127, Type CA28a, with parallels). None of the patrician houses of Str. X-VII contained such vessels, apart from this one shared. Iron I Flasks: FL 1, 3 FL 1: Small lentoid flask with everted rim (Photo 59) Str.

From the four complete or almost complete vessels one may calculate the average height as 7.5 cm, though PI. 74: 16 is 15 cm high. The inner neck diameter is ca. 1-1 .5 cm and the rim diameter is ca. 2-2.5 cm. Because of their lentoid shape, it was difficult to measure these vessels for capacity according to the method we employed for other vessels; the estimated capacity of the smaller flasks was 0.25 liters, while PI. 74: 16 could have contained 0.37 liters. The discovery of 18 such flasks together (14 in one room and 4 in another) in Temple 1 3 1 in Str. X at Tell Qasile suggests that they were possibly used as libation or offering vessels ( Qasile II: 131). Though our flasks were not found in a cultic context, they may perhaps have been used in this way in a domestic setting as well. Only one example of this type was found in Str. VI (Pl. 60:25). However, this context is not securely attributed to this stratum and this vessel possibly belongs to Str. V {Jimnah 1: 93). The other example from Str. VI is a small body sherd (PL 57: 1 1) that cannot be considered reliable evidence for the appearance of these flasks in . Str. VI. The five other flasks were all found in secure Str. V contexts. Most of our flasks are decorated on only one face, mostly with red concentric circles, some of which have faded (e.g. Pl. 79:7). Pl. 74: 16 also had a peeling creamy slip below the paint. Pl. 60:25 (questionably Str. VI) is painted in red with a circle surrounding an "X", with another "X" extending from the top of the circle to cover the neck; red hatches cover the handles. This decoration probably, though not certainly, extended to the other face of this flask as well. An exact parallel to this design is on a flask found on the surface at Tel Sippor (Biran and Negbi 1966: Fig. 3:10). A similar flask with a carelessly executed red decoration that is somewhat reminiscent of the pattern on our Pl. 60:25 was found in Str. XVI-XV at Ashdod (Ashdod /-/// : Fig. 36:4). Another flask from an Iron I context at Tel Sippor is decorated exactly like our Pl. 74:16 (Biran and Negbi 1966: Fig. 3:9). A body sherd painted with red and black concentric circles (PI. 72:22) has been included in this type; a flask decorated with red and black concentric circles was found at Tell Qasile ( Qasile IL Fig. 37:7, Str. X). Combinations of red concentric circles, with or without a "bull's eye" or central spiral, are the most common ornament on these flasks throughout the country in Iron I ( Qasile II: 71). This is Qasile Flask Type 1 , appearing very frequently in Iron I throughout the country, with the exception of hill-country sites; it disappears in the 10th century. Such flasks are found in domestic, cultic and funerary contexts alike. Most are decorated like ours with red concentric circles ( Qasile II: 1 1-72, n. 162, with parallels cited from Megiddo, Ashdod, Tell 'Eitun, Nitsanim, Madaba, Tel Masos and Tell Keisan). Note also a flask from Lachish with black concentric circles outlined in red ( Lachish IV: 245, Pl. 84:953, from Locus 556, dated to 1250-1200; Tufnell considered it an import, though not specifying from where). Only a few small sherds of such a flask were published from Gezer Str. XIII and they were apparently not common at that site ( Gezer IV: 84; Pis. 19:17; 22:6, less flaring).86 Killebrew presents flasks that are similar to ours in both shape and decoration as two different subtypes: Type CA28b, with a cut rim exterior like our PI. 74:16 (Killebrew 1998b: 127-128, 111. 111.17:3-4), found mostly in late 1 3th century contexts; and Type CA 28c (Killebrew 1998b: 128-129, 111. 111.17:5). Killebrew dates them to LB II, but it seems that a late LB IIB date should be specified, based on the example from Beth- Shean Str. VII.87 Our flasks are locally produced; three were made of the typical fabric (FG L) of the Philistine vessels (for the other two the fabric is too badly burnt for determination of the type). FL 3: "Spoon" flask Str. VI-V: PI. 65:9 The upper part of a vessel with a spoon attached to the neck. Only one fragment of this well-known Iron I flask type was found at Tel Batash; it is relatively large and undecorated. 116</page><page sequence="126">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V This is Qasile Flask Type 4, typical of Iron I, with very rare appearances in early Iron II contexts ( Qasile II : 74, with parallels from Megiddo, Beth-Shean, Gezer, Tell Keisan, Tell el-Far'ah [S] and Beth-Shemesh). We may note several additional parallels: Lachish TV : PL 86:999 (Tomb 559, 1250-1 150); Ashdod VI: PL 111.45:20, small fragment (Str. XI); Yoqne'am ( Qiri : Fig. 41:1, Iron I, painted), Aphek (Gadot 2003: Pl. V.53:13, Str. X8). These parallels have a similar body to that of our FL 1 (above), which is often decorated with red concentric circles, though a number are red-slipped; one example is red-slipped with black concentric circles (Gadot 2003: Pl. 36:8). The use of these flasks is obviously related to the attached spoon, into which the liquid content was poured. Since this is the only period in the entire history of ceramics of the Bronze and Iron Ages in which a spoon is directly attached to the aperture of a vessel, this was a specialized production that apparently ceased at the end of Iron I, or at the latest at the very beginning of the 10 th century. PYXIS Str. VII: PL 54:14 An intact pyxis found just below topsoil in destruction debris abutting a wall is attributed to Str. VII ( Timnah /: 93). It has a squat box-like body with a short, wide neck and everted rim (Photo 60). Three small horizontal handles are attached almost equidistantly on the lower shoulder. The vessel rocks a little when standing, since the base is slightly convex. It is undecorated and made of a well-levigated pinkish fabric with a few small white inclusions, similar to FG A (the fabric was not closely examined since the vessel is intact). Photo 60. Pyxis (Pl. 54:14). This vessel is clearly an imitation of a Mycenaean pyxis, a well-known phenomenon throughout the country during the LB with variations in the number of handles and the width and length of the neck (Amiran 1969: 186; Pl. 57:2-7; Killebrew 1998b: 133-134, with parallels). It is noteworthy that a complete imported Mycenaean pyxis was found in Str. VII as well. The pyxis first appeared in the 14th century and ultimately became an integral part of the Canaanite ceramic repertoire during LB H, continuing well into the Iron Age. Such imitations occur at Ugarit in the LB as well ( Ugaritica II : Fig. 73:7, Ugarit RÃ©cent 2). Since most of these vessels are decorated and were found in tombs, our pyxis is uncommon on both accounts. LAMPS (Fig. 14; Table 38) Lamps are relatively rare at Tel Batash in the LB and Iron I. None at all were found in Str. XII-XI, and apart from the eight from Str. IX, only a handful were found in each context, domestic or otherwise. It seems that alternative means of illumination were used. A similar scarcity was noted for Iron II {Jimnah II: 132). Basically, the lamps at Tel Batash display the typical form that continues with minor typological changes from the MB to Iron II (Killebrew 1998b: 136-138; Mullins 2002: 273-274). The broad rounded base and moderately pinched spout are consistent throughout the strata, with minor deviations mainly in the thickness of the base (see below); thus, our typological differentiation is based on rim shape, which does undergo change over time.

The rim is plain and vertical. The spout is moderately pinched, with one example from Str. VIII (Pl. 4:8) being quite wide. This type is most common in Str. X-IX (though no Str. X examples are included in the plates) and decreases in Str. VIII. It is not found at all from Str. VII onward. Indeed, as the parallels show, this lamp type is more typical of the late MB II and early LB; at Beth-Shean, the vertical-rim lamp is most common in Str. R2 and Rib, and none appear in Str. Ria (Mullins 2002: 273). The everted-rim lamp (LP 2) first appears in LB IIA (Str. VIII) and is the only lamp type found in Str. VII-V. However, it seems that this is not a purely chronological phenomenon, since in the north vertical-rim lamps continue well into LB IIB, as the selected parallels show, alongside a general scarcity of everted-rim lamps in published LB IIB contexts (see LP 2 below).

VIA: PI. 60:10 Str. V: Pis. 63:12; 82:10 These lamps are similar to LP 1, though their size range is somewhat greater, reaching a rim diameter of 18 cm. The main difference between them is the everted rim of LP 2, which continues the line of the body. Rim stance has often been considered a sensitive indicator of stylistic change; rims change mainly for techno-functional reasons, but stylistic considerations may play a role as well (Rice 1987: 270). The reason behind this change from vertical to everted rim is unknown: a vertical rim would seem more practical for preventing spillage of the oil, but an everted rim may have facilitated gripping. These lamps are found in Str. VIII-V with little variation, though PI. 60:10 (Str. VI) is unique at our site in its slightly flattened base and the Str. V lamps are 118</page><page sequence="128">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V somewhat shallower and their everted rims a little longer. There is no visible difference in the degree of the spout's pinch, which remains well developed. None of the lamps from our Str. V has the slight carination below an almost horizontal rim that begins to appear in the second half of the 11th century ( Qasile II: 78, n. 198; Pis. 36:7; 43:2, Str. X). This type continues into Iron II, as evidenced by our LP 4 in Str. IV (Timnah II : 134-135). This may imply that our Str. V terminated before the end of Iron I, though the small sample precludes definitive conclusions and this lack may be the result of other factors, such as regional or functional. As mentioned above in the discussion of LP 1, the everted rim appears in LB IIA but becomes more common in LB IIB, mainly at southern sites. Indeed, everted rims on lamps at northern sites at this time are rare (e.g. Megiddo Ih Pis. 70:6; 72:6, Str. VII; Abu Hawam: 45, No. 279, Str. VA), suggesting that this everted-rim lamp is a regional (southern) and not merely a chronological feature of LB II.

VI: Pl. 55:11 Early Str. V: Pl. 68:19 Two examples of the vessel known as cup-and-saucer were found, one almost complete from Str. VI (Pl. 55: 1 1 , Photo 62) and one fragment from Str. V (Pl. 68: 19). The bowl of PL 55: 1 1 , which is shallow, with a rounded base and everted rim, is similar to that of the typical lamp of this time, LP 2. The internal cup is V-shaped, with a thickened rim. No hole connects the cup and the saucer. The fragment from Str. V appears to be the bottom of a similar cup. Both are undecorated. The Str. VI example is made of a common LB fabric Photo 62. Cup-and-saucer (PI. 55:11). (FG D), while the Str. V fragment is made of a typical Iron I fabric (FG K). This suggests that, despite the continuity of the shape, each is a product of the local ceramic repertoire of its time, so that the continuity of production spanned the change in the clay recipe that characterized the transition from Str. VI to V. It seems that, whatever the function of this vessel, it was still a necessary part of the local household in Iron I. The cup-and-saucer is a common vessel type throughout the region, found as far north as Ugarit (Ugaritica II: Fig. 111:2, 6, Ugarit RÃ©cent 2) and south as Egypt, in 19th and 20th Dynasty contexts (Killebrew 1998b: 139-140; Type CA38). Though Killebrew (1998b: 140) claims that there are no known examples from the hill country or Philistia, this vessel has been found at Tell Qasile ( Qasile II: PI. 45:2, Str. XI-X). The chronological range is LB IIB to Iron II (Killebrew 1998b: 78-79). There are many variations of this shape, some with a hole connecting the cup to the saucer, or a pinched rim to the cup. These vessels have been found in domestic, cultic and (less frequently) funerary contexts. In light of these variations, it is difficult to reconstruct the exact use of this vessel and suggestions for its function include illumination, libation offering and incense burning (Killebrew 1998b: 79 and references there). FUNNELS Str. VIII: Pis. 23:10; 33:4; 37:13 Str. VII: Pl. 46:11-12 Six funnels were found: four in Str. VIII (two complete and two fragmentary) and two fragments from Str. VII (Photo 63). The diameter of the narrow opening is 4.5-5 cm. The length of the narrow part of the funnel 119</page><page sequence="129">CHAPTER TWO Photo 63. Funnel (PL 37:13). differs, ranging from as little as 2.5 cm to as much as 6 cm. The body on the two complete examples varies: PI. 33:4 is straight-sided, while PL 37:13 (and apparently Pl. 23:10) have a rounded body. Pl. 37:13 has a rim diameter of 22 cm, while of Pl. 33:4 is 16 cm; thus, the former funnel was used to pour larger amounts of liquids or solids, or to fill a wider vessel. The funnels were wheel-made, apparently by producing the bowl- like top first and then adding the narrow mouth when the bowl was turned upside down (a join mark can be seen on Pl. 23:10). These were apparently specialty items produced for specific tasks and vessel sizes. The lack of funnels in earlier or later contexts might simply be due to the poorer state of preservation of the strata other than VIII and VII, especially Str. VI and V. On the other hand, funnels could have been made of other materials as well. The funnel is an object whose form is dictated by its function. Published parallels to our funnels are rare and none of the parallels listed below is exactly like ours, a variability that reflects the adaptive nature of this vessel. It is interesting that such a "practical" vessel has been found in tomb contexts as well. Selected parallels Lachish: Lachish II: Pl.

About 12 cm above the base, there are traces of a hole in the wall. It is made of a fabric (FG K) that first appears in Str. VI but becomes common in Str. V. Such stands are considered cult stands rather than functional supports for vessels because of their large size and the "windows" that are often cut in their sides (Muller 2002: 79, Type H). Numerous variations of such cylindrical stands with holes, ranging from LB II to Iron II, may be found, e.g. Lachish ( Lachish II: Pl. LIIL328, 331, Fosse Temple III; Hazor (Zuckerman 2003: Pl. 4.11:3, body fragment, incised, LB II); Beth-Shean (James 1966: Fig. 53:14, Level VI); Ashdod ( Ashdod VI: Pl. 111:26:9-9, Str.

The opposite side has a line from which short perpendicular lines extend. Note a krater from Gezer with what is apparently a horned animal incised on the vessel's interior (Macalister 1912b: PL CXXIV:32). SUMMARY The detailed quantitative typological study of the pottery assemblages of Str. XII-V has enabled us to distinguish certain patterns of intra-site distribution, as well as regional distinctions, though the latter are limited in scope by publication lacunae. Chronological conclusions may be drawn as well, though the utilization of pottery alone to determine chronology should be treated with due caution. The direct and simple correlation of ceramic change with historical events is not a valid method of dating archaeological contexts, since the reasons behind ceramic change (and continuity) are extremely complex and can express a multitude of variables, including environment, production technology, organization of production, potters' skill, distribution and marketing, population characteristics and movements, culinary habits, belief systems and cultic practices, trade relations, political complexity, among many others (e.g. Nicklin 1971; Rice 1984b: 250-252; 1987: 449-468; Arnold 1985: 220-224; Stark 1999: 29-30; London 2000). Indeed, during the period of some 700 years covered by our assemblages, we found only limited correlation between historical events and their immediate impact on the ceramics, as well as other aspects of material culture (Adams 1979). Here we present our insights concerning the quantitative appearance and disappearance of pottery types, and the possible factors that lie behind these trends, within a temporal, spatial and historical framework. MIDDLE AND LATE BRONZE AGE Str. XII-XI The pottery assemblage of the earliest strata is the most fragmentary, due both to limited exposure and to the fact that this occupation left behind practically no complete vessels or objects, though it possibly ended in a partial destruction {Jimnah 1: 41). The small part of the massive building that was uncovered was divided into two strata (XII-XI), though essentially Str. XI marks a floor raising of Str. XII; the faint traces of destruction belong to Str. XI. No difference could be discerned between the pottery assemblages of these two phases and they may be considered successive occupation phases with no discernible gap between them. Most of the pottery from this building presented in Pis. 6-8 comes from the Str. XI floors. Since the ceramic database for Str. XII-XI is so small (only 99 sherds), the quantitative registration lacks significance and serves mainly to indicate the presence or absence of pottery types. The typological designations are based mainly on rims, as well as on analogies with known contemporary shapes. The bowls are both open rounded and carinated. The open bowls almost all have treated rims (BL 44, 45, 47, 53a). Softly carinated closed bowls (BL46) do occur, but these are rare, while the angular type, open and closed, is somewhat more common (BL 56, 56a); the low angular profile of BL 56 in Str. XI recalls that of some "Eggshell Ware" bowls, though they lack the characteristic delicacy of that group. Three complete or almost complete examples of the semi-closed carinated bowl (BL 56a) are the most complete vessels in this stratum; these were found in a deep layer of brick debris above the Str. XI Floor B1205 ( Timnah I: 40- 41). Only a few bowls are red-slipped and burnished or have a red band painted on the rim. The preserved bases are mostly concave disc bases, while a few ring bases were found. Two cooking pot types, hand-made straight-sided (CP 16) and wheel-made globular (CP 17), were identified; the former is rare, while the latter is common and had various types of molded, gutter or rolled rims. The storage jars (of which only rims were preserved) are of two basic types: the majority (52%) are molded rims of Type SJ 4 (several large enough to have belonged to pithoi), while 36% are plain or externally folded rims of Type S J 1. Two jug fragment with a double-strand shoulder handle were found. The juglets are dipper juglets with short ovoid bodies with a pointed base (JT 1). No cylindrical or piriform juglets were found, though the base sherd of the Tell el- Yahudiyeh juglet (from Str. XI) belongs to the latter type. All the pottery in Str. XII-XI, except for the straight- walled cooking pots, is wheel-made ware of relatively good quality; no distortion of vessels was noted and the finish of most is smooth and even. A notable feature of one of the common fabric groups (FG B) is the large amount of dark inclusions visible in the fabric surface, lending it a gravelly look. This fabric is less aesthetically 121</page><page sequence="131">CHAPTER TWO pleasing than the others and indeed was used more frequently for storage jars than bowls, which had much fewer inclusions. The two main fabrics used for all the ceramic types (with the exception of the cooking pots) in Str. XII-XI are FG A and B, with three minor fabrics (FG E, F, G). While FG A, B and F do continue to be used in the LB strata, they become progressively less frequent as the period advances, while FG E becomes much more common. FG A, B, E and G all originate in marl of the Taqiye Formation, while FG F belongs to the loess group. Thus, there were at least two different clay sources, perhaps representing at least two different production venues, one supplying much more pottery than the other. The fabric of the straight-walled cooking pots (FG P2) was used exclusively for their manufacture. Moreover, the fabric group (FG PI) most commonly used for the wheel-made globular cooking pots is different from that subsequently employed in the manufacture of most of the LB cooking pots (FG P3). Thus, the distribution of fabrics is an additional factor that differentiates the pottery of Str. XII-XI from subsequent developments, though there is a modicum of continuity as well (see below). The characteristics of our small Str. XII-XI assemblage find parallels in various sites that point generally to MB IIB88 as the .context for most of our shapes. While several types, such as the open bowl with molded rim (BL 47), the softly carinated bowl (BL 46), the straight-sided cooking pot with perforations (CP 16), the molded-rim storage jar (SJ 4) and double-strand shoulder handle on small jugs, originate in MB IIA (e.g. Aphek A XV-XIV) or in contexts that represent the MB IIA-B transition (e.g. Kabri Tomb 498 and Gezer Str. XXII), these types continue during MB IIB as well (e.g. Dan Tomb 4663, Beth-Shean Str. R3, Mevorakh Str. XIII-XII; Tell Beit Mirsim Str. E). However, some shapes are not found in MB IIA and thus help to narrow the date to MB IIB, such as the angular carinated bowl (BL 56, 56a) and the everted folded storage jar rim exterior (SJ 1). They are paralleled in MB IIB contexts, as well as some continuing into early LB I (e.g. Gezer XIX-XVIII; Megiddo X; Shiloh VIII-VII; Tel Qashish VIII-VIIB; Beth-Shemesh Tomb 17; Tell Beit Mirsim Str. D). The four sherds of Tell el-Yahudiyeh ware found on a Str. XI floor may suggest that this stratum did not continue until the very end of MB II, since this ware apparently became progressively less common towards the end of this period (Kaplan 1980; Maeir 1997: 134; Bietak 1986); while such juglets do occur in the terminal phases of MB II in contexts such as Tell el-Dab 4 a Str. D/2, they are very rare at this time (Bietak 1991: 46). There is a general lack of red slip and burnish on both open and closed vessels in Str. XII-XI, a trait more typical of the latter part of MB II. The total lack in our Str. XI of "Eggshell Ware", a group considered typical of the final stages of the MB, may be of chronological significance, though it is certainly possible as well that this absence is the result of our small sample. Another type that is considered common especially in the south at the very end of the MB, the cylindrical juglet (Maeir 1997: 114), is lacking in our assemblage. The straight-walled cooking pots with perforations under the rim were found in a Str. XII locus; such cooking pots are more common in MB IIA to mid-MB IIB and become rare in late MB IIB. Ultimately, of course, we must exercise extreme caution when drawing any such conclusions in light of the very small size and fragmentary nature of our sample. Moreover, regional, functional, economic and other factors, rather than chronological ones, may play a role in the absence of types as well. Though we have several ceramic types that typically terminate before the end of MB II and we lack certain types generally found at that time in our region, we cannot ignore the presence of other types that do continue until the end of MB II. Thus, we may summarize the chronological aspect of our ceramic data by attributing Str. XII-XI broadly to MB IIB. The questions of whether this occupation lasted until the end of the period and what was the reason for its termination remain something of a quandary. On one hand, the accumulative ceramic evidence as detailed above appears slightly to favor a termination before the very end of MB IIB; we may add to this the total lack of Bichrome Ware or the LC Cypriot imports that do appear in the subsequent Str. X. On the other hand, there is little red slip or burnish in Str. XI and the open carinated bowl and folded exterior rim storage jar are types that are well known in late MB IIB contexts and continue into LB I. Comparison to Tell el-Dab 4 a shows that our Str. XII-XI can be paralleled to Str. E/2 and more closely to Str. E/l-D/3, while elements of Str. D/2 seem more comparable to our Str. X (see below).89 Thus, it seems possible that Str. XI did not last until the very end of MB II, defined by the end of the 15th Dynasty (Dever 1985: 70; 1992: 47; Bietak 2002). Another factor that must be considered in our assessment of the end of Str. XI is its relationship to the subsequent Str. X. Since we postulate that there was no significant gap between the two strata and that Str. X should be dated to LB IA, beginning at the end of the 15 th Dynasty /beginning of 122</page><page sequence="132">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V the 1 8th Dynasty (see below), it seems likely that Str. XI lasted until some time in the first half of the 16th century, though this basically remains unproven by the meager ceramic data and other finds. Related to our estimation of when Str. XI terminated is the reason for its end. Various possibilities have been suggested for the destructions suffered by many Canaanite cities at the end of the MB, and there seems to have been no monolithic cause behind these occurrences; the scenarios (and combinations thereof) include Egyptian military campaigns, natural factors such as earthquake or drought, internal strife, nomadic attacks, economic failures and ethnic influx (Hoffmeier 1989; Bunimovitz 1989: 9-11; Dever 1990; Bietak 1991: 58; Ilan 1995: 314-315; Maeir 1997: 270). The limited exposure of our Str. XII-XI precludes any attempt to relate its temination to any one (or more) of these causes. Though it has been suggested that southern sites were the victims of the Egyptian efforts to expel, pursue and punish the Hyksos and their accomplices in southern Canaan, while northern sites were destroyed at a later date (Weinstein 1981, 1991; Bietak 1991: 58-61), this has been countered by suggestions of a much more complex social and temporal situation (Bunimovitz 1989: 9-11, 34-37; Ilan 1995: 314). Indeed, we have no clear evidence to relate the end of Str. XI to these Egyptian campaigns and other factors may have played a role in its termination, especially in light of our suggestion that its end slightly predates the destruction of Avaris (Tell el-Dab 4 a Str. D/2) and thus the punitive Egyptian campaigns. The fact that the subsequent Str. X was also destroyed (see below) fits the pattern of several other sites that suffered multiple destructions at the end of the MB and continuing in LB I, such as Shechem (Dever 1990: 76; 1992: 48), Megiddo Str. X and IX, and Tell el-4 Ajjul Cities III, Ha and lib (Artzy 2001 : 166).90 Since it is acknowledged that these destructions (whatever their reason) took place over an extended period (Bietak 2002: 37-38; Bunimovitz 1995: 322), from the early 16th century until as late as the reign of Thutmosis III, we may place the end of our Str. XI relatively early in this sequence (slightly before the mid- 16th century?) and the destruction of Str. X later. As for regionality, it seems that most of the pottery types represented in our Str. XII-XI have parallels in MB IIB contexts throughout the country, including Lachish, Beth-Shemesh, Gezer, Tell Beit Mirsim, Aphek, Mevorakh, Beth-Shean, Tel Qashish, Hazor, Dan and Kabri. Notably, contemporary parallels are rare at Ashdod, though this may be the result of technical factors, such as lack of publication or exposure. Maeir (1997: 93-94) contends that several types are more common in the south in the final stages of this period, such as the globular cooking pot (CP 17) and the semi- closed carinated bowl with everted rim (BL 56a), while the open carinated bowls (BL 56) are more common in the north at this time. Indeed, the latter is not common at Batash in Str. XII-XI. The straight-sided cooking pot as well (though with plastic decoration below the rim rather than holes) is more common in the south in MB IIB (Bonfil in preparation). Bietak (1991: 59-60) remarks that Tell el-Yahudiyeh piriform juglets of Type 2a are an Egyptian type that is typical of southern Canaan, as well as along the coast. These southern traits may well point to ceramic production and distribution that were overseen to some degree by one of the large integrated city-states in the area (Tel Miqne or Lachish?). Str. X The remains of Str. X (Building 720) were built directly over the "Citadel" with an entirely different plan, so that this phase marks a departure in function from the previous occupation. As mentioned above, no fortifications were identified in this stratum or subsequent ones. The walls, floors, installations and destruction debris of this building were built directly over the remains of Str. XII-XI and were directly covered by the walls and floors of Str. IX, creating a clear and tight stratigraphie sequence with no apparent gaps ( Timnah IÄ£. 41-45). Though the architectural remains are scanty, the ceramic assemblage (255 vessels and sherds) recovered from the destruction debris of Str. X, as well as the relative stratigraphy, allow us to attempt an assessment of the time and nature of this occupation. Three bowl types that continue from Str. XII-XI (BL 47, 46, 56a) are minority types in Str. X and constitute no more than 13% of the bowls in this building. The main bowl types of this stratum are those that will become dominant in almost all of the subsequent LB strata (IX-VI). The open rounded bowls, with a plain rim (BL 50a-b) or with a thickened inner rim (BL 53al-2, 53bl-2), are the most common (53% of the bowls). The open carinated bowl (BL 56) comprises 19% of the bowls; it too began in small amounts in the previous stratum. Among these open carinated bowls is a shape (e.g. PI. 10:3) that is common in the Chocolate-on- White (or White) Ware repertoire, though none of these bowls belongs to that particular ware. One example of an "Egyptian-style" bowl (BL 55, Pl. 1 1 : 1) was found. Ring bases dominate the bowls, though concave disc bases are 123</page><page sequence="133">CHAPTER TWO found as well. All are undecorated, apart from two bowls with red slip and hand burnish. In Str. X there were only four krater sherds, three of which are forerunners of the ubiquitous LB carinated krater (KR 1), while one (KR 4, PI. 11:7) has a globular shape that is more typical of MB II than the LB. Among cooking pots, the globular type that was so common in Str. XII-XI (CP 17) is represented in Str. X by only two apparently residual rims, the straight-sided type (CP 16) entirely disappears, and the debut of the open carinated cooking pot that will become the generic LB type marks something of a revolution at this time. This cooking pot occurs in two variations in Str. X, the majority (52% of all cooking pots) with a plain everted rim (CP 2), and 42% with a triangular rim exterior (CP 1), the quintessential trait of LB cooking pot rims. These numbers imply a gradual but definite development from the MB to LB tradition in cooking pots ( Qashish : 285). The storage jars of Str. X (Pis. 12-13) reflect a similar trend: of the molded-rim type (SJ 4), only eight small rim fragments were found (13%) and the everted folded rim exterior type (SJ 1) decreases as well (23%), though several complete jars of the latter type were found. Alongside these typically MB II types, together comprising 36% of all storage jars, we should note the appearance of the generic LB storage jar with more tapering body and thickened rounded rim (SJ 2), whose subtypes together now comprise 43% of all storage jars (of these, 23% are SJ 2a, with a short thickened rim that is the forerunner of the typical longer thickened rim of SJ 2; small quantities of the painted storage jar S J 2c appear as well). The painted storage jars are more typical of the LB style than MB II, in which bichrome painted storage jars were a minority style (Ilan 1996: 165). Thus, we have an almost equal mix of MB and LB storage jar types. An almost exclusively MB II type that is well documented in Str. X is the pithos (PT 1). Since the material of Str. XII-XI is so fragmentary, we could only deduce the existence of this common MB II class in these strata by the large diameter of some of the rims classified as storage jars. However, the Str. X corpus includes about ten such vessels, two of which were complete after restoration (PI. 12: 1-2). To this we may add SJ 5 (8% of the jars), a large storage jar that is of "small pithos" stature. Pithoi become virtually non-existent in the LB (Amiran 1969: 143). Typical LB types that make their initial appearance in Str. X, albeit in small amounts and only as sherds, are the piriform jug with rounded base (JG 1) and the biconical vessel. Two jugs with characteristics of the Bichrome Ware family (JG 3) found in this stratum are notable; one of these (PI. 14:1) is an import from Cyprus and can be considered "true" Bichrome Ware. A juglet (JT 2, PI. 14:9) found in this stratum had a short rounded body that is closely paralleled in LB I contexts elsewhere, such as Lachish Fosse Temple I, Tel Mevorakh Str. XI and Shiloh Str. VI. Str. X sees the initial appearance of Cypriot imports at our site in small amounts; in addition to the Bichrome Ware jug mentioned above, these comprise transitional MC-LC Monochrome (PI. 10:20-21), LC White Slip I (PI. 10:23-24) and Transitional White Slip II, as well as a few non-indicative body sherds of closed Base Ring vessels. Note also the locally made imitation of a White Slip hemispherical bowl (PI. 10:22). Though these are all sherds, their stratigraphie contexts are secure and they may be taken into account in the chronological and socioeconomic assessment of Str. X. Their presence implies an organized trade network and an inland population that was willing and able to consume such goods in this early period, when Cypriot imports were still relatively rare in inland regions (Yannai 2000b: 62; Oren 2001: 142). Oren (2001: 140) suggests that the presence of a large amount of White Slip I vessels in the palace complex at Tell el-4 Ajjul alludes to an elite and affluent community. The local vessels of Str. X are mostly wheel-made and of reasonably good quality in general, though several bowls and storage jars were distorted during manufacture and some vessels have traces of smoothing. The fabrics of Str. X are a mix of the dominant MB and LB types. FG A and B, which were frequent in Str. XII-XI (48% and 38% respectively), continue in relatively large amounts in Str. X (36% and 21% respectively; see Table 4). Concurrently, the fabrics that will be overwhelmingly dominant in the LB pottery (FG D and E) are together almost equally represented (3 1 % and 33% respectively). Though all these fabric groups belong to the same pÃ©trographie group of marl of the Taqiye Formation and thus do not represent a departure in the basic source of clay procurement, there is a clear differentiation between these fabric groups in the preparation and firing of the clay, which can be discerned by visual examination (see Chapter II. 2). The fabric group that derives from loess (FG F) continues to be found in Str. X in slightly larger amounts (10%); thus, this clay source/workshop(s) continued to provide vessels to the Str. X occupants as well. It should be noted, however, that the cooking pot fabric used in Str. X, changes to the type that will become most dominant in subsequent strata (FG P3), along with a typological shift to the LB-type cooking 124</page><page sequence="134">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V pot. Thus, there is a higher degree of similarity in both frequency and types of fabric groups between Str. XII-XI and X than between Str. X and the subsequent LB strata, though there is a definite affinity with the latter as well. This, along with the typological discussion above, emphasizes the transitional nature of the Str. X ceramic assemblage; some new shapes are made with the "old" fabric formulae, while previously existing forms are manufactured with the "new" fabric mixes. Clay procurement and preparation are features of ceramic production that are well known for their conservativism, making it imperative to explain any innovation (Rice 1984b: 241; 1987: 115-119; Arnold 1985: 32-57; Aronson et al. 1994: 88-89; Kramer 1997: 53). While the continued use of marl of the Taqiye Formation most likely represents the continued operation of the pottery production center(s) that served Tel Batash in Str. XII-XI, the apparent changes in procurement strategy and fabric preparation techniques that are introduced in Str. X may reflect changes in various factors, such as (among others) ecological circumstances, access to natural resources, technology, population, consumer demand, level of production, market strategy, culinary habits, political domination. The cumulative data described above point to a distinct continuity from MB II that is nevertheless accompanied by marked changes in many of the ceramic types and fabric groups, which essentially launch the "classic" LB ceramic sequence. This was not a dramatic cultural break (Ilan 1995: 314) but rather an accelerated progression along a cultural continuum, justifying the designation of "transitional MB-LB" (Dever 1992a: 16). In a sense, the impression created is of one (shorter?) leg standing in the MB pottery tradition and the other (longer?) leg in the LB tradition; this is reflected by both typology and technology, as well as the presence and types of Cypriot imports. Most of the dominant ceramic types of Str. X can be paralleled in late MB II and early LB I contexts, e.g. Lachish Fosse Temple I, Beth-Shemesh IVa, Gezer XIX-XVm (Cave 1. 10A), Tell Beit Mirsim D, Miqne X-IX, Megiddo X, Beth-Shean R3-2, Shiloh VII-VI and Qashish VIII-VII. We must of course bear in mind that the assemblage found in Str. X Building 720 represents a "snapshot" of its final use and that these ceramic traditions and technology took some time to coalesce. Concerning the role played by the Cypriot pottery in the chronology of Str. X, we may note that of the imports usually considered typical of the transitional MB-LB phase, White Painted VI and Red on Black do not occur at all at Batash; Bichrome and Monochrome Wares, which do appear, continue into LB I as well (Chapter III; see also below on the Bichrome Ware). The Late Cypriot imports found in our Str. X (White Slip I, transitional White Slip II and Base Ring) are generally considered to herald the true beginning of the LB and to be typical of its first phase (Gittlen 1977: 515; Oren 2001: 142). Though their presence in earlier contexts is debated (Bergoffen 2001: 31; Eriksson 2001), the Canaanite and Egyptian evidence shows that White Slip I and Bichrome Ware were definitely imported at the very beginning of the 18th Dynasty (Oren 2001: 142; Bietak and Hein 2001: 172; Eriksson 2001: 61, 63).91 These two wares are often found together, as at our site (ÃstrÃ¶m 2000: 153; Bietak 2001: 175; Artzy 2001: 166; Eriksson 2001; Fischer 2001: 226-227). Our eight small sherds of Base Ring are somewhat ambiguous. Though this ware becomes plentiful in the Levant from the time of Thutmosis III, Bergoffen (2001a: 47-48, contra Oren 1969; Oren 2001: 139; Eriksson 2001: 58, 65) contends that this ware is found in contexts dated to the early 18th Dynasty, such as Tell el-'Ajjul. If this is indeed the case, its presence in our Str. X would not be exceptional, though our few and fragmentary sherds preclude definite conclusions. Thus, the general horizon of our Cypriot imports suits the transition from MB to LB in the early phase of the 18th Dynasty, LB IA. Summation of the above data, as well as the relationship to the previous Str. XI, points to a date for Str. X somewhere between the end of the 15th Dynasty and the early 18th Dynasty, most likely ending during the reign of Thutmosis III. There was no obvious gap between Str. XI and X, though it would have taken some time for the town of Str. X to be built on the ruins of the MB II "Citadel". The destruction of Str. X, as suggested above, may be related to the protracted series of destructions that occurred during the course of the 16th century and continuing into the first quarter of the 15th century, until the reign of Thutmosis III (Dever 1992a: 14-16; Bunimovitz 1995: 32 1-322).92 Ultimately, however, as we noted for Str. XI, it is impossible to provide a definite correlation of the destruction of our Str. X building with any particular external or internal event and the cause of this destruction remains unknown. The transition from Str. XI to X at Tel Batash is marked by a major transformation in the character of the settlement as well as a moderate change in the pottery industry, both most likely reflecting significant political and economic flux. Thus, Str. X seems to represent the filtering down of historical events to affect the material 125</page><page sequence="135">CHAPTER TWO culture, though not in a revolutionary or extreme manner (Adams 1979). Multiple factors may stand behind these changes. The influx of new population groups, for example Hurrians from the north or expelled "Hyksos" from the Egyptian delta, has been suggested as an explanation (Mazar 1990: 226; Na'aman 1994; Dever 1997: 292); these may have created new consumer demands that changed the level of production while also introducing new pottery traditions related to decoration, food preparation, serving and cooking (e.g. new cooking pot shapes, the "Egyptian-style" bowl). Other crucial factors were undoubtedly the growing Egyptian interests and intervention in Canaan during the early 1 8th Dynasty (second half of the 16th century), which certainly must have affected the political and economic structure, not only of our region but of the Levant as a whole (Redford 1992: 130). The large storage capacity of Building 720 is notable; this may reflect increased taxes (Maeir 1997: 276-277) or possibly the instability of the times, with local Canaanites storing surplus food supplies in the event of shortage. The destruction of Str. X marks a certain break, as the subsequent Str. IX totally lacks MB elements (see below). As for regionality, the ceramic assemblage of Str. X, with its mix of MB and LB ceramic types, may be paralleled to various assemblages that straddle both periods. Broad comparisons may be made to sites in the Shephelah, such as Beth-Shemesh IVa, Gezer XIX-XVIII, Tell Beit Mirsim D and Miqne X, though it should be borne in mind that the region suffered a relative decline in settlement at this time (Gonen 1984). Parallels were found with Tell el-' Ajjul City II as well. In the north, comparison may be made to Megiddo X, Beth-Shean R3-2; Qashish VIII-VII and Shiloh VII-VI. Thus, it cannot be said that there is a strong regional element to the material culture of this transitional MB-LB phase. This too is a trait typical of LB pottery, which generally demonstrates a relatively low degree of regionalism (see below). The imported Cypriot Bichrome Ware jug in our Str. X is notable, both temporally and spatially. The most recent studies of this ware have shown that these vessels were both imported to the Levant from eastern Cyprus and produced locally; most were wheel-made, though some were hand-made (Artzy 2001: 168; Karageorghis 2001: 148-149; Artzy 2002: 1-3). As noted above, this ware can be found in late MB IIB as well as LB I contexts, such as Tell el-' Ajjul Cities III- I (mainly II), Megiddo Str. X and IX, and Tell el-Dab'a Str. D/2 to C/3 (Amiran 1969: 154; Artzy 2001: 166-168; Bietak 2001). In Canaan, it is more commonly found on the coast and less often inland (Artzy 2001: 167), making our jug an even more outstanding phenomenon. The drawing on our example is poorly executed and has mainly faded away, perhaps indicating the inferior quality of the pigments used (though this of course could be due to post- depositional factors). In any case, this is atypical of the Bichrome Ware vessels, whose designs usually remain quite vivid. Karageorghis (2001: 128-149) describes a category of Bichrome Ware in Cyprus (e.g. from Toumba tou Skourou) whose painting generally consisted of dull red and black bands that did not cover the entire surface of the vessel; since he does not provide chronological information about this group, we cannot establish whether this is a temporal, regional or other feature. Bietak (2001: 177) notes that the earlier examples of Bichrome Ware at Tell el-Dab'a (Str. D/2) have only simple linear patterns. The appearance at Batash of a locally made jug that emulates the Bichrome Ware style (PI. 14:2), found with the imported jug, is interesting, recalling the White Slip I bowls and the contemporary imitation described above. This reflects the diversity of the ceramic industry and the consumer demand for these foreign wares. The local potters were capable of copying the original, even when it had only recently come on the market. Since imports were available, it cannot be claimed that the imitations were a substitute for imports, and other reason for their production should be sought. The Cypriot imports may have represented a challenge to the local potters, who attempted to compete with this ware by copying it. The "Hyksos" scarab (PI. 14:15) found in the dismantling of the lime cover over cobble stone floor 717 may perhaps be understood as an heirloom, as these scarabs are known to have been kept for many years after their original period of use. Two carbon- 14 dates from charred soft organic material in the destruction debris of Building 720 yielded dates that correspond broadly to those proposed by the archaeological framework: the sigma-one dates fall within the range of 1690/1620 to 1600/1520 (see Chapter XX). The cumulative chronological data point to the period of LB IA for Str. X. Str. IX Str. IX represents a direct continuation of Str. X in several ways. This stratum remained unfortified and what appears to be another large dwelling was constructed above the destroyed Str. X Building 720; minor alternations inside the building led to its subdivision into two phases. This 126</page><page sequence="136">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V building (Building 715) was violently destroyed by fire, yielding a restorable pottery assemblage {Jimnah /: 45-52). The walls and floors of the subsequent Str. VIII building were built directly on top of this building, again creating a tight stratigraphie sequence. Notable features of this and subsequent buildings are the thick outer walls (1.35-1.5 m wide) and internal pillar bases ( Timnah IÅ¡. Plans P/S 10-11). The northern wall of this building served as the outer defense line of the town as well. Most of the pottery shown in the plates comes from the final Str. IXA floors of the building, as well as a floor to its east (Locus B857). The last vestiges of purely MB II pottery traditions entirely disappear in Str. IX, aside from a handful of small sherds (BL47, CP2 and SJ 1), which are apparently residual. The ceramic assemblage of this building is firmly entrenched in the LB ceramic tradition. The open bowls (BL 50a-b, 53al-2, 53bl-2) comprise 64% of all bowls, while carinated bowls (BL 56) comprise 29%; thus the proportions of open rounded and carinated bowls in Str. IX are similar to those of Str. X. The open carinated bowls (BL 56) all have well-developed carinations and the shallow type with rounded carination and high ring base disappears. Two examples of the "Egyptian-style" bowl (BL 55) were found in this building. The bowl bases are almost equally divided between ring and regular or concave disc bases; two high or "trumpet" bases could have belonged to either bowls or chalices. This is the last appearance of such bases at our site (apart from one example in Str. VII that may be residual; see below). Though a number of bowls have traces of red slip and burnish, most are otherwise undecorated. The carinated krater (KR 1) is virtually the only krater type present, though with only five examples it is still rare. A unique "pithos krater" (KR 5) was found in this building as well. Aside from the abovementioned three small rim fragments of the open carinated cooking pot with plain everted rim (CP 2), which are apparently residual, the cooking pots belong to a single type, the typical LB cooking pot with an open carinated body and everted triangular exterior rim (CP 1). Among storage jars, the five small rim fragments of the MB II type S J 1 are joined by five rims of SJ 2a, which was most common in the previous Str. X but is now replaced by SJ 2, at 54% by far the most common storage jar; to this we may add another 22% of S J 2c, painted storage jars. Jugs are very rare in this building and only three fragments of the piriform jug (JG 1) that first appeared in Str. X were found. No biconical vessels were found in this building. The body of the three extant juglets is bag-shaped, differing from the short rounded body of JT 2 in the previous stratum. The lamps of this stratum (LP 1) have well-pinched spouts, plain rims and sometimes a somewhat pointed base. The imports in this building include Monochrome bowls, White Slip II hemispherical bowls and Base Ring I and II closed vessels. The coexistence of Base Ring I and II points to an LB IB date; Base Ring II begins to appear in quantities in contexts from the time of Thutmosis III and becomes especially common in LB IB-IIA levels in the Levant (Steel, this volume; Oren 1969: 142; Gittlen 1981: 50; Eriksson 2001: 51). All of the vessels in Str. IX appear to be wheel- made, though, as mentioned above, the cooking pots may have been made by a composite mold and coil technique. Many bowls have prominent smoothing on their upper exterior, while the lower exterior shows traces of scraping above the base. Two lamps (PL 19:6-7) were finished by knife-paring. A feature noted on several storage jars and jugs is a rather careless finish in which clay "smears" or drops were left, mostly under the rim exterior or near handle attachments. The fabrics of Str. IX are mainly FG D and E (3 1 % and 33 % respectively); these (particularly FG D) are commonly used in the LB strata. FG A and B, which were most common in the MB II Str. XII-XI and declined in Str. X, are still represented (19% and 6% of the pottery respectively); the sherds registered as FG B are also typologically earlier. Thus, it seems that the shift in fabric preparation that was first noted in the previous Str. X is well established in Str. IX; it continues with little change until the end of Str. VII (see below). The fabric group of loess origin (FG F) is joined by another fabric group from this source (FG H), though both together comprise only 6% of the vessels in this stratum; this is a decline from the 10% of such vessels in Str. X. One may conclude that the workshop(s) using this clay continued to provide vessels for the occupants of Str. IX, though in very small quantities. The small storage jar decorated in Bichrome Ware style mentioned above (PI. 19:2) was made of an extremely rare fabric at our site in the LB, deriving from the Moza-Amminadav Formations (see Chapter II. 2); thus, this vessel may be termed a "local import". The possible production centers for such a vessel would be located in the Judean hills, where sites of this period are relatively few. This clay source was used for vessels found in various MB and LB burial in the vicinity of Jerusalem, as well as the Amarna Letters sent from Jerusalem and Shechem (Goren et al. 2004: 263-264). The jar may have been transported to Batash for a reason related to its contents, as it is essentially of "amphora size". As noted above 127</page><page sequence="137">CHAPTER TWO for the imported Bichrome Ware jug in Str. X, this ware makes its initial appearance in Canaan in late MB IIB and mainly in early LB I contexts. The question of the latest appearance of this ware is also related to its definition: what do we mean when we say "Bichrome Ware"? The tendency today is to broaden this definition in terms of both technology (wheel- and hand-made, fine and coarse) and provenience (Cyprus and Canaan, imported and local) (Artzy2001: 168; Karageorghis 2001: 148-149). Consequently, our small jar may be assigned to this ceramic group. Vessels defined as Bichrome Ware that would be contemporary with our Str. IX are found in Megiddo IX-VIII(?) {Megiddo II : Pis. 51:9; 59:8), Tell el-Dab4 a Str. C/3 (Bietak 2001: 177, e.g. Figs. 7.9, 14) and LC II contexts at Nitovikla in Cyprus (Huit 2001: 212). Summation of the data as presented above shows that along with the disappearance of the final vestiges of the MB II tradition, Str. IX is characterized by archetypal LB Canaanite pottery types that begin in the previous Str. X and continue virtually unchanged until Str. VII (see below). As such, they do not contribute to a fine- tuned chronological sequence and do not support the separate historical periodization. The few elements in the assemblage that may assist in establishing a more limited chronological framework are the Cypriot imports and the Bichrome-related storage jar, though these are problematic as chronological indicators, due to the circular argumentation that is often used to date their contexts. The Cypriot imports indicate a timeframe of LB IB, not antedating the time of Thutmosis III. The presence of the Bichrome-related jar does not allow us to prolong this stratum much later than the latest contexts in which such pottery has been found (see above). In light of our assumption that Str. IX followed closely on the heels of Str. X, and the tight stratigraphie sequence of the subsequent Str. VIII dated to late LB IB-early LB IIA, we may ascribe Str. IX to LB IB. In absolute terms, a date after Tuthmosis Ill's conquests in the first half of the 15th century seems suitable. Of course, this would depend on the date of the destruction of Str. X, discussed above. The cause of the destruction of the Str. IX building remains unknown. The historical context of this period is the increasing entrenchment of Egyptian hegemony in Canaan following the reign of Thutmosis III. Campaigns to the Levant such as the raids of Amenhotep II may have played a role, though it is not certain that he reached our region (Weinsten 1981; Mazar 1990: 232-233). Local altercations or natural causes may be considered as well. Despite the destruction, there was little disruption of the material culture, and the continuity of many aspects into the subsequent Str. VIII is notable. The assemblage of Str. IX does not manifest clear regionality. Parallels are found at LB sites (and tombs) not only in the nearby Shephelah but throughout the country, e.g. Lachish Fosse Temple I, Gezer XVII-XV, Beth-Shemesh IV, Ashdod XIX-XVII, Megiddo IX-VIII, Hazor 2-lb, Beth-Shean Rla-b and Qashish VIIA-B. The painted storage jars that begin to appear in considerable numbers in this stratum have a certain regional affinity to the north, which will be discussed below. The large "pithos krater" (KR 5, Pl. 17:14) is paralleled mainly in the north as well, though essentially it remains a unique vessel. There are virtually no Egyptian pottery or objects in Str. IX, aside from the one "Egyptian-style" bowl, and a bulla and a sealed stopper (Chapter VI). However, this is to be expected, as overt material remains of Egyptian presence during the mid- 18th Dynasty are rare even at sites that eventually become Egyptian strongholds (Mullins 2002: 315-316, 324-326); see further below. The Str. IX Building 715 was defined as a "patrician dwelling" on the basis of its substantial architecture and the nature of the houses built on top of it (see Chapter IV). However, there is little in the ceramic assemblage to indicate wealth or status; the pottery is basically characteristic of a domestic setting, though the large "pithos krater" is extraordinary in such a context and is paralleled in temple or palace contexts. The presence of Cypriot imports at this time (LB IB) is no longer rare and thus should not be considered a sign of particular wealth or privilege, though it might have been in the previous stratum (Oren 2001: 140). Pits between Str. IX and VIII Four pits were dug into the remains of Str. IX but were covered by elements of Str. VIII ( Timnah /: 51). Since they were apparently dug by the builders of Str. VIII, the meager material found in them should be ascribed to the foundation of the latter stratum. A complete storage jar painted with red horizontal bands (SJ 2c) and a scarab from Pit B919 (Chapter VI) are the only items published from these pits, which otherwise contained only small sherds and debris. These pits also contained 17 sherds of various Cypriot imports. Str. VIII A new building (Building 475) erected directly above the destroyed remains of Str. IX, though with an entirely 128</page><page sequence="138">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V different plan from the previous building, was entirely exposed in the excavations. In it was a thick destruction layer containing numerous restorable vessels and several other objects. Based on the architecture and the finds, this too was defined as a patrician dwelling (see, however, Chapter IV). Its northern wall served as the outer fortification of the town, just like that of its predecessor in Str. IX. It too had extremely wide external walls ( Timnah /: 52-57). The nature and distribution of the finds in this building are discussed at length in Chapter IV. Here we will discuss the chronological, regional and technological aspects of the ceramic assemblage of this house. The open rounded bowls (BL 50a-b, 53al-2, 53b 1-2) comprise 69% of the bowls, while the carinated bowls (BL56, 70) comprise 27%; this is almost identical to the ratio in Str. IX. The carinated bowls are generally well made and only a few have what is considered a slightly degenerate carination (see the discussion of this trait on p. 40). Most bases are disc or concave disc bases and only a handful of ring bases occur. One sherd of the "Egyptian-style" BL 55 (not shown in the plates) was found in this house. The only bowl type that is decorated is BL 70; it is carelessly painted with a red and black design and has two horizontal handles. All the kraters, one of them red-slipped but not burnished, are of the common LB carinated type (KR 1). This building contained three chalices (CH 2), a relatively rare vessel at Tel Batash in general. The cooking pots are all of the typical LB type (CP 1), though they come in a variety of sizes and body shapes. Storage jars are all of the Canaanite type (SJ 2); two small rim fragments of SJ 2a, the short-rimmed type that occurs mainly in Str. X, are apparently residual in this stratum. A unique feature is the large Canaanite jar with four handles (SJ 2b, PI. 29:1-2). Painted storage jars (SJ 2c) comprise 26% of the storage jars, a proportion similar to that of the previous stratum. A number of marked handles in this building, apparently belonging to storage jars (or jugs), are possibly related to a transport function, as noted above. Two small sherds that may have belonged to a pithos with a "wavy band" decoration were found, though this identification is not certain; both were locally made. Two types of jugs (JG 1 and 2), as well as a few biconical vessels with one or two handles (BV la, 2 and 3), were found in this building. While the biconical vessels are mostly decorated, the jugs, with the exception of one small example, are plain. One unique jug (JG 4) is possibly an imitation of a Cypriot shape or an import of a very rare type. The juglets have a squat body and short shoulders (JT 3). Lamps are of both the vertical-rim (LP 1) and the everted-rim (LP 2) types. The Cypriot imports in this building include White Slip II, Base Ring II and White Shaved Wares. Both open and closed vessels were found. One sherd of a Monochrome bowl was found as well, though it is difficult to determine whether this is residual or in situ. No imitation imports were found, apart perhaps from JG 4. Mycenaean imports are found for the first time, though represented only by a fragment of a beaked jug. The vessels in Str. VIII all appear to be wheel-turned, though finishing techniques, such as scraping and smoothing, sometimes obscure the formation techniques. As noted above, it is possible that the cooking pots were made by a mold and coil technique.93 On some of the lamps finger pressing is discernible on the base, perhaps suggesting that they were hand-made. The "assembly line" production mode used for the storage jars, most of similar capacity, contrasts with the more individual mode of manufacture of other vessel classes. The general "feel" of the assemblage is heavy and coarse. On both open and closed vessels there are often highly visible and sometimes irregular smoothing lines; the smoothing frequently swept away larger inclusions that jutted out, leaving an abrasive and sometimes pockmarked surface. A large degree of calcification was noted as well, with holes left by "explosions" around medium and large white particles that are visible on the vessels' surface; this may have occurred during the destruction fire. Some of the bowls and cooking pots were distorted during manufacture. The fabrics continue those that had become more common in Str. IX, especially FG D (at 37% the most frequently used), together with FG C (25%) and FG E (20%). A fabric group that had been common in Str. XI-X (FG A) continues in rather high numbers in Str. VIII (11%), but the other common MB II fabric (FG B) disappears. Marl of the Taqiye Formation is still the basic clay source for most vessels and the percentage of vessels whose fabrics derive from loess diminishes to only 4% (FG F and H). Thus there is a slight decrease in Str. VIII, representing a steady decline since Str. X in this clay source. Summarizing the above data, we can see a clear continuity from Str. IX, accompanied by a certain decline in the quality of ceramic production; though the shapes remain basically the same, the level of finishing is somewhat less careful. However, in general, there are few traits that typologically differentiate this assemblage from its predecessor and successor; such progressive decline is typical of the LB in general. Many of the 129</page><page sequence="139">CHAPTER TWO vessel types continue from LB IB to LB IIA. A few traits may serve to narrow down our assemblage within the LB sequence: shoulder handles on closed vessels are generally an earlier LB trait; the biconical vessels do not appear in substantial amounts in contexts earlier than LB IB; the well-shaped open carinated bowl is more typical of LB I than LB II, when a certain decline and the ultimate disappearance of these bowls occurs. Horizontal handles on bowls, a reflection of Aegean and Cypriot influence on the local pottery, become more common from LB IB. The relatively large amount of vessels painted in red and black seems to fit a time when this style was at its peak, generally considered to be LB I-LB IIA; after this time, most of the decoration is monochrome red. The biconical amphora (B V 3) is most frequently paralleled in LB I contexts and is rarer in LB II. The imports in this stratum do not contribute much to chronological fine-tuning, since they are basically of types that are common in both LB IB and LB IIA. The Monochrome sherd is small, and this ware is indeed no longer found in the Levant after the LB I (Gittlen 198 1 : 50-51). The White Shaved Ware juglets (PI. 37:17-18) are generally most common in LB IIA, though their earliest appearances are in LB IB (Gittlen 1981: 51).94 Base Ring II is much more dominant than Base Ring I in this building, with 17 sherds and vessels and two sherds respectively (see Chapter III). The shift from Base Ring I to Base Ring II began in LB IB and was completed by LB IIA (Gittlen 1981: 51). The sherd of a Mycenaean beaked jug (PI. 37:19), one of the earliest appearances in a settlement context in the Levant (see Chapter III), belongs to the initial stage of Mycenaean imports to the Levant in LB IB (Amiran 1969: 179). Assuming that there was no gap between Str. IX and VIII, and based on our dating of the subsequent Str. VII to the 14th century (the Amarna period), it seems that we may ascribe Str. IX to the second half of the 15th century, possibly continuing into the early 14th century (LB IB-early LB IIA). Note also a scaraboid found in the destruction debris that is dated to the 15th century (Chapter VI). Again, we must consider that this assemblage represents the final use of this building, frozen suddenly in the destruction. As with Str. IX, the destruction of Str. VIII may be related to a variety of factors: Egyptian campaigns further north that brought in their wake a policy of population deportation in Canaan during the reign of Amnehotep II, greatly weakening Canaanite towns (Redford 1992: 168-169); increasing disturbances caused by city-state rivalry or ' Apiru raids, resulting in burning and looting of towns (Redford 1992: 170-172, 208-209); and excessive taxation that depleted local resources during the relatively peaceful time of the pax Aegyptica (Redford 1992: 166-169, 209-213). Whatever the cause, the revival was swift and the impact on the material culture was negligible. No sign of impoverishment or decline could be detected in the subsequent stratum, indicating the vitality of the economy at the time. The limited regionality noted above for Str. IX applies to the Str. VIII assemblage as well. Parallel assemblages at sites close to Tel Batash include Lachish Fosse Temples I- II, Gezer Str. XVII-XV, Beth-Shemesh Str. IV, Tel Harassim, Tell Beit Mirsim Str. C, Tel Miqne Str. X-IX and Ashdod Str. XVII-XV. Northern sites that include comparisons to most of the typical shapes are Shiloh Str. VI, Megiddo Str. VIII-VII, Hazor Str. la-b, Qashish Str. VII-VI and Beth-Shean Str. Rlb-la. The painted storage jar tradition appears to be more common in the north than the south (see further below). The piriform jug with rounded base seems to be more common at southern sites, as is the everted rim on the bowls with thickened inner rim. There is nothing in this stratum apart from one fragment of an "Egyptian-style bowl" and the scaraboid that attests to Egyptian influence on the material culture, ceramic or otherwise. Str. VII Following the violent destruction of the Str. VIII Building 475, a reconstruction took place directly above it, utilizing most of the outer walls of the destroyed building but with an entirely different internal plan. The walls of this house (Building 315), like those of its predecessor, were very wide and its northern outer wall too served as the town's fortification line. The excavated remains of Str. VII in Area B included not only Building 3 1 5 but also a courtyard and part of an additional building to its south, as well as a street to its west. Str. VII ended in a massive destruction by fire ( Timnah /: 58-72). Building 315 too is defined as a "patrician dwelling" and the distribution of its finds is discussed at length in Chapter IV. Essentially, the assemblage is a continuation with little change of that of Str. VIII. The bowl types remain the same, though there is a marked decline in the amount of carinated bowls (BL 56), which now comprise only 12% of the assemblage. Six examples of the "Egyptian- style" (BL 55) bowl were found as well, the largest amount of this type unearthed at Batash. Six chalices were found, three of which were complete enough to be classified as CH 3; a goblet (GB 2) was found as well. All the kraters are of one type (KR 1), the carinated krater with thickened rim and handles. Bowl and krater 130</page><page sequence="140">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V bases are mainly concave discs, though a few rings and two flat bases were found as well; a unique well-formed trumpet base (PL 52:6) may be residual. Cooking pots too continue unchanged (CP 1) and are found in a variety of sizes and shapes. All the storage jars are of the Canaanite type (SJ 2), of which 22% are painted (SJ 2c); the latter percentage remains relatively constant in Str. IX-VII. No pithoi were found. Piriform jugs are almost exclusively of the rim-handle type (JG 1), with only three extant examples of the shoulder-handle type (JG 2); one jug sherd had traces of red slip. Biconical vessels are at their peak, represented by seven examples, most decorated. Two imitation Base Ring jugs were found as well. Juglets are almost all of the same type as Str. VIII (JT 3), though a large number could not be exactly classified due to lack of neck and rim. Lamps are only of the everted-rim type (LP 2). Other vessels in this stratum include one fragment of a flask with drawn "petal-like" handles (FL 2) and a pyxis imitating a Mycenaean alabastron. The Str. VII imports include White Slip II, Base Ring II and White Shaved Ware from Cyprus and a small amount of Mycenaean imports, including a complete alabastron. Both open and closed vessels are represented, as well as a Base Ring bull rhyton and a spindle bottle uniquely produced in the White Shaved fabric and technique. No Red Lustrous spindle bottles were found. The abundant small finds in Building 315 include beads a pair of bronze cymbals, several sheet metal figurines, cylinder seals and scarabs. The manufacture of the Str. VII vessels is essentially similar to that of Str. VIII, with similarities in finishing techniques, vessel distortion and calcification. There appears to have been no change in the level or location of production. Many storage jars have a protruding lump of clay inside, untrimmed remnants of their closure. Some of the bowl bases show cracks on the bottom, suggesting uneven drying and firing conditions (Rice 1987: 67-69, 104-105). The painting on most of the storage jars remains meticulous, though a few (e.g. PL 53: 1-2) do demonstrate a more careless effect. All in all, only a small portion of the assemblage is painted. The fabrics of the Str. VII corpus essentially continue those of Str. VIII, though there is a certain change in proportion. The fabric groups deriving from marl of the Taqiye Formation remain dominant: FG D and E continue to be common, though declining to 28% and 16% as opposed to 37% and 25% respectively in Str. VIII. FG C remains the same (20%). The fabric groups belonging to the loess source show a slight increase: FG F rises to 4%, FG H remains 2%. Notably, FG A, which was dominant in earlier strata (XII-X), returns to comprise 29% of the fabrics. While this fabric group is defined as belonging to marl of the Taqiye Formation, we noted that there is a similarity in its appearance to that of the loess clays typical of Iron I; consequently, some of the fabrics that we assigned to FG A (marl) may actually derive from loess (see Chapter II.2). Thus, the rise in the use of FG A in Str. VII (mostly for jugs, somewhat less so for bowls and storage jars) might be partially related to an increase in a loess clay source for the vessels in this level. However, such a conclusion must be treated with due caution and the pottery industry seems to remain essentially unchanged in Str. VII. Summarizing the above data, it may be seen that there is a very high degree of continuity between the Str. VIII and VII ceramic assemblages in both typology and technology; this is despite the violent destruction that separated the two occupations and the assumed political shift of the Amarna period, to which this stratum is ascribed. Very few ceramic parameters may be used to pinpoint the chronological horizon, though we may consider such traits as the deeper bowl proportions, the virtual disappearance of shoulder handles on jugs, the predominance of everted rim lamps, and the numerous biconical vessels and imitations of Base Ring jugs. Other factors that assist us to date this stratum are the imported pottery and other the objects. LB IIA sees the peak of Cypriot imports to the Levant, and White Slip II hemispherical bowls and White Shaved juglets become common at this time. The rare White Shaved version of the spindle bottle must have been made at a time when the Red Lustrous Wheel-made Ware was well known on Cyprus, and when White Shaved Ware was popular there and exported in large numbers to the Levant. The peak of the former ware on Cyprus is LC IIA-B (Eriksson 1991: 89), while the peak of White Shaved ware exports to the Levant is LB IIA (Gittlen 1981: 51). The complete Mycenaean alabastron in Building 3 15 is dated to LH IIIA:2 (Chapter III). Base Ring bull rhyta appear predominantly in LB IIA contexts (Nys 2000: 99). The parallels to the plaque figurine (Chapter X) and the dates ascribed to the scarabs of Amenhotep III and Ty (Chapter VI) and the cylinder seals (Chapter VIII) all point to a 14th-century date. The destruction of Str. VII should be viewed against the general background of Egyptian domination at this time, specifically in the framework of internecine strife between the Canaanite city-states that is so well documented in the Egyptian texts, particularly 131</page><page sequence="141">CHAPTER TWO the Amarna Letters (Na'aman 1975, 1992: 177-179; Bunimovitz 1989; Mazar 1990: 233-234). The role played by the nomadic ' Apiru in the geopolitical system of the time must be considered as well; a group of letters from southern Canaan reflects the strife caused by these bands, apparently resulting in destructions and the desertion of a number of cities in this region (Na'aman 1975: 145-153; Goren et al. 2004). The reason for the growing influence of these nomads in the region at this time may be related to the overextension of the smaller Canaanite city-state vassals, who apparently practiced excess in their conspicuous consumption of luxuries, resulting in a gap between their economic base and their ability to support such a lifestyle and pay levies to the Egyptians (BieÅkowski 1986: 137-156; 1989; Knapp 1992; Bunimovitz 1995: 325-325). The Amarna Age was a time of relative disengagement on the part of the Egyptians in Asia, since they were more occupied with internal matters (Weinstein 1981; Mullins 2002: 17). This is apparently the background for the destruction of our Str. VII; in fact, the town's prosperity did not revive in the following Str. VI (see below). It is uncertain whether Str. XVI at Gezer, which was the city-state that apparently controlled Batash during the Amarna Age, was destroyed at all and whether its end is contemporary with that of Str. VII at Batash. If so, then this marks a general breakdown of the established city-state system in the region at some time in the second half of the 14th century. Regionality is minimal in Str. VII, continuing the trend that we noted for the previous LB strata. Parallels to the main pottery types could be found among all the published LB II assemblages, including Lachish Fosse Temples II- III, Beth-Shemesh Str. IV, Tell Beit Mirsim Str. C, Gezer Str. XVI-XV, Miqne Str. IX-VIII, Ashdod Str. XVII-XIV, Aphek Str. X14-X12, Megiddo Str. Vni-VII and Hazor Str. la-b. As in the previous stratum, it was suggested that the more elaborate painted storage jars find their best parallels at northern sites; if this indeed is a northern trait, it seems that the mode of painting itself was the "import", since the jars were locally produced. It should be noted that the sheet metal figurines have a possible northern affinity as well (Chapter V). Another possible regional item is the Base Ring bull rhyton; Nys (2001: 99) claimed that two-thirds of these were found in southern contexts in Canaan. It is interesting to note the presence of a Cypriot cylinder seal alongside the cylinder seals in Mitannian Common Style and local Canaanite style in this building; the former was a "meaningful symbol of authority" (Chapter IX). Nys (2001: 100-101) claims that Base Ring bull rhyta usually occur outside Cyprus in funerary contexts and that when they are found in dwellings, these are usually public buildings or palaces; she speculates whether such rhyta could be a sign of the actual presence of Cypriots involved in the import of pottery or other aspects of trade. Whatever the explanation, these items of Cypriot affinity, along with the very rare White Shaved spindle bottle, point to an intensified Cypriot connection. The increased amount of "Egyptian-style" bowls, as well as the scarabs (Chapter VI) and possibly the beads (Chapter XI.7), attest to a larger Egyptian influence on the local material culture than in any other stratum. However, this influence never exceeds minimal representation and remains typical of a peripheral town in a marginal region of the great empire. It may point merely to increased availability of such objects rather than other phenomena, such as "elite emulation" (e.g. Higgenbotham 2000). Str. VI The total destruction of the Str. VII Building 315 marks the end of the series of "patrician dwellings*' built on the same spot. On top of the ruins of this building and its environs, an occupation level of a drastically different nature was revealed. It was poorly preserved and, though two sub- phases were discerned, yielded relatively few finds. The arrangement by which the external walls of the buildings served as a defensive line no longer existed and there seem to have been more open spaces in the town. The earlier phase, Str. VIB, is represented by widely dispersed fragmentary segments of buildings; this phase apparently suffered (partial?) destruction, evidenced by a thin layer of reddish burnt debris ( Timnah /: 73). The subsequent phase, Str. VIA, should essentially be understood as an independent stratum, in which a new and rather substantial building (442) was built. This latter building continued in use with some alterations in the subsequent Str. V ( Timnah /: 72-76). However, any discussion of Str. VI must take into account the fact that the entire northeastern part of Area B in this stratum is badly eroded. Though Str. VIA and VIB are separated by a (partial?) destruction and there is a definite functional difference between them, the pottery (apart perhaps from the imports) does not reflect this, though this may be the result of poor preservation. The bowls in Str. VI are only of the open rounded type; the plain-rimmed bowl (BL 50b-c) has deeper proportions, and the bowl with thickened inner rim (BL 53al-2, bl-2) is mostly of large size and has a red band on its rim. Neither the 132</page><page sequence="142">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V LB cannateci bowl (BL 56) nor the cyma-shaped bowl (BL 59) that becomes popular at the end of LB and in Iron I appears at our site in either phase of Str. VI. No "Egyptian-style" bowls (BL 55) appear either. The few preserved bowl bases are concave discs. About 10% of the bowls are decorated: a handful have painted red and black or red designs, including vertical hatches on the rim and a red cross inside, and note also the red rim mentioned above. One bowl has red slip with irregular burnish. A small rim and handle sherd appears to belong to an imitation Base Ring bowl. A complete cup-and- saucer was found in this stratum. The krater type that appears throughout the LB strata (KR 1) continues as the sole type, with the possible exception of one fragment of a new type (KR 7). The cooking pots were entirely of the LB type (CP 1) as well, aside from one fragment of CP 6. Only rims and bases of storage jars were found. The ubiquitous LB Canaanite jar (SJ 2 and its subtypes) is almost entirely absent, while what appears to be a derivative type with a plain rim (SJ 3) becomes the most common jar; comparisons to complete vessels at other sites suggest that it may have had a narrow ovoid body with four handles. Two thick rounded rims that are possibly "collared-rim" pithoi were found (PT 2), though this type is rare in our region. The typical LB piriform jug is totally absent and in fact jugs are rare; one complete jug was found (JG 5, PI. 60:23), as was the intact base and body of an imitation Base Ring jug (JG 15). A few biconical jugs were found as well, including one complete vessel (BVlb) and a rim with remains of a basket handle; these were all undecorated. Two rims and ridged necks of the class termed "closed vessels" (CV 2) were found; these may have been jugs or storage jars. Three short, ovoid juglet bodies with a tapering base could not be classified. The lamps are all of the everted-rim type (LP 2). A flask and a fragment of a female plaque figurine were found in debris in Area C attributed to Str. VI ( Timnah /: 98). In Str. VI the Cypriot imports decline greatly in number and are fragmentary, consisting of small sherds of Base Ring II open and closed vessels, White Slip II and White Slip "Late" hemispherical bowls, and White Shaved juglets. No Mycenaean ware was found in this stratum. It should be noted that half of the imported sherds came from secure Str. VIB loci, while the rest, apart from three small fragments in the Str. VIA Building 442, were from a debris layer in an open area that covered the destroyed Str. VII Building 315 and was thus generally attributed to Str. VI. Most of the vessels of this period are wheel-made and well shaped. The exterior of many vessels have irregular smoothing lines; some calcification is evident and some vessel surfaces have obvious inclusions. The interior base of storage jars often has the same type of untrimmed clay finish as noted for previous strata. However, most of the vessels appear hard-fired and lack cores. Though the sample is fragmentary and is difficult to assess, it seems that there was no further decline in the quality of the pottery in Str. VI, though basically it remains a plain domestic group of pottery. The fabric groups basically continue those used in the previous stratum. FG C, D and F appear in almost the same amounts, FG H greatly increases, FG A greatly decreases and FG E vanishes. Two new fabric groups, FG I and K, are introduced in this stratum, both continuing into Str. V, though they appear in relatively small amounts. FG I is used only for bowls and chalices, while FG K is used mostly for bowls and storage jars. Notably, these two new fabric groups belong to the loess clay with fine quartz grains, which becomes the dominant clay source in Str. V. The cooking pots are made both from the fabric that was common in the LB strata (FG P3) and from a newly introduced fabric (FG P4) that will become common in Str. V. There appear to be rather more regional parallels to sites in the Shephelah and southern coast in Str. VI than in the previous LB strata. For example, the four-handled storage jar (if indeed our rims, handles and bases of SJ 3 belong to this type), the red rim on bowls, the everted rim on BL 53 and the deeper rounded bowl are all typical of southern sites in LB IIB. The above data do not permit definitive chronological conclusions. While there is a basic continuity of many shapes and manufacturing traits from Str. VII, certain key types that were hallmarks of the long-lived LB pottery tradition cease to exist. Moreover, some elements, both typological and technological, that will continue into Str. V are introduced. The following factors should be noted in an attempt to narrow down the chronological framework for Str. VI. The rims and bases of SJ 3 may have belonged to the four-handled storage jars that are typical of southern assemblages of the late 13th and early 12th centuries. The smaller size and deeper proportions of our open rounded bowls are traits more typical of late LB II. Though the cup-and-saucer is found as early as LB IIA, it is most common in LB IIB onward. All the cooking pots are in the LB tradition of everted triangular rims. The squat proportions and basket handle on the biconical vessels indicate an LB IIB date, as these features generally do not predate this period. The decreased number of Cypriot imports is typical in 133</page><page sequence="143">CHAPTER TWO general of the 13th century, when the amount of imports declines;95 their presence indicates that this occupation could have continued only until the latest date assigned to the such imports, most likely no later than the first quarter of the 12th century. The "Late" style of two of our White Slip hemispherical bowls is usually considered a late 13th-century trait (Chapter III). The imitation Base Ring jug and bowl are typical of the 13th century, such imitations lasting until the very end of LB IIB. The lack of cyma-shaped bowls (BL 59) might be viewed as a chronological indicator, suggesting that our Str. VI ended before these bowls became popular in the second half of the 13th century in the south. However, from the many other ceramic types typical of this period that are present it seems that Tel Batash was indeed inhabited at this time; cases in which pottery types are not uniformly present in contemporary strata at adjacent sites are well known (Faust and Bunimovitz 200 1 ). The absence of the carinated bowl in Str. VI is also a chronological indicator, since it has been shown that this bowl is absent from most 13th-century assemblages throughout the country. The many differences between Str. VII and VI suggest that there was a gap between the two. There is also a difference between Str. VIB and VIA that is expressed not only by floor raisings or layers in open areas, but by substantial architectural changes; a thin (partial?) destruction layer separates them as well. The fact that the building of Str. VIA continued to be used in Str. V implies that the time that elapsed between these two occupations was not too long. We may perhaps suggest that Str. VIB represents the terminal phase of the LB, to be dated to the second half of the 13th century, while Str. VIA should be related to the transitional period between LB and Iron I, the first quarter of the 12th century (denoted Iron I A in NEAEHL : 1529 and Mazar 1990: 30). If such a scenario is valid, we suggest the correlation of occupation horizons and material culture assemblages given in Table 39. As mentioned above, most of the imports were found in the debris above the Str. VII destruction layer or in Str. VIB; the three sherds found in the Str. VIA Building 442 may be residual. Thus, Str. VIA represents a phase that is pre-Philistine and post-import. At Gezer the destruction that separated the terminal LB phase from the transitional LB-Iron I was attributed to the campaign of Merneptah (Dever 1993: 504). Of course, it is not certain whether this was the cause of any of the other destructions in our region and other factors might be involved. The occupation at a number of sites in the Shephelah during the 19th Dynasty shows a decline; this is interesting in light of the renaissance that is assumed to have occurred in Canaan during this time as a result of the intensified Egyptian involvement by the pharoahs of this dynasty, with reinforced garrison towns and directly appointed officials (Weinstein 1981; Leonard 1989; Redford 1992: 206-207). This "stranglehold" and higher taxes imposed at this time, as well as the weakening of the city-state system in face of tightened Egyptian control, may have played a role in the economic depletion that we see in Str. VIB, with its sparser occupation and ultimate destruction. This picture is at best sketchy and the limited material remains and poor preservation ultimately make it difficult to be decisive in our conclusions. IRON AGE I Str.

The remains include one main building phase, with a number of sub-phases identified mostly in open areas, which contained many pits and silos. This stratum was identified in a number of excavation areas (B, C, D, E and J), unlike the MB and LB strata, which were exposed mainly in Area B. The remains included segments of substantial buildings built of distinctive yellowish mud-bricks. The only stone house is Building 313 in Area B, which was in fact a re-use of a building first constructed in Str. VIA. Other remains include the citadel (?), fortification wall and tower in Area C. The stratigraphy is presented in Timnah /: 27-28 (Area A); 76-81 (Area B); 93-94 (Area J); 98-105 (Area C); 177-180 (Areas D and E); 254 (summary). The following is a summary of the pottery assemblage recovered from these locales and our chronological and regional assessment. There is a wider typological diversity in this stratum than in any of the earlier ones. The open rounded bowls include 9% of the type with the thickened inner rim that was the most common in LB (BL 53), as well as 15% of the small deep hemispherical bowl (BL 50c); some of the latter are very small, with thickened inner rims and red bands on the rim. BL 51, a shallow open rounded bowl with red concentric circles inside, comprised 2% of the bowls. Several bowls have bar handles (PI. 83:2), knobs (PL 67:9) or vertical "pinch" handles (PI. 75:12). The carinated bowl returns in Str. V, following a hiatus in Str. VI, but now includes two types: a shallow open bowl with a soft carination (BL 58), often decorated inside with red concentric circles, and the cyma-shaped profile (BL 59); these are often decorated inside with red concentric circles, as well as three with paneled zigzags and tree. Some of the cyma-shaped bowls have horizontal handles. Together, these carinated bowls comprise 27% of the bowls. Another bowl type is the bell-shaped Philistine bowl (BL 8), the most common bowl type in Str. V (30%). Two more Philistine-related types, small carinated bowl with loop handles (BL 61) and rounded bowl with thickened rim (BL 42), together constitute no more than 2% of the bowls. Chalices are more common in Str. V than in any other stratum and most have everted rims (CH 4), with or without a ridged foot; one is white- slipped. One goblet (GB 2) of an earlier type was found as well. The kraters are of two main types: the typical Canaanite carinated krater (KR 1) continues, though with a somewhat more vertical neck (14% of all kraters). The most common krater is the Philistine Bichrome bell krater (KR 2), which comprises 69% of the kraters. Several other types (KR 7 with a spout, KR 9 with everted rim, KR 15, the large "barrel" krater) together do not exceed 6% of the kraters. Most of the bowl and krater bases are ring bases, though concave disc bases are found as well. Very few bowls are red-slipped and none are burnished. The cooking pots are mainly of the type with open carinated body and vertical rim (CP 4a-c, 68%) and 1 1 % of the cooking pots are the typical LB type with everted rim (CP 1). Several jugs (JG 30) might be classified as the Aegean-style cooking jugs that are found in Philistia at this time. Cooking pots with concave inner rims (CP 15) comprise 20% of the cooking pots; this is a very common type in the subsequent Iron HA Str. IV. One baking tray was found as well. Storage jars are all of the straight-necked type, with slightly thickened rim (SJ 3, 28%) or plain rim (SJ 21, 21d; 57%); storage jar bases are tapering, narrow and flattened. Two examples of S J 2 Id are painted with red concentric lines. Note a storage jar handle incised with what looks like the Proto-Canaanite letter kaf (PI. 69:15). Three rims of what might be "collared-rim" pithoi, a very rare type at Tel Batash, were found. The jugs are dominated by the Philistine jug with Bichrome decoration (JG 6), which constitutes 60% of all jugs. Other jug types are rare and include one example of a plain round-bodied jug (JG 7) and a jug with one loop handle and a short neck (JG 30, 8%; as mentioned above, several of these may have been cooking jugs of the Aegean type). Several vessels classified as "closed vessels" (CV 1-3) may have been jugs as well. One sherd with a squat biconical profile (PI. 63: 10) was found. Only two fragments of stirrup jars were found (only one is shown in the plates). Juglets are all short-bodied with rounded bases; no rims are preserved. Three amphoriskoi of differing types (AM 1,1a, 2) were found, two small and one medium-sized with burnish and red bands. Seven examples of "feeding bottles" (BT5) were found; these are considered part of the Philistine repertoire. Str. V contained a number of flasks, mostly small with narrow necks, decorated with red concentric circles (FL 1); an example of a "spoon flask" (FL 3) was found too. Lamps are all of the everted-rim type (LP 2) and one fragment of a cup-and-saucer was found as well. This summary of the Str. V ceramic assemblage demonstrates its great diversity, including open and closed vessels of various traditions (Amiran 1969: 192). The vessels are all wheel-made, as indicated by rather prominent wheel marks on both open and closed vessels. Since no cooking pot bodies were preserved, we cannot comment on their manufacturing technique. The vessels all appear to be hard-fired and sometimes reach a metallic 135</page><page sequence="145">CHAPTER TWO consistency. Less calcification was noted than in the LB pottery and in general there were few visible inclusions on the surface of the undecorated vessels. No distortion of vessels was noted and most were symmetrical; bases were well formed and proportionally suited to the vessel. The fabrics used in Str. V mainly (90%) derive from the loess with fine quartz sand clay source (FG LI, L2, L3, K); these were generally well-levigated clays of pinkish or light reddish color (and rarely buff-white) with a "sandy" texture. Only 10% were made of a fabric that was identified as deriving from marl of the Taqiye Formation (FG I). The predominance of the loess clay group in Iron I, as opposed to the frequency of the marl group in the LB, is discussed in Chapter II.2. Thus, Str. V represents a technological shift in the clay source of pottery as opposed to all previous occupation levels; this shift already began in Str. VI. Pl. 83:16, a cyma-shaped bowl (BL 59), was the only vessel made of terra rossa clay; this clay type becomes dominant in Iron II. For the most part, the Philistine and Canaanite shapes in Str. V were both made of the same fabric groups, showing that there was no specialization of fabric by type at this time. The interaction between the two ceramic traditions is notable not only in technology (e.g. fabric) but also in shape (e.g. horizontal handles on cyma-shaped bowls, the similarity of some Philistine and Canaanite kraters) and decoration (e.g. white slip on bowls and chalices). Various Canaanite shapes decorated in Philistine Bichrome, such as the flat bowl with bar handles, loop- handled jug and round goblet (Dothan 1982: 185-191; Qasile II : 100-101) demonstrate this interaction as well. In light of the pÃ©trographie results, the origin of the clay from which both Philistine and Canaanite vessels at Tel Batash were made should be sought west and south of the site; this would include the immediate vicinity of our site as well as the entire southern coastal plain. If the pottery was not locally made, Tel Miqne and Ashdod are two sites that are candidates for the production of our Str. V pottery, though the latter is less likely in view of the carbonatic inclusions in the fabric (see Chapter II.2). Based on petrography and typology, it seems that Tel Miqne is a likely candidate for the origin of much of our pottery at this time. The homogeneity of the Philistine shapes and decoration seem to suggest concentrated production in several central locations, probably in Philistine centers rather than in peripheral sites such as Tel Batash. The question of whether the Canaanite shapes derive from the same production venue(s) remains open, though this is a distinct possibility in view of the shared technology. The Philistine component in our assemblage (bell- shaped bowls and kraters, jugs, feeding bottles and stirrup jars) comprises as much as 34%. This figure derives from the following count: BL 8: 1 10; KR 2:112; JG 6: 81 ; BT 5: 7; stirrup jar: 2; JG 30: 8 (if indeed the latter represents the Aegean-style cooking jug); two other types (BL 42 and BL 61) are marginal in the Philistine corpus. Altogether this comes to 320 out of the total count of 938 sherds and vessels in Str. V, i.e. about a third. It is interesting to note that the distribution of these numbers over the excavated strata shows a correlation with the area exposed in each. This implies that the ratio of Philistine to Canaanite pottery is not confined to an "elite zone" or some other specialized locale, but is most likely the regular state of affairs at our site. This high percentage, on the one hand, is comparable to sites within Philistia proper, such as Ashdod (ca. 27%; Brug 1985: 67-68), Tel Miqne (16-30% in most contexts and over 50% in the industrial area; Gilboa et al. 2006) and Tell Qasile (24% in Str. XII and 14% each in Str. XI-X; Qasile II : 105, Table 11). On the other hand, our figure contrasts with other sites on the Philistine periphery, such as Gezer (5%; Gezer II : 54, note 34, where it is noted that this figure is only an "estimate"), Beth-Shemesh (4.6%; S. Bunimovitz and Z. Lederman, personal communication), and Aphek (3%; Gadot 2003). Thus, even if we take into account contingencies of context whereby a high percentage of Philistine ware may be more representative of excavation in an elite or specialized zone than of the general state of affairs, it is clear that sites within Philistia have a particularly substantial representation of Philistine Bichrome types. Tel Batash belongs to the sphere of sites that have been identified as containing a large ethnic Philistine entity in the so-called "second stage" of Philistine presence, following the initial immigration of the Sea Peoples. Two main scenarios for such sites have been suggested: that such vessels represent the actual presence of Philistines (Keim and Mazar 1995: 102-103; Stager 1995; Killebrew 2000), or alternatively that these vessels were simply luxury tableware used by Canaanite locals in lieu of the now unobtainable Aegean or Cypriot imports (Bunimovitz 1990; Gilboa et al. 2006). An additional viewpoint that has been put forward is that this ware was the product of Canaanite potters who wished to compete with the work of immigrant potters who produced the Mycenaean UIC: 1 wares (Gilboa et al. 2006). This, however, is an attempt to explain if and why Philistine Bichrome ware replaced Canaanite wares rather than 136</page><page sequence="146">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V an explanation of what the Bichrome ware represents when and where it is found. It seems that at Batash the hypothesis of Philistine presence is preferable in light of the substantial representation of Philistine pottery in the assemblage, along with many other items of Philistine affiliation in the material culture assemblage of Str. V, such as bullae, a pyramidal stamp seal, and a figurine (see Chapters VIII, X). Note also the possible presence of cooking pots of the Aegean style. Such components are widely believed to be material correlates of ethnic presence, as they reflect lifestyles and not just possible trade items (Bunimovitz and Yassur-Landau 1996; Killebrew 1999, 2000). While Canaanites certainly sought the attractive Philistine Bichrome ware, it may be concluded that the large amount of such vessels found at our site points to their being functional, as much as aesthetically pleasing and/or ethnically symbolic. The Philistines and their descendents, who most likely intermarried with local Canaanites (see, for instance, the Biblical Samson narrative), appreciated these vessels on all levels: functional, symbolic and aesthetic. Undoubtedly, this interaction found expression in the typologically and technologically hybrid characteristics noted in much of the Str. V ceramics, detailed above. The implication of the above is that Tel Batash marks an ethnic (and political?) border, to the east and north of which there is a sharp falloff in the presence of material correlates of substantial Philistine occupation. Tel Batash, Biblical Timnah, is the easternmost "Philistine" site; Beth-Shemesh Str. III represents a different social, ethnic and political entity and the same can be said of Gezer. The use of pottery and other material culture objects as markers of social boundaries, either by encouraging distribution or deliberate prevention of their diffusion, is widely discussed (i.e. Stark 1999; Bunimovitz and Faust 2001). Assuming that the production of Philistine Bichrome ware was relatively concentrated (see Chapter II. 2), it seems that there was indeed a choice on the part of producers, distributors and, of course, consumers to make, disseminate and purchase these wares for both practical and symbolic reasons. The pÃ©trographie and typological data from Tel Batash point to the likelihood that much of the Philistine Bichrome pottery was brought from Tel Miqne, and in light of the common fabric shared with many of the Canaanite types, it is possible that these too were exchanged from that locale. Of course, it is possible that other production and distribution venues (such as Gath-Tel Safit) were active, and that some vessels were produced at Tel Batash itself. Thus, it seems that alongside a basically centralized mode of production, there was a modicum of variety of production levels, particularly for some Canaanite types. The data above reveal a ceramic assemblage with two clear components: local Canaanite and Philistine Bichrome. The former both continues the LB tradition and introduces new elements, such as the vertical cooking pot rim and a new clay source. A factor to consider when determining the chronology of Str. V is the total lack of locally produced Mycenaean UIC pottery at our site. Our Str. V corresponds to phases that include Philistine Bichrome and postdate the local Mycenaean UIC phase, such as Tel Miqne Str. Vla-V and Ashdod Str. XII-XI; this phase corresponds mainly to Tell Qasile Str. XII-XI and, to some extent, to Str. X. The appearance of Philistine Bichrome postdates the Egyptian domination of Canaan and continues throughout the 11th century ( Qasile IL 104; Mazar 1985; Singer 1985; Stager 1995: 335). It seems that our Str. V began shortly after the termination of Str. VIA, in light of the relative continuity in both ceramic types and fabric groups noted between the two and especially considering the re-use of the Str. VIA Building 442 in Str. V. The question of the end of Str. V remains open; several elements seem to indicate that the end of this stratum came at some time in the late 11th century, though possibly not at its very end. Chronological indicators among the Canaanite pottery types are certain LB types that appear only in the early part of Iron I but totally disappear by the end of the 11th century, such as the LB -type cooking pot and open bowls with thickened inner rims. The virtual disappearance of the LB biconical profile apparently took place in the early part of Iron I. The few cooking pots with handles point to the late 11th century, when this feature began to appear sporadically, becoming common only in Iron IIA. Another factor to be borne in mind is the amount of red slip and especially hand burnish in Str. V. These traits are minimal; red slip generally appears, if at all, without burnish, and hand-burnished vessels come mainly from mixed Str. V-IV contexts.96 Comparison to the pottery of Tel Miqne-Ekron shows that our Str. V has the closest affinity to Miqne Str. V in both pottery shapes and decoration; for example, small hemispherical bowls with thickened inner rims, cyma- shaped bowls with red concentric circles, degraded bell-shaped bowls with vestigial horizontal handles, and other types as well.97 The end of Miqne Str. V is dated to the late 1 1th century, since the subsequent Str. IV appears to have already begun at the end of the 1 1th 137</page><page sequence="147">CHAPTER TWO century. We must note as well that the subsequent Iron HA Str. IV at Tel Batash is dated to the 10th century; the ceramics of this stratum, and especially of its earlier phase IVB, still contain some elements related to Iron I and we assume chronological proximity between the two ( Timnah IL 154-156). Thus, Str. V most likely terminated at some time in the last quarter of the 11th century, followed possibly by a very short gap and then resettlement in Iron IIA, beginning with Str. IVB. The assemblage of Str. V is much more regional than that of any of the previous strata, demonstrating a high degree of similarity to sites within Philistia and its environs. Close comparison may be made to Tel Miqne Str. VI?- V, Tel Harassim, Beth-Shemesh Str. III; Gezer Str. XII-XI, Ashdod Str. XII-XI, Teli Qasile Str. XII-XI (and X?), Tell Beit Mirsim Str. B2, Aphek Str. X10-X9, Tel Sera' Str. VIII, Tel Sippor Str. III and the Tell 'Eitun "Philistine" tomb. These comparisons are valid for both the Philistine and the Canaanite types. Certain types may be also be found in northern locations in Iron I contexts, such as the cyma-shaped bowl and the vertical-rim cooking pot (e.g. Hazor Str. XII, Megiddo Str. VIIA-VI and Tell Keisan Str. 9c); however, many types, such as the small deep hemispherical bowl, the small amphora, and the plain-rim storage jar, are more typical of southern sites. The material culture of Str. V represents the meeting of the Philistine and Canaanite traditions that was typical of the Shephelah in the late 12th and 11th centuries. Iron I is considered a period in which decorated pottery is abundant, a trend reflecting both the continuation of the painted Canaanite LB mode (especially in the northern valleys) and the newly introduced Philistine wares (both Monochrome and Bichrome). The use of red slip becomes increasingly more common during this period, apparently related to the introduction of Phoenician wares in its latter part. However, the pottery of our Str. V is generally undecorated, with the exception of Philistine Bichrome ware and the red concentric circles inside bowls of various types that we consider a derivative of this tradition. There is virtually no evidence of the continuation of Canaanite painted motifs at our site. This appears to be a regional factor; it should be noted that even during the LB, the amount of local painted pottery at Tel Batash was relatively small, being largely confined to biconical vessels and some storage jars. Thus we are witnessing not a sharp break with a previous pottery tradition, but rather the incorporation of the site within the framework of decoration common in this region during Iron I. The Philistine Bichrome decoration in our assemblage shares its quality and motifs with other Philistine sites and, though we may speculate whether the vessels were imported from a major production center like Tel Miqne or whether local artists became adept at producing this ware, the consistently high level of design among the Philistine Bichrome vessels is notable. 138</page><page sequence="148">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V NOTES 1 The pÃ©trographie method is based on the examination of thin sections (30 microns thick) under the pÃ©trographie (polarizing) microscope; for more details see Whitbread 1995; Vaughan 1999. 2 Unpublished kiln excavated by Daniel Verga, IAA excavation license A2954/1998. 3 Unpublished, most likely MB kiln excavated by Angelina Degot, IAA excavation license A3260. 4 Unpublished MB kiln excavated by Parnos Giora, IAA excavation license A364 1/2002. 5 PÃ©trographie study (unpublished) of the pottery from H. Zafit, Yesodot and Tel Malot was conducted by the author. 6 For example, while it is clear that the Moza- ' Amminadav clay includes deliberately added 'Amminadav sand as temper and crushed calcite is added to cooking pot clay as temper, it is not clear whether the fine quartz sand found in the loess fabric was naturally deposited or deliberately added. Temper is defined according to the role it plays in the production and use of the ceramics and not merely as an artificial additive (A. Cohen- Weinberger, personal communication). 7 Since the four pÃ©trographie groups can be "streamlined" into two main groups, A 1-2 (marl of the Taqiye Formation) and Bl-2 (loess), the actual ratio is even higher, with about seven visually determined fabric groups to one pÃ©trographie group. It may be noted that in our study of the Iron Age II fabrics at Tel Batash, the ratio of fabric groups to pÃ©trographie groups was six pÃ©trographie groups to 31 fabric groups, ca. 1:5 (Jimnah /: 21, Table la). 8 Though Table 4 shows that FG LI and L3 (the most common Iron I fabrics) first appear in Str. VI as well, these are in miniscule numbers and might be intrusive sherds. 9 These fabric groups all belong to the pÃ©trographie group of loess with fine quartz and it was stressed that this is a major departure from the situation in the Bronze Age, when the fabric groups mainly belonged to the pÃ©trographie group deriving from marl of the Taqiye Formation. However, it must be noted that this is not an absolute distinction and vessels made of loess were found in LB levels, while vessels made of marl of the Taqiye Formation, including several typically Philistine vessels such as bell-shaped bowls, were found in the Iron I Str. V (see Tables 6-7). Notably, the macroscopic examination could not discern between some of the bowls made of loess and those made of marl of the Taqiye Formation with much fine quartz sand (similar to FG A); only the pÃ©trographie examination was able to do this (see also our comments on this subject, p. 136). However, we surmise that the overall dominance of the loess group is the main characteristic of Str. V, in light of the visual difference between this group and most of the other fabric groups belonging to the pÃ©trographie group deriving from marl of the Taqiye Formation. 10 Note that this group was not denoted hamra in Timnah /: 21, Table la, but simply termed "calcite, quartz sand". This was the dominant fabric used during Iron II at Tel Batash, particularly in Str. III-II of the 8th-7th centuries (Timnah /: 24). 11 Some of the molded rim shapes included by Maeir in his MB II bowl types are similar to the thickened inner rim of our BL 53, which is a key LB type. This emphasizes the interaction between these types, both of which first appear in MB II, as well as the subjectivity of typological divisions, which often result from the traits of a specific assemblage as well as the individual view of the analyst. 12 Though Mullins (2002: 280) considers knife paring or scraping of the lower exterior of bowls to be Egyptian formation techniques, it seems that in our case this method should be considered a local finishing technique, since virtually no Egyptian affinities are present in the pottery assemblage at our site. 13 Mullins (2002: 188) claims that bowls with a thickened rim interior become less frequent as the LB progresses and disappear before the end of the period. The data from Tel Batash, and selected parallels presented here, appear to refute this claim in our region. Killebrew (1998b: 82) notes that bowls of this type were not found at all in Beth-Shean Str. VII-VI due to the "strong Egyptian presence". 14 Two more bowls have been published from Miqne Str. IX (Killebrew 1996: Ills. 4:7, 5:3); it is possible that this stratum continued into the 13th century (A. Zukerman, personal communication). 15 All the references in this text to unpublished Iron I types at Tel Miqne were kindly provided by A. Zukerman. 16 Yannai (1996) presents assemblages from tombs dated to the late 13th and early 12th centuries (e.g. Tombs 559, 561, 570; see Lachish IV: 246-249). The few smaller and deeper profiles that seem similar to our BL 50c and are included in these groups are in fact re-used drawings of bowls that also appear in Lachish Fosse Temples II and III (e.g. Lachish //: 48, 137, 143). Tufnell simply referred back to these vessels in her description of the tombs' contents, and it is thus difficult to know if these are the exact profiles of the vessels actually found in these tombs. This supports our contention that these profiles existed prior to Iron I but became more dominant at this time. 17 The use of red alone was considered a later LB II development at Megiddo as well, replacing the red and black bichrome that was typical of the earlier LB (Megiddo Tombs : 156). 18 We use this term to designate the locally produced Mycenaean UIC pottery of the first phase of Philistine 139</page><page sequence="149">CHAPTER TWO settlement in Philistia; Dothan and Zukerman (2004) use the term: "Mycenaean HIC: 1 /Philistine Monochrome". 19 Several open shallow bowls with similar red concentric lines inside, including spirals on the inner base, were found in northern contexts, such as Str. VI at Megiddo ( Megiddo II : Pis. 74:4; 78:6-7; 84:16; Megiddo III : Fig. 11.2:3, Str. F-5=VIA). Str. VI at Megiddo included a substantial amount of Philistine and Philistine-inspired ware, and these bowls are possibly related to this phenomenon as well. However, the significance of this is unclear and it is difficult to know if there is any affinity between this northern expression of such a decoration to ours in BL 5 1 and 58 (or BL 59). 20 Ca. 65% of the carinated bowls counted with this type were rim and body sherds that did not permit definition of the carination's placement (see also Zuckerman 2003: 128 for a similar situation at Hazor). This was another factor in our decision not to use carination placement as a quantitative typological criterion. 21 Contra Zuckerman (2003: 127-128), who viewed the placement of the carination as a chronological indicator at Hazor. 22 Some of the bowls that we include in our regular BL 56 (e.g. Pis. 21:5; 37:5) are comparable to bowls categorized by Zuckerman (2003: 131 ff.) as having a degenerate carination. Apparently her classification also pertains to other features of this bowl type, such as smaller size and coarser fabric. Such a definition does not suit our bowls, though they may have a less emphatic carination. It seems that this definition is complex and variable at other sites. 23 These data contradict Amiran's claim that the carinated bowl was the most common type of bowl in LB Canaan (Amiran 1969: 124); see Mullins 2002: 193 for a similar conclusion. 24 Yannai (1996: 225) uses these two bowls as the basis for the claim that this type of carinated bowl does continue into the late 13th and early 12th centuries. He assumes that such bowls were found at Hazor but simply "were not published, since they were considered by the excavators to have belonged to Str. IA". However, the parallel he cites from Tel Keisan Str. 11-10 ( Keisan : PI. 81:15) is the rim of a shallow cyma-shaped bowl, not a carinated LB-type bowl. 25 Tufnell ( Lachish IV : 182-183) suggests that such bowls might have had a "therapeutic value" of some kind, based on ethnographic analogies to metal bowls in modern times. 26 The term "S-shaped" is used in different contexts to describe profiles other than our BL 59; an example such as Yannai 1996: 101, pertaining to shallow open bowls without an everted rim that have a soft round carination just above mid-body (somewhat similar to our BL 58). Thus, careful examination of the illustrations (and vessels) is needed when establishing parallels to these bowls. 27 Such bowls were found with loop handles as well, though not at our site, e.g. Gezer //-///: Fig. 1:15, Str. XII; Gezer IV : Pis. 18:1; 36:16; Tel Harassim: Givon 1994: Fig. 15:8, red-slipped and painted; Tell Beit Mirsim: Greenberg 1987: Figs. 6:20; 8:13, Str. B; Tel Miqne Str. VI-IV (A. Zuckerman, personal communication). 28 No examples have yet been published from Ashdod Str. Xllla. Note that though a substantial amount of medium-sized to large cyma-shaped bowls, most with red concentric circles inside, are published (see selected parallels), in one place in the text they are considered rare ( Ashdod V: 87), though other references in the text do not mention this. 29 Though this is beyond the scope of our discussion, intensive study being presently conducted on Mycenaean UIC: 1 ware at Tel Miqne has shown the complexity of the subject (L. Mazow and A. Zuckerman, personal communication). Though the basic definition of a light buff-colored, well-levigated and high-fired fabric is indeed valid, it should be noted that there is a variety of other fabrics from which this group was made in Str. VII, while on the other hand this type of fabric was also found to continue into Str. VI and V, the Philistine Bichrome phase at Tel Miqne, on a range of vessels. 30 Killebrew's in-depth discussion of the various pottery traditions that coexisted in Iron I focuses on the diversity of the industries and the divisive ethnic implications (Killebrew 1998b: 271-277). The phenomenon that we note at our site of a considerable degree of interaction (stylistic and technological) between the ceramic traditions is worthy of further study. See also Dothan and Zuckerman 2004: 41-42 for a discussion of this interaction during the Mycenaean UIC: 1 /Philistine Monochrome phase. 3 1 Close examination shows that most of the examples provided in Qasile II: 41, n. 32 as parallels for the continuation of the Iron I shaped bowl into Iron II are much more similar to these sharp and low carinated bowls, which indeed become a prevalent type at this time (see BL 27 in Timnah II : 41-42). 32 Our definition of this motif inside S-shaped bowls includes all variations of the tripartite and quadripartite division, with paneled zigzags and/or schematic palm trees (e.g. Gezer IV: Pis. 30:4; 36:1-2; Ashdod VI: PI. 111.4:12). 33 Note also the presence of this motif inside bowls that are fragmentary and thus could theoretically be other than cyma-shaped (e.g. Megiddo III: Fig. 10.3:12, Str. VI; Qasile II: 44^5, Photo 42, Str. XII; Gezer IV: PI. 32:12, Str. XIII; Tel Sippor: Yannai 2000a: Fig. 2: 14, Str. IV; Tel Yarmouth: Jasmin 1999: Pis. 78:19; 91:17). 34 A cyma-shaped bowl with thin red concentric lines was found at Tel Yoqne'am in a late Iron I context (Zarzecki- Peleg 1997: PI. 1:9). See also a bowl from Megiddo Str. VI ( Megiddo II: PI. 84:17) and several bowls from Tel Keisan Str. 9c (e.g. Keisan: PI. 79:4, 11). See also n. 19 140</page><page sequence="150">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V above for this decoration in bowls similar to our BL 5 1 and BL 58 in northern contexts. 35 Note a similar decoration inside a unique rounded bowl with three large loops as a base (Macalister 1912: PI. LXXXII: 1, Tomb 58). 36 Note, however, a small sherd of a bowl from Beth- Shemesh Str. III, possibly shaped like our BL 58, which has red horizontal lines and vertical black lines inside ( Ain Shems IV : PI. XXXVIII: 1 1). A cyma-shaped bowl with a sharp carination from Tell Keisan Str. 9c bears Philistine Bichrome decoration inside as well as red hatches on the rim ( Keisan : PI. 80: 11). 37 For clarification of the localized sub-phases of Str. V, see Timnah I: 79-80. 38 Despite the contention that the red monochrome and undecorated bowls belong to a "pre-bichrome" phase and are earlier than the "true Philistine Bichrome" examples ( Gezer IV : 80, n. 136), our evidence shows that undecorated and red monochrome bowls are contemporary with those painted both in monochrome black and in bichrome (Table 19). All belong to the Philistine Bichrome phase. 39 Note a bell-shaped bowl sherd from Aphek Str. X10 that has red slip and black spirals outside (Gadot 2003: PI. V.47:10), similar to the bowls found in Qasile Str. XI-X ( Qasile II : Figs. 29: 14-15; 34:9). 40 Yannai ( 1 996: 92, n. 20) notes a similar situation in Lachish Str. VI, in which this type of krater is the only one found, and surmises that there must have been other krater types that simply were not found since the findspot was a storehouse or public building, where kraters were most likely rare. However, the data on KR 1 at Batash, found in domestic settings and still a single krater type, demonstrates that such a situation is indeed a valid one. 41 Notably, the main krater type found in Str. IV at Tel Batash continues the tradition of KR 1 into the 10th century, often covered with red slip and irregular hand burnish (KR 14, Timnah II: 62-64). 42 This krater type does not appear in the typological sequence established by Tufnell in Lachish IV , aside from a possibly related shape included with her "CarÃ­nate Bowls, Class F' {Lachish IV: PI. 69:578) 43 Note that some of the sherds appear at a scale of 1 :5 and others at 1 :2; this is marked on the plates. 44 Killebrew ( 1 998b: 1 76) divided this krater into two major classes based on rim shapes that are different than ours: a flattened everted rim and a simple everted rim. Both these are included in our KR 2a. Killebrew does not mention a hammerhead rim, like that of our KR 2b. 45 This type of vertical band handle appears on several similar kraters in Str. V at Tel Batash that do not appear in the plates. Note a similar handle on ajar from Ashdod Str. XII (Ashdod V: Fig. 34:6); a krater from Gezer Str. XI (Gezer IV: PI. 37:21); and a large bowl from Tel Masos, Str. II (Masos II: PI. 147: 15). A cooking pot from Deir el Balah also has such "handles" (Killebrew 1998b: 111. III.8: 3, Iron I). 46 Such cooking pots were very common in MB IIA levels at Tell el-Dab 'a, though most were made of local Egyptian clay; some of these were white slipped or had a red band on their rim (Aston 2002: 46-47). 47 Note suggestions that large capacity cooking pots figured in the act of feasting on some level, either ceremonial or solidarity, such as with clans or feeding recruited workers (Hayden 2001). 48 Killebrew ( 1 999: 92) states that the short triangular rim is a regional variation; however, since she cites parallels from Tell el-Ful, Tell Qasile and Tel Batash, it is not clear which region is intended. 49 For example, Ben- Ami (200 1 : 1 60-1 6 1 ) used the elongated cooking pot rims as one of his criteria for dating the Str. XII pits at Hazor to a later part of the Iron I sequence, but also considered the lack of everted cooking pot rims, a definitely early 12th century feature. 50 The possibility was raised by A. Zukerman that the Str. V examples of our JG 30 (Pis. 69:5, 70:15, 79:11) might belong to such Aegean-style cooking pots, though not made of typical cooking pot fabric. 51 One cited example of Qasile Cooking Potiype 2 is a closed- necked two-handled pot that is very different from the other examples (Qasile II: Fig. 26:11). Dothan and Zukerman (2004) suggest that it should be related to the closed Aegean-style cooking jugs rather than the open Canaanite cooking pots. 52 This jar was found with a handleless pithos (PI. 12:1) in Locus 720 (Timnah II: 42). A fifth jar (made of pinkish fabric with whitish bands) was found in an unstratified context in Area D and is not published. 53 Since Maeir's MB II typology is based on rims, it was impractical to compare his types to our SJ 1 on a type- by-type basis. Basically, our S J 1 (with all its variations) parallels various examples included in his SJlc, 2a, 2b, 2d, 3c and especially 3e (Maeir 1997: Pis. 18-22). 54 Raban (2001: 12*) notes that some jars exceed the standard capacity by up to 20%. He discusses the great skill required for the potter to produce vessels of similar shape and standard capacity and suggests that the "royal" cubit (52-53 cm) was employed when planning the height and width of the storage jar. If indeed this was so, it would imply not only a common technology and "blueprint" used by all the workshops producing these jars, but also a deliberate production scheme with economic and official (?) dictates in mind. 55 Note a similar conclusion concerning the role of the pithos (Killebrew 2001: 390-391). 56 Mullins (2002: 236) suggests that jars like our SJ 2 begin earlier in the south than the north, being well known in LB IB at sites like Gezer (Cave 1.1 OA) and Lachish (Fosse 141</page><page sequence="151">CHAPTER TWO Temple I). However, though he claims that the jar first appears in the north in LB IIA, he provides parallels from Megiddo Str. IX, as well as an LB IA context from Ugarit; the storage jar from Beth-Shean itself (Mullins 2002: PI. 54:2) originates from "below Str. IX". The appearance of S J 2 in Str. IX at Tel Batash indicates that it was already common in LB I. 57 Amiran's division into "commercial" and "domestic" Canaanite storage jars (Amiran 1969: 140-143) should perhaps be reviewed, since the variation may be due to regional (and chronological?) rather than functional factors. 58 Note the suggestion that finishing a rim by folding it over rather than cutting it with a sharp point is more suitable to a grittier clay with coarser temper (Kalsbeek 1969: 81). This might be a technological explanation for the more frequent occurrence of thickened rims in the LB as opposed to the MB, as the clay is indeed generally less plastic. Another interpretation sees the thickened rim as a reinforcing element (Artzy 1997: 10, n. 10). Whatever the technological origin, it probably evolved into a stylistic feature that became an integral part of the formation of the Canaanite storage jar. 59 Other designations for this jar type include Mullins SJ 2 (Mullins 2002: 236-237), Killebrew CA 21a (Killebrew 1998b: 110-112) and Qashish SJ VII ( Qashish : 291- 292). 60 No such storage jars, apart from some bases and handles (e.g. TBM la: PL 17:1, 3) are published from Str. C at Tell Beit Mirsim. It is not clear whether this results from the poor publication of the material in general or the fragmentary nature of the finds in Str. C. 61 Examples include Gezer IV: 83, Pis. 27:1-2; 30:3 (Str. XIII); Lachish IV: PL 87:1020 (Tomb 542, late LB IIB); Lachish V: PL 40:12; Ashdod /-//: Figs. 82:9; 83:1-2 (Str. XIII); ' IzbetSartah : Fig. 9:2 (Str. III); Qasilell: Fig. 26:14 (Str. XII/XI); Tell el-Far'ah ( S): Beth-Pelet II: PL LXXXV:43P6 (Cemetery 900); the Tell 'Eitun "Philistine" tomb (Edelstein and Aurant 1992: Fig. 10:1); Yarmouth (Jasmin 1999: PL 92). 62 A small storage jar that is decorated on most of its body comes from Tell el-Far'ah (S) and is dated to the time of the 19th Dynasty ( CPP : Pl. 43: L3, Tomb 834). Another such jar comes from Megiddo Str. Vllb ( Megiddo II: PL 64:4). Though the latter has a similar central panel scene, both it and the jar from Tell el-Far' ah (S) differ in composition and date from our PL 3 1 : 1 . 63 Note a jar painted in red with a Canaanite design among the amphorae on the Uluburun ship (unpublished, in the Bodrum Museum). 64 Tufnell notes that there was an upper part of a jar with a "more elaborate" decoration from the Str. VI destruction, but provides no further details (Lachish IV: 224). 65 Several painted sherds appearing in Macalister's publications (e.g. Macalister 1912c: Pis. CLX:8; CLXV:l-2, 5) may belong to such jars, but the fragmentary nature of the material precludes a definite conclusion. 66 Note one shoulder sherd painted in red with the vertical straight and wavy lines of a metope; it is defined as a jug but could have belonged to a storage jar like our S J 2c (Ashdod II-III: Fig. 34:7, Str. XVII). 67 The type number follows that used for this jar in its Iron II manifestation, when it was divided into subtypes a-c (Timnah II: 92). This subdivision is not maintained for the Iron I examples, since most of the rims have the vertical stance of SJ 21b. However, we have added an additional Iron I subtype, S J 2 Id, to this series. 68 Painting in red alone has been considered a southern Canaanite tradition at Gezer ( Gezer IV: 57, n. 100), beginning in the 13th century and continuing into Iron I. However, for Megiddo it was noted that red monochrome decoration was already dominant in LB IIB ( Megiddo Tombs: 156). At Beth-Shean as well, the painted jars in Levels VII and VI are mainly painted in red. Thus, it seems that red monochrome is a chronological rather than a regional feature, typical of the late LB II and Iron I. 69 Note, however, that Tufnell considered this type (Storage Jar Class A, Type 1006) as probably predating the end of the MB (Lachish IV: 221). Note that a handleless pithos of this type from Lachish had painted white striped bands like our S J 5. 70 Juglets shaped like our JG 1 are found at Hazor as well (e.g. Hazor II: Pl. CXXXIL4-7, LB II. 71 Note, however, the parallel from Lachish, which is somewhat different in its handle shape (Lachish II: PL LI:286). Two examples of such a jug are cited, one from Fosse Temple III itself and one from a nearby pit (199). The example from the temple postdates our Str. VIII, in which most examples of JG 2 were found. 72 Note a wishbone- shaped handle decorated in red and black (PL 63:15) that appears to emulate the Base Ring or White Slipped bowls. However, since it was found in a Str. V context it is not certainly related to the category of import imitations. 73 Four red-slipped strainers were found (Pis. 69:17; 73:9; 78:22; 77:18). Two such jugs with red slip and black painted decoration, one found in a Str. V/IVB context and one unstratified, are discussed in Timnah II: 122. These jugs are well known in contexts of the 11th century but greatly decline in the 10th century. Note also a narrow neck and basket handle (Timnah II: 122) from a similar context; this might be classified with our JG 6b. 74 There is a similarity between this rim and neck and those of Dothan's Type 9, "cylindrical bottle" (Dothan 1982: 160-168, Fig. 34). PL 72:21 may perhaps have belonged to such a vessel, which would be the only one found at 142</page><page sequence="152">THE POTTERY OF STRATA XII-V Tel Batash. However, since the material is so fragmentary, this sherd was classified with JG 6. 75 Two biconical jugs from Tell Abu Kharaz, Phase IV (contemporary with Fischer's "Chocolate-on- White I") are alternatively termed "Bichrome" or "Bichrome- decorated" by Fischer (1999: Fig. 7:1, 3). However, it seems that these should not be included with the impotred "Bichrome Ware", but rather are local Canaanite vessels that are related to the Bichrome Ware by their decoration. See also the discussion of our S J 2c and JG 3. 76 The claim made by Grant and Wright that this vessel type is more common in LB I, since it is lacking from LB II tomb groups at Beth-Shemesh, is contradicted by information that they subsequently provide: "in LB II there seems to be a large number of one-handled jugs which have a sharp edge around the center from which the shoulder rises to the neck in a straight line ..." (Ain ShemsV : 115, n. 9). 77 Note a sporadic later appearance of this form, though rather degenerate, in Str. VI at Megiddo (Megiddo //: PI. 81:2). 78 Though this trait becomes common in Iron I, it should be noted that biconical jugs with basket handle and strainer, mostly of squat proportions, may be found in earlier contexts, though very rarely (e.g. Megiddo II: Pis. 51:9; 63:7; Dothan, Tomb 1, Level 4: Cooley and Pratico 1994: Fig. 33:2). 79 Though this trait becomes common in late LB II and Iron I, it should be noted that biconical jugs with basket handle and strainer, mostly of squat proportions, may be very occasionally found in earlier LB contexts (e.g. Megiddo II: Pis. 51:9; 63:7; Dothan, Tomb 1, Level 4: Cooley and Pratico 1994: Fig. 33:2). 80 Though these fragmentary examples have one shoulder handle, they may belong to our two-handled BV 2a. In any event, the shoulder handle is an early LB trait on these vessels, whether they are one- or two-handled. 81 The use of the term "mug" for biconical vessels should not be related to the vessels termed "mugs" in the Mycenaean repertoire, since the latter are open vessels (Mountjoy 1986: 128, e.g. FS 266). The "Aegean-inspired" shapes cited by Tufnell (if indeed they are relevant) are Cypriot and are generally not called "mugs". In light of the above, this term is misused for small closed biconical vessels in Tomb 387 at Dan (Biran and Ben-Dov 2002: 72). Mullins (2002: 252) used the term "mug" for small biconical vessels with one handle. 82 A resemblance was noted between the general shape of this vessel and a group of kraters with high ring bases that are typical of the end of the LB and the early Iron Age (e.g. Balensi 1980: PI. 9:1, 8, Str. VB; Megiddo II: Pl. 70:1, Str. VII A). These are removed in both time and place from our PL 51:12 and it is difficult to prove an affinity. Another shape that vaguely recalls our vessel, with one or two handles (and several handles in Iron I), is termed a "krater-mug" and found in the tomb at Dothan (Cooley and Pratico 1995: Figs. 21:3; 31:1-3; 33:6-7; 34:5). Examples of these are found in all levels of the tomb, from LB IIA to Iron I (Cooley and Pratico 1995: 161). 83 Tufnell notes that the two vessels from this tomb, which is dated to the end of LB II, are "not closely matched elsewhere" (Lachish IV: 250) and "one bears a motif that appears in 18th Dynasty contexts" (Lachish IV: 219). Thus, these vessels might belong to the earlier part of the LB. 84 One additional almost complete example of this type was found out of context in Area C (Reg. No. 5082). 85 Note the resemblance of this type of decoration to the white slip and red concentric circles painted inside BL 51, BL58 and BL 59. 86 Note two larger flasks, one with a pronounced inner gutter rim, painted in red and black, and one body sherd, from Iron I levels at Gezer (Gezer IV: Pis. 33:5; 38: 1 , Str. XII-XII). 87 Killebrew ( 1 998b: 1 29) considered this an import because of its similarity to late Mycenaean HIB wares from the eastern Aegean and eastern Mediterranean. However, no other support for this was offered. 88 We employ here the terminology used in the NEAEHL for the subdivisions of the MB. 89 This comparison is limited due to the small amount of published Canaanite pottery from that site. Bietak 1991: 44, Fig. 1 1 shows open carinated bowls, open rounded bowls with small spiral handles, and globular cooking pots; these types are found in our Str. XI. Tell el-Yahudiyeh juglets that are apparently of the type found at Batash occur in large numbers in Str. El-D/3 but are rare in D/2 (Bietak 1991: 44, 46). Str. D/2 contained Bichrome Ware and it seems that LC Cypriot imports do not predate Str. C/3 (Bietak and Hein 2001: 172). 90 The dates of the destruction of Megiddo IX and Tell el- ' Ajjul City II are much debated and may have taken place as late as LB IB. 91 Though Fischer (200 1 : 1 70), in a minority opinion, claims that White Slip I may appear in contexts predating the 1 8th Dynasty. 92 In fact, the scope, location and even very existence of Egyptian military campaigns by the first pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty, especially in southern Canaan, is debated (e.g. Weinstein 1981; Hoffmeier 1989; Dever 1990; Redford 1992: 149-155). 93 Though the use of a mold (as opposed to a fast wheel) is sometimes considered an expression of decline in the quality of LB pottery production, such a device actually promotes production, especially mass-production, and may be considered an improvement in some ceramic industries (Arnold 1985: 204-208). 94 Note, however, that these two juglets were found in a 143</page><page sequence="153">CHAPTER TWO street to the west of the building; thus their context is somewhat less instructive than the destruction debris inside the building. 95 Gittlen (1981: 51-52) noted the decline in LB IIB and concluded that the importation in essence ceased. However, it seems that this conclusion is too sweeping and the imports (Cypriot and Mycenaean) did continue until the early 12th century. 96 Our figures are somewhat lower than those presented in Mazar 1998: 375, Table 3, due to a reassessment of the stratigraphie attribution of the loci included in the study. 97 My thanks to A.

Cypriot wares are predominant and the range of wares is typical of imports found at sites throughout the southern Levant: Monochrome, Base Ring I and II, White Slip I and II, and White Shaved ware. There are minuscule quantities of Mycenaean imports. The largest concentrations are from Str. IX, VIII and VII (21.1%, 32% and 25.3% of the Cypriot imported sherds respectively), and in Str. VIII and VII there are quantities of complete or semi- restorable vessels." * Editors' Note The quantitative analysis of the imported Cypriot material included complete or near-complete restored vessels, most of which appear in the plates, as well as sherds. A number of these were small body sherds that were not certainly representative of entire vessels. When we believed that such sherds could belong to one vessel, they were counted as such. Only when the fabric, design and color pointed to the body sherds belonging to separate vessels did we count them independently. Table 41 shows the discrepancy between such a count (including body sherds) and a rim count (see Chapter H. 1 and Timnah II: 12-14 for discussion of this method). However, since breakage patterns of the delicate imported ware undoubtedly play a role in the formation of this discard (see below), we decided to include the full range of data in the following discussion, though it must be borne in mind that we are dealing mainly with sherds rather than complete vessels. ANALYSIS BY STRATUM I. CYPRIOT POTTERY (Tables 40-41) Str. X This represents the transitional MB-LB I level; most of the sherds were found in the fragmentary remains of the courtyard of the large, though poorly preserved, Building 720 ( Timnah /: 41-45). Twenty-five imported Cypriot sherds were found in Str. X, representing ca. 12% of all imports at Tel Batash; the material was all fragmentary. Of the imported wares in this stratum, Monochrome comprises 36%, Base Ring 32% and White Slip 32%. Of the latter, two sherds (of the same bowl) were identified as White Slip I (Photo 64) and one sherd, discovered in debris above the MB IIB rampart, is Transitional White Slip II (PI. 4:9). The other five sherds related to the White Slip family are very small body sherds that cannot be further defined. The sherds are predominantly from open vessels: Monochrome Photo 64.

In this connection one should also mention Pl. 10:22, a sherd of a local imitation of the White Slip hemispherical bowls (see above, pp. 50-51). It should be noted that the eight stratigraphically secure Base Ring sherds that could be identified are very small body sherds belonging to closed vessels. Str. IX In Str. IX (LB I) the quantities of imported wares increased to 2 1 . 1 % of all imports at Tel Batash; the finds were mainly associated with Building 715 {Jimnah I: 45-51). As in Str. X, the imports are fragmentary and are largely represented by individual sherds, although there are occasional joining sherds (Photo 65). Some 45 vessels appear to be represented amongst the sherds. The full range of Cypriot imported wares is represented: Monochrome (Pl. 19:15-16), Base Ring I and II (Pl. 19:17-18), and White Slip II (Pl. 19:9-14). Of these, Base Ring is predominant, comprising Photo 65. Str.

White Slip is likewise represented in sizeable quantities, comprising 34% of the imported wares from this level. The pottery is equally divided between open and closed shapes. The open vessels are represented by a variety of bowls: White Slip hemispherical bowls, Monochrome bowls, and Base Ring carinated cups. The closed vessels are predominantly Base Ring jugs and occasionally juglets. Str. VIII In Str. VIII (LB IB) the quantity of imported Cypriot wares once again increases, reaching 32% of all imports (Photo 66). This figure includes 17 sherds from Str. IX-VIII, represented by pits cut into the Str. 152</page><page sequence="162">CYPRIOT AND MYCENAEAN POTTERY Photo 66. Str. VIII: imported Cypnot pottery. IX Building 715, apparently during the construction of the Str. VIII Building 475 (! Timnah /: 51). The 69 identifiable vessels are mostly represented by single or joining sherds, along with six completely or semi- restorable vessels (see Pis. 24:1, 26:8, 33:6. 37:16-18). The imported pottery was found mainly in association with or in the destruction debris of the large patrician house, Building 475, as well as in the courtyard to its south and the street to its west {Jimnah /: 52-58). Base Ring comprises over 58.8% of the imported wares in this stratum. Of the 41 Base Ring vessels and sherds in this stratum, two sherds appear to be BR I, while 17 are BR II (Pis. 24:5-7, 9; 26:8-9; 33:6; 37:16) and the rest Photo 67. Str. VIII: Base Ring Ware (a: PI. 26:8; b: PL 37:16). are non-indicative sherds. Almost 26% of the imported pottery is White Slip II (PL 24:1-4; 33:8-9), while White Shaved ware comprises 11% (Pl. 37:17-18). In addition, there was one small sherd of a Monochrome bowl (Pl. 33:5). The majority of the imported shapes are closed vessels, predominantly Base Ring jugs and juglets, which comprise almost a quarter of the total identifiable shapes (Photo 67). The White Shaved ware is restricted to juglets (Photo 68). Open vessels comprise 37% of the imports, primarily White Slip II hemispherical bowls (Photo 69), but also Base Ring carinated cups, as well as one small sherd of a Monochrome bowl. Str. VII In Str. VII (LB IIA) some 54 vessels have been identified, comprising 25.3% of the total imports found at Tel Batash. Particularly striking in this level is the assemblage of twelve complete or partially preserved vessels (Pis. 45, 51, 54; Photo 70). Most of the imports were associated with the large patrician house, Building 315 ( Timnahl : 58-66). Other imported pottery was found in Building 48 1 , in the courtyard to the south of Building 315 ( Ä«Ä«mnah 1 : 66-69) or in the stratified accumulation of deposits in the street ( Ä«Ä«mnah I: 70-71). As in the other strata, the imported ceramics are mainly represented by Base Ring H (61% of the imported pottery). White Shaved ware juglets (Photo 71) and White Slip hemispherical bowls likewise constitute a fairly large proportion of the assemblage (18.5% and 20.4% respectively).

Only 20 vessels of imported wares could be identified, represented by single or joining sherds (Pis. 56:9; 59:12-15). Half of the imported sherds (10) were associated with the earlier building phase of Str.

The imports mainly comprise closed Base Ring II vessels (six jugs, 155</page><page sequence="165">CHAPTER THREE two juglets and possibly one lentoid flask 55% of the imports in this stratum) and also include three White Slip II hemispherical bowls decorated with the typical ladder pattern in the so-called "Normal Style" (Russell 1989: 3) and three White Slip II Late hemispherical bowls (Pis. 56:9, 59:12) of a type characteristic of the final part of the 13th century (LC IIC) on Cyprus (Popham 1972: Type Id, 466; Fig. 57:3, 5; Russell 1989). Other LC vessel types represented amongst the sherds are White Shaved dipper juglets (three sherds) and BR II carinated cups (from two vessels).

Curiously, two additional joining fragments of this vessel came from the courtyard south of Building 475. Table 42. Distribution of Mycenaean imports by stratum.

Typical LC IIC wares of the 13th century are found in the levels associated with the latest LB occupation of the site, in Str. VI. In between, importation of Cypriot ceramics peaked during the 15th-14th centuries BCE (LB IB-IIA) in Str. VIII and VII, a pattern that appears to be typical of the Levant as a whole (Gittlen 1981: 51). This is a period associated with the intensification of large-scale trade in the East Mediterranean, predominantly between the Aegean, Cyprus and the Levant. It is notable that in the strata corresponding to this period of large-scale international trade only minute quantities of Mycenaean ceramics were recovered, although excavations were concentrated in an elite area associated with patrician residences. The implication is that Mycenaean imports were either not highly sought or not easily attainable at the site. The location of contemporary tomb groups would be of interest, since these might well contain larger quantities of Mycenaean ceramics, counterbalancing the apparent lack of such ceramics from settlement contexts. This distribution pattern is widely replicated throughout the southern Levant. DISCUSSION OF THE WARES MONOCHROME Cypriot undecorated hand-made pottery, the so-called Monochrome Ware, is very poorly defined. A variety of different ware types have been grouped together under the same imprecise terminology, which conceals chronological and regional variation (Pilides 1 99 1 ; Russell 1991; Steel in press). The class of Monochrome pottery imported to the Levant at the beginning of the LB belongs to Russell's Type A and is characterized by thin walls, a buff fabric and a thin red to brown matt slip (Russell 1 99 1 : 1 34). In Cyprus it is found in LC I-HA contexts and is one of the markers of the transition from the MB to the LB there. The ware was imported to the Levant, where it is found in large quantities (Oren 1969: 140-142). In fact, at the beginning of the LB Monochrome was the dominant Cypriot import to the Levant at sites like Tell Abu Hawam (Balensi, personal communication). Monochrome vessels are found at Tel Batash in Str. X-VIII. In Str. X (the transitional MB-LB I level) Monochrome pottery is well represented, comprising nine sherds, around 36% of the imported pottery in this stratum. In Str. VIII, Monochrome declines to one sherd, which might be in secondary deposition. In any case it is statistically insignificant and can tell us little about contacts with Cyprus at the time of the Str. VIII occupation. The Monochrome from Tel Batash is very fragmentary and is represented only by small sherds. The repertoire is restricted to a range of hemispherical and carinated bowls. In general, the sherds are too small to estimate the rim diameter and size of the original vessel. In the southern Levant, Monochrome Ware is a characteristic transitional MB-LB I import and is frequently associated with other Cypriot transitional wares: White Painted VI and Red on Black (Oren 1969: 142). However, it is noteworthy that at Tel Batash the Cypriot imports associated with Monochrome belong entirely to the LB tradition. In Str. X, for example, the peak of Monochrome Ware at Tel Batash, it is found together with White Slip I and Base Ring I, rather than the transitional MB-LB wares. BASE RING Base Ring is the quintessential Late Cypriot import to the Levant. At Tel Batash it is found in greater quantities than the other Cypriot wares in all levels. The range of Base Ring shapes is varied in contrast to the other Cypriot wares found at the site. These are mainly closed vessels and comprise jugs and juglets, as well as two lentoid flasks and a single bull rhyton. Open shapes, represented only by carinated cups, are also found at the site. Jugs are the most common Base Ring vessels at Tel Batash, though the shape is represented more commonly by fragmentary sherds than by restorable vessels. This is partly a result of the fragility of the shape, which is characterized by very thin walls (usually 2 mm thick) in comparison to the height of the vessel. Two types are represented at Batash: the Base Ring I jug with relief decoration and the Base Ring II jug commonly decorated with groups of four parallel lines of white paint. The jug with relief decoration is most common in LB IB-IIA levels in the Levant and tends to be found in tombs (Guy 1938: Pis. 11:13; 50:111; Tufnell 1958: Pis. 800, 842; Amiran 1960: Fig. 1:18). Juglets decorated with painted decoration of groups of four white lines comprise the second most prominent group in the Base Ring II repertoire at Tel Batash and a number of semi-restorable juglets were recovered from Str. VIII and VII. This is the most common variety in the southern Levant (Gittlen 1993: 157</page><page sequence="167">CHAPTER THREE 112), especially in LB IIA contexts, and is represented at Beth-Shean in both cemetery and settlement contexts (Oren 1973: Fig. 37:1; Gittlen 1993: Figs. 56:7-8) and in tombs at Lachish and Jerusalem (Tufnell 1958: PI. 80:865; Amiran 1960: Fig.l:9-10). Carinated cups are among the most common Base Ring vessels found in settlement contexts on Cyprus (Russell 1989: 4) and the shape was a popular export to the Levant in LB IIA (e.g. Amiran 1960: Fig. 2:26). However, while the shape is consistently represented in the LB strata at Tel Batash, it comprises only a minority of the Base Ring vessels found at the site. Moreover, it is represented only by fragmentary sherds and there are no restorable or semi-restorable examples. Unlike the jugs and juglets, which were frequently at least partially restorable, if not complete, the non-restorable nature of the carinated cups is very suggestive for interpreting the use of Cypriot imports within a Levantine settlement context. It has been noted that there will be continuous breakage of ceramics that are repeatedly used within domestic contexts, and that consequently these will be represented in larger quantities in the archaeological record (Shott 1996; Varien and Potter 1997). Likewise, the extremely fragmentary nature of the Base Ring cups from Tel Batash (though found in relatively limited numbers as opposed to the closed shapes) implies a continuous sequence of their use, breakage, and replacement within the settlement. The other Base Ring shapes are each represented by a single complete example, both from Str. VII and associated with Building 315: a lentoid flask (PI. 53:7; though note another flask fragment found in Str. VI, Pl. 59:15) and a Base Ring bull rhyton (Pl. 45:11). The lentoid flask was commonly exported to the Levant, occurring for example at Ugarit (Schaeffer 1949: Figs. 71:16; 80:21) and Tell Abu Hawam (Balensi 1980: PI. 26:16), and is particularly common at sites in the extreme southern Levant, such as Tell el-' Ajjul (Petrie 1933: PI. 11:53) and Lachish (Tufnell 1958: PI. 81:874-875). The form is more typical of the LB IIA. Bull rhyta are a typical component of the Base Ring repertoire in Cyprus, where they are found in both tomb and settlement contexts. They were also exported to the Levant, where they are more typical of funerary contexts (Amiran 1960: Fig. 2:21), but are also found in settlement contexts, as at Ugarit (Courtois 1978: Figs. 31:1; 32:2; 32A); note, however, that the latter may derive from tomb looting debris. At Tell Abu Hawam, four bull rhyta were found in a sanctuary deposit (Hamilton 1935: 47, No. 286; 49, Nos. 302-204; Balensi 1980: 65-66, PI. 116:5, 7; Balensi 1985: Fig. 2). The contexts of the rhyta suggest that they had a symbolic ritual function in the Levant, possibly for pouring libations, though Nys (2001) argues against such a ceremonial use for this form. WHITE SLIP White Slip Ware is well documented in the Levant during the LB and constitutes around 28% of the total Cypriot assemblage (Gittlen 1981: 54). At Tel Batash the ware is found in Str. X through VI, until the end of the LB habitation of the site, and comprises about a quarter of the imported wares. Open shapes are prevalent, mainly hemispherical bowls, though deep bowls with everted rims occur; one tankard sherd was found as well. This is typical of the distribution of White Slip in indigenous Cypriot contexts, since the ware was predominantly used as fine tableware. The White Slip from Tel Batash is with only a few exceptions represented by fragmentary sherds that are non-restorable; this would suggest extensive daily use of the shapes rather than their being kept carefully to one side as a prestige object. As is already indicated by the associations of the Monochrome imports, the earliest phase of Cypriot importation (MC-LC) is not represented at Tel Batash. There is, however, a small quantity of White Slip I pottery in Str. X. In total, White Slip I comprises only 3.4% of the total White Slip imports to Batash. The only White Slip I shape represented at the site is the hemispherical bowl. The two non-joining bowl fragments from Str. X (Pl. 10:23-24) are decorated with the rope lattice motif typical of the Proto White Slip ware, with the characteristic diagonal lines across the horizontal parallel lines (Vermeule and Wolsky 1990: 375, Fig. 46). The wavy band below the rim is found on Proto White Slip and White Slip I bowls, being replaced in White Slip II by a row of small dots or dashes along the rim. Although the decorative features of these sherds might suggest that they belong to the Proto White Slip repertoire, their technical aspect belongs firmly in the White Slip I tradition, particularly the thick white slip burnished to a slight luster by horizontal strokes and the bichrome effect of the painted decoration (dark brown and light yellowish brown) achieved through differing application of the paint. White Slip I pottery has a wider distribution in the Levant than its predecessor Proto White Slip, though still mainly coastal and along the main highways into 158</page><page sequence="168">CYPRIOT AND MYCENAEAN POTTERY the interior. The largest concentration of White Slip I pottery is at the site of Tell el-' Ajjul at the southern extreme of Canaan (see discussion in Bergoffen 2001; Oren 2001). Otherwise, White Slip I is widely distributed throughout the southern Levant and has been attested at (mostly coastal) sites including Akko, Tell Abu Hawam (Balensi 1985: 71, No. 12), Tell Shiqmona, Dor, Tel Mevorakh (Stern 1984: Figs. 10:25; 17:4; Pis. 39:5-6,10; 44:1-6), Megiddo, Hazor (Yadin 1958: Pis. CIV:27-29; CLIX:4-5), Tel Michal, Jaffa and Lachish (Tufnell 1940: PI. LXIV:4). However, at all these sites White Slip I is found in minute, statistically insignificant quantities, as at Tel Batash, and the main emphasis of Cypriot trade appears to have been centered on the southern limits of Canaan and the Nile Delta. It is only in the subsequent LB IIA phase that White Slip II pottery was imported in large quantities to the Levant. White Slip II is found in the Levant from the 15th century BCE. The so-called "Normal" decorative style, characterized by the use of the ladder pattern with thick outer bands as the primary decorative component, is the most common type imported to the Levant. The typical shape in both Cyprus and the Levant is the hemispherical bowl, which is the predominant White Slip form identified at Tel Batash. Other shapes have also been identified at Tel Batash, including a krater (cf. Popham 1972: Fig. 55:6; Russell 1989: Fig. 38), the tankard (cf. Popham 1972: Fig. 55:2-3; Russell 1989: Fig. 49, K-AD 153) and the large deep bowl with everted rim (PL 19:15) (cf. Russell 1989: Fig. 5 1 , K-AD 143, K-AD 149), all represented by a single sherd. There are two examples at Tel Batash of the early form of the Normal Style, White Slip II Transitional, one (PI. 4: 9) from unstratified eroded material above the MB ramparts and one from Str. IX (not in the plates). The distinguishing feature of this style is the use of strokes of paint of equal thickness to form the ladder pattern (Popham 1972: Fig. 53). In Cyprus this style is typical of the LC IIA period and its appearance at Tel Batash belongs to the first stage of large-scale exportation of White Slip II to the Levant. Though LC II starts in Cyprus at ca. 1450 BCE, we should be extremely cautious in extrapolating chronological evidence from the presence of a single sherd in an archaeological level. The Normal Style identified at Tel Batash is otherwise typical of the LC IIA-B period. It can be subdivided into smaller groups on the basis of its additional decorative elements, either vertical or horizontal: hooked lozenge chains (eight examples), hatched parallel bands (23 examples), dots (16 examples), lozenges (two examples). Similar groups of White Slip have been identified throughout the Levant during the 15th and 14th centuries BCE at sites such as Hazor, Lachish and Megiddo (Gittlen 1993: 113-116). The tankard is decorated by a vertical panel filled with a double chain of cross-hatched lozenges alternating with a chain of lozenges, a decorative scheme typical of LC IIA-B tankards and kraters (Russell 1989: Figs. 48-49). A possible example (Reg. No. 4282/3, not illustrated) of the White Slip IIA Style (Popham 1972: 445-447; Russell 1989: 2-3) is a small sherd found in Locus 460 (Str. VIB). This piece is identifiable by its "palm tree" motif (Popham 1972: Fig. 5 1 ; Russell 1989: Fig. 3: xxiii). In Cyprus, White Slip IIA was apparently a regional style, centered at Kouklia in the southwest of the island, and occurs only infrequently further east (Popham 1972: 446-447). Russell, for example, notes only the occasional presence of the style at Kalavasos- Ayios Dhimitrios (Russell 1989:3). Examples of the White Slip IIA style occur only infrequently in the Levant, such as at Tell Abu Hawam (Balensi 1980: 399, PI. 27:6-12). WHITE SHAVED Imports of White Shaved Ware are found in Str. VIII- VI, with the main concentration in Str. VIII- VII. The ware has a pale yellow, buff or green fabric with a sandy texture and occasional medium-sized angular red grits, covered with a pale cream, buff or yellow matt slip. The characteristic feature, however, is its surface, which had been pared with a knife. In Cyprus, White Shaved is found mainly in the eastern half of the island, particularly at Enkomi (Steel in press) and Athienou (Dothan and Ben-Tor 1983: 41-42, Fig. 9), and is often found in funerary or ritual deposits. The White Shaved repertoire from Tel Batash is mainly restricted to the juglet with a slightly pinched mouth and ovoid body with pointed base (ÃstrÃ¶m 1972: Fig. LVIII:2-3, 6-8). There is only a single example of a round-mouthed jug, represented by three joining sherds (Reg. No. B9 189/5, Locus B918; not in the plates) found in Str. VIII. This is typical of the distribution of White Shaved pottery in general in both Cyprus and the Levant. Gittlen notes that around 97% of White Shaved vessels from the Levant and 94% from Cyprus are juglets (Gittlen 1981: 53). The Cypriot juglet imitates the Levantine wheel-made dipper juglet of the MB-LB tradition, and ironically the Cypriot imitation was itself emulated by Levantine potters during the LB. The shape 159</page><page sequence="169">CHAPTER THREE was exported in large quantities to the Levant, where it had a wide distribution, being found, for example, at Tell el-Far'ah (S), Tell el-4 Ajjul, Deir el-Balah and Ashkelon (Petrie 1934: PL LIV:5IQ; Dothan 1979: 38-39, Ills. 82, 88; Bergoffen 1988: 161) in the south, Megiddo, Tell Abu Hawam and Beth-Shean in the central Levant (Guy 1938: PL 11:16; Anati 1959: Fig. 7:7; Gittlen 1993: 113, Fig. 56:12-13), and at Ugarit on the north coast of the Levant (Schaeffer 1949: Figs. 52:23; 59:24-28; 62:21; 65:23, 68:8, 74:23-24). Their porous fabric indicates that these vessels did not contain a particular substance. Moreover, they are typically found in funerary deposits inside large jars, suggesting that they were predominantly used for serving a liquid commodity. They appear to have been specifically targeted at the Levantine export market (Gittlen 1981:54) rather than being made for local Cypriot consumption. The shape is infrequently attested in Egypt and only in very small quantities, for example at Marsa Matruh (White 1985: 76, Fig. 30). Such juglets were only rarely exported to the west, odd pieces turning up in the Ulu Burun shipwreck (Bass 1986: 280, 111.12), at Kommos on Crete in a LM IIIA:2 context (Watrous 1992: Pl. 52, Fig. 70, No. 951) and at Mycenae (E. French, personal communication). More unusual is the spindle bottle (Pl. 45:10). The shape occurs sporadically in funerary contexts in the central-eastern zone of Cyprus: Ay ios lako vos tombs 13/17 and 141/2, Ay ia Paraskevi tomb 6/61, and Dhekelia Steno tomb 2/12, 68 (ÃstrÃ¶m 1972: 224, Fig. LVIII: 12). It has also been identified at Sinda. However, no other examples of the White Shaved spindle bottle have been found in the Levant. The spindle bottle shape is more typical of the Red Lustrous Wheelmade ware (ÃstrÃ¶m 1972: Fig. LIV:5-8; Eriksson 1993: 23-25), which on Cyprus had a largely funerary or ceremonial function. The shape was copied in a variety of local fine wares, such as White Lustrous (Russell 1989: Fig. 44, Pl. XXI, K-Ad 126), Base Ring (Merrillees 1968: 164; ÃstrÃ¶m 1972: 166-167) and more unusually White Slip (Popham 1972: Fig. 56:11; Russell 1989: Fig. 43, PL 21, K-AD 82). The form is very rare in the White Shaved repertoire in funerary, ceremonial or settlement contexts in Cyprus. It is apparently unique in the imported Cypriot repertoire in the Levant, though one should note a small bottle, 17.5 cm high, from a LB tomb at Tell 'Eitun (Tzaferis and Hess: Fig. 6:8) that is described as being made of a red clay, shaved and "a Cypriot imitation of the 'Syrian bottle', combining two Cypriot styles, the 'red lustrous' and 'shaved style'." The Cypriot, rather than Syrian, origin of these bottles is recognized today (Eriksson 1993). Consequently, the significance of the spindle bottle from Tel Batash is difficult to assess. Given the context in which it was found, in association with a residence containing a variety of specialized unguent containers, and its good state of preservation, it is very probable that the Tel Batash spindle bottle retained some of its ritual connotations and ceremonial function within its new cultural context. MYCENAEAN Mycenaean pottery forms only a very small percentage (4.6%, including the sherds found out of context) of the imported wares found at Tel Batash. It is entirely represented by closed shapes, of which piriform jars, a beaker jug (FS 144) and an alabastron (FS 94) are identifiable. The fragment of a beaker jug in Str. VIII represents one of the earliest of such imports in the Levant. The only complete Mycenaean vessel found at Tel Batash was PL 46: 1 , the LH IIIA:2 alabastron from the Str. VII Building 315 (this alabastron was examined by V. Hankey and P. Mountjoy as well as myself). This vessel is a common Mycenaean import to the Levant during the 14th and 13th centuries BCE, with a wide distribution from Ras Shamra in the north to Tell el- ' Ajjul and Deir el-Balah in the south (Petrie 1933: PL XI-.60Z; Dothan 1973: 133, PL 43c). The form was particularly prized for its contents, usually interpreted as a luxury unguent. Otherwise, the Mycenaean pottery from the site is very fragmentary and is represented by odd sherds found in secondary deposits. DISCUSSION BY BUILDING Two major deposits of Cypriot imports have been identified at the site, in Building 475 (Str. VIII) and Building 315 (Str. VII). Chapter IV discusses the distribution of all finds in these two buildings. Below is a discussion of the imports found in each house. Building 475: Str. VIII (Table 43) Building 475 covered most of Area B in Str. VIII and was destroyed by fire. Amongst the large quantities of ceramics found in this destruction debris were significant quantities of Cypriot imports, comprising an apparent total of some 41 vessels. However, very few vessels were complete or restorable. Most of the 160</page><page sequence="170">C YPRIOT AND MYCENAEAN POTTERY Table 43. Distribution of imported ceramics in Building 475.

Cypriot pottery was found in the destruction debris rather than in situ on the floors, though a complete dipper juglet (PL 37:18) was found on the surface of the courtyard to the south of the building, Locus B 1209. While the majority of the imports were components of dinner services (bowls or jugs), a number of small and mostly fragmentary juglets, presumably containers of a luxury commodity, were also found. The concentration of Cypriot imports in association with the large patrician residence is worthy of comment, suggesting that such imports were a luxury that were not disseminated throughout the settlement but were restricted to the local elite. This supposition, however, needs to be tested against stratified deposits elsewhere on the site that have not yet been excavated. The fragment of the imported Mycenaean beaked jug (PL 37: 19) found in the courtyard to the south of the building should be recalled. This is a rare form among the imported Mycenaean pottery in the Levant, and its attribution to Str. VIII makes it one of the earliest imports of Mycenaean pottery in this region. Building 315: Str. VII (Tables 44-45) The patrician residence of Str. VII, Building 315, was a rich source of finds. Amongst the pottery was a discrete concentration of Cypriot vases and a single completely restorable Mycenaean alabastron, which the excavator suggests fell from living quarters in the upper storey during the conflagration that destroyed the building ( Timnah /: 65). This deposit of Cypriot imports in Building 315 is very suggestive for interpreting the cultural use of imported ceramics at the site. It contrasts greatly with the imported ceramic assemblage found in association with the Str. IX Building 715, which was very fragmentary and was typified by a range of bowls or cups in the White Slip, Base Ring and Table 44. Distribution of imported ceramics in Building 315.

Of particular significance is the condition in which the vases were found inside the house. Relatively many of them were near complete, and those that could be restored from numerous sherds had simply been broken during the conflagration that destroyed Building 315. The imported Cypriot wares found at Tel Batash in the other strata were found in a far more fragmentary state, especially the bowls. This suggests a different pattern of use for different categories of imported vessels, with more careful usage of the pottery found in Building 315. Alternatively, it might illustrate different conditions during the destruction of each building. In Building 315 there was a concentration of high- status containers of precious commodities (the bull rhyton, the spindle bottle and of course the Mycenaean alabastron), found together with Base Ring jugs and White Shaved dipper juglets. Moreover, greater care appears to have been taken of the small containers found in Building 315. In contrast, the fragmentary nature of the bowls implies that these were in regular use and were continually being broken, removed from the settlement and replaced by new imports, thereby leaving only residual remains. However, it should also be emphasized that the good preservation of the ceramics from Building 315 provides us with a snapshot of the pottery actually in use on the site at the time of its destruction. The distinctive character of the imported ceramics found in the structure is emphasized by a small number of very specialized and rare shapes: the only restorable (complete) Mycenaean vessel found at Batash, together with the unique White Shaved ware spindle bottle and the Base Ring bull. The latter two appear to have had a ritual connotation within their indigenous Cypriot contexts, although it is uncertain whether such connotations would have been transferred to the Levant. In general, spindle bottles (more commonly Red Lustrous), dipper juglets, Mycenaean pyxides and Base Ring bull rhyta are shapes more usually found in funerary contexts in the Levant. At Tel Batash, however, they were found explicitly associated with a residence, giving an important indication as to the use of such vessels before or at the time of their deposition within tomb groups. Indeed, the discrete deposit of Cypriot imports found in Building 315 might indicate specialized activity of some kind within the building, and also denotes the high status of these particular imports within the site. CONCLUSIONS The range of imports to Tel Batash is largely typical of Cypriot and Mycenaean imports to the region during the LB. Cypriot pottery is far more numerous than Mycenaean, as noted at other sites in the Levant. At Tell Abu Hawam, for example, Mycenaean imports constitute only around 1% of the total pottery, whereas Cypriot pottery makes up 47% of the repertoire (Balensi, personal communication). Of the Cypriot ceramics, Base Ring is predominant, but the White Slip and White Shaved wares are also represented in substantial quantities. In the earliest period of contact with Cyprus during the transitional MB-LB I (represented by Str. X), the typical Cypriot import was the Monochrome bowl. It is noteworthy that no examples of other MC III-LC 1 wares that are commonly found with Monochrome bowls in the Levant (Red on Black, White Painted VI, Proto White Slip) are represented amongst the earliest imports. Instead, the Cypriot pottery from Tel Batash appears to belong to a more advanced stage of exchange between Cyprus and the Levant, characterized by the classic LC I wares. For the most part the range of vessel types is very restricted, as is typical of Late Cypriot imports to the Levant. The greatest quantity of imports were found in Str. VIII and VII, partially supporting Gittlen's assertion that the importation of Late Cypriot wares to the Levant peaked during the LB IIA, after which it declined (Gittlen 1981: 51). There is evidence, however, for the continuation of trade with Cyprus, although to a lesser degree, in LB IIB. The pottery was mainly found in association with the patrician Buildings 475 and 315. The better state of preservation of the small and large closed vessels, the Base Ring II and White Shaved juglets, is notable. Particularly significant is the concentration of such jugs and juglets in both wares among a set of complete or restorable vessels in association with Building 315. The Cypriot pottery from Tel Batash is of great importance and is very illuminating for our understanding of changing patterns of Levantine-Cypriot trade during the LB. The pottery provides a sequence of imports from firm stratigraphie contexts against which the chronology of Cypriot imports elsewhere in the Levant can be tested. Though the use of Cypriot pottery as a chronological tool is problematic, the imports from Tel Batash confirm the chronological sequence proposed by the indigenous wares and other finds at the site. Moreover, 162</page><page sequence="172">C YPRIOT AND MYCENAEAN POTTERY the chronological and spatial distribution of the Cypriot imports at the site, and their differential preservation, give us a clear picture of the value and function of such vessels within a particular Canaanite community during the 15th and 14th centuries BCE, especially the varying patterns of use within the settlement of closed and open shapes.

When considering the total amount of vessels in each building, there were two levels of analysis, both presented in the tables and in the text. One is the count of the items in the plates, which included most of the restored vessels and some sherds, and the other is based on quantitative typological registration that included all the vessels and sherds found in secure loci but not shown in the plates (see Timnah II: 13-14 and above, pp. 9-11); the latter category is thus a total count. While the complete, restored vessels in an assemblage from a destruction level are, of course, the most reliable indicator of vessel quantities, it was deemed useful to register the numerous partial vessels and sherds that were not drawn in order to obtain a fuller picture. During this registration, we attempted to identify sherds possibly belonging to the same vessel by carefully examining the diameter, fabric, decoration and other details. Only when we were convinced that the sherd represented a distinct vessel was it registered as such. This approach broadly conforms to the concept of "minimum number of individuals" (MNI) used in faunai analysis; Schiffer (1996: 296) calls this the "minimum number of vessels (MNV)". Sherds smaller than 4/8 of the reconstructed rim diameter were not counted, assuming that they are more likely be residual or have originated from the bricks or ceiling. Though in some cases, such as bowl, krater and cooking pot rims, this may have somewhat inflated the amount of vessels, it seems that for storage jars this method is particularly valid, since during restoration it became clear that many more jars than could be restored were represented by the sherds, judging from the numerous complete or near-complete rim diameters that were distinguished. The partial state of many of the vessels that could not be restored is most likely the result of the violent nature of the destruction, as well as subsequent leveling and building activities, rather than routine breakage (Schiffer 1996: 296). Moreover, we do consider the possibility that at least some of the sherds were embedded in ceiling material or bricks and are not part of the household assemblage, though this number cannot be too large, since the assemblage was so homogeneous. Despite these pitfalls, it is interesting to note that in most cases the relative proportions of the classes in the household assemblage were found to be quite similar in both counts, with the main discrepancy being jugs in both buildings and bowls in Building 315. An additional methodological problem that must be acknowledged is the difficulty of identifying certain types from rims alone. For example, the similarity between SJ 2 and JG 2 in rim and neck made it impossible in some cases to differentiate one from the other based on this part of the vessel alone. All such rims were designated SJ 2, though some may certainly have belonged to JG 2. However, since we postulate that some of these jugs may have been used for storage, this should not result in a major distortion of the functional picture that we are trying to recreate. The summary discussion of the finds distribution is based mainly on the vessels in the plates, though the total registered quantity is considered as well. The spatial distribution of the vessels and objects found in situ in each building is presented in Figs. 15-17 and Tables 53-54. The term " in situ " can be ambiguous and can have alternative meanings, such as the location of manufacture, the location of use, the first or last place of deposition, etc.; we use it here in its basic significance of "the find-spot of an artifact - its original position of discovery" (Schiffer 1996: 17). Only items presented in the plates and whose exact find spot could be determined were marked on these figures; each is represented by a symbol explained in the key that accompanies Fig. 15. The assumption is that the larger and denser the concentration of restorable sherds in one area, the more likely it is that this is where the vessels were broken (Daviau 1993: 29); it is less certain that this is also where the vessel was regularly used (see below). A fair amount of vessels in each building could be located in situ , while the wide scattering of sherds of many of the restorable vessels serves as an indication of the violent nature of the destruction or various post- depositional processes, as mentioned above. Obviously, 175</page><page sequence="185">CHAPTER FOUR since this process disturbed the picture of normal vessel usage, we cannot infer that the position of each item is routine and primary (Schiffer 1996: 18, 285-28). Reservations about the conclusions that may be drawn from comparative distributional ceramic studies were expressed in our analysis of the Iron Age II houses at Tel Batash ( Timnah II: 173-174). However, despite the various limitations and qualifications, it is hoped that presentation of the entire assemblage will shed light on the nature and scope of the household and its various functions, at least at the moment when its existence abruptly terminated. BUILDING 475 Pis. 21-37; Fig. 15; Photos 76-79; Tables 51-52 (Timnah /: 52-57) The outer dimensions of this house are 13.7 x 13.1 m and its net inner floor space is 79.5 sq m. Altogether 170 (281) vessels were found in Building 475, only 70 of which could be mapped in situ with certainty on the plan (the numbers in parentheses in Table 51 represent the total number of vessels and sherds, including those not shown in the plates). Eleven objects other than pottery were found as well. A substantial concentration of vessels was found in the large stone-paved eastern part of the building (Loci 471 and 475; 40 sq m), divided by a north-south row of pillars. The concentration included a total of some 42 (85) vessels, about a third in the western Locus 471 and the rest in the eastern Locus 475. About a third of the vessels in Locus 471 were found in situ , with an accumulation against the southeastern face of Wall 497 (the eastern wall of Room 467). Four of these were storage jars, while the rest were bowls, jugs and cooking pots. On the other hand, the vast majority of the vessels in Locus 475 on the east were found widely scattered, implying that the havoc in this part of the space was greater. The restored vessels from this space included four storage jars and eight cooking pots, while the remainder were tableware (bowls, jugs, juglets and imports). Thus, from the finds we cannot infer a specific function for Loci 471/475, though the large amount of storage jars seems to imply that storage was most likely a significant function. Daviau (1993: 318) contends that this area functioned as a "primary food preparation area", also noting that it probably served as the main living room. It should be kept in mind that, as she aptly notes, her conclusions were based on limited preliminary publication of the finds in Building 475. Though eight cooking pots were found here, no facilities for cooking or baking were detected in this space. In fact, no installations of any sort were identified in this large space, suggesting that it served mainly for storage and possibly animal pens rather than for intensive food preparation or craft activity. Room 494 is the entrance space, which had to be crossed to enter the building, and as such is not a self- contained room. Most of the 14 (29) vessels and four objects found here were located in situ. The group includes 5 (12) storage jars, along with 2 (7) bowls, one krater, two jugs and two lamps, as well as fragments of 2 (5) Base Ring juglets. It is difficult to determine whether this assemblage represents the normal use of this space or is the result of the act of destruction. This area included four objects other than pottery, including the only scarab found in this building (PL 26: 13). Several of the finds, including a bronze arrowhead, were found just inside the entrance to the building, to the west of the Photo 76. Str.

These objects perhaps fell from the stairs or second floor above or were dropped while the inhabitants escaped from the burning house. Thus, the spindle whorl found here cannot be taken as evidence for any spinning or weaving activity in this space, since it might be a fallen or discarded object. The northwest corner of this space contained a narrow bin, which was found empty. It is the only installation found in this house. The largest concentration of vessels was in Room 467, with some 63 (70) vessels in an area of only 6.6 177</page><page sequence="187">CHAPTER FOUR Photo 78. Str. Vili, Building 475, storage jars.

Most of the vessels were found in the area of a thick layer of black organic burnt material concentrated in the inner part of the room, suggesting that there might have been shelves and/or mats here. This large assemblage contained almost every class of vessel, including 19 (23) storage jars; five of these are painted (SJ 2c), and one is a small jar with a unique processional scene (PI. 31:1). Though 13 cooking pots were found in this room, there is no evidence for cooking facilities. The objects include several pestles and hammer stones and a possible weight (PI. 33:10-13), indicating that some food preparation activity, such as grinding, might have taken place here. Thus, the contents of the room do not point to any particular function. In light of the number and variety of vessels, as well as several objects, it might perhaps be suggested that this room served as a kind of pantry in which many of the household vessels were routinely kept. Another possibility is that the vessels and objects were concentrated here as a hoarding action carried out by the inhabitants, possibly in preparation for a siege; they probably intended to return and reclaim them (Schiffer 1996: 281; Geva 1989: 6-7). Other possible reasons for vessel stockpiling include a potting rather than a non-potting household, taxes and tribute, gift- giving customs, feasting, dowry accumulation and ritual requirements, among others (Rice 1987: 295; DeBoer and Lathrop 1979; Arnold 1991; Deal 1998). Room 492 contained 35 (50) vessels in a somewhat larger space (8.9 sq m). Most of them were concentrated in the southern half of the room, with a smaller group found just inside the entranceway, against the southern face of Wall 496. Bowls and storage jars are in the majority here, almost equally represented respectively by 9 (13) and 11 (20) vessels; this room also included seven jugs and four cooking pots, as well as a large painted horizontal-handled bowl (PI. 34:9), one complete chalice (PL 34:10) and a biconical amphora (Pl. 36:6). Two spindle whorls (Pl. 36: 12-13) were found in the northern part of the room. The finds from this room are thus not particularly informative as to its function, though the relatively large amount of storage jars may imply at least a limited storage function. The three exceptional vessels (chalice, horizontal-handled bowl and biconical amphora) may point to some special status for this room. The northernmost room of the western annex of the building (B820/B726) yielded a group of 14(19) vessels, 179</page><page sequence="189">CHAPTER FOUR Table 52.

Half of them were bowls, while the rest were cooking pots (2), storage jars (2) and tableware, including two imports. Two funnels are also noteworthy. The only finds from the middle cell (B821) are one (2) bowl, one cooking pot, three storage jars and four imported Cypriot vessels; however, as opposed to the room to its north where complete vessels were recovered, the latter group was represented mainly by sherds. The two southernmost cells were found virtually empty. The assumption that these were storage cells {Jimnah /: 57) is based on the fact that they are very small and have no openings, but this assumption is not supported by the contents. However, these small spaces may have been storage facilities for seasonal deposits, e.g. of grain, that were not in use at the time of destruction, possibly attesting to the season in which the house was destroyed. The funnels, used to channel grain or liquids into containers, may attest to such a use. At Tell el-' Ajjul, a small room measuring 2 sq. m that contained 47 vessels and objects was found; Daviau (1993: 364, Fig. 66) suggested that it might have been used as a storeroom for all the items found in it, or that some had fallen from the upper story. The narrow corridor to the west of the building's entrance (B906) contained some 20 sherds that were not restorable to complete vessels, including a pithos sherd (PI. 26: 14). It was suggested that this space served as a stairwell (Jimnah /: 54). Though one may reason that these sherds represent vessels that had been stored here and that their fragmentary state is the result of the destruction process and subsequent rebuilding of the staircase vestibule, the sherds could have arrived here as a result of the destruction, or have come from the ceiling or brick material. Thus, if the stairwell space was used for storage, no clear traces of this function have survived as they did in the subsequent Building 315 (see below). Only 11 objects other than pottery were found in this building, most of them plain utilitarian items such as stones, stoppers and spindle whorls, as well as two bronze arrowheads. The former objects are typical of daily household tasks, while the bronze arrowheads may be related to the destruction of the house. Though the lack of luxury items may reflect lower socio-economic status, it may simply imply that the inhabitants were able to flee with their more prized portable possessions prior to destruction. Indeed, no skeletal remains were found in the building, in contrast to Building 315 (see below). It is also possible that valuables were removed subsequent to the destruction, perhaps by looters who picked through the rubble. Though the building had a stairway, the depth of accumulation and dispersion of the finds did not clearly attest to the existence of an upper story. The staircase may have provided access to the roof, which could have been used for various purposes, such as storage, seasonal entertaining or sleeping (Daviau 1993: 39). Alternatively, the second story may have been only partial, or subsequent construction may have leveled away the remains of the upper story. The repertoire appears to be of a functional household type, with bowls (23%) and storage jars (23%) being the most plentiful vessel classes, followed by cooking pots (16%) and jugs (14%). Though most of the vessels are undecorated, some of the painted storage jars are quite elaborate. Notable also are two decorated biconical vessels as well as a unique carinated bowl with horizontal handles, painted with a rather careless bichrome decoration. However, the execution of these vessels and their decoration are quite crude and they are far from being "luxury ware". It seems that the tableware in everyday use was of simple local manufacture, comprising heavy bowls and jugs; it was noted above in the typological discussion of these types that these heavy- duty vessels were most likely produced with minimum breakage in mind. The small amount of kraters (3 [6]) suggests that food preparation was carried out in other vessels, possibly in large bowls or in the cooking pots themselves. Some of the cooking pots were very large (e.g. Pis. 21:11-12, 15) or very small (e.g. PL 28:7-9). While such large cooking pots may reflect the number of inhabitants in the house, they also might represent other social aspects of eating, such as feasting, whether ceremonial or status-promoting (Dietler and Hayden 2001). Large cooking pots may have been used as well to feed seasonal workers who performed intermittent tasks for the household. The small cooking pots may have been used to prepare food for children, or to heat medicines (DeBoer and Lathrop 1979: 105). The imported bowls and jugs apparently fulfilled the need for finer tableware, while the small imported closed vessels possibly served as containers for some desired commodity (Steel, this volume). Cooking and baking were apparently conducted outside the building, as no such facilities were identified in the excavation of this house (see below). Calculation of the minimum potential storage capacity in this building, based on the 39 (out of 40) jars that could be measured, yielded a figure of ca. 964 liters (see pp. 77- 78; Tables 26-27). This figure does not include potential storage capacity provided by other vessels, such as JG 2, and of course storage in containers other than ceramic. The extremely large and relatively diverse assemblage 182</page><page sequence="192">DISTRIBUTION OF FINDS, ACTIVITY AREAS AND POPULATION ESTIMATES of vessels in Building 475 is a notable phenomenon that might be related to a wide range of factors, such as the number of inhabitants, their socio-economic status, a state of crisis and hoarding, or even the duration of occupation of the house (Rice 1989: 112). BUILDING 315 Pis. 38-50; Photos 80-84; Figs. 16-17; Tables 53-54 ( Timnah /: 58-72) The outer dimensions of this house are 11. 1x13.5 m and the net inner floor space is 95.6 sq m. Altogether 97 (207) vessels were found in this building from the time of its destruction. The amount of vessels in this building more than doubles when the vessels represented by sherds are taken into account. As discussed above, the use of sherds, which might be residual or come from the ceiling or bricks, may result in a certain amount of skewing. However, since we were meticulous in identifying sherds that represent one and the same vessel and counting them as such, it seems that our count is basically reliable, though of course the factor of residual sherds from bricks or ceilings must be considered a possibility as well. The relatively large numbers of sherds and fragmentary Fig. 16.

Distribution of finds: Building 315, upper layer, Plan B (for key to symbols, see Fig. 15). vessels in this house seem to be the result of the violent destruction that took place and the fact that no subsequent activity covered these remains, which were exposed to erosion and post-depositional factors. The accumulation was well over one meter deep and there were two distinct "layers" of finds, which were accordingly divided into two separate plans. Fig. 16 (Plan A) represents the upper layer of finds (down to the elevation of 28.00 m) which apparently fell from an upper story, while Fig. 17 (Plan B) represents the finds on or near the floor (below 28.00 m). Though the distinction between the two was sometimes not altogether clear, the division is informative of the nature of the building's use, as well as its destruction. A relatively large amount of small objects and luxury items, such as cylinder seals, scarabs and numerous fine beads, were found in the upper layer and had perhaps been in use in private quarters on the upper floor ( Ä«Ä«mnah /: 65). As opposed to Building 475, where the staircase corridor did not contain whole vessels in situ, the space 184</page><page sequence="194">DISTRIBUTION OF FINDS, ACTIVITY AREAS AND POPULATION ESTIMATES Photo 80. Str. VII, Building 315, bowls. Photo 81. Str. VII, Building 315, cooking pots. below the stairwell and its bins in Building 315 contained 30 (49) vessels and objects that could be identified in situ , concentrated mainly along the northern and southern walls ( Timnah I: 66, a preliminary analysis giving somewhat different data). The (presumably wooden) stairs started at the western end of this corridor, while the entrance to the storage area below the steps was separate, located at the eastern end of the corridor. The double bin in the southeast corner contained a storage jar, a Base Ring jug and a White Shaved juglet. The northern row of vessels included two storage jars as well as bowls, jugs and a cooking pot, while the southern row had seven storage jars (two of which were painted) and one jug; the latter contained a cluster of bronze arrowheads and a spearhead, fused with charred almonds (Photo 84; see also Photo 38 above). It is difficult to determine whether these contents reflect the routine use of this vessel, for storage or even as a ritual cache (Schiffer 1996: 79-80), or whether they represent hoarding in response to the impending attack on the town. As noted above, some of the jugs might have been used for storage as well, since they are very heavy and would be cumbersome for pouring or serving. Thus the space underneath the stairs was actively used, most likely as a kind of pantry. It may be noted that oil, wine and possibly beer were often stored in darkened rooms (Daviau 1993: 40, 321); this condition would have been met by the narrow Photo 82. Str.

In light of this assumed function the presence of several fine tableware imports here is noteworthy. The finds in the eastern space of the building came mainly from its southern half (Locus 428), while the northern paved area (Locus 438 and its makeup Locus 489) contained only scattered sherds. Though this may be due to the fact that the northeast part of the building was found quite eroded and could originally had contained a more substantial assemblage, it is possible that this part of the house played a role that did not require vessels or other objects, for instance as an animal pen. The vessels in Locus 428 were bowls, cooking pots, jugs and only one fragmentary painted storage jar, as well as a lower grindstone, all comprising a group of household vessels. Three bronze weapons (PL 48: 1 , 3, 5) found in this area may be related to the act of destruction rather than the function of this space (Daviau 1993: 47). The major concentration of vessels and other finds is in the western space, divided from north to south into Loci 412, 314, 315 and 452. The northern end of the western space (Locus 412) contained a concentration of bowls, kraters, as well as one painted storage jar and a goblet. The position of these vessels, as well as the finds, demonstrate no particular pattern and it is difficult to determine whether this was their original placement or the result of the destruction. A semicircular bin in the northwestern corner of Locus 412 was found empty. The other major concentration of finds is in the southern part of this western space (Locus 315), mostly near the western wall of the building (Wall 432) and clustered near the southernmost pillar base of the western row of pillars. (The plan of Building 315 shows objects belonging to Locus 3 15 in the area marked Locus 452; Locus 452 was essentially a sloping pebble accumulation laid against Wall 432, while Locus 315 covered the entire area.) The finds represent quite a potpourri of types, including bowls, kraters, cooking pots, a storage jar, biconical vessel, and an imported Cypriot juglet; nojÅ«gs were found here.

Locus 315 yielded two bronze sheet figurines, as well as a pair of bronze cymbals; these items may have played a role in a domestic cult. It is thus difficult to assign any specific function to this area based on the finds. It is possible that the picture in this large space, as in the eastern strip, reflects the position of vessels at the moment of destruction rather than the routine usage of this space. The central space (Locus 411) was virtually empty; it did, however, contain two arrowheads, which apparently belong to the battle waged in the building as evidenced by a skeleton found in the northern end of this space. It may be surmised that during the use of this building this space was used for livestock and/or access to the side spaces, rather than for storage, food preparation or craft activity. However, once again the lack of finds here might reflect activity related to the final destruction rather than the building's routine function. We postulate, on the basis of the two rows of pillar bases ( Timnah /: 59), that the entire lower story was roofed. This large roofed area could have been used for storage and household tasks such as food preparation (though cooking would have been done in the courtyard fronting the house). Other household crafts such as spinning and dyeing might have taken place here as well; three spindle whorls found in Loci 315 and 314 may be evidence of such activity, though of course they could be here in secondary deposition. Notably, no loomweights were found in this building (or in any other context at Bronze Age and Iron Age I Tel Batash). Though it is possible that this is a fluke of recovery, the fact is that loomweights of unbaked clay often survive conflagrations like the one suffered by Building 315. This may imply that while spinning was conducted inside the house, weaving was not. This area could have also contained small animal pens. Private living quarters were most likely exclusively on the upper story, which may have covered only part of the lower floor. The assemblage in this building too is of a utilitarian, domestic nature. The most frequent vessel class is bowls (27%) followed by an almost equal amount of storage jars (15%) and jugs (13%). Cooking pots comprise 12% of the assemblage. The imported vessels comprise the same proportion (12%) in this building as in the dwelling of the previous stratum. However, the imports in Building 315 now include Mycenaean vessels, as well as a Base Ring bull rhyton and the unique White Shaved Ware spindle bottle, indicating that many of these vessels were prized possessions and not merely tableware or unguent containers. In a survey of Levantine contexts in which Mycenaean pottery has been found, van Wijngaarden (2002: 116) suggested that while such wares were common among all social strata in main urban centers (e.g. Ugarit, Tell Abu Hawam, Megiddo), in smaller regional centers like Tel Batash they were limited to the "local ruling elite" or a "specific, wealthy social group". The beads, cylinder seals, scarabs and metal objects found in this building are additional indications of the relatively high socio-economic level of the owners (Daviau 1993: 53). Cultic objects include a pair of bronze cymbals and two bronze sheet figurines (PL 47:7-10). A notable phenomenon in this building is the presence of at least three pottery vessels that are more routinely found in funerary contexts: the imitation Base Ring jug, the Base Ring bull rhyton and the Cypriot White Shaved spindle bottle. The storage jar capacity of this building, based on 13 (out of 15) jars that could be measured (see p. 78; Tables 26-27), was calculated as ca. 229 liters. As for Building 475, this is a minimum estimate, since other vessels, as well as unrestorable storage jars, could have been used for storage. The bronze weapons (PL 48) and the skeleton in Building 315 are most likely testimony to the violent end of this building. The question of how sudden was this destruction remains open. Judging by the large amount of small objects and the skeletons found in this building as opposed to Building 475, it seems that the destruction took the inhabitants by surprise, while the Str. VIII occupants of Building 475 had more time to evacuate their possessions and themselves (or the objects were subsequently looted). DISCUSSION Since neither of these buildings follows a known architectural blueprint or provides clear information as to function, the conclusion that both buildings were dwellings is based on their typical household pottery repertoires, consisting mainly of vessels for food preparation, serving and consumption, as well as storage vessels, most of plain utilitarian manufacture. Additional indicative household objects include those related to craft production, small economic transactions, domestic cult, personal adornment and prestige or luxury (Daviau 1993: 47-48; 446); the absence of a final report on the faunai remains from Tel Batash is particularly regrettable in this regard (see Chapter 190</page><page sequence="200">DISTRIBUTION OF FINDS, ACTIVITY AREAS AND POPULATION ESTIMATES XVII). Our designation "patrician house" is based on the dimensions and quality of construction of the buildings, as well as the large amount and variety of vessels and personal items found in them (Ilan 2001: 322-323). Though large house size is often used as a criterion of the high status of a household, Chesson (2003: 87) cites ethnographic studies that caution against using wealth as the only reason for a large house; other reasons may be demographic shifts, marriage and residence patterns and other economic, social and political issues related to the local community and its history. Schloen (2001: 148) discusses similar criteria as they affect estimates of family size. Daviau (1993: 319-320) notes that though they were certainly large, well built and imposing, with some similarities to the so-called "governors' houses" of the LB, the houses of Tel Batash were "well within the size range of typical Late Bronze Age houses". However, it must be borne in mind that the nature of the ceramic assemblage in both buildings was mainly utilitarian, with only the imports providing a finer ware that reached a total of ca. 12% of the entire household repertoire in both houses. Even the more elaborate local vessels, such as goblets, painted biconical jugs or storage jars, were not meticulous works of art, in keeping with the generally modest quality of LB pottery. The objects other than pottery in both houses were for the most part not luxury items but reflect activities such as food preparation and crafts such as spinning. Building 315 contained a number of special objects that must have been valued personal property; the scarabs and seals in Building 315 may have a commercial or administrative purpose, while the bronze sheet figurines and cymbals in this building may have cultic or apotropaic affinities. The wealth of a household can also be measured according to the quantity of vessels that it contains. However, here too alternative explanations may be offered, such as the difference between potting and non-potting households, variable distances to markets, stockpiling for an emergency, a dowry or for use in feasting or rituals, as well as gift-giving and the relationship to other household subsistence strategies such as dairy or olive oil production (Kramer 1979; DeBoer and Lathrop 1979; Rice 1987; Geva 1989; Arnold 1991: 61-72; Deal 1998). As detailed above, we were unable to clearly discern specific activity areas based on the distribution of the finds (with the possible exception of the stairwell in the Str. VII Building 315, which yielded vessels containing grain and almonds in situ). This might be due to the disruption of the destruction and its aftermath, as well as subsequent construction and erosion. Alternatively, if we theorize that the excavation revealed a frozen picture of everyday life that was suddenly struck by destruction, the lack of patterning of the finds may perhaps reflect typical household dynamics of food preparation, serving and storage, wherein vessels were moved around and placed in different locations according to need. Though the concept of a mono- functional activity area is basically valid, ethnographic examples clearly demonstrate that activities do move from area to area and a space can be used (temporarily) for alternative functions (Daviau 1993: 30). No clear traces of preparation, either architectural or artifactual, for imminent siege or attack could be discerned in the remains of both houses, apart from the possibility that the large number of vessels represents stockpiling in anticipation of such an eventuality. It seems that the destruction was a relatively sudden event, especially in Building 315 ( Timnah 1 : 173, 175). Comparison of the proportion of vessel classes (see Table 46), as well as the degree of typological variety (see Table 50), in each household reveals a basic similarity, though with several differences. One parameter of continuity is the relatively constant typological diversity in both households, with many more (5 and 7) bowl types represented than types of other vessel classes. This might be the result of similar supply and consumer patterns, as well as comparable needs or functions of serving and eating. Differences in numerical proportions of vessel types between Arad and 'Ai have been understood as reflecting not only different ecologies, but also cultural distinctions between the two sites (Ilan 2001: 350). Since the assemblages of our two houses show similar proportions of vessel types, this may be an indication of cultural continuity. A trend noted in several vessel classes (cooking pots, jugs, imports) is that though the absolute number of vessels declines in the Str. VII household, the percentage of the class in the entire assemblage remains similar (see Table 46). For example, the 25 jugs found in the Str. VIII house comprised 14% of the assemblage, while half that amount (13 jugs) comprised 13% of the Str. VII house's assemblage. Another example is cooking pots: in Str. VIII there were 28 complete cooking pots (16% of the assemblage) and only 12 in Str. VII; however, in the latter house, these 12 pots comprised 12% of the assemblage, which is relatively similar to the percentage in Str. VIII. However, the capacity range of cooking pots in Str. VIII was very large, while in Str. VII it was more restricted. It is difficult to ascertain the cause of this difference. It 191</page><page sequence="201">CHAPTER FOUR is possible that some of the cooking pots were used for the production of commodities other than food, such as beer (Daviau 1993: 445). Cooking pot capacity can reflect many factors, such as the kind of cuisine and the manner in which it is prepared, as well as household size and/or wealth. It can also reflect household or supra- household feasting. Ethnographic studies have shown that cooking pot capacity can, in fact, be a statistically significant indication of household size (Arnold 1991: 63; Tani 1991; Mills 1999). Kraters were relatively few in Building 475, perhaps suggesting that some food preparation was carried out in cooking pots. This might partially explain their presence inside the house despite the distance from the cooking area in the front courtyard, though of course utensils not made of pottery could have been used for food preparation as well. There are differences between strata in the representation of kraters (2% in Building 475 as opposed to 6% in Building 315); this might be related to different food preparation and serving practices, as noted above. Comparison of the storage jars in each building reveals a different pattern and a more marked change between the two households in absolute numbers, proportions and capacities. The 40 jars in Building 475 comprise 23% of the corpus, while the 15 jars in Building 315 comprise only 15% of that assemblage (though it may be noted that the amount of painted storage jars in both buildings remained constant: seven in Building 475 and six in Building 315). The minimum storage capacity was calculated as ca. 964 liters for Building 475 and ca. 229 liters for Building 315. Although the figures are estimates, this is a major difference in the quantities of commodities like grain or oil available to each household: the Str. VIII house held four times as much as the Str. VII house. Though of course there could have been alternative means of storage in this house that were not recognized in the archaeological record (such as woven sacks), the large decrease in storage capacity in Str. VII is intriguing. Schloen (2001: 144) quotes ethnographic studies pointing to an estimated requirement for an ancient Near Eastern household consisting of ca. 10 persons (see below) of as much as 2500-3500 kg a year of grain, not to mention oil, wine or other commodities. Various studies cite an average volume of ca. 1.5 liters jar capacity for each kilogram of dry grain (wheat or barley); thus, such a household would require 1666-2333 liters of storage capacity per year to contain their needs (Schloen 2001: 144, n. 143). Even taking into account other storage receptacles that might have been in use, this is much greater than the figure calculated for the Tel Batash Str. VIII-VII houses. Schloen (2001: 144-145) notes the salient point of taxes or "rent" that must have been allocated to or commandeered by the town's ruler from the household's grain and oil supply, over and above the household's need to store grain for animal feed and for seeding. This would have required the storage of larger amounts than the immediate consumer needs of the household and might explain the discrepancies, though alternative reasons, such as household size and composition, may be suggested. The above discussion of household storage capacity is based on the figure of 10 persons per household, though of course different figures have been reached for different periods and places. The criterion of 10 sq m of floor area per person as proposed by Narrol (1962) would yield, based on the net floor space of each house, 8 people in Str. VIII and 10 people in Str. VII. If we assume that an upper floor covered the entire lower floor, this figure could potentially be as much as doubled, though this is doubtful; ethnographic examples indicate that a second story is usually irrelevant in population estimates (Kramer 1979). Schloen (2001: 147-148), assuming that the Canaanite household may be compared to that of the Iron Age, defines a more flexible habitation pattern, in which nuclear families of ca. 5 members may inhabit a house that is physically or symbolically a part of an extended joint household or clan. The household may also contain other relatives and servants and the number of occupants shifts with the various stages of the "household life cycle" of births, deaths and marriages. Thus, the amount of inhabitants may fluctuate and nuclear-family households can live side by side with joint-family households. Using data from the final LB stratum at Ugarit, Schloen calculated an average figure of 8.6 persons. An additional factor to be considered is the degree of urbanization: while a figure of 10 sq m per person might be valid in a less densely occupied village or town, this number may decrease to 5-7 sq m per person in a denser urban setting. In such a case, the density calculated for Ugarit, for example, increased to 10.7 per household (Schloen 2001: 168-169, 171, 329). Thus, an estimate of the number of inhabitants of our Str. VIII and VII houses is difficult to obtain, since only these isolated houses were excavated and the overall occupation density in the town during Str. VIII and VII is unknown. What is sorely lacking is comparative data from other houses, at both our site and others. Various population estimates have been proposed for the Iron Age II town at Tel Batash, based on the different population density coefficients proposed by Shiloh, Broshi and 192</page><page sequence="202">DISTRIBUTION OF FINDS, ACTIVITY AREAS AND POPULATION ESTIMATES Gophna, and Narrol: these range between 3.5-4.4 persons per house and 460-575 for the town, 7.1 per house and 920 for the town, and 8. 1 per house and 1053 for the town {Jimnah I: 259-260). It should be borne in mind that since excavation in Area A revealed LB occupation on the slopes as well, the occupation density may well have been higher {Jimnah /: 24-26). An additional difference between the two households is that the inhabitants of Str. VII Building 315 possessed more luxury personal items. However, as mentioned above, this might be due to the Str. VIII inhabitants having evacuated their personal belongings before the destruction. Thus, we are unable to conclude that the inhabitants of Building 315 were wealthier or had greater access to luxury items than their predecessors. Since the percentage of imports in each building remained the same, it seems that the availability of imports and the ability of the inhabitants to purchase them were similar in both periods. A major issue that emerges from both the material culture finds and the different architectural plan of both houses is the degree of population continuity between the two strata. This is especially interesting in light of the severe destruction that separates the two buildings. The main question is whether there was a population shift or whether the descendants of the same family continued to inhabit this house. And if the latter is the case, what are the reasons for the changes that did take place between the two households? As noted above, Schloen (2001: 135-136) contends that while the basic unit occupying the houses in the LB and Iron Age alike in the ancient Near East was indeed the extended family or the "patriarchal joint household", this unit was not monolithic and was affected by numerous factors of the "household life cycle" (i.e. mortality and fertility rates, marriage patterns, etc.), which in turn affected the space requirements and size of both houses and households. Thus, even if the same family occupied both houses in Str. VIII and VII, which was most likely the case, changing internal (familial) and external (social, political and economic) conditions may have affected the house plan and size, as well as the nature of the household inventory. The continuity that was noted may be the result of the kinship relationship that remained among the houses' occupants, as well as a basic Canaanite cultural continuity that flavored the entire LB. The changes that took place could be the result of diverse factors, such as technology (different storage practices, changes in ceramic and craft production), economy and politics (status or role of the family in the larger community, administrative control by external factors, such as Egyptian governors, easier access to consumer goods such as imports), stylistic influence (regional or foreign architectural styles; see more below). For example, while the larger net floor space in Str. VII may indicate an increase in the number of inhabitants, it might be due to changes in the internal makeup or personal needs of the extended family unit as well. On the other hand, the smaller outer dimensions of the house in Str. VII might be related to external forces, such as increasing density in the town on the whole that required re-planning (Ilan 2001 : 323). Another possible explanation for the change in plan is influence from contemporary architectural styles, such as the Western Building at Taanach, the Herrenhaus of Beth-Shemesh, the so-called "Canaanite Castle" at Gezer and pillared buildings from Tel Harassim (Jimnah I: 252-253 and references there). A building attributed to Str. C at Tell Beit Mirsim is quite similar to our Building 475 as well (JBM II: 63-64, PL 56), and the plan of the so-called "patrician" house or "palace" of Str. E (TBM II: 35-38, PL 51, 55) may be considered for comparison. Chesson (2003) discusses the role of the physical structure of the house (and its material contents) in establishing and maintaining family status and authority within the town. The very link to ancestors and the ancestral household is a source of status and authority and is a desirable asset to be upheld; this has economic implications for the family as well (Chesson 2003: 83- 84). Thus, the rebuilding of the house on the same spot, though with changes in certain aspects of the plan, might reflect on the one hand maintenance of the family status and identity, and on the other hand changing aspects and relationships within the family itself (Chesson 2003: 91). Schloen (2001: 328) discusses how house ownership was a part of existing kinship relationships; it would apparently have been near impossible for an outsider, perhaps a villager seeking to live in the town, to obtain property or a house. Thus, our assumption is that Building 475 was rebuilt in Str. VII by the same family, though internal and external factors influenced the particular arrangement and nature of various aspects of the material culture (Str. X and IX may have been earlier phases of the same tradition). The architectural and material vitality of Building 315 is an indication of a relatively sound economy that quickly recovered from the blow dealt by the devastation, whatever its cause. Egyptian control of this economy should be assumed and, despite the security measures and often severe policies practiced by the Egyptians as they exploited the 193</page><page sequence="203">CHAPTER FOUR Canaanite vassal, it seems that the economy was stable and relatively autonomous at the local level (Mazar 1989: 65; Redford 1992: 192-213). The destruction of Building 315 at the end of Str. VII marked the end of the series of four houses that had been successively built on the same spot from Str. X to VII (only the last two have been analyzed in depth in this chapter). No house was rebuilt on this location, which subsequently remained uninhabited. The only house identified in Str. VIA was Building 442, located south of the traditional LB "patrician houses"; since it was reoccupied in Str. V, it marks the beginning of a new occupation series ( Timnah I: 72-79). A similar situation was noted at Tell Beit Mirsim, where a house dated to Str. C (LB II) was reoccupied in Str. B2 (Iron I); however, it is difficult to pinpoint the date within the LB of the Str. C house, and an interim phase (Str. B3) was noted at Tell Beit Mirsim that is lacking at Batash (TBM III: PL 2; Timnah I: 78). If our assumption that the same family occupied the Str. VIII-VII houses is valid, and if there is a meaningful relationship between house occupation and family identity (Chesson 2003), then the abandonment of the Str. VII house after its destruction should signify a sharp social break. The cessation of several key LB pottery types (BL 56, S J 2, JG 1) in Str. VI may reflect both social and economic dimensions of this break. REFERENCES Arnold, P. J. 1991. Domestic Ceramic Production and Spatial Organization. Cambridge. Chesson, M. 2003.

TYPOLOGY OF THE METAL OBJECTS Naama Yahalom-Mack The excavations of the LB and Iron I strata at Tel Batash yielded 34 metal objects. Table 55 gives details of these objects, as well as references to their illustrations in the plates and photographs. This group consisted mainly of copper-based objects, some of which were metallurgically analyzed by Sariel Shalev (Chapter V.2), and a single iron object found in an unclear context in Str. V-IV. The objects can generally be divided into weapons (including arrow/ javelin heads, spearheads and daggers), tools (including chisels and a drill point), personal items (including an earring and toggle pins), and other miscellaneous objects (cymbals and sheet figurines). Most of the objects were found in the Str. VII Building 315 (Table 56). COPPER-BASED WEAPONS Defining the weapons from Tel Batash was difficult, a reflection of the problem of weapon characterization in general and specifically in the LB and Iron I. Despite much published material and discussion, the distinctions are still being made intuitively between a large arrowhead and a javelin head, between a small spearhead and a javelin head, and between a tanged dagger and a spearhead. Such distinctions can safely be made only in regard to the weapon heads inscribed with the Hebrew word hetz identifying them as arrowheads (Mitchell 1985: 140-142), or when a certain type of weapon was found in a context that suggested its use. For example, leaf-shaped heads (less than 10 cm in length) from Hazor were found together with the spear sockets in a single jar (Drews 1993: 190 following Yadin 1963: 352). Large riveted blades found in the 'Einan tomb were positioned so as to permit room for long shafts, pointing to their use as spearheads and not as the often assumed daggers (Philip 1989: 83 following Eisenberg 1985). An additional criterion that might prove useful in defining these objects in future studies is the weight of the objects, which certainly affected their use. Thus, we may suggest that many of the blades defined as arrowheads could well have been javelin heads, and many of the objects defined as socketed spearheads may in fact have been used as javelin heads; the tanged daggers were possibly used as spearheads. ARROW/JAVELIN HEADS The typology of the arrowheads (Photo 85) follows that of Cross and Milik (1956). It is based on characteristics such as the shape of the blade, the existence of a midrib and stem, the shape of the tang and its evolvement from the stem or, in its absence, from the base of the blade. The ability to differentiate between arrowheads based on these characteristics is, nevertheless, very much dependant on their state of preservation. Many of the arrowheads were encrusted or swollen due to corrosion and some were found broken; No. 16 was so poorly preserved that we were unable to attribute it to any of the types below. The arrowheads are classified here by the shape of the blade and then subdivided according to the shape of the tang, even though the latter may be more indicative of change (Cross and Milik 1956: 18). Two main types of tang exist, square (in cross-section) and rhomboidal. The rhomboidal tang is much more common in the following group of heads and generally during the LB and Iron I. It is sometimes responsible for the creation of a stem at the base of the blade. The rhomboidal tang emerges either from that stem or from a clearly cut base. In some cases, it appears as a direct continuation of the blade. Only two of the arrowheads, from Str. IX and Str. VII, had square (in cross-section) tangs. According to Cross and Milik (1956: 1 8), the tangs with square cross-section were replaced by rhomboidal tangs during LB I. 195</page><page sequence="205">CHAPTER FIVE C/Ã Ã Â¿E? o 3 II &lt;4-1 0 &lt;L&gt; 1 a &lt;D &gt; 2 a* Â§ Å½S jo s. m m &lt;D I ? cj Ã­ Ã¼ "Åª &lt;L) &lt;+h bÃ» x: .-H â¢- CÂ« Xl O ci X) cd X&gt; cd X) O (4 Xl d X) U Å in in ri n in mmm m mmmvovovor^r-oooo ^o'0'O^^M(NM Pn 00 00 00 OO i 00 IOOOOOO IOO IOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO i IOOOOOOONONONONONON I O r-H o mO'-H es oo o ^ Â«TÃ­ Ci ^ ^ Ci TÃ­ CÃ C: CÃ *fi TÃ­ TÃ­ TÃ­ Ti^TÃTÃ^Tt^TÃ^Ã^Ãi^I TÃ­ C: Â°Â° Â°Â° C!

Most of the complete examples (Nos. 1-4) belonging to this type have blades measuring ca. 10 cm in length. Nos. 5 and 6 are broken but appear to have the same shape and dimensions as Nos. 1-4. Nos. 7 and 8 are smaller than the rest. However, while No. 7 maintains the elongated proportions, No. 8 appears to have a more rounded blade. Most of these arrowheads were found in Str. VII, five in Building 315 (Nos. 2-4, 6, 8), and one in Building 481 (No. 7). A single arrowhead (No. 1) was found in Building 475, in Str. VIH, and another one (No. 5) was found in Building 313, in Str. V. The latter is, however, broken and highly corroded, and cannot be used to determine whether this type continues into Iron I in Tel Batash. Arrowheads of this type are paralleled among the finds in the LB burials at Tell Jedur (Ben Arieh 1981: Fig. 6:8-9) and near the Persian Garden in 4 Akko (Ben Arieh and Edelstein 1977: Fig. 20:9-13). The clear-cut rhomboidal tang is also well known among arrowheads of the el-Khader hoard (Cross and Milik 1956: Fig. 2, Types AHI, AIV, AV, JII and JIII) but differ from the Batash Type 1 arrowheads in the shape of the blade. Ben Arieh and Edelstein (1977: 35) describe this type as "well known in Palestine and Egypt"; this contention is based on a few parallels from Tell el-'Ajjul, Gezer, Hazor and Tell Abu Hawam, as well as on two photographed parallels from Egypt. No. 8 is paralleled in burials at Tell Jedur (Ben- Arieh 198 1 : Fig. 6: 1 1) and in 4 Akko (Ben- Arieh and Edelstein 1977: Fig. 22:15-16) but also resembles arrowheads found in an open area southeast of the governor's residency of Str. X12 at Aphek (Yahalom-Mack and Shalev forthcoming: No. 15, Type lb). Type 2 Lanceolate blade with a midrib and a rhomboidal tang that is a direct continuation of the blade. No. 9 is the only representative of this type. It was found in Locus 356, Str. VI-V, in the transition between the LB and Iron I. This arrowhead, although swollen as a result of heavy corrosion, resembles arrowheads from Beth-Shean that are dated to Iron I (Yahalom 2002: 22, Nos. 8-13). Type 3 Oblanceolate blade: Type 3a: with a slight midrib and a square tang that continues directly from the blade. Nos. 10 and 11 belong to this type, although the slightly oblanceolate shape of No. 11 is the result of hammering rather than of the initial cast. No. 10 was found in Building 715, Str. IX. According to the metallurgical analysis by Sariel Shalev (Chapter V.2), this arrowhead is made of unalloyed copper. Its chemical composition and shape of tang correspond to its early date in the LB. Similar arrowheads were found in LB levels of Beth-Shean (Bonn et al. 1993: 210, Fig. 156:6-7), Hazor {Hazor II: CL: 11), and Kamid el-Loz (Hachmann 1980: Tafel 12: 3). No. 11 was found in Building 481, Str. VILA. It is reminiscent of an arrowhead from Tell Jedur (Ben Arieh 1981: Fig 6:16) as well as to one from Hazor Str. 2 C Hazor III-IV : Pl. CCXC: 20). Type 3b : with a rhomboidal tang that continues directly from the blade. Nos. 12 and 13 belong to this type. Both were found in Str. VII. They are paralleled with Type AI in the el-Khader hoard (Cross and Milik 1956: 19, Fig. 2,AI:1). Type 4 Linear arrowheads: Type 4a: linear arrowheads with characteristics similar to those of Type 1. No. 15 belongs to this type. It is paralleled in tombs at Tell Jedur (Ben Arieh 1981: Fig. 6:6-7) and in ' Akko (Ben Arieh and Edelstein 1977 : Fig. 20:3-8). Type 4b: a linear arrowhead (No. 14) with a semicircular midrib. It is broken at the base of the blade and therefore the full length of the blade and the shape of the tang are unknown. It is, however, very similar to 198</page><page sequence="208">THE METAL OBJECTS the "javelin heads" from a tomb in 'Akko (Ben-Arieh and Edelstein 1977: Fig. 20:3-6). SOCKETED SPEARHEADS Three spearheads (Nos. 17-19; Photo 86) were found in Str. VII. Two of them (Nos. 18-19) came from a single context in Building 315. No. 19 is broken and only the socket and the base of the blade are preserved. The break appears to have been smoothed and finished in antiquity, possibly to prepare the object for secondary use. Assuming that our identification of No. 19 as a spearhead is correct, all three appear to be of the same type, with a lanceolate blade and a slightly splayed socket with two holes for hafting. No. 19 is decorated with three fine longitudinal grooves running along the axis of the blade on both sides. While this feature is unique among the spearheads, it can be found on one of the hilted daggers from a tomb in 4 Akko, which was found along with a socketed spearhead similar to ours (Ben-Arieh and Edelstein 1977: Figs. 18:2 and 11:2 respectively). Socketed spearheads are common in the MB and continue throughout the LB (Ben-Arieh and Edelstein 1977: 34). Examples dated to LB II were found at Ugarit (Schaeffer 1956: 254-255, Fig. 224.8), in the "Mycenaean" Tomb at Tel Dan {Dan II : 121, Fig. 2.89) and Beth-Shean Level Vili (Bonn et al. 1993: 212, Fig. 158:4). In Cyprus and in the Aegean they are found in LC IA-III and LM II-IIIA1 . We may also note a parallel from Egypt (Petrie 1917: 32, PI. XL: 168-170) and socketed spearheads from Tell es-Sa'idiyeh (Pritchard 1980: Fig. 63:3). Spearheads similar to ours were found in Levels 5 and 4 at Tell Kazel in Syria, dated to the LB and Iron I (Badre and Gubel 1999-2000: Figs. 39: e, 43 :k). DAGGERS/SPEARHEADS Two large bronze blades (Photo 87) were found in the LB layers (see the metallurgical analysis by Sariel Shalev, Chapter V.2). No. 20 was found in Building 315, Str. VE. It is almost complete and slightly bent and has wide angular shoulders, a mid-rib, a blunt blade and a short strong tang. No. 21 was found in Str. VI in a poor state of preservation, broken below the tip and highly encrusted. It has slanting shoulders and a relatively long, thin tang. Similar objects are defined as daggers by Shalev (forthcoming: Type 2) but are often referred to as spearheads in the literature. Photo 86. Socketed spearheads (a: No. 17; b: No. 18; c: No. 19). Photo 87. Daggers or spearheads (a: No. 20; b: No. 21). 199</page><page sequence="209">CHAPTER FIVE These objects occur in many sites in Canaan during the second millennium (Shalev forthcoming). No. 20 is roughly paralleled at LB II Megiddo ( Megiddo II: Pl. 180:46; Megiddo Tombs : 161, PI. 120:14) and at Gezer {Gezer III: PL 216:4). No. 21 can be compared to daggers from Lachish ( Lachish IV: 78, PI. 23:3), Gezer ( Gezer III: PI. 198:6) and Megiddo, Str. VIII and VI ( Megiddo II: Pis. 179:33 and 18 1:54 respectively). COPPER-BASED TOOLS CHISELS Two chisels (Photo 88) were found in the LB strata. The first (No. 22) tapers towards a splayed perpendicular end and has a short tang, apparently inserted into a wooden or bone handle. The second (No. 23) has a rectangular, almost square, section and was apparently used without a handle (see Petrie 1 9 1 7 : 1 9 for discussion of the types). Both chisels are rather large, heavy and crude and lack exact parallels. A chisel from Level VII in Beth-Shean is generally similar to No. 23 but has a splayed head (see Bonn et al. 1993: Fig. 154:6). Another similar chisel was found in Tomb 912 B in Megiddo {Megiddo Tombs: PI. 127:7) but is presented there without a section. Photo 88. Chisels (a: No. 22; b: No. 23). DRILL POINT This is a small (ca. 3 cm long), lozenge-shaped, double- pointed object (No. 24), possibly used as a drill or awl point. It was found in the Str. VII Building 315. Due to its small size and simple shape, this type of object is rarely published. Similar objects were found at Beth-Shean in contexts of the 13th and 12th centuries (Yahalom 2002: 29, Nos. 58-59, 63), in Str. X9 at Tel Aphek (Yahalom-Mack and Shalev, forthcoming) and in Level K-5 in Megiddo. They were also found in LB levels at Kamid el-Loz (Hachmann 1980: Tafel 14: 19-20, 22). SOCKET No. 25 is a broken socket from Locus 816, Str. V that may be reconstructed as a hoe (see, for example, Late Cypriot hoes in Catling 1964: Fig. 11). It is made of copper alloyed with only 1 % Sn (tin) and 1 .5% Pb (lead) (see the metallurgical analysis by Sariel Shalev, Chapter V.2). Another socket fragment from the same locus (not included in our catalogue, but see Table 57: 17) appears to belong to the same type of tool but was made of copper alloyed with 5% Sn. COPPER-BASED PERSONAL ITEMS TOGGLE PINS Undecorated Two plain, undecorated toggle pins (Nos. 26-27, Photo 89a-b) were found in Building 313, Str. V. Since both appear to be broken at the end their entire length remains unknown, making it difficult to determine the exact position of the hole. The location of the hole closer to the pointed end than to the back is characteristic of stake toggle pins of Iron I and began during the transitional LB-Iron I period (Henschel-Simon 1938: 175, Type 11). Similar plain pins with their holes located both roughly in the center and slightly closer to the pointed end were found in an Iron I jewelry hoard at Cave II/3 in Wadi el-Makkuk (Sass 2002: 26, Fig. 8:53-54). Decorated No. 28 (Photo 89c) is a fragment of a ribbed nail-shaped toggle pin with a flat head (Henschel-Simon 1938: 199, Type 8c), also uncovered in Str. V. Only the upper part of the pin was preserved and it is therefore unknown 200</page><page sequence="210">THE METAL OBJECTS Photo 89. Toggle pins (a: No. 26; b: No. 27; c: No. 28). whether the ribbing extended below the eyelet. This type is especially well known in MB burials, but is also found in LB II-Iron I burial caves in the Baq'ah Valley in central Transjordan (McGovern 1986: 249, Figs. 81:17, 86:32). EARRING No. 29 (Photo 90) is a poorly preserved earring from Building 715, Str. IX. It comprises a plain hoop with a tapering pendant, now swollen as a result of corrosion. Photo 90. Copper-based earring (No. 29). MISCELLANEOUS COPPER-BASED OBJECTS CYMBALS A pair of "finger cymbals" (No. 30a-b, Photo 91) was found in Building 315, Str. VII. No. 30a is complete and relatively well preserved, while No. 30b is broken and highly corroded. Though both are now distorted, it is clear that initially they were oval, convex at the center and flat around the edges, with a small perforation (0.4 cm in diameter) near the center of the convex part. Cymbals of this type are well known in various LB and Iron I contexts; for previous discussions see Mevorakh II: 23; Braun 2002: 107-110. SHEET FIGURINES Two metal sheet figurines (Nos. 31 and 32) were found in Building 315, Str. VII, and another one (No. 33) was found in Building 481, Str. VII (Photo 92). No. 32 is heavily corroded and no details are preserved. It is generally pear-shaped and thus could belong either to Negbi's "Syrian-representational" Group, examples of which were found at Ugarit in hoards of Niveau I, dated from the mid- 15th to late 14th century BCE, and at Tell Nebi Mend, dated to the 14th-13th century BCE (Negbi 1976: 96-97, Figs. 108-110), or to the "Palestinian-representational" Group (see below). The other two sheet figurines (Nos. 31 and 33) are both dagger-shaped. They may be included in Negbi's "Palestinian-representational" Group, which includes figurines with schematized bodies in which the arms and legs are not indicated, anatomical features are barely distinguishable, and high headgear is usually worn, and in which suspension Photo 91. Cymbals (No. 30a-b). 201</page><page sequence="211">CHAPTER FIVE Photo 92. Metal sheet figurines (a: No. 31; b: No. 32; c: No. 33). loops are consistently missing (Negbi 1976: 97, Figs. 111-113). Of the Tel Batash specimens, No. 33 is the best preserved. It has some details worked in repoussÃ©, including dotted breasts and eyes and a vertical line representing the nose. Horizontal lines that run across the eyes represent either a pair of eyebrows or the beginning of headgear. Parallel lines running below the waist possibly depict clothing separating the upper body from the lower one. Figurines of this type are found in LB levels at Hazor, Beth-Shean, Megiddo, Gezer and Tell el- 'Ajjul (Negbi 1976). It appears, however, that Negbi 's "Palestinian-representational" Group is best attested in LB levels of Syrian sites such as Tell Kazel and Kamid el-Loz, where figurines of this type were found in large concentrations (Badre and Gubel 1999-2000: 1 36ff , Fig. 1 2 (in the courtyard of Level 6, dated to the LB II); Hachmann 1980: Pis. 15-16). No. 33 is best paralleled to a metal sheet figurine from Kamid el-Loz (Hachmann 1980: Tafel 15:1; Hachman 1982: PI. 10:8). The general form of our No. 32 can be found among the sheet figurines from Tell Kazel and Kamid el-Loz (Badre and Gubel: Fig. 19:f-g and Hachmann 1980: Tafel 15:4-9 respectively). IRON OBJECT SICKLE BLADE No. 34 is an iron sickle blade. It was found in an unclear context related to Str. V-IV. Thus our object can be dated either to Iron I or to Iron IIA. Two other sickle blades were found in Str. II of the 7th century BCE and another one was found in Str. I, dated to the Persian period {Jimnah IL 218-220). Iron sickle blades are common throughout Iron II but begin to appear in Iron I (Waldbaum 1978: 25). This conclusion was based on a single sickle blade from Str. III at Beth-Shemesh (Ain Shems IV: PL LIII:56). However, another iron sickle blade from Iron I is now known; it was found in Str. XVII at Tel Yoqne'am, dated to the 11th century BCE (Yahalom-Mack and Shalev 2005). SUMMARY Most of the metal objects were found in the Str. VII Building 315. Many of these, such as the arrow/javelin heads of Types 1 and 4, the socketed spearheads and the cymbals can be closely paralleled among the metal finds of the tombs at Tell Jedur and in 'Akko. These tombs were dated to the same period as our date for Str. VII, the 14th century. Several objects, including the socketed spearheads and especially the sheet figurines, can also be paralleled further north at Syrian LB sites. The latter were found in extremely large amounts at Kamid el-Loz and Tell Kazel, which were possibly manufacturing centers for these figurines. Objects such as cymbals and working tools have a long life span and do not have a limited spatial or temporal distribution. It is interesting that one dagger was found in Str. VII and another in Str. VIB, in light of the assumed gap between these strata (see above, p. 134). Toggle pins were found only in the Iron I Str. V, although the ridged example is typologically much earlier and could be intrusive. The metal objects found at Tel Batash represent the entire gamut of human activity at the site, from weapons and tools to clothing and cult. This diversity, together with the secure stratigraphie context of most of the objects, makes these finds an important contribution to what we know about metal objects during the LB and Iron I. 202</page><page sequence="212">THE METAL OBJECTS REFERENCES Badre, L. and Gubel, E. 1999-2000.

METALLURGICAL STUDY OF THE METAL OBJECTS* Sariel Shalev This chapter presents an overview of technological aspects of metal objects from Tel Batash. The objects represent a variety of forms and functions; they include working tools, weapons and jewelry dated to the Late Bronze and Iron Ages. The metal objects were examined by the author in the Department of Materials, Oxford University, with the aim of examining production methods and raw materials. The analytical data will be used as a basis for studying the variability in composition and production methods of metal objects in the above-mentioned periods, as part of a wider view of the reconstruction of the metal industry of ancient Palestine. METHODS OF RESEARCH Twenty-six samples were removed from items uncovered in Str. XI-n of Tel Batash, dated from the LB to Iron II. All underwent metallurgical and metallographical analyses. The samples were cut using a jeweler's piercing saw or drilled using a 0.5 mm drill. The method of sampling was chosen according to the shape, the size and the degree of preservation of the objects with the intention of minimizing, as far as possible, damage to the artifacts. The samples were hot mounted in acrylic resin mixed with copper powder, grounded and polished. The surface of the polished sample was etched for the metallographical analysis in the standard procedure (see Scott 1991: 72). Metallography was conducted with an optical inverted metallurgical microscope, with magnification of up to 1000 (Photo 93). The metal was examined through the optical microscope, identifying the structure and inclusions. Micro-segregation was located as well as micro-structural changes caused by thermal and mechanical treatments of hammering and annealing following the cast. Micro-hardness tests, measuring the resistance of the metal sample to indentation, were performed using a Vickers diamond pyramid tester. The chemical analysis was performed by detecting the spectra and the intensity of the emitted X-ray photons during excitation of the sample surface with a high- energy (20kv) electron beam. The elemental analysis (with a detection limit of ca. 0.02wt%) was conducted * This report was submitted in May 1993 and revised for publication in August 2002. on a JEOL JXA 8800R electron micro-probe in the Dept. of Materials, University of Oxford, UK, using a wavelength dispersive spectrometer (WDS). Technical information and sensitivity rates of different elements were as specified in Shalev and Northover 1993: 46. Micro-harness testing was conducted only on remains of solid metal and was not carried out on corroded and drilled samples. Table 57 specifies the objects examined. Table 58 presents the results of the metallurgical analysis. The quantitative data comprise the relative concentration of each element, based on its atomic weight (Wt%). The results are the average of at least three analyses, ca. 25 |Lim each, from different areas of the sample. Table 59 presents the changes in the metal composition due to corrosion, and Table 60 characterizes the crystal structure of the metal artifacts. DISCUSSION The objects found at Tel Batash represent a segment of the general history of metal products and production during the LB and Iron Age in Israel. The following is a discussion of the typological and metallurgical aspects of these finds and the meaning of the combined archaeological and metallurgical data. All the metal objects analyzed are made of copper alloyed with varying amounts of tin with some other impurities, mainly of arsenic, lead and iron. All the objects discussed here underwent, following their cast, cycles of mechanical and thermal treatments. This process of hammering and annealing gave the products their final form and mechanical properties. The level of hardness and the degree of crystal distortion is in direct accordance with the intensity of hammering invested in them since they were last annealed. In the course of about one millennium, from the beginning of the LB to the end of the Iron Age, as will be demonstrated below, metal objects were continuously produced by a similar method and from similar compositions of copper and copper alloys. Nevertheless, the results of the chemical and metallographic analyses reveal several differences that could reflect socio- economic changes. The following is a specification of those changes, as indicated by both the composition and the manufacturing process of the artifacts. 204</page><page sequence="214">THE METAL OBJECTS Photo 93.

CHANGES IN CHEMICAL COMPOSITION A. The relative amount of tin (Sn) in the alloy varies considerbly. The results of the chemical analysis (Table 58) indicate a broad use of tin-bronze, especially in items produced in LB II. This level is maintained during Iron I. The minimal amount of tin observed in the metal remains from this period is no less than 0.9%, and can sometimes reach 8% and more. The amount of tin detected in LB II arrowheads is greater than that found in an arrowhead from the beginning of the period (LB I). The latter is composed only of a trace of 0.2%. The amount of tin detected in artifacts from LB II and Iron I accords with the archaeometallurgical knowledge accumulated so far, concerning the chemical composition of various metal artifacts found in the eastern Mediterranean (for detailed discussion and 205</page><page sequence="215">CHAPTER FIVE Table 57.

Interestingly, the same conclusions were also drawn from the analysis of the remains of the local copper-base industry at Tel Dan and the metal artifacts found at the site (Shalev 1993). The majority of the metal artifacts from the Iron I strata at Tel Dan were comprised of similar amounts of tin (1.2%-11%). An arrowhead dated to Iron I was produced from bronze containing 2.8% tin, whereas another arrowhead and pin, apparently dated to LB I, were produced from arsenical copper with an amount of tin not exceeding 0.3%. The daggers from Tel Batash are related to a local type with a narrow haft and a wide blade. Their chemical composition corresponds, in tin levels as well as in the amounts of arsenic, to the composition of 45 daggers from Late Bronze and Early Iron Age Palestine that were recently analyzed (Shalev forthcoming). B. Aside from the tin and arsenic, other elements detected in the artifacts from Tel Batash were measured in the level of impurity. Table 59 demonstrates the degree of change in the relative amount of the metal components that occurred as a result of a corrosion process, and changes in the composition of different areas of corrosion in the same artifact. It is clearly demonstrated in Table 59 that the relative quantity of elements in the original 206</page><page sequence="216">THE METAL OBJECTS Table 58. Results of metallurgical analysis.

This comparative analysis demonstrates how misleading a quantitative analysis can be when based on samples taken from, or even including, invisible particles of corroded metal (see, for example, amounts of tin and lead in analysis of corrosion in metal artifacts from Tel Michal; Lupu 1989: 304-313, especially Item No. 4881/63 on p. 308; and the results of the analysis of similar data in Waldbaum 1989: 113). The quantitative discussion here is, therefore, based solemnly on analyses of solid metal remains, as specified in Table 58. The following is a detailed analysis of the trace elements and impurities, as detected in the metal remains: 1. Copper sulphides can be seen in the form of inclusions distributed in the metal mass. The sulphides were not intentionally added and could derive from the original copper ore extraction process or relate to the intentional or unintentional addition of lead in the bronze melt. We can detect a change in the amount of sulphides between LB II, in which their relative amount reached up to half a percent, and Iron I- II, in which a relatively low level of sulphides (not exceeding 0. 15%) was maintained. This could be an indication of recycling in the Iron 207</page><page sequence="217">CHAPTER FIVE Table 59. Changes in metal composition due to corrosion.

Age to a higher extent than in the previous period, in which metal was closer to the original raw material, possibly due to use of ingots produced from copper and tin ores. 2. Lead, like sulphides, segregates in the metal solid solution and remains concentrated in the form of inclusions. Table 58 indicates the gradual increase in the amount of lead from the LB, not exceeding 0.25%, to the Iron Age, in which artifacts containing lead in an amount of 1.5% and more were found. The relative increase in the amount of lead could also indicate the above-mentioned increase in metal recycling during the Iron Age. 3. A similar picture emerges from the changes in the 208 relative amount of silver, which rises from 0.03% in the LB and 0.04% in Iron I to 0.08% in Iron II. This change, together with the rest of the data, points to a possible increase in metal recycling during the Iron Age, resulting in higher concentrations of unburnt silver from several melting sickles or caused by an unintentional addition of a corroded silver piece in the process of the scrap remelting. 4. Nickel, although existing in very small concentrations, reflects a change as well. The level of nickel increases from a maximum amount of 0.02% in LB I to 0.06% in LB II. This is also true for cobalt, which increases from a maximum amount of 0.03% in LB II to 0.07% in Iron II.</page><page sequence="218">THE METAL OBJECTS Table 60.

The lack of unity in arsenic amounts in each of these periods may be an effect not only of the quality of the material, but also of the limited sensitivity of arsenic detection (as specified in Shalev and Northover 1993: 46). Despite these limitations, the results show a relative increase in arsenic that strengthens the hypothesis of increasing recycling of metal in the Iron Age. Notably, this conclusion does not correspond with the data acquired from the analyses of some of the metal artifacts from Middle Bronze Age Kabri (Shalev 1989) and from Iron I Dan (Shalev 1993). The results from Tel Batash indicating relative change could possibly, therefore, be coincidental. 6. Iron is the only element that remains unchanged over the periods in its relative amount, which varies up to 0.7% in each of the periods. 209</page><page sequence="219">CHAPTER FIVE 2. CHANGES IN PRODUCTION METHODS All the analyzed metal artifacts, without exceptions, were produced in a similar technique (Table 60). They were cast in a mold made of stone or clay and later hammered and annealed at a temperature no lower than 550Â°C for at least an hour and a half for full homogenization of the metal. After several cycles of hammering and annealing (for at least 50 min. at no less than 550Â°C), the final hammering can be seen, done in order to obtain a maximum hardness of up to 200HV. The deformation of the relatively soft sulphide and lead inclusions in the metal demonstrates a maximum reduction of 85% from the original thickness of the cast, caused by the mechnical and thermal treatment of the object after casting. The degree of the final cold working of these objects was determined from visible slip-traces in the crystal lattice, the presence and level of crystal deformation, and comparison of the composition and hardness. The conclusions were then compared with the ones achieved by Buchwald and Leisner (1992: 66-73). Remains of microsegregation (coring) in some cases demonstrated a partial homogenization of the metal, meaning that the temperature and the annealing time were inadequate. Despite the uniform technology used for the manufacture of these objects, several unique characteristics can be related to various groups of objects of defined periods. 1. The characteristics of the inclusions presented in Table 59 could represent differences in melting and casting methods between the LB and Iron Age. During the LB, melting and casting were conducted under reducing conditions, i.e. permanent coverage of the metal with charcoal during melting, deoxidizing the melt in the crucible, and casting into a mold that was apparently covered. These precautions prevented the oxidation of the molten copper during the process of melting and casting. Nevertheless, during the Iron Age it appears that less attention was paid to controlling the reducing atmosphere during melting and casting, resulting in higher levels of oxidation. This reduced care during metal production processes is metallographically evident in the present of copper oxide and/or tin oxide inclusions in the metal. 2. The chemical composition of the metal, as detected in the analysis specified above, created during solidification a complex multi-phase dendritic structure (Brooks 1982: 275-285, 305-311). The original casting conditions caused this unhomogeneous microstructure, in which the solidifying process occurred in a relatively rapid mode rather than in a 210 slow, gradual, controlled and unified manner (Scott 1991 : Figs. 198-202, 212). As a result, a brittle metal was created that had to be heated after the cast or immediately following the initial hammering, in order to homogenize its structure. From Table 59 it is clear that during the LB and Iron I the objects were heated to a temperature exceeding 550Â°C and for an adequate time depending on the relative volume of the cast. In doing so the smiths of that time achieved a complete homogenization of the cast. In contrast, during Iron II it appears that less attention was paid to the temperature and time needed for achieving this full homogenization. This fact is reflected in remaining casting phases and various concentrations, still seen as coring in the microstructure, created as a result of inadequate post-casting heating and hammering processes. 3 . Further data that may indicate a change in the process of metal working during the Iron Age have to do with the final cold working of the copper-based objects. The correlation between the level of hardness and the composition of the metal indicates that the object from Iron II were hammered to a lesser degree. In the objects from this period, in contrast to the objects from the LB and Iron I, slip-traces were not detected. Although together with the two factors mentioned above this may indicate a decrease in the level of production, it might also reflect the fact that the objects from Iron II have no blade and thus by definition would have required less hardening. CONCLUSIONS Over a period of roughly a millennium, from the beginning of the LB and until the end of the Iron Age, a continuing use of metal objects of a similar composition and technology is indicated by the metal finds at Tel Batash. All the analyzed metal objects were produced of copper with the addition of tin in various amounts and with impurities especially of arsenic, lead and iron. Without exception they were produced in a similar technique. They were cast in a stone or clay mold and then homogenized by heating to a temperature of no less than 550Â°C for a time appropriate to the size and volume of the cast, followed by several cycles of mechanical and thermal treatment. This processing by hammering and annealing was what gave these objects their final form and working properties. Despite the uniform technology that was used in the</page><page sequence="220">THE METAL OBJECTS manufacture of these artifacts, several characteristics are unique to specific groups of objects from specific periods of time. The changes discerned in the raw material and the production process may be coincidental but may also reflect socio-political changes, which are not necessarily local. Based on the findings from Tel Batash, the use of bronze reached its peak during the LB and Iron I. During the LB II and Iron I the level of tin as alloy in most samples (13 out of the 19 analyzed: Nos. 7-15 for LB II and 17-20 for Iron I) is relatively high and varies from a minimum of 5% Sn to a maximum of 15% Sn. We may therefore conclude that the raw material for the production of most of the bronze objects was more carefully selected and controlled in the LB II and Iron I, in comparison to the LB I and Iron II. All four analyses of Iron II (Nos. 21-24) show a significant decrease in the relative amounts of tin, not exceeding 4% Sn. Currently, the number of Iron II analyses is too small for the drawing of definite conclusions. However, the relative decrease in the amount of sulphides during the Iron Age, together with the increase of impurities, may indicate increased use of recycled metal artifacts as opposed to copper and tin ingots. In addition to the identified decrease in use of high- quality raw material, there was also a decrease in the quality of the production process. From the beginning of the Iron Age, reduction was less closely monitored, i.e. the prevention of oxidation that was carried out by the LB smiths was no longer practiced. In the Iron Age the objects were still heated after casting, but for shorter durations and at a lower temperature. This change is seen in the partial homogenization of some of the artifacts. The final hammering that was carried out to a lesser extent can be related to the general technological decrease but may also be related to the types of objects in question. In summary, the general archaeometallurgical picture that emerges from the analysis of the metal objects from Tel Batash demonstrates a better controlled bronze industry during LB II and a possible decrease in the quality of raw material and production methods of bronze and other copper-based objects in Iron II. As detailed above, more analyses of a bigger selection of Iron II metals are needed. At this stage only this local picture can be established as a basis for a wider examination of the more general process that the copper industry underwent at the time. Further study of data from other sites may clarify whether the data from Tel Batash are relevant only to the local picture of the site history, or represent a wider and more general process. This may also clarify the fundamental question of whether this technological decline of the bronze industry had to do with the increasing appearance of iron objects in Iron II. REFERENCES Brooks, C.

X-V at Tel Batash. The first ten came from Str. X-VI in Area B, while the eleventh derives from Str. V in Area C. An attempt has been made to list as many as possible of the excavated parallels from Canaanite and Egyptian/Nubian sites as a basis for future studies. Where earlier discussions of specific issues by other scholars are available, we have related to these in order to avoid repetition. Parallels from collections are cited only when they are essential to the discussion. An attempt has been made to standardize the vocabulary and terminology employed in the description of similar elements, features, etc. GENERAL NOTES In order to avoid repetition, the following notes, mainly of technical nature, pertaining to many of the scarabs presented below are presented under the headings used in the descriptions of the individual items. Material Glazed Steatite. All eight of the steatite seals are glazed.1 In some cases the glaze has survived in its entirety and is discernible even in the perforation. However, in other cases, due to depositional conditions, the glaze I wish to thank Amihai Mazar for inviting me to study and publish these finds. Under my guidance, Gabi Laron and Mariana Salzberger photographed the objects and Sarah Halbreich and Carmen Hersch, each in her own style, drew them. has survived mainly in the incisions of the designs on the bases and on the sides, and on the flat areas on the beetles' heads. The original colors of the glaze, which were most probably blue or green, have faded to white, yellowish, purple or grayish.2 Dimensions The four main dimensions given in this publication are: H = height, L = length, T = thickness, W = width. Technical Details " Firing Marks One scarab has a different-colored strip along the ridge on its back.3 This may well be the result of the glazing process, in which the scarabs were placed on their backs during firing in order to achieve optimal results on the decorated bases. Scarab/Seal Shape There are two main classification systems or typologies that relate to the details of the shape of MB scarabs,4 the first published by Alan Rowe (1936: Pis. 32-35 = Keel 1995: Ills. 44, 46, 67) and the second by Olga Tufnell (1984: 31-38, Figs. 12-14 = Keel 1995: Ills. 45, 49, 69). 5 Neither is sufficiently accurate6 and there is a noticeable discrepancy between their identifications. Regarding the LB scarabs and seals, we refer to three works. The general classification follows that provided by Rowe (1936). For the classification of the bifacial seals we refer to that of Keel (1995: 84-86, 89-93). Reference is also made to the types defined by Hall for the royal scarabs in the British Museum (Hall 1913: xxix-xxxv). Base Design Throughout this paper, all the Egyptian hieroglyphic signs are referred to in square brackets, as they are in the Sign-List of Gardiner (1973). 213</page><page sequence="222">CHAPTER SIX Typology The MB design scarabs are described according to Tufnell's Design Classification7 with some later modifications made by Keel.8 Origin An attempt has been made here to determine whether the seals were imported (from Egypt) or locally made. Daphna Ben-Tor has recently and convincingly showed that most of the early MB design scarabs found in Canaan are local products (her "early Palestinian scarab series"), as are the later MB ones (her "late Palestinian series") (Ben-Tor 1997; 1998). While I fully agree with Ben-Tor's observation on the origins of these two groups, I suggest alternative terms for them, since imitations of Egyptian scarabs were also locally produced in Canaan during the LB and later. I thus propose the terms "early Middle Bronze Canaanite scarabs" (EMBCS) and "late Middle Bronze Canaanite scarabs" (LMBCS) for her two series. Date The factors used for dating are the shape of the scarab or seal, the accuracy of execution of the hieroglyphic signs, the carving style, the royal names and parallels originating in controlled excavations. My proposed dating of Ben-Tor's "early Palestinian scarab series" (my EMBCS) is 30 years lower than hers.9 I suggest the following dates: EMBCS: early MB IIB or 1680-1650 BCE according to Bietak's low chronology (= Tell el-Dab'a E/3); LMBCS: late MB HB-HC or 1650-1530 BCE, with a division between early LMBCS, 1650-1590 BCE (= Tell el-Dab'a E/2 and E/l), and late LMBCS, 1590-1530 BCE (= Tell el-Dab'a D/3 and D/2).

Rowe: HC 24, EP 5, Side 13; Tufnell: B2-0-e9.10 Base Design. In a vertical oval that serves as a frame are depicted eight hieroglyphic signs in three segments. At the top is hc "hill of the sunrise" [N 28]. 11 Below are two separate zones. The right zone is occupied by a huge, diagonal dÅ¡rt "The Red Crown of Lower Egypt" [S 3], 12 with nfr "good" [F 35] 13 in front of it and s3 "protection" [V 18] 14 inside. The left zone is made up of a column of four hieroglyphic signs: at the top is srt "thorn" or spd "sharp" [M 44], below it are r [D 21]15 and a horizontal hm "majesty" [U 36] 16 or s3 "protection", and at the bottom is nb "all" or "lord" [V 30].17 This combination of hieroglyphic signs is meaningless and its purpose seems to be purely decorative. Typology. Design scarab. The scarab belongs to Tufnell's design class 3 A3, "Egyptian Signs and Symbols, Varia" 214</page><page sequence="223">CANAANITE AND EGYPTIAN SEALS AND SEALINGS (see Tufnell 1984: Pis. 8-8b). More specifically, it belongs to a small group in which one hieroglyph is central and dominant.18 Such scarabs have been found in several sites in Canaan, which include: â¢ Tell el-'Ajjul: a) with a huge falcon wearing the shmty "Double Crown" [S 5] 19 (Petrie 1931: 7, PL 14:93 = Rowe 1936: No. 214 = Tufnell 1984: Pis. 9:1464, 16:1747, 50:2935 = Keel 1997: 132-133 [Tell el-cAgul No. 87]); b) with dsn "Red Crown of Lower Egypt" [S 3]20 on top of nbw "gold" [S 12]21 (Petrie 1933: 4, Pl. 3:29 = Tufnell 1984: Pl. 15: 1686 = Giveon 1985: 72-73 [No. 35] = Keel 1997: 238-239 [Tell el-cAgul No. 399]). â¢ Hazor: with a huge dsrt "Red Crown of Lower Egypt" [S 3]22 (Yadin et al. 1956: PL 118:30 = Tufnell 1984: 57, Fig. 17:30). â¢ Megiddo Tomb 3080: with a huge falcon (Loud 1948: Pl. 150:69, 72 = Tufnell 1973: 72, Fig. 2:57-58). â¢ Jericho: with a huge uraeus wearing the "Red Crown of Lower Egypt" (Kirkbride 1965: Fig. 302:18 = Tufnell 1984: Pl. 16:1700). In Egypt a scarab of this type with a huge falcon and a "Red Crown of Lower Egypt" (Griffith 1890: Pl. 19:8), most probably an import from Canaan, was found at Khataneh. One such scaraboid, with a huge falcon and Å¡wty 'Two-plumed Crown" [S 9]23 (Hornung and Staehelin 1976: No. 181), is in a private collection in Switzerland. Origin : Canaanite. The dominant hieroglyph is clearly a non-Egyptian element, typical of both the EMBCS and the LMBCS groups. Likewise, the use of a meaningless collection of hieroglyphic signs points to the same origin. Date : On the basis of its shape features (see above, Scarab Shape), as well as the huge dÅ¡rt sign resembling the one depicted on the Hazor scarab (see parallels above), it seems that the scarab belongs to the EMBCS group, dating from the beginning of MB IIB (1680-1650 BCE).24 Archaeological Context. Locus 717 in Building 720 is a segment of Str. Xcobblestone floor built on top of the Str. XI citadel and sealed by Floor 7 14 of Str. IX (Mazar 1997: 42- 43, 45, 85, P/S 10 and 27). Str. X is dated by the excavators to the LB IA, second half of the 16th to early 15th centuries (above, p. XIV, Stratigraphie Table). On the basis of the chronology suggested above, the scarab probably predates Str. X and perhaps originated in Str. XII. STR. IX 2. Sealed stopper Reg. No. 4768; Area B, Locus 715, Building 715; Str. IX (Fig. 19). Fig. 19. Sealed stopper (No. 2). 215</page><page sequence="224">CHAPTER SIX Material : Pinkish-brown clay. Dimensions : Stopper: L 45 mm, W 40 mm, H 34 mm; scarab mounting: L. 22-17.5 mm, W. 14 mm. Method of Manufacture: The stopper was stamped when it was leather-hard. Workmanship : Scarab: good; sealing: mediocre. Technical Details : Linear engraving; scarab set in metal mount. Preservation : Complete. Scarab Shape. Unknown. Base Design : Traces of nine hieroglyphic signs are depicted vertically in three columns.25 On the central column appear three signs: an inverted c [D 36] ,26 below it r [D 21]27 and at the bottom a huge icrt "uraeus" (or cobra) [I 12], with a twisted tail whose end is hidden behind the body.28 One or even two additional more signs may have been depicted at the top of this column, since the signs above the uraeus may belong to one of the ANRA formulae.29 On each of the identical side columns are three signs: at the top s3 "protection" [V 18]30 or alternatively hm [U 36]31, below it t [X l]32, and at the bottom a huge nfr "good" [F 35].33 Typology : Design scarab. The scarab belongs to Tufnell's design class 3B3, "Egyptian Signs and Symbols, Varia" (Tufnell 1984: PL 8b: 1425). According to Keel's modifications it should be transferred to his new design class 9C6, " einzelner Ã¼r aus "34 (Keel 1995: 161, 192, Â§ 529). Origin. Canaanite, on the basis of the inverted c sign and the closest parallels (see below). Date. The scarab seems to belong to the late LMBCS group or the end of the MB (1590-1530 BCE), on the basis of the following: Excavated parallel: A parallel with a huge uraeus (or cobra) and identical side columns with the signs s3 or hm and nfr was excavated in Tomb 6002 at Lachish (Tufnell 1958: 114, Pis. 30-31:33). 35 The shape of the mount: In contrast to the usual form,36 this mount has only one "collar" on the narrow edges. Such mounts are known from Tell el-'Ajjul (Petrie 1934: PL 9:316 = Tufnell 1984: PI. 3: 1094 = Keel 1997: 402-403 [Tell el-cAgul No. 877]; Petrie 1934: PL 9:321 216 = Tufnell 1984: Pl. 7:1287 = Keel 1997: 404-405 [Tell el-cAgulNo. 882])andMirgissa(Vercouttereia/. 1970: 235 [7 g], Pl. 26:3). Archaeological Context : Locus 715 is a Str. IX accumulation on a beaten earth floor located at the northeast edge of Building 715 (Mazar 1997: 48-49, 52, 85, P/S 11-12, 27, 29). The excavators date Str. IX to the LB IB, mid- 15th century (above, p. XIV, Stratigraphie Table). It therefore seems likely either that the stopper predates its context and originally belonged to Str. X, or alternatively that it was stamped with an earlier scarab.37 STR. IXA 3. Bulla Reg. No. 4969/01; Area B, Locus B758, Building 715; Str. IXA (Pl. 20:1; Fig. 20). Previous Bibliography: Mazar 1997: 50. Material: Yellowish-gray clay. Dimensions: Bulla: L 28+ mm, W 27.5 mm, T 10 mm. Method of Manufacture: The bulla was attached to a smooth cylindrical object that was tied by strings both perpendicularly and diagonally.38 It was stamped when it was leather-hard. Workmanship: Excellent (both scarab and bulla). Technical Details: Inside: string marks. Outside: finger marks or vegetation prints, and tiny stone inclusions in the clay. From the shape of its back or inside and its size, it seems that the bulla was attached to the neck of a Cypriot Base Ring juglet39 just above the handle (see the suggested reconstruction in Fig. 21).40 Preservation: Broken on one side. Scarab Shape. Unknown. Base Design. In a horizontal oval which serves as a frame is depicted a walking lion with a raised tail. Behind the lion (but depicted as if above its back) are a lotus flower and a lotus bud to its right. This combination of a lion and lotus flower may be compared with a bifacial oval plaque from Tomb 1593 at Qau/Badari (Brunton 1930: Pl. 34:16). It is possible that a scarab from Zagazig (Petrie and Garrow Duncan 1906: Pl. 33:69), a scarab from Tell el-Ajjul (Petrie 1932: Pl. 7:101 = Rowe 1936: No. 588 = Keel 1997: 203-204 [Tell el-cAgul No.304), and two scarabs from Gezer (Macalister 1912: III: Pis. 205a: 16 and 209:14) also show the lotus flower.41</page><page sequence="225">CAN AANITE AND EGYPTIAN SEALS AND SEALINGS Fig. 20.

The scarab belongs to TufnelTs design class 9E, "Animals and Heraldic Beasts, Lions" (Tufhell 1984: PL 40), or to Keel's new design class 9E1 (Keel 1995: 161, 195-196, Â§Â§ 536-537). Origin . The scarab was made in Egypt, while the bulla could have been made in Canaan or even in Cyprus. Date . The scarab with which the bulla was stamped should be dated to the early 18th Dynasty or the 15th century BCE on the basis of the bifacial oval plaque from Qau/Badari mentioned above, which bears on its other face the Prenomen of Thutmose HI ( Mn-hpr-R *).42 Archaeological Context : Locus B758 is a Str. DCA corner installation with a plaster floor in Room 727 of Building 715 (Mazar 1997: 50, Fig. 13; 52, 85, P/S 12). The excavators date Str. DCA to the LB IB, mid-15th century (above, p. XIV, Stratigraphie Table). Thus the bulla is contemporary with the stratum in which it was found. 4. Scarab Reg. No. B 1 1096; Area B, Locus B919; pit between Str. IX and Str.

The scarab belongs to Tufhell's design classes 3A3, "Egyptian Signs and Symbols, Varia" and 7B3(ii)a, "Scroll Borders, Paired scrolls, top loop-three pairs, oblong, hooked" (Tufnell 1984: Pis. 8, 8b, 31). Origin. Canaanite; the hieroglyphic signs appear clumsy. Date. The scarab seems to belong to the latter part of the LMBCS group on the basis of its shape and design: Shape: Tufnell's features B8-0-d6 appear on two "Hyksos" scarabs excavated at Tell el-Far' ah (South) in Tomb 565 (Petrie 1930: PL 10:109 = Price Williams 1977: 75-76, Fig. 48: 10 = Tufnell 1984: 89, Pis. 16: 1835, 19:1835, 34:2426) and Tomb 582 (Petrie 1930: Pl. 7:32 = Price Williams 1977: 114-1 15, Fig. 82:3 = Tufnell 1984: Pl. 40:2612). Likewise, one of the scarabs of the 15th Dynasty pharaoh Mayebre-Sheshi, kept in the British Museum, shares the same features (Tufnell 1984: Pl. 59:3322). Design: Scarabs of Tufnell's design classes 3A3, "Egyptian Signs and Symbols, Varia", and 7B3(ii)a, "Scroll Borders, Paired scrolls, top loop-three pairs, oblong, hooked" (Tufnell 1984: Pis. 8, 8b, 31), bearing a column of hieroglyphic signs of which some or all are in pairs, already appear among the EMBCS group48 but continue to the late LMBCS group.49 As such, the scarab should be dated to the MB IIC (1590-1530 BCE). Archaeological Context : Locus B9 19 is an ashy pit dug, according to the excavators, between Str. IXA and VIII (Mazar 1997: 5 1-52, P/S 12). The pit, which according to the height of its mouth may belong to Str. IXA, penetrates into Str. IXB and X (Mazar 1997: P/S 10-1 1 ). Therefore it is possible that the scarab originated in Str. X, dated by the excavators to the LB IA (see above, No. 1). STR. VIII 5. Cowroid Reg. No. 4645; Area B, Locus 494, Building 475; Str. VIII (PL 26:13; Fig. 23).

Typology. Design seal. It belongs to Tufnell's design class 10D2, "Human and Mythical Figures, 'Hathor Symbol'" (Tufnell 1984: PL 48) or to the LB variants of Keel's new design class lOAli, "GÃ¶ttinnenkopf (Hathor- Fetisch or Symbol)"53 (Keel 1995: 162, 212-213, Â§Â§ 577-579).

In a horizontal oval, which serves as a frame, is a vertical cartouche in the center, flanked by one hieroglyphic sign on each side. The cartouche contains the Throne-Name or Prenomen of Amenhotep III, Nb-M3ct-RÂ° .55 To the left of the royal name is the hieroglyphic sign hk3 "ruler" [S 38], 56 while to its right is the ideogram W3st (Waset) 'Thebes" [R 19]57. The epithet hÄ·3 W3st "Ruler of Thebes" is usually an integral part of the Birth-Name or Nomen of this ruler.58 According to Jaeger (1982: 154, Â§1143), this epithet appears on eleven scarabs of Amenhotep III. Moreover, this is a typical epithet of the 18th Dynasty. Typology : The scarab belongs to the general group of seals and scarabs bearing "Royal Names".59 Origin : Egyptian, imported to Canaan. Date : On the basis of the royal name (Amenhotep HI), the scarab should be dated to the first half of the fourteenth century BCE (1388-1351/50 BCE).60 Fig. 24.

Locus 3 14 is the central segment of the debris in the western part of Building 315 of Str. VIIA-B (Mazar 1997: 65, 72, 83, P/S 15, 27, 33). The scarab, which belongs to an important group of small finds, mainly glyptic in nature, seems to have fallen from the upper floor (Mazar 1997: 65).

It has some features in common with Petrie's Back Types Y 20 and 35 (Petrie 1917: PI. 71); these are related to his Back Type X, of which several shapes equal Hall's (1913) Type Kl.61 Two such scaraboids were excavated at Tell Beit Mirsim.62 An exact parallel to the Tel Batash scaraboid was excavated in Tomb 510 there.63 Base Design : In a vertical oval, which serves as a frame, a deity is depicted as a central motif with two hieroglyphic signs in front of it and another two near its head. The deity appears as a mummified man with shaven head, false beard and something hanging above the shoulder; he holds the wJs-scepter with both hands. All these components point to an identification with the Egyptian god Ptah,64 with the counterpiece of a menÃ¢t hanging on his back.65 In front of the god Ptah are two Fig. 25.

Base Design : In a vertical oval, which serves as a frame, the lower part is occupied by a vertical cartouche with the name Tiy (Tiy, Tiyi or Teje, the first wife of Amenhotep III), with the title hmt-njswt "The royal wife" above. It seems that this title belongs exclusively to the first regnal year of her husband, since it was changed to hmt-njswt- wrt "[The] great royal wife" in his second year.76 An exact parallel to the Tel Batash cowroid was excavated in the Fosse Temple at Lachish (Tufnell et al 1940: 69, 71, Pis. 32A-B:2). Exact parallels from Egypt are known only from collections: 1. The Egyptian Museum at Turin (Petrie 1889: PI. 18:1296). 2. The Lady Meux Collection, said to originate from Abydos (Budge 1896: 293 [No. 1539]). 3. The Art Institute Collection, Chicago (Pier 1906- 1907: 81, 92, PI. 9:1367). 4.

The Louvre (Ziegler 1994: 537-539, Fig. l:f). Typology : The cowroid belongs to the general group of seals and scarabs bearing "Royal Names". Origin. Egyptian, imported to Canaan. Date : On the basis of the royal name (Queen Tiy), the scarab should be dated to the first half of the 14th century BCE. As mentioned above, this title seems to belong exclusively to the first regnal year of her husband Amenhotep III. Archaeological Context : Identical to No. 6. STR. VIB 9. Bifacial oval plaque Reg. No. 4319; Area B, Locus 460; Str. VIB (PI. 57:18; Fig. 27). Previous Bibliography : Keim and Mazar 1995: 63, Figs. 4.31, C13. Material : Glazed steatite. White glaze with complete coverage. Dimensions : L 12 mm, W 8 mm, T 3 mm. Method of Manufacture: Carving, abrading, drilling, incising and glazing. Workmanship : Mediocre. Technical Details : Perforated, drilled diagonally from both sides. Hollowed-out and linear engraving. Preservation : Almost complete, except for two scars. Seal Shape . Bifacial oval plaque.77 The seal belongs to Keel's Type II, "oval, double sided inscribed piece with smooth sides" (Keel 1995: 84, Â§ 204). Base Design : The seal has two decorated faces, of which Face A is the main one. Face A: In a horizontal oval, which serves as a frame, are depicted four figures (three deities and a pharaoh). Three of the figures face right, while the deity on the right faces those figures to the left. The figure of the deity on the left is mythical. It has a falcon's head, a nms head cover and a human body.78 This figure could be identified with several solar deities. The second figure from the left is a standing anthropomorphic deity with a false beard that can be positively identified as the god Amun by its attribute, the double plumed crown with the hanging streamer behind.79 The third figure from the left is that of a pharaoh, wearing the Fig. 27. Bifacial oval plaque (No. 9). 223</page><page sequence="232">CHAPTER SIX hprÅ¡" The Blue Crown" [S 7]. 80 Behind his head, above Amun's left shoulder, is depicted a fan, most probably representing the servant who usually stands behind the ruler.81 The figure on the right is clearly a goddess, since a cobra emerges from her forehead and she wears a long dress. An exact parallel, also a bifacial oval plaque that was most probably produced in the same workshop, is known from the Kestner-Museum in Hanover (Beste 1979: 78-79 [No. 2117]).82 Another bifacial oval plaque of Amenhotep II, with the same figures but without the falcon-headed deity on the left, is kept in University College, London (Petrie 1917: PI. 30 [18.7.11]). Two related seals, both bifacial rectangular plaques but without the fan behind the king, are known from excavations: 1 . A bifacial rectangular plaque on which the goddess on the right also faces right was excavated at Harageh (Engelbach 1923: 20, Pl. 21:159 = Wiese 1990: 106, 111. 133; 109). 2. A bifacial rectangular plaque on which the falcon- headed deity has been transferred to one of the narrow faces was found in Tomb 57 in Cemetery 120 in Nubia (Firth 1927: 154, PL 36:143 = Jaeger 1982: 8,111. 163; 177, Dl. 510 = Wiese 1990: 106, 111. 134; 111). Face B: In a vertical oval that serves as a frame are depicted two motifs, one on top of the other, with a dividing line between them. In the upper zone is a royal sphinx passant. It has a lion's body with a raised tail, its human royal head has a false beard, and a uraeus emerges from the forehead. Above the back of the sphinx is depicted a winged cobra or uraeus. In the lower zone is the "Sistrum of Hathor" flanked by two uraei crowned with a dsrt "The Red Crown of Lower Egypt" [S 3], 83 with a small vertical lentoid behind each of them.84 A quite close parallel, also a bifacial oval plaque, is kept in the British Museum (Hall 1913: No. 1058), as is a scarab from MakeÅ¥s tomb at Kahun (Petrie 1891: PI. 26:21 = Tufnell 1984: 23-24, 106-107, 110-111, Fig. 22:8). Typology. The plaque belongs to the general group of seals and scarabs that can be considered amulets. However, each face may be assigned to a more specific group. Face A belongs to Wiese's Motif No. 9: " KÃ¶nig zwischen GÃ¶ttern-Der zwischen zwei oder drei GÃ¶ttern stehende KÃ¶nig"*5 (Wiese 1990: 105-1 16). Wiese did not 224 notice that the deities on the right sides on the bifacial rectangular plaque parallels are actually goddesses. Face B could be considered a design scarab. The upper zone belongs to Keel's additional design class 9F1, " MenschenkÃ¶pfiger Sphinx "86 (Keel 1995: 161, 198-199, Â§Â§ 544-548), while the lower zone belongs to Tufnell's design class 10D2, "Human and Mythical Figures, Hathor Symbol" (Tufnell 1984: PI. 48) or to the LB variants of Keel's new design class lOAli, "GÃ¶ttinnenkopf (Hathor -Fetisch or Symbol)"*1 (Keel 1995: 162, 212-213, Â§Â§ 577-579). Origin. Egyptian, imported to Canaan. Date. The Tel Batash plaque should be dated to the early 18th Dynasty, or more specifically to the 15th Century BCE, on the basis of the parallels from the Kestner- Museum, Hanover and the British Museum, London. On each of these plaques the other face contains the Prenomen of Thutmose HI ( Mn-hpr-R ^).88 The same date is supported by the scarab from Maket's tomb at Kahun. Archaeological Context : Locus 460, a stratified accumulation in an open area, belongs to Str. VIB (Mazar 1997: 73-75, 84, P/S 17, 26, 30-31, 33), dated by the excavators to the LB ÃB, mid to late 13th century (above, p. XIV, Stratigraphie Table). It therefore seems that the bifacial oval plaque, of the 15th century BCE, was found in a later and secondary context. STR. VI 10. Scarab Reg. No. 4036; Area B, Locus 424; Str.

Base Design : In a vertical oval, which serves as a frame, five hieroglyphic signs are depicted. In the central column are from top to bottom rc "sun" [N 5]89, mn [Y 5]90 and hpr "become, to be" [L l],91 which create the Prenomen of Thutmose HI (Mn-hpr-R0),92 although they are not encircled by a cartouche. On each side of hpr is nfr "good" [F 35], 93 with two horizontal bars on their top. Typology : The scarab belongs to the general group of seals and scarabs bearing "Royal Names". Origin : Canaanite, locally produced. The mediocre workmanship of the scarab's features and the hieroglyphic signs and the unparalleled appearance of the two nfr signs94 clearly point to a local workshop.95 Date: Although the scarab bears the name of the celebrated 18th Dynasty pharaoh Thutmose III, it can be dated to the 19th Dynasty96 on the basis of its shape and design. Shape: According to Rowe's typology, the Elythra and Pronotum of the Tel Batash scarab (Type 43) are known between the 14th and 19th Dynasties, while its side (Type 23) is exclusive to the 19th Dynasty. Design: The nfr signs with the two horizontal bars are known from Ramesside contexts, for example on a scarab97 from Tomb 934 at Tell el-Far'ah (South).98 Archaeological Context : Locus 424 is an open area west of Building 476 of early Str. VI (=VIB) and of Building 442 of late Str. VI (=VIA) (Mazar 1997: 73-75, 84, P/S 17-18, 30). The suggested production date for the Tel Batash scarab in the 19th Dynasty fits well with the date given by the excavators to the two phases of Str. VI, which span the mid- 13th to early 12th centuries (above, p. XIV, Stratigraphie Table). Thus, the object is contemporary with the stratum in which it was found. STR. V 11. Scarab Reg.

Typology. Design scarab. This motif is one of the sub- types of the "Three Uraei on a nb- sign" type. In the other sub-types the three uraei have above their heads three different crowns,108 sun-discs,109 other hieroglyphic signs of more than one type110 or nothing.111 Arare variant from Megiddo is said to have at its bottom a fish rather than the common nb sign (Lamon and Shipton 1939: PL 69:24). According to Keel's later modification of Olga Tufnell's Design Classification of MB scarabs (as discussed in the Introduction), the Batash scarab belongs to design class 9C7, "Reihe von drei und mehr UrÃ¤en"112 (Keel 1995: 161, 193, Â§ 530). Origin. Egyptian, imported to Canaan. Date. This motif is well known in Egypt throughout the entire New Kingdom from the 18th to 20th Dynasties: 18th Dynasty: Kahun (Petrie 1891: Pl. 23:91 = 1925: Pl. 18: 1405113), Memphis (Schneider et al. 1996: 36, Pis. 22, 68 [No. 197]). 18th or 19th Dynasty: Riqqeh (Engelbach et al. 1915: 32, PL 51:5). 19th or 20th Dynasty: Abydos (Newberry 1907: 166 [No. 36659], Pl. 15:36659), Ashkelon (Keel 1997: 714-715 [Aschkelon No. 64]). 20th Dynasty: Tell el-Yehudiyeh (Griffith 1890: 50, Pl. 16: 12), Tell Rotab (Retabe) (Griffith 1890: 57, Pl. 19:36), Tell el- Amarna114 and Qau/Badari (Brunton 1930: 14, Pis. 23 [Tomb 5420], 34:42).

Archaeological Context : Locus C754 belongs to Str. V of the Iron Age I (Mazar 1997: 98-99, 132, P/S 37, 48). On the basis of the above-mentioned parallels, it seems that the Tel Batash scarab either predates Str. V or is contemporary with it. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS Objects There is a conspicuous diversity in the types of objects: five scarabs, two cowroids, one sealed stopper, one bulla, one scaraboid and one bifacial oval plaque. Materials The eleven seals and sealings are made of three different materials, both natural and artificial: glazed steatite, 8 items; clay, 2 items; composition, 1 item. The glaze had survived in varying degrees on all the objects made of glazed steatite, most probably depending on micro- climatic conditions and depositional environments in the destruction layers. Workmanship 1 . The workmanship of the EMBCS is better than that of the LMBCS. 2. The workmanship of the 18th Dynasty seals and scarabs is better than that of the 19th Dynasty scarab. Scarab Shape Scarab No. 4 has a previously unknown type of Head and Clypeus. Origin 1 . All of the MB scarabs (Nos. 1 and 4) and the sealing (No. 2) are locally made Canaanite products. 2. All of the LB seals (Nos. 5-9 and 11) and the sealing (No. 3), except for item No. 10, are imported from Egypt. Date 1. One scarab (No 1) belongs to EMBCS, while one sealing and one scarab (Nos. 2 and 4 respectively) belong to the late LMBCS. 2. One scarab (No. 6) and one cowroid (No. 8) bear the names of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Amenhotep III and his wife Tiy respectively, supporting their identification as imported objects.115 3. No typical Amarna material was observed. 4. The scarab with the Prenomen of Thutmose III (No. 10) postdates his reign. Archaeological Contexts Most of the glyptic material (six out of eleven) fits well with the dates established by other components of material culture, such as pottery and other objects. NOTES 1 For the different methods used in ancient Egypt to glaze steatite objects, see Tite and Bimson 1989. 2 See also Keel 1995: 153, Â§ 406. 3 See for example Brandl 1993b: 211-212, No. 9, Fig. 8.9. 4 For diagrams showing the parts of the scarab beetle, see Rowe 1936: PL 23; Ward 1978: Frontispiece; Uehlinger 1990: 62, Fig. 37; Keel 1995: 20, Fig. 1. The last is the most detailed, with the terms given in four languages (German, English, French and Italian). 5 This typology also appears with some changes in Ward and Dever 1994: 161-165. 6 This difficulty discouraged me from discussing these features in several of my previous studies (Brandl 1984: 60; 1986: 247; 1993a: 129; 1993b: 203). Despite this, I decided to refer to the scarabs' features in the present publication, since comparative data are still meager and the features provide another means of refining dating, albeit a secondary one in comparison to the motifs on the scarabs. 7 On the history and development of Tufnell's Design Classification, see Brandl 1986: 247, n. 4. 8 For a short survey, see Keel 1995: 158-162. 9 For a full discussion, see Brandl 2004. 10 For scarabs with Head B2 and Side e9, see recently Keel 2004: 81-93. 11 See also Keel 1995: 170, Â§ 453. 12 See also Keel 1995: 170, Â§ 452. 13 See also Keel 1995: 172, Â§ 459. 14 See also Keel 2004: 83. 15 See also Keel 1995: 172, Â§ 461. 16 See also Keel 1995: 171, Â§ 453. 17 See also Keel 1995: 171, Â§ 458. 18 The scarabs that bear the ANRA formula also belong to Richards' Type E, "Animal and Human Figures"; Richards 1996: 148-157; 2001: 87-92. 227</page><page sequence="236">CHAPTER SIX 19 See also Keel 1995: 172, Â§ 461. 20 See also Keel 1995: 170, Â§ 452. 21 See also Keel 1995: 172, Â§ 458. 22 See also Keel 1995: 170, Â§ 452. 23 For an individual uraeus with such a crown, see for example Petrie 1890: PL 23:103; Engelbach et al. 1915: PL 18:119; Brunton 1930: PL 34:35; Starkey and Harding 1932: Pl. 73:14, 44. 24 The earlier designation of this scarab as "Hyksos" (Mazar 1997: 42) is erroneous. 25 The scarab's base probably contained a vertical oval frame that was hidden by the mounting (see our reconstruction). 26 See also Keel 1995: 169, Â§ 448. 27 See also Keel 1995: 172, Â§ 461 . 28 Such cobras appear inter alia on royal scarabs of the 15th (or Hyksos) Dynasty (Petrie 1932: Pl. 13:2 = Keel 1997: 106-107 [Tell el-cAgul No. 2, with additional bibliography]; Hayes 1968: 5, Fig. 1 [second from left on the second row], 7; Tufnell 1984: Pis. 62:3442-43, 3446, 63:3494-95). 29 Richards 1996: 10 [PEL 4], 62 [TEA61], 64 [TEA 68-69], 71 [TEF 5], 77 [TEY 4]; 2001: 246 [PEL 4], 286 [TEA 61], 288 [TEA 68-69], 293 [TEF 5], 297 [TEY 4]. 30 See also Keel 1995: 174, Â§ 465.

This kind of deity, with lion- or cat-shaped head, appears in Israel/Palestine mainly in Iron I (from Beth-Shemesh, Sheikh Zweid, Tel Batash, Tell el-Far'ah [S], Tel Gerisa and two unknown locations). It is remarkable that while lion- or cat-headed goddesses with flat disk and uraeus are unknown in Iron II, this type reappears at Ashkelon and Sheikh Zweid in the Iron Ill-Persian periods (Herrmann 1994: 179). An identical amulet type, though it shows a striding goddess with a scepter in one hand, is known up to Iron II (Herrmann 1994: 183). For detailed interpretation of the lion- or cat-headed amulets, see Herrmann 2003: 10. The appearance of the type is summarized in Table 61. Table 61. Appearance of the amulet type in Palestine.

Five of these are discussed in this chapter, while the sixth, a Cypriot seal, is discussed by J. Smith in Chapter IX. Four of these seals (Nos. 1-3, as well as the Cypriot seal) were found in the destruction debris of Building 315 of Str. VII (14th century BCE). They were found at a high level of the destruction layer of this building and thus perhaps fell from the second floor, where the private quarters may have been located. The concentration of four cylinder seals as well as other luxury goods in this house indicates the high status of the owner. No. 4 was found in Building 481 of Str. VII south of Building 315, while No. 5 was found in a mixed layer in an open space attributed to Str. VI and V in the northwestern part of Area B. 1. Cylinder seal Reg. No. 3930; Locus 315, Building 315; level 28.20; Str. VII (Pl. 5:4; Photo 96). H 3.3 cm; D 1.3 cm. Complete, made of composition,* with dark patina. Color photograph: Keim and Mazar 1995: 81. This seal is in the Mitannian Common Style (see below, No. 2). A human figure sits on a throne opposite a sacred tree, turning to his right. The figure is rather thin and perhaps dressed in a long robe. Behind his head is an elongated element that may be part of the headdress; the upper part of the headdress is missing. Since no attributes are associated with the figure, it is unclear whether he should be identified as a deity or a The term "composition" is used in this chapter as an alternative to "frit", "paste", "faience" or "sintered quartz" used in various publications (Collon 1987: 102). worshipper. The throne has a low back with a bulbous end. The figure touches a stylized tree with his right arm and his left arm holds a staff with a bulbous end; above it is a circle made by a single drilling. The tree is of the typical "bouquet" type with five branches ending in circles. To the right of the tree a horned animal stands with its back to the tree and its head turned towards it. An incised line frames the scene at the top and bottom. Two additional lines around the central part of the cylinder were incised before the figures were cut, as the continuous lines are seen between the figures but not on the figures themselves. The individual motifs as well as the glyptic style are well known in Mitannian Common Style seals from the Levant, though none is identical to ours. A close parallel is a seal from Hazor Str. XIII ( Hazor Ill-TV : PI. 320:3; Beck 1989: 317), though in this seal the animal looks away from the tree and a vertical geometric ladder motif serves as a divider between the scenes. A variation of this motif shows worshippers standing in front of a tree with an animal on the opposite side (Beck 1989: 317, n. 75; Ben-Tor et al. 1987: 5, a seal from Yoqne'am with very similar workmanship to ours).

No. 3885; Locus 315, Building 315; level 28.64; Str. VII (Pl. 50:5; Photo 97). H 2.6 cm; D 1.2 cm. Complete, made of white/yellow composition. This seal too is in the Mitannian Common Style. Two human figures (worshippers?) stand on either side of a sacred tree. Both figures are dressed in long robes with decorated fringe, their hands on their chest. They wear the typical Mitannian hat and the locks of hair at the back of their heads are also typical of this style. The figure to the right of the tree appears to be bearded, while the left one is clean-shaven. Subsidiary motifs are arranged in two registers with a horizontal double-line divider. The upper register shows two crouching horned animals in antithetical position, while the lower includes two identical motifs that can be identified as a schematization of the sacred tree. The subjects, style, composition and details of execution are all typical of the Mitannian Common Style. Examples of similar composition on Mitannian Common Style seals from the Southern Levant are: a seal from Gezer (Parker 1949: No. 94), a seal from Tell es-Safi (Bliss and Macalister 1902: PI. 83:4); a seal from Lachish (Parker 1949: No. 183, not included in the Lachish reports) and a seal from a cave in the citadel of Amman (Ward 1966: Pl. XXI: J9399). The subsidiary motifs are also typically Mitannian. The stylized tree motif can be seen in Mitannian Common Style seals from Beth-Shean (e.g. Rowe 1940: Pis. 37:9; 40:1 = Parker 1949: Nos. 81 and 84). Identical motifs appear on the seal from Tell es-Safi mentioned above. Seals 1 and 2 belong to the Mitannian Common style (defined by Porada 1947: 12-13 and passim ) which became common during the 14th-13th centuries in Canaan (Parker 1949; Mazar 1971: 37-70; 1978: 9-11; Beck 1989: 320-321; Salje 1990), perhaps due to the migration of Hurrians to this region during the late 15th and 14th centuries BCE, particularly after the fall of the Mitannian kingdom. The particular subject, composition and style of these two seals are found mainly in the southern Levant, and thus these two seals as well as other similar seals were probably produced in workshops in this region (Mazar 1971: 11; Beck 1989: 317). Many seals of this type were given as offerings or donations to temples, such as those found at Beth-Shean, which comprise the largest collection of Mitannian Common Style seals in Canaan. Such seals were probably used as talismans rather than personal seals. 3. Cylinder seal Reg. No. 3929; Locus 315, Building 315; level 28.00; Str. VII (Pl. 50:6; Photo 98). H 2.1 cm; D 1.0 cm. Complete, made of blue composition. This seal is in the local Canaanite style. Two human figures, facing left, together hold a vertical staff. Both are dressed in long robes with double thickened lower fringe. They are standing on stools with rather tall legs. The face of the figure on the right is very crude and does not look human. To the left of these two figures is a stag facing left with its head turned backward. Above the stag is a crouching human figure facing left with legs apart. His left hand is raised to the side and holds a weapon, while his right hand is raised in front of the body. A drilling near this figure is probably intentional. An incised line frames the scene at top and bottom. The two figures standing on stools can be interpreted as deities, though no clear attributes are shown. T. Ornan has suggested to me that the crouching figure represents 238</page><page sequence="246">CYLINDER SEALS, STAMP SEALS AND A SEAL IMPRESSION Photo 99. Cylinder seal impression (Reg. No. B11164). a running warrior god on top of a stag, a motif known in Hittite iconography. Hittite influence on local Canaanite glyptics is recognized, though it is rare in the 14th century BCE, to which Str. VII is dated. From the crude style of this seal, it appears to be the product of a local Canaanite workshop. 4. Cylinder seal Reg. No. B 1 1 164; Locus 48 1 , Building 48 1 ; level 27.72; Str. VIIB (PI. 50:8; Photo 99). H 1.8 cm; D 0.8 cm. Complete, made of white composition. A human figure (a god or king?), dressed in a long robe and perhaps wearing an Egyptian-style wig, sits on a throne looking left, his right hand in a gesture of blessing. In front of this figure is a standing human figure dressed in a short skirt. His face seems turned toward the sitting figure, but his legs appear to be turned away; he is holding an elongated object (a spear?) and a branch. To the left of this figure is a horned animal walking to the left with its head turned back towards the branch and the standing figure. Two unidentified objects appear on either side of the sitting human figure's head. The figures are cut in crude, simple style. There are no details of face, body or dress, except for lines across the long robe of the seated figure. The seated figure is detached from his throne and his feet are curiously up in the air. Two horizontal lines frame the scene at top and bottom. This seal must be a product of a local Canaanite workshop, though it cannot be related to any specific glyptic style. No exact parallels can be found among seals found in the southern Levant, and there are no clear stylistic parallels. Exceptions could be two seals from Gezer (Macalister 1912: Vol. II, PI. 37: 44-15), which show sitting figures and additional persons and motifs. However, only inadequate drawings of these seals were published, and the style is unknown. 5. Cylinder seal Reg. No. 3634; Locus 356; level 28.90; Str. VI-V (PI. 65:10; Photo 100). H 2.2 cm; D 1.1 cm. Complete, made of hematite. The piercing is somewhat off-center. This seal shows a procession of a horned animal, a griffin and a bull moving to the left. An eagle and a crouching lion are shown above these animals; a staff and a branch appear between the animals as filling motifs. The style is linear and rather crude. There is no attempt to depict details of body or faces, and the animals are depicted schematically. Distinctive stylistic features are the thin bodies and long, thin legs of the animals, and the depiction of the wings of the animals by a series of parallel lines inside a frame. This seal belongs to a group of seals with very distinct stylistic and iconographie features. The following seals from Palestine belong to this group: Tell Abu Hawam, Str. V (Hamilton 1935: PI. 26:412; Parker 1949: No. 154), two humans holding spears (?), eagle, bull, fish; Tell Abu Hawam, Str. V (Hamilton 1935: PI. 26:413; Photo 100. Cylinder seal and impression (Reg. No. 3634). 239</page><page sequence="247">CHAPTER EIGHT Parker 1949: No. 153), horned animal, standing griffin, scorpion; Lachish, Tomb 4004 (Lachish IV: PL 34:164; Parker 1949: No. 151), human figure, bull, standing griffin, scorpion; Megiddo, Tomb 877B1 ( Megiddo Tombs : Pl. 95:34; Parker 1949: No. 163), running griffin (or winged bull?); two horned animals, two unidentified motifs (palm branches?); and Tell el-Hesi (Parker 1949: No. 140; Salje 1990: Pl. XXL364). A seal of this group in the Morgan collection (Porada 1949: No. 1004), showing a man holding a spear, a horned animal with a bird on its back, and a standing griffin, was defined by Porada as "Palestinian". The style was defined by her (1949: 137) as "crude, bulbous engraving". Keel (1993: 124-126; 1994b: 228-229, 250, Figs. 50-55) also defined this group as being of local Palestinian production. However, 33 seals of this group came from Ugarit and four from various other sites in Syria (Hama, Khamid el-Loz, Djeble and Tell Sukas, while only six were found in Palestine and two more are known in collections (Amiet 1992: 41-49). Amiet defined this group as "Syro-Palestinian". Among the seals from Ugarit, Nos. 61-76, 78-81 are very similar to our group in both motifs and glyptic style. Amiet dated the group to the 14th- 1 3th centuries BCE on the basis of contexts at Ugarit; this date fits the contexts in Palestine and at Khamid el-Loz (Salje 1990: Taf. XXL362). Salje (1990: 122, 307-308; Pl. XXL353-357, 359, 363, 365) defined this group as "Syrian group S(P)3", to which she attributed 41 seals. All these scholars recognized the specific stylistic qualities and iconographie repertoire of this group. It should be considered a glyptic style known throughout the Levant in the LB IIB. Since the largest concentration of seals of this group is at Ugarit, the production center of this group may have been at Ugarit itself or at some other Syrian workshop. 6. Cypriot seal Reg. No. 3917; Locus 315, Building 315; level 28.18; Str. VII (PL 50:7). H 2.1 cm; D 0.85-0.90 cm at ends, 0.80-0.85 cm in middle. A complete Cypriot seal made of soft dark gray stone, possibly chlorite. For discussion of this seal, see below, Chapter IX. CONCLUSIONS Four of the six cylinder seals from Tel Batash were found in Area B in Str. VII, dated to the 14th century BCE. Only one (No. 5) comes from an insecure context, a layer that may be attributed to either Str. VI or V. However, this seal may have originated from an earlier level, since this particular part of Area B was disturbed by deep Iron I pits. The find of four seals in one dwelling house is rare, as most of the LB seals in Palestine were found in hoards related to temples (e.g. at Hazor and Beth-Shean). This may be taken as an indication for the wealth of the owner of this house. Together, the six cylinder seals from Area B represent the most important glyptic styles known in Canaan in the LB II, mainly during the 14th century BCE. Two of the seals belong to the Mitannian Common Style, three belong to different local Canaanite workshops and one is an imported Cypriot seal. A study of more than 300 seals from LB Palestine (Mazar 1971) has indicated that more than half of the seals are in the Mitannian Common Style, while the others are divided between various local Canaanite stylistic groups, probably the products of various Canaanite workshops. In many of these strong Egyptian influence can be seen. In addition to these two major groups, there were a few imported Cypriot and Middle Assyrian seals. STAMP SEALS 1. Stamp seal Reg.

No. 3593). 240</page><page sequence="248">CYLINDER SEALS, STAMP SEALS AND A SEAL IMPRESSION at the bottom. The figure can be interpreted in various ways. In my opinion, the figure is seated on a square stool, facing right (when looking at the impression) and holding the lyre with both hands. According to this explanation, the body and head are missing; they were probably shown as a vertical line at the left edge of the seal, which was eroded, the diagonal line in the upper left corner of the seal is the left hand, while the diagonal line below it is the right hand. The two isolated vertical lines on the lower right corner of the seal impression could be a schematic rendering of the musician's legs. In a study of ancient lyres, Lawergren (1998: 52) is cautious concerning the meaning and accuracy of the depiction on our seal, but basically accepts our interpretation. This interpretation is also supported by analogies to depictions of lyre-players (below). However, a different reading of this seal was suggested by Shuval (1990: 157): "A kneeling figure facing to the right plays a two-stringed lyre. The body is a vertical line, with a protuberance at the back near the top. A separate line, at an angle to the body denotes the head. Only one arm is shown, to the left of the body. The forearm is horizontal at hip level, and touches the body where the single leg abuts. A short, diagonal line crosses the body where the leg joins it (dagger?). The left side of the lyre merges with the body. In front, below the lyre, are two Nfr (?) signs, one of them inverted. The design is linear and schematic." Both Shuval's explanation and his drawing of the seal impression raise doubts. I cannot see the widening of the vertical line that appears in his drawing, nor can I see the diagonal line that is explained as a dagger. I doubt whether the diagonal line can be identified as a head, and whether his identification of the vertical line as the body of the figure is correct. I also doubt whether the two vertical lines on the lower right side can be identified as Egyptian nfr signs. The motif of a player on a two-stringed lyre (though the lyre has a rounded bottom) appears on a seal from Ashdod Area G, Str. X (10th century BCE) (. Ashdod //-///: 138, PL LXIX:7, Fig. 76:1; Shuval 1990: 156, No. 77; Braun 2002: 156). In the Philistine culture, the motif is known on the so-called "Orpheus Jug" from Megiddo Str. VIA (Dothan 1982: 138, Fig. 28; Braun 2002: 147-148), on the "Musicians Stand" from Ashdod (Dothan 1982: 251, Pl. 33; Braun 2002: 170, Fig. IV:32d) and on a clay figurine from Ashdod (Braun 2002; 173, Fig. IV:33). The lyre-player motif appears on Iron II seals from Tarsus and elsewhere that Porada related to the Levant (Porada 1956; Shuval 1990: 112-115; Keel 1994a: 32), as well as on 8th-century seals from Ischia in Greece (Buchner and Boardman 1966). The meaning of these parallels remains obscure, except that they may hint at a wider Aegean background for this motif. In the framework of general discussion of lyre depictions in Israel and their significance (Braun 2002:145-164), Braun (2002: 156) evaluates our lyre in the following words: "To my knowledge, the lyre on the Tel Batash seal is the oldest known representation of a strictly angular symmetrical lyre with parallel strings. One significant and surprising observation connected with this portrayal is that it corrects our earlier view concerning the origin of this type of lyre; rather than originating in Syria, it must have emerged much farther to the south. It was probably not until after Tiglath Pileser III conquered both Israel and Philistia that this lyre form reached the northwestern areas of Phoenicia and northern Assyria." In terms of its shape, our seal belongs to a larger group of truncated-pyramidal seals from Iron I Palestine. This group was discussed by Keel (1994a) and dubbed by him "Anchor Seals", due to their resemblance to the shape of LB stone anchors. Keel included in this group 16 seals from Dan, ' Akko, Tell Keisan, Megiddo, Samaria, Tell en-Nasbeh, Tell Qasile, Ashdod, Tel Batash, Lachish and Tell el-Far'ah (S) and defined them as "Philistine". However, only a few came from Philistine sites (the others were from inland sites or northern Israel) and their diverse distribution, iconography and style do not permit specific ethnic identification. There is little difference between these seals and other conoid and scaraboid seals from Iron I- II Palestine. As Keel writes, in this group only the lyre-player motif may be specifically related to Philistine iconography. 2. Stamp seal Reg. No. H9208; Locus H959; level 29.24; Str.

SEAL IMPRESSION ON A BULLA Seal impression on a bulla Reg. No. 3716; Area B, Locus 354; level 29.72 (PI. 67:22; Photo 103). L 1.2 cm; W 1.0 cm. Locus 354 in Area B is an Iron II wall, built into Str. V debris in Square K-33. The bulla was found attached to this wall and probably came from the nearby Str. V debris. This is a complete seal impression on a bulla with a string impression on its back. The impression was probably made by a conoid, pyramidal or scaraboid seal. The impression shows a schematic human figure with one hand raised (perhaps holding a weapon?) and the other hand pointing down. To the right of and perpendicular to the human figure is an animal with its face turned away from the human figure. The identity of Photo 103. Seal impression on a bulla (Reg. No. 3716). 242 the animal is unclear, though it could be a quadruped; the loop at the bottom of this animal cannot be explained. The style is linear and schematic. No details of face or dress are depicted. This seal impression was included in the catalogue of Iron I seals compiled by Shuval (1990): 138, No. 31. For a human figure in a similar posture as a main motif see a seal from Beth-Shean Level VI (Shuval 1990: 148, No. 54) and a seal from Tomb 532 of Iron I at Tell el-Far' ah (S) (Petrie 1930: 7; PI. 22:201. A similar human figure as a subsidiary motif appears in several additional seals from Tell el-Far'ah (S) (Petrie 1930: Pis. 31:319, Tomb 227; 31:287, Tomb 503, Iron IIA; my thanks to Stefan Miinger for these references). Similar seals cut in a simple, schematic style are common in both Iron I and Iron IIA seals; they are usually conoid or pyramidal. A group of Iron IIA seals from Tel Rehov (as yet unpublished) includes several human figures in a similar schematic style. The closest parallel to the Tel Batash seal is a seal from Tell Qasile (Maisler 1951: PL 36:c; Shuval 1990: 138, No. 30). Closely related compositions appear on seals from various other sites like Megiddo, Tell 'Eitun, Tell en-Nasbeh, Tell el- Far'ah (S) and ' Akko (Shuval 1990: 32-A4). These, and a few others, were defined by Shuval as his Group E, "the god standing on a quadruped" (Shuval 1990: 95-97). Indeed, in most seals of this group a god is seen on top of an animal. However, in our case the animal is shown at the side of the human figure, and the depiction is too schematic to say whether the human figure is meant to represent a god. Our seal impression may thus perhaps be regarded as an extreme schematization of the god and animal composition. For the human figure and lion in Iron I seals from Beer Sheba and Tell Keisan, see also Keel (1990: 344-346). The following comments on this seal impression were sent to me by Dr. Stefan Miinger: "...Although the elements to the right of the human figure cannot be identified with certainty, the coarse schematic engraving technique used as well as the supposed shape of the original seal points to an Early Iron Age production, most probably related to - if not originating from - the so-called group of "mass-produced stamp-seal amulets" (or the Tanite seals, as I call them). Keel (1990; 1994b: 1-52) dates this group to the later 11th c. BCE. As you know, I personally favor - based on Egyptian parallels and epigraphic evidence - a slightly later date, proposing a start of the production of such amulets from the 3rd quarter of the 10th c. BCE until ca. 900. . . It is difficult</page><page sequence="250">CYLINDER SEALS, STAMP SEALS AND A SEAL IMPRESSION to identify the standing figure without knowing what the signs to its right mean. If it is holding a crocodile, I would suggest that it might be the Egyptian god Shed "savior" or Horus as Shed (Brunner 1984). On Egyptian stelae of the 19th dynasty and the Late Period he is represented standing on two crocodiles holding scorpions, snakes, and lions." MÃ¹nger also gives several additional parallels to the posture of the human figure, which we have not included here.

No. 3917; Area B, Locus 315, Building 315; level 28.18 m; Str. VII (Pl. 50:7; Fig. 30). H 2.1 cm; D 0.85-0.90 cm at ends, 0.80-0.85 cm in middle. Complete, soft dark gray stone, possibly chlorite. DESCRIPTION OF SCENE The scene is typical of cylinder seals in Late Cypriot Derivative Style. As seen in impression, a so-called "Mistress of the Animals"1 faces right with both arms lowered and lower arms and hands turned outwards. She wears an ankle-length, horizontally striated robe, a trident-shaped necklace around her neck, heeled shoes typical of Late Cypriot figures, and what may be a rounded cap. Her face is triangular, formed by a Fig. 30. Cylinder seal (Reg. No. 3917) and impression (drawing by J. S. Smith). long line for her brow and nose and two others forming the shape of her jaw. A single dot above her lower jaw represents her eye. To her right is a crouching caprid with two long curved horns, an ear and a beard. It too has a single dot for an eye. Its body faces right, but its head turns back towards the hand of the Mistress, forcing the body into a reverse S-curve. Its right front hoof reaches the ground, while its left is raised high in the air. Behind the Mistress and in front of the caprid is a stylized tree.2 The caprid's left foreleg appears to reach towards the branches to grasp its fruit. To the left and right of the Mistress's head are Cypro-Minoan signs. A third mark behind the head of the caprid is either a schematic bird or a third sign. Above and below the scene are framing horizontal lines, the top one of which cuts the top of the two uppermost Cypro-Minoan signs, demonstrating that they form part of the original seal decoration. The fact that the trident of the figure's necklace resembles a Cypro-Minoan sign is probably coincidental. MANUFACTURE AND WEAR As with other seals of this type, this cylinder seal was carved from a soft gray stone, probably chlorite.3 Carved mainly with a graver, parts of the scene, such as the lower part of the robe and tree trunk, may have been started with a drill. The eyes of the Mistress and the caprid could have been added either with a drill or a graver. The seal bears no signs of secondary carving or abrasion, even though the stringhole (diameter 0.30 cm) is consistently off-center. The top of the stringhole is slightly worn, while the bottom part of the hole is only chipped. If the seal was worn on a long string that was knotted at the bottom, as were many other cylinder seals, the wear on the top hole may come from wear as it rubbed against the untied part of the string. Wear on the lower edge 245</page><page sequence="252">CHAPTER NINE may come from the lower part of the seal occasionally hitting the ground.4 DISCUSSION The cylinder seal from Tel Batash fits within the well- known group of Derivative Cypriot Style seals originally defined by Edith Porada in 1948 as her Group V. It is a significant addition to our understanding of the group not only for the details and composition of the scene, but also because of the presence of Cypro-Minoan signs carved as part of the original seal decoration. The iconographie and epigraphic details indicate how seals of the Derivative Style convey messages of authority. Less intricate than the seals of the Elaborate Cypriot Style, which are often carved in hard stone, Derivative Style seals are rarely carved in hard stone and bear scenes that could be characterized as schematic, or derivative, versions of scenes on some cylinders of Elaborate Style.5 Jennifer Webb's publication of a Derivative Style cylinder seal from Kazaphani-Ay/os Andronikos on Cyprus occasioned a thorough discussion of the group in 1989. Scenes on these cylinders consist of four main elements that appear in a variety of combinations: an authority figure, animals, a tree, and symbolic motifs distributed around the characters. Not all elements are present on each example of the style. Most Derivative Cypriot Style cylinder seals come from excavated contexts on Cyprus. Apart from the Tel Batash seal, three examples with slightly varying scenes were found in the Levant, at Gezer, Megiddo and Shiqmona.6 Porada defined the group as 14th century BCE, which is the date of the context of the seal found at Tel Batash. Webb has shown, however, that the group has its origins in the 15th century BCE7 among locally produced cylinders at Ayia Irini -Paleokastro on Morphou Bay in northern Cyprus.8 Derivative Style cylinders also occur in later Bronze Age contexts.9 By far the largest number come from the Kourion area, either from John Franklin Daniel's excavations at Episkopi-Bamboula10 or L. P. di Cesnola's activities in the area,11 suggesting that Derivative Style seals may have been made there. The example from Tel Batash represents a guardian figure or deity, specifically a Mistress of the Animals,12 who intercedes between a caprid and a tree, often called a sacred tree.13 The caprid attempts to reach the branches of the tree to eat its leaves and fruit. The deity reaches out to the caprid, which has turned its head towards the figure. Unlike on some other examples of the type, the deity does not wield a weapon. The LB manifestations of 246 the deity in the Mediterranean are primarily concerned with control over animals.14 Although the position of the deity's arm below the mouth of the caprid makes it look as if she is feeding the animal,15 her hand extends almost to the animal's hindquarters. The balanced position of her hands, one toward the animal's back and the other almost touching the lower part of the tree, may have been meant to represent equal control over the caprid and the tree. The end result of the control of animals by both the Mistress of the Animals and her male counterpart, the Master of the Animals, was animal slaughter.16 While the Master of the Animals killed in the hunt, the Mistress of the Animals killed in animal sacrifice.17 The role of the goddess as protector of the tree, often called a sacred tree, is also important. Both the protecting of the tree and its fruit and the bringing of an animal to sacrifice would have been acts appropriate for a guardian figure or goddess seen as a provider. The theme of crop abundance combined with sacrificial ritual was common throughout the ancient world. Whoever wore this seal from Tel Batash, or other cylinders of this group, may well have considered it a protective amulet, one that specifically provided protection by the deity represented. Although Derivative Style cylinders are similar in carving style and subject matter, variations in all parts of the scene are possible. On this cylinder are a deity, an animal, a tree and filling motifs. Some seals, however, lack what appear to be essential parts of the scene, either the deity18 or the tree.19 There is always, however, an animal. Griffins, mythological figures, are the most common animals,20 with caprids and lions also appearing frequently.21 It appears to be significant, however, that on seals without a Mistress of the Animals, griffins are present. Griffins on seals with a deity are sometimes tethered, which suggests the taming of these creatures by their guardians.22 As beings tamed or trained by their guardians, iconographically they could probably substitute for the deity, indicating her presence even when she is not depicted. Lions also appear as tamed or trained animals, giving them a mythological identity in Cypriot glyptic.23 A particularly good example of the equivalent position of the griffin and lion with respect to an authority figure appears on a cylinder seal from Toumba tou Skourou. It shows a controlling figure, probably the Master of the Animals, who appears to rein in a griffin on one side and a lion on the other.24 Distinguishing between the griffin/lion and the caprid</page><page sequence="253">A C YPRIOT CYLINDER SEAL is important for seals of the Derivative Style, since the caprid is the only animal represented on these seals that was meant for sacrifice as a result of control by the goddess. Whether or not the deity is represented in the form of the robed figure, her authority is always present, conveying her role as protector. Some seals lack the tree, showing only the deity and an animal or the griffin and an animal. The tree, therefore, appears to be of secondary iconographical importance for the depiction of the control or authority of the Mistress of the Animals. Her protection of resources may well have been implied through depiction of control of animals that posed a threat to the fruit of the trees. Determination of the most prominent message portrayed in the iconography of Derivative Style cylinder seals is important when considering their function, both amuletic and sphragistic. As amulets their message of authority, control and protection was powerful. Similarly, as seals, rolled on clay to convey a message of responsibility or authority in sealing a document or container, the same iconographie message would have been important. Derivative Style cylinder seals, however, have been thought not to have played a significant role in sealing practices.25 Elaborate Style seals, by contrast, frequently bear Cypro-Minoan inscriptions, come from contexts that are plausibly associated with economic transactions, and appear rolled on administrative documents on Cyprus and in Syria.26 There is even some evidence for the use of Common Style seals for administrative purposes.27 What is particularly intriguing about the Derivative Style cylinder from Tel Batash is the presence of at least two Cypro-Minoan signs, carved as part of the original seal decoration.28 Cypro-Minoan signs occur rarely on seals of this style, being most common on seals of Elaborate Style and appearing often on the highly schematic seals of Common Style. Whether or not these marks indicate a use of the Tel Batash cylinder for sealing, they raise the question of the significance of Derivative Style seals in connection with signs, phonetic or otherwise, and recording generally. Until the discovery of the Tel Batash cylinder, only one seal of Derivative Style had been found to bear a Cypro-Minoan sign. It too appears to have been part of the original seal decoration. It was found by Cesnola at Kourion and shows a goddess with a lion and a tree.29 One example from Daniel's excavations at Episkopi- Bamboula (Kourion) bears a mark carved later, which obscures part of the seal's design. The marks on the Tel Batash cylinder seal resemble signs that are common in the Cypro-Minoan repertoire. The pronged Y-shaped mark between the deity's head and the tree compares with sign No. 83. 30 Perhaps significantly, it is this mark that also appears between the head of the deity and the tree on the Cesnola example. The V-shaped mark to the right of her head resembles sign No. 48. A mark behind the head of the goat may be a schematic bird, but it might equally well be a +-shaped mark comparing with sign No. 5. All are symmetrical signs and thus indicate nothing about whether they were meant to be read on the seal or not.31 The shape of the trident on the deity's necklace compares with sign No. 17. No seals other than the two Derivative Style examples cited here bear sign No. 83. This sign is particularly interesting because it appears frequently on a group of Cypro-Minoan documents found in a building complex used for the production and storage of olive oil at Kalavasos-Ãy/os Dhimitrios?1 This sign is repeated and coupled with similar signs with varying numbers of prongs, or leaves, at the top. It remains to be determined whether the appearance of sign No. 83 as a single mark on the seals in association with trees is related to the sign's appearance at Kalavasos in the context of olive oil production. If any meaning for the sign could be derived from these contextual associations, it would be a significant advance in our understanding of the structure and meaning of the Cypro-Minoan script. A ring loop from Enkomi33 bears a single sign resembling No. 48 separated from three other signs by a blank space. At the moment there is no special significance associated with this mark. Sign No. 5 is frequent in all media that bear Cypro- Minoan inscriptions. It is a similar +-mark that obscures part of the caprid on the Derivative Style seal from Episkopi -Bamboula. Other +-marks appear above a caprid on a seal from Kition,34 below a caprid on a seal from Kourion,35 and behind a caprid on a seal from Politiko.36 Although from these four examples and the cylinder from Tel Batash it appears that there is an association between the +-mark and the caprid, the mark also appears at the end of a sign sequence next to a bird on a ring from Kition37 and at the end of a sign sequence behind a lion on a cylinder seal without provenance.38 Possibly the single sign has some meaning for the caprid, but the mark is not complex and, until more is understood about Cypro-Minoan, it would be unwise to draw too far-reaching a conclusion. The trident mark, No. 17, is equally frequent on all media, including seals. It appears in sequences of 247</page><page sequence="254">CHAPTER NINE signs on seals from Ayia Paraskevi,39 Enkomi,40 Hala Sultan Tekke,41 Kourion,42and Pyla-V&lt;?rg/ii,43as well as on cylinders that unfortunately have no record of provenance.44 It does not occur as a single mark on seals. The trident is unlikely to be anything but a rendering of the deity's jewelry on the Tel Batash cylinder. Although it is not yet possible to draw specific conclusions about the meaning of individual Cypro- Minoan signs on the Tel Batash cylinder, or indeed individual marks and groups of Cypro-Minoan signs on any seals, the marks on the Tel Batash cylinder indicate that further study is warranted. Filling motifs, including potential Cypro-Minoan signs, on seals are sometimes given only brief mention in seal studies. The occurrence and reoccurrence of symbols, however, are undoubtedly clues to the significance of individual scenes on seals and the meaning of groups of seals carved in the same or similar ways.45 Study of the Tel Batash Derivative Style cylinder seal shows that it was a meaningful symbol of authority created within the context of Cypriot glyptics of the 14th century BCE. It may well have carried with it a sphragistic meaning, as indicated by how it was worn. That it was associated with meaningful iconographie and written symbols is clear, whether these were meant to be seen only on the seal or also in clay. It was most certainly viewed as a valued and possibly protective personal ornament for both its maker and its final owner. NOTES 1 Webb 1989: 114 demonstrated that the figures on seals of this type are likely to be female, based on details that are plausible renderings of breasts on a cylinder seal from Ayia Irini -Paleokastro (Pecorella 1977: 89, Fig. 211, Tomb 11, No. 107). Wings on the same figure on the Ayia Irini seal suggested to Webb that the figure is a deity best interpreted as the "Mistress of the Animals" because of her association with animals. 2 This tree is possibly an olive tree, complete with the characteristic abundant branches and the lumpy base, albeit a schematic one. Porada (1988) discusses the appearance of more naturalistic olive trees in Cypriot wood and ivory carving in the context of seal impressions from Maa -Palaeokastro. It is, however, possible that the tree on the Tel Batash cylinder represents a stylized palm tree. Several trees on cylinder seals are clearly palm trees, with details of the palm fronds and the shaggy skirt of dead leaves. If the tree here is a palm, the lower curves may represent a container rather than part of the tree itself. On the sacred tree see Meekers 1987. 3 Robert Merrillees, now compiling a corpus of cylinder seals in the Cyprus Museum with Helen Merrillees, comments that Costas Xenophontas has shown that the soft stone of which many Cypriot seals were made is chlorite. In the past this stone was thought to be steatite and was often published as steatite without consulting a geologist. Both chlorite and steatite would have been imports to Cyprus. Merrillees reported on the materials of which Cypriot seals were made in an unpublished lecture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, on April 2000, '"Ex Oriente Lux': Near Eastern Contributions to the Art and Culture of Cyprus." 4 Collon ( 1 987 : 1 10) discusses seals worn in this fashion. I have summarized other evidence for Cypriot seals worn in this way (Smith 2002: 7). 5 Webb (2002: 117-126) readdresses the three main groupings of Late Bronze Age Cypriot cylinder seals, Elaborate, Derivative, and Common style. These names derive from Porada's similar classification of Mitannian glyptics (1947). 6 MacAlister 1912: PI. 214:14; Lamon and Shipton 1939: PI. 66:12; Elgavish 1977: PI. 22:C. 7 Webb 1989: 114. 8 Pecorella 1977: 22, Fig. 32, Tomb 3, No. 17; 89, Fig. 211, Tomb 11, No. 107 (both tombs date to the Late Cypriot IA:2 to IB:2 period). 9 For example, see a worn example from the 13th century BCE found at Enkomi, Porada 1971: 791, Pl. 182A.4b (No. 1694). 10 Porada 1972. 11 Cesnola 1903: PI.

See above, n. 2, on the identification of the tree on the Tel Batash cylinder as either an olive or a palm tree. 14 Crowley 1989: 38. 15 Crowley (1989: 35) notes that both control and nourishment of animals are characteristics of the early Near Eastern form of the Mistress of the Animals. 16 Porada 1973: 262. 17 Smith m press a. 18 For example, see Buchanan 1957: 92-93, PI.

Their appearance on both Elaborate and Derivative Style cylinder seals show them in roles as helpers to a deity. 24 Porada 1990: 340, Fig. 125, Tomb II, No. 107. 25 Webb (2002) argues for an administrative role of the seals as objects given in a system of wealth finance. 26 Smith (2002: 10-16) discusses the evidence available for the use of Cypriot seals as administrative tools. Although there is some evidence for the administrative use of Common Style cylinders, the evidence for the use of Elaborate Style cylinders as sealing tools is more frequent. 27 Smith 2002: 11-12, Fig. 2. 28 On seals with Cypro-Minoan seals see Masson 1957 and Smith 2002: 10-16. 29 Cesnola 1903: PL CXX:13; Porada 1948: PL IX, No. 27. 30 Although the current Cypro-Minoan sign system contains some inaccuracies, the signs on the cylinder are common enough that the numbering of signs as laid out by E. Masson is useful. The numbering of signs here uses those on the lists in Masson 1974: 13-15, Figs. 2-4. 31 Traces of wear on the cylinder, as noted above, indicate that the seal was probably worn in a Near Eastern fashion to keep the seal loose for rolling on clay. 32 Smith 2002: 20-25; 2003: 283-285. 33 Courtois 1984: 52, Fig. 16:1, Pl.

VIIB (PL 51:17; Photo 104). H 12.4 cm; W 5.3 cm; Th 2.1 cm. IAA No. 2001-2232 (currently in the Israel Museum's permanent exhibition, on loan from the IAA). A very well preserved and fine example of a female plaque figurine, made of light reddish yellow clay with a gray core and many inclusions. Color photo: Keim and Mazar 1995: 83, Color Plate C8. The female figure is shown standing in a frontal posture, holding a lotus flower with a long stem in each hand. She has a narrow waist, large breasts and wide thighs; the legs are particularly long in comparison to other LB figurines and the feet are turned to the side. She has a fine Hathor coiffure exposing the ears. She wears a crescent-shaped necklace composed of a series of small circles (seen better in other casts from the same mold, see below) and three bracelets on each of her wrists and ankles. A simple oval ridged frame surrounds the figure. Since the figurine has no facial features, the mold did not contain any details of the face. Two fragmentary plaque figurines from the Reifenberg collection (today in the possession of the Israel Antiquities Authority and exhibited in the Israel Museum) were made in the same mold as our figurine (Photo 105). Both are preserved to a height of 8.5 cm and both are broken at the same place, above the knees. On the latter, the face was left blank, while on the former, eyes, nose and mouth were incised after the figurine was taken out from the mold and before firing. On both of these fragments the details of the necklace are more clearly seen than in on our example. Two fragments of figurines from Gezer may have been made from the same mold as well (Macalister 1912: Pis. CCXX:20; CCXXL16). Our figurine belongs to a well-known type of LB clay plaque figurines from Canaan, depicting a naked female standing in a frontal posture with feet to the side and holding lotus flowers (for parallels see Pritchard 1943: 32-37, 41; Tadmor 1982: 161-163, Pis. 10; 10a; for discussion and an example from the Hecht collection; see also Tadmor 2003). For a list of plaque figurines with Hathor headdress, see Kletter 1996: 270-27 1 , Appendix 5.V.2. This list includes 33 examples, 22 of them from unclear contexts at Gezer and the others from Megiddo, Taanach, Lachish, Tell Abu Hawam, Tell el-Hesi and Tell Jemmeh. However, his list does not include the six examples from the LB stratum at Tell Beit Mirsim C TBMII : Pis. 25:1-2, 4; 26:1, 3, 5). More recently, three figurines of this type were found at Tel Harassim in the lower Shephelah, two of them showing the goddess standing on the back of a crouching lion (Givon 2002: 27*, Fig. 2:1; 28*, Fig. 3:1). In most of these parallels the female has a narrower body than in our example and the workmanship is inferior. Similar female figures appear on bronze and gold plaques; in some of these the figure is standing on an animal (Tadmor 1982: 161; Ben-Arieh and Edelstein 1977: 29-30 for a bronze plaque from 'Akko; Clamer 1988 for the gold plaque from Lachish). As shown by Tadmor (1982), this figurine type should be distinguished from plaque figurines depicting naked women with their arms held along the body or holding their breasts, which have regular human coiffures. The latter have no attributes of deities and were explained by Tadmor as depicting women lying on beds, like the Egyptian "concubine" figurines (this interpretation is rejected, however, by Keel and Uhlinger 1998: 97-108). Our figurine clearly belongs to the group of plaque figurines that represent a standing fertility goddess. The identification of this goddess remains obscure. Though the term "Astarte figurine" is quite common, the identification of the female deity represented in these figurines with the goddess Astarte remains tentative. Tadmor (1982: 161-164) emphasized this difficulty, citing the Egyptian stela from the Winchester College collection in which such a figure is identified in the 251</page><page sequence="258">CHAPTER TEN Photo 104. Plaque figurine (Reg. No. B 10273). hieroglyphic inscription by the three names Qudshu- Astarte-'Anat. Asherah, the other Canaanite goddess, could also be considered (for general discussion and references see Kletter 1996: 74-76 in relation to Iron Age figurines; Givon 2002: 33*-34*). It seems that these figurines served in daily life as representations of Canaanite fertility goddesses, perhaps used by women in a domestic fertility cult. 2. Plaque figurine Reg.

In our example the female could not have held the flower in her hands, and thus the hands perhaps supported the breasts. If this hypothesis is correct, then this plaque</page><page sequence="259">CLAY FIGURINES AND A ZOOMORPHIC VESSEL Photo 106. Plaque figurine (Reg.

The nose is protruding and triangular in section, with a red stripe down its front. The chin is almost imperceptible in profile. The upper part of the head is diagonally cut, recalling the Aegean polos headdress. This head could belong to an "Ashdoda" figurine (Dothan 1982: 234-237), though it differs from these figurines in several aspects. The face is somewhat taller than is usual in Ashdoda" figurines, in which the face is shorter and more clearly distinguished from the neck. The painting on the nose and mouth (or chin?) of our figurine is unusual. Our figurine does, however, recall a similar head from Ashdod Area H, Stratum XI ( Ashdod VI: Pl. III.47: 1), though in the latter the polos is clearer. It is difficult to decide whether these two figurines represent males or females; while the chin decoration of both appears to depict a (bearded?) male, the polos headdress is typical of females in the Aegean world. Other Philistine figurines with similar headgear can be cited (Dothan 1982: 226, Fig. 5, Pl. 12 from Tell es-Safi; Ashdod I : Fig. 26:3, a topsoil find), though they are not identical to our figurine. A figurine from 'Afula Stratum III (an Iron I level with Philistine painted pottery) depicts a male figure in a style that to some extent recalls ours; it too is painted in red (Dothan 1955: 64, Fig. 15: 19). Our figurine is clearly rooted in Aegean and Cypriot traditions. Several male Mycenaean figures recall our figurine. One is a figurine in the University of Illinois Museum (Mylonas 1937), cited by M. Dothan as a comparison to the figurine from 'Afula, which certainly resembles our figurine in its large nose and general appearance. Ben-Shlomo compares the figurine from Ashdod to a figurine head from Philakopi (French 1985: 217, Fig. 6.5), defined by French as female despite the painted chin that might be viewed as a beard. Other figurines from Philakopi clearly depict males (French 1985: Figs. 6.12-6.14). Hollow clay figurines from Enkomi are very similar to our figurine in their facial features, headdress and decoration, though painted in only one color (Courtois 1984: 78, Nos. 782, 784, PL 194:6, 9 [the former from LC III and the latter from LC II contexts]; Dikaios 1969: Pis. 131:31; 162:34 [from Level IIIA]; Karageorghis 1993: 30-32). The similarity to the Cypriot examples in terms of facial features and decoration is striking, and should be regarded as an additional aspect of the close relationship between the Philistine culture and Cyprus. The Cypriot figurines themselves may, however, be rooted in Mycenaean 253</page><page sequence="260">CHAPTER TEN tradition, like the figurines cited above. It is thus certain that our figurine belongs to the Philistine material culture and, like many other features, points to the Mycenaean and Cypriot roots of this culture. 4. Zoomorphic vessel Reg. No. 3154; Area B, Locus 313, Building 313; level 29.81; Str. V (Pl. 62:17; Photo 108). H 7.3 cm; L 7.3 cm; W 6.5 cm. Grayish brown clay with a gray core, some small white and gray grits and a few large white and gray grits. Color photo: Keim and Mazar 1995: 82, Color Plate Cl 9. The hollow head and neck depict a bull. The head is roughly triangular in shape; while the mouth and the nose are particularly narrow; the animal has upright horns (broken) and small ears underneath them. The head does not have an opening at the front and thus, unlike most other clay animal heads, did not serve as the spout of a libation vessel. It must have belonged to a large zoomorphic vessel of some sort. A close parallel is a bull's head from Tell Beit Mirsim Str. C or B (TBM III : 15, Pis. 29:3; 55:4). Large bull vessels are known from 12th-century Cyprus (Dikaios 1969: PI. 170:13), and these may have inspired our vessel. 5. Fragment of pottery cult object (?) Reg.

Such discs are found at many other sites in MB and later contexts. At Hazor and Gezer they were defined as buttons ( Hazor II: PI. 89:16; Gezer IV : PI. 57:20, from the Iron Age). Van Beek identified them as "buzz toys" (Van Beek 1989; Shanks 1991). Shamir suggested that such objects were used for weaving narrow strips of cloth in what is referred to as "tablet weaving" (Shamir 1996: 148-149, 167, Fig. 22:2-3, defined as "Tablets with Two Holes", Type A3g).

PENDANTS BONE AND IVORY PENDANTS The following three pendants were found together in Locus E602 (Square J-27), a locus consisting of brick debris that was attributed to Str.

Such bone pendants are known in Israel only in Iron II {Timnah II : 262-263). The faience amulet found in the same locus (Chapter VII) should perhaps be dated to Iron II as well.

BEADS Glass appeared at Tel Batash as early as Str. IX, though represented only by a single poorly preserved bead from Building 715 made of a vitreous material that may be identified as glass (Table 62:1). Two others were found in the Str. VIII Building 475 (Table 62:2-3). A much larger number of glass beads was found in Str. VII, in which 60 beads that may have belonged to the same necklace were found in the main hall of Building 315 (Table 62:7-66; Photo 131). The beads were found high in the destruction debris of the building and therefore probably fell from an upper floor (see Chapter IV).

Of the original beads, 55 are now displayed in the permanent exhibition of ancient glass in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, reconstructed as one necklace. Mrs. Maud Spaer carried out a visual identification of the raw material and decoration. The following is based on her study. Most of the beads were identified as heavily weathered glass beads, though Nos. 7, 13, 25 and 59 were identified as probably being made of faience and others could only generally be characterized as being made from vitreous (or siliceous) materials. Faience, unlike glass, is always shaped while cold (in a pasty state) and only subsequently fired. It has a glazed outer layer formed during firing which differs from its more or less gritty interior (Spaer 2001 : 308-309). Among the beads were also several made of stone, possibly including carnelian, agate and hematite, and a single one made of metal. According to Spaer (2001 : 45), most of the glass beads were probably rod-formed by winding, a technique characteristic of the LB. No. 38, however, appears to be folded; folded beads were made from a premanufactured strip of glass that was folded over a rod and closed with a seam (Spaer 2001: 309). Almost all the beads are either spheroid or cylindrical. They were most likely monochrome, made of bluish, greenish blue, or sometimes brownish glass, now much weathered. Decoration was observed on several of the beads. This decoration was applied by adding glass to the basic glass bead to form either eyes (circular decoration) or trails (linear decoration). The latter is more common among the beads from Tel Batash and generally a more common decoration on second-millennium beads. Most decorative trails were applied across the perforation axis, either in short lengths with a single stripe effect (such as No. 21), or spirally, producing a multiple stripe effect (Nos. 14, 20, 24, 27, 29, 34 and 50; see Spaer 2001: 52, Fig. 21). The spiral was often dragged to form patterns such as zigzags and scallops (Nos. 24 and 34; see Spaer 2001: 53, Fig. 22). Local manufacture of glass objects, unlike frit and faience objects, is not attested in the second millennium, though it may well have taken place (Spaer 2001 : 25-26). The more sophisticated varieties of LB trail-decorated beads were probably manufactured in either Syria- Mesopotamia or Egypt (Spaer 2001: 99). The eye motif was found on only two of the beads (No. 49 and 55). It was probably made from layers of contrasting colors that were superimposed in diminishing sizes (Spaer 2001: 52). The smallest, top layer formed the central eye spot, with the lower layers appearing in concentric circles (the eye rings) on the surface of the bead. Beads decorated with this type of motif ("eye beads") were commonly seen as apotropaic, with their primary function being that of protecting against the Evil Eye. The earliest are reported from western Asia, starting in the second half of the 15th century or in the first half of the 14th century. This corresponds to the chronological framework of our Str. VIII-VII, in which most of our beads were found. Though these beads are found in earlier contexts in Mesopotamia than in Egypt, where they become common only in the Ramesside period, they are far more frequent in Egypt than in Mesopotamia (Spaer 2001: 78). However, this must be due to contingencies of excavation in each region. Beads found at LB sites in Canaan such as Megiddo, Beth-Shean and Lachish generally reflect Mesopotamian styles (Spaer 2001: 25, 77-79). The beads from Tel Batash, however, cannot specifically be attributed to either the Mesopotamian or the Egyptian tradition. REFERENCES Keim, G. and Mazar, A. 1995. Timnah . Winona Lake.

Table 63 includes bowls, mortars and bowlets, Table 64 includes pestles and hammerstones, and Table 65 includes lower and upper grinding stones. The typology follows that of Hovers (1996). Mortars are defined as such by their thickness and shallow depression, in contrast to bowls, in which the opening takes up most of the object. Similarly, cupmarks differ from bowlets in their small opening (Hovers 1996: 173). The many pestles found at Tel Batash are extremely diverse. The shapes include conical, hemispherical, or roughly square, all of which may have been used in conjunction with stone bowls or mortars. Others, larger and shaped in various forms, were probably used on flat surfaces of some kind. Three unique objects made of highly polished compacted basalt, from Locus 467 in Building 475, Stratum VII, were possibly used as weights (see Chapter XIII). Hammerstones are fist-sized stones made of either flint or quartzite with a pecked surface that is probably the result of the initial shaping of the stone (Hovers 1996: 179). These stones are roughly spheroid, although some have large flat surfaces created by chipping. Some are squared, most likely as a result of usage. Nos. 12-13 in Table 64 are spheroids that are exceptional in being made of dolomite; they are unpecked and smoothed, with light scratches on the surface. The larger grinding stones are mostly fragmentary, made usually of basalt but in some cases from beach rock. Notably, a number of grinding stones in the Iron II strata at Tel Batash were also made of beach rock, though it was not common ( Timnah II: 232). While this type of upper grinding stone is loaf- shaped, the lower ones are either loaf-shaped or in the Photo 132. Dolomite mortar from Building 720 (Reg. No. 4825). Photo 133.

Typical of all the lower grinding stones are the polished upper surface, which is relatively larger than that of the upper grinding stones, and the cruder lower surface. The stone objects are all domestic in nature and were probably used in daily activities that were mainly food- related. However, in several of the bowls and on some of the working surfaces of grinding stones and pestles, traces of a red substance, possibly ochre, were detected. This suggests a medicinal or cosmetic use for at least some of the stones. REFERENCE Hovers, E. 1996. The Groundstone Industry. Pp. 171-203 in: Ariel, D. T. and De Groot, A. (eds.).

Kletter While large series of inscribed weights and some written sources about Iron Age metrology in Judah (Barkay 1978; Scott 1985; Kletter 1998; Kletter forthcoming) exist, very little is known about LB weights and weight- systems in Canaan. Since any stone can serve as a unit of weight, working with uninscribed material forces us to define what an ancient scale weight is. This is a crucial step that determines many of the conclusions of a study. Most ancient scale weights follow quite strict rules. Their weight should fit a unit of an ancient weight-system within a margin of up to 3-5%, due to lack of accuracy in weighing (JoannÃ¨s 1989; Kletter 1998: 71). Acertain weight might perhaps belong to an unknown system that is not yet documented, but this would be a rare case and must be defined by features in addition to weight. Spatial and temporal connections must exist between the sites under discussion (for example, a Bronze Age weight from Tel Batash cannot be explained as a weight-unit from Medieval Europe, even if mathematically they are equal). In the ancient Near East of the late second millennium BCE, there were about half a dozen major weight-systems based on a unit (often called "shekel") in the range of 7-12 grams. Each system had a different set of multiples and sub-units (decimal in Egypt, sexigesimal in Mesopotamia, etc.), and most of the systems were connected at certain values (see Parise 1981; 1991). Hence, a certain weight-value often fits more than one system and we cannot identify the system by weight * The study of the Late Bronze Age weights of Tel Batash was initiated by A. Eran, who arranged the material and weighed it, but unfortunately did not live to see the study completed. The present paper uses much of his data, and I wish to express my deep debt to him. A. Mazar kindly asked me to complete the study and assisted with advice and encouragement. My warm thanks as well to N. Yahalom-Mack and N. Panitz-Cohen for their hospitality and for the data and assistance in treating the objects. alone. Weights had defined shapes, usually geometric in order to make fraud more difficult, and were made of certain materials (not too light or porous, not too hard or fragile). Furthermore, weights had to remain stable on the pans during weighing and a flat base/side was therefore required. Following this reasoning, only one of the objects from Tel Batash discussed here (No. 1) is certainly a weight; the rest are defined as possible weights or other stone objects. Some details about the objects are given in the table and are not repeated in the text. 1. Carinated dome weight Reg. No. 4007; Locus 431; Str. VIA (PL 60:20; Photo 138). Weight: 89.45 g. Unit: 1 Dbn. This is a limestone weight with carinated sides. The limestone is whitish gray, worked into a symmetrical dome. The surface is slightly worn, perhaps by fire. There is a small round depression on the larger flattened side, the other side being smaller than usual and not completely flat. Carinated dome weights are typical of Egypt (Kletter 1998: 118-119; Cour-Marty 1985; 1990). The value of this weight is 1 Dbn , a well-known and common unit used not only in Photo 138. Carinated dome weight (PI. 60:20). 275</page><page sequence="282">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Photo 139. Worked pebble (PL 47:3). Photo 141. Stone weights? (a: PL 33:11; b: PL 33:12; c: PL 33:13). Photo 140. Pestle? (Reg. No. 4978). Egypt but all over the ancient Near East (Parise 1981; 1991; Cour-Marty 1985: 190-195). 2. Worked pebble Reg. No. 3996; Locus 315; Str. VII (Pl. 47:3; Photo 139). Weight: 25.58 g. An elliptical, brown stone (limestone?), polished and symmetrical. The weight could fit, roughly, three Mesopotamian shekels (of ca. 8.4 g each; cf. Powell 1979), but this is not a scale weight, since it lacks a stable base or side. 3. Pestle? Reg. No. 4978; Locus 494; Str. VIII; see Table 64:8 (Photo 140). Weight: 837.2 g. A rounded stone with two flattened sides, made of hard, mottled whitish gray limestone. The "base" but not the top is polished. Though Eran believed that this is a weight of 100 Mesopotamian shekels, the Mesopotamian system was not decimal and for such a heavy weight units of Mina (=60 shekels) would have been used. Hence, an interpretation of this object as a pestle is more plausible. 4. Weight? Reg. No. 4123; Locus 437; Str. VII. Weight: 1136.19 g. A rounded semi-hemispherical stone with a stable, flat base, made of porous, hard gray limestone. The weight might fit 100 shekels of ca. 1 1 .36 g.; or 120 shekels of ca. 9.468 g.; or 140 (an unlikely multiple) Mesopotamian shekels of ca. 8.116 g.; or 150 shekels of ca. 7.575 g. The next three objects (Nos. 5-7) are similar in material and irregularity of form and were all found in Locus 467, a room in Building 475 of Str. VIII, dated to LB IB. Since they form a group, one would one expect that, if they are weights, they would belong to the same system. This does not seem to be the case, and hence their identification as weights remains an open question. They are also discussed above in Chapter XII. 5. Weight? Reg. No. 4361; Locus 467; Str. VIII; see Table 64:5 (PL 33:11; Photo 141a). Weight: 383.2 g. A grayish black compacted basalt (?) object, with one stable side. The shape is an irregular oval, very remotely reminiscent of Mesopotamian duck- shaped weights. Around the circumference, on all sides, is a smoothed "belt" of a lighter gray color. The weight can fit 50 shekels of 7.664 g, though the pattern of polish on the sides better fits a pestle. 6. Weight? Reg. No. 4410; Locus 467; Str. VIII; see Table 64:6 (Pl. 33:12; Photo 141b). 276</page><page sequence="283">WEIGHTS Weight: 485.5 g. A greenish black compacted basalt (?) object. The shape is an irregular triangle, with one narrow side neatly cut and clearly worked (i.e. not natural). It lacks a stable side/base. The two rounded edges are slightly worn, a pattern that fits pestle stones. Eran suggested that this is a weight of 60 Mesopotamian shekels of 8.092 g (=1 Mina). 7. Weight? Reg. No. 4360, Locus 467; Str. VIII; see Table 64:7 (PL 33:13; Photo 141c). Weight: 582+X g. A grayish black compacted basalt (?) object with black grains. The shape is an irregular cushion. There is a smoothed "belt" of area of lighter gray color around the circumference of the narrow ends. A large break (made in antiquity) is apparent, indicating that the weight was originally heavier. Eran thought that this is a weight of 40 Phoenician shekels of 14.55 g ("Phoenician" used by him only in a geographical sense). However, the Tyrian shekel of 14 g is much later, and it would perhaps be better to assume the early unit of ca. 7.6 g used in Phoenicia (for this unit see Kletter 1994; for later Phoenician weights see Elayi and Elayi 1997). In summary, the LB and Iron Age I assemblage at Tel Batash contains very few possible weights and only one certain weight. Conspicuous is the complete lack of the easily identifiable "classical" sphenoid or grain-shaped weights. These are common during the LB in Canaan (Segal 1971; Kletter 1997: 118; James and McGovern 1993: 194, etc.). Written data on these weights are scarce, though one document from Ugarit defines the Talent of Ashdd, commonly identified with Ashdod (Liverani 1972; Ben David 1979; for a different suggestions see Na'aman 1998). Much work remains to be done on collecting and analyzing all the weights from Bronze Age Canaan, in order to reconstruct the Canaanite weight system(s) and economic activities. APPENDIX: AN ISLAMIC BRONZE WEIGHT A bronze weight in the shape of a faceted truncated spheroid was found on the surface in Area B (Reg. No. 3694, Locus 383; Fig. 31; height 8 mm, diameter 13 mm, weight 8.15 g). The face is covered with three rows of interlocking polygons, composed of a central row of hexagonal facets bordered by rows of pentagonal facets. Each facet has a bird's eye in its center. The base and upper side are flat, and decorated by concentric circles with small bird's eyes/circles as fillers. This is a typical medieval Islamic weight, possibly Fatimid or Ayyubid. Similar weights are known from a large collection from Caesarea, studied by Holland (1986: 174, Nos. 40-52; his term "polyhedra" is after a few of these weights, which have the appearance of a peeled orange; for Mamluk bronze weights see Schultz and Gitler 2000). The present weight is best identified as a weight of two Dinars. An almost exact comparison is known from Caesarea (Holland 1986: No. 47, 8.144 g, for the Dinar of ca. 4.19-4.25 g see pp. 183, 189 n. 38; Hinz 1955:1-2; Miles 1964; 1965). The reduction from the assumed norm is perhaps due to the corrosion that is typical of bronze weights, as demonstrated by Holland (1986: 179). 277 Fig. 3 1 .

Rosen Ben-Gurion University of the Negev INTRODUCTION Levantine lithic assemblages from the second and early first millennium BCE (Middle Bronze through Iron Ages) have been the subject of a number of analyses in recent years. These studies have focused on a somewhat limited number of analytic issues, including the nature of the lithic technological systems (e.g., Coqueugniot 1991), the organization of production and distribution (e.g., Rosen 1997: 1 1 1-112), the changing function of different types and assemblages (e.g., Rosen 1997: 151-166), and chronological issues (Bennett et al. 1989). This limited scope is especially striking when compared to studies of chipped stone from the preceding fourth and third millennia BCE (late Chalcolithic and EB). These have been the focus of much more intensive research, from a significantly larger set of perspectives, ranging from ethnicity and stylistic change, through chronologies, function, technology, subsistence systems, the organization of manufacture and distribution, typological change, etc., in essence covering the full range of questions usually addressed when studying ancient material culture (see Rosen 1997 with references). This general disparity in research range and foci stems from two primary factors. First, there is an unquestionable decline in the intensity of chipped stone tool use following the EB (Rosen 1996; 1997: 151-166). This decline is reflected both in the quantity of materials recovered and in the range of types (read functions) defined. Thus, as a matter of course, questions that can be asked of these materials will be more limited. Second, the difficulties in establishing good contexts for most of the lithic artifacts recovered from the middle and upper layers of Middle Eastern occupation mounds often render cultural and chronological attribution problematic. The intensive cycles of construction and destruction on these mounds, and the fact that most lithic artifacts are recovered from non-primary contexts such as fills, means that although they can be dated roughly, precise attribution of assemblages is not possible (Rosen 1997: 34-38). The degree of intrusion and mixture in these later periods seems greater than in earlier periods. Despite these caveats, the study of the lithic assemblages from the post-EB periods is of interest. Aside from the inherent importance of detailed description of ancient lifeways, including all ancient technologies, the issues mentioned above (chronologies, function and the organization of production) are important for comprehension of the larger historical picture. The materials from Tel Batash constitute an important addition to our database. Although the assemblage is relatively small, comprising just over 1000 artifacts, the high proportion of waste (ca. 75%) indicates that it does not suffer from significant collection bias. Given the absence of microlithic industries from these later periods, the absence of sieved samples should not be a major biasing factor either. The non-recovery of microdebitage resulting from small-scale reduction and retouch is, of course, regrettable. However, the analytic utility of such materials from non-primary contexts like fills, from which most of the lithics were recovered, is virtually nil. Furthermore, the close stratigraphie control, especially of the Iron Age strata, allows more detailed examination of the later period metal-flint replacement process. The Tel Batash materials strongly suggest that by the 9th century BCE sickle segments had dropped out of the lithic repertoire and that lithic manufacture was restricted to rare ad hoc production, and perhaps the use of strike-a-lights (e.g., Runnells 1994), not documented in these lithic assemblages. The use of flint teeth in threshing sledges, well documented in recent times (e.g., McCartney 1993; Whittaker 2000; Bordaz 1967; Ataman 1992; Whallon 1978), and indicated in ancient texts (e.g., Adams 1975), has not been established on the basis of actual ancient assemblages. 281</page><page sequence="287">CHAPTER FOURTEEN DESCRIPTION The waste and tool type frequencies of the Tel Batash lithic assemblage are presented by period in Tables 66-67. A detailed review follows below. Since the absence of obvious typological and technological contrasts between the materials derived from different strata renders separate description of the materials according to period rather redundant, for the purposes of general typological and technological review the entire assemblage has been lumped together. Analysis of the inter-period evolution of the industries is presented in the succeeding discussion. RAW MATERIALS Although the raw materials used for the production of chipped stone tools at Tel Batash are all local, they reflect two different strategies of exploitation. The medium to fine-grained brown flint usually identified with Eocene geological strata dominates the sickle assemblage. The selection of this raw material for sickles is typical of the period (Hammond 1977; Rosen 1997: 32-34), resulting from the need for better-quality flint in larger packages for the production of medium-sized and larger standardized types, i.e., sickles. This raw material is not found in the immediate environs of the site, but is generally located in geological exposures on nearby hill slopes. The flake cores, waste, and other tools reflect a range of raw materials, including gray and brown flints, mottled flints, smaller nodules, and a greater range of grain (from coarse to fine) than that found in the sickles, and include pieces with faults of various kinds (e.g., internal fractures). Most of these materials are to be found in the immediate environs of the site, including gravels in Nahal Sorek. The wide range of materials from the vicinity of the site reflects an ad hoc procurement strategy for the non-sickle tools, in accordance with the ad hoc technologies of the general class. Finally, occasional Epipaleolithic and Chalcolithic intrusions, specifically bladelet cores, bladelets, and bladelet tools, were manufactured on fine-grained Table 66.

The raw nodules for this material can be found in local wadi gravels. These nodules are generally small and thus are not appropriate for most of the later industries, despite the high quality of the material. WASTE The waste assemblage, excluding the debris (chips and chunks), can be characterized as an ad hoc small flake industry and is typical of post-Neolithic assemblages. Flakes are unstandardized and generally less than 3 cm in length. With the exception of the two intrusive (EB) Canaanean blades, the few blades are undoubtedly by-products of ad hoc flake production, rather than a specialized technology. They too are small and unstandardized, generally less than 5 cm in length. Bladelets are either blades at the small end of the blade/ flake spectrum or (in most cases) intrusive, attributable to either the Chalcolithic or the Epipaleolithic. The eight cores reflect a similar picture of either intrusion or ad hoc technology. One is technologically Levallois and with its heavy patina can be attributed to the Middle Paleolithic. Five are bladelet cores, all intrusive to the post-EB levels where they were found. One of these is exhausted and very small, and another is highly patinated. The remaining two are small amorphous flake cores, matching the flake assemblage in both their simple technology and their small size. They are clearly not by-products of sickle production. The single core trimming element was a rolled and patinated ridge blade, also clearly intrusive. The only exception to this picture of unstandardized ad hoc flake manufacture is represented by the 16 "sickle flakes". These are larger flakes, usually 4-6 cm in length, of medium to fine-grained flint matching that of the large geometric sickle segments. These flakes seem to represent unretouched blanks for the production of large geometric sickle segments. These pieces have been most obviously documented in the Gezer flint caches (Rosen 1986), where hundreds were recovered in storage contexts. The cores for these pieces were not found. 283</page><page sequence="289">CHAPTER FOURTEEN TOOLS The tool assemblage can be divided into three distinct groups. First, the sickle assemblage (primarily the large geometric sickles) constitutes the only typologically standardized class attributable to the second and first millennia BCE. Second, ad hoc tools, consisting of a range of irregular retouched pieces (retouched flakes and blades, notches, denticulates, etc.) are also present, although in proportions considerably reduced from the preceding EB (Rosen 1989). Finally, the number of intrusive artifacts is not insignificant. The sickle segments constitute 76% of the stone tools recovered at Tel Batash; they are the largest tool class, as well as the only standardized type, present. The tools are functionally identifiable as sickles by the presence of sickle gloss or luster on one edge (or two) of the tools, and by a morphology appropriate for hafting into a handle to form the composite blade. Complete and reconstructable sickles have been recovered from several sites (e.g., Mozel 1983). Gloss has long been associated with cereal harvesting (e.g., Neuville 1934/5; Curwen 1930, 1935; Semenov 1976: 113-121; Witthoft 1967), and although similar lusters can be derived from other activities, like cutting cane, woodworking or even hoeing (e.g., Curwen 1935; Unger-Hamilton 1984), the controversies surrounding alternative explanations for gloss formation have focused on the periods associated with the origins of agriculture. In the later periods, there has been little question regarding the identification of glossy segments as sickles for reaping cereals. The identification of non-glossy segments as unused sickles is based on technological and typological identity with the glossy pieces. At Tel Batash the sickle segments can be classified into six types: Large Geometric segments (and blanks), Canaanean sickle segments, Backed Blade segments, Denticulated segments, Plain Blade sickles, and unidentifiable fragments. The distinctions between the types are typological, but are confirmed by the technological attributes summarized below. The Large Geometric segments (including the non-glossy pieces) totally dominate, comprising 85% of the sickle segment assemblage. This is the type characteristic of the post- EB. Other types are either intrusive, like the Canaanean sickles (EB) and the heavily denticulated segments (Early Pottery Neolithic), or perhaps ad hoc variants of the Large Geometric type, like plain blade sickles. In the Tel Batash context, the backed blade sickles, usually associated with the Chalcolithic, could conceivably be interpreted as one end of the spectrum of Large Geometric variability, although this is unlikely (Rosen 1997: 44-60 and references for typology). The three Denticulated sickles are characterized by the unique deep notching that defines their working edges. As indicated above, this type is diagnostic of the Early Pottery Neolithic. The segments average 38x16x6 mm in dimensions. One is denticulated on both longitudinal edges and two are backed (Fig. 32:2-3). One is bitruncated and other two have only single truncations. Gloss is present on all three, but none retain the bulb of percussion. The two Plain Blade sickle segments average 33x15x4 mm in dimensions. Both are truncated. One has a use-damaged working edge with gloss, while the second shows more intense serrated retouch but no gloss. This piece also retains the bulb of percussion. This simple type is not attributable to a specific period. Seven Canaanean sickles were recovered. These are prismatic blades snapped to form segments, which may be truncated but show little further modification before initial hafting. Edge retouch seems to be a function of the need for edge renewal or sharpening. This type is characteristic of the EB. Only two were complete enough to measure length, at 53 and 57 mm. Width averaged 21 Â±5 mm, and thickness 6Â±1 mm. One piece was backed with two truncations and flat working edge retouch (Fig. 32:6), perhaps the result of reworking and use in the Iron Age I. Two segments retain gloss on both working edges (Fig. 32:4), the remainder having only a single glossy edge. One of the double gloss pieces exhibits use damage on both edges. Two segments have fresh edges, indicating an absence of retouch and sharpening. Two more have edge damage on the glossy edge and one exhibits nibbling retouch. A bulb of percussion is present on only two pieces. Backed Blade sickle segments are small blades with abrupt retouch (backing) along one edge and gloss and retouch on the opposing edge; they are typically truncated on both ends. This is the diagnostic sickle type of the Chalcolithic period, although it grades into the Large Geometric type at the larger end of the spectrum of variability. At Tel Batash the five backed blade sickle segments average 42Â±8.9 x 16Â±2.6 x 5.2Â±1.9 mm in dimensions. One is broken and hence not included in the length calculations. Two have single truncations, two are bitruncated and one is not truncated at all. All have a single glossy edge and one evidences bulbar thinning. The remaining pieces lack bulbs of percussion. Large Geometric sickle segments, the diagnostic type for the post-EB, contrast technologically with all 284</page><page sequence="290">THE CHIPPED STONE ASSEMBLAGE Fig. 32.

These contrasts are especially evident in the average dimensions of the Large Geometric sickle segments: L=47.4Â±11.8 mm (n=94), W=29.9Â±7.2 mm (n=99), T=8.0Â±4.2 mm (n=99), differing significantly from the other types. Of further interest is the fact that the average L/W ratio, 1.7Â±0.5, essentially a measure of shape, also differs from other types, as does the average LxW, 14.5Â±6.0 sq. cm, a measure of size. Beyond metrics, 67 (of 99 reasonably complete segments) are backed. The backing retouch is bifacial on six segments, ventral on one, nibbled on five, natural cortex on two, partial (not covering the entire length of the segment) on eight, and typically dorsal on 45 segments. Of the 94 pieces with both ends intact, 64 are bitruncated, 20 have only single truncations and 10 have no truncations. The truncations are exclusively dorsal. The angle of the truncations relative to the working edge also defines the basic shape and orientation of the segment. The variation is detailed in Table 68, but in general upper-left/lower-right parallelograms (Fig. 32:7-8) are the most common shape, followed by simple rectangles (Fig. 32:9-10), and then a range of various types of trapezoids (Fig. 32:11-13) and triangles (Fig. 32: 15-16). This variation in shape can be interpreted functionally as reflecting the crescent shape of the composite sickle. Some of the trapezoid shapes undoubtedly represent the end pieces of the sickle. Working edge retouch ranges from fresh, unretouched edges, through edge damage, nibbling, and up to serration, reflecting intensive sharpening and resharpening. Large Geometric sickle blanks showing no gloss (Fig. 32:14), presumably lost or discarded before use, not surprisingly show significantly less intensive working edge retouch Table 68.

No other significant differences are evident between the blanks and the glossy sickles. The frequencies of the different degrees of retouch are summarized in Table 69. The heavy degree of use reflected in the dominance of the serrated category suggests that sickle segments were relatively valuable and therefore used intensively and not lightly discarded. Bulbar treatment seems to be an additional form of modification designed to facilitate hafting, along with backing and truncation. Bulbar thinning is present on 22 pieces. The bulb of percussion is retained on 18 pieces. It has been removed through truncation on the remaining segments. Finally, also in connection to hafting, nine pieces retain what appears to be plaster adhesive sticking to the backs of the segments. Previous studies of Large Geometric sickle assemblages have suggested the existence of technological trends spanning the MB through Iron Age (Rosen 1982). No such chronological trends were discernible in the Tel Batash assemblage. Although variation in the metric variables and shape frequencies was present between sub-assemblages deriving from the different periods, no chronological trend or pattern was associated with this variation. It is reasonable to conclude that much of this variation is the result of idiosyncratic tendencies on the part of individual knappers. The ad hoc tools are predominantly on small and irregular flakes. The largest subgroup consists of Notches and Denticulates, comprising eight denticulated flakes (multiple notching), seven notched flakes, and two notches on chunks. Two more pieces, a notched flake and a denticulated flake, are heavily abraded and probably intrusive. Retouched Flakes , showing evidence for edge modification but no standard shape nor technological 286</page><page sequence="292">THE CHIPPED STONE ASSEMBLAGE feature, form the second largest group of ad hoc tools. They include eight flakes with irregular retouch, one chip with retouch, one flake with abrupt retouch on one edge (truncation), and one massive retouched flake, greater than 10 cm in length. Three more flakes with retouch show significant abrasion or rolling, indicating that they are likely intrusions. Retouched Blades constitute the next group. These include three blades with irregularly nibbled edges, another with a crudely denticulated edge, one backed knife and one broken backed blade. The two intrusive pieces in this class are a retouched Canaanean blade (Fig. 32:5), typologically attributable to the EB, and one retouched blade with heavy patination. The Borer class consists of one awl on a blade, three awls on flakes, and one awl on the corner of a flake opposite a notch. All show a point produced with abrupt retouch along one or two edges. Only three Scrapers were recovered. All were on flakes. One is steep and the other two show flat retouch. One of the flat retouched scrapers is rolled and is probably intrusive. Beyond the Intrusive Elements indicated within the tool classes reviewed above, all of the bladelet tools are assumed to be intrusive, on the basis either of typological attributes, as in the case of micro-endscrapers (Gilead 1984) or heavy patina. Within the Varia class, a tabular scraper, a triangular transverse arrowhead and a partially polished ax (Fig. 32:1) were recovered. These are attributable to the Chalcolithic-EB, the Late Pottery Neolithic, and the Chalcolithic period respectively, based on their typological attributes. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The chipped stone assemblage from Tel Batash contributes to our understanding of the ancient society from several perspectives. Most obviously, the stone tools reflect specific functions. The sickle segments indicate clearly the importance of cereal agriculture in the Tel Batash economy throughout the site's occupation. Although more difficult to precisely define functionally, the ad hoc tools reflect a range of light domestic tasks, such as whittling, scraping and piercing (Rosen 1997: 86-92 and references). The production organization of the stone tools is also of interest. The specialized nature of sickle manufacture can be seen in the standardization of the type, the selection for specific raw materials, and the absence of cores reflecting on-site production. It is possible to reconstruct the Large Geometric sickle production sequence as follows: lÅ¡ Quarrying of selected flint nodules at as yet undiscovered quarry/workshop sites. 2. Reduction of flint nodules to cores and production of "sickle flakes" at these sites. 3. Transfer of the as yet unworked "sickle flakes" to Tel Batash, presumably by the people who quarried and knapped them. 4. Retouching of "sickle flakes" to form sickle segments, followed by hafting into wood or bone handles, at Tel Batash. The presence of special caches of sickle flakes and partially completed segments at Gezer (Rosen 1986) suggests that this stage was accomplished by the knappers, not the farmers who were the ultimate consumers. 5. Exchange with farmers, use, resharpening, loss and / or discard. The important point is the presence of specialists, perhaps better termed experts to avoid the connotations of the Childean term "craft specialist" (Childe 1951: 95-99). The modern-day expert-level production of flint threshing teeth for use in threshing sledges, in Turkey (Bordaz 1967; Ataman 1992) and Cyprus (McCartney 1993; Whittaker 2000), presents a likely analog for ancient sickle production. The primary difference is that threshing and production of threshing teeth are village- based, in contrast to the urban contexts of Tel Batash and other mound sites. On the other hand, it is possible to overstate the urban aspects when looking at ancient subsistence economies. The ad hoc tools present a contrasting picture in terms of production. These tools are lacking in standardization, reflect on-site production in the presence of both cores and other lithic waste associated with their production, are technologically simple, and lack evidence for repeated use in terms of resharpening or intensive wear. These attributes together suggest that ad hoc tools were expediently produced, of low value, quickly manufactured and equally lightly discarded. Finally, since they span a millennium of lithic production at the end of the era in which chipped stone tools played a regular role in everyday life, the materials from Tel Batash provide an opportunity to examine the processes of lithic decline in greater detail than is usually possible. Table 70 summarizes the rising proportion of sickles and declining frequency of ad hoc tools (Rosen 1997: 157-158) from the MB through the Iron Age. Considering that typical frequencies of sickles and ad 287</page><page sequence="293">CHAPTER FOURTEEN Table 70. Table of sickle and ad hoc tool proportions by general period.

The Tel Batash data in fact suggest that the final decline to the nadir of ad hoc tool use occurred between the MB and LB, continuing at a stable and low level into the Iron Age. The continued use of chipped stone sickle segments into the Iron Age has long been recognized (e.g., Guy and Engberg 1938; Crowfoot 1935, 1937), and the final disappearance of flint sickles from Levantine material culture marks the end of a technological continuum that began in the Paleolithic. Although the continued use of chipped stone into modern times has been noted in the form of threshing teeth (e.g., Ataman 1992; Bordaz 1967; McCartney 1993), strike-a-lights (Runnels 1994), and ritual implements (e.g., Rosen 1997: 1 1), these tools have yet to be identified in the archaeological record. Regardless, even if they are eventually confirmed in the archaeological, one may nevertheless assume that they played a much lesser role in everyday life in the Bronze and Iron Ages. Thus the question of the disappearance of sickle segments, and with them the few ad hoc tools still occasionally produced, is of interest, since this marks the real end of the Stone Age in the abandonment of stone tools and the full adoption of metal replacements. There has been some dispute as to the precise period of the replacement of flint sickles. For example, based on the study of the lithic assemblages from Tell el-Hesi, Bennett et al. (1989) have claimed that lithic production continued well into the Persian period. Despite the problematic nature of the mixed stratigraphie contexts of the "Persian period", lithic materials from Tell el-Hesi aside, analyses of the Tel Batash materials suggest a significantly different picture. Fig. 33 and Table 71 summarize the lithic totals from the LB II, Iron Age and Persian strata at Tel Batash, calibrated by number of excavation squares opened to account for differences in quantities of exposure.

IV) is clearly evident. Given the endemic presence of intrusions in occupation mound sites, the inescapable conclusion here is that lithic production and use ceased to be significant activities at Tel Batash after the 10th century BCE. Although it would be inappropriate to assume that this picture obtains at all other sites, it would be advisable, given the good stratigraphie and provenience control at Tel Batash, to re-evaluate the conclusions drawn for other sites in light of the analysis presented here.

In this area the stream flows in a broad and fertile alluvial valley. The climate prevailing in the region is a typical Mediterranean one, with a mean annual amount of precipitation of about 500 mm; measurements at neighboring Tal Shahar (map ref. 140. 1 34) are 488 mm (Meteorological Notes 1967). The present vegetation cover is mainly maquis and garigue, reflecting man's prolonged impact on the environment. MATERIAL AND METHODS Charred pieces of wood were collected from loci dating from the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, the Iron Age and the Persian period. Samples of 0.5-1 cubic cm were taken for analysis. Samples were aspirated in absolute- ethyl-alcohol, dipped in methyl-benzoate-celloidin for 24 hours, rinsed in benzene and transferred to paraffin at 50-55Â° C for 96 hours. Cross and longitudinal, tangential as well as radial sections, of 10-12 micron thickness, were prepared with a rotary microtome. Identification of the wood remains up to the species level was made from these sections, by comparison with reference sections prepared from recent, systematically identified species. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION All in all, 42 wood samples were gathered at Tel Batash. Of these samples, 3 originated in loci attributed to Str. XI (MB IIB), 35 from loci attributed to Str. X-VII (Late Bronze Age), 3 from loci attributed to Str. V-IVA (Iron I- II) and 1 from a locus attributed to Str. I (Persian period. Forty wood samples were of three woody species*. Quercus callÃ¬prinos (Kermes oak), Pistacia palaestÃ¬na (terebinth) and Olea europaea (olive). One sample, from a locus attributed to Str. X (LB IA), was of Tamarix aphylla (tamarisk), and another, from a locus attributed to Str. VIII (LB IB/IIA), was of Quercus ithaburensis (Mt. Tabor oak). An olive stone from a locus attributed to Str. I (Persian period) was also identified (Table 72). The primary climax vegetation that dominated the Mediterranean territory during antiquity, prior to man's impact on the landscape, was the Quercus calliprinos (Kermes oak) -Pistacia palaestÃ¬na (terebinth) association (Liphschitz and Biger 1990). Although the present vegetation of the surroundings of Tel Batash has been greatly influenced by human activities, Quercus calliprinos and Pistacia palaestÃ¬na trees still exist in the region. Olea europaea (olive) trees are common today in groves in the lower Shephelah. Olea europaea was one of the components of the climax community of Quercus calliprinos-Pistacia palaestÃ¬na during antiquity. However, as a result of olive cultivation from the Early Bronze Age onward, the number of olive trees increased, greatly exceeding its proportion in the natural vegetation (Liphschitz et al. 1991). The archaeobotanical findings from Tel Batash represent the native arboreal vegetation in the lower Shephelah after olive cultivation had already widely spread. The archaeobotanical finds from Tel Batash were compared with archaeobotanical remains originating in three other sites located in the Shephelah: Tel Yarmouth, Tel Erani and Lachish. The results obtained from the dendroarchaeological analyses of these sites reveal similar composition of wood species (Table 73). Quercus calliprinos , Pistacia palaestÃ¬na and Olea europaea constitute 95% of the wood samples at Tel Batash (Middle Bronze Age to Persian period), 92% of the wood samples at Tel Yarmouth (Early Bronze Age) (Liphschitz 1988), 93% of the wood assemblage at Tel Etatvi (Early Btotvxe Age) (LiphsctÃ²z '9$1 a, '990), 9$% of the samples originating from Middle-Late Bronze Age levels at Lachish (excluding the samples made of imported 291</page><page sequence="296">CHAPTER FIFTEEN Table 72.

The high proportion of olive timber within the wood assemblage at all four sites testifies to the existence of olive groves in the Shephelah during antiquity. The importance of the olive oil industry in the economy of Tel Batash is evident from the discovery of two oil presses in the town in Iron IIB. One of them probably functioned as a domestic industry, but the other was presumably a large industrial complex ( Timnahl : 158-161, 211-218). Similar oil presses were discovered in the Shephelah in neighboring Tel Miqne, where 102 installations for olive oil production were found (Gitin and Dothan 1993). It seems that the economy of the inhabitants of the Shephelah was based to a large extent on a regional olive oil industry involved in export. Table 73.

Kislev, Yoel Melamed and Yakov Langsam Faculty of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University Samples of charred botanical material from Timnah (Tel Batash) were processed (Tables 74-76). The site is located on the left bank of Nahal Sorek, on the inner coastal plain (Shephelah) near the piedmont of the Judean Mountains. The material came from most of the site's strata, primarily from Str. VI, VII, VIII and X. The main crops were cereal grains - wheat, emmer (hulled wheat) and barley - and pulse seeds, fenugreek and grass pea. Most strata also contained olive stones (Table 77). The most significant sample comes from a storage jar (Reg. No. 4120; PI. 41:9) found full of wheat grains in Locus 437 in the Str. VII Building 315, dated to LB IIA. All the photographs are SEM micrographs of charred specimens from this storage jar. The jar was excavated from a storage space located beneath wooden steps leading to the second story of a public building. It was sealed under a thick layer of charred wood and fallen bricks (Mazar 1997: 64-66). Charring had noticeably changed the morphology of very few of the botanical remains. The wheat grains and some of their ear parts, as well as seeds and dispersal units of the accompanying weeds, were well preserved and will be described below. Stem rust of wheat (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) was also identified on some grains (Kislev 1982). The grains and the ear fragments were identified as belonging to small-grained wheat ( Triticum parvicoccum [= T. turgidum ssp. parvicoccum ]), a species found only in archaeological excavations. A few rachis fragments and thousands of grains have been found in many sites throughout the Near East and the Balkans. T. parvicoccum is differentiated from other tetraploid wheats by its rather dense ear and short (~5 mm) grain (Table 78). It differs from hexaploid species in the nature of its Mediterranean and Near Eastern distribution * We thank Mina Marmorstein and Dr. Orit Simchoni for their technical help. patterns and its early Neolithic origin (e.g. Kislev et al. 2004). The following description of T. parvicoccum is based on charred archaeobotanical finds. The species is characterized by tough rachis; very short and narrow internodes; grains very short, oval to elliptic, widest in the middle, thickest in the lower third; with wide, rounded or truncate apex; flat ventral side, ascending at the base; narrow crease; and rounded cheeks. Its morphological characters lead to the suggestion that it is a naked tetraploid wheat (Kislev 1979/80). However, the taxonomical status of this species is still under scholarly discussion. Some consider it to be a separate taxon, but others believe that it should be included in T. turgidum (Davies 1985; Feldman 2001; Zohary and Hopf 2000). The charred material from Timnah adds some characters to this species that have not been previously observed. These include the morphologies of the culm and collar; the shape of the internodes, including the upper and the lowest ones, as well as the length of the rachis hairs; and the shape of the spikelets, including the upper and the lowest ones, and of the glume with its keel (Photos 142-152). The grains have a deep crease (Photos 15 1-152). We suggest that the combination of very small grains and the deep crease may have provided a competitive edge, as this species would not have been severely attacked by the granary weevil (Sitophilus granarius), the pest beetle that has been most destructive of stored cereals from the early Neolithic period onward (Kislev et al. 2004). Because the granary weevil larva lives entirely within one half of the grain, the small grain would not have provided sufficient food for normal weevil development. The tunnel width made by the larva increases with successive instars; the deep crease would have prevented the larva from passing into the second half of the grain, especially in its last instar. This argument may also explain the small grains of ancient European T. compactum. Despite their small grains, the Timnah remains should be identified as the 295</page><page sequence="299">CHAPTER SIXTEEN &lt; PQ J vo "Â¡t T3 g m o 0 J &gt; Vh (55 e Ã£ m 'Äd S Â£ c cd S &lt;d 1 3 On OS Â© QO Lh ^ QO ^ r~~~ c - oÂ© m 01 r- ^voooÂ»n^H Â© ^ oo Â© m os oo oo tn ÃNJ^^J-^^H^vsOI-h r- rÂ» sÂ© ^ i- I ^2 5 r- -H R r- 5 Ä¼"H Tf ff% Â© Â© Tf Os os *H &lt;N N ^ i- i 1-H n ^ o Â© ^ vH 00 Q0 O ^ TÃ­ VD vo -H (N ^ ^ r- tn Tt Â© Tt m iÃ®Ã® i-H i- i iH Tt ^ Tt VO VÂ© &lt;s o Â© 1- I fH â¼H cN n i-i i-H O Â© o r- Â© o _ ri r- rÂ» i&gt; m cN o _ 1-H i- ( Tt oo in i-i o o &lt;n oo oo oo m Tt m m (N m m ^ ^ 'o H H rn 'S ^ C c 'u ^ g* g S &lt;u ^ 'S iÂ¿ i ÃD ÃL T3 ^ Oh O Â«D g _. _. o o â¢ vh^H &lt;u a&gt; ^ ^ ^ es _. -, _.

T. parvicoccum has a southern geographical distribution (including the Near East). 2. Its straw is solid, not hollow as in T. compactum. 3. The rachis is fringed along the sides with long hairs, but not the short variety, as in T. compactum. 4. The ear density is medium to dense, not very dense. 5. A prominent lump is present at the rachis node, beneath its glume base. 6. The internodes are relatively thick. 7. The spikelets are not closely packed, with the angle between the glume and the rachis being less than 45Â°. 8. The spikelets are narrow, not broad, and they possess 2 grain-producing flowers, not 3-5. 9. The prominent keel of the glume runs from the base to the tip. 10. After traditional threshing, the basal parts of the glumes usually remain attached to the rachis node. Thousands of uredospores, organized in a few uredia, of stem rust of wheat ( Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) were identified infesting two lemmas of small-grained wheat (Photos 153-156). The charred uredospores are smaller and rounder than uncharred ones, apparently due to carbonization. Rust (yeraqon in ancient Hebrew) is mentioned in the Bible (Deut. 28: 22; I Kings 8:37) and the Mishnah (Taanith 3:5). When this rust strikes in a given year, its effects may be devastating and widespread. Apparently, this archaeobotanical identification of rust is still unique in the literature (Kislev 1982). Among the wheat grains, some well-preserved weed remains were identified to the species level (Tables 75-76). These include widespread noxious weeds, mainly darnel (. Lolium temulentum) (Tables 79-80) and canary grass ( Phalaris paradoxa var. praemorsa) (Photos 180-183), whose shape and dimensions are similar to those of wheat grains. In addition, remains of other species, annual or perennial herbs that grow in fields or in rather similar habitats, were found. Some of these species are briefly described below, mainly according to Flora Palaestina (Feinbrun-Dothan 1978, 1986; Zohary 1966, 1972). Their remains are illustrated and their occurrence at other sites in Israel is mentioned. Some of them {Centaurea verutum, Geropogon hybridus , Lavatera trimestris , Rhagadiolus stellatus and Trifolium berytheum) apparently make their first appearance in an archaeobotanical report. 1. Erucaria hispanica (Cruciferae = Brassicaceae) (Photos 157-158). An east Mediterranean annual herb. In Israel, it is common in fallow fields and roadsides. Some seeds of E. hispanica! boveana were found among barley remains at Chalcolithic Shiqmim (Kislev 1987). 2. Trifolium berytheum (Papilionaceae =Fabaceae) (Photo 159). An east Mediterranean small annual herb. In Israel, it is rather uncommon in heavy soils of fallow fields or grassy places. This is apparently the first record of the species in an archaeobotanical report. 3. Linum nodiflorum (Linaceae) (Photos 160-161). A north Mediterranean and west Irano-Turanian small annual herb. In Israel, it is a fairly common weed in fields and also in batha. One capsule of this species was found among charred grains of T. parvicoccum at Iron Age Horbat Rosh Zayit, dated to the 10th-9th centuries BCE (Kislev and Melamed 2000). 4. Lavatera trimestris (Malvaceae) (Photo 162). A Mediterranean low annual herb. In Israel, it is a locally common weed among winter crops in heavy soil. 300</page><page sequence="304">PLANT REMAINS FROM TEL BATASH Table 77. Olive stone remains.

Daucus broteri (= D. bicolor) (Umbelliferae) (Photos 163-166). An east Mediterranean annual herb. In Israel, it is a fairly common weed in fields and along roadsides. One or two achenes of this species were found in layer X 10 (Iron I) at Philistine Tel Aphek, dated to the 11th century BCE (Mahler-Slasky 2004). 6. Convolvulus arvensis (Convolvulaceae) (Photo 167). A perennial herb found in many regions in both hemispheres. In Israel, it is common as a persistent weed in crop fields and also in fallow fields. One seed of C. arvensis was found among charred grains of T. parvicoccum at Iron Age Horbat Rosh Zayit, dated to the 10th-9th centuries BCE (Kislev and Melamed 2000). 7. Cephalaria joppensis (Dipsacaceae) (Photo 168). An east Mediterranean tall annual plant, 60-200 cm. In Israel, it is abundant along roadsides and in similar habitats. The fruit is an achene tightly enveloped by the involucel. The involucel ("outer calyx") is regarded as being formed by connate bracteoles. Twenty-five achenes of this species were found among charred grains of T. parvicoccum in two loci at Iron Age Horbat Rosh Zayit, dated to the 10th-9th centuries BCE (Kislev and Melamed 2000), and one achene in a silo of the same wheat from layer 9a (Iron IB) at Tell Keisan, dated to the 11th century BCE (Kislev 1980). 8. Cephalaria syriaca (Dipsacaceae) (Photo 169). A Mediterranean and Irano-Turanian erect annual, 30-70 cm. In Israel, it is a common weed in crop fields and also in fallow fields. The fruits are similar to wheat grains in size and shape and they have often been ground together with wheat, impairing the taste and color of the flour. A few achenes were found in Str. III (early Iron Age) at Afula, dated to the 12th- 11th century BCE (Zaitschek 1954). Some achenes of this species were found among charred grains of T. parvicoccum in a silo in layer 9a (Iron IB) at Tell Keisan, dated to the 11th century BCE, as well as in other sites in the Near East (Kislev 1980). 9. Centaurea iberica/ hyalolepis (Compositae = Asteraceae) (Photo 170). Both species are closely related herbs, belonging to Sect. Calcitrapa , common and abundant in east Mediterranean and west Irano-Turanian territories. In Israel, they grow as weeds in fields and along roadsides. A single achene of C. iberica was found in Area A in Late Bronze IIB Tel Aphek, dated to the 1 3th century BCE (Mahler-Slasky 2004). 10. Centaurea verutum (Compositae) (Photo 171). An east Mediterranean annual herb, common in heavy alluvial soils. Apparently, this is the first record of the species in archaeobotanical reports. 11. Geropogon hybridus (Compositae) (Photo 172). A Mediterranean and west Irano-Turanian low annual herb. In Israel, it is a common weed in fields, as well as in fallow fields and along roadsides. This is apparently the first record of the species in an archaeobotanical report. 12. Picris altissima (= P. sprengeriana ) (Compositae) (Photos 173-175). A Mediterranean annual herb. In Israel, it is common in fallow fields on heavy soils. One achene of this species was found in an LB level at Beth- Shean (Simchoni et al. in press) 302</page><page sequence="306">PLANT REMAINS FROM TEL BATASH Photo 142.

A small annual herb, endemic to the Levant, and a common weed in fields. A few achenes were found among charred grains of T. parvicoccum at Iron Age Horbat Rosh Zayit, dated to the 10th-9th centuries BCE (Kislev and Melamed 2000). One achene of this species was found in a silo that also contained grains of T. parvicoccum at Iron II Ashkelon, dated to 604 BCE (Weiss and Kislev 2004). 14. Rhagadiolus stellatus (Compositae) (Photos 178-179). A Mediterranean small annual herb. In Israel, it is a common weed in fields. The leaves are used as salad. This is apparently the first record of the species in an archaeobotanical report. 15. Phalaris paradoxa var. praemorsa (Gramineae = Poaceae) (Photos 180-183). The glumes are persistent, equal in size, longer than the floret and enclosing it. The dispersal unit is adapted by its shape, dimensions, weight and late ripening to accompany cereal grains from the field via the threshing floor and sieve to the granary. It forms half an ellipsoid because deformation of the outer spikelets is more pronounced than that of the inner ones. Its shape and dimensions resemble those of wheat and barley grains. This deformed variety is common in Israel, Jordan and Egypt, as well as in other countries of the Near East. Its remains were found among charred grains of T. parvicoccum at Iron Age Horbat Rosh Zayit, dated to the 10th-9th centuries BCE (Kislev and Melamed, 2000), in a silo in layer 9a (Iron IB) at Tell Keisan, dated to the 11th century BCE, as well as in other sites in the Near East (Kislev 1980). All of the identified weed species grow today in the Shephelah, the region in which Timnah is located. Some of them, such as Trifolium berytheum, Lavatera trimestris and Picris altissima , indicate that the wheat was grown on heavy soils, which are common in the neighborhood of Timnah, near the banks of Nahal Sorek.

They were all sent for research to Dr. Brian Hesse at the University of Alabama. Dr. Hesse apparently processed this rich material, since the results were incorporated in several of his studies. However, despite our requests, we never received a scholarly report on this material. Thus, we are obliged to cite the relevant data from previous publications by Dr. Hesse, summarized in Table 81. These data are of course very limited and have never been assessed against the stratigraphie analysis. The main emphasis of the published data is on pig consumption in the Iron Age. Hesse (1990: 218) writes: "At Tel Batash some room complexes are pig rich, other contemporary structures are pig poor (Hesse and Wapnish 1987). Looking at pig rich parts of the site in Iron I yields values of about 14% pig. Pig exploitation was clearly more important for some sectors of these Philistine communities than the simple period percentages would indicate." The rise in pig consumption at Batash, Tel Miqne- Ekron and Ashkelon is related to the appearance of the Philistines. It was followed by a decline in the use of pigs in Iron II (Hesse 1990: 218), though the exact date of this decline could not be established at Batash. The Table 81.

It is unfortunate that no further information on the fauna from Tel Batash can be presented. REFERENCES Hesse, B. 1990. Pig Lovers and Pig Haters: Patterns of Palestinian Pork Production.

Arensburg Department of Anatomy and Anthropology, Sackler Medical School, Tel Aviv University Two human skulls and some other human skeletal fragments from Tel Batash were studied by the author. AreaB (Late Bronze Age) Skeletal remains found in Building 315 (Str. VII, 14th century BCE) in debris that had fallen from the second floor in the entrance to the building (Locus 411). The skull is black to grayish, probably due to the fire that destroyed the building. There is no indication of intentional cremation. The skull is almost complete, representing a male, 20-25 years old. The vault is elongated (dolichocrany, index 72.2), with a clearly protruding occiput and an oblique forehead. The glabella is missing but the contour could be easily reconstructed. The mastoid processes are very big and the nuchal relief rough. The face is narrow and the orbits square. The nasal aperture should be of medium size. The missing nasion prevents the calculation of the nasal and facial indices. No prognathism is present. The vault is of medium to low height, chamaecrane relative to its length and metriocane to its breadth. The lower jaw has a small body and a smooth chin; the ramus is high and wide. Only the upper third molars are present; all other teeth were lost ante-or post-mortem. Area D (Iron Age II) Locus 737; Reg. No. 7379; Stratum III. This skull was found in an Iron II layer, destroyed in 701 BCE. It is represented by a calotte formed by the frontal, parietal and broken occipital bones of a male, 20-25 years old. The skull of this individual approaches mesocrany (cranial index, 74.3), mainly because of a shortening in the antero-posterior diameter. The occiput protrudes only slightly backward, and its relief is smooth. The forehead shows medium development of the glabella with well-developed frontal protuberances. Small fragments of a third individual (Area D, Locus 852, Reg. No. 7404, Stratum III) probably belong to a child, about two years old, and include fragments of the frontal, parietal, temporal and some long bones. Other very fragmentary parts of long bones, vertebrae, ribs, etc. are also present. DISCUSSION Anthropological material from the Late Bronze Age excavated in the Land of Israel is scanty and poorly known. The Iron Age population, on the other hand, is well documented thanks to the discovery at Lachish of a mass burial of the period containing the remains of more than 600 individuals. Table 82 gives data on the skeletal material from Tel Batash compared with those on remains from other archaeological sites in Israel. The Late Bronze skull of Tel Batash is somewhat different from skulls of Megiddo and Tel Dan. The latter crania are shorter, broader and higher in vault, and consequently their cranial indices are different. The face however, represented by the nasal breadth and the orbital index, is similar in all the sites, although at Megiddo the orbits are square rather than rectangular. The Iron Age skull from Tel Batash appears exceptionally similar to the crania from Lachish in mean measurements. This skull may easily be considered as belonging to a typical Iron Age population as represented in the Lachish ossuary. HrdliÄka (1938) observed, in his study of the Megiddo material, a broadening of the skull beginning during the Middle Bronze and continuing through later periods. Arensburg (1973), however, noted that only a small part of the Middle Bronze population shows a relative broadening of the cranium, while the main bulk of the local population conserved the typical Mediterranean features that characterize earlier and later periods, and that include dolichocrany as well as mesocrany. It is not necessary here to discuss the significance of the broadening of some of the Middle Bronze skulls and 313</page><page sequence="316">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Table 82.

Bar-Yosef Mayer Zinman Institute of Archaeology, University of Haifa The shell assemblage of Tel Batash consists of 513 mollusc shells. Most are of marine origin, but four (at least) originated in fresh water and 22 are land snails. Table 83 summarizes these finds and presents them in taxonomie as well as stratigraphie order. The shaded areas in the table indicate shells that are worked and considered to be of ornamental value, or which were brought from far away and are indicative of long-distance trade. Thus, only 16 shells in this assemblage can be considered artifacts. DESCRIPTION AND INTERPRETATION The 22 land snails found at Tel Batash belong to the local fauna and consist mainly of Helix sp. and Levantina sp., with a few Euchondrus sp. and Trochoidea sp. also present (Heller 1993; Mienis 1982). They were mostly found in the topsoil of Str. I and are probably recent. A few specimens from earlier strata could date from any period between the stratum in which they were found and recent times, as landsnails often fall into cracks in the ground. The freshwater shells consist of two major components: Melanopsis sp., a local freshwater snail (Mienis 1983), and Chambardia rubens , a bivalve from the Nile (previously known as Aspatharia rubens). The two specimens of Melanopsis sp. were probably brought to the site inadvertently together with mud for the construction of mudbricks (see also Miller Rosen 1986), or with drinking water. Chambardia rubens was represented by two specimens, a complete valve from Str. VI and a large fragment from Str. X. These are discussed below in the context of mother of pearl. The marine shells are dominated by Glycymeris insubrica (previously known as G. violacescens ), the most common bivalve on the Eastern Mediterranean shore today and the largest group of shell species at Tel Batash, with 432 shells forming about 84% of the assemblage. The Glycymeris sp. are mostly complete shells (80% of Glycymeris ), over half of them with a naturally abraded hole in the umbo. The rest are broken or fragments. Only three of these shells (found in Loci B727, B722 and HI 125) have an artificially perforated hole near the umbo. The shells are present in large numbers, especially in Str. II (7th century BCE) in which 226 shells were found, particularly in association with floors (mainly Loci D743, 946, 982, H1007 and H1010). Especially noteworthy are two specimens from Locus B 1022 (Str. VIII, LB IB), which had a plaster-like incrustation in the concave side of the valves. These shells may have been brought to Batash from the Mediterranean shoreline, about 30 km west of the site. The possibility that they were brought from beachrock of the Pleshet Formation, has been ruled out (Bar- Yosef Mayer 2004). However, it is possible that other Mediterranean species that appear at the site, especially unworked Muricidae and Cardiidae, were brought along with the Glycymeris. Thus, it has been suggested (Bar-Yosef Mayer 1999) that Glycymeris were brought to various archaeological sites for use in construction, especially of floor foundations. According to Ronen (1980), Glycymeris are effective in water drainage when they are laid on a floor by a sweeping motion with the convex side up. Large accumulations of Glycymeris sp. were noted in the Iron Age level of Tel Hamid in the Shephelah (Bar-Yosef Mayer in press), where Muricid shells are also present, and at Lachish (Bar-Yosef Mayer 2004), where beachrock was also used as construction material (Miller Rosen 1986). At Megiddo a shell-paved floor foundation dating from the Late Bronze Age was found (Megiddo II: 25, Figs. 50, 52). Other Mediterranean shells include 16 specimens of the family Cardiidae (Acanthocardia tuberculata and Cerastoderma glaucum ), 22 shells of the family Muricidae ( Hexaplex trunculus, Murex brandaris , Stramonita haemastoma and Murex sp.). Some of these 315</page><page sequence="318">CHAPTER NINETEEN Table 83. Mollusc shells at Tel Batash. are complete and some broken, some are naturally eroded, but none are worked. In addition, the naturally eroded "cassid lip" (Reese 1989), the outer lip of Phalium granulation, might also derive from the same source. However, one should note that the latter is sometimes considered an amulet. All of the above-mentioned species may derive from the same Mediterranean beaches that yielded the Glycymeris sp. In the category of shell artifacts, I include shells brought to the site over a long distance and/or shells that have clearly been worked for use as ornaments. This group can be divided into gastropods ( Cypraea sp. and Conus sp.) and bivalves (mother of pearl and Tridacna). The gastropod "artifacts" belong to two molluscan genera: Cypraea sp. and Conus sp. Cypraea sp., commonly known as cowries, belong to two species: Cypraea spurca from the Mediterranean and Cypraea annulus from the Red Sea (or Indian Ocean). Though all three C. spurca are complete shells, one of them (from Locus D 1007) has a hole in the body whorl; it is impossible to determine whether this hole is natural or man-made. Both specimens of C. annulus are worked 316 Species/Str. I Origin li [il I III 1 IV I V I VI 1 VII VIII 1 IX 1 X XI lUnstr.

C. annulus from the Red Sea appears in almost every Iron Age site in Israel. It has been suggested that the shells may have been used not only for decoration but also as shell money, as a parallel monetary system to the well-known system of payment using weighed silver ingots (e.g. Ronen 1996), the weights for which have been found at Tel Batash (Keim and Mazar 1995; B ar- Yosef Mayer 1999; 2000). The Mediterranean C. spurca is also present in many Iron Age sites, including Megiddo (Bar- Yosef Mayer 2000), Lachish (Bar- Yosef Mayer 2004), the City of David (Mienis 1992), Tel Miqne (Golani 1996), Tell Ta'annek (Ezzughayyar and Al-Zawahra 1996), and others. Whether this species too was part of a shell money system remains to be demonstrated. Each of the three Conus sp. specimens is different. One from Str. VII (Locus 315) is the only Conus sp. in any of the Late Bronze levels; it is a large specimen (54 mm high) with a drilled hole in the apex and is apparently a Red Sea species (it could not be identified at species level, but it is not Mediterranean). The two other Conus spp. both originate from the Iron I level of Str. V. The first is a Conus mediterraneus , also with a hole at the apex, found in a context of brick debris (Locus E602). The other is an unidentifiable Conus sp. found in the context of the Iron Age I city wall (W576), of which only the spire (the top) of the shell is present, with a hole in its center; this has been smoothly ground from all sides into a roughly square shape measuring 25 X 21 mm and 6 mm high. Thus, both the Conus mediterraneus and the squared Conus spire could have originated in a Late Bronze level. Squared Conus spires seem to be fairly common in the Late Bronze and Iron I. Brandl (1985) lists Tel Gezer, Beth-Shemesh, Tell el-Far' ah (S) and Megiddo as some of the other sites where this type was found, and an additional specimen was discovered at Tel Miqne (A. Golani, personal communication). The term "mother of pearl" is used in Table 83 to define fragments belonging to either the Red Sea Pinctada margaritifera , the Nilotic Chambardia rubens , or the local freshwater bivalve Unio sp. Some additional fragments could also belong to these species. All three species are formed from nacre, made of the mineral aragonite, which is very fragile and is therefore often found in fragmentary condition. It is interesting to note that Pinctada margaritifera and Chambardia rubens appear side by side at several sites, such as Lachish (Bar- Yosef Mayer 2004). Chambardia sp. is known from an LB burial cave at Tell Jdur (Mienis 1981) and was also found in Late Bronze levels of Tel Gezer and Tell el-Hesi (Reese et al. 1986). The LB Mining Temple at Timna yielded both Pinctada margaritifera and Chambardia rubens , as well as Tridacna sp. and Conus sp. (Reese 1986). The recently studied shells of Megiddo also yielded two Chambardia sp. shells from the LB levels (Bar- Yosef Mayer 2000). It has been suggested (Mienis 1981) that Chambardia shells were used as food, but the paucity of specimens does not allow us to accept this interpretation. Another possible interpretation is that they were associated with medicinal or magical powers, in which case a small amount would suffice (for more information on the curative properties of shells see, for example, Safer and Gill 1982). Both Pinctada margaritifera and Chambardia rubens , originating in the Red Sea and the Nile respectively, seem to be characteristic of the LB, an assumption reinforced by other evidence in the material culture for Egyptian influences in this period (e.g. this volume, Chapters VI, VII). A single Tridacna sp. originating in the Red Sea, found in Area B but lacking stratigraphie attribution, is a large, well-polished fragment. CONCLUSIONS Three major groups of mollusc shells were defined at Tel Batash: 1. Land snails that were naturally deposited. 2. Shells that were mostly naturally abraded, which were collected on the Mediterranean shore for construction purposes. These are dominated by Glycymeris sp. Two specimens of the freshwater Melanopsis sp., which may have been brought to the site along with material for construction of mudbricks, can be added to this group. 3. Shells that originated in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea or the Nile River and were sometimes worked into beads or ornaments. This group is represented by only 16 specimens (3% of the shell assemblage, shaded in Table 83), probably reflecting the fact that Tel Batash was a relatively small township in which luxury items were quite rare. 317</page><page sequence="320">CHAPTER NINETEEN REFERENCES Bar-Yosef Mayer, D. 1999.

Bruins,1 Johannes van der Plicht ,2 Amihai Mazar ^en-Gurion University of the Negev, Jacob Blaustein Institute for Desert Research 2University of Groningen, Centre for Isotope Research SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS, METHODS, 513C AND RADIOCARBON RESULTS The three samples from Area B at Tel Batash were dated at the Centre for Isotope Research (University of Groningen), which has a radiocarbon laboratory that comprises two different measurement systems: (1) Proportional Gas Counting (PGC) and (2) Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). All samples were pretreated with the acid/alkali/acid (AAA) method (Mook and Waterbolk 1985). The purified organic matter of each sample was successively changed into C02. For AMS dating, the C02 gas was subsequently converted into solid graphite. A large sample of charred wheat from an intact LB jar found in Stratum VII yielded enough C02 for measurement of its 14C content by PGC. This technique can give high-precision results with a low standard deviation, if the sample quantity is large enough. This was the case for the charred wheat, enabling a precise measurement of 3150 Â± 20 BP (GrN-26102) (Table 84). The amount of C02 obtained from the two samples of Stratum X was too small for measurement by PGC. Hence, each sample was measured by AMS (Van der Plicht et al. 2000). The respective dates are: 3305 Â± 40 BP (GrA- 17863) and 3340 Â± 40 BP (GrA- 17841). Both samples contained very fine, unidentified, charred organic matter from Locus 763 (Table 84). The two 14C measurements are very close to each other, within the range of one standard deviation (lo), which is an indication of reliability in terms of measurement repeatability (Scott et al. 1998; Van der Plicht and Bruins 2001). It therefore seems justified to calculate the weighted average of both samples, which gives a more precise date of 3323 Â± 28 BP. The calculation was carried out with the OxCal program, version 3.9 (Bronk Ramsey 2003). A chi-squared test of the calculation shows that the combination of the above two samples is statistically allowed. Carbon occurs in three isotopie forms in nature and organic materials: 12C, 13C and 14C. The first two are stable isotopes and only 14C is radioactive. Though plants take up all three forms of carbon through photosynthesis, variations occur due to mass-dependent effects called isotope fractionation. Hence the stable isotope ratio 13C/12C is determined in order to make a fractionation correction to radiocarbon dates (Mook and Waterbolk 1985). The 13C/12C ratio is relative to the 13C/12C ratio for a standard and reported in S13C, in permil deviation. The different 813C values of -25.45 for basket B7560 (GrA- 1 7863) and -2 1 .36 for basket B756 1 (GrA- 1 784 1 ) are indications of the mixed plant origin of this material deriving from the destruction level of Stratum X. The organic matter, which is very fine, powdery and difficult to identify, may include short-lived annuals and shrubs, seeds and woody elements. CALIBRATED RADIOCARBON DATES AND CHRONOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS The Stratum VII Destruction Layer: GrN-26102 The radiocarbon dates in conventional 14C years BP were calibrated with the OxCal program version 3.9 (Bronk Ramsey 2003), using the INTCAL 1998 calibration curve (Stuiver and Van der Plicht 1998). The precise radiocarbon date of charred wheat from Stratum VII (GrN-26 1 02, 3 1 50 Â± 20 BP) becomes more complicated in calendar years, due to the wiggles in the calibration curve that result from natural variations of the atmospheric 14C content in the past, as reconstructed from 319</page><page sequence="322">CHAPTER TWENTY Fig. 34. Calibration of GrN-26102 (3150 Â± 20 BP) from conventional radiocarbon years via the calibration curve into calendar years (graph in solid black). tree ring measurements of dendrochronological series. The calibrated date of GrN-26102 covers a number of possible age ranges (Table 84, Fig. 34). The la interval reflects the highest relative probability, totaling 68.2%: 1486-1484 BCE (1.4%), 1438-1404 BCE (66.8%). The latter age range represents the most likely option. The 2 a interval, covering almost the entire probability range (95.4%), gives the following subdivisions: 1495-1477 BCE (8.7%), 1455-1388 BCE (82.5%), 1333-1321 BCE (4.2%). The true age of the wheat is probably situated in the calibrated age range of 1455-1388 BCE, which represents 82.5% of all probability. Within this range, the period of 1438-1404 BCE has the highest relative probability. How do these calibrated radiocarbon age ranges compare with archaeological-historical age assessments? Scarabs of Pharaoh Amenophis III and his wife Ty (18th Dynasty) were discovered in the destruction level of Stratum VII (see Chapter VI); thus the terminus post quern for this level may be correlated with the reign of Amenophis III. His reign has been dated to 1411-1375 (Breasted 1906); 1405-1367 (Gardiner 1961: 443); 1398-1361 (Wilson 1951: 320); 1417-1379 (James 1979: 264); 1402-1364 (Trigger et al. 1983: 184) 1388-1350 BCE (Von Beckerath 1997 and Kitchen 2000, who also suggests dates four years earlier as a possibility). The calibrated 14C range with the highest relative probability, 1438-1404 BCE, supports the higher dates suggested in earlier stages of research. It is important to realize that various assumptions based on ancient Egyptian literary sources underlie the chronological studies, and that very few high-quality radiocarbon dates exist for the 2nd millennium BCE in Egypt (Bruins and Mook 1989; Bruins and Van der Plicht 2003). A more detailed evaluation of Egyptian chronology in relation to radiocarbon dating is beyond the scope of this short report. The Samples from Stratum X Two samples from different baskets (B7560, B7561) of the same locus (B763) were taken from the destruction layer of Stratum X. Both baskets contained soft, powdery, charred organic material of a very fine nature that was not identified. It seems that identification of individual organic components in terms of species would be difficult, if not impossible. The charred organic powder may have derived from decayed wood or from short- lived material. The relatively low quantity of carbon could be measured only by AMS. The calibrated date of Basket B7560 (GrA-17863, 3305 Â± 40 BP) for the la interval is 1677-1674 BCE (1.8%) and 1620-1523 BCE (66.4%). The latter age range has the highest relative probability. The 2a interval gives a much wider age range of 1687-1496 BCE that covers 95.4% of all probability. The most probable range is 1620-1523 BCE (66.4%). Basket 7561 yielded a slightly older date (GrA- 17841, 3340 Â± 40 BP) with the following calibrated age ranges in the la interval: 1684-1666 BCE (10.9%), 1663-1601 BCE (38.8%), 1 564-1 530 BCE ( 1 8.5%). The highest relative probability is in the range 1663-1601 BCE. The 2a calibrated results are: 1745-1715 (4.7%), 1690-1522 (90.7%). The weighted average of both dates, coming from the same destruction layer, gives a more precise date 320</page><page sequence="323">RADIOCARBON DATES FROM TEL B ATASH Table 84.

The charred sample may have belonged to the construction of this city, while its destruction may have occurred somewhat later, at the beginning of the 15th century BCE. However, it should be noted that the older range of 1626-1599 BCE also has a significant probability, and may be explained in terms of a possible old wood effect. REFERENCES Breasted, J. H. 1906.

Ever since, I have been attempting to answer this question. Was this rather moderately sized site worthy of its twelve seasons of excavation and the many years of research that followed in their wake? I believe that the three volumes of the final report concluded here justify our decision. The excavations at Tel Batash have revealed the archaeological profile of this site during a period of over twelve centuries, from the 17th century to the Babylonian conquest and to some extent into the Persian period. The incredibly rich and abundant data contribute many new insights for the study of various aspects of the material culture of the periods represented. Discussions of the stratigraphy, architecture and town planning of the entire site were presented in Timnah I (for a summary, see pp. 249-263 there). The pottery and other artifacts from the first millennium were presented and discussed in Timnah II and those of the second millennium in the present volume. The comprehensive discussion by Nava Panitz-Cohen in Chapters II and IV of this volume presents our main conclusions relating to the second- millennium Str. XII-V. Nevertheless, in the following pages I will summarize some of these conclusions and add some thoughts on spatial, chronological, socio- economic and ethnic issues related to Tel Batash and its region in the second millennium. The stratigraphie sequence points to continuous occupation from the foundation of Tel Batash as a fortified town during the 17th century until the end of the Iron Age, with two periods of decline in the late 14th- early 13th centuries and in the 9th century. Of particular importance are the excellent stratigraphy and rich finds of Str. XII-VII, demonstrating continuous occupation between the 17th and 14th centuries, while the remains of Str. VI-V of the 13th- 1 1th centuries, albeit poorer than those of Str. IX-VII, are of great interest for the study of the town's fate during the crucial transitional period from the LB to Iron I. Thus, Tel Batash is one of the prime sites for study of the cultural sequence of the second millennium in southern Canaan. The occupation history of our site is revealing in the context of the larger regional picture. Today this picture can be profitably drawn, thanks to prolific archaeological research of the northern Shephelah and inner coastal plain during the last generation. Relevant excavated sites are Tel Miqne (Ekron), Gezer, Beth-Shemesh and Tel Safit (Gath), joined by comprehensive surveys of the Shephelah (by Y. Dagan), the Ayalon Valley (Shavit 2000) and the Sorek Valley (by the present author and others), as well as minor excavations at various sites (for a previous regional assessment relating to the second millennium, see Mazar 1989). FROM THE POTTERY NEOLITHIC TO THE EARLY BRONZE AGE The Sorek Valley is a major valley crossing the northern Shephelah from east to west, rich in fertile land and water resources. 1 It served, together with the Ayalon and Elah Valleys, as one of the three main east-west arteries connecting the coastal plain with the inner Shephelah and the hill country. During the fifth and fourth millennia, there were several settlements in the valley: a Pottery Neolithic site at Teluliyot Batash (Kaplan 1958); Ghassulian Chalcolithic sites south of the monastery of Deir Rafat and south of Kibbutz Sor' ah, both at the east end of the valley; and the EB I site of Hartu v at the east end of the valley and the somewhat later EB I site of Hurvat 'Illin at the southern end of the modern town of Beth-Shemesh (Mazar and de Miroschedji 1996; for a regional study of EB I sites with Egyptian finds along the Sorek Valley, see Braun et al. 2001). The evolution of urbanism in the third millennium, however, evoked a change: the EB I village sites were 323</page><page sequence="326">CONCLUDING REMARKS abandoned and no substantial EB city developed along the Sorek and Elah Valleys. It seems likely that during EB II- III, Tel Yarmuth became the major center of a city- state in the northern Shephelah, dominating the lands of both these major valleys. This may explain to some extent the rather unusual location of Yarmuth on hilly terrain, far from fertile soils and water sources. Its location between the Sorek and Elah Valleys demonstrates its domination over both these important domains. The only known EB II- III site in the Sorek Valley is the rather small site of Tel Selafon (southeast of Moshav Selafon, to the northeast of Tel Batash). Along the Ayalon Valley, the major city in the third millennium was Gezer, where two occupation strata were attributed to EB II (Str. XXIII-XXIV, both unfortified) but none to EB III.2 No EB IV/MB I sites along the Sorek Valley are known to me.3 THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE The revival of urbanism and sedentary villages in the first two or three centuries of the second millennium (MB IIA in the terminology of the NEAEHL 4) is well attested at Yavneh Yam on the coast near the outlet of Nahal Sorek, as well as at other coastal sites. The MB IIA settlement in our region, however, was very limited in scope. Although Gezer was founded at the end of this period (Str. XXII), it was still an unfortified settlement (for a summary and references see Cohen 2002: 79). At Tel Miqne, MB IIA pottery was found in one place on the upper mound, but nowhere in the lower city.5 At Beth-Shemesh, only a few potsherds and material from a tomb could be attributed to this period, though the town is most probably mentioned in the Execration Texts (Posener group) (Cohen 2002: 75). Further south, Lachish was not settled in the MB IIA, while an exception is Tell Beit Mirsim, where two strata of this period (G-F) were revealed. The foundation of the MB IIB town at Tel Batash most probably occurred during the 17th century. Its foundation must be seen as part of a larger-scale process. Two major fortified cities dominated the region: Gezer Str. XIX, a city of 8.5 hectares located 9 km north of Tel Batash (Seger 1975; 1987; Dever 1993: 500; note that the excavators attribute the fortifications to "late MB IIB/MB IIC") and Tel Miqne, a city of ca. 20 hectares in this period, located 7 km southwest of Tel Batash (Dothan and Gitin 1993). Judging from aerial photographs and the surface topography, it seems that Miqne was surrounded by earth ramparts creating the rectangular shape of the major (southern) part of the site. These assumed ramparts, however, have not yet been explored and their existence is at present conjectural. Tel Batash was founded, as far as can be judged, on the flat alluvial valley of Nahal Sorek as a square town covering 4 hectares (measured at its base), surrounded by earth ramparts. The foundation of the town appears to have been a project initiated and carried out according to a pre-planned design, as indicated by the precise geometric shape of the ramparts and their exact orientation to the four points of the compass. This fixed town plan probably reflects the initiative of some central authority to settle this fertile valley, which was previously virtually unoccupied. During the same general period, Tel Beth-Shemesh, overlooking the Sorek Valley 7 km southeast of Tel Batash, was founded as a fortified town of ca. 2.5 hectares (though lacking earth ramparts). It thus appears that the agricultural lands of the Sorek Valley were divided between these two towns, a situation that would continue in the coming centuries. What was the status of these two neighboring towns? Were they independent political entities or subordinate to the sovereignty of a larger city-state, such as Gezer or Tel Miqne? The latter seems to be the more plausible scenario, since it appears that both Tel Miqne and Gezer dominated larger territories. The geographical proximity seems to indicate that Tel Batash was a minor town in a city-state governed by Tel Miqne at this time. In addition to the fortified settlements, the region included smaller agricultural villages and hamlets, such as the settlement at Givat Sharet near Beth-Shemesh and the farmstead excavated at Teluliyot Batash, 1 km east of Tel Batash (Kaplan 1958: 12-15).6 This new settlement system in our region differs to a large extent from that of the third millennium (particularly in EB III), when Yarmuth served as the major city of the entire northern Shephelah, as noted above. The new urban system of the MB IIB was probably developed by people who came from the coastal plain, where a well-developed ranked urban system already existed in the MB IIA. The only excavated MB IIB remains at Tel Batash are the earth ramparts and the massive structural remains in the northeastern corner of the mound (Area B), which we interpreted as belonging to a citadel. Both the well- planned fortification system and the citadel are indicative of central authority, hierarchy and the ability to deploy substantial amounts of manpower, on either the local or the city-state level.7 The two strata (XII-XI) observed in the "citadel" structure in Area B indicate a fortified MB IIB town of fairly long duration. No evidence for a violent destruction 324</page><page sequence="327">CONCLUDING REMARKS at the end of this period was found, although the area excavated was too small to justify conclusions about the termination of the entire MB town. The end of the MB II at Tel Batash can be dated on the basis of the small assemblage of Str. XI, both independently and in comparison to the pottery of the following Str. X. In her discussion of this question (Chapter II.4), Nava Panitz- Cohen points to a date that fits the traditional end of the MB II in the mid- 16th century. The circumstances may be similar to those that brought an end to the MB settlements at nearby Tel Miqne, Gezer Str. XVIII and Beth-Shemesh Str. V.8 Various causes have been suggested for this event. Some relate it to the aftermath of the expulsion of the Hyksos Dynasty from Egypt, while others would detach the two phenomena (for various views see Weinstein 1981; 1991; Hoffmeier 1989; 1991; Dever 1990). We can add no new information to this debate, apart from emphasizing the crisis that occurred during this time in the entire northern Shephelah region. The excavators of Gezer tend to date the destruction of the MB city to the time of Thutmosis III (Seger 1987: 118; Dever in Gezer IV: 35). Yet this would be too late a date for the end of Str. XI at Tel Batash in light of the material culture of the following Str. X. THE LATE BRONZE AGE I-IIA Str. X-VII at Tel Batash exhibit a virtually unparalleled continuous occupation sequence, despite four successive violent destructions. Since the architecture and material culture related to these strata were analyzed in Timnah I and in the previous chapters of the present volume, I will make only a few comments here. After the end of the fortified MB II town, Tel Batash continued to exist as an unfortified town for most of the LB. The Str. X-VII sequence is known only from Area B, and to a lesser extent from Area A. This is perhaps too small a sample for general conclusions about the fate of the entire town or region. Yet Area B yielded an outstanding picture of settlement history, indicating continuity and long duration on one hand and dramatic short-term events on the other. The process of long duration is that of the continuous existence of opulent dwellings, most likely taking full advantage of the Sorek Valley's ideal natural conditions of abundant arable land and water, as well as proximity to the road connecting the coastal plan with the inner Shephelah and the hill country. The short-term events are four successive violent destructions by fire that destroyed each of the Area B buildings of Str. X-VII during the late 16th to mid- 14th centuries. The houses seem to have been immediately rehabilitated and rebuilt on a somewhat different plan, perhaps by the same owners or their descendents. The architecture of these houses, particularly those of Str. VIII-VII that were completely exposed, is atypical in this period, with few parallels elsewhere (for a summary discussion see Timnah /: 254-254). The rich finds from Str. X-VII, especially the last two of these strata, indicate that the houses probably accommodated high-ranking families during all four occupation levels. The local Canaanite pottery assemblage contained a good number of painted vessels, including elaborately painted small jars, as well as a marked quantity of imported Cypriot pottery (starting with a White Slip I bowl in Str. X). The Cypriot imports included large and small jugs of the Base Ring group, as well as a Base Ring zoomorphic bull-shaped vessel and a rare White Shaved "spindle bottle" from Str. VII (14th century); the latter two are rarely found in private houses of the period. Although Mycenaean pottery is much less common, the complete Myc. IIIA pyxis was one of the luxury items in the Str. VII building. The cylinder seals from Str. VII represent almost the entire range of glyptic styles known in Canaan in this period: common Mitannian, Cypriot and local Canaanite. The Egyptian scarab and scaraboid with royal names from Str. VII hint at direct relations with the Egyptian administration of Canaan. The collection of bronze objects, including bronze cymbals, tools and weapons, reflects both daily life and conflict in this period. The intact bronze female goddess figurine, glass beads and other small artifacts complete the picture of a vital and varied material culture. It appears that the houses in Area B belonged to elite families, perhaps those of landowners or local merchants who amassed sufficient wealth to build and maintain these well-constructed multi-story houses and to obtain luxury items, including rare imports. Despite changes in the individual plans of the buildings, the urban plan was maintained throughout these strata in the excavated area, indicating continuity of population regardless of the frequent destructions. Lack of excavation in other parts of the mound prevents us from knowing to what extent these houses in Area B differed from other dwellings in the town; however, the small area excavated in Area A indicates similar architecture and rich finds, at least parallel to Str. VII in Area B. It thus appears that during the mid- 16th to mid- 14th centuries, Tel Batash was a prosperous Canaanite 325</page><page sequence="328">CONCLUDING REMARKS town. The Egyptian conquest of Canaan during the 15th century seems not to have had a major influence on the daily lives of the local people. The construction of the LB IA Str. X close on the heels of the end of the MB IIB Str. XI can be taken as evidence of this. The fate of Tel Miqne differed from that of Tel Batash: while Tel Batash maintained its size, though not its fortifications, in the transition from the MB to the LB, at Tel Miqne the large lower city of the MB was abandoned and the city was now confined to the upper mound, with an area equal to or smaller than that of Tel Batash. Two occupation layers were defined in the sondage at Field I (Str. X-IX; Dothan and Gitin 1993: 1052-1053; Killebrew 1996). These were dated to the 16th- 15th and 15th-14th centuries respectively. Str. IX was described as being burnt, a destruction that may parallel the end of Str. VIII or VII at Tel Batash. Since Tel Miqne of the LB cannot be identified in any of the written documents of the period, the city seems to have lost its status in favor of its two neighbors to the north and south, Gezer and Gath (Tel Safit, possibly the city of Shuwardatu in the Amarna letters; for a recent discussion of the fate of these cities during the Amarna period see Goren et al. 2004: 270-286). Gezer, well known as a major city-state in the Amarna letters, probably dominated the entire Sorek Valley, including the towns at Tel Batash and Beth-Shemesh. This is supported by our pÃ©trographie study (above, Chapter II.2), which has indicated that the clay sources for the local pottery were in the vicinity of Tel Batash, as well as northwards near Gezer. In the Amarna letters, several towns appear as subordinate to Gezer, as Tel Batash probably was. These include Ayalon, Sor' ah and the unnamed city of Queen Belit-nesheti. While the latter is speculated by Na'aman to be Beth-Shemesh, it could be Tel Batash as well. In the letter known as EA 274, she reports the destruction of a town called Sab/puma (for its possible identification east of Gezer, see Goren et al. 2004: 276). The archaeological records of Gezer and Tel Batash show considerable differences between these two sites. Str. X at Tel Batash can be attributed to the LB IA. At Gezer, such a phase was not defined; the earliest finds in Cave 10A in Field I were dated to the LB IB ( Gezer V : 47-15 1). The excavators conjectured that there was a gap between the end of the fortified MB city (Str. XVIII) and the foundation of the LB IIA city of Str. XVI. They gave the number "Str. XVII" to this gap, without attributing any remains to it ( Gezer IV: table on pp. 8-9; Dever 1998: 116). However, the gap may perhaps be filled by several Cypriot Bichrome vessels (Macalister 1912: II: Figs. 324, 333; III: Pis. CXL: 10-11; CVLVIL7, 9; CLX:7). These may indicate that Gezer was settled in the LB I A, although Cypriot Bichrome Ware already started to appear during the late MB and could be attributed to the final MB stratum at Gezer. Part of a monumental building called Building 14120 in Field VI at Gezer was attributed to Str. XVI, and the excavators suggested that this was part of the royal palace of Canaanite Gezer during the Amarna period {Gezer IV: 46). No evidence was found in this building for any building phases or floor resurfacing, and there was no evidence for a violent destruction of the structure. It appears that it was finally abandoned and therefore was found virtually empty of finds. Both the foundation and the entire use of this building were attributed to the 14th century, a conclusion that may be questioned. The excavators write that open areas around this building contained accumulation of debris dating from the MB (Str. XIX) to the LB HA (Str. XVI) ( Gezer IV: 29), and this may be evidence for the continuous use of this monumental building during an extended period, perhaps from the LB I.9 The history of Gezer during the LB I-IIA was thus very different from that of Tel Batash. While Gezer, the center of a large city-state, was able to defend itself (despite the apparent lack of a city wall), developed peacefully throughout this period and did not suffer from any violent destruction, Tel Batash was destroyed four times by fierce fire (at the end of Str. X, IX, VIII and VII). The successive attacks on Tel Batash may have occurred during border struggles between the Canaanite city-states (for example between Gezer and Gath) or attacks by habiru gangs. The Amarna letters provide ample evidence for such attacks on subsidiary towns in our region, such as Qeilah and Ayalon. At Beth-Shemesh, two occupation levels (IVB and IVA) were attributed by Grant and Wright to the LB I-IIA, parallel to Tel Batash Str. IX-VII. Little can be learned from the report on the history of the town during this period. Beth-Shemesh also yielded a few Cypriot Bichrome sherds, which may belong to an occupation that was contemporary with Tel Batash Str. X {Ain Shems IV: Figs. 2-3). As noted above, Tel Batash and Gezer, in common with most other LB settlements, lacked fortifications. At Tel Batash, as at other sites (Megiddo, Lachish, Tel Halif and others), the outer belt of houses also served as a defense line. Gonen's suggestion (1992: 217-218) that the lack of fortifications in the LB was due to an Egyptian prohibition of such fortifications may be correct, though 326</page><page sequence="329">CONCLUDING REMARKS Tel Batash Str. X, the earliest LB town, was already unfortified before the establishment of Egyptian control over Canaan. The destruction of Str. VII at Tel Batash occurred during the 14th century, probably in the Amarna period or shortly later (though the 14C determinations point to a somewhat earlier date, ca. 1400; see above, Chapter XX). This blow was severe and was probably followed by an occupation gap, the duration of which cannot be securely estimated. THE TRANSITION FROM LATE BRONZE TO IRON I While the 15th- 14th centuries, the time of the Egyptian 18th Dynasty, appear to have been a period of flourishing urbanism and trade in the northern Shephelah, this situation changed during the 13th century, the time of the 19th Dynasty. Str. VI at Tel Batash, divided into two separate strata, VIB and VIA ( Timnah /: 72-76), is less well known than the previous strata due to the more limited exposure. However, there is clear evidence of discontinuity in the urban plan after what appears to be an occupation gap of at least several decades, and perhaps almost a century. The few Str. VIB remains include parts of two structures, one of which appears to be a massive stone building occupying the southern part of Area B, which seem to indicate a revival of the town at some time during the 13th century along entirely different lines. The nature of the end of this town could not be determined; the faint traces of destruction debris between Str. VIB and VIA may indicate that some violent event took place. Str. VIA marks a second substantial change in the urban plan. The stone building in the southern part of Area B recalls contemporary square structures (though largely reconstructed) in Aphek Str. X-ll and at Tell Abu Hawam, both dated to the 12th century (Kochavi 1989: 79-80; Gadot 2003: 224-227; the date of the structures at Tell Abu Hawam is questionable, and they may date from a later phase of the Iron Age). The limited pottery recovered from this level points to continuity of Canaanite forms, but no Cypriot or Mycenaean imports are evident. As concluded in Chapter II.4, Str. VIB probably belongs to the late 13th century and Str. VIA could belong to either the late 13th century or the first half of the 12th century. There was no severe destruction at the end of either of these two strata (except in one structure of Str. VIB), but the architectural distinction between them is substantial. The major building of Str. VIA (Building 442) was re-used and modified in the following Str. V of Iron IB, exhibiting some extent of architectural continuity between these two strata and indicating that there was no "crisis" or violent event affecting the 12th century occupation at Tel Batash. The 12th century was, however, a time of tremendous change at nearby Tel Miqne-Ekron. Although both Str. VIIIB and VIII A at Tel Miqne were dated to the 13th century, the latter may be dated to the transition between the 13th and 12th centuries (Dothan and Gitin 1993: 1052-1053; a lower date in the 12th century is suggested for Str. VIII A by Killebrew 1998). The settlement of the Philistine immigrants in Str. VII at Tel Miqne brought with it an immense expansion of the city, from about 3-4 hectares in the last LB phase to about 1 8 hectares in Str. VII. This vast urban settlement was accompanied by large-scale production of a local variant of Myc. UIC pottery (Dothan and Zukerman 2004). Not a single sherd of this ware was found at Tel Batash, 7 km to the northeast. This can be explained in two ways: either there was an occupation gap at Tel Batash during the time of Tel Miqne VII (following the end of Tel Batash Str. VIA), or Str. VIA at Tel Batash was contemporary with Tel Miqne Str. VII, and the lack of local Myc. UIC pottery at Tel Batash is due to the cultural isolation of the Philistine immigrants at Tel Miqne in the first phase of their settlement. This question is part of the larger debate on the chronology of the Philistine culture and the relationship between Lachish VI (the last Canaanite city with no imported pottery) and the earliest Philistine cities at Ashdod XIII, Tel Miqne VII, Ashkelon and perhaps also Tel Safit-Gath). The conventional view is that all these strata were contemporary, and that the Philistine settlement took place immediately after Ramesses Ill's eighth year. Ussishkin (1985) and Finkelstein (1995) suggested that the date of the Philistine settlement should be lowered until after the end of Lachish VI and the end of the Egyptian occupation of Canaan (for recent support of the conventional view see Bunimovitz and Faust 2001 ; Master 2005; Sherratt 2005: 118-123; Mazar in press). The "low chronology" would require a gap between the end of Str. VIA and the establishment of Str. V at Tel Batash. However, the continuity in the use of Building 442 in the following Str. V, with its assemblage that includes Philistine Bichrome pottery (parallel to Tel Miqne Str. VI-V), seems to indicate that there was no occupation gap at Tel Batash between Str. VIA and V. This would place Tel Batash Str. VIA parallel to Tel Miqne VII, as well as to Lachish Str. VI. A similar development can be observed at Gezer: 327</page><page sequence="330">CONCLUDING REMARKS Str. XV would be parallel to Tel Batash VIB (late 13th century) and Str. XIV to Tel Batash VIA, followed by the appearance of Philistine Bichrome in Str. XIII. Palace 14120 at Gezer went out of use in Str. XV and in fact neither Str. XV nor XIV yielded architectural remains in the main excavated area (Field VI). In Field II, evidence for violent destruction discerned in a small excavated area was attributed by the excavators to the conquest of Gezer by Mernephtah, mentioned in the "Israel Stele". Yet such a destruction was not corroborated in the other excavation areas ( Gezer IV: 50-51). Str. XV-XIV at Gezer seem to indicate a decline of the city, perhaps following Mernephtah 's raid, yet the city continued to survive throughout the early 12th century without a break. As at Tel Batash, no local Myc. UIC pottery was found at Gezer. At Tel Miqne, Str. VIII in the upper part of Field I is described as having been violently destroyed by fire just before the establishment of the Philistine city of Str. VII. Yet in the lower part of Field I, no such destruction was detected (Killebrew 1998). It thus appears that the settlement of the Philistines at Tel Miqne, no doubt an event of huge significance for this part of the country, was not accompanied by military conquests or destructions in the surrounding Canaanite periphery; towns and cities like Tel Batash and Gezer (as well as Lachish further south) seem to have continued their life without disturbance during the first generation of Philistine settlement. This picture contradicts the usual description of the Sea Peoples' immigration as causing turmoil and destruction throughout the eastern Mediterranean. THE IRON AGE IB Str. V at Tel Batash is the only occupation level attributed to Iron IB (late 12th and 11th centuries), although it includes several sub-phases. The architectural remains in Areas B, C, D and E are sufficient to conclude that this town was defended by a modest city wall and that it had an unusual structure in Area C, perhaps the foundation of a local citadel. As noted above, the Str. VI building in Area B was modified and continued in use, while in Areas D and E new buildings were erected, built of typical yellowish mudbricks. The material culture resembles that of other cities and towns in the Shephelah, like Gezer and Beth-Shemesh: the pottery assemblage consists of local Iron I pottery in Canaanite tradition alongside a certain amount of Philistine Bichrome ware. Yet while at Gezer and Beth-Shemesh the amount of Philistine pottery seems to be small (no quantitative data are available, but counts of published sherds indicate ca. 5%), at Tel Batash Philistine forms comprise about 34% of the entire assemblage; if only the serving vessels (bowls, kraters and jugs) are considered, they comprise 41% (see above, Chapter II.4). The technological changes and clay sources (above, Chapter II.2) indicate an affinity to Tel Miqne-Ekron rather than to Gezer, as was the case in the previous period. Several other finds are typical of the Philistine material culture set, such as a seal, a seal impression and the head of a clay figurine (above, Chapters VII and IX). From our limited knowledge of the faunai remains, 8% of the bones were those of pigs, and this may be related to the increase in pig consumption that is seen in the main Philistine cities. To what extent was the town inhabited by Philistines? This question is hard to answer. The relationship between material culture and ethnic identity is a long-debated issue, and the case of the Philistines is no exception (see for example the different views expressed by Bunimovitz 1990; Stager 1995; Sherratt 1998). It is plausible that Tel Batash (Timnah) became subordinate to Ekron, and that much of its population was Philistine, alongside an indigenous Canaanite population. However, the relationship between these two groups cannot be established. The large proportion of Philistine pottery and other artifacts points, in my view, to a dominance of the Philistine population, while the smaller amounts of Philistine material culture components at Gezer and Beth-Shemesh perhaps indicate that in these sites the local indigenous population remained the majority. Their neighbors in the settlement sites of the hill country to the east, as well as in Jerusalem, had a distinct material culture that differed from that of the Shephelah 's settlements. For example, collared-rim jars, which are so common in the hill country (as well as in the Yarkon basin), are almost totally lacking in the Shephelah (Mazar in press), while painted pottery is almost totally lacking in the hill country. The duration of the Str. V town remains unclear. While at nearby Tel Miqne, Gezer and Beth-Shemesh there were at least two strata containing Philistine Bichrome pottery (Str. VI-V at Tel Miqne, Str. XIII-XI at Gezer and Str. 4-5 in the new excavations of Beth- Shemesh10), at Tel Batash only one stratum was detected, though in certain places there were up to three floor resurfacings in open areas. Nevertheless, it seems that this town existed throughout the 11th century. There was no evidence for violent destruction of the Str. V town. The floors were found quite empty of finds, 328</page><page sequence="331">CONCLUDING REMARKS as if the town was abandoned. The circumstances of this end remain unclear. It was followed by an acute change in the material culture, expressed in the disappearance of Philistine Bichrome pottery and the appearance of the red slip and hand burnish that mark the beginning of Iron IIA (for our conclusions relating to Str. IVB and later see Timnah //, pp. 273-285). The identification of Tel Batash with biblical Timnah is well established ( Timnah /: 3-9). Although the Samson narrative, which portrays Timnah as a Philistine town (Judges 14) is largely a literary creation, it seems that it was rooted in a geopolitical reality dating back to Iron I, when Timnah was a town in the Sorek Valley inhabited at least partially by Philistines. NOTES 1 In this summary I refer only to the Sorek Valley in the northern Shephelah, excluding the eastern and western parts of Nahal Sorek, which are in different geographical zones. 2 An additional EB site is Khirbet Hisham, southwest of Beth-Shemesh; this site includes mainly large stone cairns and its function is as yet unknown. 3 A. Shavit identified several such sites in the Ayalon Valley. In the Sorek Valley, the alluvium may have covered some of the ancient sites. An example of such a "buried" site dating from the Chalcolithic period, only its uppermost part protruding from the alluvial soil, is known south of Kibbutz Sor' ah. 4 For the approach adopted in this volume to the periodization of the second millennium BCE in the Levant, see p. XIV. 5 Gitin and Dothan 1993: 1052. 1 thank Prof. Sy Gitin for clarifying this point. Evidence for an MB IIA settlement was found in the fields of Kibbutz Revadim not far from Tel Miqne (Cohen 2002: 90-91). 6 Rather than being a "tumulus" as defined by Kaplan, it appears that Area B at Teluliyot Batash contained the remains of a MB farmstead, later buried by a heap of stones during agricultural stone removal. 7 For discussion of the social aspects of the construction of MB fortifications, see Finkelstein 1992; Bunimovitz 1992. Their conclusion that the earth ramparts served only as symbols of power and that there were no city walls on or within the ramparts is, in my view, unacceptable. At Tel Batash it is obvious that the massive wall against which the earth rampart was constructed had a superstructure that was also part of the "citadel" in Area B. 8 Note that at Gezer a destruction layer was detected in Fields I and IV but not in Field VI {Gezer IV: 35). 9 The existence of fortifications at LB Gezer is a matter of debate. While Dever and Seger attributed the Outer Wall to this period ( Gezer IV: 46; 1986: 9-34; Seger 1987: 1 19-122), the evidence brought by the excavators is circumstantial, and there is no direct evidence for the dating of this wall. KempiÅski, Zertal, Finkelstein and Bunimovitz have disputed the LB date of this wall (see Finkelstein 1994 with previous bibliography). To their arguments, I would add that the Outer Wall added a substantial area to the MB city. If the wall was indeed founded in the LB, this is the only case in Canaan of a LB city larger than its MB predecessor. In many cases LB cities were much smaller than the MB cities that preceded them. I thus tend to accept the view that the Outer Wall was founded in the Iron Age. 10 The new excavations at Beth-Shemesh are being conducted by S. Bunimovitz and Z. Lederman on behalf of Tel Aviv University. The numbers of Iron Age strata are cited from lectures by the excavators. REFERENCES Braun, E., van den Brink, E. C. M., Gophna, R. and Goren, Y. 2001.
