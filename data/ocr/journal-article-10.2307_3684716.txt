WEISS When you lose your mind, it's great to have a body to fall back on. -Shari (Calvin Klein jeans advertisement) The creation of our world as a habitable milieu is contemporaneous with the celebration of the self as a joyful being. Joy, in its numerous figurations, is a condition of habitability. The origins of art indicate both the continual domestication of the world and the dawn of subjectivity via the celebration of the self as a dualistic creature: technocratic and mystical, domestic and erotic, social and individual. These relationships were codified in the earliest artworks and remain dominant thematic and structural aspects of art. The body.., .is a visible archetype. -Maurice Merleau-Ponty In his book Le geste et la parole, Andre Leroi-Gourhan, the French archaeologist, shows how the origins of art stem from a fascination with regularity within an overbearingly irregular, chaotic world. ... figurative art as such was preceded by something more obscure or more general which corresponds to the deliberate [r flechie] vision of forms. The unusual within forms, a powerful incentive towards figurative concern, existed only from the time at which the subject confronted an organized image of his universe in relation to the objects which enter into his field of perception.... These concretions... directly touch the depths of man's reflective thought.... It is mysterious and even disquieting to discover in nature a sort of congealed reflection of thought of which the unusual is the incentive. Art, contemporaneous with technology, commenced the formation of a cosmos from chaos. This earliest art was not simply an aesthetic brico- lage, but, as Leroi-Gourhan implies, it was rather a primitive version of the Surrealist "object-trouv6" which, in its primal version, included the Sub-Stance No 51, 1986 87</page><page sequence="2">88 Allen S. Weiss contemplation of such regularly formed objects as shells, polished pebbles, and so forth. As Roland Barthes claims, art is a conquest of chance. It was thus through the technique of chance encounter and dis- covery that art had its origins. This was an art of fascination, and the con- templation of these objects was a form of self-reflection: such art was at the origins of subjectivity, a subjectivity founded on narcissism but which entails the structural differentiation of the propriate field, the self, from its milieu. Art began as neither culturally superficial nor mimetic, but rather as an active institutor of change, formation, and criticism. Art commenced as formation, not formalization, as a product of expression and mystery, not as representation. In terms of both formal and psychological/sociological considera- tions, this earliest found art led directly to the first instances of figurative art, the Paleolithic "Venus" figurines, such as the famed Willendorf Venus. Formal analysis of this figurine reveals the repetition of bulbous, rounded, regular forms, such as pervaded the earlier found art, but which now conform to a figurative, stylized presentation of a fertility symbol. Indeed, the formal constitution of this figurine accentuates its erotic, fertile, sexual aspects. Consider the exaggerated sexual and maternal organs, the overabundant flesh, its pregnancy, and especially the manner in which the salient formal lines coverge upon, and accentu- ate, the sexual organs. Furthermore, this figurine is faceless, emphasiz- ing the anonymity and universality of its erotic functions. Psychologically, the origin of such figurines follows directly from the origin of art as fascinating found objects. The infant is fascinated by the mother's body: the formation of the infant's world is a function of the separation of the child from its mother. This separation achieves the cre- ation of the world as a field of objects and a scene of independent actions and desires. Indeed, the mother is the first "thing" thus constituted and objectified (through her absence and the child's desire for her return). Thus a profound homology exists between the ontogenetic creation of the infant's world and the phylogenetic creation of artwork. Art has its origin in, and remains, a matter of fascination. The first figurative "aesthetic" objects, the Venus figurines, were also representations of mothers, i.e., the Great Earth Mother, a symbol of cosmic (and by exten- sion social) cohesion and regeneration. It is entirely appropriate that the first figurative artworks should be the creative figure par excellence, the mother. This creative, regenerative aspect of art is strongly indicated, in all of its self-reflective intent, in a bas-relief found at Laussel, which depicts a Venus figurine holding a horn in the form of a cornucopia (goat's horn): a fertility symbol (the Venus) holding a fertility symbol (the cornucopia, an androgynous symbol of fecundity and regeneration). This is a perfect symbolization of artistic creativity as exteriorization, transformation, objectification, and, ultimately, as narcissistic activity. This is art as sep- aration from the mother: the creation of the world in a form other than the maternal, while still maintaining the formal, symbolic, and libidinal</page><page sequence="3">The Art of Fascination 89 connections to the maternal body. While figurative concerns developed from the originary abstract art of the found objects, symbolic concern was in turn engendered by a parturition from the first figurative art, that is, from the Venus figurines. Hence the Laussel Venus is a presentation of the difference between figuration and abstraction, between represen- tation and symbolism. It is perhaps the earliest example of art about art, in which the figure (Venus) confronts its own symbol (cornucopia). The difference between the literal and the trope is made manifest according to the erotic topos of the body. Oh bliss of tiny creatures that remain for ever in the womb that brought them forth! -Rainer Maria Rilke In her article "Camera Lucida/Camera Obscura," Annette Michelson correctly asserts that the cinematic art of Stan Brakhage is an art of fas- cination. Indeed, in Brakhage's film Window Water Baby Moving, the very structure of fascination and symbolization is parallel to that of the Laussel bas-relief. In this film, treating the birth of the first child of Jane and Stan Brakhage, we first see a montage in which we find Jane, in an advanced stage of pregnancy, shown nude, bathing in water. Her swelled womb is accentuated by framing, lighting, and by the caresses of both her husband and herself. We see here, figuratively, Venus arising from the waters: the birth of Venus. Yet in the second half of the film there is a literal birth, that of their child, which is straightforwardly depicted, in a montage which intersperses earlier shots of Jane in the water with shots of the birth itself, establishing a metaphoric identification of the two sections of the film, of the two births: birth is both literally and symboli- cally presented. Finally, as if to accentuate the creativity of the mother figure beyond being the donor of life and the muse of the artist, she becomes literally creative of the film itself. Immediately after the birth, it is Jane who films Stan, the proud father. Indeed, "By Brakhage" implies "By Stan and Jane Brakhage." In his later epic film, Dog Star Man, which is also partially about the birth of a child and the eroticism of human existence, the Prelude reveals a vast metaphoric sequence which unites the human and the cosmic levels of existence. The central images of this prelude are masculine: the Dog Star Man himself, and the sun, seen from astronomic footage as a close-up with solar flares. Yet a metaphoric equivalence is set up: through formal similarity the sun is equivalent to burns and flares and painted frames in the film, but also to the head of a penis. Thus there is an equiv- alence, an interchangeability, between the cosmic, abstract, and corpo- real dimensions; existence is structured as a series of metaphoric exchanges establishing the relations of microcosmos/macrocosmos/</page><page sequence="4">90 Allen S. Weiss macroanthropos through the filmic montage. And Brakhage is obviously aware of this mode of relationships; witness his aphorism from "The Stars are Beautiful": "The sky is the dead decaying body of God; the stars are glittering maggots."2 This confusion of genre (gender) is manifest in the androgynous fusions of male and female anatomy in Part III of the film, described by Brakhage: Part Three has a "His, Her, and Heart" roll.... Female images are trying to become male and have not succeeded and the males are trying to become female and have not succeeded.... In the "Her" role you see mounds of moving flesh that separate distinguishably into a woman's image, but then become very tortured by attempts to transform into male. It's very Breugelesque in a way; penises replace breasts in flashes of images; then a penis will jut through the eyes; or male hair will suddenly move across the whole scape of the female body.... At some point this ceases and the flesh becomes definitely woman. Then on the "His" role.., .you have the oppo- site occurring: a male mound of flesh which keeps being tortured by a pro- clivity to female imagery; so that, for instance, the lips are suddenly trans- formed into a vagina. Finally the male form becomes distinct. Then, of course, these two dance together as they are superimposed on each other; you get this mound of male-female flesh which pulls apart variously and superimposes upon itself in these mixtures of Breugelesque discoveries, so to speak, or distortions.3 Here the biomorphism, indeed anthropomorphism, suggests both sexual union and androgyny as ultimate union (as did the cornucopia in the Laussel Venus). Yet this union is a precondition for the birth depicted in Part IV of the film, where the female body and function take thematic precedence as the source of creation (as it does once again in yet another of Brakhage's birth films, Thigh Line Lyre Triangular). Through montage, superimposition, and anamorphic distortion Brakhage reestablishes the foundational erotic mythopoeia in a cinema of fascination, in which metaphor is created by distortion and confusion, and is the source of wonder. And we, spectators always, everywhere, looking at, never out of, everything! It fills us. We arrange it. It decays. We re-arrange it, and decay ourselves. -Rainer Maria Rilke Brakhage first utilized an anamorphic lens in filming Dog Star Man (between 1960 and 1964) in order to create those distortions which were</page><page sequence="5">The Art of Fascination 91 foundational for his mythopoeic system. Yet the use of anamorphosis was already well established in modernist art, especially in the work of Sal- vador Dali. In such works as Cranes mous et harpe cranienne (1935), Bureaucrate moyen atmosphdrociphale dans l'attitude de traire du lait d'une harpe cranienne (1933), andJeunefille au crane (1934; a novel addition to the iconography of "Death and the Young Girl" since the young girl depicted is lasciviously fondling an anamorphic projection of a skull), Dali appropriates Holbein's use of an anamorphic skull (The Ambassadors [1533]) to delineate a fantasy world of the perverse imagination, of the unconscious, as was a central task of the Surrealists. Dali utilized ana- morphoses to the limits of distortion: his famous fetishistic crutches support extreme reifications of anamorphic projections. These projec- tions are usually anatomical and result in the creation of some of the most monstrously distorted human figures in art history. In Dali's series of engravings which illustrate a 1933-1934 edition of Lautr6amont's Les chants de Maldoror, the anamorphic skull is the central iconic figure organizing the distortions and metamorphoses of the other figures in the work. While Brakhage uses anamorphosis to create the metaphors of a new mythopoeia, Dali uses anamorphoses to create the integral mon- strosities of the Surrealist dream world. In an article entitled "Objets psycho-atmospheriques-anamor- phiques," Dali offers a theoretical account of the significance of anamor- phosis: such anamorphic objects are fetishes par excellence, which bring to light the depths of the human psyche. Obscure feelings become classifiable, calculable entities, regulated by the light according to the cognitive order of the hardest and most precise anatomies and, in comparison, the finest articulations of crustaceans and armor take on the vague, dubious and amoeboid contours of the most deliquescent medusas and soft watches.4 Anamorphosis is the origin of metamorphosis and reversal into the op- posite (two Freudian dream functions) which bring the unconscious to light. Appropriate to their fetishistic function, the forms taken on by these anamorphic objects are those of the Medusa and the famous Dalinian soft watches of The Persistance of Memory (1931), both detu- mescent phallic objects. The mythical Medusa, whose hair is in the form of writhing phallic snakes, is the symbol of fetishistic fascination and dread: nobody can look directly at Medusa, queen of the underworld, and live. Note that amulets of the Medusa were used to ward off the evil eye: the Medusa is that which cannot be looked at. Hence it is the anathema to spectator- ship, and the antithesis of art objects, which demand the gaze. The fetish, like the Medusa, represents the object that remains invisible, that must be represented by something other than itself. The fetish object is a substitute for that ever absent oxymoron, the female phallus, and for the dreadful mutilation which its absence implies. Yet the fetish may be ob-</page><page sequence="6">92 Allen S. Weiss served. (For Dali, the ultimate fetish object was his own wife, Gala, who exhibits a "gaze that can pierce through walls.") Hence, in terms of the psychological structure of fascination, the interdependence of masculine and feminine functions, of presence and absence, can only be unified in the mythical, utopian corpus of the androgyne. Consider that the Latin root of the word fascination, "fascinum," is defined according to the Oxford Latin Dictionary as: "1: An evil spell, bewitchment. 2: a. The penis. b. a phallic emblem (worn round the neck as a charm). c. a kind of sea- shell." Indeed, the archetypal charm used by the witch to cast an evil spell, to fascinate, is that of the phallus, which is also a form of shell, revealing again the androgynous ambiguity of forms. The Laussel Venus held a cornucopia which was a goat's horn, or perhaps a shell, but which was in any case a bisexual symbol; the etymology of the word "fascinate" reveals a connection between penis and shell, an antithetical sense of a primal word disclosing the antithetical origins of Eros. Objects of fascination are primarily anthropomorphic; the human body is the general archetype of symbolism. The metamorphosis of the body into symbols was the result of Brakhage's use of anamorphoses. Yet Dali's goal was different: Yes! once the symbolic stage is transgressed, the object becomes, and is "verified" by, its own "real constitution" and no longer by the associative evocations of its constitution. Brakhage transforms the literal, the material, the real into the symbolic; Dali transforms the symbolic into the imaginative reality of a sur-realism. The real constitution of things is accustomed to hide itself. -Heraclitus Salvador Dali and Jacques Lacan were both contributors to the Sur- realist journal Minotaure. In fact, Andre Breton arranged a meeting between Dali and Lacan after the publication of Dali's "L'Ane pourri" in the first volume of Surrdalisme au service de la Revolution (July 1930), an article in which Dali sketched out his theory of the paranoic-critical method in painting. This was of concern to Lacan, then working on his thesis, De la psychose paranozaque dans ses rapports avec la personnalitd. Thus it is not surprising to find in Book XI of Lacan's Seminaire, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis, a section on anamorphosis in which he writes: Distortion may lend itself.., to all the paranoiac ambiguities, and every possible use has been made of it, from Arcimboldi to Salvador Dali. I will go so far as to say that this fascination complements what geometrical re- searches into perspective allow to escape from vision. How is it that nobody has ever thought of connecting this with.., the</page><page sequence="7">The Art of Fascination 93 effect of an erection? Imagine a tatoo traced on the sexual organ ad hoc in the state of repose and assuming its, if I may say so, developed form in another state. How can we not see here, immanent in the geometrical dimension-a partial dimension in the field of the gaze, a dimension that has nothing to do with vision as such-something symbolic of the function of the lack, of the appearance of the phallic ghost?' Precisely because of this invisibility of the phallus the picture is a "trap for the gaze" and not a phallic amulet which averts the gaze. In a sense, the telos of the gaze is always the self within the dialectic of existence, whereby the fictional, ideal "I" is in discordance with the real "I." The topological ideal of the ego is that of the constitution of the body Gestalt, the overcoming of the fragmented body: this is achieved (as yet another fiction) in the mirror stage, when the infant sees its own reflection and recognizes it, for the first time, as that of a unified self. The self is unified from without; it is constituted by a doubling, a false reflection which marks the vectors of desire rather than the structure of the real. This fragmented body.., .usually manifests itself in dreams when the movement of the analysis encounters a certain level of aggressive disinte- gration in the individual. It then appears in the form of disjointed limbs, or of those organs represented in exoscopy, growing wings and taking up arms for intestinal persecutions-the very same that the visionary Hieronymous Bosch has fixed, for all time, in painting.' The fragmented body is highly evident in Dali's work. Consider, for example, Construction molle avec des haricots bouillis, Premonition de la guerre civile (1936) or the severed hand in Un Chien andalou, both of which have aggression and death as their central themes. As Lacan found this vision of the fragmented body in Bosch, so too did Brakhage find this vision in Breughel. But he saw it in Breughel as a sign of his own work, in which the body is variously distorted and fragmented. Indeed, if taken as the autobiographical statements that Brakhage intended them to be, the films of this period were manifestations of profound internal agression, and it was through the creation of these films that he achieved a rapprochement with his wife and a reduction of self-destructive im- pulses. The films thus serve a cathartic function in which the representa- tion of the fragmented body permits the integration of the self. The difference between perspectival projection and anamorphic projection parallels and symbolizes the difference between the Gestalt of the whole body and the distorted, fragmented body. As the corporeal aesthetics of both the Venus figurines and of Brakhage's films implies a cosmology, so does the Lacanian psychology of anamorphosis imply an ontology.</page><page sequence="8">94 Allen S. Weiss The mind as bearer of this Being is what is nowhere, what envelops every where. -Maurice Merleau-Ponty Merleau-Ponty, in developing a phenomenological ontology, investi- gated the manner in which the body "is that strange object which uses its own parts as a general system of symbols for the world."' The structural organization of this symbolic system is determined by the fact that: My body is a Gestalt and is co-present in every Gestalt. ... It is a principle of distribution, the pivot of a system of equivalencies, it is the Etwas of which the fragmentary phenomena will be the manifestation..." Thus metaphysics is a function of an expanded notion of sexuality, in which, as for Brakhage, the macrocosmos is a function of corporeality, of an anthropic system which Merleau-Ponty called the "Flesh," encompass- ing the chiasmatic relationships between the flesh of our bodies and the flesh of the world. The body is the scene of the intertwining of inner and outer horizons; it is the fulcrum of the meaningful embodiment of the world. Yet the ideality of the holistic body underlies the reality of the fragmentariness of phenomena, as for Lacan the Ideal-I interacts with the real I in the dialectic of existence. Lacan too subscribed to a micro- cosmos/macrocosmos ontology: I am led, therefore, to regard the function of the mirror-stage as a par- ticular case of the function of the imago, which is to establish a relation between the organism and its reality--or, as they say, between the Innen- welt and the Umwelt. (Lacan, "The Mirror Stage," p. 4) It is at the mirror-stage that the body as Gestalt is formed, and at which the consequent symbolic function arises. If, for Lacan, the representa- tion of the subsequently fragmented body is a psychic aberration, for Merleau-Ponty the fragementary, nonhierarchical, and discontinuous nature of phenomena is an indication of the ruins of Being, of the end of onto-theology. Yet in both cases, the body is the principle of the symbolic distribution of attributes and forms; this entails the notion of the body as the paradigmatic system of articulation of fascination. There are two basic modes of such fascination, structured according to the two primary corporeal structures, male and female. Whence the fascination with the maternal body and the subsequent fascination with that which the maternal body lacks: the phallus. From corporeal arch6 to telos, from one fragmentation to another: the body Gestalt is an ideal situated by its own doubles, its own representations. If anatomy is indeed destiny, as Freud claimed, then there is a dual, bisexual order of destiny, structured according to the two modes of identification, the two types of object choice (narcissistic and anaclitic), and the two modes of fascina-</page><page sequence="9">The Art of Fascination 95 tion. Anatomy is destiny, but it entails a history of illusions, a dialectic without ends. Such a transcendental illusionism is the foundation of both truth and the ego. In "Phenomenalisation, distorsion, logologie,"' Marc Richir develops the implications of this critique of truth for a phenomenolog- ical ontology. Appearances do not dissimulate the truth: they are nothing but themselves, the ruins of Being. "Truth" is just a second- order phenomenon, a distortion, a necessary illusion. T.O.U.C.H.I.N.G. DESTROY que je sais d'elle -Composite graffiti found on a blackboard in the Dept. of Cinema Studies, New York University Paranoia as art; art as criticism; criticism as paranoia. From Surreal- ism through the "visionary" and abstract filmmaking of the American avant garde, there is a modernist hermeticism, gnosticism, orphism in the arts. The eroticized body is once again, as it was at the origins of art, the thematized foundation of an ontology, of an aesthetics. Through a confusion, a montage of genres and styles, we approach that plenitude of presence which is the mark of utopia, a return of knowledge to its corporeal source. We discover that true knowledge is not rational order, but fascination. NOTES 1. Andre Leroi-Gourhan, Le geste et la parole II (Paris: Albin Michel, 1964), p. 214. 2.
