<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rousseau's Organic State Peter V. Conroy, Jr. AS A POLITICAL THESIS, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Du Contrat social has provoked heated debate ever since its publication in 1762. Critics have never stopped trying to prove either the totali- tarian or the democratic consequences of this blueprint for an ideal state. Although titles like Rousseau-Totalitarian or Liberal?' are the most striking, they are not the only ones which address themselves to this question. Behind even the most general of titles, like the Political Philosophy of Rousseau2, critics of all persuasions have felt obliged to resolve the dilemma of Rousseau's government and of the liberty it does, or does not, afford to the individual. Instead of joining this political discussion on the usual practical grounds of how Rousseau's government would actually function if implemented, we would like to propose here a literary reading of the Contrat social. Such an attempt only gives Rousseau his due, since he has always been regarded as a literary figure. A literary reading will restore to Rousseau's political text its poetic aspect, its poetic manner of advancing arguments and of providing explanations. For, beyond the logic and the rational formulation of Rousseau's ideas lies a poetic inspiration which, we believe, provides the ultimate reference for his social and political utopia. In a word, Rousseau's use of metaphor and imagery offers a particularly valuable insight into the successful workings of society as pictured in the Contrat social. The most striking and the most frequent metaphor Rousseau uses throughout the Contrat is organic. He first developed this biological analogy with all its precise anatomical detail in his Discours sur l'Economie politique, which was published in the fifth volume of the Encylopedie in November of 1755: Le corps politique, pris individuellement, peut etre considere comme un corps organise, vivant, et semblable a celui de l'homme. Le pouvoir souverain represente la tete; les lois et</page><page sequence="2">2 Jean-Jacques Rousseau les couitumes sont le cerveau, principe des nerfs et siege de l'entendement, de la volonte, et des sens, dont les juges et magistrats sont les organes; le commerce, l'industrie, et l'agriculture, sont la bouche et l'estomac qui pr6parent la substance commune; les finances publiques sont le sang qu'une sage economie, en faisant les fonctions du coeur, renvoye distribuer par tout le corps la nourriture et la vie: les citoyens sont le corps et les membres qui font mouvoir, vivre, et travailler la machine, et qu'on ne sauroit blesser en aucune partie, qu'aussi-tot l'impression douloureuse ne s'en porte au cerveau, si l'animal est dans un etat de sant6.3 The Contrat social uses this organic formulation as a starting point and then proceeds to a much more subtle and mature handling of this basic intuition that the state is a living organism much like a human body. Both Lester Crocker and Judith Shklar have noticed this metaphor in the Contrat. However, the former does not follow through on his occasional remarks' while the latter dismisses it as unimportant.5 One of Rousseau's early twentieth-century editors, C. E. Vaughan, criticized this same organic metaphor. He claimed that it reduced the individual to a state of slavery, depriving him of any freedom since it implied that he could have no life, no will separate from that of the state.6 Later, Robert Derathd disagreed with Vaughan. He disputed the latter's assumption that Rousseau was using the comparison seriously. For him, it is only a convenient, banal image, a "pis-aller," an inadequacy in Rousseau's language which should not be taken literally.7 Most readers today would probably tend to agree with Derath6 since we do speak so easily, both in French and English, of the "body politic." Furthermore, the organic image has been used extensively by numerous other writers, thereby dulling our appreciation of its original force and impact. Nevertheless, if we try to recreate the eighteenth-century French context for such political discussion, we immediately see how original Rousseau was in choosing this metaphor. Even though it was known and used long before him, Rousseau differs radically from other con- temporary political theorists like Montesquieu in his choice of images. The latter's influence was predominant in treatises about government during the second half of the century. For him, a mechanical image best describes the operations of government, as in this passage where honor functions according to the mechanical laws of physics: Vous diriez qu'il en est comme du systeme de l'univers, oiu il y a une force qui dloigne sans cesse du centre tous les corps,</page><page sequence="3">SAB 3 et une force de pesanteur qui les y ramene. L'honneur fait mouvoir toutes les parties du corps politique.8 Like the commonly held interpretations of Newton's physics, which imagined the cosmos as a well-balanced machine running along invisible tracks, as well as the decidedly rational and less spiritual theology of deism, which viewed God as a master clock- maker winding up the mechanism of the universe, this mechanical image describes a government of separate blocks, weights and counterweights whose intricate balancing constitutes the essence of statesmanship. Kingsley Martin expresses the eighteenth-century ideal of mechanical government thus: Montesquieu's constitutional theory was based on Newtonian physics. In his early work he appears to have had a firmer grasp of the organic idea of the State than any other eighteenth- century writer, but his final political theory, in which each power is separate and related to the others only by a system of checks and balances, is entirely mechanical. The whole phraseology and conception is taken from mechanics: the State is a vast piece of engineering in which each joist is kept in place and made to do its work by an exact calculation of strains and stresses, held in place by a balance here, itself checking another joist, correctly attached and related to its neighbor. Since there is no animating principle, no directing head or organic life, the result would seem to, be motionless equilibrium.9 Such mechanics best explains the division and separation of powers that Montesquieu thought he found in the English parliamentary system and which were incorporated into the American constitu- tion. This mechanical image was the standard eighteenth-century conception of government, the habitual point of comparison in theoretical discussion. Rousseau broke with that whole tradition in his Contrat, rejecting the mechanical image and preferring to it an organic metaphor. Of course, he did not invent the organic image. Already in the eighteenth century it had a long history behind it, dating back at least as far as Aristotle. Hobbes had used it in his Leviathan. So Rousseau was not breaking entirely new ground in adapting it to a political context. Nonetheless, he should be credited with introducing, at least in France, this organic concept which motivates an entirely new plan for government, one in which ordinary people are recognized as living beings and not as objects or weights to be swung about in some minister's balancing act.</page><page sequence="4">4 Jean-Jacques Rousseau The organic metaphor brings important qualifications and cri- tical modifications to the stark, dehumanized political theory which so many have heretofore found in the Contrat. This poetic image breathes life into what could be a deathly dull treatise and thereby humanizes (in a literal as well as metaphorical sense) Rousseau's entire discussion. By neglecting this imagery as an essential part of the whole argument, we could easily interpret the Contrat in a manner Rousseau did not intend. On the other hand, giving this organic metaphor its rightful place as the standard for judging the state and as a true analogy for governmental operations permits a more sympathetic reading. To the extent that the state functions like a living organism, Rousseau's commitment to individual free- dom within this social order becomes evident. While it is central to the successful operation of Rousseau's society, this organic metaphor is never as fully enunciated in the Contrat as it was in the Discours sur 1'Economie politique. Rather it remains elusive, fully realized as a poetic metaphor but too subtle, fragmentary and indirect to figure as a full-blown political or philosophical concept. To read the Contrat as a literary or poetic text requires therefore a discursive, non-linear approach. To discover Rousseau's deepest meaning, which is paradoxically both conveyed and hidden by its very nature as metaphor, we have to examine the various uses and contexts of this organic image and relate them to the political issues he is discussing simultaneously but on a different level. Merely by using the organic metaphor, Rousseau posits that a biological organism, a human body offers the best analogy for the ideal political state: Le principe de la vie politique est dans l'autorite souveraine. La puissance legislative est le coeur de l'Etat, la puissance executive en est le cerveau, qui donne le mouvement i toutes les parties.10 Constantly reappearing as a point of comparison, in critical se- mantic choices and through purposeful ambiguity, this metaphor provides a description of the functioning of the state that is as rich in suggestive power as it is weak in practical political terms: . . . cet acte d'association product un corps moral et collectif compose d'autant de membres que l'assemblee a de voix, lequel renoit de ce meme acte son unite, son moi commun, sa vie et sa volonte. Cette personne publique qui se forme ainsi par l'union de toutes les autres prenoit autrefois le nom de Cite, et prend maintenant celui de Republique ou de corps politi- que ... (361-362)</page><page sequence="5">SAB 5 For Rousseau, the act of association is almost biological: it changes those contracting from separate, discrete individuals into one new entity, just as the different cells or organs lose their individuality to become one human body. The "happy moment" of entering into the social pact is then a biological transformation that politically creates a new civil state out of the former natural condition, just as organically it makes "d'un animal stupide et borne [ . . ] un etre intelligent et un homme." (364). Many political analysts have broken with Rousseau precisely at this point because they find the seeds of despotism and tyranny (even if it is that of the majority) in this subordination of the individual to the group. However valid such a criticism may be in political science, it strikes wide of the mark here since Rousseau is dealing more with poetic analogy than with practical politics. This loss of individuality without any tyrannical implications is perfectly valid and natural in biology, and biology is the source of Rousseau's image. To show one perfectly legitimate use of this biological model, including its subordination of individual parts to a whole entity, we can point to the first letter to the Corinthians, in which the Apostle Paul develops the concept of the mystical body of the church, an in- visible, spiritual union of all Christians in one "body" whose head is Christ: For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. For the body is not one member, but many. If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. And if they were all one member, where were the body? But now are they many members, yet but one body. And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: And those mem- bers of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. For the comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which</page><page sequence="6">6 Jean-Jacques Rousseau lacked: That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.1 No repression or tyranny exists here even though each part of the body is subordinated to the whole because each member ac- cepts its role. The forceful negation, "And the eye cannot say . .," as well as the conditional/subjunctive tense, implying an un- real, impossible action, "And if the foot shall say .. .," both are based on a classical ideal of social harmony which prefers the larger group over the individual unit, in contrast to our modern and romantic practice of (even extreme) individualism. Like Rousseau, Paul would claim that each part best achieves its free- dom and individuality when it cooperates with the whole organism and not when it follows its own particular will. Although, based on our modern experience of democracy and dictatorship, we may deny that Rousseau and Paul have understood the practical side of government, we cannot therefore misrepresent their intentions and declare their organic analogy intrinsically tyrannical. We em- phasize the individual's right to dissent, and perhaps even en- courage this, as an infallible sign of liberty at work. The possibility of dissenting, however, which can, when it becomes obligatory, be seen as another form of tyranny, should not obscur the individual's right to conform. Rousseau is using this biological analogy not to slip us into despotism, but rather to depict powerfully a poetic ideal of social harmony. And, we should remember, any poetic metaphor will disintegrate under a careful, rational, scientific, unimaginative and even hostile scrutiny. Throughout the Contrat social, Rousseau continuously employs certain-terms whose ambiguity allows us to glimpse the organic model behind his political state. Some are proper semantic choices for a political discussion; in the context of their redundancy, their ancillary meanings and their relationship to the human body, how- ever, many also resonate with a clear organic ring. Terms like corps and personne stand out as obvious examples. So does a word like membres which means both "members of an organization" and "limbs of a body." Prince and souverain normally refer to specific, living individuals and thus are humanly oriented before Rousseau adapts them into impersonal, abstract and collective nouns, as in this passage:</page><page sequence="7">SAB 7 J'appelle donc Gouvernement ou supreme administration l'exercice legitime de la puissance executive, et Prince ou magistrat l'homme ou le corps charge de cette administration. (396) Almost all the words he chooses to describe the functions of government hint at some latent, anthropomorphic nature: for example, the government's volonte generale or particuliere, its vie, its voix. Although each of these terms could be replaced by a less ambivalent one, Rousseau seems to pick precisely those words which suggest that the moral life, the invisible existence of this state resembles that of a human being: I1 faut donc a la force publique un agent propre qui la reunisse et la mette en oeuvre selon les directions de la volonte generale, qui serve a la communication de l'Etat et du Souverain, qui fasse en quelque sorte dans la personne publique ce que fait dans l'homme l'union de l'ame et du corps. (396) Having made the connection between a living human body and the political system, Rousseau does not hesitate to elaborate upon his basic biological conceit. The "degeneration" - the word itself has an organic connotation - of the state is therefore equated to the death of a human being: "C'est-la le vice inherent et inevitable qui des la naissance du corps politique tend sans relache a le d6truire, de meme que la vieillesse et la mort detruisent le corps de l'homme." (421) Organically inspired terms like corps politique (echoed in corps de l'homme) and naissance take on their full anthropomorphic weight. Following the logic imposed by the organic image, states are subject to the same biological laws of mortality as any other living organism: Telle est la pente naturelle et inevitable des Gouvernemens les mieux constitu6s. Si Sparte et Rome ont p&amp;ri, quel Etat peut esperer de durer toujours? Si nous voulons former un etablissement durable, ne songeons donc point a le rendre eternel. Pour reussir il ne faut pas tenter l'impossible, ni se flatter de donner a l'ouvrage des hommes une solidite que les choses humaines ne comportent pas. (424) Like any other living creature, political states die. The ambig- uous phrase choses humaines carries two distinct meanings simul- taneously. On one hand it means "human activity," but at the same time, furthering the organic image, it suggests that the state is itself a "human thing," that is to say a living organism, a true body. By its grammatical formation choses humaines also recalls the Latin term designating the state, res publica (literally, the</page><page sequence="8">8 Jean-Jacques Rousseau public thing). Such a choice of words would be most appropriate in this passage about Rome, especially for Rousseau who prided himself on his knowledge of Latin. Rousseau's continual references to the organic image and his reliance on it as an ultimate criterion for judging a political system also develop a negative strategy. In addition to spelling out what the state should be, he also declares what it should not be. To refute the theory which underlines the mechanical image of govern- ment, namely that political power should be separated and divided into parts, Rousseau draws on a human analogy. Sovereignty, he argues, can no more be successfully divided into separate branches than a human body can be cut up into pieces: Mais nos politiques ne pouvant diviser la souverainete dans son principe, la divisent dans son objet; ils la divisent en force and en volonte, en puissance legislative et en puissance executive [ .. .] Ils font du Souverain un etre fantastique et forme de pieces rapportees; c'est comme s'ils composoient l'homme de plusieurs corps dont l'un auroit des yeux, l'autre des bras, l'autre des pieds, et rien de plus. Les charlatans du Japon depecent, dit-on, un enfant aux yeux des spectateurs, puis jettant en I'air tous ses membres l'un apres l'autre, ils font retomber l'enfant vivant et tout rassemble. Tels sont a peu pres les tours de gobelets de nos politiques. (369-370) Numerous other indications show that Rousseau is patterning his political structure on a living, organic model. We have already seen anthropomorphic words like corps, personne and membres which, in addition to their political significance, strike organic chords as they reappear throughout the Contrat. Constitution belongs to both the organic and political vocabularies. Not only does it indicate the written document or the action which first forms a state, but it also (at least in this context, where such an- cillary meanings are encouraged and echoed) refers to the general health, the physiological formation, the organic make-up of a living being. Rousseau has developed his text so that both these meanings are appropriate and pertinent. Another such term is chef. Etymologically derived from the Latin caput, the head of a body, a meaning preserved in the eighteenth century by express- ions like couvre-chef (hat or headgrear), it obviously has organic connotations in addition to its political sense of "leader." 'When Rousseau claims that all states ultimately derive from one human model, the family, he uses chef in both senses: La plus ancienne de toutes les societes et la seule naturelle est celle de la famille [ . .. ] La famille est donc si l'on veut</page><page sequence="9">SAB 9 le premier modele des societes politiques; le chef est l'image du pere, le peuple est l'image des enfants. (352) Chef sustains the organic metaphor not only in the family model but also in another living, and in that sense organic, image of society, the herd: Comme un patre est d'une nature superieure a celle de son troupeau, les pasteurs d'hommes, qui sont leurs chefs, sont aussi d'une nature superieure a celle de leurs peuples. (353, my italics) Ainsi voila l'espece humaine divisee en troupeaux de betail, dont chacun a son chef, qui le garde pour le devorer. (353, my italics) Loaded with organic significance, either because of its etymology, like chef, or because of the context which can accommodate double or ambiguous terms, like constitution, such words continuously recall the organic principle, the human body analogy which Rousseau's text continuously implies. Once he has firmly estab- lished the similarity between the state and the individual human being, Rousseau can employ a medical analogy to illustrate in human terms what takes place in society. Patients who fear their doctors are compared to those social groups which refuse healthy reform: quand une fois les coutumes sont etablies et les prejuges en- racines, c'est une entreprise dangereuse et vaine de vouloir les reformer; le peuple ne peut pas meme souffrir qu'on touche a ses maux pour les detruire, semblable a ces malades stupides et sans courage qui fremissent a l'aspect du m6decin. (385) When Rousseau tackles the difficult problem of representation, the organic metaphor helps to clarify the situation. He reasons that if citizens attempt to represent their rights through inter- mediaries, they lose those rights by the very attempts at repre- sentation, since rights can only be exercised personally: Sit6t que le service public cesse d'etre la principale affaire des Citoyens, et qu'ils aiment mieux servir de leur bourse que de leur personne, l'Etat est deja pres de sa ruine. [ . . . ] C'est le tracas du commerce et des arts, c'est l'avide interet du gain, c'est la molesse et l'amour des comodites, qui changent les services personnels en argent. (428-429) We recognize here Rousseau's familiar complaint against civiliza- tion, culture and the arts. But an awareness of the underlying organic metaphor helps us to see, in this brief against society, that particular operation which Rousseau criticizes and refuses</page><page sequence="10">10 Jean-Jacques Rousseau to accept. If it is to remain a living organism, the political body cannot replace organic activities with inert, inactive substances. When organic process is transformed into inorganic matter, the state dies. Rousseau therefore rejects the substitution of bourse for personne and later of argent for services personnels. Donnez de l'argent, et bientot vous aurez des fers. Ce mot de finance est un mot d'esclave; il est inconnu dans la Cite. Dans un Etat vraiment libre les citoyens font tout avec leurs bras et rien avec de l'argent: Loin de payer pour s'exempter de leurs devoirs, ils payeroient pour les remplir eux-memes. (429) With its antitheses and parallel phrasing, the rhetoric here clearly distinguishes the two poles of the argument. Rousseau is opposing living arms to inert metals: bras actualizes the organic meaning of membre who, as citizen (political sense), achieves his true liberty in this ideal organic state by living his civic duties, while lifeless argent can only deteriorate, both symbolically and chemically, like the dead and deadly matter that it is, into fers. As this opposition bras-fers implies, Rousseau demands for his ideal state a living government which functions according to organic processes and not according to an inert and static equili- brium. Any stasis of the vital functions and activity would be a synonym for the death of the body politic. Continuous biological activity in a living organism offers the model for Rousseau's definition of law, "l'action du corps entier agissant sur lui-meme, c'est-a-dire le rapport du tout au tout, ou de Souverain i l'Etat." (393) Following through on this image, Rousseau ends the chapter on laws by declaring that the most important laws are not those that have been written on inert materials but rather those found in living organs: A ces trois sortes de loix, il s'en joint une quatrieme, la plus importante de toutes; qui ne se grave ni sur le marbre ni sur l'airain, mais dans les coeurs des citoyens; qui fait la veritable constitution de l'Etat .... (394) Rousseau's organic, biological model for the political state is im- plicit in this conceit, that the heart, the living human organ par excellence, ultimately plays a more important role in government than inert substances, whether the later be the marbre and airain laws are written on, or the argent and fers which corrupt man's heartfelt desire for liberty. Rousseau's commitment to this biological model cannot be fully appreciated without further reference to the rival, mechanical metaphor which, as we have already seen, was the one preferred</page><page sequence="11">SAB 11 by most other French eighteenth-century writers on politics and government. They found in the scientific thinking of the times (Newtonian physics, deistic religion) an inspiration that Rousseau discovered in the century's incipient enthusiasm for nature and for nature on its own terms. Still, he did not free himself en- tirely from the mechanical way of thinking. Especially in those passages where he is most in debt to Montesquieu concerning the influence of climate, habitat and history on the form of govern- ment, Rousseau couches his ideas in rigid, mathematical terms. These formulas, often based on inverse proportions, recall the mechanical image according to which government is some large machine whose various parts are counterbalanced by each other. Thus, a discussion of the importance and the value of individual votes in an election ends in a mathematical and mechanical compu- tation: Que le peuple soit compose de cent-mille hommes, l'etat des sujets ne change pas, et chacun porte egalement tout l'empire des loix, tandis que son suffrage, reduit a un cent-millieme, a dix fois moins d'influence [than in a state of ten thousand] (lans leur redaction. Alors, le sujet restant toujours un, le rapport du Souverain augmente en raison du nombre des Citoyens. D'ou il suit que plus l'Etat s'aggrandit, plus la liberte diminue. (397) Despite occasional mechanistic passages like these, Rousseau is basically faithful to his organic metaphor. Whenever he mixes these two inspirations, the organic metaphor remains the operant one, dominating the passage and flavoring it with its own specific tonality. The organic, human image then softens the heretofore inhuman element in the machine analogy: Ainsi la volonte du peuple, et la volonte du Prince, et la force publique de l'Etat, et la force particuliere du Gouverne- ment, tout r6pond au meme mobile, tous les ressorts de la machine sont dans la meme main, tout marche au meme but, il n'y a point de mouvemens opposes qui s'entredetruisent, et l'on ne peut imaginer aucune sorte de constitution dans laquelle un moindre effort produise une action plus con- siderable. Archimede assis tranquillement sur le rivage et tirant sans peine a flot un grand Vaisseau, me represente un monarque habile, gouvernant de son cabinet ses vastes Etats, et faisant tout mouvoir en paroissant immobile. (408) Archimedes was the greatest mechanic of antiquity, and could perform incredible feats thanks to his knowledge of physics, weights, counterweights and pullies. But he is also an individual, a real human being who can "represent" the monarch. Like souverain,</page><page sequence="12">12 Jean-Jacques Rousseau prince and a few other such terms, monarch would ordinarily mean, for Rousseau, some abstract power, some intellectualized function of government. Here, however, it signifies an individual, one human being in command, like Archimedes. The abstract meaning disappears in favor of its particular, concrete sense, just as the machine with its ressorts and counterbalancing movements is effaced by the man Archimedes. Rousseau continues to humanize his machine image, and sacrifices it to his organic metaphor: "Avec un levier suffisant, d'un doigt on peut ebranler le monde, mais pour le soutenir il faut les epaules d'Hercule" (410). From levers to shoulders, from machine to muscle, from unnamed, abstract and general governmental functions of prince, souverain or magistrat to particular individuals like Archimedes and Hercules, from a mechanical viewpoint to an organic, living image of the nature and operation of the political state: this progression clearly demonstrates that Rousseau, at the deepest poetic level, in his use of images, understood the state to be a living organism, a type of human body. Lester Crocker is correct when he points out that, for us today, Rousseau's use of an organic image does not neces- sarily guarantee that his political state will be an authentic demo- cracy in which the individual is truly free12 But, on the other hand, any attempt to understand how Rousseau's social contract functions that does not take this human model into account is doomed from the outset. To understand how Rousseau himself imagined his political state, we must begin by analyzing his images, the metaphors which nourish and sustain at every step his formu- lation of its component parts. Any real appreciation of Rousseau's politics begins with a literary reading of his text. The key to Du Contrat social and to Rousseau's conception of the ideal political state lies in his literary imagination, in the metaphors which ex- plain better than mere words his dreams and his ideals.
