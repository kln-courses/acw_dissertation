<plain_text><page sequence="1">BARBARA TUCHANSKA MARXISM AS THE FOUNDATION OF PHILOSOPHIES OF SCIENCE The Case ofG. Luk?cs' Ontology of Social Being As the title suggests, Marxist philosophy constitutes ? or can constitute ? the foundation for philosophical investigations of science. From the standpoint of the philosophy of science the question arises whether Marxist philosophy develops concepts of knowledge in general and science in particular, the application of which could serve to resolve problems in the philosophy of science. I raise this question with an eye to Luk?cs' doctrine set forth in his Ontology of Social Being, though the answer I will propose does not in my opinion pertain only to this Marxist conception. The question whether Marxism comprises ideas helpful in resolving problems in the philosophy of science assumes that Marxist concep tions in the philosophy of science have not been effective; in my opinion this is in fact the case. In order to justify this conviction and eventually delineate the sources of the difficulty, we need first of all to be clear about the problems confronting contemporary philosophy of science, in particular with regard to what has come to be called methodology. The latter pertains not to the content of science as such, but to the means of attaining scientific knowledge, the forms of its expression, and the mechanisms responsible for the changes in its content. 1. THE PROBLEMS OF CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE To be sure, it is no simple task to decide which are the issues that presently trouble philosophers of science. Chances are no judgment on this matter will gain universal assent. Still this possibility does not preclude the attempt to identify those issues, if only better to orientate oneself in the context of the philosophy of science.

Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">2 BARBARA TUCHANSKA myself a certain right to a subjective diagnosis, and without claiming to provide a complete enumeration, I believe that the controversial problems in the actual philosophy of science arise chiefly out of the post-Popperian conception of science, viz., scientific method, the paradox of conceptual incommensurability, and the mechanism of scientific development.1 The most essential component of the first issue is the problem of the principles governing the acceptance of a scientific theory. In this connection, the question concerns the epistemological justification of the rules of theory acceptance, even though the philosophy of science also seeks the rules scientists in fact use in accepting theories. The issue of scientific method is treated in two fundamental ways: the inductivist and the falsificationist. Thanks to Popper, the idea of falsification has become a standard conception in the philosophy of science, with the result that there are far fewer proponents of the inductivist model. This fact does not mean, however, that Popper's falsificationist model has become the universally accepted view of scientific method. It is enough to cite Kuhn and Lakatos whose conceptions go considerably beyond Popper's model, modifying it more or less fundamentally. For advocates of these different standpoints the matter has no doubt been finally resolved; but objectively considered this is hardly the case. If we take into account Feyerabend's critical analyses, or the data brought together by historians of science, then we see how problematic the belief becomes, at the heart of these conceptions, about the overall unity of scientific method, or ? in more cautious formulations ? of mature science. Moreover, in as much as Popperian fallibilism brought out the conventional nature of the "empirical basis" and the role of decision in the empirical sciences, which appear to consist more in choices and decisions than justifications and proofs as in formal sciences, it brought out the psycho-social aspect of scientific method and theory acceptance. In my opinion this aspect has still to be scrutinized adequately by the philosophy of science. The paradox of incommensurability is a problem that came to light as soon as attention shifted from the acceptance of a single, isolated theory, in order to consider the more realistic situation of choosing between two or more competing theories. In other words, the issue arose as soon as the problem of the principles of theory acceptance was replaced by that of the principles of choice of the better theory.</page><page sequence="3">MARXISM AND SCIENCE 3 In this context Kuhn and Feyerabend showed that it is insufficient to restrict consideration of the relations between competing or successive theories to syntactic-logical analyses. It often happens that theories differ conceptually and therefore involve distinct ontologies; such theories are conceptually incommensurable, i.e., the same expressions have different meanings in each theory and no common conceptual 'measure' is available. Some philosophers regard as a problem the very existence in science of such incommensurability, requiring a non linguistic conception of the transition from one theory to another. On the other hand, for those who agree that theory change cannot be described in purely syntactic-logical terms, the problem of how to describe the transition between incommensurable theories is still open. The paradox of incommensurability comes into view in the fact that scientists who pay allegiance to incommensurable theories nevertheless communicate with one another, alter their theoretical options, or, despite having been trained in the traditions of a given theory, manage to construct theories which are incommensurable with it. Both the paradox of incommensurability and the overall conceptuali zation of theory conflict and choice require analysis of the psycho social dimension of scientific activity. These considerations are perti nent likewise to the question of the development of science. Popper's conception of the Third World is not a convincing solution to the problem of the mechanism of scientific development for those who see in his conception of rational criticism a postulate describing an idealized course of scientific development, rather than a realistic answer to the question of why real science develops as it does. The theory proposed by Popper, which treats the development of science as a succession of hypotheses, falsifying tests and problems, is ? seemingly ? realistic to the extent that it can be compared with the facts of the history of science. However, in answering the question of why science develops in this manner, Popper postulates the existence of an objective rationality the only empirical manifestation of which is just this very development of science. Conceptions like those of Kuhn or Lakatos, which attempt more realistic answers to these questions, also involve a vision of the way science develops, viz., by way of paradigm shifts or the competition of research programs. Answers to the question of why real science happens to develop as it does are sketched only in the most general lines in both of these conceptions. In Lakatos' case the answer</page><page sequence="4">4 BARBARA TUCHANSKA is quite rationalistic, and hence close to Popper's, though Lakatos does admit the possibility, and even the need for, psycho-social explanations. Kuhn provides just such a psycho-social explanation in so far as he points to psychological phenomena (in the concept of paradigm as a way of seeing the world which he articulates by means of the categories of Gestalt psychology), social phenomena (the interaction of scientific communities), or language (the occurrence in science of language games in Wittgenstein's sense). It seems to me that, in its answers to these and other questions, contemporary philosophy of science is seeking the determinants of scientific development in psycho-social factors. If this is indeed the case, then Marxist philosophy, laden as it were with a sociological content and attuned not only to the psycho-social, but to the macro social, historical, dimensions of human affairs, is specially well-suited to sustaining and developing this tendency. In Poland, an attempt of this sort was undertaken by the Poznan school of methodologists. The historical epistemology of Jerzy Kmita and the idealizational theory of science constructed by Leszek Nowak envisaged science as belonging to social practice. According to them, science is a sphere of practice determined by more fundamental types of praxis. Kmita and Nowak describe the peculiarity of scientific practice firstly through a structural interpretation of scientific activity, i.e., through a description of its constituent acts and their (cognitive) subjective aims, and secondly through a description of the social functions of scientific practice. The structural view of science is formulated in these theories with the help of concepts such as those of scientific theory, methodological rules, truth as the goal of science, scientific progress, etc. While these concepts correspond to the traditional doctrines of logical empiricism and Popperian fallibilism, Kmita and Nowak have also introduced some new conceptions. The latter include, among others, Kimta's concept of an objective context of practice to which scientific theories refer as distinct from the semantical models of these theories; his assumption that a condition for the acceptance of a certain theory by a scientific community is that the theory corresponds to some body of non scientific, commonsense beliefs; the concept introduced by Nowak of idealization and the idealized nature of scientific laws.</page><page sequence="5">MARXISM AND SCIENCE 5 The functional approach to science is articulated by Kmita and Nowak on the basis of historical materialist theory. According to Kmita, historical materialism is a theory of social practice consisting of rational, social actions. According to Nowak, historical materialism is concerned with socio-economic structures. Kmita characterizes the social functions of science by means of a concept of functional deter mination: science is functionally determined in its content by other, more fundamental, forms of praxis. Scientific results are "responses" to the "needs" of these more fundamental forms of practice. The contents of the social experience of non-scientific types of praxis are deductively systematized and codified, or projected by science. Nowak describes the social function of science by means of a con cept of adaptation: science adapts to the needs of the socio-economic base in order to make social practice more efficient. "The global effect of a cognitive process is the amelioration of non-cognitional praxis, primarily production, which, in turn, stimulates the further growth of science."2 The socio-economic base exercizes its influence on science by way of ideological and philosophical doctrines. From a set of currently possible doctrines those are selected in the socio-economic basis which are most beneficial to its development. In turn, as ideo logical and philosophical doctrines are the foundations of scientific theories, they determine the content and methods of science. Science contributes to the development of the socio-economic basis by project ing new means of production, new social, especially economic, rela tions, new political and legislative structures, etc. It can be fairly said that the theories elaborated in the Poznan school harmonize neopositivist philosophy of science with historical materi alism. Kmita and Nowak suggest a picture of the social determinants of science. However, although these theories are fairly adequate recon structions of Marx' view of the relation between science and society, they nevertheless fail to explain the mechanism of the social determina tion of science. Kmita and Nowak assure us that certain relations exist between science and society, but they fail to show how they actually come about, i.e., which social institutions, mechanisms, or processes are responsible for the functional determination of science. The difficulty they have in bringing to light the mechanism in question is due, in my opinion, to the fact that the concepts of science which they use are first</page><page sequence="6">6 BARBARA TUCHANSKA of all epistemological and methodological in content, but are carried over without modification into the conceptual framework of historical materialism. In short, both writers accept an epistemological and methodological concept of science, insofar as they regard science as a set of activities directed to realizing determinate cognitive values by means of specific methodological rules. They then plug this concept into the framework of historical materialism in such a way as to add to the epistemological and methodological features of science the property of being a type of social practice. The concept of science formed in this way then plays a role in considerations about what is determined by the socio-economic base and what determines it. What is particularly worrisome about Kmita's and Nowak's approach is the fact that it is burdened by a fundamental categorial inconsistency: on the structural level they conceive science in epistemological and methodological categories, whereas on the functional level science is characterized by them as a particular type of social practice. The way in which Kmita and Nowak conceive science and charac terize its social functions is not unusual in Marxist theory. The sources of this approach lie, in my opinion, within the structure of Marxist philosophy, or at least in one of its versions. A particularly good example of this is Luk?cs' ontology of social being. Its logical form is such that it imposes, as it were, an epistemological and methodological conception of science and therefore blocks the resolution of the problem of the social determinants of science. To be sure, Luk?cs' ontology is not the basis of Kmita's and Nowak's conceptions, but it does share with them certain essential assumptions. It serves my purpose, because it was intended to be a fundamental, all-encompassing system that would enable study of any social phenomenon, including science, to which Luk?cs paid but passing attention. 2. LUK?CS' VIEW OF COGNITION Luk?cs makes clear that his ontology of social being is a component of general ontology, i.e., the ontology of inorganic nature. Social being is a particular, complex form of being, a specific sphere of reality, "in which practice has the role conditio sine qua non of the maintenance and continuation of objectivities {Gegenst?ndlichkeiten), their reproduction</page><page sequence="7">MARXISM AND SCIENCE 7 and further development toward higher forms (H?herentwicklung)" (I, 6?9).3 The ontology of social being is based on three initial assump tions: 1) the ontological primacy of objective reality, 2) the subjectivity of its reflection, and 3) the constitutive nature of practice, in a subjec tive as well as in an objective sense (I, 7?8). Below I will concentrate on the second assumption. According to Luk?cs, labor is a complex consisting of two hetero nymous (i.e., non-independent) acts that make up the "ontological basis of the specific nature of social being." These acts are, on one hand, "the most exact possible reflection of the reality involved" and, on the other hand, "the positing of those causal chains which are, as we know, indispensable to the realization of teleological positing" (II, 38). Luk?cs provides a structural-functional, not a genetic, analysis of subjective reflection (Widerspiegelung), since in his opinion the former is the appropriate setting for ontological research. As seen from this perspec tive subjective reflection is a necessary structural condition of social being. Reflection is specific to man, since animals do not create concepts, nor is their activity more than biological reaction that cannot give rise to a distinction between subject and object (II, 84). In accord ance with Luk?cs' first assumption, the object exists independently of the subject and becomes an object of consciousness (II, 84), whereas the subject is able to reflect objects by means of acts of consciousness and appropriate them cognitively in an active way, that is ascribe to them the property of being things in themselves without thereby changing their objective nature (I, 62; II, 84, 560?1). Precisely this subject-object distinction is the basis of the "specifically human mode of existence" (II, 39). As Luk?cs affirms, "Were the subject, who in consciousness is already distinct from the world, not in a position to conceive the world and reproduce it as it is in its own being, the act of positing a goal, which lies at the basis of even the most primitive labor, could never appear" (II, 39). The reflection of reality, occurring as a result of the subject-object separation in an essentially linguistic, conceptual form, appears at the structural level as a necessary condition of the labor and practice constituting social being (II, 83, 560). For this reason the general ontology which accedes to the "general ontic foundations of every particular being" is more than merely an ontology of non-organic nature. It is likewise a theory of knowledge, a</page><page sequence="8">8 BARBARA TUCHANSKA theory of reflection, since the category of reflection is logically prior to the category of social being, at least in the sense that the concept of social being depends on that of reflection as the condition of labor which in turn constitutes the practice that makes up social being. Despite Luk?cs' warnings not to shunt general ontology onto the side track of the theory of knowledge, that is in fact the logical order of his categories. What is more, Luk?cs fails to describe reflection in an unequivocal way, since even though reflection in itself is not an entity, it is causally determined (for Luk?cs causal determination is a charac teristic of the domain of things in themselves) and can distance itself from the "practically given cause, which in the biological sense calls forth awareness of it and requires paying attention to it," thanks to which it can represent the object "as it is in reality, in itself, independ ently of the vital relations joining it [the object ? B. T.] to man" (II, 551). It might be objected that the foregoing presentation is inadequate to, trivializes, Luk?cs' effort to construct, as he puts it, "a dialectical theory of reflection" which is "the ontology of the emergence, as well as the further perfection (of reflection)," and "shows the dynamics of the reciprocal relation of the subject and object of practice" (II, 562). In terms of this dialectical theory, reflection has its ontic foundation in man's biological activity, although it acquires its specific nature through labor which conditions it to become a moment of social being. How ever, this interpretation, which rejects the claim that Luk?cs' ontology comprises a theory of knowledge that would thereby be prior to the ontological conception of social being grounded in general ontology, overlooks two important factors motivating Luk?cs' project, viz., the notion of a qualitative leap separating social being from organic nature, and the distinction between the structural and the genetic orders of consideration of social being. In point of fact, the two factors are closely allied to one another. The notion of the qualitative leap returns time and again in Luk?cs' work. Thanks to the qualitative leap "man unfolds a new kind of activity, the essence of which can no longer be conceived with the help of any natural category whatsoever" (II, 543). It consists in labor and language without which there can be no talk about social being at all (II, 542). The factor determining the specificity of human activity is</page><page sequence="9">MARXISM AND SCIENCE 9 consciousness through which social being acquires an ideal moment (II, 543?4, 547?9). Unlike animal consciousness, human consciousness, together with its most important constituents, viz., teleological positings and causal knowledge, is not "an epiphenomenon of the biological reproductive process," it does not take its course in accordance with biological laws (II, 36, 52, 550). On the contrary, human consciousness frees itself of the reproductive process to become relatively autonomous. The category of the qualitative leap is meant to help in understand ing the ontological, that is to say structural, difference between social and non-human being. Only the former exhibits a real and an ideal moment, as it is founded both on the objective activity through which man inscribes himself in nature, in the causal structure of the world, and on the reflective cognition of reality and teleological positings. The two moments mutually determine one another, but in a structural and functional manner, not genetically. Changes in the real moment do not bring about the ideal moment or any of its constituents; they can only cause the transformation of their properties, as, for example, by augmenting the veracity of cognitive reflections, increasingly freeing reflection from anthropomorphic accretions, inducing contentfully novel teleological positings, augmenting the effectiveness of practical activities, etc. The transformation of the real moment cannot of itself bring it about that active human consciousness begins or ceases to reflect reality. Nor can it cause the consciousness accompanying practical activity to acquire or lose the character of "teleological intention." The relation holding between the two constituents of the ideal moment has an analogous nature. Should knowledge of causal connections turn out to be false, then a teleological positing based on it ceases to be a positing in the ontological sense and remains a positing only in the epistemological sense. It loses its function of an "intention steering" objective activity and becomes instead an act of consciousness "powerless in the face of nature" (II, 24?5). It is hardly surprising that, for Luk?cs, in the context of genetic considerations, the qualitative leap from nature to social being remains opaque to cognition. Luk?cs is no doubt correct when he affirms that no analysis of biological evolution will provide the explanation of that in man which surpasses nature, just as he is certainly right to see the source of this human specificity in non-epiphenomenal consciousness.</page><page sequence="10">10 BARBARA TUCHANSKA However, despite these convictions Luk?cs also maintains more con troversially that consciousness is a "causal-teleological consciousness." As a result it becomes impossible to appeal to the concept of human self-creation to explain what is not merely natural in man, that is to acknowledge that causal-teleological consciousness is itself the product of historical development. No doubt this is due to the transposition of the structural-functional consideration of social being to the genetic order of consideration. For should it be assumed from the start, as Luk?cs in fact does, that activity is human only to the extent that it is teleological and grounded in causal knowledge, then of course it cannot be shown that the causal and teleological conceptions of the world arise out of human activity and are not genetically primordial aspects of the ideal moment. In Luk?cs' view, it is not man who creates these aspects, rather they come together to constitute man out of a biological creature, whereas man's constitutive activity is only able to unfold and perfect them. As a result Luk?cs can state his views about the creation of the ideal moment in the context of human activity ? views which are de facto present in the Ontology ... ? only if he acknowledges that they are inconsistent, or if he accepts the consequences arising out of his separation of structural and genetic considerations. In short, the epistemological content of the category of the ideal moment is taken for granted at the starting point of Luk?cs' ontology of social being. The fact that Luk?cs need not expressly affirm in his ontology that social being contains this ideal moment at its inception is due to the assumptions about the primacy of non-organic and organic nature, the separation of structural and genetic considerations, and deliberate silence about the occurrence of the qualitative leap. In other words, Luk?cs engages a procedure, the validity of which is hardly self evident, wherein considerations about the ontic structure of social being are separated from genetic and developmental considerations. In so doing, Luk?cs can affirm that reflection and teleological positing are the essential determinants of social being without having to acknowledge that they are the sole and genetically primary forms of the activity of consciousness and its products. Luk?cs thereby returns to a version of the position which he had attacked in Geschichte und Klassenbewusstsein. Even if the reflective function of consciousness is conceived as a possibility that is realized</page><page sequence="11">MARXISM AND SCIENCE 11 gradually in history, often with difficulty, sometimes in the form of anthropomorphism, it is nevertheless prescribed to history and, in the structural order, precedes society and history. In Geschichte . . . Luk?cs turned critically against this kind of idea. Not only did he reject the idea of reflection according to which knowledge corresponds to empirically given reality, but he also opposed the version according to which knowledge corresponds to a hidden, only phenomenally manifest, essential reality. Both versions of the concept of reflection presuppose that becoming is a process in which the true nature of the unfolding object is gradually realized, and therefore that there is a reality, be it even a possibility-for-realization. Dialectics, on the contrary, requires that becoming be conceived as the mediation between the concrete, already existent historical past and the concrete historical future which contains ? to put it in Hegelian terms ? the truth of what is becoming. Reality is not only rendered empirically real in this mediation; reality creates itself, such that consciousness is not external in relation to this becoming, but takes part in it and co-creates the future.4 In order to bring together the structural and genetic considerations Luk?cs relies on the Aristotelian category of dynamis. By appealing to this concept, every human act is, for Luk?cs, a possible teleological act; the teleological act is the proto-structure of the act of labor, just as labor is the proto-structure of social practice and comprises ? as possibility ? all of social being (II, 83?5). "Together with the act of teleological positing," Luk?cs writes, "labor already contains social being in itself" (II, 432). As Stefan Morawski rightly observes, to the extent that in Geschichte . . . "Marxist philosophy is derived from the revolution perpetrated by Kant, from his critical epistemology which undermines the sense of the Aristotelian formula adequatio rei et intellectus and requires engaging in subjective-objective ontology", in the Ontology . . . "Luk?cs returned to the Aristotelian tradition, regard ing critical epistemology as Kant's error."5 It may be that the appeal to the Aristotelian category of dynamis enables the reconciliation of structural considerations and genetic description in that it prompts the affirmation that the essential qualifying moment of social being, viz., teleological positing, is a part of man's every historical action, be it even in the form of a still to be realized possibility. This procedure has certain consequences. On one hand, the process</page><page sequence="12">12 BARBARA TUCHANSKA of the genesis and development of social being has to be conceived as the realization of a preformed possibility inscribed within the initial form of social being. But, on the other hand, in as much as labor, as the proto-structure of human, creative activity, is grounded in the cognitive disclosure of reality, then holding to the idea of the self-creativity of social being and the (co)-creative character of human practice becomes impossible. Here again Morawski is right in noting that, just because acts of consciousness are never adequate, either singularly or in their totality, this does not yet suffice to constitute human creativity and freedom. "[Inadequacy hardly implies a creative attitude."6 Nevertheless, Luk?cs wanted to hold on to the idea of the self creation of social being, of being as a process "which maintains or reproduces itself" (II, 1025). It is supposed to enable distinguishing reified cognitive complexes, in which the object presents itself as created by forces from without its essence, from processual complexes, such as Marxism, in which the object is "a momentary traditional product in the on-going process of its own reproduction" (II, 1026). However, as Morawski stresses, because Luk?cs takes the material world for granted, he can no longer "retain the earlier activistic, theore tico-practical view, grounded in the proletariat's self-knowledge."7 Another result of assuming the ontological primacy of nature is both that the object of knowledge cannot be conceived as the real object created (cognitively) by man, but merely as a "congealed" reflection of the real object, and that neither the subject nor knowledge can be conceived as in themselves results of human creativity. In other words, on the basis of Luk?cs' ontological assumptions cognition is not a phenomenon brought to view in the course of investigating social being. Because he is working with a determinate concept of knowledge as reflection of reality, Luk?cs, in setting out to analyze human practice, is unable to raise the question required by the construction of an ontology of social being. How is it that there presently exists just this type of activity which is the reflection of actually encountered reality? In different terms, what mechanism of social being turns a particular form of activity involving human consciousness into cognition, cognitive appropriation of reality? Cognition rendered problematic in this way becomes a phenomenon "within" social being and has to be conceived in terms of categories describing social being. It is no longer something</page><page sequence="13">MARXISM AND SCIENCE 13 the concept of which is prior to the conceptual constitution of social being. I want to turn now to the question whether an alternative conception of cognition as a social phenomenon is possible, that is a conception brought forth out of ? not conceived prior to ? an investigation of social being. 3. COGNITION IN SOCIAL BEING It is appropriate to start the search by recalling that Althusser formu lated a version of the question raised in the preceding paragraph. Althusser's point of departure is the assumption about the produc tive structure of social activity which, independently of its content, always constitutes its object from the raw material at hand with the help of existing means of production. However, both the raw material and the means of production are the results of earlier processes of produc tion. From this point of view, cognition is a particular form of produc tion, the raw material of which is the object of cognition, the given cognitive matter, whereas the product is the transformed object and the cognition contained in it. On the basis of these assumptions, Althusser raises the question, "what is the mechanism that helps the process of cognition, occurring wholly in thought, to constitute the cognitive appropriation of its real object, existing beyond thought in the real world?"8 In raising this question, Althusser distinguishes it from the question about the history of cognition, concerning the mechanism of the production of cognition, and regards it as a strictly philosophical question, since it is universal and ahistorical, that is relevant to every historical cognition, regardless of the historical variation of the mecha nism producing cognition. As to whether this essentially structuralist distinction should be accepted, and whether Althusser's affirmations are fully consistent (for example, does his conception of the production process not entail teleology and causal knowledge of the world?), and finally whether his answer to the question addressed to Marxist epistemology is persuasive ? these are all matters going beyond the limits of this article. However, Althusser's point of view does appear to me to be important. From this point of view, it is possible to perceive a certain general</page><page sequence="14">14 BARBARA TUCHANSKA problem that is unwittingly resolved in Kmita and Nowak's conceptions. It is a general problem, because it bears on philosophizing as such: it has to do with the validity of transposing concepts developed in the context of one conceptual framework to another framework in which certain new contents are only added to those which were established within the first framework. To be sure, the rules of philosophizing are not established with as much precision as the logical rules of proof, and there is no way of determining whether such a procedure is valid or not. For instance, from the perspective of a holistic position such as Ajdukiewicz's radical conventionalism and his notion of closed lan guages, this procedure would be invalid. For, according to this point of view, the context of the whole in which a given concept is situated determines its entire content, such that a change of context entails a change in the entire content of the concept transposed from one frame work to another. A change entails, in other words, the construction of a new concept. Althusser's question makes it possible to see that, in the form of Marxist philosophizing found in Luk?cs as well as in Kmita and Nowak, the conviction (evident only on the basis of certain ontological assump tions) that cognition is a subjective-objective relation, and that its product is the subjective reflection of actually encountered reality, is retained after transposing the concept of cognition into the conceptual framework of the ontology of social being. As a result it is no longer possible to envisage the possibility that perhaps this relation and the reflective function of consciousness arise out of man's creative activity. In other words, transposing the concept of cognition makes it possible to scrutinize the epistemological conviction that cognition is a relation between subject and object, and conceals how little evidence there is to support it. Moreover, it becomes impossible to display the problematic nature of the very transposition of the epistemological concept of cognition and the notion of science founded on it into the framework of historical materialism. Yet a further consequence is the aforementioned impossibility of taking Marxist investigations into the determinants of science beyond epistemological and methodological conceptions and thus blocking the path to new answers to question in the philosophy of science. The only way to break out of this circle is to give up the idea of the</page><page sequence="15">MARXISM AND SCIENCE 15 primacy of epistemological convictions and conceive cognition not in epistemological, but in social, categories. For example, following Althusser's lead, cognition may be conceived as a productive process, with the caveat, however, that in order to avoid a vicious circle it is not to be understood as teleological activity based on causal knowledge of the world. Or else, as I would like to suggest, cognition should be conceived as a self-developing system of social interaction. Only such a non-epistemological approach leads to a conception of cognition as a social phenomenon and avoids the aforementioned categorial incon sistency between structural and functional descriptions of science. In my search for a concept of science that could be smoothly incorporated into an ontology of social being, I begin with some ontological concepts borrowed from post-Kantian German philosophy.9 They include the Hegelian idea of historicity as a (substantial) mode of existence of the subjective-objective totality; the Marxian conception of the social nature of this totality; Nietzsche's belief that, as this totality is a process of creation, it is fundamentally and inevitably permeated with different values; Husserl's conception of transcendental consciousness or inter subjectivity as a basis for the self-constitution of the subjective-objective empirical whole; and Heidegger's concept of Dasein, i.e., the self conscious and self-projecting existential subject. These categories deter mine a specific conceptual field in which being appears as basically dynamic and social. It is a process of social, historical self-creation, and its objectivizations are substantial human subjectivities and other concrete realities. Cognition is an indispensable element of the entire process being itself a process of self-creation. Cognition creates itself as cognition; it is a historical activity which attributes to itself the property of being cognition. This does not mean, however, that cognition creates itself through different epistemological theories. Different epistemolo gies are only expressions of the process itself, whereas the process of self-creation of cognition takes place in the course of the various cognitive acts of scientists, philosophers, and ordinary people in their everyday lives. However, these acts are not relations between the subject and objects of cognition. From an ontological, structural point of view, these acts are interactions between human beings, because being is social in its ontic structure. To phrase the point differently, cognition is a dialogue in the literal sense of the word. Conceived in this</page><page sequence="16">16 BARBARA TUCHANSKA way cognition is substantially a social phenomenon (as a single act) and a historical process (as a whole) governed by different social mecha nisms. (A detailed description of these mechanisms is beyond the scope of this paper.) We can say roughly that the inner dynamic of cognition is its capacity to overcome itself, to transcend every stage of knowledge so far attained. This self-transcending process is not a purely rational process of criticism leading towards truth. It is a spontaneous activity taking place in different social contexts, in different systems of com munication and transmission of ideas. For instance, in the case of science the context is composed of organized scientific communities, technical scientific equipment, established research procedures, epis temological values, and so forth. On the basis of this conception of cognition, neither objective validity, teleological thinking, nor the causal approach to reality are attributed a priori to human cognition. They are instead the results of the self-development of cognition. Moreover, the idea that cognition refers to reality, that it is treated realistically as a relation between a subject and an object, can be explained only if cognition is considered in the overall context of social self-creation. Only the fact that social activity does not reduce to cognition makes cognition a relation between subjects (participants of cognitive interactions) and their objects. In other words, what is objective for cognition is correlative to the overall context of social practice. An object of a given act of cognition is created ? as the object of the cognition ? by historical social activity. Without this practical activity cognitive interactions would have been closed in themselves, their participants would have recognized only each other, and no objects would have been visible to them. That cognition does sometimes operate this way, is sometimes closed to external reality, can be demonstrated with the help of the history of philosophy and science. Such an approach to cognition seems to hold out the promise of greater benefits than the approach elaborated by Luk?cs in his Ontology of Social Being. For one thing, it is free of inconsistency between considerations of the ontic structure of (social) being and considerations of its genesis. Nor does it involve the dubious idea that human consciousness passively mirrors objective reality. Ultimately, I hope that it throws new light on at least some problems in the philoso phy of science.</page><page sequence="17">MARXISM AND SCIENCE 17 NOTES 1 As for other controversial issues in the philosophy of science it is worth mentioning two other problems, viz., the problem of the structure of scientific theories as well as the problem of the relation between theory and the empirical basis. Both of these were of central importance within logical empiricism, but neither the logical-linguistic solution nor the competing extra-linguistic solutions gained widespread acceptance. Today they have entered the province of what may be called the logic of science. 2 L. Nowak, "Essence ? Idealization ? Praxis.
