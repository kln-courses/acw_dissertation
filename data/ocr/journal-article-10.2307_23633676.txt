À la même époque, Cudworth rédigea une étude critique des fon dements de l'hylozoïsme de Glisson dans laquelle il considérait explicitement son traité sur la nature énergétique de la substance comme un livre traitant de la vie de la matière. Défendant des points de vue opposés, ils contribuèrent tous deux, au milieu du XVIIe siècle, à une reformulation de l'étendue et des limites du naturalisme. Ils essayèrent l'un et l'autre de raviver une vieille tradition de corpuscularisme vital. Cudworth en élaborant une forme de pythagorisme spirituel en opposition avec le matérialisme de Hobbes, Glisson en combinant plusieurs courants d'une ligne de pensée généralement vitaliste. Dans les années mêmes où le modèle corpusculaire se développait complètement suivant les critères matérialistes et mécanistes qui devaient l'établir définitivement comme la science des modernes, Glisson et Cud worth, chacun à leur manière, démontraient qu'on pouvait concilier l'atomisme avec une vision de la nature hylozoïste et même spiritualiste.

KEYWORDS. — Corpuscularianism ; hylozoism ; perception ; mat ter ; life. I. — Hylozoism and corpuscularianism The term « hylozoism », which is more appropriate than vita lism when speaking of Francis Glisson's natural philosophy, was coined by Ralph Cudworth in his True Intellectual System of the Urtiverse. In Cudworth's opinion hylozoism refers to that kind of atheism which reduces substance to a living and perceptive material substratum. What makes « hylozoism » an untenable hypothesis in Cudworth's eyes is the fact that matter, the only existing substance, becomes a « commonwealth of percipients ». The unnamed target of Cudworth's criticism is Francis Glisson, who in the treatise on atheism appears as Strato of Lampsacus (1). The True Intellectual System of the Universe was published in 1678. At that time, in the wake of Descartes, the incongruities of the so-called « vitalistic » philosophies were exposed from many quarters, theology fírst and foremost. We can borrow from Cud (1) See Arrigo Pacchi, Cartesio in Inghilterra : Da More a Boy le (Rome-Bari : Laterza, 1973), 152, and John Henry, Medicine and pneumatology : H. Enry More, Richard Baxter and Francis Glisson's treatise on the energetic nature of substance, Medical History, XXXI (1987), 15-40.

From this point of view seventeenth-century hylozoism can be said to be the heir of the Renaissance forms of pansensism, along with several elements drawn from the medical tradition. This is the reason why Tom maso Campanella and Jan Baptiste van Helmont play such an important part in Glisson's philosophy of nature. Glisson shares with Helmont a sort of energetic corpuscularia nism, namely matter as self-supporting energy, energy as uncons cious perceptive activity, activity as the resuit of infinite centers of power - semina rerum in van Helmont and biousiai in Glisson (3). This view is well summed up by van Helmont's theory of the « necessity of semina ». Energetic corpuscularianism is based on teleological necessity, according to which each semen develop towards its own end - an end, nevertheless, unknown to the semina themselves : « Whatsoever is made or generated in Nature, is made or generated from a necessity of the seeds, and [...] seeds are in this respect, the original principies, and natural causes of things, and do act for ends, not indeed known to themselves, but unto God alone (4). » Helmont's doctrine of the necessity of semina originates from the interprétation of some key passages in Hippocrates's De diœta and a famous locus in Saint-John's gospel (3, 8) (5). The percep (2) See Giglioni, op. cit., in η. 1 (1995), 26-27.

A similar view is held by Glisson when he states that the shift from prime matter to « shaped » matter involves necessarily a détermination of the initial indifférence in matter (Glisson, op. cit. in n. 3). (5) See Hippocrates, Œuvres complètes, Emile Littré (ed.) (Paris, 1839-1861), VI, 477 478 ; Io, 3, 8 : « Spiritus ubi vult spirat et vocem eius audis sed non scis unde veniat et quo vadat. »</page><page sequence="4">242 Guido Giglioni tive, energetic nature of substance is unconscious : this can mean either that nature as a teleological arrangement of the world was established by God's will at the very beginning of création and for this reason the semina « go without knowing where » ; or that being is perceptive in itself and there is a sort of development from the primordial végétative root of nature up to the sensitive and intellective degrees of perception via progressively more com plex units (6). Ralph Cudworth shows very well why vital corpuscularianism is the almost inevitable outcome of hylozoism and why it implies a godless nature. He explains that the « ...hylozoic corporealist, supposing ail matter, as such, to have life in it, must needs make infinite of those lives (forasmuch as every atom of mat ter has a life of its own) coordínate and independent on one another, and consequently, as many independent first principies, no one common life or mind ruling o ver the whole (7). » The fact that matter is intrinsically endowed with life means that all matter is made up of infinite atoms endowed with infinite per ceptions. In this way it rules out any possibility for the formation of a common vital principie, capable of coordinating and presiding over all the centers of life. « For, whereas the atomic atheism supposes the notion or idea of body to be nothing but extended resisting bulk, and consequently to include no manner of life and cogitation in it ; hylozoism, on the con trary, makes all body, as such, and therefore every smallest atom of it, to have life essentially belonging to it (natural perception, and appetite), though without any animal sense or reflexive knowledge, as if life, and matter or extended bulk, were but two incomplète and inadéquate concep tions of one and the same substance, called body (8). » The reference to Glisson's energetic corpuscularianism, even allowing for a few distortions, is apparent : « every smallest atom », being substance and therefore capable of manifesting itself (6) Olivier Bloch sees the use of the teleological « necessity of semina » by Gassendi as an attempt to reconcile naturalism and creationism, mechanism and finalism, so as to give to the theory of the molécula seminales an animistic sense « qui fait de ces conglomérats d'atomes des porteurs d'information divine, d'ordre quasi psychologique. » (La Philosophie de Gassendi (La Hague : Nijhoff, 1971), 455).

(8) Ibid., I, 144.</page><page sequence="5">Francis Glissons notion of confœderatio naturae 243 as both matter and life, is intrinsically endowed with natural per ception and appetite. In Cudworth's rigorous criticism, the « neces sity of semina » has become the metaphysical justification for an evolutionary concept of living matter : « By reason of which life (not animal, but only plastical) ail parts of matter being supposed able to form themselves artificially and methodi cally (though without any délibération or attentive considération) to the greatest advantage of their présent respective capabilities, and therefore also sometimes by organization to improve themselves further into sense and self-enjoyment in ail animais, as also to universal reason and reflexive knowledge in men ; it is plain, that there is no necessity at ail left, either of any incorporeal soul in men to make them rational, or of any Deity in the whole universe to solve the regularity thereof (9). » According to the hylozoistic hypothesis, the « regularity » of the whole universe is due merely to the plastic activity of matter. This manifests itself in a tendency to self-organization which is peculiar to the living corpuscles of matter. Glisson published his system on the life of nature in 1672 ; in the same period, Cudworth wrote a critical examination of the foundations of Glisson's hylozoism considering in a straightfor ward manner the treatise on the energetic nature of substance as a book dealing with the life of matter (10). Taking opposing stand points, they both contributed in the middle of the seventeenth cen tury to a restatement of the extent and the limits of naturalism. They both tried to revive an old tradition of vital corpuscularia nism, Cudworth by working out a form of spiritual Pythagorea nism in opposition to Hobbes's materialism, Glisson by combining several strands of a generally vitalistic line of thought. In the very years when the corpuscularian model was fully developed accor ding to those mechanistic and materialistic canons which were to establish it definitively as the science of the modems, Glisson and (9) Cudworth, op. cit. in n. 7, I, 144. (10) Cudworth's True lntellectual System, published in 1678, was nevertheless already completed in 1671, one year before the publication of Glisson's De natura substantiœ energé tica. Given the numerous references (cryptic, but in one case, at least, explicit (see Giglioni, op. cit. in η. 1 (1996) : Anatomist atheist?..., 129) to the philosophical work of Glisson, the apparent anachronism can be explained in three ways : either Cudworth took advantage of the fact that the licence was not given to his book on atheism so that he could add his criti cal remarks on Glisson's hylozoism ; or the True lntellectual System had not been completed at ail and the parts about hylozoism and its absurd kind of atomism were added as the threat represented by Stratonic atheism took shape ; or Cudworth had seen Glisson's book in manuscript form before its publication in 1672.</page><page sequence="6">244 Guido Giglioni Cudworth, in their différent ways, demonstrated that atomism could be reconciled with a hylozoistic or even spiritualistic vision of nature (11). II. — Glisson s corpuscularianism It is a spécifie characteristic of the medical tradition that, from the beginning, it regarded the living body as the result of the active interplay of opposing powers. Already Alcmeon of Croton had ascribed health to a condition of equality among the différent parts of the organism and disease to a condition of inequality among them. More broadly, the ancient philosophy interpreted natural changes in terms of mutual transformations among the basic élé ments of matter. One element passes into the other ; the victory of one corpuscle is the defeat of another (12). This mostly medical tradition is to be taken into account when dealing with the deve lopment of those corpuscularian théories of matter that emphasize the role of active qualities. Glisson devotes the final chapter of his De natura substantice energética to the examination of the notion of minimum natu rale (13). Mínima naturalia represent the smallest quantity of mat ter that can be still actuated by a form. They are not atoms, but mínima continua, that is, the least quantity of energy that is compa tible with the other « confédérations » of mínima. When this microscopic energetic balance is altered, the dividing principie (11) See Tullio Gregory's warning «a non considerare ogni restaurazione dell'antico atomismo come semplicemente meccanicistica e tale quindi da eliminare spiegazioni finalis tiche, vitalistiche e anche metafisiche. » (Studi suH'atomismo del Seicento. I. Sebastiano Bas son, Giornale critico délia filosofía italiana, XVII (1964), 44, 57).

Glisson's minima naturalia are clots of energy which follow the action of the forces that are inherent in prime matter. To understand the ontological status of Glisson's minima we have to examine briefly his notion of substance. Glisson's theory of substance can be seen as a monistic view as regards the general nature of substance, and as a pluralistic view as regards the number of existing substances. In a sense this distinction draws on Aris totle's distinction between secondary and primary substances (14). The picture is further complicated by the fact that Glisson distin guishes différent species of substances : spiritual substances (angels, démons and rational soûls) and material substances (prime mat ter) (15). They are ail simple, so we can conclude that in the sublu nar world there are a great many individual substances displaying a common living and perceptive nature. As far as the general nature of substance is concerned, Glisson regards the « substantial nature » as an undifferentiated entity that can appear to our intellect as either being (subsistentia fundamentalis) or energy (natura energética). The entity of substance can be said to be undifferentiated because the general déterminations of substance (being and energy, subsis tentia and natura) derive from the same root of being (16). Individual substance (suppositum) originates from the contrac tion of its essential nature. Glisson attributes the cause of this movement that is internai to substance to a process of « natural confédération » (confœderatio naturœ) : «... the self-confederation of nature (naturœ confœderatio sibi soli) implies not only the négation of the union with any other thing outside itself, but also that it becomes complete by virtue of this self confederation. This completion is a positive form and it is the sufïïcient foundation of the négation of the union with anything else. In fact, for the very reason that it confederates with itself, it communicates with itself, as is self-evident. Therefore, ail that remains is to explain the way self (14) Glisson, op. cit. in n. 3, 46. See also Giglioni, op. cit. in n. 3 (1996) : Anatomist atheist?..., 119-121. (15) Glisson, op. cit. in n. 3, 11, 18-19, 188, 190; Ad lectorem, 7-8. (16) [bid., 77, 187-188. British Library, ms. Sloane 3311, fol. 90 r° : « Quare basis máte nse et formse una atque eadem natura substantialis est quanquam sub diverso formali conceptu. »</page><page sequence="8">246 Guido Giglioni confederated nature becomes complete. In my opinion, something is com plete when no part of it is lacking. Thus, since the whole of that nature which is divided from all the rest is united and confederated only with itself, it cannot lack any part due to it, as nothing which has not pre viously confederated with itself is required to complete nature. Nature is satisfied with itself if no confederated parts are lacking : it derives gratifi cation from the determínate entity it has obtained, and does not seek any thing outside that (17). » Viewed in this way, the individuation of substance is a kind of centripetal motion. A process of contraction stems from the subs tantial nature, such that it exeludes all that is not immanent to subs tance. The individuum is a substance which has become thoroughly immanent, by turning within itself and internalizing any link with the outside. This is the end (which is also the terminus) where the movement of substance finds full satisfaction : « The end of supposi talitas is the enjoyment of its own substantial nature as a complete individual substance (18). » Therefore, the individuum is also a substance which is thoroughly complete in itself and which lacks nothing. The « self-confederation of nature » represente the consti tutive process of substance. It is not a result ; it is the act through which substance is formed, and this act is necessarily a vital act. The confédération does not represent an extrinsic action which coming from the outside separates the individual substance (suppositum) from the others placing it in an absolute isolation ; rather, it is a movement which is internai to it, which attracts what is similar and expels what is dissimilar. (It is worth remembering that Glisson's theory of substance has close links with his theory of digestion and metabolism.) At first sight, the individuum could well appear to be the result of an extrinsic « confédération » ; but in fact the « pact » (fœdus) took place at the time when substance started being formed and was not imposed from the outside. Therefore, the « confédéra tion » does not find substance already constituted. On the contrary, it constitutes substance in its own being. Confédération is the « act of the substantial nature which unités exclusively with itself ». Natu ral confédération is the same as « self-confederation ». The act of « self-confederation » represents the very structural cause of substance (e natura substantiali dimanans) and the « constitutive form of the individuum (suppositum) ». Unlike the (17) Glisson, op. cit. in n. 3, 54. (18) Ibid., 50.</page><page sequence="9">Francis Glisson's notion of confœderatio natura 247 extrinsic action of confédération, which « arranges and links things utterly divided through a certain bond of mutual neces sity », the intrinsic act of confédération « associâtes things which are intimately joined through a union per se or intrinsic associa tion ». The former is external to the substances which it gathers and it belongs to those Systems where the parts are held together to obtain the greatest advantage with the least damage, as is the case with the organization of families, towns, states and so on. The latter is the way « natures which are différent to the greatest extent coalesce to form a unum per se (19) ». This act, which blocks natures to the point of making them incommunicable indi vidua, comes from an « ideal principie », due to which substance represents itself as a being divided from ail the others (20). Accor dingly, the act which originates the substantial confédération is a law, an « idea » : « The act or mode of confédération includes the idea or character of the individuum », which régulâtes the deve lopment according to the law that « ... everything that is assumed into the individual bond (in societatem individualem), is first subdued and subjected, that is, it is transformed into the nature and disposition of the subjecting principie. Thus it takes up the idea of the subduing being with which it then unîtes and almost identifies. And this is due to that very law according to which everything that is rejected from this confédération takes off the previous idea and, at the moment of rejection, it puts on another idea (21). » Identity is achieved by identifying itself with what is similar to itself and by distinguishing itself from what is dissimilar ; however, the identification of what is same and what is other involves an act of récognition, « ...an idea of the thing which is originated from that act. It is in vain that nature is said to confedérate if it does not know what it is that into which it confederates [...] Confédération is an act of life, and consequently it per ceives itself and the effect it produces. In fact, the perceptive act présup posés the représentative content of the idea (22). » Glisson's suppositalitas - that is, the defining characteristic of individuation - does not dépend on matter's dispositions, which (19) Glisson, op. cit. in n. 3, 56-57 : « Natura plurimum diversa coeunt in unum per se ». (20) Ibid., 66 : « Se satis ab omnibus aliis divisum représentât, nulli extra se communi catur, sibique soli unitur, necnon sibi soli sufficit ». (21) Ibid., 69. (22) Ibid., 68.</page><page sequence="10">248 Guido Giglioni are extrinsic with respect to the essence of substance, but it is a positive, vital and therefore perceptive act. It is an ideal and exem plary character which, nevertheless, is implemented by knowledge in actu through the development of the individuum. « This indivi dual idea lasts from the beginning to the end of the duration of the individuum » and « represente » the présent and future ratio of the suppositum (23). Behind the concept of individuum as a resuit of a self confederative act there is the idea of substance as a self representative structure. On several occasions Glisson declares that this structure pertains to the being of substance : «... the very entity of substance, inasmuch as it is intimately présent in its own faculty, is a sufficient idea or objective ratio through which it knows itself and its causes and effects ; in addition, it acquires the ideas of other objects caused or impressed from the outside through action, pas sion and movement (24). » Substance as a self-representative structure gives us further élé ments to understand what can be the ultímate cause of the confede rating of being into individua. The core of substance is the idea of itself (idea suiipsius), that is, the possibility for the being of subs tance to be represented to itself (queslibet entitas in subjecto est sua objectiva ratio, quatenus intime pressens suœ facultati percep tives) (25). In this respect the law of self-preservation is imprinted within substance : substance perceives itself, loves itself, and its activity turns into a striving (nisus) to maintain this balance and to keep it in a definite form. There is complete transparency between the being of substance and its objective ratio (id est the représenta tive content) : this is the foundation due to which perceptive acti vity can be said to be the very energetic nature of substance. And this is also the foundation of the radical immanence of the self productive activity of substance : its causality, which is the same thing as its potency, is not distinguished from its own being, and, since this is self-representative, self-productiveness is a kind of acti vity which is not indiffèrent to any form. The détermination of form is imprinted within the « ideal » structure of substance. The (23) Glisson, op. cit. in n. 3, 73. (24) Ibid., 194. (25) Ibid., 168.</page><page sequence="11">Francis Glisson's notion of confœderatio naturae 249 substantial nature (which, in the sublunar world, is prime matter and primeval life at the same time, although these two attributes cannot be grasped simultaneously by our intellect) is not a blind potency and, above ail, it does not require intervention from the outside. The détermination of the potency of matter, as simple substance, is imprinted in its own entity and this is not extraneous to it. This détermination occurs autonomously precisely because the being of substance is self-representative. Self-productiveness of matter is based on its self-representativeness. The idea precedes the form, in the sense that the form is delineated within the being of matter and is produced once the power of matter reaches maturity, that is, once the whole of the ideal dispositions comes to be a représentation and the content of the idea is converted into natural perceptive energy (26). Glisson's theory of individual substance, as we have defined it up to now, leaves some questions unanswered. Individual substance seems to be a « confederacy » of substantial principies joined into a binding mutuality ; but, although the substantial confederacy is intrinsically connected, it still seems to be an assemblage of natu res, rather than an individual nature, and the difficulty arises again for each single substantial principie within the confédération. Admittedly, the confederative act is not external and does not occur once substance is formed, that is to say, from the outside, but it is the very internai forming of substance - a primeval bond which originates this substantial growth. Nevertheless, it remains to specify better a notion of identity that is the resuit of a multiplicity of individuáis. Furthermore, even provided that individual substance is to be understood as the fulfilment of a process that has its own basis in the essential nature of substance and that is intrinsically cohesive and contractive, nevertheless, individual substance, taken as a pro (26) Glisson, op. cit. in n. 3, 158 : « Non autem determinan debet addita aliqua natura complente (sic enim incapax esset alterius forma,) sed objective et idealiter, seu reprasentando ei pulchritudinem et congruentiam forma educenda. Hac determinatio non proprie concipienda est ut res interveniens inter materiam et formam ; sed ut res requisita ex parte materia prius quam cum forma naturaliter conjungi queat. Oportet enim materia in ratione causa materialis sit completa, antequam formam educere potest. Cum ergo requiratur idea forma in materia ad ejus causalitatem materialem complendam seu determinandam, necesse est idea ista formam ipsam saltem ordine natura, si non temporis, antevertat. » On the immanent character of the représentative activity in matter see Francis Glisson, De ventrículo et intestinis (Amsterdam : Apud Jacobum Juniorem, 1677), 365-368.</page><page sequence="12">250 Guido Giglioni cess toward identity, in that it présupposés the récognition of what is similar and dissimilar and the représentation of what is other, founds the individuation upon a process of perceptive identification and thus easily gives cause for charging Glisson's theory of subs tance with anthropomorphism. As a conséquence, we have further to analyse the nexus between life and perception (the real founding core of Glisson's concept of suppositalitas) and the idea of indivi dual substance as a confederacy of substantial perceptive principies - once again, the commonwealth of percipients ridiculed by Cud worth. III. — Mínima naturalia as mínima of perceptive energy In Glisson's scheme a corpuscle is said to be a minimum natu relle not in an absolute way, but in relation to the limits of the divi ding principie and to the state (sepárate or united) in which corpus cles find themselves. « The minimum naturale in its sepárate state is an indivisible corpuscle and an atom. In its joint state, however, in spite of sometimes being called minimum (since when it is considered separately it is as small as a real separated minimum), it is not completely indivisibile, nor in this sense is it an atom. In fact, the mínima (in the sense that they would be mínima if they were sepárate), when united within a continuum, are not really mínima, but particles of the same smallness as those we could correctly term as mínima, if they were apart from each other. They grow due to the entry of the parts with which they merge into a continuum and with which they communicate ; and therefore due to this augmentation they can be divided in any point (27). » Unlike the traditional définition of the atom, mínima naturalia are living units which need the rest of the corpuscles to unité with (or reunite with, when they have been separated). In their divided state, they are indivisible (or, better, they cannot be divided fur ther) in the same sense as atoms ; unlike impenetrable and indivi (27) Glisson, op. cit. in n. 3, 484 : « Hinc constat, mínima naturalia in unum continuum unita, si postmodum nova divisione concidantur, non necessario in eadem prœcise mínima in qua prius resolví. » Ibid., 486: «In continuo enim non sunt mínima, sed partibus vicinis aucta ; adeoque in quolibet sut puncto assignabili divisibilia. »</page><page sequence="13">Francis Glisson's notion of confœderatio naturae 251 sible atoms, they merge to form broader units, since they can split and come together again in différent combinations from the prece ding confédération. Thus it is correct to say that « in the conti nuum there are no mínima, but particles which are grown due to the parts that are near them ». We already know that the act of confédération, which is at the base of the individuation of natural things, is not extrinsic, due to a délimitation from the outside, but it is the effect of a movement which is essential to the nature of substance (that is simultaneously materia prima and vita primœva) and which corresponds to the attribute of continuity ( « Continuity is a positive entity distinct from quantity ex natura rei (28) » ). Talking of the principie of individuation, Glisson has already distinguished between external and internai kinds of bonds. Here he distinguishes the extrinsic nexus of bodies (corpora integra), determined by external means (like glue or cernent) and the intrinsic nexus (particules ejusdem totius). The « particles of the same whole » unité immediately and in themselves, and « they communicate with each other and with the whole », and therefore they « strive to adhéré to each other due to a certain intrinsic propensity (29) ». This « propensity » of the corpuscles is based on the attribute of continuity : « The particles, by perceiving the utility through which they enjoy their communion amongst themselves, love and desire this communion, and consequently they strive to maintain it, that is, they strive to adhéré to each other in such a way that internai cohésion itself is nothing other than a movement or striving resulting from continuity, through which nature strives to conserve itself. Therefore, by means of natural perception and appetite, the cohésion is firstly based on continuity (30). » Continuity of matter (continuitas materiœ), as an expression of the confederative and perceptive activity of the substantial nature, cau ses the union (communie) of the parts with the whole and is the efficient principie of individual substance, that is, the intrinsic force through which each single vital suppositum persists in its own being and resists any attempt by a more powerful force to break it up. But the force which we are talking about is in its ultímate essence a (28) Glisson, op. cit. in n. 3, 443 : « Continuitas est entitas positiva ex natura rei a quan titate distincta » ; ibid., 524-525 : « Continuitas est de se forma positiva, et formalem effectum positivum dat ; nempe communionem partium continuarum.» (29) Ibid., 525.

We have provisionally characterized living substance as a confe deracy of living principies. Το the extent that it is the resuit of a tendency to self-delimitation intrinsic to matter, it is one and indi vidual ; to the extent that it is divisible into parts, it is manifold, albeit compact and cohesive. As we have seen, Glisson takes up the scholastic doctrine of mínima naturalia : matter is divisible into parts, potentially to infinity, but in act only up to units - the mínima naturalia - that cannot be further divided : «... inasmuch as they are apart from the rest, they are and can be said to be in act indivisible and atoms (and in this respect I do not deny the exis tence of atoms). But in fact they are corpuscles and have their own perime ter and center ; and they are not said to be indivisible due to a lack of quantity, but because they shudder and flee from further division (31). » What thus at fïrst seemed to us to be a conventional reason {mínima naturalia are the ultímate material costituents because of the incapacity of the divisor to continue with the division) is in effect a détermination which is internai to the very essence of the minimum naturale (natural perception and, then, natural appetite). The smallest corpuscles resulting from a division could not be the same in a différent division of the same compound : this is because the mínima naturalia are not atoms, that is, discrète entities which are definite once and for ail, nor are they particles which are obtai ned by dividing a compound into its possible smallest terms from the outside. Rather, they are so to speak temporary clots of vital energy, which shun further divisions since they perceive this as a danger for their identity. The perceptive (and then appetitive and motive) activity is the real foundation of mínima naturalia and of their movement to form confédérations within the continuity of being. Being enclosed in a vital bond, «... each part grows and enjoys the part which is near itself as if it were its own : here again we see nature perceiving the usefulness of its own parts, and loving them and striving (conatur) to defend them with ail its strength ; henee we can very easily understand the reason why nature shudders at the solution of continuity to such a great degree (32). » If the continuity of its own being is in danger, nature « rises up in defence of its own continuity and drives back the aggressor, if it is (31) Glisson, op. cit. in n. 3, 483.

In Glisson's vital confédérations Hobbes's status naturce reigns : every vital principie is enemy to every vital principie, warlike rela tionships domínate and the nisus prœvalens always subdues the nisus impotens, even though it resists in every way that it can. On a microscopic level the situation repeats itself : mínima naturalia pre serve their own, albeit precarious, identities (inserted as they are in a circuit, of unions and reunions) by eluding anything that tries to sub divide them into smaller units. This is not enough. Mínima naturalia withstand any attempt to be divided by adopting a precise strategy of diversion : by concealing themselves through their very smallness, by uniting to other bodies, pervaded as they are by an « appetite for reuniting » (appetitus reuniendi), and by changing shape : «... matter, reduced to an outstanding smallness, rather than being further divided or tolerating the présent state any longer, assumes a new form, or a new law of being and acting, from the body nearest itself ; with this précaution, however : that from then on it avoids or supports more easily the bother of division (34). » This is also the reason why matter can have diversity in its states (solid, fluid and aeriform), and this is the origin, on a microscopic level, of the proteiform activity of matter. That the pénétration of bodies is a phenomenon really and constantly occurring in nature is witnessed by the processes of condensation, growth and nutri tion, by certain kinds of mixture and fusion. Ail this pro vides ample evidence that every time there is a real union among the parts of a body a process a reciprocal subdual (mutua subitio ele mentorum) takes place. Apart from the cases of confusio, coaptatio, alligatio and agglutinatio, a process of subdual (subitio) is always at stake among the elements of a compound (35).

The act through which nature ^//"-confederates - a spontaneous and imma nent process - is a radically internai act, namely, a perceptive act. Therefore, if substance is essentially activity, activity is essentially perception, but natural perception, as Glisson carefully spécifiés more than once. Natural perception, being not a cognitive func tion, but, more fundamentally, a vital act, founds the life of nature (vita natura) without falling back again into the traditional apo rias of animism and anthropomorphism. Nevertheless, even if natu ral perception is much more « nature » than « perception », more energy than soul, it remains to be defined what kind of relationship exists between individual substance, that is, the thoroughly actuali zed substantial nature, and the perceptive act, which is the core of its energetic essence. The second point to be clarified in order to avoid misconcep tions about living and perceptive mínima naturalia is their ontologi cal status. In accordance with the Aristotelian philosophical frame work, mínima naturalia are not to be considered as principies of nature (principia natura), but not integral parts, and accordingly they are not substances.

Mínima naturalia are not substances, nor do they represent the metaphysical requirements for substantiality. Whereas in simple and perpetual substances such as angels, soûls and prime matter, the essential parts (subsistentia and natura energética) are not really différent, mutable substances are characterized by a transient energetic nature which joins with perpetual matter (36). Glisson's prime matter is one of the simple substances. Its nature is homogeneously and perpetually perceptive ; its extension is continuous and self-delimiting. Matter is not the resuit of a composition of corpuscles : mínima naturalia have no real exis tence outside the material continuum and particles are always the resuit of dividing motions. Since they are integral parts of mate rial substance, mínima naturalia cannot be considered as autono mous substantial principies. They are endowed with perception, appetite and motion inasmuch as they are particles of matter : their energetic nature is derivative and transient, being an additio nal and adventitious form deriving from the perpetual primeval life of prime matter. Primordial natural perceptive activity corres ponds to prime matter : both are inadéquate représentations of the one substantial energetic nature. In Glisson's ontology prime matter is one of the simple substances. Admittedly, other simple substances in the created universe are angels and rational soûls, but Glisson is always clearly agnostic about their metaphysical status. Accordingly, in the physical universe prime matter seems to be the only real individualization and contraction of the one substantial nature (prime matter as one individuum). More than a commonwealth of substantial principies, Glisson's doctrine of substance outlines a sophisticated kind of materialistic monism. Nevertheless, Cudworth's anxieties on a moral and political level can easily be understood. (36) Glisson, op. cit. in n. 3, 472: « Solvitur [mistum] in partes essentiales, nempe in materiam primant, et formam physicam : hoc est, in naturam seu essentiam primcevam, perpe tuam, per se subsistentem ; et naturam seu essentiam adventitiam, additionalem, caducam, qua intérim compositum specificatur. » See also ibid., 4, 28-29.</page><page sequence="18">256 Guido Giglioni V. — HYLOZOISM AS a DEGENERATION OF TRUE ATOMISM Metaphysical and scientific théories may obviously have political and social import, and in turn political and religious changes can influence the view people have of nature at a certain time. The expé rience of the English révolution provided différent people such as Hobbes, latitudinarians, dissenters, radical sectarians and enthu siasts with a social and ideological context in which to work out a wide range of intellectual responses. Certain views of nature can support a particular political settlement just as political théories and social idéologies can inspire basic lines of thought in scientific research : one has only to think of how the unfolding of the provi dential plan in both history and nature had long represented a powerful heuristic tool in natural philosophy. Of course, such influences are never predetermined and unidirectional, and the boundaries are always permeable. Therefore, given the close interre lationship between représentations of natural order and visions of political organization, it is not out of place to conclude this essay with a quick glance at this aspect in Glisson's vital corpuscularia nism, all the more so since during his life Glisson went through three important political upheavals (Civil War, Interregnum and Restora tion) unscathed. In addition, he remained an important institutional figure who held major positions (président and consiliarius of the London Collège of physicians, regius professor at the university of Cambridge, and member of the Royal Society). Hylozoism became a physico-theological question particularly from the 1670s onward, when the religious and ideological implica tions associated with the emphasis on nature and life as autono mous powers carne clearly to light (signifícantly Spinoza's Tracta tus theologico-politicus was published in 1670). In addition, Frans Cuiper's Arcana atheismi revelata (1676) had shifted the attention of worried theologians and godly men from the mechanical disbe lievers to the « modem » atheists who preferred to resort to the « innate life of matter (37) ». Glisson was agnostic in both religious (37) See Giglioni, op. cit. in η. 1 (1996) : Anatomist atheist ?..., 124-125. On Cuiper, see Rosalie L.

This does not mean that some consé quences could not perilously be drawn from his metaphysical and physiological théories. Cudworth's sardonic expression « commo nowealth of percipients » obviously hints at the republican govern ment during the interregnum. The fact that the Cambridge plato nist uses the word « commonwealth » to label Glisson's idea of natural confederacy is extremely significant. In this connection, Glisson's notion of confederacy of mínima naturalia can be viewed as a good example of the exchange of meanings occurring between the domains of natural and political order. More specifically, the shift from corpuscularian théories of matter to Systems of political and social organization may happen quite easily. Whereas a feudal system represents itself in terms of a hierarchized organism, the early modem théories of particulate matter seem to prefigure the aspirations of a new society based on the centrifugal thrusts of individuáis (39). But, as we have seen, mechanical atomism was not the only version of corpuscularia nism. Glisson's corpuscularianism, for instance, has a definite metaphysical foundation in hylozoism. The confederacies of mínima naturalia are self-constituting units which fulfill an ideal plan originally contained in the nature of matter. In Glisson's view the mínima naturalia are mínima of energy. They represent the minimum threshold of perceptive energy beyond which parti cles of the life/matter structure lose their spécifie and constitutive identity. And since in Glisson's ontology the ultímate reason for individuation is matter's « self-idea » (idea suiipsius), and the idea is not an external and transcendent character of being, corpuscu larianism is simply the way the transformations of matter mirror the energetic nature of substance, that is, its life. In such a view there is no room for governing matter and motion by recourse to external spiritual forces (that is, providence) or to external sources of motion - which is a basic assumption in mechanical corpuscu larianisms. Furthermore, Glisson's theory of living matter could not help (38) Up to now, I have not found overt déclarations of religious and political faith in Glisson's both published and manuscript work. (39) On this point see : Crawford B. Macpherson, The Political Theory of possessive individualism : Hobbes to Locke (Oxford : Oxford Univ. Press, 1964) ; Gideon Freudenthal, Atom und Individuum im Zeitalter Newtons : Zur Genese der mechanistichen Natur- und Sozialphilosophie (Frankfurt : Suhrkamp, 1982).</page><page sequence="20">258 Guido Giglioni but reinforce the Harveian emphasis on the primacy of the blood in the bodily economy (40). This idea, too, evoked political analo gies : if the blood is the common substance of life, and nutritive juices transform themselves incessantly into blood, a communis vitce societas had to be assumed in order for lower degrees of life to develop into nobler ones. One same process of natural progression thus characterized both the natural constitution (politia naturalis) and the civil state (respublica civilis) (41). Obviously, such a radical view on life challenged the normative character of the natural (and moral) order. In his genealogy of atheism, Cudworth considers « atomology » to have been originally the trae physics of a spiritualistic metaphy sics. To « physiologize atomically » présupposés the acknowledge ment that there must be something else in nature besides mat ter (42).

On the contrary, hylozoism is a sort of degeneration of true atomism into a monstruous divinization of matter, « God being no other than such a life of nature in matter, as was both devoid of sense and consciousness, and also multiplied together with the several parts of it (45) ». According to Cudworth, what makes hylozoism a nonsensical kind of corpuscularianism is its attributing the life of nature not to one common principie gover ning the whole material universe, but to each single part of matter, so that there are as many « plastic lives » as there are atoms of matter (46). The political and religious implications underlying the « funda mental error of the life of matter » stand out when one considers the absurd conséquences following from the model of the living confederacy : «... to say that these innumerable particles of matter so ail confedé rate together ; that is, to make every man and animal to be a multitude or commonwealth of percipients and persons as it were clubbing together, is a thing so absurd and ridiculous that one would wonder the hylozoists should not rather chuse to recant their fundamental errour of the life of matter than endeavour to seek shelter and sanctuary for the same under such a pretence. For though voluntary agents and persons may many of them resign up their wills to one, and by that means have ail but as it were one artificial will, yet can they not possibly resign up their sense and understanding : much less could this be done by senseless atoms, or parti cles of matter supposed to be devoid of ail consciousness and anima lity (47). » The « commonwealth of percipients » threatens the theocentric and anthropocentric image of the world, rejecting God as the « eternal unmade fountain of life and understanding » and the existence of of Greek philosophy : A study in the history of English philosophical ideas, Acta universita tis gotoburgensis, XLIX (1943) ; Robert Hugh Kargon, Atomism in England from Hariot to Newton (Oxford : Clarendon, 1966), 93-105.

Even more than Hobbes' Leviathan, the confederacy of perceptive particles destroyed any form of political obligation and lead to a stark depersonalization of the whole world (48). Cudworth was not the only one to be worried in those years by the image of « a heap of innumerable percipients », each one with its « innumerable perceptions and intellections ». Henry More detected the same danger in Glisson's vital corpuscularia nism (49). Decentralization and perceptive pluralism, with the conséquent négation of a central source of consciousness, could give an anarchie image of the physico-organic processes of nature, but what was more serious in the eyes of theologians such as Cudworth and More was that decentralization and perceptive plu ralism were undermining the basis of the idea of life centered around self-consciousness, and thus the individual immortality of the soul, and thus the foundation of the moral order of the world. Hylozoism, therefore, could have relevant conséquences from a sociopolitical point of view. The dichotomy between « from below » and « from above », between the idea of an all-pervasive dissémination of vital principies and the unity of consciousness, between a pluralism of autonomous vital centers and the hegemony of the form as an expression of the organizing power of the whole over the parts could mirror différent ways of seeing the social esta blishment. The emphasis on central organization and the primacy of the form in théories of natural philosophy often concealed anxieties about the amorphous and anarchie power of matter. Since the material substratum may be indefinitely divided, material substance appeared fated to crumble into a myriad of particles. If matter was assumed to be endowed with life and perception, the resuit was a teeming confédération of sentient principies. Cudworth (48) Cudworth also refers to the « anti-monarchical opinion » according to which there would be « many understanding beings, or minds, self-originated, and independent (none of which therefore could be omnipotent)» (op. cit. in n. 7, 71-72).

From this point of view, hylozoism still echoed civil disorder and religious dissension, doctrinal disputes and social instability. Historians have in many ways drawn attention to the social and political fears roused in the seventeenth century by such views on matter and life. The idea of multitudes of conflicting particles, driven by the instinct of self preservation, could resemble the compétitive struggle of each for power over others and already mirror in a way the unbridled self interest of the rising market forces. It could also recall the claims of levellers and independents concerning the freedom to develop one's own capacities, the right to one's labor and the active pro prietorship of one's person (50). Significantly, the natural and political imagery was to be resu med by Diderot and other eighteenth-century materialists who regarded animal life as a « swarm of bees », a « juxtaposition of several sensitive molécules » in which each sensitive particle of matter strives to maintain its own identity (51). The ancient idea of a constant state of conflict and subdual among the active qua lities was inbedded in a metaphysical view centered around the unifying power of the form. In such a framework, isonomy and homeostasis seemed to govern and résolve conflicts in nature. In Glisson's view, the structure of self-preservation mirroring a dee per self-representative structure (idea suiipsius) could still gua rantee a form of continuity and balance in nature.
