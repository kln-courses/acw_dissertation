<plain_text><page sequence="1">DRAWING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN, by Betty Ed- wards. Los Angeles: J. P. Tarcher, 1979, 199 pp., $8.95 paper. In this new "how to" book, Betty Edwards presents a series of exercises de- signed to teach drawing. Although there is certainly nothing new in the idea of teaching drawing this way, Edwards has developed a fresh and intriguing perspective. Drawing heavily on the split-brain research conducted by Roger W. Sperry and his associates at Cal Tech, Edwards posits the necessity of a "cognitive shift" from the L-mode to the R-mode of perception in order to render a drawing accurately (L and R stand for the left and right hemi- spheres of the brain). In order to draw any object, says Edwards, it is neces- sary to see it correctly. This special kind of seeing is, according to Sperry's theory, a function of the right or spatially oriented brain hemisphere. The trick, then, is to learn to switch from the left or logical, verbal hemisphere of the brain to the right hemisphere before beginning to draw. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain teaches one how to make the shift, how to draw shapes which one then sees, and how, finally, to elaborate those shapes with various types of shading. In addition to the exercises, Edwards provides en- couraging examples and testimonies taken from her own students' work. Through these she creates a tone which supports the aspiring artist. Edwards</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 115 also tells us how her frustrations encountered in teaching students to draw, coupled with her conviction that anyone can be taught to draw, propelled her toward the discovery of this new methodology. Her obvious dedication to solving the problems of teaching/learning is compelling. Some caveats, however, are in order. My apprehension centers on the finality with which Edwards presents the theory that the brain hemispheres have highly independent functions and on the anthropomorphic language which she uses when discussing them. "When confronted with a drawing task, the left hemisphere comes rushing in with its verbally linked systems; after- ward, ironically, the left brain is all too ready to supply derogatory words of judgment if the drawing looks childlike or naive" (p. 82). It does not take an impossibly literal mind to realize that for the success of Edwards's methods it is unnecessary and perhaps even misleading to posit the mind as made up of two contentious factions, each trying to dominate our perceptions. It would have been better simply to point out that some kind of a shift in perception must precede an attempt to draw an object accurately and then to take us through the exercises. Edwards also asserts (in a vaguely petulant tone) that the L-mode is favored in our society and in our schools to the detriment of the R-mode. It is unfortunate that she feels compelled to mix social com- mentary with pedagogy, and a less loaded attitude toward the villainous L- mode would, I think, have been a more appropriate posture. These quarrels, however, are not intended to undermine the contribution the volume makes. Edwards is a dedicated, inspiring teacher whose experi- ences are well worth sharing and whose recommendations for learning to draw, if followed, will undoubtedly yield satisfying results. Nancy M.
