<plain_text><page sequence="1">dana m. Oswald, Monsters, Gender and Sexuality in Medieval English Literature. Gender in the Middle Ages 5. Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2010. Pp. 227. ISBN: 978-1-8438-4232-3. $95.00. Monsters make frequent appearances in medieval texts, and Arthurian narratives yield a trove: the spectacularly belligerent giant of Mont Saint Michel, the monstrous herdsman of Chretien's Yvain, Melion in his wolf's body, and the enigmatic Green Knight who so troubles Gawain, among many others. A source of fascination and fear, the monster matters. These uncanny and anthropomorphic creatures inhabit an ambivalent space. Yet they are also strongly gendered. Dana M. Oswald's intriguing book helps the reader to understand what is at stake in the complexities of monstrous masculinity and femininity. Monsters are a 'delicious terror' (3), the nexus of which is their embodied sexuality. In learned and readable prose Oswald surveys a temporally vast span of monstrous figures in English texts, from the Wonders ofthe East to Sir Gowther by way of Beowulf and the Book of John Mandeville. This arc also traces a change in the monster, from a figure of inassimilable difference ('undeviating strangeness' that is 'born not made') to a potentially transformable body. The analytical backbone of the book is wide-ranging, making use of Jacques Derrida on dijferance, Judith Butler on the performability of gender, Jeffrey Cohen on monster theory, and Gayle Rubin on women in circulation, among many others. Monsters, Gender and Sexuality does not lack for focus, however, especially because Oswald is extraordinarily sensitive to visuality's relation to monstrosity. Whenever possible, she reads texts with their images. Thus in a complicated chapter on the Old English compendium of monsters known as Wonders of the East, much of her evidence is archival. The three types of monstrous erasure she details are mainly derived from the interspace between texts and illustrations ('removal,' when a viewer scratches out something depicted; 'never drawn,' an erasure that applies when details of monstrous sexuality are omitted from a particular picture and knowable only through nearby text or from another manuscript; or 'revision,' when a detail is hidden within view and likewise recoverable through more reading or comparison). When manuscripts are not illustrated, Oswald reads texts for the monstrous images they provideâ€”or refuse to provide. Thus Grendel's mother is j ust as actively vanished as some of the denizens of the Wonders of the East tradition. In every case, erasure both obviates and creates something new. Readers of this journal will be most interested in the concluding chapter of the book, which examines paternity and monstrosity in two Arthurian works; the Alliterative Morte Arthure (which features an over-the-top rendition of the battle between Arthur and the giant of Mont Saint Michel) and Sir Gowther (the incubus</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 143 spawned title character is the half brother of Merlin). With an illuminating emphasis on ingestion and gender, Oswald excavates how the monster is differently managed in the romance and the Breton lai. The cannibalistic and rapacious giant must be castrated and killed; the former rapist and chaos artist Gowther must be transformed into man. Whereas slaying the giant ends its narrative life, Gowthers becoming a knight is at once filled with hope and uncertainty: can the monstrous trace fully be eliminated? Then again, asks Oswald, doesn't a trace of the giant continue to inhabit Arthur after his defeat of the monster? Aren't both Gowther and Arthur, with their lack of heirs and consequent lack of futurity, both dead ends? 'Bodies resist categories,' Oswald declares in her conclusion (207), and therefore 'we are all monsters.' Some authorial choices do give pause. Why limit the language of the texts examined to English? Considering that the sources discussed have analogues in other insular tongues, the focus on Old and Middle English literature seems unnecessary; in the case of the Book of John Mandeville, it is misleading. Why not tie monstrosity more forcefully to aboriginality or racial alterity? I also wondered at the consistent linking of genitality to a heterosexual, reproductive economy. For Oswald the sex organs always indicate the possibility of progeny to come, thus making a sexed monster inherently dangerous because he or she will generate more monsters. Isn't it possible, though, for the depiction of genitals to arouse desires that are nonprocreative, queer? Monsters are messy that way. But I do not want to lose sight of the valuable contribution Oswald has made to studies of the medieval monstrous. With its erudite and meticulous attention to why gender and sexuality matter when studying the monster, this book distinguishes itself as an original, persuasive, and useful work of scholarship. Oswald is to be commended for her achievement here, a satisfying combination of archival work, close reading, and adept use of theory.
