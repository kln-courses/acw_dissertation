<plain_text><page sequence="1">NARRATION AND MONSTRATION IN THE CINEMA ANDR? GAUDREAULT The scope of narratology has so greatly expanded of late that those who work with it have sought to widen its field of applica bility. Film as narrative, however, poses rather serious problems for the narratologist whose conceptual tools for analysing works which lie well beyond the ken of that which can legitimately be called "literature" remain few in number. Consequently, therefore, such already ambivalent terms as "narrative," "narra tion," or "narrator" pose problems when they are used outside their field. Indeed, as soon as one leaves the realm of verbal nar rative (that which is transmitted solely by words), it becomes difficult to locate or identify with any degree of certainty the illocutionary origin of the narrative ?nonc?s. For, unlike most other narrative forms, the purely verbal narrative (novel, short story, tale, etc.) always presents itself (to a greater or lesser extent, which need not concern us immediately) as the pro duction of a "unified organizing con sciousness" which is responsible for the ?nonc?s. Whenever there is speech, some one is speaking. As soon as words are given the slightest organisation, they always already appear as the product of a particular speaker (whether s/he be visible or not, anthropomorphic or not), and it is always relatively easy to identify with some degree of certainty (or at least to name it, to give it a singluar name) the illocutionary origin of the narrative ?nonces. Such is notably the case for the scriptural narrative1 which always remains rooted in a "narrator" (in the strict sense: a basic function or agent responsible for conveying the narrative). This also gives rise to the numerous narratological problems which arise when ever a narrative seems to be produced by any of the many (sub)functions or agents such as the flesh and blood characters of the theatre or the "shadow and light" char acters of the cinema which appear to move about either on the stage or the screen quite autonomously (precisely because of their apparent "humanity"). Herein lies the origin of all the difficulties which emerge when the conceptual apparatus of narratology which has traditionally been devoted to the description of purely verbal (and more often than not of purely scrip tural) phenomena is transferred to the study of theatrical2 and filmic narrative. This is why it is of the utmost importance to distinguish clearly between the two basic means for conveying a story which can be called narration and monstration, as I have argued elsewhere (Gaudreault, Prol?gom?nes). In keeping with my hypotheses, scriptural narrative is con veyed only in the mode of narration (despite some quite spurious indicators of monstration) whereas theatrical narrative is conveyed solely in the mode of monstration3 (despite some equally spuri ous indicators of narration). But what exactly is the status of filmic nar rative? In which mode does the filmic narrative operate? Is it in a mode more akin to narration or to monstration? Or ANDR?

Gaudreault JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO XXXIX, (Spring 1987) 29</page><page sequence="2">indeed is filmic narrative not perhaps con veyed through a complex of narration and monstration? In their own way and in their own terms, many film theorists have answered this type of question, with dis tinctly different results. It is quite obvious and quite undeniable that film "shows" things. But to what extent (if at all) can it safely be assumed that film "narrates"? Consensus has yet to be reached. Indeed, the frequent hesitation between "narration" (to narrate) and "monstra tion" (to show) that occurs when it becomes necessary to identify the funda mental mode of film's story-telling func tion only serves to illustrate clearly that, initially, filmic temporality tends rather to situate itself on the side of theatre (of monstration) than on the side of scriptural narrative (of narration). Iuri Lotman states this in an almost peremptory man ner: "In every art related to sight and to iconic signs, only one time is possible: the present" (136). Of course, filmic narrative is based upon a kind of temporal manipu lation that is quite impossible in the theatre, but, as has often been noted, it still "does not possess (...) the temporal flexi bility of the written word" (Vanoye 179). It can undoubtedly perform certain tem poral feats (flashback, flashforward, etc.) which are for all intents and purposes for bidden to the theatre but, like the theatre, it does seem to be eternally "condemned" to being "the site of presence itself (Bellour 275). As Metz has pointed out, a spectator arriving at a film in the middle of a flashback could not possibly know that the pictures on the screen portray the past, relative to some original time of "narra tion" (47). Indeed, it has for all intents and purposes, become a common place to state that filmic narrative, like the theatre, knows only the present tense.4 Such a statement, which bears the weight of the obvious and which seems truly self-evident (indeed, so self-evident as to be suspect) represents, in my view, a blind spot of film theory which is attributable yet again to "the most amazing magical apparatus there has ever been":5 the cinematograph. The question of the temporal modalities which filmic narrative sets into play is less simple than it might appear and it is through it that I shall attempt to pose the problem of film's narrative modes. The equivalence usually established between present time and monstration, on the one hand, and between past time and narration, on the other, seems hard to deny. Filmic narrative does appear to be inextricably linked to the contradiction this equivalence causes. This leads to con clusions with important consequences for the questions we are trying to resolve. As a result, in a dissertation dealing mainly with the difficulties of adapting scriptural narrative for the screen, Michel Colin states: It appears therefore that filmic narra tive transforms novellistic narrative whose action is set in the past into a narrative of the present, by trans forming "telling" into "showing". The novel "tells" what has happened whereas the file "shows" what is hap pening (...) [This] is determined by the fact that they result from two quite different "language acts", the novel "tells, the film shows" (156). Such a statement raises the crucial prob lem of the possibility of film's access to the sphere of narration. The question of film's position in relation to the two modes of "telling" (or "narrating") and "showing" has often been raised. Unlike scriptural narrative, filmic narrative seems to fall under a form of mimetic di?gesis,6 rather like the theatre. Would then the funda mental agent responsible for communicat ing the narrative of film therefore be a monstrator which, like the theatrical monstrator, would be deprived of the fac ulty of narration, despite some occasional 30 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO XXXIX, (Spring 1987)</page><page sequence="3">manifestations of it? Would it be reason able, however, to say that this monstrator, as "grand image-maker," could carry out all the work of monstration without ever drawing upon the resources of narration? I think not. It seems to me that the instance which conveys filmic narrative is both a monstrator and a narrator, as I shall now attempt to demonstrate. One of the main reasons why the theatrical monstrator is unable to move beyond monstration lies in the fact that s/he (or, more accurately, it) is locked into a single temporal modality: the present. As Ivo Osolsobe has stated: "It could be said that the "grammar" of ostention knows only the indicative present tense"(417). Monstration is the present: in order to show what was, it has to show it in the here and now. The situation of the cinema is, however, quite different from that of the theatre "simply" because of the existence of editing, the activity which permits spatio-temporal segments to be articu lated together. Indeed, the theatre has no "... flashback, no fragmentation of the image seen at a glance, no framing and no breaking down of shots which, in the cin ema, lead the spectator by the hand" (Ubersfeld, L'Ecole 303-304). Indeed, the theatre and the cinema are most often dis tinguished, at the narrative level, precisely by the fact that the instance responsible for filmic narrative can effectively direct the spectator. Without even pausing to consider the many temporal variations which it affords, we can agree that editing is the privileged operations by which a cin ematic "narrator"7 intervenes. This has in fact been indicated by all film theorists (Bal?sz, Mitry, Metz, etc.). It is therefore because of editing that the spectator gets the feeling that s/he does not watch the story which unfolds before him/her through his/her eyes alone. It is mainly through the successive positionings of the camera that the spectator comes to per ceive the role of this helper (who is sometimes an opponent!) which is the cin ematic narrator. For, like the scriptural narrator, the filmic narrator imposes (or can impose) a look upon the spectator. This is to say, then, that the narrated world, of both filmic and scriptural narra tives, is the result of an intermediary look. And it is precisely this unavoidable pre supposition of an intermediary look8 which in turn implies the existence of a "time of reflection" on the part of the nar rating instance, a time which necessarily situates itself somewhere between the moment at which the events occurred (or are supposed to have occurred) and the moment at which they are perceived by the narratee.9 And this is not the case with "scenes" which have been produced by the monstrator, in the theatre or the cin ema. The rule of the game which theatre imposes upon its monstrator is to make "events appear to be happening in the present" (Van Rossum-Guyon 488). This is because the theatre "is a present which knows nothing of the past" (Thomas Mann quoted by Ubersfeld, Lire 243), "the (theatre) actor's work is an enuncia tion in the present which therefore forces the spectator to experience the fictional past physically, as though it were in the present" (Ubersfeld, Lire 243). The physi cal presence of actors in the theatre produces in effect a "resurrection before which spectators must forget that they are watching the past" (D. S. Likhatchev quoted by Lotman 136). Or as Michel Butor would say in his analysis of (scrip tural) narrative in the third person which lack any apparent narrator, "the distance between reported events and the moment at which they are reported obviously has no incidence" (77). In the cinema as well (if, as I propose, the function of the monstrator is identified with the process of shooting the film) there is no possibility of opening a temporal gap, a breach within which the narrating JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO XXXIX, (Spring 1987) 31</page><page sequence="4">instance could allow itself to "reflect" upon the world it narrates, conveying its substance through the filter of its view point. But this is not due to the immediacy of the spectator's vision, as in the theatre, nor, to say the same thing in other words, is it due to the coincidence of the spectator's vision with the action which is represented. In the cinema, the monstrator always shows something which, in one way or another, has been. It is rather due to the coincidence between the action represented and the vision of the monstrator, that is to say of the camera, which can be said to have been delegated by the monstrator to occupy the place of the spectator during the period of the action to be recorded. It is because the monstrator, any monstrator, clings so closely to the imme diacy of the "representation" that it is incapable of opening up this gap in the temporal continuum. That which I am shown now might very well have been pro duced before it was shown to me;10 as a process of monstration it remains a rigourously synchronous simultaneous "narration", to use the words of Genette. (Fronti?res 158). Only the narrator can sweep us along on its flying carpet through time. It is the intersection, the meeting, of two viewpoints, the viewpoint of the nar rator and the viewpoint of the narratee which opens up the gap allowing for tem poral "difference": I see now (indirectly in the case of scriptural narrative, "directly"11 in the case of filmic narrative) from without, that which the narrator adjutant saw before vat, from within. It is the narrator who re-places before my eyes, in whatever order suits it, events which have already occurred. The conclusion which must be drawn from this cinematic situation is that it is the editing activity of the filmic narrator which allows for the inscription of a true narrative past.12 One must recognize that if the shot is in the present tense, if it is in fact a past made present, then certain edit ing operations (though clearly not all) allow for the mastery of time which is one of the possibilities of all narrational activ ity. Whence the importance of Metz's reaction to the affirmation that "diegetic time is present time": "Is it not rather the filmic image that is always in the present? And is the film, for its part, like the novel, not always in the past?"(73) This observa tion, however, needs to be specified. The image, as a shot (as an uninterrupted flow of frames), is perceived as being in the present but editing allows for the irruption of a narrating instance which takes the spectator "by the hand" and makes him/ her undergo various temporal experi ences. Whence also the importance of distinguishing clearly between the time of action and the time of viewing, as Jean Paul Simon has suggested (58). It is through editing that the narrator can exercise its power over the narrated. And if it can be stated that editing is the opera tion which affords it the opportunity of abstracting itself from the present (the present itself of the narrated), it is because this situation is entirely analogous to stan dard filmic practice outside of any narratological considerations. It is indeed the case that the editor (= the narrator) receives the material (= the shots) which have been recorded by the camera (= the monstrator); therefore he carries out his structuring activity only after the action "shown" has already reached an irrevoca ble end. And, just like the narrator of a scriptural narrative, this editor-narrator can henceforth become, to use Otto Ludwig's words (quoted by Kayser 81): ... the absolute master of time and space... He can do whatever thought can do, he represents without any of reality's fetters, he stages events with out a care for physical impossibility, he is endowed with all the powers of nature and of the mind. 32 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO XXXIX, (Spring 1987)</page><page sequence="5">In contrast, the cinematic monstrator is "caught" within the constrains of reality, of its reality: the camera, the reality of 24 frames per second.13 The camera monstrator's activity is necessarily of a continuous nature (at least under normal conditions of shooting and exhibition). And this is so despite the fact that it is rooted initially in discontinuity. The artic ulation between frames produces an intrinsic illusion of continuity which is founded on fundamentally discontinuous raw material. Indeed, what could be more discontinuous than a succession of frames breaking down a movement? Between each pair of images, there is always and necessarily a missing interval, a gap, which even extreme slow motion filming cannot eradicate. But during projection, the syn thetic operation that brings the pictures to "life", all discontinuity vanishes. And it is the life brought to the pictures which is (of necessity) in the present: the past is indeed rendered present. If we return to Benveniste who states that the present is "the coincidence of the event described with the discursive instance describing it" (262) we must agree that the monstrator's product, the shot, is as tem porally ambiguous as could be. What exactly is the event described by the dis cursive instance which is the monstrator? Is it the event which occurs in front of the camera during the recording process which is shooting? Or is it the event which occurs during the restitution process which is projection? As for myself, I have little doubt that the monstrator's "speech act" occurs during projection but that the "event described" occurs at an earlier moment, during shooting. The illusion of the present provided by viewing the shot is then certainly nothing more than a simulacrum of the present. The fact remains, however, that whether past (as it is in realty) or present (as it presents itself), the shot "shows with no distinction of temporal planes," as has stated Francis Vanoye (181), which has well understood that the film image "is not in the present even if for the spectator it unfolds in the present" (181). How then can this tem poral ambiguity be resolved? Quite easily if we consider the filmic monstrator's activity of monstration to be a type of quoting,14 regardless of whether one is dealing with a narrative of events or a nar rative in words. Quite literally, the filmic monstrator quotes characters when they speak: it extracts a segment of linguistic reality and restores it linguistically (by means of the sound track). The same quot ing occurs, metaphorically, when it extracts from reality a segment of actions and gestures at the shooting stage and then restores them iconically on the filmic image. In a novel, the passage: "Then Pierre replied: / feel very UP is said to be in the past, even though the sentence uttered by Pierre is in the present. The filmic monstrator does the same thing when it quotes (restores now what had occurred earlier) through the sound track the sen tence which Pierre had spoken and when it quotes in the present the gestures which Pierre had made.15 It remains the case, however, that the "unipunctuality"16 to which the monstrator is bound prevents it irreduci bly from modulating the temporal flow of the narrative: it is an eternal past, which, even though it moves forward, can not be conjugated in any other terms. Only the narrator (= the editor) can inscribe, between two shots (by means of cuts and articulations) the mark of its viewpoint, can introduce a guided reading and thereby transcend the temporal oneness which unavoidably constrains the dis course of monstration. Only through the articulations which it accomplishes can the filmic narrator become like the scrip tural narrator and "emphasize the tem poral distance between the present time of narration and the past time of the story" (Lintvelt 56). The narrator "speaks" through the articulations. As the "sover eign speaker,"17 the narrator may choose JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO XXXIX, (Spring 1987) 33</page><page sequence="6">to make its power over the temporal flow of the narrated more or less felt, and it enjoys nearly all the same powers of tem poral modulation as does the scriptural narrator. It could therefore be said that the cinema contains, each at a different level, two types of narrative. The shot is a sort of micro-narrative on whose basis is erected a second narrative at another, higher level. On the whole, then, filmic narrative is the result of the superimposition of two layers of narrativity, each of which belongs to one of the two "articulations"18 of the dou ble mobility characteristic of cinema: the articulation between frames and the artic ulation between shots, to use the terms set forth by Roman Gubern (8). These two layers of narrativity do not originate in the same type of semio-narrative operations and each ultimately presupposes the exis tence of two separate instances each responsible for their respective communi cation. In order to produce a "pluripunctual" filmic narrative, one must, first of all, call upon a monstrator, which, during the shooting, records a mul titude of micro-narratives (the shots) which each possess, in the final analysis, a certain narrative autonomy.19 The micro narratives are produced through the mode of monstration and cannot accede to the status of narration, as we understand it. One must then call upon another narrating instance, the narrator, which will take charge of the micro-narratives and, depending on how "enamoured" with nar rative it is, will work upon their narrative substance in order to negate their auton omy. The narrator takes this material and inscribes its own viewpoint there, trans posing it into a continuous guided reading for the spectator. The cinema is, therefore, a complex of mimetic dieg?sis and non-mimetic di?g?sis, of monstration and narration, contrary to the conclusions of Francis Vanoye: "Strictly speaking, film does not "narrate, it shows" (72). The fundamental instance responsible for communicating the filmic narrative is composed of two parts. Therein lies the narrative originality and specificity of the cinema. The filmic monstrator-narrator brings about syncretically the union, the merging of the two basic modes of narrative communica tion: narration and monstration. Translated from French by Paul Attallah and revised by Tom Gunning. Notes Reference will be made throughout to scrip tural rather than to written narrative in order quite simply to mark, within the very designa tion of the object of study, the necessary coalescence between the product (the narrative) and the vehicle (writing). The expression writ ten narrative lends itself too easily to the idea of a total autonomy of the two entities, with the first term being altogether too passive. At any rate, one also generally speaks of a filmic narra tive rather than of a filmed narrative. 2It should be noted that the expression "theat rical narrative" is used here to refer only to narrative produced on stage and not to the play under its written form which must be seen as a type of "scriptural narrative". 3This is a term which I have chosen in order to avoid the use of "representation", which is both too marked and too polys?mie. Though it is lit tle used, monstration does appear to be a more functional term. Without turning it into a nar rative mode, Betty Rojtman gave it recently a meaning which I adopted in my dissertation: "The theatre is mimetic and proposes to its audience-receiver the "monstration" of a lan guage articulated directly through the charac ters" (106). It should be added, as regards the cinema, that Xavier de France has also used this term with a somewhat different meaning. Con sequently, the basic agent responsible for the communication of a narrative of monstration such as a theatre play is the "monstrator," which stands to monstration as the narrator stands to narration. 4I myself at one time subscribed to this idea as an almost definitive fact. (Detours 47). 5Ingmar Bergman, quoted without references in the 1980 schedule of the "Cin?matographe," the film society of the Coll?ge de Sainte-Foy in Qu?bec City. 6This refers to Plato's concept of mimesis (The Republic, Book III) which is so named in 34 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO XXXIX, (Spring 1987)</page><page sequence="7">order to make its status as diegesis stand out. Contrary to general belief, Plato never opposed mimesis to diegesis. In his scheme, diegesis has two main forms: haple diegesis (simple narra tive) and diegesis dia m?meseos (narrative via imitation). It should be added, however, that mimetic diegesis here has a meaning somewhat different from the strict meaning Plato gave to his concept of mimesis which was worked out at a time when scriptural narrative did not yet really exist. See for further information my dis sertation (Prol?gom?nes 171) or my paper on the subject (Mimesis). 7The inverted commas should indicate clearly that the existence of such a function has not yet been resolved. 8As regards the cinema, the word "look" can be rather confusing. I am not referring here to the literal look which is a property of the cam era. I am referring rather to a "directed look" (a guided reading) at the narrated world which is obviously presupposed by the syntagmatic jux taposition of shots. The "look" of the camera, with few exceptions (such as camera move ments to which I shall return) does not bind the spectator's look to any particular guided read ing, as is true also of a scene in the theatre. 9I owe this idea to Michel Colin who said in a conversation: "For there to be narration, there has to have been a narrator who stands outside the here and now of the ?nonce'. Likewise, if there is editing, there necessarily has to be some organizing instance whose intervention occurs after the filmed event." 10In the theatre, it is assumed that the re presented events happened elsewhere. In the cinema, the same applies, with the additional twist that the work of the actors took place prior to its re-presentation (therefore its re-repre sentation) on the screen. 11 The inverted commas should indicate that this is in fact an illusion. 12And, in all likelihood, of all the other tem poral modalities of language. Consequently, the narrator can draw upon the resources of the conditional and of the optative: for example, the "sequence of possibilities" in which the two heroes flee in a car in Pierrot le fou (Jean-Luc Godard, 1965). ,3Or 16 f.p.s. as in silent films. Or, in fact, at any speed (greater than 10 f.p.s. below which the illusion of continuous movement ceases) so long as it is projected at the same speed. 14Quoting is the name I give to the type of showing which is the faithful reproduction of dialogue presumably spoken by the characters of a scriptural narrative (- reported speech). (Gaudreault, Prol?gom?nes 154). 15 Quoting is a way of making the past "pres ent" again. Any quotation is in fact a way of reactualizing a moment from the past. ,6I have formed this noun from two terms put forward by Eisenstein: "In the unipunctual cin ema (single point of view with fixed camera), we are dealing with pictural composition. In the pluripunctual cinema (with changes in point of view), we are dealing with composition through montage". Quoted by Lotman 83-84. 17I owe this expression to Ropars Wuileumier (19). 18" Articulation" here bears no resemblance to its usage in linguistics. 19The autonomy of micro-narratives is so great that it took about 15 years, from 1895 to 1910, before they were brought together into the single continuous flow and before the cine matic narrator was thereby brought into exis tence. On this subject, see my articles dealing with the origins of the cinema: (Detours, Theat ricality, Temporality and L'Arriv?e). See as well Tom Gunning's doctoral dissertation, on the birth of the filmic narrator. It is furthermore probably worth noting that the understanding of the shot as an autonomous unit (indeed, as an autonomous narrative), all through the early years of the cinema (at least up until 1910), was fraught with consequences for the way in which film was understood at that time. It was because each shot was thought to be a kind of autono mous narrative that "temporal overlaps" were so common in the films of the day. This also explains, in my view, the essential particularity of almost all chase films of the period which was that any of the successive series of shots only ended after all the pursuants had left the screen.
