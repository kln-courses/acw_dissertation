<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORT SISTAN AND BALUCHESTAN PROJECT By S.M.S. Sajjadi Iranian Cultural Hertiage Organisation From 20 October to 12 February 2004, four different archaeological investigations took place in the Sistan and Baluchestan Region, located in the south- east of Iran: the seventh campaign of excavations at Shahr-i Sokhta, the fourth campaign at Dahanah-ye Qolaman and the first campaign at Tappeh Taleb Khan, all in Sistan, and the first at Tappeh Bampur in Baluchestan. The excavations at Tappeh Taleb Khan have been financed by the University of Zabol while the others took place under the patronage of the Iranian Cultural Heritage Organisation (ICHO). EXCAVATIONS AT SHAHR-I SOKHTA a. Graveyard During the seventh campaign of investigations at Shahr-i Sokhta, the excavations concentrated on the graveyard of the city and building No.1, in the Monumental Area. A total of 66 graves, with 74 skeletons and 421 grave goods, were unearthed in 12 squares, an area of 576 sq.m. The various squares measured 25 sq.m. (4 squares), 50 sq.m. (4), 75 sq.m. (1) and 100 sq.m. (2), in addition to the small square HYM, which was only a wall trench with the remains of one burial. Only three grave types have been found: simple pits (21 graves), bipartite pits (43) and catacombs (2). Two trenches, MIH (25 sq.m.) and HYS (50 sq.m.) resulted empty. The highest concentration of graves was found in squares HTY and HYI, each measuring 100 sq.m. and holding respectively 16 and 15 graves. With the excavations of these squares, only about 800 sq.m. of the central part of the graveyard remain unearthed, and their excavation is due in the next campaign, in order to build an open museum in the graveyard. b.

Dahanah-ye Qolaman. Building No. 1. of the site. To date, about 1400 sq.m. of this building have been excavated and more than 90 rooms and open spaces unearthed. It seems that the building was mainly erected during the second period of occupation of Shahr-i Sokhta before being abandoned for a very short period of time and later occupied again, with changes to the rooms of the southern part of the building, which was turned into a craftsman section. It seems that there are some traces of occupation during the last phases of the first period as well. During the last campaign, in order to reach the virgin soil, Spaces Nos 1 and 2 at the centre of building were excavated. A number of different objects were found, including clay anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines, beads, triangle terracotta discs, seal impressions, combs, textiles and ropes, all datable to the second period of occupation at Shahr-i Sokhta. EXCAVATIONS AT DAHANAH-YE QOLAMAN. FOURTH SEASON Dahanah-ye Qolaman is located about 44 km. south of Zabol. This site was discovered and excavated by Umberto Scerrato of IsMEO (now IsIAO) between 1960 and 1965. A total of 27 buildings have been identified on the surface of this site. In October 2000 a new series of excavations began here, concentrating on Building No. 15 (Fig. 1), a square shaped building c. 2500 sq.m. Traces of 36 long and narrow rooms (measuring an average of 10 by 3 m.) on the four sides of the building were found. Twenty rooms were excavated between 2000 and 2002 plus ten during the last season. All the excavated rooms have a door on to the courtyard and in some cases they are joined by one. The main materials used in this structure are mud- bricks (50 x 28 x 10 cm.), and chineh. All the walls gradually diminish in height towards the outside of the structure. To date, 30 rooms have been excavated. Mills, small and large basins, benches and platforms, bins and large storage vessels are the principal architectural elements found in these rooms, together with a great number of millstones, grinding stones, small terracotta columns and buff ware, cylinder- shaped beakers and various items of metal and stone fragments. Among other objects, a number of seal impressions, three-pointed bronze arrowheads and some female clay figurines are worth mentioning. In room No. 25, traces of a wall painting, together with incised images, have been found (Fig. 2). The wall painting is 128 cm. long and 37 cm. high, with a standing man, a chariot rider, shooting an animal with a bow in his hand, most probably a wild boar. Considering the general aspects of the wall painting, the hunter seems to be an important person or holder of authority of the Drangiana area. The great similarity of</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORT 249 Fig. 2. Dahanah-ye Qolaman. Wall painting, Room No. 25. this scene with the seal impression of Darius the Great hunting a lion in some ways confirms this assumption. According to the material and architectural elements, there is a great probability that this is a sacred structure which was used for some unknown ritual and for the production of ideological items and materials. TAPPEH TALEB KHAN Taleb Khan is the name of a small and round shaped site, 9 m. high, located about 15 km. south-east of Shahr-i Sokhta, at a distance of 50 m. from the road that goes from Zabol to Zahedan. The state of conservation of the site is poor, since its surface is badly damaged. Although it was supposed to be one of the dependent villages of Shahr-i Sokhta in the third millennium, there is very little of Shahr-i Sokhta's pottery on its surface. Most of the pottery fragments that have been collected in the lower trenches are clearly first millennium pottery from the area. Unpainted large buff ware jars, low deep buff ware bowls, red ware bowls, reddish and burnished fragments of bowls and jars, and some stamp decorated pottery, are part of the collection. Three small test trenches, CV, CVI and BIV, show that at least the first 2 m. of the southern slope of the mound were disturbed by mechanical intervention during last 40 years and as a result there is a great mixture of materials ranging from the third to the first millennium B.C. An eastern step trench (BIV) shows that there were at least three different platforms below the surface, but only on the second are there some traces of a badly preserved wall, a floor and a small oven. Neither on these platforms, nor on the floor, was any material found to help better understand these layers. EXCAVATIONS AT BAMPUR The site, well known as a third millennium settlement in Iranian Baluchestan, was found by Sir Aurel Stein during the early decades of last century. In 1966 Miss Beatrice de Cardi made two small test trenches on the western slope of the site. The cultural material, mainly pottery, suggests a third millennium B.C. settlement, from 2900 to 1900-1800 B.C. The main mound is about 600 x 600 m. with a height c. 4-7 m. higher than the surrounding lands. At the centre of the mound there is a late mediaeval qal"eh dated to the Afsharid period (1750). Twenty-three test trenches have been excavated all around the mound in order to establish the extension of the cultural material and the extension of the main mound. A step trench (A) on the northern slope of the site was dug under the walls of the citadel down to the surrounding land. The excavations of this trench show traces of two platforms of two phases of constructions of qal'eh in the Islamic era, belonging to the Afsharid and Seljuq periods; it seems that under the older citadel there are also traces of a third platform, although the small scale of excavation does not enable us to ascertain this assumption. Almost all the proto-historical and Islamic sections of the mound have been disturbed by the new graveyard during the last three centuries, making it difficult to find untouched surfaces for excavations. Surface surveys showed that the proto-historical section of the site can only be found on the western part of the mound. There is no evidence of the pre-Islamic period in the northern, southern and eastern sections. An examination of the cultural material found in these sections shows different occupations from the Seljuq and Ilkhanid periods, in addition to the more recent periods of the Afsharid up to Qajar ones.</page><page sequence="4">250 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Proto-historical materials are mainly found in small test trench U on the western portion of the site and next to trench Y of Miss de Cardi. In this small test trench, a collection of the pottery fragments of periods Bampur I-IV has been found but, because of the excavation of modern graves, the proto-historical pottery collection was mixed up with the materials of the Islamic period.</page></plain_text>
