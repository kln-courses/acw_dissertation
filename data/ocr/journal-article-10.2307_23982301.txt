<plain_text><page sequence="1">WALTER BENJAMIN ON PHOTOGRAPHY HEINZ W. PUPPE TEXAS A &amp; M UNIVERSITY Walter Benjamin was concerned with photography - its invention and its history - because it represented to him a primary example of the effects of technology on aesthetic perception. He reviewed several books dealing with photography and its history. He wrote «A Short History of Photo graphy» (1931) and discussed photography in connection with problems of aesthetics in a talk before the Institute for the Study of Fascism in Paris in 1934, in «Letter from Paris II» in 193 6, and finally in his most celebrated essay, «The Work of Art in the Era of Mechanical Reproduction» in 1936.' The primary issue in Benjamin's discussions dealing with photography appears in retrospect to be ideological - an annoying fact only too easily ignored. In English language publications serving the art industry, Ben jamin is quoted with increasing frequency. It is evident, ad oculos, that the trade has found another fashionable authority to be cited ipse dixit. Ben jamin's ideological position is largely ignored, however, particularly when his writings are made to serve as a grinding stone for someone's dull ax. His views are now past history - a product of Benjamin the intellectual, but also a product of his times, and one might do well to read him in historic perspective. And yet, even where Benjamin is misread, when his views are taken out of their historic context, and when the purpose of his polemics is obfuscated in the discussion of today's problems in art, one might welcome the current interest in his writings because they raise impertinent but necessary questions.2 Two factors impede the recognition of Benjamin's ideological position. He is not always easy to decode, even in German, because of his idio syncratic style of writing, and because he wrote in an intellectual world under the immediate threat of fascism. The ideological idiom of that world is scarcely comprehensible now without some understanding of the urgent priorities on the historical stage. Benjamin expressed himself quite clearly, however, in the introduction to the essay on «Reproduction». He wanted to introduce, so he wrote, new concepts into aesthetics that would be useless for the purposes of fascism, setting aside traditional con cepts expressed in terms of «creativity», «genius», «eternal values», and «mystery». The association with fascism evoked by such terms may puz2le a non-German reader unfamiliar with the forensic vocabulary</page><page sequence="2">274 Hein^ W. Puppe used by the intellectual left of Germany in the Twenties and Thirties to indict the bourgeois value system. That value system was accepted with in the orbit of western civilization and, to a degree, it still is. Hero wor ship was rampant in the arts as well as in politics and the «creative genius» was accorded the highest honors that state and society could bestow, provided he followed the accepted rules of the game, even in the role of innovator. A creative genius was expected to produce works of high art that bore his unmistakeable stamp - original and unique. Practical ques tions of a technical nature were considered gauche since they detracted inevitably from the stature of the artist as an original genius. And the «original genius» as an effective and functioning concept was inevitably tied to the cult of the individual, to the idea of personal enterprise, and to notions of individual merit. As far as the concepts of eternal values and mystery in art are concerned, it is quite obvious from Benjamin's discussion why these, too, should be deleted from aesthetics as he understood it : eternal values and mys teries have no place in a materialist aesthetic because they are ahistorical concepts. Perception in general, and perception in art and of art in partic ular, are part of a supra-structure subjected to changes in the infra-struc ture of a society, which is to say: changes occur eventually in all cultural areas when economic conditions, conditions of production, undergo significant changes.3 And Benjamin saw in the invention and proliferation of photography just such a significant change - so much so that he attri buted to this invention a revolution in art and aesthetics because photog raphy destroyed the bond that had tied art to cult and ritual, which, in their turn, had produced an aura providing the very life conditions of traditional art and justifying its concomitant aesthetic. The base of the cult of art and artistic stature was the notion that high art could only be attributed to genius and creativity of the artist as an individualist who is more or less inspired mysteriously by the muses, or by some other well-meaning divinity. Benjamin quotes from an article in the Leipziger Stadtan^eiger written at the time the Daguerrotype was first introduced in Germany in 1839 by traveling salesmen from Paris: «A thorough German investigator has proved it to be impossible to fix fleeting mirror images. Moreover, the mere desire to do so is a blasphemy. Man has been created in the image of God, and God's image cannot be fixed by any man-made machine. Only the divine artist, elevated by heavenly inspiration, may dare to reproduce the godlike countenance of man in a moment of the most solemn dedication, commanded by his genius, and without any help from some machine.» Benjamin's biting</page><page sequence="3">Benjamin on Photography 275 comment is : «What reveals itself here is that philistine idea of art in all its ponderous clumsiness which cannot conceive of any technical consid erations in relation to art, and which senses the approach of its own de mise with the provoking appearance of the new technology. »« In «Paris, Capital of the 19th Century», Benjamin identified two effects brought about by the invention of photography: Arago introduces photography in a speech before the Chamber of Deputies (1839). He assigns to it a place in the history of technology... On the other hand artists begin to debate its artistic merits ... Nadar proves to be ahead of other practitioners of photography in his photos of the underground sewer system of Paris. The lens is here used for the first time to make discoveries. The impor tance of this is so great precisely because the subjective component contained in the information in paintings and drawings is felt to be ever more questionable in the light of the new technical and social realities.5 Thus, photography is capable of extending the range of perception and reduces at the same time the individual, which is to say the idiosyncratic, ingredient in the pictorial product. The subjective component in pictorial and graphic information has become highly questionable; this is decisive, since new technical and social realities have made traditional aesthetics obsolete by eliminating the primacy of originality and genius in the evaluation of art products. Obsolete or not, technical and social changes have been too radical to be ideologically acceptable without a struggle. Particularly in the case of photography, the problem of the consequences of technological change has been debated since 1839, and the struggle over the recognition of pho tography as an art has since then spilled over many times into courts of law. There is, after all, a good deal of money involved in addition to points of honor, status, reputation, and the public morals. Benjamin thought that «the fight between painting and photography during the course of the 19th century over the problem of the artistic value of its products seems today misguided and confused» (In 1936!).6 If one looks at the original sources, the dispute over photography as art does not seem quite as muddled as it appeared to Benjamin who was, after all, mostly concerned with driving home his point about the end of traditional aesthetics. One notorious court case in particular well defined the posi tions of two camps in the 19th century in the dispute over whether or not photography, too, was an art. In this case, which dragged through the Paris courts between 1861 and 1862 to the last Court of Appeals, the legal issue at stake was whether the products of photography could be defined as art and thus could be</page><page sequence="4">276 Hein?i W. Puppe claimed to enjoy the protection of the French copyright laws of 1793 and 1810. The proprietors of the photographic portrait factory of Mayer &amp; Pierson in Paris had sued their competitors, the firm of Betbeder &amp; Schwabbe, for damages since Betbeder &amp; Schwabbe had pirated and mass-marketed their portraits of Lord Palmerston and Count Cavour.7 The large sales of photographic portraits were a lucrative business during the latter part of the 19th century, at least until improved printing tech niques permitted the publication of photographs in magazines and news papers. The case of Mayer &amp; Pierson against Betbeder &amp; Schwabbe was therefore a test case of considerable economic importance in the photo business. But the art world of Paris also took an intense interest in the case since it brought to a head the essentially ideological issue of the role of technology in art. This must have been embarrassing to many painters of the day since the use of photographs by painters had already become common practice, so much so that the question for art historians now seems to be not so much whether a particular painter has used photo graphs at all, but rather the extent to which he has used them, even down to the focal length of the camera lens employed in a given case.8 The public controversy over the Mayer &amp; Pierson case breaks down into two basic issues - one involving the question of imitation, precise imitation, of nature constituting an authentic value, the other one con cerning whether the means by which a picture is produced can be an essential factor in its evaluation. This is, of course, phrasing it in modern terms which would not have occurred to Mayer &amp; Pierson's attorney, M. Marie, who argued in his plajdojer before the court : What then is art ? Who will define it ? Who will say where it begins and where it ends ? Who will say : you may go just so far and no further ? I put these questions to philosophers who have dealt with them, and we can read with interest what they have written about art in its different forms. Art, they say, is beauty, and beauty is truth in its material reality. If we see truth in photography and if truth in its outward form charms the eye, how then can it fail to be beauty! And if all the characteristics of art are found there, how can it fail to be art! Well! I protest in the name of philosophy.9 And about the painter who reproduces nature and people and thus has to «copy» nature in a way: «He couldn't be happier than if he were able to imitate exactly, and he would be quite convinced that he had produced a work of art by coming as close as possible to this nature which charms him and which he admires. Is the painter any less of a painter when he reproduces exactly?»10 The court decided in favor of the plaintiffs, con curring with M. Marie's argument that photography is an art. The court</page><page sequence="5">Benjamin on Photography 277 stated that, in its opinion, while photographic pictures are made with the help of an apparatus - «a dark box and under the influence of light» - the imprint of the personality of the photographer is nevertheless very much in evidence because the end result «depends in reproductions of landscapes in a high degree upon the choice of a point of view, the com bination of the effects of light and shadow, and, in the case of portraits, upon the pose of the sitter and the arrangement of clothing and acces sories, all of which completely depends on the artistic feeling of the pho tographer».11 During the fall of 1862, a petition was presented to the court protest ing the decision which had caused considerable consternation in the art community. Many artists felt threatened not so much by the technical apparatus of photography and its products (of which they made ample use themselves), but because they could see only too clearly the erosion of their own ideological position, particularly when they were associated with the school of neo-classicism which was committed to an idealization of reality and beautification for the sake of a higher truth. The petition to the court protesting the opinion rendered in favor of Mayer &amp; Pierson was signed by 27 artists and published in Moniteur de la Photographie (1862 —i863). It read as follows: Whereas, in recent proceedings, the court was obliged to deal with the question of whether photography should be counted as fine art, and its products given the same protection as the works of artists ; whereas photography consists of a series of completely manual operations which no doubt require some skill in the manipulations involved, but never resulting in works which could in any cir cumstances ever be compared with those works which are the fruits of intelli gence and the study of art - on these grounds, the undersigned artists protest against any comparison which might be made between photography and art." This court case is just one example of the level of discussion during the 19th century and illustrates the major concerns of the opponents. But neither party in the dispute over photography as art could see how the orthodox position on art itself, to which they both adhered, had become obsolete. Benjamin identified the radical change this way: The fight between painting and photography during the course of the 19th century over the artistic value of their products seems today misguided and confused. This is not to deny its importance, but quite to the contrary; it might rather emphasize it. Indeed, this fight was the symptom of a revolution of world historic proportions which was not realized by either partner in the dispute. Since the era of mechanical reproduction dissociated art from its grounding in cult, the apparent autonomy of art has disappeared. But the 19th century could</page><page sequence="6">zjS Hein% W. Puppe not see the functional change of the role of art which this implies. The recogni tion of this eluded even the 20th century for quite some time, though it expe rienced the evolution of cinematography.13 Mimesis, as a basis for art, had been one of the most prominent assump tions in aesthetics since Aristotle. When the attorney for Mayer &amp; Pierson, M. Marie, insisted that a photograph is a work of art since it imitates reality with such perfection, he argued well within traditional bounds. The petition protesting the acceptance of photography as art signed by neo-classicists like Ingres and Puvis de Chavannes (the romantic painter Delacroix officially refused to join in this protest) was likewise placed within the parameters of traditional aesthetics. It was taken for granted that art was mimetic, albeit romanticists and neo-classicists insisted that their art demanded a transformation according to their own ideological position. Walter Benjamin thought neither of these two positions valid any longer, because the very conception of mimesis - its production as well as its reception - were variables subject to changes in material condi tions, whether they be social, economic, or technological. The area of human cognition expressed by vocables such as «mimesis», «similarity», and «likeness» is part of that larger concern which has oc cupied philosophers, psychologists, sociologists, and medical pathologists within the larger context of investigations into human perception. Stated somewhat crudely, perhaps, the difference between two major approaches taken in the study of human perception can be identified as the scientific and the philosophic. Within the area of science, human perception is taken as a somatic phenomenon. This is the field staked out by experimental psychology, neuropathology, ophthalmology, etc. ; in short, man is seen here through Gray s Anatomy, where the underlying basic mechanics of perception appear as invariables, at least within human, if not within geological history. The philosophic view, on the other hand, may admit the historic variability of perception, which is the view repeatedly em phasized by Benjamin when he discusses photography and the image of reality it creates. In this connection, it is instructive to see how Benjamin speculated on one fact of human perception of considerable importance both from the scientific and the philosophic point of view; it is the human capacity to recognize likenesses. At the beginning of the 19th century, the panorama, first patented by Robert Barker of Edinburgh in 1787, had gained great popularity in the capitals of Europe, followed by the success of the diorama invented by Bouton and Daguerre in 1812, which had the added attraction of move ment. Both panorama and diorama were designed to produce an imitation</page><page sequence="7">Benjamin on Photography 279 of reality intended to create the most perfect illusion of reality. Pho tography, on the other hand, was invented to reproduce reality with great precision without the engulfing illusionist effects of panorama and dio rama. Photography produced likenesses, not illusions, and the question of likeness in portrait photography has remained a fascinating game of opinions ever since for photographers and consumers alike. Does a portrait &lt;really&gt; look like the sitter? Does it show his &lt;character)? These are essentially questions of perception and of the mimetic capacity of man - the very capacity to perceive likeness, to compare and recognize what is similar and what is not. Walter Benjamin, when he discusses perception (Wahrnehmung and Apperception are his terms), usually sees it tied to historic processes and looks for factors which reveal it to be malleable under physical, technical, or social conditions. In his short essay «On the Mimetic Capacity» he wrote : Nature produces similarities. We merely need to think of mimicry. It is man who has the highest capacity of simulation. The capacity he has to recognize similarity is only a minute remnant of the ancient, powerful compulsion to be come similar, and to imitate. Perhaps man possesses no higher faculty which is not in some way determined by the mimetic capability. But this capability has a history in the phylogenetic as well as in the ontogenetic sense. As far as the latter is concerned, play is in many ways its schooling. The play of children is everywhere influenced by mimetic behavior patterns, and the area involved is by no means confined to those activities in which one human being imitates another. The child does not only play shopkeeper or teacher, but also windmill and choo-choo train. What useful purpose could possibly be served by such a training of the mimetic capability ? The answer presupposes an understanding of the phylogenetic meaning of the mimetic capability. But in this area it is not enough to think only of the concept of similarity in present-day terms. As is well known, the living sphere that appeared to be permeated by the law of similarity in ancient times was all en compassing; it reigned in microcosm and macrocosm alike. But those corres pondences show their real importance only when it is understood that they are, all of them, stimulants and catalysts of that mimetic course of the millennia. One must rather assume that the gift of the ability to produce similarities - the dance, for example, whose oldest function this is - and, thus with it the ability to recognize them, has changed in the course of history.14 Here Benjamin seems to fuse phylogenetics and ontogenetics in an unusual fashion, regarding both as variables. That appears to be quite unacceptable since it would blot out the identifying category distinction marking the very difference between phylogenesis and ontogenesis. Hu</page><page sequence="8">28o Hein^ W. Puppe man perception has as a physical base a neurological servo-mechanism which, at this date, is not completely understood. One may accept this much, however, that the material's neurological structure constituting man's genetic heritage is not subject to the forces of cultural change within historic time. The phylogenetic endowment of man remains constant within a time span counted in mere millennia. As far as human perception is concerned, it seems fairly clear that it is determined by a combination of invariable bio-chemical factors, and by variable cultural factors. These may be ontogenetic, that is, specific to an individual orga nism; or it may be social, that is, specific to a whole social stratum. Ben jamin clearly meant the latter when he wrote of «the phylogenetic mean ing of the mimetic capability». It was a major concern for him to de monstrate with concrete examples how technology provided the impetus for that «revolution of world historic proportions» in the scope and direction of human perception which released the mimetic capability (the capability to create and to recognize similarity) from magic. Wrote Ben jamin: «The elk that man of the Stone Age draws on the walls of his cave is an instrument of magic ... it is meant for the spirits.»15 For an understanding of Benjamin's position in his discussion of the influence of technology in the arts, it is indispensable to recall his own position in time and the polemic character of his remarks and arguments. He was a partisan engaged in a deadly struggle against fascism, and, as an intellectual, he attacked what he considered to be the ideological base of the enemy. (It is difficult, if not impossible, to give here a reasonably brief statement of what that ideological base of fascism was, particularly since the term fascism is now used as a mere invective against all manner of undesirable political phenomena and is nearly useless as a term of defini tion.) In a postscript to his essay «The Work of Art in the Era of Mechan ical Reproduction» Benjamin quotes the famous Futurist Tommaso Marinetti from his manifesto published on the occasion of the colonial war in Ethiopia. It demonstrates with remarkable clarity and emotional appeal how society was not mature enough to use technology as a bene ficial tool, and that technology was not developed sufficiently to channel elementary social energies into a desirable direction. Quotes Benjamin from that notorious manifesto: «War is beautiful because it enriches a flowering meadow with the flaming orchids of machine guns. War is beautiful because it fuses rifle fire, artillery barrages, pauses, perfumes, and odors of putrefaction into a symphony.»16 By this example, Benjamin tries to show both how fascism uses the «aesthetization of politics», and what the inevitable outcome of that exercise has to be. Benjamin evidently</page><page sequence="9">Benjamin on Photography 281 hoped this quote from Marinetti would be self-explanatory. What was, by far, not as self-evident, particularly in Benjamin's time, was his identifica tion of fascist aesthetics with traditional aesthetics made in the introduc tion to that same essay on «Reproduction». Benjamin perceived in his several works of the last decade of his life how the cult of beauty, the cult of genius, the revival of mystery and the propagation of «higher» eternal values by the political machinery in the Nazi Empire in particular had grown on the fertile soil prepared by the bourgeois society of the 19th century. The literature on this subject published in German is already consider able. One might single out, however, one particular analysis dealing with one of the most prominent German philosophers of the 20th century, Martin Heidegger, and that in connection with a topic most relevant in connection with Benjamin's polemics against fascism; it is the issue of technology in modern society. The French Germanist Robert Minder, in an essay entitled «Heidegger and Hebel or The Language of Meßkirch», subjects a publication by Heidegger of 1957 to a thorough and meticu lously documented analysis placing Heidegger's thought firmly within the German anti-rationalist tradition whose bête noir was Descartes, and whose antithesis was the philosophy of the Enlightenment. With Heideg ger, philosophy was indeed tied to cult and ritual - to mystery and eternal values of essences that had nothing in common with those of Goethe. Heidegger's resentment against technology, urbanization, and the age of industrialization was the logical consequence of his ideology.17 In men tioning Heidegger, it should be understood that he has to stand in here for a long line of antagonists who cried their alarum at any intrusion of technological concerns into their particular sanctum. Socrates had his complaints about the invention of writing, and Leonardo da Vinci, from whose notebooks Benjamin liked to quote, mentioned once with irritation how painting was not, as some persons claimed, inferior to singing just because it was produced by means of tools. «If you, o musician, say that painting is a mechanical art because it is performed with the use of hands, you must admit that music is performed with the mouth which is also a human organ. And the mouth is not working in this case for the sense of taste, just as the hands while painting are not working for the sense of touch.»18 The ressentiment against technology does not gain full momentum, however, until well after Rousseau and concurrently with the introduc tion of photography after 1839. ^ a^so to°k different forms and was ex pressed in different degrees of intensity, and it seems to have been most</page><page sequence="10">282 Hein^ W. Puppe pronounced in the German states, which is to say, in those areas of Cen tral Europe where the German language is spoken. With hindsight, one can say this hostile attitude toward the advancement of technology created a condition of explosive conflict. The guardians of ideology, of the «philosophy of life», the academics and the established religions kept right on propagating the simple life - a return to the soil, the peasant as the bed-rock of society, country life as bliss, an acceptance of the eternal mysteries of life, and the glorification of «soul» over reason. And all this, when the German states were rapidly advancing after a late start toward a rigorous rationalization of their economies, toward industrialization and urbanization on a vast scale." Much of German literature of the 19th and even of the early 20th century presents itself as an almost perverse symp tom of ideological retardation. Walter Benjamin's persistent emphasis on the malleability, i. e., the historic variability of human perception, has already been mentioned. No where does he assert, however, that this is the only way in which per ception can be regarded. When he focused his attention particularly on the historic variability of perception, he did so for polemic reasons in times of great peril. It is understandable, therefore, that Benjamin did not dwell at any length on the physiological base of perception. It is, even now, still quite difficult, if not impossible, to make an exact and scien tifically verifiable distinction between variable and invariable modes of perception since the interpretation of all obtainable data is subject to assumptions which tend to tie the interpreter himself into an infinite re gress. There is ample evidence that Benjamin was very much interested in the puzzles of perception and the infinite range of its nature which eludes finite conceptualization, even when he took a strong stand against the conservative (read &lt;fascist&gt;) hierarchy of eternal values. From his perso nal experience with hashish and other drugs, Benjamin knew of the phar macological effects on the perception of space and time, of taste, and touch, and sound, but also of powerful human emotions, when «hashish knows how to persuade nature to release for us the use of our own per sonal being familiar with Love, only to do so less selfishly.»20 That phar macological substances should have such a profound effect on the manner in which the human mind will apperceive should have been seen as an affirmation of materialism, but Benjamin makes very little of it, and that merely in form of a description of purely personal impressions. Elsewhere in his descriptions of perception, Benjamin almost habit ually links what he calls sociological conditions with highly personal impressions which could hardly be generalized since they are idiosyncrat</page><page sequence="11">Benjamin on Photography 283 ic rather than analytic insights. And even where Benjamin discusses pho tographs directly, he gives his feelings free reign. Examples abound where his own pre-knowledge of what he sees in front of him will provide the impetus for his observations. But even where Benjamin's impressionism will strain credulity, he can still come up with sharp identifications of decisive problems which trans cend his own times. One well-known example of Benjamin's impres sionism is his introduction of the term «aura» with its seemingly super erogatory and even gratuitous &lt;definition&gt; : ... the unique apparition of a distance, no matter how close it may be. To gaze in repose at a mountain range in the distance on a summer afternoon, or the branch of a tree casting its shadow on the viewer - that means to inhale the aura of these mountains, of this branch. With this description in mind, it is easy to comprehend the social determinants of the deterioration of the aura in the pre sent. It is based on two circumstances, both related to the increasing importance of the masses in life today ... It is a passionate concern of the masses now to approach things closer physically, and on the &lt;human&gt; level; and the masses have the tendency to overcome the uniqueness of every given thing or event by appropriating it in the form of its reproduction. Day by day the desire asserts itself ever more inexorably to take hold of things and events in closest prox imity in the shape of a picture, or rather, in its reproduction. Reproductions made so readily available in illustrated magazines and newsreels differ un mistakeably from paintings. In a painting, uniqueness and permanence are as much a part of them as is the ephemeral nature and the capacity to be endlessly reproduced are inherent in reproductions ... The destruction of the aura is the symptom of a perception in which the feeling for sameness in the world has grown so much, that it apprehends it through reproductions even in that which is unique.21 It is a little difficult to agree with Benjamin that from his description of a mountain range in the distance and a tree branch against the sky on a lazy summer afternoon it would be «easy to comprehend the social de terminants of the deterioration of the aura». And this talk about «the masses» and their «passionate concern» one might dismiss as dated. But a slight terminological face-lift might show Benjamin's argument to be still well within present-day range. For him, the total change in the function of art as the result of technological advances is essentially identified in negative terms : loss of aura, severing of the links with which art is tied to cult and ritual, the end of the autonomy of art, the loss of uniqueness as a characteristic of the work of art in the age of mass-production of images. The change of the role of art, its production and reception, are then seen as a paradigm, a symptom for the larger changes in society as a</page><page sequence="12">284 Hei nil W. Puppe whole, and these, in turn, are manifested in new ways of perception and manners of thinking. In terms of cultural anthropology, the notion of «aura» is simply the emotional equivalent of a belief in magic, which, when applied to the production of images - pictures representing real objects - is a feeling of awe before the capacity of special individuals - divinely gifted, magically empowered - to reproduce reality on a piece of paper, stone, wood, or the like. After all, in certain cultures it was, and still is, forbidden to make such reproductions of reality, because it would be blasphemous to do so. And where the artistry of producing images of reality was practiced, such practice was awesome, and even more so the more exact, the more precise this reproduction turned out to be. It now takes a mental effort to turn back the clock in one's imganination and conceive of what precision meant in the pre-industrial age. Richard Neutra has given some thought to this important problem and to the question of what precision means in terms of changes in perception: Precision - that is, minimum deviation from the theoretical aim - has at all times been a major human aspiration; in fact,... it has been considered the ob ject of a basic urge. For thousands of years precision of production could only be achieved by laborious methods. Our attitude toward precision has thus been closely linked to the idea of a slow, long, and painstaking process, and ... the quality of precise workmanship has in turn become associated with the charac teristic of rarity, sometimes even of uniqueness ... With the coming of machines, however, the concept of quality has undergone a profound change, as far as our nervous responses are concerned. The productive processes have often be come puzzling, and we can no longer vacariously share in them. The formative background, the genetic perspective, is now blurred and clouded. Our custo mary clues no longer fit. Precision in workmanship meant one thing when the work was done by craftsmen; it means another when it is inhuman, done by strange machines.22 Mechanical precision was first introduced in the munitions industry, which was also one of the first industries to apply methods of mass-pro duction. Projectiles had to fit into gun barrels exactly since the mass consumption of bullets and grenades had to be fool-proof. At the same time, interchangeability became essential to facilitate replacement in in numerable other manufacturing processes as well. And precision is a strict requirement and pre-condition for interchangeability. Tolerance in the manufacture of ball bearings for example, as early as the 1920s, had to be kept within 1/10,000 of an inch. «All this precise workmanship was marshalled to produce not a refrac tor for astronomical use, but a common, almost ubiquitous article. The concept of rarity or uniqueness is as foreign to this new type of precision</page><page sequence="13">Benjamin on Photography 285 as it is to this new type of quality. The entire issue grew into a matter of broad popular impressiveness ; it thoroughly re-educated us and recondi tioned our attitudes. Precision, formerly a luxury, has turned into a pre requisite for economical production and maintenance, because the possible market, the scope of consumption depends on it.»" What is important here is that «the machine introduced an entirely new psychology of pre cision by changing, and sometimes directly reversing, the accents. Thanks to it, irregular, imprecise forms have become unusual, and almost mor bidly attractive.»24 Richard Neutra shows, as much as Walter Benjamin had, that changes in production methods, changes in technology, have radically altered human perception of the world of things even though a severe cultural lag has prevented the conscious acceptance of that change. This cultural lag has produced preposterous inner contradictions which show up in mass-produced consumer items, «custom-made», with a fake appearance of having been made by hand. Where precision was once the sign of the most excellent craftsmanship, it is now associated with ma chine-production and dehumanization. And imperfections are to suggest the human touch. Richard Neutra explains this odd phenomenon in very plausible somato-psychological terms: «We seem physiologically made to see things in a genetic time perspective. Moreover, we unconsciously look at things as if they had been produced by a human maker ; we tend to sense at work a creative being with nervous equipment and behavior similar to those of man. This naive, anthropomorphic attitude is natural. It, too, is physiologically determined, because any creative experiences that we can possibly have ourselves are correlated with our own nervous reactions, such as accompany our labors to produce a thing. »25 Applied to photography one can see how the comprehension of images has shifted since the invention of the picture-making machine. The viewer can identify with the manipulations by which a painting, a drawing, a carving or an etching has been produced; and the greater the precision of the rendition, the greater is the respect for the maker. Most importantly, picture-making was human, no matter how mysterious was its product. But with the photographic process, the naive anthropomorphic attitude be comes impossible and another attitude takes its place : the viewer appre hends the image as objective and truthful since the subjective interpreta tion of the human producer is eliminated. (This applies, of course, only to photographs not manipulated like those of Moholy-Nagy, or Man Ray). Benjamin thought that «photography ... demonstrates the difference be tween technology and magic as a thoroughly historic variable»,26 but in his descriptions of photographs, he makes very personal and impressionis</page><page sequence="14">286 Hein% W. Puppe tic observations, expressing a feeling for that kind of magic which appre hends photographs as isomorphic with real time and real space. He writes : In painted portraits, the person himself, the sitter is forgotten after two or three generations and what remains is the interest in the painting itself as evidence of the skill of the artist. In photography, one encounters something new and pe culiar: in that fisher-woman from New Haven, her eyes downcast with such casual and seductive modesty, there remains something that does not fuse into the document of art of the photographer [David Octavio] Hill, something that cannot be silenced, something that inquires roughly and demandingly the name of that woman who had lived there and who is still real, even present right here, and who will never melt completely into Art ... The most precise technology can endow its products with a magical value which no painted picture can have for us ever again.27 It is Benjamin's use of the terms «magie» and «aura» which is confusing at times, since the distinction, if there is any, is obscure. But if Benjamin can be faulted for inconsistencies, in his treatment of photography and photographers he has been painstakingly consistent in linking directly to historic variables explicable in technical terms whatever feelings and emo tions, aura or magic, he discovered in his impressions. Speaking of early photographs of people, he says : «There was an aura about them, an air (ein Medium) that gives their gaze that richness and security as it pene trates it. And again, the technical equivalent is obvious ; it consists in the absolute continuum of brightest light to darkest shade. »28 This continuum of light was supposed to be a result of the long time exposures necessary in early photography, which again was proof to Benjamin of the techni cal condition on which the auratic phenomenon depends. Benjamin was mistaken here, of course. Professional technical knowl edge, knowledge of cameras, lenses, chemical processes, was not within his competence to discuss. Long time exposures in portrait photography, for example, were no longer necessary after the construction of the Petz val lens and its manufacture by Voigtländer since 1841. And that conti nuum of light he so much admired in early photographs - it has no mystery about it. It is a criterion of quality in photography today as it was in 1850, and it is the result of skill, control, and taste - one possible proof of the professional competence of the photographer. Benjamin may be faulted on technical grounds for inconsistencies in his discussions and for poetic ambiguities, as well as for a disregard of the physiological constants of perception. But he retains an important posi tion in the history of the analysis of perception for his insights into the so cial significance of photography, and the concatenations of modes of per</page><page sequence="15">Benjamin on Photography 287 ception with the world of affairs. He was well aware of the necessity of a two-pronged research into perception, and he set his accents where the times demanded it. In 1938 he wrote: «Whether sensual perception of man is not only determined by natural constants but also by historic variables - that is one of the most advanced questions in research, where every answer, every inch of ground has to be gained in hard struggles.»29 It is this basic attitude which informed his judgments of those photogra phers which he discussed, and which set the tenor of his polemics against a «botched reception of technology». He praised the early Daguerreo typists, as well as Nadar, Hill, and finally, Eugène Atget and August Sander for desentimentalizing the objective world which had been dipped into aesthetic syrup. And he faulted the photographers of the school of «New Objectivity» (Neue Sachlichkeit) of the late 20s and early 30s for the misuse of objectivity in spite of a cooled down rendition of the world in their pictures. In «The Author as Producer», Benjamin wrote: I would like to begin my discussion of the New Objectivity with the assertion that supplying the machinery of production without changing it is highly ob jectionable even when the materials with which this machinery is being supplied appears to be revolutionary. We are faced with the fact (the last decade in Ger many has given us plenty of proof for that) that the bourgeois machinery of production and publication can assimilate an amazing amount of revolutionary themes, and even propagate it without seriously threatening its own substance and the security of the class which owns and controls it... I assert furthermore, that a substantial part of that literature of the left had no other social function than to utilize the political situation for obtaining ever new effects for the enter tainment of the public ... And let us now trace the development of photography further. What do we see ? It is becoming ever more subtle, ever more modern, and the result is that it cannot photograph any housing project, any garbage dump without glorifying it.30 Photographs are never inert objects rendering reality obejctively - reality as the thing in itself - but always meet the viewer in a context of signifi cation. Benjamin identified that signification for a number of photogra phers of his time in specific categories. Eugene Atget demystified Paris and its environs, August Sander demonstrated in his portrait collection of German people the physiognomy of social classes, Karl Bloßfeldt served a specific scientific purpose in revealing the universality and natu ral origin of architectural structures in his close-up photographs of plants. If photography loses its grounding in such specific categories of significa tion - if it loses its function as a mode of discovery, its function as a modifier of perception - then it becomes what Benjamin calls «creative» in a pejorative sense.</page><page sequence="16">288 Heinz W' PuPPe The lens is then used to produce a &lt;synthesis&gt; ; the photographic Schmock enters upon the stage ... The more the crisis of the present social order spreads, and the more rigidly its fragmented components confront each other in dead oppo sition, the more has creativity become a fetish, which owes its existence to mere changes in fashionable lighting effects. Creativity in photography is its surren der to fashion. The World is Beautiful - exactly that is its motto. Here is un masked the posturing of that kind of photography that can pompously glorify any garbage can, but is unable to grasp the human contexts in which it may occur. This photography promotes the market value of even the most dreamy and forlorn subject matter far more than it contributes to any increase in knowledge about it.31 This quote comes from Benjamin's essay «A Short History of Photog raphy», which was first published in three installments in the periodical Literarische Welt in the Fall of 1931. The time and circumstances under which Benjamin published this essay are of some interest, because the photo book he criticized without mentioning the author's name was the first photographic bestseller in German, The World is Beautiful, by the highly respected photographer and representative of the New Objectivity, Albert Renger-Patsch, who was also associated with the Folkwang Mu seum in Essen.32 This book was important enough to be reviewed in Berliner Illustrirte in 1928 by Thomas Mann - and in glowing terms. Mann had this to say about technology and art : Photographs -1 know of the resistance of prudishness in the humanities which this word provokes, but I do not share it. I do understand the dignified protest of cultural conservatives and opponents of technology against the admission of photography into the realm of Spirit and Art. But in practical terms I have litde inclination to join that protest. I even take the opportunity to confess to a lack of prejudice on this point which borders on apostacy. Intrusion of technology into art - surely, that sounds bad, it smacks of decadence and destruction of the soul. But could it not be that technology, while the soul succumbs to it - that technology gains a soul?33 One cannot help but admire Benjamin's audacity in taking on Thomas Mann by characterizing Renger-Patsch as a photographic Schmock, when Mann had praised him: «It is Renger-Patsch in Bad Harzburg, a master, ... devoted to the visual with that exact love and determined tenderness known only to the heart of an artist.»34 But this attack on Renger-Patsch and Thomas Mann's judgment would be no more than an anecdote, if the issue that concerned Walter Benjamin so much during the last decade of his life had not proved to be so tenaciously topical nearly 40 years later. What mattered to Benjamin was that photography had to be a means to an end, a means for discovery, to create new modes of perception, to reveal</page><page sequence="17">Benjamin on Photography 289 the factors that make the facts. And the priority for him was unequivo cally the uncovering of the brutal realities of the social and political order of his day. What matters in photography is the product. Does it serve its purpose ? Does it reform consciousness ? To fault the maker of images for his tools, the painter for using brushes, the writer for using a typewriter, would seem absurd. A moral issue is involved in the categorical impera tive that no man should use another merely as a means to an end. But the means by which a picture is obtained is not such a moral issue, and a cam era has no essence. Better to remember what Vespasian quipped about tax revenues : non olet. And while the camera has no essence of its own, it cannot perform miracles, particularly the miracle of objective rendition of reality. Surely, the camera cannot tell a lie, but that is so because it cannot speak at all. Moreover, it can only perform, but it is made to perform by man. Its end-product is a result of efforts and judgments by many people, the last of whom is the photographer - and often not even he but the printmaker who is the last in the chain. In other words : the photograph is, horrors of horrors, a collective product. Walter Benjamin saw in his time probably better than anyone (with the exception of Bert Brecht) the revolution that had been effected by the in vention of photography. But he also saw already that this revolution which transformed the arts would be resisted in the marketplace. The art industry has appropriated photography as an art. Agents, publishers, and museum directors are promoting it, and only art historians are still strenuously ignoring photography. But that is bound to change. The photographic Schmock seems to win the day; photographs by well publicized photo artists have become lucrative investments, and prices are rising. And yet, while the photographic art market is rapidly expanding and commercial galleries specializing in photography are multiplying in the U. S., Europe, and Japan, photography extends its influence on percep tion far beyond the relatively confined area of a jaded art public. Photog raphy as art is just one relatively minor aspect of photography. It is of all-pervasive social and historic importance now, and Walter Benjamin's observations forty years after his obscure death are gaining in importance when the political and social contexts recede into a past that is itself re membered through its photos.
