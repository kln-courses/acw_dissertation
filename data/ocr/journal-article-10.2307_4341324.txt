IX) Many who have made sacred, secular, or utterly curious pilgrimages to Delphi have doubtless felt that in the very majesty of the place deity is proclaimed. And I have come to wonder whether there is not some relation between the beauty and grandeur of theatre sites and the beauty and grandeur of Greek tragedy, to wonder whether the physical and spiritual environment was not a challenge and an inspiration to the dramatists. It is with sympathetic interest, therefore, that I have read the exposition of Paula Philippson in which, in orderly scientific fashion, she has identified Greek dei- ties with their landscapes by submitting effective word pictures and a number of excellent, even awesome, photographs together with further elucidation from shifted myth and ritual and from literature. Having observed on the sites of many Greek cults that rot the temple merely, not the precinct alone is the embodiment of holiness, but that the whole land- scape is Gott-erfiillt, the author first poses a question: Does the association of a divinity with the landscape of his cult indicate the essential relationship of the god</page><page sequence="2">CLASSICAL WEEKLY 69 with the landscape; that is, does the essence of the god or at least a phase of it appear in the character of the landscape? This question she answers in the affirmative. Through the spell which streams upon us from myths, from Homeric poems, and from representations of Greek art, we have accustomed ouirselves quite ex- clusively, she reminds us, to the anthropomorphic aspect of Greek deities. But in the cult landscape it would be possible to recognize the direct manifestation of God's revelation to man without the intervention of human speech or the art of portraiture. For it would be char- acteristic of this manifestation that man entering the landscape should sense divinity in it. Paula Philippson's method may be set forth by a summary of her treatment of Apollo at Delphi (5-IO). Following the story made familiar by the Homeric Hymnl to Apollo, she notes that Delos was the birth- place of Apollo, rugged Delos, which Leto had vowed among all places should be dear to her son.1 The cult of Apollo became established at Delphi, she reasons, not because people there confined the god within the landscape by erecting a temple to him, but because he himself, wandering from landscape to landscape in search of an appropriate spot, selected the slopes of Parnassus plunging precipitously into the depths, no favorable tract for a temple. Only on the steep zigzag- ging way is there an entrance to it, but out of a multi- tude of landscapes the god selected for himself (or shall we say found himself in?) this one with which should be associated for all time his name, his nature and his cult. In truly inspired diction supported by three superb photographs are described the huge oval valley and the mountain wall with its two projecting peaks on the north which, with a fearful ruggedness, isolate the sacred temenos that lies upon the slope. Herein are the manifestations of deity: Silence, Grandeur, Remoteness, but remoteness that gives a sense of centrality and radiation. Silence lies even today (0939!) over the Delphic landscape; even today silence comes over one who enters it, whether from the north or from Amphissa. This mountain-enclosed fastness is the junction for north, central and south Greece, the navel of the Greek world if not of the earth as Strabo has recorded (9.4I9). Despite its remoteness the dis- tance,s seem drawn together so that the isolation gives the effect not of solitude but of a self-contained center of the world. Above all and in all and through all is consummate Light clear and pure (KIarheit und Reinheit). The shimmering peaks glow at sunset with reddish light. When the sun has set, the gray stone stares in sinister pallor. The bright, almost "rational" building up of the landscape takes the shape of a room. In this land- scape-room built in light Apollo reigns as god of Light and of Order, in a cleamess and purity that cleanse the blood-stained fugitive. "Er ist in dieser Landschaft; diese Landschaft ist er" (9). Only a fairly small ledge of this sublime landscape is devoted to the sacred temenos with its temple, from the terraces of which may be obtained a broad view of the site east and west. But the inner depths of the ancient cavern of the Python are not visible from it, and the little block of stone, a fissure in which was once an Earth oracle, is an almost insignificant relic. For Apollo was not originally a chthonic deity. When he took over Delphi and its powers, Themis the child of Earth was driven out, and her mother outwitted, even as is rehearsed in the ritual hymn of the Chorus in Euripides' Iphigenia among the Taurians (1259ff.). Apollo ruled supreme. Chthonic elements native to the site were greatly reduced; their influence lingered in the oracle, but Apollo remained personally unap- proachable, speaking only through the lips of his priestess. R. D. Miller, having discussed the cults of Apollo under fifteen aspects, in a more orthodox review of literary and epigrammatic sources, agrees in the con- clusion that Apollo "was not a chthonic deity but a deity of the sky," in the sense that he was a "high god." He argues, however (not altogether convincingly, it seems to me, considering the ubiquitous 'ou3os), that Apollo was primarily not a god of light but a "master of animals," a "god of the chase," the "averter of evil" (op. cit- 50-3)- Boeotia, in contrast to Delphi, represents a com- pound of chthonic and Apolline prophecy with the chthonic character predominating. The dark heavy soil of Boeotia is rich and fertile, but the land is swampy, hence the air less transparent than at Delphi. At Lebadeia where the fertile soil meets the desolate mountains is the chasm that was the seat of the oracle of the Boeotian daimon Trophonios whose ceremony Jane Harrison stamps as "almost grotesquely primitive" (Themis, 282). Dr. Philippson marks that Trophonios through his name relates himself to the fruitfulness of the soil (II-7). She analyzes the myths and rites in which he is associated with Demeter Europa and Kore. Illustrat- ing the photographs from the site the vivid account of Pausanias (9.39), who says that he himself consulted the oracle, she reviews the strange ceremonial: the bath in the river Herkyna; the drafts from two springs, from Lethe that the past might be forgotten, from Mnemo- 1 R. D. Miller in a University of Pennsylvania dissertation entitled The Origin and Original Nature of Apollo, published in 1939 (the same year as Dr. Philippson's monograph), main- tains that this "family relationship" is an Asiatic "fiction," and that the worship of Apollo came to Delphi (as to Delos) from south-central Europe beyond the Balkan mountains of Thrace and Macedonia (23f., 64f.).

DeWitt in CW 34 (I940-I) 225.</page><page sequence="3">70 CLASSICAL WEEKLY syne that the revelation might be remembered; the descent of the consultant into the chasm in the dark- ness of night, through a hole feet first, to be whirled away into a vision and sent back unconscious. The conclusion is that in name, myth and cult Trophonios embodies the total aspect of Boeotia. Through his name he is connected with the fertile low- lands, through his cult and its location, with rugged mountains that surround the landscape. There is no dichotomy between essence and embodiment, between deity and nature. The very contradictions are common to daimon and landscape: clemency, fertility, terror; mysterious depths; sudden appearance and disappear- ance. Trophonios is, in effect, Boeotia in epiphany, mild, rich, voluptuous, yet demoniacal. In a following chapter on the struggle between chthonic and Apolline mantic in Boeotia (I8-23), Trophonios is not merely related to Asklepios as in Pausanias (9.39.3-4), but is completely identified with him. He is not Asklepios as son of Apollo, however, as in Pausanias,2 but the Thessalian chthonic Asklepios whose oldest place of worship was located on the banks of the river Letheios-"er selbst ist urspriinglich dieser . . . Asklepios" (22). The "proof" rests largely upon geographic and etymological grounds: The god ob- viously had led the Boeotians to settle in the fertile, mountain-enclosed country which later bore their name. With its abundant grain, its lakes and swamps and huge surrounding mountains, it may have reminded them of their Thessalian home, and a spring at the edge of Mt. Laphystius may have been named Lethe in pious remembrance of the Thessalian Letheios. It may be, the writer concedes, that before the arrival of the Greeks a native daimon inhabited the cavern, whose name sounded like Trophonios or Trephonios (a Boeotian form). His chthonic relationships might have caused his name to become attached to Asklepios as a cult title which later became separated. Howsoever it be, demonry thwarted the Olympians at Lebadeia. As to the oracle on the Ptoon Mountains (24-30), though in historical times Apollo was its lord, one has only to question the landscape to discover that he was not the original lord of this valley. That was the hero Ptoos, who was to become in myth the son of Apollo and the chthonic Zeuxippe.3 Apollo seems eventually to have assumed his name, and in this instance possibly approximated his mantic. Thus in the cults and mantic of Boeotia are recon- ciled the two realms of the divine: the chthonic aspect of the world and spiritual light. It is by no chance that it was Hesiod the Boeotian who produced the Theogony recounting the struggle of an old and a new theocracy. 2 The reference IX.34.4 in the footnotes (23) is apparently an error for IX.39.4. 3 But see Roscher, Lexikon der griechischen und romischen Mythologie 5, under Themisto. The method of treatment of other divinities is similar throughout: physical features of the landscape are de- termined; myths, ritual and etymology are examined; and the consubstantiation effected. Was Apollo at Delos (3I-9), a relatively unimport- ant isle, because the physical nature of Delos is appro- priate to the god? It exhibits the same features as does Delphi: Radiant Light; Stillness, the Isolation of cen- trality; rugged Wildness, in the unyielding granite blocks of Kynthos-"und wild starren die L6wen auf den kreisrunden See" (39). Nothing dark and lurid characterizes the site, nothing chthonic: there was once no oracle at Delos, and never a sacrifice without music and the dance. So the Delian landscape, supporting evi- dence from myth and cult, manifests Apollo's varied qualities and contrasting aspects: the radiance at times is offset by an eerie heaviness; a sense of graceful musical youth by rugged bulk; and the very loneliness yields a sense of power that draws in the world, for the cult center is located at the intersection of far-reaching tension lines, materially embodied as trade routes and lines of political power but ultimately centering in the Delian god and his spiritual influence (32, 39). Over the Argolid, naturally, ranges the watchful eye of Hera Argeia (40-52). The topography of Argos shows three zones: (i) nearest to the mountains where the Heraion is located, a sloping; rocky, waterless region of little fertility; (2) the plains, with soil of clay; (3) a belt of swamps and lagoons along the coast. Enclos- ing mountains are of moderate height, green in spring, brown, arid, prairie-like in summer. There is nothing mysterious or exciting in this landscape either in form or in fruitfulness, but it bears an essential relationship to Hera. (In this interpretation may be detected sal et fel, but certainly not mel!) Hera is not, like Demeter, a motherly goddess. Only gradually, it seems, has Hebe become a separate entity as her daughter. There is some indication in her cult that in early times Hera may have been a warlike tribal deity. "Motherliness" par excellence is manifested by De- meter (53-63) in myth, ritual and landscape. The original epiklesis is preserved in her name, "De! Meter!" Without Kore she withers away and lets everything else wither; together with Kore-Persephone she participates in the mysterious depths of life and death. As Demeter Europa she imparts fertility to Boeotian lands, where, despite the intermediate figure of Trophonios, she is the dominant divinity of the land- scape. In Sicily even before the arrival of the Greeks a Demeter-like goddess was worshipped. Revealed in the landscape, this deity was later clothed by the Greeks in Demetrian myth. Her cult centers at Enna, the very middle of this landscape which, like Segesta for Goethe. lies "in trauriger Fruchtbarkeit" (6o). Thera, too, is an appropriate site for Demeter and Kore, with a land- scape combining chthonic terror and mild fertility.</page><page sequence="4">CLASSICAL WEEKLY 71 They are worshipped in a cave on the only mountain of the island from which are visible both the rugged cliffs and the friendly slopes of orchard and vineyard beyond the flooded craters. Nemesis of Rhamnus, it appears (64-72), cannot have been originally a cruel, savage goddess of revenge, for the location of her temple is characterized by a striking lack of ruggedness, eerieness and wildness. Her association with Themis-Gaia points to a chthonic character. On etymological grounds (*vEpr) she may have been primarily a pastoral divinity. Athena in Attica (73-9) finds her appropriate sphere in a well-ordered plain, open to the sea on one side, otherwise surrounded by mountains, and subdivided by two small streams and a few stray hills, a landscape measured and disciplined. Through association with Zeus she has incorporated his worldwide greatness and insight which are characterized in the Attic landscape by its openness and by the clear dry atmosphere that draws contours sharp. Zeus of Dodona (80-3) consorts not with Hera but with the Earth-Mother under the name of Dione. They are manifested in Epirus by Mt. Tomaros, a tremendous mountain, and the wide fertile valley adjoining. The mountain, which is usually bathed in sunlight, may become dark and threatening during thunderstorms. Here rules guEyas Zcv'g in universal power which includes universal knowledge. Hence the oracle was maintained. Dr. Philippson's general conclusion is that in Greek religion natural phenomena are not endowed with a divine quality through their relation to a creator mani- festing himself in them. The mount of Dodona, for example, is not an act of Zeus; it is Zeus, for the world as phenomenon is in its own essence holy and divine. There may be some readers who will not be able to square with the scientific method so active an imagina- tion and a tendency to wordiness and sentimentality. Others may find the intricacies of myth, ritual and mysticism somewhat vague and involved. Students of religion will question certain conclusions, may not find, for instance, that the complete identification of Troph- onios with Asklepios is convincing, or that Nemesis is in character as a protector of pastures. But when due allowance has been made for individual opinion and prejudice, the main premise of the monograph remains very appealing, and the sequences are logical. In par- ticular, they to whom it has been given to know the mysteries will understand. E. H. BREWSTER SWARTHMORE COLLEGE</page></plain_text>
