<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jane Teller's Sculpture and Drawings: Powerful Presences in the "Big Rhythm" GERI DePAOLI Similar to what one feels in the presence of such prehistoric structures as those at Stonehenge, Easter Island, and Malta, it is difficult to believe that Jane Teller's monumental wooden sculptures could have been made without the aid of some mysterious force. Once this artist begins to speak and to look with her expressive and penetrating glance, one feels a force of will and a sense of kinship with those architects and sculptors of ancient times. Indeed, she strives for a connection and says she wants "to build a bridge to the great, anonymous, prehistoric builders."' Her work can be described as mystical, atavistic, elemental, spiritual, and transcendental. Her travels to primitive sites, beginning in 1930 to Stonehenge and elsewhere in England, to the American Southwest in 1935, and to Mexico and Nova Scotia in 1937, and later Italy, Israel, Greece (Corfu), Japan, and in 1984 to Malta (and Gozo), have helped form her attitudes and expectations about art and the role of an artist. Many 20th-century artists have been important to Teller, among them sculptors Giacometti, Noguchi, and Brancusi, painters Pollock, Kline, and Pousette-Dart; she also has a fondness for Bosch and Piranesi. Teller admits freely to influences: As [the archeologist] Schliemann discovered, cities are built on cities. So is art built. Although artists like to think they are doing something "new," they cannot; for everything is, finally, related to something else, built on something else. Also important to Teller's world view have been her investigations of ideas from Existentialism and Zen, Freud and Jung, ideas she has explored with many of the artists whose vision she shares. Jane Simon was born on July 5, 1911, in Rochester, New York, the first of two children (she has a younger brother). Her father, Joseph, was president of a wood molding and frame company, where, as a child, Jane spent time drawing, painting, and playing with wood as she watched the artisans working. Her father often took her to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to see the art as well as the carved wooden frames. Although he died when Jane was 14 years old, he was a strong, formative influence. Her mother, Florence (nee Miller), often shared with her feelings of connec- tion to a sister citizen of Rochester, Susan B. Anthony. .. . .... ...

Florence Simon was interested in community service work with the blind and the Red Cross and, like Mary Cassatt's mother (and, to be sure, countless others), she saw her daughter's desire to create art as a "nice hobby." Jane studied art first at the Mechanics Institute (now the Rochester Institute of Technology), Skidmore College, and then Barnard College, where, in 1933, she received her B.A. That same year she married Walter Teller, a friend from her teens who was then a graduate student in English literature. He is now a writer, the author or editor of a dozen books of "Americana." She regards him as a most valuable critic and ardent supporter. The young couple began married life in New York City, where, in 1934, Jane worked for the Theatre Workshop publication while continuing to draw and sculpt. At this time she met photographer Aaron</page><page sequence="2">Woman's Art Journal 29 Ail o I ; /b I'.?, Fig. 2. Jane Teller, Round Wall (1961), walnut, 19" x 22" x 20". Collection of Artist. Photo: Werner Goodwin. Siskind, who became a profound influence and lifelong friend: Aaron taught me much about "seeing," about the relationship between reality and appearance, transfor- mations and abstraction. He didn't spell it out but put me into the position to "see." Aaron's transformation of an object, abstracting it, led me to think and work abstractly; to see and embrace the magic. A realistic image seemed simplistic, devoid of all the possibilities. In 1935 Jane Teller enrolled in WPA classes where she worked with clay, stone, and wood under the direction of Aaron Goodelman and Karl Nielson. Wood became her preferred material when in 1936 the Tellers bought an old Pennsylvania Dutch farmhouse in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where Jane's first studio was a colonial log cabin. The couple moved from the city because they had the desire to raise a family in the country. Their four sons were born between 1938 and 1945.2 Teller continued to work, managing to produce at least one sculpture each year. As with many women artists raising children, the creative spirit found many manifestations: "I was frustrated by lack of time for work, so after some study of methods and theories of early childhood education, I started an all-day cooperative nursery school/kindergarten in Doyles- town and designed and made equipment for it." She continued to keep in touch with the New York art world and in 1947, at the Egan Gallery, she was introduced by Siskind to the work of the New York School of painters. She still recalls her excitement: "There was a power or force that came from the work; it had spirit; it was just the same when I saw an exhibition of African Sculpture in the thirties. I was zonked by it." Brancusi and Giacometti also were especially compelling influences during the 1940s. From Brancusi she "learned to absorb the primitive and to transport it into a contemporary mode... .I felt a real kinship especially in his wooden pieces. There was a hand I was related to." Giacometti, she says, "has a spiritual quality and energy sympathetic to me. I am deeply moved by his work." Teller was responding to both the spiritual content and the physical presence of this art. She remembers in 1951 "catching the spirit" when sculptor Ibram Lassaw, while demonstrating his welding technique, guided her hand and spoke of Zen and the application of his understanding of it in his contact with the flowing metal. Teller subsequently made a series of sculptures combining wood and metal. In 1964 the Tellers moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where they still live. Since then Jane has taught adult education classes, worked for a period of time as an art therapist, lectured on her own work and concepts of modern art, and continued to create works of art and exhibit widely. Her first one-woman exhibition was in 1949, at the Callanan Gallery, New Hope, Pennsyl- vania. Her first solo New York show was in 1957, at the Parma Gallery; it was followed by a group show of gallery artists. During the past 25 years she has had more than 50 solo and group shows.3 In 1984, after suffering a stroke and losing the use of her left arm, Teller turned the full force of her energy and spirit to drawing. She continues to work in her studio, visit exhibitions, and inspire a community of artists. In 1986 she collaborated with choreographer Paulette Sears in producing a performance piece at the Princeton Art Association. Using her own narration and slides of her work combined with dance, she made her sculptures come to life, relating them to the primitive sites that inspired them. She also shared her ideas about the "Great Goddess," an interest that began after a 1984 trip to Malta. In April of 1987, a retrospective exhibition of Teller's ...... .. . ... Fig. 3.

Her most comprehensive exhibit to date, it revealed the range of her work and its articulate visual language. THE ARTIST'S PROCESS AND PRODUCT Teller's works possess a "thundering peace." A sense of energy, inner turmoil, and struggle resolves into a harmonious form resting in the environment, waiting to be touched and to give stimulus, comfort, and excitement to the viewer. The works deal with surface, form, and space in dynamic equilibrium, a combination she refers to as a "yin-yang balance." The entire body of work has a sense of wholeness, a union of spirit and matter. Teller thinks of the artist as a "medium" or "seer": "It is a continuing wonder to me that my sculpture, when it works best, transforms itself somewhere in the process of its manufacture into a universally expe- rienced expression or a human kinesthetic rhythm," she explains. "If if am in tune with natural rhythms, it is they-not I-that effect the transformation. I only recognize it when it occurs." She has given some clues to the mystery and evolution of her creativity: Early works were conceived as landscape or an element in the landscape. Later work became totally abstract and directed toward expression of the Energy in the Continuum. Early works are more active, emphasizing thrust and structure. Later, in a more meditative mood, "Zen," I felt a certain calm, though also an inner energy. When wood is harvested it is often dead or in the process of decaying. When I use it for a sculpture I give it new form, and I like to think I am giving it new life. I am dealing with elusive stuffl. Mysterious stuff-- energy. And I concentrate on getting it into my work. When I start a sculpture I have a lot of belief and no plan at all. I will have selected pieces of wood that appeal to me that day-and they lie all over the floor. I shift them about until that "wonder moment" when particular pieces, put in particular juxtapositions, take on life. They seem not to exist separately. Their expression depends on just how one piece of wood touches another, at a teetering point or solidly balanced, [they can be] in a multitude of stances that mirror the physical or affective states of a human being. It is these connections, established in the making of a sculpture, that transmit its ultimate expression, its energy. They carry a kinesthetic charge. All this happens when, and only when I am swinging ... swinging with the Big Rhythm ... in touch with its energy. It is then that those connections echo some facet of the Continuum. Teller's earliest extant work is The Philosopher (also called The Old Man), from the early 1940s, a monolithic wood piece worked with hand tools to reveal the form within-perhaps an homage to Giacometti. Totems from the American Southwest, African sculpture, her experiences at primitive sites, contemporary artists' works-all have been part of the evolutionary path in her work. She has proceeded from the use of monolithic pieces, to the random grouping of pieces on a base, to the stacking of pieces to form a whole resting in an environment. "Stacking," for Teller, "is another 'state of being.' It appears in totems and in walls, which can be thought of as more complex totems. Stacking is building and is a very early act, fundamental in human behavior. It feels good to build because balance is involved, and balance is kinesthetically satisfying." Teller does not go to lumber yards in search of wood; nor does she cut down trees. She "finds" her wood around her, wherever she is living; she recognizes a spirit in the wood she chooses, and then gives the "dead" wood new life. The Grove (1952; Fig. 1) speaks of the influence of Giacometti. The tall slender ash wood forms stand as individuals and as a group. They do not touch, but are linked by energy-charged space. They evoke an association with a forest of trees or a crowd of people. The surfaces, smooth on the wood, grainy and rugged on the stone base, enhance one another. The combi- nation stimulates the tactile sense in the viewer. There is variety in sameness, with every upright element slightly different from its neighbor. Five Forms (1953), a small (8" x 24" x 17") horizontal piece in wood and cast stone, continued concerns with the tension of spaces between forms explored in The Grove. A group of five forms, which at first glance resemble tree stumps that have been narrowed where they arise from the earth, stand in a staggered row. Part of each piece is carved away to reveal a spiral grain; part of the bark is left in place. The piece incorporates the essence of growing, birth, life, and death. The placement in space, the variety in sameness, and the sense of presence calls to mind that icon of Chinese Ch'an (Zen) painting, Six Persimmons, by the Sung monk Mu-Ch'i.4 By 1961, with Round Wall (Fig. 2), Teller eliminated the base. She had struggled for years for unity within the sculpture as well as unity with the environment. She eventually decided on ground-based pieces. In Round Wall each piece of walnut, worked on a band saw, has been fitted together, balanced, and held as if by energy. It suggests process and potential for movement, pent up force. One's visual expectations encounter paradoxical wooden rocks and soft stones, which are not gray but the color of warm walnut. There is the feeling that with a slight shock, these rocks will rearrange themselves or create a landslide. Each position as one moves around the work creates a whole new shape. In The Grove, Five Forms, and Round Wall, Teller's forms referred to nature, but Open Wall (see back cover), marks her transition to symbolic, universal, or elemental form. It is also an example of the sculptor's "stacking" technique. Teller gives clues to the symbolic language used here: Circle = a personal metaphor for wholeness, the feminine, seed or sun; arc = moon; linked forms = continuity; circle and post = sex; walls = barriers (if open = ways through); totemic = anthropomorphic associations. In Open Wall there is a harmony of dark and light wood, square and round shapes, linking forms, spirit and matter. The wood is alternatively light and dark, the forms are made of the material and the space inside and around them; the whole gives the sense that it will go on in a continuous repetition of the pattern, in congruence with the patterns of nature. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Teller explored</page><page sequence="4">Woman's Art Journal 31 further variations on the themes of stacking, building, and balancing, using her symbolic language to create presences that are "states of being," using her visual language to create spaces, shapes, and patterns to connect the viewer to an inner recognition of a life energy. Celebration Totem (1978), a towering (95" x 42" x 39") totem of maple, oak, beech, and hemlock, continues her evolution from natural references to the elemental, symbolic. The circle, cylinder, and crescent forms are stacked, one on the other; here is pure organic geometry. The visual effect of the surfaces, where the mark of the artist is everywhere evident, adds to the mystery; light plays and the surface is at once solid, dissolving, and moving. In the presence of Arch (1982; Fig. 3) one is transported to a mysterious precinct. The poplar, pine, and oak forms draw across space, creating an entrance. Although smaller than human scale, it appears monumental. At once whimsical and mystical, it produces responses of awe and wonder. Here, too, the marks of the artist on the wood bring the "dead" material to life. There is also the sense of the pleasure of building, as well as a balance, rhythm, and gesture in the graceful manner in which the lintel is joined to the uprights. The Arch rests in place yet there is still a potential for movement or continuous extension into space. The artist, using the tools of the woodworking trade, has created these monumental works alone in her studio. Many of the pieces are set up in her home or the surrounding land, where they have merged with nature. Others are taken apart and stored, their joinings carefully marked for quick reassemblage and display. Line in Teller's drawings is as dynamically alive as her chisel marks. Drawings from the 1960s and 1970s were done close up from tree bark. She coaxed images from the crevices and spaces in the bark, working with the idea of metamorphosis and the poetics of space. After her return from Malta in 1984, and her stroke, Teller began to use slides projected on the wall of her studio to do large drawings. The dynamic force of the marks communicates her determination to conquer the physical. In Gigantija (Malta) (1985; Fig. 4), there is a dynamic play between light and dark, each coming forward and receding in equal turns. Just as one sees an opening, it becomes solid; myriad creatures appear and disappear on the surfaces. The marks in the drawings are sure, sharp, and forceful, the marks of a sculptor. She carves her marks in paper. In all of Teller's sculptures and drawings, from the earliest to the most recent, the balance is delicate yet sure. The sculpture is not just form with space around it; there is no positive or negative space, but a whole continuous environment. And each line in the drawing is an edge, the beginning of one form or the end of the other. Her works speak at the same time of gentleness and forceful power. The iconography is about nature and culture, the message about the life force, the sexual, terrestrial, and cosmic. The primitive and the modern meet congenially. Teller's work is process; it has no pretense of completion. Finished is dead in the language of many 20th-century artists.

She visited exhibitions, followed criticisms, talked to the artists, often in the company of Siskind, and shared literary sources. Her working method is comparable to the Abstract Expressionists' as are her pronouncements. When she views the artist as a "medium," she repeats the thought of Hans Hofmann, who stressed "the mystical qualities which are generated by an almost unintentional process arising from the medium."' When she discusses shapes, her words sound like Rothko: "Shapes are organisms with volition and a passion for self assertion.", In many of her statements Teller affirms that personal expression becomes universal when artists trust their connection to the universal. This is an Abstract Expressionist idea that comes, in part, from spiritual and psychological conclusions of Dada and Surrealist groups at the beginning of this century and the</page><page sequence="5">32 Woman's Art Journal continuing explorations of mystical ideas during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. However, the Dada and Surrealist groups had political and social motivations that do not apply to Teller's work nor to the Abstract Expressionists'.9 The American Abstract Expressionists felt their approach was new, pure, and not bound by any tradition; therefore, rebellion was not their motivation. They painted from a sincere desire to be true to their medium and to themselves. The course of development of each member of the group, and Teller can be included, can be seen as a search for "their gesture" or personal signature. Teller also shares the philosophical environment out of which this style emerges. The strange mix of Existentialism, Freud, Jung, Zen, and Taoism, and ideas from the "new physics" describes the world in a way in which artists intuitively came to perceive it."o Teller is attracted to the parts of these disciplines and philosophies that speak of being present in the "now," that emphasize that everything is connected, influenced by the observer, and part of a continually changing pattern. As in all ages, for the artist, it is a question of "reality" and "truth." Teller's use of random forms and her trust in her ability to find their position demonstrates another tie to the artistic philosophy of the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1950s Zen and Taoism were studied and discussed by Reinhardt, Tobey, Pousette-Dart, Motherwell, and Pollock and actively preached by John Cage. Cage especially fostered the idea of chance, the art of impulse, the trust in the medium." From the Taoist idea of simply "being" and psycho- therapy's concept of "being in the world not of it""2 comes the attitude that a painting or sculpture is a presence in and of itself and not a duplication or representation of something else. Teller says, "What you see here is not descriptive in any sense ... all my work relates to nature; I am not describing nature for I can't get far enough away from it ... I feel part of it." Jane Teller's sculptures and drawings speak of the balance and equilibrium of yin-yang. All, no matter the size, are monumental as well as intimate, iconic and inviting, connected to the distant past and to the future, but all real presences now. Her work is descended from Abstract Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism and is connected to prehistoric monuments at Malta and Stonehenge as well as to Einstein because it is part of the continually evolving pattern of life. It connects with the "big rhythm." * 1. All artist's statements are from personal interviews, tape recordings, and written materials given to the author during 1985 and 1986. 2.
