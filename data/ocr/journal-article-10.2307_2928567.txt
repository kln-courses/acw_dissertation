<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIMON DURING The Strange Case of Monomania: Patriarchy in Literature, Murder in Middlemarch, Drowning in Daniel Deronda ON 4 NOVEMBER 1825 IN PARIS , Henriette Cornier, a twenty- seven-year-old servant, was sent to buy some cheese. Mme. Belon, the shop- keeper, had a nineteen-month-old daughter, Fanny, of whom Henriette was fond. On this occasion she was allowed to take the child for a walk. Instead Henriette led Fanny home, where she severed her head with a kitchen knife. Two hours later the mother called for her daughter. From the top of the stairs, Henriette shouted, "She is dead," and threw the head into the street. Questioned soon after, covered with blood, she answered apathetically, first, "C'est une idee qui m'a pris!" (The idea came to me!), and then, "J'ai voulu la tuer" (I intended to kill her).' This terrible event was to leave traces across nineteenth-century society and culture-and notjust in France or on the psychiatrists and lawyers to whom Hen- riette was at once delivered. As a "classic of criminal psychiatry," it became a noto- rious instance of a strange new condition, a mental illness called monomania.2 Monomania was defined quite simply. It indicated a localized but profound break in the unity of the psyche: a break between faculties that Etienne Esquirol, who named it, called a "partial lesion." At the most abstract level it operated on the classical divisions between the faculties: in monomania, will separated from emo- tion, reason from will, emotion from reason. Desiring components of the faculties themselves could also become detached from one another, to produce very spe- cific conditions: erotomania, infanticidal monomania, theomania (the belief one was God), and so on. The peculiarity of monomania lay in its being (implicitly) a pathology of structure rather than of content, so that the faculties themselves remained in order. Monomaniacs could "think, reason, and act like other men."3 Thus, to appear normal no longer meant to be sane, at least in the disease's acute form. Unlike delirium or mania it could be revealed in a single bizarre act dis- rupting a superficially ordinary life. As with Philippe Pinel's "partial insanity," which anticipated it, monomania emerged when classical faculty psychology belatedly began to collapse under the pressure of a Lockean view of the psyche as a table of distinct ideas to which emotions and desires might attach. It did so, however, in the face of immense difficulties. 86 REPRESENTATIONS 23 * Summer 1988 C) THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA</page><page sequence="2">The breakdown of the unifying structure of the mind meant that principles of intelligibility by which the condition might be defined themselves falter. No causal nexus, no narrative could explain acts emerging from monomania. Admit- tedly, they could have a physical basis (in Henriette's case the fact that she was menstruating was considered relevant),4 but the connections between mind and body remained vague and were certainly hidden from the patient's view. Mono- mania's victims had to fictionalize: "By plausible motives, by very reasonable explanations, they justify the actual condition of their sentiments, and excuse the strangeness and inconsistency of their conduct."5 The condition is, in an often used term, "motiveless," essentially unfathomable. Thus to classify its forms is nei- ther to define modes of pathology in terms of a knowable psychological state nor to explain an act. Classification of its various modes or instances becomes merely the mirror of different categories of event. How then to recognize a monomaniacal act? Just by its "strangeness and inconsistency," which means its resistance to understanding. To supply an internal motive, however skewed; to frame behavior as the outcome of a system of delu- sions; to link it to a pathology of affect is in each case to turn monomania into some other, older, form of madness-into delirium, mania, or melancholia. To make sense of an act (except fictionally) is to draw it away from monomania. The disorder becomes, in effect if not in theory, dependent on the interpretative inge- nuity of the psychiatrist-it exists where it cannot be made intelligible, where "common sense" cannot construe a motive. Monomania is barred to common sense in its very semblance of sanity. For this reason its victims were subject to an unprecedented amount of medical attention: they were psychology's first "cases." Such a malady did not appear as a new biological species might be "discov- ered," calmly and incontestably, or even in the way that a new physical disease might enter the medical system of classification. Its traces spread so wide because it appeared in an area of intense intellectual and professional conflict: between psychiatry and the law, between the metaphysics of free will and determinism, and between a priori and a posteriori knowledge. Yet the reverberations of Hen- riette's act, for instance, are connected notjust to the quarrels it stimulated among the theorists and professionals but to its occurring on a stage lit by the full glare of publicity. Few crimes were more richly reported in the French press of the time than Henriette's. She was news. Given the way the condition was defined, it may seem odd that when acts of homicidal monomania were publicized, further such acts could occur. It is, how- ever, in such a connection that Esquirol, who himself examined Henriette, refers to her (though not by name) in his great work Mental Maladies: A Treatise on Insanity: "A woman cuts off the head of a child whom she scarcely knew, and is brought to trial for it. The trial is very extensively publicized, and produces, from the effect of imitation, many cases of homicidal monomania without delirium. In this last series of facts, the understanding, moral affections and will, exercise no The Strange Case of Monomania 87</page><page sequence="3">influence."6 We catch sight of another paradox of monomania here. Although in its unfathomableness it is the most specific of maladies, it is also the most open to imitation. For to detach one's will from one's understanding, to have no motive, is to become vulnerable to repeating an act under the guidance of some external representation. Thus the distribution of exciting or compelling accounts of mad- ness and crime, including (or rather, especially) Henriette's, may produce what Esquirol calls an "epidemic" of monomania. Conceptually, then, monomania is the entry into consciousness of an inten- tion to act that appears not just from "nowhere"-as in Henriette's case-but from the outside, and is defined less by psychology (as we think of it after Freud or as readers of "psychological" fiction, in terms of the complex development of an autonomous consciousness), than by epistemology, by the effect of represen- tation on action. More specifically, it appears whenever representations of destructive or weird acts puncture the will so as to disrupt the application of general principles and conventions. Newspapers, of course, exist in part by cir- culating such representations; that is why they were integral to an epidemic of monomania. We might go further: insofar as they are polemical or "sensational," insofar as they lack an omniscient narrative voice, newspapers break the network of socially constructed sense and motive, providing a medium for monomania. The repetitions that Henriette's act incited are not, however, independent of its occurring at the boundaries where psychiatry meets the law, and psychology, epistemology. For it was massively covered by the press not only because it was sensational but because the trial was drawn out as the doctors tried to fix Hen- riette's condition for and within the machinery ofjustice. When she was arrested, the court, at her lawyer's request, appointed a medical commission to examine her and report on her "actual moral state."7 Its objective was limited to deciding whether she could endure trial; nevertheless, its members, among whom was Esquirol, found themselves unable to call her either "insane" or "sane" on the grounds that they had had insufficient time to examine her. To decide that required the patient to be "observed very often, nearly continuously, at all hours of the day and night, and above all, unknown to [her]."8 The case was adjourned, and further medical observation was permitted. Henriette was taken to Salpetri- ere, yet four months later, when the trial resumed, again the doctors were unable to decide finally as to her condition. This time they could not be sure that her present condition was not caused by her hospitalization and the events that had led to it. The motivelessness of monomania, its guise of sanity, prevented its being confidently diagnosed in the hostile environment of the court, and this in the very case that was to become the condition's classic instance in psychiatric texts (especially in Isaac Ray's A Treatise on the Medical Jurisprudence of Insanity, whose influence was immense in the United States). Henriette was found guilty of unpremeditated murder and sentenced to hard labor for life. Had the murder been judged meditated, the sentence would have been death. 88 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="4">Those doctors who defended the existence of monomania and urged psychi- atric intervention in court procedure were later to accuse Esquirol and his com- mittee of timidity.9 According to Etienne Georget, Henriette either was or was not mad (he assumed she was) and in the second instance should have been guil- lotined; in the first, placed in an asylum. Yet the court's appeal to psychiatry was itself by no means automatic in 1825. As we have seen, doctors were officially involved merely to see whether Henriette could withstand trial. This enabled the defense to appeal to its own authority (Dr. Marc), who gave evidence that (under article 64 of the Penal Code) Henriette was not criminally responsible for her act. This evidence failed partly just because many still believed psychiatrists had no place in juridical proceedings at all. The strongest argument to that end, Kant's, had been contentious in Germany when it appeared in 1797, and it remained so. The debate was rekindled in the aftermath of Fanny's murder. In his Anthropology, Kant had asserted that where an allegedly criminal act seems to be irrational then the question of madness necessarily enters, yet "in this case the court cannot refer the question to the medical faculty but must refer it (because of its own incompetence) to the philosophy faculty."'0 For he regarded philosophers, not doctors, as the best judges of whether an individual retained "natural powers of understanding and judgment." Although Kant's position is stated in unusually elliptical terms, it rests on the view that philosophers are experts (so to say) at recognizing forms of rationality in general and the relation between reason and action in particular. It also implies that doctors have to see criminals as insane because for them all irrational acts must be consequences of empirical, and ultimately physical, conditions. Thus Kant gives as an example a case of infanticide in which the judge exempted a woman from the death penalty because she committed the murder "out of the fear of the penitentiary." This seemed irrational to the judge (death being worse than prison) and hence a symptom of madness. Kant notes that "on the basis of this argument we might well declare all criminals insane, people to be pitied and treated, but not punished." Kant is, uncharacteristically, dreaming of a useful metaphysician here: one who can turn awareness of the conditions of knowledge into praxis. In reply, the doctors pointed out that mental illness takes empirical forms that are difficult to classify but that their training is designed to recognize and treat. Yet the reason why Henriette's case set the debate alive again was that nosology failed. Con- fronted with her act, medical science could only ask: "Did she have a motive?" or "Was her act determined?"-questions that, as we have seen, could only be answered by trying, and failing, to contextualize and narrativize her act. In this common sense-and the Kantian anthropology or epistemology that sharpen it- has at least as much purchase as psychiatry. On the other hand, monomania proper can never belong to an anthropology that, like Kant's, brings all human behavior into the frames of reason, will, and emotion. Indeed, one must suspect The Strange Case of Monomania 89</page><page sequence="5">that the paradoxes that monomania calls into play are, in part, a consequence of its having, for professional reasons, to belong neither to the law nor to enlight- ened philosophy. Esquirol opened up a terrain in which Kant could not travel, and where the law, with its presuppositions of rationality and responsibility, must cede to doctors of the mind. But in the process, the condition itself escapes rules. If any paradigm for the relation between psychiatry and monomania can be con- ceived it is an aesthetic one-something like that between criticism and poetry at least as it has been articulated since Dr. Johnson. There also, to formulate a rule for the object means that the object, the poetry of the poem, is lost. It is testimony to the power of monomania's enigma that Lord Brougham began the debate that led to the M'Naghten rules in England as a response to the threat to responsibility that the condition posed. Kant's question was repeated: if madness and, hence, irresponsibility could reveal themselves not in disorder but in the mere absence of motive, where could the law grip? Those rules insisted that to be called insane the accused must not "know the nature or the quality of the act he was doing," and, except in rare cases, they were to take psychiatrists out of the English courts for over a century. " I And the noun expert in what was to become its dominant sense also entered the English language attached to mono- mania's enigma. An expert witness, whether of the prosecution or the defense, was neutral, and could offer opinions based on facts, not just the facts themselves like other witnesses. The status of that opinion was hotly contested, but Isaac Ray, for whom expert is still French, had no doubts: "Instead of the unqualified and irresponsible witnesses, now too often brought forward to enlighten the minds of jurymen on medical subjects, it would be far better if we had a class of men, more or less like that of the experts of the French, peculiarly fitted for the duty by a course of studies directed to this end."'12 The case cited in support of this? None other than Henriette's: to mount his case Ray repeats Georget's objections to the court's refusal to let doctors judge her mental state at the time of the crime. Less predictably, he ignored the fact that the experts could not in fact produce ajudg- ment at all. He forgot that Henriette remained, in Kant's terms, neither ade- quately pitied nor properly punished, neither insane nor criminal. That the culture of the expert is given impetus by a case where expertise fails reminds us that the power of knowledge is not primarily dependent on the pro- duction of truths: often, as here, it requires their blockage. This leads to a further, more searching, question. What is the motive behind depriving Henriette's act of meaning? Today at least, a reading seems available. A head is cut off, it falls to the ground. This seems very French: the guillotine, instrument of resentment as well as justice, is imitated. (Henriette herself was haunted by the idea: "They who kill, deserve death";'3 in England she may well have poisoned or stabbed her victim.) May we suspect that, in general, the silence surrounding monomania often shadows resentment? Some time before the murder, shortly after being 90 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="6">dismissed from a post, Henriette had attempted suicide; being, as she said, sick of moving from master to master, one of whom had beaten her with a cosh.'4 Charles Marc, at least, considered that attempt rational enough-as it had to be if the later act were to belong to acute monomania. A servant habitually mistreated by her employers commits an extremely vio- lent murder-this begins to throw political light on madness. And indeed the debate over monomania skirted politics continuously-largely because the battle between the lawyers and doctors was thought of as a "struggle between social interests demanding justice, and the new systems which claim themselves protec- tors of humanity."' 5 Monomania sets humanity against society, those on the latter side appealing to Hobbes's famous view that "in almost all Crimes there is an Injury done not only to some Private man, but also to the Common-wealth."' 6 As soon as one believes that, there is a point in calling murderers "monsters" and "beasts," as the prosecutors and the press often did: such names make them unavailable to humanism. (Indeed that lexicon belongs as. much to counter- revolution as to melodrama: one need only think of the attacks on Stendhal's Julien Sorel at the end of Le Rouge et le noir [1830] and, obversely, Sorel's appeal to revolutionary politics in exculpation of a crime of passion.) So the condition's defenders took great care to separate homicidal monomania from politics. Georget insists that notorious murderers such as Papavoine, Legere (who ate his victim's heart), and Henriette herself were quite different from Louvel, who attempted to assassinate the duc de Berry. Still more revealing of this threat to monomania is the way in which a 'jacobin" novel, William Godwin's Caleb Williams, as adapted for the French stage under the title Falkland ou le conscience, enters the Cornier debate. Ajournalist in Journal des debats had argued that it is "consoling" to think of crime as "insanity," and asked whether a monomaniac deserved more "indulgence" than Falkland."7 In the novel, Falkland, an enlightened aristocrat, murders Tyrell, his brutal and patriarchal (at least in the sense of "feudal") neighbor who has driven a young woman in his care to death. The crime is not simply committed under the sign of social justice; it happens when Falkland loses all control after Tyrell has insulted him in public. Falkland is not quite a criminal (a "beast" or "monster"), not a revolutionary, not mad. Georget avoids the way Godwin's plot insinuates politics into criminal madness by arguing that it does not deal in types (cannot sanction "general maxims, articles of law, and moral pre- cepts")'8 and by firmly setting it apart from Henriette, who has no motive at all. Yet Henriette belonged to that group of women who kill children, a group more prominent then than now. In light of her experience and Godwin's plot we may ask: where women's powerlessness is legitimated by their bearing children, how more urgently to cry out against their place than by infanticide? (Infanticide also worked as a form of abortion and was often surprisingly leniently treated.)'9 Indeed, to call Henriette's act "motiveless" might be not to want to see the struc- The Strange Case of Monomania 91</page><page sequence="7">tures of patriarchy. Unlike Pierre Riviere, who committed the inverse, very male crime-parricide-she wrote no explanatory account. If she had, she could not have been thought of as a monomaniac at all. But in a society whose gender pol- itics were rudimentary, for a woman to break silence was impossible. Henriette's is the condition's classic instance because Fanny was not her own child-which lets both class and gender enter the attempt to grant the act social meaning. Its politics are massively displaced, but if the act is deprived of sense by being fixed at the border between epistemology and psychology, then that border helps maintain a blindness (shared by Henriette) to social conflict. This way of thinking, which depends on a view of gender relations as system- atically constituted by inequities of power and opportunity, moves Henriette out of monomania. Her motivelessness is seen as compelled by an unconscious, dis- persed motive that transcends individual psychology. Yet I suspect that this attempt to rescue Henriette from monomania cannot be wholly persuasive. For the distance between patriarchy and her act is so large that no causal or inten- tional category can connect them; they come together in mediations ("uncon- scious and dispersed") so nearly empty that they barely come together at all. Nevertheless, the entities thus mediated cannot, now, help but enter: they are set in motion by the relation between the current general concept "patriarchy" and the obsolete disease, monomania, which made enigmas of individuals and still demands interpretation. After Henriette, as we shall see, psychiatry will steadily deprive insanity of its mysteries while, on another track, patriarchy becomes increasingly visible. Thus her monomania is a sign of the distance between the political and the psychological, the social and personal, in her time. All this may seem a long way from George Eliot. But in Middlemarch she does tell a story about a victim of the epidemic of monomania. In Paris in the late 1820s, Lydgate falls in love with the actress Laure. Laure, playing alongside her real-life spouse, acts out a scene in which a wife murders her husband (most likely in Lucie de Lammermoor), and one night kills her partner on stage. Accident or not? At her trial she claims to have slipped and is discharged because "no motive was discoverable." Yet when Lydgate pursues her, the story changes. "I meant to do it," she insists-repeating Henriette's words. Two paths of transmission connect the phrase to Middlemarch. The first, moving from fact to fiction, consists of the actual newspaper stories about the crime that the fictional Laure must have read-even though her reading them is not directly narrated. In this transmission the act's nature alters. As we have seen, newspapers make monomania mimetic-a disease may become a role via their pages-so that Laure's being on stage comes to double a dissimulation possible as soon as we realize that her words to Lydgate are not her own. Her interview with Lydgate turns on an ambivalence this determines: 92 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="8">"My foot really slipped." "I know, I know," said Lydgate, deprecatingly. "It was a fatal accident-a dreadful stroke of calamity that bound me to you the more." Again Laure paused a little and then said, slowly, "I meant to do it." Lydgate, strong man as he was, turned pale and trembled: moments seemed to pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her. "There was a secret, then," he said at last, even vehemently. "He was brutal to you: you hated him." "No! he wearied me; he was too fond: he would live in Paris, and not in my country; that was not agreeable to me." "Great God!" said Lydgate, in a groan of horror. "And you planned to murder him?" "I did not plan: it came to me in the play-I meant to do it." Lydgate stood mute ... He saw this woman-the first to whom he had given his young adoration-amid the throng of stupid criminals. "You are a good young man," she said. "But I do not like husbands. I will never have another. "20 Ultimately, the entry of monomania into this scene transforms the status of Laure's desire to discard an oppressively intimate husband. Without monomania two alternative readings are possible: either Laure is a liar who really did acci- dentally slip and is now frightening her persistent suitor off or she is a criminal safely confessing at last. Monomania destroys this division by turning her wish for autonomy into a fiction that can make illusory sense of her motiveless act. (Its motivelessness is, like Henriette's, signaled by an empty insistence on a motive.) Breathing the life of Paris in the 1 820s, Laure's monomania adds to the text's verisimilitude. But it is concealed. Why? No doubt because Eliot's fiction cannot cope with the decay of psychic structuration or narrative sequence that the con- dition imposes: after all, as a monomaniac's, Laure's act would be strictly mean- ingless. But it is also concealed for something like the opposite reason: because as Laure comes closer to Henriette she also comes closer to Dorothea, and the distinctions upon which the novel's ostensible moral message hangs begin to fail. With monomania, a more dangerous meaning looms: murder is no longer a matter of conscious motives; rather, motives can be given problematic sense by that larger pattern "patriarchy" that covers all women-from Laure to Doro- thea-who are objects of proprietorial sexual desire. Their relation to one another becomes then less a "web" (the usual conceptualization of Eliot's "world"), or a pattern of oppositions, than a series of repetitions. So Dorothea is something like a murderer too. This is most apparent in the novel's climactic scene where she comforts Rosamund, whom she falsely believes is her rival for Ladislaw's love: "Marriage is so unlike everything else. There is something even awful in the nearness it brings. Even if we loved some one else better than-than those we were married to, it would be no use"-poor Dorothea, in her palpitating anxiety, could only seize her lan- guage brokenly-"I mean, marriage drinks up all our power of giving or getting any blessedness in that sort of love. I know it may be very dear-but it murders our marriage- The Strange Case of Monomania 93</page><page sequence="9">and then the marriage stays with us like a murder-and everything else is gone. And then our husband-if he loved and trusted us, and we have not helped him, but made a curse in his life. . . " (855) In fact Dorothea is talking about herself. The broken language hints at that, but it becomes quite clear when Rosamund tells Dorothea that Ladislaw loves her. Then Dorothea's suddenly public love for Ladislaw allows us to see not just that her marriage to Casaubon was a tomb, but, in the three dots that signify her inability to finish the speech, that he who, like Laure's husband, came "too near," was killed. Casaubon's death is a murder to the degree that murder may occupy a space hollowed out by Henriette, a space in which it requires no conscious motive but can exist whenever death, mysteriously, follows slips, withdrawals of love, desires for freedom and autonomy, failures of faith ... In breaking down the distinction between motivated and unmotivated killing Henriette's malady allows this speech to work not as a sympathetic expression of Rosamund's plight but as a confession. Once that is accepted, the startling and bleak message that Middlemarch takes from monomania can be spelled out: in freeing themselves from male sexual domina- tion, women commit murder. Not that this is a "message" in any simple way, for the novel conceals as much as reveals it, especially in its hidden citation of Hen- riette's words. Time and scholarship are required for its full communication. It may be stated once it has become, as in this account, much more formulaic than it was in 1870-though not, I would insist, merely formulaic. The second path of transmission from Paris of the 1820s to Eliot's novels is, indeed, the scholarship that kept Henriette's case alive. While Eliot was writing Middlemarch, G. H. Lewes was working on his Problems of Life and Mind. At night she would sometimes read aloud to him books useful in his research, among them major psychiatric texts, including Esquirol's. No doubt it was during these tran- quil nights of shared learning that Henriette's name cropped up. Yet between the 1820s and the late 1860s her condition had changed. Monomania, in the form Esquirol and his followers had defined it, ceased to exist. Psychiatry now analyzed what were called "pathologies of insanity" more rigidly in terms of the physical basis of mind-the title of one of Lewes's own Problems. Insanity was firmly fixed as inherited in Benedict Morel's Traite' des de'generescences physiques, intellectuelles, et morales de l'espece humaine (1857), and the organic unity of the brain became the guiding principle of neurological and psychiatric thinking following Marshall Hall's formulation of the neural reflex in the 1830s. The notion of a structural break in psychic unity that could permit the pathological autonomy of desiring acts disappeared as mind became increasingly reduced to brain function. The work that consolidated these shifts for psychiatry was Wilhelm Griesin- ger's Die Pathologie und Therapie der psychischen Krankheiten, especially in the 1861 edition. Its originality in part depended upon its rejection of monomania, which 94 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="10">Griesinger claimed had "even in the land of its birth ... fallen into a state of complete neglect" and had always been of "more importance forensically than pathologically."2' For him, monomania had been produced for the courts (Grie- singer believed psychiatry had little place there) though he continued to use the term to describe a form of mania-an aggrandizement of the ego. Indeed, his psychiatry was based on analyses of mental pathology in terms of a breakdown of the central psychic mass, the "Ich," whose physical analogue was the brain con- ceived of as an "immense psychic apparatus." No mental event could occur except in relation to the unifying processes of brain neurology. Monomania was impos- sible-a mere professional ploy. Henriette was not forgotten in this. Griesinger wrote: "The well-known case of Henrietta [sic] Cornier appeared for a long time to belong to this category [i.e., a form of mania like monomania]. But Bonnet tells us that the girl Cornier informed her prison companions that it was to avenge herself on her lover, with whom she had been living in the most intimate relations, that she slew her child, after having long premeditated the crime" (268). Everything has changed. No longer a servant girl living with her employers; no longer childless; no longer without motive-Henriette is now a brooding woman killing her own child to avenge herself on her live-in lover. By altering the facts, Griesinger contains monomania in a banal, if tragic, narrative so as to describe the case by his own ego psychology. Along the way, he rids himself of the condition's paralogisms, which invite political rather than psychological interpretation. Eliot's Laure is connected not to Griesinger's Henriette but to Esquirol's. Cer- tain reasons for this have been outlined, but it is important to emphasize another, more abstract, one. Because its analysis ultimately works at the level of the body, the genetic, materialist bias of mid- and late-Victorian psychiatry cannot in prin- ciple be absorbed by the classic realist novel. The irruption of that model into the novel genre is the moment of naturalism (Zola) and protomodernism (Flaubert), which were then perceived to be two aspects of a single sociocultural impulse. This Eliot, with her insistence on moral development and on the power of rep- resentation, resisted. Thus she was compelled to anachronism. Perhaps not just in this regard either: like those of her contemporaries, Dickens and Thackeray, her novels (except her last) tend to be set back by about a generation-at a point at which psychological and sociological "truth" was not under the dominion of science connected to statistics, to laboratories, to organic matter, and so remained available to a narrative voice and structure articulating something like "common sense." Griesinger's denial that psychiatry, as hard science, can offer expertise about criminal responsibility (his giving up ground to Kant, we might say), remains a paradigm of the withdrawal of dialogue between science and those moraljuridical discourses that the realist novel maintained. Scientific truth's threat to realism is everywhere apparent in Daniel Deronda (1876), which demonstrates the wider cultural consequences of monomania more The Strange Case of Monomania 95</page><page sequence="11">thoroughly than any other text I know. Set as late as the 1860s, it too tells the story of a wife whose husband dies-though the question of responsibility is now on center stage. Gwendolen wishes to revenge herself on the brutal Grandcourt; he dies as a boat capsizes, which is-is it?-an accident. Gwendolen has intensely desired the event; she has long been gripped by hallucinations that anticipate it. At the crucial moment she is paralyzed. Has she unconsciously caused it? Is she a murderer or not? These questions repeat those posed by Laure, which them- selves depend on the Cornier controversies. Like Henriette, Gwendolen ends the novel in purgatory, confined to her house, pitied perhaps but neither punished nor treated. Her act also highlights gender conflict. The novel mounts a cultural critique; she and Grandcourt exist as types of the English upper classes' perceived loss of values. Gwendolen's desire for her husband's death can, thus, again be general- ized into the idea that freedom from male power may entail death/murder. This becomes increasingly apparent, however, as that power is curtailed. To select important events: the 1857 act that brought divorce to the middle classes; the 1 860s agitation against legislation controlling prostitution in which women, lobbying to unseat MPs, had their first political success; the claim to female ter- tiary education during the same decade-all expose the systematic connections between gender and power. As the political and the personal come closer for women, the invitation to a political reading offered by Henriette's crime trans- forms itself into the shadowy responsibility of Eliot's heroines for their husbands' deaths. Yet the questions posed by Grandcourt's end have an energy that the slight easing of women's lot cannot absorb. As type of a lack, Gwendolen is an example of a pathology that, in shaping her as an individual, also constitutes her as a case. After Griesinger (and before Freud) she cannot be scrutinized in simply legal or psychological terms. What kind of language can be used to know and describe her? What expertjudge her? The novel faces these now urgent questions by imag- ining the expert as a humanist Messiah. This damages its verisimilitude, but the work's strength lies elsewhere-in the difficulties it voices and embodies. It attempts to make the new conceptions of how individuals are known and formed available to modes of social evaluation; it struggles to create characters as both case and type. Furthermore, it allows us to confront the possibility that questions of knowledge and judgment framed in this way fall not just on people but on writing-in particular, on itself. Once such questions are consciously directed at writing we approach another terrain-modern literary criticism. Its clearest break with the past is to turn the literary canon into a series of texts each of which may be examined individually as if it were (like Henriette) a case. Of course, criticism also attempts to stem those social divisions (into science and culture, into high and mass culture) that earlier had led Daniel Deronda to treat of characters as both moral/political instances and 96 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="12">psychological studies. Yet, it encounters monomania from another direction too, for, as we have seen, by not taking the form of a law, the relation between mono- mania and psychiatric knowledge is best regarded as aesthetic. The point is that the new criticism does notjust make something new of literature (under the pres- sure of sociological forces felt first in literature itself), but that its "something new" displaces and revalues older, quite remote, formations that it is neither causally connected to nor absolutely independent of. Yet "discussions of the new criticism must start with Mr. Richards,"22 and his major work, Principles of Literary Criticism, does in fact depend upon the language of psychology-though to antipsychological ends. Like Esquirol before him, I. A. Richards rejects "metaphysics" (aesthetics and faculty psychology). He does so by supposing texts to communicate experiences shaped in the act of communication. Psychological entities and neurological events are replaced by linguistic forms: for him, values are contained less in propositions than in formal structures. To be judged, a text must be carefully examined on its own terms-just as Henriette had once to be watched because her faculties gave no sign of her condition. Not that the text or its writer is monomaniacal, rather the reverse: the artist appears to be mad but is in fact sane: "His superficial resemblance to persons who are merely mental chaoses, unorganized, without selective ability and of weak and diffused attention, is . .. clear. Essentially he is the opposite of these."23 "Oppo- site" in that "his" utterances have structure as utterances. The impossibility of reducing that structure to an external base (including experience itself) disposes criticism to close reading. Richards gives literary texts an autonomy by dragging them from psychology (representation) or action (persuasion), as monomania gave psychiatrists their autonomy by being unavailable to the law or Kantian anthropology. This bequeaths to criticism an anxiety that endures at least until deconstruction: texts must possess the structure that their secret sharer-mono- mania-lacks. Richards not only uses the language of psychology to define criticism, he models the critic on its institutions, repeating with some relish: "The critic is as closely occupied with the health of the mind as the doctor with the health of the body"-and thinking of critics, like artists, as "expert in minute particulars" (25, 47). The critic becomes an expert in reading where to read is to inspect the text's words and the subjective response to them so as both to uncover an "equilibrium" that reconciles clashing impulses and blocks those impulses from being acted out. For Richards the mass media circulate structureless texts in the same way that monomania, also nourished in newspapers, eluded metaphysics and the law.24 In view of both, vigilance, the recording of readings, and a profession are required to maintain value. Such exchanges between psychology and criticism are resisted in advance in Daniel Deronda, which, as it binds scientific truth to realism, none- theless demands the close reading proper to the professions it would transcend. I attempt to meet that demand in the following comments on the novel. The Strange Case of Monomania 97</page><page sequence="13">In an often cited scene, the novel begins when, watching the gambling at a German casino, Daniel singles Gwendolen out: Was she beautiful or not beautiful? and what was the secret of form or expression which gave the dynamic quality to her glance? Was the good or the evil genius dominant in those beams? Probably the evil; else why was the effect that of unrest rather than of undisturbed charm? Why was the wish to look again felt as coercion and not as a longing in which the whole being consents?25 With critical and scientific detachment Daniel examines himself as he watches. His-if it is his-rhetoric effaces arbitrariness: beauty equals good equals consent and calm; not-beauty equals evil equals coercion and unrest. (The word dynamic, which puzzled the reviewers, belongs to mental science.)26 Summarizing the neg- ative series, the narrator will describe the gamblers as "automatons." This term belongs to the theory, popularized by William Carpenter, that gambling, like some forms of insanity, reduces action to a mere reflex.27 Yet the passage can be read differently: not as the record of a detached scrutiny but as indicating a flight from sexual response into the calm of analysis. An unsuccessful flight: in the last sen- tence, where Daniel declares his own compulsion, he is coerced and analytical, expert and subject. Gwendolen reads-and, in a moment of extraordinary subtlety, misreads- Deronda's response not as compelled but simply as measuring: The darting sense that he was measuring her and looking down on her as an inferior, that he was of a different quality from the human dross around her, that he felt himself in a region outside and above her, and was examining her as a specimen of a lower order, roused a tingling resentment which stretched the moment with conflict. (38) In overemphasizing the scientism of Deronda's interest, Gwendolen becomes a case for the reader just as, in fleeing from sex to structure, he has too. Once Daniel, the measurer, the modern Messiah, is a "specimen," things change. To read the paragraph, not from Daniel (or the narrator's) side but from a distance whose analytic mode doubles theirs, is to break the novel's manifest values. After all, to be "measured" and "looked down upon" is not to be a source of inspiration. Here individuals are becoming cases for one another, recording, judging, inter- preting; expertise is proliferating outside the bounds of institutions, inside a humanism that hopes to exceed them. Gwendolen's response to Daniel is given in a deceptively simple phrase: "He ... roused a tingling resentment which stretched the moment with conflict." This transfers an intense affective response ("roused," "tingled") onto an intellectual sense of separateness ("resentment") along a material-neurological?-con- tinuum ("stretched"), which is itself, in a catachresis, the ground of a nonmaterial rupture ("conflict"). Moving between the psychological and the figurative, the phrase belongs unmistakably to "literature." In it, the narrative voice peers deep into Gwendolen's psyche, crossing and binding the novel's two modes of charac- 98 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="14">terization. As the object of scrutiny, Gwendolen is available to a quasipsycholog- ical lexicon; as a feeling, self-aware character in a world the implied reader shares, she is available to identification. One might say that this double move ties expe- rience to control, and allows the reader experience as control; certainly, it coalesces type and case. The complex play of Gwendolen's mental processes culminates in the mo- ment of Grandcourt's death. Here they are yachting just before the accident/ murder: She remembered Deronda's words: they were continually recurring in her thought- "Turn your fear into a safeguard. Keep your dread fixed on the idea of increasing your remorse . .. Take your fear as a safeguard. It is like quickness of hearing. It may make consequences passionately present to you." And so it was. In Gwendolen's consciousness Temptation and Dread met and stared like two pale phantoms, each seeing itself in the other-each obstructed by its own image; and all the while her fuller self beheld the apparitions and sobbed from deliverance from them. (738) Deronda's words are therapeutic, though the imperative voice lends them a moral menace that therapy will lose in psychoanalysis. They cannot be merely obeyed, however; if they could, we would remain in the Kantian world of law as reason, reason as law. Their force must be "passionately present." Thus his injunction, "Use your fear," cannot involve a practice; instead it is translated into that phan- tasmagoric contest between "Temptation" and "Dread" acted out in Gwendolen's mind. The "phantoms" of this psychomachy are unable to be pictured; as mirrors, obstructions, and apparitions successively, they are "free" in Richards's sense- figures that exceed their propositional force (94). Indeed, no transformation of imperatives into images (here, to bolster authority) could ever be represented. Autonomous rhetorical effects replace psychology: Gwendolen's passive "fuller self" watches a drama whose action is primarily linguistic. Or rather it is literary, where literature's responsibility is not primarily to amuse, conserve, or instruct but to stem cultural loss by moving from representation into the freedom of the trope, the purity of structure. Let us recall that to read word by word and to record readings is to demonstrate that texts have escaped the chaos and opacity (the monomania) that may engulf them as they exceed mimesis. The narrator here is a critic of Gwendolen's psyche, though one threatened, like Gwendolen's "fuller self," by the sheer linguisticity she observes. Gwendolen seems ultimately to avoid monomania. She did not mean to kill her husband. "I don't know how it was-he was tying the sail-there was a gust- he was struck-I know nothing-I only know I saw my wish outside of me" (761). All the same, where psychomachy ceases, where language is neither literary nor psychological, she too is a late victim of the epidemic. Her faculties destructure: she desired but did not intend her act, which is thus closed to understanding. Her The Strange Case of Monomania 99</page><page sequence="15">mind, like the newspaper reports of Henriette's crime, carries a representation of an event (her wish, outside of her) which occurs without agency. In this realist novel dealing with types, one can, with the caveats given above, now spell out a message that goes further than that of Middlemarch: women desire the end of brutal male power; that power may indeed lapse, yet they do not murder it. Little in Eliot is more prescient than her anachronistic fascination with the condition that allows her to express this intense longing and to help clear a view of patriarchy. Yet it is where "Temptation" struggles with "Dread," where monomania is overcome, that the text is most vulnerable to the condition's own defining fea- tures: motivelessness, resistance to understanding, a break in the self's coherence. At this point I begin to conclude my story of the absence of structure that psychology called monomania. Psychiatrists, as experts, had invented the condi- tion against the lawyers and philosophers; later, when literature gained experts in close reading, monomania became, implicitly, its opposite and its double. Lit- erature, which was thought to embody a sanity and value the condition lacks, also possesses its energy, its paradoxical freedom from law and restraint. We cannot say, however, that the presence or absence of immanent structure was asserted merely strategically. For monomania was the violent inscription of the distance between the political and the personal; while literature, in the autonomy criticism offered it, promised a site of freedom from, and within, the modern technologies and institutions of representation. Literary studies had among its tasks the tran- scendence or displacement of that violence, the maintenance of a break within the dominant modes of cultural reproduction, protection against the science/cul- ture split.... If our story so far has a moral it is that the tools bequeathed us by criticism are not sufficient for these tasks today-or to decide which of them still demand our energy. To say this, however, is to confront the strongest and most original contem- porary defense of the tools of criticism, Paul de Man's, whose work also contains, at its very heart, an account of the "motivelessness" of texts. I am thinking now of his brilliant essay, "The Purloined Ribbon," which became the last chapter of Alle- gories of Reading. The relations between that essay and "monomania" (or my own thesis) cannot be dealt with inside narrow limits partly because, I suspect, one would soon broach the tendentious and abstract question of how to set the claims and methods of a "new historicism" against those of "deconstruction." A few con- crete remarks, themselves based once more on close reading, must suffice. As his essay draws to an end, and after several characteristic swerves, de Man argues that language, at the level of the signifier, is a machine that may generate and connect utterances without external motive or intent. (The locution "de Man argues" is already too simple, as many of the relevant sentences are in a free indirect mode: they elaborate Rousseau at an indefinable remove.) In support, he 100 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="16">uses the passage when Rousseau, having accused a fellow servant, Marion, of his own theft of a ribbon, attempts to rid himself of guilt. Here too the best excuse for a crime turns out to be the absence of motive. Motivelessness had been psy- chiatry's defense of Henriette, though the attempt to classify it as a psychological condition had foundered on a series of aporias. De Man, however, regards Rous- seau's motivelessness as ordered by language rather than by psychology. Indeed, he believes that notions of guilt and responsibility ultimately and unsuccessfully work to contain the mechanics of the signifier: "There can never be enough guilt around to match the text-machine's infinite power to excuse."28 The immediate difficulty with these large claims is that Rousseau's text need not support them. This is the relevant passage, along with de Man's initial remarks on it: "She [Marion] was present to my mind, I excused myself on the first thing that offered itself. I accused her of doing what I wanted to do and of having given me the ribbon because it was my intention to give it to her...." Because Rousseau desires Marion, she haunts his mind and her name is pronounced almost unconsciously, as if it were a slip, a segment of the discourse of the other." (288) The commentary is disturbing because here Rousseau does not recall himself as pronouncing Marion's name "almost unconsciously" or in any other way. The "thing" that offered itself to Rousseau's mind was "she," Marion the person, not Marion, the name. (The original for "thing" is "l'objet"-which might be translated as "object" in the sense of "target.") Henriette will be reported as using a phrase similar to Rousseau's: "The idea came to me," and her "idea" is even more clearly not a name. (On the other hand, of course, Gwendolen's "Temptation" and "Dread" function more like signifiers than the novel supposes.) De Man has fallen into the temptation, admittedly almost irresistible, to merge the account of the background of Rousseau's act with Rousseau's descrip- tion of the act itself ("I said . .. with a blush that it was Marion who had given it to me").29 But the text does not allow us to assume that, in an instant of high theater, Rousseau "excuses himself" on Marion at the very moment he utters her name in public. Indeed quite otherwise: his blame is first directed at the Marion in his mind. Thus de Man exceeds the text's letter in arguing that, for instance, "It is only if the act that initiated the entire chain, the utterance of the sound 'Marion' is truly without any conceivable motive that the total arbitrariness of the action becomes the most effective, the most efficaciously performative excuse of all" (289). Rhetorical terms such as anacoluthon or parabasis, by which he names this moment of alleged discontinuity in Rousseau's text, seem insufficient to describe his own reinvention of the scene of accusation. Rhetoric deals with the purposes and twists of the text's letter; explanation and interpretation enter where that letter is betrayed, as it generally is (which is not to say that it is in principle possible to decide what belongs to the letter of the text and what does The Strange Case of Monomania 101</page><page sequence="17">not). In heightening the drama of the Confessions to show that rhetorical readings are prior to psychological-or historical-excavations, something like the oppo- site is demonstrated. So again we find ourselves asking: "What is the motive behind this ascription of motivelessness?" The job of replying cannot be embarked on here, but we might indeed begin by rereading Rousseau's text and in particular by reconsid- ering the role of the ribbon, which, under the spell of Lacan and Derrida on Poe, de Man regards as "devoid of meaning," even though a purloined ribbon is very different from a purloined (and unopened) letter. As an article of dress forbidden to servants (Rousseau has already mentioned the austerity of his garb); as an instance of luxury and ornamentation (extraordinarily highly charged terms in the political and economic debates of the time); and as an object that might permit its owner a certain theatricality, fetishism, or transvestitism even. . . that ribbon positively drips with significance. Perhaps more cogently still, we could examine the role of the metaphor of text as machine (derived from Rousseau) that controls de Man's antimetaphorical argument at this point. The metaphor turns on its head a negative image of tech- nology and contrasts almost too neatly with, for instance, I. A. Richards's happy acceptance of the power of criticism to communicate order out of seemingly dis- ordered utterances. The contrast is neat because, whatever their differences, the frame of close reading is not being broken, the profession of literary criticism not disrupted, in the path from Richards to de Man. To speak the language of struc- turalism: here de Man disjoins the signifier/signified couple by binding it to a (romantic) machine/body opposition so as to maintain, by inversion, not only the romanticism he seems to reject but the specificity of literary criticism already set in place by Richards. Does de Man conceive of the text as a motiveless machine that requires the infinite containment of anthropomorphism, partly in order to stake out a realm in which historians, sociologists, and psychologists are off limits-as the psychiatrists once used Henriette's "motivelessness" to deter other professions? Given the unparalleled political effect of Rousseau's writings we might even argue that to find in it moments at which language as such takes over-motiveless moments-may be to work under the sway of political motives, however uncon- scious and dispersed. Again, time and scholarship may facilitate the task of uncov- ering them. But this too is a little easy. "Motivelessness," for whatever reasons, remains, if not a threat, at least a presence today-and if not in persons as current psychology knows them (what do behaviorism and psychoanalysis share if not their intense refusal of its possibility?) then in texts. It is not difficult to find it working even in this essay, whose narrative and argument pivot around the double appearance of the phrase "I meant to do it." That repetition permits the stories told here, but it may nonetheless be accidental. Our narrative of an absence of connection or motive might be, in part, an instance of its own subject. This 102 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="18">involves no transcendental claim. As "motivelessness" attaches to institutions, acts, or texts it belongs to history, even where it helps keep institutions alive and history at bay-as it does in literary studies today. The acute questions seem to be: does the lack of embarrassment with which we can now accommodate "motivelessness" in (purist) literary studies mean that they, and it, are losing force? Or, on the contrary, does it mean that the insistent question "What is the motive of 'motive- lessness'?" can no longer be effectively asked? I think this essay, which pushes hard to say no to the second, helps remind us that one can't quite say yes to the first.

Of course, literature can embrace the arbitrariness, the absence of structure, from which criticism would save it. The value given to "chance" in French modernism is an example (in Eliot chance-as gambling-is always an enemy). Baudelaire's prose poem "Le Mauvais Vitrier" is a more particular instance, and there Henriette leaves traces again. Its "I" commits a parodic and male version of her crime: as the "victim" of a "mysterious and unaccountable impulse," he throws a flower pot out a window, smashing some glass panes below. Without attempting a full reading of the text, one can say that it calls upon monomania (impossibly) to express resentment against realism: the narrator breaks the panes because they are not colored, they have no "beauty." 25.
