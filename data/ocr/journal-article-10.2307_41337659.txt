Reviewed by Christopher Goto-Jones Leiden University It seems that the issue of contemporary Japan's relationship with its mod- ern historical consciousness (and especially its war memory) will not go away. There is a resilient and slightly mysterious presumption among vari- ous commentators and political practitioners that postwar Japan has not yet successfully come to terms with the violence it perpetrated on much of Asia in the first half of the twentieth century. Japan is entrapped and enwrapped by sengo (postwar), unable to escape. And yet, there is a definite accusative sense in the discourse, particularly when it is framed in the (now very con- ventional) comparative terms that place postwar Japan alongside postwar Germany: while Germany (and the Germans) appear to have made peace with (and shown penitence for) the violence done in World War II, Japan (and the Japanese) have not. In some versions of this story, this comparative discrepancy explains why Germany is now fully integrated into the Euro- pean Union, but no comparable regional order has managed to integrate Japan into East Asia. In other words, Japan is both trapped in a perpetual sengo and has somehow managed to escape it without really dealing with it. Thankfully, Seraphim as well as Jager and Mitter take us outside and beyond these conventional kinds of problematics. Indeed, both of these vol- umes appear to indicate a new and welcome direction for the field.</page><page sequence="2">1 92 Journal of Japanese Studies 37:1 (20 1 1 ) The resilience of the paradoxical sengo narrative that we have seen un- til recently is surprising and mysterious for a number of clear, historical reasons, not least because there is such a large body of evidence to suggest that Japan (perhaps more than any other nation since South Africa during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1995) has made many and various attempts to demonstrate its penitence (its guilt or its shame?) about its treatment of its regional neighbors. Japan was certainly one of the key participants in what Wole Soyinka (the Nigerian Nobel Prize winner) has referred to as the "fin de millénaire fever for atonement" or what Seraphim calls the "explosion of memory productions" in the 1990s (p. 262). Of course, this is not to say that these attempts at openness or contrition have always (or even occasionally) been successful (the persistence of the impression that no such attempts have been made demonstrates their fail- ures). Instead, they call attention to the fact that one of the core problems in this area is not necessarily why Japan has failed to come to terms with its past but rather why the perception that it is uniquely incapable of doing so has managed to survive in the face of so much evidence to the contrary. There are any number of possible answers to this question, many of which are political in nature and have as much (if not more) to do with the fact that penitence (especially in the form of an apology) requires some form of reciprocation from the ostensible victims. This is the political force of forgiveness: the power to forgive or to withhold forgiveness, and hence the power to make an apology succeed or fail, does not lie with the penitent but with the wronged. Of course, there are various ways to encour- age the dispensing of forgiveness, such as the quality of the apology (or its apparent sincerity) or other more material inducements (such as financial aid or trade agreements), but ultimately forgiveness is not something Japan can give to itself (although this is another fascinating issue); it is at the mercy of its neighbors (and, of course, scholars of Japan studies). Hence, the question of why Japan is still seen as recalcitrant about its past must also be directed more reflexively toward the politics of those who judge its attempts at penitence. In this context, the contribution of Bruce Cumings to Ruptured Histories is particularly noteworthy; he draws our attention to the Nietzschean contrast between forgetting (as a device for the establish- ment of psychic order) and remembering (as a means to rupture that order), and he elaborates some of the ways in which the apparent forgetfulness of the Japanese is matched by deliberate acts of remembrance in South Korea. In one case the pain is repressed, and in the other the wound is repeatedly reopened so that the pain is not allowed to diminish. This process of de-nationalizing the issue runs against the tide of nation- centric approaches in Japan studies, but it is something tackled by both Sera- phim (especially in chapters 7 and 9) and the various contributors to Jager and Mitter's volume, who make very valuable contributions to this kind of debate by placing Japan's historical consciousness in the context of a wide</page><page sequence="3">Review Section 1 93 variety of other national and transnational experiences in Asia, not only with reference to World War II but also to the other conflicts that have afflicted the region in the long twentieth century. Jager and Mitter's innovative and valu- able book, which is unusually coherent and well constructed for an edited volume, maintains a critical commitment to the idea that there is no such thing as a singular or monolithic national memory. The editors and contribu- tors constantly quest to demonstrate the ways in which regional and trans- national public discourse destabilizes (or ruptures) all attempts at national control over memory production. With reference to World War II, which oc- cupies seven out of thirteen of the contributions to Ruptured Histories , Carol Gluck phrases the problem precisely: "The result [of attempting to build na- tional histories] was a memory of a world war with the world left out" (p. 48). The problem of the category of "nation" is deeply enmeshed in Japan studies (for obvious reasons), but it is also heavily implicated in the recent wave of work on memory that has been so important in various regional fields for the last decade or so. To some extent, this national bias evident in some forms of area studies works in complicity with memory studies to entrench often problematic conceptions of national guilt or denial. Indeed, the difference between memory and national history as modes of scholar- ship and activism tax a number of the authors under review here. Sera- phim dedicates part 3 of her book, "Changing Geographies of Memory," to such issues, although I would have preferred to see this at the start of the book. However, of particular note in this regard are the chapters by Gluck ("Operations of Memory: 'Comfort Women' and the World") and Harry D. Harootunian ("The Execution of Tosaka Jun and Other Tales: Historical Amnesia, Memory, and the Question of Japan's 'Postwar'") in Ruptured Histories , both of which problematize the conceptual terrain in which ques- tions of history, memory, and national consciousness are played out. Gluck's notion of "chronopolitics" is a notable contribution to this discussion as a refiguring of the politics of nationalized memoryscapes. One of the side effects of phrasing historical questions in terms of mem- ory is the risk of reinscribing the centrality of the nation as an autonomous agent, as though the nation itself can experience memory or other psycho- logical phenomena as well as simply being an object of historical inquiry. This kind of implication generates a human analogy that has been powerful and pervasive in the "fin de millénaire fever for atonement." The final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, for instance, describes how "the past left 'indelible scars' on the collective unconsciousness; these scars often concealed 'festering wounds'; these wounds must be 'opened up' for the 'cleansing and eventual healing' of the body politic."1 In other words, the memory paradigm facilitates the phrasing of this field into a lexicon 1. Stanley Cohen, States of Denial: Knowing about Atrocities and Suffering (Cam- bridge: Polity, 2001), p. 228.</page><page sequence="4">194 Journal of Japanese Studies 37:1(2011) of psychoanalysis that pathologizes national action. The nation is treated as a sick individual in need of therapy: split by the trauma of its historical memory, the nation retreats into a state of denial, where it paradoxically knows and does not know the horrors of its past.2 While this kind of approach opens up a rich and emotive language that helps us to talk about issues such as denial, repression, honesty, and sincerity on a national level, it also risks reducing such discussions into nonsense. As Michael Ignatieff has asked so pointedly: "do nations, like individuals, have psyches? Can a nation's past make a people ill as we know repressed memo- ries sometimes make individuals ill?"3 Turning to Stanley Cohen (among others), we see very clearly that "psychological concepts cannot simply be transposed to the political level.'4 To make such a transposition is to effect a deeply problematic conflation of individual, psychological trauma and suf- fering with that of political trauma and national pain. There are at least two very important consequences of this kind of psy- choanalytical strategy that has become so common. The first is that it is one of the conditions of the possibility for accusations that Japanese penitence is insincere; the second is that dis-consensus about historical consciousness in Japan is painted as a sign of national sickness or aberration, and hence it begins to shift the focus away from the need for Japan to appear sincere to its neighbors and redirect it toward the therapeutic need to be sincere to itself - Japan is recast as the principal victim of its own historical pathologies. In recent years, the (now notorious) critic Katõ Norihiro, who has ar- gued that contemporary Japan is suffering from a kind of schizophrenia, has elaborated these consequences rather dramatically. This schizophre- nia thesis, which enables accusations about the inauthenticity of Japan's postwar penitence by juxtaposing an allegedly superficial, surface perfor- mance of penitence against a deeply felt, hidden absence of guilt, inverts the historical and moral issue, transforming Japan into the principal victim of World War II and making attempts to come to terms with that war in the postwar period into attempts to heal and rebuild Japan itself. These kinds of narratives pathologize fragmented, contested, or splintered public opin- ion, as though debate in the public sphere were a sign of a sick rather than a healthy democratic polity, and hence they work in complicity with the nation-centered bias found in parts of the history and Japan studies fields to exceptionalize Japan. Indeed, one of Katõ Norihiro's most controversial as- sertions has been that Japan first needs to mourn its three million war dead before it can properly grieve (or atone) for Asia's 20 million dead. The idea 2. This paradox is central to the nature of denial: you cannot deny something that you do not know (at least on some level and with a certain level of suspicion). 3.

Cohen, States of Denial, p. 50.</page><page sequence="5">Review Section 195 is that Japanese society should reach a unified consensus on its own sense of self and historical consciousness before it can enact meaningful apologies as a (psychically) healthy and integrated agent.5 But, of course, a nation can never be such an agent. One of the major contributions of Franziska Seraphim's intricate and powerful book is to relegate this kind of irresponsible representation to prac- tical irrelevance - it simply has no place in the kind of social history that she practices. While not centrally concerned with questions of high theory, Ser- aphim's carefully detailed treatment of "social politics" directly confronts the homogenizing and personifying tendencies found in some of the "war memory" literature. In her introduction and especially in part 3 of her book, which traverses much of the landscape of postwar memory studies in a sure- footed way, Seraphim acknowledges that there is a plausible meaning to the charge that "Japan" has not adequately apologized, but she is careful to dif- ferentiate this meaning from any sense of anthropomorphism: she notes that the Japanese government (government qua nation) has not shown adequate leadership in the organization and performance of war memory, and hence that it has been left to multivarious groups within civil society to contest the meaning and content of these ostensibly national memories. The result has been the development of a multivocal domestic discourse (although she also notes that debate has tended to remain within the boundaries of specific groups rather than emerging between such groups on a genuinely national level). Hence, in addition to challenging national history from a transna- tional standpoint, Seraphim also (and more centrally) challenges it from a subnational perspective. National memory, here, becomes markedly differ- ent from individual memory as a phenomenon of historical consciousness. Seraphim's focus on special interest groups in the first part of her book, such as the Association of Shinto Shrines (chapter 1), the Japan Association of War-Bereaved Families (chapter 2), the Japan Teachers' Union (chapter 3), the Japan-China Friendship Association (chapter 4), and the Japan Memo- rial Society for the Students Killed in the War (chapter 6), works to reveal a range of antagonistic perspectives on questions of social and economic en- titlement in postwar Japan. In this way, Seraphim maps the transformations of the Japanese public sphere, demonstrating the problematic symbolism of being perceived as proximal to the state on the one hand or of abandoning allegiance to the postwar nation on the other. In this context, dealing with war memory necessarily involves the adoption of a standpoint regarding the responsibility and role of the state during the first half of the twentieth century but also a stance on the ways in which the relationship between the Japanese people and their state should be transformed (or not) in the 5. Katô's controversial views are elaborated in Haisengoron (Tokyo: Kõdansha, 1997) and Nihon no mushisõ (Tokyo: Heibonsha, 1999)</page><page sequence="6">196 Journal of Japanese Studies 37: 1 (201 1 ) postwar period. In part 1 of her book, Seraphim zooms in on the period between 1945 and 1955 in order to unpack these negotiations in fine detail during this pivotal (but often overlooked) period. This rich and impressive part of the book succeeds in demonstrating the close connection between the negotiation of war memory and the establishment of a democratic polity; rather than finding the lack of a monolithic "national" memory a symptom of national pathology, for Seraphim this contestation is a sign of the devel- opment of the kind of civil society essential for a modern democracy. Chapter 6 goes on to tackle some aspects of temporal change by focus- ing on the memory transitions occasioned by generational change in Japan after 1955; the theme of generational change is also tackled by Mitter with characteristic flair in the coeditori own contribution to Ruptured Histories , where he reveals how China's war of resistance against Japan has been remembered and re-remembered by different voices, in different locations, and across different generations in China. Hence, by the time Seraphim tackles "The Contested Rites of Official Memory" (chapter 8), which fo- cuses on more explicitly nationalized performances of memorialization, such as the Yasukuni controversy (but mysteriously circumnavigates the question of official memory production through history textbooks), the cen- trality of contestation itself and hence the deeply problematic and uneven nature of national memory has already powerfully been established. While Seraphim is also interested in the ways in which these national and subnational debates are affected by Japan's international environment, this international and transnational context is far more centrally the con- cern of Jager and Mitter, whose volume is therefore complementary. The reader is rewarded richly by reading these volumes in parallel. Indeed, one of the most powerful themes to arise from Ruptured Histories is its sustained attempt to wrestle the question of war memory away from its near-exclusive focus on the singular rupture represented by Japan's defeat in 1945 and to show how a number of other ruptures thereafter (includ- ing especially the end of the cold war and then 9/11) have also triggered new waves of historical memory in Asia. In particular, Jager and Mitter are keen to show how the continuously shifting international environment im- pacts the formation (and utility) of national (transnational and subnational) narratives; their volume reveals how new interpretations of the wartime past have been triggered by (for instance) the restructuring of U.S. relations with its allies in Asia since the 1990s. This focus on the role of power and international politics on the formation and reformation of war memory is innovative and valuable in itself, and it adds a great deal to the framework of analysis in this field. However, the question of how to prevent these kinds of insights from reducing war memory to an assertion of historical revi- sionism (which can run dangerously close to the assertion that a reliable record of past events is impossible) is not fully addressed here. Because of</page><page sequence="7">Review Section 1 97 this, a number of the most pressing and troubling questions about ethics and memory (or perhaps the ethics of historical memory) are sidestepped in favor of a more pragmatic emphasis on politics and memory. Perhaps we can hope for a companion volume focused on the ethics of war memory in the future. In sum, then, taken together these two admirable books represent an important reorientation of the field away from its conventional, problematic, nation-centered approach and toward a more multilayered and multivocal emphasis on the interactions between sub- and transnational factors in the codetermination of historical memory as a political force in Japan and Asia. Both take giant leaps beyond the now tedious (and often misphrased) ques- tion of why Japan has failed to come to terms with its role in World War II in Asia; I am hopeful that they open the door to a new, more interesting, and more responsible research agenda.</page></plain_text>
