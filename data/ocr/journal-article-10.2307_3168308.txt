<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Perspectives on the Origenist Controversy: Human Embodiment and Ascetic Strategies ELIZABETH A. CLARK The controversy over Origenism that erupted in the last years of the fourth century and the opening years of the fifth has puzzled many students of the period: no single identifiable theological issue seemed at stake. At the center of the Arian controversy lay a debate over the subordination (or nonsubordi- nation) of the Son to the Father; in the fifth-century christological disputes Jesus' "nature" or "natures" prompted disagreement. But what was the focus of the Origenist controversy: the subordination of the Son and the Holy Spirit to the Father? the "fall" of the rational creatures into bodies? the restoration of the Devil? the interpretation of resurrection from the dead? Although each of these suggestions has limited plausibility, none suffices. Indeed, some evidence casts doubt on whether the alleged errors of Origen's theology mattered much at all to the disputants: even the prosecutors, in the very heat of the controversy, appealed not just to Origen's scriptural erudition but also to questionable points of his speculation.' Moreover, many nontheo- logical issues loomed large in the debate, including questions of episcopal jurisdiction, disputes pertaining to the authorship of earlier treatises, and arguments about styles of translation.2 Such skirmishes make difficult for contemporary scholars the identification of the central battlefield. In addition, the extant evidence pertaining to the ties of kinship, friendship, mentorship, and patronage among the disputants is so abundant that a sociologist employing social network analysis could plausibly argue that no ideational 1.

One such theme concerns "the body." This theme, which achieved prominence during the debates over asceticism in the late fourth century, intersected the dispute over Origen in surprising ways. To be sure, previous attacks upon Origen, such as that waged by Methodius of Olympus early in the fourth century, had also focused on the notion of "the bodily" in Origen's theology, but for Methodius the status of the resurrection body was the contested point.4 Although the late fourth and early fifth-century assailants of Origenism still singled out Origen's teaching on the resurrection for criticism-a teaching that they misunderstood-the extensive development of ascetic theory and practice during the course of the fourth century had served to shift the anti-Origenist focus to themes of marriage, reproduction, and moral hierarchy based on degrees of ascetic renunciation.5 The body present, not the body future, now occupied the center of discussion. Concern about the body developed in the Origenist controversy at several decisive points. For one, theologies of the body based on Origenist and anti-Origenist views underlay the dispute over anthropomorphism that disturbed the inhabitants of the Egyptian desert in the closing years of the fourth century. For another, the anti-Origenist charges relating to marriage and reproduction that were levelled by Epiphanius of Salamis, Theophilus of Alexandria, and Jerome resonate with the arguments waged over asceticism a few years earlier. The issue feuling debate in Egypt-the issue that marks a distinctively "Egyptian" contribution to the Origenist controversy-concerned interpreta- tions of the "image of God": what was it, had humans lost it with the sin of Adam, and did the concept itself imply that God had human form? The latter 3. Using the formula provided by network analysts, I calculate the density of Rufinus's network at 78 percent and Jeromes's at 83 percent.

According to several fifth-century Christian writers-Socrates, Sozomen, and Palladius, all of whom sided with the alleged Origenists-the simple desert monks were outraged by Theophilus of Alexandria's Festal Letter of 399 that championed God's incorporeality, a position in accord with that of Alexandria's most important theologian, Origen.6 According to Socrates's account, the monks flocked to Alexandria, rioted, and even threatened to kill Theophilus for expressing such a misguided view. Theophilus, who needed monastic allies in the midst of other battles he was waging (including one to engineer John Chrysostom's downfall), promptly pacified the irate monks by telling them, "In seeing you, I behold the face of God." Since the notion of God's incorporeality had been backed by appeals to Origen, the monks asked Theophilus to anathematize Origen's books, a request to which Theophilus readily acceded. Theophilus next sent letters to the monastic communites of the desert, instructing their inhabitants to affirm, in agreement with a literal reading of Scripture, that God had bodily parts. Warming to more direct action, Theophilus led a "multitude" to Nitria, armed the Anthropomorphite monks, and routed those who stubbornly persisted in confessing God's incorporeality.7 The Nitrian monastic commu- nities were thus supposedly purged of Origen's supporters, including the erudite and ascetic Tall Brothers, who according to Socrates were singled out for Theophilus's wrath because they had refused to cooperate in Theophilus's shady management of church finances.8 The Tall Brothers fled to Palestine and then to Constantinople, where their cause became entwined with that of John Chrysostom.9 From Socrates, Sozomen, and Palladius we would infer that theology mattered little in these events and that the few theological details mentioned were raised as a "cover" for Theophilus's avaricious and self-serving behavior. But is it the case that no geniunely theological issues underlay this disturbing and violent episode? I think not: both John Cassian (who claims to have been present when Theophilus's Festal Letter of 399 was received at Scete) and an anonymous Coptic document that records an alleged debate between Theophilus and a monk named Aphou report that a controversy over 6.

That Origenism did not disappear from the Egyptian desert with their departure is revealed in fragments of two letters by Theophilus, preserved in Justinian's Liber adversus Origenem (PG 86:967), one dated from the summer of 400 and the second from late 400 or early 401 on the issue of Origenist monks still present. 147</page><page sequence="4">CHURCH HISTORY the phrase "the image of God"-and its implications for the corporeality or incorporeality of God-was at the center of the disturbances in 399.10 According to Cassian, Theophilus's Festal Letter of 399 was directed against the Anthropomorphites. Many of the monks, he reports, became agitated at Theophilus's reference to God's incorporeality, since "in their simplicity" they believed that God had human form: if we were created in "God's image," as Genesis 1 claims, did not God have human shape and characteristics? Cassian adds the revealing detail that three of the four priests serving the churches at Scete opposed Theophilus's anti-Anthropomorphite teaching; only the priest of the congregation to which Cassian was attached, Paphnutius, affirmed the incorporeality of God. Some of the monks, says Cassian, expressed shock at the "novelty" of Theophilus's opinion.11 Although Cassian probably here represents the anti-Origenists in a negative light, his testimony nonetheless suggests that one aspect of the debate focused on the relation between human embodiment and the nature of the divine. A second source providing clues about the theological dimensions of the Anthropomorphite debate is an anonymous Coptic document published in 1883 and republished, with a French translation, by Etienne Drioton in 1915 to 1917.12 The text concerns the life of Aphou, an Egyptian monk from Oxyrhinchus (Pemdje) in Upper Egypt, who three years after the event described was reputedly raised to the episcopal throne by Theophilus.13 The document tells of the reception given Theophilus's anti-Anthropomorphite Festal Letter of 399 at Pemdje. The anonymous author of this text construes the situation differently than does Cassian, stressing that Theophilus recanted his early anti-Anthropomorphite view out of conviction, not political expedience, and that Theophilus's "conversion" was effected by the monk Aphou. The text reports that it was Aphou's custom to journey from his monastic retreat to the town of Pemdje once a year to hear the paschal letter from the bishop of Alexandria read aloud to the congregation. When Theophilus's letter of 399 was read, Aphou in distress heeded an angel's summons to undertake a trip to Alexandria to correct the bishop. For three days Aphou stood at Theophilus's door before he gained an audience. Upon being admitted, Aphou told Theophilus his reasons for disagreement and speedily convinced him of his error in imagining that humans had lost God's "image." The repentant Theophilus wrote to "every region" to repudiate his earlier 10.

Aphou graciously refrained from blaming Theophilus directly: it was rather the Devil's ploy to let the bishop scandalize the faithful so that they would give no heed to the rest of his "holy teaching." By Theophilus's retraction, the anonymous author of the text claims, the Devil was foiled and a praiseworthy example of episcopal humility was provided by Theophilus's admission of error.14 Although the historicity of this dialogue is patently dubious, several points of the tale command our interest. For one, the author has shifted the focus away from a discussion of whether God does or does not possess a corporeal form. He never replies to Theophilus's ridicule of the gross anthropomor- phism of Aphou's supporters.15 On either account, however, human embodi- ment in relation to the divine is at issue. That this intra-Christian struggle over "the image of God" was waged against the background of the attempted demolition of Egyptian paganism- an iconoclastic campaign aimed to eradicate Eygptian image worship ("idola- try") that issued most notably in the destruction of the Serapeum in Alexandria-is probably no accident."6 A theology of iconoclasm had been conveniently provided by the Origenist ascetic Evagrius Ponticus during this same period, and it is to his anti-iconic theology, with its implications for "bodiliness," that I wish now to turn. No other surviving texts from the period so well illuminate the relationship between concepts of divine incorporeality, human embodiment, and ascetic praxis as do Evagrius's writings. Among the monks of the Egyptian desert during the 390s, Evagrius Ponticus was the chief expositor of God's utter incorporealty and the eradication of God's "image" in humans. Student in his youth of the Cappadocian Fathers, Evagrius was the friend and confidant of Rufinus of Aquileia and Melania the Elder, who had rescued him for the ascetic life during his sojourn in Jerusalem.17 Despite his now-recognized importance, Evagrius became the subject of intensive scholarly investigation only in the last forty to fifty years. Although some small part of his writings survives in 14. Ibid.; pp. 95-96; 96-100; 114-115. 15. See the course of the debate in Drioton, "La Discussion," pp. 97-100, 113, 127. 16.

When Antoine Guillaumont discovered and published a second version of the work, proving that it was closer to the original and more in accord with Evagrian texts such as the so-called Letter to Melania, scholars realized that the Kephalaia Gnostica was a chief source spurring Origen's condemnation by the Fifth Ecumenical Council in 553.19 What aspects of Evagrius's theology illuminate the debate over anthropo- morphitism? For Evagrius, no concepts drawn from the human sphere and expressed in language can describe the perfection of God. Neither quality nor quantity can define the Divine: it is preferable to admit that God can in no way be comprehended by the human mind than to introduce the possibility of "failure" into the notion of God.20 As Evagrius phrased it, a defective concept cannot convey to humans the divine perfection.21 Thus, as might be expected, he and other Origenists developed an allegorical interpretation that "spiri- tualized" Biblical anthropomorphisms-and "de-historicized" Scripture as a whole. His emphasis on incorporeality links Evagrius's teaching about God to that regarding the origin and destiny of humans. Just as the original Godhead was "naked" (gymnos) and received "clothing" only with the Incarnation, so likewise the minds, before their precosmic "fall," had been "naked"; only when they became involved in the "movement" (Evagrius's word for the 18.

Although Evagrius holds that it is blasphemy to speak badly of the body, he nonetheless believes that bodies must be discarded before the nous can see the "incorporeals." Thus when he speaks of a "resurrection body," the phrase indicates for him only the first of two transformations after death. To gain once more "the image of the Son," humans must at the end cast off bodies entirely: bodies will ultimately be destroyed, not just transformed.25 That this aspect of Evagrius's theology was too radical for many Christians is shown by the haste with which it was modified and "softened" within the Syriac tradition and abandoned totally in the Greek and Latin-speaking worlds.26 Evagrius's view that the original creation of rational beings was incorpo- real found a correlate in an ethical teaching of radically ascetic implication. Since at the creation humans lacked bodies, Evagrius argues, they also lacked the affective traits of thumos (anger) and epithumia (desire).27 But when the mind fell, it ceased to be in "the image of God" and voluntarily took on "the image of animals." Now it shares with the animals the movements of the body; in fact, the soul renders the "animal" body even worse by introducing it to pride, vainglory, and avarice. Only one creature has preserved God's true "image," capable of knowing the Father, and this is the incarnate Son, whose divine nature remains one of "naked nous."28 At the end, God will make humans resemble "the image of his Son" (Romans 8:29).29 The regaining of God's "image" will thus occur only when humans live once more as "naked 22.

But if the "image of God" no longer remains in embodied humans, what is all too present for them, according to Evagrius, is the superabundance of images that crowd the human mind. It is these images or "thoughts" (logismoi) that arouse our passions and separate humans from God.30 The logismoi can arise from sense experience, from memory, from phantasies, or dreams-and also from demonic temptation: the demons who stimulate the logismoi are, significantly, called "idol-makers" by Evagrius.31 The "images" they suggest must be eradicated in the quest for holiness. The battle against "idols" is thus relocated from the streets of Alexandria to the minds of Christian ascetics: asceticism, in Evagrius's theology, becomes the ultimate iconoclastic device and the ultimate aid that helps humans to recover "the image of God." More than any of his predecessors, Evagrius was responsible for construct- ing an "internalized" and "mental" understanding of sin through his elaboration of the logismoi. Indeed, the medieval notion of the "seven deadly sins" was derived, through Cassian, from Evagrius's teaching on the "eight evil thoughts."32 Evagrius provides a rationale for the ordering of the "thoughts" that shows their interconnection.33 From the first three "thoughts" (gluttony, lust, and avarice) stem all the others. Since gluttony leads to lust, the monastic regimen counsels the limitation of food and drink in an effort to curb sexual desire.34 From avarice (the desire for things) stems anger (presumably piqued when we don't possess them and others do), or pride (when we do possess them).35 Not only do demons, memory, and dreams all conspire to call up images that cause the monk to lust, covet, or rage; even more disturbing, the demons are able to present "thoughts" as if they were something good and beautiful.36 Thus the demon of avarice leads the monk to believe that he should 30.

The demon of vainglory urges him to lead a crowd of brothers and sisters to the monastic life. And worst of all is the demon of pride, who stimulates him to believe that he is the cause of any good he may do: even helping others thus becomes a danger to the monk's salvation.39 Against such demonic wiles the monk must arm himself. This he can do in several ways. For one, he should mount a verbal attack, equipping himself with scriptural verses to hurl at the demons when they assault him, after the fashion of Jesus' response to the Tempter.40 In addition to providing scriptural quotations that will mar the artistry of the demons' illusions, Evagrius advises a strict ascetic discipline to help the monk resist temptation: asceticism becomes the means to break the power of images. Fasting and the limitation of water is essential, and this to the time of death.41 (Evagrius reports about himself that he ate once a day.)42 The monk's profession, according to Evagrius, requires that he never take to fullness bread, water, or sleep.43 Restriction of eating and drinking contributes to the monk's reduced sexual desire and to fewer "evil dreams" while he sleeps.44 Restriction on food also has another "medico-moral" benefit: by preventing the accumulation of bile it helps the monk to control anger.45 In addition to the limitation of food and water, toil, solitude, and vigils are also recommended for the quenching 37.

Indeed, the quest for apatheia is practical and surprisingly low on the scale of Evagrian virtues. Nonetheless, all passion must be rooted out before the higher goals of knowledge and contemplation can be achieved.48 A great achievement is the ability to pray "purely." By "pure prayer" Evagrius means an act of worship-really, an act of contemplation-in which all "thoughts" and concepts are banished from the mind, which becomes "like light" in an intense, imageless contemplation of the Godhead.49 Antoine Guillaumont has intriguingly suggested that Evagrius's advocacy of "pure prayer," devoid of all mental forms, may have been the original incitement to debate among the monks in Egypt over anthropomorphism and "the image of God" in the 390s.50 Thus for Evagrius the Origenist claim that God's utter incorporeality could not be "imaged"-either by human minds or in human natures-was inextricably linked to an ascetic regimen whose aim was to free the mind of all images which, by definition, obscure the vision of God: an iconoclasm directed at mental images is here matched by an ascetic assault on the human body and a literary assault on those who would ascribe "bodiliness" to God. Debates over divine and human corporeality thus underlie the Egyptian wing of the Origenist controversy. A second set of issues regarding "the body" that surfaced in the Origenist debate is found in the charges against Origenism levelled by Epiphanius of Salamis, Theophilus of Alexandria, and Jerome. As they developed their arguments, both Epiphanius and Theophilus came increasingly to focus on the issue of Origenism's implications for procreation. Jerome provides an instructive contrast to Epiphanius and Theophilus. Not wishing to undercut his own ardently ascetic stance by attacking Origenist asceticism, Jerome nonetheless imports to the controversy the notion of a hierarchy of merit based on degrees of renunciation, a notion that he had espoused during the debates over asceticism in the 380s and 390s. Thus even though Jerome never enthused about the goodness of "the body" as did Epiphanius and Theophi- lus, he nevertheless found the thesis on moral hierarchy that he had crafted during his battles over asceticism useful in combatting the highly egalitarian 46.

To this second link of the Origenist controversy with the ascetic debates I now turn. Epiphanius of Salamis, best known for his presentation and criticism of various ancient heresies, stands as the first anti-Origenist polemicist in the late fourth-century branch of the war on Origen. In his two early works, the Ancoratus and the Panarion, written in the mid-370s, Epiphanius claims that Trinitarian issues worry him deeply, that "Ariomaniacs" are the worst heretics. Thus it comes as no surprise that he roundly attacks Origen's subordination of the Son to the Father.51 Despite his claim, Epiphanius is less concerned with Trinitarian issues than he professes.52 Already in the 370s the major line of his assault pertains to issues of materiality as they manifest themselves in discussions of the body and of allegorical exegesis. For example, Epiphanius faults Origen for not emphasizing the historical reality of the stories of creation and the first sin in Genesis or the physical identity of the resurrection body with present human flesh.53 Likewise in chapter sixty-four of the Panarion, devoted to the errors of Origen, it is issues pertaining to the body that occupy him most fully (although Epiphanius criticizes Origen's subordinationist theology).54 Here he centers on Origen's view of the fall of souls into bodies, especially on his interpretation of the "tunics of skin" that God gave Adam and Eve in Genesis 3 as "bodies."55 Epiphanius also attacks Origen's position on the resurrection body, borrowing extensively from Methodius's earlier critique of Origen. Both Methodius and Epiphanius refute Origen's claim that a "corporeal form" (eidos) surviving death constitutes a doctrine of "resurrection"; rather, they interpret Origen- somewhat uncharitably-to teach that nothing remains of our bodily nature.56 Epiphanius's concern for "bodiliness" reaches its height only in 394, the year in which the debate over Origen was heating up in Palestine. Epiphan- ius himself had fanned the flames by making a not-too-veiled attack upon John of Jerusalem for his alleged Origenism.57 In a letter of 394 to John Epiphanius raises several of his earlier concerns pertaining to the body: the preexistence of souls and their fall into materiality, the physicality of the 51.

But to these concerns Epiphanius adds a new charge which is of interest to our argument: Origen's alleged deprecation of the body implies that reproduction is evil. What, Epiphanius asks, would become of God's blessing on Adam, Noah, and their offspring ("Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth" [Gen. 1:28; 9:7]) if the soul were shut in the body as in a tomb, as Epiphanius thinks Origen taught? Did God have to wait for angels to sin in heaven before multiplying humans on earth, he scornfully inquires?58 Why, we might ask, was Epiphanius now worried about the issue of reproduction in 394 when he did not express such concerns in his earlier attacks, either upon Origen's teaching or upon that of the heretically ascetic Manicheans or Hieracites? Why did he not use the "reproduce and multiply" text against such groups when he wrote the Panarion ?59 Given his earlier silence, why in 394 did Eiphanius think that these verses were central to the refutation of an Origenist denigration of reproduction? The answer, I think, lies in the ascetic debates whose fireworks lit up the early 390s. In 393 Jerome had engaged in a heated dispute with Jovinian on questions regarding asceticism. The central scriptural quotations that framed their long literary debate were Genesis 2:24 (that the two shall become "one flesh," ratified by Jesus in Matthew 19:5) and Genesis 1:28 and 9:1 ("reproduce and multiply"). Jovinian had argued that God's blessing not just on Adam and Eve at creation but also on Noah, his wife, his sons, and their wives after the Flood showed that even human sinfulness could not eradicate the goodness of reproduction.60 These verses are precisely the ones that Epiphanius notes in his letter to John of Jerusalem.6" Yet we must ask how probable it is that Epiphanius, in Cyprus, knew about Jerome's literary debate with Jovinian? Unfortunately, all of Jerome's letters written between 387 and 393, the very years in which he might have penned complaints to Epiphanius and other friends about views like Jovinian's, are lost. Hence we have no epistolary evidence for this period. We do know, however, that Epiphanius visited Palestine in 394 and had contact with Jerome's monastery: recall that he had ordained Jerome's brother Paulinianus, who was a monk in Jerome's Bethlehem establish- ment.62 That Epiphanius in 394 knew about the debate that had recently raged between Jerome and Jovinian thus seems likely. The Genesis verses had been central to the controversy between Jerome and Jovinian. Jerome had been hot with anger at Jovinian's insinuation that his ascetic fervor, with its alleged degradation of reproduction, verged on 58.

I know that God's first commandment was 'Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth' " -an assertion that he then undercuts by arguing the superiority of virginity to even "honorable marriage." Yet Jerome as well as Jovinian could manipulate Genesis for his own purposes: he points out to his readers that Adam and Eve were virgins in Paradise before the Fall and that marriage entered human life only when they were expelled from Eden.63 It is likely, I think, that Epiphanius had registered, via Jerome's debate, that the Genesis texts must be used as central exegetical strategies for any argument about embodiment and reproduction. Epiphanius's appeal to Genesis stems not from antiquarian interests but from the religious concerns of his own day. The same pattern of argumentation can be found in the writings of Theophilus of Alexandria against Origenism. These writings-some of which are extant in Jerome's Latin translation and some, preserved fragmen- tarily in Greek, or in Syriac and Armenian translations-are an especially interesting source because we can see Theophilus's main points of attack shift even in the short period between 400 and 404. We can readily note through a perusal of Theophilus's letters how rapidly the archbishop lost interest in battling Origenism-a point also noted by his contemporaries, who used it to claim that his polemic against Origenism was not entirely sincere.64 In letters dating from 400 through 403 Theophilus's charges against Origen are similar to those levelled by Epiphanius: that Origen subordinated the Son to the Father, taught the restoration of the Devil, denied the resurrection of the dead, and affirmed a precosmic fall of souls.65 Yet even as early as 401, one year after he wrote his first anti-Origenist text now extant, Theophilus had hit upon the implications of Origen's views for a theology of marriage and reproduction, and these he pressed to fault contemporary Origenism. Theophilus reasons that if bodies could not have existed without souls first sinning in heaven and being cast down, chained to the "penitentiary" (ergastulum) of the body, marriage must be condemned. How could marriage be "honorable" and "immaculate" (Hebrews 13:4), Theophilus argues, if the soul becomes enclosed in a body only after it is stained with sin? Hannah, the 63.

When "Moses" foretold that God would multiply the Israelites a thousand times (Deut. 1:10-11), are we to imagine that "crowds of souls in the heavens" were obliged to sin in order for the Israelite race to be established? How could David have said that to see your children's children is a blessing (Psalm 128:5-6) if souls must err in order to increase the family line?66 To these questions Theophilus thinks Origenism provides no good reply. Theophilus next develops the argument that Epiphanius had raised in his letter to John of Jerusalem in 394: the "reproduce, multiply, and fill the earth" commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve (Gen. 1:28) would be no blessing if souls had to sin and be sent down to earth in order for bodies to be born. Instead, the command would entail a curse, and such a supposition is contradicted by the implication in Genesis that a curse came upon humans only after they sinned in Eden by their own volition. According to Theophi- lus, God has constituted the nature of the human body directly; it does not originate through the sin of souls. Origen and all "apocryphal Scriptures," Theophilus concludes, are to be rejected by believing Christians.67 By the time of his Festal Letter of 404, composed just three years later, the only point of Origenist theology that concerns Theophilus is reproduction: there is no other topic of Origenist theology that he chooses to debate. Theophilus's argument in 404 proceeds from a consideration of biblical passages. Why would "Paul" have urged young people to marry and procreate (1 Tim. 5:14) if bodies are prisons for "angels" (that is, souls) who fell from heaven? Marriage would be the result of the punishment of souls, not means for the creation of bodies. "Reproduce and multiply" (Gen. 1:28) was meant as a blessing and was reinforced by "Paul" in Hebrews 13:4 ("Marriage is honorable and the nuptial bed without stain"). The purpose of bodily reproduction, according to Theophilus, is to compensate for death by a succession of births. If the souls sinned in Heaven, they certainly did not deserve a blessing but rather a punishment. When the prophet Isaiah (60:22) wrote, "The least shall be in the thousands and the smallest, a great nation," his prediction of an increase of population was meant to signal God's favor.68 The discovery (and publication in 1975) of Greek fragments from letters that Theophilus probably wrote from Constantinople in 403 confirms his preoccupation with reproduction as an issue on which Origenists could be 66.

Once again, Theophilus notes the drastic consequences of such a view for a theology of reproduction. On Origen's thesis why would woman have been created? How could reproduction have occurred if souls had not erred? To the contrary, Genesis teaches us that God "made them male and female, and blessed them, saying, 'Reproduce, multiply, and fill the earth' " (Gen. 1:28). How could these words have conveyed a blessing if the manner of production of bodies involved a fall of sinful souls from heaven?70 This is, of course, the same argument that Theophilus had mounted in 401, assuming central importance in his letter of 404.71 The new Greek fragments of Theophilus's letters thus confirm the thesis that his earlier charges of Trinitarian and other errors recede, while contemporary issues about the body gain in importance for his anti-Origenist argument. Theophilus, like Epiphanius before him, moved increasingly to a polemic that centered on issues of the body and reproduction. What about Jerome? Since he had earlier devoted himself to translating Origen's scriptural commentaries and homilies and to incorporating these teachings into his own writings, Jerome himself was in a dubious position after the attacks upon Origenism became heated. He found, to his surprise and annoyance, that he had to defend himself against charges of Origenist- sympathizing-charges that Rufinus was only too happy to press.72 It took until 396 for Jerome to register that he, too, was implicated in Origenism: in a letter to Vigilantius dated that same year, Jerome distances himself from four errors of Origen ("I anathematize Origen daily," he informs Vigilantius).73 But Jerome's subsequent attack on Origen assumes a different coloration than those of Epiphanius and Theophilus, and this difference can be explained by Jerome's differing role in the ascetic debates of the previous two decades. In the 380s and 390s Jerome had made himself the most vocal champion in the West of the virginal life. So derogatory were his comments on marriage in his book Against Jovinian that his Roman friend Pammachius had removed copies of the work from circulation, for the book's antimarital sentiments had shocked Roman Christians.74 Given these radically ascetic views, now deeply 69.

Rather, he employed a different argument, but one, interestingly enough, that he had elaborated during his campaign against Jovinian a few years earlier. The position he had developed during the debates over asceticism found new expression here. During the controversy with Jovinian, Jerome had advanced a theory that rewards in heaven would be sharply differentiated, based on one's level of ascetic renunciation. Likewise, there would be grades of punishment in hell. Recall Jovinian's position: all the baptized are of equal merit whether they be virgins, widows, or the married, if they are equal in other respects, and that there is only one reward in heaven for those who keep their baptismal vows. Against Jovinian, Jerome piles up his metaphors of differentiation: of gold, silver, and hay; of grain, stalk, and ears; of hundredfold, sixtyfold, thirtyfold harvests. On Jovinian's premise, complains Jerome, whoremongers would be equal in heaven to virgins, a view Jerome finds shocking despite his continued assertion that the church pardons all the penitent, even whoremongers. Pardon, however, does not mean that all will have the same recompense. Jerome applies Paul's claim that various "gifts" will have their different "rewards" (see 1 Cor. 7:7, 12:4-11) to the varying ascetic statuses of Christians. Baptism does not erase the difference between virgins and harlots, despite the Christian confession that all become "new men" in baptism. Jovinian's opinion should be faulted, for on it the telling of an ordinary fib would send one to the same "outer darkness" inhabited by those guilty of parricide.75 Jovinian's view, that there are only two categories, the saved and the damned, is assessed by Jerome as more akin to the philosophy of the Old Stoics than to that of Christians, and he devotes most of Book Two of the Adversus Jovinianum to its refutation. When Jovinian quotes Matthew 25 on the twofold division between sheep and the goats, Jerome reminds him (and his readers) that there is a great difference between one sheep and another. In fact, Jerome takes gradation in the afterlife as a necessary proposition for the defense of God's justice, since, he claims, it would be unfair for God to assign the same reward for unequal merits. The whole truth is not taught by the passage on the sheep and the goats, or on that concerning the wise and the foolish virgins. Other biblical references need to be recalled, and Jerome offers suggestions: Jesus' words on the greatest and the least in the Kingdom (Matt. 20:26-27) or on the diverse number of talents that the master gave his 75.

His interpretation of these passages, contra Jovinian, solidified the argument he used soon thereafter to combat the Origenist view that all rational beings will eventually be restored to their primeval unity and goodness. One passage useful to Jerome is the parable of the laborers in the vineyard. Jovinian had noted that all the laborers received the same reward: one penny. No differentiation was made, despite the different lengths of time they had worked. Jerome interprets the parable differently: the one penny means only that the laborers will all arrive at one heaven; the emphasis of the parable lies in their varying calls.77 Jerome posits here the theme of one afterlife, with gradation within it, the same view he later pressed against the Origenist notion of the apokatastasis, the restoration of all things to their primeval unity. A second passage that Jerome appropriated during his debate with Jovinian recounts Jacob's vision at Bethel in which the angels ascend and descend the ladder. According to Jerome, we are to believe that all the angels on the ladder are saved, are among the "sheep," although they are on higher and lower rungs. Only those angels who have descended completely off the ladder are among the "goats." Does Jovinian imagine that angels who have so descended (the "goats") will receive their inheritance?78 Jerome's question to Jovinian is striking, because it concerns the exact problem Jerome faced in the Origenist controversy regarding the restoration or the nonrestoration of the Devil. When Jerome, against Jovinian, replied "no," that the descended angels will not receive their inheritance, he had formulated the answer he would give eight or nine years later against Origenism. Jerome's passion to preserve strict hierarchy both on earth and in heaven reappears only a few years after his debate with Jovinian, even before he realized that he was vulnerable to attack as an Origenist. Already by 396, in his Commentary on Jonah, Jerome appropriates the views on moral hierar- chy based on degrees of ascetic renunciation that he developed in the controversy with Jovinian for his new attack upon Origenism.79 He focuses on the issue of the restoration of the Devil. He asks, if all "rational creatures" including the Devil are to be raised to the same heavenly dignity, what grounds for distinction will there be between virgins and prostitutes, between 76.

"Will Gabriel be like the devil? will the apostles be the same as demons? prophets and false prophets? martyrs and persecutors?" Even if the Origenist proponents were to argue that it will take infinite ages for the final restitution to equality to occur, for them the end is nevertheless eventually the same for all; and if so, Jerome retorts, our actions here and now do not count. A biblical commen- tary is not the place to argue at length against this "perverse teaching," he claims. Nonetheless, Jerome is enraged by those (John of Jerusalem? Rufinus?) who affirm such beliefs in private but who deny them in public.80 Likewise, in works written at the turn of the fifth century Jerome reinforces this point, arguing against the view that virgins and repentant prostitutes will receive the same heavenly reward, or that the Devil will flourish in the same ranks as the Cherubim and the Seraphim.81 On such grounds it would not even matter if we were pagans or Jews rather than Christians! Moreover, Jerome argues, Origen's notion that new falls may result in souls being reclad with bodies renders dubious the maintenance of proper ranking of men over women and virgins over prostitutes.82 Instead of Evagrius's vision of the equality of disembodied minds, Jerome favors a hierarchy of bodies. Thus the issue of hierarchy, forged in the ascetic debates of the 380s and refined in his controversy with Jovinian, resonates throughout Jerome's anti-Origenist polemic. Jerome was still, in the midst of the Origenist debate, fighting a Western controversy over asceticism when he insisted that moral hierarchy based on ascetic renunciation must be preserved and gradations of status in the afterlife upheld. Unlike his allies Epiphanius and Theophilus, who enlisted a pro-reproduction argument against Origenists, ascetic renun- ciation stands at the center of Jerome's religious concern. As Peter Brown has recently phrased it, the "limitless fluidity of the human person" that Jerome understood to be the center of Origen's thought ran up against beliefs he cherished even more deeply, such as the maintenance of hierarchy both here and hereafter, measured by degrees of bodily renunciation.83 For Jerome- indeed, for all the disputants-human embodiment remained a problem for theological speculation as well as for Christian praxis. The ascetic debate, I propose, was not displaced by the Origenist contro- versy: it was subsumed within it. 80. Jerome, In Ionam (CCL 76:407-408, on Jonah 3:6-9). 81.
