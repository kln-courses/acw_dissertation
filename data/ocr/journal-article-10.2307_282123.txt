<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ethnohistory. Within this interdisciplinary approach, there is a great emphasis on the iconography (papers by Laporte and Fialko, Freidel, Coggins, Schele), and at least in one case (Freidel) it is demonstrated in great detail how the ancient Maya symbols (in this case, the Jester god) changed and transformed over the time, with different cultural implications for the social or- ganization from Preclassic into Postclassic. While the image might stay the same, its context and meaning significantly shift over the longer periods of time. Preparing publications based on conferences is very often connected with the risk that some or most of the contributions will be out-of-date by the date that the book becomes available to the general public (in this case, more than four years have passed since the con- ference, and two years since the book was actually fin- ished in April of 1991!). However, the editors, con- tributors, and the publisher did a great job by updating some contributions in the process, so that as a final product we have a nicely printed (with a lot of draw- ings, architectural reconstructions, and site plans) and very useful summary of the work in the last decade, but also a book that can pose questions for future re- search. Vision and Revision is certainly open to criti- cism and revision(s), but right now, it is without any doubt the best book on Maya studies. The New World Figurine Project, Vol. 1. TERRY STOCKER, editor. Research Press, Provo, Utah, 1991. vi + 165 pp., figures, tables, references. $23.00 (cloth) Reviewed by James A. Chiarelli, Brandeis University, and The Center for Field Research, Watertown, Mas- sachusetts. In the editorial introduction to this volume, Terry Stocker takes note of the fact that figurines, when men- tioned in archaeological site reports, are often classified as a "minor artifact category." Anthropomorphic, zo- omorphic, and other kinds of figurines are known from many archaeological contexts throughout the world, but it would be safe to say that the attention such materials receive from scholars is disproportionately small when measured against their ubiquity in the archaeological record. Figurines constitute a potentially significant ar- chaeological data base that is at once enticing in its size and variability and forbidding in light of the per- ceived limitations of currently available interpretive frameworks. This first volume of a projected multi- volume series presents 13 papers by authors who, for the most part, approach the study of figurines from New World sites in fairly traditional ways and in most- ly descriptive terms. Stocker, again in the introduction, states that "the primary goal of the New World Fig- urine Project is description," and descriptions are pri- marily what the contributors have delivered. Three of the 13 articles focus on methodological or theoretical issues. There is one article on preceramic figurines from Aspero, Peru, and one on Mississippian figurines. Two concern figurines from the northwestern United States, two are on Valdivia figurines, and the remaining four present figurine data from mesoamer- ican sites. Since it is impossible to summarize every article in this collection, I will mention five that stand out due to the authors' attempts to move beyond description and toward some interpretive or processual explana- tion of their materials. David Grove's and Susan Gil- lespie's 1987 article (reprinted from Archaeology) con- cludes that many of the more than 4,000 figurine fragments recovered at the central Mexican site of Chalcatzingo represent portraits of deified Middle For- mative rulers. Joanne Mack concludes that the geo- graphical and cultural distribution of realistically ren- dered Late Archaic zoomorphic figurines from the western Cascades is indicative of complex trade net- works among upland groups as early as A.D. 1000. William Fowler examines figurines from the site of Cihuatan, El Salvador, and evidence of a Postclassic incursion by Pipil immigrants from Mexico. Kevin Smith considers the potential roles of figurine analysis and ethnographic analogy in determining the nature of Mississippian social organization, mortuary practices, and religious-symbolic behavior. Lastly, Terry Stocker closes the volume with an unabashedly diffusionist ap- preciation of certain aspects of New World prehistory including the now-legendary Valdivia-Jomon problem and the possibility that "Olmec sailors" mounted trad- ing expeditions among the peoples of the American southeast. This article will undoubtedly draw fire from his colleagues. The New World Figurine Project is a handsomely produced, large-format volume with ample and infor- mative illustrations. Several typographical errors and what appears to be an inconsistent editorial hand give the book as a whole a somewhat uneven quality. Nev- ertheless, it is a welcome contribution to New World archaeology, and we should look forward to future vol- umes. Mechanics of Pre-industrial Technology. BRIAN COT- TERELL and JOHAN KAMMINGA. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990. xv + 325 pp., figures, tables, appendixes, references, index. $49.50 (cloth). Reviewed by Phillip de Barros, Stanton, California. This is the first general review of the mechanics of preindustrial technology and represents the joint efforts of an engineer (Brian Cotterell) and an archaeologist (Johan Kamminga). The book's purpose is to present the basic principles of mechanics and show how they help us understand the artifacts and technological pro- cesses of ancient and traditional cultures. The authors see several benefits to providing a mechanical per- spective to the discipline of archaeology. First, by fo- cusing on the mechanical processes of artifacts, ar- chaeologists can better understand which attributes are functional (especially in mechanical terms) and which are stylistic. Such a mechanical base should lead to better typologies of material culture, which have often been based on a mixture of functional and stylistic attributes (e.g., projectile-point typologies). The authors also see mechanical data as useful for reconstructing culture histories, measuring material development, understanding human adaptation to the environment, and for developing theories of culture 592 [Vol. 58, No. 3, 1993]</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS change, including a "robust theory of the evolution of material culture" (p. 6). The study of mechanics in archaeology is in its in- fancy. The data base for mechanical analyses of ma- terial culture is limited to some basic research done in previous centuries. It needs to be updated through a combination of archival research, mathematical mod- eling, and replicative or model experiments. More in- formation is needed about the properties of the natural materials used to make artifacts, studies often not un- dertaken by modern industry, as these materials lack commercial value. Archaeologists and ethnologists need to collect a wide range of everyday traditional artifacts and to record their attributes with mechanical princi- ples in mind. The book is organized into 10 chapters and an Ep- ilogue. The Introduction briefly discusses invention and diffusion, theories of cultural evolution, artifact com- plexity, the development of mechanical science, and the mechanics of material culture. The most interesting issue concerns the mosaic pattern of adoption of tech- nological phenomena by various cultures. The authors discuss how cultural inertia, religious beliefs, economic and technological factors, and patterns of the physical and biological environment may lead to highly differ- ential patterns of adoption. They note that there is no unilinear sequence in the evolution of material culture and technology. Chapter 2 focuses on basic mechanics. It discusses space and time, mass, force, the laws of motion, the primary sources of force in preindustrial technology, scalars and vectors, acceleration, work and energy, power, and equilibrium and stability. These concepts are presented without excessive mathematics and fre- quently within interesting historical contexts from the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and China. The sec- tions on human and animal power and on waterwheels are particularly interesting. Chapter 3 deals with fluids and solids. The fluids portion focuses on the concepts of pressure, motion, and viscosity, and contains interesting discussions of the siphon and Egyptian water clocks. The accuracy of these clocks is evaluated using historical and mechan- ical data. The section on solids discusses stress and strength, deformation and strain, stress-strain relation- ships, and the concept of resilience. Useful data on the mechanical properties of some typical materials are presented. Chapter 4 discusses "machines" used in its original sense. These include the lever (and its derivatives, the beam press and the balance), the inclined plane, the pulley, the winch and capstan, the screw, the gear wheel, and the wedge. The basic value of these machines in antiquity was "their ability to amplify human muscle force," i.e. their "mechanical advantage" (pp. 74-75). A wealth of historical data is provided regarding the invention of these basic machines. Chapter 5 deals with structures that span voids, such as suspension bridges, column and lintel construction, trusses, and arches and domes. The authors describe the architects of antiquity as empiricists who under- stood little of the mechanical theory behind their work. An analysis of construction techniques shows the Greeks and Romans to have been quite conservative, with little idea of how much load a lintel could take or how strong an arch actually was. Prehistoric archaeologists will be interested in Chap- ters 6 and 7. Chapter 6 focuses on the fracture mechan- ics of flaking stone tools, the grinding of ground-stone tools, and stone-tool use wear. While not comprehen- sive in its treatment, it presents a well-written and well- illustrated summary of many of the basic concepts. One troubling omission is the failure to reference John Speth's (1972) work on Hertzian conchoidal fracture (American Antiquity 37:34-60). Chapter 7 on projec- tiles is a fascinating treatise on the operational me- chanics and mechanical efficiency of the spear, the spearthrower, the boomerang, the bow and arrow, and torsion catapults. Of particular interest is the authors' discussion of the myth of the supremacy of the long- bow. Chapter 8 focuses on land transport with sections on the mechanics of walking, pack transport, wheeled ve- hicles, animal harnesses, and the wheelbarrow. The development of wheeled vehicles is linked to the de- velopment of good roads, which are in turn linked to the communication needs of empires. The chapter con- cludes with a fascinating mechanical analysis of how the Egyptians might have moved the Colossi of Mem- non and how the Easter Islanders could have erected their immense statues. Chapter 9 deals with the mechanics of water trans- port, focusing on buoyancy, lateral stability, propulsion (oars, sails), water resistance, and steering and direc- tional stability, with an interesting section that analyzes the mechanical operation and efficiency of the trireme. Chapter 10 deals with the mechanics of sound and musical instruments placed within an historical con- text. Sections dealing with the pitch and quality of musical notes, harmony and musical scales, and the zhong bell of China are of special interest. In general, this book has many strengths and is a welcome addition to the literature of both prehistoric and historical archaeology. The authors hope that their efforts will lead to additional mechanical studies of irrigation systems, ship construction, snow skis, and hunting traps; one could add potting wheels, mining operations, and wagon construction to the list. The book does have some weaknesses, however. While it succeeds in its attempt to avoid focusing only on European examples, the authors' relative lack of familiarity with the archaeology of the New World is often apparent, e.g., the relative lack of technological examples from the New World, the misspelling of the word atlatl on page 168, the failure to cite Speth's work, and the failure to adequately discuss basalt, rhyolite, and andesite as important sources of flaked-stone tools. There is also a tendency to use value-laden terms when referring to the absence of a particular technology in a given historical context, e.g., the absence of the wheel- barrow in the Roman world is described as "an absence we find inexplicable" (pp. 214-215), and the pulley is described as "strangely" unknown in Egypt (p. 89). Finally, despite the authors' claims that the text uses high-school mathematics, readers will sometimes be tempted to skip one or more pages when the equations become excessive (pp. 95, 191, 198-204).
