<plain_text><page sequence="1">PIUS ADESANMI Of Postcolonial Entanglement and Durde: Reflections on the Francophone African Novel Introduction: Afropessimism and temporality One fundamental consequence of the tragic failure of the postcolonial nation- state in Africa has been the elaboration of discursive positions underpinned by sentiments of despair and hopelessness. With one developmentalist thesis after another crumbling under the weight of civil wars, famine, poverty, social inertia, and political stasis, it has become the norm in various Africanist disciplines to homogenize the continent's postcolonial space as one uniform site of dysfunc- tionality.' Underpinning the reasons often proffered for this pervasive Afropes- simism is the belief that "the African condition"2 can only be understood from the perspective of what Simon Gikandi calls "the schemata of difference" (455), difference, that is, from the teleological ethos of the Occident. Thus, an entire discursive symbology has evolved to place the temporal frame of the African postcolony within a largely unproblematized sign of negativity. This is the diffi- culty of speaking "rationally" about Africa that Achille Mbembe evokes in the introduction to On the Postcolony. In an effort to transcend both Afropessimist representations of the African condition and the Eurocentric paradigms that underlie some of them, Patrick Chabal andJean-Pascal Daloz propose in Africa Works an analytical grid designed to reveal the "continuities in their historicity." Although their study focuses on articulations of agency in the informal infra-State contexts of African postcolonies, Chabal and Daloz are able to show that Afropessimism devolves from scholarly practices and discursive formations that are too often fixated on the tragedy of Africa's colonial past and the imperfect modernity of the nation-state it engen- dered. The trouble with such positions is that they often underestimate the dyna- mism of the present, subsuming its independent vitality within the causal 1 For a summary of various attempts to grapple with the postcolonial condition of Africa and the Third World in the last four decades, see Tejumola Olaniyan's introduction to the special issue of Callaloo on postcolonial theory. 2 The phrase is commonplace in African Studies as a catch-all for whatever is believed to have happened to Africans as a result of colonialism.</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /228 instrumentality of a colonial past that is made to function as an exegetical grid for every aspect of the postcolonial condition. Chabal and Daloz, on the other hand, while acknowledging the significance of the past, do not downplay the vitality of a present marked by the interweaving of Africa's colonial and post- colonial realities. If the need to overcome the passe inclinations of Afropessimism also bespeaks a certain anxiety regarding temporality, as one clearly sees in Africa Works, it is because every attempt to privilege what Fredric Jameson calls "the ontology of the present" (215) carries the risk of unsettling altogether the authority of the African past. That is, if, asJameson suggests, "ontologies of the present demand archeologies of the future, not forecasts of the past"-the reference to Edouard Glissant's well-known notion of vision prophitique du passe ("the prophetic vision of the past") (227) is obvious-what then happens to the past of subject peoples, a past that requires precisely the sort of creative engagement that Jameson dis- misses? How does one proceed to valorize this past without making the present its prisoner? This dilemma was largely responsible for the initially lukewarm attitude of African (ist) scholarship to postcolonial theory, a body of knowledge that has never quite been able to overcome the semantic import of its problematic prefix.3 Achille Mbembe, postcolonial temporality, and durie Achille Mbembe is one African scholar who has engaged the anxieties of post- colonial temporality in a manner that accounts for the overlapping of past and present while maintaining their distinct functionality. His seminal book On the Postcolony engages the modalities of self-fashioning in the African present, modal- ities determined at once by local issues and, more generally, by the status of Africa as a subaltern Other of the West. By theorizing the political structure of the African present as a postcolony, Mbembe inevitably affirms the politics of tem- porality, since a postcolony is, of necessity, related temporally to what had been a colony: The notion "postcolony" identifies specifically a given historical trajectory-that of societies recently emerging from the experience of colonization and the violence which the colonial relationship involves. To be sure, the postcolony is chaotically pluralistic; it has nonetheless an internal coherence ... the postcolony is characterized by a distinctive style of political improvisation, by a tendency to excess and lack of proportion, as well as by distinctive ways identities are multiplied, transformed and put into circulation. But the postcolony is also made up of a series of corporate institutions and a political machinery that, once in place, constitute a distinctive regime of violence. (102, emphasis added) Although scholars as diverse asJudith Butler, Tejumola Olaniyan, and Fernando Coronil have disagreed with many of Mbembe's formulations regarding the nature of power and the articulations of resistance in the African postcolony,4 he has 3 Critical engagements with the temporal implications of the postcolonial have yielded a litera- ture too vast to be cited exhaustively here. The most commonly cited essays include Arif Dirlik's "The Postcolonial Aura," Ella Shohat's "Notes on the Postcolonial," Anne McClintock's "The Angel of Progress," and Aijaz Ahmad's "The Politics of Literary Postcoloniality."

As an age, the postcolony encloses multiple durfes made up of discontinuities, reversals, inertias, and swings that overlay one another, interpenetrate one another, and envelope one another: an entanglement. (14) Of the three key terms-age, duree, entanglement-Mbembe proposes for semi- otizing the postcolonial, duree constitutes a unit that allows continuously unfold- ing fragments of experience to crystallize into normative phenomena, even within the overall context of temporal progression. Consequently, duree becomes the site in which the constitutive experiences of a given present can be grasped in a synchronic fashion. The entanglement of multiple duries over a period of time in turn offers the possibility of a diachronic apprehension of phenomena. The Duree and Francophone African Fiction Building on Mbembe's formulations, I want to suggest in what follows that it is possible to theorize the thematic evolution of the Francophone African novel as an entanglement of three distinctive duries: the power duroe, the large corpus of novels that focus on what Mbembe calls "postcolonial relations of power" (103); the feminist duroe, the explosion of women's writing in the late 1980s; and the di- asporic durie, the new generation of diasporic African novelists that emerged in France in the early 1990s.' I will argue further that while each durie is governed by a discursive ideological coherence that makes it possible to place a vast number of novels in the same current, the three durees nevertheless manifest considerable overlaps and interpenetrations that would render rigid divisions unworkable. Reading three decades of Francophone African textual production within such a thematic grid allows us to examine how issues such as generational affinity and gender have impacted collectively or differentially on a broad range of works. Francophone Africa is of course far from a homogeneous literary, cultural, or political space. Indeed, the multiplicity and diversity of experiences that colonial political structures such as the Afrique Occidentale Frangaise (AOF) homog- enized for administrative and political purposes have re-emerged with a consid- erable resonance within the postcolonial dispensation. Furthermore, because these new realities have been largely subsumed within the strictures of nation and nationalism, there has been an increasing tendency in Francophone African texts to articulate identities as national literatures. While I remain sensitive to the pertinence of locale and the dangers of unqual- ified generalization, I will nevertheless employ the trans-local, trans-national para- digm of Francophone Africa to underscore the possibilities that the approach I 5 The regularity with which these writers stage Paris as a site of migrancy, exile, and alienation has earned their novels the critical designation "mouvance de la migritude"; see Jacques Chevrier's review of Jean-Roger Essomba's Une Blanche dans le noir (Notre Librairie 147 [2002]: 66).</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /230 outline here offers for assessing the ways in which texts belonging to various national literatures have transformed spatial strictures and boundaries in their responses to the failed postcolonial African state, the question of patriarchy, and the deracination, displacement, and disarticulated identities imposed on writers from different Francophone African countries by virtue of their common inser- tion into a homogenizing, metropolitan site.6 The entanglement of the three durees-and the consequent need to avoid reifying them as separate entities-is demonstrated by a novel like Calixthe Beyala's Le petit prince de Belleville, which straddles the feminist and the migritude durees. Similarly, Aminata Sow Fall's L'ex-pere de la nation would dissolve any rigidly con- structed boundaries between the power and feminist durees. I will therefore deploy the continuities inherent in Mbembe's theory of entanglement in such a way as to signal a radical departure from the approach to Francophone African literary evolution we encounter in Georges Ngal's Cr&amp;tion et rupture en litterature africaine: La notion de rupture ainsi entendue sera etendue, dans nos analyses, a la th6matique, a la structure de l'intrigue, au sujet du roman, au ton, au regard, a l'esth6tique romanesque. C'est ainsi que l'on parlera de "rupture thematique," de "rupture de sujet de roman," de "rupture de ton," de "rupture de structure romanesque," d'une "esthe'tique de la rupture"... Ces ruptures sont 6troitement liees A la conjonction historique dont elles sont une sorte de miroir. Les discontinuites ou ruptures historiques, en effet, &amp;clairent les ruptures constat6es au plan de la creation. (8-9) Conceived thus, the notion of rupture will be extended, in our analyses, to themes, plot, novelistic subject, tone, point of view, and novelistic aesthetics. We shall consequently be speaking of "the- matic rupture," "rupture of novelistc subject," "rupture in tone," "rupture in plot," "aesthetics of rupture". .. These ruptures are intricately linked to the historical conjuncture of which they consti- tute a sort of mirror. In essence, historical discontinuities or ruptures reflect the ruptures that are observable at the level of literary creation. (my translation)7 Indeed, Ngal's emphasis on "discontinuities" seems conspicuously out of place in a postcolonial theoretical environment in which, as Ngugi wa Thiong'o puts it, "seeking connections between things" (119) is the primary goal. I have chosen to locate my analysis within the time span between Alioum Fantoure's Le cercle des tropiques (1972) and Sami Tchak's Place des FHtes (2001), because the three de- cades represent a watershed in the remarkable evolution of the novel in Francophone Africa, a watershed characterized by the production of works whose thematic and textual iconoclasm underscores a drive on the part of Francophone African novelists to reinvigorate African textual practice. The Power Duree The foundational moment of what I will call a postcolonial power durie in Francophone African fiction is located in Fantoure's Le cercle des tropiques, a novel that signals a renewed engagement with power in the annals of Francophone 6 For instance, while novels like Evelyne Mpoudi Ngolle's Sous la cendre lefeu and Regina Yaou's Le prix de la revolte belong to the national literatures of Cameroon and C6te d'Ivoire, respectively, both novels articulate an anti-patriarchal resistance that cuts across national boundaries to expose the predicament of African womanhood. 7 I have done my own translations from the French only in cases where there are no published English translations.</page><page sequence="5">OF POSTCOLONIAL ENTANGLEMENT &amp; DUREE/231 African fiction. In its early phase, Francophone African fiction was mainly con- cerned with the revaluation or deconstruction of African history.8 Closely linked to the texts of historical remapping are those that invest in what Abdul JanMohammed calls a "manichean allegory" (59) spelled out in terms of key binarisms: tradition/modernity, black/white, center/margin, Africa/Occident, village/city.9 And while one can certainly find in the novels of Ferdinand Oyono, Sembene Ousmane, and Mongo Beti a sustained confrontation with power,10 Le cercle des tropiques constitutes a major shift in the way that power is represented. In this novel, as in many that come after it, colonial power and its brutalities either become peripheral issues or are totally discarded. In their place we en- counter the much more deadly political realities of the Francophone African postcolony: monopartyism and presidents-for-life, coupled with the progressive disempowerment of a disillusioned civil society. Indeed, in Le cercle des tropiques we actually witness the moment that announces the birth of the postcolonial power duree. Appalled by the already prevalent manifestations of political de- bauchery and violent intra-African squabbles in the nascent "democracy" of Les Marigots du Sud, the fictional setting of the novel, Sept-Saint Siss, a French po- lice officer, offers a somber diagnosis of the African condition on the eve of the country's political independence: Docteur, il y a une chose que j'aurai apprise pendant mon sejour d'une trentaine d'annbes sous les tropiques. C'est que vous etes plus cruels entre vous, que ne le serajamais un toubab h votre bgard. Croyez-moi, le venin ne vient pas de l'exterieur. Vous sbcrbtez vous-memes votre propre poison. (116) Doctor, there is one thing I've learnt during the thirty years I've spent in the tropics. And that's that you are more cruel to each other than any white man ever can be to you. Believe me, the poison doesn't come from the outside. You are secreting it yourselves. (115) What in the wake of colonialism the white French officer identifies as the poi- son within is the personalization of power and its concentration in the hands of a single individual, the consequent ascription of anthropomorphic qualities to this individual through a systematic fabrication of official narratives to which all sub- jects must subscribe, and a homogenization of identity that results from the elit- ist praxis of constructing the illusion of a common national destiny for disparate ethnic nationalities that have been forcibly welded together by the colonial ma- chine. This is the totalitarian incubus that characterizes the postcolonial land- scape of much of Francophone Africa in the two decades following political independence in the early 1960s. Its transformation into the dominant idiom of fictional production, beginning with Le cercle des tropiques, constitutes a postcolonial power durie that will span more than two decades in Francophone African fiction."1 8 Paul Hazoumb's Doguicimi (1938) and Nazi Boni's Cripuscule des temps anciens (1962) are texts that attempt such a historical revaluation, while the practice of romanticizing Africa's precolonial history is unsettled by Yambo Ouologuem's Le devoir de violence (1968). 9 Seydou Badian's Sous l'orage (1963), Cheikh Hamidou Kane's L'aventure ambigu;! (1961), and Abdoulaye Sadji's Maimouna (1958) exemplify this theme. 0 Here, we are concerned with the exactions and naked brutalities of colonial power as seen in Oyono's Une vie de boy (1956), Ousmane's Les bouts de bois de dieu (1960), and most of the novels that constitute what is now regarded as the first phase of Beti's expansive novelistic career. " The list of novels that fall into this category is so expansive that one cannot possibly itemize them exhaustively. Of interest, however, are Sony Labou Tansi's La vie et demie, William Sassine's Le</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /232 One of the main characteristics of the African postcolony is that in the contest for meaning between subjects and power the boundaries between what Althusser calls "ideological state apparatuses" and the body of the Maximum Ruler are pro- gressively blurred. This is the moment when, according to Mbembe, the postcolony creates, through administrative and bureaucratic practices, its own world of meanings-a master code that, while becoming the society's central code, ends by governing, perhaps paradoxically, the logics that underlie all other meanings within that society; attempts to institutionalize this world of meanings as a socio-historical world and to make that world real, turning it into part of people's "common sense" not only by instilling it in the minds of the cibles, or target population, but also by integrating it into the period's consciousness. (103) Le cercle des tropiques offers a powerful representation of this process. Bohi Di, first person narrator and protagonist of the novel, provides a heuristic analysis of the process through which the body of Bare Koule, the Maximum Ruler, is trans- formed into a "master code" that is consequently institutionalized and foisted on the consciousness of a "target population": Bar6 Koule ftait salue comme un nouveau dieu par ses compatriotes ... C'etait un sauveur, disait- on, son mythe avait pris forme. Deja depuis quelques jours, les habitants ne parlaient que de sa sagesse, de son eloquence, de son intelligence, de sa lutte contre les toubabs pour l'independance des Marigots du Sud. Tout lui 6tait impute, tout lui etait donne, tout lui 6tait dfi. Il etait le maitre. (126) Bari Kouli's compatriots were hailing him as a new divinity... He was hailed as a saviour; he was already creating his own legend. For days now the people had talked of nothing but his wisdom, his eloquence, his intelligence, his struggle against the White Man to obtain the independence of South Majiland. He was credited with everything, given everything, everything was due to him. He was the Master. (127) It is significant that the birth of Bare Koule's mythology coincides with the event marking the birth of the nation: political independence from a European colonial power. This scenario is reproduced in various shades and according to different authorial temperaments in virtually all the power duree novels published after Le cercle des tropiques. It is in this sense that Fantoure's novel foregrounds the ontological doubleness that constitutes the foundation of the African postcolony: the institutionalized myth-narrative of the Maximum Ruler and the narrative of nationalism were the two yarns that were woven together as the unifying identity of the totalitarian African state, especially in Francophone Africa. The novels of the postcolonial power duree are political novels whose discur- sive universe is governed by the systematic negation of the subaltern subject's will/right to an egalitarian and participatory political agency. As evidenced by the enforced subscription of the citizens of Les Marigots du Sud to "messie-koism," the quasi-religious state ideology of Bare Koulk, the political novel is also one in which a "felonious state" (Bayart, Ellis, Hibou 1) turns its Weberian monopoly of all instruments of legitimate violence into the production of subservient subjects.12 jeune homme de sable, Tierno Monenembo's Les crapauds-brousse, Boris Bobacar Diop's Le temps de Tamango, Henri Lopes's Le pleurer-rire, Patrick Ilboudo's Les vertiges du trnne, Aminata Sow Fall's L'ex- pere de la nation, Sembene Ousmane's Le dernier de l'empire, Rachid Mimouni's Une peine d vivre, Pius Ngandu Nkashama's Le doyen marri, Ahmadou Kourouma's En attendant le vote des bites sauvages, and Emmanuel Dongala's Les petits garcons naissent aussi des itoiles. 12 It should equally be noted that Francophone Africa's power durne novels assemble all the em- blematic typologies of the African nation-state as identified in African (ist) social science discourse:</page><page sequence="7">OF POSTCOLONIAL ENTANGLEMENT &amp; DUREE/233 The entanglement of colonial and postcolonial temporalities is maintained in the power duree novel by the shadowy presence of France, whose representatives function as "advisors." However, the main impact of the postcolonial power durde on Francophone African fiction lies in a radical re-invention of textual idiom. Because the socio-political realities feeding the imagination of the Francophone African writer became so grotesque that textual and narrative strategies inherited from Flaubert, Zola, and Stendhal quickly became inadequate, the power durde novels typically employ the so-called postcolonial delinearization of narrative temporality, a combination of strategies that includes the defamiliarization of reality, the expansion of narrative space, the multiplication of voices to achieve polyphony, the use of neologisms, other syntactic transgressions aimed at domes- ticating the French language, and, most important, a recourse to African oral discursive strategies, which have transformed the novels of the power duree into avenues for apprehending the postcolony as a site of "excess" and "promiscuity," to borrow Mbembe's notions. The Feminist Durne The emergence of the authoritarian postcolonial African nation-state as a the- matic durde in Francophone African fiction coexists uneasily with the growth of an oppositional feminist duree in that literary firmament. It is now generally agreed in African studies that colonialism combined with Africa's traditional patriarchal ethos to effect a systematic subalternization of African women.'" Consequently, the African state that emerged from this historical crisis was sexist and patriar- chal. The entirely masculinist aura of the nationalist movements that gave birth to the African state, coupled with the sexist dictatorships that followed it, en- sured a phallogocentric continuum from which the question of women's voice and agency were occluded (see Oyeronke). Because of the imbrication of early modern African literature with the anti- colonial and cultural nationalisms of the 1950s and the 1960s, African literature came to mirror the patriarchal nature of African politics. Consequently, modern African literature and its criticism were, in the early phase, an entirely male af- fair. Women served merely as a textual foil for the romanticist exuberance of writers yearning for a symbolic maternal succour.14 By the mid-1970s, the exclu- sion of women from literary and political arenas had become worrisome enough to occasion a feminist response from increasingly visible female intellectuals. The manner in which they voiced their opposition to the malecentric African literary process has been described appropriately by Irene Assiba D'Almeida as a "prise d'ecriture" ("seizure of writing") in her book Francophone African Women: the one-party state in Lepleurer-rire and Unepeine a vivre; the patrimonial state in L'ex-pere de la nation and Les petits garcons naissent aussi des etoiles; and the warlord state in Allah n'est pas obligei. The failed, collapsed, or crisis state is, of course, present in all the examples we have cited. 13 For an illustration of this view by African feminist scholars, see Oyeronke's The Invention of Women and Ogundipe-Leslie. 14 This explains the idyllic "African Mother" and "Mother Africa" tropes we come across in novels like Camara Laye's L'enfant noir and Abdoulaye Sadji's Maimouna.</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /234 Destroying the Emptiness of Silence. For Mary Modupe Kolawole (in Womanism and African Consciousness), the advent of women's writing is a form of "voice throw- ing," a literal translation of sani-baat, the traditional Senegalese feminist concept in which women literally "throw in" their voices to counter, disrupt, or rupture a patriarchal flow of discourse. However, crucial as the initial women's texts were to the overall development of African literatures in the 1970s, they did not collectively affect Francophone Africa's postcolonial literary temporality on such a scale as to constitute a duree in the sense in which I have used the term thus far. Rather, within the dominant phallocentric flow of literary discourse, novels by writers such as Mariama Ba and Aminata Sow Fall simply carved a space for the emergence of what would later constitute an effective feminist durie in Francophone African fiction beginning in the mid-1980s. By the mid-1990s insurgent textualities and radical remappings of the modalities of self-fashioning in African fiction by a new generation of women writers formed the basis for what Odile Cazenave has appropriately described as an African "nouveau roman." 15 Cameroon novelist Calixthe Beyala has distinguished herself as the chef defile of the feminist durie writers. She is the first Black writer ever to win, albeit in contentious circumstances, the prestigious Grand Prix du roman de l'Acadimie francaise, and she has constructed an expansive oeuvre-completing (on average) one well-received novel per year since 1987, as well as several important essays. Her works have even joined those of Mariama Bfa in the highly insular canonical sanctuary of the North American academy. Beyala is also the only feminist durie writer to have attracted a book-length critical study (see Gallimore). In Beyala's novels-especially those set in Africa and now increasingly considered as the first phase of her careerl6-are assembled all the indices of the textual iconoclasm 15 See Cazenave's Femmes rebelles: naissance d'un nouveau roman africain aufiminin. The Francophone African critical landscape also changed considerably to cope with the hermeneutic exigencies of the new feminist durie. For instance, Arlette Chemain-Degrange's 1980 study of the textual repre- sentation of African women in her magisterial Emancipation fiminine et roman africain was necessar- ily a study of the representation of women in male-authored texts, given the paucity of texts written by Francophone African women at the time of its publication. Six years later, Ngambika, another critical milestone in the study of African women edited by Carole Boyce Davies and Anne Adams Graves, also offered, essentially, image studies of African women in male-authored texts. By the 1990s, however, studies able to focus entirely on female-authored texts began to appear. The jour- nal Notre Librairie devoted two entire issues to Francophone African women's writing in 1994, thus canonizing a feminist durie that includes such prominent writers as Regina Yaou, Angile Rawiri, Philomene Bassek, Evelyne Mpoudi Ngolle, Tanella Boni, Vbronique Tadjo, Aminata Maiga Ka, Myriam Warner-Vieyra, Fatou K6ita, Abibatou Traor6, Marie Ndiaye, and Catherine Ndiaye. 16 See Coly's essay "Neither Here nor There: Calixthe Beyala's Collapsing Homes." During the first phase of her career, in which Beyala published novels like Tu t'appelleras Tanga, C'est le soleil qui m'a br-ile, and Asseze l'Africaine, and the epistolary essay Lettre d'uneAfricaine d ses soeurs occidentales (1995), she articulated a politics of identity that clearly identified her as an "African" writer. Then she gradu- ally shifted to a hyphenated position, and by the year 2000 she was identifying herself as an "Afro- FranCaise," as evidenced in the title of her second epistolary essay Lettre d'une Afro-Francaise d ses compatriotes. Only five years separate the two epistolary essays, yet the shift in identity politics in- scribed in the titles is significant. In the first letter the subject identifies herself as "an African woman" writing to "her Western sisters." In the second letter she identifies herself as "an Afro-French woman" writing to "her compatriots," that is, French and not Cameroon nationals. At present, Beyala ap- pears to be shifting gradually toward a wholly French identity. My discussion of Beyala is therefore concerned only with the African phase of her curious, unfolding identitarian odyssey.</page><page sequence="9">OF POSTCOLONIAL ENTANGLEMENT &amp; DUREE/235 and thematic transgressions that distinguish the works of the new novelists from those of their predecessors such as Bta and Sow Fall. A major difference between the texts of these two older writers and those of Beyala's generation lies in their approach to the female and male bodies. The pioneering female writers primarily focused on the debilitating social conditions of African women in largely "autobiographical voices," to use Francoise Lionnet's phrase. The cultural strictures surrounding the female body in much of tradi- tional Africa make the female-and the male-anatomy a terra incognita, closed to textual representation. The feminist duree writers opened up this closed zone and transformed it into a viable site of textual inscription. So gripping is the textual engagement of the new feminist writers with the female body that Gallimore has delineated what she calls a "discours du corps" (discourse of the body) with specific reference to Beyala's novels ("Ecriture f6minine" 64). For example, Tu t'appelleras Tanga, one of Beyala's most widely critiqued novels, con- tains riveting references to the genitals of teenage prostitutes as nauseating pub- lic places where indolent men unload their burdens. However, it is in Beyala's treatment of the male anatomy that the novel's feminism is most transgressive. Beyala's strategy for deconstructing the dominant male body is to render it "invisible" and leave the phallus exposed. The average male in Tu t'appelleras Tanga is indolent and hardly thinks; likewise, his phallus, the symbol of his so-called superiority and pride, becomes the greatest impediment to his agency. The first indication of this strategy is the information that Tanga, the novel's heroine, was raped at the age of twelve by her incestuous father. Then follows a quick succes- sion of male characters whose subjectivity is determined entirely by the dictates of their sexual desires. Hassan, Tanga's boyfriend, is one such man, and Beyala emphasizes his enslavement by denying him any tangible anchorage in the socio- political fabric of Iningue, the novel's fictional setting. Even his initial meeting with Tanga is structured in a manner that draws attention to his genitals: J'ai fait la connaissance de Hassan par sesjambes. Je les vois encore gant~es dans un pantalon gris frip6 a l'endroit du sexe et du ventre. (19) I met Hassan through his legs. I can see them still, grey trousers fitting them like a glove, crumpled around his penis and his belly. (10) Once Hassan's penis has fallen within the spectrum of this narrative gaze, it re- mains there and determines all his actions and utterances in the novel. Tanga, as first-person narrator, serves as the authorial tool for maintaining Hassan in this phallic prison through her perception and description of his every gesture: II danse de la tite, allume un cigare, fume, toussote avant de monopoliser les mots, il ne parle pas d'amour, il plaide le plaisir distill6 par son sexe. Il dit: "Je te ferai renaitre sous mes muscles." (27) His head bobs around, he lights a cigarette, smokes, coughs before taking control of his words. He doesn't speak of love but makes a plea for the pleasure his penis has exuded. He says: "You'll be reborn underneath my muscles." (15) Hassan is, however, not alone in inhabiting this phallic prison. Here, for exam- ple, is the narrator's description of "the man with the wound,' one of Tanga's mother's numerous lovers: Et ce soir, la vieille la mere retrouve l'homme i la plaie dans la cabane que lui reserve Mama Terecita. Et comme d'habitude, l'homme a la plaie l'attendra, allong&amp;, le sexe A l'air, sa cheville pourrie pendant hors du lit, dans la ruelle. (82)</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /236 And tonight, mother old one will meet the man with the wound in the hut reserved for him by Mama Terecita. And as usual, the man with the wound will be awaiting her, lying down, his penis in the air, his decayed ankle hanging down in the space between the bed and the wall. (49) It is significant that in the general aura of putrefaction woven around this char- acter only his penis stands out as an unblemished evidence of his carceral exist- ence, an existence which makes him privilege the indulgence of his sexual desires over his body's nutritional needs: La vielle la mere lui tend la viande et dit: "Tiens." "Apras," repond-il. "D'abord la femme." La vieille la mere s'allonge ... I Ila possade tres vite, tel un insecte, il la libere, il gratte son ventre qu'il ajusqu'aux cuisses, il dit: '3'ai faim, tu m'as vid6." (82) Mother old one is still holding out the meat to him and says: "Here." "Later," he answers. "The woman first." Mother old one lies down ... He takes her very quickly, like an insect. He frees her, scratches his belly which hangs down to his thighs and says: "I'm hungry, you've emptied me out." (49-50) Food comes after phallus in this man's world, and the physical disability of this character provides further proof of Beyala's reluctance to accord her male char- acters a subjectivity beyond the base instincts of their phalluses. Thus, when her men are not physically challenged, they are socially and psychologically han- dicapped (for example, Awono in Assize l'Africaine and M. Tichit in Maman a un amant). Beyala's transgressive use of the body to unsettle the patriarchy is complemented by other strategies that abound in the texts of her feminist durie contemporaries. For example, in Angdle Rawiri's Cris etfureurs defemmes, lesbian sexual coupling functions as a means of female assertion in a highly intolerant African context that either silences any deviation from heterosexuality or considers it an un- African, Western malady; similarly, in Abibatou Traore's Sidagamie polygamy is envisioned as a possible site of female bonding that could lead to the marginali- zation of the dominant male. The Diasporic Durde Beyala and a good number of other Francophone African writers are currently based in France. These writers, increasingly referred to as the third generation of Francophone writers, have thematized identity and otherness as conditioned by their location in the diasporic and/or exilic space. Because most of them were born after 1960, the emblematic year of Africa's now truncated political inde- pendence from Western European powers, they are, in the words ofAbdourahman Ali Waberi, "les enfants de la postcolonie" (the children of the postcolony), and they have produced a novelistic corpus that is expansive enough to be treated as a durne on its own merit. The treatment of the migrancy motif is, admittedly, not new in Francophone African fiction." What has changed is the interactive scale of the global political 17 Sembene Ousmane's Le docker noir, Bernard Dadie's Un negre a Paris, Ferdinand Oyono's Chemin d'Europe, Hamidou Kane's L'aventure ambigu, and Ake Loba's Kocoumbo, I'tudiant noir have all en- gaged this motif.</page><page sequence="11">OF POSTCOLONIAL ENTANGLEMENT &amp; DUREE/237 economy in which the new writers from Francophone Africa function. Arjun Appadurai's description of the new global configuration as involving "interac- tions of a new order and intensity" (1) becomes pertinent for literature to the extent that it crystallizes the emergence of what Liselotte Glage and Rfidiger Kunow call "a new inter-national and inter-cultural space of representation" gov- erned by the thematics of home and exile, of deterritorialization and deracination, of diasporic subjecthood and identity (7).'" Sami Tchak's Place des fites is one of the most representative novels in the diasporic durde.19 Unlike first wave Francophone texts by writers like Sembene Ousmane and Ferdinand Oyono, which explored immigrant motifs by deploy- ing the classic plot of a centripetal flight from Africa (site of diminished oppor- tunities/failure) to the Occidental Eldorado, the diasporic durie text is not ensconced within the politics of flight. France, here, is not a site of arrival. It is an already consolidated site of "being in the Diaspora," as Dionne Brand puts it in her fine memoir A Map to the Door of no Return (26). In the same vein, for the hero/ine of the diasporic duree text, as we see in Place desfites, Africa is also not a physical site of departure. It is an imaginary space whose contours can only be glimpsed from the daily nostalgic gestures of parents who originally departed. The dilemma of the narrator-hero in Place des fites is occasioned by the onto- logical split between the migrant and the diasporic conditions: the migrant is still able to conceive of a past anchored in a physical space of origin while the diasporic subject lacks such vital latitudes. According to Brand, There is a sense of return in migrations-a sense of continuities, remembered homes-as with birds or butterflies or deer or fish. Those returns which are lodged indelibly, unconsciously, instinctively in the mind. But migrations suggests intentions or purposes. Some choice and, if not choice, deci- sions. And if not decisions, options, all be they difficult. But the sense of return in the Door of No Return is one of irrecoverable losses of those very things which make returning possible. A place to return to, a way of being, familiar sights or sounds, familiar smells, a welcome perhaps, but a place, welcome or not. (24) Choice, decisions, options: all are possibilities denied the narrator-hero of Place des fites by virtue of his situation as a diasporic progenitor of immigrant African parents. Unlike his parents, he lacks a place to return to, an African way of being, yet the familiar sights, smells, and sounds of Paris, the city of his birth, inscribe him as an outsider, an Other, a problem. This psychic/identitarian impasse accounts for the hero's temperament and impacts on the plot and narrative structures of the text. The chapters are sequenced 18 This new order, now loosely referred to as globalization, has not only facilitated an unprec- edented movement of people from the Global South to the metropolitan sites of the West, but has also generated an increased awareness of the presence of the Other and the politics of Otherness. As traditional boundaries crumble under the dual advance of migrancy and the immediacy of the information age, theory is forced to undertake a radical re-examination of its categories. The bor- der as a physical locus of division is refigured as a site of contact and continuity capable of gener- ating novel forms of identity. It becomes an independent territory, a "borderland," as Gloria Anzaldua puts it. Mary Louise Pratt encourages us to reflect on the possibilities of "contact zones," while Arjun Appadurai suggests five "scapes" that regulate flows in an essentially borderless, transnational space. 9 A list of other notable examples might include Leandre-Alain Baker's Ici s'acheve le voyage, Calixthe Beyala's Le petit prince de Belleville, Jean-Roger Essomba's Le paradis du nord, Aboubacar Diop's Dans la peau d'un sans-papiers, Daniel Biyaoula's L'impasse, Alain Mabanckou's Bleu-Blanc-Rouge, and Fatou Diome's La Priference nationale.</page><page sequence="12">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 238 like cinema clips, and every chapter bears the title, "putain de .. ." (fucking ...). Every character he describes-including his parents, sisters, and all African im- migrants-every situation he evinces, is introduced using this vulgar interjec- tion. The cinematic mode throws us into his life in the streets of Paris where we witness the familiar life situations of immigrant and diasporic populations in a Western city. The hero's language never departs from the curse-laden, vulgar street slang of Paris. He has no compunction about furnishing lurid details con- cerning his two sisters who are now prostitutes in Holland, his sexual romps with his voluptuous cousin, his gang raping of the cousin of his Malian friend, his incestuous relationship with one of his own sisters, and, finally, his latent desire to sleep with his own mother, whom he calls a "whore." One way in which Place des fites departs significantly from other texts of the diasporic duree is the hero's unsympathetic, even hostile, handling of the roots motif. He has no patience with his father's obsession to return to die in Africa. He condemns the hypocrisy of African immigrants who cling to romanticized reminiscences of home while downplaying the conditions that occasioned their flight in the first place. He has no sympathy for their ritualistic recourse to the race card whenever they confront official French policies deemed hostile to im- migrants, and he defends the right of France to adopt measures against invasion by immigrants. Yet on other occasions France becomes the target of his acerbic, vulgar recriminations. In the end, no one escapes the hero's verbal darts, not even himself. He thus succeeds in sustaining an aura of physical and psychological discomfort throughout the text, a condition which Place desiftes, like all diasporic duree texts, metaphorizes as the inescapable foundation of diasporic subjecthood. Conclusion What the diasporic duree texts underscore in their ideological linkages with the novels of the power and feminist durees is the continued presence of the script of colonialism as the backdrop of African textual production years after the official demise of that historical event. Colonialism and its heir in the present, neocolonialism, authored the conditions from which the despotic political cli- mate depicted in the power duree novels emerged. The combined effects of sub- sisting modalities of colonialist oppression and the postcolonial vitiation of the African present-which we encounter in testimonial narratives like Pius Ngandu Nkashama's Citadelle d'espoir, Wole Soyinka's The Open Sore ofa Continent, and Ngugi wa Thiong'o's Writers in Politics-are responsible for the construction of the Occi- dent as the only solution to a hostile African present. Hence the mass migrations from which the diasporic durie has emerged. These diasporic texts consistently hark back to colonialism and neocolonialism. Thus, for example, in Place desJites the hero's father's services to France during the colonial period are consistently referenced to underscore that European country's ingratitude in its present-day dealings with the loyal ex-colonial subject. The feminist durie novels, while ostensibly challenging African men and patri- archy, are also heavily invested in the subtext of colonialism. While not denying the existence of forms of sexist oppression in pre-European Africa, much recent</page><page sequence="13">OF POSTCOLONIAL ENTANGLEMENT &amp; DUREE/239 African feminist scholarship examines how the colonial machine worsened the condition of African women by eroding traditional mechanisms of female agency and imposing Western sexist models. The work of Oyeronke Oyewumi and Obioma Nnaemeka are crucial in this regard. Such analyses ultimately establish linkages between the phallocentric and sexist nature of the "modernist" institutions of the contemporary African nation-state and the sexist colonial structures that pro- duced them. Consequently, the critique of the sexist and dysfunctional struc- tures of the state is pervasive in the feminist durie novels. That the three duries have governed Francophone African literary production equally in the last three decades underscores the importance of the connections between African history and literature. Studying them as three distinctive but interconnected particularities within a broad historical continuum allows for an engagement with Africa's postcolonial phase in terms of its linkages to the forces that continue to shape the African present. And within these intertwined tempo- ral conjunctures is the subaltern African subject who must not only negotiate the normative authority of a problematic past without becoming its prisoner, but also seek to overcome the daunting conditions of a present in which the global- ized dynamics of the market combine with local conditions of power and trun- cated democracies to vitiate agency.20 The Pennsylvania State University Works Cited Ahmad, Aijaz.
