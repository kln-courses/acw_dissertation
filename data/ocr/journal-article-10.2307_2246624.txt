The GOenesis of Primitive Thought.-It is somewhat to be regretted that Mr. Tylor, in his interesting notice of Mr. Spencer's Principles of Sociology (MIND, No. VI.), has not dwelt more fully on the main points in dispute as to the genesis of primitive thought. While justly claiming that Mr. Spencer's teaching agrees with his own as regards the origin of Animism-certainly a point of great importaice,</page><page sequence="2">Notes and Discussions. 127 he has scarcely given due prominence, or at least due discussion, to what is most original in Mr. Spencer's account of the growth of the primitive man's conception of nature. In two ways Mr. Speilcer is strikingly original: first, in repudiating the ordinary doctrine of a primaval Fetishism-the doctrine that man in his earliest state necessarily ascribed life to lifeless things, and imagined living wills in all objects; secondly, in attempting to explain this habit of vitalising lifeless objects, and all that is commonly named primitive Anthro- pomorphism, as solely the result of the belief in ancestral ghosts. The deep and increasing interest of the subject prompts mie to offer a few remarks on the genesis of primitive modes of thought as viewed under these new lights. By discarding primaval Fetishism, Mr. Spencer, it seems to me, has made a great advance towards a truer conception of primitive culture than has hitherto been attainable. The doctrine has long been assumed or asserted by anthropologists, but has never been supported by good evidence. For, though the habit of attributing life and feeling to lifeless things. is indeed universal among savage and barbaric races at the present day, and prevailed, we may infer, among the early ancestors of all existing races, in all its manifestations it presents the characters less of a primary than of a secondary habit of mind-the source of a system of extra-beliefs superimposed on deeper beliefs, and inconsistent with these though existing along with them. As Mr. Spelncer has pointed out, it is incredible that man at any stage should have been ignorant of the distinction between things living, and lifeless-a distinction necessary for his self-preservation, and one which almost all the lower animals more or less clearly recognise. .Nay, it might perhaps be more reasonable to maintain that the habit of vitalising lifeless agents really depends on a too absolute contrast of lifeless and living things as respectively characterised by inertness and spontaneous motion. Conceiving lifeless things as wholly incapable of self-originated motion, the primitive man couild only explain their sudden and life-like actions, when such occur, by attri- butiig to them life and will, or imagining some living entity ,s actingi upon them. If this were so, it is easy to see that the doctrilne of souls, by affording a simple and universally applicable means of artificially vitalising lifeless phenomena, would foster the habit to any extent. Some evidence in favour of this view may be found by examiining the later developments of primitive philosophy,-such as the doctrines of a Vital Principle and the Lawlessness of Volition-which part the living from. the dead or inert by an absolute line. It was left for modern science to remove the hard-and-fast dualism of primitive thought, and demonstrate the identity of vital and physical forces. Mr. Spencer seems less successful in working out his conception of Animism as sufficient to account for all primitive Anthropomorphism. Most readers will agree with Mr. Tylor that, the processes of verbal confusioin by means of which he conceives the transformation of ancestor-worship into Anthropomorphism to be effected, afford a very</page><page sequence="3">128 Notes and Discussions. inadequate explanation of the facts. No one can doubt that the belief in souls, though it has not created, has yet greatly fostered the habit of ascribing life to lifeless things; but the chief difficulty now encountered by the students of primitive culture, is to determine what other elements have combined with Animism to produce a mental habit at once so persistent and so unreasonable. Mr. Tylor, who would hesitate to express an opinion that had not been well con- sidered, still, in spite of Mr. Spencer's reasoning, holds by the notion of a direct personifying and myth-making tendency, on the ground that "to both the -child and the savage, human will is the first- conceived source and reason of action ". To conceive the Sun or thoe Sky, the Woods or the Rivers, " as great beings acting by will, and able to do good or harm to men," " is the easiest way in which rude minds can contemplate them ". It may be objected to this doctrine, that if, as we above supposed, lifeless things are clearly distinguished from living things by the primitive mind, such a fanciful way of conceiving them could not be the easiest way. Even in the rudest mind it would demand an " effort of imagination ". Possibly, how- ever, the doctrine of a direct personifying tendency may be reconciled with the denial of a primawal Fetishism, if we suppose that, though the primitive man has no tendency to regard inert bodies as alive, the sudden and seemingly spontaneous motions of many lifeless things will naturally suggest to him the presence of life. Mr. Fiske says primitive Anthropomorphism is simply a corollary from the Relativity of Knowledge: all things known to man are known in terms of human feeling and perception, and, while civilised minds have come to conceive physical forces as mere impersonal pressures and resist- ances, the natural tendency of primitive minds is to regard lifeless bodies as impelling or resisting one another by conscious effort. This is an explanation having a certain plausibility; but we have already seen cause to discredit any account of Anthropomorphism which represents it to be a necessary and primary mode of thought. Professor Max hiUller and others have proved with abundant illustra- tion that Language has had an immense influence in developing Anthropomorphism. Metaphors drawn from the actions of men a-d animals must, it is obvious, have aided the habit of vitalising lifeless things, if they did not actually give rise to it. So must verbal mis- -understandings. On the other hand, there appears no ground for believing with some writers that gender-terminations in names have given rise to Vitalism; much less, that they have descended from a time when all lifeless things were distinguished according to sex. Philologists have shown that genders vary in number in different languages; that their existence is dule to mere linguistic accident, and not to any primaeval personalising of nature. Some of the Emotions favour the vitalising habit. Affection, dislike, and anger are often called forth by lifeless objects, and may readily suggest a possibility of their being returned. The social instincts in general, and each man's absorbing interest in the doings of his fellow- men, tend to the same result. Indeed, of all possible factors of the</page><page sequence="4">Ndtes and Discussions. 129 parsonalising habit, probably one of the-most powerful is the instinct of expression-reading-the well-organised power which all men seem to possess of interpreting human looks and gestures. To this faculty Anthropomorphism gives unconscious exercise. We may perceive how automatically it comes into play, on reflecting how apt we are to discover in lifeless things the semblance of human features. Whether these suagestions give ground sufficient for a theory of the genesis of all Anthropomorphism, and Vitalism can only be determined by further investigation, We may hope in time to under- stand primitive thought much better thani we do at present, for it has a logic of its own, and though very unreasonable is not irrational.* A. C. OUGHTER LONIEI. * This Note was in type some months ago, but at the last had to be left over from No. VIII. Even if it had appeared in October, its author (as I afterwards learnel) would not have seen it, for he had died some weeks before. Mr. Oughter Lonie, whose life was thus cut short, after a lingering illness, at the age of 26, had been a very distinguished student of philosophy at the University of St. Andrews, whence he passed to Edinburgh to make a special study of geology. A career as a practical geologist was opened for him, but he preferred to return to the field of philosophical work. In the new edition of the Encyclopcidic&amp; Britannioa.he wrote, the article on ' Animism,' and the remarks appended to its expository part give evidence of a power of thinking that might have come to much, All those who knew him speak with admiration of his intellect and character, and his untimely fate has blasted many hopes.
