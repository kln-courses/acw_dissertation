<plain_text><page sequence="1">The The Creative Suffering of God. By Paul S. Fiddes. Pp. xi + 281. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988. £29.50. The question of the suffering of God has been around a long time, but it has had a surge in popularity in Christian theology in this century, especially since the Second World War. Paul Fiddes has reflected deeply on this and produced a fine work of constructive theology. He manages to combine many of the strengths of both German-language continental theology and Anglo-American theology and philosophy of religion. The result is a book that takes up substantial issues in theology and dares to think them through thoroughly and systematically to conclusions, yet without ever losing sight of the need for careful argument and consideration of alternatives. He is well aware of the problems with holding that God suffers: such issues as time, contingency and risk in relation to God; the perfection and completeness of God, especially as regards power; and the seductiveness of anthropomorphism and of analogical language that does not do justice to the otherness and transcend ence of God. He carefully takes up one after another such matter, and draws on a very wide range of sources. The book is well planned as a cumulative argument and it develops its key concepts as it proceeds—the desire of God, the freedom of God, the internal complexity of God, the 'perfect incompleteness' of God who comes to his glory in ever new ways, the influential power of God, and the sense of saying that God experiences death without being dead. He draws much on Process thought, but his main difference from it is in his way of being Trinitarian. This is in fact</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 317 a considerable difference, and on crucial points the pivotal influ ence is Eberhard Jüngel. He has sat at the feet of Moltmann as well as Jüngel in Tübingen, but it is significant (and, I think wise) that the latter has made the more profound impression on the question of God's suffering. It is when, in company with Moltmann and Jüngel (as well as many others whom he also discusses), he focuses on the death of God that the ultimate issues in his dangerous theme are raised. His conclusion is clear: 'We cannot think of God except as the one who has experienced death, and we cannot think of death except as the power which could not shatter God. So God uses death to define his being.' (p. 265). Overall, Dr Fiddes puts forward the most detailed case I have found for accepting that Christians should conceive of their God as suffering in a certain sense (which he is at great pains to define), and he also offers a range of apologetic arguments for this being a rational position to hold. He is also good at critically appropriating other positions, embracing them in his own movement of thought. If one does not demand of him things that he does not claim to do (such as relating Christianity to other religions), then I find that there are three main problems to be wrestled with in this book. The first is in the area of God's interaction with the world. He advocates a Process-type understanding of God's persuasive power, and is also quite clear that God overcomes death. But the sheer physicality of death is never taken seriously enough. This is a weakness shared with his mentors Moltmann and Jüngel. To attempt to have the best of the latter two as well as of Process theology should commit him to a doctrine of creation and provi dence which treats matter and its relation to the Trinitarian God. Above all, a cross-centred theology such as this should have a thorough discussion of the resurrection, but this is lacking. The second problem is perhaps the central one facing any talk of God's suffering. Is there any limit to the suffering of God? Fiddes does not want God annihilated, therefore he must set a limit. ,He does so by saying that God does suffer, but always with certainty of final victory. God freely chooses to undergo suffering for the sake of his creation, and there is risk and uncertainty for him in this, but it is never hopeless suffering. The obvious problem here is that God is excluded from one of the most acute forms of human suffering, that of despair, and so the whole enterprise of his solidarity with humanity seems to break down. It is not that I wish to suggest that a Christian doctrine of God should ascribe despair to him, only that within the logic of Christian discourse there is, for any thoroughgoing ascription of suffering to God, a quite fundamental problem about limits. To set a limit is bound to seem</page><page sequence="3">318 REVIEWS arbitrary, and it also opens the way for proponents of impassibility to argue: if not despair then why an}׳ of the rest? The key axiom for Fiddes is actually the freedom of God, taken in a basically unmodified Barthian sense. The insistence on God never losing hope is just the form in which the transcendence of God's freedom asserts itself to contain evil, death and non-being. The argument against Fiddes's modifying of Barth on the suffering of God is that Barth has been more consistent in keeping to his own principle of God's freedom. The logic of parts of Fiddes's position would point towards reconceiving God in terms less centred on freedom, will and act than Barth's position, but he does not go the whole of that way and so at this point he may be open to the accusation that when the going gets tough with God's suffering he appeals inconsistently to God's freedom. But that may be unfair in that it makes it seem a matter of a sort of abstract conceptual debate in which certain attributes are ascribed to God and have somehow to be reconciled with each other. Fiddes, on the contrary, makes it clear that his main concern is to be true to the Christian Gospel, and his explorations are all governed by his desire to let his concepts be informed by that. This brings me to the third problem. His formal position is obviously that scripture is authoritative in its witness to who God is (and he would clearly be prepared to argue for this if necessary). It seems a pity then that there is little fresh interpretation of scripture and that hermeneutical issues are rarely seen as interest ing. Perhaps this is too much to ask for in a work that does so much so well. Certainly the lasting impression of the book is of one of the livelier minds of British theology opening up, with courage and rational persuasiveness, one of the critical contemporary theological topics.
