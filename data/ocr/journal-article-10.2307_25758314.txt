<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMBIGUITY, VIOLENCE, AND COMMUNITY IN THE CITIES OF JUDAEA AND SYRIA* In the years directly preceding the first Jewish revolt, the inhabitants of Caesarea Mar itima entered into conflict concerning whether their civic terrain was one of Greeks or Jews.1 Antagonists aired varying views in their efforts to lay preeminent claims to their cities, and the Jewish author Josephus described the scruples of the Caesareans in the following passages of the Jewish War and Jewish Antiquities: BJ 2.266: Another disturbance arose when the Jews who had settled around Caesarea engaged in conflict with the Syrians within it. For they [the Jews] thought that the city was theirs, stating that its founder had been a Jew. And Herod the king was [a Jew]. The rest indeed agreed that their founder had been a Jew, but they nonetheless said that it was a city of Greeks; for he would not have set up within it statues and shrines if he had entrusted it to Jews.

For the Jews thought that they were preeminent because Herod, the founder of Caesarea, their king, had been a Jew by birth. The Syrians, however, agreed with these arguments concerning Herod, but they said that Caesarea had previously been called Strato's Tower and that at that time there had been no Jewish resident of their city. In many respects, Josephus' two accounts appear to be contradictory. First, in the two nar ratives, the non-Jewish Caesareans presented different visions of why the city belonged to them and not to Jewish residents. In the Jewish War, they stressed that their city pos sessed statues and temples, but in the Jewish Antiquities they argued that the Jews had not lived in the city when it had been called Strato's Tower. Second, the ethno-cultural terms that Josephus employs to describe the Caesareans are ostensibly inconsistent. In certain instances, he refers to them as Syrians, but in others he calls them Greeks. Yet, the seeming contradictions in the logic of Josephus' narratives accurately represent the perspectives of many "Greeks" and "Syrians" who inhabited first-century Judaea. During Josephus' lifetime, as this essay will stress, people of Syrian ethnic origin often classi fied themselves as both Greek and Syrian. In fact, outbreaks of violence that occurred in first-century Judaea erupted because Syrians were endeavoring to locate themselves in definitively Greek civic topographies whose statues and shrines differentiated them from Jewish terrains. As Josephus stated, the Syrians claimed that their city was one of Greeks based on this premise. Likewise, the two different "Syrian" or "Greek" viewpoints expressed by Josephus accurately represent those that were prevalent in first-century Judaea. Many Greeks lived in the cities that had been conquered by the Hasmonaeans and restored by the Romans. They maintained that their cities were in fact "Greek" because Jews had not settled them before the period of Hasmonaean expansion, during which Jews had become the preeminent social constituents of formerly Greek civic or ders. Similarly, in cities established by the Jewish Herodian kings, citizens could point to temples and statues as evidence that Greeks controlled the civic terrain. Seven years after the violence described above, a dispute concerning the location of a Jewish prayer house ignited a massive massacre of Jews at Caesarea. As Josephus indicates, the factionalism at Caesarea was not isolated, but Greeks and Jews of many nearby cities engaged in acts of violence during the outbreak of the Jewish revolt in 66 CE. If Josephus can be trusted, numerous cities of the Decapolis and several in Pales tine were among those afflicted by domestic turbulence.2 As this essay will argue, the 2 Josephus, BJ 2.457-480 and 7.361-368.

The commentary of Folker Siegert et al. in Flavius Josephus: Aus meinem Leben (Vita) (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2001) 176-177 examines the evidence that Josephus provides for outbreaks of local violence between Jews and gentiles that the Jewish revolt helped to stimulate. The attack on Gadara may be verified by layers indicating destruction in the late first century CE.

Such outbursts of violence were not merely the outcomes of irrational hatred and intolerance, but violence in fact constituted a form of communication through which Greeks and Jews were able to conceptualize themselves as socially constituted groups that controlled a discretely Greek or Jewish topography. Through such violence, local Greeks and Jews were able to stage themselves as discrete communities, to establish difference, and to frame the significance of their relationships with each other. Such conflicts between Greeks and Jews were stimulated by ambigui ties inspired by Hasmonaean expansion, Roman imperial intervention, and Herodian civic patronage, and outbreaks of violence enabled Greeks and Jews to materialize as coherently structured groups with exclusive claims over civic-cultic territory. In fact, violence was a form of citizen performance that collaborated with other civic institutions and rituals of Greek poleis to produce solidarity among "Greeks" who were culturally and ethnically diverse. Citizens of Greek polities were heterogeneous in terms of ethnic genealogies and cultural attributes, and even similarities in culture among Greeks did not guarantee solidarity. Shared cultural idioms had to be marked as significant emblems of Greek solidarity through civic-cultic rituals, which could at times include violence. Likewise, despite maintaining certain markers of ethno-cultural distinction, Jews often cultivated cultural forms that were similar to those of local Greek citizens.3 Amid such ambiguity, Greeks and Jews marked pagan shrines and statuary as focal points for the formation of Greek and Jewish group identifications, and dissension over such shrines and statues enabled Greeks and Jews to fashion social boundaries. Violence against Jewish "outsiders" therefore worked in tandem with civic in stitutions and rituals to consolidate Greeks who did not completely share a common ethnic background or culture. It helped ensure that Greek citizens would recognize their cultural commonalities as signs of shared group affiliation instead of framing cultural differences as significant emblems of ethnic or social division. Like circus games, theatrical spectacles, and the worship of civic divinities, all of which incorporated key civic-cultic structures and figurative art, violence was a mode of performance that enabled communities to cohere around common cultural markers and practices while obscuring points of difference.4 It also produced and stabilized boundaries between Greeks and Jews who shared many cultural traits. In short, this essay seeks to reassess 3 Lee Levine, Judaism and Hellenism in Antiquity: Conflict or Confluence (Seattle: University of Washington, 1998) 3-32 frames this issue of confluence between Hellenism and Judaism, despite points of cultural differentiation between Jews and Greeks. Most Jewish communities in Palestine were influenced by Greek culture, but in upper Galilee, Golan, or southern Judaea, more local forms persisted (24-25). 4 The central role of "amphitheatrical" hippo-stadia and the temple of Rome and Augustus in collective civic-cultic performances is materially prominent at Caesarea, but other cities of Palestine and the Decapolis had such temples or public buildings. See John Humphrey, "'Amphitheatrical' Hippo Stadia"; Lisa G. Kahn, "King Herod's Temple of Roma and Augustus at Caesarea Maritima"; and Kathryn Louise Gleason, "Ruler and Spectacle: The Promontory Palace," in Caesarea Maritima: A Retrospective after Two Millennia, ed.

Josephus' claim that a shared topography of temples and statues prompted the "Syrians" of Caesarea to assert themselves as members of a "Greek" civic order and then to sustain this claim through violence prompts this reassessment. The outbreak of the first Jewish revolt in 66 CE was induced by Roman imperial oppression and the inability of Jewish elites to maintain order.5 It was also stimulated by the intensifying diffusion of the Roman imperial cult, whose sacrifices and images could be regarded as in conflict with the Torah, within Judaea and its adjacent lands during the first century CE.6 This essay does not aim to explore the broader causes for the social fracture that pitted Rome against Jewish rebels in Jerusalem. It does, however, examine long-standing enmities among civic Greeks and Jews of Judaea and Syria who were increasingly cultivating shared cultural forms, and it will argue that the local in stability arising from tensions of civic identification were significant in influencing the revolt's development. After certain Jews of Jerusalem began to resist Roman imperial governance, such differences compelled many Greeks and Jews in the border cities of the provinces of Syria and Judaea to choose sides, thereby contributing to the revolt's regional dimensions. Temples and statues honoring the Roman emperor were mark ers of Roman imperial patronage, but they, like other temples and images, were also fulcra of debate for what constituted a Greek or Jewish civic landscape. Accordingly, the following account will first examine the formation of Greek and Jewish civic-cultic communities in pre-revolt Judaea and Syria. It will then endeavor to locate outbreaks of violence within the ambiguities and tensions that such formations generated. 5 For the failure of the Jewish ruling class, see Martin Goodman, The Ruling Class of Judaea: The Origins of the Jewish Revolt against Rome A.D. 66-70 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987) 109-133 and Id., "The Origins of the Great Revolt: A Conflict of Status Criteria," in Greece and Rome in Eretz Israel: Collected Essays, ed.

Hasmonaeans, Herodians, and contexts of violence Despite its atrocious features, violence is in itself a ritualized action that not only sharpens social boundaries between discrete groups but also actually produces, stages, and replicates groups that otherwise might not have necessarily existed or coalesced in a coherent way. If the goal of violence is not total annihilation, it serves as a model of performance and communication that generates differentiated groups and establishes relationships between them by both reenacting and perpetuating narratives of conflict.7 Such perspectives on violence have profound implications for the context of first century Judaea and the adjacent territories of Syria. In territories once controlled by the Hasmonaean dynasts, civic Greeks and Jews resorted to violence in order to frame the significations of civic topographies, to establish social boundaries, and to reenact historical narratives of local "Greek-Jewish" conflict precipitated by Hasmonaean ex pansion, Roman imperialism, and Herodian patronage. In the late-second century BCE, Hasmonaean Jews exploited the decline of the Seleucid kingdom to reclaim the "land of Judaea" (ge loudaia I 'Eretz Isra'el), their biblical inheritance.8 They conquered their surrounding territory and destroyed the pagan "idols" within it. Their conquests included the Greek cities of southern Syria and the coast of Palestine.9 The treatment that the Hasmonaeans accorded such cities, which is known primarily from Josephus' descriptions, is not entirely clear. The Hasmonaean expansion was certainly aggressive from a military standpoint.10 It also entailed sub 7 This is the basic premise of David Nirenberg's Communities of Violence: Persecution of Minorities in the Middle Ages (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996), which explores interactions and out breaks of violence among Jews, Muslims, and Christians in medieval Spain. See 8-17 for Nirenberg's theory of violence as constituting rational and communicative behavior despite its repugnant features. 8 Following Bernett, Kaiserkult (as in n. 6), 23-26 and 338-339,1 use the term "land of Judaea" to refer to the territory which Jews believed belonged to them by right of scriptural inheritance and Hasmonaean conquest and in which "the law of God ruled." This "land of Judaea," as reflected by the statement of Strabo, 16.2.21, includes the region "between Gaza and the Antilibanon as far as the Arabs." It is to be distinguished from the constantly mutating Roman province of Judaea and the region of Judaea, which, as outlined by Josephus, BJ 3.51-58, technically excludes Samaria, Peraea, and other adjacent territories. 9 Josephus, AJ 13.254-258, 275-281, 324-334, 356-364, and 393-397; BJ 1.62-66, 86-87, and 104-105. See Andrea M. Berlin, "Palestine: Between Large Forces in the Hellenistic Period," Bibli cal Archaeologist 60.1 (1997) 37-43 for the material evidence for Hasmonaean activity. 10 At certain sites, the Hasmonaean expansion appears to have left significant burn layers.

Although the legitimacy of Josephus' account of forced conversion is difficult to verify, the Hasmonaeans almost certainly granted Jewish settlers sovereignty over conquered cities.12 Jews thereby governed these cities, in Josephus' words, according to their "ancestral customs" and treated them as part of the land of Judaea. Throughout the land of Judaea, the Hasmonaeans distributed coins with aniconic features, and as a general principle, they forbade the production and use of human and animal likenesses.13 However, in the mid-first century BCE, Roman authorities intervened in the internal factionalism of the Hasmonaean dynasty, and restoring these cities to the region's non Jewish inhabitants, they organized them into Greek civic collectives (politeiai).14 Under this same settlement, the Romans limited Jewish control and preeminence to Galilee, 11 Excavations and archaeological surveys support Josephus' claims of Hasmonaean conquest in Galilee, and shifts in the distribution of coins, pottery, or bullae indicate Galilee's socio-economic reorienta tion toward Judaea.

Also, the Hasmonaean dynasts may have been receptive to statues erected in their honor outside Judaea. In exchange for certain benefactions, the Athenians honored John Hyrcanus I with a gold crown and a statue presented before the Athenian public, although Josephus erroneously attributes these honors to Hyrcanus II.

For Hasmonaeans practicing Greek modes of civic benefaction, see Gregg Gardner, "Jewish Leadership and Hellenistic Civic Benefaction in the Second Century B.C.E.," Journal of Biblical Literature 126.2 (2007) 327-343. 14 Josephus, AJ 14.74 describes how Pompey deprived Jewish "inhabitants" of the cities that they had subdued.</page><page sequence="7">348 Nathanael Andrade Judaea proper, and Peraea, although many Jews believed that all lands which had been formerly controlled by the Hasmonaeans to be rightfully part of their land of Judaea.15 Subsequently, the Roman administration at various times situated former Hasmo naean territory within the realms of the Herodian dynasts or the Roman province of Judaea. The Herodians built numerous new cities in Judaea, Samaria, and Galilee, includ ing Caesarea Maritima, Samaria/Sebaste, and Caesarea Philippi/Panias, and they often showed that they recognized a city as Greek by erecting shrines and statues within it.16 By contrast, they generally did not erect them "in a Greek manner" on what the Roman administration had framed as proper Judaean soil, an act which many Jews would have considered an illicit violation of their ancestral traditions.17 The Herodians generally adhered to a similar logic in their production and circulation of both coins with human likenesses and aniconic issues. While their "Greek" cities abounded in human and animal images that frequently referenced the significance of Roman imperial patron age in sustaining Greek civic life, their "Jewish" cities typically followed Hasmonaean paradigms that demanded their absence.18 In sum, by the mid-first century CE, the Roman administration had divided the "land of Judaea," as Jews understood it, into certain territories controlled by Greek civic com munities and others by Jewish ones, with pagan shrines and human likenesses frequently marking significant points of distinction between them. At various times, the realms of the Herodian dynasts or the Roman province of Judaea incorporated both Greek and Jewish cities despite this division. In fact, the Herodian dynasts even re-founded or es 15 Josephus, AJ 14.74-76 and 86-88 and BJ 1.155-157. According to Josephus, AJ 14.91, numerous Greek cities were "re-founded" by Gabinius, but he arranged the cities of Judaea proper, Galilee, and Peraea into administrative units of their own. See Emil Schiirer, The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Christ (175 B. C. - A. D.135), 2nd ed., vol. 2, ed. Geza Vermes and Fergus Millar (Ed inburgh: Clark, 1979) 84-183 in general for Greek cities and 184-198 for the Jewish cities that did not have Greek constitutions. Although Richard Horsley, Galilee: History, Politics, People (Valley Forge: Trinity Press International, 1995) 59-61 argues that Galilean Jews desired to be independent of the high priesthood of the Jewish Temple in the first century CE, S. Freyne, "Behind the Names: Galileans, Samaritans, Ioudaioi" in Galilee through the Centuries: Confluence of Cultures, ed. Eric M. Meyers (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1999) 39-56 asserts that the term Ioudaioi (Judaeans or Jews) encapsulates the cultural and religious commonality of all Jews, including Galileans, who worshipped at the Temple at Jerusalem. 16 The numerous Greek and Judaean foundations and building projects of the Herodians are described by Josephus in BJ 1.401^21 and 2.167-168 and AJ 15.292-298 and 331-341 and 18.27-38. At least three Greek foundations, namely Samaria/Sebaste, Caesarea Maritima, and Panias/Caesarea Philippi, had temples dedicated to Augustus. See Bernett, Kaiserkult (as in n. 6), 52-145 for analysis of these sites and relevant bibliography. 17 As Josephus, AJ 15.328-329 claims. 18 Bernett, Kaiserkult (as in n. 6), 7-15, Ead., "Kaiserkult" (as in n. 6), 205-212, and, Ead., "Roman Imperial Cult" (as in n. 6), 340-348 advocates analyzing the imperial cult in Judaea and Galilee not only in terms of active sacrifice and the maintenance of iconic images but also in terms of striated modes of veneration that avoided sacrifice and imperial figurative imagery in favor of other practices honoring the imperial family. Yet, it should be stressed that although the Herodians named cities in honor of imperial family members, which can be construed as acts of veneration, they generally tried to ensure that such likenesses did not intrude into the territory belonging to Jews, as the Romans had defined it.</page><page sequence="8">Ambiguity, Violence, and Community in the Cities of Judaea and Syria 349 tablished Greek or Jewish civic communities in these respective territories. However, the ability for the Romans and the Herodians to dictate that a Greek or a Jewish community would be the preeminent or sovereign population of a city was not perfect. As we will see, civic Greeks and Jews could still claim historical precedents for their control over a city and perpetuate memories of such preeminence with violence. 2. Heterogeneities, commonalities, and fissures: civic Greeks Internal conflicts, or staseis, had since the classical period exemplified the strengths and weaknesses of Greek civic structures. While illustrating how significant Greeks deemed citizenship to be, they also demonstrate to what extent Greeks could differ in their perceptions of ideal civic polities. Conflicts between civic factions had plagued Greek polities during the fifth and fourth centuries BCE. After the conquests of Alexander the Great, the development of Greek city-states in the Seleucid, Ptolemaic, Parthian, and Roman Near East introduced another dimension of civic conflict. Encounters between Greeks and Near Eastern peoples sometimes stimulated violence between or among ethnicities with different civic affiliations.19 Ethnic hostilities characterized the period of Hasmonean ascendancy and the years leading to Pompey's intervention in the region in 63 BCE, and as Greeks and Jews increasingly resided in the same urban landscapes, ethnic violence and civic rupture coincided. After Pompey asserted Roman imperial presence in the region, the "Greek city states" in the lands of the Herodian dynasts, the province of Judaea, and southern Syria became culturally heterogeneous entities. Many of the Greek cities "restored" by Pompey and Gabinius or established by the Herodian dynasts did not merely consist of citizens of Greek ethnic descent, but they also included people of Near Eastern extraction. The Roman administration had organized many Near Easterners into what it classified as Greek civic constitutions, and such communities were integrated into a network of peer Greek civic polities through common games and festivals.20 Greek polities and their citizen bodies therefore included to certain degrees Aramaic speakers, Near Eastern divinities, and regional architectural or material forms.21 Although such cultural forms 19 Although the category of "Near Eastern" did not exist in antiquity, I will use the term to describe non-Greek or Roman ethnic or cultural origins (such as Syrian, Phoenician, Babylonian) for pur poses of simplification. For an example of factionalism in Greece during the Peloponnesian war, see Thucydides 3.80-84. For internal strife in Athens at the end of the Peloponnesian war, see Lys. 12-13 and Xen., Hell. 2 generally. For a nearly exhaustive examination of this phenomenon in the Greek world (excluding Athens, Sparta, and Magna Graecia) during the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, see Hans-Joachim Gehrke, Stasis: Untersuchungen zu den inneren Kriegen in den griechischen Staaten des 5. und4. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. (Munich: Beck, 1985) 13-199. Tac, An. 6.42 even seems to misread ethnic violence at Seleucia on the Tigris in the early first century CE (as described by Josephus, AJ 18.372) as discord between democratic and oligarchic factions. 20 Greek games, as attested in inscriptions, were a common feature of Greek cities in Syria by the second century CE. See IGR 3.1012, an inscription found at Laodicea, and Luigi Moretti, Iscrizioni agonistiche greche (Rome: Angelo Signorelli, 1953) nos. 72 and 78. 21 See for instance David Kennedy, "The Identity of Roman Gerasa: An Archaeological Approach," Medi terranean Archaeology 11 (1998) 60-63, who describes the localizing features of the colonnades at</page><page sequence="9">350 Nathanael Andrade and performances may not appear to have been "Greek" to many classical scholars and ancient historians, local subjects reinterpreted them as such within the purview of Greek civic institutions and practices, and it was this subjective redefinition of Greekness that created the experience of a Greek citizen body among Syrians.22 The "Greeks" of the Near East therefore did not by necessity deem themselves to be descended from inhabitants of classical Greek lands, and they did not always em brace signature Greek cultural forms, such as Greek language, paideia, and gymnastic practices. Many local elites expressed their Greek identifications through such cultural performances, and the acquisition of Greek citizenship undoubtedly stimulated ethnic Near Easterners to adopt Greek cultural forms in numerous instances. Still, at times those who valued their status as Greek citizens retained Near Eastern practices, which they could recast as expressions of Greek citizen performance. Recent scholarship has therefore emphasized how heterogeneous the Greeks of the Near East could be, and this line of analysis can be extended to posit that classical forms of Greek culture, as scholars of antiquity normatively define them, were not the constant that all such Greeks shared.23 The idioms that constituted markers of Greek identification may not have been Gerasa.

To what extent Aramaic was spoken among gentiles of Judaea and southern Syria is a thorny issue due to the paucity of evidence. Sartre and Butcher are more confident about the existence of spoken Aramaic than Millar. 22 In certain cases, the use of "Greek" or "Syrian" could distinguish inhabitants of cities from those of the countryside, as discussed by Tessa Rajak, "Ethnic Identities in Josephus," in The Jewish Dialogue with Greece and Rome: Studies in Cultural and Social Interaction (Leiden: Brill, 2001) 137-146. 23 Maurice Sartre, "Nature of Syrian Hellenism" (as in n. 21), 25-29 has explored the variety of regional manifestations of "Syrian Hellenism."

For this reason, it must be stressed that the Greek city-states of the Near East were typically perceived to be Greek collectives, and all their citizens were Greek by virtue of their integration into such perceived communities. Such categorical framing raised the possibility for Aramaic speakers to lay claim to Greek citizen status even if they did not have the same access to Greek language, paideia, and gymnastic culture as local elites. As indicated by epigraphic, material, and numismatic evidence, formal and collective civic expressions, along with elite displays, relied heavily on Greek language and other Greek idioms, but the individual "Greek" citizens of communities represented in such ways did not necessarily cultivate Greek personal traits and could in theory express their Greek identifications through Near Eastern forms.24 In such instances, Greek culture alone did not bind communities. Instead, civic-cultic processes generated "Greek" citizen bodies and structured citizens to stress cultural commonalities more than differences. In certain cases, they also transformed what "Greek" culture was in ways that incorporated Near Eastern idioms, and citizens could therefore practice Near Eastern customs but construe them as the activities of legitimate Greeks. Despite varying degrees of cultural interaction during the Hellenistic period, it was during the Roman period that it had become conventional for Rome's emperors, magistrates, or client kings to integrate ethnic Near Easterners into Greek civic polities. Beginning with Pompey's expedition in the Near East, the Greek civic communities of the region had increasingly conferred citizenship upon ethnic Near Easterners under the influence of Roman imperial intervention.25 This trend continued into the third century, and it appears to have distinguished Roman rule from Seleucid and Parthian governance in the Near East.26 Although evidence indicates that ethnic Near Easterners in certain contributions elucidate the complex interactions of the Roman-era Near East, but it is worth add ing that their argumentation proposes that "Greek" and non-Greek cultural categories are stable. I would like to suggest that even the category of "Greek" culture underwent diverse interpretations and reframing among social subjects in various contexts. 24 Also see Butcher, Roman Syria (as in n. 21), 281-283 and 332-334 and Miguel John Versluys, "Ex ploring Identities in the Phoenician, Hellenistic, and Roman East," Bibliotheca Orientalis 65.3-4 (2008) 342-356. 25 For Pompey's settlement of Cilician pirates in Greek city-states, a feat which he replicated with Near Easterners in Syria/Judaea, see Strabo, 8.7.5 and 14.3.3.

Jonnes in IGSK 62.393 raises the possibility for the inclusion of certain Phrygian settlers into a Greek politeuma in a region recently ceded by the Seleucids to the Attalids, but the document's relevance to Seleucid practice is hard to determine. The inscription of Smyrna represented by OGIS 229.45-55 and 105 suggests the inclusion of soldiers of foreign origin in Greek civic polities but otherwise expect citizens to be "free and Greek," by which the descendents of Greek settlers are apparently denoted. The inscription from Smyrna even suggests that civic archives documented proper "Greek" and free status. 28 For ethnic distinctions at Parthian-era Dura-Europos, see Pollard, "Colonial and Cultural Identities" (as in n. 26), 81-100, who stresses that the Europaioi were not "racial" descendents of Greek colonists but that they perhaps constructed themselves as their ethnic heirs.

In fact, the increased inte gration of ethnic Syrians or other Near Easterners into Greek civic polities during the Roman imperial period, in addition to promoting civic solidarity among heterogeneous ethnicities, prompted profound social and cultural transformations in what it meant to be "Syrian" or "Greek." During Josephus' lifetime, the terms Syrian and Greek were laden with new civic connotations, along with previously existing linguistic, ethnic, or cultural ones. The term "Syrian" could refer to an Aramaic speaker or someone who was predominantly Near Eastern by ethnic origin or cultural characteristics, as Josephus and other authors show.31 Yet, it also denoted the ethnos, or regional collectivity, of all the people inhabiting the province of Syria that Pompey had established in 63 BCE.32 As a result, the terms Greek and Syrian could be used to describe intersecting civic categories, not mutually exclusive ethnic ones. For instance, so long as Canatha in the Decapolis was part of one of the Syrian provinces, the Canathenes called themselves Syrians.33 When it had been transferred to Arabia under the Severan emperors, they referred to themselves as Arabs.34 Likewise, while Josephus uses the term "Syrian" in various ways throughout his corpus, he describes the Caesareans as "Syrians" in reference to their provincial status. In such a context, many Greek citizens could also conceive of themselves as "Syrians," regardless of their ethnic backgrounds or cultural practices. Many such "Syrians" also framed themselves as Greeks. For instance, one hundred years or so after the first Jewish revolt, a magistrate at Scythopolis in the Decapolis erected an honorific inscription that described Scythopolis as one of the Greek city-states (poleis Hellenides) of Coele-Syria.35 Several coin issues from this city and statements of both Nicholaus of Damascus, a Greek associate of Herod I, and Josephus indicate that this was not an isolated phenomenon.36 Despite having heterogeneous communities, the 31 Josephus sometimes distinguished between Greeks and Syrians according to linguistic criteria, as he did in his discussion of Palmyra/Tadmor in AJ 8.154. Also, see generally Josephus' account of the dispersal of Noah's ancestors throughout the known world in AJ 1.120-53. A scholiast of Photius' Bibliotheca (9th century) likely retains a Roman-era conceptualization of a Syrian as a person with an explicit Near Eastern and not a Greek genealogy. While apparently describing the autobiographi cal statements of Iamblichus, the second-century author of the Babyloniaca, the scholiast claims that Iamblichus was a Syrian by genos through the lineages of both parents and that he was "not a Syrian of the Greeks who inhabited Syria, but of the autochthonous." See Photius: Bibliotheque, vol. 2, ed. Rene Henry, 2nd ed. (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 2003) 40, n. 1. 32 Strabo, 16.2.2-3, who also treats Phoenicians as Syrians, and Josephus, AJ 18.1. 33 IGRX.25. 34 IGR 1.839.

Greek and Roman games, theatrical spectacles, a common civic topography of shrines and statues, and participation in civic and imperial cults fostered perceptions of shared "Greekness" among diverse people. Violence too, when employed to protect such practices and their topographies, also contributed to the social cohesion of Greek communities. Several examples indicate the ways by which individual inhabitants of Greek city states could maintain Near Eastern practices, idioms, and ethnic connections while defining themselves as Greek by citizenship. For example, Greek citizen bodies often incorporated divinities of Near Eastern origin, such as "the Syrian goddess" at Hierapolis and Bel at Apamea, into their divine pantheons.37 Likewise, the Gospel of Mark describes Jesus' encounter with a woman living within the boundaries of Tyre. According to this text, this woman was a "Greek, but a Syro-Phoenician by genos."3S Although this pas sage could have used "Greek" to describe the woman's language, it is just as possible that it framed her in civic terms as a gentile member of a Greek polity, whether she spoke Greek or a Near Eastern language. As a Tyrian, she belonged to what by the au thor's lifetime were the regional koinon or eparcheia of Phoenicia (or Tyre), the Syrian ethnos, and the Greek city-state of Tyre, which was of course Phoenician by origin.39 In an intriguing instance, a funerary inscription in Palmyrene Aramaic commemorates a woman with a distinctly Near Eastern name as a Greek or "Ionian" (ywnyt).40 This inscription, while undated, indicates that although Aramaic and Near Eastern cultural forms flourished at Palmyra, Palmyrenes considered themselves to be citizens of a Greek 37 Lucian's de dea Syria, the notable treatise about the Syrian goddess, has been edited and translated by J.L. Lightfoot, Lucian on the Syrian Goddess (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), who provides ample discussion of the text, the goddess, and the city of Hierapolis. IGR 3.1012 shows that "Greek" games were staged at the notable site of the "Syrian" goddess. See M.F. Smith, "An Epicurean Priest from Apamea in Syria," Zeitschrift fur Papyrologie und Epigraphik 112 (1996) 120 for Bel at Apamea. 38 Mark 7:26. Also, this same woman appears in the Gospel of Matthew as a "Canaanite," which sug gests a conceptualization of her as a Phoenician- or Aramaic-speaking inhabitant of Phoenicia. Matt 15:22. 39 For the provincial koinon of Syria and the regional koina or eparcheiai in the province (eparcheia) of Syria, see Kevin Butcher, Coinage in Roman Syria: Northern Syria, 64 BC-253 AD (London: Royal Numismatic Society, 2004) 13; ILS 8819 and 8819a; and C.B.

Despite the lack of specific dating for much of the epigraphic or mate rial finds, this evidence can be used to outline a broadly occurring and long-term trend of ethnic and cultural heterogeneity within the Greek polities of Syria that began with Pompey's expedition and reached its peak during the third century and beyond. It is therefore possible to locate the civic cultures of first-century Syria and Judaea and their outbreaks of violence within the incipient stages of this process. Certain inscriptions and material remains from the first and second centuries CE indicate the persistence or reintroduction of Near Eastern culture among Greek citizens in many parts of southern Syria and Arabia.43 At Caesarea and nearby cities, Greek cultural influences were par ticularly strong. Most forms of elite display, which are typically more noticeable in the 41 The complexities of culture at Palmyra and the debate over whether it is appropriate to classify it as a Greek city are too vast to describe in detail here, but see Maurice Sartre, "Palmyre: cite grecque," Annales archeologiques arabes syriennes 42 (1996) 385-405; Ted Kaizer, The Religious Life of Pal myra: A Study of the Social Patterns of Worship in the Roman Period (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 2002) 49-50; Id., "'Palmyre, cite grecque?'

Still, evidence for an increased trend in cultural heterogeneity has surfaced at Scythopolis, whose coins and inscriptions emphasized the city's collective Greekness during the second and early third centuries CE.44 Caesarea has also produced evidence of Near Eastern influences within its Greek civic system.45 The Caesareans even conceived of Isis, a notable Egyptian divinity, as the personification of "good Greece."46 Such inscriptions and material, although not always possible to date precisely, indicate the diversity that Greek citizen bodies were beginning to acquire during the first century CE, although it would not be fully realized until the third. Even in former Hasmonean territories, cultural forms originating from the Hauran, Arabia, or Phoenicia were leaving their mark on civic-cultic cultures. As a result, many Greek citizens of Syria cultivated Greek cultural forms or ethnic ties, but others did not. Also, many Greeks may have "translated" Near Eastern forms in ways that prompted them to treat the wor ship of Near Eastern divinities or the cultivation of Near Eastern material traditions as "Greek" civic performances. It is important to stress that mythological or royal found ers of cities, although they served as important civic "ancestors" and indices of Greek solidarity, were not necessarily recognized as ethnic ancestors by individual citizens, and epigraphic evidence indicates that individuals of Near Eastern ethnic extraction continued to cultivate "non-Greek" genealogies.

In such civic cultures, outbreaks of violence also consolidated diverse Greeks amid their conflicts with Jews in the years preceding the Jewish revolt. 3. Heterogeneities, commonalities, and fissures: Jews The Romans had stripped Jewish communities of sovereign preeminence in many cities of the territory once controlled by the Hasmonaeans and restored such cities to Greek civic communities, but many Jews still believed that these cities were situated in "the land of Judaea." Although Herodian kings and Roman magistrates tried to dictate which civic terrains were to be recognized as "Greek" or "Jewish" within their regions of control, the rise and fall of the Hasmonaeans and the cultural tensions embodied by the Herodian dynasts raised ambiguities about the civic identifications of many cit ies. Within the territory once ruled by the Hasmonaean Jews, local Greek and Jewish factions could cite historical precedents to argue that their cities were in fact Greek or Jewish.49 Greeks could claim that Roman and Herodian patrons conceived of their cities as Greek by maintaining statues and temples within them. Jews could emphasize their preeminence under the Hasmonaean kings and argue that this preeminence was to continue under the Herodians, a Jewish dynasty that ruled the land of Judaea. Greeks and Jews therefore engaged in violence to determine the civic identifications of their 47 See Lichtenberger, Kulte und Kultur (as in n. 43), 345-351, for how cults and myths could be used to create "Greek" civic histories for cities. Inscriptions reveal that the citizens of the polis of Soadas were divided into "tribes" or ethnicities (&lt;j&gt;DAT| ZoumGnvriw or Biiainvoov) based on perceived ge nealogy while being citizens of a city allegedly established by Dionysus (7tpovoia Kupiou Kiiaxou Aiovuoou). See W.H. Waddington, Inscriptions grecques et latines de la Syrie (Paris: Firmin-Didot, 1870) nos. 2308-2309. Dionysus was also the mythical founder of Scythopolis. See Leah Di Segni; Id., "A Dated Inscription from Beth Shean and the Cult of Dionysos Ktistes in Roman Scythopolis," SCI 16 (1997) 139-161 and Nicole Belayche, "Foundation Myths in Roman Palestine: Tradition and Reworkings," in Ethnic Constructs in Antiquity (as in n. 29), 114-119. 48 Greek citizens could trace "non-Greek" ethnic genealogies by using the expressions "sons of or tribe iphyle). See for example the dedicatory inscription of Pouplios Ailios Germanos, a civic councilor of Canatha who claims that he is "of the [sons] of Bennathes," the name of a specific Near Eastern kinship group, "tribe," or ethnicity based on common descent (or perhaps a village). Waddington, Inscriptions (as in n. 47), 2339. 49 In other words, the "national geography" of Jews such as Josephus did not conform to the "real istic geography" imposed upon them by Roman imperial interference. Jews could cite biblical or Hasmonaean precedents to claim that the land which the Romans had stripped from their control was actually theirs. This issue is examined in detail by Ben-Zion Rosenfeld, "Flavius Josephus and his Portrayal of the Coast (Paralia) of Contemporary Roman Palestine: Geography and Ideology," Jewish Quarterly Review 91 (2000-1) 143-183.</page><page sequence="17">358 Nathanael Andrade communities, and they did so in ways that enabled ethnically and culturally diverse Greeks to produce, stage, and replicate the Greek civic order to which they belonged.50 Acts of violence concerning the significance of temples and statuary enabled Greeks to conceptualize and frame themselves as members of a discrete Greek community, despite internal variations. The Jews of Judaea and Syria varied in their adoption of Greek cultural forms, and they were not uniformly opposed to Greek culture, however defined.51 Even the Greek games that Herod established in Jerusalem in Caesar's honor, despite Josephus' condem nation and the fact that they apparently were not repeated, may have been acceptable to some Jews even if Roman conventions, such as gladiatorial and beast combat, were not.52 In fact, Herod Antipas had built the city of Tiberias in Galilee (ca. 20), and while recognizing it as a Jewish city, he had established a civic framework that was in many ways derived from that of the typical Greek polis.53 A boule, archons, and an assembly governed the city. It may have even possessed a theater and a stadium at this time, and Antipas may have staged games there in honor of the emperor Tiberius.54 Also, Tiberias was at the margins of Galilean Jewish territory; it bordered many Greek cities of southern Syria, and it was remote, as Josephus noted, from any "city of Jews" (polis Ioudaion).55 The tetrarch Herod Antipas actually maintained zoomorphic images in his palace, and 50 I emphasize that outbreaks of violence were part of a "civic" struggle because I believe that violent factions conceived of their conflict as one between different civic orders (politeiai) with their cults, not necessarily different "religious systems." In fact, as J.B. Rives, "Flavian Religious Policy and the Destruction of the Jewish Temple," in Flavius Josephus and Flavian Rome, ed. Jonathan Edmondson et aL (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005) 162-163 shows, Romans generally did not recognize the significance of Jewish theology and scripture, and they may have conceived of the Jewish cult as a civic one whose "citizens" inhabited the far reaches of the Roman empire. In this sense, the Flavians' destruction of the Jewish Temple could have been a calculated strategy to integrate Jews into a Roman imperial system. 51 As demonstrated by Fine, Art and Judaism (as in n. 13), 60-69 in his analysis of Jewish art and architecture. 52 Josephus, AJ 15.267-276. It is, however, hard to discern to what extent Jews participated in the games, as opposed to viewing them. 53 Josephus, AJ 18.36-38. If Josephus' wording can be trusted, Antipas established Greek civic institu tions at Tiberias, but he and his Jewish successors refrained from placing human images in public spaces or on coins before the first Jewish revolt.

The terms of Jewish civic belonging and performance, however, became ambiguous as many Jews adopted Greek culture or civic traits. In certain in stances, Jews participated in Greek civic performances in ways that enabled them to cultivate Greek identifications while also maintaining Judaean ethnic, cultural, or cultic affiliations. Some Jews were even willing to worship Greek civic divinities, and refer ences to "Greek" citizen groups within this period's sources could have included Jews who defined themselves as Greek citizens and behaved as such.59 Likewise, Josephus indicates that certain Greeks of Syria had been "Judaizing." Whether this word stressed conversion to Judaism or a tendency for Greeks to adopt Judaean cultural features, his statements suggest how difficult it could be to distinguish civic Greeks from Jews.60 Accordingly, the tendency for certain Greek citizens to adopt Jewish culture or worship the Jewish divinity may have blurred ethno-cultural or civic boundaries, especially as Jews opted to assume Greek civic or cultural practices. Amid such ambiguity, debates concerning pagan shrines and figurative art and the violence that they stimulated helped facilitate Jewish group definitions and stabilized boundaries between Jews and Greeks. Even before the Jewish revolt produced more clearly delineated social boundaries, fissures persisted. In fact, increased cultural commonalities among Greeks and Jews 56 Josephus, Vita, 32-42 describes the factions. Josephus' efforts to exculpate himself of the palace's destruction may result from the accusations of Justus, who led one of Tiberias' factions and later wrote an account of the conflict.

Also, Josephus, AJ 4.196-302 uses the rhetoric of Greek citizenship when he describes the politeia that Moses established for Jews. 59 Although evidence for this process in Syria and Judaea is not ideal, papyrus evidence indicates that in Egypt circumcised Jews often trained in the gymnasium.

The literary and material evidence for Galilee, where the spread of Greek culture was limited outside the cities of Tiberias and Sepphoris, indicates that even Jews who shared certain cultural traits with nearby non-Jews still could stress points of distinction in various ways, including circumcision, dietary, bathing, and sexual restric tions, and their choice of table vessels and pottery.61 Also, even if Jews were often not hostile to Greek culture, many disdained Greeks who usurped what they perceived to be "Jewish" spaces. Such Jews conceptualized the worship of Greek civic divinities as idolatry, and Jews residing in Greek city-states often possessed the same civic rights as Greek citizens (isopoliteia) while still being members of a different civic community (politeuma).62 Jews who cultivated Greek cultural forms often distinguished themselves from Greeks who acted in similar ways. Avoidance of temples, altars, and figurative art were important components of this process. 61 The civic cultures of Sepphoris and Tiberias exemplify the cultivation of Greek cultural idioms, but Mark Chancey, Greco-Roman Culture and the Galilee of Jesus (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), especially 221-229, has emphasized the relative lack of Greek culture in Galilee (especially outside Sepphoris and Tiberias) during the first century CE. See S. Freyne, "Galileans, Phoenicians, and Itureans: A Study of Regional Contrasts in the Hellenistic Age," in Hellenism in the Land of Israel, ed. John J. Collins and Gregory E. Sterling (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 2001) 204-205 for the absence of Phoenician fine ware in Galilee. Andrea M. Berlin, "Romanization and anti-Romanization in pre-Revolt Galilee," in First Jewish Revolt (as in n. 5), 62-69 emphasizes the "anti-Roman" implications of the rejection of "flashy" red-slip dishes and mold-made lamps among Galilean Jews during the first century CE. Idan Shaked and Dina Avshalom-Gorni, "Jewish Settlement in the Southeastern Hula Valley in the First Century C.E.," in Religion and Society (as in n. 54), 31 also postulate that higher concentrations of Jewish pottery finds characterized the south-eastern Hula valley of upper Galilee, while in the north-eastern valley terra sigillata bowls and Iturean pithoi suggest non-Jewish settlements. Similarly, see Dina Avshalom Gorni and Nimrod Getzov, "Phoenicians and Jews: A Ceramic Case-study," in First Jewish Revolt (as in n. 5), 74-83.

Donaldson (Waterloo, Ont: Wilfred Laurier, 2000) 249, 254, and 256-262. Recent scholarship has questioned the reliability of Josephus when he states that Jews had isopoliteia in Alexandria on the grounds that in Egypt isopoliteia was a status extended to individuals, whereas a politeuma normally constituted a collective of soldiers that developed its own governing institutions, without necessarily any bearing on the exercise of isopoliteia. Still, isopoliteia may have been a col lective privilege exercised by Jewish politeumata in Judaea. Hasmonaean expansion and its aftermath could have resulted in separate politeumata that exercised equal citizen rights (isopoliteia) in Strato's Tower/Caesarea and nearby cities, and Josephus may have been misinterpreting how Jews of Egypt were organized in light of what he knew about isopoliteia and Jewish politeumata in his home region.

Herod I, for instance, triggered a rebellion by erecting a golden eagle at the gate of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, but certain Jews seem not to have taken offense to this image.63 Despite widespread concerns about anthropomorphic and zoomorphic images among Jews, some Jews nonetheless interacted with figurative art in ways that would not have distinguished them from Greeks at all. In fact, Jews of this period had differing views concerning what human and animal likenesses signified, and they disputed whether iconic images were idolatrous likenesses or simply artistic representations that were not problematic so long as they were not actively worshipped. Also, what constituted an idolatrous image could be a point of contention, and this was certainly the case when Herod I set up trophies in the theater of Jerusalem.64 Despite such differences of perspective, many contemporary Jews, following a strict observance of certain passages from Exodus and Deuteronomy, denounced and avoided figural representations.65 Even Jews who shared many points of commonality with Greeks could avoid contact with what they perceived to be illicit figural images and pagan shrines.66 For instance, Jewish domestic units sometimes housed mosaics or 63 Josephus, AJ 17.149-156. 64 The surviving evidence indicates some measure of image toleration during this period. Herod I had erected a golden eagle at the gate of the Temple's sanctuary in Jerusalem, and only certain Jews expressed offense as Herod's death became imminent. Josephus, AJ 17.149-155. Fine, Art and Juda ism (as in n. 13), 60-81 pays close attention to the actual evidence for the use of images in Judaea and shows how Jews were divided over which art forms constituted idolatrous images. Images of an eagle adorned some of Herod's issues, and Tyrian sheqels proliferated (74-76). Achim Lichten berger, "Bilderverbot oder Bildervermeidung? Figiirliche Darstellungen im herodianischen Judaa," in Herodes und Jerusalem, ed. Linda-Marie Giinther (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 2009) 71-97 also examines evidence of Jewish toleration for human and animal images during this period. Ya'akov Meshorer, A Treasury of Jewish Coins from the Persian Period to Bar Kokhba (New York: Amphora, 2001) 73-78 even raises the possibility that silver Tyrian sheqels were minted at Jerusalem under the Herodians until the Second Temple's destruction. After the fall of the Temple, many Jews did not prohibit contact with statues so long as they were not actively worshipped, as Yaron Z. Eliav, "View ing the Sculptural Environment: Shaping the Second Commandment," in The Talmud Yerushalmi in Graeco-Roman Culture III, ed. Peter Schafer (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2002) 421-423 argues. Likewise, certain Jews of the Second Temple period could tolerate and even patronize the produc tion or use of such likenesses so long as they were not the actual objects of cult, a feature which certainly characterized Herodian activity. For trophies in the theater and the debate about whether they constituted idolatrous human likenesses, see Josephus, AJ 15.276-279. 65 Exod 2:4; Deut 4:15-18 and 5:7-8. See Lee Levine, "Jewish Archaeology in Late Antiquity: Art, Architecture, and Inscriptions," in The Cambridge History of Judaism, vol. 4 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006) 549 and the important chapter of Fine, Art and Judaism (as in n. 13), 60-81, which explores the complex views of Jews on figurative art.

When Greeks and Jews made exclusive claims to their civic topographies, they did so by erecting or destroying such images or altars in what constituted a symbiotic process. The significance with which Greeks and Jews endowed such materials prompted acts of violence, but violence helped make these materials into meaningful symbols of social division. This process generated perceptions of clear difference in the nebulous face of cultural confluence and the potential disinte gration of communal identities. Even Tiberias, where Greek cultural forms proliferated and a palace housed zoomorphic images, produced factions that attacked Greek civic terrains in Syria, including temples, at the outbreak of the Jewish revolt.68 Amid the failure of the Herodian dynasts and their Roman patrons to engender con sensus among local communities of Greeks and Jews, two theoretical possibilities for civic fracture, if not more, became manifest, and they were located in efforts to identify legitimate citizen bodies, their proper civic-cultic cultures, and the constituent elements of their topographies. First of all, some Greek cities of southern Syria and Judaea that the Roman administration had "restored" included self-governing Jews who remembered how their ancestors had held primacy under the Hasmonaeans and therefore claimed that their cities were located in the land of Judaea.69 Second, some Greek cities founded by the Herodian kings possessed Jewish communities that asserted their priority because a Jewish monarch had founded the city. According to their perspective, a city established by a Jewish monarch in the "land of Judaea" constituted a Jewish city. The outbreaks of violence that erupted in Iamnia and Caesarea Maritima, as related by Philo and Josephus, were practical manifestations of these theoretical possibilities.70 They produced and sustained perceived differences between Greeks and Jews despite the cultural and ethnic heterogeneity of Greek citizens and the cultural attributes that Jews shared with them. Hasmonaean conquest, Roman intervention, and Herodian rule had raised ambiguities about civic identities and topographies. These ambiguities stimulated violence. 67 At Jerusalem and in the cities and villages of Galilee, figural art did not adorn walls, lamps, and coins. See Aviam, "First Century Jewish Galilee" (as in n. 54), 21-24. In one instance, however, a representation of a fish has been discovered. See Chancey, Greco-Roman Culture (as in n. 61), 197. 68 Josephus, Vita 32-42, 67, and 134. 69 See Martin Goodman, "Jewish Attitudes to Greek Culture in the Period of the Second Temple," in Jewish Education and Learning, ed. Glenda Abramson and Tudor Parfitt (Chur, Switzerland: Harwood, 1994) 171-172 for the increasing "Greek" self-identification of cities that refused to be integrated into the Hasmonaean state; many of these cities celebrated their restoration with coins dated to Pompeian years. 70 It is important to emphasize that these acts of violence were not necessarily the product of a general racist disposition or "anti-Semitism," but as will be shown, they were triggered by a specific context of Roman intervention and uncertainty of status within a local environment. For a similar emphasis on locating outbreaks of violence to contextual factors and not a broader anti-Jewish sentiment spanning antiquity, see John J. Collins, "Anti-Semitism in Antiquity: The Case of Alexandria," in Ancient Judaism in its Hellenistic Context, ed. Carol Bakhos (Leiden: Brill, 2005) 9-30.</page><page sequence="22">Ambiguity, Violence, and Community in the Cities of Judaea and Syria 363 4. Violence and narratives of Jewish and Greek supremacy When Pompey and Gabinius "restored" the Greek civic bodies and spaces that Jews had controlled under the Hasmonaeans, they had empowered local Greek populations to reassert control over their civic-cultic topographies. Such Greek civic communities celebrated their renewed sovereignty by minting coins with human likenesses. These coins had "Pompeian" dates that reflected the institution of calendars that had begun with their cities' rebirth.71 The production of such coins and modes of dating undoubt edly perpetuated memories and narratives of Greek sovereignty that conflicts with Jews had endangered. These coins therefore reflect the concerns that prompted outbreaks of violence, but they also operated with acts of violence to express Greek identifications and to perpetuate narratives of conflict. Yet, while Greeks used such coins to cite the supremacy that they enjoyed under the Seleucids and after the intervention of Pompey, Jews could cite Hasmonaean precedents for the same. Within such contexts, Greeks and Jews entered into violent confrontations through which they renewed and expressed their memories of their city's "Greek" and "Jewish" pasts. Similarly, numerous coins that Greek authorities minted during the early stages of the Jewish revolt and shortly after its spate of civic conflicts demonstrate the significance with which Greeks endowed acts of civil violence. They show that outbreaks of factional violence were intimately tied to Greeks' efforts to define their civic bodies and cultic topographies. These coins did not merely express cities' loyalty to Rome or circulate images of divinities and the Roman emperor Nero. Because figurative art and cults to both civic deities and Roman emperors distinguished Greek landscapes from Jewish ones, this development alone would have been important. Yet, these coins also deviated significantly from previous issues by innovatively depicting Greek deities as defending their civic-cultic landscapes. In 67/8, Gerasa minted a coin with Nero's typical profile on the obverse, but the reverse depicted Artemis advancing as she held a bow and drew an arrow from her quiver. While producing obverses with a standard profile of Nero's head, Caesarea coined reverses showing a figure of Tyche holding a standard and a bust of a human head, presumably Nero's. Reverses from Ascalon showed Phanebal as he brandished a harpe (a type of sickle) and a shield with a palm. On the obverses of these same coins, Nero's head was depicted with an altar beside it. Coins of Gadara, instead of rendering its typical profile of Tyche's head, displayed a palm beside a complete por trayal of Tyche holding a cornucopia.72 An obverse from Nysa-Scythopolis presented a standard profile of Dionysus' head with an ivy crown, but its reverse showed a shield and 71 As Alia Kushnir-Stein, "City Eras on Palestinian Coinage," in Coinage and Identity in the Roman Provinces, ed. Christopher Howgego etal. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005) 157-158 dem onstrates, sixteen cities in southern Syria calculated their civic eras to the years 64-59 BCE because of the re-foundations of Pompey. Likewise, Mark A. Chancey, "City Coins and Roman Power in Palestine: From Pompey to the Great Revolt," in Religion and Society (as in n. 54), 105-106. Many such coins were minted during the reigns of the Julio-Claudian emperors, and some as early as the proconsulship of Gabinius. See RPC 1.4807-4841,4855^1857, and 4894-4896. 72 RPC 1.4822,4835,4839,4862,4889, and 4892.

Caesarea's Tyche may also have a parazonium, a form of dagger, at her waist; see BMC Palestine,</page><page sequence="23">364 Nathanael Andrade two spears enclosed by a victory wreath. By combining in various ways potent images of altars, victory palms, weapons, and civic deities on coins, Greek authorities defined and staged experiences of Greek civic-cultic topographies which divine and human agency, as well as Roman patronage, were to defend against a Jewish threat. This type of ideological framework stimulated and informed violence between Greeks and Jews. These coins cohere with the testimony of Philo and Josephus, who also attribute such violence to disputes over the presence of shrines, altars, and statues in civic-cultic ter rains. While occurring decades before the first Jewish revolt, the violence that erupted in Iamnia, or Yavneh, can be placed within such a context. Iamnia, located along the coast of Palestine, was a Greek city in which Jews claimed priority because of a Hasmonaean past. According to 1 Maccabees, Iamnia and its neighboring city Ioppa had been captured by Simon Maccabeus and many of their Greek citizens expelled, but in the mid-first century BCE, Pompey and Gabinius "restored" both cities to their former residents and local Near Easterners.73 Only decades later, however, Julius Caesar declared the Jews of Ioppa to be the city's sovereign population. He did so on the grounds that it had been in Hasmonaean hands when the Romans and the high priest Simon Maccabeus forged an alliance nearly a century earlier.74 Because Simon had captured Iamnia during this same period, this edict perhaps stimulated the Jews of Iamnia to claim preeminence within the city. Accordingly, in the mid-first century CE, Philo, stating that Iamnia was a city of Judaea, argued that the city's Jews were its "native" inhabitants against whom metoikoi plotted.75 Philo used the term metoikoi to describe the members of the Greek politeia that Pompey and Gabinius had organized, and it must be stressed that these "Greek" citizens were likely of diverse ethnic extraction and cultural persuasion. Unlike Philo, Josephus did not place Iamnia within the district of Judaea proper, but he added it to his list of Judaea's eleven administrative divisions, thereby suggesting that Jews legitimately controlled it even in the eyes of Rome.76 The civic Greeks of Iamnia, however, did not share the perspective of Philo, Josephus, or other Jews who declared Iamnia to be a Jewish city based on their memo ries of Hasmonaean supremacy and Roman complicity. They therefore attempted to cast the city's urban topography as a discretely Greek civic space by situating an altar within it. During the reign of Gaius Caligula, they erected an improvised altar to the emperor; this monument affirmed the city's status as a Greek polls legitimated by Ro man imperial patronage. In Philo's account, local Jews were enraged by this sacrilegious monument located within "the holy land," that is, the land of Judaea. They destroyed the altar, thereby both desecrating a symbol of Roman authority and challenging what 13-15, nos. 5-29, PI. 2.11-13. On some of Caesarea's reverses, a male figure also holds a standard and a bust (Nero's?). See RPC 1.4863 and BMC Palestine, 15-16, nos. 30-33, PL 2.14. 73 Josephus, AJ 13.215; 1 Mace 10:69, 13:11, and 15:40. 74 Josephus, AJ 14.205. 75 Philo, Leg. 200-203. 76 Josephus, BJ 3.56. For Iamnia restored by Gabinius, see Josephus, BJ 1.166; for its being under the control of Alexander Jannaeus, see Josephus, AJ 13.395. Josephus seems to include Iamnia and Ioppa in his "realistic geography" of Judaea, which suggests that he believed that Jews had preemi nence within the region in the eyes of the Roman imperial administration. See Rosenfeld, "Flavius Josephus and his Portrayal" (as in n. 49), 162-163 and 180.</page><page sequence="24">Ambiguity, Violence, and Community in the Cities of Judaea and Syria 365 the altar had connoted on a local level: that Greeks were preeminent within the city. However, according to Philo, Gaius ordered that a giant gold statue of Zeus, cast in his own likeness, be erected in the inner sanctuary of the Jewish Temple of Jerusalem in retaliation.77 Despite his cruelty and erratic character, Gaius' statue may reflect a logical assessment of what statuary meant within the cultural politics of first-century Judaea. By imposing his likeness on the Jewish Temple of Jerusalem, Gaius intended to mar an urban landscape whose lack of human images expressed Jewish authority and control.78 In fact, at Dora, Greeks would later erect a statue of the emperor Claudius in a Jewish assembly house to a similar effect.79 Nonetheless, despite Gaius' support of the city's Greeks, Iamnia was a hotbed of Jewish resistance to Roman authority during the first Jewish revolt.80 Both the Roman administration and the Herodian dynasty that it supported had failed to ease local tensions or give a single group clear authority over its civic terrain. Such uncertainties had fulminated in violence when Greeks erected an altar to demarcate a Greek civic-cultic topography. Although Greeks and Jews at Iamnia may have shared many cultural features, this outbreak of violence produced conceptual boundaries between coherent Greek and Jewish groups. 5. Caesarea: violence and narratives of Herodian rule The activities of Herodian founders and patrons also raised ambiguities for cities which they recognized as Greek despite the presence of Jewish populations, as the passages of Josephus presented at the beginning of this essay demonstrate. These ambiguities were only exacerbated by the fact that the Herodians, while participating in Jewish cult, behaved in ways that many of their opponents claimed to be transgressive of Jewish ancestral traditions. Their patronage of pagan shrines and anthropomorphic statuary in their Greek cities, such as Caesarea Maritima, was most notable among them. From roughly 21 to 11 BCE, Herod I had expanded the city of Strato's Tower and renamed it Caesarea, while establishing within it a theater, an amphitheater, a temple of Rome and Augustus, and quinquennial games.81 Aside from the massive artificial harbor, the large temple to Rome and Augustus was the architecturally dominant feature of the city. It was virtually located on the exact point at which the city's two main streets and harbor 77 Philo, Leg. 188 and 200-203. 78 Jews who confront the Syrian legate Petronius in Josephus, BJ 2.184-198 (especially 195) and AJ 18.262-272 (especially 271) maintain that the Jewish Temple and the city of Jerusalem must be free of human likenesses. See Bernett, Kaiserkult (as in n. 6), 279-280 for political implications and bibliography. 79 This episode is recounted in Josephus, AJ 19.300-311. 80 Vespasian captured and garrisoned it in Josephus, BJ 4.130. 81 The constructions are described by Josephus, AJ 15.331-341 and BJ 1.408^15. Under Herod and his successor Archelaus, the harbor maintenance took priority over the creation and upkeep of the rest of the city. In fact, the areas near the theater and the stadium, which were built in open spaces south of the city, were not inhabited by civilians during the city's early development. See Ypsef Po rath, "The Evolution of the Urban Plan of Caesarea's Southwest Zone: New Evidence from Current Excavations," in Caesarea Maritima: A Retrospective (as in n. 4), 106-110 and 119.</page><page sequence="25">366 Nathanael Andrade converged.82 The city's hippodrome and theater, which were situated near the king's Greek-style palace and the city's southern gate, were also conspicuous features even if they were somewhat more remote from the city's topographic center; the theater pos sessed elements typically to be found in both Greek and Roman theaters.83 Herod had thereby built the palace, theater, and stadium to function as an architecturally cohesive quarter that enabled him to preside over Greek games and races and to interact with their crowds. By so doing, he reaffirmed his patronage of the city.84 Equally as significant, Herod had founded the city with a Greek politeia, and both local Greeks and Roman authorities understood it to be a Greek polish5 Its civic topog raphy, monuments, and even its name were laden with symbols of Roman patronage and power that nonetheless operated within a field of signification through which civic Greekness was expressed. This aspect of the city's Greek civic life was important. The presence of Roman symbols certainly enabled the Caesareans to conceptualize their connection to Rome, but at the same time the Caesareans had reconfigured and recast these symbols to articulate Greek identification and civic affiliation. Consequently, when the city's Greeks argued with local Jews that their city was Greek because it pos sessed temples and statues, the city's primary shrine, which was consecrated to Rome and Augustus, was undoubtedly considered one of these temples that proved the city's Greek rank and status.86 In fact, the temple's cult statues, as Josephus claims, imitated Greek works of art. Herod had consciously modeled the statue of Augustus on that of Zeus at Olympia, and he had rendered its image of Rome in imitation of the cult statue of Hera at Argos.87 While Caesareans conceived of themselves as Greeks, they often used Roman symbols to do it. In this local context, the worship of Rome and Augustus did not merely signify perceptions of Romanness or "Romanization." It distinguished Greek cities from Jewish ones. Around the year 60 CE, a faction that Josephus called both "Syrians" and "Greeks" debated with local Jews over which group had sovereignty over the city.88 As discussed 82 See Ehud Netzer, The Architecture of Herod, the Great Builder (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2006) 98 for a plan of the city and 103 for the observation that the temple's location on the city's massive harbor was very conspicuous. 83 See Netzer, Architecture of Herod (as in n. 82), 107-108 and 111-118 for a description of the specific architectural elements of these structures and 279 for analysis. 84 As emphasized by Gleason, "Ruler and Spectacle" (as in n. 4), 224. 85 Caesarea only became a truly Roman city under the Flavians when it was made a formal colony with a Latin decurio of civic elites. Starting with the reign of Domitian, the coinage of Caesarea carries reverse legends of the Colonia Prima Flavia Augusta Caesarea rendered in Latin. See BMC Palestine, 16-17. Previously, all legends were in Greek. Epigraphic references to a decurio and de curiones date to the second or third century. See The Greek and Latin Inscriptions of Caesarea, ed. Clayton Miles Lehmann and Kenneth Holum (Boston, MA: American Schools of Oriental Research, 2000) nos. 3, 8, 10, and 11. When Caesarea minted municipal bronzes during the mid-first century, the coins possessed likenesses of Roman emperors and empresses not found on coins of recognized Jewish cities. See RPC 1.4858-4865. 86 Josephus, BJ 2.266. For statues and temples, see AJ 15.339 and BJ 1.414. 87 Josephus, BJ 1.414. 88 The conflict is often framed by scholars as having been a matter of obtaining isopoliteia, whether as defined as a "quest for citizenship" in the Greek politeia or as an effort to belong to a separate</page><page sequence="26">Ambiguity, Violence, and Community in the Cities of Judaea and Syria 367 at the beginning of this essay, in Josephus' Jewish War, the Jews stressed that they possessed the city because Herod I, the city's founder, had been a Jew, and their argu ments implied that Caesarea was located within the land of Judaea.89 The "Syrians," by contrast, argued that Herod I had erected pagan temples and statues to create a "Greek" civic terrain. In Josephus' Jewish Antiquities, the Syrians stated that the city had initially been called Strato's Tower and had possessed no Jewish residents under that name.90 Their arguments emphasized that the Jews had never claimed this city to be "Jewish" before the period of Hasmonaean expansion or perhaps even before Herod had refounded Strato's Tower as Caesarea. Ultimately, this debate triggered outbreaks of violence until the emperor Nero decreed that the Greeks ruled the city.91 The discrepancies of Josephus' two accounts of the violence at Caesarea are to some extent a factor of Josephus' own authorship and cultural mapping. In the Jewish War, he generally presented Jews as framing their self-perceptions as Jews by renouncing the iconic images of Greeks, while in his Jewish Antiquities he did not place so strong an emphasis on this theme.92 Similarly, the narrative of the Jewish War focuses foremost on the gruesome disaster of the first Jewish revolt and its origins in the Herodians' complicity with Roman imperial intervention, which had contributed to a resurgence of Greek city-states adorned with Greek and Roman temples and statues in the region. In this instance, the Syrians' emphasis that Herod had founded their city with shrines and statues to produce a city of Greeks was appropriate to the work's narrative arch. By contrast, in the much more macroscopic Jewish Antiquities, which presents a history of the Jews from the beginning of the world, the Syrians' argument that Strato's Tower had not been inhabited by Jews would have enabled Josephus to locate the disasters of his lifetime within centuries of socio-political transformation and conflict between ethnic politeuma. See for instance John S. Kloppenborg, "Ethnic and Political Factors in the Conflict at Caesarea Maritima," in Religious Rivalries (as in n. 62), 241-245. However, according to my interpretation of Josephus' statement in AJ 20.173 that the civil disturbance occurred "concerning isopoliteia," isopoliteia was not so much a status that Jews were trying to achieve as one that they had already attained. In fact, it is most likely that Jews already belonged to a separate politeuma that possessed isopoliteia, or rights equal to those of the Greeks. The primary problem was that the status of isopoliteia continued to raise questions about which population of the city could claim priority, the Greeks or the Jews. Accordingly, after Josephus claims that the conflict was about isopoliteia, he argues that both factions were arguing about priority, not equality, and in BJ 2.266, he stresses that Greeks and Jews claimed the city to be theirs. The conflicts at Caesarea therefore arose because the city, from the perspectives of its inhabitants, was not clearly "Greek" or "Jewish." See Aryeh Kasher, Jews and Hellenistic Cities in Eretz-Israel: Relations of the Jews in Eretz-lsrael with the Hellenistic Cities during the Second Temple Period (332 BCE - 70 CE) (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1990) 231-232 and 258. 89 See Monika Bernett, "Herodes und die Stadt in Judaa," in Herodes und Rom, ed. Linda-Marie Giin ther (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 2007) 49-. 90 Josephus, AJ 20.173. 91 Nero's edict was probably enacted in 61. See Schiirer, History of the Jewish People (as in n. 15), 117. 92 Such discrepancies and issues of cultural mapping are explored by Jason Von Ehrenkrook, "Sculpture, Spaces, and the Poetics of Idolatry in Josephus' Bellum Judaicum" JSJ 39.2 (2008) 170-191.</page><page sequence="27">368 Nathanael Andrade "Syrians" and Jews.93 This conflict was a durable theme of the Jewish Antiquities. At the beginning of this work, Josephus noted that the Greeks referred to the Arameans, the descendents of Noah's grandson Aram, as "Syrians," and subsequently Josephus proceeded to call the Arameans of biblical antiquity Syrians and to describe the wars that the Hebrews had waged against them. Josephus' Jewish Antiquities also at times presents the Hasmonaean expansion as a war against "Syrians" even when the Greek city-states of Syria or Phoenicia were the principle targets. In sum, Josephus generally conceived of Caesarea as a city of Syrians who defined themselves as Greeks, but his Jewish War stressed its Greek affiliations while his Jewish Antiquities stressed its Syrian ones. Despite such different points of emphasis, Josephus indicates that the lingering conflict between the civic Greeks and Jews hinged on an effort to define a discretely Greek or Jewish topography in the face of ambiguities generated primarily by Caesarea's re-foundation by a Jewish king. Such dissension had been frequent among the Greek city-states overseen and patronized by Herodian dynasts, and civic Greeks sometimes feared that Jewish monarchs would empower Jews against them and their civic-cultic structures. A fragment of Nicholaus of Damascus claims that after the death of Herod I in 4 BCE, the representatives of Herod's Greek cities requested to be placed under Augustus' direct control amid numerous eruptions of violence between Greeks and Jews.94 Likewise, the Greek population of Gadara restored by Pompey resented being in the domain of Herod I and petitioned Augustus to include it in the province of Syria while accusing Herod of pillaging shrines.95 For similar reasons, the Greeks of Caesa rea had emphasized that Herod, despite being Jewish, had created a Greek landscape by decorating the city with human likenesses and shrines, a claim that referenced the temple of Augustus and Rome and its cult statues that had been cast in imitation of specific classical Greek prototypes. Directly before the first Jewish revolt in 66, a Caesarean expanded a workshop so that it blocked the entrance of a Jewish assembly hall, where another Caesarean shortly thereafter sacrificed a bird on a chamber pot.96 These inflammatory acts prompted out breaks of violence that resulted in the massacre of Caesarea's Jewish population, and it was shortly after such outbreaks that Caesarea's mint produced coins with its Tyche brandishing a standard and what appears to be a bust of Nero's head. As stated at this essay's beginning, Josephus claims that this massacre stimulated Greeks throughout southern Syria and coastal Palestine to attack their cities' Jews and prompted Jews from Galilee to raid nearby Greek cities during the opening stages of the Jewish revolt.97 Despite Josephus' potential for exaggeration and frequent lack of detail, it is tempting 93 Josephus, AJ 1.144, 8.363-420, 9.159-185, and 13.374. 94 Nicholaus of Damascus, FGrH II, 90.136. Preserved by Constantine Porphyrogenitus. 95 See Josephus, AJ 15.354-357. 96 Josephus, BJ 2.289. 97 The violence that occurred at Philadelphia, Heshbon, Gerasa, Pella, Scythopolis, Gadara, Hippus, Ptolemais, Caesarea, Sebaste, Ascalon, and Tyre is recorded in Josephus, BJ 2.457-480. See the analysis of S. Freyne, "The Revolt from a Regional Perspective," in First Jewish Revolt (as in n. 5), 47-50, who notes problems with an uncritical acceptance of Josephus' description of general hostility toward Jews and argues that scholars should not posit general anti-Jewish attitudes but outbursts of animosities triggered by specific contexts.</page><page sequence="28">Ambiguity, Violence, and Community in the Cities of Judaea and Syria 369 to posit that such violence was anchored in the efforts of Greeks and Jews to assert their priority over their civic-cultic terrains amid lingering doubts about their cities' preeminent populations.98 The claim of Caesarea's Syrians that their city's topography of temples and statues belonged to "Greeks" supports this perspective. 6. Conclusion An outcome of the Jewish revolt was that Greeks were momentarily able to resolve ambiguities concerning civic-cultic topographies by aligning themselves with the Ro man forces intervening in the region. By destroying the Jewish Temple of Jerusalem and suppressing local Jewish factions, Roman forces enabled internally diverse Greek civic populations in many cities to define their civic-cultic territories and to frame shared Greek civic affiliations even if their cities had been ruled, patronized, or founded by Jewish kings. Roman victory constituted another stage by which Greek populations were able to generate narratives of their city's Greekness, to replicate historical perspectives of their Greek past, and to perpetuate memories and acts of conflict with Jews for sovereignty over their civic terrains. Although certain social disturbances occurred in the ensuing decades, after Rome suppressed the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132-35, the cities of Palestine remained firmly in the hands of discrete Greek citizen bodies, which may explain why acts of local communal violence for the most part ceased thereafter. In such ways, conflicts with Jews enabled the ethnically and culturally heterogene ous civic populations of Caesarea and other Greek city-states of Palestine to frame their common Greekness. Although the citizens of such cities consisted of some who may have conceptualized themselves as "Syrian" by both ethnicity and culture and others who classified themselves as Greek by the same criteria, they defined themselves in civic terms as members of a Greek community within a Syrian regional collectivity. Conflicts with Jews for civic-cultic topographies helped sharpen their self-perceptions as Greek citizens, and amid the first Jewish revolt, civic rituals and violence were closely inter twined. The civic Greeks at Caesarea in fact acclaimed Vespasian's army as it returned from its successful operations in Galilee, and they witnessed the execution of Jews in their amphitheater when Titus made his way north from Jerusalem to Antioch in 70 CE. Such group activities and spectacles staged before a citizen audience reinforced percep tions of civic Greekness, and the Roman administration's decision to have Caesarea's mint produce coin issues celebrating a "conquered Judaea" conform to this context of Greek civic performance and violence.99 Similar claims can be made for the Greek polities of southern Syria over the first and second centuries CE. After being attacked by the Jews in 66, many of them restored their topographies of shrines and statues, and these objects constituted indices of their collective Greekness. The Gerasene politai, for instance, oversaw the restoration of 98 For a similar outlook, see Uriel Rappaport, "Jewish-Pagan Relations and the Revolt against Rome in 66-70 C.E.," The Jerusalem Cathedra 1 (1981) 81-95. 99 Josephus, BJ 7.104-106 and Ya'akov Meshorer, Ancient Jewish Coinage, vol. 2: Herod the Great through Bar Cochba (New York: Amphora, 1982) 288-289.</page><page sequence="29">370 Nathanael Andrade their temple of Zeus and a divine likeness associated with the protection of suppliants. The financial benefactor to this restoration was himself a suppliant who had very likely sought refuge at the temple amid the turbulent violence of the Jewish revolt's opening stages.100 As described previously, the Scythopolitans later minted coins and erected an honorific inscription that described their city as one of the poleis Hellenides of Coele-Syria. Despite their internal ethnic and cultural disparities, the citizen bodies of Iamnia, Caesarea, Scythopolis, and other such cities constituted Greek collectivities, to be distinguished from Jewish ones. These cities' civic-cultic institutions and rituals facilitated the formation of discrete "Greek" citizen bodies amid internal ethnic and cultural variation. During the first century CE, so did violence against Jews.
