<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Perchance my hand may touch the lyre": Orality and Textuality in Nineteenth-Century Deaf Poetry JENNIFER ESMAIL In his book The Lost Senses: Deafness and Blindness (1845), deaf1 British writer and missionary John Kitto declares that deaf people cannot write poetry. Kitto argues, "For want of hearing others speak, it is next to impossible that [a deaf person] should have that knowledge of quantity and rhyme which is essential to harmonious verse."2 However, after explaining this personal disqualification, Kitto provides specimens of his own verse to demonstrate his attempt at "the tuneful art" (1:171). Kitto suggests that "if the reader can discover the formal errors—the bad rhymes—the halting, hopping, stumping feet—which I am unable to detect, then my proposition is demonstrated; but if he can make no such discoveries, it must then be admitted with some quali fication" (1:171). While Kitto's poetry provides evidence of his poetic ability, his preface exposes his anxieties about writing in a genre that he believed required the ability to hear. Kitto's strange vacillation between declaring the impossibility of a deaf poet and demonstrating the viability of his own poetry reflects the complicated position inhabited by a nineteenth-century deaf poet writing in English. Kitto, like all other nineteenth-century poets, both hearing and deaf, was facing a cultural climate that linked written poetry with orality, especially in terms of formal features including rhythm and rhyme. Kitto was not the only deaf poet who felt ambivalent about participating in a genre tied to sound and speech: about a dozen American and British deaf poets, who used signed languages or fingerspelling to communicate, published one or more volumes of work during the Victorian period. These deaf poets often acknowledged that their position was contradictory in a cultural paradigm that invested poetry with a special relationship to aurality and orality. This essay will investigate how these nineteenth-century deaf poets balanced cultural beliefs about the primacy of sound to poetry with their own desire to sever hearing ability from poetic ability and will explore what this tension reveals about nineteenth-century perceptions of the relation between sound and poetry. By considering both the 509</page><page sequence="2">510/ VICTORIAN POETRY formal conventionalism and the thematic radicalism of their constructions of sound in poetry, I will argue that these poets mobilized the tension between sound and deafness. This essay will posit that nineteenth-century deaf poets ambivalently maintained an idea of "vocality" in their poetry while underscor ing how that imagined "voice" was a silent construct of print. My argument about nineteenth-century deaf poetry also intervenes in contemporary critical conversations about sound in poetry because deaf poetry disrupts any model of poetry that imagines sound as essential to poetic craft and consumption. Despite the potential barriers to deaf poetic production, poetry was a valued element of nineteenth-century deaf culture. Important events in the deaf community, including deaf school graduations, for instance, were com memorated with poems written and signed by pupils.3 Furthermore, the vast network of periodicals created by and for deaf people, including the widely circulated deaf school newspapers known as the Little Paper Family,4 published poetry by deaf writers in monthly poetry columns. The nineteenth-century poets I will examine were all heavily involved with this culture of deaf poetry. They constitute what I will propose is the canon of nineteenth-century deaf poetry in English from the 1830s to the 1890s. While these poets had diverse class, gender, national, racial, educational, audiological, and historical experi ences, in this essay I focus on the one important quality they shared: a concern that their deafness might preclude poetic achievement.5 For example, early poets like Kitto (1804-1854)6 and American poets John Burnet (1808-1874)7 and James Nack (1809-1879)8 did not have deaf forebears to validate their desire to write poetry. As pioneers in the genre of deaf poetry, they wrestled with the relevance of their deafness to their compositions of rhythm and rhyme. However, as the century wore on, gains were made in deaf education and more deaf people read, wrote, and published poetry. For example, British poet William Henry Simpson (n.d.) published his own book of poetry in 1858 to correct Kitto's "erroneous impression" that deaf people could not write poetry (p. xii).9 Later American poets including Amos Draper (1845-1917),10 Mary Toles Peet (1836-1901),11 Laura Redden Searing (1840-1923),12 Angie Fuller Fischer (1841-1925)," and John Carlin (1813-1891)14 were involved to varying degrees with the National Deaf-Mute College in Washington D.C. They would have been familiar not only with the work of earlier deaf poets like Burnet, Nack, and Kitto but also with their published and unpublished peers at the college. In fact, as E. M. Gallaudet, the leading American educa tor of deaf people noted: "Among the students of the College for Deaf-Mutes at Washington, compositions in verse are not uncommon" (p. 593). In an 1884 article for Harper's magazine on the "Poetry of the Deaf," Gallaudet asserts that despite cultural skepticism about deaf poetic ability, "the deaf, in no inconsiderable numbers, have essayed to mount on the wing of poetic expression" (p. 588). In this article, Gallaudet collected the work of many</page><page sequence="3">JENNIFER ESMAIL / 511 of these poets in order to refute Kitto and validate deaf poetic achievement. Gallaudet's transatlantic approach to the issue of deaf poetry informs my own. This essay will discuss British and North American deaf poets collectively in acknowledgement of the fact that there was marked continuity in British and North American deaf cultures and that deaf people often felt as though they shared more in common with deaf people in other countries than with hearing people in their own (including their educational interests, mode of language, and visual orientation to the world).15 While deaf poets were celebrated in British and North American Deaf communities, they understood that they faced a cultural definition of poetry that was rooted in orality. Searing, for example, described hearing audiences' preconceptions about deaf poets, most notably in her prose-poem "The Realm of Singing: An Autobiographical Allegory" (c. 1870). Searing suspected that readers maligned her poetry once they discovered she was deaf. The allegory of the work concerns a bird whose "crippled" wings prevent her from alighting upon the "tree of poetry" in the "Realm of Singing." Searing invokes the oral connotations of poetry in naming this world the "Realm of Singing." However, Searing also explicitly decouples the bird's physical disability from its ability to sing. That is, allegorically, the bird's crippled wings are as unrelated to poetry as is the deafness of the poet. Instead, the bird's crippled wings only prevent her from alighting on the "tree of poetry" and thereby gaining recognition: "I think I can sing a little," she said, and so she hopped painfully upon the very lowest twig and began: How shall a bird on a crippled wing Ever get up into the sky? Is it not better to cease to sing — To droop and to die? There are so many before me there, With songs so loud and long and sweet, They startle the passer unaware — I am at his feet! And though I sing with a quivering breast And a dewy eye and a swelling throat; My heart so close to the thorn is pressed, That I spoil each note. And if ever I sing a song, Sweet of the sweet and true of the true — All of it's drowned by the birds ere long, Up in the blue.</page><page sequence="4">512 / VICTORIAN POETRY O, for one hour of rapturous strength! O, to sing one song in the sky! High over all the birds at length — Then I could die!16 The poem repeatedly emphasizes that the "crippled" bird sings as skillfully as the other birds. The real challenge facing Searing's bird—and all nineteenth century deaf poets—is not physical disability but rather the prejudices of hearing people about the relation between physical disability and poetry. Those who pass by the "crippled" bird admire her singing until they spot her wings and reply: What have we here? A crippled bird that tries to sing? Such a thing was never heard of before. It is impossible for her to sing correctly under such circumstances and we were certainly mistaken in think ing that there was anything in such songs. Our ears have deceived us. (Searing, p. 208) By emphasizing that the listeners' "ears" have deceived them, Searing implicates hearing audiences in the mistaken belief that deaf people cannot write poetry. In overvaluing their own ability to hear, this hearing audience underestimates deaf people. Searing argues that her poetic ability becomes suspicious only after her deafness is discovered, which reveals that ideology, not evidence, informs skepticism about deaf poetry. Editors who published deaf poetry also consistently underscored its ap parent impossibility. When published for hearing audiences, rather than in deaf-specific publications, these poets were shackled to the identity of "deaf poet"—a commodity and curiosity—rather than a poet who was deaf. For instance, Nack's "Spring is Coming"—a poem that makes repeated reference to the sounds of spring including "birds . . . chirping" and "insects hum ming"—was published in 1845 by the New York Tribune.'7 The paper attributed the poem to "Mr. Nack who is deaf and dumb since his childhood." This foregrounding of Nack's deafness suggests the unfortunate possibility that his deafness was as important to the publication of his poetry as his poetic skill. Indeed, even journals devoted to deaf issues like the American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb highlighted the contrast between the deafness of the poet and the oral resonances of the genre. Carlin's poem, "The Mute's Lament," was published in the first number of the Annals in 1847 with a lengthy editor's preface about the "special surprise" excited by a poet born deaf. The editor declares that "we should almost as soon expect a man born blind to become a landscape painter, as one born deaf to produce poetry of even tolerable merit."18 After assuring readers that Carlin's poem had not been edited, he emphasizes that while "The Mute's Lament" is not rhymed, Carlin frequently</page><page sequence="5">JENNIFER ESMAIL/ 513 wrote in regular rhyme and meter. Carlin's ability to master the apparently sound-based elements of poetry like rhythm and rhyme was essential to es tablishing his poetic credibility. Like Carlin, Kitto's authority as a poet depended on his use of the formal poetic features traditionally tied to sound. However, Kitto's self-assessment of his "bad rhymes" and "halting, hopping, stumping feet" is entirely inaccurate; or, as Gallaudet declares in his Harper's article, "Kitto's poetry is better than his reasoning" (p. 595). Kitto skillfully manipulates rhyme and meter in his poetry. For example, his poem "Mary," which describes how both his visual acumen and the communicative capabilities of his wife's eyes compensate for his deafness, is roughly iambic. In a stanza describing how deafness complicates social interactions, Kitto mourns the loss of exposure to new ideas: True, that the human voice divine Falls not on this cold sense of mine; And that brisk commercing of thought Which brings home rich returns, all fraught With ripe ideas—points of view Varied, and beautiful, and new, Is lost, is dead, in this lone state Where feelings sicken, thoughts stagnate. (11. 66-73) The stanza deviates most strikingly from its regular rhythm in line seventy. This irregular line, punctuated with a dash, describes the "ripe ideas" and "points of view" that the "speaker"19 misses. His desire for variety is therefore mirrored in the metrical singularity of that line, which diverges markedly from the loose pattern of the rest of the stanza. While Kitto experimented with various forms of poetry, many deaf poets crafted works that adhered to standard patterns of rhyme and meter. Draper, for instance, wrote a Petrarchan sonnet titled "Memories of Sound": They are like one who shuts his eyes to dream Of some bright vista in his fading past; And suddenly the faces that were lost In long forgetfulness before him seem — Th' uplifted brow, the love-lit eyes whose beam Could ever o'er his soul a radiance cast, Numberless charms that long ago have askt The homage of his fresh young life's esteem; For sometimes, from the silence that they bear, Well up the tones that erst formed half their joys — A strain of music floats to the dull ear, Or low, melodious murmur of a voice,</page><page sequence="6">514 / VICTORIAN POETRY Till all the chords of harmony vibrant are With consciousness of deeply slumb'ring pow'rs.20 When Draper deviates from his patterns of rhythm and rhyme he play fully highlights the apparent obstacles to the deaf poet. The two lines that stray from iambic pentameter are lines twelve and thirteen, which have eleven syllables and an irregular meter. These two lines are the only lines that explicitly reference "melod[y]" or "harmony" and yet they blatantly resist the harmoni ous with their metrical irregularity. Draper thereby draws attention to the potential inharmoniousness of the deaf poet's lines. Furthermore, the poem contains one eye rhyme—"bear" and "ear"—that appears when the "speaker" explicitly mentions his "dull ear" (11. 9, 11). It is only fitting that the line that references this deaf ear rhymes "ear" with a word that only looks as though it rhymes. Finally, Draper mobilizes the rigidity of the octave-sestet structure of the sonnet, and the centrality of the sonnet's turn, to consider the shift between being deaf and being hearing. The octave treats vision exclusively and only turns to remembrances of sound in the sestet. Therefore this poem, which is explicitly about the "speaker's" memories of sound, is dominated by a description of the visual. Draper mobilizes the formal features of the sonnet to highlight the perceived barriers to deaf poetry. His inharmonious lines about harmony, his eye rhyme that results from his "dull ear," and his emphasis on visuality in a poem titled "Memories of Sound" challenge the centrality of the sense of hearing to poetic craft. Kitto and Draper, who I use to represent early and later nineteenth century deaf poetry respectively, are examples of the larger trend in most nineteenth-century deaf poetry toward fixed formal patterns of rhythm and rhyme. These poets very rarely deviated radically from traditional modes of poetic meter and rhyme. While the formal innovation taking place throughout the century—from new genres like the dramatic monologue to experiments with what we would now call "free verse"—was striking, what was most no table about these deaf poets is how they generally refrained from this kind of experimentation. Their understanding of the relationship between sound and poetry—as it was expressed formally—adhered to cultural constructions of poetry as a genre dependent upon the aurality of spoken words. However, this obedience to fixed measures of rhythm and rhyme raises questions about how deaf poets accessed poetic features generally associated with the sounds of spoken words. There are no straightforward answers to these questions. Various factors complicate any attempt we might make to explain deaf poets' accuracy in versification: their degree of deafness, age of onset of deafness, amount of oral training, personal ability, reliance on friends and family's hear ing ability, use of written dictionaries, and class and literacy experiences may each influence a deaf poet's ability to master the resonances of English words.</page><page sequence="7">JENNIFER ESMAIL/515 Victorian audiences also seem to have wondered how deaf people could access these elements of poetry because deaf poets often prefaced their poetry with justifications of their poetic ability. For example, Burnet, one of the first published deaf poets, who became deaf at the age of eight, explains that he began to "make rhymes at an early age . . . when the recollections of sounds were fresh in his memory, and his reminiscences of the harmony of measured syllables and rhymes were vivid and distinct."21 As he explains in his Tales of the Deaf and Dumb with Miscellaneous Poems (1835), "while nearly all other recol lections of sounds have faded from his memory, he is still capable of forming a tolerable judgment of the effect on the ear of a line of poetry" (p. 230). Most of the nineteenth-century deaf poets claim this ability to versify without entirely explaining its source. For example, in the preface to his Daydreams of the Deaf (1858), William Henry Simpson explains that he has "an intuitive perception of improprieties of rhythm and rhyme." According to Simpson, it does not follow that one deaf person should not have a keener perception of the properties and harmony of verse, both as respects rhyme and quantity, than another whose tastes and talents do not lie that way; just as one person who can hear will more readily detect a false note in music than another, because his soul is satisfied with nothing less than perfection.22 Simpson rejects generalizations about the poetic abilities of deaf people in favor of attention to the particular inclinations and abilities of each individual, whether hearing or deaf. Simpson entirely severs versifying ability from hear ing ability and instead aligns it with personal striving for aesthetic excellence. Many deaf poets also turned to written texts for instruction regarding the supposedly aural dimensions of poetry. Instead of relying on hearing, deaf poets like Carlin, for example, used writing to access rhyme and rhythm. Carlin explains that he improved his initial "discordant verses" and "inability to catch and con long and short syllables intonated in strictly poetic feet" through studying "the best English poets."23 Beyond modeling his work on literary precedent, Carlin also turned to written reference works. Carlin studied "Walker's Pronouncing Dictionary, and also his Rhyming Dictionary, a book which contains all the fundamental principles of poetry" (Gallaudet, p. 589). Carlin, who explained that he had "no idea of vocal sounds," relied upon written texts to gain admission to the world of English versification. His rhyme and rhythm were therefore moored in textual practices rather than sound experiences. There is another, perhaps more trenchant, response to these questions about deaf poetic ability: we should investigate the critical investments that are revealed by wonderment at a deaf poet's skill with rhythm and rhyme. Skepticism about deaf poetry is buttressed by an assumption that poetic ability</page><page sequence="8">516 / VICTORIAN POETRY does, in fact, reside in the ear. However, as these deaf poets testify, the ear is only the imagined, but not the necessary, home of poetic ability.24 Deaf poetry provides us, as critics of nineteenth-century poetry, with an opportunity to interrogate the notion that written poetry is best created through orality and experienced through aurality. These poets permit us to move beyond the idea that poetry produced through deafness is absurd. I invoke the term "absurd" because the nineteenth-century deaf poetic community used the term on more than one occasion to describe deaf poetry. In "The Realm of Singing," Searing calls the "crippled" bird's songs (which allegorically represent deaf poetry) "absurd singing" (p. 208). Gallaudet also invokes the term "absurdity" in his 1884 Harper's article about the "Poetry of the Deaf." Gallaudet cites Edgar Allen Poe's essay "The Poetic Principle" (1850), which emphasizes the importance of music to poetry. Gallaudet then responds: "If this dictum of so great a master of the music of verse is accepted, the declaration that poetry may be appreciated, and even produced, by those bereft of the sense through which alone music can be enjoyed, presents an apparent absurdity" (p. 588). Gallaudet and Searing's use of the term "absurd" when referring to poetry by deaf people disentangles and then re-entangles the issues that arise in the intersections between deafness, sound, and poetry. "Absurd" is derived from the Latin "absurdus," which the Oxford English Dictionary defines as "inharmonious, tasteless, foolish."2,5 Absurdus unites ab meaning from, and surdus, which means "deaf, inaudible or insufferable to the ear." Therefore, absurd poetry is literally poetry from the deaf. While Searing and Gallaudet's use of the term "absurd" may not have been intentional invocations of the slippage between inaudibility and denigration that the term embodies, I reclaim the term "absurd poetry" here to refer to deaf poetry. Absurd poetry does not "hear" and does not "speak," that is, it was not derived from orality nor should it necessarily be forced into aurality. "Absurd poetry" is especially suggestive because the gap that exists between "inharmonious" and the pejo rative term "tasteless," in the definition of absurdus, or between "inaudible" and "insufferable to the ear," in the definition of surdus, is the location of the question of deaf poetry. These deaf poets demonstrate that it is possible to write poetry that is inaudible and yet not insufferable to the ear. The audibility of Victorian poetry has become an important issue in Victorian poetry criticism as demonstrated by the ongoing discussion between critics including Herbert Tucker, Isobel Armstrong, Eric Griffiths, Yopie Prins, Matthew Campbell, Dennis Taylor, John Picker, Ivan Kreilkamp, Kirstie Blair, and Jason Rudy.26 Kreilkamp notes, for example, that the relationship between speech and writing was "a topic of recurring and urgent concern throughout the Victorian period (p. 2). This issue is especially relevant to the many varieties of Victorian poetry that experimented with a range of "voices"—the dramatic monologue, for example—and with the textualizing of orality. As part of the</page><page sequence="9">JENNIFER ESMAIL/517 critical discussion about orality and aurality, Prins has located a contemporary critical overemphasis on audible voices in Victorian poetry. She has asked, "How can we reverse our tendency to read these poems as the utterance of a speaker, the representation of speech, the performance of song?" (p. 44). One of the central monographs addressing orality in Victorian poetry, Griffiths' The Printed Voice of Victorian Poetry, provides a particularly glaring example of the tendency Prins identifies. Griffiths does attempt to add com plexity to his readings of the "voice" that inheres on the printed page, but his analysis is buttressed by a problematic formulation of the relation between speech and writing. In Griffiths' dichotomy, speech surpasses writing in its communicative capacity because of aural features including pitch, pace, stress, and volume. For Griffiths, these sound features add an extra communicative dimension to vocal communication that writing lacks; indeed, Griffiths insists on the "problems of translating the intended music of a voice into the scant notation of the written word" and the "loose fit of writing on speech" (pp. 61-62, 66). Beyond the potential problems with this discourse that seems to assume speech's priority over other modes of language, Griffiths supports his argument about the superiority of speech by pointing to errors in speech made, strangely enough, by deaf children. Griffiths cites a study, published in 1942, that analyzed the intelligibility of the speech of deaf children who had been trained to speak under the controversial Oralist system of educa tion. Oralism was a movement that burgeoned in the second half of the nineteenth century, in both Britain and North America, and endorsed the wholesale eradication of sign language use among deaf people in favor of speech and lip-reading. Despite the almost unanimous opposition of deaf people, Oralism reigned in deaf education for almost a century. This 1942 study, then, attended to deaf children who were being forced to speak, and found that their significant errors in sound features—including pitch, pace, stress, and volume—rendered them unintelligible. This link between sound features and intelligibility is central to Griffiths's overall argument because it "demonstrates a link between what might be thought of as the 'form' and the 'content' of an utterance" (pp. 19-20). The Victorian legacy of Oralism, then, informs Griffiths theories about Victorian poetry: he uses the flaws in sound features made by speaking deaf children in order to argue that speech, which, unlike writing or signing, contains these sound features, has a superior communicative capacity to writing.27 The Printed Voice of Victorian Poetry, one of the major monographs on the role of sound in Victorian poetry, demonstrates that the cultural elevation of orality, often at the expense of deaf people, still informs contemporary criti cal practices. I use Griffiths as an example to demonstrate what a Disability Studies approach offers to the study of poetry. First, it provides a lens through which scholars can more critically assess claims made about the necessity of</page><page sequence="10">518 / VICTORIAN POETRY certain kinds of sensory, affective, or linguistic experience to the genre of poetry. Second, while I would not argue that aural considerations should be entirely divorced from poetic theory, I want to call attention to the limita tions of this sound-based theory of poetry alongside other critics like Prins, who has suggested that a study of historical prosody reveals how Victorian metrical theory "makes voice a function of writing" and provides a way out of the orality conundrum.28 Kreilkamp has also interrogated the critical desire to trace audible voices in Victorian literature, positing that "voice persists in the discourse of print culture where it remains as trace and residue capable of giving rise to inchoate new forms" (p. 2). The third insight that a Deaf studies approach offers to Victorian poetry scholarship, then, is that deaf po etry is an important example of a new form to emerge from this discourse of print; in this absurd poetry we can most clearly trace how, in Tucker's words, "texts do not come from speakers, speakers come from texts" (p. 243). The fantasy of poetic orality cannot comfortably address deaf poetry. After all, as Lennard Davis has argued, "the deaf experience the text at the degree zero of writing, as a text first and foremost . . . the text [is] not . . . transformed into an auditory translation but. . . seen as language itself."29 These absurd poems were not forged in speech and molded into writing. Instead, writing was the primary site of poetic production, dissemination, and reception for deaf poets. Because the relationship between this absurd poetry and its cre ators—deaf people who used signed languages rather than voices—is uniquely configured, an examination of this poetry can help us redefine the questions we pose about voice in Victorian poetry through defamiliarizing our ideas of ability, both poetic and sensory. Silent Soliloquizing: The Contradictions of Aurality and Orality in Written Poetry While, as I have shown, deaf poets adhered to the formalism under stood as sound-based by creating poetry containing rigid schemes of rhythm and rhyme, they were more radical in their treatment of sound thematically. Turning to the thematic content of this body of poetry demonstrates how deaf poets attempted to walk the fine cultural line between the "inaudibility" and "insufferability" denoted by the term "absurd" poetry. Nineteenth-century deaf poets mobilized the thematic presence of sound in their work in various ways that allowed them to underscore the paradox of written poetry: they simulta neously emphasized both the silence and the imagined orality of their poetry. The most striking example of how deaf poets foregrounded the contradictory relationship between deafness and the sound theory of poetry was their use of the figure of the "speaking mute." With extraordinary frequency, these poets highlighted the muteness of the speaker in their poems while simultaneously figuring the poem itself as speech. For example, in Angie Fuller [Fischer's]</page><page sequence="11">JENNIFER ESMAIL/ 519 "The Semi-Mute's Soliloquy" (1879) and Carlin's "The Mute's Lament" (1847), Fischer and Carlin self-consciously construct their poetry as speech while their "speakers" simultaneously bemoan their alienation from the speaking world around them. The speaking mute figure thereby mirrors both the ambivalent position of deaf poets and the tension in their poetry between challenging and accepting the dominance of "voice" in written poetry. The "speakers" of speaking mute poems describe their alienation as a state of being at once inside and outside their hearing-dominated society. Fischer's "speaker" in "The Semi-Mute's Soliloquy"30 foregrounds her ambigu ous role as a soliloquizing mute: No sound! no sound! an alien though at home, An exile even in my native land; A prisoner too, for though at will I roam, Yet chained and manacled I oft must stand Unmoved, though sounds vibrate on every hand. No sound! no sound! yet often I have heard, Echoing through dear memory's sacred hall, The buzz of bees, the rare song of a bird, The melody of rain-drops as they fall, The wind's wild notes, or Sabbath bells' sweet call. No outward sound! yet often I perceive Kind angel voices speaking to my soul Sweetly consoling charges to believe That this life is a part, and not the whole Of being—its beginning, not its goal. No sound! except the echoes of the past, Seeming at times, in tones now loud, now low, The voices of a congregation vast Praising the God from whom all blessings flow,31 Until my heart with rapture is aglow. Fischer's tightly rhymed poem foregrounds the contrast between the myriad voices in the world of the poem—the songs of birds and the voices of angels— and the silence of her "speaker." It simultaneously accepts and disavows aurality by using rhyme while insisting that there is "no sound!" The "speaker" of Carlin's "The Mute's Lament"also foregrounds his alienation from the speaking world: I move—a silent exile on this earth; As in his dreary cell one doomed for life, My tongue is mute, and closed ear heedeth not;</page><page sequence="12">520/VICTORIAN POETRY No gleam of hope this darken'd mind assures That the blest power of speech shall e'er be known. Murmuring gaily o'er their pebbly beds The limpid streamlets as they onward flow Through verdant meadows and responding woodlands, Vocal with merry tones—I hear them not. (11. 1-9) The "speaker" contrasts his cell-like muteness, where he is at once a part of, and excluded from, the sound-filled world around him, with all the voices he cannot hear including streamlets "vocal with merry tones" (11. 7-9), the melodies of birds (11. 10-14), the "deep pause of maiden's pensive song" (1. 17), the "orator's exciting strains" (1. 21), and the "balmy words of God's own messenger" (1. 27). While a poetic mourning of muteness seems to suit the deaf poet, the failure of speech is, of course, a recurring theme in the works of more canoni cal Victorian poets, which often struggle with how to use poetry to address the change, alienation, and struggles with subjectivity that sometimes take the speaker's words away. In "Break, Break, Break," Tennyson's "speaker" empha sizes his inability to speak by contrasting his grief-filled silence with the sounds of the world around him.'2 In what Campbell calls a "longing, lyric cadence" (p. 127), the speaker compares his muteness to the singing sailor lad and the shouting fisherman's boy, declaring: "I would that my tongue could utter / The thoughts that arise in me" (11. 3-4). In mourning "the sound of a voice that is still" (1. 12), Tennyson's "speaker" loses his own voice. Here, of course, Tennyson is mobilizing a similar paradox as the deaf poets by despairing, in words, of his lack of words." The form of the dramatic monologue also fruit fully mobilizes the contradiction of the idea of poetry as speech. For instance, in "The Bishop Orders His Tomb at St. Praxed's Church," Browning took advantage of paraverbal written markers to indicate a failure of vocality and to create what Armstrong has called "the splutter of speech" in Browning's dramatic monologues (p. 11). From his deathbed, the Bishop calls out to his "Nephews—sons mine ... ah God, I know not! Well—" (1. 3).34 This poem is littered with ellipses and dashes that signal the Bishop's struggles to articulate his last wishes for guaranteeing his remembrance by posterity. The "speakers" of these poems, whether deaf or hearing, connect voicelessness with mourn ing, personal disconnection, and alienation from the world around them.35 Deaf poets capitalize on this theme of poetic muteness, however, to explicitly point to the limits of understanding written poetry as a genre of speech. While the "speakers" in speaking mute poems bemoan their inability to speak audibly, they paradoxically claim a written "voice" for themselves through their poems. The titles of Carlin's "The Mute's Lament" and Fischer's "The Semi-mute's Soliloquy" self-consciously appropriate orality. The titular</page><page sequence="13">JENNIFER ESMAIL / 521 declaration of soliloquizing or lamenting claims a "voice" for those who would not otherwise use one. By definition, a mute person cannot speak, except by becoming the "speaker" of a genre of writing that calls itself speech. The "speaker" of a written poem is able to access a voice because of a definition of poetry that invests it with orality. In fact, almost every nineteenth-century deaf poet explicitly invokes the "voice" of the poet. Anonymous contributors to the poetry columns in nineteenth-century deaf periodicals often styled themselves along the lines of "Singing-Mute"with this contradiction of poetic orality in mind.'6 Laura Searing's poem about John Keats has the refrain, "O rare, sweet singer!" and Burnet's mute "speaker" in "Passaic Falls" describes himself as "singing" "lays" as part of the tradition of the "bard."37 In fact, in "Passaic Falls," Burnet makes the paradox of deaf poetry explicit: "ears to the deaf thou art, speech to the dumb" (1. 49). However, while these poets invest their written poetry with "orality," they just as clearly highlight the absurdity of this orality's origin in a mute "speaker." The orality of their poetry is always juxtaposed with the muteness that not only inheres in their "speakers" but also in their personal experiences. Through exploiting this paradox of the speaking mute, Carlin, Fischer, and other deaf poets foreground the problematic construction of written poetry as a genre of orality. In describing central Victorian poets, including Tennyson, Browning, and Christina Rossetti, Armstrong argues, "poets resort to songs and speech, as if to foreground the act of reading a secondary text, for the song is not sung but read, and the speech is not spoken but written" (p. 12). If this is true for these hearing poets then it is even more suggestive for deaf poets invested in interrogating the hegemony of the audible voice in poetry. By emphasizing the silence of their lamenting, soliloquizing, and speaking, these deaf poets implicitly argue that written poetry can thrive outside of hearing and speaking. Poetry, as it was produced, disseminated, and consumed in the nineteenth century, was generally written. And for deaf people, the oral and the aural were both audibly absent from, and legibly present in, this written text. Deaf poets deployed the tension of the speaking-mute figure in order to create a space for their absurd poetry in a genre that seemed to preclude deaf poetic achievement. Another theme that appears frequently in nineteenth century deaf poetry also uses the space between sound and text as a locus for deaf poetry. These poets collectively constructed a group of poems that I call "sounds-unheard" poetry. This term deliberately echoes Keats's celebration of "unheard melodies." As Clark notes, "since the middle of the nineteenth century, almost every other book in English produced by a deaf poet... quotes John Keats: 'Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard / Are sweeter"' (p. 3). The five poems I have already addressed by Kitto, Draper, Fischer, Carlin, and Burnet each belong in this category. The "speaker" of Kitto's "Mary," for instance, describes various sounds that he is unable to hear including "the</page><page sequence="14">522 / VICTORIAN POETRY organ's rolling peal" (1. 31), "leaves rustl[ing] in the breeze" (1. 45), and "the human voice divine" (1. 67). Similarly, the "speaker" of Carlin's "The Mute's Lament" mourns all of the sounds that he has never heard: The linnet's dulcet tone; the robin's strain; The whipporwil's; the lightsome mock-bird's cry, When merrily from branch to branch they skip, Flap their blithe wings, and o'er the tranquil air Diffuse their melodies—I hear them not. The touches-lyric of the lute divine, Obedience to the rise, the cadence soft, And the deep pause of maiden's pensive song, While swells her heart with love's elated life, Draw forth its mellow tones— I hear them not. Deep silence over all, and all seems lifeless; The orator's exciting strains the crowd Enraptur'd hear, while meteor-like his wit Illuminates the dark abyss of mind Alone, left in the dark—/ hear them not. (11. 10-24) Each stanza's description of myriad sounds unheard is followed by the refrain, "I hear them not." The central energy of the poem arises from detailed imagin ings of sounds that Carlin's "speaker" has never encountered. Each of the nine nineteenth-century deaf poets I am considering has written a sounds-unheard poem in which the "speaker" describes all the sounds that he or she can no longer hear or has never heard. These poems include Burnet's "Lines Written After A First Visit to the Passaic Falls, at the age of nineteen, (since corrected)" (1835), Carlin's "The Mute's Lament" (1847), Draper's "Memories of Sound" (1884), Fischer's "The Semi-Mute's Soliloquy" (1879), Kitto's "Mary" (1845), Mary Toles Peet's "Thoughts on Music" (1855), Nack's "Spring is Coming" (1845), Searing's "Ten Years of Silence" (1891) and Simpson's "Recollections of Hearing" (1858).38 The nine examples of sounds-unheard poems under consideration are extraordinarily similar in how they catalogue these sounds. Formally, they present long, descriptive lists of a variety of sounds. Eight of the nine poems refer to birdsong, seven of nine to music, six of nine to wind, six of nine to the human voice, and five of nine to musical instruments. Each of these poems, by nine different poets—divided by decade, age, gender, nationality, exposure to signed languages, and onset age of deafness—are remarkably similar in which sounds they represent. Fur thermore, the language used to describe each sound recurs again and again. Each of the four poets who mention a large body of water, such as the ocean or the sea, characterizes it as "roaring." Each of the three poets who write of an organ describes its "pealing." Three of the four poets who refer to a</page><page sequence="15">JENNIFER ESMAIL/ 523 smaller body of water, either a "stream" or a "rill," refer to its "murmuring." The adjectives used to describe sound also mirror conventional descriptions of sound as they appear in texts by hearing people. The rain "patters" while the wind "whispers," "sighs," or "howls." Bees are described as "buzzing" or "humming" but never as "crying," "singing," "cooing," "trilling," or "warbling" like the birds. The fact that Carlin, who would have never heard a stream, knew to describe it as "murmuring" (11. 1-2) rather than "roaring" reveals that sound description is available to him outside of his sensory experience. This unique genre of sounds-unheard poetry reveals one important way that attending to deaf poetry—and its foregrounding of the illusory nature of sound in written poetry—can illuminate our readings of all poetry. That is, the ability of deaf poets to describe sounds they have never heard is a paradox that illuminates the conventionality of poetic language. Carlin, like most British and North American deaf people, grasped English sound vocabulary through the writing and signing of others. Despite never having heard birdsong, Carlin could describe "the linnet's dulcet tone" (1. 4) because of his familiarity with the linguistic meanings of "linnet," "dulcet," and "tone." Furthermore, Carlin mined a particular poetic tradition of sound description by drawing on his wide experience of reading English poetry (Gallaudet, p. 590). Descriptions of sound, for a poet like Carlin, are accessible through reading, writing, and signing because language mediates both the experience of hearing and the practice of representing sound in words. Deaf poets who do not have access to a sensory experience of sound demonstrate in these poems that they have access to a textual experience of sound. While it seems obvious that experiences and descriptions of sound are bound by the conventions of language, there is nevertheless a long history of considering hearing more immediate and unmediated than other senses, especially sight. Referencing the theological undertones of this long history that idealizes a "transhistorical" conception of the "inferiority" of hearing, sound historian Jonathan Sterne has described a Western "audio-visual litany" of the supposed differences between hearing and seeing.'9 This problematic ideology includes beliefs such as "sounds come to us, but vision travels to its object," "hearing is about affect, vision is about intellect," and "hearing involves physical contact with the outside world [while] vision requires dis tance from it."40 Sterne's analysis highlights how aural and oral experiences have often been understood as more powerful, natural, original, present, and interior than visual experience. Deaf people have been particularly oppressed by this cultural idealization of hearing and speech. Versions of the "audio visual litany" appear again and again in nineteenth-century medical attempts to cure deafness, theories of deaf education, and literary representations of deafness. From the "eh-what?" humor about deaf characters in Victorian fiction to the nineteenth-century campaign against sign language, speech</page><page sequence="16">524 / VICTORIAN POETRY and hearing were often constructed as integral to cultural participation and even to human identity.41 The most striking example of this phonocentrism in action was the largely successful Oralist movement in Europe and North America. As I noted, this nineteenth-century movement, comprised mainly of hearing people, usually educators, doctors, and parents of deaf children, aimed to eradicate the use of signed languages among deaf people in favor of lip-reading and speech. Oralists argued that signed languages were inferior to spoken languages because they incorrectly believed that signed languages were more concrete, iconic, and primitive than spoken languages.42 As I have argued elsewhere, each of these nineteenth-century poets faced these Oralist incursions into their lives and responded in various ways including defending the use of signed languages in their poetry.43 Because these deaf poets operated in a culture that celebrated speech and denied them their language of signs, nineteenth-century deaf poetry is a perfect forum for questioning the hegemony of hearing and speech. Sterne's criticism of the construction of "hearing (and, by extension, speech) as mani festing a kind of pure inferiority" (p. 15) is useful in interrogating a particular model of poetry that imagines the poem as an unmediated transcription of a poet's experience of the world. Sounds-unheard poetry highlights the fact that describing sound in poetry does not require the ability to hear. Poets—hearing and deaf—write about sound according to the conventions of poetic language rather than according to their experiences with hearing. The paradox of these sounds-unheard poems foregrounds how sensory information is constrained by discourse and processed through language. Indeed, the poets' achievement of the seemingly impossible—that is, describing sounds they have never expe rienced aurally—challenges the importance of the sense of hearing to poetry. While deaf poets do not have access to the sounds of words, they do have access to the words of sound. Furthermore, the frequent references to birdsong, music, and wind in these sounds-unheard poems foreground the importance of poetic tropes: these are all conventional figures of lyric address. Deaf poets are not necessarily referencing the audible sensory experience of birdsong or wind but instead the metaphorical valence of these objects.44 The most famous nineteenth-century incarnation of birdsong is, of course, John Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale," which, interestingly, is often prefaced by the assertion that it was directly inspired by Keats's delight in an actual bird's song.45 This biographical fact, with its insistence on the inspirational powers of sound for aesthetic produc tion, seems to be essential to the framing of the poem. Later in the nineteenth century, various Victorian poets, separated by decade, gender, and style, also use these conventional markers of lyric address. To take a few examples, Tennyson replicates this construction of the poet as the fitting interlocutor of birdsong in "The Poet's Mind" where, compared to others' "dull" ears (1.</page><page sequence="17">JENNIFER ESMAIL/ 525 35), poets have special access to the sounds of nature including "merry bird chants" (1. 22).46 Christina Rossetti invokes Keats's nightingale in "Song." Matthew Arnold also writes of nightingales in "To Marguerite—Continued" and of wind in "Dover Beach." In "Music: An Ode," Swinburne compares music to "birds whose note / bade man's soul quicken and leap to light" (11. 26-27).47 Again and again, lyres and harps, birds and breezes appear in the sonic space of nineteenth-century poetry. By invoking these same markers of lyric poetry without actually being able to hear them, deaf poets illuminate the fact that nineteenth-century poetry—in this case, a particular Romanti cally influenced lyric poetry—relies upon previous incarnations of poetry and figurative language even as it constructs itself as a product of the immediate impress of the senses. Indeed, by revealing that deafness does not preclude sound description, these poets suggest an alternative, discursively based un derstanding of the role of sound in poetry. Deaf poets extend this understanding of the textuality and conven tionality of sound to the "voice" of a poem. That is, deaf poetry relegates the orality that appears so frequently in the sounds-unheard genre to a product, rather than the source, of writing. These deaf poets thereby affirm Prins, Tucker, and Kreilkamp's understandings of how writing can produce a sense of vocality. For example, Kitto subsumes the various sounds of nature and music in his poem "Mary," including the ubiquitous nightingale, into the fraught concept of voice: And so beneath o'ershadowing trees, I've heard leaves rustle in the breeze, Which brought me the melodious tale Of all the vocal nightingale. Or else the cushat's coo of pride Over his new mated bride;— Yes: I have heard thee—Nature, thee, In all thy thousand voices speak, Which now are silent all to me. (11. 45-53). Not only does Kitto attribute a "voice" to the nightingale, but he also catego rizes the entire sonic register of the poem as Nature's "thousand voices." Kitto, who became deaf at the age of twelve, uses writing to describe sounds he can no longer hear and then to name these sounds as "voice." In "Thoughts on Music," American poet Mary Toles Peet also surveys the sounds around her in service of a higher "voice" that encapsulates all sounds: And then they tell of the sounds which come Afar from the sea's deep caves, Of the voice of the wind which sighs among</page><page sequence="18">526 / VICTORIAN POETRY Old oceans' towering waves; And the wild, deep music, which comes up From the breaker's dashing roar And the storm cloud's voice, when, as in wrath, His torrents madly pour. (11. 9-16; pp. 239-240) Peet's stanzas list various sounds she cannot hear such as the "lark's glad trill" (1. 19) and "the evening zephyr's notes" (1. 30), in a progression toward the idea that within all these sounds, which she calls "Nature's thousand tones" (1. 39), there echoes one "voice," presumably the voice of God (1. 38). This cacophony of orality appears frequently in sounds-unheard poetry, from references to human voices in most of the poems to describing the "storm cloud's voice" (Peet, "Thoughts," 1. 15) and the "woodlands, vocal with merry tones" (Carlin, "The Mute's Lament," 11. 8-9). In Simpson's "Recollections of Hearing" (Daydreams), the "speaker" asserts, "nature now remains to me / comparatively dumb" (11. 51-52). In the genre of sounds-unheard poetry, non vocal sounds are transformed, through the writing of the poem, into orality. Voices, animate and inanimate, dominate the imagined sound landscape of these poems thereby highlighting both the poet's thematic alienation from an omnipresent orality and his or her interest in the formal intersection between orality and written poetry. The common construction of written poetry as a secondary product of an original bardic orality, then, cannot incorporate absurd poetry, which is created by poets who sign rather than speak. Because these poems—in their thematic treatments of speaking mutes and sounds unheard—render a textual rather than audible voice into print, nineteenth century deaf poetry simultaneously conforms to, and displaces, the authority of orality in written poetry. These poets were constrained by both the cultural ideology that disparaged those who did not speak and the literary ideology that tied poetry to orality. While absurd poetry strained against this generic restric tion by replacing the voice with writing and emphasizing poetry's accessibility to deaf people, it nevertheless remained hedged in by the cultural power of orality in its adherence to rigid schemes of rhythm and rhyme. However, this very tension at the core of deaf poetry subversively reveals that the "voice" of a poem is usually metaphorical, and this metaphor is as equally available to a deaf poet as to a hearing poet. While nineteenth-century deaf poets could not entirely escape poetry's generic tie to orality, they created a position for themselves in the landscape of nineteenth-century poetry by calling their writing "speech." Indeed, at the center of every absurd poem there is a celebration of writing and an assertion of a deaf person's right to poetry. For example, in "The Castle of Silence,"48 Peet's "speaker" humbly approaches the "shrine" of the "radiant muse of song":</page><page sequence="19">JENNIFER ESMAIL/527 Low bending at thy shrine I come, O radiant muse of song! And though no sound my voice may wake, No low deep tone the echoes break That tremble round thy throne. Perchance my hand may touch the lyre, And bid some chord to thrill, And though the minstrel's home-land be The realm of silence, still may she Bring soul-gifts, at thy will. (11. 1-10, italics in original). Peet maintains the alignment of song and poetry—Kitto's notion of a "tuneful art"—by understanding poetry's muse as the muse of song and invoking the chords of the metaphorical lyre of lyric poetry. She does, however, mobilize that metaphor to validate deaf poetry. Peet's "speaker" replaces the poetic voice with her hand strumming the lyre. Her hand, with its access to both writing and signing, thereby becomes the instrument of poetic creation. Though she dwells in the "realm of silence," Peet asserts her right to lyric poetry through writing and signing. Peet's privileging of her hand as that which connects her to the lyric tradition is even more suggestive in the context of the performance history of this poem. Peet presented "The Castle of Silence" in sign language for an audience of hearing and deaf people at the 1859 closing exercises of the New York Institution of the Deaf and Dumb, from which she had graduated six years earlier. A reporter for the New York Times in attendance applauded Peet's "muse" and declared that her "words were fitted together... euphoniously."49 While the poem may have been recited orally or provided in print alongside Peet's signing for non-signing members of the audience, Peet produced and disseminated her poem in sign. This moment where Peet silently signs her "euphonious" poem—a strictly rhymed apologia for silent deaf poetry—embod ies the central tension of nineteenth-century deaf poetry. Each of these poets vacillates between adherence to, and subversion of, the authority of the voice in nineteenth-century English poetry. On one hand, these poets typically conformed to conventional schemes of rhythm and rhyme in order to prove their literary capabilities. However, these poets also challenged the alignment of poetry and sound through emphasizing the apparent contradictions of deaf poetry. This simultaneous formal capitulation and thematic resistance to the aural dimensions of poetry in the previously unexplored canon of deaf poetry offers a new perspective on the relation between sound and poetry. Nineteenth-century deaf poetry insistently places writing, and even signing, rather than speech, at the center of poetic production and reception. Nineteenth-century deaf poetry provides a unique and productive lens</page><page sequence="20">528 / VICTORIAN POETRY through which to consider issues of voice, sound, and textuality in Victorian poetry because its creators were oppressed by a cultural reverence for the voice. Absurd poetry also illuminates the limitations of defining poetry primarily through features of orality and aurality. For deaf poets, poetry is not a "tuneful art."50 Through their use of the sounds-unheard theme and of the speaking mute figure, these deaf poets exploited the sound-based theory of poetry to highlight the very written-ness—the very absence of speech—that characterized all nineteenth-century poetry. In its re-imagining of the relationship between sound and text, in its insistence on written texts without corresponding sensory experiences of sound, and in its celebration of the possibilities of writing, deaf poetry provides one more avenue for complicating our critical understanding of the locations where writing and speaking meet and where bodies and texts intersect.

Notes 1 It has been standard practice in Deaf Studies to use "deaf' with a lowercase d when referring to the audiological condition of deafness and "Deaf with an uppercase D when referring to Deaf culture and to those deaf people who identify with a Deaf community and use a signed language. However, some Deaf Studies critics argue that this distinction oversimplifies the range of identity positions available to deaf/Deaf people. Furthermore, there may be historical problems with assigning nineteenth century deaf people one of these designations. While all the deaf poets in this article used signed languages to some degree, some of them, including, for example, John Kitto may not have self-identified with the Deaf community. Because the d/D practice cannot address the complexities of nineteenth-century deaf identities, I use the term "deaf' in this article. 2 John Kitto, The Lost Senses (Edinburgh, 11845]), 1.168. 3 Laura Redden Searing publicly signed her own poem "A Farewell" at her 1858 gradu ation from the Missouri School for the Deaf (Judy Yaeger Jones and Jane E. Vallier, eds., Sweet Bells Jangled: Laura Redden Searing, a Deaf Poet Restored [Washington D.C.: Gallaudet Univ. Press, 2003], p. 29). There are many reports of deaf people signing their own or other people's poetry at the public exhibitions of deaf schools or at graduation exercises. Another example appears in the New York Times of June 27, 1872. At the closing exercises of the New York institution, a deaf student signed Oliver Wendell Holmes's "The Voiceless." The reporter describes the sentimental performance in detail and then writes that the young signer exited the stage to "plaudits [that] were almost deafening in vehemence" ("Our Deaf Mutes," New York Times, June 27, 1872).</page><page sequence="21">JENNIFER ESMAIL/529 4 "The Little Papers," or the "Little Paper Family," refers to the newspapers published by American residential deaf schools. These papers, as John Vickrey Van Cleve and Barry Crouch note, were "ubiquitous" by the end of the nineteenth century (John Vickrey Van Cleve and Barry A. Crouch, A Place of their Own: Creating the Deaf Community in America [Washington, DC: Gallaudet Univ. Press, 1989], p. 98). There were also vari ous journals including The British Deaf-Mute and the American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb that served deaf communities and deaf educators. Most American deaf schools trained their students in printing (in part because it was a writing-focused practice that took place in very noisy printshops), which led to the nineteenth-century proliferation of deaf-authored and printed periodicals. 5 While my attempt to address the breadth of this canon prevents me from detailing each poet's particular biographical context, I want to underscore that there are, of course, important differences in their identities, their attitudes towards their own deafness, and their use of signed languages. For instance, Laura Redden Searing's gender and deafness were significant to the publication and reception of her work. She published under the pseudonym Howard Glyndon in both her journalism and poetry though a rival newspaper eventually revealed that Searing was actually a deaf woman. For more of Searing's biography and the relevance of gender to her work, see Jones and Vallier. 6 John Kitto was deafened by a fall from a ladder at the age of twelve. Born to a work ing class family in Plymouth, Kitto struggled financially and then educated himself, eventually becoming a noted biblical scholar. He traveled to the Middle East on mis sionary trips and wrote about his experiences in his travel writing. He also supported his family entirely through his writing, publishing many essays and books including, notably, his autobiography The Lost Senses (1845). 7 John Robertson Burnet, born in New Jersey, became deaf at 8 years of age. He did not become fluent in sign language, however, until he was twenty-one. He worked at newspapers, deaf schools, and his own farm. His book Tales of the Deaf and Dumb, with Miscellaneous Poems (1835) contained fiction, poetry, and non-fictional accounts of deafness. The book sold well enough for him to "clear his grandfather's debts and assume control of the [family] farm" (John Lee Clark, Deaf American Poetry: An Anthol ogy [Washington, DC: Gallaudet Univ. Press, 2009], pp. 9-10). 8 James Nack also became deaf at the age of 8. He was "the first deaf American to pub lish a book," The Legend of the Rock and Other Poems, which, Christopher Krentz notes, "created a stir in literary New York." For more on nineteenth-century American deaf poets, see Christopher Krentz, Writing Deafness: The Hearing Line in Nineteenth-Century American Literature (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 2007). I make an argument similar to Krentz's about James Nack's poetry. Krentz comments: "Written largely in the Romantic style of Lord Byron, the sixty-eight poems in The Legend of the Rock may strike today's readers as dated and conventional, but that conformity helped to give them their power when they first appeared. . . . The New York Critic praised the musical quality of Nack's verse while another commentator wondered how Nack, as a deaf person 'cut off from society, could write so well about human emotions (Lang, Deaf Persons, p. 270)" (Krentz, p. 50). Altogether Nack published four volumes of literary work (Clark, p. 25). 9 William Henry Simpson lost his hearing as a boy and then attended the Old Kent Road School for the Deaf and Dumb in London, where he later became a teacher. Gallaudet notes that Simpson's poem "Lines on Reading the Narrative of Frederick Douglass, an Escaped American Slave" "was widely quoted in the newspapers at the time of its publication" (E. M. Gallaudet, "The Poetry of the Deaf," Harper's New Monthly</page><page sequence="22">530 / VICTORIAN POETRY Magatine 68, no. 406 [March 1884]: 596). Simpson published a book, Daydreams of the Deaf, in 1858. 10 Amos Draper, who became deaf as a child and was one of the first graduates of the National Deaf-Mute College in Washington, D.C. (Carol Padden and Tom Humphries, inside Deaf Culture [Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 2005], p. 60), later became a professor there (Gallaudet, p. 590). 11 Mary Toles Peet became deaf at the age of 13 and attended the New York Institution for the Deaf and Dumb. She was involved with the school for most of her life since her husband became its principal. During her life she published her poetry in deaf periodicals and it was only after her death that Peet's daughter published a volume of her poetry (Clark, pp. 42-43). 12 Laura Redden Searing attended the Missouri School for the Deaf and after graduat ing became a journalist and a civil war correspondent for the St. Louis Republican. Her first book, published in 1864, was a collection of war poems called Idyls of Battle and Poems of the Rebellion. She also published poems in a variety of periodicals and released multiple volumes of poetry: Songs From Secret Chambers (1874), Of El Dorado (1897), Echoes of Other Days (1921) (Jones and Vallier, pp. 1-14). Krentz calls Searing "arguably the most successful deaf writer in America during the century" (p. 167). 13 Angie A. (or Angeline) Fuller Fischer attended the Illinois school of the Deaf. Her col lection of poetry, The Venture, was published in 1883 and was very favorably reviewed; one reviewer, for instance, wrote "Hearing no sound, she sings with faultless rhythm and pleasing euphony" (Harry G. Lang and Barbara Meath-Lang, Deaf Persons in the Arts and Sciences: A Biographical Dictionary [Connecticut: Greenwood, 1995], p. 117). She was "the leading feminist in the American Deaf community" of her day advocat ing for deaf women's participation in associations and the national deaf-mute college (Lang, p. 117). 14 John Carlin was born deaf in Philadelphia to a poor family. He attended the Penn sylvania school for the deaf and worked as a visual artist. He published his poetry in periodicals. Krentz notes that "he went on to become one of the most accomplished deaf Americans of the period as a painter, writer, sculptor, acquaintance of hearing leaders like Horace Greeley and William Seward, and as an orator whose sign language presentations were in demand at deaf events" (p. 139). 15 Deaf Britons and North Americans shared strategies at Deaf conferences, reported each other's news in their periodicals, and expressed solidarity with the fights against Oralism that the other was waging. For more on the value of a transatlantic lens in deaf history, see Joseph J. Murray, who argues that "a look at the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Western Deaf world shows Deaf people of this time created and maintained consistent contact with one another over national and continental boundaries" ("Coequality and Transnational Studies: Understanding Deaf Lives," Open Your Eyes: Deaf Studies Talking, ed. H-Dirksen L. Bauman [Minneapolis: Univ. of Min nesota Press, 2008], p. 100). My transatlantic approach also acknowledges calls made in the field of Victorian Studies, most notably by Amanda Claybaugh, for expanding our critical scope beyond Britain's national borders. 16 Laura Redden Searing, "The Realm of Singing," in Jones and Vallier, p. 207. 17 James Nack, "Spring is Coming," New York Tribune, March 15, 1845. 18 John Carlin, "The Mute's Lament," American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb 1 (October 1847): 14.</page><page sequence="23">JENNIFER ESMAIL/ 531 19 The term "speaker," used in literary studies for the "narrator" of a poem, reveals a potentially problematic critical investment in the orality of poetry. I use the term within quotation marks throughout this paper in order to denote that I do not take the oral resonances of this term for granted. 20 Amos G.

Carlin declares that he "took delight in reading Shake speare, Milton and Pope" and that he, in his capacity as an art student in Paris, illustrated Paradise Lost (Gallaudet, p. 589). Unfortunately, there is limited evidence about what kinds of poetry most of these deaf poets were reading and appreciating, so it is generally difficult to trace precise influences or to gain insight into how they were responding to their contemporaries, like Tennyson, Browning, or Whitman, who were experimenting radically with form, deviating from traditional rhyme schemes, and developing new genres like the dramatic monologue. The only poet who appears by name in the deaf poets' compositions is John Keats. 24 Contemporary American deaf poet John Lee Clark makes the intriguing claim that deaf poetry reveals that "sound is mere medium, not source" of poetry (Clark, p. 7). 25 "Absurd," Oxford English Dictionary Online (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 2008). 26 See, for instance, Herbert Tucker, "Dramatic Monologue and the Overhearing of Lyric," Lyric Poetry: Beyond New Criticism, ed. Chaviva Hosek and Patricia Parker (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1985); Isobel Armstrong, Victorian Poetry: Poetry, Politics, Poetics (London: Routledge, 1993); Eric Griffiths, The Printed Voice of Victorian Poetry (Oxford: Oxford Univ.

Press, 2009). 27 Griffiths' assertion that speech communicates better than writing and his intimation that speech is essential to literacy (p. 19) reveal his original phonocentrism. His evi dence for these claims is derived from the product of Oralist deaf education. Griffiths' circular logic therefore uses evidence gleaned from a phonocentric system in order to defend phonocentrism. 28 Yopie Prins, "Victorian Meters," The Cambridge Companion to Victorian Poetry, ed.

Christopher Ricks, 3 vols. (London: Longman, 1987). 33 Margaret Linley uses a reading ofTennyson to offer the intriguing argument that Victo rian poetry's focus on absent voices may reflect developments in technology. She writes that "the anthropomorphic turn of Victorian poetry, and the lyric in particular, with its attempt to conjure dead, absent, and lost voices while talking (figuratively) about voice, should be examined as one of the central locations for expression of anxieties and fascination arising out of the possibility that both industrial-powered print and new communications technologies such as photography, the telegraph, and later the phonograph were remapping human co-ordinates."

John Pettigrew and Thomas J. Collins (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1981). 35 I restrict my examples for reasons of space, but we can certainly create a much longer list of Victorian poems that use the form of the written poem to meditate upon silence and the constraints on speaking subjectivity. Furthermore, there are all those poets, including Gerard Manley Hopkins and Algernon Charles Swinburne, who explicitly longed to infuse their written words with vocality. Hopkins, for instance, repeatedly emphasized in his letters that rather than "reading, as one commonly reads whether prose or verse, with the eyes," a reader should "take breath and read it with the ears, as I always wish to be read" (Gerard Manley Hopkins, The Letters of Gerard Manley Hopkins to Robert Bridges, ed. Claude Colleer Abbott [London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1935], April 22, 1879; p. 79). He wrote to Robert Bridges, "To do the (The Loss of the] Eurydice any kind of justice you must not slovenly read it with the eyes but with your ears, as if the paper were declaiming it at you. For instance the line, 'she had come from a cruise training seamen' read without stress and declaim is mere Lloyd's shipping intelligence; properly read it is quite a different thing. Stress is the life of it" (May 21, 1878; pp. 51-52). While Hopkins' image of a sheet of paper "declaiming" "The Loss of the Eurydice" at its readers seems humorous, it is an entirely suitable image for the same paradox that the deaf poets address: that is, the notion that written poetry should somehow speak from the page. 36 Singing-Mute, "Only a Few," The Deaf Mute 2, no. 1 (January 1889): 9-10. 37 Laura C.

Jacques Derrida has, of course, also traced the privileging of the "presence" of speech in Western history and philosophy (Jacques Derrida, Of Gram matology, trans.

Press, 1997]).</page><page sequence="25">JENNIFER ESMAIL/ 533 41 I borrow Davis' terminology here for the pervasive appearance of deaf characters in English novels, especially in the Victorian period. Davis notes that in these novels deafness is constructed as an "absence of language. And since language is seen as hu man, as 'us,' the deaf are seen as 'not us.' For this reason, deafness is often portrayed comically in literature and drama" (Davis, Enforcing, p. 113). Victorian fiction is rife with this ageist and ableist comedy. The deaf character appears frequently in Dickens' fiction, for example, from Wemmick's "Aged" father, in Great Expectations, with whom communication is reduced to nodding, to Mrs. Wardle, "the deaf old lady," in The Pickwick Papers, who must have secrets shouted into her ear (Charles Dickens, Great Expectations [London: Penguin, 1965, repr. 1985), pp. 230-231; Charles Dickens, The Pickwick Papers [Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1998], p. 93).

Landon's "To Wordsworth" and "Felicia Hemans" (Coleridge, Selected Poetry, ed. H. J. Jackson [Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1997]; Shelley, The Complete Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley, ed. Donald H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 20041; Landon, "Felicia Hemans," Letitia Elizabeth Landon: Selected Writings, ed.

Rundle [Peterborough: Broadview, 1999)). 45 For example, both the Norton Anthology of English Literature and the Broadview Anthology of British Literature preface the poem by quoting from Keats's friend Charles Brown: "Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in [the nightingale's] song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast table to a grass plot under a plum tree, where he sat for two or three hours" composing this poem. See John Keats, "Ode to a Nightingale," The Norton Anthology of English Literature. Volume D: The Romantic Period, 8th ed., ed. Jack Stillinger and Deidre Shauna Lynch (New York: W.W. Norton, 2006), and John Keats, "Ode to a Nightingale," The Broadview Anthology of English Literature, Volume 4, The Age of Romanticism, ed. Joseph Black et al. (Peterborough: Broadview, 2006). This account also appears in Richard Monckton Milnes's 1848 Life, Letters, and Literary Remains of John Keats, 2 vols. (London, 1848), 1:244-245. 46 Alfred Tennyson, "The Poet's Mind," in Ricks, ed., The Poems of Tennyson. As Campbell</page><page sequence="26">534 / VICTORIAN POETRY notes, "In the Memoir, Hallam Tennyson quotes [Tennyson] as saying. 'Before I could read I was in the habit on a stormy day of spreading my arms to the wind and crying out "I hear a voice that's speaking in the wind.'" The pre-Iiterate boy, we are asked to believe, could speak in pentameters" (Campbell, p. 126). Like the story of Keats's nightingale muse, this anecdote privileges the ear as the source of poetic inspiration: poets must be more than superior writers. They must also have a special receptive relationship to aural experience. 47 Christina Rossetti, "Song" ("When I am dead, my dearest"), Christina Rossetti: The Complete Poems, ed. R. W.

New York Times, July 14, 1859. 50 Contemporary American Sign Language (ASL) poetry and British Sign Language (BSL) poetry by deaf poets extend the definition of poetry even further. This body of poetry, which adopts terminology from written and oral poetry including "rhythm" and "rhyme" for use with the visual patterns of signed poems, is almost always completely divorced not only from sound but also from writing. The poetry is created and presented in signed languages and is reproduced through video-based formats. Referencing W. B. Yeats's declaration, in The Wind Among the Reeds (1899), that he created his poem out of a "mouthful of air," Clark writes that ASL poets "make poetry out handfuls of air; their lexicon is cinematic, giving rise to a new poetics" (p. 6).</page></plain_text>
