Ottawa: National Museum of Man, 1976. v + 308 pp. n.p. (paper). Regna Darnell University of Alberta This book deals with the role of narratives in the cultural and individual life of the Cree In- dians of James Bay, Quebec, Canada. The Mer- cury Series format permits presentation of a considerable amount of data and text that are of genuine interest in their own right besides confirming Preston's own argument. It is the belief of this reviewer that such publications, recording much of the data on which conclu- sions are based, are increasingly necessary in an- thropology because of the increasing theoretical diversity of the discipline. The richness of the data cannot be conveyed in a brief review, how- ever, so the focus here will be on the argument in theoretical terms. Preston suggests that narratives function most importantly to define and express basic cultural categories. The Crees have a uniform culture in which shared understandings of individual ex- periences are conveyed in traditional terms through narratives that themselves are con- firmed by individuals. The narrative provides an opportunity for the speaker to maintain the certainty of his own knowledge, and perhaps to create it, through the telling. The narrative thus constitutes an explanation of individual ex- perience, and such explanations become part of the definition of the culture itself. It is, as Preston notes, a personality-oriented study. Narrative is also a vehicle for a lifelong pro- cess of learning, beginning with child play at narrative. The Cree system of social control is embedded in individual knowledge and will, at least partially because of this process of narra- tive explanation linking the culture and the in- dividual experience. Competent Cree in- dividuals are those who link culture and ex- perience effectively. Because narrative plots oc- cur in culture, they have an important role in socialization as a child grows into an adult world of action in which narratives provide guides to moral and effective action. Preston takes issue with the notion of the narratives as reflecting a threatening environment, noting that tales of hardship suggest ways of overcoming it, and that the human action itself, partially through the structuring of the narrative, mitigates against the hardship of the environment. Three other functions of the narrative are as news, as entertainment, and as aesthetic expres- sion. These are particular neither to his analytic conclusions nor to the particular communica- tive economy of the Crees, and are not discussed further here. In what he calls an "inductive" method, Preston attempts to derive the meanings of con- juring power, attitudes toward hunting, and the personal symbolism of songs from his texts. He stresses that the role of the conjurer's spirit helper, his Mistabeo, must be understood within the context of the entire Cree world of persons (that is, of animate beings). The con- jurer must deal with an autonomous being who is not always available to direct communication. In discussing animal classes of person, Preston notes that their treatment as having personality is not anthropomorphism but application of well-observed species characteristics within the form of narrative. He suggests that animals are related to with "love" or with varying degrees of respect; in this reviewer's experience, the con- cepts of power as the basis of membership in the category of animate being or of harmony in the world of man and nature by virtue of having such power more nearly reflect the Cree at- titude. This entire discussion is extremely sophisticated in its effort to explicate meaning to members of the society. Preston is also concerned with exploring the organization of personality among the Crees, stressing the values of individual autonomy, self-control, and cultural uniformity. His discussion of autonomy relates to the claim that the Cree view the nature of the world as contin- gent (in contrast to the scientific concept of natural laws). Because the world is complex and often unpredictable, it is the will and self- imposed structure of the Cree person, as actor and as narrator, that mediates the contingency. Self-control is the essence of being a person and is manifested partially through the structuring of individual experience in cultural terms in narrative. Narrative also functions as a partial exception to the normal reticence of Cree per- sonal interaction, with, of course, the proviso that narrative must be controlled by the nar- rator. Credibility of the narrative is also an issue, with narratives evaluated on a scale of personal distance from just talking to tradi- tional or sacred story. Two terms are used with adjectives to convey these complex meanings. Credibility may be based on eyewitness status or on traditionalism. It seems to this reviewer that there is not a single scale here, but that the</page><page sequence="2">728 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [81, 1979] issues raised by Preston are fascinating and de- serve considerably fuller treatment. This is, in sum, an extremely important book, both in the issues it raises and in the sensitivity of Preston's discussion of Cree society as re- flected in narratives. It is a welcome antidote to the older anthropological style of folklore analysis, which restricted itself to the text. It is the kind of detailed ethnographic context and excursive explication provided by Preston that is likely to lead to progress in the analysis of mean- ing in culture. The only real gap seems to lie in the relationship of individual variability to the cultural uniformity that Preston postulates; this may be simply a topic for further investigation in a society that conceives the relationship very differently from the way Western society does.</page></plain_text>
