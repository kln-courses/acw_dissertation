<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME SOURCES OF VARIABILITY IN KTIAMATH MYTHOLOGY1 BY THEODORE STERN 2. CULTURE CHANGE, THE NARRATOR, AND THE FORM OF THE MYTH 2.I. Culture Change. The manner in which cultural context and social function affect mythic form can well be illustrated from the transformations wrought in the modification of the Klamath way of life. Soon after the establishment of their reservation, in I864-65, the Klamath were subjected to manifold pressures for change. Younger men, who had experienced pro- longed contact with Whites, took over tribal leadership, which soon became no more than nominal under the direct rule of the Agent. Shamans, as a class apart from the agency power-structure, were driven out of practice, and White doctors and White and Indian missionaries took their place. As Klamath internal structure was trans- formed, the family began to undergo profound modification. The extended family was gradually dissolved as an effective unit through the abolition of polygamy and by measures taken to "individualize the Indian," as one Agent glowingly described it. Lands were allotted in the early 90oo's to individuals, who had thereafter to dwell in biological families upon their tracts. Meanwhile, Modoc and alien Paiute were also moved onto the reservation; the slaves held by the tribes were freed and given legal equality with them, while informal unions with surrounding Whites and a few Negroes provided an additional complement of what all too often were in effect fatherless children. These developments brought about drastic alterations in reserva- tion society. Moreover, children were taken from the home, to be educated in alien ways and an alien tongue in the agency boarding school, where things Klamath were scorned. From their manifold contacts with Whites, on reservation and off, the Klamath learned less systematically and more eclectically of those alien ways. Today, most elderly Klamath find scant opportunity to tell the myths they heard in their youth, and there is little inclination on the part of children or grandchildren to listen. Their own sons and daughters, now middle-aged, will frequently be found to deny knowledge of the myths they must once have heard. Some among them, fearing scorn or genuinely convinced, stigmatize the old tales as "backward" or "sacrilegious." Others still regard them with a diffuse sentimentality-"The old Indians knew lots of stories, every kind of story"-but they do not pass them on to their own children. Radio, comic book, movies, and the like, have seized the imagina- tion of the younger Klamath, who thus foster other expectancies and cultivate tastes that find unpalatable the repetition of formal mythic style. I have heard of only two or three families-there must be several more-in which children have recently learned myths. In such instances the myths thus transmitted are generally few in number, and were heard from the lips of grandparents acting as baby-sitters or sup- porting the mother after the break-up of her marriage. While these tales are some- I35</page><page sequence="2">Journal of American Folklore times told in English, they are related by preference in the native tongue, and it is therefore significant that within these same families the children have picked up a smattering of Klamath-otherwise a most unusual occurrence today. I have been told (EB) that children listen to these myths only to the age of about ten, after which their interests are distracted to other things. These, to be sure, have been attritional changes. In a population the members of which have become diversified in outlook and interest, the cultural setting from which myth derived a manifold meaning has largely dissipated. There is no longer the extended family household to provide a suitable audience for narration. Un- doubtedly some of the emendations made by informants upon their original text appear simply because the narrator had not previously told the tale for some time.2 On the other hand, there is negligible incorporation within the myths of elements drawn from Euro-American sources. Even words derived from English are few: ,payAkot 'pocket,' boyak 'boy-little.' Items from the alien culture, such as firearms, do not appear, nor do horses, which are late additions to Klamath culture.3 Briefly, the informants who gave me their tales held a traditionalist position, although criti- cism expressed of AM indicates that some importation from White sources is going on among them. It would be unwarranted, however, to maintain that the inter-individual varia- bility they evince in their myth corpora reflects a wholly aboriginal picture. Even where agreement can be cited between myths told me and corresponding versions collected by Gatschet, these are after all dictated myths told to an outsider and are doubtless somewhat altered by those circumstances. Moreover, setting aside this con- sideration, one still faces the fact that the several Indians have dwelt in an accultura- tive continuum, to which they have made differential adaptation. The fact that certain broad correlates appear between biographies and myth assemblages (see be- low) justifies the belief that acculturation may have led in these individuals to a somewhat increased variation, particularly in the absence of a critical audience in narration during recent years. At the same time, there have been modifications in attitude that must to an ap- preciable extent have affected much of Klamath society. The specific data to be traced here, which have been alluded to previously, pertain to obscenity as a component of mythology. Hallowell has properly voiced a caution against the assumption that myths can be adequately understood without a recognition of their cultural context.4 His point is well taken; but it is at least encouraging to find in his account of Ojibway obscenity much that is couched in terms which seem familiar to a member of our own culture.5 There appears little reason to doubt that in aboriginal times, as now, the Klamath deemed obscenity an attractive lewdness. Thus, at least two myths told by the Klamath, "Kemukamps Abuses Himself" and "Penis and Vulva Race," to my knowledge find their closest extra-tribal cognates among the tribes lying at the termini of the Klamath Trail, which led down the Deschutes Valley, one branch passing through the Molala to the Santiam Kalapuya in the Willamette Valley, the other leading to The Dalles. A southern extension of distribution is found at least among the Wintu.6 These tales doubtless occurred in other, more distantly related versions; and close counterparts of those specified here may well appear in later collections from other tribes. The present limited distribu- tion suggests, relative to the Santiam Kalapuya and the Wishram, that these tales I36</page><page sequence="3">Some Sources of Variability in Klamath Mythology I37 were disseminated in the course of historic seasonal movements of the Klamath; and the central part played in each by obscenity may have been the chief attraction in its being taken over. Today, the tale of the contesting sexual organs produces an easy mirth in all Klamath who know it. Klamath myths, like those of many another tribe, exhibit a pervasive obscenity which is rather casual, non-ritual in character, and humorous in construction. Informants are in general agreement that in early times obscene detail of both an anal and an erotic character was presented as an essential feature of those myths in which it occurred, no concessions being made to the presence of children. At the same time, this component does not seem to have been either stressed or explained. Thus, both TL and LL heard "everything" from their grand-parents at a tender age. With developing sensitivity to American emphasis on age and sex correlates of ob- scenity, and of the Christian ethic which defines ideal behavior, there arose special public versions of the myth in which the narrator tended to elide the questionable passages, or to couch them in long words, incomprehensible-and unexplained-to the children. Side by side with such public versions existed shorter variants, compris- ing elaborations of the obscene episodes, the "dirty stories" mentioned earlier. Their milieu was the working or lounging gang of men, with some boys as hangers-on, and the intimate social gathering of adults. A certain primness characterized the attitude of EB when she recounted to me the myth of the marriage of Mink and Weasel to two one-eyed women-a tale pre- viously recorded by Gatschet from Dave Hill and Minnie Froben.7 Here, as in other instances, the status of the ethnographer was undoubtedly a controlling factor. In none of these versions does there appear the motif of Weasel's frustrating nuptial night, when he sought in vain to copulate between the fingers, under the arms, and so forth, of his bride. Yet this was freely included by HN in an English version of the same myth, and readily recalled with corroborating details by TL. HN had not heard the motif in the version recounted by his grandmother, but had been told it, at about the age of five, by some men. Similarly, TL had heard his version from men. LL neatly avoided explicit description of the aberrant behavior of the sexually- aggressive grandmother in her "Aisis and Kemukamps" (Klamath text), breaking into peals of laughter at the margin of one such lacuna. Her English version was somewhat more explicit, but lacks the wealth of detail that her husband, TL, or HN can add-although, to be sure, TL remarked judiciously of the other that "He's putting too much on a good story!" LL could sum up the truly prodigious genitalia of Kemukamps as "his nakedness," while both men went into lusty detail. As against the stress upon the humorously obscene, HN often employed phrases he claims to have heard in his grandmother's narratives which illustrate the euphemism characteristic of more recent times. Thus, in his "Aisis and Kemukamps," of the episode in which the latter causes sparks to alight upon Mudhen so that in dodging she exposes her privates, he insists that the word for the female organ must not be employed. Rather delicately, he says that Kemukamps ,sla'ala 'saw without [her] permission.' Judging by EB's immoderate laughter when she heard the term, the euphemism was well-known to her. Other versions make it clear that this device was standard, at least in recent times, at Klamath. Today, the few adults who recount myths to children tend to omit entirely, rather than to bowdlerize, such sections. These, then, are the ways in which shifting attitudes towards obscenity exemplify</page><page sequence="4">138 Journal of American Folklore trends in Klamath culture change. Taken together with attritional features of change, they indicate the measure in which Klamath myths found function within a specific socio-cultural milieu, and how when that context altered the myths in turn were prone to change. The factors making for modification find expression in the indi- vidual, in his role relationships with others, the idiosyncrasies of his life, and his personality. 2.2. Role of the Narrator. All those who have dealt with variability in mythology have recognized that in important degree its locus must be found to lie within the individual narrator. Opler cautiously points to correlates of interest and variance in myth,8 while Demetracopolou and DuBois are even able to contrast the version of a younger narrator with that of her elderly teacher;9 and Shimkin makes a penetrating analysis of myth-versions and the Rorschach protocols of respective narrators.10 For Radin, with his pioneer stress upon individual difference, the author-raconteur is, of course, focal.ll At the outset of the present research, informants were permitted to tell any myths that came to mind. While a certain measure of association might be thought to sug- gest a tale cognate in some measure to that just completed, explicit evaluations offered by the narrators themselves indicated that they were selecting myths that had a particular appeal to them. HN, who had been sightless for almost two decades, re- cited successively three myths in which that condition formed a part. EB, who saw herself in a sentimental light, particularly as regards her faithful devotion to the memory of her husband, stressed in the tales she recalled those with emphasis upon the conquest of young love. Her "Woman's Cap" is the only tale collected that re- volves about a central heroine. TL, who prides himself upon his shrewdness in deal- ing with his peers, seems actively to have identified with some of his characters in their triumphs, judged by his chortles when they had abased their rivals. But it was his wife, LL, who presented the clearest example, since her superior skill in charac- terization made manifest what she had in mind. Throughout the stories she termed her favorites there ran a thematic thread of concern with the deeply pathetic. It was in this dimension above all that she was skilled. Her "Spirit World," "Tkuluchag," and "Lululaidi" are outstanding examples of this genre. To an appreciable degree, the overall consistency noted is given form by elements which must be largely unanalyzed by the narrator and his audience. Although a good deal has already been said as to the selective force of personal attitude and experience, it may be well to indicate how general and non-specific this may be, relative to the mythological corpus of individual Klamath. This can best be shown by a brief com- parison of two individuals, both elderly men, HN and TL.12 TL was born of a Klamath mother and a White father. The latter early deserted his family, and mother and child went to live with her parents. As a boy, TL was the subject of childish jeers, and in consequence was withdrawn and somewhat lonely. He speaks now with scorn of his father. This boy, called Bostinaga (little White man) by his kindred, was curious about the new boarding school at Yainax, in the eastern sub-agency of the reservation, and when of age he voluntarily left home without a word to attend it with another boy. To him in retrospect the experience was a mixed one, with some kindness, but much unfairness and brutality, on the part of the Whites. With other boys he tried to flee, but failed. His life subsequent to this has been marked by themes of aggressive self-reliance</page><page sequence="5">Some Sources of Variability in Klamath Mythology and an awareness of marginality between two peoples. He married once, and has had several children, of whom four have died. The illness of one son brought him into the Shaker faith-but in Washington, where he was a visitor, rather than among his own people. He has since been a missionary to the Indian peoples of Smith River, in northern California. Like his wife, TL is a traditionalist by sentiment, a shrewd businessman in practice, with a keen delight in a "horse trade." He was drawn to the Shaker faith because it was one imparted by God to an Indian, and he leads a faction which takes strong issue with those who would introduce the Bible into service. As a self-reliant individual, he likewise rejects the sometimes bumbling bureaucracy of agency administration; and he consequently is prominent in a group which seeks the dissolution of reservation resources into individual hands. HN, by contrast, comes on both sides from influential Klamath lines. His child- hood seems to have been a happy and secure one; and he departed for boarding school in tears at leaving his family. Subsequently, when he was planning to go to Carlyle, his father refused to let him go so far away. At school, his experiences seem to have been far pleasanter and his associations with Whites warmer than TL's. After school, he began ranching, like TL, married a girl he had met at school, and had several children. Secure in his family relationships, he speaks repeatedly of the warmth and love which surrounded him and which, it is evident, he reciprocated. He is somewhat eclectic in religion: cured by the Shakers, he would have joined the church but for the dissension within it; he remained a devout Methodist, but was active in founding the Full Gospel church because of a feeling that it was needed in the community. Withal, he retains a strong measure of belief in native religion. For some two decades he has been blind as the result of an accident, but nevertheless has kept his cheerfulness of spirit. To him, many of the values of White culture are closely akin to those of the old Klamath, and there is nothing essential or final to separate them. While it is unnecessary to enter into minute detail at this point, it does seem im- portant to emphasize that a broad relationship may be said to exist for the two men between their attitudes toward orthodoxy and their life histories, here summarized in sketchy manner. Thus, TL insisted that there was only a single correct version of a given myth, and adhered rigidly to formal features. HN, on the other hand, seemed to experience the myths more profoundly; yet he varied the wording in two sequent tellings of the same myth, asserting that the wording was unimportant. He told one or two myths of rather deviant form-in particular his "Thunderbird"-and he was unimpressed by formal requirements. Not only did these attitudes recurrently appear in the myth-versions of the two men, but they were consistent with their overall disposition toward Indian and White cultures as well. The past experience of each of several individuals disclosed itself in side remarks made as the myths unfolded or were reviewed. Particularly revealing are the impress of idiosyncratic experience in the "Aisis and Kemukamps" of LL and of HN. The LL version opens with a lengthy episode in which the abandoned, sexually-aggressive misconduct of an old woman leads her grandchildren to run away. All other in- formants-mine, Gatschet's, and Curtis' 13-omit this introductory section, although HN recognized it and remarked that he had heard it in his boyhood told by another man as a separate tale. Even LL herself remarked that when she had formerly dictated the same myth to Spier this episode had been omitted. It is of course possible I39</page><page sequence="6">Journal of American Folklore that in the present version she had welded together two tales formerly independent. On the other hand, her husband, a stickler for adhering to traditional forms, heard her through and approved of her version as one he himself had heard before, while LL insisted that she told it exactly as she recalled it from her grand-uncle. Indeed, in the cognate version from the Tillamook, recorded by Elizabeth Jacobs,14 it is just this episode which serves to introduce it. It is, I think, significant that LL reported the version heard from her grand-uncle, since all other informants I could check had heard it from a grandmother. If grand- mothers were recounting the myth to grandchildren whom they were tending, there might be a feeling that the content of the introductory episode was unfit for the ears of their impressionable charges. Whatever the weight of this explanation, the effect upon motivation of the subse- quent episode is noteworthy. Here is detailed the flight of the children; the pursuit of the old woman; her discovery of their incest; the birth of their child, the infant, Aisis; the encounter of the old woman, disguised as a grizzly bear, with her grandson, whom she slays; and the vengeance of the young widow. LL, with the preceding episode in mind, thought the flight of the children well merited, and has Awl re- proach the old woman. When the latter discovers signs of the incest of her grandchil- dren, she utters an exclamation of horror, for, as LL explains, she realizes that her own example had led them astray. By contrast, the version of HN is far flatter and simpler in motivation. He had heard the myth from his cherished grandmother, and the flight of the children, which opens his version, seems to him wanton and cruel, while the grandmother's pursuit and her subsequent murder of the boy appear fully justified. While it is significant that for a given individual cherished tales or passages some- times present recurrent themes, it is equally noteworthy that they bear little sign of the narrator's favor beyond the elaboration of detail which marks them. The primary evidence of the effect they have for the narrator lies rather in the side remarks he makes. It is always uncertain in the Klamath material-as it must also be with Opler's-whether a present narrator is himself the author of the features which dis- tinguish his version from those of others. It remains clear, however, that individuals select favorite myths, and when they relate them they tend to stress in some measure well-loved passages. There may be differences attributable to sex-thus, the "soft," romantic themes of EB and the pathos of LL as against the aggressive and competi- tive emphases of TL and HN-but the sample is too small to merit confidence in this regard, and the free selection by AC (an elderly woman) gave a series closer to that of the men.15 That there may likewise be age and role determinants seems prob- able in theory, but these can be isolated only with difficulty from so small a sample. The difficulty of ascertaining that a given narrator is responsible for the features by which his myths differ from those of others makes it hazardous to essay a statement. Moreover, it must be emphasized that informants were familiar with a wider range of myths than they would ordinarily have told and that the audience often had a voice in the selection of the myth to be related. The control exercised by the listeners over the form of the tale served to limit the range of freedom within which the raconteur could move. The chief field for the display of individual talents lay in styl- istic elaboration, which was highly prized. Present-day Klamath are far from in- different to these effects. Several of them, hearing me read myths which had been I40</page><page sequence="7">Some Sources of Variability in Klamath Mythology dictated to me, commented upon the "stiffness" of one account, the "power" of an- other.l6 A consideration of the manner in which the raconteur works with his ma- terial leads to a central analysis of formal and stylistic aspects of the Klamath myth. 2.3. Style and Form. As a class, the myths of the Klamath are not distinguished by name from other oral narratives, but with them are singly termed s'asapg',lis 'a telling, tale.'" It is, above all, in the dramatis personae and in setting that myths may be said to be distinctive at Klamath. Modern informants speak of them as dealing with the times "when animals walked and spoke like men," in an epoch "before the present people came." Supernaturals sometimes invoke change for the benefit of the pseodi was 'the people to come,' and several myths contain reference to a council at which mythic beings under Kemukamps ordained the present cosmic order. Among themselves, Klamath myths are usually grouped according to protagonist. There are, for example, Mink and Weasel tales, Kemukamps tales, tales of Skunk, of Coyote, of Chakeak, of Owl, together with those of many other mythic beings. If a myth bears a title, it is usually "The Story of So-And-So." Although names of the characters are commonly those of animals, the subjects themselves are often presented in so highly anthropomorphic a form that their bestial nature is obscured.l8 The confusion which marks the modern Klamath view, in the face of the ambivalent therio-anthropomorphic myth figures, is neatly reflected in LL's "Coyote's Grandmother and the Five Deer," in which her text vacillates, in reference to the deer, between the words for quadrupedal and for bipedal jumping, the self-same action being involved. The tendency to dwell upon the human attributes, or at least to present them in the greater number of instances, tends today to dissolve any logical boundary that might be said to exist between myth and novelistic tale. The major characters of the latter are humans living in the present order; but it is a world which may include the events and beings we term "supernatural."19 From what has already been said, it can be seen that myth, equally with the novelistic tale, commanded belief as literally true. The few of the latter included in my sample happen not to include such mythic features as the test theme, and none contains a transformation which has left a "picture"-a natural feature-as its witness. Whether this would hold true for a more extended series, I cannot say. It remains true, however, that today a sharp break between mythic and novelistic forms does not exist; and it is at least questionable that it was present in Gatschet's day. Informants termed them all "old Indian stories," and made further categorization only by protagonist. This was as true for what is here termed the novelistic tale as for the myth. Klamath myths are variable in length. Entire episodes may be omitted from one version or may be told as separate stories. Independent myths need not be in specific order; and this holds true even for those tales which relate to the same protagonist. There is, concretely, no set sequence in which Mink and Weasel stories must be told. At the same time, there are the minor loosely-linked cycles,20 in which these heroes pass through a series of adventures, any one of which might have independent exist- ence. Within the cycle, the order in which component episodes appear is fixed by their relation to natural features. The precise spot may be differently defined in one local group and its neighbor, but it is always specified when known. For a given group, the identification of a series of natural features with the component episodes of a cycle tends to preserve the sequence in which they occur. That one need not invoke culture change to explain the variable length of the I4I</page><page sequence="8">Journal of American Folklore Klamath myth is clear enough. In 1877 Gatschet's informants, Minnie Froben and Dave Hill, dictated texts which relate only segments of the myth of "Aisis and Kemukamps," and from his appended notes it is clear that the full version was known to him.21 Thus, even at that time, shortly after the onset of intensive contact, there seems to have been no compunction to narrate this important myth in its en- tirety. The Klamath analogue of the "sweathouse story" shows again the segregation and elaboration of a single episode; and this practice, as mentioned earlier, may have had aboriginal roots. Finally, the fact that a narrator might break off his tale when he found his audience no longer responsive underscores again the conclusion that the Klamath were little concerned with a formally "complete" narration. A further word of qualification must, however, be pressed. While the raconteur is under no compulsion to relate fully a given myth, it is clear that both for him and for his audience there exists an integrity of plot, and that episodes such as the "Night- Hawk" of TL or the "Story of Mink and Thunder" of HN are viewed by their nar- rators as detached segments of a larger entity. The facility with which isolated motifs are referred to named stories is part and parcel of this attitude. Yet, at the upper limits, the incorporation of additional elements is resisted, as some informants re- jected the mooted introductory episode in LL's "Aisis and Kemukamps." Here, again, there is evident an awareness of a formal unity which is not to be transgressed. As revealed by the tales themselves, it is simplicity and directness which comprise cardinal traits in the development of the Klamath myth. The order is that of a linear progression, largely devoid of branching diversions into side-episodes. From the brief passage which sets the scene, the Klamath myth moves with economy into the heart of the action, achieves a climax, and ties up the details in a brief post-climactic passage, often no more than a sentence, that characteristically brings the hero home or sends the trickster along his way. Unity of plot is not of necessity built about the development of a single climax. To be sure, EB's "The Woman's Cap" and LL's "Skunk as Shaman" have as theme an offense against the hero and the subsequent righting of this wrong,22 while HN's "Gilili" enlarges upon the slaying of a monster animal and the victorious return of the hero. In these tales and others like them, despite the presence of minor episodes that serve to enlarge nodes of action along the line of development, there is a single major continuity. In such myths as LL's "Tkuluchag" and her "Crater Lake," on the other hand, there is a bi-modal development: it is as if, in each, two tales had become fused. Finally, cycles, as exemplified in the tales of Mink and Weasel, are character- ized by a sequence of peaks, as one passes from one episode to the next. A concrete example of the manner in which action may be developed is TL's "Old Fish Hawk." Briefly, the plot is as follows: Mink and Weasel prepare to visit their sister, married to Fishhawk and living with him at Klamath Falls. Weasel spies on Mink's wife, Wood-tick, as she prepares their lunch, blowing up the fire with her flatus. At his glance, she falls dead. Mink revives her, and the two brothers set off. They reach their sister's, and Mink gives her five small sacks of seeds. Fishhawk now comes home from spearing fish. He derides the gift of food as inade- quate and swallows successively the contents of the five sacks. At once the seeds swell up and choke him. His wife implores Mink to help her. He instructs her to spread out mats, then places Fishhawk kneeling before each mat in turn and hits the base of his skull; 142</page><page sequence="9">Some Sources of Variability in Klamath Mythology whereupon Fishhawk vomits the food he has eaten. Recovered, Fishhawk remarks on the quantity of food, and tells his wife to store it away. Now Mink's sister begins to cook for the visitors. Stingy Fishhawk selects a meager fish for them, at which his wife weeps. Magically, Mink causes the fish to increase in size. After eating, Mink throws the backbone into the river, whereupon it becomes a trout. Mink runs back and asks for a fish-spear, but Fishhawk insists on going himself to catch the fish. His catch drags Fishhawk into the water, and his wife must once again appeal to Mink for help. This time, Mink gives her a pole, together with instructions. She extends the pole to her husband, who catches it, and succeeds in pulling him ashore. When Fish- hawk in turn draws in his spear, the fish once more resumes its meager form. The next day, Mink and Weasel depart. The incidents of the visit to Fishhawk exhibit a striking parallelism. Like any guest visiting his relatives, Mink brings food to his sister. Fishhawk ungraciously derides the gift and reaps his retribution, not by a magical act directed against him but by virtue of the supernatural quality of the food he has misappropriated. His wife appeals to her brother, in terms of his own welfare-a plea to which a close kinsman might be expected to respond. Like the powerful, shaman-like figure he is, Mink does not spring to action, but issues instructions for preparations to be made. The cure, with Fishhawk kneeling abjectly, head near the floor, and suffering blows that cause him to vomit the product of his greed, is punishment in itself, and Fish- hawk can only praise the magnanimity of the gift when he is done and the five large heaps of seeds are lying on the mats. When the fish are to be cooked, however, Fishhawk once more exhibits unhostlike qualities, for he selects for his guests one of the type known as "ruptured-bladder fish," slight and meager in form. His wife is shamed by this treatment of her kins- man, but Mink magically causes the fish to grow, and he and Weasel feast upon it. Through his power, Mink causes the bones to become once more a large fish. Fish- hawk, asked for his spear, ungenerously insists on spearing the fish himself, and thus again through his own action places himself at the mercy of a supernatural event. When his wife appeals to her brother, in the set terms mentioned above, he directs her how to save her husband. Again, Mink takes no active part in the rescue. This time, when Fishhawk is saved, a bedraggled figure, the fish reverts to its original form. It is clear that elaborations which take the form of parallelism in their develop- ment profit from the anticipation awakened in the audience. To watch a boastful figure move into an upset is doubly satisfying if we can foresee how it will come to pass. Other parallelisms, however, have a more formal basis. One of the most usual is the set repetition of episodes in sequences of five. This is the pattern number of the Klamath, and accordingly brothers are apt to come in fives, with the youngest pos- sessed of the greatest power. If the hero has four elder brothers, the monsters are likely to kill them off before the hero avenges them. If the monsters come in fives, they must inevitably be dispatched seriatim by the hero. Tests imposed by a father- in-law or by an aggressive host are likely also to come in fives. The total effect, in oral rendition, has something of a rhythmic, cyclic quality which is lost in print. Narrators today deal with the five-fold repetition in different ways. HN finds the formal requirements thus made upon him frankly irksome, and often repeats an episode for no more than a total of three times, although admitting that five would I43</page><page sequence="10">Journal of American Folklore formerly have been proper. It is noteworthy that even when given the freedom of narrating into a tape recorder, so that the pace of his speech was unhampered, he still tended to truncate the reiterated series.23 The content of each iterated segment, however, was very close to that of the initial segment. TL, on the other hand, insisted on following the five-segment formula-in dictation, he would sometimes pause to ask, "How many does that make?"-and clung to a presentation that varied little for each successive iteration. LL tended to employ the same words in each successive seg- ment, expanding the third sequence with new details, dropping back to a sparser fourth iteration, and elaborating again the fifth telling. In one or two instances, both TL and LL found it proper to recount a full five sequences, bringing the successful change only on the sixth telling. How far this was an effort to keep the ethnographer guessing is debatable. Other forms of elaboration are less prominent. There is, for example, little of the anticipatory narrative of Winnebago folklore,24 in which a character outlines a future course of action for another and foretells its events. Of my chief informants, HN was most given to this device, which makes its appearance in several of his tales.25 In one of these, "Swai's Child," moreover, the hero on occasion recounts his own tragic past to relatives, a usage allied to the preceding device but not itself common. Other raconteurs resort but little to either anticipatory or retrospective statements. EB makes extensive use of direct quotation,26 thus imparting to her story immediacy and freshness. It is a device tellingly used by LL, as well, but occupies by contrast a minor place in the narrative of TL. The manner in which two of these narrators develop the final phase of the pursuit of the gigantic herbivore, Gilili, by little Weasel is illustrative of the devices they may draw upon. HN resorts to direct quotation and the gradual dawning of certainty as hunter and hunted approach: "Weasel then chased it back again in this direction. Now the people heard the sound of repeated footsteps. Now they looked around. Now they saw something big approach by running. Now all the people looked around at it. Outside they saw a small thing running right behind Gilili. Now they said and guessed, 'That one out there is not Mink's younger brother. Maybe that's not Mink's younger brother.' Some more said, 'That one there is Mink's little younger brother.' Now they said, 'That's he, Mink's younger brother.' In this direction he chased it. Now he was right there, close in sight of that place. Then Weasel shot and killed Gilili. Gilili fell down hard. Now he lay there like a little mountain." The corresponding passage by LL is not fully comparable, since it was given in a brief English summary. Nonetheless, a somewhat different treatment is manifest: "Popweks [a big frog] heard something coming, it was Gilili and [Weasel]. (The wind on the ,ime [Mink's weapon, here borrowed by Weasel] sounded like a thunder- storm.) [Crow] says, 'How do you know something is coming? How do you know further than I can see and hear?' Popweks says, 'You're cross-eyed!' And the people said, 'Who could it be make noise like that ? There could be nobody could make noise like that, only [Mink's] little brother.' He was wearing the last pair of moccasins [i.e., of an original five] when he killed Gilili." Klamath raconteurs are not, in the main, given to elaboration that has as its sole objective the delineation of character or the description of place or situation. Neither the direct detailing of traits nor the employment of episodes to achieve obliquely the same end are at all common. Rather, these qualities are brought out through the 144</page><page sequence="11">Some Sources of Variability in Klamath Mythology medium of the action itself. There is virtually no presentation of the physical appear- ance of a character unless it is germane to the plot. His inner state, on the other hand, is sure to be revealed with the unfolding of a dramatic episode, for Klamath narrators rarely leave individual motivation in obscurity.

Marion Pearsall, in Klamath Childhood and Edu- cation, Univ. of Cal. Anthro. Rec., IX, 5 (Berkeley, I950), 342, indicates role differentiation even in the early youth of the Klamath child. It is also possible that the other women have been more profoundly influenced by American mores. 16 do not believe that the latter term had reference to the content of the myth in question, LL's "Aisis and Kemukamps."

I assume, from comparison of published texts with their original 145</page><page sequence="12">Journal of American Folklore form in Gatschet's notebooks, that those texts in question have been given in full as dictated. There has apparently been some editing of a minor character (Gatschet, p. 7). Thanks are due to Matthew W. Stirling, Chief, Bureau of American Ethnology, for making available to.me micro- films of Gatschet's unpublished notes. At least some of the contents, designed for a third volume on the ethnology of the Klamath and Modoc, appear to have been incorporated in the two volumes actually published. 22 Although Skunk, in the latter tale, is finally defeated once more. 23 It is possible that even this situation was somewhat threatening to him; and despite the presence and vocal response of members of the ethnographic party, he must have missed the leisurely relaxation of the story-telling sessions of his youth. 24 Radin, pp. 10-I5. 25 Notably his "Lao's Daughter," "Black Bear and Deer," and "Swai's Child." 26 In her "Story of Mink and Weasel."

The tellers of myths and folk tales had it right, Knew how betrayal came-not from the slaughter, From foe or fray, ill wind or angry water, But from a lover, friend, a son or daughter. Always the citadel withstood the siege But not the whispers of the favored child, Who, when a passing stranger stopped and smiled, Told where the old king's soul had been enisled. Ariadne, Oedipus, Medea, Took but the Judas paths we daily take, For, wittingly or not, say what you like, Only those who are loved know where to strike. ?
