Duncan, and John R. Southon 7'hiis r-eport presents four radiocar-bon dates of charcoal pigments fromn Picture Cave, a site located in a remote wooded area in east-central Missouri. Carbon fi-oin charcoal pigments was extractedfriom three rock drawvings on the wvall of this cave. 7'he four- pigmnent samples contained suJficient carbon for accelerator mass spectrometric radiocarbon analysis. 7'hese black pig- ment samples (red and wvhite paints are also present in the cave) yielded dates that place their affiliated motifs in a time-framne associated with Cahokia ca. 950 years ago. 7'he dates are somewhat earlier than expected. We discu.ss the dates in connection vith the iconography of the three miiotif panels tested.

Los tableros y temnas exponen una copiosa cantidad de data iconografica. Comno parte del proyecto de campo en 1996, Rowve y Hyman, qufinicos analfticos de la Universidad de Texas A &amp; M, extrayeron cinco mniestras de pigmento de hi zona. Cuatro de las muestras contenian suficiente carbono para la dataci6n de "Accelerator Mass Spectrometry."

Las fechas resultantes apoyan las estimaciones temporales originales asociadas con este sitio unico, expuestos en Diaz Griantidos (1993). his research followed a 1993 statewide sur- 7j7 vey to document and analyze all known pet- roglyph and pictograph sites in Missouri (Diaz-Grana'dos 1993). After completing the study of 134 rock art sites in the state, Diaz-Granados con- cluded that AMS radiocarbon dates were needed to place at least a selection of the rock art sites on a more secure chronological footing. Mississippian iconography in the Southeast has been discussed by several scholars (e.g., Brown 1989; Griffin 1952; Hall 1989; Howard 1953,1968; Knight 1989; Muller 1989; Waring and Holder 1945); however, it is not temporally well defined for Missouri. Because iconographic data, particularly in relation to diagnostic artifacts, are not temporally well defined in this region, six rock art sites were selected for dating. The first site in the series is Pic- ture Cave, which was chosen for its well-preserved pictographs containing ample amounts of black pig- ment as well as diagnostic motifs. In addition, Pic- ture Cave features portrayals of story panels and representations of supernatural beings with associ- ated cultural materials and symbolic motifs. Picture Cave is located on a high hill within a remote, wooded, karst area in east-central Missouri. Unfortunately, by the time professional archaeologists were notified of the existence of the pictographs and taken to the site, the cave floor had been seriously vandalized and an undetermined number of artifacts removed. Judging from the dates inscribed on its walls, Picture Cave has had casual visitation for over a century, with a probable increase in vandalism dur- ing recent years as artifact values reached unprece- dented levels. Our research team has been able to retrieve only a few small remnants of pottery, bone, and hematite from the surface of the disturbed areas.

Line drawings of four examples of longnosed god maskettes: a. Picture Cave (Missouri) painted maskette in white and black pigments (drawn from slide); b. Rogana (Tennessee) shell maskette (drawn after Williams and Goggin 1956:33); c. Big Mound (Missouri) copper maskette (drawn after Williams and Goggin 1956:10); d. Meppen (Illinois) copper maskette (drawn from slide). A longnosed god maskette panel at Picture Cave is estimated to date possibly as early as the Devel- opmental Mississippian (A.D. 900-1150) according to Muller (1989:14). These maskettes (Figure 1) are believed to fit into the early expansion period at Cahokia (pre-Southeastern Ceremonial Complex), on the northern fringe of the Mississippian domain (Kelly 1991:73; Williams and Goggin 1956:58-59). However, this motif extends into later time periods. Diagnostic motifs at this cave, particularly the mace, are cited as good temporal markers by Muller (1989:15). He also includes the bi-lobed arrow as a definitive time marker for "Southern Cult" (mid-thir- teenth century), and the ogee, both of which are com- mon in Missouri rock art. Other motifs such as concentric circles (shoulder tattoo or paint), and the falconid eye, are present in the pictographs at Pic- ture Cave and associated with other Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC) motifs. The AMS dates obtained are slightly older than the initial esti- mated range of A.D. 1050 to 1100 (Diaz-Grana'dos 1993:326). Experimental Procedure Until the results of van der Merwe et al. (1987), no direct dating of charcoal pigments in rock paintings had been reported. Ten years later, charcoal draw- ings on the walls of this Missouri cave site are believed to be the first in the Mississippi Valley region to be directly dated. With one exception discussed later, these charcoal pigment samples were processed by the plasma-chemical technique (Hyman and Rowe 1997a, 1997b and references therein), per- mitting direct radiocarbon analysis by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), leading to age estimates for the associated drawings. Sample Collection Five small samples of charcoal were taken from the rock paintings (only -. 1 mg of carbon are necessary</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS 483 for an AMS determination of the 14C). Latex gloves were worn during sample collection and subsequent handling. Samples were scraped with new scalpel blades onto clean aluminum foil. The sample's loca- tion on the panel was noted and photographed. Of the five samples taken for processing at the Texas A&amp;M laboratory, three contained sufficient carbon for AMS analysis. These processed samples were sent to the Lawrence Livermore National Labora- tory's Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry. The largest sample was split in two to provide us with comparative analyses. Chemical Pretreatment The analytical chemistry lab at Texas A&amp;M Uni- versity used the usual NaOH treatment (ultrasoni- cation for -1 hr at 50 ? 5?C) to remove humic acids from charcoal. HCI treatment, also suggested as stan- dard, is unnecessary with our technique and may even present some problems for dating rock paint- ings when calcium oxalate is present in the sample (Pace et al. 2000). The lab filtered the NaOH and the sample through binder-free borosilicate glass filters that had been baked overnight at -600?C to remove organic contamination. Plasma extractions were run on the dried filtrate material on the filter. Plasma Extraction The lab used radio-frequency-generated low-tem- perature (-150?C), low-pressure (-1 torr) oxygen- plasmas, coupled with high vacuum techniques, to remove carbon from charcoal in the paint sample leaving the substrate rock and carbonate/oxalate accretions intact (Hyman and Rowe 1997a, 1997b and references therein). The plasma extraction sys- tem was cleaned with oxygen plasmas before sam- ple insertion to rid surfaces of organic contamination. After a sample was loaded into the plasma chamber, the chamber was evacuated to 104 torr and then filled with .2 torr ultra-high purity argon (99.999 percent). Low-power argon-plasmas were run on each sample to remove adsorbed CO2 that may have entered during sample insertion. This process works by inelastic collision of the unreactive, but high energy, argon atoms and ions with adsorbed CO2 molecules. The lab repeated argon-plasmas until the amount of carbon desorbed as CO2 was &lt; .001 mg, an amount that has a negligible effect on radiocar- bon analysis. Following the final argon-plasma for each sample, the system was pumped to _10-7 torr and left pumping for several hours. Vacuum pumps were then closed to the system and any rise in pres- sure was monitored for an hour or more to evaluate the extent of possible leakage of atmospheric CO2 into the plasma chamber. No significant leaks were found. The chamber was next filled with 1.0 torr ultra-high purity oxygen (99.999 percent), and the sample oxidized in a low-temperature plasma. The gaseous CO2 produced by the oxygen plasma oxidation of the charcoal in the paint samples was collected and its pressure measured, after the water produced in the plasma reaction was removed by freezing. The CO2 was then frozen at -1 940C with liquid nitrogen, sealed into a borosilicate glass tube, and sent to the Lawrence Livermore National Lab- oratory's Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry for 14C analysis. Validation of Technique The validity of the analytical chemistry laboratory's plasma-chemical technique was assessed by several means. First, the chemists conducted isotopic analy- sis of 14C-free samples (Albertite coal, International Atomic Energy Authority standard wood, Axel Heiberg wood and commercial graphite) run at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Center for AMS (Ilger et al. 1995:301) and at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) laboratories. Scientists at the ANSTO AMS Centre graphitized CO2 produced in the plasma oxidation system from the Albertite coal, Axel Heiberg wood, and commercial graphite 14C-free materials. Following AMS measurements on the ANTARES accelerator, it was concluded that the contamination added by the plasma system was small compared to .9 Rtg modem carbon equivalent (Law- son, personal communication 1998). The chemists also compared their dates with sam- ples of previously dated material (archaeological charcoal, Third International Radiocarbon Inter- comparison wood, and ostrich eggshell) and found agreement within statistical uncertainties (Ilger et al. 1995:301). For the eggshell, the oxygen plasma was used to clean the sample; CO2 was removed for dat- ing by phosphoric acid treatment. In addition, they also compared a series of their dates with archaeo- logically inferred age ranges; in virtually every case, the validity of the technique was supported (Hyman and Rowe 1997b:7). And in some instances, we recovered enough of the paint sample to permit repli-</page><page sequence="4">484 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 66, No. 3, 2001] cate analysis (samples 41VV75-29A &amp; B) (Hyman and Rowe 1997a:64), samples 41VV75-37A-F (Hyman and Rowe 1997a:64; Ilger et al. 1996:410), samples 41VV75A-1-6 (Hyman and Rowe 1997a:64; Pace et al. 2000), and finally the duplicate dates on Drawing #3 described in this paper. All these studies support the general validity of this tech- nique with an uncertainty of ? 250-300 years. Problems with Charcoal Dating It is important to remember that measurement of 14C from charcoal establishes the date of the charcoal, not of the rock painting itself. When dating charcoal pigments, one must consider two potential problems associated with dating charcoal from rock paintings: "old wood" (Schiffer 1986) and "old charcoal" (Bed- narik 1994). Because of the "old wood" problem, it is always possible that the charcoal from the draw- ings that were sampled was older than the graphics. The charcoal date gives the time of death of the tree-or at least of the part of the tree from which the pigment was prepared. Thus the charcoal could be old because it came from the older rings of a large tree of considerable age, or it could be from a tree that may have died (whether by human agency or naturally), but only much later burned to produce charcoal. In either case, the age estimate of the char- coal yields a maximum age of the drawing. Similarly, there may be a situation in which there is "old char- coal" on a cave floor from a burning episode that occurred much earlier than the time it was collected and used to construct a drawing. This is particularly problematic in the dark zones of caves, where fires may have been burned for reasons having nothing to do with rock paintings, the charcoal having been picked up much later to be used for pigment. In that case, an age for charcoal once again represents a maximum age for the time of painting. Thus there is little assurance that a drawing is not possibly younger than the charcoal age indicates, and the "old wood and charcoal" caveats must always be kept in mind when considering charcoal rock-painting "dates." We attempt here to evaluate the seriousness of these effects on the specific samples of the present study. It is not expected that dead trees will last very long after dying in the environment near Picture Cave. Under the most favorable conditions for decay, they could be gone within a few years according to Charlotte Schneider of the Forestry Division, Mis- souri Department of Conservation (personal com- munication). However, there are many variables to the decay rate: e.g., type of tree, size of tree, season of death (if a tree dies during the summer when it has more moisture, it decays faster than in winter when it is drier), the health of the tree (diseased trees decay more rapidly). Thus, an old-wood factor from trees lying around a substantial time (hundreds of years) is not likely for these samples. Furthermore, there was little charcoal on the cave floor, at least when it was first seen by Diaz-Granados and Dun- can in 1992, so that the old-charcoal factor is per- haps not important here, either. It seems that only the felling of an already old tree would be likely to con- tribute to the old charcoal problem in the present case. It is therefore probable that the radiocarbon ages obtained here are good estimates of the actual time the paintings were created. In addition, some sections of wall exhibit a build-up of silica coatings over the pictographs, which could also strengthen the case and attest to their longevity. Description of Rock Paintings Dated The following discussion addresses the iconography and ethnographic associations (where available) of the three charcoal drawings in Picture Cave for which dates were obtained. We rely heavily upon the oral traditions of Siouan-speaking groups because Mis- souri's earliest known and largest group of occu- pants were the Osage and they were Sioux speakers. To the north lived the Missouri. The Osage spoke Dhegihan Sioux and the Missouri spoke Chiwere Sioux. Dhegihan dialect was also spoken by the Omaha from whose oral traditions comparative data are also borrowed. Other cognate groups are the Ponca, Quapaw (or Arkansas), and the Kansas (or Kaw). The Mandan and Hidatsa are also Sioux speak- ers and are referenced because their oral traditions are similar and their location is on the adjacent Plains to the north and west of Missouri. In sum, they are all related linguistically (Bowers 1992:16; Fletcher and La Flesche 1992:35). Pictograph #1. Figure 2 shows a large anthropo- morph (-60 cm high) on the long vertical wall of the main chamber. The figure is drawn in black pigment (charcoal) with its elaborate body-wrapped torso to the front and the head in profile. The figure's fea- tures and iconography fit into Muller's discussion of SECC themes (Muller 1989:15) and prompted Diaz- Grana'dos (1993:326) to suggest that the panel falls within the Mississippian period. The figure's eye has</page><page sequence="5">REPORTS 485 N F 2 t # r t o a th Figure 2. Pictograph #1: Large anthropomorph drawn on the main vertical wall of the cave (from Diaz-Grandidos 1993). a falconid or forked design (Williams 1977:11), and the right hand holds a trefoil-headed mace or war club. These motifs were originally estimated by War- ing (Williams 1977:23-29) to have appeared sud- denly and late in the Mississippian period in the Southeast and to have extended into historic times in altered forms. (Williams also discusses the chrono- logical problems with the various Southeastern cer- emonial objects.) Another notable feature of this anthropomorph is that the left shoulder displays a design consisting of nested circles similar to those on the figures portrayed on shell cups found at Spiro, Oklahoma (Hamilton 1952:214; Brown 1996:602; Phillips and Brown 1978:Plates 2 and 6), the Gottschall site in Wisconsin (Salzer 1987:452), and as portrayed in the John White watercolor of "An Indian Chief' (Lorant 1946:193). Possibly the most striking feature of this figure is its clothing: a "body wrap" with a design much like the Ranch-Incised ceramic design consisting of nested semi-circles in a row, side by side and over- lapping (Phillips et al. 1951:119, and plate 99). The design also resembles that seen on a rabbit-hair gar- ment from the Spiro site pictured in Hamilton (1952:270-271). The back of the head has a bun or twisted hair braid and a single, large vertical feather. Stylistically, the rendering of this figure is similar to the engraved human heads on pottery sherds associ- ated with Mound 34 and the Iseminger Spindle Whorl, all from Cahokia (Brown 1989:194-197).</page><page sequence="6">486 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 66, No. 3, 2001] Kf &amp; ___. __. __. __ .__cm 0 10 Figure 3. Pictograph #2, Probable representation of the Underwater Spirit (from Diaz-Granados 1993). Pictograph #2. Figure 3, drawn on the cave wall in charcoal, probably represents the "Underwater Spirit" known throughout the Mississippian region and referred to by various names: Piasa, Uktena, or Underwater Panther (Emerson 1989:59; Howard 1960; Jacobson 1991; Knight 1989:209; Philips and Brown 1978:200; Temple 1956). This creature, while usually representative of the lower world, carries varying attributes of all three levels: wings (upper world), antlers (middle world), and scales (lower world). Depending on the oral tradition, the Under- water Spirit can be benevolent or malevolent, and may carry either a male or female connotation. It is depicted here in a lower-world setting (i.e., a partially wet cave), which is no doubt significant. The figure is positioned on a diagonally slanting wall facing into the cave just above the entryway into a lower level. We assume that placement of most, if not all, of the drawings is significant and symbolic, just as placement is meaningful in ceremonial functions, and as are locations of structures associated with spirit helpers and clan-associated deities (Fletcher and La Flesche 1992:509-553). The antlered Under- water Spirit is located away from the Morning Star figure, the Thunderers, and other upper-world fig- ures. With its serpent-like tail, it may symbolize one of the husbands of the "Old-Woman-who-never- dies," another earth deity found in Siouan ethnogra- phies (Bowers 1963:202]; Brown 1997:477; Phillips and Brown 1978). These ethnographies record that snakes, sometimes synonymous with the Underwa- ter Spirit, were her husbands (Bowers: 1963:202). While the Underwater Spirit figures prominently in iconography during the late prehistoric period, most of these depictions are on pottery. The underwater figure was the mythic animal of the Shell Society. It was lord of all animals, and the reincarnator of spir- its, according to the oral tradition of the Omaha (also Dhegihan Sioux speakers). While most of the draw- ings at the cave are in profile, the head of this Under- water Spirit motif is in a frontal position glaring at the viewer. It displays major classic attributes of the Underwater Spirit, i.e., antlers, fangs, large eyes, and ear spools. A striking element of Pictograph #2 (Figure 3) is the set of white-tailed deer antlers delicately drawn</page><page sequence="7">REPORTS 487 '~'' .&gt;*~~~V 4t ~ ~ 4 i 0 10 F F I r cm Figure 4. Pictograph #3, Bent arm with pelt (from Diaz-Granados, 1993). above the head. We believe they are white-tailed deer antlers because Missouri has only white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and the main beams of their antlers have the graceful lyre-like curve depicted in the pictograph (see Schwartz and Schwartz 1981:335-348). The antlers appear to have been repainted at least once, judging from areas of faded pigments. The eyes of the Underwater Spirit mimic the dot-in-circle motif, which is typically seen on the longnosed god maskettes, on the maskette earring on the figure depicted on the opposing wall, and remi- niscent of the "goggle" eyes of the Central Ameri- can rain god, Tlaloc. The eyes are surrounded by a dark mask. The mouth is opened wide, exposing a set of sharp teeth and fangs. The round head is otter- like, and rectangular forms flat against either side of the head probably indicate ear spools. A long sinu- ous snake-like body completes the figure. Under- water Spirit motifs and oral traditions were widespread among the Siouan-speaking groups; Knight (1989:206) writes that the Underwater Spirit with a snake-like body was widespread across much of eastern North America. Among the references in the ethnographic literature is one such figure, "Grandfather Snake," who represents the Missouri River, the great snake or Underwater Spirit that reared one of the Thunderer figures (Bowers 1992:286, 349). Although Missouri has no known comparable, two-dimensional graphic counterparts to this detailed face, there is a corresponding one in Tennessee asso- ciated with the late pre-contact or historic period (Faulkner 1988:239). According to Faulkner, these depictions were associated with burial caves (Faulkner 1988). Officer Cave in Tennessee contains rock art and has yielded 15 human burials. Officer cave represents one of at least two known caves with both rock art and burials (Willey et al. 1988:55). At least one burial was reported and removed from Pic- ture Cave. Finally, there have been other such depic- tions including the "Piasa" that were painted by Native Americans on a bluff above Alton, Illinois (subsequently destroyed). Along with the Alton Piasa were accompanying pictographs matching a selec- tion of the graphics in Picture Cave (McAdams 1887:22). These included a concentric circle, a large- winged bird, and two wild turkeys facing one another. It may be significant that all three sites con- taining a portrayal of the Underwater Spirit had asso- ciated burials. Brain and Phillips (1996:371) refer to the feline characteristics of the Underwater Spirits and assign</page><page sequence="8">488 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 66, No. 3, 2001] them temporarily to the A.D. 1200-1500 period. Emerson (1989:48) places the Cahokia Birger fig- urine with her feline-headed partner into the Early Stirling phase (A.D. 1050- 1100). Underwater Spirit depictions common in southeast Missouri and north- eastArkansas are sometimes refelTed to as "Cat Mon- sters" (O'Brien 1994:3). While most of these late (post-A.D. 1400) underwater spirits are three-dimen- sional, the famous Walls Engraved examples from the Berry Site in Pemiscott County, Missouri (Hath- cock 1976:146) are depicted two-dimensionally fac- ing the viewer as does the Picture Cave example. There is no doubt that water spirits, with their rat- tlesnake bodies, are connected with the cycle of death and rebirth. La Flesche (1975:368), in describing the Osage rite of reincarnation for the dead, quotes the "great snake" (in part): "Even though the little ones pass into the realms of spirits, they shall, by cling- ing to me and using my strength, recover con- sciousness." Pictograph #3. Figure 4 shows a detached bent arm with a pelt hanging over it. This drawing is one of the more enigmatic in the cave. It is on a vertical wall in a lower level of the cave separate from the other motifs described. This bent-arm motif is pre- sent in at least two other Missouri rock art sites in Missouri. The pelt hanging over the arm has a rela- tively wide tail and may represent an animal-skin medicine bag. Because the arm and pelt are in sil- houette, it is difficult to determine with any degree of certainty the animal from which the pelt may have originated. Iconographically, the bent arm is included in the realm of "shamanic" depictions. These are usually identified by a figure with one or two raised arms/hands, although they can also be represented by a single arm. Because medicine bags are associ- ated with doctors or "shamans" (medicine men and women), the arm pelt or medicine bag is almost cer- tainly symbolic of such a figure. The bent arm culminates with a hand that forms a "horned" animal, perhaps a depiction of a bison on the basis of morphology. This hand configuration is somewhat puzzling, but there is another image (Fig- ure 5) with a similar hand treatment on the upper wall section. This "bison-handed" arm might be part of a Siouan oral tradition. It may be related to the Siouan belief that all of the spirits of the animals are impris- oned inside a high hill. According to the Mandan, these animal spirits are released to become game for hunters, when proper prayers and offerings are made Icm O 1 2 3 4 Figure 5. Pictograph in Picture Cave of anthropomorph with "animal hand." to the "Hoita" or Great Speckled Eagle (Bowers 1963:113). Among the Omaha, the great-antlered Lake or Water Spirit is the chief of the animals (Fletcher and La Flesche 1992:515). It might even represent the arm of the "Old-Woman," "keeper of the deer and bison" (Bowers 1992:335).

In addi- tion to the confidence conferred by the dating of pre- viously analyzed samples, both charcoal and others, as well as the comparison of our results with archae- ological inferences for some rock paintings alluded to above and discussed in Hyman and Rowe (1 997a, 1997b), the agreement of the duplicate measure-</page><page sequence="9">REPORTS 489 Table 1.

For each sample, none of the dates is more significant than the other. The uncalibrated AMS date of A.D. 1010 for the anthro- pomorph in Pictograph #1 is early in regard to other dates for the features and iconography of this char- acter. Our date places it closer to the beginning of the Mississippian sequence, rather than within the Mississippian range of A.D. 1200 to 1500 that was expected. The concentric circle shoulder tattoos or paint, single erect plume fastened to a hair bun at the occiput and a baton, club, or mace, along with the forked or falconid eye design usually occur on South- eastern ceremonial materials during the Mississip- pian period (Muller 1989:15). The date obtained for this drawing, if unaffected by the old wood or old charcoal problems, supports the premise that Cahokia may have been responsible for the initial burst of symbolism that typifies western Mississip- pian iconography (Brown 1989:194). The Underwater Spirit motif shown in Figure 3 pro- duced an uncalibrated AMS date of A.D. 1000. In the past, there has been little to associate this motif with a particular time period other than the late prehistoric, for which a number of references have been found in the ethnographic records. O'Brien includes the mate- rials from the Berry site with the Campbell site and assigns a post-A.D. 1400 date to the Late Mississip- pian occupation at the latter (O'Brien 1994:257). As previously mentioned, Picture Cave's Underwater Spirit does not have the beard and wings that are portrayed in a few of the historic renditions. Perhaps this is because it is an earlier version of the Underwater Spirit, or simply diag- nostic of the group that created it. Jerome Jacob- son, who is currently at work on a book on the Underwater Spirit, cites various sources that sug- gest that this figure was associated with the Mis- sissippian tradition (A.D. 800-1600), possibly at different times in different areas. He points out, however, that Sampson (1988:Figures 7 and 12) has published representations of a long-tailed figure, probably the Underwater Spirit, found in Late Woodland contexts in both the Mississippi and Illi- nois river valleys in deposits dated as early as the mid-eighth century (Jerome Jacobson, personal communication, 2000). Diaz-Grana'dos (1993:326) earlier suggested an age for this motif in the uncal- ibrated A.D. range of 980 to 1050, based on refer- ences to the Underwater Spirit in the ethnographic literature and its associated diagnostic motifs. This earlier date is supported by the AMS date on this Underwater Spirit depiction. Among the few pottery fragments found on the floor of the cave was an example of St. Clair Pol- ished Plain, which is generally assigned to the Moorehead phase in Illinois atA.D. 1150-1250. This strengthens the relevance of the carbon dates reported here, assuming that the sherds have a temporal con- nection to the pictographs. Conclusion We suspect that some of the myriad of other draw- ings in Picture Cave fall into an earlier and others possibly into a later time frame. These drawings encompass everything from spirits, meat racks, pal- isades, hunting or battle scenes, a possible map, and a variety of abstract symbols. The association of rel- atively early AMS dates to complex figures (e.g., those with mace-shaped clubs, falconid eye mark- ings, patterned wrap, and the antlered Underwater Spirit) is a step forward in helping to place these icons into a prehistoric time frame for Missouri and the Midwest in general, including the Cahokia area. The proximity of Picture Cave to Cahokia and the con- fluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers adds to its significance. It seems that the naturalistic pro- files of human heads with details, similar to the Pic- ture Cave images, suggests a connection to Cahokia with its generalized Braden style (Brown 1989:196-197; Diaz-Grana'dos and Duncan 2000). It further supports Cahokia as taking a seminal role in the development of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex art and iconography. Endnote Sometime in the distant past, a section of the cave collapsed, closing in a large portion of the main pas- sage. In order to protect the pictographs and the cave's bat population, the entrance was gated during the summer of 1996. With the support of the landowner, and through private donations, the entrance was secured with a 100-pound, solid steel gate set into a two-foot thick concrete wall. The cave is on private property, and is now monitored by the landowner.</page><page sequence="11">REPORTS 491 Ackiowlvledigmets. A version of this paper, and its associated AMS dates, was first presented in a symposiumn at the annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology in Chicago, Illinois, March 24-28, 1999. Partial support for this research was provided through grants from the Monsanto Company, the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (Texas A&amp;M University), the Cave Research Foundation, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Washington University. Special thanks to Patty Jo Watson, Department of Anthropology, Washington University, for her ongoing assistance on this cave research and for her suggestions on an earlier draft. I am also grateful to David L. Browman for reviewing the manuscript, the radiocarbon determinations, and for his suggestions on an ear- lier draft. James A. Brown was particularly helpful in explaining his ideas on the origins of the Braden Style. William Haynes, Analytical Research Department, Chemical Division, Monsanto Company, St. Louis, was instrLImental and most helpful in the process required to obtain a research grant to carry out this pro- ject. We appreciated the constrLIctive comments of James Keyser, two anonymous reviewers, and the editor, Timothy A. Kohler. To the owner of Picture Cave, who wishes to remain anonymous, we are deeply indebted for both his cooperation and friendship. I am grateful to Gaby Katz Fleischmann who kindly translated our abstract and title into Spanish. R. A. Armitage and R. Robbins conducted the plasma-chemical extractions at Texas A&amp;M University. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the dates were obtained, is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract W-7405-Eng-48.
