Though some bower-birds are brilliantly colored or ornamented, it is in behavior that this family of some 18 species of the Australia-New Guinea area is specialized. This behavior results in the building of mating stations, known as "bowers," decorated with leaves, flowers, stones, etc. This contrasts with the simpler mating behavior of the bower birds' near relatives, the crows, and the elaborate plumage adornment and physical dis- plays of their other near relatives, the birds of paradise. Marshall's book falls naturally into three parts: (a) birds' breeding seasons in genera], (b) the bower birds, and (e) discussion of bowers. In the first section, Marshall sketches the physical (neuro-endocrinal) basis for external factors influencing time of breeding, and the refractory period that would produce a rhythm without external controls. He examines a wide selection of breeding seasons that indicate not only that some external factors must be timing them but also that no one external factor can be operative in regulating them all. He stresses the very pertinent point that it is not the time of the inception of gonadal growth that is so important to the bird, but rather the time of ripening. (In some north-temperate birds the former may start in the autumn and be interrupted by winter.) This ripening varies from species to species, and from place to place, and is what, through natural selection, has ensured breeding at a time most likely to be successful. The theory of breeding seasons based</page><page sequence="2">Jvol, No.2 ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 151 primarily on internal rhythms and, secondarily, on various external factors, including light, temperature, rainfall, food supply, and the activities of other birds of the same or other species (as with parasitic cuckoos), that may act in combination, is a welcome anti- dote to the views of those who, disregarding part of the evidence, would have one single simple factor, such as light, in control. The account of each species opens with a general description of the bird and its range, then its breeding behavior and display, where known. The impression left by this section is how much is yet to be learned about bower-birds. For instance, the locality where one New Guinea species was taken is unknown; of another species we know, besides the description of the skins, only the locality whence the specimens cane. The behavior of only one species is fairly well known, the Satin Bower-bird, (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus) in which the male makes an elaborate, avenue-like bower, the walls of which are orienta- ted at right angles to the sun's course in the heavens, and which the bird paints, and in front of which it arranges selected objects of certain colors as "decoration." Here the male stations himself and is noisy long before the female is ready to mate. Finally the female visits the bower and is displayed to by the male, which uses the decorations from in front of the bower in his display. Copulation has not been observed at the bower, but probably occurs there, as it does in another species, the Spotted Bower-bird (Chlamydera maculata). The male apparently has no associations with the female away from the bower during nesting time; she builds a saucer-shaped nest and rears her young alone. After breeding, flocks of adults and youing of both sexes are formed. At the other extreme Cat- birds (Ailuroedus) apparently are monogamous, have no special display, and the male takes part in some nest duties. The discussion points out that the bower represents a localizing or focusing of the territory-holding behavior, the favorite song perch, the song and display of passerine birds in general. Its nearest approach is in cleared display areas of certain birds of paradise, and the mound which the lyre bird scrapes together. Now, as specifically distinct as each species' pltumage, the bower presumably is an adjtinct to display in promoting copulation. The bower building, Marshall thinks, arose out of a displaced nest-building drive of the male, and bower painting out of displaced courtship feeding. Marshall correlates the selected colors of the decoration objects with colors of the female or rival males, rejecting an earlier theory that the round objects used as decoration were to suggest eggs to the female and stimulate her to egg laying. Both of those views sound as if they came from a psychoanalyst's couch. Dangerous as it is to theorize on scant data, some further suggestions and comparisons emerge. Marshall seems to think monogamous pairing is the rule in this family, but, as only the "primitive" Catbird (Ailuroedus) is known to help at the nest, it is possible that in some species the bower is the mating station to which any female may come, as in some other birds with small display grounds. The possibility that construction, repair, decorating and renovating of the bower may play a part in keeping the male bird oc- cupied and "tied" to his mating station, rather than serving as a bond between the sexes should not be disregarded. The use of a tool (a wad of material) by the Satin Bower-bird in painting its bower is one of the few instances of its sort among birds, recalling the Galapagos finch that uses a twig-probe to get at insects in crevices, and the anvil of the thrush for breaking snails. The north-south orientation of bowers of some species is the one positive case of its sort in birds, though it ocecurs in other animals, and it recalls the recent work in- dicating that homing may be oriented by uising the sun in direction finding.</page><page sequence="3">152 THE WILSON BULLETIN June, 1955 V oi. 67, No. 2 Suich concrete expressions of behavior as bowers are excellent objects to arrange in series from simple to complex. From the "primitive" catbird without a bower, through the Toothed Catbird (Scenopoeetes dentirostris) with a cleared area decorated with green leaves and the Black Bower-bird (Archboldia papniensis) with a cleared area on which dead vegetation is placed, two lines are apparent: one, the saucer-shaped area with a central decorated "maypole" leading to the covered hut and nearby "garden" (Amblyornis, the Gardener Bower-bird), and the other, in which two rows of twigs are erected into an "avenue." Marshall, on this basis, makes the catbirds a family (Ailuroe- didae) separate from the bower-birds, despite the fact that the evidence he presents on the Toothed Catbird is perhaps the best evidence we have that links the catbirds to the bower-birds. Further, as Stresemann has shown, they agree with the "maypole" builders in laying a plain egg, not heavily marked as with the "avenue" builders. A tendency to fight anthropomorphism, that prevails the book is understandable when one considers the twaddle that has been written about the intelligence of these birds. But the conclusion that an aesthetic appreciation, a satisfaction given by contemplation of arrangements and colors, does not exist is better ruled out by definition rather than fact. The illustrations are photographs of the birds, their bowers, and habitats, and micro- photographs of gonadal tissues; the figures sketches of bowers, the heads of some species, and maps of ranges.-A.
