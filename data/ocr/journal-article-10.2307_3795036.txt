<plain_text><page sequence="1">INDIAN SCULPTURE NEWLY ACQUIRED By STELLA KRAMRISCH Curator of Indian Art A group of Indian stone sculptures in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, an anonymous loan since 1950, has recently been pur- chased by the Museum. The carvings rep- resent about fifteen hundred years of Indian sculpture and are the work of various schools. The acquisition of this collection places the Museum in the forefront in this field. To Dr. W. Norman Bran the Mu- seum is indebted for his successful efforts leading to the original showing of the col- lection and its ultimate acquisition. Indian sculptures, as a rule, are part of a comprehensive conception which is laid out in architectural terms and is given ex- position by images. The forty-nine stone carvings recently acquired by the Museum originally belonged to structures full of meaning and definite religious function. Time and decay, neglect and wars brought damage and destruction to many of these monuments. Though broken and scattered, their impact survives in some of their fragments. They hold and communi- cate the power that brought the images into existence together with the total monu- ment. The power vested in the monument was present in all its parts. The entire sur- face was charged with meaning. It is this which organizes its form and concentrates the impact once and again in those few masterworks where immediate intuition has seized the total realization. It is then that a particular image shines forth infused with illuminating intensity and imparts, even though it is severed from its original context, the essential impact. The collection of sculptures in the Phila- delphia Museum of Art consists of carvings of this degree of impelling quality. As works of art they are representative of Indian form, particularly of the northern part of India, in several main phases, from the second century B. C. to the middle of the second millennium A. D. Wide diver- gencies of style show some of the many possibilities in which the creative matrix of Indian form moulded again and again the magma of its elements. In this fluid magma the elements keep on changing position. While some rise others sink. Incidentally also elements from outside enter the stream, are borne along and absorbed by the main current. The elements are contributed by the experience of life as part of nature as well as within the given human situation and furthermore by the awareness of this experience within one's body and together with the livingnesss of that body. These elements moreover are subsumed to those which are contributed by religious realiza- tion and practice, and they play their part in vision and design and in the kind of stim- ulation which stone and clay, wood and metal and the contact with his tools give to the sculptor. These elements are the substance, as yet without form, of the work to be; they are pre-creative, in readiness for the creative act which takes place within the matrix of Indian form when the artist conceives and gives shape to his work. The mould of Indian form is plastic in its nature and its pulse absorbs in various rhythms of its own the fluid magma which is held, bound, and impressed by the form. Two judgments of Indian sculpture as pronounced by Western critics are widely accepted. The first is provoked by Indian iconography and ritual and looks at a piece of Indian sculpture as an illustration of the one or an adjunct of the other. From neither of these aspects is it rightly measured as a work of art. Or else-this being another variety of the first approach-defeat is ad- 31</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1.

This approach resignedly halts at a distance from the work of art and feeds on the pastures of stylistic analysis, chron- ology and archaeology. The second kind of judgment, however, finds itself more richly rewarded by an imputed sensuousness of Indian sculpture as a whole and by that of its female shapes in particular. Both these judgments say nothing about Indian sculpture as art, that is, as created form. The first type of judg- ment reflects a just aversion to mechaniza- tion which ritual when bereft of a living tradition invariably suffers. This judgment moreover reflects a deeper seated aversion to religion and metaphysics particularly at the heights which they have scaled in India. Western expressionists and rationalists alike, as also the sensualists, meet in their approach to Indian sculpture their own attitudes and apprehensions, born of their unpreparedness for the elements of the Indian life experience and religious realiza- tion which the form and even the mere fact of the existence of the sculptures presup- poses. The specific Indian attitudes and contents and their cognate sensibility, as also the materials and tools, the qualities of all these and their degrees-Brahman, the Supreme Principle, Kama, Desire, the sacred number four which connotes this manifest universe in its extensiveness, the coming of the Monsoon rains, the feel of the stone- the relation of all of these, their tensions, associations, conflicts, and merging in the sculpture to be, the touch of the chisel, the concentration of the artist after having worshipped his tools in a quiet place prior to beginning his work, and the total fact of his own person-these all and infinitely more elements have entered the magma to be moulded in the Form. The form itself is autonomous. The imponderable wealth of elements is absorbed in the creative proc- ess. Indian sculpture as form, i.e., as work of art, is neither metaphysical nor sensuous, although both these qualities are fused and transformed in the creative process, to- gether with the other categories, data and actions. Compacted, interpenetrating and made coherent in the fervent process of "taking form", they become clarified in the imponderable balance which makes the quality of a work of art. The sculptures in the Philadelphia Mu- seum of Art represent Indian artistic qual- ity. It is communicated to all those who, knowing creative form, see them. Form is known as immediately as one knows Truth. The number of those able to discern and respond to Form, however, is smaller in our present civilization than of those who recognize Truth. 32</page><page sequence="4">In the vast output of sculptures in India, however, not all the carvings have the same degree of intense clarity of form. Where the impact is less strong and the inner co- herence of the single work weaker, these deficiences are obvious when the images and fragments are seen by themselves, de- tached from their original locations. In place, at the spot for which the images were made, their shortcomings recede into the context of the total monument. This is due to their function in the overall pattern. Its design carries them and while it lends them its own impact they in turn, by virtue of their position and proportionate extent, enhance the articulation of the whole. The whole is a configuration in space and is of monumental proporations. In the centuries around the beginning of the pres- ent era the configurations of which Fig. 2 was part in the second century B. C. or also Fig. 3, in the second century A.D. com- prised a central solid mass, a hemisphere on a plinth, the Stupa, the main and most sacred monument of Buddhism and also of Jainism. It embodies the meaning of Total Release, freedom from bondage, and is a symbol of the universe, conceived in terms of this ordinance, brought about by the teaching of the Buddha, the "Awakened One", or the Jina, the "Conqueror". The second component in this monumental con- figuration in space is an open air ambula- tory which is fenced off from the outer surroundings by a railing. The ambulatory and railing are the architectural shapes of the rite of circumambulation (pradaksina). Symbolic, monumental shape and the rite by which it is worshipped, or known by active participation in its meaning, are the conjoint theme of the configuration Stupa (the central volume) with its railing. This theme is laid out in space. The plan is circular, around the immovable centre the devotee moves once, or several times, or as many as one hundred and eight times; with the Stupa, the central monument on his right, he walks sun-wise encompassing the Stupa when performing "pradaksina" inside the railing, and he also performs the same rite in a wider circle outside the rail- ing. This railing, as far as Figs. 1 and 2 are concerned, is of stone, though the posts, transverse beams and coping stone are joined like carpentry. The theme and func- tion of the railing are to ward off the dis- tractions or "evil influences" of the outer world and to delimit the sacred precinct around the Stupa. This function makes the static balance of its architectural shape. Between railing and the Stupa, wide arcs are created whose tension is held firmly between the curved and inclined planes of the dome shape of the Stupa and the verti- cal ring of the railing. Within it, and also outside it as its outer perimeter, the en- circling movement of the rite, the double perambulation takes place after the monu- Figure 3. WORSHIPPING FEMALE FIGURE. Sandstone.

Dwarf-like child attendants, the female on the right upholding a musical instrument (vina). ment has been approached and the railing entered at the one or at one of the four cardinal gate-openings. The architectural-ritual theme of the monument is given fuller exposition by the carvings on posts, beams and coping stone of the railing. Showing scenes in low relief or larger single figures, each of them refer- ring in "literary" content to the central monument, artistically the reliefs not only enhance the architectural elements on which they are carved by the contrast of their richer texture against the plain surface but they attract the eye of the devotee, while he approaches, or walks around, the monument. The mode of seeing them is one of direct approach where their total impact is felt, or an encircling one, where the linear movement of the single figure or composition is seen to swing with the ritual movement, and their curves and rhythms are measured against it. To the sculptor the carving of the railing set a threefold task: the exposition of the meaning of the central symbol, the Stupa. This was achieved by carvings in relief, some of which were symbolic configura- tions, others narrative groups and still others single images. All of them received their impact from and referred to the centre. The second task was the coordina- tion of these compositions on the circular and perforated surfaces of the railing. Their interknit accents facing inward, facing out- ward were meant to arrest the eye on each face yet leading the eye from one to the other. Centrifugal with reference to the Stupa in which they have their central meaning whence the carvings derive their impact, each of these carvings finally is a self- sufficient composition within its frame or allotted surface. Each single composition shows the solution of its own problems of visualization, within the given frame while also meeting the demand of being viewed during an encircling movement. Charged 34</page><page sequence="6">with these several directional powers, from and around the center, communicated by the architectural plan and the structural masses and received by the eye of the on- looker approaching, halting and encircling, the form of the single relief, in varying degrees of the craftsman's competence, holds and dispenses all these powers. Kinetic in their static appearance, the plastic shapes, as if embossed by move- ment, are rounded off against the ground of the relief. The depth of the relief, and the arc of the curves of the linear compo- sition vary with schools and periods (Figs. 2 and 6). So does the appearance of the figures. The human shape in Indian sculp- ture is based on actual appearance inasmuch as the Indian physique is less muscular and more supple than that of Western people. This natural characteristic conforms with the lineaments of the creative mould and is embedded in its resilient curves and vi- brating modelling. Vibrating modelling of which every profile is a resilient curve and a concatenation of such curves of different tensions, is a primary quality of Indian sculpture. In this quality, the living breath is vested, the movement of breathing and the movement of the sap circulating in the body. Their conjoint rhythms, together with their assurance, their visual confirma- tion that life is translated into sculpture, have been felt and faced by the awareness of the sculptor, and shaped by his hand. By the entire organization of the relief in surface and in the three dimensions, the creative accents, pauses and transitions are carried in the flowing waves of curves; these are further elaborated by the ac- countable as well as imponderable accents of time and place, climate of season and soul and by the conventions in which In- dian sculpture accounts for, and labels, its identity. One of these conventions is the ideal of apparent nakedness-though a garment cov- ers the body. The presence of the garment Figure 5. SERPENT DIVINITIES (NAGA AND NAGINI). Basalt.

Kiradu, Rajasthan, 11th century. is indicated by the raised border or hem of the garment (Figs. 1 and 3), and also by incised rippling lines (Fig. 4). But for these indications of garment-which only strengthen the rounded appearance of the limbs-the figures might as well be naked, whereas on the other hand drapery sur- rounding or girdling the body is massed together in shapes as ornamental as those of the jewelry (Figs. 3, 4, 6). Either of these accoutrements supplies the means for a compositional counterpoint to enhance the naked body (Figs. 1, 6). If female, the convention of over-large breasts and hips conveys, together with their sensuousness, the stone-age-old reverence for woman, as the potential mother. Conventions like these are coinage which receives its value only within and together with the creative form. It is not a question of greater or lesser de- gree of sensuousness in the capricious and elegant abundance of the female shape to- gether with her tree (Fig. 4) or in the calm of the serpent goddess in the arms of her partner (Fig. 5), or in curve and model- ling of back and buttocks of the sturdy warrior-like male attendant figure (Fig. 6), or in the shape of the "tree" of which the goddess is an exponent (Fig. 4), or in the serpent hoods with their half-human divini- ties (Fig. 5), but of the special artistic cast these shapes have and of the realization whence they derive just this specific shape. In each of these carvings any single trait, be it garland, hip or head, tree or serpent, overcomes its connotation in the creative impact that shapes it. This is not a preroga- tive of Indian sculpture but of all art. Sensuousness is one of the qualities in the magma which is cast in the mould of creative form. Sex also, as a theme, goes into the magma and in the work of art it yields. In Fig. 3, for instance, the accen- tuated spherical triangle is below the waist- belt of the worshipping figure whose arm, bent in the gesture of worship (anjali mudra), is the major triangle in this com- position. Together they give shape to the shift of movement, the turn around the vertical axis of the figure in the absorption of, and elevation by, her offering while at the same time they hold between them the vessel of her body cinctured by a fourfold chain of beads. Indian sculpture is neither sensuous nor is it anthropomorphic in spite of most of its figures resembling the shape of man. This shape floats in the pre-creative image. Its insistence is part of sculpture, extended in space as is the body of man, the body of the sculptor, and even the locus where creative intuition demands form by his hand. In Indian sculpture, though the shape resembles that of man it does not represent man in his mortal frame and aspect. The figures are those of divinities. Where, in relatively rare instances portraits were in- tended, they are likenesses of the divine prototype with but little modification. This 36</page><page sequence="8">accounts, for example, for the uncertainty in front of some South Indian metal images whether they were meant to represent a goddess or a queen. Indian sculpture does not give an ideal- ized image abstracted from the physical body of man. In terms all its own it creates the shape of man's "subtle body" (suksma sarira). The "subtle body", according to Indian notion, invisibly inheres the physical body of which it is and holds the vital movement, the breath, and emotions and also the forces by which the physical body loses its weight, knows how to dance and aspires to soar. This inherent "subtle body" which in nature is scaffolded by bones and overlaid with flesh is freed from these mortal encumbrances by imagina- tion and is built by art of the energies that shape its form. While it is not meant to function as does the body of man it also does not represent this body but makes consistently present, and concrete to the eye, an emotive-expressive form that seems to breathe and to soar, heavy as is the stone and voluminous as is the cast of the sculptures in the amplitude of their being. The "subtle body" is said to be that of the gods. Were it not for its form made by art the gods would not ever have become visi- ble on earth. It is not with anthropomor- phic but with celestial figures that Indian sculpture is replete. However this does not hold good to the same degree of all the phases and schools. The head of an image of the Guardian of the Southwest, Nir- riti, the god of Decomposition and De- cay, from Khajuraho, 11th century A. D., (Fig. 7), is as far removed from the coun- tenance of an attendant divinity from Mathura (Fig. 3) as approximately nine centuries would warrant. Not before the fourth century A. D. and not after the 13th century is the visage altogether vibrant in curves and planes expressive of phases of transmundane intellectual states of being yet steeped in sentient form. Transcending knowledge in India transforms not only the outlook but the entire life of the total hu- man being. In art, the transcendental com- ponent saturates and transubstantiates the sensuous substratum in its abundance and acuteness. Thus Indian art is never "ab- stract". Its paradoxically complex and comprehensive form is a symbol pregnant with values which appear incompatible to the Western mind. The later Buddhist doc- trine of the nonduality of Nirvana and Samsara, of the transcendental absolute and this phenomenal world, is one verbal equiv- alent of the form of Indian sculpture. Furthermore, where the Western spec- tator would see the sensuous element only (Fig. 6) and be unaware at the same time that he confronts traditional formulas with their thematic reference to the bounteous All-mother, source of all that is, unaware moreover of the other thematic as well as formal statement in which woman and tree are one conceptual acknowledgment of vegetative life in its multiform vessels: tree and scroll, woman, child and artistic form -the full content of this sculpture would Figure 7.

A Boucher-like Rococo "enhanchement" (tribhanga) graces this Dryad, but its curve is much more insistent and makes the figure sway in its entirety. In its pervasiveness the bent attitude is like the movement that sweeps through a Gothic Madonna but differs inasmuch as the Gothic curve transcends the figure through which it passes while the Indian curve like the cascade of a fountain returns to its ori- gin and source. Here it is an image of a goddess who raises her arms which meet where the stem of the tree emerges above her shoulder, to form her halo and canopy. Her movement is extended and her raised arm resembles as much the stem of the sheltering tree as the curves of its flowers do those of her lips and brow; this alter ego, the top of the tree, bends down in the same curves of fulfilment which give to her face the compassionate smile of sadness. Her brows rise high soaring above the con- templation of life that surges and sinks and surges in indefinite succession symbolized by the rippling waves of her body and her raiment. This relief (Fig. 4) as also the fragments of larger images in high relief (Figs. 6, 8) were part of the walls of temples. The en- tire wall surface of such Hindu and also Jain temples (fifth to fifteenth century A. D.) was a three-dimensional iconostasis. It projected in buttresses and they were decked with images on three of their faces so that the entire bulwark of the temple, while giving a sculptural exposition of its meaning, carried forward its total signifi- cance in an indefinite number of images, each at its appointed place. [This aspect has been fully dealt with and illustrated in Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple (2 vols.), Calcutta University Press, 1946.] The propulsion of sculpture from the cen- tre of the monument as adumbrated in the earlier work of the Stupas, reaches its full power on the walls of the later temples with their projections and recesses set with images (Figs. 1, 4). The majority of the sculptures in the recently acquired collection were part of the walls of temples through the breadth of the country, from Rajasthan on the West, to Orissa in the East. Marginal schools like that of Chamba in the Western Himalaya are also represented. The last phase of creative sculpture in stone is also included in the collection and is here illustrated by a symbol, carved in the round, a Siva Linga with faces in the four directions (Fig. 8). It originally was the central image in a shrine. The stylization, whereby the rich plastic content of the sculpture of the pre- ceding centuries has become reduced to a clearcut and rational design, is as direct as is the symbolism of number. These have here taken the place of the once inexhausti- ble wealth and meaning of plastic form. Figure 8. FOUR-FACED (CATURMUKHA) SIVA LINGA. White marble.
