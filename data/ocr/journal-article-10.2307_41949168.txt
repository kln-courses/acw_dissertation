The intimacy and immediacy of shared spontaneous storymaking between an adult and child provided fertile ground for developing the skills of both play partners. In part, this paper is an exercise in linking storytelling to educational research in the early-years field; however, it is also a reflective exercise following a child and adult as they learn and unlearn the forms of stories, and their own imaginations, through the challenges and delights of shared storymaking. We consciously and unconsciously fill children's lives with stories - of themselves and their families, of things and how they work, of fantastical creatures and places, and of children and adults alike and unlike them and us. What is more, they learn remarkably quickly to tell us stories: from the two-year-old repeating significant past events to the five-year-old expertly employing story customs of his culture. In The Stories Children Tell , Engel writes: As with language learning itself, research has shown that a great deal of parental input and shaping contributes to the child developing the capacity for storytelling. Children's narrative style and ability reflect individual, familial, and community values and ways of telling. (15-16) This article contains the tale of how one child's imaginative storytelling capacity developed between the ages of two and five within a specific family context. However, it is also the tale of two people learning to be storytellers, a child and adult, through shared imaginative work and dialogue. It is, therefore, a tale of lifelong learning. A TALE OF MANY STORIES I like telling stories, and I do a lot of it, so here is another one. It starts with a two-year-old boy named Noah, his Aunty Juliette (me), and Noah's new imaginary best friend, Pip. I had gone round to my sister's place for a break from study and, while playing with Noah, I received my first instruction to "tell a Pip story." Pip was a puppy who got into all sorts of predicaments, such as losing bones he had buried, flying off attached to balloons, or getting stuck in the holes he Address correspondence to Juliette Smeed, New Zealand Tertiary College, 1 Marewa Road, Auckland 1051, New Zealand.

He soon acquired a best friend, Prickles the hedgehog, who lived under the back deck, and together they would dig holes in silly places and fall into them, throw each other birthday parties, fly to the moon, or attempt bumbling raids on butcher shops. Popular predicaments were repeated over and over again in many storytelling sessions, with enough variation to keep the teller engaged. These simple stories fit with definitions of narrative that have been made in the context of children's storytelling, such as Marjanovic-Umek, Dranjc and Kekonja's statement that "any narrative has to be structured with a beginning, a middle, and a conclusion, and it has to contain a problem" (3); or Egan' s claim that stories "are narrative units that can fix the affective meaning of the elements that compose them" ( Cognitive Tools 10). Actually, I cannot remember much of what Pip did. What I will never forget is the look of wonder in Noah's eyes as I told that first Pip story: I swear they grew bigger and bigger as the story progressed. It reminded me that storytelling has been described by Engel as "perhaps the most powerful way that human beings organize experience" 0 Emergence of Storytelling 3). Aged two, Noah was as fully alive to the powerful magic in stories as Aladdin was to the powerful magic within his lamp. I would watch Noah grow mesmerized by whatever enchantment he had called forth from that bottomless vessel, his storyteller, and it almost felt possible to see his imagination growing in front of me. Noah is at school now (like most New Zealand children, he started school after his fifth birth- day), and I have told hundreds, even thousands, of stories since then. Pip no longer features, although he had a very long run of well over 18 months. Not long after Noah turned three, he moved half an hour's drive away, and it seemed likely that our close storytelling relationship would end. However, Pip stories made a surprisingly easy transition to the telephone, and sev- eral times I week I would get called up to "do my duty" (as it is termed in the family), most commonly in the evening as an alternative to the traditional bedtime story. As time went on, Pip stories evolved from simple tales of slapstick buffoonery and friendship to convoluted adventures on strange islands, in the caves of hibernating bears, or on the ships of marauding pirates on the seven seas. When Noah became fascinated with pirates, Pip became a pirate dog with first mate Prickles and their new friend Captain Wizard. They sailed the seven seas alongside an ever-growing cast of pillaging pirates: Jolly Roger, Terrible Fergus, Black Jack, Orange Ruffee, Red Robin, Long John Silver, Princess Ruby, Lady Annabel - and the list goes on. I lost track of my own creation and became reliant on Noah's superior memory to put the right pirates in the right ships and to keep track of the changing relations among them. I was regularly at sea, and sometimes I was not making much sense, but Noah never minded. He would sit at the end of the telephone in complete silence for half an hour or more at a stretch, only speaking to correct an error (spotted from a previous story) or occasionally ask what a word meant - and then to demand the next story. Stories became more elaborate and longer. One was never enough; three became the norm and, with calls often lasting more than an hour, storytelling became burdensome around the same time Noah developed a sense of entitlement that made him stroppy when the stories were over. I would be threatened with the withdrawal of his love and friendship if I did not keep telling stories. Finally, Noah's mum intervened to set some limits for our mutual benefit. To this day I do not know what Noah's story limit is because I have never reached it, and the end of every call is negotiated down to the last minute of story time. We established an opening routine: every story started with my question, "Who do you want in it," and Noah's right to decide. This ensured that Noah's current interests were central and</page><page sequence="3">FROM STORYTELLING TO STORYMAKING 3 provided a necessary kick start for my imagination. Eventually, other pirates - goodies and baddies - began stepping in and out of leading roles and Pip's prominence faded. Dragons first appeared as suitable antagonists for Pirates because of their shared interest in gold; mermaids appeared on the same basis. Noah and I together had created an imaginative world, or virtual play environment, that had a cohesive (though every expanding) geography and established relations. Then Noah started watching TV and, to my mortification, I began getting requests for stories with "Batman." But how could Batman adventure alongside Jolly Roger, Terrible Fergus, and Pip the pirate dog on the Seven Seas? I literally could not imagine it. Batman was the first indication of the genre limits on my powers of invention, and of how deeply invested I had become in crafting stories that satisfied my own narrative desires. When Noah was three, going on four, a revolution took place in our storytelling sessions. Whereas previously he had sat in rapt silence for long periods, Noah began interrupting more and more frequently with questions and suggestions. Eventually, I worked out that he could not keep quiet any longer because he needed to help tell the story; moreover, he needed to be part of the story and to have a determining role in the unfolding dramatic action. We invented a new storytelling genre we call "games" where we co-create the stories. Most commonly this is done over the phone by acting out scenes using character dialogue, bouncing off, extending and/or rejecting each other's contributions. It is something we have both had to learn how to do, and at times it has been a wild ride. A "Pip story" is the term we still use for any story made up by an adult that is about any characters; a "game" is a story that is co-constructed between Noah and me. In this article I will mostly refer to our "games" as "storymaking" (as opposed to storytelling) as our use of the word "game" is idiosyncratic. But what of the Grumpy Dragon? Dragons had featured in our games for some time as a foil for pirates and as powerful protagonists in their own right, but although they were growing favorites there was no dominant character among them until the Grumpy Dragon. He came into being during a game we played in Noah's bedroom one night before he went to bed. Something about the action of hiding under the bedclothes as a grumpy dragon and being coaxed out of his "cave" to go on rescue missions with Batman was deeply appealing to Noah's imagination. The Grumpy Dragon was born. Later, I invented the Angry Dragon to get out of being Batman or Robin all the time. For more than a year now, Noah and I have played games that begin with the opening routine: Noah: "Shall we play a game now?" Juliette: "Sure." Noah: "I'll be the Grumpy Dragon." Juliette: "I'll be the Angry Dragon." Although I choose the role of the Angry Dragon at the beginning of the game, I can be anything from 5 to 20 other characters in a single story, usually repeated characters such as Esmeralda the witch, Ben Ten, Long John Silver, or Poison Ivy. This ability to be polymorphous is probably one of the greatest attractions that I (and other storytelling adults) hold for Noah. Because other characters most commonly appear in sequence, in dialogue and action with the Grumpy Dragon, moments of confusion are surprisingly rare. In the past couple of months, Noah (age 5.4) has filled in a few deliberate pauses with the voices of other characters, but he has only managed a comment or two before requesting that I take over.</page><page sequence="4">4 SMEED If I were a scientist like Piaget, I would have kept better track of the timeframe covering the development of Noah's powers to spontaneously invent story elements. Early on in our "games" it was my job to imagine what would happen next: to introduce new characters or reintroduce known ones, to shift the action to new locations and design them, and insert objects of interest into the plot. Noah learned how to create further action by prompting my powers of invention. So, for example, when he wished to change the plot, our phone conversations would run something like this: Noah: "Oh my goodness, look at that!" Juliette: "What?" Noah: "Look! There!" Juliette: "Oh no, there's a hole in the wall and your most precious pieces of gold are missing." If Noah accepted the new set-up, which was not always the case, then the action that followed would be negotiated through dialogue between characters and verbalization of actions. Then, dur- ing his fourth year (and it seemed very rapidly), Noah was able the take on more and more of the creative story work of invention and elaboration. With increasing frequency he began sponta- neously introducing plot elements from previous stories or other stories he had read or heard. He developed preferences for particular plots - gold hunts, robberies, battles, parenting scenarios, rescues, destroying and rebuilding things - and his growing ability to articulate his imagination meant he could circumvent my elaborately staged quest plots and assert his story appetite for constant action and reaction. As my creative lead in our stories diminished, they became more episodic and less cohesive. Nowadays, Noah is just as likely as I am to face the all-important question: "Oh no! What shall we do?" "I know," one of us will say, and we are off again. We may even argue over which course of action to take. In addition to a large back catalogue of parapher- nalia (e.g., events, locations, objects, characters) from previous stories, Noah can now conjure things into being during storymaking simply by imagining them, things such as sea monsters that are made up of thousands of people or people who live inside his stomach, both of which recently appeared in our games. After years of making stories together, listening to Noah invent characters, things and scenarios feels like nothing less than witnessing a powerful alchemy at work. STORYMAKING IN THE CONTEXT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION Background Even though my academic background has largely focused on the study of literature, I have spent the last three years teaching research skills to early childhood student teachers. In the rest of this article I will be linking my storymaking relationship with Noah to the socioculturally influenced learning pedagogies that inform the early childhood education sector in New Zealand as well as recent early childhood research on stories. Within the early childhood sector, there is much support for the view that learning and development occur in the relationship between child and society or a cultural community (Fleer 8), and that play as a "social symbolic experience" (Dockett and Fleer 63) is a "leading factor" in that development (Vygotsky 101).</page><page sequence="5">FROM STORYTELLING TO STORYMAKING 5 The practice of empowering children's voices and developing their skills through storytelling has also gained momentum in early childhood education. One influential practice is the two- stage storytelling/story-acting process described in the ethnographic accounts of Vivian Paley and taken up by many early childhood practitioners and researchers (e.g., Nicolopoulou et al.; Wright et al.). Created for the classroom, the storytelling/story acting process involves the adult as a facilitator of children's storytelling, first as a transcriber of individual children's stories and second as a narrator and director of subsequent peer dramatizations (Paley 5-6). An alternative, more teacher-directed approach to storytelling and acting is described in a Centres of Innovation (COI) research project on central-character stories. Using a central char- acter, costumes, and props, children enact personal stories or stories from home; however, the teachers make deliberate choices over which of children's interests to follow and direct the story action so that it links to values and themes they have chosen to prioritize (Smith, Henson, and Mayo 8-10). While my storymaking relationship with Noah does not occur within a cen- ter or classroom context and therefore is contextually different, it also differs from both these approaches in the use of imaginative interplay between adult and child as the means of creating stories. In New Zealand the early childhood curriculum framework, Te Whäriki (Ministry of Education [MoE]) has been significantly shaped by sociocultural theories (Ritchie 2). The foreword of Te Whäriki states: "The importance of the social context within which children are cared for and learning takes place is one of the foundation stones of the curriculum" (MoE 7). Te Whäriki is designed with "principles" and "strands" that weave together to form a holistic curriculum framework ("te whäriki" is Mäori for "the woven mat"). The strong focus on relationships and connections exists alongside a strong focus on exploration and empowerment through play-based learning. The pedagogical approach of play-based learning has a long history in New Zealand (May 177-88). A 2007 research project by White et al. discovered four "play discourses" that shape beliefs and values of play in contemporary New Zealand: "play as a professionalized process," "play as freedom of expression," "play as a game for life" (for learning life skills), and "play as a rite of passage" (to participation in culture and society) (97). I am aware that all of these discourses inform the analysis of my "game playing" relationship with Noah, which has shifted from that of storyteller and audience to a relationship of "play partners" (Dunkin and Hanna 18) in the move from storytelling to shared storymaking. For example, my concern with enabling Noah's voice and imagination is influenced by the discourse of "play as freedom of expression," which is linked to nostalgia and personal/family values (White et al. 98), while my interest in "play as a game for life" is evident in my concern for Noah's social and emotional development. According to Egan ("Start" 444), imagination is "the hard working core of children's thinking," a statement that perfectly encapsulates Noah between the ages of two and five. My knowledge of what things are "really" like is only one resource for our stories, and gen- erally it gives way to the greater power of what Noah and I can imagine. Nevertheless, I can recognize some traditional knowledge/skill acquisition that has occurred through storymaking. For example, I take some credit for the development of Noah's math skills simply because I have been amazed at the number of opportunities there are for spontaneously rehearsing num- ber concepts in stories. We have negotiated the relative size of pirate ships and crew numbers, added and subtracted all manner of things, counted backwards to numerous dynamite explo- sions, and weighed and measured everything from gold to baby dragons. In addition, sequences</page><page sequence="6">6 SMEED and patterns regularly occur in plots that have repeat elements. Noah's number terminology has always been in advance of his understanding of discrete number-based concepts such as length, weight, size, value, age, etc.; however, his delight in the powerful defining quality of math's language has made it a favorite "toy" or play artefact. Along the way, Noah has shown good devel- opment in his understanding of math concepts that bodes well for his future studies. Leading early childhood advocates argue for developing children's subject-based knowledge through a richly resourced environment for play and exploration rather than through specific task-based instruc- tion. According to the influential philosophy of Reggio Emilia, the teacher's role is not one of instructing, but seeking "to extend the children's stamina and attention span, increase their range of techniques and strategies, enhance their concentration and effort and still allow them to fully experience pleasure and joy in the game" (Edwards 182). STORYMAKING AND THE CHILD'S VOICE My relationship with Noah does not fit easily into the pedagogical roles traditionally associated with adult and child; therefore, any link to the discourse of "play as a professionalized process" (White et al. 97) is more problematic. I am first and foremost Noah's aunty and best friend, and we are entertaining and delighting each other with the stories we co-create. Nevertheless, my knowledge of early childhood research and my teaching profession means that I often have another "self' that sits on my shoulder during storymaking sessions, or afterwards in reflective moments, and recognizes the significance of the learning that has occurred while Noah and I work out specific plots or through the development of our storymaking over time. I recognize, for example, that a primary aim of our storymaking is to follow Noah's interests and empower his voice, two current concerns in early childhood education research and practice. I know that children's views are always subject to adult interpretations (Bronfenbrenner cited Samuelsson 1), and I am very well aware that my facilitation of Noah's imaginative development is not neutral or random (which I discuss in more detail later in this article). I am also aware that Noah's interest in talking animals, dragons, pirates, and superheroes has followed recognizable popular and gender-specific trends. Nevertheless, they are his interests, and I am interested to cater to them in our games. So, for example, when a particular motif, such as dynamiting, captures Noah's imagination, we will go through phases where for weeks our stories will be variations on that central motif. I have described the chronological development of our storytelling relationship into one of shared storymaking. There appears to be agreement among researchers that ages three and four cover the period when children develop the ability to construct and tell stories that exhibit some degree of narrative competence (Marjanovic-Umek, Kranjc, and Fekonja 3; Fein 152; Engel, Stories Children Tell 16). According to Fein, "[t]he years from four to five seem to be a period of transition during which story performance is exceptionally sensitive to training and context, especially when opportunities for story enactment are provided" (153). Research on the devel- opment of children's storytelling skills at ages four, six and eight by Marjanovic-Umek, Kranjc and Fekonja (9) reveals that the greatest development of children's ability to structure a coherent and cohesive narrative occurred between ages four and six, while the development of storytelling techniques, that is, the ability to tell a story interestingly, develops more slowly.</page><page sequence="7">FROM STORYTELLING TO STORYMAKING 7 Storytelling and story dramatizations are recognized within the early childhood education sec- tor as providing a valuable and intrinsically motivating way for children to develop language, cognitive and social skills. They are also a great way of releasing the child's voice, providing "important insights into the way they see and think about the world" (Wright et al. 365). If, as Samuelsson (3) and Fein (155) observe, young children need props to express their perspective and support storytelling, then I could be described as a props mistress of Noah's imagination. In order to be an effective props mistress, I have had to learn to listen, perhaps more closely than I have ever listened before, to catch Noah's emerging contributions and perform faithful acts of interpretation. According to the Reggio Emilia philosophy, listening is not a passive receptive state; rather, it is a responsive activity that is at the center of teaching: Listening means being fully attentive to the children and at the same time taking responsibility for recording and documenting what is observed and then using it as a basis for decision making shared with children and parents. Listening means seeking to follow and enter into the active learning that is taking place. (Edwards 181) As hard as I listen, I can never fully know what Noah's imagination makes of the stories we share, although every so often I get an insight into the way he processes new story elements. When I first introduced a volcano into a story, Noah interacted with it in a way that made it evident he had little conceptual understanding of whether it was animal or mineral or of its relative size, extent of mobility, life, relations, functions, and so forth. None of these knowledge gaps was an obstacle to making stories about volcanoes that had a range of interactions with other characters yet still per- formed recognizable functions of erupting and spewing lava. Recently, Noah and I paused during a story to argue over whether volcanoes are ever fully dead or just sleeping, and I became aware that Noah not only had a good conceptual understanding of volcanoes, but he could also appro- priately apply the abstract concepts of "dead" and "sleeping" to a geographical phenomenon and was presenting empirical evidence to support his argument. I think I was right, but I did not have the evidence to back it up. Egan, an educational philosopher who champions the importance of children's imaginations leading their learning, claims that in contrast to foundational educational theories and beliefs (he mentions Dewey and Spencer), learning should be linked to what children can imagine, rather than what they know. He recommends that educators learn from the approach of storytellers, who "can introduce strange characters and weird situations ... as long as they build their narrative on the kind of abstract concepts students are familiar with - good/bad, brave/cowardly, anxiety/security, and so on" ("Start" 445). According to Egan, children's imag- inative abilities, and their ability to mediate between abstract categories, enable them to learn by "metaphorical leaps" rather than "logical connections" ("Start" 445). Of course, an "empowered" child's voice is not always going to be delightful. There was a stage, perhaps an inevitable one, when Noah's preoccupation with illicit words such as poos and wees began to surface in our stories. McKenzie, discussing the increasing number of pic- ture books that use "bums, poos and wees" as a source of humor, makes a direct link between Carnivalesque preoccupations with the lower stratum of the body (84-85) and the sorts of sub- versions and inversions of the social order that are clearly appealing to young children's humor. Because I recognized that these words were a genuine source of delight for Noah, and because I was anxious not to appear censorious, I refrained from checking or redirecting him and even joined in. The results were unsatisfactory. Sometimes using these words made him so excited he became incoherent, while almost inevitably his imagination became limited and repetitive.</page><page sequence="8">8 SMEED In an attempt to keep the Carnivalesque spirit and Noah's imagination alive, I began inventing other revolting things, such as fluff and dust cakes, rotten gold and compost-flavored food. Noah, who had always had a much stronger interest in narrative than nonsense, was delighted and a whole new genre of disgusting tales entered our storymaking. The strength of Noah's interest and delight in disgusting things even appeared to act as a prompt to his powers of invention, as subsequently many of his original creative contributions to our stories were rotten, odorous or otherwise disgusting. There are other ways that stories can release children's voices. Sipe and McGuire have researched children's story resistance, that is, those interjections and opinions offered by children when they experience dissonance between a text and what they know from experience or from their developing ideologies. "Reality testing" and "exclusionary resistance" (Sipe and McGuire 8) are two forms of story testing where children object to story elements on the basis that they cannot be real or are not right. One of the earliest forms of "reality" and "exclusionary" resistance Noah exhibited was around gender roles. Somehow, while neither of us was thinking about it, our pirate and superhero-dominated virtual playscape had become almost exclusively male. On becoming aware of this circumstance, I attempted to correct the balance, only to be emphatically told by Noah that "girls couldn't be pirates." I was horrified, although more at myself than Noah. Clearly, as co-designer (and initially lead designer) of our stories, I had played a significant part in creating an impression that girls could not be pirates. It became personally important that I correct it. The difficulty I subsequently experienced in creating female protagonists whose characters weren't in some way gender defined - either in terms of gender complicity or deliberate gender-role rejection - was eye opening. I consider myself a feminist, yet to this day I am aware of making a conscious effort to maintain a cast of interesting, varied female characters; and aware how easy it would be to let that agenda slide and revert to a fantasy world in which femaleness is character. I persevere, because it turns out that some things are more important than honoring the "child's voice." STORYMAKING AND EMOTIONS As his name reveals, the Grumpy Dragon is an emotional or affective creation, which fits with findings from research on children's stories that "the main character's psychological traits are the central guidelines in storytelling and that children's narration focuses on specific problems or conflicts associated with them" (Fein cited in Marjanovic-Umek et al. 4). The Grumpy Dragon appears to serve two kinds of emotional functions: first, he is an outlet for feelings Noah is rehearsing or experiencing and a way of venting those feelings in a safe and sanctioned way; second, he provides Noah with opportunities to be powerful, whether benevolently or vengefully. When the Grumpy Dragon is genuinely grumpy (which is not the majority of the time), there may not always be a direct correlation that I am aware of to Noah's life circumstances, but what is always clear is Noah's need to act out antisocial feelings, such as resentment, and be mollified or punishing to others. The Grumpy Dragon has been sick a lot recently or tired and unable to wake up; my role is to diagnose his malady and seek to fix it while Noah stretches out plots in which is he partially unavailable and must be sought out and pursued. The memory of how appealing the special status of sickness or disability were to my childhood imagination helps me to be patient</page><page sequence="9">FROM STORYTELLING TO STORYMAKING 9 with the Grumpy Dragon when he does nothing but snore or roar at me for extended periods at the beginning of games. The role of stories in children's emotional wellbeing is highlighted by early childhood story advocates. Stories that retell events from children's lives are considered useful for helping them make sense of their lived experience and their place in the world (Im, Parlakian, and Osborn 52; Owocki 100-01); however, Noah is perhaps notably uninterested in "real" stories about himself. Claims from the early childhood literature that stories enable children to "investigate feelings and fears in a safe setting" (Harrett and Benjamin 32) and "play out, and thus defuse scary material" (Wright et al. 368) do not correlate to my experience with Noah's fears either. I remember from my own childhood that imagination had a boundless quality that could be a source of terror as well as delight because anything (good or bad) could happen. Noah's anxieties first surfaced in our storytelling sessions during Pip stories, as he went through more and less fearful phases. His level of investment in the stories became evident in his inability to face up to the consequences of Pip's naughtiness or daring, and he began stipulat- ing that he wanted "good" or "naughty" Pip stories. "Good" Pip stories tended to be harmlessly and often humorously slapstick, with a repetitive structure, and, more importantly, no antagonist (such as an angry butcher). They were not stories that I was particularly good at telling, and frequently I would be pulled up by Noah because my "good" story was becoming "too scary." While this was a source of personal exasperation, it was probably Noah's first indication that he had the power to change and control the storytelling process. Noah's need for emotional security nowadays more often takes the form of turning bad characters into his friends, including pirate cockroaches, pirate monkeys, mean pirates, witches, super villains and giants. It is a trick he has perhaps learned from me because I have changed many characters into babies, comic fools and victims mid story in order to allay Noah's mounting fears. Being sensitive to Noah's emotional needs can be labor intensive, however, and at one stage I had to invent new super villains because Noah had made friends with all the known ones. In a study of the worlds children create in their play, Hyvönen and Kangas found that "emo- tional worlds" (44) were a core category of play and, further, that "emotional worlds" could be coded according to gender: scenarios involving "scariness and happiness" were a particular feature of girls' play, while boys' play featured scenarios of "care and aggression" (44). The character of the Grumpy Dragon demonstrates an equitable blend of care and aggression, with care appearing in both parenting and rescue scenarios. The Grumpy Dragon's other names are the Daddy (or Granddaddy) Dragon and the King of the Dragons. In both those roles, which are interchangeable, the Grumpy Dragon is nurturing and protective on one hand and vengeful and destructive on the other. He will ruthlessly pursue and attempt to destroy a baddy or destroyer of his property; however, should the malefactor turn out (on interrogation) to be young, needy, pre- viously victimized or contrite, the aggressive pursuit will switch to a care agenda, as the Grumpy Dragon becomes father, rescuer and defender. Sometimes I am uncomfortably aware of taking a role in Noah's moral education when I chose certain plot directions, or character motivations, for example, when I characterize a cornered baddy as a child or baby in order to circumvent the Grumpy Dragon's aggressive revenge. On one hand, I recognize that he is a vehicle for Noah to openly express feelings of frustration and anger in acts of aggression that are not sanctioned in any other part of his life - feelings I can vividly remember experiencing myself as a child. On the other hand, both our stories and our moods can deteriorate when these feelings are given free play.</page><page sequence="10">1 0 SMEED STORYMAKING AND MORALS Concern over violence in children's, particularly that of boys, imaginative play is not new; how- ever, there has been growing debate over the extent to which roleplaying superheroes is a positive or negative element in children's play. While the Grumpy Dragon is not a superhero in the strict sense, he has all the necessary attributes to be termed a bespoke one: he is a protector and defender who is indestructible from a combination of phenomenal strength, superior fighting skills and magic powers. His creation followed on directly from Noah's interest in Batman and Robin, and initially he mostly appeared alongside them in plots. In addition, his role as defender and rescuer is a development from Batman's role. Research on older children's moral valuation of their favorite superheroes reveals they are generally rated highly on prosocial skills, leading the researcher to suggest that they can be used as a tool in children's moral education because of the moral and social values they uphold: "Superheroes are considered good or bad not because of their use of violence, but with regard to the contexts and motivations that influence their actions. ... In other words, superheroes use violence only to prevent harm to others" (Martin 240-41), and children can understand this. Superhero play may also be positive because it enables children to release emotions in play that are not be sanctioned elsewhere, such as anger and fear. Sorin identifies "fear" as an emotion that is often invalidated by adults in both teaching and parenting relationships with children (81-82). It is hard to know what to do with Noah's fears, and I sometimes wonder if children's fears hold a sort of terror for adults and carers because they reveal the limits of our abilities to nurture and protect. Noah is scared by angry characters; but also of "suspense" elements in stories, which are necessary for dramatic action. Despite being the biggest and strongest creature in the world, the Grumpy Dragon will sometimes require me (as the Angry Dragon or another character) to enter strange caves or castles before him, or to front meetings with new baddies. As Noah's immediate caregiver, I will feel it is my duty to ameliorate a danger that I had not anticipated creating. Death has also featured in our games. "Shall we go on a killing hunt or a gold hunt?" Noah asked recently during a game. I automatically shrunk from the first option, despite having just read Mawson's research on death in children's shared dramatic play, which revealed that death was "a narrative that allowed [children] to explore other social and work relationships." . . . "The death itself was inconsequential; it was a mechanism for introducing new scenarios and roles into a play episode" (Mawson 61). Nevertheless, I opted for a gold hunt, although I felt to do so was to misread Noah and be hypocritical - after all, during our pirate days on the Seven Seas, I had created hundreds of canon battles and sword fights which could be termed "killing hunts" (although I refused to allow guns because they are personal weapons for killing rather than fighting). While I have not been able to divest all censoring impulses, I have been making efforts to resist them. In an attempt to get over myself, I did not intervene when the Grumpy Dragon recently decided to kill his rogue, dynamiting baby dragon. Shortly afterwards, the baby turned up in the story alive. Just as Mawson observed in children's collaborative play, "pretend death" was a temporary condition from which the "dead" individual was brought back to life (60). Death has also appeared in our storymaking in another capacity. Recently, in the early stages of a game in which I was playing his two dragon babies, the Grumpy Dragon announced: "I will die before you." It turned out he only had 150 years to live (dragons live for millions of years). My attempts to highlight the poignancy of his impending death fell rather flat: death was an event, not a tragedy. Instead, at Noah's instigation, the last 150 years of the Grumpy Dragon's life became a story of fatherhood, teaching and adventure. Impending death enabled the introduction</page><page sequence="11">FROM STORYTELLING TO STORYMAKING 1 1 of a time sequence into the narrative that had a recognizable and meaningful structure: there were tasks that had to be accomplished before death. In the game that followed, Noah counted down the Grumpy Dragon's final years while his babies grew into teenagers and struggled to learn all the skills they would need to be powerful, independent adults. I was fascinated to see what death might be for Noah and if he had any purpose for introducing it into our play. Finally, it was time for the Grumpy Dragon to die. He had trained his teenagers to be accomplished fighters and magicians, and had carers picked out for four new born babies who had somehow turned up in the story. I suggested a final party at the cave of the Grumpy Bear; it was there, after consuming Compost Seaweed (which is our version of Popeye's spinach), that the Grumpy Dragon discovered he was going to stay alive. And just like that, death disappeared. Interestingly this was one of few games in which Noah cooperated in staging a single cohesive, sequential narrative - a structure that is so frequently lacking in our games. STORYTELLING AS LIFELONG LEARNING Initially, I faced the request "tell me a Pip story" with an overwhelming sense of blankness and a minor sense of panic. I did not have a store of stories in my memory to produce upon demand, so how could I be a storyteller? I quickly discovered that if I asked Noah to decide who and what was in the story, I could generate myriad tales out of small kernels of information and discovered in myself a surprising capacity for invention. I have since been able to make good use of the realization that my powers of invention are dependent on sparking contributions from others and have used it to my benefit in other, professional contexts. The stories I told when Noah was two and three (during the Pip and pirate phases) frequently existed in a sort of tension between Noah's needs, as the primary audience, and my needs as a storyteller. I had to entertain myself as well as Noah, but while Noah craved security and repeti- tion, I was constantly extemporizing on previous themes and feeding my craving for variety with complex narratives and ever-increasing casts. Although I began our story relationship as a novice storyteller, I was already a seasoned story critic after years of reading and the critical study of literature. When I was in charge of the storytelling, I was able to indulge my trained narrative sensibilities for sequential plots, dramatic crises and cohesive story elements. However, even in the early stages, tensions could arise around whether this was a storymaking exercise with an audience of one or two. As I have previously discussed, Noah's emotional needs, developmental level and dramatic interests placed checks on the stories I could tell and the practice of allowing him to choose the focus of the story produced challenges as well as opportunities for my imagina- tion. However, it was not until we began creating stories together that my notions of what makes a story were significantly challenged by Noah's voice. The process of letting go of some narra- tive standards and structure that I learned as a child and an adult has been a powerful exercise in self-revelation. AKO: A FRAMEWORK FOR UNLEARNING THE ART OF STORYMAKING A framework that I have found useful for analyzing the development of my shared storymaking relationship with Noah is the concept of Ako. Tamati states that "[t]he concept of AKO in Maori education ideology means both to teach and to learn;" it "signifies that every person has</page><page sequence="12">1 2 SMEED something of value to bring to a learning opportunity" (23). While there will always be power dynamics in teaching and learning relationships, they are more plastic and less inevitable when the focus is on complex relationships and interactions that construct new knowledge (Tamati 30). I find it much easier to conceptualize myself as a learner than a teacher (a role I have never been completely comfortable with), and from the beginning I have approached storytelling and storymaking in that capacity. I am strongly aware of learning about myself and Noah - our capa- bilities, strengths and weaknesses - when playing "games." At the same time, I have developed far greater awareness of the narrative conventions that both enable and fetter my imagination, and the process of unlearning some of them that is required if I am to follow Noah's interests. As we increasingly share the creative work of designing our story world, I am aware that what Noah must learn in order to express his imagination; to some extent, I must unlearn to more fully express mine. I have already mentioned the difficulty I had in reconciling Batman to an imaginative world of pirates, dragons, anthropomorphism and magical fantasy. Batman was an imaginative bind because I could only envision him doing things like pursuing and capturing villains, or rescuing people and property; similarly, I could only envision him in Gotham City, the bat cave or baddies' lairs. I literally could not imagine his just turning up at a dragon's birthday party, or parenting stray baby animals, or fighting pirates on the seven seas - but Noah could. Pastiche is defined as "a literary work composed from elements borrowed either from various other writers or from a particular earlier author" (Baldick 185). My reaction against pastiche in our stories was both aesthetic and conventional. Noah's postmodern ability to join together any elements from any stories or genres did not fit with my notion of what makes stories "good" because at that stage I was still making value judgments of how successful each story was based on cohesiveness and originality, not on the amount of contribution or pleasure it generated. Partly it was a matter of taste and a partly a matter of logic (narrative structure), but either way it was an imaginative limit that impinged upon the primary pleasure of our storymaking relationship. NEGOTIATING ACTION DURING STORYMAKING The rules I have learned for telling stories encompass not just the elements that can make up a cohesive plot but also rules of dramatic pace and shape. When I was in charge of developing and shaping our stories, I created increasingly elaborate quest tales that were fundamentally novel- istic. The creative work was a source of pleasure and satisfaction for me, and initially hard to relinquish. The games Noah and I now play are more picaresque: they have episodic plots that focus around the adventures of one character, and while characters and scenarios recur, they do so in incidental or contingent ways (Miller 50). One reason is that we have a practice of accom- modating each other's interests and inventions. However, the main reason is because Noah is not good at delaying gratification, a skill that is just as important in the construction of a story as it is to developing emotional maturity. Plots, I have become increasingly aware, are a series of delays that prevent resolution from occurring before a story has been told. Noah shortcuts plot with two forms of instant gratifica- tion. First, he endows himself with the ability to make anything happen by the dramatic strategy of "doing" it straight away. For example, if a bridge is required to ford an abyss, Noah con- structs one instantly by saying "make, make, make." When a baddie dynamites his cave, it is repaired at almost the same speed with the words "fix, fix, fix." Second, Noah does away with</page><page sequence="13">FROM STORYTELLING TO STORYMAKING 1 3 the limitations - and narrative extensions - of time and space. Although our imaginative world is geographically vast and complex, consisting primarily of seas and islands, any space can be traversed instantly and any character (no matter where they are located) addressed straight away. Knaus has linked children's relation to time to that of Heidegger's being in time and the ever present "now" of physical or lived time (29). She notes that "the concept of distance in time in an adult sense is difficult for young children as they do not recognize that time can ever be fully separated from them" (26). However, Noah does also have another, "cognitive" understanding of time (Knaus 26) that is evident when he negotiates the number of minutes that the game will continue down to the last second. It is only within the "game" that time and space bend readily to his needs for instant action and interaction. Because the Grumpy Dragon is so powerful and almost always instantly gratified, stories are often forced to a resolution long before Noah's appetite for story has been met, which is the main reason why picaresque plots have developed. In each storymaking session, the Grumpy Dragon will undertake a series of adventures, along the way meeting large casts of characters. At times the interest in the stories breaks down under the load and, not surprisingly, I tend to tire from the effort of constant inventing. Recently, realizing that Noah had come to rely on me to get him out of imaginative fixes of his own making, I experimented with letting him experience the consequences of poor story decisions. Learning to "let go" can be one of the hardest lessons for teachers to learn because it feels like an invitation to disorder and is contrary to our conceptions of ourselves (Wisneski 32). However, by allowing some stories to go nowhere or become dull and strained, I have created opportunities for Noah to problem solve his own imagination and along the way learned one of the most valuable lessons a teacher can get: stop teaching. I have begun to think that I have undergone a four-year apprenticeship in unlearning how to tell stories and thereby unbind my imagination and maximize the development of Noah's. The ephemeral and joyful nature of the stories Noah and I make together enables me to let go of aes- thetic narrative preoccupations, to let go of some narrative conventions I learned as a child and narrative standards I learned as an adult. However, the amount of unlearning I can do is limited. I can become a better playmate, but I can never be Noah's peer. Research by Whitebread et al. reveals that the highest levels of meta-cognitive and self-regulatory development occur in chil- dren's play with peers, with emotional self-regulation in particular developed in peer-mediated play (45). Play, according to Samuelsson and Johansson (80), allows children to experience con- trol. Because I am now an adept listener and storymaker, I am allowing Noah to experience a considerable extent of control over our play by shaping my imagination around his interests and contributions. While Noah's peers would be just as adept at shifting readily in and out of charac- ters and imaginative scenarios, it is unlikely that they would be able to - or would want to - shape their play around Noah's imaginative world to the same extent. Noah remains less confident with his peers than he is with adults, and the concern that I may have inhibited the development of his peer social skills and ability to self-regulate strong emotions is the only lingering doubt I have about our storymaking relationship. CONCLUSION My storymaking role with Noah is multiple and complex. Once I was a novice storyteller who was a seasoned story critic; I am an aunty who is sometimes, and perhaps inevitably, a teacher;</page><page sequence="14">1 4 SMEED I am a play partner who is not a peer; and I am someone who is teaching story conventions that I am in the process of unlearning. Sometimes different aspects of the role occur to me in the middle of a game, and sometimes I think of them in review. I have linked many aspects of storymaking to early childhood play-based pedagogy and research, but ultimately I consider that it has been a shared learning experience, rather than a teaching exercise. I have learned about concentration, perseverance and motivation from a child and along the way discovered potential and limits to my imagination of which I Was unaware. I also learned that storymaking became most interesting when I gave up consciously teaching narrative conventions and "scaffolding" Noah's vocabulary development (MacNaughton and Williams 370-72). Instead, I listened very hard, asked thousands of questions, took risks, got over myself, made decisions and accepted and challenged thousands more decisions. I also did a great deal of modeling of the powers of invention, and the rich language needed to articulate rich imaginations. In retrospect, my role in the development of Noah's imagination has been that of a gardener, rather than a teacher, who has tended the growth of something extraordinary that always existed but needed good conditions in which to flourish. This year, Noah revealed that he had developed into another sort of storyteller. We were in Nana' s bathroom where I was giving his younger sister Annabel a bath. "Can we have a game now?" he inopportunely asked. I explained that I had to concentrate when I was bathing Annabel so the answer was no. "How can I help?" he asked. "Well, you can tell Annabel a story." So Noah sat on the toilet seat and spontaneously told from memory the stories of the "Three Billy Goats Gruff' and "The Three Little Pigs," complete with taglines, character details, remembered dialogue and sound effects. "You're going to be a great storyteller," his mother told him, when he repeated the performance for her immediately afterward on the phone, while simultaneously running excitedly around the house. Actually, he already is. Juliette Smeed gained a PhD in English Literature from the University of Auckland in 2009. She currently lectures at New Zealand Tertiary College, a private early childhood teacher-education provider. In addition to children 's storytelling , her current research interests include the picture books of Richard Scarry and the links between nonsense literature and children's language play. She writes comic poetry for friends and relations in her spare time. WORKS CITED Baldick, Chris. The Oxford Concise Dictionary of Literary Terms. 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001. Print.
