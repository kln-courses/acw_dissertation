INTERROGATION OF POLITICAL PRISONERS Vigorous Shaking of Political Prisoners as a Means of Interrogation: Physical, Affective, and Neuropsychological Sequelae Norm O'Rourke University of Ottawa, Canada Abstract. Torture is a crude and ancient method of ex- tracting information and confessions from prisoners. Its use is still widespread throughout the world, but its tech- niques have become increasingly sophisticated. Today, information and confessions are commonly extracted from political prisoners with few signs of physical trauma. For instance, Israel's General Security Service has come to employ vigorous shaking as one such means of interrogation within the Occupied Territories of the Gaza and West Bank. This procedure may sound innoc- uous, but there are good reasons to believe that vigorous shaking can induce whiplash-related injuries. Such evi- dence is found in the child abuse and motor vehicle acci- dent literature. Although global intellect may appear unaffected, more subtle emotional and cognitive dys- function can create lasting impairment. This article con- cludes that vigorous shaking of political prisoners is a dangerous and potentially lethal mode of interrogation that should be discontinued by Israel's General Security Forces and avoided by all governments. Norm O'Rourke is currently completing a Ph.D. in clinical psy- chology at the University of Ottawa. Mr. O'Rourke is a doctoral fellow of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and is associate editor of the Canadian Journal on Aging. Previously published research has examined caregiver depression, relapse subsequent to termination of pharmacotherapy, and memory function among older adults.

ON NOVEMBER 14, 1996, ISRAEL'S Supreme Court lifted an interim injunction prohibiting the use of physical force during the interrogation of political prisoners. In keeping with the "ticking bomb" argu- ment, exceptional dispensation was granted to the General Security Service (GSS or Shin Bet) in instances where detainees are believed to hold information vital to civilian security. Vigorous shaking of suspected terrorists to expe- dite confessions was judged not to infringe upon safeguards under Israel's Penal Code. In part, this decision was based on the belief that this means of interrogation poses negligi- ble risk of injury (Gavshon, 1996). A limited but consistent body of research, however, suggests that forced flexion- extension of the neck can lead to lasting impairment. Even without physical contact to the head, whiplash injuries have been shown to cause affective disturbance and cognitive deficits. Evidence supporting these assertions is drawn from the child abuse and motor vehicle accident literature. To date, the death of one political prisoner has resulted directly from vigorous shaking while in official custody (referred to as work accidents by the Shin Bet). Abd al- Samad Harizat was detained by the Israeli Defense Force as a suspected leader of Hamas (the Islamic resistance move- ment). Over a period of 12 hours, Harizat was shaken at least 12 times by the shoulders and lapels. Healthy upon arrest, Harizat was comatose 20 hours later and was pronounced dead the next day (Amnesty International, 1996). Hospital records and subsequent post-mortem indicated that Harizat died due to malignant brain edema (swelling) and subdural hematoma (bleeding) of the right parietal region. The extent of these injuries can be partially attributed to congenital skeletal deformities of the victim. At 4 feet 6 inches tall and 95 pounds, Harizat was considerably smaller than his interrogators. This size differential is analogous to the requisite conditions of whiplash shaken infant syndrome Politics and the Life Sciences March 1999 0730-9384/99/010031-6 US$08.00 ? Beech Tree Publishing 1999</page><page sequence="2">Vigorous Shaking of Political Prisoners in which adult caregivers induce severe neurological injury among young children (Caffey, 1972). As noted by Caffey (1974), shaken infant syndrome represents an extraordinary diagnostic contradiction as ex- tensive physical trauma can occur without external indices of injury. This is due, in part, to the vulnerability and physical features of the infant's physique. For instance, the head is large relative to overall body size and mass, and supporting muscles in the neck and shoulders are yet unde- veloped (i.e., lack rigidity, thus unable to provide support to the head). The pathogenesis of injury is due, in part, to differential inertial properties of the brain and skull. More precisely, tissue damage results from the momentum and rotation of the brain, which lags slightly behind rapid movements of the skull (Brown and Minns, 1993). This differential is further exacerbated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in which the brain is suspended; once the skull reverses direction or comes to rest, CSF allows the brain to maintain inertial movement (Bower, 1986; Bruce, 1984). The histological structure of cranial axons enables brain tissue to withstand considerable compression. However, the proportion of collagen, elastin fibers, and polymer cross-linking provides axons with a low modulus of elastic- ity (Bower, 1986). Differential inertia of the brain and skull thus subject axons to traction forces that can lead to the rup- ture of bridging veins connecting the cerebral cortex with venous sinuses (Guthkelch, 1971). Tearing of veins of the superior sagittal sinus may directly lead to extensive bleed- ing, swelling, and intracranial pressure (Caffey, 1974). In documented cases of physical abuse, Caffey (1972) cites research in which more than three-quarters of children were later found to be mentally handicapped (i.e., IQ &lt; 80). Few incidents of vigorous shaking are believed to cause immediate death. This does not mean, however, that only infants are likely to sustain lasting injury as a result of such treatment. Amnesty International (1998) estimates that 800 political prisoners are subjected to vigorous shaking each year by Israel's General Security Service. It now appears that this procedure has become a staple method of interro- gation within the Occupied Territories. Shaken Impact Syndrome Although infants are most vulnerable to whiplash injury, political prisoners are subjected to conditions that increase the risk of trauma. For instance, detainees are commonly hooded for long periods, restrained in painful positions, and deprived of food and sleep for days on end (Human Rights Watch/Middle East, 1994). During interrogation, prisoners are shackled to chairs that are often tipped backward such that the head is maintained in unusual positions (Amnesty International, 1996). Repeated blows and shaking create fatigue and increase the possibility of further injury (Physi- cians for Human Rights, 1995). Over and above psychologi- cal exhaustion, these conditions affect equilibrium and muscle rigidity such that the likelihood of whiplash is increased. In other words, normal defensive reflexes are compromised (i.e., trapezius muscles provide less protec- tion to the head from jarring movements). For many years, the suggestion of lasting injury as a result of whiplash was a contentious issue (e.g., Merskey, 1986). Within the medical literature, physicians have argued whether enduring injuries were physical or psycho- genie in nature (Evans, 1992). This debate was fueled by the absence of radiographie evidence of tissue damage, despite persistent complaints of multiple physical and cognitive disturbances (Ettlin et al., 1992; Yamell and Rossie, 1988). It had been previously suggested, for instance, that whip- lash syndrome was largely attributable to the prospect of financial gain (Evans, 1992). However, a substantial proportion of patients continue to experience physical and emotional disturbances subsequent to successful litigation (Grotten, 1976). More recent technologies have improved diagnostic efficacy. Such procedures (e.g., magnetic reso- nance imaging) are no panacea due to high rates of false-positive diagnoses (Spitzer et al., 1995). Diagnosis of whiplash-associated disorders therefore remains somewhat subjective. Experimental research indicates that forced flexion- extension allows the neck to act as a lever attenuating momentum of the head (Bamsley, Lord, and Bogduk, 1994). This has been demonstrated in cadaver (Rauschning, McAfee, and J?nsson, 1989), crash test (Deng, 1989), and animal (Sano et al, 1972) research. For example, studies with anesthetized monkeys in simulated motor vehicle accidents demonstrate that cerebral injury can result with- out direct impact to the head (Ommaya and Hirsch, 1971). This body of research has put to rest the assumption that shaken impact syndrome lacks a physiological basis (Bamsley, Lord, and Bogduk, 1994). The challenge is now to identify the pathophysiology of injury as opposed to the legitimacy of symptoms (Rabasca, 1998). Physical Injury Resulting from Whiplash In part, dispute regarding the validity of this diagnosis can be attributed to the divergent sequelae of symptoms that occur due to whiplash injuries. Incidents of facial pain and tinnitus are not uncommon (Bower, 1986), as well as men- strual irregularities, sleep disturbances, and dysphasia (Ettlin et al., 1992). Most common, however, are recurrent headaches (Jacome, 1987), dizziness (Rubin, 1973), vertigo (Hinoki, 1985), and chronic neck pain (Friction, 1993). Larsson et al. (1994) have demonstrated that restricted blood flow is associated with chronic myalgia (muscle pain, loss of strength, fatigue) among whiplash patients. As com- pared to muscles in which no pain is reported (i.e., opposite side), reduced microcirculation corresponds to pain complaints, numbness, and stiffness. These researchers conclude that restricted blood flow leads to lower pH levels within muscle due to accumulation of lactate (Larsson et al., 32 Politics and the Life Sciences March 1999</page><page sequence="3">Vigorous Shaking of Political Prisoners An extensive body of experimental and case research documents marked impairment in mental functioning subsequent to whiplash injury. Most prevalent are disturbances in memory function, attention, and speed of information processing 1994). This process is implicated in the onset and mainte- nance of chronic myalgia resulting from whiplash injury. In addition to physical mobility, impaired eye move- ment has also been documented to result from whiplash in- juries. In research conducted by Hildingsson et al. (1989), the majority of motor vehicle accident (MVA) patients pre- sented with impaired eye movement. Although no neuro- logical deficits were evident, smooth pursuit and saccade eye movement for 20 of 39 patients appeared dysfunctional. These authors suggest that disrupted communication be- tween brain centers may be the cause of these disturbances. Cognitive Symptoms and Whiplash Injuries Aside from pain and somatic symptoms, Radanov, Dvorak, and Valach (1992) categorize disturbances in cognition as cervicoencephalic syndrome. An extensive body of experi- mental and case research documents marked impairment in mental functioning subsequent to whiplash injury. Most prevalent are disturbances in memory function, attention, and speed of information processing. Bohnen, Jolies, and Verhey (1993) tested patients unable to maintain employ- ment following MVA whiplash injury. These patients showed marked deficits on timed tests and measures of executive functioning (e.g., attention, concentration, mental flexibility, planning), leading to pronounced difficulties in learning due to sensitivity to interfering stimuli. Similar findings emerged in a prospective study by Di Stefano and Radanov (1995) in which a sample of 117 MVA whiplash patients demonstrated marked impairment relative to matched controls. Not only were significant deficits apparent on memory tasks and attentional function, but performance declined over time, suggesting that these deficits are enduring. Impairment of higher cortical function, however, does not generally result from whiplash injury (Kischka et al., 1991). For instance, patients recruited in the study by Bohnen, Jolies, and Verhey (1993) obtained intelligence quotients above mean level (i.e., IQ &gt; 100). This may be at- tributed to a distinction between memory required for new learning versus long-term memory function. Whiplash patients may present with anterograde memory distur- bance; however, fund of knowledge remains intact, as well as recall for events before the accident (Barontini and Maurri, 1992). This phenomenon may account for discrep- ancies between overall intelligence and discrete perfor- mance on specific tasks of cognitive function. Affective Disturbance and Whiplash Syndrome Various authors contend that affective disturbance can occur as a result of whiplash injury (Ettlin et al, 1992). Most often, patients present with either depression or anxiety symptoms (Lee, Giles, and Drummond, 1993). Radanov, Hirlinger, Di Stefano, and Valach (1992) also report reduced patient subjective well-being following whiplash injury. As compared to matched spinal rheumatism patients, the majority who had sustained whiplash injury met diag- nostic criteria for adjustment disorder. It is unclear, how- ever, if this is attributable to coping with injury or pathology specific to whiplash syndrome. Radanov, Dvorak, and Valach (1992) discuss rates of concurrence between affective symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. They suggest that it is unclear, due to the influ- ence of emotion upon intellectual function, if affective and cognitive disturbances are discrete or if affective symptoms impede performance on measures of cognitive function. As noted by Kaszniak and DiTraglia Christiansen (1994), affective disturbance can lead to global impairment. In contrast, the circumscribed deficits that occur as a result of shaken impact syndrome imply a distinct etiology. Although affective symptoms may attenuate cognitive disturbance, the specific presentation of deficits resulting from whiplash injury suggests a distinct pathophysiology. Brain Cytoarchitecture and Shaken Impact Syndrome Shaken impact syndrome is believed to affect a divergent range of physical and mental functions. Despite this vari- ability, it would appear that these symptoms can be attrib- uted to disturbance in specific brain regions. The locus coeruleus has most often been implicated regarding these disturbances. This bilateral pontine structure within the brain stem is integral to consciousness and the sleep-waking cycle (Beatty, 1995). In addition, this structure is believed to play a role in learning and memory function (Robbins, Everitt, and Cole, 1985). Clark, Geffen, and Geffen ( 1986) have demonstrated the seminal role of the locus coeruleus in attention and informa- tion processing. In a controlled experiment with normal adult males, subjects were randomly administered either clonidine or methylphenidate (Ritalin). The former is an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist that inhibits firing of neurons in the locus coeruleus (Bezchlibnyk-Butler, Jeffries, and Martin, 1994). As compared to subjects who received the amphetamine, Ritalin, experimental subjects performed with significant impairment on target discrimination tasks (i.e., identification of words embedded within phonemic distracters). Target detection, discrimination, and response Politics and the Life Sciences March 1999 33</page><page sequence="4">Vigorous Shaking of Political Prisoners time were slower for subjects receiving clonidine (Clark, Geffen, and Geffen, 1986). These subjects reported consid- erable difficulty maintaining attention and visual focus; however, there were no error-rate differences as compared to Ritalin-administered subjects. Clark, Geffen, and Geffen (1986) suggest that noradrenergic agents do not directly impede higher cognitive function, but rather interfere with the requisite processes that govern attention, information processing, and learning. Operation of Neurotransmitters The locus coeruleus governs these functions via norepinephrine (or noradrenaline) synthesis. According to Svensson (1987), 70% of all cerebral norepinephrine origi- nates from the locus coeruleus. This neurotransmitter acts primarily to inhibit spontaneous synapse discharge of target neurons (Cooper, Bloom, and Roth, 1991). With projections throughout the cerebellar, hippocampal, and cerebral corti- ces, a primary function of the locus coeruleus is to moderate interaction between organisms and their environment. For instance, basic behaviors such as arousal, selective atten- tion, and autonomie function (e.g., fight or flight response) are each linked to norepinephrine. As the locus coeruleus is found within the reptilian brain (i.e., ancient structure upon which subsequent cortices evolved), its operation is associated with numerous behav- iors necessary for adaptation and survival. Information pro- cessing does not occur within the brain stem; it simply functions to orient the organism to external cues (Aston-Jones, 1985). Although the terminal network of the locus coeruleus extends throughout the neocortex (Svensson, 1987), the in- fluence of norepinephrine upon cognition occurs as a result of projections between the locus coeruleus and the prefrontal cortex (Bohnen, Jolies, and Verhey, 1993). Ener- vation of this region of the frontal lobe is believed to be inte- gral to executive function (Fuster, 1989). For instance, norepinephrine release appears to regulate focused atten- tion upon specific stimuli and simultaneous inhibition of background activity. Termed the signal-to-noise ratio, this ability is critical to selective attention, learning, and infor- mation processing (Sara, 1985). In order to attend to impor- tant environmental cues, it is necessary to focus upon certain information while preventing distraction from com- peting stimuli (Radanov et al., 1993). In addition to external cues, norepinephrine effects both emotional and cardiac function (Svensson, 1987). Regula- tion of internal homeostasis also occurs through projections (and feedback, or aff?rents) from the limbic region. Within this system, disruption of norepinephrine function is hypothesized to create a feed-forward cycle in which increased arousal leads the organism to attend and overinterpret environmental stimuli. Without hyperarousal, these cues might otherwise be deemed innoc- uous (Svensson, 1987). The corollary is evident among sympathectomized animals who fail to identify and respond to external threats. Unable to marshall protective behaviors, the animal is vulnerable to environmental hazards. The operation of norepinephrine has also been impli- cated in the onset and maintenance of affective disorders as all somatic treatments for depression are known to impact norepinephrine levels (Olpe, Steinmann, and Jones, 1985). For instance, a class of medication known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MOAs) slow degradation of norepinephrine so that this neurotransmitter remains active within the synaptic vesicle (Bezchlibnyk-Butler, Jeffries, and Martin, 1994). The operation of these medications sug- gests that inefficient norepinephrine function precipitates depressive symptomatology. This is further supported by the hypothesized role of lithium carbonate in the treatment of bipolar affective disorder. This compound is believed to stabilize brain neurotransmitter levels. For example, lith- ium increases efficiency of norepinephrine reuptake and may therefore prevent manic episodes (Beatty, 1995). Vigorous Shaking and Neurological Dysfunction Shaken impact syndrome is hypothesized to disrupt norepinephrine synthesis and transport. This may occur sub- sequent to intracranial bleeding and secondary swelling, pressure, or vasogenic edema (Brown and Minns, 1993). This process impedes cranial blood flow so that the brain is deprived of oxygen, resulting in tissue death. Most often as- sociated with whiplash injuries (Kirschener and Wilson, 1994), this process has also been documented in case reports involving falls without head strike (as cited by Guthkelch, 1971) and repeated roller-coaster riding (Bo-Abbas and Bolton, 1995). The skull provides significant protection from direct impact injuries; however, the brain remains vul- nerable to shearing forces due to inertial movement (Bower, 1986). These examples are believed similar to the mechan- ics that underlie shaken impact syndrome. As noted by Spitzer et al. (1995), whiplash-associated disorders can result at speeds as low as 6 to 8 kilometers per hour. The range of deficits reported subsequent to whiplash in- jury may be due, in part, to trauma to various brain regions. Of note, however, only a percentage of patients report last- ing disturbance. Although patients may appear to withstand similar assault, some recover with no lasting impairment. A recent report by Jordan et al. (1997) offers one possible The range of deficits reported subsequent to whiplash injury may be due, in part, to trauma to various brain regions. Of note, however, only a percentage of patients report lasting disturbance 34 Politics and the Life Sciences March 1999</page><page sequence="5">Vigorous Shaking of Political Prisoners explanation for individual differences. This study, con- ducted among retired professional boxers, suggests a link between apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and traumatic brain injury. (This gene has been linked to the onset of Alz- heimer disease.) Controlling for number of bouts, boxers identified with the APOE e4 al?ele showed the greatest cog- nitive impairment. These authors contend that genetic dif- ferences may determine the brain's response to acute injury. In combination with environmental factors, the APOE e4 al?ele may indicate who is at greatest risk for last- ing impairment (Jordan et al., 1997). A similar mechanism may account for differential outcomes subsequent to whip- lash injury, and may further suggest who is most vulnera- ble. As we are unlikely to see genotyping of political prisoners, this means of interrogation appears akin to Rus- sian roulette. Conclusion The research reviewed here suggests that vigorous shaking may not be an innocuous means of interrogation. Despite a paucity of concrete physical indices and experimental re- search, the potential dangers posed by vigorous shaking cannot be dismissed (Physicians for Human Rights, 1995). Irrespective of security concerns, vigorous shaking of politi- cal prisoners contravenes the Universal Declaration of Hu- man Rights to which Israel is a signatory (Amnesty International, 1998). The official position of the Israeli Government is that vigorous shaking presents no risk of lasting injury (Gavshon, 1996). This procedure, they say, is intended sim- ply to induce momentary confusion. Indeed, Israeli offi- cials claim that, over a six-month period, 48 attacks were foiled due to information gained as a result of special inter- rogation methods (Amnesty International, 1998). More than 100 Israelis have died in terrorist attacks since the Oslo Accord was signed in 1993. Such indiscriminate killing of civilians is a tragedy that Israel is surely justified in seeking to halt. Unfortunately, cruel treatment of political prisoners may actually increase the likelihood of continued sectarian violence. The proposed Law of the General Security Service would have enshrined the use of pressure against political detainees. This bill further proposed to grant immunity to GSS agents for work accidents occurring during interroga- tions. International pressure led to the revocation of this proposed legislation prior to the 1996 election. This bill, however, has since been reintroduced. At this time, Israel stands poised to be the first demo- cratic nation to openly sanction use of a technique of inter- rogation that may be a form of torture. Despite the assertions of Israeli officials, vigorous shaking of political prisoners should not be assumed to be either innocuous or necessary. Findings from the child abuse and motor vehicle accident literature suggest that vigorous shaking can lead to neurological dysfunction and enduring cognitive deficits. Until more is known, Israel should discontinue use of vigor- ous shaking, and all governments should be dissuaded from using such interrogation techniques. References Amnesty International (1996).
