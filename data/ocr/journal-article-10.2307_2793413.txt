T. BARROW Dominion Museum, Wellington, New Zealand 192 The first purpose of this contribution is to make available to students important figure material from Western Polynesia in the Fijian collection of the University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Cambridge. The record is intended to supplement research on Tongan images by the late Sir Peter Buck.' The second and more original purpose is to formulate the essential characteristics of figure representations in Fiji, and to differentiate them from figures of Tongan manufacture. Some confusion of identity has arisen because Tongan images have been collected in Fiji.2 Further confusion has resulted from the misconception that human images do not occur in Fiji, or as one writer has said: 'The Fijians did not, at least within recorded times, ever use images in human form.' 3 The lack of published type specimens has not helped museum authorities or private collectors in identifying Fijian figures when they have been acquired without data.4 The Cambridge images from Fiji, with the excellent Tongan type series figured by Buck, plus the British Museum image from Western Samoa illustrated here as Plate Mc, provide us with specimen types from the three points of the Western Polynesian triangle. After description and discussion of specimens figured, a comparative analysis of Fijian and Tongan images will be given. Plate La-c. No. 25.336: female figure pendant, carved from cachalot-tooth ivory. Overall length io8 cm.; width (at shoulders) 4.5 cm.; depth (at breast) 2 7 cm. The figure was collected in Fiji before I900. However, on the basis of Buck's evidence figures of this type (including those incorporated in the suspension hooks, Plate Ld, e) may safelv be attributed to the Tongan Islands, and prob- ably to a school of craftsmen working in the Haapai group. The stylization of the figure is quite different from that of the necklace figures shown in fig. i. It is suggested here that this necklace represents a Fijian version of the Haapai-type figures in ivory. The near-naturalism of this pendant figure illustrates the unique style of the Haapai carvers, paralleled elsewhere in Polynesia only by some Hawaiian female figures.5 Usually the sex of Oceanic images is marked by genitalia, but in the Haapai images there is full development of secondary sex characters of woman, i.e. full breasts, curved abdomen, and enlarged buttocks. The exaggerated buttocks suggest steatopygia, but in fact this condition was not present in Polynesia, although heroic proportions were cultivated as an ideal of beauty in woman. The Tongan craftsman has ventured as near to nature as he could or cared to, for the broad square shoulders, narrow hips and heavy thighs are merely exaggerations of the prevailing physical type of woman in Western Polynesia. A small lug set to one side of the head suggests that this figure was worn singly as a pendant. It conforms to a Polynesian type of ancestor-pendant series seen in Easter Island, the Marquesas and New Zealand. At first glance it would not appear to bear any relationship with the well- known Maori tiki form, yet in many respects the two are parallel. Reasonably conclusive evidence in support of Tongan provenance for this type of female figure in ivory is provided by a specimen in the Cook collection of the Museum fur Volkerkunde, Vienna. This example, No. I46, is of whale ivory, the length being 6-2 cm. First illustrated by Ratzel, this valuable item has been recently described by Dr. Irmgard Moschner as fig. IO5 (p. 229) in the following work: 'Die Wiener Cook-Sammlung, Siidsee-Teil,' p. I36, Archivfuir Volkerkunde, Vol. X (I955). Another ivory illustrated by Dr. Moschner as fig. Io6 (p. 229) in the same work, closely approximates to the lower part of the suspension-hook god symbol illustrated in Plate Ld. Plate Ld. No. 55.247: suspension-hook god symbol carved from a cachalot tooth. Height I2-3 cm., the two figures approximately 6-i cm.; width (at heads) 5-3 cm., (at base) 4-6 cm. The specimen was presented to Sir Arthur Gordon (later Lord Stanmore), then Governor of Fiji, about I875, by a Fijian called Tavita, who assured him that it was the 'Nadi Devil,' or idol of the Nadi district. Lord Stan- more, son of the collector, deposited the hook in the University Museum of Archaxology and Ethnology in I955. As in Plate La-c and e, the figures indicate that the speci- men is of Tongan origin, from the region of the Haapai group. Of nine light suspension lugs, two have broken away; otherwise all parts are in splendid condition. The colour is the rich amber so much treasured by Fijians, but usually bleached out by continual exposure to light. A string of red, white and blue beads of a type common in Tongan decorative work of the early contact period is attached as a suspension cord. Of three known hooks of this type,6 this is undoubtedly the most important because of its splendid documentation. Theodor Kleinschmidt 7 provides us with information received from Sir Arthur Gordon. This note is so interest- ing and important that it is here given in full: GOVERNOR SIR ARTHUR GORDON 'S NOTE TO THE IDOL FROM THE NADI DISTRICT (Vln-LEVU) Tavita tonight produced and gave to me the 'Nadi Devil,' the idol of the Nadi District. It consists of an ivory-cut out of whale's tooth and representing two women back to back with nine hooks below also of ivory. * With Plates L and M and a text figure.

I65</page><page sequence="4">No. 192 Man DECEMBER, I956 This figure represents 'Na Lila vatu' the double wife of . . . the Chief God of Nadi, by whom it was given to an old priest . . . of... as a Vakadinadina of his priesthood. It or they was or were deposited in a small 'bure' enclosed in a large one of ordinary description. Into the smaller one no man was allowed to enter. It had two doors and the figure stood generally facing both during the day, and was laid in a basket to sleep at night. It stood of itself during the heathen days but since the 'lotu' it fell down and could not be made to do anything it had done before. In olden time it spoke with a thin squeaky voice. Luki has himself heard it when he was a boy. He was passing the 'bure' with a number of some other boys and saw the little figures standing at the door and calling after them in a thin little squeaky voice 'Maiivi ko lako?' and adds he saw them wave their hands. Though generally standing in the 'bure' they would walk about it and sometimes were to be seen at the door and sometimes up in the roof. They detected thefts, naming the thief if properly supplicated to do so, and when they wanted food, they would name a man and squeak out: So and So has not given me food lately, if he does not give food he will die of the 'Lilu.' When the Lotu had come and the virtue of the charm had departed, the image was hidden by the priest under a post in the house. There Nemani found it hidden in a hollow coconut-shell. He kept it at Nawaka and Tavita seems to have appropriated it from him for me. The small 'bure' mentioned is possibly the type of small sennit temple found in many museum collections.8 The- ability to detect thefts and the naming of the thief, with demands for food offerings, suggest priestly craft at work, e.g. the 'thin squeaky voice' sounds suspiciously like ven- triloquism. But with the coming of the 'Lotu,' that is, the church, the mana of the charm departed. The whole account is excellent, and from it we may class this suspen- sion hook with the god symbols. Plate Le. No. Z 2740: suspension hook carved from a single large cachalot tooth. Length I7-8 cm.; width 7-7 cm.; depth 4-8 cm. The specimen was collected in Fiji. Kleinschmidt 7 describes and illustrates the specimen as an 'idol of whale's tooth, in possession of the States Secretary, J. P. Thurston.' The hook differs from Plate Ld in size, arrangement of suspension lugs and colour. In type it is nearer to a third kilown hook of this form, in the col- lection of Marischal College, Aberdeen. All three hooks have the same back-to-back Haapai-style females, and we may assume that the documentation of Plate Ld is evidence that this (and the Marischal College hook) are also god symbols. Plate Lf. No. Z 28I2: female figure, carved in hard- wood; black patination. Overall height 33 cm.; width 9 cm.; depth 5.5 cm. Collected in Fiji by Baron von Hiigel about the year I875. The index card for this speci- men gives the Fijian name as makatau, meaning 'idol,' but the note adds that this was probably a missionary term. This figure may be accepted as typically Fijian. The stylization combines Melanesian with predominating Poly- nesian elements, yet the figure lacks the near-naturalism of Tongan images. A notch under one foot suggests that the figure was formerly attached to a base, which would have enabled it to stand freely. Plate Ma. No. Z 2869: female figure cut in light brown wood. Overall height 52 cm.; width (at shoulders) i6 cm.; depth (at head) II5 cm. The figure was given to Baron von Hiigel about I875 at the Rewa River, Viti Levu, we are told, by 'a pretty half-caste, "kai-loma" girl at (Bau) Mbau, as her portrait.' The heavy split up the centre of the image suggests that unseasoned wood was used, and there- fore it is likely that the figure is later than others in this series. The stylization is strongly in the New Caledonian manner. Plate Mb. No. Z 3 43 I: oil dish in human form. Kingsley Bequest. Length 46-5 cm.; width 28-5 cm. The dish is in perfect condition, rich walnut in colour, with a ripple of lighter grain. A suspension lug occurs above the head. Two supporting legs on the base are in a position which suggests that they represent the nipples of the breast. The transpos- ing or inverting of anatomical features, for example in turtle-form bowls, is common enough in the Fiji-Tonga area, and might well be present in this instance. Several other examples of human-formn dishes from Fiji are to be found in museum collections, but it is doubtful if any is as large, fine, or well preserved as this specimen. Plate Mc. Image from Western Samoa. British Museum collection. The specimen is included here as a comparative example from the third sub-area of Western Polynesia. The measurements are: length 69 cm.; width 22 cm.; depth I5-5 cm. This is an especially rare figure, for it is the only known example from the Samoan group. It was presented to Queen Victoria by King Malietoa of Western Samoa in the year i84I. First figured by Kraemer,9 it. was later considered by Buck, who was of the opinion that the image 'was made locally in Samoa by an inferior artist who was either Tongan or someone who was acquainted with the general appearance of the Haapai images.' I0 This appears the best explanation, for, as Buck says, it is more feasible to accept diffusion from Haapai rather than inde- pendent creation in Samoa. The image approximates to the Haapai stylization, yet there appear to be other in- fluences at work. Plate Md. No. Z 3773: suspension hook with disc, in- corporating male figure. This specimen was collected by Captain Knollys, who was apparently attached to the staff of the Governor of Fiji in the late eighteen-seventies. The hook was purchased from the Knollys collection in i898 by Baron von Hiigel, and later passed into the Cambridge collection. Overall length is 32-5 cm.; at base, 8 cm. A detachable wooden disc rat-baffle measures some 35 cm. across. The stylization of the figure is unique in the series. Considerable distortion appears in the placing of features: for example, breast nipples appear behind the arms, which themselves spring from near the ears. The stylization, while possessing Polynesian elements, is strongly Melanesian, an effect which is again heightened by the matt black patina- tion. Plate,Me. No. Z 3775: suspension hook incorporating a female figure. Collected by Baron von Hiigel in the locality of Na Vuavua, Rakiraki district, Viti Levu. The overall height is 42 cm.; figure 28 cm.; width at base, ii cm. Records give the following particulars: 'Hook for hanging food basket, from Navasa Naitasiri-figure of a man from Vani bau, Navua, Viti Levu. Very hard to get them to part with discs which are tiresome to make.' The figure, however, is undoubtedly female. The stylization of i66</page><page sequence="5">DECEMBER, I956 Man No. i92 the head is of the type commonly seen on the well-known oil dishes of which Plate Mb is an example. The whole is heavily patinated a dense black, which heightens the im- pression of strong Melanesian elements in the carving. Plate Mf. No. Z 2879: head cut from a large image. Collected by Baron von Hiigel about I875, in the locality of Matai Lombau, Wi ni Mala River, Viti Levu. The height is 20 cm.; width i6 cm.; depth i9 5 cm. The colour is dark brown to black. The museum records give the following note: 'This was part of a figure presented to the collector, name of donor unknown, and was separated from the body part on account of transportation difficulties.' The stylization of the head (like that of the body parts of Plate Ma) is strongly New Caledonian in manner. The combination of traceable characteristics would appear to be a feature of Fijian figures in wood. Fig. i. No. Z 2752: necklace comprising eight cachalot- ivorv female figures. Arranged alternately with the figures are nine 'tooth' units, also in ivory. All the elements are suspended from seven sennit cords. The necklace is believed to have been presented to Lady Gordon in Fiji about the year i884. Little information is recorded for this most interesting specimen. Measurements in centimetres for the individual human images in the necklace from left to right (in the fig. i) are as follows: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) J) (g) (h) Height 7.4 8rI 8 i 8-8 9-6 8-8 8v 7-8 Width 3 2 2'9 3'2 3'3 3.4 2-9 2-8 2-8 Depth i-6 I.7 I.7 IP7 2-8 2-3 1.7 i-6 On comparing the human images of this necklace with those figured by Buck, and with the other Cambridge examples, Plate La-e, it is apparent that the stylization is different. The figures are not of the Haapai type, but approximate rather to Fijian figures in wood. On the grounds of this similarity it is reasonable to assume that the necklace is of Fijian manufacture, and not Tongan in origin like most ivories collected in Fiji. If this reasoning is correct, the necklace must assume a place of special importance. The comparative table given below is a tentative attempt, based on available material, systematically to differentiate human images from Fiji and from Tonga. The third sub- area of Western Polynesia, represented by a single figure from Western Samoa, has been considered above and defined as Tongan rather than Fijian in type. The more important differences between the two sub-areas claiming our attention here may be noted as follows: FIJI TONGA (i) Wooden images predom- (i) Ivory images more frequent inant, ivory virtually absent. than wooden.

It need hardly be repeated here that although Fiji is, racially, pre- dominantly Melanesian in character, the culture is predominantly Polynesian, mainly through long contact with Tonga and Samoa. 3 G.

The image is female, in a sitting position, with both legs folded to one side of the body. The plastic modelling is a unique move to naturalism in Polynesian wood sculpture. Unfortunately the specimen is much damaged. See Te Rangi Hiroa, 'Additional Wooden Images from Tonga,' loc. cit., p. 77, fig. 3. 12 No attempt is made to investigate the social and religious sig- nificance of these objects here. Sir Peter Buck has provided adequate knowledge for the Tongan figures, and I understand that Mr. Karl-Erik Larsson of the Etnografiska Museet, G6teborg, is working on the cultural significance of these images within the framework of Fijian society. I3 The evidence ofJohn Williams (Missionary Enterprises, London, I839, pp. 273f., 275) and that for Plate Ld adequately support this conclusion. '4 Three single wooden images from Tonga are in the Oldman Collection (Polynes. Soc. Mem. No. i5, Plates XLV, XLVI and XLVII). The fourth image is a splendid large specimen in the Fuller Collection, London (see the catalogue Traditional Art of the British Colonies (R. Anthrop. Inst., I949), Plate XXII, where it is illustrated with one of the Tongan ivory figures, also from the Oldman Collection and now in the British Museum). It should be noted that innumerable small anthropomorphic motifs appear on carved Tongan clubs, but these have been excluded completely from this study.</page></plain_text>
