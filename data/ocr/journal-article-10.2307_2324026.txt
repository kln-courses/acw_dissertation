Follow the format in current issues. Put your full mailing address in a line at the head of the paper, following the title and the author's name. Send three copies of the manuscript, legibly typewritten on only one side of the paper, double-spaced with wide margins, and keep one as protection against loss. Prepare illustrations carefully, on separate sheets of paper in black ink, the original without lettering and two copies with lettering added. Rough copies of the illustrations should be included in the manuscript at the appropriate places. Supply the full five-symbol Mathematics Subject Classification number, as described in Mathematical Reviews, 1985 and later. (This is necessary for indexing purposes.) All manuscripts whose length is more than 7 manuscript pages should be sent to HERBERT S. WILF, Department of Mathematics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104. Shorter articles about the teaching of mathematics should be sent to either MELVIN HENRIKSEN (linear algebra, algebra, differential equations), Department of Mathematics, Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA 91711, or STAN WAGON (calculus, analysis, number theory, discrete mathematics, statistics), Department of Mathematics, Macalester College, St. Paul, MN 55105. Other shorter articles should be submitted as follows: in algebra, discrete mathematics, or probability, to RODICA SIMION, Department of Mathematics, George Washington University, Washington, DC 20052; in geometry or topology to DENNIS DETURCK, Department of Mathematics, Univer- sity of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104; in analysis to DAVID J. HALLENBECK, Department of Mathe- matical Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716. Papers in other fields may be sent to any of the editors; however, do not send a paper to more than one editor. Proposed problems or solutions should be sent to PAUL T. BATEMAN, MONTHLY Problems, Department of Mathematics, University of Illinois, 1409 West Green Street, Urbana, IL 61801; unsolved problems to RICHARD.
