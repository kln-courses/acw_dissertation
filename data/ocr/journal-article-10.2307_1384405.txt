Y. 11439 A semantic differential administered to liberal, moderate, and conservative laity (N = 511) identified three dimensions of theistic imagery in which a traditional conception of God's goodness, mercy, and justice was dominant. The first dimension, traditional imagery, was strongly related to certainty of belief in God's existence and other orthodox Christian beliefs, as well as to devotionalism and ritual observances. It and certainty of orthodox belief each independently influenced religiosity. A second dimension of anthropomorphic imagery was unrelated to piety, but appeared to reflect cognitive sophistication. A third, bi-polar dimension described lay perceptions of God's immanence and scrutability. Liberals are here separated from conservatives by a lesser preference for traditional imagery (reflecting their greater doubt about orthodox beliefs). Studies of theistic symbolism among Americans have been rare, although the importance of this facet of religious culture, particularly in so theological a faith as Christianity, is presumably great. But while the variable dimension of certainty of belief has been most successfully researched, particularly in the last decade (e.g., Stark &amp; Glock, 1968:25-32) studies of types of conceptions of God have been frag- mentary, although often highly provocative. Research on a third dimension of the respect or awe engendered by God as a constitutive, sacred, or transcendental symbol, is virtually nonexistent, as is research on the social conditions and contexts in which conceptions of God are evoked. Efforts to identify types of conceptions of God among Americans, or to explore the closely related phenomena of beliefs about God, can be found relatively early in the history of American social science (e.g., Pratt, 1907; Chave &amp; Thurstone, 1931), but work on this dimension of theistic symbolism has yet to yield a consistent, codifiable *This paper was presented at the 1970 Annual Meetings of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion in preliminary form. I am indebted to Richard Gorsuch, Benton Johnson, Robin M. Williams, and two anonymous readers for thoughtful comments upon a previous draft.

Few results have been replicated, nor have investigators achieved consensus upon priorities of research problems, methods, or strategies. Many of the findings reported have been fascinating nevertheless. For example, Nunn (1964) noted that some parents tend to use their children's belief in God as a form of social control, warning the child that God knows when he or she misbehaves and that God will punish misdeeds. As adults, such children might be more likely than others to conceive God as a parental figure dispensing justice.' More recently, Swanson (1971) established the existence of variations in the related belief of God's interest in and awareness of individual human acts. Using directed interviews, McCann (1954) questioned 200 adults of diverse religious backgrounds about their beliefs in God. He found, roughly speaking, three major kinds of theistic conceptions: naturalistic-God as a Force or Power in or beyond the universe; spiritualistic-God as an undefined Being or Spirit; and anthropomorphic-God as a person or father, typically couched in personal or pictorial imagery. More systematic methodologies were employed in studies by Spilka, Armatas, and Nussbaum (1964) and by Gorsuch (1968). In these attempts to explore conceptions of God, college students were presented with a series of adjectives and asked to indicate how accurately each term described God. These ratings were then factor analyzed. Both studies uncovered one major theistic conception in which God appears as a comforting, fatherly, helpful, all-wise, matchless, and powerful Being. Gorsuch has characterized this dimension as the "traditional Christian concept of a deity who is a deity and yet is actively concerned for and involved with mankind" (Gorsuch, 1968: 60). Several more limited and less pervasive images also emerged (Gorsuch, 1967), but these differ somewhat in the two studies. Although differences in beliefs about, or conceptions of, God among Americans have been previously described, the reliability of these conceptual dimensions is not well established. The research reported in this paper therefore not only aimed to demonstrate further that different conceptions of God can be identified within American culture, but also to determine how closely the conceptions here identified would resemble those reported in previous investigations. Second, it seems important to explore, as little of the previous research had done, the religious and secular correlates of different theistic conceptions. METHODS As part of a larger study, a semantic differential designed to identify theistic conceptions was included in a self-administered questionnaire mailed to randomly selected members of four Protestant churches in two upstate New York cities. Field work was conducted in two churches in the summer of 1969, and completed after the other two churches were surveyed in the summer of 1970. Two-thirds, or 51 1, of the church members eligible for participation in the study returned completed questionnaires. 1. A number of investigators have attempted to establish a correspondence between images of God and images of parental figures; reliable results have not emerged to date, however. See, for example, Vergote, et al. (1969).</page><page sequence="3">THEISTIC CONCEPTIONS IN AMERICAN PROTESTANTISM 333 Although the members of each congregation were selected randomly, the churches themselves were not. Instead, they were chosen to provide at least one representative of liberal, moderate, and conservative Protestantism. Thus, in the total sample there were 201 members of an independent Congregational church (to represent liberal Protestantism), 157 members of an American Baptist congregation (representing moderate Protestantism), and 125 parishoners from a church affiliated with with the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, as well as 28 members of a small Southern Baptist congregation (thereby including laity affiliated with conservative denominations). Comparisons of respondent and non-respondent data in each of the four church samples suggest that each sample i's adequately representative of the parish population from which it was drawn.2 More importantly, comparisons of statistics from these four congregations with those reported in studies of other congregations affiliated with the same denominations suggest these four churches are representative of their denominations, both in social class composition and intensity of religious involvement.3 In the analyses which follow, all four of the church member samples have been combined. This procedure simplifies the analysis and provides a larger number of cases. Nevertheless, a combined sample has potential shortcomings. Spurious over-all relationships can be found in a composite sample when one or more variables are weighted differently in the sub-samples. To guard against this possibility, all the major analyses conducted with the combined sample were spot checked in the sub-samples. In all instances these checks confirmed the results obtained in the composite sample. As its major measurement device, this study employed a semantic differential (Osgood, Suci, &amp; Tannenbaum, 1957).4 Forty-seven pairs of opposite terms were 2. There is reason to believe that these samples slightly underrepresent inactive laity, older church members, those with less than a high school education, and women. With the exception of the latter bias, these patterns of underrepresentation are common in congregational survey research and are of seemingly negligible influence (c.f., Glock &amp; Stark, 1966: 235-237). Also, the response rates did not vary greatly among the four parishes; they ranged from 62% among the American Baptists and Missouri Lutherans to 74% among the Southern Baptists. 3. Two of the most important concommitants of denominationalism in American Protestantism are differences in social class composition (Niebuhr, 1929: Pope, 1948; Demerath, 1965) and the more recently identified differences in intensity of religious involvement (Glock and Stark, 1965: 86-122). Thus, it is particularly important that the four samples be representative in these two respects of other congregations affiliated with the same denominations. Evidence of such representativeness can be cited. For example, the distribution of annual family incomes among the church members in Glock and Stark's California samples is very similar to the distribution of incomes among the church members in this study. With an upper cutting point of $10,000, 64% of the Congregationalists in this study report an income of at least this; 39% of the American Baptists. 41% of the Missouri Lutherans, and 26% of the Southern Baptists report comparable income levels (c.f., Stark and Glock, 1968: Table 30, p. 97). In like manner, the distributions among the four congregations in this study of belief in God, the Devil, life after death, frequency of church attendance, and the importance attributed to church membership are very similar to the distributions among the same four congregations in Glock and Stark's national and California samples. For example, 43% of the Congregationalists, 72% of the American Baptists, 84% of the Missouri Lutherans, and 93% of the Southern Baptists in this study reported unqualified belief in a personal God; these percentages are within 6 points of Glock and Stark's California samples of church members (1968: Table 2, pp. 28-29). 4. One methodological problem with the semantic differential, as Green and Goldfried (1965) have demonstrated, is the assumption that semantic space is bipolar. Bipolar scales were used in this study to save questionnaire space and respondent time. Unipolar scales might have resulted in slightly more precise findings, but only in the case of the third semantic dimension of this study could the use of unipolar scales substantially affect the content of the results.</page><page sequence="4">334 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION included in the instrument developed here. They were drawn from the lists employed by Spilka, et al., and by Gorsuch, as well as from hymns contained in an interdenominational Protestant hymnal (Kempson, 1955). An effort was also made to include terms appropriate to the dimensions suggested by McCann's work. Altogether, eleven analytically discrete components of the conceptions of God that Protestant laity might actually hold were represented by at least two, and as many as five, pairs of terms. These eleven components (with one example of a pair of opposite terms) were as follows: anthropomorphism (bearded-beardless); immanence (here-there; demeanor (friendly-unfriendly); particularism (American-foreign); potency (almighty-powerless); scrutability (clear-unclear); succor (helpful-unhelpful); morality (honest-dishonest); judication (forgiving-unforgiving); sacredness (infinite-finite); and existence (real-unreal). The scales were randomly ordered in the questionnaire. The forty-seven scales were intercorrelated and the resulting matrix was factored using a principal components solution. The factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 were subjected to a varimax, orthogonal rotation. Analyses were conducted in the composite sample and on a sub-sample comprised of Congregationalists and American Baptists. No significant shifts could be detected in the contents of the principal components obtained in the sub-sample; the results of the analyses performed in the full sample are consequently reported here. RESULTS Three Dimensions of Theistic Conceptions Only the first three factors were of substantial size and are considered here.5 Of these three, the first is the largest. Twenty-nine percent of the total possible variance is explained by the first factor, while only 6% is explained by the second factor, and 4% by the third. As the magnitudes of the factor loadings in Table I indicate, the eleven analytically distinct components of theistic conceptions tend to be fused empirically in various combinations. For example, the scales indexing the morality and judication of "God" both strongly loaded on the first factor. Indeed, because so many of these components clustered here, only one factor of substantial magnitude emerged in this analysis. This result is very similar to the findings reported by Spilka and his associates, and by Gorsuch; only one large factor emerged in their studies also. More importantly, the first factor in all three studies is very similar in content. The first factor loadings in Table 1 indicate that a large number of Protestant laity tends to think of God as simultaneously helpful, trustworthy, true, strong, wise, forgiving, merciful, concerned, 5. The decision to focus upon the first three factors was based upon substantive and methodological considerations. Substantively, the first three were, to the author, clearly interpretable and seemingly familiar within institutionalized Protestantism. Methodologically, the first three were relatively invariant in content, no matter how many factors were rotated; three and six factor rotations produced very similar results. Among the small factors, several were similar to Gorsuch's earlier findings, IV and VII for example. A "wrathfulness" factor, however, did not emerge as such, although three of the adjectives loading on this of Gorsuch's factors (damning, critical, tough) were among the 47 adjective pairs in this study. Another study (Nelsen, et al., 1973), however, replicated the wrathfulness factor in a Southern sample.</page><page sequence="5">THEISTIC CONCEPTIONS IN AMERICAN PROTESTANTISM 335 TABLE 1 SEMANTIC DIFFERENTIAL OF "GOD"-PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS A.

The means and standard deviations of the distributions of responses on each of the scales loading highly on the first factor indicate there was little disagreement among these church members on the appropriateness of this composite image. Furthermore, the limited variance present is largely located on the "positive" end of these scales. Few if any respondents believe that it is appropriate to describe God as, for example, untrustworthy, merciless, foolish, and evil. Following Gorsuch's suggestion, this factor will be referred to as the traditional conception. While the first factor confirms the results of previous factor analytic studies, the</page><page sequence="6">336 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION second appears to tap the kind of anthropomorphic conception McCann identified. The smaller size of the second factor indicates that this may be a much less common and thus secondary component of theistic imagery among Protestant laity. Nonetheless a significant proportion of the Protestants in this study accepted or rejected the description of God as a tall, white, bearded, Protestant male. This image is reminiscent of Sunday School pictures of Jesus and the folk image of God in which He is enthroned on a cloud barbed in a flowing, white robe. The distribution of the responses on each of the scales loading highly on this factor indicates that these respondents either accepted the specific anthropomorphic image outlined above or rejected anthropomorphic imagery altogether. The contents of the third factor in Table 1 suggest that God may also be conceived as simultaneously familiar, here, real, clear, near, and personal, or their opposites. The scales on this factor seldom describe substantive attributes of God or His acts; rather this conceptual dimension appears to deal with God's scrutability and immanence. The positive terms in this conception are reminiscent of the language employed at revival meetings, and more generally of the imagery found in evangelical Protestantism. God as described by one pole of this dimension could easily be experienced in a direct and personal relationship. Unlike the two previous dimensions, this conception is genuinely bi-polar. Some respondents reject a description of God as familiar, here, clear, personal, etc. to characterize Him instead as strange, there, unclear, impersonal, and so forth. This latter pole strongly resembles the "deisticness" factor of Gorsuch (1967, 1968). In this sample of Protestant church members there is ample evidence of the presence of multiple conceptions of God. Three major dimensions emerged, two of which had been identified in previous studies of quite different populations, and none of which is far removed from everyday experience of the contents of popular theologies. These data can be taken to indicate that some church members conceptualize God in traditional, anthropomorphic, and evangelical terms; that others sometimes maintain traditional and evangelical components but reject anthropomorphic imagery; that yet others may employ traditional and anthropomorphic imagery when conceptualizing what is to them an otherwise inscrutable and transcendant deity; and so on. It should be emphasized, however, that only one semantic dimension of substantial size, the first or traditional conception, emerged in this analysis. This is of course partly determined by the fact that the questionnaire contained many more scales tapping this dimension than either the anthropomorphic or evangelical dimensions, as hindsight makes clear. In this study no effort was made to sample statements including the word "God" systematically as they naturally occur in a variety of social contexts-a necessary but not sufficient procedure for establishing the relative size or importance of theistic semantic dimensions among any group of people. Yet it is worth noting that the scales defining the traditional conceptions are those most frequently used in Protestant hymns to modify "God" or some attribute of God.6 The official and 6. Some of the most common adjectives in these hymns were: almighty, merciful, heavenly, eternal, mighty, holy, forgiving, bountiful, dear, tenderest, strong, and great. Although statement-s about God were not systematically sampled in this study, many were taken from the prior work of Spilka and his associates (1964). These investigators drew their adjectives from 205 responses to the open-ended question, "What does God mean to you? Please indicate by defining what the nature of God is."</page><page sequence="7">THEISTIC CONCEPTIONS IN AMERICAN PROTESTANTISM 337 prescribed language of the institutionalized church may indeed promote this "traditional" semantic dimension. When the vast majority of the members of this largely Christian nation claim a belief in God, most could be professing belief in a deity they would describe as strong, wise, concerned, and merciful. Some Religious Correlates of Theistic Conceptions It is possible within this sample to explore further the meaning of these dimensions of conceptualization and the probable social locations of their adherents. These analyses lend support to the contention that traditional theistic imagery is an integral yet independent component of conventional expressions of Protestant piety; they also lend credence to the contention that anthropomorphic imagery is influenced more strongly by secular processes than it is by the traditions of American Protestantism. Nothing, unfortunately, could be ascertained about the correlates of evangelical theistic language. To construct indices for each of the theistic conceptions, three scales with a high loading on one and only one factor were selected, and the scores of each respondent on these scales summed. The first or traditional conception was indexed with the scales unforgiving-forgiving, unhelpful-helpful, and untrustworthy-trustworthy. The scales selected to index the anthropomorphic conception were beardless-bearded, Negro-white, and short-tall. There-here, standing-enthroned, and mysterious-obvious were used to index the third, evangelical semantic dimension. Unfortunately the latter index proved unsatisfactory due to low correlations among items.7 Table 2 reveals clearly that the traditional and anthropomorphic indices relate very differently to common measures of Protestant religiosity. Traditional imagery is positively associated with Glock and Stark's Orthodoxy Index, the importance attributed to church membership, and to self-reports of the frequency of devotional and ritual activities. Anthropomorphic conceptualization, on the other hand, is more common among those who are least active in the organizational life of the church, but it is otherwise unrelated to religious involvement.8 Of particular interest are the relationships reported in Table 2 with Glock and Stark's Orthodoxy Index. In this study, as in their work, the Orthodoxy Index is composed of the summed responses to four items: certainty of belief in the divinity of Christ, in the authenticity of biblical miracles, in the existence of the devil, and in the existence of God. The resulting variable is perhaps best interpreted as a measure of 7. All three indices should be independent of one another as are the principal components they represent. The evangelical index, however, was positively associated with the traditional index. Several efforts to reduce this association to statistical non-significance by changing the items in the index failed. Moreover and more seriously, the intercorrelations among the items in the evangelical index are very low; they range from .12 to .19, compared with .53 to .68 among the items in he traditional index, and .33 to .52 among the items in the anthropomorphic index. 8. The negative relationship between Bible reading and the anthropomorphic conception probably exists because the former is strongly related in these data to participation in parish activities. Bible reading is an imperfect measure of devotionalism as indexed in this study because some laity active in parish educational programs read the Bible at home in preparation for Sunday School classes or adult study groups. Thus, the anthropomorphic conception probably is unrelated to Bible reading as a private devotional act.</page><page sequence="8">338 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION TABLE 2 THESITIC CONCEPTIONS BY RELIGIOUS INVOLVEMENT Gamma Anthro- Traditional pomorphic Orthodoxy Index .55* .07 Belief in God .61* .02 Membership Importance .51* -.10 Home Bible Reading .40* 18* Private Prayer .51* .04 Table Grace .38* -.11 Worship Attendance .34* -.24* Parish Attendance .24* -35* Church Officer .10 -.17 Church Contributions .15 -.37* *In this and all subsequent tables gamma is significantly different from zero at p &lt; .05, two-tailed test using the standard error of gamma. certainty of orthodox belief. Central to this orthodoxy is belief in the literal existence of a supernatural deity who has intervened in human history, most importantly in the person of Christ.9 Thus interpreted, these data indicate that certainty of orthodox belief is strongly associated with the use of traditional theistic language. Parishioners most certain of God's existence describe Him as a strong, wise, concerned, and merciful deity. Within this broad consensus, however, there is disagreement about the appropriateness of anthropomorphic imagery; the anthropomorphic and Orthodoxy indices are unrelated. Because certainty of orthodox belief is strongly associated with other forms of religious involvement (Stark &amp; Glock, 1968: Table 69), it is not surprising that its correlate, traditional theistic imagery, similarly is associated with common devotional and ritual acts. Indeed, the latter relatonships could be spurious. To explore this possibility scores on the Orthodoxy Index were held constant while the relationships between the traditional index and religious involvement were examined once again. In all instances of this test, the associations were reduced, but they were not eliminated. The full set of partial or first order gamma values follows: membership importance, .35; home Bible reading, .26; frequency of table grace, .24; worship service attendance, .21; and parish meetings attendance, .10. Of importance also is the finding that, when scores on the index of the traditional conception are in turn held constant, the relationships between Orthodoxy and religiosity (not reported here) are likewise reduced, although less markedly. These results are unlikely to be a function of differential reliabilities since the internal consistencies reliabilities were .83 and .82 for the traditional and Orthodoxy indices, respectively. 9. This interpretation is consistent with Stark and Foster's finding (1970) that high scores on the Orthodoxy Index among Protestant clergy are associated with conservative and fundamentalist theological self-desig- nations, while low scores are commop among clergy who identify themselves as liberal or neoorthodox in theology. It is also consistent with the results Strommen and his associates report (1972: 77-99) of a factor analysis of religious beliefs which included three items from the Orthodoxy Index.</page><page sequence="9">THEISTIC CONCEPTIONS IN AMERICAN PROTESTANTISM 339 The index of the traditional conception developed in this study apparently is not a sub-component of Glock and Stark's Orthodoxy Index, nor is the reverse true. Although certainty of orthodox belief and traditional theistic imagery are strongly associated with one another, each variable is nonetheless independently related to other expressions of religious involvement. Such results suggest that a conception of God as a deity of truth, strength, wisdom, mercy, and concern is almost as intimately related to other expressions of piety among Protestant laity as is certainty of belief in His existence and His intervention in the course of human history. The pattern of associations reported in Table 2 also occurred in the congregational sub-samples. The distribution of the two theistic conceptions, however, was thought likely to be different among the four churches. The data in Table 3 confirm this. The traditional conception is most common among the Southern Baptists and least so among the Congregationalists. Anthropomorphic conceptualization, however, is equally common in all four congregations, although confined to roughly 25% of the laity in each.

The variable strength of the traditional conception proves to be a function of the distribution of certainty of orthodox belief among these four congregations. In these data, the association between denominational conservatism and Orthodoxy is .70 as expressed by gamma. Southern Baptists are thus more certain of orthodox beliefs than their moderate or liberal counterparts, as well as more likely to endorse traditional theistic imagery. But a close examination reveals that Congregationalists or American Baptists of equivalent Orthodoxy scores are just as likely to accept the traditional conception as are the Lutherans or Southern Baptists. With Orthodoxy controlled, gamma drops from a zero order value of .40 to a first order value of .06. Traditional theistic imagery apparently is distributed among Protestant denominations in proportion to the distri- bution of certainty of orthodox belief. (Because anthropomorphic imagery is unrelated to certainty of orthodox belief, it is unaffected by differences in the strength of the latter from congregation to congregation.) Certainty of orthodox belief here appears to be more fundamental to the New Denominationalism than are differences in conceptions of God. Although laity with a traditional theistic conception are more certain of orthodox belief and more devout in their religious practices, those who adopt anthropomorphic</page><page sequence="10">340 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION imagery cannot be similarly described. Further analysis, however, indicates that the anthropomorphic, unlike the traditional conception, is related to an unusual congeries of sentiments and beliefs. This rather diverse grouping, recorded in Table 4, contains statements which together evidently tap sentiments of passive resignation to social inequities.

The next two suggest that religious standards cannot or should not be differentiated from secular standards of conduct. The last expresses the sentiment that the church should not intervene in secular problems. Although not every church member with anthropomorphic components in his or her conception of God shares these attitudes-in fact, less than 50% of such laymen endorse each of these opinions-there is a clear association between acceptance of this literal theistic image and an apparent reluctance to adopt a critical religious stance toward the quality of life in secular society Some Secular Correlates of Theistic Conceptions One possible interpretation of the associations reported in Table 4 is prompted by the results recorded in Table 5. Here the anthropomorphic conception is more strongly associated with educational attainment than it is with any other variable, religious or secular. It tends also to be more common among older parishioners. A series of three</page><page sequence="11">THEISTIC CONCEPTIONS IN AMERICAN PROTESTANTISM 341 TABLE 5 THEISTIC CONCEPTIONS BY AGE, MARITAL STATUS, SEX AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS Traditional Anthropomorphic Age .01 .14* Marital Statusa .27*(.1 1) .00 (.13) Sexb .15 (.07) .05 (.05) Education -.09 -.33* Subjective Social Class -.17 -.31 * Income -.21 *-.24* aMarital status was coded to give spouseless respondents (widowed, divorced, and single) a higher value than married respondents. bSex was coded to give females a higher value than males.

None were significantly different from zero at p &lt; .05, two-tailed test using the Chi Square distribution. *p &lt; .05 variable tests reveals that the anthropomorphic index is independently related to age, subjective social class, and education. The combined influence of these three variables is moderately strong. Among church members 65 or more years of age without a high school diploma, over 50% endorsed conceptions of God with at least some anthropo- morphic overtones while only 16% of the college educated parishioners under 45 years of age did so. The strength of the association between education and anthropomorphic concep- tualization in particular suggests that the rejection of anthropomorphism may be influenced by practice in complex symbolization. To describe God as male, tall, bearded, white, and Protestant represents an attempt to grasp a difficult abstraction by establishing a correspondence with the familiar and concrete. If this line of analysis is correct, the associations between anthropomorphic imagery and the attitudes presented in Table 4 might thus reflect the presence of a common cognitive style. To conceive it possible to evaluate the nature of American society and the justice of its political order on the basis of independent Christian standards would appear to require greater intellectual sophistication also.It is possible that the anthropomorphic concep- tion is neither influenced by, nor rooted in, Protestant culture as such. Instead it may be most strongly influenced by levels of conceptual sophistication which, in part, are a function of exposure to programs of secular and religious education. Indeed, the anthropomorphic conception was reported above to be negatively associated with attendance at worship service and parish meetings. These relationships, rather tellingly, are not reduced when measures of social class, including education, are held constant; in this as in other studies (e.g., Fukuyama, 1961; Goode, 1966; Campbell &amp; Fukuyama, 1970) class is positively associated with participation in parish affairs. Perhaps the contents of Sunday worship services and of parish activities oriented toward religious education do encourage lay members to reject anthropo- morphic symbolism. Whether or not this analysis of the origins of anthropomorphic conceptualization is correct, it is clear in Table 5 that traditional imagery is less strongly associated with</page><page sequence="12">342 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION major secular statuses. It can only be said to be somewhat more common among laity with smaller incomes. The absence of associations between the traditional index and these statuses is surprising because certainty of orthodox belief and other common expressions of piety are normally reported to be greater among older, spouseless, female, and bluecollar laity than among their counterparts (e.g., Fukuyama, 1961; Glock, Ringer, &amp; Babbie, 1967; Campbell &amp; Fukuyama, 1970). This is not so with traditional theistic imagery. Moreover, further analysis reveals the association between income and the traditional conception to be a spurious reflection of the negative relationship between socio- economic status and certainty of orthodox belief. With Orthodoxy controlled, the relationship drops from -.21 to .00. Whatever the secular sources of variation in belief in a just and benevolent deity may be, these data indicate they are not to be found in the differential experience of life associated with sex roles, age groups, or social class positions. DISCUSSION Do the vast majority of Americans who profess a belief in God hold the same conception? The results of this research suggest the advisability of a qualified response. Certainty of belief in the existence of a personal God among Protestant church members does appear to be strongly associated with faith in a trustworthy, strong, wise, and merciful deity. It appears probable that in this respect Americans who believe in God do share a common conception. But this research also suggested the presence of two additional sub-dimensions of theistic conceptualization, both of which were more or less independent of certainty of belief among Protestant laymen. There is evidence that Americans who are most certain of the existence of God do differ in their willingness to conceptualize Him anthropomorphically and in their confidence that He can be experienced in a direct and highly personal relationship. The structure of theistic imagery which emerged in this study was one of multiple dimensions, dominated by a unipolar mode of largely substantive content. That these dimensions were independent of one another is a function of the statistical model employed, particularly the use of an orthogonal rotation. Whether a model providing measures of non-orthogonal dimensions might prove more useful for understanding such cultural phenomena was not assessed. But it is likely that theistic imagery in American culture is dominated by what has here been termed a traditional conception. This dimension, invoking as it does the majesty and mercy of God, is evidently rooted in traditional Judeo-Christian culture. In this study it was shown to be strongly associated with certainty of belief in God as well as certainty of belief in orthodox Christian doctrine more generally; it also appears to be characteristic of the images of God found in Protestant hymns. It was, furthermore, positively associated with traditional expressions of piety, including acts of private devotion and public worship. While the first and seemingly most important semantic dimension is strongly influenced by certainty of belief in traditional Christian doctrines about the supernatural, the second dimension seems to reflect levels of conceptual sophistication. Anthropomorphic imagery may be less a product of piety than it is of</page><page sequence="13">THEISTIC CONCEPTIONS IN AMERICAN PROTESTANTISM 343 capacities for complex symbolization. Finally, the third dimension, the most elusive in this research, could be tapping differences in modes of apprehension of God. At least this dimension appears to describe whether God can be known in a direct, personal relationship or whether he remains obscure, mysterious, and, relative to empirical objects, unknown. As religious variables, concepts of God appear to have some utility. The traditional conceptual dimension, for example, was related to other forms of religious belief and behavior independently of certainty of orthodox belief. However, the results of this study suggest that certainty of orthodox belief may constitute a more important component of theistic symbolism than does type of conception. Certainly, it appears significant that differences in the strength of traditional theistic imagery between Protestants affiliated with liberal, moderate, and conservative denominations disappear in these data when certainty of orthodox belief is held constant. Certainty of belief, not type of conception, may be the more fundamental issue in the New Denominationalism.
