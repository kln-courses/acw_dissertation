<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES NATURAL VALUE KENNETH L. SCHMITZ J. HE THEME, "The Intelligibility of Nature," is exceedingly broad. It stretches like a vast domain in which one can only hope to leave a few footprints, some fragile impressions that are all but lost in the expanse. In attempting to understand the natural world, the enterprise that is most familiar to many of us is inherited from the Greeks and their Latin heirs, both classical and mediaeval, and this enterprise continues in our own day in the form of the modern sciences of nature. Nowadays, we are more informed about the knowledge acquired by the Egyptians, Babylonians, and others prior to the Greeks. We are more conscious of the achieve ments of the Chinese in physics and the Indians in mathematics. And we are more aware of the medical and zoological lore present in oral traditions, such as those of Africa. Moreover, we are only now beginning to appreciate their contributions and their potential for new forms of enquiry, including other ways of approaching nature. The terms in which the topic is here designated, however, are conceived in Greek and expressed in Latin. Nevertheless, even within this cultural tradition of natural enquiry, the topic is quite broad enough. Like a grammarian of old parsing a sentence, I am forced to begin by distinguishing parts of the theme. Speaking in the most general terms, we can distinguish the various branches of the study of nature as part of a whole system of inter-related knowledges. Thus, we have the central sciences of nature: physics with its cognate fields, including chemistry, along with some aspects of biology, and astronomy. This division still reflects the material differentiation within the study of nature between terrestrial and celestial realms. It is a truism, however, that today these boundaries are becoming increasingly artificial. And so, for example, knowledge gained in astrophysics or in Review of Metaphysics 38 (September 1984): 3-15.

Then, too, if we gather up the diverse terrestrial and celestial fields of study into an organization of special sciences, we can still distinguish this set of special sciences from the renewed interest in cosmologyr, i.e., in scientific speculation about the physical universe taken as a whole. For in the twentieth century there has been an intense discussion of the structure, origin, and finality of the universe qua cosmos.1 Then, too, there is philosophy of science and philosophy of nature (a not undisputed discipline), both of which bring to the investigation of nature an inquiry into funda mental conceptions of space, time, motion, and matter, an inquiry that underlies even the foundational disciplines of theoretical physics and applied mathematics. And finally, there are the heuristic disciplines, such as those of pure mathematics and logic, which make an essential contribution to the attempt to understand nature. After such a catalogue, the initial image of a vast expanse seems to have given way to that of an almost impenetrable thicket in which a variety of growths obscure our view of the whole of nature, so that we lose the forest entire in the clumps of trees. It is the task of the cosmologist among the scientists and of the philosopher of nature among the philosophers to restore to us that vision of the whole insofar as it can be done within the knowledge that we have. Nevertheless, in this highly differentiated and manifold approach to the study of nature?at once many levelled and many-vectored?and within the traditions of enquiry stemming from the Greeks, it seems to me that we have drawn upon three, and only three, architectonic modes of discourse in our long attempt to come to an understanding of the physical universe. They are the mathematical, the historical, and the ontological ways of explanation, i.e., in terms of numerical values, temporal events, and ontological realities, respectively. A sustained consideration of the intelligibility of nature would require that we 1 See, for example, The Rebirth of Cosmology, by Jacques Merleau Ponty (a philosopher who has specialized in cosmology and in the history and epistemology of physics) and Bruno Morando (resident astronomer at the Central Astronomical Office in Paris and specialist in celestial mechanics), a translation of Les trois ?tapes de la cosmologie by Helen Weaver (New York: Adolf Knopf, 1976).</page><page sequence="3">NATURAL VALUE 5 distinguish these modes of explanatory discourse, determine their limits and recognize the relationships between each of them as contributions to a comprehensive understanding of nature. In that way we might have an adequate context within which to address the question of natural value, i.e., of objective value in nature.2 The infant steps of recent astronomy provide enough faint light to illumine our ignorance of a universe that seems to respect none of the boundaries of our limited knowledge. Nor can philos ophy of nature remain unaffected by this ignorance, whereby we come to know what we did not, even while we are compelled to unlearn what we thought we knew. Indeed, the natural sciences and the cosmological theories which arise from them show us a universe of which we have a radically incomplete knowledge. It is incomplete in three senses. First of all, it is quantitatively incomplete. We read of an "expanding" universe in theory, and in fact radioastronomers receive fresh data almost daily from ever more remote regions of space. During the past sixty years, distance, time and motion have acquired magnitudes that are quite literally unimaginable, though not inconceivable. There has come about a growing appreciation of the complexity of structure and process in physical nature. That complexity points up the qualitative incompleteness of our knowledge. But, surprisingly, this staggering amount of knowledge does not advance us a single step towards knowing the ultimate meaning of the universe as a whole, though it almost certainly has implications for such a meaning. Specifically, such knowledge does not disclose the sig nificant (as distinct from the local) position of man in the universe. And so, our knowledge remains significantly incomplete. It thereby tempts us to fall back upon "man alone" as the fundamental focus and source of meaning and value, with results that are ambivalent, dubious and sometimes disastrous, not only for man's environment but for personal and social values as well. This last sort of 2 The term "value" has historical associations with subjectivism, but I do not consider the term to be beyond rehabilitation. At any rate, as we shall see, the term contains a reference to "measure"; and so it seems to me that the term "natural value" signifies a measure that is lodged within nature itself. In this sense, then, "value" is equivalent to "worth" (tim?) and to "good" (bonum).</page><page sequence="4">6 KENNETH L. SCHMITZ incompleteness stems in part from the particular form of objectivity that has been sought by the sciences in the modern era. For although many scientists are becoming aware of values and of the implications of value in their research, the epistemology of the natural sciences in its general lines is still "value-neutral." By these remarks I do not intend in any way to suggest that the scientific study of nature become less objective. On the contrary, it must strive to be even more objective by including within it explicitly all of the factors operative in its on-going inquiry. This includes the factors introduced by the inquiring subject, such as the purposes of the inquiry, the selection of methods, the context pre-determined by the inquirer and similar considerations.3 It may be that the whole set of sciences of nature and scientific cosmology needs to continue in a purportedly "value neutral" manner; but then, some variant of natural philosophy is called for in order to face up to the question of value in nature as a whole. The full range and nature of value as such cannot be recognized as long as we continue to restrict its consideration to human value, and to the human sciences of psychology, anthro pology and sociology. Something can often be learned from a scrutiny of the initial phase of an enquiry. The name of Aristotle ought to be honoured among students of nature, even though many of his particular conclusions are unacceptable today. An editor and translator of Aristotle remarks that Aristotle's attempt to understand nature was something less than scientific, because he failed to appreciate the necessity of experimental confirmation of explanatory hy potheses;4 whereas another remarks on the presence of consider ations of value (tim?) in all of Aristotle's argumentation.5 The first comment is undoubtedly correct, but it is the second?the recognition of value in nature (physis) and in the study of nature (physike)?that deserves our attention. Let us turn to Aristotle, 3 For an ontological consideration of these factors, see my "Another Look at Objectivity," Thomas and Bonaventura A Septicentenary Com memoration, Proceedings of the American Catholic Philosophical Asso ciation, Vol. XLVIII, Washington, 1974, pp. 86-98. 4 H.

Heinemann, [1939] 1960), pp. xi-xv.</page><page sequence="5">NATURAL VALUE 7 then, in order to see how value, or more properly, worth (tim?) is present in his reasoning and conclusions.6 The subject of Aristotle's study of nature comprises the natural kinds and motion. Aristotle tells us that "all natural [as distinct from artificial] bodies and magnitudes are capable of moving themselves in space; for we have defined nature as the principle of motion in them."7 The study of the various natural kinds involves him in the description and explanation of the generic and specific kinds, and also in the kinds of qualities, motions and elements. Now, the doctrine of elements (ta stoicheia) plays a major role in his study of nature. They are the ultimate simple distinctions of kind that enter into the composition of natural bodies. Aristotle follows a typical mode of argumentation when, for example, he gives his account of the origin and nature of the comets,8 or why 6 See Whitney J. Oates, Aristotle and the Problem of Value (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1963). The study is valuable, even though I do not accept its primary thesis: "When Aristotle rejected the basic metaphysical theory of his master Plato, viz., the Theory of Ideas, he developed an empiricist metaphysics which permitted him to build upon the logical aspect of Plato's Ideas, and at the same time to make startling advances in ontology and epistemology, but which prevented him from coming to grips adequately with the problem of value in its relation to being" (p. 4). Although Oates warns us rightly against projecting "modern modes of thought and speculative contexts of value-thinking" into Aristotle, it seems to me that the modern conception of value-free thought is operative in Oates's own work. As distinct from the historian's task of interpreting Aristotle, the philosophical danger is not of intro ducing modernisms, but of not being conscious that one is doing so. Oates finds an incoherence in Aristotle, brought about by "the absence of any comprehensive metaphysical ground for his value judgments" (p. 6). Quite to the contrary, I find a consistent doctrine of value?not without its ambiguities and unresolved problems?rooted throughout Aristotle, and pervasively throughout his natural philosophy. Guthrie, ibid., writes: "Proceeding from circumference to centre, we find bodies of an ever-decreasing degree of divinity, permanence, form, and all the other attributes believed by Aristotle to endow a substance with worth (tim?); for the concept of value is never absent from his philosphy." See De c?elo I, 2, 269bl5; IV, 3, 310bl4 and 4, 312al5; De gen. et. corr., 335al8. 1 Dec?elo I, 2, 268bll-21. 8 Thus, regarding the comets he argues: "We have laid down that the outer part of the terrestrial world, that is, of all that lies beneath the celestial revolutions, is composed of a hot dry exhalation [from the earth]. This and the greater part of the air which is continuous with and below it are carried round the earth by the movement of the circular</page><page sequence="6">8 KENNETH L. SCHMITZ there must be an incorruptible element (aither), or why the four elements are moved by a natural motion towards a proper place in the physical world.9 These conclusions are for the most part unacceptable to us today, but his mode of argumentation is still instructive, and some of his more remote and general premises are, I think, true. In his physical argumentation, Aristotle proceeds at three levels: first, there are special factors and reasons which are drawn from observations and particular understandings of natural phe nomena; these are often of a qualitative sort, such as his view that fiery exhalations emanate from the earth, or the optical view that the comets are nearer to us than we in fact now know them to be. Secondly, there are general intuitions about the shape and move ment of things, such as the primacy of circularity both with regard to figure and to movement. These are broadly rational consider ations, usually of a mathematical sort with strong elements of rational and aesthetic satisfaction. Thirdly, there are general principles of physics and metaphysics, such as those of matter and form, the nature of the primary ontological unit, and the universality of actuality and potentiality. It seems to me that his argumentation sometimes fails for us particularly in regard to the first two sorts of reasons, i.e., insofar as he appeals to qualitative and mathematical principles. But the criticism launched by the sixteenth century,10 and usually assumed in modern scientific inquiries, does not touch the most fundamental principles of Aristotle's reasonings. They may be false, or without significance, but that has not been shown; nor is it the task of any of the special sciences to undertake such a critique. That belongs to philosophy, and ultimately to metaphysics. Now, it is just these revolution. . . . Now when as a result of the upper motion there impinges upon a suitable condensation a fiery principle . . . and when besides there coincides with it an exhalation from below of suitable consistency; then a comet is produced, its exact form depending on the form taken by the exhalation . . ." (Meteorol?gica I, 7, 344a9-344b9). 9 For the fuller explanation of the two types of comet, see ibid.; see also Meteor. I, 3, 340b30-341a9, for his reasoning why clouds do not form in the upper atmosphere but only in the lower. 10 See my "Analysis by Principles and Analysis by Elements" in Graceful Reason: Essays in Ancient and Medieval Philosophy Presented to Joseph Owens, ed.

(i) Aristotle usually begins his physical argumentation with observations, often keenly described, though sometimes reported. This is the moment of historia.11 (ii) There immediately arise problems (aporiai, dubia), sometimes because of discordances with what he has been led to expect, sometimes because of ascertained facts that need further explanation, (iii) Aristotle usually reviews the various hypotheses offered by previous thinkers. More often than not he rejects them, giving his reasons, or he singles out parts of them for retention in his own solution, (iv) Then there comes an important initiative on his part; for he places the ascertained fact and the attendant problem in the more general context of his thought. Let us look at the context in which he situates a problem such as that of the origin and nature of comets. The context of his reasoning is the structure of the cosmos as he understands it. There is, first of all, the rotation of the heavens. Aristotle finds it to be uniform, regular, and?with the exception of the planets? circular. Now, along with his contemporaries and predecessors, Aristotle was able to observe these characteristics of celestial motion, as we can on any starry night. But he also gives reasons for the circular character of the motion.12 We find those reasons succinctly stated in a work from a later follower.13 They come down to the completeness of circular motion: for the circle contains 11 Cf. Historia animalium I, 6, 491al2. 12 De c?elo I, 2, 269al9ff. 13 Mechanica 848all-848a38, in Aristotle: Minor Works, Loeb Classical Library (London: W. Heinemann, 1936): "The most remarkable fact is the combination of opposites with each other. The circle is made up of such opposites, for to begin with it is composed both of the moving and of the stationary, which are by nature opposite to each other. . . . [Furthermore] in the circumference of the circle which has no breadth, an opposition of the kind appears, the concave and the convex. These differ from each other in the same way as the great and small; for the mean between these latter is the equal, and between the former is the straight line. ... [A second] peculiarity of the circle is that it moves simultaneously in opposite directions; for it moves simultaneously for wards and backwards, and the radius which describes it behaves in the same way; for from whatever point it begins, it returns again to the same point; and as it moves continuously the last point again becomes the first in such a way that it is evidently changed from its first position."</page><page sequence="8">10 KENNETH L. SCHMITZ within it the contraries of limit and endlessness (so that it alone can be in eternal movement); its motion is a return to every point along its path and so to every beginning and every end. Its completeness, then, is to be found in its very refusal to end. So that the circle itself is the mathematical expression of a richer completeness. We will soon see what that is. The movement of the heavenly sphere with its fixed stars plays a primary role in all movement in the heavens and in the sublunary region, including movement in the atmosphere and on the earth. And these movements play their role, too, in such phenomena as the gener ation of comets. All sublunary movement involves the transformation and combination of the elements, (a) The bodies that we see are taken to be composed of the four elements. Aristotle seems to have arrived at the elements by beginning with two pairs of qualities: the hot and the cold, on the one hand, and the dry and the moist, on the other.14 (b) He then seems to have combined the four qualities and associated them with the primitive typology (of earth, air, fire and water) that had come down to him from the ancients. This material identification gave him the four elements, understood to be characterized according to four possible combi nations: the earth-like combination of cold and dry, the water-like combination of cold and moist, the air-like combination of hot and moist, and the fire-like combination of hot and dry. (c) But now an even more portentous step is taken. Aristotle orders or arranges the four primitive qualities so that they stand as the active to the passive (ta poi?tikay ta path?tika), and more funda mentally yet, as actuality (energeia) to potentiality (dynamis). We have now reached the ground for determinations of value or worth (time). We ought not to hurry over this division of the elements, therefore, for it can teach us more. There is, first of all, an external relationship between the elements. That is, the "hot" elements (the airy and the fiery) are "higher" than the "cold" elements (the earthy and the watery), not only with regard to 14 It is interesting to notice that these pairs of qualities bear at least a distant analogy with the basic conceptions of modern physics: those of energy and mass?the category of energy encompassing both the presence of heat and its absence, and that of mass encompassing the solid and fluid states of matter.</page><page sequence="9">NATURAL VALUE 11 position or place, but also according to nature (kata physin). Indeed, it is not too much to say that in Aristotle's cosmology they are higher in place just because they are superior in nature,15 though we have yet to determine in what that superiority lies. We ought to notice, too, that we have here in the opposition of heat and cold, not an active-passive relationship, but one of contrariety, a relationship that is a formal relationship in Aris totle's sense of the term, and which reduces fundamentally to that of being and non-being. On the other hand, we also have an intrinsic, constitutive relation, a relation that enters into the very make-up of each element, viz., the relation of the active contraries to the passive contraries. The former (ta poi?tika) are active by the presence or absence of heat, i.e., by the influx, maintenance or withdrawal of a determinate mode of actuality; the passive contraries (ta path? tika) are determined through the same influx, maintenance or withdrawal. The priority of the active contraries is translated more broadly into a relation of act and potency (energeia and dynamis).16 Now, there seem to be several criteria for measuring value or worth in Aristotle. The first measure is that of completeness. From this there follows the primacy of what is self-sufficient in a given order. Thus, substance is somehow "more" being than accident, because it is more "self-contained." In the physical order, i.e., in the order of elements and motion, the primary ontological unit (tode ti) is itself a real complexity of the active and the passive, a primary unity of the actual and the potential. It is this complex unit that is the root of the study of kinds (ti) in nature. So that the study of things in their kinds stands in essential connection with the study of their motion. We might well ask why Aristotle grasps the understanding of nature as a physics. He asks: How did what is, i.e., the obvious things that are?how did they come to be? And he answers: They came to be 15 This isomorphism between position and value is one which we no longer accept?at least in nature. 16Guthrie (ibid.) remarks that "the motion (phora) of an element towards its proper place may be expressed in terms which show it to be only an instance of the wider formula descriptive of every sort of change (kinesis), as the actualization of a potency, or the final (310b32) stage in the progress from matter to form. Only in its proper place is an element fully actual."</page><page sequence="10">12 KENNETH L. SCHMITZ by a process (genesis) and by causes operative as principles of that process. Now, why did he put the question that way? It was because he grasped the individual as primary, yet as a complex whole (tode ti). That complex whole was interpreted as the composite of act and potency, yet as a "composition" that was more primary in the real order than its principles. And so, whereas Aristotle did write a most influential cosmology, still it was not his primary science, not even in the realm of nature. His founding question is directed rather towards the real units within the ordered whole (cosmos). Those units are not simple; they are composite, a concrete matter-form relationship, involving the ti, the kind, as the terminus from which to understand the primary units. Even the elements are primitive "kinds" that, at least for a time, give up their self-sufficiency even as they enter into the concrete formation of the primary ontological units. The second measure of value or worth in Aristotle is that of immateriality and immutability, i.e., the graded remotion from matter and motion. "Thus," Aristotle writes in defence of a fifth element, "the reasoning from all of our premises goes to make us believe that there is some other body separate from those around us here [viz., aither, the fifth element], and of a higher nature [timi?teran . . . ten physin] in proportion as it is removed from the sublunary world [of ordinary matter and motion]."17 And, as we know from the Physics and Metaphysics, ultimately, the pure intelligences, are entirely without matter and motion?highest and best, very gods in their own being. The third measure of value or worth in Aristotle is that of actuality, taken as energeia and/or entelecheia (i.e., taken as a principle [arche] and not as a result, as fact, Wirklichkeit, etc.). And so, to the criterion of completeness, we must add that of priority; it is a priority based not upon temporality, nor upon position, but upon nature (kata physin). We need to ask, therefore, in what "the priority according to nature" consists. The most familiar natural priority in Aristotle is that of form to matter; but in the context of the physics of movement we need to think of priority in terms of motion. There is no doubt that the relation is one of the determinative to the determinable. It is here that remotion from matter and remotion from motion itself provides 17 De c?elo I, 2, 269M4-17.</page><page sequence="11">NATURAL VALUE 13 us with a first indication of a priority based upon the ontology of the related factors. First of all, straight-line motion is not self sufficient, because it does not contain its opposites within itself and stands in need of some other motive force to account for it. On the other hand, the cyclical movement of the heavenly spheres is a remotion not from movement itself but from straight-line movement (already subordinated because it is potentially infinite and so radically incomplete). Now Aristotle is not content with this two-tiered movement: and he argues in the Physics and the Metaphysics that the movement itself requires a source, and ultimately an underived, unmoved source. Precisely because it transcends motion, such an unmoved source does not contain within itself a subject of motion, i.e., it lacks a body and is pure incorporeal determinativeness, pure immaterial form. To be sure, it does not transcend the cosmos, as the Christian creator God does, who is intimately present in the world just because he is not "part" of the world he has created. Nevertheless, pure actual determinacy does transcend the highest movement within the cosmos, the movement of the celestial spheres. Such an unmoved source is more than the relation of form to formable, however; it is that of mover to moveable. That is to say, it is a relation of power. So that the actuality (energeia) of the unmoved source(s) is fused with perfect form(s). And thus, to the criteria of completeness and immateriality we must add the priority of actuality to potentiality, the priority of determinacy to determin ability. We are now in a position to recognize that value is not relative merely to human relationships, nor even to natural ones, and that value is ingredient in the absolutely foundational relationship of determinacy to determinability throughout the cosmos: in the elements, between the elements, among natural things, among the levels of reality and in the highest forms of being itself. The relationship of priority and posteriority (taken according to nature as the determinative to the determinable) already inscribes in the roots of all process a tendency towards completion: entelecheia in the broadest sense. So that priority according to nature is already a measure of progress with respect to the relevant process. An objective standard is thereby built into nature and nature's motion: this is the inherent natural value. According to Aristotle, motion itself is ordered towards com pletion. It is ordered towards completion in the order of perfect</page><page sequence="12">14 KENNETH L. SCHMITZ motion itself, since all motion is brought to completion in the circular, eternally repetible motion of the heavens; and it is ordered towards completion in the order of imperfect motion and rest, since all straight-line motion in the sublunary sphere is completed in the movement of elements towards rest at the places to which they are ordained according to their nature. We accept neither the privileged status of circular motion nor the topology of natural places in today's cosmology. Yet, it remains a worth while task to take up specific arguments and conclusions in Aristotle's treatises on nature?not as venerable antiquities?but in order to recognize in detail the limited observational basis of the particular considerations, as well as their mathematical and rational assumptions. These observations and assumptions led Aristotle towards a theory of spherical rotation and of natural places. In critically sifting Aristotle's reasonings, we not only relativize our own observations and assumptions, but we liberate more fundamental principles at the source of Aristotle's thought, and read nature and nature's motions once again in terms of determinacy and determinability, in terms of an ordered priority of actuality to potentiality that is the ground and source of natural value. The priority according to nature that provides the measure of ontological value or worth, then, is the priority of form (eidos) and of actual determinacy (energeia). Moreover, according to Aristotle, even in nature various specific determinacies point towards pure immaterial form, as the source of motion. But pure immaterial form qua actual is empowered; and so, for Aristotle, pure immaterial form is necessarily not only intelligible but actively intelligible, and thus, intelligent. In Aristotle's philosophy there can be no intelligibility without intelligence. It is a theorem worth considering before rejecting it as anthropomorphic. If it is true, then matter, body, process, and natural form all point to and take their measure from intelligence. This intelligence is not human but cosmic; it is the active principle that grounds the intelligibility of nature itself.18 Aristotle seems to have remained 18 It is just here, of course, that Hegel's Philosophy of Nature casts its lot with a self-determining and self-determinable principle (Spirit); but that is another story. On the other hand, Thomas Aquinas finds the source of motion in the creative ontological causal principle (God as Actus Purus)\ but that, too, is another story.</page><page sequence="13">NATURAL VALUE 15 with the general relationship of transcendental intelligibility to active intelligence. After him, others went further and specified the active intelligence: for example, the neo-Platonic nous, the Christian creator ex nihilo, the Arabic separated intellect, and the dialectical Geist. It is a small step from the self-thinking thought of Aristotle to the other-knowing thought of a Creator or Geist, and it may be true to take it; but the step is big with consequences, and Aristotle seems not to have taken it. Moreover, it seems to me that the initial task in attempting to determine the objectivity of value in nature is to consider the relation between intelligibility and intelligence as the primary ground for the value or worth of nature, without specifying it further for the moment. For Aris totle, pure intelligence is the ground in virtue of which the things of nature are intelligible, for they are ordained towards intelligence in their very make-up. It is this ordination to their ground that accounts for their capacity of disclosure, i.e., of intelligibility and of truth. It is this ordination that provides an imperative within them which the human intelligence must respect in its enquiry: viz., that their truth is a value in itself before it is a value for us. It is this imperative, this demand for respect, that manifests the intrinsic value of nature itself. It is this relationship of things to their ground that is reflected in the history of human enquiry into nature, although that history is obscured often enough by the human desire to dominate nature by force. Acknowledgement of the respect due to nature is at the very center of Greek theoria. But this ordination to ground is also the capacity of nature itself to respond to the promptings of intelligent inquiry. It is because the human intelligence is attuned to this transcendental capacity in things?their intelligibility, their capacity for being taken up into a truth relationship?that our intelligence is enabled to engage in investigation into the very nature of nature itself. It is this common bond with things that is the source of the deepest values of the human intelligence and of human life itself. Trinity College, University of Toronto</page></plain_text>
