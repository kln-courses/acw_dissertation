<plain_text><page sequence="1">LA^DSERSPRACHE, HEERESSPRACHE, NAZISPRACHE? VICTOR KLEMPERER AND WERNER KRAUSS ON THE LINGUISTIC LEGACY OF THE THIRD REICH In I947 Victor Klemperer (i881-1960) and Werner Krauss (1900-76) each published a contribution to the continuing discussion of the linguistic legacy of the Third Reich in postwar Germany. These were Klemperer's seminal and still controversial book LTI: Notizbuch eines Philologen (Berlin: Aufbau Verlag, 1947) and Krauss's essay 'Uber den Zustand unserer Sprache', Die Gegenwart, 2.3/4 (1947), 29-32.1 Their analyses of the issue invite attention for at least two reasons. First, their conclusions differ radically despite certain astonishing similarities between the respective authors' professional lives and experience of the Third Reich and postwar Germany. Second, despite their obvious relevance to the agonized linguistic soul- searching of the new generation of younger postwar German authors, particularly those subsequently associated with a putative Kahlschlag, these two studies by Klemperer and Krauss failed to register with those writers worried about the possible persistence of National Socialist language as the vehicle of National Socialist values in postwar literature. After comparing the experiences of Klemperer and Krauss that informed LTI and ZS respectively, this article first compares the conclusions of the two studies and then examines their relevance to the discussion in postwar literary circles as to the possible linguistic legacy of the Third Reich. After completing his Habilitation on Montesquieu under Karl Vossler at the University of Munich in 19I4 and thereby initiating a lifelong interest in and dedication to the study of the French Enlightenment, Klemperer saw front-line military service from November I9I5 to March 1916 before being transferred for the rest of the Great War to the Military Censor's Office. From 1920 to 1935 he was Professor of Romance Philology at the Technical University of Dresden. Between I933 and I935 Klemperer, like all Jews in the professions, was progressively deprived of all civil rights and professional status by the Nazis. Naturally and inevitably he developed the strongest possible anti-Nazi sentiments without, however, ever becoming involved in any active form of resistance against them. His diaries of the period now provide one of the most acutely observed records of the Jewish experience of Nazi Germany.2 Klemperer returned to the Soviet occupation zone of Germany immediately after the war. Although he had for many years been an outspoken critic of Soviet Communism, seeing in it a left-wing totalitarianism differentiated from Fascism only by the apparent absence of racist ideology, Klemperer joined the KPD in November 1945, manifestly moved not by any genuine optimism or political conviction but by the despairing hope that only Communism, the lesser of two totalitarian evils, could effectively challenge the Nazi legacy in Germany and References are to the currently most accessible sources: Victor Klemperer, LTI: Notizbuch eines Philologen (Leipzig: Reclam, 1996), abbreviated to LTI, and the reprint of 'Uber den Zustand unserer Sprache' in Werner Krauss, Die Innenseite der Weltgeschichte: Ausgewdhlte Essays uber Sprache und Literatur, ed. by Helga Bergmann (Leipzig: Reclam, I983), abbreviated to ZS, pp. 43-56. 2 Victor Klemperer, Ich will Zeugnis ablegen bis zum letzten: Tagebiicher I933-45, ed. by Walter Nowojski, with Hadwig Klemperer, 2 vols (Berlin: Aufbau Verlag, 1995).</page><page sequence="2">RODERICK H. WATT Europe.3 For the rest of his life, although never an enthusiastic or convinced Marxist, he contributed actively to the cultural (re-?)construction of the GDR. Between 1945 and 1954 he held Chairs of Romance Philology successively at the Universities of Dresden, Greifswald, Halle, and East Berlin, being awarded the Nationalpreis der DDR in I952, and appointed to the GDR's Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften in I953. In I947 he published his analysis of the influence of Nazi ideology on the German language, LTI: Notizbuch eines Philologen, using material collected for his diaries during the Third Reich, a book that rapidly achieved something approaching canonical status in the GDR.4 Krauss studied in Spain from 1922 to 1926, developing his first interest in Marxism during his active political involvement with anarchist and left-wing groups there. He returned to Germany, completed his doctorate on medieval Spanish literature for Karl Vossler in Munich in I929, and worked as a Privatdozent of Romance Philology at Marburg University from 1931 to 940. After the Nazis came to power Krauss became increasingly involved in left-wing, anti-government circles. In 1940 he was called up for military service and sent to Berlin to train interpreters, and while there he quickly became an active member of Harro Schulze-Boysen's cell of the Rote Kapelle resistance group. He was arrested on 24 November i942, charged with treason, and sentenced to death on I8 January I943. The death sentence was eventually commuted, and Krauss spent the rest of the war in prison. While under sentence of death Krauss wrote his cryptic satire of the Nazi regime, PLJ: Die Passionen der halykonischen Seele, which was first published by Vittorio Klostermann in Frankfurt a. M. in I946.5 After the war Krauss returned to Marburg as Professor of Romance Philology in I945 and almost immediately joined the KPD in July of that year. Unlike Klemperer, Krauss was, at that time at least, a more committed and enthusiastic member of the KPD. While in Marburg he was one of the co-editors of the influential though short-lived journal Die Wandlung. In that capacity he would have been familiar with the series of articles on the possible corruption of the German language by Nazi ideology published in the first year's numbers of Die Wandlung by Dolf Sternberger, Gerhard Storz, and W. E. Stiskind, under the title 'Aus dem Worterbuch des Unmenschen'.6 It was also during these years in Marburg that Krauss published his essay 'Uber den Zustand unserer Sprache'. In September I947 Krauss followed a call to a Chair in Leipzig and, like Klemperer, played a significant role in supporting the cultural and educational policies of the GDR. He was awarded the Nationalpreis der DDR in I947, elected to the Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften in I949, and appointed to a Chair at the Humboldt University in East Berlin in I951, where Klemperer was also a professor from 1951 to I954. There he founded the Arbeitsgruppe zur Geschichte 3 See Victor Klemperer, Und so ist alles schwankend: Tagebiicher Juni bis Dezember i945, ed. by Gunter Jackel with Hadwig Klemperer (Berlin: Aufbau Verlag, 1995), and my article, 'Victor Klemperer's "Sprache des vierten Reiches": LTI = LQI?', GLL, 51 (1997-98), 360-71. 4 For the history of the writing and publication of LTI, see my article. 5 The most detailed analysis to date of the genesis and significance of this novel is provided in Elisabeth Fillmann, Realsatire und Lebensbewdltigung: Studien zur Entstehung und Leistung von Werner Krauss' antifaschistischem Roman 'PLN. Die Passionen der haykonischen Seele' (Frankfurt a.M.: Lang, 1996). 6 These articles appeared in ten parts in Die Wandlung, i.I-5, 7-II (1945-46). They have since been reprinted in collected form on a number of occasions, most recently in Sternberger, Storz, and Siiskind, Aus dem Wirterbuch des Unmenschen.

Klemperer and Krauss were well acquainted and knew each other's work. Although the former's diaries reveal a rapidly deepening gulf of bitter personal antipathy and professional jealousy developing between the two from the late 1940s, he wrote two very positive reviews of the latter's novel PLN, commending particularly the language of the novel as a vehicle of Krauss's satire on the Nazi regime.7 In a private letter to Krauss dated 15 March 1948 Klemperer commented on the 'kuriose Coincidenz' that had led both of them to assign a three-letter cryptic abbreviation, PLN and LTI, as a title to books each had conceived and drafted during the Third Reich.8 Klemperer also received and read a copy of Krauss's article 'Uber den Zustand unserer Sprache' in April I948 (So sitze ich denn zwischen allen Stiihlen, I, 529). Krauss wrote the official obituary for Klemperer that appeared in the 1962 number of the Jahrbuch der Deutschen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, concentrating solely on the Klemperer's work as a scholar of Romance Philology and curiously omitting any reference to LTI, the one book for which he was best known both inside and outside the GDR.9 One reason for such reticence may have been the fact that, as the GDR authorities knew only too well, Klemperer's analysis of the language of fascist totalitarianism was no less relevant to the public and political rhetoric of Communism (see my article). It is to both men's concerns about the linguistic legacy of the Third Reich in postwar Germany, expressed in the two publications I am considering that I now turn my attention, prior to examining their relevance to the discussion of this same issue by the young generation of postwar writers. In LTI Klemperer develops a controversial thesis based on his observation and analysis of linguistic developments during the Third Reich. The main thrust of LTI is now familiar enough to make a detailed rehearsal of it redundant here. Suffice it to say that Klemperer's experience of twelve years of Nazi rule left him with an almost obsessive conviction that the Nazis successfully manipulated the German language as a vehicle for propagating their ideological values and even moulding the thinking, emotions, and behaviour both of individuals and of society. This conviction is best encapsulated in the Schiller quotation that functions as a leitmotif throughout LTI: 'Sprache, die fur dich dichtet und denkt.'"0 Klemperer develops 7 The two reviews are 'PLN, eine chiffrierte Zeitgeschichte', Heute und Morgen, 2 (1948), 367-68, and 'Philologie unterm Fallbeil', Forum.

Klemperer's comment is also repeated in his diary entry for 15 May 1947. LTI (Latin: Lingua Tertii Imperii) was the deliberately veiled reference to his working notes on the language of the Third Reich, which Klemperer used for safety's sake during the Nazi years. The title of Krauss's novel PLNis the abbreviation for Postleitnummer. The Nazis introduced the postal code system, and Krauss's novel is set in the world of postal administration, directing its satire at the depersonalizing minutiae of a totalitarian bureaucracy. 9 Werner Krauss, 'Nachruf auf Victor Klemperer', Jahrbuch der Deutschen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin I962 (Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, I963), pp. 143-44. For a discussion of the issues surrounding official sensitivity to Klemperer's LTIin the GDR, see my article. 10 These words are part of Schiller's distich 'Dilettant', which appeared in the Musenalmanachfiir das Jahr 1797 as No. 88 of the Tabulae Votivae. The full text reads: 'Weil ein Vers dir gelingt in einer gebildeten Sprache, I Die fur dich dichtet und denkt, glaubst du auch schon Dichter zu seyn.' While Klemperer was naturally convinced by the force of his own argument and the evidence supporting it, he never seems to have realized that his theory took the Nazi claims about their success in manipulating language at face value and effectively reinforced them.</page><page sequence="4">RODERICK H. WATT his theory to an extreme in which he commits the anthropomorphic fallacy of attributing to language an autonomous power, quite independent of human intention, to influence language users. In this respect he unwittingly reiterates the sociolinguistic theories of language determinism advanced in the 1920S by Edward Sapir, developed in the I95os by Benjamin Whorf, and subsequently modified and mediated in Basil Bernstein's work on elaborated and restricted language codes." To date there is no evidence that Klemperer was familiar with any of these developments in Anglo-American linguistics; his theory was dictated solely by empirical observation of his own personal experience in Nazi Germany. In the immediate post-1945 years his view not surprisingly often elicited a positive if uncritical response from many Germans who had lived through the Third Reich. After all, such a theory of language determinism could provide at least a degree of exculpation for those who felt incriminated in the excesses of Nazi Germany. The study of sociolinguistics developed relatively late in Germany compared to the English-speaking world. Given Germany's unique experience of twelve years of Nazi rule, it is scarcely surprising that academic studies of German language use during the Third Reich tended at first to focus on the function of language in sociological, political, ideological, and even ethical contexts. Concentrating on these areas, German commentators from the late I950 progressively discredited Klemperer's argument that language could determine aspects of individual and collective behaviour. In so doing, such studies have increasingly aligned German sociolinguistics with the main trends of sociolinguistics in the English-speaking world. 12 Klemperer's theory leads him inevitably to the conclusion that the tenacious persistence in the private, public, and especially political discourse of postwar Germany of what he understands to be characteristically Nazi language is clear evidence of the ever-present threat of latent fascism. This fear is a recurrent motif in LTI and Und so ist alles schwankend, his diaries for June to December i945. In particular, he perceives an intimate and pernicious relationship between the language of the military and that of the Nazi Party: Zwischen Heeressprache und LTI liegt eine Wechselwirkung vor, genauer: erst hat die Heeressprache auf die LTI gewirkt, und dann ist die Heeressprache von der LTI korrumpiert worden.

(p. 80)13 Das Charakteristikum des zweiten Weltkriegs besteht darin, daB die Sprache der Partei, daB die eigentliche LTI zerstorend in die Heeressprache eindringt. (p. 276) It is significant that Klemperer refers without exception to Heeressprache, the official language of military bureaucracy, administration, strategy, tactics, and the officer corps as differentiated from Soldatensprache or Landserdeutsch, the daily language of the common German soldier. As a marginalized Jew in Nazi Germany Klemperer would have little opportunity to familiarize himself with the language of the ordinary soldier, although he could still collect samples of more official military usage from the press and the regular Sondermeldungen der OKW. German linguists have distinguished between Heeressprache and Soldatensprache for at least a hundred years, since Paul Horn first formally differentiated them in his Die deutsche Soldatensprache (1898).14 In 'Uber den Zustand unserer Sprache' (I947) Krauss argues a case almost diametrically contrary to Klemperer's pessimistic view of the latent threat of Nazi ideology immanent in the persistence of Nazi language in postwar Germany, although his argument is not entirely free of internal inconsistencies. As co-editor of Die Wandlung, Krauss would certainly be familiar with the series of articles published in the first year's numbers of that periodical under the title 'Aus dem Worterbuch des Unmenschen', which sought to stimulate an analysis of the linguistic legacy of the Third Reich in postwar Germany. He alludes to this work obliquely in the opening paragraph of his essay when acknowledging the current efforts to denazify the German language (CS, p. 43), but he immediately proceeds to warn specifically against the anthropomorphic fallacy of blaming the German language, rather than the individuals using the language, for the rise of Nazism: 'Freilich darf man nicht vorschnell die schwer beruhrbare Sprache zum entlastenden Anwalt fur die Sprecher machen' (ZS, p. 43). In this he differs radically from Klemperer and anticipates the conclusions of the majority of the studies by German analysts of the language of National Socialism that began to appear from the early I96os. Typically for the German context, with the ever-present memory of the Nazi past, such studies always focused strongly on the interaction of language with politics and ideology (see note I2). He concludes his introduction by asserting categorically, in stark contrast to Klemperer, that Fascism failed to make any lasting impact on the German language: 'Tatsache ist, daB es dem Faschismus versagt blieb, trotz seines Anspruchs auf totale Verwandlung des Menschen eine sprachliche Tiefenwirkung zu tiben, die den entferntesten Vergleich mit der sprachlichen Wirkung der franzosischen oder der russischen Revolution erlauben wtirde.' The rest of Krauss's essay is devoted to the phenomenon of Landsersprache and its irrefutable influence on the written and spoken discourse of postwar Germany. Unlike Klemperer, Krauss, perhaps as a consequence of his personal experience as a soldier and state prisoner during the Third Reich, distinguishes between Heeressprache and Landsersprache, focusing solely on the latter. There are certain '3 Jurgen Born argues rather unconvincingly that the influence of Nazi propaganda waned, at least in the OKW reports, as the war progressed ('Zur Sprache des Oberkommandos der Wehrmacht', Wirkendes Wort, 9 ( 959), 160-69). 14 Reinhard Olt, 'Soldatensprache: Ein Forschungsbericht', Muttersprache, 91 (198 1), 93- I05 (p. 93). 428</page><page sequence="6">RODERICK H. WATT contradictions, or at least implicit inconsistencies, in Krauss's analysis of Landser- sprache as a socially and historically conditioned group language or slang (Argot). On the one hand he sees this language of the common soldier in Nazi Germany as a classic example of a group language functioning as a means of preserving group solidarity and providing a defence mechanism against the ideological demands of State and Party. In that respect he sees Landsersprache not as a subset of Nazi language but as a bulwark against its possible influence: Dem Nazideutsch wurde die pathetische Blase ausgestochen. (ZS, p.47) Eine verschworene Sprechergemeinschaft hatte sich gebildet, die das genaue Kehrbild der von den Goebbelssendern geforderten Schwurgemeinschaft darstellt: ein fatalistisches Einver- nehmen zwischen Entwurzelten, die vom Leben nichts mehr zu erwarten haben als den Proviant fur die Reise ins Nichts, als das, was sie durch Uberlistung ihrem unholden Schicksal noch entreiBen konnen. Die Selbsterhaltung ist zu einer Geheimwissenschaft geworden. Hier herrscht diesselbe Moral, die den klassischen Schelmenroman durchatzt. (p. 52) At the same time he seems to contradict his own earlier assertion, quoted above, that language should not be held responsible for the crimes of those using it (,S, p. 43) and, at least implicitly, to concur with Klemperer's belief that language indeed has the power to prescribe thought, emotion, and even behaviour: 'Solange einer die Landsersprache sprach, war er auch dem Landserglauben verfallen' (p. 47). There are two other passages in the essay in which Krauss seems to come close to subscribing to Klemperer's dictum 'Sprache, die fur dich dichtet und denkt'. Like any slang, Krauss concedes, Landsersprache is subject to rapid changes in fashion, and this in itself can lead to it dictating, rather than responding to the linguistic and communicative intentions of the speaker: Ihre Aktualitat macht sie, ohne Gedachtnisaufwand, jedem Zugriff zuganglich. Auch wird der Wortgebrauch dadurch erleichtert, daB die Wortstellung, Akzent, Tonstarke und Modulation fir die charakteristischen Argotfiguren unveranderlich festliegen, so daB Sprechen mehr ein Nachahmen von Vorgesprochenem ist als eine freie Kombination der gegebenen Elemente. (ZS, pp. 48-49) When commenting on the worrying fact that even children in postwar Germany seem to adopt not only the Landsersprache but the alienation and scepticism it expresses, he reaches a conclusion that could have almost been written by Klemperer for his LTI: 'Gerade im kindlichen Sprachgebrauch zeigt sich die kollektive Gewalt der Sprache, die ihre Gedanken auch ohne klares BewuBtsein des Sprechers durchsetzt' (ZS, p. 55). Krauss explicitly rejects the suggestion that the widespread use of Landersprache in post-I945 Germany should be seen as evidence of a persistent latent militarism, whose existence he regretfully cannot deny (p. 53). In this respect, as I shall show in due course, his opinion diverges significantly from that of many of the younger generation of post- I945 German writers, most of whom had themselves served in the ranks during the Second World War. For Krauss, the continued use of Landsersprache in postwar Germany is a specific manifestation of a general mistrust of Establishment values, ideology, and public rhetoric, a mistrust sharpened for this generation by its particular experience of Nazi Germany (pp. 53-54). He sees the common soldier as the perennial victim of the currently prevailing Establishment values. Consequently, the pervasive presence of Landsersprache in postwar Germany should be understood as a general symptom of social and existential alienation, 429</page><page sequence="7">430 The Linguistic Legacy of the Third Reich rather than as specific evidence of the continuing appeal of Nazism or militarism: 'Daher kann auch die Fortfuhrung dieser sprachlichen Tendenzen kein bewuBtes politisches Vorzeichen haben' (p. 54). Although Krauss does not see the continued use of Landsersprache constituting evidence of latent Fascism and militarism, he does interpret it as a disturbing symptom of a disillusioned and deeply insecure society so subverted by its recent Nazi history as to be unable to respond or adapt positively or with any confidence to the new, postwar reality (p. 55). Like Klemperer and Krauss, the great majority of the first generation of new, younger writers of the postwar years had lived in Germany during the Nazi period. Unlike Klemperer and Krauss, however, most of them had, no matter how reluctantly, also seen active service with the Wehrmacht and were consequently in a peculiarly privileged position to comment on the linguistic legacy of the Third Reich, with particular reference to the possible influence of Heeressprache and Landsersprache. The opinions of writers such as Hans Werner Richter (I908-93), Nicolaus Sombart (b. I923), Alfred Andersch (I914-1980), Giinter de Bruyn (b. 1926), and Wolfdietrich Schnurre (1920-89) tended to divide along the lines identified and analysed by Krauss and Klemperer, although none of the authors concerned alludes even implicitly to either of them. Many of the young writers in question were members, some of them founder-members, of the Gruppe 47. Remembering the inaugural meeting of the Gruppe 47, its founder, Hans Werner Richter, comments positively on the use of Landsersprache in some of the first work ever read there, notably Wolfdietrich Schnurre's story 'Das Begrabnis', in terms reminiscent of those used by Werner Krauss: Was bei alien ebenfalls unbemerkt zum Ausdruck kommt, ist die nur auf die Aussage zielende Sprache der 'Landser', die Reduzierung der Sprache auf das Notwendige, eine Abkehr vom Leerlauf der schonen Worte und eine Hinwendung zu ihrem unmittelbaren Realitatsbezug. Sie haben es alle gelernt in der Masse des Volkes, in der sie gelebt haben, jahrlang, tagaus, tagein, in den Kompanien, in den Kasernen, in den Lagern, in den Gefangenenlagern. Sie haben in dieser Zeit immer am Rande der menschlichen Existenz gelebt. Das hat sie miBtrauisch und hellhorig gemacht.15 In his autobiography, Jugend in Berlin (I984), Nicolaus Sombart also a founder- member of the Gruppe 47, reflects on his enforced military service late in the war and credits the Landsersprache with being an antidote to the bombastic rhetoric of Party propaganda: 'Zu den derben, gegen jede Phraseologie durchschlagenden Land- serweisheiten zahlte der Spruch: "Kameraden? Wer redet von Kameraden? Kameraden gibt es nicht - nicht mehr. Die letzten sind bei Stalingrad gefallen." '16 Richter and Sombart, however, almost certainly represented a minority view among the fellow writers of their generation in general and of the Gruppe 47 in particular. 15 Hans Werner Richter und die Gruppe 47, ed. by Hans A. Neunzig (Munich: Nymphenburg, 1979), p. 8i. 16 Nicolaus Sombart, Jugend in Berlin (Munich: Hanser, I984), p. 197. Many of Richter's and Sombart's contemporaries were, nevertheless, only too pleased when the end of the war released them from the enforced cameraderie and the emotional, intellectual, and linguistic straitjacket of a regimented military existence. See, for example: Alfred Andersch, Die Kirschen der Freiheit (Zurich: Diogenes, i968), pp. 63-64; Wolfgang Borchert, 'Das ist unser Manifest', in Das Gesamtwerk (Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1972), pp. 308-I5 (p. 309); Siegfried Lenz, 'Kennzeichen, eines Jahrgangs', in Beziehungen (Hamburg: Hoffman &amp; Campe, 1970), pp. I -41 (pp. 34-35); Wolfdietrich Schnurre, 'Unterm Fallbeil der Freiheit', in Schreibtisch unterfreiem Himmel (Olten and Freiburg: Walter, 1964), pp. I-I5 (pp. 1-12).</page><page sequence="8">RODERICK H. WATT In Die Kirschen der Freiheit (1952) Alfred Andersch records his experience of military service during the Third Reich. He explicitly rejects the ideologically motivated euphemisms that had infiltrated military officialese (Heeressprache) under the Nazis and is manifestly concerned that such a linguistic legacy could still shape the revisionist thinking of the I950S (Andersch, pp. 79-80). There is certainly strong evidence of his suspicion that the Nazi corruption of military language could have a continuing detrimental effect in postwar Germany, but he nowhere suggests that the language of the ordinary soldier (Landsersprache) was similarly susceptible to ideological contamination.17 Gunter de Bruyn, who was called up for military service at the very end of the war and served as batman to a disillusioned lieutenant by the name of Krell, provides a slightly different perspective in the first volume of his autobiography, published in I992. De Bruyn remembers the impoverishing effect on his officer's language not only of casual obscenities but also of militaryjargon, slang, and cliches, an impoverishment De Bruyn claims to see and hear still in the language of his own day, although he does not go as far as to suggest that this should be interpreted as a symptom of latent Fascism or militarism. His criticism is linguistic, perhaps even aesthetic, rather than ideological or political: Sein [Krells] friiher gepflegtes Hochdeutsch [. . .] war durch die widerstandslose Aufnahme des Soldatenwortschatzes zu einem aus vorgepragten Begriffen zusammengesetzten Jargon verkommen- der uns heute vertraut anmutet, weil er mit dem Ende des Krieges kein Ende fand, sondern weiterwucherte, bis in die Schriftsprache manchen Periodikums und manchen Buches hinein. An Krell konnte ich damals studieren, daB das EinflieBen von Vulgaraus- drucken aus der Genital-, Sexual-, und Fakalsphare die Sprache nicht bereichert, sondern verarmt hatte, weil die Verwendung dieser Stereotypen [... .] die Suche nach dem treffenden Ausdruck erspart. Schlimmer noch als diese Niveausenkung und Verschmutzung war bei Krell aber der standige Gebrauch kriegerischer Metaphern - und auch das hat bei Zeitungsschreibern und Politikern Schule gemacht. Ein halbesJahrhundert nach Kriegsende geht der verbale Krieg (mit der vordersten Front, dem Volltreffer, dem schweren Geschutz, der Breitseite, dem Grabenkampf, der Vorhut, dem Bombengeschaft oder dem SchuB vor den Bug) munter weiter, so daB mir bei der Zeitungslektiire oft vorkommt, als habe mein damaliger Dienstherr [. . .] die Texte verfaBt.18 Of all the new, young, German writers of the postwar generation none was more exercised by the question of the possible linguistic legacy of the Third Reich than Wolfdietrich Schnurre, whose reading of his nowjustly famous story 'Das Begrabnis' opened the inaugural meeting of the Gruppe 47 in September I947. Like many of his contemporaries, Schnurre had seen military service throughout the Second World War, and these experiences marked him and his work for life.19 In particular, as one of the very few postwar writers who could be said to have made a genuine contribution to the achievement of anything even remotely approaching a Kahlschlag in postwar German language and literature, however short-lived, his unremitting 17 Since the early I960s academic linguists have become increasingly sceptical about the theory, promulgated in Germany particularly strongly by Klemperer, that language can somehow be subject to ideological infiltration or contamination. From the strictly linguistic perspective, it is argued, language has an essentially value-free function in communicative relationships. The concept of the abuse of language is based on a moral, social, political, even personal code of values whose criteria are not intrinsically linguistic. A trenchant summary of this postion is provided by Romer, 'Gibt es MiBbrauch der Sprache?'. 18 Gunter de Bruyn, wwischenbilanz (Frankfurt a.M.: S. Fischer, I992), p. 2 I8. 19 For a detailed exploration of the impact of the war on Schnurre and his work, see Ian Roberts, 'Eine Rechnung, die nicht aufgeht'. Identity and Ideology in the Fiction of Wolfdietrich Schnurre (Frankfurt a.M.: Lang, I997). 43I</page><page sequence="9">The Linguistic Legacy of the Third Reich linguistic self-analysis, fired by an almost pathological sensitivity to the possible survival in postwar Germany of Nazi language as the vehicle of Nazi ideology, offers a paradigm of the linguistic sensibilities of his generation of writers. At every stage of his writing career from 1946 until his death in 1989 Schnurre obsessively explained and restated his conviction that German had been so contaminated by Nazi propaganda and manipulation of language that even many years after the war it could still function subliminally as a vehicle for Nazi ideology and militarism. In this respect Schnurre echoes the fears expressed by Klemperer about the autonomous power of language to shape thinking, emotion, and even behaviour and implicitly challenges Werner Krauss's assertion that Landsersprache should not be seen as a linguistic repository of fascist ideology and militarism, even although there is no evidence to date that Schnurre knew the work of either Klemperer or Krauss discussed above. In a brief article published in September 1946 and significantly entitled 'Landsknechts-Esperanto' Schnurre complains bitterly that the military and ideological jargon of the Third Reich have established themselves as the linguistic currency of postwar Germany. He make no distinction between the language of Party propaganda, of the common soldier, or of the military establishment, indiscriminately classifying 'Feldwebelstilbliiten', 'Goebbelismen', 'Kasernen- hofzoten', 'faule Landserwitze', 'PK-Stil', and 'VB-Stil' as manifestations of 'Landsknechts-Esperanto'.20 A month later, in a book review for the Deutsche Rundschau, he criticizes the Hemingway cult then being affected by many young German writers: 'Dieser Stil ist im Kommen. Jeder, der selbst schreibt, kennt seine Verlockung. Nur wenige allerdings auch seine Gefahr. Denn diese "neue Sachlich- keit" hat wohl Hemingway zum Vater, aber den Landserchargon der PK- und Wehrmachtsberichte zum Bruder.'21 Schnurre's obsessive suspicion of postwar German as an ideologically corrupted medium in the aftermath of twelve years of Nazi abuse and manipulation resurfaces regularly over the next forty years. In essays, reviews, forewords, or postscripts to editions of his short stories, interviews, and autobiographical sketches he repeatedly, not to say repetitively, examines the issue, both in the general context of German writing of the immediate postwar years and in the specific context of his own contribution to that literature. Like Werner Krauss, he focuses particularly on the function and possible influence of Landsersprache, although he does not share Krauss's opinion as to the innocuous legacy of such language. As the following representative examples show, Schnurre's suspicion of his own literary medium is generally politically or ideologically motivated: like Klemperer, he is convinced that language is not merely a vehicle for communicating values but also has the power somehow to impose values on individuals and society. On occasion, however, his distrust of contemporary German seems to be based on aesthetic criteria rather than on the consideration of any putative socio-political or moral impact of a language corrupted by Nazism.

WATT comments on the language of the new, young postwar writers, including by implication himself: Sie muBten naturgemaB eine neue Sprache reden als die zu Hause. Sie war nicht immer schon, diese Sprache; sie war holperig und landserhaft, sie war kahl und unkonventionell. Sie knarrte vor Miftrauen, und man fror, wenn man sie horte. [.. .] Das war notwendig, um zu einem neuen Anfang, um zu einem organisch reifenden LauterungsprozeB zu gelangen. DreiJahre vergingen. Wo aber blieb dieser LauterungsprozeB?22 There are implicit inconsistencies evident here. Schnurre's criticism of the influence of Landsersprache seems essentially aesthetic. There is no suggestion that such language may itself be infected with Nazi ideology or militarism, but there is a tacit acknowledgement that in its unpretentious simplicity it might provide the necessary foundation for developing a new German somehow decontaminated of its latent Nazi ideology. In many of his early short stories Schnurre himself cultivated just such a sparse style, which later came to be subsumed under the rubric of Kahlschlag writing. Three years later, despite alluding to the lingering influence of Nazism, he again apparently criticizes the language of the new, younger writers on aesthetic grounds: 'Man hat ihre Vergewaltigung durch den Nazismus miterlebt, man erlaubt ihr nicht mehr, brokatene Gewander zu tragen; man ist miBtrauisch geworden ihrem Wohlklang gegentiber, man zwingt sie, sich einfach zu kleiden. Und merkt nicht, wie sehr sie dabei verliert.'23 The most famous formulation of Schnurre's views on the German language of the immediate postwar era is probably to be found in his foreword to the first edition of Man sollte dagegen sein ( 960), a collection of stories first written between I945 and 1948: Nicht einmal die Sprache war mehr zu gebrauchen; die Nazijahre und die Kriegspropaganda hatten sie unrein gemacht. Sie muBte erst mtihsam wieder Wort fur Wort abgeklopft werden. Jedem Und, jedem Adjektiv gegenuber war Vorsicht geboten. Die neue Sprache, die so entstand war nicht sch6n. Sie wirkte keuchend und kahl, und Umgangsidiome und das MiBtrauen gegenuber langen Satzen hatten mitgearbeitet an ihr.24 Although Schnurre clearly fears a residual influence of Nazi propaganda in contemporary German, nowhere in this foreword does he cite Landsersprache, essentially an oral languge, as a potential source of militaristic subversion in postwar Germany. Indeed, he regards the idioms and speech patterns of daily colloquial language as a possible antidote to what are, in his opinion, moribund, discredited traditional concepts of literary aesthetics and beauty. During the following years Schnurre's frequent comments on the language of the new, young, German writers of the immediate postwar generation vacillate between aesthetic criticism of the language many of them inherited from their military service in Nazi Germany and a morally and socio-politically motivated concern that even a vestigial presence of characteristic linguistic expressions of Nazi ideology could still actually transmit and propagate these values. Towards the end of his life this concern seems to have reasserted itself ever more emphatically. In a lecture delivered at the University of Frankfurt am Main in January I964 Schnurre refers to the language of the earliest generation of post-I945 writers, 22 'Schopferische Verzweiflung', Ja. Eine deutsche Wochenzeitung, 8 December I948, p. 4. 23 'Schreibtisch unter freiem Himmel', Eckart, 20 (1951 ), 62-69 (p. 68). 24 Man sollte dagegen sein (Olten and Freiburg: Walter, 1960), pp. 9- 0. 433</page><page sequence="11">434 The Linguistic Legacy of the Third Reich acknowledging the influence of their military experience and their Landsersprache, but without suggesting that their use of the latter in any way fostered militarism: 'Jene karge Sprache [...], in welcher damals, ab 1945, in Deutschland wieder die ersten Kurzgeschichten und Romane geschrieben worden sind [eine Sprache, in deren Staccato noch MG-Schiisse hallten, und die von der Flucht vor den sowjetischen Panzern noch atemlos und vom Umgangston in den Gefangenenlagern noch heiser und unartikuliert war].'25 Much the same judgement, this time applied explicitly to his own early short stories, is found in an interview of 1971, although the phrase 'die Begriffe abklopfen', indicates perhaps an underlying disquiet as to the ideological content of the lexis inherited from the Third Reich: 'Was man bisher geschrieben hatte, waren Hackmesser-Satze, MG-Salven-Passagen. SchlieBlich war 45 ja auch die Sprache zertrummert. Man muBte von vorn beginnen. Man muBte die Worte, die Begriffe abklopfen. Man muf3te versuchen, iiberhaupt wieder mal einen Hauptsatz zu schreiben.'26 By I977, however, Schnurre had, in his frequent retrospective analyses of the language and literature of the immediate post-I945 years, reverted to the much more rigorously critical view of the linguistic legacy of the Third Reich evident in his earliest reviews and essays of I946. Once again he emphasizes the threat to democratic and humanitarian values that can be transmitted and reinforced by a language still carrying the ideological baggage of the Nazi era; once again Landsersprache is seen as a potential source of militaristic infection in German society. Talking to Peter Sandmeyer in I977, Schnurre alludes to his own experience of writing in the years immediately after the war: Was nun das Schreiben anging, so war hier das MiBtrauen in die Sprache oft geradezu unuberwindbar. Denn die Sprache war es ja gewesen, die sich zuerst hatte verfiihren lassen. Und sie war nicht nur zur Soldatenhure, sie war auch zum nazistischen Spitzenreiter verkommen. Mit dieser Verraterin jetzt Umgang zu haben, war ein arges Geschaft. Man beschrankte sich daher aufs Wesentliche. LieB kein einziges, unklares, gar miBbrauchtes Wort in sie hinein. Schrieb wie gemeiBelt. Sah sich jedes Und als moglichen Denunzi- anten an.27 In his conspicuous predilection for anthropomorphic metaphors to describe the nature of language inherited from the Third Reich by his generation of writers Schnurre here aligns himself remarkably closely with Klemperer's thinking in LTI on the prescriptive function in society of an ideologically loaded and manipulated language. Schnurre reiterated his conviction as to the potentially corrupting influence of the linguistic legacy of the Third Reich several times in the last ten years of his life. For example, in his introduction to Blau mitgoldenen Streifen (I979), a collection of his earliest short stories, he writes that he, Borchert, and Boll all had to resort to 'eine Sprache [... .], die Naziidiom und Landserargot bis zur Unbrauchbarkeit verunstal- tet hatte'.28 He makes much the same charge against the language of postwar Germany during an interview with Mathias Adelhoefer and Andrea Wendt in 1986: 25 'Schriftsteller und Engagement', in Schreibtisch unterfreiem Himmel, pp. 225-49 (p. 227). 26 Protokoll zur Person: Autoren iiber sich und ihr Werk, ed. by Ekkehart Rudolph (Munich: List, 1977), pp. 107-19 (p.

WATT 'Eines war klar, namlich das MiBtrauen in die Sprache. Die Sprache war versaut durch Nazi-Jargon, Hackmesser-Stil, Landser-Argot und so weiter.'29 In both of these passages he indiscriminately classifies the language of the Nazi Party along with the slang of the common Wehrmacht soldier as a potential source of ideological contamination that threatens to propagate and reinforce fascist and militaristic values in post-I945 Germany. Such a view directly contradicts the far more sympathetic analysis of Landsersprache offered by Krauss in 'Uber den Zustand unserer Sprache'. In conclusion, it may be noted that Schnurre's pessimistic conclusions about the persistent, insidious influence in postwar Germany of an ideologically contaminated language born of twelve years of Nazi propaganda not only echo Klemperer's anthropomorphic fallacy of 'Sprache, die fur dich dichtet und denkt' but actually also confirm the Nazis' own claims that they successfully manipulated the German language for their own ideological ends. Although Schnurre might have been loath to concede this, it is corroborated by a recent study of official linguistic self- awareness in Nazi Germany, claimed to be the first of its kind, by Heidrun Kamper- Jensen.30 For the purposes of her research Kamper-Jensen examines academic publications on the German language that were published in Nazi Germany and, by implication at least, therefore had the blessing of the Party. For most Nazi scholars and linguists, military language in general and the language of the common soldier in particular represented one of the most typical and important expressions of a way of life glorified and idolized by Party ideology: Soldatensprache [. . .] wird als sprachlicher Ausdruck einer dem Nationalsozialismus idealen Existenzform bewertet. [...] Soldatensprache also [...] ist die am meisten geschatzte sprachliche Existenzform, sie entsprach zuallererst nationalsozialistischem Weltbild. [.. .] Soldatensprache dient so als MaBstab. [.. .] Intellektuellen- bzw. Wissenschaftssprache ist das Gegenstuck zur volksnahen Sprache und darum abzulehnen. (Kamper-Jensen, pp. I68-69) Kamper-Jensen points out that for the Nazis the use and study of language was above all 'machterhaltend' (pp. 166, 17 I). That the Nazis should make such claims for the function of language in society is scarcely surprising; that Klemperer and Schnurre should effectively endorse such claims is more than a little surprising, particularly in the light of the linguistic research since the Second World War that has reached a consensus that language cannot in itself propagate and reinforce values and ideology in the way that the Nazis maintained (see note 2). Klemperer, in particular, ensnares himself in major inconsistencies and contradictions in LTI when he claims in Chapter 28, 'Die Sprache des Siegers', that German Jews living in Nazi Germany were somehow impervious or immune to the linguistic determi- nism of Nazi propaganda and indoctrination that he claimed to see influencing their fellow Germans. Although such a line of argument implicitly corroborates the Nazi racist theories that differentiated between Jew and Aryan, Klemperer never seems to have recognized this flaw in his reasoning.31 29 'Gesprach mit Wolfdietrich Schnurre', in Mathias Adelhoefer, Wolfdietrich Schnurre - ein deutscher Nachkriegsautor (Pfaffenweiler: Centaurus, 1990), pp. 94-105 (p. 102). 30 'Spracharbeit im Dienst des NS-Staates', Zeitschriftfr germanistische Linguistik, 21 (1993), 150-83. 31 For a more detailed study of this issue, see my article, 'Victor Klemperer and the Language of National Socialism', in The German-Jewish Dilemma: From the Enlightenment to the Shoah, ed. by Andrea Hammel and Edward Timms (Lewiston, NY, Queenston, Ont., and Lampeter: Mellen Press, 1999), pp. 243-54. 435</page><page sequence="13">436 The Linguistic Legacy of the Third Reich Although of different generations, both Klemperer and Schnurre were highly articulate writers with an acutely developed linguistic sensitivity, and yet both seem to have been so traumatized by their experience of Nazi Germany that they never subsequently succeeded in gaining the objective distance necessary for a more dispassionate analysis of the linguistic dimension of that experience and its supposed after-effects. Klemperer was undoubtedly a victim, although never an active antagonist of the Nazi regime, and Schnurre certainly claimed retrospectively to have been both a victim and an opponent of the Nazis. In 'Eine Rechnung, die nicht aufgeht' Ian Roberts has argued persuasively, however, that Schnurre's entire postwar wuvre is in fact motivated by personal guilt and the desire to reclaim and reconstruct an ideologically compromised past. Perhaps it was Krauss's positive, personal commitment to working with an organized and politically motivated resistance group that enabled him to develop and maintain an objective and critical distance to his experiences and not to take at face value the inflated claims made by the Nazis about their ideological manipulation of language. Neither Klemperer, the persecuted Jew, nor Schnurre, the common Wehrmacht soldier who chose in retrospect to see himself as a victim of Nazism, seems to have been in a position to attain such a degree of critical objectivity during or even after the Third Reich.
