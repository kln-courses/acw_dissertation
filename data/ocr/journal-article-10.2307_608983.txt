<plain_text><page sequence="1">Two Manichaean Magical Texts with an Excursus on The Parthian ending -endh. By W. B. HENNING (PLATES I AND II) IT is surprising that the Manichaean religion did not become altogether submerged in the slime of witchcraft and sorcery. There were countless demons to be warded off and nearly as many divine and semi-divine beings that could be invoked. Mani, it is true, had regarded his " gods " as hardly more than exponents of particular functions of the Godhead, and had been conscious of the inadequacy of the anthropomorphic terms he had ill-advisedly employed: the resplendent hosts, he said in his Treasure of Life, will be called young women and virgins, fathers and mothers, sons, brothers and sisters, because such is the custom in the books of the prophets. In the country of joy there is neither male nor female . . . they do not differ from each other in weakness and force, in length and shortness, in figure and looks; they are like similar lamps which are lighted by the same lamp and nourished by the same material (Beruni, India, transl., i, 39). But in the minds of his adherents, who were not all theologians, the shadowy " emanations " were bound to take on the character of gods that could scarcely be distinguished from the gods of polytheists. The Manichaean custom of " translating " even the names of gods, no doubt meant to ease the work of missionaries by giving a misleading tinge of familiarity to the strange new religion, made matters worse. The introduction of divinities whose names the translators light-heartedly used, had in its train the import of beliefs with which they were associated in the local cults. They tended to bring their friends and attendants with them. Such an additament to an already overgrown pantheon was, for example, the Iranian First Physician Fredon, the Oraetaona of the Avesta, whose name is as common in Manicha~an prayers and incantations as in Zoroastrian amulets (see e.g. J. J. Modi, Charms or Amulets for some diseases of the eye, Bombay, 1894). The influence of local religions upon the later Manichaeism is hardly notice- able in theological works, except in a few rare instances. To trace it we have to turn to more popular productions, such as prayers that are on the verge of being incantations, or magical texts in the proper sense. Of the latter there are quite a few among the Iranian material, but none have been published so far. The two specimens given below exhibit some curious points; they would have shocked the founder of the Manichaean Church. I. Middle Persian Spells (Plate I) M 781.

Notes (3) w'd rather = spirit (as in line 44) than " wind(-illness)". (4) 'ydr' may be the name of the spell or the fever or its " spirit ". The ending proclaims it to be a foreign word. May one think of vS'pa ? The absence of the aspirate is against it. One is perhaps too easily tempted to explain un- known words as loanwords. In Mir.Man., i, p. 183, line 4, I pretended 1 that 'bwws was afovauoos; now I see that it is merely - Pahl. 'pws " pregnant" (Av. apuOra, Pers. dbis-tan,2 etc.). (6) psqwc griffin. Whether merely the spirit's wings, or his having three " forms " as well as his wings are here compared with the pskwc, is by no means clear from the wording. In the former case the author ought to have said 'ws pr c'wn pr 'y pskwc " and its wings are like the wings of P.", in the latter 'wd pr in the place of 'ws pr. In the construction of their com- parisons, similes, and parables the Manichaean authors are notoriously lax. Our soothsayer's negligence makes it impossible to determine from our text, taken by itself, whether the pskwc was an animal noteworthy merely for the shape of its wings, or an extraordinary winged creature possessed of several " forms ". The second alternative recommends itself, in view of the character of the text and the other forms of the word quoted below. Having several " forms" (pahikirb) means being a composite monster of the type of the winged bull, the griffin, etc. The Manichseans boasted a King of Darkness who was even rrevrdTacopqos (top-r = pahikirb): he had a lion's head, an eagle's wings, a dragon's belly, demons' feet, and a fish's tail, cf. Polotsky, Pauly- Wissowa, Suppl., vi, 250. That the Pskwc =- Paskc6 was a griffin or a monster like a griffin, is assured by a series of words in other languages. The words are throughout extremely rare: we have one example in Man. MPers. and Parthian, one in Pahlavi, one in the Babylonian Talmud, two in Armenian, one in Svanetian, two in Ossetic, and several in Georgian. The Caucasian words have been the subject of a long paper by N. Ya. Marr, Ossetica-Japhetica, i. diaqonU1-i osetinskix skazok i yapheticeskiy termin qbaskund "mag ", "v'estnik," " v'escaya ptica " (Izv. Ross. Ak. Nauk, 1918, 2069-2100; with an addendum, ibid., 2307-2310), who did not know of the other forms: the meaning " Magian ", etc., attributed to the word by Marr has no basis in fact: it is founded merely on "Japhetite" speculations. The archaeological evidence 1 prystr(-dys), ibid., line 2, is frestr, corruption of Av. xrafstra-. There is much to be said for deriving Bal. rastar from the same word. Restore prystr 'y zmyg in M482 v 7. 2 Also in Man. MPers. (S 11 and Mir.Man., ii). But Parthian 'bystn (once in Mir.Man., iii) is presumably "delay, respite", = Sogdian (')pstnh (see S.T., ii; cf. possibly also Av. apastanarsh6 BSOS., x, 509). 41</page><page sequence="6">W. B. HENNING- has been collected by K. V. Trever in a book, Senmurv-PaskuI (Izd. Ermitaz, 1937), which I have been unable to obtain, and in an article in the Trudd Otdela Vostoka (of the Ermitaz), vol. iii, 1940, 167 sqq., which I have seen. Mme. Trever describes the monster as "the winged dog (krilataya sobaka) of the Ossetic epic " and quotes the word as Ossetic paskuf, paskondzi; such forms are not found in the Ossetic material available here. She wants to add a Ukrainian beast Paskuda to the series; of this I cannot judge, her book not being accessible; one would require convincing proof of its being unconnected with the ordinary Russian appellative paskuda " monstrosity ". The following forms of the word can be regarded as certain:- (1) Talm. my:pw- =ipusqansd, Bdf/d baOrd fol. 73b, with a variant xpiY ? : one wonders whether the word was x:Iptv - *pasqunsd originally. It is traditionally explained as a female raven: what it really means is evident from the context. In 1639 Buxtorf translated (col. 1863): vidi hhy' 'qrwqt' istam ranam [? ?] quae erat tam magna ut Akra [dKpa] pagus Hagaroniae. Pagus hic quam magnus erat ? sexaginta continebit domos. Venit serpens et deglutivit ranam [mispr. ramum]: 't' pwsqns' wbl'h l-tnyn' venit corvus et deglutivit serpentem et consedit in arbore quadam. Vide quantumfuerit robur istius arboris ... The gigantic dragon-eating corvus is a griffin. (2) Man. MPers. pskwc = Paskuc. (3) Pahlavi bskwc -= baskuc. In Pahl. Riv., 2210, it is said that the Spirit of the Dron will fight with certain demons, " ninety-nine times will it fight as fiercely as tnn' bskwc." As the text stands, this would mean "as the bull (TWR') bskwc " or "as bull and bskwc "; one would think of a " winged bull ". However, tnn' may be a rare word misspelt. Should we not read *tnyn' (w) bskwc ". . . as fiercely as dragon and griffin "? Unfortunately, tnyn' = tann;nd, too, is not hitherto known as a Pahlavi word; it could be either loanword or ideogram (for azdahdg ?). Professor Bailey, to whom I submitted this reading, suggested that tnyn' would be a suitable reading also in DkM., 81613, a passage he discussed in Zor.Probl., 29 sq.: kayan xvarreh *tann;nd (pr. tyn') kerb bud "the xvarreh of the Kays took the form of a dragon ". (4) Armenian paskuc translates ypvib in Lev., 11, 13 (Marr 2083). In the Armenian Geography the paskuc hav " bird Paskuc " (in the Whistons' edition, p. 36627) is among the strange animals of India (Marr, 2084 sq.). Marr discussed the explanations given by dictionaries (" a bestial bird, which is called korc ", p. 2083, n. 3), in which a Middle Armenian spelling pasguc is registered (p. 2087); in an unpublished medieval dictionary it is glossed by " bone- swallower " (" ossifrage "),1 p. 2087, n. 2. (5) Georgian p'askunji, var. p'ask'uji translates ypv' in Deut., 14, 13 (Marr, 2083). In late medieval versions of the Shahname p'askunji renders Pers. sTmury (Marr, 2085 sq.). According to Orbelian the p'askunji is "in body like a lion, his head, beak, wings, and feet are like those of an eagle; 1 Cf. Pers. humii (1) a mythical bird, (2)= Pers. ustuxVan-Xvar " ossifrage (osprey)" The confusion is ultimately due to the use made of ypv'b in the Septuagint. 42</page><page sequence="7">TWO MANICH2EAN MAGICAL TEXTS he is downy; some of them are four-legged, some two-legged; he carries off elephants, hurts horses; there is also another kind, which is quite like an eagle, but very big" (Marr, 2083). Orbelian has also paskunYi (with the non-aspirate p), Marr, 2307, n. 1. In a modern fairy-tale p'askunfi occurs (Marr, 2087). There is also a popular dialect-form p'askund or even p'asgund (Marr, 2088). All these are evidently corrupt forms. The old and classical spelling is p'askuniy alone.-The following two are loanwords from Georgian:- (5a) Svanetian p'aysguj in a folk-tale, from p'asguj-i by metathesis (Marr, 2082). (5b) Ossetic pakondzi, a winged creature with seven heads, in Miller's Osetinskie Et'udi, i, 64-8, 126. In an Ossetic tale recorded merely in Russian the same beast is called Paskondi, ibid., i, 146, 161 n. 15 (Marr, 2079 sq.). The latter, which obviously comes from vulgar Georgian p'askund, is not recorded in the Ossetic-Russian-German dictionary (ii, 907, only pakondzi). Marr explains the absence of -s- in one form as due to the influence of a language of the type of Mingrelian (p. 2096). [Professor Bailey kindly informs me that in an Ossetic book in his possession, Iron Adamon Sfaldtstad, fdndzdm cinig, 1941, p. 204, he has found a one-page story entitled Daredzantz Amiran dmd Paguindzd sic " A. of the Daredzan family and P. " (cf. Miller loc. cit.), which thus provides a third Ossetic form of the word.] There are thus only four chief forms: - pusqans (*pasqunsd ?), paskuc (with baskuc), paskuc, and p'askunyi. Armenian and Georgian may have come from Middle Iranian *pasku(n)c/j, but -sk- is strange. The Aramaic may have come from Iranian or vice versa; -s- can be - -6-, in either direction. Perhaps an Akkadian word ? (7) ]dg or ]rg. Before the final letters some weak traces can be seen. They exclude the restoration of prwdg (line 29), which may belong to prwd "below ". nsyd-, instead of nsyy-, is found only here; in Parthian we have nsyd- beside nsyl-. Whether mstgrg does in fact mean " brain " or " skull" (mastayr-ag from Av. mastrayan- Pahl. masturg), is open to some doubt: it was proposed in BSOS., IX, 85, on the strength of our passage. However, the Parthian homograph is clearly "intoxicating" (mastgarag Sogd. mstk'r'k) in the only passage on record, M 312, 9, nxwyn pyd 'wt sy['r]yft bwy, bdyg mstgrg tysng1 "First, meat and smell of decay: second, intoxicating drinks ". In Man. MPers. mstgr (mastgar) occurs once, M 246 V 11, [j']m ... 'y mstgr " inebriating . . . cup ", and there is a doubtful reading (m)strg in M 654, 17 (no context). Thus one could translate as "it settles in ... and in men's intoxicating (drinks) ". [Restore [b']dg " must " ?] (18) hndysysn nxwstyn. In Gnostic parlance the "First Reflexion" (EvOV',rTtLs.) would be the 2Coia: in Manichaeism it should be the First Man. As a matter of fact, the First Man is named Raisonnement anterieur in the 1 In MPers. = thirsty, but in Parthian = drink (cf. Sogdian cS'nt " drink " beside cs,n- "thirst "). 43</page><page sequence="8">W. B. HENNING- Chinese Traite,1 see Chavannes-Pelliot, p. 23 [519], n. 3. Unfortunately, the Chinese term- 4t , does not precisely correspond to the Middle Persian handesisn naxwisten: the usual rendering of handesisn in the lists of the five "limbs of the soul " leads one to expect - J. However, in view of the wider application of the term Evv,iucas in Manichseism (evO. of Life, Ev&amp;. of Death: andesisndn zlwandagdn; marcenc smdra; oiiumliig saqnc6: Polotsky, Mani- fund, 78 sqq.; BBB., 91), it will be better to regard the Chinese as a "terminologically inexact " translation; for that in our text the First Man is meant, should not be doubted.-Thus we need not involve ourselves too deeply in the intricacies of the so-called " macro/microcosmic correspondences " with which the Manicheean authors have caused us so much delight. But it should be pointed out that hndysysn could be used as a substitute for the name of the Gloriosus Rex, MPers. Wddahrdmyazd. For hndysysn is the fourth of the five " limbs of the soul ", and the Gloriosus Rex is the fourth of the five Sons of the Living Spirit: the two series " correspond" to each other. We find it sometimes stated that not the " limbs of the soul" but the " Five Gifts " were so engaged (Waldschmidt-Lentz, Stellung Jesu, 15, cf. my remarks in OLZ., 1934, col. 5, n. 2; Polotsky, Le Museon, xlv, 265), but this is an error induced by the Chinese Traite, 52 [548] sqq., where, however, the " Gifts " are merely said to symbolize the Sons of the Living Spirit (cf. below the note on line 43). We will admit that this error may already have been present in the mind of the man to whom we owe the wohldurchdachte dogmatische Werk, see Polotsky's just remarks in Mani-fund, 77 (first lines). The true facts- if these mental aberrations can be described as facts-are plain from what Theodor bar Qonai says: L'Esprit Vivant ... fit sortir de son intelligence l'Orne- ment de Splendeur . . . de sa reflexion le Roi de gloire et de sa volonte le Porteur (Cumont, Rech. Man., i, 22).2 The relation between the two series is one of full identity in the Kephalaia, see Ch. xxxiii, especially p. 93, 9/10, "the great King of Glory who is the great evOv'pjaisa ". That it must be ascribed to Mani himself is proved by the occurrence of the term Prm'ngyn yzd in the fragment M 98, which there appears once as the name of Atlas, see OLZ., 1934, 751-2. Prm'ngyn yzd is the god of parmdnag = Aoytaruos, cf. Kephalaia, 91, 31, "the 'Q/o&gt;o6pos who is AoyLcrtos ". (20) bwbw.: the last letter cannot be read with certainty, but may be wdw. Hence bwbw(w) ? The Greek Baubo is hardly worth considering. (21) mwmyyn 'y 'yryc[ or 'ydyc[. The restoration of 'yryc['n], i.e. the patronymic of Eric, is merely tentative; a descendant of Fredon would be suitable here, but Eric (IraJ) died sonless (Manfucihr is sometimes said to have been his son). Or should we restore a finite verb, 'yryc[yd] or 'yryc[ynd], and regard mwmyyn as a loanword (with strange ending) from Syr. maumdttha (pl. also maumydthd), Talm. mom2 " oath, exorcism" ? Payne Smith, Thes. Syr., i, 1603, quotes the stat.abs. pl. kl mwmyn "every kind of oath ". Hence, 1 So also in the Chin. Hymn-scroll 124c. 2 Cf.

If 'yryc- is a verb, it could belong to Pahl. boxt ud erixt " freed and bound " (" acquitted and condemned "), see Bartholomae, Sasan. Rechtsb., 2312, and cf. ZII., ix, 19917. (31) tyj is " sharp " (root taig), and tyz is " quick " (root tak). Both have coalesced in Persian: tiz (tez) 1. sharp, 2. quick. In Kawdn A 69 tyzyy 'y ty[gr] can only mean " speed of the arrow ". (33) cyl'n (also 37) and 'spswn (35), see Sogdica, 23, 36. hswd =whetted, from ham and (Pers.) sudan, cf. hs'c-, ZII., ix, 22715, and hs'r from ham-s-; 'swd-dnd'n Sogdica 21 is not clear. 'rm's here is evidently " the hardest metal, probably steel ", certainly not " diamond ", see also Bailey, Zor.Probl., 134. (34) 'wb'y- (ZII., ix, 188) seems to mean "to place " (or " suspend " ?). Together with pyr'mwn it is found also in M 535/6, a fragment of the Sabuhragan, in line 36: 'wd h'n swcysn 'y xysmyn 'y nwn pyr'mwn h'mkyswr 'wb'yyd ['w]d (p)rsp(y)d 1 u p'd 'ystyd. In both passages 'wb'yyd is probably preterite. The meaning of Pahlavi 'wb'y-/hnb'y-, on which see Salemann, Manichaica, iv, 34/5, Bartholomae, Mir.Mund., iv, 13 (GrBd., 1313), is also far from clear.

The word for " secret, mystery " (rdz) is used for some kind of demons or evil spirits also in Mandaean. See Pognon, Une incantation contre les genies malfaisants [MSL., viii, 1892], p. 21, " ils sont lies, les genies . . . les demons . . . tous les etres mysterieux (r'zy') et mauvais . . . les fees etc.", cf. p. 23. They are frequently mentioned in the Qolastd, see Lidzbarski, Man- ddische Liturgien, pp. 4, 22, 36. Once we have there " 360 mysteries that are in the house ", r'zy' dbgw b'yt' (223). In the Manichaean texts rdz is nearly as multivocal as in Mandeean.2 It occurs in the sense of " likeness, pattern, symbol" (cf. Syr. rdzd). Thus twice in M 727c, a fragment of the Parthian original of the Chinese Traite. M 727c 1 [bdyg] rwc pd r'z 'st cy b'my[stwn] = Traite 71 [567], 1 Ce jour . . . imite . . .

The second passage is M 727c 12, . . . rwc, 'ws 'ndrxt 'w sb, pd nxwyn r'z - T.M., iii, 1911-3 (ymd) 6ordki (xormuzta-tdiri soniiniiii) yoldsiirii Traite, 72 [568], 10-12, c'est un signe qui symbolise (la soumission du demon par) le premier (Envoye de la Lumiere) 3; hence, " on the pattern (likeness) of the first." These passages, beside enabling us better to appreciate the value of the " symbolical signs " that make the Traite such delightful reading, make it possible to understand others that up to now caused difficulties.

HIENNING- "you, too, like the burdened Light Ones, show your longanimity "; here I regarded r'z as a verbal form, while H. H. Schaeder 1 took it for the Parthian equivalent of OPers. rddiy, MPers. ray.2 However, pd . . . r'z is parallel to Syriac ba-rdz " sicut ". In the Middle Persian fragment M 219, 20 (Mir.Man., ii, 312, 2, cf. Ghilain, Langue Parthe, 69, n. 35) r'z "stw'nyy 'ws'n wrwysn probably means "the sacrament(s), the profession, and the belief in them ", cf. again Syr. rdzd "sacrament ". (45) 'pr'n "robbers ". As adjective 'pr " predatory " (ZII., ix, 175 sq.) is common as an epithet of demons. As substantive it occurs occasionally as the name of a class of demons, cf. T i M. 100, 112, mzn'n dwy'n 3 'wd 'pr'n rp'g'n 4 'wd 'bd'g'n 5 'rdykr'n ky mr ny 'st " the giants, . .., robbers, assailants, attackers, and fighters, who are numberless " (all groups of demons). A passage of exceptional difficulty is S 9 a 24 (see NGGW., 1932, 219 sq.), 'wm zynd'nyg 'pr hynd dyw drwxs 'wd hrw pryg, where one would be tempted to translate "and my jailers are 'robbers', demons, druis, and all peris ", if the meaning "jailer " could plausibly be suggested for zynd'nyg. In Persian we have zinddni for " prisoner " and zinddnbdn for "jailer ", and so also in Pahlavi, see e.g. MhD., ii, p. 139, zynd'nyk "prisoner" beside zynd'nb'n "jailer ", and in Pazend, e.g. SGV., xvi, 25, 38, zinddni "prisoner ". However, there are some loanwords in Aramaic that apparently presuppose MPers. z1nddn7k/g" jailer ". In the homilies of Aphraates zdynyqy' (var. zydynq') occurs once for "jailer ", and this has been restored as *zndnyq' by Lagarde, but as *zndnqn' by S. Fraenkel, see Brockelmann, Lex. Syr.2, 201. In the Talmud there is a single passage (Taanith, fol. 22a) with zndwq' (zndwqn') "jailer " (Levy, i, 545a), which again is either *zndnyq' or *zndnqn' (an Iranian *z7nddnagdn is, of course, possible).6 Payne Smith, Thes. Syr., i, 1141, has Mand. zndyq' custos, praefectus carceris etc., in the place of *zndnyq'. (46) nyspwrd, from ni + spar, not noticed elsewhere in Man. texts. (48 sqq.)

As spc-/'spyz- (a)spez- can mean " to be verdant ", should one not connect with it Persian sabz "green, fresh, in full bloom ", sabz sudan "sprout, shoot, germinate " (etc.) ? Although there are difficulties,3 this etymology of sabz may seem better than the one proposed by Morgenstierne, EVP., 66; NTS., i, 66. To come to the origin of 'spyxt/'spyz- itself, the obvious etymon is the Iranian base sprg (sparg) " to sprout, blossom ". The past participle *sprxta- would become sprixt in early Middle Persian: for the rule is that -r- becomes brief vowel + r before a simple consonant, but r + brief vowel (generally -i-) before two consonants. As a word may not begin with three consonants, irrespective of a prothetic vowel,4 sprixt was necessarily shortened and became spixt; but where it was preceded by a preverb, no change took place, cf. Parth. wyspryxt (or Saka hasprTya as against spdtai). The present stem, *sprjya-, would develop in the same manner, sprijy-5 &gt; spijy- &gt; spij- &gt; spiz- &gt; (a)spiz-. We have to call in the help of analogy to explain the noun 'spyg, -spyg (Pahl. spyk, inverse spelling), i.e. (a)spig &lt; *sprig &lt; *sprga- (which should have become *spurg).

HENNING- the catalogue originally only five are preserved; owing to gaps in the MS. only four names each of Yaksas and countries are available. The countries mentioned are in North-Western India. Our fragment is closely related to a type of Northern Buddhist literature of which the Mahamayfri and the Candragarbha- sutra are the best known specimens. The Yaksa catalogue of the Mahamayuri was brilliantly commented on by Sylvain Levi, JA., 1915, i, 19-138; to the same scholar we owe a survey of the Candragarbha-sutra, BEFEO., v, 1905, 253-305. None of the Buddhist texts, as far as I can see, offers a five-fold series such as we find in the Manichaean fragment, hour: yaksa: country: number: a food. In the Mahamayuri it is merely yaksas: countries. In the Candragarbha, ch. xvii (pp. 262-8) it is countries: protectors (incl. yaksas). In ch. xviii (pp. 268-281), we have naksatras: countries, the naksatras, arranged in twenty-five groups, being parallel to the twenty-four hours of the Manichaean text. In ch. xix there is first a list of twenty-five caityas which is found, with variations, also in the Avatamsaka-sutra and the Suryagarbha- sutra, where they are put into relation with countries (pp. 281 sq.). It is followed by an enumeration of countries: numbers (of lieux de Bouddha), the countries being (on the whole) the same as in ch. xvii (pp. 281-5). Similarly we have in the Mahasamnipata-sitra, ch. xxii (p. 303), a short list of countries with chief Nagarajas, who are accompanied by thousands of Nagarajas, e.g. "dans le royaume de Tchen-tan [China], le Ndgaraja San-kio avec dix-huit mille Nagarajas ". The Buddhist material thus attests at least a four-fold relation, naksatras: yaksas: countries: numbers. In employing such seemingly meaningless enumerations as charms or parts of charms, the Manichaeans again imitated the Buddhists. Thus the Mahamayuri, the " Great Peacock formula ", is une des cinq grandes formules que le bouddhisme du Nord groupe sous l'appellation collective de Paica-raksd "la Quintuple protection " . . .ne doit son importance qu'a sa valeur magique. II consiste essentiellement dans une serie de formules en abracadabra . .. est donc par excellence une formule de protection contre les serpents. Its catalogue of yaksas is merely a minor item within endless lists of divine beings whose aid is invoked to assure the efficacy of its central formula (J.A., 1915, i, 19-22). Unfortunately that part of the text that made the transition from the intro- ductory sentences to the yaksa-formula is missing in the Manichsean fragment. The Candragarbha-sutra was translated into Chinese in A.D. 566, the Suryagarbha-sitra in 592 (loc. cit., 261). The first part of the Mahasamnipata- sutra, to which the passage from ch. xxii quoted above belongs, was translated between 414 and 421 (ibid., p. 303). Of the Mahamayuri the oldest Chinese version that included the yaksa-catalogue is of A.D. 516; the first incomplete translation, lacking the catalogue, is from between A.D. 317 and 322 (p. 26); the Bower MS., which belongs to the second half of the fourth century, con- tained parts of the book. S. Levi assumes that the Mahamayuri catalogue remonte aux trois ou quatre premiers siecles de l'ere chretienne. Altogether one can perhaps say that the chief period of interest in this kind of literature was 48</page><page sequence="13">TWO MANICHIEAN MAGICAL TEXTS the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries; it is to that time that one would assign also the Manichaean text. The Manichaeans of Chinese Turkestan did not, as a rule, use the Parthian language as their medium; in the rare cases they did so use it, they betray themselves by lack of idioms, monotony of syntax, poverty of vocabulary, and patent mistakes (for details see Ghilain, Langue Parthe, 28-30). As the language of our fragment is intact, its composition must be ascribed to a period when and an area where Parthian was the living language of the Manichaean communities. The area in question is either Parthia itself or the countries bordering immediately on Parthia in the east, where the influence of the Parthian language was strong, and where the Manichaean religion had been spread by Parthian emissaries. We know now that Mani's Apostle of the East, Mar Ammo, went beyond Mary into the former Kusan dominions and reached districts near Balkh, possibly even Balkh itself (see my paper " Warucan- ah ", Journal of the Greater India Society, xi, 85-90 1). This Mar Ammo, who was destined to become the founder of Eastern Manichieism, made Parthian the official language of the Eastern Church. It maintained this status until, in consequence of the spread of Manichaeism still further east, it was replaced by Sogdian in Transoxiana probably under Mar Sad-Ormizd (second half of the sixth century); but in the Parthian home provinces as well as Marv and Balkh Parthian no doubt continued to be used. Of the history of the Manichsean church in Marv and Balkh we know little; that it had strong communities for several centuries is beyond doubt. In the second quarter of the seventh century, Hiien-tsang reported that Manicheeism was the religion par excellence of Persia (Mem., ii, 179, as corrected by Marquart). This means that Manichaeism was a very strong religion in those districts of Persia that bordered on Tokharistan; for it was there that Hiien-tsang received his information on Persia.2 Even at the beginning of the eighth century a Manichaean archbishop resided in Tokharistan (Chavannes-Pelliot, Traite, 176 [152] sq.). 1 I made the mistake there of making use of the WL WC'N MLK', who is mentioned in the Great Inscription of Shapur I. The later discovered Greek and Parthian versions of that inscrip- tion (see below, p. 53), which became accessible to me only in August, 1945, have proved me wrong and shown that the WLWC'N MLK' was the king of Iberia (in Parthian WVYRSN). It is only fair to say that I had envisaged the possibility that Iberia was meant, but had discarded, it because I did not see (and still do not see) how such a spelling, which no doubt underlies the Warjan of the Armenian Geography, could be defended, in view of the other forms of the name, Arm. Wirk', Gr. 'YpKavo, and now Parth. Wyrnb =- Wircfdn. Persian (etc.) Gurj/Gurz is easily derived from Waruc; the difficulty lies in explaining Waruc.-Striking out the WLWC'N MLK' does not necessarily affect the chief argument of my article. As we have two countries of the name of War Jan/ Warcan in the Armenian Geography, one -- Iberia, the other somewhere near Balkh, so should we find two Warucdns in the Iranian material. The Manichsean fragments in which Wrwc'n occurs are in Parthian : the name of Iberia should there be spelt *wyrc'n; for wrwc'n is known only as the Middle Persian form. On the other hand, one feels some hesitation on account of the name of the king, Ha,Bazd (Habazd), which strangely resembles the name of the contem- poraneous king of Iberia, Hamazasp, and could perhaps be regarded as a hypocoristic form of it. 2 That is clear from his mentioning la ville de Ho-mo (Mem., ii, 180) as the eastern frontier of Persia. Ho-mo, as already Marquart pointed out (Erranahr, 75), is a mistake for *Mo-ho (mudt-ydk) = Mary/Mary. VOL. XII. PART 1. 4 49</page><page sequence="14">50 ~~~~~W. B1.

In the texts written in the fourth century (see Ghilain, loc. cit., 26 sq.) their number increases gradually.

The demons are to flee " from before " the " firm " zdwar power, away from this man who wears it, viz. the zawar. The zdwar thus is the amulet itself, and sx[wn] "word " is the text of the amulet. This reminds one of the use of svvacLs as "magically potent substance or object ", see Liddell-Scott-Jones-McKenzie s.v., ii 5, and cf. A. Dieterich, Eine Mithras- liturgie, 46, n. 1.

The deriva- tion given for yd " until " in BSOS., IX, 89, is unsatisfactory. One should pose *yadt and compare OPers. ydtd, which Salemann (GrIrPhil., i, 1, 318) justly connected with Pers. td. The syntactical value of ydtd is precisely that of td. That Pers. td has lost its initial syllable is shown by Man. MPers. dd, from which it cannot be separated in any case. The Pahlavi form was td, not *tdk; the occasional confusion with the word for " piece " occurred after tak " piece " had become ta; to those who persist in writing tak we recommend kak for ka " when ", mak for ma " (that) not ", etc. (Frah. Pahl., xxv, 2, 7). The Pazendists knew dd beside td, see Frah. Pahl., xxv, n. 14; this may account for the second half of Paz. andd. (17) bys p'rn = BTs-pdrn must be Visvapdni, who leads a shadowy existence in Northern Buddhism as the fifth of the "Dhyani-Bodhisattvas "; he is due to create the next world, the world of Maitreya. As his colleague Vajrapdni appears frequently as a yaksa, cf. Konow, Acta Orientalia, viii, 311-17, there is no reason why Visvapdni should not play such a homely role too. In the Candragarbha-sutra the yaksa of Purusapura is Maniipuspa, that of Gandhara is Simhaloma (?). Purusapura is not mentioned in the Mahamayiri catalogue, where Gandhara occurs twice, in 32 (yaksa is Pramardana), and in 72, where the yaksa's name seems to be Vaikrtika; it has been connected with Av. Vaekardta by S. Levi, J.A., 1925, i, 67-9; cf. Bailey, BSOAS., X, 917, n. 1. The discovery that Vaekarata is Gandhara (which I take for proved) is of the greatest importance for the list of countries in Vendidad, ch. 1. It encourages me to propose a new explanation for Vardna, which in the Vendidad precedes hapta handu: should it not be =Skt. Varnu, the "Aopvos of Alexander, the 1 Parth. 'skd ibid. is evidently " thorns" = Sogd. 'skt' " thorns" SCE., 48, also Man. skt' (1060 V4). This meaning fits Av. skaiti better than any other. 52</page><page sequence="17">TWO MANICH.EAN MAGICAL TEXTS modern Buner ? See Sylvain Levi, J.A., 1915, i, 71-3. In the Mahamayuri catalogue Varnu (30) stands shortly before Gdndhdra. The usual identification of Vardna with Geldn (cf. Christensen, Premier Chapitre du Vendidad, 1943, 49 sqq.) is ill-founded; for the Pahlavi version has no authority whatsoever in matters of historical geography, and the derivation of Gel from varnya- is weak (1. -arny- &gt; *-el- against Pers. zarr, etc., 2. *ge- &lt; ve- hardly anywhere in the West, 3. and all this by the time of Pompey, see Strabo, xi, 5, 1, p. 503). (17) pwskwr. At first sight one would perhaps read pwsxwr; but what seems to be a -x- point, proves on closer inspection to be merely a smudge; it stands a little lower than the -x- point should. The form pwskwr is thus as good as assured. Pwskwr, which may represent Puskawur or Posk-, is almost certainly an old form of the name of Peshawar (Purusapura). I asked Dr. L. D. Barnett how one could best explain the relation of pseudo-Sanskrit Purusapura to Puskawur or Poskawur (and Poska/ur, see below). He very obligingly suggested that the original form of the name was Skt. *Pusya(ka)-pura, whence in local Prakrit arose *Pussa(ka)-p. or *Po.ssa(ka)-p. (for sporadic change of u to 6 see Pischel, ? 125); presence or absence of suffixed -ka- creates as little difficulty in Indian as in Iranian; *Pusyaka- is perhaps an abbreviation of a compound name such as Pusya-mitra or Pusya-datta, and the name Pusaka occurs twice in the lists of donors at Satchi (E.I., vol. ii, pp. 104, 387). In popular etymology *possa- was confused with *possa--*possa-posa derived from Skt. purusa or Pkt. purisa through intermediary pursa or pursa, and hence arose the form Purusapura. To this I should like to add that the Iranians were bound to change foreign *Possakapura to *Poskapur, which would later become Poskagur and finally Poskawur; it is necessary to assume an older form *Poskapur in order to account for the presence of an original -k- beside f3/w from -p-. We can now discuss the only other occurrence of a form of the name with interior -k-. In the Parthian and Greek versions, discovered shortly before the war, of the inscription of Rapur I at the Ka'ba-i Zardust (A.D. 262, see BSOS., IX, 845), the easternmost limit of the Sasanian state and at the same time the " Kusan country" (kwsn hstr; i.e. that part of the former Kusan state which the first Sasanians had conquered) is described as Pskbwr - (ejUL7pora0E) IacraKiov'pwv.1 The passage runs like this, " and all the upper countries: Kerman, Sakastan, Tuyran and Makuran, Paratan 2 and Hindastan (hndstn, Gr.

On the Kaabah of Zoroaster = AJSLL., lvii [1940], 4, 341-420.

It is supplemented by two articles by A. T. Olmstead in Classical Philology, xxxvii [1942], 3, 241-262; 4, 398-420. Sprengling's editing technique excites no admiration, and his earlier exploits into the field of epigraphy inspire no confidence; cf. also M. N. Tod's critical remarks in Journal of Roman Studies, xxxiii, 1943, 84 sq., and see M. I. Rostovtzeff, Res Gestae Divi Saporis and Dura, Berytus, viii, 1943, 17-60. Confirmation must be awaited for the Greek spelling of the name which Sprengling (pp. 354 sq.) correctly. referred to Peshawar; Parthian pskbwr is certain. It may be of interest here to mention briefly the parallel sentence in which the north-western limits of the Sasanian empire are defined: " Atropatene (['t]rwptkn), Armenia, Iberia (wyrsn), Sisakan (Siunik'; spelt sykn),1 Albania ('rr'n ?), Baldsakin (bl'skn), up to Mount Caucasus and the Gate of the Alans." 2 The last words are read kpy krwkny [or: grwrny] w 'I'nNTRkny by Sprengling. The photograph, however, shows clearly enough: kpy TWR' w 'I'nn TR" (= Kaf kof ud Aldndn bar); even a non-Semitist can recognize the Aramaic words turit "mountain " 3 and tar'd " gate ". We note that Sprengling has also not succeeded in restoring the appropriate word for " gate " in the Greek text, which is of course r2vAac; he has tried hard to find it and proposes " Alanon [parakh or paakh or phrouriou or pyrgou or kleisouras] ".4 To return now to the Pskbwr passage, after " and the Kusan country up to Peshawar " the Greek text has, according to Sprengling (p. 355), kai (h)e6s Kas Sodikenes kai Tsatsenes oron, the Parthian being W HN 'L k's' swgd W s's; the first s is not clear in the photograph; Sprengling gives s'ss(tn) and restores the word for " mountain "; whether -stn should be read or not I cannot say; it cannot be seen in the photograph, and in any case its presence or absence is immaterial for the meaning of the passage. Sprengling has recognized Sogdiana and Cdc; for Kas he proposes with a fine display of judgment first Cutch, then Kashmir, then Kiss, deciding himself in favour of the last. He takes it for granted that the last Greek word was opiv. With this I cannot agree. We should read Kal Hws Kas CZWKYovrws Kal TraVrr7v7s opwcv = Parthian ud yad 5 Kas Suyd ud Cac (? astan) [wimand].

Shapur thus claims to have held at least a part of Transoxiana, in particular the important first stretch of the Silk Route, from Balkh to the Stone Tower. The definition of his eastern possessions, therefore, ends with the words ". ..

The word is unknown to Old Iranian and seems to be restricted (loanwords from Persian excepted) to the area of Persia and Baluchistan. Could it belong to a substrate language and be connected with Dravidian *suvar (Gondi sawwor, GondiM. hovar " salt ", Tamil, Malayalam uvar " salt- ness ", quoted by T. Burrow, BSOAS., XI, 352) ? For the mineral salt Parthian has the common Iranian na/imaSka (Sogdica, 8, and Add.; na/imaOka cannot be maintained); as nmydk it occurs in M 377 R 5. In addition, there is a strange word for " salty " in Parthian, wl = wal ? The Manichseans had, as of everything else, so also a series of (five) tastes, see Polotsky, Pauly-Wissowa, Suppl., vi, 25012. A full set does not seem to occur in the Iranian material, but there are three fragmentary series, one in Middle Persian (T i M 100, 121 sqq.) and two in Parthian (M 183 and M 840), viz.:- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) MidPers. . - - [dj]n syptg thr Parth. 183 .

Nrg'n = Naragdn, which recurs in line 25, is also not clear; Naravahana (Kubera), who is mentioned in the Candragarbha (p. 264 under No. 9), is not close enough. It is not altogether impossible that Naragdn is an inverse spelling of *Narayan, which could be regarded as a popular or local form of Ndrdyana 1 (in Sogdian 'r'y'n, VJ. and P 8; Saka spellings apud Bailey, BSOAS., X, 909, 914): he, too, is found in the Candragarbha (p. 265 under No. 17). The Middle Ir. ending -agan (earlier -akdn) became -ayan anti finally -iydn, which then was liable to confusion with -iyan from -igdn/-kadn, cf. the case of parnagdn/ parniydn (Pahl. "parnTkdn "), Transact. Phil. Soc., 1945, 153. In the region of Tokharistan -~ign/-7kdn had become -iydn by the middle of the fifth century, see Marquart, Erdnsahr, 215, and this may be true also of -agdn. We cannot tell whether names such as Caydniydn represent Caydn-agdn or Caydn-igdn (cf. Marquart, loc. cit., 226, n. 1). Some words have both -agdn and -igdn originally, e.g. sdsdnagdn in Parthian, sdsadngan in MPers. (22-25) cynyst"n -= Cenistdn (or Cn-) = China, qspyr = Kasp7r = Kasmir.

The proximity of China to Kashmir in our text would by itself be sufficient proof for its dependence upon an Indian prototype. Originally no doubt the Indian CTna was meant, cf. Mahamayuri cat. 80 and S. Levi's remarks, pp. 101, 120. This may also be the explanation of the series Bru-sa-Kashmir-Rgya (i.e. China)-Nagardahra in a Tibetan text, F. W. Thomas, loc. cit., 261.

The Parthian, Sogdian, and Persian words, in conjunction, prove Old Iranian *migda- (and *migdaka-) " fruit "; all of them are collective nouns. This Old Iranian migda- " fruit " cannot well be separated from the Aramaic and Hebrew migdd (etc.) "fruit ", words which are often mis- translated because of etymological considerations (V/ mgd in Arabic and Palmyrene).1 Syriac maydd means nothing but "fruit ", and so does Talm. mygd' (mgd'), for which Levy, iii, 12, gives Kostbarkeit, kostliche Frucht, while the passage he quotes has b-'sprmqy w-mgdy, evidently " with flowers (MPers. isparhmag) and fruit .

A point over d- (changing it to r-) may have disappeared. Much depends here on the proper reading. It seems possible that the town (or district) meant here was the Jatdpura of the Mahamayuri catalogue 77 (see above note on 22-5), which there stands between Kasmira and Cina. As, however, a town of that name is known to no other source, its presence would prove a very close relation between the Manichaean fragment and the Mahamayuri. It is somewhat unfortunate that the reading of the name in the Mahamayari is not quite certain; the Chinese versions have Jatdsura (name of a people mentioned by Varahamihira) and Katdpura, but these two forms add up to Jatdpura, which the Skt. MSS. have in unanimity. S. Levi (p. 101) thinks that Jatapura could be the " town of the Jats " (Jdt, the Zutt of the Muslims), whose name Candragomin may have given as Jarta (BEFEO., iii, 51). Beruni glosses Sindhu-Sauvira by " Multan and Jg - Jahrdwar (?)" (India, 1526, 16616 =transl., i, 300, 302; cf. 1305 i, 260), see Liiders, Weitere Beitrage zur Geschichte und Geographie Ostturkestans, 51 sq., but Marquart, Eransahr, 259, has made it likely that "jahrawar " is the same as J91L, according to Marquart, Candrdwar. If Minorsky is right in deriving the name of the Persian Zutt, Lor;, from that of Ror (Aror), J.A., 1931, i, 281 sqq., the old capital of the Sauviras, Rauruka (Loluva), see Liiders, loc. cit., may lay some claim to the designation of Jatdpura; the name of the yaksa of Rauruka, Prabhamkara, recurs in the line in which Jatapura is mentioned, though not as the name of the genius of Jatapura. Evidently it is impossible, with our present means, to determine the position of this town. The Parthian spelling djrtbwhr (or dstbwhr) is easily explained. It must be remembered that the letter we transliterate as j has, in Parthian, the value of z at the beginning of a word (in MPers. it is j). If a foreign '- was to be reproduced accurately, a com- bination of two letters had to be used, either ds- or preferably dj- (- dz-). One can compare Parthian tsy, tsy, a fairly frequent variant of cy = ce, Avestan tc 8c d5J (Bartholome, GrIrPhil., i, 1, 158), and Mandeean ts (Noldeke, Mand.Gram., p. 2 n.). Unetymological h in the group vowel + r has been noticed before, see JRAS., 1942, 239 sq., on Pers. sipihr and Parth. zyncyhr, to which ManMPers. nhcyhr 1 should perhaps be joined; in the case of -bwhr the numerous Parthian names in -buhr "son " (early pronounced as -bur) added to the temptation. Thus dstbwhr could be Jatabir, while djrtbwhr = Jartabur would remind one of Candragomin's Jarta; however, it is common knowledge that the Indian linguals were often represented by r + dentals (cf. also bys p'rn in our fragment), and so we should regard djrtbwhr merely as an accurate rendering of Jatapura. The etymology recently proposed for this word by H. W. Bailey, BSOAS., xi, 774, n. 1. would require -hr in the MPers. form. The absence of -h- from all other spellings, even that in the inscription of Shapur, is against *naxti-cira-. One would also hesitate to regard Sogdian nyg'yr as a loanword (the regular Sogdian form should end in -ig). 57</page><page sequence="22">W. B. HENNING- Excursus The Parthian ending -ende(h). In an article " Contribution a l'histoire de la flexion verbale en iranien" (Le Monde Oriental, xxxi, 1937 [publ. 1944], 63-86) Professor H. S. Nyberg has returned to a problem to which he had devoted several pages in the intro- duction to his Hilfsbuch des Pehlevi (i, 13-19; 1928): the problem of the two mysterious verb-endings (xl resembling BYN; x2 resembling Av. q) that can be added to ideograms in Pahlavi. Professor Nyberg has considerably modified his earlier views, which had come in for a good deal of criticism; but he still maintains his analysis of both x1 and x2 as ;" (with which I had-ill-advisedly 1 -concurred). He has abandoned his interpretation of the value of xl as -endeh and admits that the arguments put forward against the importation into Pahlavi of an optative ending that can justly be described as a distinctive feature of the Parthian language are not without some force; but he declares that, as most Pahlavi books had been written in Northern Persia, in Ray and Azerbaijan (p. 83),2 the Parthian -endeh might have intruded into Pahlavi occasionally, and he claims to be able to prove that it did so intrude into a page of the Dinkerd. As there is little profit in arguing for or against a thesis that a word, form, or ending might or might not have been borrowed by one language from another, I will confine myself to an examination of the single Dinkerd passage that in Nyberg's opinion is sufficient to prove his case. The passage, from the beginning of the seventh book (DkM., 593, 11 sqq.), is about the First Man and Woman. God sends a minor divinity to them to give them some instructions. The messenger does as he is told. His performance is described in the same terms as the order itself, except for the forms of the verbs, which are (according to Nyberg) third persons singular optative in the order, but past participles in the description of its execution. Thus we have two sets of forms, viz.:- 3rd sg. opt. SGYTWN-DS zhkDS afrnienDS p.p.p. SGYTWN-t (= raft) zast dfrnemn7t -=- se rendre faire naztre donner la benediction The group of letters that looks like DS 3 is to be analysed as *dyh = *deh. All the three optatives, which are to prove the existence of the ending -endeh in Pahlavi, have to submit to some measure of emendation. dfrinendeh est une haplologie assez naturelle (ou simple haplographie ?) de dfrTenenndeh (p. 85), the verbal stem being dfrTnen-; it may be censorious to point out that the 1 For the arguments against his analysis are overwhelmingly strong. No such ending (T"') is known in any type of the more ancient Pahlavi material (inscriptions, Dura-Europos, coins, papyri, psalter), a large part of which antedates our oldest Pahlavi manuscripts by as much as a millennium. Indeed, the letter n had fallen into disuse (except in the fossilized ideograms, i.e. word pictures) even before the third century. The schriftgeschichtliche Analyse seems to operate in vacuo. 2 In my view they were written in Southern Persia, in Fars and Kerman. 3 I am using capital letters here where I want to indicate the shape of the Pahlavi signs without expressing an opinion on their value, but small letters for their value. Thus, DS can 58</page><page sequence="23">TWO MANICH2EAN MAGICAL TEXTS element -en- of -endeh- is thus not attested here. In the combinaison absurde zhkDS, -k- est une faute pour -yn-, et -ds pour -dyh; nous obtenons zhyndyh = zahendeh, which together with its past zast should belong to Pers. zihidan produire, but is translated faire naitre as if it were a causative verb; would it be carping to stress that the syllable -en- is here, too, not in the text ? The third form, *SGYTWN-deh, should, by all rules of Pahlavi grammar, represent *raudeh; for SGYTWN stands for raw- (before vowels) or rau(-) (in pause and presumably 1 before consonants). But in view of the other forms Nyberg commands us to read rawendeh instead. It will be clear already now that the passage is incapable of proving -endeh for Pahlavi, simply because this ending does not occur in it; but Nyberg concludes on ne peut done nier que lesformes en -endeh ne se trouvent dans les textes rediges dans la langue officielle du sud-ouest, etc. (p. 86). The important parts of the Dinkerd text are transcribed by Nyberg in this way: en-i6 ha6 veh-den paitak ki-s guft Ohrmazd 5 kas pat ahradih apar- arzan-k, evak hac yazdan, ku: kas i pat ahrJS$h apar-arzanik apar ravendeh 5 Masye u Masydne 2 u zahendeh hdn i ave yortdk nan hac Masye u Masyane; han avesan dfrTnendih ku . . . srayisn ahuvar 2 pat apac-estisn7h dev u druz. He translates: ce qui signifie ceci: il est manifeste de par la bonne religion qu'Ohrmazd dit a un tel qui etait d'une noblesse superieure en justice, a savoir un des dieux: " Un tel qui est d'une noblesse superieure en justice se rendra chez Masye et chez MasyaneT; il fera naitre de Masyj et de Masydne le pain fait de ble; il leur donnera la benediction en disant . . . [we omit his words which are repeated 3 in the execution of the order] lire deux ahuvar afin de repousser les demons males et femelles. In the repetition there is a brief additional sentence: u raft kas etc. api-s zast etc. api-sdn ddt api-s avesan dfrTnjnit ku etc. api-s srait ahuvar 2 etc. - et un tel ... se rendit . .. il fit nattre . . . et il le leur donna; il leur donna la benediction en disant . . et il lit deux ahuvar . . . With regard to Ohrmazd's messenger we learn that l'etre divin est appele " un tel ", kas, et evidemment Ohrmazd s'adresse a lui a la 3me p. (p. 84). The assurance with which Professor Nyberg presents his theories should not blind us to the fact that his reading and interpretation are equally wrong in all important points. Even the first words are incorrectly translated; they mean " what follows, too, is an Avestan text ". That indeed the passage is the Pahlavi version of a lost Avestan text, is manifest from its peculiar syntax and style and has to be kept before our eyes if we want to understand it properly. The next point which attracts the reader's attention is the peculiar way of stand for ds, gs, ys, in my view also for dd', dy', etc. The drawback is that those who are not acquainted with the peculiarities of the Pahlavi script will be prevented from following the discussion. It is outweighed by the precision secured by this mode of writing; the printed Pahlavi type is inadequate for our purposes. 1 The case does not occur. 2 Recte : Mass ud Masanf. 3 In this case there should be no change at all in the wording; but there is raset against rasdt.

HENNING- referring to God's messenger as " somebody ".1 Any divinity, lesser or least, should be entitled to the courtesy of a name. It is hard to imagine an expression of this type "God said to somebody 'somebody shall go.', etc.", especially when it is meant to convey " God said to . . . ' you shall go ', etc." However, we need only glance at comparable Avesta passages to understand the con- struction here, e.g. Vd. ii, 22, dat aoxta ahuro mazda yimdi: yima srira, etc. = Pahl. tr. u-s guft Ohrmazd 6 Yim ku Yim [i] nevak - and Ohrmazd said to Yima " oh Yima, beautiful one, etc." The name of the addressed person occurs twice, first as dative (Pahl. ... .), then as vocative, and so it is in our Dinkerd passage too. Verbal forms that occur in oratio directa and convey a command to the addressed, may confidently be expected to be 2nd persons, singular or plural, as the case may be. It is true, custom may sometimes admit the use of the 3rd person instead. Thus, in eighteenth century German one could (and did) say to an underling " Scher' Er sich zum Teufel "; but to the speakers of either Avestan or Pahlavi such a convention was unknown, and in any case Ahura Mazdah would never have talked to anyone in so markedly impolite a fashion. So the verbal forms of the Dinkerd text are 2nd persons singular of the optative, or, as the existence in Pahlavi of a special form for the 2nd sing. opt. is doubtful, of the indicative with the sense of the optative, or of the imperative. Who then was Ohrmazd's messenger ? His name is spelt HDS, which Nyberg, interpreting it as 'ys, regards as the ideogram for kas "somebody ". The correct reading is hds = Hadis, who is a minor divinity entrusted with the care of the homestead.2 He is rarely mentioned in the Zoroastrian scriptures, so rarely indeed that in the Dinkerd passage a glossator found it advisable to warn the reader against the misreading kas by adding evag az yazddn " one of the divinities "; but his name should be familiar to all students of the Zoroastrian religion since the time when J. Darmesteter, in a brilliant little paper, introduced him to the learned world (Ptudes Iraniennes, ii, 1883, pp. 201-3). Spelt as in the Dinkerd, hds is found e.g. in the Pahl. version of Vispered, 9, 5 (= Sp., 1024), but hdys also occurs (Visp., 1, 9 - Sp., 1, 31). The epithet of Hadis, pad ahrcdyh abar arzdn;g, represents a single Avestan word, but this does not occur in our Avesta. One should attempt its reconstitu- tion. arzdnmg mostly translates Av. nas and han, rarely also other words, e.g. barax8a: abar arzdnik is found for Av. pairis.handna. The closest parallel is perhaps pad ahray7h frdz dfrid = Av. asava.fraOwarsta- Y., 71, 6 (= Sp. 70, 22). One might be tempted to suggest *asava.pairis.hanhanana "who has been granted (the reward) by the Holy One ", but it cannot be denied that in view of the variability of the Pahlavi versions there are several other possibilities, e.g. *aso.upa.bdarxSa " esteemed by Rta " (cf. pad ahrdy;h sarddr 1 That, rather than " un tel ", is the meaning of kas. 2 This could have been found out easily enough by referring to West's translation (SBE., 47, p. 7) or to Christensen, Premier Homme, i, 28 sq.

In any case Nyberg's translation qui etait d'une noblesse superieure en justice is inadequate. We can now reconstitute the beginning of the original Avestan text (with due reserve as regards the epithet): dat aoxta ahuro mazda hadise asava.pairis.hawhanandi: hadis asava.pairis.- hanhanana .... Hadis went to pay his visit to Adam and Eve and became involved in one 1 of those delightful bits of folklore that European scholars, from time to time, contribute to the treasures of Oriental thought: il fit nattre de Masye et de Masydan le pain fait de ble et il le leur donna. The Zoroastrian books, it is true, tell us of the origin of plants (including species of grain) from the gigantic corpse of the Primordial Bull who died seventy years before Adam and Eve appeared in the world, cf. the Pahl. texts discussed by B. Geiger, BSOS., VIII, 551 sqq.2; but that Adam and Eve bring forth finished loaves, with Hadis apparently acting as midwife, is a novel feature. One is sorry to have to demolish this charming story. The Pahlavi verb zastan, common in the Pahl. versions of the Avesta, means not " faire naitre " but "to ask "; it renders Av. yjad- "to ask" to which it belongs by etymology, cf. further Man.MPers. zast-, ZII., ix, 188. Its present is spelt in various ways, z- (instead of zd-= zay- before -y-) in zyt, Vd., 31 (Sp., 19 papu.) = yai8yq, FOim, xv = aiSyat [but both probably wrong for zst], or zd- = zay- in zdynd, Vd., 1929 (Sp., 21714) - -Yai5yenti, or zdy- in ZHYM = zdyym 1st sing.

The last mentioned form, which in the Yasna renders the 2nd sing. opt., is identical with the form in our Dinkerd passage, the sole difference being this that in the Dinkerd stem and ending are written as if they were two separate words, whereby z'd-, standing virtually in pausa, has automatically assumed the disguise of Z'K; that final d/g/y frequently look like -k, is, one trusts, known to students of Pahlavi palaeography (cf. e.g. BSOAS., XI, 732). It is appropriate to mention here that over thirty years ago Bartholomae discussed the verbal forms in this Dinkerd text and correctly read zdyeh, which he translated rogas; needless to say, he understood all 1 Another we owe to J. Stephenson, The Zoological Section of the Nuzhatu-l-Qulub, p. 44, "the spider . . . they prepare a net as a snare for flies, which form their food. The male spins the thread and becomes a female [my italics]." The Persian text has " the male spins the warp and the female the woof (pud)" 2 Forms derived from MPers. venok occur in modern Iranian not only in Nayini (as Geiger says, ibid., p. 552). Cf. Tajiki bun " lentil " (Mann, i, 53); Bakht. gindf " lentil " (ibid , ii, 186); Codex Cumanicus, 110, 8, bunu = "Latin " erbegia (i.e. ervilia) = Turkish brizac (i.e. J9.- y ). Differently Grenbech, Koman. Wb., 72 s.v. byrcaq; erbegia is hardly = Ital. erbaggio, but rather == Ital. rubiglia, Span. arveja, etc. [Persian dictionaries have compounds with bunu : bun.u-surx, bunu-siydh, bunu-mas, bunu-naxle, for various species of lentils and peas.] 61</page><page sequence="26">W. B. HENNING- the other forms properly too (WZKM., xxix, 17). Nyberg does not mention Bartholomse's article, which he quoted in his Hilfsbuch, ii, 18, 1. Hadis, therefore, "went to Adam and Eve and asked them for bread of that corn. They gave it (to him) and he blessed it for them." " That corn" is appropriate here; for in the lines preceding our passage we read that Ohrmazd had provided Adam and Eve with cattle and corn, and instructed them in the cultivation of corn, etc. (DkM., 5938-11). They had bread even before Hadis appeared on the scene. Hadis asked them for some and they gave it (to him): the corresponding Pahlavi words, u-sdn ddd (in N.'s transcription api-sdn ddt), appear in Nyberg's translation as et il le leur donna. Professor Nyberg energeti- cally demands that his critics should not confine themselves to briefly pointing out their divergent views, but should produce lengthy reasoned statements, quoting chapter and verse; would a classical philologist be expected to give reasons for rejecting the translation of dabant as "he gave " ? The object of Hadis' mission is to teach mankind to speak a blessing over their food before sitting down to it. The blessing should conclude with the formula known as Ahunavar to Zoroastrians (as Ahuvar to Nyberg): u-s srud ahunavar 2 " and he (Hadis) recited two Ahunavars ". Nyberg's version, et il lit deux ahuvar, instead of il lut, embodies an error that compares with the one he committed in his rendering of u-sin dad. In his order Ohrmazd said to Hadis srayisn ahunavar 2 = " you shall recite two Ahunavars ". The form in -isn has here (as often) the value of an imperative or optative; srayisn/srad should join the three doubly attested verbs as a fourth. We have now cleared the way for a consideration of the ending DS, which is here used for the 2nd person singular. Nyberg's article leaves one with the impression that the ending occurred solely in the Dinkerd passage; but in fact neither is it uncommon nor has it escaped the attention of scholars. We have already mentioned z'd-DS as the equivalent of Av. yaiSyiys, which is 2nd sing. optative, in Yasna, 6510. No deep study of the Pahlavi versions is required to discover that the ending DS is used, with fair regularity, to represent the Avestan 2nd sing. opt. In order to discover that, we have to be acquainted with the idiosyncrasies of both the manuscripts and the printed type that was (and still is) used in Europe. The only edition worth the name of the Pahl. Yasna, Vispered, and Vendidad, is that by Spiegel (1853-8). For the text of the Yasna he based himself, quite sensibly, on the MS. K5. We can now control his readings, thanks to the full-length facsimile of K5 we owe to the enterprise of Dr. Munksgaard; it is well known that K5, written in A.D. 1323, is one of our oldest and most important Avesta MSS. (if not the most important). An exceptionally clear DS occurs in K5, e.g. in YMLLWN-DS, fol. 294r. 3 (= [fra]mra of Y., 6510, a corrupt form standing for either 2nd sing. impt. or opt.): in Spiegel's edition (p. 22719) we have YMLLWN-HH instead. And so it is everywhere. Throughout his work Spiegel printed HH for the DS of the MSS. He did that because he felt convinced that there was no real distinction between the two groups and because he knew that the MSS. 62</page><page sequence="27">TWO MANICHAEAN MAGICAL TEXTS themselves frequently failed to maintain any such distinction. -But he was not consequent and sometimes printed DS (which in his print is not different from DDH) when he realized that the signs were meant to express ds, ys, etc.; thus he gives BDS (or rather BDDH) for bes (e.g. p. 2269) while K5 292r. 1 has BDS with precisely the same group as in the verb ending. It should also be noted that the scribe of K5 made no distinction between DS and DDH; cf. e.g. 'LWNDS = arvandTh 295v. 1, GDH'wmnDS =farrah-omand7h 295r. apu., 'HL'DS -=ahrdy7h 298r. apu. et passim (all of them DS as in YMLLWN-DS), but also 'm'wnDDH = amdwandTh 295r. 11, etc. In common with the scribes of most old MSS., he thought very little of the difference between s and yh (etc.), and so wrote drwdstyh 306r. 6 or 'p'tyh 323v. 2 with S or conversely 'P-s 248v. u., 'YK-s 301r. 6, nywksyt 227v. 10 with clear DH. The " wrong " use of s and yh/d', etc., is nearly as common as the " correct" one. This applies also to K20. It is less easy to decide whether the scribe of K5 intended to make any difference between DS/DDH, on the one hand, and HH on the other. It is a matter of some doubt. But it is quite certain that HH is conventionally written for DDH in many words in all Pahlavi MSS. Thus we have HH with the value of yd' = iya in mddiydn, miydn, niydg, niydz, viydban, siya(h), friydd, pddiydwand, ziydn, pit(i)ydrag, siydwus (e.g. K35 79r. 4 sqq.). This same mode of spelling is habitually applied to the ending DS in later MSS. where it appears as HH, i.e. precisely as in Spiegel's print. There is thus some justification for his mode of printing; for as he dealt with more than one MS. in editing his text, he could not very well be expected to produce as " variants" what are merely mannerisms of handwriting. Examples for DS/HH: B'YHWN-HH = ayasois, Vd., 914 (Sp., 13113); 'sncHH = paiti.hincois, Vd., 916 (Sp., 1324 sqq.); frakdrayois, Vd., 911, appears as ZRYTWN-.HH ap. Sp., 13019 sqq., as -DDH once in Jamasp's edition and in FOim., v. It alternates with -yh and the 2nd sing. impt. in Vd., 175 (Sp., 19312-4), HPLWN- .HH avakanois ... YBLWN-yh abarois. .. .pr'c YMLLWN framruyd. In K5 it has sometimes a semicircle each above and below, see pr'c YBLWN-DS =frabar6is (Y., 6510) fol. 293v. u. The same ending looks like a cross between DS and x2 in YBLWN- in K5 251r. 5 = -bardhi. Outside the Pahlavi versions of the Avesta the ending is used both for the 2nd sing. indic. and, in some MSS., also for the 3rd sing. opt. of the verb " to be ". Thus AV. 3, 6, Y'TWNt HWH-HHI " you have come " (twice) with variants -DDH, -H, -HY. PahlRiv., 833, pursed ku kanTzag ke xwes HWH-HH goved ku . . . man ... t6 xwes hom ' he will ask ' my girl, whom do you belong to ? ', and she will say '... to you'". Ibid., 231, 6, zivist HWH-HH "you have lived ", Y'TWN-t HWH-HH "you have come ". Ibid., 147 pu. to ke mard HWH-.IH " who are you ? ". These are all clear indiqatives. As 3rd sing. opt. HWH-HH occurs, in conditional clauses, etc., nearly throughout as auxiliary verb, in Pahl. Riv., 276, 384 sqq., 46 papu., 52 pu., 531, 822, 9, 864 (here variant HWH-HDH), etc.; occasionally the ideogram HWH is then omitted so that 63</page><page sequence="28">W. B. HENNING- spellings such as 'MT .... SGYTWN-tHH arise (Dd., p. 457, " as if... went," Pers. raft-e), cf. the spelling YHWWN-tDB for YHWWN-t HWH-DB in " classical " Pahlavi (= Pers. bid-j; cf. Spiegel, Gramm. Huzv., ? 117, n. 2). The function of DS/H.H in the texts translated from the Avesta as the ending of the 2nd sing. opt. (or subj.) was on the whole correctly understood by Spiegel in 1856 (Gramm. Huzv., p. 110). In 1874 West gave DS or HH (mentioning both forms) as the ending of the 2nd sing. opt., and noticed the use of HWH-HH and its variants as 2nd sing. indic. and 3rd sing. opt. (Glossary and Index, p. 344). In the Grundriss der Iranischen Philologie (1895-1901), i, 1, 312, Salemann discussed the endings again; he noted all possible spellings, including both DS and HH, but doubted whether we should assume a separate form for the 2nd sing. opt. (or subj.). Nyberg, in 1944, does not know of the existence, outside his Dinkerd passage, of an ending whose function has been established for nearly a century. How is the ending DS/HH to be read ? It would be wrong to disregard the well-defined function it has in the oldest layer of Pahlavi texts. Spiegel was certainly right in maintaining that it should not be confused with the ending of the 2nd sing. indicative. The 2nd sing. opt. of the aya-class would end in -e &lt; -ai &lt; -ayais in Middle Persian; this, therefore, is the appro- priate reading of DS/IHH. After the loss of final -h, the 2nd sing. opt. became indistinguishable from the 2nd sing. indic., which had been -eh &lt; -aih &lt; -ayah &lt; -ayahi; the 2nd sing. opt. disappeared and merged in the 2nd sing. indic. The ending DS/HH thus became redundant and served for final -e or -,1 at first only in the 2nd sing. indic., then also in the 3rd sing. opt., and even in nouns such as gytHH "world "= gete or rather geti (cf. the Old Syriac spelling gtyh, Noldeke, Festgruss Roth, 35, n. 5), MHHLHH = MahlT, MHHLHHNHH 2 = MahliydnT, Pahl. Riv., 2911 sqq. As soon as the function and phonetic value of DS/.LHH are understood, it also becomes clear what-letters are compounded into this ending. It will be remembered that in old MSS. the ligature is sometimes furnished with two semicircles (above, p. 63), of which the one above represents the upper half of the head of D and the one below indicates the tail of either D or B; both together prove that the group contained D. The whole group represents the old ending -ydy. If we apply to the ancient Pahlavi material, we find that from as early as the third century onwards -ydy is regularly employed for final -e/-;. It occurs often in the Pahlavi Psalter, see Schaeder, Ung. Jbb., xv, 574 sq., but is found even in inscriptions by Sapur I, see provisionally BSOS., IX, 829. In the Pahlavi Psalter a direct ancestor of our DS is attested in Ps., 129, 3 HT . . . NTLWN-ydy "if thou . . .shouldest mark"; NTLWN-ydy = paye is 2nd sing. opt. (not indic. as some authors say). It is 1 The distinction of -e- and -i- in MPers. and early NPers. is a matter of some difficulty. 2 This spelling exemplifies the three most common values of the group HH, viz. (1) ' ' (4 + 4), (2) yd' = iya, (3) in final position z/e. One would like to know how Nyberg would propose to read the word; in view of his words getdh " world " and frahdt " help ", one would expect Mahrahdanh. 64</page><page sequence="29">TWO MANICHA3AN MAGICAL TEXTS 65 possible that the ending X2 is, amongst other things, also a variant of " DS ", cf. K. Barr, BSOS.,. V1II, 402 sq. We must not forget to mention that several years before he published the article here under discussion, Professor Nyberg happened on a passage in the Pahl. liv., a late text in which the ending HIJ is particularly freq-uent as 2nd sing. indic. and 3rd sing. opt. (La le'gende de KeresJspa. Oriental Studies .. . C. E. Pavry, 1934 [written 1929], 336-352). He then interpreted the ending as -&amp;h, explained evident indicatives as subjunctives (although -Jh is unknown to MPers. as ending of the 2nd sing. sbj.), and enriched the Pahlavi grammar by the 3rd sing. opt. h&amp;h. There is no point in discussing the details of an explanation that results in so peculiar forms. What is noteworthy is that the ending that he then explained as -nh, and the ending that he now interprets as -endJh, are one and the same ending; their identity may be slightly-only very slightly-obscured by the accidents of handwriting and printing type, but is for that not any the less real. It is not as if Nyberg had abandoned the earlier reading -Jh to substit-ute -indih for it; on the contrary, he now quotes it with approval (p. 72, n. 1; p. 81, n. 2).
