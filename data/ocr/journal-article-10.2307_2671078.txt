<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sixteeinith CenituryJourtial XXXI/3 (2000) Santi di Tito's Creation of Amber in Francesco I's Scrittoio: A Swan Song for Lucrezia de' Medici Corinne Mandel University of Western Ontario This article identifies a portrait of Lucrezia de' Medici (1545-61), daughter of Duke Cosimo I de' Medici and Duchess Eleonora of Toledo, and wife of Duke Alfonso II d'Este, in Santi di Tito's 1572 Creation of Amber, commissioned for the Scrittoio of Francesco I de' Medici in the Palazzo della Signoria, Florence.The inclusion of a portrait of the patron's sister in a mythological painting suggests that the iconogra- pher,Vincenzio Borghini, and possibly Francesco himself, wished to commemorate a member of the Medici family allegorically. By drawing on numismatic evidence and written records of her short life, this study unveils the rationale for connecting Lucrezia with Phaethon's fatal escapade and the conconmitant formation of amber. In the final analysis, Santi's Creation of Amber conveys an eschatological message con- cerning birth, marriage, and death-or rebirth-that transcends the life and times of its earthbound protagonist "That's my last Duchess painted on. the ivall, Looking as if she iwvere alive. I call That piece a yvonder, now" Robert Browning, My Last Duchess IN THE GIORNATA PRIMA OF THE RAGIONAMENTI, penned circa 1559-60, Giorgio Vasari makes a point of twice mentioning the 1558 marriages of Lucrezia and Isa- bella de' Medici, the sisters of his feigned companion Francesco de' Medici. In the first instance, in the introductory pages of the Giornata Prinma,Vasari remi- nisces about the auspicious events that have taken place during the twenty years in which Francesco's parents have lived at the Palazzo della Signoria: His mother, Duchess Eleonora of Toledo, gave birth to Medici princes; his father, Duke Cosimo, emerged victorious in the war against the Sienese, amongst others; his brother, Don Giovanni, achieved the cardinalate; and "the marriages with the duke of Ferrara and the duke of Bracciano were consummated in it."l In the 1Giorgio Vasari, Ragionamenti Sopra le inuen tioni... dipinte in Firenze nel Palazzo di loro Altezze Serenissitne: Con lo Illustriss. &amp; Eccellentiss.

Since the remain- ing frescoes in the Terrazza di Giunone contain neither portrait likenesses nor personal impresa of Medici family members, one must conclude thatVasari's comparison ofJuno and Eleonora was a poetic conceit, based on symbolism then current at the Medici court.4 Given the absence of visual clues, an uninitiated viewer allowed entree to the piano nobile would have required prompting to understand the assimilation of Juno to Eleonora, or Cosimo to Jupiter, in the manner ofVasari's explanation to Francesco in the Ragionamenti. The same holds forVasari's references to the Este- and Orsini-Medici unions. Alfonso (who issued from the celebrated Estense house and whose mother was Princess Renee of France) and Paolo Giordano (a papal vassal from the illus- trious Orsini family) brought a prestige to the Medici that would not be sur- passed until Francesco's marriage to the emperor's daughter,Johanna of Austria, in 1565. As the personifications of Abundance and Power in the Terrazzo di Giunone amply demonstrate, Renaissance marriages were about wealth, lineage, and political cachet, not romantic love. No wonder, then, thatVasari wished to emphasize the marriages of Lucrezia and Isabella in his Giornata Prima, penned before negotiations for Francesco's marriage had been initiated. FollowingVasari, one may credit Eleonora with suggesting Alfonso d'Este as a match for Lucrezia and Paolo Giordano Orsini for Isabella, yet men still signed marriage contracts. Cosimo had signed the marriage contract for the Medici-Orsini union in 1555, and that for the Medici-Este union on 13 April 1558, after the peace treaty between his Spanish ally, King Philip II, and his longtime rival Duke Ercole II d'Este, whom Pope Paul IV had left to fend for himself when the Spanish 2Vasari, Ragioniamventi, 54-55, for this and the following. 3Vasari, Ragionarnenti, 55: "oltre che nelle nozze fatte per loro Eccellenze, &amp; ora per le Illustris- sime vostre [Francesco's] sorelle, e sua figliuole, nel collocarle al Principe di Ferrara, &amp; al Signore Paolo Giordano Orsino, si verifica il medesimo, che certo S.

To state that both marriages were disastrous is to indulge in litotes. Lucrezia died in 1561 at the tender age of sixteen, while pregnant, according to her doc- tors6; Isabella, the "star" of the Medici family, albeit an adulterous one, died by strangulation at her husband's hands in 1576, at the age of thirty-three. Isabella seems not to have been mourned by her brother Francesco, grand duke ofTus- cany by 1576; her tragic demise was evidently overshadowed by her extramarital liaison, as both he and his brother, Cardinal Ferdinando I, maintained friendly relations with Paolo Giordano Orsini thereafter.7The death of Lucrezia in 1561 was of a wholly different order. Lucrezia's premature death while she was believed pregnant, was a blow to both the Este and Medici families, who naturally had high hopes for a male heir.8 As I shall argue, a decade after Lucrezia's death, Francesco had her life and marriage to Alfonso II d'Este commemorated for all time, following the precedent set, according toVasari, in the Terrazzo di Giunone, but in an explicit way, by having her portrait included in a mythological painting. Francesco's apparent desire to remember his sister was realized byVincenzio Borghini, Benedictine prior of the Ospedale degli Innocenti and iconographer of the Scrittoio in the Palazzo della Signoria; byVasari himself, the Scrittoio's designer (fig. 1); and by Santi di Tito, author of the 1572 Creation ofAmber (fig. 2). Santi di Tito's Creation ofAmber is sometimes imprecisely called The Sisters of Phaethon in art historical literature.9 AsVincenzio's nephew Raffaello Borghini first explained in II Riposo of 1584, Santi's painting concerns the collection of amber. 10 Thanks to the discovery of Paola Barocchi and Michael Rinehart, we 5For Lucrezia's marriage contract, seeVasari's letter of 12 May 1558 to Duke Cosimo in Der Lite- rarische Nachiass Giorgio Vasaris, ed.

Scott Schaefer suggests Ovid's Metamorphoses as Borghini's most probable literary source and identifies Santi's mythical protagonists.12 Both Rinehart and Schaefer make the important discovery that Giovanni Poggi's 1910 restoration of the Scrittoio resulted in the correct placement of Santi's Creation of Amber. It originally was located with another painting directly above Francesco's cabinet or desk (studiolo), in the center of the Scrittoio's southern wall, its cur- rent position.13 It therefore occupies a central position on the wall dedicated to the element of water, facing the Scrittoio's northern wall dedicated to the ele- ment of fire. As one of two centerpieces above Francesco's studiolo, the Creation ofAmber therefore helps to adorn the transverse axis of the Scrittoio, as the tondo portraits of Duke Cosimo and Duchess Eleonora help to adorn the room's main, east-west axis. Given that Francesco housed precious objects in the cupboards (sportelli) behind the paintings on the lower register of the Scrittoio, Schaefer rea- sonably concludes that he likely housed amber in the studiolo beneath the Cre- ation ofAmber Jack Spalding subjected the Creation ofAmber to the most rigorous visual and iconographical analysis to date. He concludes that Santi had included "unneces- sary" components from the Ovidian source in order "to enliven the composi- del Gran Duca Francesco [Santi painted] due historie a olio sopra lastre di pietra, luna dimostra i modi co' quali si ritrova l'Ambra...." 11Michael Rinehart, "A Document for the Studiolo of Francesco I," in Art the Ape of Nature: Stu- dies in Honor of H.

For the water wall, Borghini listed "pesca di Coralli con andromeda et col capo di medusa [Vasari's Creation of Coral], pesca di porpora [Santi's Discovery of Purple], pesca di perla [Allori's Pearl Fishing]." 12Scott Jay Schaefer, "The Studiolo of Francesco I de' Medici in the PalazzoVecchio in Florence" (Ph.D. diss., Bryn Mawr College, 1976), 399-400 and fig. 5a, for this and the following, unless otherwise noted. Borghini owned four copies of Ovid's Metamorphoses, including Lodovico Dolce's Trasformiazioni, which, Schaefer recognized, furnished "a woodcut of the scene with the position of the sisters reversed." For Borghini's Latin and Italian editions of the Metanmorphoses, see Anna Maria Testa- verde Matteini, "La Biblioteca erudita di Don Vincenzo Borghini," in Firenze e la Toscana dei Medici nell'EEuropa del'500, 3 vols.

Olschki, 1983), 2:628, 630, 634, and 639. 13Rinehart, "A Document," 278-79; Schaefer, "Studiolo," 253, credits Rinehart with the disco- very of the "small lip on the cornice extending for about ninety inches over two of the upper panels in the center of the Tesoretto [water] wall.... A solution materialized [the studiolo in this location]." Rinehart placed Santi's Creation ofAniber to the right of center in his reconstruction, for which see the diagram in Ettore Allegri and Alessandro Cecchi, Palazzo Vecchio e i Medici: Guida storica (Florence: SPE.S., 1980), 326; as did Schaefer (fig. 5a). For reasons that are not clearly explained, it was shifted to the left of center in the most recent reconstruction by Philippe Morel, "Le Studiolo de Francesco I de' Medici et l'&amp;conomie symbolique du pouvoir au Palazzo Vecchio," in Syinboles de la Renaissance, 3 vols.

In consequence, Spalding reviews the overwhelming presence of nudes in the Scrit- toio's paintings and points especially toVasari's 1570 Creation of Coral as Santi's model. In my view, Santi's tightly knit composition contains very little, if any, extra- neous information. I shall argue that, far from enjoying artistic license of an icon- ographical kind, Santi must have followed Borghini's concetto very closely, as the Creation ofAmber conveys a message that would be incomprehensible without all of its component parts. To maintain this argument, I begin with the all-impor- tant and rather lengthy passage in Ovid's Metamorphoses, Borghini's essential (but by no means sole) source:15 The Heliades, her [Clymene's] daughters,join in her lamentation, and pour out their tears in useless tribute to the dead.With bruising hands beating their naked breasts, they call night and day upon their brother [Phaethon], who nevermore will hear their sad laments, and prostrate themselves upon his sepulchre. Four times had the moon with waxing crescents reached her full orb; but they, as was their habit..., were mourning still. Then one day the eldest Phaethusa, when she would throw herself upon the grave, complained that her feet had grown cold and stark; and when the fair Lampetia tried to come to her, she was held fast as by sudden roots. A third, making to tear her hair, found her hands plucking at foliage. One complained that her ankles were encased in wood, another that her arms were changing to long branches ... bark closes round their loins, ... all that was free were their lips calling upon their mother. ... she tries to tear away the bark from their bodies and breaks off slender twigs with her hands. But as she does this bloody drops trickle forth as from a wound.... "Oh, spare me, mother; spare, I beg you." ... Still their tears flow on, and these tears, hardened into amber by the sun, drop down from the new-made trees.The clear river receives them and bears them onward, one day to be worn by the brides of Rome. Cygnus, the son of Sthenelus, was a witness of this miracle. Though he was kin to you, 0 Phaethon, by his mother's blood, he was more 14See Jack Spalding, "Santi di Tito and the Studiolo of Francesco I," Antichita viva 20, no. 5 (1981):18-20; idem, Saniti di Tito, Outstanding Dissertations in the Fine Arts (NewYork: Garland, 1982), 23-26, 287-90, for this and the following. 15Ovid, Metatnorphoses, vol. 1, trans.

He, abandoning his kingdom for he ruled over the peoples and great cities of Liguria went weeping and lament- ing along the green banks of the Eridanus, and through the woods which the sisters had increased. And as he went his voice became thin and shrill; white plumage hid his hair and his neck stretched far out from his breast. A weblike membrane joined his reddened fingers, wings clothed his sides, and a blunt beak his mouth. So Cygnus became a strange new bird the swan. But he did not trust himself to the upper air and Jove, since he remembered the fiery bolt which the god had unjustly hurled. His favorite haunts were the still pools and spreading lakes; and, hating fire, he chose the water for his home, as the opposite of flame. Ranged across the back of the foreground stage, four of Phaethon's five sisters uncontrollably shed tears for their dead brother, who had driven his father's char- iot of the sun recklessly through the sky, causing Jupiter's thunderbolt of wrath to strike and hurl him to his death in the Eridanus river, and completing Ovid's tril- ogy on the creation of the world.16 Two of the sisters hold hands over their faces in gestures reminiscent of Masaccio's expelled Adam in the Brancacci Chapel, while poplar leaves sprout from their heads; one, with back turned to the spectator and poplar leaves growing from her fingers, holds her arms up towards the clouds, still fiery and "scorched," like the earth and some of its inhabitants, following her brother's fatal escapade;17 another, located to the left of the composition's center, holds her left hand over her face and with her right, already sprouting leaves, touches the poplar branches growing from her head.18 Santi depicts the Heliades beginning their metamorphosis into poplar trees. In a slight departure from the Ovidian source that actually approximates Philostratus the Elder's description of the Heliades' metamorphosis, Santi also shows that the tears streaming from their eyes have already been hardened by the sun into amber.19 In this way, the artist surely satisfied both his patron's love of nudes and Borghini's concetto.20 16The trilogy of the creation, the flood (with Deucalion and Pyrrha-also depicted in the Scrit- toio) and Phaethon's ride are discussed in Leonard Barkan, The Gods Made Flesh: Metamiiorphosis &amp; the Ptursifit of Pagan1ismii (New Haven:Yale University Press, 1986),134. 171 am drawing on passages describing Phaethon's fall in Ovid, Metamiorp hoses, 2:208-9 and 2:235-39: "The moon in amazement sees her brother's [Apollo's] horses running below her own, and the scorched clouds smtioke [emphasis mine]"; and "It tvas then, as men think, that the peoples ofAethiopia became black-skinriied, since the blood was drawn to the surface of their bodies by the heat. Then also Libya became a desert, for the heat dried up her moisture. Then the nymphs with dishevelled hair bewailed their fountains and their pools [emphasis mine]." 18According to Schaefer, "Studiolo," 400, "Santi depicts the four sisters in the process of transfor- mation, their fingers springing into branches." 19Philostratus the Elder, Imnagiines, trans. Arthur Fairbanks, Loeb Classical Library (London: Hei- nemann; NewYork: Putnam's Sons, 1931), 1.11.4. 20Some idea of the rather comical effect resulting from following Ovid may be gleaned on look- ing at Francesco Xanto Avelli's 1532 majolica plate of the Sisters of Phaethoii aned Cygnutts Metamiiorphosing, illustrated in George Szab6, The Robert Lehmiani Collectiont (NewYork: Metropolitan Museum of Art; Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1975), plate 154.</page><page sequence="9">Mandel / Santi di Tito 's "Creation ofAniber" 727 Three scantily clad putti standing in front of the nude Heliades enjoy the bounty: one stoops down to pick up the precious gems; another, with lifted blou- son to carry the amber, looks to a third while possibly catching an amber tear with his upraised right hand; and the third, whom Spalding characterizes as doing a little dance in his fluttering and revealing drapery, extends his right hand towards the swan near the picture plane and points with his left to an aged figure, wearing a wreath and garments of pink, red, and green.21 Variously characterized as a woman (the Heliades' mother, Cyrene) and a man (Cygnus, king of the Ligurians), this figure accompanies a reclining personification of the Eridanus river, holding a cornucopia and pouring water from a vessel.22 The wreathed figure and the Eridanus river exchange profoundly sad glances, presumably for the dead Phaethon. King Cygnus, transformed into his namesake, a swan, stands at the feet of the river, in the lower center of the composition directly below the putto picking up the amber drops and one of the Heliades. Santi organized the centralized vertical axis of his composition to provide the essentials of his slightly achronological continuous narrative: as the Heliades metamorphose into poplar trees, creating precious amber drops, so King Cygnus has been turned into a swan as a gift for his grief over his relative's demise. Santi thus departed once again from the Ovidian chronology to approximate Philostratus's course of events.23 Whereas two-thirds of Santi's composition contains the nude Heliades, semi- nude putti, nude Eridanus river (with a strategically placed vessel), the clothed King Cygnus/Cyrene and the Cygnus-swan, all of whom may be identified from Ovid, the remainder of the composition is populated by conspicuously clothed figures excluded from the poet's descriptive verse as well as a cityscape and land- scape in the background. The figures, identified by Schaefer as "townspeople," are in all manner of dress, from the peasant boys closest to the picture plane to the maidens in jewels and fancy attire towards the back of the foreground stage.24 Significantly, the stances of those figures situated on the same axis as the Heliades and putti actually echo those of their mythological companions. A little boy, wearing a collared and cuffed chemise, lifts his arms like the Heliade with her back towards the viewer.Whereas she is grieving, the little boy is filling a woman's purple skirt, or apron, with drops of amber. This woman wears upper- class garb and has her hair coiffed and adorned with a beaded band that looks 21Spalding, "Santi," 20; and idem, Santi, 24. Curiously, idem, Sawti, 289, states that "King Cygnus is clad in a gray shirt with pinkish lavender sleeves." 22Schaefer, "Studiolo," 400, for Cyrene; and Spalding, "Santi," 19; and idern, Saulti, 287, 289, for Cygnus. 23Philostratus the Elder, Imagiines, 1:11:3-4: "For swans scattered about, breathing sweet notes, will hymn the youth; and flocks of swans rising aloft will sing the story.... And they will have Zephyrus, nimble god of wayside shrines, to accompany their song, for it is said that Zephyrus has made a compact with the swans to join them in the music of the dirge. This agreement is even nowv being carried out, for look! the wind is playing on the swans as on musical instruments. As for the women on the bank, not yet completely transformed into trees, men say that the daughters of Helius on account of their brother's mishap changed their nature and became trees, and that they shed tears." 24Schaefer, "Studiolo," 400.</page><page sequence="10">728 Sixteenth Century Journal XXXI/3 (2000) remarkably like amber.The way in which she lifts her skirt to form a container is reminiscent of both Bartolommeo Ammannati's Flora-Fiorenza of circa 1555, cre- ated for the Fountain ofJuno that was to have adorned the south end of the Sala Grande abutting the Scrittolo, and the figure of Danae in Bartolommeo Trabal- lesi's Rain of Gold of circa 1571, a painting created for the Scrittoio and likely available for Santi's scrutiny by 1572 (figs. 3-4). Santi's woman leans her head towards the group of Heliades, forming a counterpart to the Adamlike Heliade at the far right of the composition. In tandem with the peasant boys stooping down to pick up the amber (like the first putto), she serves to close the circle encom- passing Phaethon's sisters, Eridanus river, and King Cygnus/Cyrene. Whether viewed as a predominantly starlike composition, radiating outwards from the first putto; as a series of opposing diagonals; as a circular or ovoid com- position; or as a combination of all of these, Santi organized his Creation ofAmber so that the spectator could grasp the essentials of the mythological story immedi- ately not just the creation of amber by Phaethon's sisters but also the transfor- mation of King Cygnus. By including "townspeople" excluded from the Metamorphoses, and all other literary renditions of the myth, not to mention the prematurely hardened amber tears and the Flora- and Danaelike woman's amber- laced coiffure, Santi also indicated that his Creation ofAmber was a variation on the Ovidian theme, molded to the Medicean nuances of the Scrittoio's cycle. As fur- ther indication of his departure from the ancient myth, Santi included a portrait of Lucrezia de' Medici, surely following Borghini's counsel and, most likely, Francesco's request. Set apart from the central circle of figures and imbued with an air of serenity quite at odds with the grief-stricken mourners and curious, though still sombre amber pickers, there is a portrait of a woman with finely articulated facial fea- tures and expressive eyes.The features of this woman approximate those of Lucre- zia de' Medici on the many medals cast following her marriage to Alfonso II d'Este, to which I shall return.25 They are roughly comparable to those in the numerous idealized painted portraits of her, such as the Allori school Lucrezia housed at the Uffizi (fig. 5).26 Santi's Creation ofAmber Lucrezia may be conso- nant with the autonomous portrait that he is known to have painted of her, possi- bly around the time he was working in the Scrittoio, but that is no longer extant.27 If so, such circumstances would certainly explain whyVasari chose Santi di Tito to execute the Creation ofAmber for the Scrittoio rather than another of the myriad artists who contributed to the program: Santi knew very well how to portray Lucrezia de' Medici, duchess of Ferrara. 25Karla Langedijk, The Portraits of the Medici, 1Sth-18th Centuries, 3 vols.

The visual evidence indicates that Santi gave Francesco's sister a significant role in the Creation ofAmber. It remains to deter- mine how Borghini might have connected Lucrezia with the mythological cre- ation of amber. To do so, we must return to Lucrezia's life, especially to the events of 1558 to 1561. Duke Cosimo was fond of calling Lucrezia "Obstinate one!" adding that "She is just like us!"30 As a true Medici, Lucrezia had a melancholic disposition. Exacerbated by her mother, who liked to sequester Lucrezia indoors, especially after her marriage to Alfonso II, this characteristic may well have drawn Francesco to his sister, for he was the quintessential melancholic. While her dis- position was typically Medicean, scholars have viewed her intellectual capacities as considerably less so. Simply stated, Lucrezia has been characterized as a dull- ard. Scholars seem to have formed this opinion primarily on the basis of her pen- manship, which was unquestionably poor.31 But that Lucrezia was schooled in Greek and Latin and knew how to play a musical instrument and to sing seem not to have colored scholars' views. Lucrezia's musical aptitude certainly would have agreed with Alfonso II, for the Estense court was celebrated for its love of music.32 Lucrezia also was interested in what nineteenth- and early twentieth- 28The regal nature of purple is well known. Perhaps less so is the fact that ancient Greek brides wore purple, in emulation ofVenus; in John H. Oakley and Rebecca H. Sinos, The Wedding in Ancient Atliens (Madison: University ofWisconsin Press, 1993),15-21. 29The older, bearded companion bears a distinct resemblance to the slightly younger bearded man to the far left of Santi's 1571 Discovery of Ptople, also painted for the Scrittoio (illustrated in Muc- cini, Le Sale, 102). Could this possibly be a self-portrait of the artist? If so, then the unusually promi- nent signature in both paintings could well stand for the artist's remembrance, almost like an inscription on a floor tomb. 30Pieraccini, La Stirpe, 2:93-94: "Sodona!" and "Costei e proprio de' nostri!" Lucrezia's character is also treated in R.J. Berman, Brotwining's Duike (New York: Richards Rosen, 1972), 95-102; and Gabrielle Langdon, "Decorum in Portraits of Medici Women at the Court of Cosimo I, 1537-1574" (Ph.D. diss., University of Michigan, 1992), 341-43, both based on Pieraccini's research. 31Pieraccini, La Stirpe, 2:94, for this and the following.

May one infer that she shared her brother Francesco's fascination with the occult sciences? A one-sided medal of Lucrezia, cast by the Sienese Pastorino de' Pastorini in 1558 and later fitted with a reverse by an anonymous artist, would seem to con- firm such "superstitious" concern.33 The reverse features a female figure with armillary sphere and musical instruments, who clearly personifies astrology and music (or the music of the spheres). The personification signals the very branches of the quadrivium to which Lucrezia was evidently drawn. The inscription accompanying the personification, "NEC TEMPVS NEC AETAS," "Neither the time nor the age," seems to allude to Lucrezia's premature death at the age of sixteen. If so, then the addition of the reverse to Pastorino's medal would have been made following her death in April 1561 to commemorate her brief life and budding intellectual accomplishments. In sum, the blushing bride chosen by Duke Cosimo for the son of his defeated and long-term rival, Duke Ercole, may not have been quite as inept as previous scholarship would have us believe. The unquestionably strapping and cultured Alfonso II d'Este high-hatted it to France some three days after his nuptials. He neither saw nor corresponded very frequently with his wife for the next year and a half. Were it not for news of his father's death on 3 October 1559, the groom might well have stayed in France for a good many more years.34 This news naturally prompted Alfonso to leave the French court. He made his way from Marseilles to Livorno to Florence, at which point he saw his wife briefly before being accompanied by his father-in-law to Garfagnana. Alfonso arrived in Ferrara on 20 November 1559 and was sworn in as the fifth duke of Ferrara on the twenty-sixth.35 Toward the end of January 1560, Duke Alfonso II finally sent his uncle Francesco d'Este, marquess of Massa- lombarda, to fetch Lucrezia from Florence.36 Lucrezia arrived in Emilia-Roma- gna on her fifteenth birthday, 14 February, accompanied by her brother Francesco, her uncle Luigi di Toledo, and a prodigious number in her train. The duchess of Ferrara made her official entrance into the city of Ferrara on 17 Feb- 33Langedijk, Portraits, 2:1202, 76, 7c.

Karla Langedijk argues convincingly that Francesco documented his sister's departure from Florence and official entry into Ferrara by commissioning Alessandro Allori to paint his portrait holding a cameo with Lucrezia's likeness (fig. 6).39 This double portrait evidently was deemed important because two paintings of this type exist, both attributed to Allori himself, one formerly in the collection of Michel van Gelder, Uccle, which sold at Christie's in 1978, and one in the Royal Castle ofWawal in Cracow.40 While Langedijk provides a rationale for the commission in the prestige that the Este brought to the Medici house, and to Cosimo's eldest son Francesco in particular, I would not discount Francesco's filial devotion. Further insight into Lucrezia's life and relations is provided by numismatic evidence. Three versions of medals honoring Lucrezia are extant: Lucrezia is depicted on the obverse with Alfonso II on the reverse, Lucrezia is depicted with- out a reverse, and Lucrezia is depicted with a variety of reverses with impresa. The Florentine Domenico Poggini's medal depicting Lucrezia and Alfonso II may be dated circa 1558 on the basis of the Medici-Este wedding and the inscriptions 37The entrance is documented by Filippo Rodi in Patrizio Antolini, La solenne entrata in Ferrara di Lucrezia Medici venuta sposa al Duca A/fonso d'Este, Nozze Carnevali-Saletti (Argenta: Tipografia Argen- tana, 1894); and Alessandro Sardi, Viaggio efeste eseguite in Ferrara per Lucrezia de' Medici venuta sposa al ducaAfonso II. d'Este...

Before turning to this last variety of medal, it must be said that any impresa given to Lucrezia would have been devised by a humanist at the Medicean or Estense court, more likely at the former. If Lucrezia were a dim-witted duchess, said humanist would have worked rather diligently, wracking his brain to meet the challenge of celebrating such a prize.Yet the fact that Lucrezia was commem- orated with at least seven medallic impresa might suggest that she was quite worthy of adulation, both intellectually and personally, for courtly flattery need not necessarily have yielded so diverse a series of reverses in so brief a period of 41Langedijk, Portraits, 2:1202-4, no. 76, 8, with preVious bibliography: 42Langedijk, Portraits, 2:1202, no. 76. 7, with previous bibliography; L.

Of these, one is particularly evocative with regard to Santi's Creation ofAmber (fig. 8).45 It was cast by an anonymous artist at an unknown date and bears the inscription INoVA.ERIDANo.FVLXIT.LVX," ("New light shone on the Po")i46 All scholars have followed Alfred Armand's 1883 description in identifying this medal's imagery as featuring Apollo-Sol in his quadriga above a reclining Enidanus river embracing a 44I include in this count a medal created by Antonio Selvi by 1739. following Alessandro Segni's 1665-70 research on Grand Duke Cosimo III de' Medici's illustrious ancestors, which features the motto ".mov.ET.LVMINE and a rocky landscape spotted with trees and an anthropomorphic sun with rays emanating from all sides. According to Langedijk. Portraits, 3:1563, and n- 24, this impresa compa- res Lucrezia to the sun, 'spreading light and moving west, that is, towards death." One is left to infer that this unpresa was created not long after Lucrezia's demise, although the only evidence was created more than a century later. Also see Boccolari, Le medaglie, 151. ' Thefour remainnin impresa are as follows:"te dvce pervenivm"' with a rainbow over a boat on the sea, by Domenico Poggini; "ex desiderio amore" with a youth plaving with a blindfolded cupid. also by Poggini;"optima fides" with a young man and woman, dressed all'antica and holding hands, by an anonymous artist; and a now illegible inscription with Salmacis and Hermaphroditus, by Pastorino. Nothing has been written on this latter, save an indication of a photographic source in Langedijk, Por- traits, 2:1202, no. 76, 7b. I suspect that it, too, may figure in Santi's Creation ofAmber, but without the motto I do not wish to hazard a guess. For the former medallic impresa, consult Boccolari, Le medaglie, 161-62. 46I have been unable to ascertain the location of this medaL save that it belongs to the Armand- Valton collection, n. 1019a. Boccolari, Le medaglie, 162, argues that "il rovescio non concorda stlistica- mente col diritto, quindi la leggenda e l'allegoria non hanno alcun riferimento con la Duchessa."' Given that the impresa forms the reverse for the obverse featuring Lucrezia's portrait, surely one may conclude that the two are not as unrelated as Boccolari claims. Further, one must question how Boc- colari can accept the reverse with the motto "nec tempvs nec aetas- as having to do with Lucresa, notwithstanding that it was collocated with other sixteenth-century personages, and not follow suit for this particular reverse, since neither shares stylistic affinities with its obverses.</page><page sequence="20">738 Sixteenth CenturyJournal XXXI/3 (2000) nymph.47 Now, with Santi di Tito's Creation ofAmber in mind, the presence of the Eridanus river ought to give one pause. As I now demonstrate, herein lies a fun- damental connection between the anonymous medal and the message Santi's painting conveys. Following Armand, Langedijk indicates that the anonymous medal is bor- rowed from the first medallic type, specifically from Poggini's medal featuring Lucrezia on the obverse and Alfonso II on the reverse.48 The anonymous artist's depiction of the Medici princess certainly is consonant with that displayed on Poggini's medal: both are in profile, with a bejewelled coiffure and drop earring, and Lucrezia's bust is positioned frontally to show the viewer her lace-collared bodice emphasizing shoulders and breasts and prominent drop necklace. But must such correspondence between obverses necessarily dictate, following received scholarly opinion, that Poggini's Alfonso II becomes the anonymous artist's Apollo in his quadriga? Must one then look to Duke Cosimo I in order to solidify the Apollonian theme?49 Indeed, must the figure with cowled head and tight-fitting bodice, raising what looks like a whip in the right hand over the heads of the gal- loping horses, necessarily be identified as Apollo? Can this figure not be identi- fied as Phaethon? And what of the inscription, which is worded in the past tense? According to Ovid, when Apollo reluctantly gave Phaethon his chariot of the sun, he also anointed his son's face and placed his "radiant crown" on his son's head.50 Hence, the Metamorphoses cannot help to clarify the identity of the anon- ymous medallist's charioteer. Philostratus the Elder is silent on this detail as well, as are all other ancient Greek and Roman commentators. In such circumstance, it is best to begin by addressing the unequivocal internal evidence. First and fore- most, the inscription indicates that the context for the imnpresa is the Eridanus river: "NOVA.ERIDANO.FVLXIT.LVX." (emphasis mine).The reclining male figure, with cornucopia and urn spilling water, conforms to traditional river-god ico- nography and may therefore be identified as the Eridanus river.This personifica- tion also agrees with that depicted in Santi's Creation ofAmber. The Eridanus river had been identified with the Po river since Greek antiquity, and this view is con- veyed in Pliny's Natural History, one of Borghini's favorite sources of inspira- tion.51 Some scholars recognize the Plinian connection to the anonymous 47Alfred Armand, Les Al'Iedailletirs italietis des qifiziemlIe et seizie'me siecles, 3 vols.

Borghini's ownership of this book is discussed</page><page sequence="21">Mandel / Santi di Titos "Creation ofAmber" 739 medal.52 Not unexpectedly, the Ferrarese believed that Phaethon had fallen into the Po river, not in Liguria but closer to home in Emilia-Romagna. According to a certain Eustachio, from whom the story filtered down to Boccaccio and subse- quent humanists, Phakthon, otherwise known as Eridanus, was the son of the Egyptian Sol.53 He had set sail with a number of companions from the Nile and traveled down the Po from Liguria to Emilia-Romagna (according to the Ferra- rese), where he fell overboard and drowned. In a slight turnabout of the usual myth, made to fit Ferrarese "history," the Po river was renamed Eridanus, in memory of the Egyptian Phakthon, and Eridanus's image was translated to the stars. Consequently, men devised the myth in which Jupiter hurls his thunderbolt and Phaethon falls into the river. The humanist who created the inscription for the anonymous medal did not have to strain his imagination too terribly much; he found a ready-made theme to celebrate Lucrezia in Ferrara's "history." The inscription also indicates that there was "new light" on the Eridanus river: NOVA.ERIDANO.FVLXIT.LVX." (emphasis mine). If the figure in the chariot were Apollo, pure and simple, then there would be no reason to specify that the "light" was "new," for Apollo drove his chariot of the sun through the sky on a daily basis. Since this "new light" can hardly be radiating from the reclining nymph in the Eridanus river's arms, then it must be emanating from the figure in the airborne quadriga. Given that Lucrezia is depicted on the obverse, this chari- oteer must stand for the duchess of Ferrara herself. Lucrezia is not just the chario- teer in the anonymous artist's medal: Phakthon is Lucrezia. Following the Ferrarese treatment of the myth and Boccaccio's Lucrezia is not the rash youth careening through the sky on Apollo's chariot, but rather the youth taken up to the stars to become the extrazodiacal constellation Eridanus and, more to the point, the "new light" of the Galaxy or Milky Way.54 In this latter sense, she is wafted on the "Way of Rome" that leads to Ovid's "court of Jove." That the Duchess of Ferrara-cum-Phakthon "shone" ("FVLXIT") on the Eridanus river, finally, indicates that this "new light" was no longer in the terrestrial realm: Lucrezia had passed away. The medal's raison d'etre is therefore in perfect accord and reconfirmed in Testaverde Matteini, "La Biblioteca," 2:620, 630. Richard Anthony Scorza, "Vin- cenzo Borghini (1515-1580) as Iconographic Adviser" (Ph.D. diss., University of London,Warburg Institute, 1987), 174-75, recognizes that Pliny's Natural History was the fundamental, if not sole, source on which Borghini was relying when first composing the Scrittoio's program. 52Langedijk, Portraits, 2:1204, no. 76, 8a; Langdon, "Decorum," 343. 53Boccaccio, Della Genealogia, 127v-28v; Pellegrino Prisciani, "Historiae Ferrariae," fifteenth to sixteenth century, Archivio di Stato di Modena, MS Biblioteca, no. 129, f, 27, states that Phaethon was Eridanus. 54Barkan, Gods Made Flesh, 36, referring to Phaethon's Ovidian epitaph, points out that "What was prideful and destructive in the young man is now seen as glorious. He succeeds in being joined with the heavens and becomes stellified as a mysterious heavenly body that falls but does not fall or dies but does not die." For the traditional comparison between the extrazodiacal constellation Eridanus and the Milky Way, and for the Milky Way's various appellations, see Richard Hinckley Allen, Star Names:Their Lore and Meaning (1899; reprint, NewYork: Dover, 1963), 215-17, and 474-85.</page><page sequence="22">740 Sixteenth Centuiy jottrnal XXXI/3 (2000) with Santi di Tito's Creation ofnAmber: both were created to commemorate the life and death of the duchess of Ferrara. Although documentary evidence is lacking, there is every reason to believe that Borghini had access to this medal when penning the Scrittoio's program and that he showed it to Santi as source material for his painting.55 It is tantalizing to consider that it may well have been in the possession of Francesco himself, possibly tucked away in one of the Scrit- toio's sportelli. Returning to Santi's Creation ofAmiber; one can reasonably state that Lucre- zia's presence signals her tragic death, Phaethonlike, in Ferrara in 1561. Might her red bodice then symbolize her passion, that is to say, her death, and her purple robe, her queenly shroud? The way in which the robe drapes around her head recalls the Ptidicita' pose of ancient Roman funerary sculpture, such as that adopted by the wife commemorated on the Mllerctiry Psychopompos sarcophagus housed in Florence's San Giovanni during the sixteenth century.56 Its purple col- oration reinforces Lucrezia's regal and bridal natures, as both Medici "princess" and Este duchess-bride.The amber strand around Lucrezia's neck connects her to the Heliades, her "sisters" mourning her death. Indeed, as Diodorus of Sicily tells us, "these poplars, at the same season each year, drip tears, and these, when they harden, form ... amber, which ... is coinmonily uased in connection with the mtouirning attending the death of the young [emphasis mine] ."57 Lucrezia's beaded necklace also connects her to Alfonso, particularly on recalling Ovid's characterization of amber in the Metanmorphoses: "Still their tears flow on, and these tears, hardened into amber by the sun, drop down from the new-made trees. The clear river receives them and bears them onward, one day to be worn by the brides of Roume [emphasis mine]."58 In turn, the Heliades' transformation into poplar trees serves in part to situate Santi's narrative on the bank of the Po river because poplars really do grow in Emilia-Romagna. Indeed, Santi's Heliades appear to be turning into white poplars (cf. figs. 2 and 9), and it happens that white poplars are particularly plen- tiful around Ferrara.59 With a specific geographical context thus firmly established, it is possible that the structure on the hilltop directly behind Lucrezia's head represents a Ferrarese locale, at least in part. Such a supposition is especially likely given that Bartolom- meo Traballesi used this Borghinian method in his geographically specific, por- 55Borghini was extremely well versed in the history of medals and their symbolisml-.

As Borghini would have known very well, the poplar tree was sacred to Hercules.66 One learns from Apollodorus that Hercules had ventured to the Eridanus during his eleventh labor, en route to fetching the golden apples from the Hesperides and freeing Prometheus from his mountainous prison.67 Is it merely coincidental that the Eridanus was known to the ancient Greeks not only as the Po, but also as the Phasis, the river that flowed into the Euxine Sea?68 It was here, on the shore of the Euxine, that Jason and the Argonauts retrieved the golden fleece that tradi- 60Corinne Mandel, "Bartolommeo Traballesi's Rain of Gold and the Poetics of Power in France- sco's Scrittoio in the Palazzo della Signoria, Florence," RACAR (Revue d'art canadiennze/Catiadian Art Revietv) 12, nos. 1-2 (1995): 53-79. 61For a description and illustration, consult Werner L.

Such a program might have pleased both Grand Duke Cosimo and the prince regent Francesco, as it would have rein- forced the resolution to the precedence controversy between Ferrara and Flor- ence: when Cosimo became grand duke in 1569, he effectively reaped the reward of his victory over the Este.71 Traballesi had already conflated distinctive geo- graphical locales, and distinctive monuments in his Rain of Gold.72 By melding the Egyptian Hercules' Florence with the Egyptian Eridanus, Borghini compared the foundation of Florence to Phaethon's creation of the earth's topography. Lucrezia was an utterly indispensable part of this complex of ideas because her death on 21 April fell on the anniversary of the foundation of Rome, the sacer- dotal city of Flora.73 Lucrezia's death in terrestrial Ferrara-cum-Florence-Rome was therefore a creative act, like the inherently Egyptian ones visually and meta- phorically celebrated in the Creation ofAmber. Now that Lucrezia's place in Borghini's Ovidian scheme has been eluci- dated, it remains to determine why Santi painted four Heliades rather than Ovid's five, and to come to terms with the seemingly androgynous figure that scholars have identified as both King Cygnus and Cyrene. Nor can Santi be credited with the omission, or with the hermaphroditic look of the figure at the composition's far right: in a letter written toVasari in 1572, Borghini complains rather bitterly about the poor coloration and lack of relief in Santi's Creation ofnAmber, but he does not request substantive changes.74 Presumably, "santiditato" followed Borghini's concetto, though not to the prior's aesthetic preference.When one con- siders anew that Lucrezia's presence in the Creation ofAmber commemorates her 69For the palle, golden fleece, and golden apples, see Cox-Rearick, Dynasty, 79 (for palle-apples), and 279-80, and 287 (for palle and golden fleece). 70For the Egyptian (or Libyan) Hercules as Florence's founder, see Vincenzio Borghini, Discorsi ...

Perhaps this missing "sister" was accustomed to sitting beneath Santi's painting, at his studiolo. In other words, if Lucrezia could be transformed into an alter Phaethon, following the anonymous medalist andVincenzio Borghini, then could Francesco not have played the role of Lucrezia-Phaethon's missing sister? Seated at his studiolo Francesco could have beheld his precious amber and, Heliadelike, remembered his youth, the impor- tant Medici-Este union, and his love for his sister Lucrezia.75 In picking up his amber treasures, Francesco would have related to the myth- ological putti and Ferrarese townspeople who pick up theirs in Santi's painting, like variations on a visual theme. But the action of stooping down was really more suited to retrieving precious objects housed in the sportelli behind the Scrittoio's oval paintings; seated at his studiolo, Francesco would have reached upwards, in the manner of the clothed young boy reaching up to place his amber in the purple apron of the Flora- and Danadlike woman already wearing the pre- cious "tears" in her hair, as Lucrezia already wears them around her neck (cf. fig- ures 2-4). In Traballesi's painting, Dana6 receives Jupiter-Cosimo's golden semen from her tower in the Palazzo della Signoria-cum-Bargello as Ammannati's Flora- Fiorenza holds flowers, as if to insinuate that the Perseus to whom she will give birth is Francesco himself, future Grand Duke of Tuscany.76 That Francesco was born on both the anniversary of the foundation of Florence and the Feast of the Annunciation points to a Christian reading ofTraballesi's painting that is wholly consonant with traditional Christian comparisons of Dana6's impregnation by the "shower of gold" and the Virgin Mary's impregnation by the "fiery" Holy Spirit.77 Since Santi's painting was created for the same space as Traballesi's Rain of Gold indeed, since all paintings with secular and mythological subjects created for the Scrittoio were accompanied by Moses and the Red Sea, a painting with a biblical subject then the obvious conclusion is that Borghini, the Benedictine prior, created an outwardly secular, primarily pagan program to convey a Chris- tian message. The exception to the rule, the painting of Moses and the Red Sea, dictates that all other components mutate to conform to this exception. 75Schaefer, "Studiolo," 245-46, was particularly perceptive on the issue of Francesco's interaction with the work of art: "As it is today, the Studiolo ... is incomplete. One important element is missing. For the room to be iconographically complete and totally comprehensible Francesco's presence is required. Without him the iconography comes to nought. Man-a Medici-Francesco was the ultimate creation of Man (Art) and Nature." 76For a more detailed explanation, see Mandel, "Traballesi's Rain of Gold," 57, for this and the following, unless otherwise noted. 77For Christian exegeses on Dana6 and the Virgin Mary, see Salvatore Settis, "DanaeVerso il 1495," ITatti Studies: Essays in the Renaissance 1 (1985): 207-37, esp. 209-12.

As such, the boy reaching up to place the amber in her apron could be understood as Lucrezia's unborn and sorely mourned Medici-Este heir, the counterpart to the Perseus- and Christlike Medici heir reaching up at day's end to put his amber back into the studiolo. In this way, Santi's amber "tears" and Francesco's amber treasures would have commemorated the tragic deaths of the youthful Lucrezia and her unborn child, and their recep- tion in heaven on the anniversary of both the foundation of Florence-Rome and Phaethon's creation of the world. In keeping with Borghini's Benedictine training and outlook, Lucrezia emerges as a funereal, Ptidicitallike "bride of Rome," dressed in the purple of a martyr with a bright red bodice that points to her passion, at once what the prior termed her nuptial "sacrifice" and her death.79 Lucrezia joins a long line of Med- icean "martyrs," traceable at least as far back as Giovanni di Bicci and his wife Piccarda Bueri, and reveals her intellectual self as the "star" in the Eridanus-cum- Milky Way, in accord with the prophecy of Dan. 12:3: "they that are learned shall shine as the brightness of the firmament: and they that instruct many to justice, as stars for all eternity."80 The amber beads that she wears to signify her earthly mar- riage and demise now celebrate her heavenly nuptials.With the Herculean con- nection in mind, these amber drops transform from the forbidden fruit of the Garden of Eden to the fruit of humanity's redemption.81 After all, the ancient Romans called amber both chryselectrum and chryselectroe, words that have the 78Philostratus the Elder, Irtiagirtes, 1:2.1, states "Golden are the tears of the daughters of Helius [Apollo]." 79For the purple robes of martyrs, seeYvette Duval, Loca Saiictorumrii Africae: Le Culte des Martyrs eri Afriquie dii IVe att VIIe Siecle, Collection de L'Ecole Franpaise de Rome, 58, 2 vols.

Santi seems to have given two of his Heliades the telling gesture of Masaccio's expelled and shamed Adam to point to this dialectical interpretation of their "fruitful" tears, in malo and in bono, so that the well-dressed woman with amber-adorned hair, holding up her purple womblike skirt and closing the circle of the Heliades, naturally stands for Eve's opposite: Ave, the Virgin Mary. This personified Florence metamorphoses into the eschatological "bride of Rome," Florence's Santa Maria del Fiore, and the amber drops transform into the son of Apocalypse, like the "rain of gold" of his first manifestation on earth.83 We watch as they are wafted through the terres- trial-cum-stellar Eridanus and taken up to the Heavenly Jerusalem-cum-Heav- enly Florence-Rome for their final nuptial union. In the Fasti, Ovid addressed the origin of the rites connected to Rome's foundation on 21 April, and hence to the god, or goddess, Pales (the ancients' jury was unable to reconvene on the issue of the deity's sex):84 "Some suppose (though I can hardly do so) that the allusion is to Phaethon and Deucalion's flood."85 Fire and water were vital components of the Phaethon creation myth, the ancient nuptial rite, and the Palilia, otherwise understood as the foundation of Rome.86 Ovid further remarked on the traditional offerings of "snow-white milk and purple must" to Pales at this time, and on the importance of "the moist laurel-bough" in the sacerdotal rite.87 According to the internal evidence of Santi's Creation ofAmber, the fire and water of Phafthon's demise are intimately bound to Lucrezia, the Medicean martyr whose dies natalis fell on the Palilia.The internal evidence also furnishes a visual correlation between Lucrezia and the 82Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 37.12.51 and 43.127.

In addition, it was not unusual for artists to depict the Christ child with flowers, so that the analogy I have drawn between the "golden" amber, "rain of gold," and flowers of Santa Maria del Fiore has a precedent.

Whether one accepts these latter identifications or not, one cannot question that the Eridanus, lounging in his terrestrial form towards the right of the composi- tion, also signifies the celestial Milky Way, as embodied by Lucrezia located diag- onally across from him. Nor can one question that both female protagonists excluded from the ancient myth are garbed in regal, nuptial, and funereal purple robes that evoke the "purple must," like "sanguine" wine as the Eridanus-Milky Way embodies the "snow-white milk" offered to Pales. Add to this the fact that Santi's Creation ofAniber adorns the center of the Scrittoio's southern, water wall as Andrea del Minga's Deucalion and Pyrrha is centered on the eastern, earth wall, and it hardly seems possible that Borghini did not have the "allusion... to Pha6- thon and Deucalion's flood" in mind. While the androgynous figure looking mournfully at the Eridanus likely sig- nals both King Cygnus and the Heliades' mother, Cyrene, the evidence suggests that this figure ought also to evoke Pales, the deity who some ancients believed was female, and others, male. As the creation of amber involves metamorphoses, so Borghini's complex iconography must mutate in order that the Christian meaning may surface and ultimately subsume the pagan context in which it is presented. Perhaps Borghini was displeased with the relief and coloration in Santi's painting because it did not facilitate the iconographical metamorphoses as readily as some of the companion pieces already created for the Scrittoio; it did not demonstrate tit pictilra poesis to the prior's satisfaction. In the event, this unusual figure is crowned with a conspicuous wreath that is not made of poplar leaves, as one might expect. Instead, it is made of laurel, the tree as sacred to Pales as to Phaethon's father Apollo (cf. figs. 2 and 11). Since Virgil spoke of Pales as both Apollo and his sister Diana, the deity for whom fire and water were so vital was as "fiery" as Apollo-Sol and as "watery" as Diana-Luna.88 Because the sun and moon were in conjunction at Rome's foundation and because Lucrezia died on the anniversary of this hallowed event, Santi may well have devised the diago- nal that runs from this androgynous figure through the veil of the putto and the uplifted arm of the Heliade to Lucrezia with this meaning in mind.89 At the same time, he used this putto with flowing veil to point to this androgyne with one hand and to the swan at the center of the foreground stage with the other. In one sense, this veil signals the Philostratan "wind" that "play[ed] on the swans as on musical instruments," an appropriate conceit considering both Lucrezia and the Ferrarese context. In another sense, it evokes t he goddess Fortuna. As the Cygnus-swan sings the swan song for the deceased Medici bride, while prophesy- ing her heavenly nuptials and indeed the nuptials of all righteous Christians, like the now Medicean subjects at the left side of the painting so Cygnus-Cyrene- 88See the discussion in Corinne Mandel, "Felix Cul/pa and Felix Ronia: On the Program of the Sixtine Staircase at theVatican,"Art Builletin 75, no. 1 (1993): 82-83. 890r, in an even more likely scenario,Vasari and/or Borghini may simply have asked Santi to col- locate this figure with the putto and Lucrezia, without explaining the rationale.</page><page sequence="31">Mandel / Santi di Tito's "Creationi of Atiber" 749 LA VR 0.

Early Christians transformed the ancient Roman rites honoring Pales on 21 April into sacrifices carried out for St. George on 23 April: in each case, and to this day, celebrants leap over burning bonfires and fumigate the flocks of sheep with sulphur, to vouchsafe the shepherds as much as the sheep.90 Although Santi's hermaphrodite hardly resembles, much less outwardly alludes to St. George, it is still pertinent to note that the patron saint of Ferrara is none other than this val- iant deliverer of the princess-bride Cleodolinda.The myth of Phaethon, already compared to the creation of the world and the foundation of Rome by Ovid, and to Lucrezia by the anonymous medalist, therefore furnished Borghini with a ready-made parallel to Ferrara's Christian history.91 Yet, as I have argued in the foregoing, Borghini did not create his complex iconographical scheme to cele- brate Ferrara and the Ferrarese. On the contrary, he subsumed the Estense context to honor both his Medicean patron and the city of Florence that Francesco ruled jointly with his father, the grand duke. To do so, he drew on the correspondences between the ancient myths and the Christian tradition, and provided signposts to lead the Medicean viewers of Santi's painting in the final, eschatological direction. Whereas the ancient festival honoring Pales came to honor St. George, it seems that Early Christians did not supplant the ancients' celebration of Rome's sacerdotal foundation at the Floralia, which began on 27 April and lasted until 1 May. Instead, they perpetuated the festival of May Day, with its attendant torch lights (like the "scorched" sky in Santi's Creation of Aniber), Maypole (like the Heliades) and celebrants decked out in colorful dress (like the "townspeople").92 They also viewed this celebration of Flora as the first in a long line of festivities leading up to the most important day of this part of the year: Midsummer's Day. For the ancient Romans, this day marking the sun's highest ascent in the sky was devoted to Fors Fortuna, the goddess of good fortune, whom Santi's "fortunate" putto evokes.93 But, for the Early Christians and continuing to this day, the "summer solstice" on 24 June marks the Feast of the Nativity of St. John the 90Frazer, "Appendix" in Ovid, Fasti, 411-17; Scullard, Festivals, 103-5. 91The face of Santi's hermaphrodite bears a resemblance to portraits of Alfonso I (Dosso Dossi's in Modena and Rubens's [?] after Titian in NewYork), from the sweep of hair on the forehead to the weary eyes and aquiline nose with the distinctive mark above the left nostril. IfAlfonso II resembled his father, Ercole, as he resembles his grandfather Alfonso I, then Borghini could have been indulging in more double entendre, comparing the Eridanus's "Herculean" site to its "Herculean" ruler, Duke Ercole II. Ercole was Lucrezia's father-in-law, as Apollo was Phaethon's father. Ercole-Cygnus's death in 1559, two years before Lucrezia-Phaethon's, provides a rationale for his early metamorphosis vis-a- vis the Heliades: in this sense, Cygnus-Ercole sings the swan song for the Medici bride and lost Este- Medici heir that his contract with Cosimo almost produced. Santi's androgyne also wears pink, red, and green, like Ercole's livery colors of white, red, and green, for which see Gundersheirner, Ferrara, 251. 92Scullard, Festivals, 110-11; Richard Folkard, Plant Lore, Legends, and Lyrics: Emnbracing the Myths, Traditions, Suiperstitions, and Folk-lore of the Plant Kingdomn, 2d ed (London: Sampson, Low, Marston, 1892), 28-32, for this and the following. 93Scullard, Festivals, 155-56.</page><page sequence="33">Mandel / Santi di Tito's "Creation ofAtnber" 751 Baptist, the patron saint of Florence and the Florentines.94 It marks the birth of the last prophet of the Old Dispensation, as the winter solstice marks Christ's nativity.95 Like their ancient Roman precursors, Borghini and his fellow Floren- tines turned the wheel of fortune on the Feast of St.John the Baptist;96 they jumped over bonfires that were lit in remembrance of the Palilia;97 they picked flowers, filled and emptied vases of grain, and danced around poplar trees to augur happy marriages and fertile, new crops.98 Some even paraded outside in the buff, like Santi's "fortunate" putto, to remember the Baptist's "origins" in the Greek Lampsacus, onVenus's island of Cyprus, and his etymnologically related Lux, his Latin "light."99 Above all, Borghini and his fellow Florentine celebrants remembered that St. John baptized Christ in the Jordan river, as all members of the Medicean respublica died to be reborn in Christ in the baptismal water at San Giovanni. As Francesco "heard" the dirge of Santi's Creation of Arber, he ought to have recognized that the swan was no longer the metamorphosed Cygnus, still grieving over Phaethon's earthly demise. Rather the swan had transmuted one last time into the prophetic songstress of his eschatological future: theVenusian, and hence Floralian talisman of his own mystical nuptials, like his sister Lucrezia's, and indeed like those of his Florentine flock.100 Lina Bolzoni argues persuasively that the Scrittoio functioned as an art of memory.101 To find the precious objects stored in the sportelli and studiolo, 94The Florentines began the festivities honoring the Baptist three or four days prior, acknowled- ging the summer solstice in the process.

Needless to say, the Feast of St. John the Baptist is a "popular" festival, and this, too, helps to account for the "townspeople" in Santi's painting. 99Lanternari, "La politica," 66, explains that "'Lamnpas' era designazione del 'solstizio,"' and on 80, that "la personalita di Giovanni era ... congiunta col nomne Larnpas, essendo egli nativo appunto di Lampas, localita dell'isola di Cipro," and that "le fiaccole portate ... designato egli stesso in greco 'Lam- pas' e in latino 'Lux."' To this I should add that these "fiaccole" are Latin latipadis, in one sense "wed- ding-torches." 100Venus's cart is pulled by swans, e.g., in Agostino di Duccio's relief of ca. 1454 in the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini, and in- Francesco Cossa's 1469-70 Motith ofApril in the Ferrarese Palazzo Schi- fanoia, illustrated and discussed in Gwendolyn Trottein, Les Etifanits de VHins:Art et astrologie a la Renlais- sawce (Paris: Lagune, 1993), 94 and 124-36, esp. 130-31.

But, as I have tried to demonstrate, Santi's painting was much more than a simple trigger to Francesco's memory as to where he had put a particular object. It reminded him of Lucrezia, the "light" of his early life; of her marriage and tragic death in Ferrara; and of her lost child. As Francesco beheld Santi's painting with his amber treasures in hand, he might even have remembered Lucrezia's melodious song and the anonymous artist's reverse "NEC TEMPVS NEC AETAS," now echoed by wind "playing" on Venus's swan.102 In concert with the portraits of Cosimo and Ele- onora on the eastern and western walls, Lucrezia formed the center of a triad that simultaneously commemorated the lives of Francesco's parents and sister and their mystical nuptials in heaven. On those occasions in which Francesco chose to open the Scrittoio's sole window, located to the right of center on the northern wall,103 he would have seen the sunlight, once carried by Pha6thon-Lucrezia, stream onto Santi's andVincenzio Borghini's eloquent portrait of his sister's everlasting life; he would have seen the Lux of Fiorenza's patron and protector saint, auguring the voyage of the righteous through the "Way of Rome" to join Christ, the Madonna and the Communion of Saints for life everlasting in the Heavenly Jerusalem-Florence-Rome, at Ovid's "court ofJove." 102Francesco might have imagined his mistress and, later, wife, Bianca Cappello, joining in to sing the dirge, as one of her personal symbols was the swan. On occasion she may well have been pre- sent in the Scrittoio with Francesco. 103Schaefer, "Studiolo," 254, recognized that "The window ... is directly across from the desk and would have provided a necessary and directional light for Francesco to examine his possessions." In fact, it is in the same location as Santi's Creation ofAmiber, but on the northern wall. As a result, when opened, the light shines directly onto Santi's painting.</page></plain_text>
