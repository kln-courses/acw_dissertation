<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XXIV, No. 22. OCTOBER 27, 1927 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY WHOLES AND PREHENSIVE UNITIES FOR PHYSICS AND PHILOSOPEY THE world obviously breaks up into unities like the "wholes" 1-of General Smuts' Holism. This must have been obvious to many people before the days of General Smuts. It must have been obvious to that early man who first isolated a reindeer from the rest of the landscape and sketched his outlines upon some object. The obviousness of Holism has been obscured in modern times by dogmatism and propaganda. Homer confines the Iliad to the wrath of Achilles strictly. We do not meet such unified wholes in the current literary masterpieces. The things which are obvious are not always significant for sci- entific and philosophical purposes, i.e., for knowledge and for reason. It is to General Smuts' credit that he saw the significance of Holism. But even its significance also has long been appreciated and by many people. The writer was impressed with it many years ago in a conversation with Professor W. S. Franklin.1 From that time on he began his instruction in physics by calling attention to some of the most obvious wholes in everyday experience. From this point of departure the way was easy to the wholes of physicists, pendu- lums, clocks, electric circuits, solar systems, and atoms. In physies the significance of wholes has been obscured by the determination to put across some piece of dogmatism, like the mechanistic view of the whole physical world, substituting "the whole" for wholes. We will examine one of these wholes of physics. We will study its processes of development under the influences reaching it from another whole, viz., the human organism. We will consider this a case of prehension of one whole by another and see what meaning we can read into Whitehead's "unities of prehension." The activi- ties of prehension will consist of manipulations of the circuit by the human organism and certain representations by symbols, i.e., lan- guage. Let us begin by examining a whole in the science of physics. We will take the electric circuit. We will take that circuit as some- thing provisionally complete, up-to-date, as the physicists and the 1 The writer traces the physics ideas which are fundamental to this paper to the influence of the work of T. Willard Gibbs in thermodynamics. 589</page><page sequence="2">590 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY electricians of the past have given it to us. We will give no atten- tion just now to the genesis of this whole. For the whole as it now stands has a life activity of its own more significant for interpreta- tion of future scientific possibilities than would be the circuit as it existed for Faraday. This circuit analyzes through manipulations of the human organism into many measurables, such as current, voltage, resistance, electric field, magnetic field, temperature, heat quantity, permeability, dielectric constants, electrolytic values, power, energy, etc. These measurables each form a class of par- ticular measured values; in other words, they become universals, or, to use Whitehead's language, "eternal objects." These uni- versals or eternal objects have "ingression" into any particular circuit in many "modes," cooperating to produce a whole. The whole in this case owes its unity to the fact that every element in it cooperates to make the circuit serve some definite purpose, such as conveying energy of some description suitable for specialized human use from one place to another. In order to understand this "whole" let us see how it behaves-how does this whole, considered as a generalized circuit, holding in its "field" possible particular actual circuits, behave for a human organism looking for its most obvious characteristics? Now, we are going to watch the behavior of a whole undergoing influences reaching it through the "fields" of other wholes. It seems that wholes actively change only through such transmitted influences. In this case the "influences" come through the fields common to the electric circuit, and some human organisms. The term "field" here is used much as Smuts uses it. Every whole has its field. The whole is an atomic complex of ac- tivities. It is atomic in that it is relatively isolated from other complexes. It is, however, loosely related to other complexes. The logical "region" of these loose relations is the field. Many wholes must have their fields largely in common. No doubt this field is rather a loosely defined term. But it is sufficiently definite for the empirical method we are using. If one were playing with an up-to-date electric circuit with up- to-date apparatus the characteristic that would be at once most ob- vious and striking would be such as would appear as a consequence of the following manipulations. While the circuit is maintained in a constant condition, an electric lamp is moved from one position in the circuit to a number of other positions. The circuit is main- tained in a constant condition by adjusting a rheostat in such a way that some kind of instrument, any kind having any responsive- ness to electrical states, placed in a fixed position, always shows the same reading. This reading does not have to be interpreted or in any way evaluated. All that is necessary is that the reading</page><page sequence="3">WHOLES AND PREHENSIVE UNITIES 591 be ever the same. Now, of course, we are making an assumption, but one that must always be made as a postulate, necessary to make possible any kInd of scientific experiment. The assumption is that the electric circuit is such a "whole" that if any change takes place in it, all the related phenomena constituting it will vary to- gether, one as a function of every other. So we assume that if a "whole" changed its identical condition during our experiment, the reading of our constant instrument would change as a function of the other changes. This assumption is necessary to the idea of cause and effect. We actually find that we can vary one factor in a whole without varying other factors except, say, one. This last one is then found to have some invariable relation to the first one that is varied, which may turn out to be the relation of cause and effect, or it may be merely a relation of "universal association." But such a relation can be established only on condition that all the other factors of a given whole, aside from the two variables, may be kept unchanged. Now keeping our constant instrument reading at its constant value, we move the lamp from one position in the circuit to another. The chances are that this change in the circuit will cause no change in the reading of our constant instru- ment. On repeated trials of changing the position of the lamp one may satisfy himself that the change in the position of the lamp is a variation that is in no way coordinated with the reading of the constant instrument. The only reason for keeping the constant in- strument at a constant reading is to guard against possible acci- dental changes in the circuit such as are due to running down of battery, and so forth. But this circuit may contain a variety of other instruments. No one of these instruments will vary their readings because of a shifting of the position of the lamp. There may be a flatiron delivering heat under conditions that the rate of rise in a thermometer may be noted. That is to say, we can satisfy ourselves that this flatiron will raise a mass of water filling a certain vessel up to a certain mark, from one certain mark to a certain other fixed mark on a thermometer during the time that the sand is running out of an hour glass, every time the lamp is shifted in its position. In this way we may know that the circuit maintains its identical condition, no matter how the lamp is shifted. We will work in such a way as not to assume that we can as yet measure heat quantity or temperature. There may be an electromagnet that exerts the same identical pull on a piece of iron without any measure- ment of the pull. We may have an electrolytic apparatus that de- livers hydrogen from one marked point on a glass tube to another during every period of time marked by the running of all the sand out of an hour glass. There is then every probability that</page><page sequence="4">592 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the circuit is in a constant condition. If these constant phenomena all decrease we are easily convinced that this is only an inevitable consequence of the running down of the battery, which may be com- pensated for by means of the variable rheostat, when all these other effects are at once brought back to their constant value, (unmeas- ured). It will be found that under this constant condition of the circuit, the lamp that is moved from position to position in the circuit always glows in each position with the same identical bright- ness. This brightness can be compared by throwing its light upon a screen where it can be recognized as identical in brightness with another lamp that is not moved. No matter where in the circuit the lamp is placed, it will glow with the same brightness. The same sort of thing will be found true of any other apparatus in the circuit when it is moved from one position to any other. If the wire of the circuit at any place be formed into a coil of a definite number of turns and having a definite average diameter and if the center of this coil be brought to a certain point at the end of a line drawn from the center of a suspended magnet at right angles to the magnetic meridian and perpendicular to the plane of the coil, the magnetic needle will turn so that the end of a pointer at- tached to it will settle at the same identical spot, no matter what portion of the electric circuit is formed into this coil, always of the same dimensions and in the same position relative to the swinging magnet. It makes no difference what is the size and quality of the wire in different parts of the circuit. In the same way the electric flatiron, or any other form of calorimeter, may be moved to any part of the circuit and the water filling a vessel to a certain constant mark will always be heated sufficiently to cause a rise of mercury in a thermometer placed in the water from a certain constant mark A to another constant mark B, while all the sand is running from one compartment of an hour glass to the other. It will be noted that we are making no measurements in any case. We are preparing to define a measurable and to carry out a measurement. But we are going to measure that one measurable independently of the measure- ment of any other measurable, even of a length or a period of time. And yet the one measurable that we are preparing to measure is capable of measurement because of its functional relation to many other measurables. An electrolytic apparatus moved from position to position in different parts of the circuit will show the collection of hydrogen from some one definite mark A to another definite mark B, while all the sand is running out from one compartment of an hour glass into another. We are not measuring volume, nor are we measuring time.</page><page sequence="5">WHOLES AND PREHENSIVE UNITIES 593 From these observations it becomes obvious that there is activity in this electric circuit that is everywhere the same in every part of it. We are going to see whether we can make a measurable of it, or, to use the language we have adopted, whether the "whole," electrical circuit, analyzes into a measurable, among others, which turns out to be just this activity that is constant throughout the cir- cuit, while the circuit is maintained in a constant state from moment to moment while the experiment is in progress. The whole is going to become all this for another whole, the experimenting human organ- ism, which is the center from which the movements involved in the analysis of the whole, the electric circuit, emanate. We will call this measurable that we are trying to define, X, provisionally. X is the "activity" which is everywhere the same in the circuit. Can we make a measurable of it? To do so we must be able to split it up into parts or units. The most available method of doing this would be to split the circuit into branches. If we now could be assured that the X is the same in each branch, then we may say that the X's in the several branches all add and the X of the main line is the sum of these partial X's. That is to say, X equals X1 plus X2 plus X,, plus X4 . . Xn. Then the values of X in the circuit will be numerically equal to the number of unit branches. In saying that the branch values of X add, we are making no as- sumption. We will make this additive property a part of the def- inition of X. X is that activity in the circuit that is everywhere the same along the circuit and which adds across the circuit, when it is branched. There may be no such thing as the activity so defined. But whether there actually be such an activity it is the activity we are talking about and it is the activity we are going to measure. If it be not a reality, then the outcome of our meas- uring of it will tell us so. If an attempt to measure this X accord- ing to the definition given above fulffils the purpose for which a whole analyzes into measurables, then this measurable becomes a reality. A whole analyzes into measurables in order to clarify itself and fa- cilitate its own development. If by measuring this X the electric circuit can develop into something better adapted to the ues that an electric circuit serves, then is this measurable a reality? This measurable then may take on all kinds of values in different electric circuits. This measurable becomes a class concept, in terms of the traditional nomenclature, or, in still more ancient terms, it becomes a universal, or in Whitehead's terminology an "eternal object." The reality of the universals that emerge from a whole comes, in view of what we have seen, from the universal's fulfilling the purpose that gives the whole its unity, its wholeness. The universal forever remains imbedded in the actual particular forms of the whole. But</page><page sequence="6">594 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY each universal, each measurable, has an independence of all other measurables that are embedded with it, and a certain kind of in- dependence of the actual whole from which it is derived and from which it can not wholly escape. Yet this universal is functionally related to all the other measurables or universals with which it is associated. This measurable has its independence and at the same time its correlations and functional dependence on all other measur- ables. These are not a priori assumptions. They are empirical ob- servations of the actual character of these measurables, as this dis- cussion shows and as it will go on to show. We are now going on to measure this X in accordance with the above definition of it and then to define and measure the other measurables associated with it. In every case we shall measure the one given measurable independently of the neasurement of all other measurables, but we shall not measure the given measurable inde- pendently of those other measurables in a qualitative sense. Then, after all this is done, the functional relations of these measurables will be obvious. The statement of these functional relations will be the laws of the electric circuit. The values of the measurables are first determined independently of one another, and then their relations come out. In this way we get independent activities be- tween which relations are found to subsist. Without this independ- ence that whole scheme of relations would collapse. We will now proceed with a description of the operation of measuring X in accordance with its definition as given above as that activity in a circuit that is everywhere the same as we move along the circuit, and which adds up across the circuit when the latter is branching. We will first find our unit of X in the following way. Some type of electric instrument will be selected for this purpose. An electrolytic instrument, a calorimeter, or any other type could be selected, but an electromagnetic type either with a fixed magnet or an electrodynometer type will be the more convenient. A num- ber of instruments of this type will be placed in series one with another and also in series with other types of instruments. The adjustable rheostats will be adjusted until the instruments in- dicate something which we are going to take as our unit of X. This may be the electrolytic deposition of silver to any amount requiring some constant counterbalance. Only there must be no quantitative weighing. All our measurables are going to have quantitative in- dependence of one another. After we have made this adjustment we will note the reading of each electromagnetic instrument. From our definition of X it is obvious that each instrument indicates the same value of X. We will mark the point at which the end of the</page><page sequence="7">WHOLES AND PREHENSIVE UNITIES 595 pointer on each instrument stands as A. Whenever the pointer on that instrument stands at A we shall say that it indicates unit value of X in the circuit in which the instrument is connected. We will now split the circuit between some two points into n branches. In each one of these branches we will place one of the electromagnetic instruments that has been marked for unit current. We will adjust the rheostat in each branch until the pointer of the instrument in that branch stands at A. Then we know there will be unit value of X in each branch. In accordance with our defi- nition of X we now must say that there are n units of X in the main circuit into which these branches feed. We therefore mark the point where the end of the pointer of the electromagnetic instrument in the main circuit stands as A., where A. may indicate 2, 3, 4, 5, or any integral number of units, according to the number of branches used. In this way each one of our instruments may be calibrated for the measuring of X in any circuit. Now it is obvious that the thing we have been calling X is what is customarily called "current." We shall, therefore, cease calling it X and call it "current." But we will keep the quotation marks on the word, for we have not as yet the slightest evidence that it is anything flowing in the wires. We will call the unit of current that we have arbitrarily chosen an ampere. Now comes the first test of the reality of this measurable. Many experiments must be car- ried out before its full reality as a universal is assured, before it is shown to fulfill the purpose for which the whole has analyzed into this and other measurables, universals. The ammeters already calibrated are now used in other circuits. In a new circuit having n branches of all possible characters, containing coils with iron cores and plain resistance and variety of electrical appliances, instru- ments calibrated by the method above outlined are placed. Rheo- stats are adjusted until the pointer in each stands at A. We have unit "current" in each branch. An instrument placed in the main circuit should now read A.. In many cases it will read exactly that, but in equally many cases it will not do anything of the kind. In some cases the branch "currents" add to make the main current. Then on investigation we shall find that our current adds in the case of what are called direct current circuits and often do not add in case of alternating current circuits, when certain coils and con- densers are in the branches. But if we are true to the tradition of all scientific work we do not forsake our definition on this account. We are engaged in the project of finding a definition for a meas- urable that will turn out to have reality according to the criterion for reality stated above. It may be that the whole known as electric circuit has been analyzed correctly. Wholes undoubtedly act on the</page><page sequence="8">596 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY principle of trial and error. Perhaps our definition only needs a little generalizing. This is the method by which many a scientific theory is saved. And in this case, to make a very long story short, it will be found that branch alternating current circuits add, pro- vided we add them, not arithmetically, but geometrically. And the whole unfolds very naturally into a process for the geometrical ad- dition of branching alternating current circuits. We can now re- interpret our original definition of the current as that activity which is everywhere the same along the circuit and which adds (in a geometrical sense) across the circuit, when the latter is branched. Our definition is saved by reinterpreting one word in it. The defi- nition now holds for all kinds of circuits. Many other apparent difficulties will be encountered for our definition as experience with electric circuits increases. But every difficulty will be overcome and the definition will stand. In wireless circuits, for example, it will seem as though the current is not the same everywhere along the circuit as measured by instruments calibrated in other circuits. But in this case it will be found that the real circuit has not been correctly located. This method of measuring gives only integral values of the meas- urable. But any fractional value may be found by starting with smaller arbitrary units of current and later identifying summations of these smaller integral units with the larger ones formerly used. This will involve something of a trial and error method. This dif- ficulty ceases to have any significance as soon as the functional relations between measurables have been established. Now there are many other measurables that are functionally cor- related with current in an electric circuit. Some of these are volt- age, energy, power, heat quantity, temperature, electrolytic meas- urables, time and distance measurements. Now each one of these measurables may be measured, not independently of the other meas- urables in a qualitative sense, but each of them may be measured independently of all the other measurables in a quantitative sense. Any one of them may be measured independently of the measurement of all the other measurables. To show this in detail would require a separate treatment for each measurable, as detailed as the one already given for current. The writer trusts that such a detailed statement for each one is not called for. As soon as these separate measurables are defined and measured, certain fundamental relations will appear among them. For ex- ample, such a relationship as this will appear, E equals VIt, where E represents the value of energy given out or absorbed by a certain part of the circuit, V, the voltage of that section of the circuit, 1, the current, and t, the time required for the absorption or emis-</page><page sequence="9">WHOLES AND PREHENSIVE UNITIES 597 sion of the energy E. This relationship of measurables may be sym- bolized as R(A, B, C), where A, B, C, are the measurables, the fact of whose correlation is symbolized by R. We may put all this into the terminology of Whitehead. Each measurable of the electric circuit may be expressed in terms of the others. If this were all there were to say about the matter one would have to know all about all the measurables of an electric circuit before we could know anything about any one of them. It would be the old difficulty that the realists have laid at the door of absolute idealism, the matter of being obliged to know every- thing before we can know anything. Whitehead introduces his discussion of this matter in his chapter, "Abstraction" in Science and the Modern World, page 228, as follows: "The difficulty which arises in respect to internal relations is to explain how any particular truth is possible. In so far as there are internal relations, everything- must depend upon everything else. But if this be the case, we can not know about anything till we equally know everything else. Apparently, therefore, we are under the necessity of saying everything at once. This supposed necessity is palpably untrue. Accordingly, it is incumbent on us to explain how there can be intern-al relations, seeing that we admit finite truths." Whitehead then goes on to state the principle that makes this possible, the very principle that we have used in defining and measuring physical measurables, each one independently of the defi- nition and measurement of all the others. Current is not defined by its functional relations to other measurables. If it were so defined these functional relations would become internal relations. But by using our definition of current, a definition that gives it no content in the form of internal relations, all its functional rela- tions to other measurables become ex'ternal relations.2 "The whole principle is that a particular determination can be made of the how of some definite relationship of a definite eternal object A to a definite number n of other eternal objects, without any determina- tion of the other n objects X1, X2, . . . XE, except that they have, each of them, the requisite status to play their respective parts in that multiple relationship" (Science and the Modern World, page 229). "The relationships of an eternal object A, considered as consti- tutive of A, merely involve other eternal objects as bare relata with- out regard to their individual essences" (Science and the Modern World, page 231). 2aWhitehead calls these internal relations. He makes them constitute what he calls "the relational essence of eternal objects." The independence which the writer has ascribed to eternal objects is expressed by Whitehead by his phrase, "the isolation of eternal objects."</page><page sequence="10">598 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Also he states this independence of universals in the Prin'iple of Relativity, pages 23, 24, as follows: Here the term "factor" takes the place of eternal object or universal. It may be understood as taking the place of physical measurable. Our physical measurable, electric current, is a factor in the fact constituted by the electric cir- cuit. We are going to cognize this factor, electric current, actively, that is, for its own sake. As such we are cognizing it by relatedness, to use his terms. He says: "We still have to explain how awareness of a factor can exclude ignorance of the relationships involved in its significance. For, on the face of it, this doctrine means that to per- ceive factor A we require also to perceive factor B, C, D, etc., which A signifies. In view of the possibilities of ignorance, such a doc- trine appears to be extremely doubtful. This objection ignores the analysis of awareness into cognizance by adjective and cognizance by relatedness. In order to perceive A we do not require to be conscious of B, C, D, with cognizance by adjective. We only re- quire cognizance by relatedness. In other words, we must be con- scious of B, C, D, as entities requisite for that relatedness to A, which is involved in A's significance. But even this explanation asks far too much. It suggests that we must be conscious of B, C, D, as a definite numerical aggregate. Some necessary qualification of the doctrine of significance has been omitted. The missing principle is that any factor A has to be uniformly significant. Every entity involves that fact shall be patient of it. The patience of fact for A is the converse side of the significance of A within fact, and this means a systematic aggregate of factors each within the uniform im- press of the patience of fact for A. A can be because they are. Each such factor individually expresses the patience of fact for A." In the defining of electric current with a view to measuring it we must find within the aggregate of fact constituting the electric cir- cuit a uniform patience for electric current. The aggregate of fact in the circuit will be the various phenomena of heating, lighting, electrolysis, and magnetic effect. These may be found to have a uniform patience for electric current. That is, a relation of current to heating, magnetic effect, or electrolysis may be found such that we may measure current by means of this uniform relationship, this uniform patience, without measuring heat, or magnetic effect, nor electrolysis. Yet current will be measured by using this uni- form relation. It will be remembered that the eternal objects or universals, or more specifically, measurables like electric current, had no content of their own. It was in the case of "current" merely an "activity" that was everywhere the same along the circuit, and which added up across the circuit. It is a question whether this "activity"</page><page sequence="11">WHOLES AND PREHENSIVE UNITIES 599 called "current" should be identified with any of the various other universals with which it is correlated. The hypothetical charge moving in the circuit, if it has any reality at all, should possibly never be identified with "current." It would be correlated with it, just as the heating and magnetic and electrolytic phenomena are correlated with it. "In physics there is an abstraction. The science ignores what anything is in itself. Its entities are merely considered in respect to their extrinsic reality, that is to say, in respect to their aspect in other things" (Whitehead, Science and the Modern World, page 213). These physical universals have an individuality of their own. It is due to their setting in the entities of sense with which they are correlated. Because of this fact of complete abstractness, and of their measurability, physical meas- urables are admirably fitted to become elements in mathematical and geometrical wholes. It is hardly correct to say that the content of physical measurables is the operation by which they are measured. The definition of the measurable, as we have seen in the case of the electric current, determines the operation of measuring, and the def- inition is determined by the whole of the circuit as it exists for some observer. So, in any case, the operation can not give the current its content, but the operation and its whole setting gives it individuality as an eternal object. Even the definition gives it no content. The operation as it would appear in description would have a sensuous content made up of objects of sense that are correlated with the act of measuring. Some measurables have what might be taken for content that can be sensed. Time was thought of by Newton as something that "flows equably." But this object of the inner sense is probably only correlated with the contentless something we measure as time. Mass is correlated with a human organism's sensibility to inertia. Force with a sense of pull, some- times. But physicists have long since refused to identify these objects of human sensibility with the things they measure. The insistence now being made by many physicists, who balk at Einstein's geometrizing of physics, that our physical entities must not be given up for mere geometrical abstractions, is nothing more than a hang-over from the very anthropomorphism that these same physi- cists would denounce in the most unsparing terms. In fact, these physicists would carry their disapproval of this anthropomorphism beyond all bounds. For these physical measurables were isolated and defined in the setting of the objects of sense with which they are correlated. These physical measurables owe their individuality to that anthropomorphic setting. If they are to keep that indi- viduality they must never be dislodged from that original setting. Their individuality has developed only in the process, a whole ana-</page><page sequence="12">600 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY lyzing into abstractions and generalizing into universals. This process takes place only in the interest of facilitating the develop- ment of the whole in which these universals function. They must return again into the whole from which they have emerged. They never lose their setting. They preserve their individuality. Mass keeps its individuality. It never becomes identified with a curvature of space-time. But a curvature in space-time is correlated with mass. The measurable mass has no content as a measurable. This enables it to function in a purely geometrical whole such as space- time is. In this way space-time may come to mirror in a kind of Leibnitzian sense all the physical world, just through the correla- tions between the physical universals, measurables, and space-time measurables. This will give the physical world a unity in which rational deductive processes will rule after the analogy of geomet- rical deduction in three dimensions of space. Through the correla- tions of the mental entities and abstractive hierarchies abstracted from the external world with the physical activities of human organ- isms, the latter may come to mirror all the world of human experience in a way analogous to the way in which space-time may come to mirror the physical world. The behavioristic psychologist will then come just as near to monopolyzing the whole scientific stage as the mathematician will, and no nearer. There will be no reduction of the universe to psychology on the one hand, nor to mathematics on the other. There may be the possibility of countless other unities of a similar type. The most significant unity will remain the par- ticular actual wholes, "esthetic achievements," that make the actual world. Now the nature of the modern form of Leibnitzian monadology as it appears in Whitehead comes clearly to view. Space-time mir- rors other wholes through the correlations of the other physical measurables with time and space. Time and space measurables are in no wise different from other physical mearsuables, and they are correlated with them just as all physical measurables are correlated with one another. Relativity thus comes to be only the universal relatedness in all nature which makes science possible. The human organism may come to mirror other wholes and so give unity to all of human experience through correlations between the organisms' activities and events in the world outside the organism. Just this universal relatedness in nature is a part, at least, of what is referred to when it is said that a whole is what it is for or to some other whole. This view differs apparently in some particulars from White- head's. Time-space comes to mirror the physical world through a type of relativity like Einstein's rather than Whitehead's. White- head takes exception to Einstein's generalized relativity because he</page><page sequence="13">WHOLES AND PREHENSIVE UNITIES 601 thinks he must find some uniform significance for events and he thinks he finds this in space-time. "The uniform significance of events thus becomes the uniform spatio-temporal structure of events" (The Principle of Reltivity, page 25). Most physicists seem to have an analogous notion. Many physicists seem to think that all measurables are measured in terms of time and space. We have seen how one physical measurable is measured independently, not only of all other physical measurables, but independently of time and space measurements. This is true of physical meas- urables generally. Time and space do not constitute a fixed structure without which all our physical concepts would collapse. It is time that space-time should assume its own proper r6le as constituting only one of the generalized, abstrakct wholes in which the intuitions of nature appear. There is no demand for any uniform structure of events to constitute their uniform significance. The application of Whitehead'sa own principles of abstraction shows that in every whole there is a uniform significance for the universals that char- acterize it. The electric circuit also illustrates Whitehead's "abstractive hierarchy." It is an; abrupt hierarchy with the single measurable, energy, at the vertex. All the measurables of the circuit get their unity in the whole by cooperating to the end of transferring energy. This energy is a function of the other measurables and of the func- tional groups of measurables, that is to say, of the complex eternal objects of the circuit. At the base of the hierarchy occur the simple measurables. In nature we would have infinite abstractive hier- archies, instead of such a finite or abrupt one as the electric eircuit. For the energy of the circuit is related to other eternal objects outside the circuit. The hierarchy could be indefinitely developed until relations were established with everything in the universe. A whole, like an electric circuit, has a structure as well as activi- ties. The activities constitute, strictly speaking, the finiteness of the hierarchy. The structure in which these activities are imbedded has many aspects of theoretical interest. This structure includes sense objects, such as color, sound, etc., which are also eternal ob- jects and are correlated with all the other eternal objects of the hier- archy, constituting by such correlations, laws of nature. But these sense objects are not activities as part of the system of activities that make the hierarchy finite and give it unity and give purpose to the concrete whole. These sense objects are a part of the structure. The structure also includes enduring objects, such as copper wire, masses of iron, rubber, shellac, etc. These enduring objects are made of atoms, and these atoms bring into the electric circuit an infinite relatedness to the rest of the universe. But these atoms</page><page sequence="14">602 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY enter as structure. Whenever they enter as activities they disrupt the finite hierarchy, the limited whole. Of course, they are always activities, and they are slowly disintegrating the finite whole, the electric circuit. But this action is so very slow that for human organisms the electric circuit is an enduring object, embedding finite hierarchy of activities significant for the unity of a finite whole. The activities of the structure are irrelevant to the activities of the whole complex. But these irrelevant and disintegrating activities, bringing into the whole all the infinite relatedness of nature, are the explanation of nature's infinite plasticity to human genius and invention. These are the causes of destruction and death and also of transformation and progress. "It is this realized extension of eternal relatedness beyond the mutual relatedness of the actual occasions, which prehends into each occasion the full sweep of eternal relatedness." "This graded en- visagement is how the actual includes what (in one sense) is not- being as a positive factor in its own achievement. . . . By it fact is confronted with alternatives" (Whitehead, Science and the Mod- ern World, page 247). The circuit as electrical theory describes it at any time, is a closed fact, hard and stubborn. The existence of these irrelevant activities as structure, bringing in the eternal related- ness of nature, makes this fact infinitely plastic. Through this, closed fact will be "confronted with alternatives." As Whitehead says, we have here "the source of error, of truth, of art, of ethics, of religion" (Science and the Modern World, page 247), and, it could be added, the romance of scientific discovery, of which the following is an example. Langmuir is trying to find a gas that he can introduce into a tungsten lamp that will shut down the evaporation of tungsten. He tries hydrogen. An unexpected result appears. While he has been approaching that great improvement in efficiency in lighting expressed by a watt per candle power, he now finds, with an atmos- phere of hydrogen, a tremendous lowering of efficiency, seventeen watts per candle power. In the electric circuit the atom of hydrogen and all its complex of relations is now a factor. Now it becomes an active disintegrating factor. Dissociated molecules of hydrogen are playing their part. In the past such atomic hydrogen has been only in the realm of possibility. Now it comes forth into the realm of actuality. What had been introduced to serve as structure be- comes activity. The electric circuit now begins to express its unity in a new way, viz., conveying energy from one place to another where it appears in the form of unheard of high temperatures, effect- ing welding processes without oxidation. Through this infinite re-</page><page sequence="15">WHOLES AND PREHENSIVE UNITIES 603 latedness in the realm of possibility embodied in every occasion, every event, every actual whole, nature assumes an infinite plasticity. This plasticity is realized paradoxically by respecting nature's hard and stubborn facts in all their hardness and stubbornness. A more definite meaning for the term "field" of a whole now emerges. Two wholes come into that relation in which one is what it is for the other. The two wholes are concrete events, such as a human organism and an actual concrete electric circuit. These two atomic complexes of activity are embedded in structures, which are sensible objects and enduring objects. These two atomic com- plexes of activity come into relation through their fields. The field of the concrete actual electric circuit is the abstractive hierarchy of eternal objects for which the circuit is found to have a patience. Each eternal object in the hierarchy is not only embedded in this circuit, it is also logically embedded in whole classes of circuits in that fluid manner that is the very essence of its being a universal. It also has that kind of independence that we have observed it as having. This independence and universality make this abstractive hierarchy a fluid creative spirit playing around the whole, constitut- ing its field. (Metaphor is no new thing either in science or philos- ophy.) At the same time this abstractive hierarchy constitutes a part of the mind of the human organisms for whom it is what it is. The fact that every element of the abstractive hierarchy is embedded logically in all kinds of possible actual wholes makes a new actual electric circuit a possibility as a creation. The possible structures in which the eternal objects of the hierarchy are embedded, made of sense objects and enduring objects, stimulates the human organism to those activities that assemble ele- ments of structure into a new whole. This action of assembling obeys the pattern that the abstractive hierarchy has assumed through the relatedness of the eternal objects constituting it and through the purpose or end that make finite hierarchies suitable characteriza- tions of finite concrete wholes. These elements of structure and purpose in which the activities of abstractive hierarchies of eternal objects are embedded stimulate through their physical correlates those activities of the human organism that constitute its field. The field of the organism and that of some particular electric circuit thus merge. The two wholes through the merging of their fields make a new whole, a new unity. Within that unity, the finite abstractive hierarchy of the electric circuit becomes what Whitehead calls "mental." This breaking off from actual illimitability is what in any occasion marks off that which is termed mental from that which belongs to the physical event to which the mental functioning is referred" (Whitehead, Science and the Modern World, page 239).</page><page sequence="16">604 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY This mental element and its embodying sense objects together with the stimulated sensibility of the human organism become what we may call the mind of the organism. This mind of the organism, together with the structure and activities of it, constitute the self or personality. We are now introducing these terms free from their load of traditional assumptions, as names for what has been em- pirically found. We have seen how a certain organization of sense objects and value objects make up the structure of wholes. These sense objects and objects of value give the activities that science measures, their setting and individuality. The organization of these objects of sense and of value give to wholes that character expressed by Whitehead as "esthetic achievement." The creation of wholes by man is art, in the broad sense of the term. There is an art of building electric circuits. It respects purposes and ends. It has regard for the limitations imposed by the material which it works into structure and by the laws of nature correlating embodied ac- tivities. This esthetic achievement appears in all the abstract unities that finally enter concrete wholes. When he was finding the path of a material particle Maupertius was seeking how bodies move from point to point in a way fulfilling the glory of God. That was merely a theological interpretation of esthetic achievement in the field of mathematics. All abstract unities, like space-time, eventually come to characterize concrete particular wholes and they bear within themselves a character of esthetic achievement in some way borrowed from the concrete wholes from which they have been produced in order to characterize. When a thinker is solving a problem, how do the various entities with which he is dealing, entities which may themselves be activities, organize themselves into new wholes. Poincare, in a paper entitled "Mathematical Discovery, " holds that the elements of the problem are undergoing an activity like the motion of molecules in the kinetic gas theory. They accidentally collide and form complex groups. When a group is accidentally formed that satisfies a certain esthetic demand, consciousness awakens and fixes into permanency what was accidentally formed. May we not rather say that the very fact that the elements of the problem form an esthetic whole constitutes it a whole without any assumed " activity" in some dimension outside the categories of ordinary activity. These elements do not have to come into juxtaposition in space and time in order to be such a, whole. As yet it is a generalized whole, complex of eternal objects, an abstractive hierarchy. It can become an actuality only for some human organism. In order that this may come to pass some human organism must assemble actual structures, in which the simple eternal objects are embedded, into a whole. Then, through the activities</page><page sequence="17">WVHOLES AND PREHENSIVE UNITIES 605 of the organism, actual activities, the abstractive hierarchy becomes a particular whole. A simple eternal object without correlates that make it a whole carries in itself a demand for such correlates. This seems to be the ultimate fact of nature, the evolution of wholes. When the elec- tric circuit exhibited its magnetic property to Oersted, this new factor demanded its correlates, and for Faraday this demand became a chaHlenge that gave him no rest until he had discovered electro- magnetic induction. Implication is the demand of eternal objects to be integrated into a complex whole. As stated above, by virtue of the very fact that a certain relation subsists among eternal objects, making a unity, itself, or whole, subsists. And since these eternal objects are em- bedded in a fluid fashion in actual structures, these actualities, driven by the eternal objects' demand for wholeness, stimulates the activities of a human organism to assemble actual wholes. All that prevents is the opposing tendency toward other unities. Thus it is that the elements of PoincarV's problem integrate spontaneously. The unity is developed as a whole all at once. It will be recalled that in order to define, isolate, and measure the universals that express the nature of the electric circuit, it was necessary to maintain that circuit in a constant condition. This is but an instance of the general proposition that upon the constancy of wholes depend all the projects of science. If wholes did not main- tain some sort of constancy there would be no natural law, no sys- tems of universals no "uniform association" of universals and no such particular type of uniform assiation as has been interpreted as causality. As a further illustration take the matter of combus- tion. Two or three centuries ago before the discovery of oxygen or even the discovery of the pressure of the air, it might have been possible to make some rough approximation to a law of nature, connecting the rate of combustion with the temperature. The part played by air or oxygen in the air would not have entered the state- ment of the law. The presence of oxygen was a constant element of the whole within which this law of combustion was formulated. The oxygen could not be recognized as a variable having f unctional relations to the temperature and other substances undergoing com- bustion until means were provided for withdrawing oxygen from the wholes within which combustion takes place. At that time, the phenomenon produced by Edison of a piece of charred paper giving forth a brilliant light at a temperature far above the ordinary temper- ature of combustion, would have overthrown what would have been regarded as an established law of nature. But the explanation would be that the phenomenon was taking place within a whole that</page><page sequence="18">606 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY had never been observed before. The charred paper endured at a high temperature in a space from which air had been withdrawn. A new law would have been formulated at once, conditioned by the new type of whole which had developed. In this new law the air would have functioned as a catalytic agent and would have con- tinued to do so until the epoch-making discoveries of Lavoisier. To-day our whole body of chemical laws may be conditioned, for all we know, by the presence of agents which have never been per- mitted to be variables. It is probably not known what part very minute quantities of water play in chemical reactions, for the reason that those reactions are never permitted to take place under con- ditions of absolute dryness. The laws of combustion have had to undergo still further development under the modern great extension of catalytic agencies. The character of the living organism as a whole determines the chemical and physical activities within that organism. This is the "organie mechanism" theory of Whitehead. But as the theory is developed in this paper, the inferences that may be drawn from it are more definitely problematic than they are in the vaguer form in which they appear in both Smuts and White- head. The universals, such as Justice and the Good that characterizes the state, can not be determined within a utopian whole such as Plato's Republic; they must be determined within actual states. An actual state must become a permanent whole before these uni- versals can be defined and correlated. Political science must wait upon the development of more stable political wholes than we have in the world to-day. These wholes must develop within the other wholes that are appearing in contemporary life economic wholes, cultural wholes. No social and political science will become possible until these wholes, now in process of evolution, acquire greater stability than they now show. At present these so-called social sci- ences constitute a speculative field of absorbing interest. The en- gineer developing our machine culture is building the great wholes that will make possible the new humanistic sciences in the future. It will also be apparent that knowledge, distinguished from il- lusion, depends on the coming into existence of stable wholes. The light from a certain area may shape the form of a snake in the eye of a diseased person. This illusion is an element in an unstable whole. If it were a stable whole it would endure long enough to be correlated with other aspects of the given spatial axea. Then the given spatial area in question would develop into a more stable element of a more stable whole. But where wholes are not stable no "perceptual knowledge," and no scientific knowledge, can develop.</page><page sequence="19">WVHOLES AND PREHENSIVE UNITIES 607 The meaning of the term "prehensive unity" now becomes clearer. The human organism and any particular electric circuit become a prehensive unity through the fusion of their fields, the generalized electric circuit of abstractive hierarchies, and field of possible activities of the human organism. We have not used the term "knowledge." The word has too great a burden of traditional assumption in it. As prehensive unities take the place of the tra- ditional mind, so do certain groups of relations within prehensive unities take the place of knowing. The method is to use a term like knowing after we have found something by an empirical process that the term will fit. The human organism comes to know the particular electric circuit. Better, it comes to prehend the electric circuit. The word "prehend" avoids the unfortunate associations of the term "know." If we use the term "knowledge" it comes to have a new meaning. The human organism in coming to know an electric circuit makes the electric circuit what it is. The electric circuit is what it is for the human organism. The human organism is also constituted what it is, by its knowing the electric circuit. It becomes a different organism for knowing the circuit. It ac- quires a new mind, a new field. There are electric circuits in the sun that were never made by human organisms. Larger pre- hensive unities in the sun constituted them what they are. Lang- muir's lamp filled with hydrogen is a whole in itself. It can be conceived as working under conditions where the temperature of the filament is maintained by some agency other than an electric current. The whole complex of activities involved in the lamp, the conveyance of energy from the filament by atomic hydrogen, would go on without the electric circuit. But Langmuir's hydrogen lamp and hydrogen welding whole was constituted what it is by the electric circuit. The electric circuit prehends or knows that lamp, constitutes it what it is, and the electric circuit is constituted what it is by the hydrogen-filled lamp because it becomes a new kind of a whole through the merging of the two wholes in a new unity. Knowledge of nature is constitutive of nature. Laws of nature are invariancies in the ways of knowing nature. The mechanics of a billiard game would be the same when the game is played on board an ocean liner moving with uniform motion as when played on land. The prehension of a uniformly-moving system preserves the laws of mechanics invariant. The prehension of a uniformly- moving system preserves Maxwell's laws of the electric circuit in- variant. The invariances of all the possible prehensions of space- time keeps Einstein's law of gravitation invariant. It is a more universal law than Newton's for that reason. The philosophy of prehension and its unities is independent of any theory of rela-</page><page sequence="20">608 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tivity. It is based on the obvious relatedness of nature. It throws light on the choice of theories of relativity. The process of experience begins when a whole analyzes into abstractions, generalizing them into universals, and reverses the process, thereby facilitating its own progressive evolution. The process ends where it begins, with the whole. The great source of all scientific activity is the whole regarded as an intuition, some- thing obvious to the common sense of the universal man. Back into the great human ocean, sooner or later all our scientific streams return. These words of John Dewey are most significant for the consideration of all contemporary thinkers. "Professed scientific philosophers have been wont to employ the remoter and refinished products of science in ways which deny, discount, or pervert the obvious and immediate facts of gross experience, unmindful that thereby philosophy itself commits suicide" (Experience and Nature, page 3). I am indebted to Professor Stephen C. Pepper of the University of California for encouragement to develop such physical ideas as are expressed in this paper, and for helpful criticisms of my former paper (this JOURNAL, VOl. XXII, (1925), p. 561) which have had a marked influence in shaping the present article. LEWIs E. AKELEY. UNIVEMITY Oi' SourH DAKOTA.</page></plain_text>
