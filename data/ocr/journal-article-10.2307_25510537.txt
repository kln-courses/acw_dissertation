<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Stone Head from Killavilla, County OfPaly. Some years ago during agricultural operations the late Mr. John Shortt Roe of Killavilla House, near Roscrea, attempted to remove a large prostrate boulder from one of his fields. He discovered ^^^^ that the stone had formerly been erect and ^nHfl^k that the socket or cavity in the ground from JKB^H^^^ which it had fallen or been overthrown, was gfl9HBHB^^ still discernible in the earth. Because of its aHnHgHS^^k bulk and weight Mr. Roe abandoned his project JH|H|^HBH^H of removing the stone from the field and caused ,:^HBS^^P^ it to be set up again in its former position. ^HHHgSpflinK The stone, which seems to be a glacial j^^^BBPW^'^^^1 erratic (there are two similar erratic boulders ^^^IHtti^l^^B m adjoining fields), is an almost square limestone ^^^^H^|Btfi|iiB block, much weathered and partially split and 9H|^^^Hj|^H^S holed by the action of water. It measures ^I^P^J^g^^?: approximately 1-45 m. high by 1-30 m. wide "^^^^^m^^m0' and varies in thickness from 27 cm. to 65 cm. In course of clearing the earth round about the socket the carved stone head1 which iMfc^itt^.4iifc^.i forms the subject of this note was found at a depth of about 25 cm. below the surface. The head was carefully preserved at Killavilla House during Mr. Roe's lifetime and after his death, his son, Mr. Albert FitzGerald Roe, realising the importance of the sculpture and the interesting circumstances of its discovery, felt that it should form part of the National collections and consequently, 1 Dr. Mahr, in his paper " New Aspects and Problems in Irish Prehistory," Proc. Preh. Soe. NS, 3, 1937, 415, refers to this find, but incorrectly describes the find-place as Knockavilla, near Roscrea, Co. Tipperary.</page><page sequence="2">264 ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND in 1944, it was acquired from him by the Irish Antiquities Division of the National Museum of Ireland.2 For my part I am indebted to Mr. Roe for this account of the circumstances of the discovery and for facilities to measure the standing stone and determine its position on the 6" Ordnance Survey map.3 In passing it may be noted that in the field adjoining that in which the stone stands there is a low, circular, level mound surrounded by a shallow ditch; it is marked on the 6" Ordnance Survey sheet. This mound, which is about 41m. in diameter and some 60 cm. higher than the general field surface, is traditionally said to have been a cillin4' but superficially there are no indications that it was ever used as a burial ground. The head itself has been fashioned out of an irregular lump of limestone, a good part of which has been left unworked and forms a sort of background and base to the carved part. The overall height of the stone is 37 cm. and of the sculptured part from the top of the head to the chin 28 cm. Its width 2 Reg. No. 1944: 851. 3 O.S. 6", Co. Offaly, Sheet 43, 38.5 cm. E, 17.8 cm.

The upper part of the head is remarkably pointed and rises to a peak above the forehead. This apparent deformity of the normal head shape may have been intended to represent a cap or headgear of some sort, but this is purely conjectural. The eyes which are shewn by means of a shallow sunken line round somewhat oval eyeballs are set in orbits, whose upper edges only are defined. The nose, which forms a continuous line with the brow, is straight, rather flattened and broadens at the nostrils ; these, however, are not indicated. The cheeks are lean and slope to a rounded ehin, above which the lipless mouth is marked by a narrow straight line. There are no ears. There is nothing of the grotesque in the treatment of this head and its effect, especially in profile, is dignified, remote and forbidding. This piece of sculpture may be regarded possibly as an addition to the small group of anthropomorphic sculptures in stone and wood as exemplified in Ireland by the three-faced head from Corleck, Co. Cavan5 and the so-called " Termon CrossJJ at Kilnaboy, Co. Clare,6 with its twin faces set chin to chin, instead of the more usual Janus fashion of some of the Continental examples. Perhaps the closest similarity in appearance to the Killavilla Head is to be found in the general aspect of that of the Ralaghan wooden idol with its staring eyes and lofty narrow head.7 These human sculptures in Ireland are generally ascribed to the Early Iron Age and are thought to have had a ritual significance as cult-images. Support is lent to the dating by two southern British heads8 considered to be Romano-British votive sculptures and especially by Continental examples such as those from the temple of La Halatte9 in Belgium, by the stone statue from Holzgerlingen near Stuttgart in Germany10 and above all by the important group of two-faced heads found in the Celtic sanctuary at Roquepertuse in Provence. Allowing for the difference in the nature of metal and stone and in the skill of the respective artificers, a perceptible likeness exists between the face- on the well-known Aylesford bucket escutcheon11 and the Killavilla Head. Both have the blank, staring look, flattened, straight nose broadening at the nostrils and the lipless slit-like mouth framed by the lean sloping cheek line. On the evidence of such stylistic comparisons a similar date may be postulated for the Killavilla Head but this is by no means incontrovertible. 6 Mahr, A., op. cit., pp. 415-7.

Roe. 12 I have to acknowledge with thanks facilities afforded me by the Keeper of Irish Antiquities, National Museum, to examine and measure the head ; I am grateful to him for having it drawn and photographed, and for permission to publish it.</page></plain_text>
