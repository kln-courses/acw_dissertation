<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XXXVIII, No. 12 JUNE 5, 1941 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ON METHODOLOGY IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY IF exact scientists disagree when they discourse on the philosophi- cal implications of the exact sciences, eminent historians dis- agree even more strikingly when they venture to philosophize on the method and import of their own discipline whose status as a branch of knowledge is not even agreed upon. Greater disagree- ment and obscurity will persist among philosophers of history so long as theories about the method of establishing historical generali- zations are not analyzed as critically and carefully as the methods of the sciences have been ever since ancient Greek reflections over theories of empirical and logical inquiry. Discussion of "method" will be restricted in this paper to mean only (a) the type of ques- tions raised by investigators, and (b) the type of evidence sought and the definitions of terms used to answer these questions. This definition of "method" aims to include only the common features of the many special techniques and instruments of investigation which vary in any inquiry with the subject-matter, the personality and training of the inquirer, and with the state of knowledge of the subject in question. The "methodology" of any subject of inquiry is a theory or set of definitions and procedural assumptions about what is common to all such instances, and will contain general assertions about (a) and (b). It is the aim of this essay to compare the characteristic elements of the method of empirical inquiry with those employed in the investigation and verification of generalizations about human his- tory. Three methodologies used implicitly or explicitly in the es- tablishment of such generalizations will be outlined and examined critically: (1) naturalistic empiricism, which assumes that there is no essentially different method required for investigating the re- mains and documents of human history than the empirical method of inquiry defined by the sorts of questions actually raised and- answerable by means of observations and ordinary reflection; (2) classical rationalism, which subordinates empirical knowledge of particulars to the intuition or a priori grasp of more "essential" universal truths of nature and society; (3) organicism, which sub- ordinates piece-meal empiricism, probabilism, and external relations altogether in favor of transcendent unities or "organic wholes" 309</page><page sequence="2">310 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY that determine the empirical contents of history with necessity. In defining and classifying these three general and pervasive method- ologies, it is not claimed that every historian or philosopher of his- tory adopts exclusively or explicitly one and only one of these methodologies. On the contrary, the methodological problem arises because these methodologies are too often indiscriminately used to- gether. The historian of human thought knows too well how often incongruous ideas and attitudes occur in the same thinker, espe- cially in so far as he inherits conflicting intellectual traditions. It is, however, maintained here that these three methodological doc- trines are incompatible with one another when applied simultane- ously to the interpretation of history, and it will be argued that only the first holds forth any logical possibility for the objective or scientific testingf of theories in the philosophy of history. The latter term is used here to designate both (a) the methodology of historical inquiry, and (b) theories as to the chief causal factors, "trends," or alleged universal laws of human history. Theories of method used in historical writings in order to estab- lish causal laws or invariant factors in history need not be gathered solely from explicit references in writings labelled "Philosophy of History. " The historian of thought will seek the more covert forms of reasoning-habits which constitute the inner logic, the logica utens, of a thinker's views of history. Every thinker's the- ory of history has a methodological frame of reference and orienta- tion even where there is in his writings no explicit "philosophy of history " or logica docens. In any case our task here is to analyze three of these methodological frames of reference and their diver- gent modes of affecting historical investigation and interpretation. In so far as these three theories of method differ on the funda- mental issue as to whether the empirical method of inquiry is exclusively adequate to deal with the sort of questions raised by the historian and philosopher of history, it will be pertinent to indicate the sorts of questions, terms, and procedures common to and definitive of empirical inquiry, and the corresponding ques- tions-and terms and procedures appropriate thereto-of the his- torian, or of the philosopher of history. The general methodologi- cal assumptions postulated here are: (a) that a method is suitable if and only if it can answer adequately definite questions raised concerning a specific subject-matter of inquiry; (b) that the subject- matter of any inquiry is empirically defined or delimited by the definitions of the terms used to formulate the problems which initi- ate the inquiry; and (c) that the same elements of method, viz., definitions of terms and procedural assumptions, are appropriate to the same types of problems.</page><page sequence="3">METHODOLOGY IN PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 311 Confronted by an observed phenomenon or event an investigator in an empirical inquiry may ask: 1. What happened at a certain time and place, i.e., what charac- teristics of the event were observed and capable of being recorded? It is assumed that the observed characteristics of the event are communicable by signs, because only the absolute uniqueness of an event is incommunicable, whereas every event, no matter how unique, must have some characters in common with other events, and it is these sharable characters that can be recorded, ordered, interpreted, and subsumed under generalizations. 2. What were (a) the observed, or (b) the inferable and con- ceivably relevant antecedents of the effects? This presupposes a prior discrimination, on the basis of previous observation, experi- ment, or of confirmed theory, of possibly relevant from irrelevant antecedents. 3. Which among the possibly relevant antecedents is correlated sufficiently with the occurrence of the effect in the instances under consideration and with our knowledge of its sharable characters to enable us to infer or predict that whenever similar antecedents occur similar effects (or vice versa) will recur? This question has traditionally been associated with the problem of establishing " causal connections" as necessary and sufficient conditions for the recurrence of the observed effect, but it is an open question whether anything more is required here than the application of the various empirical methods of establishing and verifying fune- tional and, when possible, statistical correlations of phenomena with whatever degree of probability can be ascertained whenever the phenomena lend themselves to numerical correlation. 4. Is there any general law or hypothesis pertinent to more than the particular class of phenomena under investigation which the results of the foregoing procedures tend to suggest, or-if one has been previously formulated-to confirm or disconfirm? This type of general law is actually established already only in such advanced hypothetico-deductive types of inquiry as mathematical physics. These are indications-rough but enough for the present pur- pose-of the elements in the general procedure which we call the method of " empirical inquiry." What are the corresponding questions-and terms and procedures appropriate thereto-of the historian, or of the philosopher of history, and how closely are these the counterparts of the former? That is: 1. How does the historian obtain evidence of the spatio-temporal order of the past phenomena or events he is concerned with? This is the methodological problem of biographers and chroniclers, for example.</page><page sequence="4">312 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHI 2. How can the historian infer conceivably relevant antecedents of these characterized events? This is the question as to whether objective historical interpretation or explanation is at all possible. 3. Can historians find correlations or "causes" on the basis of which he can test the relevancy of suspected antecedents or make "predictions"? This is the question as to whether scientific veri- fication of historical generalizations is possible. 4. Are there "laws of history" which the historian or philoso- pher of history can establish in the form of "trends" or "tend- encies" covering large spans of history or even the whole of it? And are such laws or categories more than logical constructions designed to bridge lacunae in the empirical data furnished by docu- ments and testimony? Naturalistic empiricism maintains that the elements of method implicit in the questions, terms, and procedures of empirical in- quiry are adequate enough to warrant the rejection from histori- ography of such terms as "eternal ideas" and "organic unity" which are, we shall indicate, postulated as logically "prior" to and more "important" than particulars of history in the methods of classical rationalism and organicism, respectively. The defense of this thesis will be argued by showing that the four sorts of ques- tions formulated above as the general syntactical and procedural elements of the method of empirical inquiry have their counterpart in the questions, terms, and procedures that initiate, formulate, and direct historical inquiry, and that the philosophy of history is, therefore, always subject to the criteria of verification of the method of empirical inquiry, rather than to the criteria of classical ration- alism or organicism. 1. While it is obviously true that the historian does not directly observe the past phenomena he is actually investigating, and has to depend on testimony and documentary reports whose authenticity and credibility are ever subject to doubt, it is correspondingly true that unauthenticated data revealed by purely personal and dubious observation of natural phenomena are as much subject to errors as the credibility and authenticity of historical testimony and docu- ments. Logically considered, the data of direct observation, whether external or introspective, are subject to the same sort of controls as the data of documents and testimony used in historical investigation. The greater probability of obtaining agreement on the basis of direct observation than on the basis of documents in historiography arises from the statistical fact that more persons can observe and point to natural phenomena. That is to say, the conditions for observing natural phenomena are more often re- peated without much variation, and therefore provide a fairly con-</page><page sequence="5">METHODOLOGY IN PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 313 stant ground for being duplicated experimentally than the irre- trievably past and more variable social or cultural phenomena. There is, however, an important exception to the latter sort of cul- tural variability if we consider the history of ideas which reflect general current and recurrent movements in the social and intel- lectual milieu. The historian of ideas can systematically and criti- cally observe and collate the recurrent ideas and the climates of opinion in which they appear, for the socio-psychologic conditions which favor certain ideas do seem to recur. Psychologically considered, the function of singular observations or reports of them function as stimuli to curiosity and investigation in both empirical inquiry and historical study. And from the standpoint of epistemology there is no more justification for accept- ing single reports of direct observations even in the natural sciences as constituting verifiable knowledge of what is observed than there is for regarding the sum-total of historical knowledge to be given in the mere chronicling of singular occurrences from single reports. 2. Even when historiography restricts itself to establishing chronological sequences it is implied that some form of order, even if it is only a series of dates, is desiderated in addition to single reports. And since any single event is preceded by an indefinitely large number of events, the historian has to select the conceivably relevant antecedents from a mass of documentary testimony. It has been argued by no less eminent an historian than Charles Beard that historians can not objectively establish what is relevant among antecedents since every historian will select whatever his group- interests and personal bias lead him to regard as "important." The fact that historians must select amongst a large mass of re- ported events and usually do so by letting their personal or group bias choose what they regard as "important" in any cross-section or period of history does not of itself necessarily make the empirical method of gathering the data of history "unscientific" or "sub- jective." In any empirical inquiry the investigator will have to select and isolate those aspects of his field of observations which he regards as relevant to his problem. The term "importance" has a psychological sense which is not to be confused with the logical sense which attaches to evidence obtained from authenticated docu- ments, reliable testimony, and scientific knowledge from which one may infer what is relevant independently of the interests or per- sonal history of the investigators. One historical fact is objectively relevant to or "explains" another only if the first logically implies the second. So long as the historian will frankly admit his point of view or purpose, the psychological "importance" he attaches to his find-</page><page sequence="6">314 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ings as to what antecedents are relevant will be limited to those who share his point of view and interest. And it is always possible that the most biased selection may reveal unsuspected antecedents, which from the more general, logical sense of importance will affect the probabilities of other hypotheses as to what the relevant ante- cedents are. The detection of bias is part of the critical task of the historian who always has to be wary of implicit and disguised arbitrariness present "between the lines" of his documents. So too, astronomers have to be wary of those observers who report "seeing" canals on Mars because the lines on that planet visible through the telescope will look like canals to those who, like Kant and Flammarion, seek signs of human life on other heavenly bodies. 3. The question of social or historical "causation" is often re- garded as the chief stumbling-block to the claims of naturalistic empiricism in human history because of two apparently insur- mountable difficulties: (a) the difficulty of isolating experimentally any of the alleged "causes" from the complex historical context in which they seem to be inextricably set; (b) the practical impossi- bility of contriving crucial experiments in order to eliminate one or more of several possible hypotheses as to what the "necessary conditions" or "'invariable antecedents" of an irretrievably past phenomenon were. It must be acknowledged that any cross-section or segment of social and cultural history has a bewilderingly complex variety of aspects, e.g., geographical, climatic, agronomic, biological, psycho- logical, economic, political, nationalistic, etc., that will naturally be more difficult to deal with than any class of the physical aspects of events, simply because the latter is a sub-class of the group of historical conditions of mankind's social and cultural career. It is extremely difficult to judge which of a group of temporal factors is the preponderant one solely by alleged observation of all of them in any concrete historical situation. But this is a difficulty not peculiar to naturalistic empiricism which recognizes the empirical fact that the isolation of unit-factors is more difficult in some do- mains than in others. For classical rationalism merely postulates that certain invariable laws govern social and cultural history on the analogy of the laws established in the more deductive sciences. And those whom I here call, for short, organicists, by simply fusing together all social and cultural factors through dialectical formulae, likewise offer no developmental history of any one of these factors in its determinate temporal relations to the others, and no way of distinguishing "accidental" from "causal" relations. The methodological advantage of naturalistic empiricism over the other two resides in its requiring, empirically isolable and correlated sue-</page><page sequence="7">METHODOLOGY IN PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 315 cessions of observable phenomena as a check on any generalizations of alleged "causal connection" or dialectical interdependence of fac- tors. Furthermore, the very notion of "causal connection" as an a priori requirement of historical inquiry is subject to challenge. In place of an a priori category of causality, the empiricist falls back on functional or statistical correlations based on observations of the frequency with which certain classes of phenomena succeed each other, and on previously confirmed theories concerning their probable connections. In any case the method of naturalistic em- piricism assumes that any generalization about the "causal connec- tions" of events must be tested by analytical observation of the actual temporal successions of particular instances of determinate and repeatable characters of events which taken as a whole are unique and non-communicable. Wars between states, for example, will have the same "causes" only to the extent that similar condi- tions economic, political, ideological, etc.-are observed, or re- ported reliably to have been observed, to characterize such wars which never recur in exactly the same form but which have had recurrent aspects. Neither classical rationalism nor organicism offers any method of estimating even approximately the probabili- ties of inferred connections between the characters of historical events because both of them subordinate empirical and statistical correlations to generalizations about trends or patterns in history which are regarded as a priori more basic. The brute fact is not the sole concern of the historian, because every such fact logically invalidates a oeneralization that ignores the fact, and is the basis for a generalization that connects it with other facts. A prediction in historiography, taken empirically, means simply a hypothesis about the facts you will discover about the past if you examine certain evidence not yet thoroughly sifted. It is a fact also that trained and competent historians can and do make such predictions. They have acquired a sense of the chief characteristics of a particular period, man, or institution, as a result of long and intimate study of the recurrent characters revealed by the pertinent literature, personal remains, or monuments. Prediction of future events can be no more reliable than the laws of human society which are far from being as exactly determinable as classical rationalists and organicists presuppose. 4. Historical hypotheses like all empirical assertions in the natu- ral sciences are subject to the logical criteria of internal consistency and of probability with respect to external evidence. Since any description of the sequence of events has to be made from some selective point of view which does not distort the phenomena in- vestigated, historical discourse has the same obligation of making</page><page sequence="8">316 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY its choice of presuppositions as explicit and open to criticism as all rational discourse. It is historically true that this obligation has been recognized and met more often in the natural sciences than in historical studies. Yet the natural sciences themselves have all gone through stages of animistic and anthropomorphic preconcep- tions and emerged with more objective and fruitful generalizations only after long subjection to the habit of critical scrutiny of as- sumptions and methods. The historical continuity of the develop- ment of the natural sciences is itself a product of human history where cumulative progress has been made by habitually subjecting the ideas of one's predecessors and contemporaries to continual criticism. Naturalistic empiricism denies that historians or philosophers of history are logically justified in claiming more than the rough formulation of hypotheses with respect to these general questions as to the larger trends or directions of large portions or even the whole of history. Such questions as to whether there are any "laws of history" comparable to Newton's laws of motion, or any "trend laws" as to its direction or path-linear, cyclical, or ellip- tical-are instances of the fallacy of many questions, and beg the operational question as to whether the historiographer does in fact proceed with hypotheses systematized deductively like those of mathematical physics. Peirce's speculations on this question illustrate on a grand scale the confusion of empiricistic and a priori considerations. After raising the question: "Is there, for example, any general tendency in the course of events, any progress in one direction on the whole?",' he tells us that philosophy has to consider whether the universe develops "like the increase of an angle, so that it proceeds forever without tending toward anything unattained," 2 or from a chaos in the infinitely past to something, different and ideal in the infinitely future, or from nothing in infinite time back to nothing. In another place, Peirce calls the first of these hypotheses, the "el- liptic philosophy" of naturalism, the second is the "hyperbolic philosophy," and the third is the "parabolic philosophy" cf his- tory.3 Peirce himself urges: "That which we of these times ought to try is rather the hypothesis that the logic of the universe is one to which our own aspires rather than attains." 4 The confusion in Peirce of empiricism or temporalistic naturalism and classical rationalism is evident in his further assertion: "The evolutionary 1 C.

Peirce, Collected Papers, vol. 6, p. 7. 2 Ibid., 6.27, p. 23. 3 Ibid., 6.582 f., p. 387. 4 Ibid., 6.189, p. 134.</page><page sequence="9">METHODOLOGY IN PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 317 process is, therefore, not a mere evolution of the existing universe, but rather a process by which the very Platonic forms themselves have become or are becoming developed." 5 That laws themselves evolve is a result incompatible with classical rationalism, and leads to an infinite regress of laws concerning the relations of such laws to their preceding forms. It is our knowledge of laws and their empirical referents that evolve, and not the uniformities themselves or their logical relations. In any case, generalizations about the more limited range of events in social and cultural history are at best descriptive and classificatory hypotheses corresponding to the taxonomic and evolu- tionary accounts of flora and fauna, studies of wild-life and selec- tive breeding, etc., appropriately falling under the rubric "natural history"-accounts of the shifting panorama of nature and human history which the naturalistic empiricism may use as a bird's-eye view that does not disclose specific objects or movements in detail. It is characteristic of rationalistic and organistic philosophies of his- tory to supply answers freely to questions of this type, without much regard for the empirical difficulties of verification, or for the logical difficulties of estimating the probabilities of such general theories. The "laws" which such philosophies of history have oftenest tried to establish are not laws relating to constant correla- tions of specific, indefinitely repeatable kinds of antecedents and consequents, but are assertions of " trends, " the cumulative in- crease or decrease of some character or process in history as a whole, or some large span of it. Consider, for example, the "law" of the indefinite progress and perfectibility of man, so popular among that group of classical rationalists that are associated with the Enlight- enment (D 'Alembert, Condorcet, Voltaire, Herder, Kant, etc.). This sort of "trend-law" is too often a confusion of descriptive and normative hypotheses, for what specific descriptive account of the concrete history of man's social and cultural achievements in the arts, sciences, law, philosophy, and religion, could establish em- pirically the objective validity of such an idea as human progress which is shot through with value-judgments as to the universal norm by which particular events are to be judged? Many an ex- ample of this attribution of normative concepts to existential condi- tions is to be found in classical philosophies of human history: Rousseau's "Man is born free, but everywhere he is in chains,'" Hegel's "Whatever is, is right," are stock in trade expressions of radical and conservative social programs as well as of philosophies of history. Kant revealed a similar confusion when he declared that a philosophical universal history must be directed toward the 5 Ibid., 6.194, p. 135.</page><page sequence="10">318 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY disclosure of nature's secret plan to produce a perfect moral solu- tion to the political problem of international relations among peo- ples by the adoption of a civil constitution that would guarantee perpetual peace and justice.6 The idea that history must realize certain ideals of human welfare has, in the light of recent history, been tragically unfulfilled. To save the trend-law of progress, constant or periodic, the classical rationalist will resort to the vague notion of "the long run of events," just as the optimist who will transmute apparent evil into good by the dictum that all must come out well in the end. The difficulties of framing adequate positive laws for civil society has led the classical rationalist to resort to so-called invariant laws of right reason ultimately grounded in the invariant laws of nature or God. But this discrimination of variable positive laws and other allegedly "accidental" features of man's cultural life from the allegedly invariant laws essential to his physical or cultural life rests on the classical Platonic-Aristotelian tradition and error of regarding what is logically prior, the universal or essential, as thereby ipso facto the better, the empirically necessary or the abso- lutely imperative. From the standpoint of naturalistic empiricism, all historical laws, no matter how long a span of time they cover, are statistical descriptions of average tendencies, and all value- judgments are hypothetical, variable, and tentative as the history of human desire and ethical or legal systems reveals them to be. The absolute metaphysical distinction of " accident'" and "'essence" is an outmoded vestige of the Aristotelian doctrine of predicables. Hypotheses in the philosophy of history can not be substantiated by the application of such a priori value-judgments, although em- pirical historiography can furnish evidence relevant to the probable fulfillment of tentatively adopted norms or preferred forms of human behavior. Value-judgments may enter into historical accounts either ob- jectively or subjectively: (a) objectively, whenever the historical events or data themselves include value-judgments as motives, real or alleged, for certain actions, or when the historian of culture sets himself the task of discovering regularities in the variations of taste, literary and artistic styles or fashions, systems of ethical, legal, and religious beliefs, etc., that characterize a community or an age. Literature and the arts as found in minor writers, jour- nalists, and orators will reveal more of the current values in a society than the more critical and independent thinkers who rebel at the commonly accepted values of an age. (b) Subjectivity enters when the historian's method or approach is influenced, implicitly or 6 Kant, Zur Allgemeiner Geschichte der Welt im Biirgerlicher Absicht.</page><page sequence="11">METHODOLOGY IN PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 319 explicitly, by his own interests and the standards of taste and con- duct which he has adopted from some past or contemporary society or group. It is the subjective value-judgments that the critical historian must be wary of, especially when they are only implicitly present in the historian's method of approach or in the historical documents he is consulting. These subjective value-judgments of historians or philosophers of history, when analyzed out of the documents, themselves furnish one of the most fertile clues to the contemporary value-judgments of an age or society. Both the dis- tinction and the relation between the subjective and objective ways in which value-judgments affect history are illustrated in such philosophies of history as Bishop Bossuet's Discourse on Universal History from which one learns more of the moral, religious, and political doctrine of the divine right of kings characteristic of the age of Louis XIV than of the history of empires since the Creation, with its alleged moral, religious, and political causes. Bossuet praised the Jews, the chosen people, and ignored the Mohammedans. The real motives for these contrary value-judgments are easily in- ferred from the historical relations of Bossuet and Voltaire to the Catholic Church, which in its seventeenth-century historiography regarded itself as fulfilling the predictions of the Hebrew prophets and as furnishing the sole bulwark of Europe against the invasion of the infidel Moors. Spinoza was one of the first of the moderns to refer to historical social and political motives in his interpreta- tion of the sacred historiography of his own people, who were not at the time too grateful to him for doing so.7 The critical history of such philosophies of history as Bossuet's and Voltaire's is indispensable for the history of human culture, since culture is the cumulative product of man's interests and as- pirations, and it is primarily man's interests and aspirations that are expressed in those philosophies of history whose truth-claims as to what they wished to indicate concerning history we have seen to be highly dubious. A distinction such as Russell makes between what statements "express " and what they "indicate' e 8 is methodo- logically indispensable for the philosophy of history as well as for value-theory. A false historical statement about past social or cul- 7 Yet Spinoza also illustrates the classical rationalistie view of his age which subordinated historical particulars to determination by invariant laws through his insistence that moral truths such as those discussed in Scripture can be more certain than those of empirical history and like the eternal truths of natural science can be established only by the deductive method of the Ethica ordine geometrico demonstrata.

A true statement does "indi- cate" objective values and may "express" subjective value-judg- ments or may refrain from such expressions. Organicism, which is best exemplified in the Hegelian logic, submerges historical particularity by erecting an ontology of eter- nal categories and dialectical laws that embrace and control all nature and all human activities, including the arts, sciences, social institutions, and cultures of different epochs. In this sense, among several conflicting ones, "organic logic" negates the dualism of classical rationalism in which historical particulars are at least dis- tinguishable from, even though they are taken to be ultimately de- pendent on, the universal laws of nature and mind. For the dia- lectical monism of the internality of all relations makes every fact dependent on every other fact so that there is no concrete deter- minate existence of historical particulars whether physical or cul- tural. The Marxian philosophy of history, in so far as it adheres to such a monistic-"monolithic" is the term preferred by hard- headed Marxists-ontology of dialectical pattern, shares with the Hegelian Weltgeistliche organicism an anti-historical character. Whatever claims both make to being "historical" systems are based on their exploitation of history as a source for illustrations of the inevitable march of dialectic toward a desired goal: the Prussian state or the classless society. In this treatment of history, not as a source or test of generalizations, but as a means of defending a particular political or cultural program, the organic view and classical rationalism 9 are both often characterized by the intrusion of normative considerations into descriptive generalizations of his- torical trends. Since this is not permissible in the natural sciences, we find organicism claiming that social and cultural phenomena must be approached from a "higher" standpoint than that of the "inferior" categories of particularity and quantity used in the method of empirical correlation. Now, "higher" can mean either (a) more comprehensive logically, or (b) more important ethically. It is incompatible with naturalistic empiricism to regard the do- main of social or cultural phenomena as more comprehensive logic- ally than the domain or laws of natural phenomena. Nor can the naturalistic empiricist permit ethical or political considerations to bias his objective description of historical events in the human world. The continuity of human thought and culture based on the 9 Cf. M. P. Gilmore, Argument from Roman Law in Political Thought, 1200-1600, Introduction (Harvard Univ. Press, 1941).</page><page sequence="13">METHODOLOGY IN PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 321 common elements of diverse societies of diverse epochs is lost in a second common and contrary sense of "organicism," namely, the view that cultures at different epochs and in different peoples or nations have absolutely individual peculiarities or idiosyncratic characteristics that are not historical products of previous social and cultural conditions, but appear only as outgrowths of a supra- historical "spirit of an age," or Volksgeist or national feeling or class-consciousness. This doctrine of the Etgentiimlichkeit of cul- tures was advanced mostly by the early nineteenth-century German romanticists (Herder, Schlegel, Fichte, Hegel), and was usually accompanied by the subordination of Naturwissenschaften to Geis- teswissenschaften. lhistorical continuity is lost in this view be- cause of its arbitrary isolation of ideas, cultures, or classes of so- ciety based on favoritism for one of these. Empirically eonsidered, no group or culture or idea in history is "higher" or "lower" than any other in sense (b) of ethical preference, since any preference is an individual act. Aceording to the organicist, all individuality is submerged in the organic whole, but apparently the leader of the state is an outstanding exception to this submergence of the individual act because in some inexplicable way, the leader in his acts embodies the spirit of the "whole." Nor could the empiricistic historian of thought discriminate the internal history of an institution, art, or science, as distinguished from the manifold external physical and social forces which affect that history, unless he abandoned the organic logic in which all relations are internal to an imperceptible whole. The only sort of imperceptible entity required in historiography is the logical variety of connecting term, such as continuity, which enables the historian to investigate correlations of events on the basis of a veri- fiable continuity in the relations of succession and similarity when these are reliably reported. The method of correlation needs to be cautiously used, since it is a well-known logical error to infer " causal " or "necessary " connection between phenomena solely because they occur together frequently. On the organic view of internal relations, it is a priori assumed that there must be a causal connection among all events, and in this view all correlations are as a consequence approximations of such ubiquitous determination. But since the consequence does not in fact hold, the organic view can not distinguish necessary from accidental concomitances or successions of phenomena. Whether a thoroughgoing rationalism can logically provide the requisite pluralistic assumptions for em- pirical inquiry into statistical correlations is dubious since the classi- cal tradition of rationalism has frowned upon chance as a vera causa and regarded statistical diversity as "unreal " or "merely</page><page sequence="14">322 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY subjective." The resultant status of the particular diversities of historical phenomena for classical rationalism has been that of im- perfect exemplification or of embodiments in successively graded emanations of more perfect eternal verities and ideas. On the other hand, historical events for the naturalistic empiricist are both the cumulative source and testing ground of ideas or theories about man, and written history is for him not an apologetic for the mun- dane failure of events to realize the ideal ends or alleged ultimate goal of all change. To use history as a source of hypotheses rather than to support dogmas about what ultimately underlies or shapes recurrent phe- nomena in man's social or cultural life requires logical clarity in the use of the terms with which we formulate our questions and hypotheses concerning such phenomena. For ambiguity in the terms used to designate the inferred characters of the phenomena in question makes it difficult to investigate the determinate exist- ence of such characters in any particular case. Consider, for ex- ample, the ambiguities that arise in the ubiquitous imputation of the "economic" factor to history.10 "Economic" may designate (a) man's biological or psychological needs, the former being much more constant than the latter; (b) the technological means (tools, machines, and any application of science) for the satisfaction of man's needs, this social factor being a variable dependent on the state of science in the society; (c) the material natural resources (physical, geographical, agronomic, etc.) of a society, which are the most constant features of human history, and yet vary with man's technological exploitation of them; (d) the relations of production, distribution, and consumption that depend on the property rela- tions or ownership and management of the means of production in a given society. To seek the "economic" antecedents of cultural or so-called "superstructural" phenomena is thus to seek for at least four distinguishable sorts of factors with all their complex inter- relationships. To assert the hypothesis that the "economic" factor is the primary or constant or necessary condition for all historical change is to assert ambiguously and often inconsistently that a group of conditions, some variable and some not so variable, forms a single set of invariable antecedents, or to assert the tautology that historical change means only the above-mentioned "economic" ways in which man sustains his life in society." 10 L. Feuer, " The Economic Factor in History, " Science and Society, Vol. IV (1940), pp. 168-192. 11 This four-fold equivocation in the use of the term "economic" by his- torical materialists was pointed out to me by Jerome Rosenthal whose unpub- lished manuscripts on the whole subject contain the most penetrating criticisms of this philosophy of history known to me.</page><page sequence="15">METHODOLOGY IN PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 323 To use the heterogeneous domain of human history as a testing ground for empirical generalizations requires not only a large num- ber of cases, but also verifiable hypotheses which connect them. Verification presupposes a pluralistic subject-matter, and logical rather than "organic" unity in its formal aspect. In social sci- ences, as in physical sciences, it is not a single hypothesis that is ever confirmed or eliminated by empirical verification, but a whole group of accepted theories which themselves change in the history of science, but which are tentatively accepted by the investigator in the course of testing a generalization concerning the characters being correlated.12 The natural sciences furnish the historian with continually revised premises concerning the verifiably recurrent conditions of man's physical, biological, and psychological behavior. Whence it is altogether natural and obligatory for history to be continually rewritten and for historical generalizations to be re- vised continually not only with each new discovery of fresh docu- ments, but also with the cumulative establishment of the new prem- ises furnished by the most recent scientific researches concerning man's physical, biological, and psychological behavior. It is only with the indispensable aid of the latter researches that the historian may improve the reliability and accuracy of his inferences of the relevant antecedents, which can "explain" the characters of the historical phenomena reported in the available documents and monuments of the past. It is true that such inferences from pres- ent researehes presuppose some continuity between the present and past laws or regularities of men's behavior, but such continuity of facts is logically presupposed in all explanation, and does not de- termine any specific characters of events. History has been more often rewritten in a less objective manner by historians who employ a set of contemporary value-judgments and delimit the principle of historical continuity by arbitrarily selecting evidence which will sustain and perpetuate these value-judgments. The "testimony of the ages " is a way of evading questions as to the specific his- torical determinants of a proposed course of action. Theories about the biological evolution of man-his natural his- tory-have not been fruitful when based on a priori speculations of the usefulness of certain traits or of the continuity of impercep- tible and eternal characters of the germ-plasm. They have, on the contrary, been clarifying when based on the experimental re- searches that throw light on the observable conditions of the produc- tion of mutations, and the statistical genetical laws concerning their breeding. So, it is hoped, our theories of the evolution of human 12 Cf. P. Duhem, La theorie physique, ch. VI, see. II; C. S.

The aim of naturalistic empiricism as a method of historical investigation is to achieve the same sort of objectivity and critical caution in human history as has been cumulatively achieved by natural scientists even though we can not hope to attain the same order of exactness or systematic generality.'8 PHILIP P. WIENER. COLLEGE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK. 13 The above is a slightly revised version of a paper read before the New York Philosophical Circle in November 1940. The author wishes to acknowl- edge his deep indebtedness to Arthur 0. Lovejoy for many stimulating criti- cisms, and to Jerome Rosenthal for the basic distinctions among the three types of methodology discussed above, but, of course, the author alone as- #sumes responsibility for the position taken.</page></plain_text>
