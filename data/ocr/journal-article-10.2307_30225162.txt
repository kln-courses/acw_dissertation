<plain_text><page sequence="1">Family Pattern, Critical Method, Narrative Model Denis Jonnes What structuralist theory brought to the study of narrative and dramatic form was a view of story-telling as a rule- or constraint-governed process. Structural theorists have argued that there exist patterns or procedures in- forming the multitude of texts we are prepared to call "stories," which once properly identified and arranged would constitute something in the nature of a system. Ideally, any such system, once postulated, would put us in a posi- tion to understand why it is we respond to some texts as stories and to others not; which is to say, would define a set of elements out of which or around which stories are generated. It would also provide us with a set of basic reference terms sufficiently discriminatory to account for differences among individual instances of story-telling without in the process letting us lose sight of how reference terms are themselves interrelated. In the view of those who have most zealously pursued codification of the story-telling process (in- cluding Barthes, Todorov, Genette and Kristeva), the notion of 'system' was generally taken as synonymous with linguistic system. Thus Roland Barthes, whose approach to story-telling presupposed a fundamental "identity be- tween language and literature," refers to "the story" as possessing the characteristics of "an extended sentence;' Gerard Genette explicates Proust's Remembrance of Things Past-in what becomes the basis for a more com- prehensive theory of narrative-as "the expansion of a verb," as consisting in its essence of an elaborate exercise in tense;2 Tzvetan Todorov in The Grammar of the Decameron affirms the existence of a "narrative grammar" predicated on three linguistic categories--"the proper name, the adjective and the verb"-- which Todorov then posits as a subfield within what he calls "'universal grammar.''3 But if a linguistically-based structuralism must be credited for much of the impetus behind story analysis over the past twenty years, there has also emerged a feeling among theorists, even those initially sympathetic to the structuralist project, that linguistics remains essentially inadequate to the task of explaining what it is that distinguishes story-telling from other orders of discourse. Narrative theorists have been skeptical about accounts of nar-</page><page sequence="2">Family Pattern, Critical Method, Narrative Model 13 rative structure which would reduce an extended set of utterances of the kind constitutive of story to the dimensions of a single "canonic sentence," which is to say, to the linguistic unit to which notions of syntax properly apply. In The Structural Analysis of Narrative, Jean Calloud has stated, with specific reference to story-telling, that text-analysis must be viewed as "autonomous from linguistics,"4 and Teun Van Dijk has asserted that "narrative structures are not characterized by a (linguistic) grammar of discourse, but are to be ac- counted for by a separate system of rules."' Jonathan Culler has likewise in- sisted that linguistics cannot provide firm foundations for narrative theory because "two versions of the same plot need have no sentences in common, nor need they, perhaps, have any linguistic deep structures in common."6 What critiques of linguistics-based method have in fact led to is renewed in- terest in traditional concepts generally associated with story-telling-above all, 'plot' and 'character'-; as when, for instance, Culler comes to speak of "an autonomous level of plot structure underlying actual linguistic manifestations."7 There has been a new appreciation of 'event' and 'action' as constituent elements of narrative structures, and renewed effort to under- stand what these terms mean in the framework of fictional story-telling. It is in this context, for example, that Robert Scholes will state that "only one kind of thing can be narrated; a time thing, or to use our normal word for it, an 'event';"8 and that Gerald Prince refers to "the ordering of events in time . . . as one of the most fundamental characteristics of any story." Prince goes on to define what he calls the "minimal story" as comprising "at least three events which not only occur at different times but also are causally related."10 This understanding of the centrality of the "event" to any defini- tion of story points at a further set of conditions related to 'ends,' 'purposes,' 'results' commonly educed as motivating or in some way generative of the event-chains specific to fictional story-telling. Claude Bremond, for instance, has suggested that the "elementary sequence" comprises three functions (or events), corresponding to "three obligatory phases of any process: a function which opens the process in the form of an act to be carried out; a function which achieves this virtuality in the form of an actual event; and a function which closes the process in the form of an attained result."" Scholes has also noted, however, that "any set of events that can be se- quenced and related can also be narrated" (as, for example, "stages in the growth of a plant or the progress of a disease"), and he has drawn a further critical distinction between "narrative" and "story"--the latter a term used in a highly restrictive sense.'2 Scholes makes the point that a proper story necessitates situations invested with "a certain level of human interest," which in fact assumes, in Scholes' view, that "stories" must actually involve "human beings." Scholes asserts that "virtually all stories are about human beings or humanoid creatures"-a point on which theorists have in fact reached a remarkable degree of consensus.'" By suggesting that stories are about "human beings," theorists imply that narrative structures consist of something more than simply "events arranged</page><page sequence="3">14 The Journal of Narrative Technique in temporal and causal sequences." They would seem, in fact, to be saying that the events around which stories are generated consist of actions, which is to say, events which can be described as or shown to be the consequence of specifically human intentions or desires. Bremond has made the point that "where there is no implied human interest . . . there can be no narrative ... for it is only in relation to a plan conceived by man that events gain mean- ing."'4 If, in other words, an event-chain is to possess those attributes which permit us to respond to it as a 'story,' the sequence must be seen to originate with or to be caused by 'human agents,' or, it must set in motion a chain of events which cause 'human beings' to respond or to act. Carrying the implications of this 'human factor' a step further, Bremond has noted that actions of the type constitutive of plot generally entail en- counters between at least one human being and one (or more) other human (or "anthropomorphic") beings. We ought, in other words, to speak more precisely of the event-chains of which stories are formed as sequences of in- teractions among human agents. William O. Hendricks has stated in this regard that "the fundamental purpose of plot is to interrelate the characters- especially to bring protagonist and antagonist together in situations where they each have an interest.""' Jean Calloud has likewise argued that "each happening is the creation of a relation," and that "something happens when an actor (or personage) is related to another actor."'6 In other words, the ac- tions of a character assume significance within a sequence-indeed, are to be regarded as the "units" of which sequences are composed-only to the extent that such actions are represented as in response to, or as intended to affect, the actions of another 'character.' While one should stress the extent to which 'actions' must be viewed as functions of encounters and confrontations between characters presented as discrete persons, one must also emphasize the degree to which the notion of 'interaction,' or a sequence of interactions, marks out a 'social context,' even if one defined only at the small or intimate-group level. This necessarily inter- personal dimension of story-telling must be at least in part the basis for any explanation of the communicability of narrative, and ultimately for the fact of what Barthes and others have referred to as the 'universality' of the story- telling phenomenon. Thus Bremond, in seeking to delineate those areas of 'experience,' or classes of interaction, susceptible to narrative treatment, has argued for a correspondence of "the elementary narrative types" with "the most general forms of human behavior." In specifying what sorts of behavior would be covered by these "general forms," Bremond himself has proposed a set of story-telling schemas centered on acts of competition and struggle. The interactions Bremond takes as central to fictional story-telling include "aggression," "intervention of an ally," "negotiation," "elimination of the adversary," "retribution,"-functions involving figures identified variously as "aggressor," "victim," "ally," and so forth." In spelling out what he takes to be the set of basic story-telling functions, Bremond, however, also argues for a view of stories as possessed of a power to reproduce whatever "the field</page><page sequence="4">Family Pattern, Critical Method, Narrative Model 15 of possible experience a priori" happens to cast up in the story-teller's mind or imagination.18 This is a broad claim (though not unlike those conven- tionally advanced in defense of the poetic imagination and its freedom to touch and elaborate on whatever 'subject' happens to inspire it)-and in fact, as Cesare Segre and others have suggested, ultimately too broad a claim.19 While Bremond's arguments represent a first important attempt to define those interactions around which story-telling is generated, I would suggest his categories are in fact posited at too high a level of generality and, at the same time, over too restricted a range of experience (that rooted in 'competition') to account for differences among individual instances of story-telling, among kinds of stories, or even for that matter between fictional stories and other kinds of narrative accounts (e.g. reports on an athletic competition, a war, a political or economic rivalry). Indeed, were we to adopt Bremond's view of stories as possessed of a power to range freely across the whole expanse of actual and possible human experience, there would seem to be little need to distingush between 'story' and other orders of discourse; anything which gives us an account of human experience would fall into the category of 'story.' If we are in a position to speak of anything like "the most general forms of human behavior" in connection with a story-telling-and I think the asser- tion of such a link provides us with a useful point of departure for any fur- ther reflection on which distinguishes story-telling from other modes of discourse-such forms must be those as are marked out by encounters, in- teractions, relations of a kind touching on the lives of all persons (but not necessarily encompassing the whole "field of possible experience a priori"). Given the full spectrum of possible encounters and relations, those meeting this condition of 'universality' represent, I would argue, a delimitable and semantically-bounded class of events. To put the matter in its simplest and bluntest form, I would argue that these are such actions and interactions as have to do with-or raise the prospect of-the birth or death of persons. This may seem at first glance simply to reduce stories to a record of the most basic of truths about human lives. Yet given the range of events and relations one can imagine human beings becoming involved with, these two "events" repre- sent an important preliminary constraint on the order of event around which story-telling sequences are generated. In a first elaboration of this thesis, I would see plot-significant actions as including those which have to do with, or raise the prospect of, sexual encounters, which is to say, such events as might result in the birth of a child. The question of sexuality implies (although of course does not necessitate) another sphere of relationship-namely, marriage-of fundamental significance across a broad range of story-telling. I would in fact take this line of argument a step further and assert that at the heart of the semantic universe upon which story-telling subsists are not, as myth critics have argued, "natural" or "cosmic" cycles of generation and decline, but something much more institutionally specifiable: a network of relations rooted in and radiating out from that complex of "interactions" we usually call the "family," which is to say, that social arrangement which grounded in mar-</page><page sequence="5">16 The Journal of Narrative Technique riage (whether officially sanctioned or not) presides over the birth and death of its members. What theorists refer to as the "narrative code" is, in other words, structured around a particular order of event rather than a 'linguistic system'-an order comprised of such relation-constitutive (or -disruptive) acts as 'falling-in-love,' 'courtship,' 'engagement,' 'marriage,' the founding of a home, the sexual act, pregnancy and parturition, the nurturing and matura- tion of the child within the family, the rituals of initiation and passage, in- cluding first sexual encounters, through which adolescents and young adults pass. The 'narrative code'-taken as implying a structural reciprocity between the verbal act of telling a story and a sphere of relations bound up with 'fami- ly'-would also include all the events associated with the darker side of family life; desertion, adultery, divorce, children running away or abducted, and such external events-war, economic crisis, natural disaster-depicted as having a deleterious or fatal effect on a family or its members. Into this latter category of event would fall the rituals, typically presided over by the family, surround- ing the deaths of persons; the burial and honoring of the dead, the bequeathal and inheritance of property, title and authority. The primary roles ascribed characters-namely, those regulating possible courses of narrative action- would also, in this view of story-telling, be defined 'familially': by the posi- tion of the character within a family unit (as 'mother,' 'father,' 'husband,' 'wife,' 'daughter,' 'son,' 'brother,' 'sister') or in proximity to families, as in the case of 'suitor,' 'fiance/e,' 'lover,' 'mistress.' And thus, too, sequences of action constitutive of standard plots would involve, or raise the possibility of, a character moving from one position to another within or in relation to a 'family.' Such shifts might entail movement away or out from the family, or the reconstitution of a threatened or disrupted family unit, which is to say, actions moving towards the recovery of a lost parent, child, sibling. Such actions might bring about the formation of a new family unit. Frequently stories dramatize the question of what it really means to be a 'father' or 'son,' 'mother' or 'daughter,' 'husband' or 'wife.' While any number of motives or causes may be adduced within a narrative to account for an action, while any range of material from any variety of discrete semantic fields (religion, science, ethics, politics, the natural world) can be incorporated into a story (as attributes of character, as setting), and while any range of attitudes can be taken towards the relations depicted (from most approving to the highly critical), I would suggest that these have meaning for a story to the extent that they bear upon core structures constituted of roles and sequences de- fined by the interaction of characters within and in the immediate proximity of families. The positing of a consistent link between story structures on the one side and codes regulating sexual-marital-family behavior on the other does not constitute as it stands a 'theory' of story-telling. If we were to explore the reciprocity of familial and story-telling structures on a more systematic basis, one way of proceeding might be to consider those areas of contemporary critical practice which have established 'sex,' 'marriage,' and 'family' as terms</page><page sequence="6">Family Pattern, Critical Method, Narrative Model 17 of reference, and do so across broad enough ranges of material to make generalizations and 'model-building' possible. Each of the three approaches to narrative considered briefly below-the psychoanalytic, the Proppian, the feminist-has evolved a specific understanding of what story-telling means and of how the 'elements' of story-telling are to be defined. Each has specified a particular set of critical moments or interactions, and particular configura- tions of characters-in each instance rooted in a distinctive understanding of the 'family'-as a core pattern in terms of which individual instances of story-telling can be coded and understood. In one sense, what these approaches bring to the reading of story are what Peter Brooks has called "master plots," schemas on the basis of which characters and sequences can be brought into conceptual focus. In their respective understandings of what sequences are properly constitutive of plot, each of these 'methods' is partial, but taken together they begin to give us a sense of that range of terms-the semantic field-out of which actual stories are constructed. Psychoanalytic Paradigm and the Plots of Childhood: In the case of psychoanalytic interpretation of narrative, the central concern is generally with childhood and the relations of children to parents. In practical, psychoanalytically-informed exegesis, the actions of a character are invariably referred back to a restricted constellation of dramatis personae-one pre- scribed by the nuclear family unit composed of father, mother and child-, and by a delimitable progression of events or interactions centered on the child's growth and maturation within the family. Moments of significance in plots which psychoanalytic criticism is adept at bringing into focus are those involving an infant's or child's attachment to the mother (the reference relation of all psychoanalytic discussion of story); the experience of disengag- ing from the mother; competition with others, above all with the father, for the mother's affection; retreat from the father; reconciliation; the search for substitute parents; and finally, identification with parental role models. Psychoanalytic approaches have been applied to the interpretation of all variety of stories in which erotic or libidinal relations are an issue, even those, of course, in which characters are not explicitly marked as 'children.' Generally, for psychoanalytic critics, the question of age is not so important as the nature of the relation: the degrees of hostility or affection felt by the child towards parents or parent surrogates. What I would suggest, though, is that psychoanalytic criticism in fact gravitates towards narratives in which younger figures, especially younger males, interact with older men and women marked as 'fathers' and 'mothers.' One might note that in Peter Brooks' recent discus- sions of novelistic plotting, attention is directed almost exclusively at texts in which the protagonist is marked as a young man, and more than simply 'young,' as a figure who fails in some fundamental sense to advance beyond the crisis of youth; one unable in other words to master his Oedipal longings in such a way that he can move into fully adult relations. But beyond the question of those relations to which psychoanalytic critics are especially at- tuned, I would suggest that the psychoanalytic model in fact presupposes the</page><page sequence="7">18 The Journal of Narrative Technique ultimate impossibility of passing out of the family-of-origin. To the extent that the novels which Brooks considers point to a lasting rejection of the father and a repudiation of any paternal ideal, they trace out what Brooks refers to as "deviant trajectories," life-courses leading away from 'normal' adulthood. As Brooks himself suggests, however, the psychoanalytic paradigm allows for no plot which is not ultimately 'deviant,' which does not finally attest to the "impossibility of escape from the originating scenarios of childhood."20 Noting that "repetition of all sorts is the very stuff on literary meanings, the basis of our creative perception of relations and interconnections,"21 Brooks asserts that in the story-telling text, repetition constitutes a return, a calling back, specifically to the configurations of infancy and early childhood. In accord with this view, Brooks-and in this respect his comments typify the psychoanalytic understanding of story-sees plots as always moving on two levels. On the one, we have a 'surface plot' which consists of an open-ended, forward-moving, linear progression towards maturity; on the other, we find a deeper-lying, "subterranean plot" comprising a series of returns to at- tachments experienced in childhood, above all to the mother, which continually interrupts and eventually subverts the linear plot. In exhibiting what Brooks calls a "repetition compulsion" and a return to the mother, the Stendhal and Dickens novels which Brooks subjects to scrutiny reveal a plot logic which does more than simply govern the composition of these particular works; it is a logic-a paradigm of relations-which comes in fact to define those con- figurations susceptible to narrative treatment and thus what-for a psychoanalytic critic-goes into the making of coherent or plausible story-telling. While I would see the psychoanalytic paradigm as well adapted to account- ing for relations between children and parents within the family, I would also argue that it offers too restricted a model of possible interactions within and around the family to provide a basis for any more general theorizing about the interrelation of family and narrative systems. Given its deeper-lying assumptions about personality formation (which need not immediately con- cern the narrative semanticist), psychoanalysis must ultimately discount any action or relation which cannot be referred back to the child's first experiences within a nuclear family configuration. Thus, in the psychoanalytic understand- ing of character, 'falling-in-love' is invariably a matter of displacement: of original attachments (to mother or father) onto substitutes, and marriage is little more than a question of the individual confirming his or her 'choice' of substitute. Even in marriage, in other words, the individual is never perceived as passing out of or beyond the family-of-origin. Once a character is marked in terms of the one family-the family-of-origin-he or she is fixed and can- not be redefined at any truly meaningful level in terms of a relationship to another person. Since story-tellers, I would argue, often speak from vantage points transcending the perspectives of any one character, or of any one par- ticular family, psychoanalytic approaches may in fact introduce distortions into the account of the story-telling process, and especially into the analysis</page><page sequence="8">Family Pattern, Critical Method, Narrative Model 19 of stories which do not focus exclusively, or explicitly, on childhood. Behind this criticism of psychoanalytic schemas lies a conviction that the story-telling 'code' gives the story-teller the freedom to situate characters across the whole spectrum of situations arising as persons enter into such relations as establish, preserve, extend or disrupt the family. From the perspective of what is required for the reproduction and preservation of the social group none of these situations necessarily takes precedence over any other. The obstacles which prevent a man and a women from coming together, or the crises which threaten an already established relationship, can generate as much interest from the story-telling point of view as those situations hindering the development and maturation of the child within the family. In postulating schemas which highlight the movement of persons between rather than within discrete family units, I would see Propp's Morphology of the Folktale as significantly expanding our sense of the sorts of interactions of which nar- ratable sequences can be composed. Propp's Morphology: Maturation and Marriage: In the synopsis of the Proppian model as sketched below, we again move across ground already covered by commentators. We would simply wish to pursue at somewhat greater length the question posed by Dundes in the introduction to the American edition of the Morphology: " ... does not the fact that Propp's last function is a wedding indicate that Russian fairy-tale structure has something to do with marriage?"22 In contrast to the psychoanalytic story model, in which events are understood in terms of patterns determined ex- clusively by childhood experience (and as a result of which, as we have sug- gested, notions of 'forward motion,' of movement out from and beyond the family, become problematic), Propp's sequences situate characters within con- figurations determined as much proleptically (by the marriage with which the tale concludes) as by its moment of inception, an "absentation" from "home." The trajectory traced by Propp's thirty-one functions stipulates an "initial situation" demanding "the presence of the members of a single family" (in narrative practice this may simply entail an "enumeration" of relevant fami- ly members), although, unlike the psychoanalytic model, Propp's does not specify any one axis within the family as determinative of the subsequent se- quence. The family is defined as a collective or institutional unit, and is usually depicted at the outset as in a harmonious state-a condition sometimes sug- gested by the wealth and well-being which the family enjoys. This initial state is disrupted, and the story proper set in motion, by the first of the functions, specified as "one of the members of the family absenting himself from home."23 Designated simply as "absentation," this function may significantly include the death of one or both parents. 'Absentation' creates a situation in which one of the principal characters, a 'victim,' is abducted by the 'villain,' a figure identified as one who "causes harm to a family member;" the abduction in turn prompting a third character, the 'hero,' (one who at the outset also "departs from home") to go out in</page><page sequence="9">20 The Journal of Narrative Technique search of the victim. In one important sense, the initial series of functions all have to do with the disruption and break-up of households and families. The subsequent chain-of-events involve the hero searching for and engaging in combat in an effort to recover the victim. Many of these middle-sequence functions focus on the hero proving his worthiness-the necessity of which becomes evident in the final series of functions which stipulate the return of the hero and rescued victim, often the daughter of a prince or king, to a place once again marked as 'home.' The final function, marked as mar- riage (typically between the princess-victim and hero-savior), would seem to indicate some correlation between safe-return and marriage (or the forma- tion of a new conjugal unit). Story action as a whole, in other words, moves between two critical events: the first defined in terms of the break-up of families; the second in terms of their reconstitution or reformation. In this sense, the initial abduction can be read in terms of a deeper-lying and perhaps inevitable pattern: the dissolution of the family-of-origin which is the condi- tion of maturation and of the founding of new families. The trials to which the hero is subjected test his worthiness not simply as a 'hero' (in the sense of a figure possessed of strength and cunning), but as a prospective mate. What Propp's model of story makes clear-here by way of contrast with the psychoanalytic paradigm-is the extent to which a narrative can treat the prob- lems of establishing new relations of intimacy drawn from two separate family spheres and moving into a third: that centered on the newly-joined couple. From the standpoint of a Proppian analysis none of these family spheres takes precedence over the other. The issue is rather always that of how relations among them are to be secured and maintained. Feminist Criticism and the Narrative of Domestic Commitment: The final paradigm I would see as contributing to our sense of the kinds of relations and interactions of which fictional plots are constructed is that not so much articulated as intimated by feminists. Feminist criticism over the past fifteen years, some of it influenced by family-oriented psychoanalytic understanding of narrative, has not produced anything so definitive as a model of narrative, in the sense that we can speak of the psychoanalytic and the Proppian methods as theory. I would suggest, however, that when feminist critics read and com- ment on narrative, it is with an eye to specific patterns of experience-those involving the individual's, especially a woman's experience, within marriage and the family, even, it should be noted, where feminist criticism is often by way of reaction against such patterns. I would in fact point to three related but distinct preoccupations of feminist analysis as of immediate relevance to the argument being presented here, concerns which again can usefully serve to distinguish among plot types and character configurations. These preoccupations-and the plot sequences to which they correspond-are those having to do with 'courtship,' 'marriage' and 'parenting' respectively. Focal points of feminist analysis of story center on the processes of looking for and over possible mates, along with the moment of 'decision' and the factors affecting it; the interactions between husband and wife constitutive or disrup-</page><page sequence="10">Family Pattern, Critical Method, Narrative Model 21 tive of marriage, and finally the bearing and raising of children-in other words, such relationships as have traditionally defined woman's adult roles. In contrast with the Proppian model, which has also to do with the move- ment into marriage (but which places more stress on the, as it were, 'roman- tic' stages preparatory to marriage proper), the feminist awareness of the role of marriage in story-telling comes out of a much deeper sense of what mar- riage and reproduction have traditionally meant for women. If feminist critics have been especially sensitive to the issues at stake in what I would call "suitor plots" (in which a women, usually young, encounters an array of men and is put in the position of having to make the 'correct' choice), it is out of an awareness of what that 'choice' has meant for the whole of a woman's subse- quent life. It might be noted that virtually all novels by nineteenth-century English women novelists fall into the category of "suitor novel," although suitor plots, like marriage or parenting plots, are not restricted to female perspectives. Samuel Richardson's Sir Charles Grandison, for example, can be regarded as a male version of the suitor novel. Conjugal or couple plots, focusing on the relation between husband and wife as a sentimental rather than procreative unit, involve sequences in which the preservation or desirability or genuineness of the relation is in one way or other at issue. Conjugal narratives may begin just before, with or directly after a wedding. Evelyn Hinz has made the point about such plots that mar- riage is "the situation that generates the complications . . . instead of being the means whereby complications are resolved."" Frequently, in couple nar- ratives we find the use of contrasting pairs; double and multiple-couple struc- tures are stock conventions within the principal comedic traditions, but are also heavily used in American television dramas, including, for example, Dallas. Into the category of conjugal narrative also fall the plots of marital infidelity. These include configurations of special prominence within the novel, Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina constituting two central instances,25 although of course such plots are not the exclusive preserve of novelists. Aeschylus' Agamemnon can be considered the great classical instance of a doubly-duplicitous configuration: the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis the central instance among the many stories of unkept faith within the Bible. "Parenting" plots, like childhood plots, have to do with children, but the action is slanted in such a way that we perceive the child in terms of its significance to the parent. Stories developed around parenting may entail a testing of the parent's capacity for responsible action, of how much affec- tion, understanding or care, the parent is able to bring a child. Such plots may raise the question of a parent's competence or capacity to support children and home. In contrast with childhood plots, which suggest the degree of the child's dependence on parent figures, parenting narratives will depict the dependencies of parents on their children-and frequently the reluctance of parents to acknowledge the maturity or independence of children. At the upper end of the parenting phase, we find stories about the failure or the collapse of parental authority or power-and stories in some more</page><page sequence="11">22 The Journal of Narrative Technique general sense about futility and powerlessness, about death and dying. Such plots are generally but not necessarily about older persons. In fact I would regard plots of this type as opening onto yet another category-what I would call "limit plots." Focal episodes in such stories may involve illness, the death- bed or a funeral. Such stories often revolve around issues of 'succession' or 'transmission'-the passing on of power, property or wealth to a younger per- son. The drawing-up or reading of a will, or a dispute over an inheritance, may mark critical moments in a limit sequence. Shakespeare's King Lear is the great canonic instance of a limit plot. Hemingway's novella, The Old Man and the Sea, about the final struggle of an aging fisherman, would also fall, I suggest, into this category. I would note that any plot, in fact, in which death is the overwhelming focus of the action-stories in which the attenua- tion and severing of life-sustaining relationships is the predominant motif- can be regarded as a limit narrative. I would suggest that preoccupation with death-as in Camus' The Plague, Celine's Voyage au bout de la Nuit, Mann's A Death in Venice, Faulkner's As ILay Dying, Miller's Death of a Salesman- has emerged as a dominant concern in twentieth-century fiction. What I have tried to suggest in the preceding remarks is the existence of six phases, or major areas of interaction, within and around "families" on the basis of which plots are conventionally structured. Thus, we find (1) "plots of childhood," (2) what I would call "transfer" or "transit plots" involving the movement, usually of younger persons out of one family into another, (3) "courtship plots," (4) "conjugal plots," (5) "parenting plots," and (6) "limit plots." While each of these represent discrete segments of experience involv- ing particular kinds of relationships, they should not be taken as represent- ing anything like fixed boundaries, or predetermined itineraries, but rather something more in the nature of relations which story-tellers work with and manipulate in a variety of ways so as to achieve any number of effects. While plots are generally constructed around the actions of a single, central figure, and while the notion of "phases," advancing as they do along a line from the earliest moments of life to maturity, suggest schemas predicated on the stages of growth and decline, a "life cycle" through which the individual passes, the significance of each stage (for a theory of narrative structure) is deter- mined in the end not by the biological age of the individual, but by the cen- tral figure's position within a network of intimate family relations. For the understanding of 'plot' such relations are never incidental and indeed, a "plot- able" state-of-affairs might be defined as one involving a sequence of changes in a configuration of persons marked by their position within and in prox- imity to "families." By way of a conclusion I would suggest that arguments for a structural reciprocity of story-telling and familial structures would have implications for other areas of narrative analysis, as well as for a theory of genres. It might be argued, for example, that tragic plots have in some fun- damental sense to do with the dissolution of families; comedy and comic plots with the formation, preservation or restoration of families. Whatever its poten- tial wider applications, what I would call 'family-pattern analysis' does, I</page><page sequence="12">Family Pattern, Critical Method, Narrative Model 23 believe, raise the question of how story-telling as a social practice is to be situated within any more broadly conceived matrix of institutions, and ultimately of how we can most effectively go about teaching and comment- ing on plot-structured texts.
