<plain_text><page sequence="1">The northern Horn of Africa in the first millennium BCE: local traditions and external connections Rodolfo Fattovich INTRODUCTION This paper is an attempt to suggest an analysis of the historical process that generated the earliest kingdom in Ethiopia and Eritrea in the 1st millennium BCE based on the present archaeological and textual evidence1. The northern Horn of Africa (present-day northern Ethiopia and Eritrea)2 was the core of the Ethio-Semitic Christian state, which progressively dominated most of the Horn of Africa in the 1st and 2nd millennia CE, and laid the foundation for the modern national states of Ethiopia and Eritrea (Marcus, 1994; Berhanou Abebe, 1998; Henze, 2000). This state arose from the Kingdom of Aksum (ca. 50 BCE - 650/700 CE), which was the main African commercial partner of the Roman and Byzantine Empires in the early to mid- 1st millennium CE and adopted 1 Historical processes can be defined as the sequence of transformations in the networks of interactions between: a) human groups and the physical environment; b) human groups and the biotic environment (animals and plants); c) different human groups; and d) members of a human group. Historical processes consist of a sequence of events, which depend on transformations in the social, economic and cognitive systems of a human group as a result of internal (e.g., cultural innovations; social stress) and/or external pressures (e.g., environmental fluctuations; economic and political changes in other regions; cultural influences from other regions), and reflect changes in the networks of ecological, economic, political, social and cultural interaction at different spatial and temporal scales (s. Fattovich, 1990c, in press). 2 Today northern Ethiopia corresponds to the Regional State of Tigray. In this paper I shall use Tigray Regional State to indicate the modern administrative region and only Tigray to indicate the traditional region corresponding approximately to the Central Zone of the modern regional state (s. Abduldaker Saleh, Hirt, Smidt and Tetzlaff, 2005, p. 353). 1</page><page sequence="2">RODOLFO FATTO VICH Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century CE (Munro-Hay, 1991; Fattovich, 2000, 2008; D. W. Phillipson, 2012). The Aksumite kingdom replaced an earlier literate polity, conventionally named "D'MT" ( Daamat/DV amat ) (ca. 900/800 - 400/300 BCE), which is characterized by several South Arabian cultural elements (Anfray, 1990, pp. 17-63; Fattovich, 1990a; Finneran, 2007, pp. 117-141; D. W. Phillipson, 2012, pp. 22-41). The origin, development, and nature of the "D'MT" polity as well as its relation to the later kingdom of Aksum are virtually unknown, as the archaeological record is very scant and textual sources provide only fragmentary and ambiguous information (D. W. Phillipson, 2009, 2012, pp. 22-41). Even the archaeological culture corresponding to this polity is elusive and debated (Fattovich, 1990a, 2009; D. W. Phillipson, 2009; Schmidt, 2009a)3. Only two monumental temples at Yeha in present-day central Tigray Regional State, seven sculptures and fifteen 'royal' inscriptions suggest that "D'MT" was a hierarchical society at a state scale of complexity (de Contenson, 1962, 1981; Anfray, 1990, pp. 17-52; Fattovich, 1977, 1990a). The meaning of the name (D'MT) is obscure too, as this name may indicate a tribe, a region or a specific place. At present, any interpretation of this evidence must be regarded as speculative and questionable (Fattovich, 2010; D. W. Phillipson, 2012, pp. 19-21). At the core of the scholarly debate about "D'MT" is the role of South Arabs in the formation of this complex society. The occurrence of nine sites in central Eritrea, eastern and central Tigray with evidence of monumental buildings and artefacts in a South Arabian style, as well as Sabaic inscriptions in South Arabian script (de Contenson, 1981; Anfray, 3 The period of development of D'MT and/or the corresponding archaeological culture are called the "Pre- Aksumite" Period/Culture in the literature (e.g., Anfray, 1968; Fattovich, 1977, 1990a; de Contenson, 1981). The term "Pre-Aksumite" has recently been questioned by several scholars with different motivations (D. W. Phillipson, 2009, 2012, pp. 19-21; Schmidt, 2009). In this paper, therefore, I avoided this term, tentatively replacing "Pre-Aksumite" with "D'MT polity" as a conventional label to indicate both the socio-political entity and the archaeological culture (s. Finneran, 2007, pp. 118-121), but I am well aware that this term is also not appropriate (s. D. W. Phillipson, 2012, p. 21). 2</page><page sequence="3">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE 1990, pp. 17-63; Fattovich, 1977, 1990a; Bernard, Drewes and Schneider, 1991tpp. 67-83; Finneran, 2007, pp. 117-141; D. W. Phillipson, 2012, pp. 24-32), has suggested two different interpretations. Scholars emphasizing the South Arabian elements claim that a South Arabian tribe migrated to the Tigrean highlands and/or Sabeans colonized the region and imposed their dominion on the indigenous people in the early to mid-lst millennium BCE (Bent, 1893, pp. 134-151; Glaser, 1895; Conti Rossini, 1928, pp. 99-101; Sergew Hable Selassie, 1972, pp. 26-34; Ullendorff, 1973, p. 47; Ricci, 1984; Japp, Gerlach, Hitgen and Schnelle, 2011; Gerlach, 20 12)4. Scholars stressing the local component (mainly pottery and lithics) of "D'MT" stress an indigenous origin of this polity, suggesting that local elite used South Arabian elements as symbols of power in the mid- 1st millennium BCE (Anfray, 1969; Schneider, 1976a; Fattovich, 1977, 1990a, 2004; J. Phillips, 2004; Curtis, 2008; Manzo, 2009). According to several scholars, a few South Arabs settled in the African highlands and spread elements of their culture among the local population (Anfray, 1994; Scheneider, 2003; Fattovich, 2010). Two scholars (Drewes, 1962; Schneider, 1976a) have suggested, on linguistic arguments, that the (hypothetical) earlier local hierarchical society could be ascribed to a Semitic population, apparently speaking an early form of Ge'ez (Ethiopie)5. Most linguists believe that a South Arabian migration to Africa is the most coherent explanation of the ethnogenesis of the Ethio-Semitic populations, which conforms to Semitic historical linguistics (Kitchen et al., 2009; Marrassini, 201 1)6. 4 Since the late 17th century (Ludolf, 1682, pp. 7-9), scholars assumed that the Abyssinians (i.e., the Ethio-Semitic people of the Christian kingdom) descended from a South Arabian tribe, the Habashat, which is recorded in a few Aksumite inscriptions of the 4th century BCE (Glaser, 1895; Conti Rossini, 1906; Ullendorff, 1973, p. 48). Today, scholars believe this was an African population (Fattovich, 2000; Müller, 2005). 5 For a general introduction to Ge'ez s. Weninger, 2005; Gragg, 2008. The opposite hypothesis of an origin of the Semitic languages in the Horn of Africa (Hudson, 1977, 2000) is usually rejected as it is not consistent with the well documented textual evidence of a diffusion of Semitic languages from the Near East to the south and 3</page><page sequence="4">RODOLFO FATTOVICH Ethiopian traditional sources point to an indigenous origin of the state, but emphasize a genealogical link with King Solomon through the Biblical episode of the Queen of Sheba (Fessah Giyorgis, 1987, pp. 1-5, 169-171; Raineri and Riva, 2008). A few sources record a very ancient migration of people from Yemen to the African highlands (Sergew Hable Sellassie, 1972, p. 34; Allaqa Tayya Gabra Maryam, 1987, pp. 19-26, 41, 77, 81). In my opinion, both hypotheses, of a South Arabian migration/colonisation or acculturation, are unsatisfactory. The former one is not supported by an archaeological record of sites with a dominant South Arabian material culture in the northern Horn of Africa, as could be expected in the case of a massive migration or colonization7. The latter hypothesis is not grounded on firm archaeological evidence of a late prehistoric chiefdom on the highlands (Fattovich, 1997a, 2012b). At present, I think that the emergence of "D'MT" was not such a crucial event in the history of Ethiopia and Eritrea, as scholars often believe in ascribing to the South Arabs a more incisive role in the formation of the Ethio-Semitic culture than they truly had (e.g., Berhanou Abebe, 1998, pp. 7-8). Most likely the rise of "D'MT" was an episode in a long-term process of social, economic and political transformations, which were stimulated by the progressive inclusion of the northern Horn of Africa into a macrö-scale network of interaction between the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean regions8. This process began in late west (Marrassini, 201 1). 7 My direct observation of the Rashayda in the Gash Delta in the 1980s demonstrated that these nomads, which migrated from Arabia to Eritrea and eastern Sudan in the 1 870s (Pollera, 1935, pp. 213-215), maintained most of their original material culture for over a century after their arrival in Africa. Actually, the northern Horn of Africa was located at the interface between two main exchange networks, which developed beginning in the 4th millennium BCE and merged into one trade circuit in Roman times: 1) a north-south network, connecting Egypt and the Mediterranean regions to the Horn of Africa, central Africa and southern Arabia along the Nile Valley, Red Sea and western Arabia; 2) an east-west network, connecting eastern Africa and southern Arabia to India across the Indian Ocean (Manzo, 1999; Groom, 2000; Plisson, 2005; Mitchell, 2005, pp. 67-97, 99-133; Tomber, 2008; Boivin, Blench and Fueller, 2009). The progressive inclusion of the region into these networks exposed local 4</page><page sequence="5">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE prehistoric times and culminated in the consolidation of maritime routes in the Erythraean Sea in Roman times. Thus, an appropriate analysis of "D'MT" polity requires an investigation of the development of this polity as part of a process of interaction between populations on the opposite sides of the southern Red Sea, in the context of the evolving long-distance interaction network between the Mediterranean region and countries facing the Indian Ocean in the 3rd - 1st millennia BCE (Fattovich 2000, 2006, 2010)9. This investigation must be conducted without any ideological prejudice about "colonial" and "post-colonial" archaeology (Schmidt, 2002, 2009b). In this paper I shall try to: 1) describe the social evolutionary background of "D'MT" hierarchical society; 2) outline the main aspects of the "D'MT" at the present state of research; 3) suggest a tentative interpretation of the origins and development of "D'MT" in light of earlier evidence. In the conclusions the hypothetical process which led to the rise of "D'MT" will be outlined and a possible agenda for future research will be suggested. The environmental features of the northern Horn of Africa will be considered, as these features were not just the scenery on a stage where populations to external influences, which could be either incorporated and adapted to indigenous cultural models, or rejected (s. e.g., Munro-Hay, 2003; Zanetti, 2003). 9 For the study of interaction in archaeology s. Parkinson and Galaty, 2009; Bauer and Agbe-Davies, 2010; Knappet, 2011. My methodology is based on the assumption that temporal trajectories of changes (i.e., processes) in the economic, social and political interaction networks in one or more regions can generate new trajectories of changes in the interaction networks of other regions over a more and more extended area. In turn, changes in a specific region generate local trajectories of socio-economic and cultural development, which stimulate further changes in other regions in a continuous sequence of transformational processes generating new processes at different spatial and temporal scales down to micro-scale social networks within single communities affecting the behaviour of single social actors. 5</page><page sequence="6">RODOLFO FATTO VICH human social actors were playing their games, but were incisive factors in forging the peopling of the region. ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND TO STATE FORMATION IN THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA The morphology and ecology of the northern Horn of Africa together with the occurrence of natural resources and environmental hazards greatly affected the social, economic and cultural history of the local populations (Fattovich, 1992, pp. 71-81; Finneran, 2007, pp. 1-16) (fig. 1). The morphology of the region is characterized by highlands deeply cut with gorges and valleys that caused the fragmentation of people into isolated communities occupying territories with well defined natural borders (Abul- Haggag, 1961; Mesfin Wolde Maryam, 1972; Turri and Sauro, 1974). The river valleys provided an access to the highlands and enabled human groups in the lowlands and highlands to interact with each other (Pollera, 1935) and with the people of the surrounding regions. The ecological diversity, characterized by arid or semiarid coastal plains, temperate highlands and semiarid lowlands (Mesfin Wolde Maryam, 1972), caused a major division between: 1) nomadic or seminomadic herders in the lowlands, and 2) sedentary farmers in the highlands (Brandt, 1984). The contiguity of different ecozones facilitated the emerging of a complex interaction network between local human groups, particularly for exchanging products between farmers and herders (Pollera, 1935). Fluctuations in rainfall due to changes in the monsoon regime (Bryson and Bryson, 2000) caused prolonged draughts, famine and epidemics, forcing people to migrate in search of more suitable regions (R. Pankhurst, 1988). At present, the climate is characterized by winter rains on the Red Sea coast and highlands, and more abundant summer rains in the highlands and western lowlands (Mesfin Wolde Maryam, 1972, pp. 61-66). Despite scant Holocene palaeoenvironmental evidence (Bard, Coltorti, DiBlasi, Dramis and Fattovich, 2000; Nyssen, Poessen, Moeyersons, Deckers, Haileand and Lang, 2004), research in central and northern Tigray points to three wetter periods: 1) ca. 2000 - 1500 BCE, 2) 500 BCE - 500 CE, and 3) 1000 - 1040 CE; and two dry episodes: 1) ca. 1500 - 500 BCE, and 2) 500 - 6</page><page sequence="7">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE 1000 CE (Brancaccio, Calderoni, Coltorti, Dramis and Berakhi Ogbaghebriel, 1997; Berakhi Ogbaghebriel, Brancaccio, Calderoni, Dramis and Mohamed Umer, 1998; Machado, Pérez-Gonzàles and Benito, 1998). The occurrence of natural resources, such as gold, copper, iron, obsidian, gums and aromatic resins (myrrh and frankincense), ebony, elephant ivory, and luxury pelts, in the northern highlands, western slopes of the highlands and western lowlands, as well as sea turtle shells from the coast and islands, caused the progressive inclusion of the region into the long- distance trade network between the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean regions (Fattovich, 1991, fig. 1; Manzo, 1999). SOCIAL EVOLUTIONARY BACKGROUND TO 'D'MT' In this section I shall try to outline: A) the cultural landscape of the northern Horn of Africa in the 3rd to 1st millennia BCE; B) changes in the patterns of interaction between local populations and surrounding ones at the interregional and regional scale; and C) the development of complex societies in the region in the 3rd - 1st millennia BCE. A) Cultural landscape, ca. 3000 BCE - 0 CE The cultural landscape of the northern Horn of Africa in the 3rd - 1st millennia BCE can be tentatively outlined based directly on archaeological evidence, and indirectly on iconographical and textual evidence, as well as linguistic evidence (D. W. Phillipson, 2012, pp. 9-17). On the whole, this evidence suggests that the peopling of the region in late prehistoric and early historical times is characterized by a basic dichotomy between 1) nomadic or semi-nomadic herders and agro-pastoral people in the western lowlands and the eastern and northern plateaus of Eritrea, and 2) sedentary farmers in the highlands of central Eritrea and northern Ethiopia (Fattovich, 2010). 1) The archaeological record Archaeological evidence mainly consists of rock drawings, pottery and lithics (Fattovich, 1990b, 2010; Finneran, 2007; Schmidt, Curtis and Zelalem Teka, 2008; L. Phillipson, 2009) (fig. 2). 7</page><page sequence="8">RODOLFO FATTOVICH Rock art Rock drawings suggest that longhorn cattle herders with possibly Afro- Arabian cultural traditions, most likely coming from eastern Ethiopia, occupied the eastern plateau in Eritrea, as far as the coastal plains at the border with present-day Sudan in the 2nd millennium BCE (Červiček, 1971) This evidence consists of rock drawings of cattle in the so-called "Dahthami" style (Graziosi, 1964a; Červiček, 1971, 1978-79; Calegari, 1999; but s. Durrani, 2005, p. 106). Longhorn and shorthorn cattle herders, apparently coming from the western lowlands, were moving along the western slopes of the highlands and the plateau as far as central Eritrea in the 2nd - 1st millennia BCE (Clark, 1976a, 1976b). They can be identified in the archaeological record by rock drawings of naturalistic or semi- naturalistic cattle and human figures in the so-called "Bushman" and "Iberic" styles, as well as very schematic figures including simple bull's heads (Graziosi, 1964a, 1964b; Červiček, 1976a, 1976b; Calegari, 1999)10. Ceramics The pottery evidence consists of five major indigenous ceramic traditions that can be distinguished (Fattovich, 2010)11: Atbai Ceramic Tradition, Sahel Ceramic Tradition, Hamasien Ceramic Tradition, Agame Ceramic Tradition, and Tigray Ceramic Tradition (fig. 3)12. 10 The chronology of the rock-art in the northern Horn of Africa is uncertain as rock pictures cannot be directly dated. In this paper I have used the tentative dates Červiček (1971) and Clark (1976a) suggested on a comparison between the styles of some cattle figures in Eritrea and in Nubia and the Sahara. Of course, these dates are approximate and must be considered as very preliminary. A ceramic tradition is defined here as a complex of technological and stylistic features, which point to a continuity through time in the manufacture of ceramics by a human group, suggesting persistence in the cultural identity of the group. Innovations in the fabrics and/or style of the vessels can possibly be used to distinguish different temporal phases in the development and/or local variants in the spatial distribution of each tradition (s. Fattovich, Marks and Abbas M. Ali, 1984, p. 178). 12 In this paper each tradition is indicated by local geographical names in order to make their spatial distribution immediately evident. I am aware that the traditional geographical names are no more used in the present administrative division of northern Ethiopia and Eritrea (s. D. W. Phillipson, 2012, pp. 5-6), but these names are still well understood and 8</page><page sequence="9">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE a) Atbai Ceramic Tradition 13 The Atbai Ceramic Tradition is characterized by scraping as a surface treatment and decoration of ovoid jars with pinched rims, and by the late 3rd millennium BCE rim-bands with impressed geometric motifs. This tradition can be ascribed to an indigenous population which occupied the western Eritrean-Sudanese lowlands from the 5th millennium BCE to the early 1st millennium CE and adopted a pastoral economy in the late 4th millennium BCE. The assemblages with ceramics ascribable to this tradition have been divided into five successive groups on the basis of specific technological and stylistic features of the vessels: Malawiya Group (ca. 5000 - 3800 BCE), Butana Group (ca. 3800 - 2700 BCE), Gash Group (ca. 2700 - 1500/1400 BCE), Jebel Mokram Group (ca. 1500/1400 - 800/700 BCE) and Hagiz Group (ca. 800/700 BCE - 300/400 CE) (Fattovich, Marks and Abbas M. Ali, 1984; Fattovich, Sadr and Vitagliano, 1988-1989; Sadr, 1991). These groups represent different phases of socio-economic development in the region from hunting/foraging with exploitation of fluvial and savannah resources (Malawiya Group) to hunting/foraging with incipient cultivation of cereals and domestication of cattle (Butana Group), pastoralism (Gash Group), agro-pastoralism (Jebel Mokram Group), and nomadism (Hagiz Group) (Marks and Sadr, 1988; Fattovich, 1991b, 1991c; Fattovich, Sadr and Vitagliano, 1988-1989; Sadr, 1991).14 These groups initially occupied the alluvial plains between the Atbara River and Gash Delta and later spread over the lowlands as far as the Barka Valley (Arkell, 1954; Fattovich, 1990b; Sadr, 1991; Brandt, Manzo and Perlingieri, 2008). used by local people (s. Abduldaker Saleh, Hirt, Smidt and Tetzlaff, 2005, pp. 352-354). 13 The Atbai region corresponds to the mountains to the east of the Nile from Egypt to the Barka Delta in eastern Sudan. This name was initially used to indicate the ceramic traditions of the Gash Delta and middle Atbara Valley because a British geographer, K. M. Barbour (1964) included the Kassala region into the southern Atbai (s. Fattovich, Marks and Abbas M. Ali, 1984, fig. 1; Sadr, 1991, pp. 25-26, fig. 3.1). 14 For a definition of pastoralim, agro-pastoralism and nomadism s. Cribb, 1991, pp. 17- 20; Sadr, 1991, pp. 2-6; Anfinset, 2010, pp. 81-92. 9</page><page sequence="10">RODOLFO FATTOVICH b) Sahel Ceramic Tradition 15 The Sahel Ceramic Tradition is represented by ceramics from the deepest strata at the site of Adulis, near the coast of the Gulf of Zula (Eritrea). Two levels have been distinguished: Adulis I, 8 m - 1 1 m deep, with a fine yellow or reddish ware, decorated with incised geometric motives; and Adulis II, 4 m - 8 m deep, with a coarse black polished ware, decorated with similar incised geometric motifs to those of Adulis I (Paribeni, 1908). This tradition can be ascribed to a sedentary community, which occupied the lower Haddas Valley from the 2nd to 1st millennia BCE, as can be inferred from the discovery of a few fragments similar in style to those from Adulis I in a late Middle Kingdom context (ca. 1800 - 1650 BCE) at Mersa/Wadi Gawasis on the Red Sea coast in Egypt (Bard and Fattovich, 2010a). c) Hamasien Ceramic Tradition 16 The Hamasien Ceramic Tradition is characterized by necked red jars with a rounded bottom and bowls decorated with rim-bands of incised triangles. This tradition is represented by several sites of the so-called "Ancient Ona Culture" (ca. 900 - 400 BCE) near Asmara and can be ascribed to communities with a mixed farming/herding economy (Tringali, 1965, 1981; Schmidt, Curtis and Zelalem Teka, 2008b; Schmidt, 2009a; Asmeret G. Mehari, 2008). At present, the Hamasien Ceramic Tradition is dated to the first half of the 1st millennium BCE, but most likely this tradition emerged in the 2nd millennium BCE, as fragments of jars similar in shape to those from the Ancient Ona were found at Mersa/Wadi Gawasis, where they are associated with late Middle Kingdom ceramics (ca. 1800 - 1650 BCE) (Fattovich and Bard, 2007). 13 Sahel is the traditional name of the coastal plain in Eritrea. Hamasien includes the highlands around Asmara (Abduldaker Saleh, Hirt, Smidt and Tetzlaff, 2005, p. 352). 10</page><page sequence="11">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE d) Agame Ceramic Tradition11 The Agame Ceramic Tradition is characterized by black or brown bowls decorated with rim-bands of incised triangles, sometime filled with a white or red paste, red-polished bowls, and black-topped bowls and jars from assemblages dated to the early 1st millennium BCE at Sobea and Mazber in present eastern Tigray Regional State and at Kaskase and Matara in present central Eritrea. This tradition can be ascribed to sedentary communities with a mixed farming/herding economy (Anfray, 1966; Fattovich, 1980, pp. 35-38; D'Andrea, Manzo, Harrower and Hawkins, 2008). e) Tigray Ceramic Tradition 18 The Tigray Ceramic Tradition is characterized by red-orange bowls and jars, sometimes decorated with punctuations and moulded clay strips, from several sites in the region of Aksum and Adwa, dating from the late 3rd to 1st millennia BCE (D. W. Phillipson, 1977a; Fattovich, 1980, pp. 39-41, 2009, 2010; Finneran, 2000a, 2000b, 2007, pp. 61-62; Michels, 2005). This tradition can be ascribed to communities with a mixed farming/herding subsistence economy. The Agame and Tigray traditions merged in the mid-lst millennium BCE, as can be inferred from the association of ceramics from both traditions in several sites in central Eritrea, eastern and central Tigray (Fattovich, 1980, pp. 61-63). This mixed tradition can provisionally be labelled " Yeha-Matara Ceramic Tradition " based on the names of the two most representative sites: Yeha in present-day central Tigray Regional 17 The Agame region includes the highlands in present eastern Tigray Regional State, but in the past it also included the western part of present central Eritrea (Abduldaker Saleh, Hirt, Smidt and Tetzlaff, 2005, p. 352; Yaqob Beyene, personal communication). 18 Tigray originally corresponded to the region surrounding Adwa and Aksum in present- day central Tigray Regional State (Abduldaker Saleh, Hirt, Smidt and Tetzlaff, 2005, p. 353). 11</page><page sequence="12">RODOLFO FATTOVICH State and Matara in central Eritrea (Fattovich, 1980). The occurrence of royal inscriptions recording "D'MT" in several sites suggests that these were the ceramics used within the territory of this polity (Fattovich, 1990a, 2009). In the late 1st millennium BCE the two ceramic traditions were again divided (Fattovich, 1980, p. 62). Ceramics in a different style appeared in the region of Aksum (Proto-Aksumite Ware) at this time (Fattovich and Bard, 1994, 2001), suggesting the rise in present-day central Tigray Regional State of a new tradition, which becomes typical of the Aksumite kingdom. The persistence, however, of the same fabrics of the earlier Tigray Ceramic Tradition points to a regional continuity in the manufacture of ceramics from late prehistoric times to the late 1st millennium CE (Fattovich, Bard, Petrassi and Pisano, 2000). Lithics Chipped stones are practically ubiquitous in the whole region, and only a limited analysis of these artefacts has been conducted so far. Most of these tools were produced with a microlithic technology related to African Later Stone Age techno-complexes (D. W. Phillipson, 2005, pp. 126-127; Fattovich, 2010). The present evidence confirms an association of specific ceramic traditions with different lithic traditions (D. W. Phillipson, 1977; Fattovich and Piperno, 1986; Zelalem Teka and Dawit Okubatsion, 2008; L. Phillipson, 2009, 2011; Brandt, 2010). A detailed analysis of the lithic assemblages associated with pottery of the Central Tigray Tradition points to at least four lithic industries in the surroundings of Aksum (L. Phillipson, 2009; 201 1), and suggests a network of local communities with their distinctive traditions, but sharing the same ceramics. 2) Textual and iconographie evidence Beginning in the mid-2nd millennium BCE, Egyptian and later Hellenistic textual and iconographie evidence also provides information about the peoples of this region (Fattovich, 1990b, 1996a). Egyptian sources recording the Land of Punt possibly provide indirect information about the northern Horn of Africa in the late 3rd to late 2nd 12</page><page sequence="13">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE millennia BCE (Espinel, 2011). The location of this region has been debated for a long time (Bard and Fattovich, 2007, pp. 17-23), but recent archaeological work at Mersa/Wadi Gawasis (Egypt) definitely supports a location in the northern Horn of Africa and possibly the Yemeni coastal regions (Bard and Fattovich, 2013; Manzo, 2012; see also Kitchen, 1982, 1993, 2004, 2007; Fattovich, 1991a; Espinel, 201 1)19. The reliefs and texts recording a naval expedition to Punt in the temple of Queen Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri in Upper Egypt (ca. 1473 - 1458 BCE) provide the most detailed description of this region (Naville, 1898; Sethe, 1905, 1961 4, pp. 323-354; Breasted, 1906, pp. 102-122; Millet, 1962; W. S. Smith, 1962). Punt was a mountainous region close to the sea, where dom palms grew and baboons were found. The inhabitants bred shorthorn cattle and lived in hemispherical huts. Longhorn cattle herders of a different ethnic group lived in the hinterland. The people of Punt are represented with skin tones in brown or black. The society was hierarchical, with a "king" and "queen" of equal status. New Kingdom sources also record the wrw (chiefs) of Punt, suggesting the existence of small-scale hierarchical societies in that region (Lorton, 1974, pp. 26-38, 60-68; Manzo, 1999, pp. 29, 35). This description is consistent with the occurrence of rock drawings of shorthorn cattle along the western slope of the highlands and longhorn cattle on the plateau in Eritrea (Graziosi, 1964b; Calegari, 1999), and suggests a location of Punt somewhere in the Mareb/Gash or Barka valleys as far as the western slope of central Eritrea in the mid-2nd millennium BCE. The name of the population ( Hbsty.w ) might correspond to that of the Habashat, who were incorporated into the Aksumite kingdom in the mid-lst millennium CE (Doresse, 1971, pp. 55-56), but this identification is questionable because of the very long temporal gap between the records of these populations (Müller, 2005). The representation of the "queen" with equal status of the "king" and her daughter possibly points to the relevant role of the matrilineal line in the transmission of power, such as in Napatan 19 Mersa/Wadi Gawasis was the harbour on the Red Sea, the Egyptians used in the Middle Kingdom to send seafaring expeditions to Punt (Bard and Fattovich, 2010b). 13</page><page sequence="14">RODOLFO FATTOVICH Nubia (1st millennium BCE) (Welsby, 1996, pp. 25-27) and other traditional sub-Saharan African kingdoms (Mayr, 1977, pp. 49-53). The different tone of the skin of the inhabitants possibly suggests a social division into reds and blacks, similar to the traditional one of people in Eritrea and Tigray (Pollera, 1935). A differrent picture emerges, however, from Hellenistic and Roman sources dating to the late 1st millennium BCE - early 1st millennium CE (Conti Rossini, 1928, pp. 54-64; Desanges, 1978). These sources suggest that populations with diverse subsistence economies inhabited the western lowlands and western slope of the highlands in the late 1st millennium BCE. These groups included the Ichtyophages (fish-eaters) along the Eritrean and Danakil coast as far as northern Somalia, who used tools made with the bones of antelopes and goats, wood and stone; the Kelontophages (turtle-eaters) located on the islands off the African coast; the Ethiopes Kynegetes, most likely located in the Barka Delta, nomads who consumed mainly milk and meat and used tools of bone, wood and stone; the Elephantomaches (Elephant-hunters), possibly settled along the slopes of the plateau in the hinterland of the Barka valley; the Asaches, elephant-hunters who most likely occupied the Rore region in northern Eritrea; and the Megabares, nomadic cattle herders who used rounded skin shields and iron maces, and were possibly located in the Gash Delta. This evidence suggests that the western lowlands and/or slopes of the highlands were occupied by cattle herders - and some of them were specialised in elephant hunting. Unfortunately, the archaeological record of these populations is practically nonexistent. Only a rock drawing of a person milking a cow from the upper Mareb/Gash Valley possibly corresponds to the description of the Ethiopes Kynegetes (Graziosi, 1964a, p. 97, fig. 5). 3) Linguistic evidence The spoken languages in the northern Horn of Africa in late prehistoric times are unknown, the earliest written evidence being a variant of Sabaic, which is recorded in the inscriptions of the "D'MT" hierarchical society in the 1st millennium BCE (Gragg, 2008). Scholars do not exclude, however, the possibility that a Semitic language close to Northern Semitic was 14</page><page sequence="15">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE already spoken - possibly as a common commercial language (see also Marrassini, 1985) - by one or more human groups in the region in the early 1st millennium BCE (Garbini, 1984, pp. 186-191; Blench, 2012). Possibly the Puntites (or some of them) in the Hatshepsut reliefs already spoke a Semitic language in the mid-2nd millennium BCE, as the name of the "king", Parehu, sounds Semitic, but not South Semitic (Conti Rossini, 1928, pp. 101; Kitchen, 2004, pp. 26-27)20. BÌ Evolving interaction networks, ca. 3000 BCE - 0 CE The human groups living in the northern Horn of Africa in the late 3rd- 1st millennia BCE were part of an intricate network of commercial, political and social interactions at different spatial and temporal scales, which greatly affected their socio-economic development (Manzo, 1998; Fattovich, 2006, 2010). This network consisted of three systems, which changed through time mainly as a consequence of geopolitical changes in the system of interaction between the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean regions: 1) a long-distance network connecting Egypt and the Levant to regions of the southern Red Sea (Manzo, 1999); 2) an interregional network connecting the northern Horn of Africa to southern Arabia (Fattovich, 1996b, 2012a); 3) a regional network connecting the local populations to each other (Fattovich, 2010). 1) Long-distance interaction network This interaction network stretched from Egypt and the Levant to the Horn of Africa and southern Arabia, and is characterized by shifts from land routes along Nile Valley, to maritime routes along the Red Sea in the 2nd millennium BCE, to land routes along the western Arabian Peninsula in the late 2nd to mid-lst millennium BCE, and then again to maritime routes along the Red Sea in the late 1st millennium BCE. 20 The labial consonant /p/ occurs in Northern Semitic and many native Ge'ez words, while in Southern Arabic and Arabic only /f/ is used (Gragg, 2008, p. 219). 15</page><page sequence="16">RODOLFO FATTOVICH The development of this network depended on the following: a) Progressive Egyptian economic and political expansion as far as the Horn of Africa and the Upper Nile in the 4th to 2nd millennia BCE (O'Connor, 1993; Manzo, 1999; Edwards, 2004). b) The rise of an indigenous kingdom in Upper Nubia (Kingdom of Kerma), which controlled the land routes from Egypt to African regions to the south in the late 3rd - mid-2nd millennia BCE (Bonnet, 1990; Edwards, 2004, pp. 75-101). c) Egyptian maritime trade with Punt along the Red Sea in order to bypass Kerma control of the land routes, mainly in the early to mid-2nd millennium BCE (Bard and Fattovich, 2013; Manzo, 2010, 2012). d) Egyptian dominion over Nubia and incorporation of Kerma into the Egyptian empire in the mid- to late 2nd millennium BCE (Edwards, 2004, pp. 101-111). e) Collapse of Egyptian dominion in Nubia and trade with Punt in the late 2nd millennium BCE, and development of a new Nubian kingdom (Kush) controlling the land routes in the 1st millennium BCE (Welsby, 1996). f) The emergence of the South Arabs as significant actors in the long- distance trade with the Levant in the late 2nd - early 1st millennia BCE, and the rise of kingdoms in south-western Arabia in the early 1st millennium BCE (Ricci, 1984; de Maigret, 1996). g) Possibly Phoenician, Greek and Persian maritime activity along the Red Sea in the early to mid-lst millennium BCE (Desanges, 1978, pp. 218- 241; De Romanis, 1996; Salles, 1996). h) Ptolemaic maritime activity in the Red Sea with the establishment of harbours along the African coast for the procurement of war elephants and gold in the late 1st millennium BCE (Desanges, 1978, pp. 242-305; Salles, 1996). i) Roman maritime trade to India in the 1st century BCE - 1st century CE (Desanges, 1978, pp. 305-366; De Romanis, 1996; Sidebotham, 1996, 2011; Tomber, 2008). Three main phases of development of this long-distance network can be distinguished. The first phase was dominated by Egyptian trade with Punt along the Nile Valley and Red Sea in the late 3rd to late 2nd millennia BCE The second phase was dominated by the expansion of South Arabian trade 16</page><page sequence="17">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE with the Levant, and possibly the sporadic, maritime activity of Phoenicians, Greeks and Persians from Egypt to the southern Red Sea in the late 2nd to late 1st millennium BCE21. The third phase was dominated by the Roman maritime trade to the Indian Ocean in the late 1st millennium BCE - early 1st millennium CE. The archaeological evidence from the northern Horn of Africa points to (Manzo, 1999; Fattovich, 2006): a) Inclusion of the Gash Group people in the Gash Delta (Kassala) in an interaction network with Nubia and Egypt in the late 3rd to mid-2nd millennia BCE (Fattovich, 1991b; Fattovich, Sadr and Vitagliano, 1988-1989; Manzo, 1997, 1999). b) Inclusion of coastal peoples in Eritrea in Egyptian maritime trade in the early to mid^™1 millennium BCE (Fattovich, 1996a; Fattovich and Bard, 2013). c) Penetration of nomads from the Eastern Desert into the western Eritrean-Sudanese lowlands, most likely as a consequence of the Egyptian conquest of Nubia in the millennium BCE (Fattovich, Sadr and Vitagliano, 1988-1989)22. d) Progressive isolation of the Gash Delta from the network of interaction with Nubia, and more direct interaction of Jebel Mokram Group people in the Barka Valley with Nubia in the mid- to late 2nd millennium BCE (Fattovich, 2010). e) Progressive inclusion of the highlands in Eritrea and Tigray in the South Arabian area of commercial influence in the early 1st millennium BCE (Fattovich, 2004, 2010). f) Inclusion of the northern Horn of Africa in the Roman trade network in the late 1st millennium BCE - early 1st millennium CE (Manzo, 1998; Fattovich, 2008; D. W. Phillipson, 2012). 21 This activity might explain a few Phoenician, Greek and Persian influences in the art of D'MT (s. de Contenson, 1962, 1981; Pirenne, 1967). 22 This penetration can be inferred from the occurrence of ceramics in the general style of Middle Nubian Ware in the assemblages of the Jebel Mokram Group, where they are a major component of the pottery assemblages (Fattovich, Sadr and Vitagliano, 1988-1989; Fattovich 1991b; Sadr 1991). 17</page><page sequence="18">RODOLFO FATTOVICH 2) Interregional interaction network Most likely, an interaction network between south-western Arabia and the northern Horn of Africa emerged in the 4th - 3rd millennia BCE and consolidated in the late 2nd to mid- 1st millennia BCE (Zarins, 1989, 1990; Fattovich, 1996b, 2004, 2012a; Manzo, 1999, pp. 48-55; Durrani, 2005; Vogt and Buffa, 2005; Buffa, 2007, pp. 261-271; Khalidi, 2007, 2009). The factual evidence, however, is very scant (cf. Durrani, 2005). The evidence from the northern Horn of Africa includes: 1) One fragment of a bowl with wavy impressed decoration along the rim, similar in style to ceramics of the Khawlan Culture (ca. 2900 - 1800 BCE), from an Early Gash Group context (ca. 2700 - 2300 BCE) at Mahal Teglinos in the Gash Delta (Fattovich, 1991a, figs. 5/1; Buffa, 2007, p. 287, fig. 81). 2) One fragment of a vessel decorated with horizontal roulette impressed bands over the whole body, similar in style to ceramics of the Khawlan Culture, from a Classic Gash Group context (ca. 1900 - 1700 BCE) at Mahal Teglinos (Fattovich, 1991a, fig. 5/5; Buffa, 2007, fig. 41/7). 3) Several fragments of shallow bowls decorated on the inside with burnished lines, comparable to ceramics of the Malayba Phase of the Sabir Culture (in particular sub-phase 1C, ca. 1600 - 1300 BCE), from terminal Late Gash Group assemblages (ca. 1400 BCE) at Mahal Teglinos (cf. Buffa, 2007, pl. 63, 64). 3) Three body-shards decorated with horizontal bands of impressed dots, similar in style to ceramics of the Sabir Phase (ca. 1300 - 900/800 BCE) of the Sabir Culture in Yemen (Buffa, 2007, p. 200, fig. 32/3), from a Late Gash Group context (1700 - 1500/1400 BCE) at Mahal Teglinos (Fattovich, 1991a, fig. 5/4; Manzo, 1997, pl. 4B)23. 4) Several fragments of jars with an ellipsoidal handle and bowls with a high ring-foot, similar in shape to jars of the Sabir phase (ca. 1300 - 900/800 BCE), from the lowest strata at Matara (Anfray, 1966, p. 14, pl. XLVII, XLVIII; Buffa, 2007, 80/1). 23 These fragments are earlier than the Sabir ceramics. 18</page><page sequence="19">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE 5) Jars in the shape of a tulip, biconical bowls, and open bowls with a flat base and horizontal handles, similar in shape to ceramics of the Sabir phase at Sabir and Sihi (Buffa, 2007, p. 266, fig. 80), from Kaskase (Tringali, 1978, figs. 4, 7). 6) Large basins with a rounded bottom, similar in shape to specimens of the Sabir phase at Sabir and Sihi (Buffa, 2007, p. 266, fig. 80), from Sembel Cuscet near Asmara (Ancient Ona Culture) (Tringali, 1978, fig.23c). 7) Several fragments of bowls or jars with a ring-foot from the lower strata at Yeha (Tigray), similar in shape to ceramics from Yemen, particularly Saba (Robin and de Maigret, 1998, p. 778; Fattovich, 2009). Evidence of possible contacts of African regions with south-western Arabia includes (Buffa, 2007, pp. 261-267): 1) African obsidian knapped tools from several coastal sites in Yemen dating to the 3rd- 2nd millennia BC (Khalidi, 2007, 2009). 2) Several fragments of black bowls and pots with a rounded base and geometrical decorations (mainly triangles along the rim and vertical lines on the body) from Sihi (Saudi Arabia), similar in style to ceramics from the deepest strata at Adulis, (Zarins and Zaharani, 1985, p. 85; Buffa, 2007, pp. 199-200, 266; Paribeni, 1908, pp. 446-451, pl. III, V, VII)24. 3) A clay "bull's head" figurine from Sabir (Aden), similar to stone figurines from sites of the Ancient Ona Culture (Buffa and Vogt. 2001, fig. 3.3; Tringali, 1978, figs. 13-22; Schmidt andNaty, 2008). 3) A few potsherds with geometric motifs, comparable in style to ceramics of the Jebel Mokram Group (ca. 1500/1400 - 800/700 BC) from Sabir (Buffa, 2007, p. 266, fig. 79). 4) Very schematic anthropomorphic (?) rock-drawings comparable to a typical decorative motif found on ceramics at Adulis, from al-Mastör in the Yemeni Tihāmah (Keall, 2005, pp. 346-347, fig. 5.2; Paribeni, 1908, pl.V). 24 The black ware from Sihi can also be compared to C-Group and/or Kerma ware in Nubia (Zarins and Zaharani, 1985, p. 85), or the Middle Nubian Ware of eastern Sudan, where rim-bands of triangles are very common (Manzo, personal communication, September 201 1). 19</page><page sequence="20">RODOLFO FATTOVICH This evidence might suggest (Fattovich, 2012a): a) The development of an interaction network characterized by a diffusion of the obsidian knapped tools from the African coast to the Yemeni coast in the 4th to 2nd millennia BCE25. b) The existence of a network of indirect interactions between regions as far as the Gash Delta (Kassala) to the west and the highlands in Yemen to the east, most likely including the highlands in Eritrea and Tigray, in the late 3rd to early 2nd millennia BCE. c) The existence of an interaction network stretching from the Saudi and Yemeni coasts to the Eritrean coast and western lowlands in the mid- 2nd to early 1 st millennia BCE. d) The inclusion of the highlands in central Eritrea and around Asmara in an interaction network with the Yemeni coastal regions in the late 2nd - early 1st millennium BCE. e) More direct inclusion of present-day central Tigray Regional State in an interaction network with the Yemeni highlands (particularly Saba) in the early 1st millennium BCE. 3) Regional interaction network An interaction network between different human groups in the northern Horn of Africa certainly existed in the 2nd - 1st millennia BCE, but evidence for this is still scant. Interactions between groups in the western lowlands and those in the highlands in the 2nd - early 1st millennia BCE might be suggested by the occurrence of: a) Ceramics reminiscent of those of the Gash Group, from assemblages dated to the 2nd - early 1st millennia BCE in Agame (present-day eastern Tigray Regional State) (D'Andrea, Manzo, Harrower and Hawkins, 2008), Temben (present-day central Tigray Regional State) (Agazi Negash, 25 The capability of African coastal peoples to navigate in the Red Sea at this time is demonstrated by an obsidian microlithic industry of the Early - Middle Holocene on the island of Dahlac Kebir (Blanc, 1955). The obsidian tools from the Yemeni coast might be a by-product of a trade in other products, such as, e.g., salt or honey from Africa to Arabia. 20</page><page sequence="21">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE 1997a, 1997b, 2001, figs. 3.26, 3.27, 3.28) and Enderta (present-day south- eastern Tigray Regional State) (Barnett, 1999, 137). b) Fragments similar in style to those of the Jebel Mokram Group, from the largest site of Ancient Ona Culture at Sembel Cushet, near Asmara (Tringali, 1978-1979, fig. 24c). c) Potsherds similar in style to those of the Hamasien Ceramic Tradition, from a Jebel Mokram Group assemblage at Agordat in the Barka Valley (Brandt, Manzo and Perlingieri, 2008). d) Fragments of red-orange ware (Tigray Ceramic Tradition), from assemblages of the late Jebel Mokram Group in the Gash Delta (Fattovich, 1989). Interactions between the people* at Adulis and those of the Eritrean highlands in the 1st millennium BCE are suggested by: a) Anthropomorphic figures incised on the ceramics of Adulis II, which are similar to figures which are carved in a cave at Daaro Caulos in Hamasien (see Paribeni, 1908, pl. V; Fattovich, 1983). b) Vessels with similar geometric rim-bands in the lower strata at Adulis and Matara in central Eritrea (Fattovich, 1980, p. 69). Interaction between the people of Hamasien and those of central Eritrea and central Tigray Regional State in the early to mid-lst millennium BCE is suggested by the occurrence of ceramics similar in style to those of the Hamasien Ceramic Tradition in assemblages with ceramics of the Agame Tradition, as well as the Yeha-Matara Tradition (Fattovich, 1990a). Finally, the emergence of the Yeha-Matara Ceramic Tradition points to intense interaction between the people of central Eritrea and eastern and central Tigray Regional State in early to mid-lst millennium BCE. The split of this tradition in the late 1st millennium BCE suggests that the earlier interaction network collapsed at this time (Fattovich, 1980, pp. 61- 63, 2009, 2010). This evidence might suggest: a) Seasonal movements of pastoral (Gash Group) and agro-pastoral (Jebel Mokram Group) tribes from the western lowlands to the highlands in eastern and central Tigray Regional State beginning at least in the mid- 21</page><page sequence="22">RODOLFO FATTOVICH 2nd millennium BCE. The same type of small funerary stelae in the Gash Delta (Kassala) and Aqiq on the Red Sea Coast26, as well as cowry shells from the Red Sea in burials of the late Gash Group at Kassala, suggest seasonal movements of Gash Group people from the Gash River to the Red Sea coast (Fattovich, 2007, 2012a). b) Interaction between the late Jebel Mokram Group people in the Gash Delta and those in central Tigray Regional State in the early 1st millennium BCE. At this time the Jebel Mokram Group settlements were much smaller in size and number, suggesting a decline of the population in the alluvial plains between the Gash and Atbara rivers (Fattovich, Sadr and Vitagliano, 1988-1989; Sadr, 1991). c) The establishment of a caravan route from the Barka Delta to the Hamasien in the late 2nd - early 1st millennia BCE27. Other routes most likely connected the highlands to the Afar Depression to the southeast and were used for the trade of salt from the lowlands to the plateau beginning in late prehistoric times or earlier (R. Pankhurst, 1997, p. 25), but to date no archaeological evidence of them has been found. d) The emergence of a homogeneous interaction network, stretching from central Eritrea to the Tekkezè river in central Tigray Regional State in the early to mid- 1st millennium BCE. In particular, two distinct networks were apparently active in the early 1st millennium BCE: a) An eastern network, which included the sedentary communities in present-day eastern Tigray Regional State and central Eritrea with ceramics of the Agame Tradition, communities with ceramics of the Hamasien Tradition in Hamasien (Ancient Ona culture), and pastoral peoples in the Barka Valley (Jebel Mokram Group). b) A western interaction network between the communities in central Tigray and pastoral people in the Gash Delta (Jebel Mokram Group). 26 Aqiq is located about 70 km to the south of Suakin and 40 km to the north of the Eritrean-Sudanese border (Fattovich, 2007). 27 In the mid-2lxi millennium CE the traditional route from the highlands to lowlands connected Asmara in Hamasien to Keren in the Rore region (northern Eritrea) and Addigrat in the Barka Valley (Crawford, 1958). 22</page><page sequence="23">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE At present, the mechanisms of these interactions are unknown in the absence of a sufficient number of excavated sites. In my opinion, however, the ethnographic and ethno-historical record of the 19th and early 20th centuries CE provides some information from which a model of these interactions can be generated28. In traditional society the interactions between the different groups were mainly based on cooperation, mutualism and prédation29. Markets were crucial in the cooperative system of interaction, as they were centres for exchanges at the local and regional scales. Their location depended on the religious and/or political significance of the place, rather than functional requirements. Markets in the highlands were located at the centre of a grid of settlements ca. 10-20 km to 30-40 km away - the distance that farmers could cover in one day. Markets were usually located in large villages with a church or the residence of a chief (s. Mesfin Wolde Maryam, 1972; Turri and Sauro, 1974). The markets of pastoral and agro- pastoral groups, such as the Beni Amer in northern Eritrea, were usually located in the residential settlement of the tribal chief. Mixed hoe farmers, such as Kunama and Nera, in the western lowlands had only one major market, which was frequented by merchants coming from different regions (Muzinger, 1890; Pollera, 1913, 1935). Mutual interaction was practiced between the Semitic-speaking mixed farmers of the plateau and the Cushitic-speaking herders of the eastern slopes. In particular, the Irob herders provided the Tigrean farmers with the care of their livestock (Pollera, 1935). 28 We must take into account that the traditional structure of the peopling in the northern Horn of Africa emerged in the early 2nd millennium CE and consolidated in the 16th - 18th centuries CE, although some populations had already settled in this region since the 1st millennium CE or earlier (Conti Rossini, 1928, 1937; Pollera, 1935; Grottanelli, 1943; Fattovich, 1994). 29 Cooperation is based on an exchange network between the members of the single groups and between different groups. Mutualism is characterized by a client relationship between the members of two groups with different subsistence economies (e.g., herders and farmers). Prédation is practiced through the exploitation of one group by another one (s. Hardesty, 1977, pp. 143-160). 23</page><page sequence="24">RODOLFO FATTOVICH Prédation is well documented at least since the late 1st millennium CE, and until the 19th century consisted of raids by the Semitic-speaking mixed farmers of the highlands against the Nilo-Sahelian populations (Kunama and Nera) of the western lowlands to obtain slaves and cattle (Munzinger, 1890; Pollera, 1913). The seasonal movements of pastoral and agro-pastoral groups from the lowlands to the highlands and back to the lowlands were a significant component of the regional interaction network. These groups were moving between two main residential villages of the chiefs surrounded by small camps for grazing at the terminals of the transhumance routes. Some tribes, such as, e.g. the Beni Amer, had a large settlement where the chief and the elite permanently resided. This settlement could be relocated for political reasons (Pollera, 1935; Nadel, 1945). Conforming to this ethnographic and ethno-historical evidence, the largest Gash Group site at Mahal Teglinos (Kassala) might have been the residential settlement of a tribal chief and a market, possibly under the protection of ancestors, because several administrative devices, exotic potsherds and two cemeteries with funerary stelae for ritual offerings were found at this site (Fattovich, 1993). In the mid-2nd millennium BCE another large site ascribable to the Jebel Mokram Group at Jebel Abu Gamal, ca. 20 km to the south of Mahal Teglinos, might have been the residential settlement of a chief because of its central location in a grid of smaller villages, compounds and grazing camps (Fattovich, Sadr and Vitagliano, 1988-1989; Sadr, 1991). At this time other large residential sites ascribable to the late Gash Group and Jebel Mokram Group were located near Agordat in the Barka valley, and might also have been the residential settlements of local chiefs (Arkell, 1954). The largest site of the Ancient Ona Culture at Sembel Kushet (Asmara) may have been a market because of the occurrence of administrative devices at this site (Tringali, 2001). Yeha in central Tigray most likely was a significant ceremonial centre and the residence of chiefs, and possibly a major market as well, within the "D'MT" polity because of the two impressive temples in South Arábian 24</page><page sequence="25">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE style and an elite cemetery located at this site (Anfray, 1990, pp. 17-33; D. W. Phillipson, 2012, pp. 24-29). CÌ Social inequality The archaeological evidence suggests that human groups with societies at different levels of inequality and political organization, ranging from rank societies, most likely at a chiefdom scale of hierarchy30, to possibly an early state31, occupied the northern Horn of Africa in the 3rd - 1st millennia BCE (Fattovich, 2010). The earliest evidence of a small-scale chiefdom in the northern Horn of Africa can possibly be identified in the archaeological record with the Gash Group (ca. 2700 - 1500/1400 BCE) in the Gash Delta, as can be inferred from the clear cut, site-size settlement hierarchy and the occurrence of administrative devices. Most likely, this society was based on a lineage system and relied on a pastoral subsistence economy (Sadr, 1991; Fattovich, 1995; Gauthier and van der Neer, 2006). Beginning in the mid-2nd millennium BCE, the Gash Group was replaced by an agro-pastoral society, which is identified in the archaeological record as the Jebel Mokram Group (ca. 1500/1400 - 800/700 BCE) (Fattovich, Sadr and Vitagliano, 1988-89; Sadr, 1991). A clear cut, site-size settlement hierarchy and the occurrence of administrative devices at a few sites between the Gash and Atbara rivers (Sadr, 1991; Manzo, personal communication, June 2012) suggest that a rank society at a chiefdom scale of complexity occupied the lowlands up to the early 1st millennium BCE. Perhaps interaction between nomads from the Eastern Desert and the local people in this region resulted in a more hierarchical form of social organization, with foreign pastoral elite and local subjects, such as the traditional one of Tigrè-speaking tribes in northern Eritrea (see Pollera, 1935). To date, no certain evidence of an earlier complex society than the "D'MT" polity has been recorded in the highlands of Eritrea and Tigray. 30 For a definition of chiefdom s. Johnson and Earle, 2000, pp. 265-303. 31 For a definition of Early State s. Khazanov, 1978. 25</page><page sequence="26">RODOLFO FATTOVICH The occurrence of four huge monoliths at Kaskase possibly suggests the existence of a form of social inequality at central Eritrea in the early 1st millennium BCE32. On the basis of ethnographic evidence, however, these monoliths could be ascribed to a society with leaders whose prestige was based on their personal achievements, rather than a true chiefdom (see Flannery and Marcus, 2012, pp. 104-109). A rank society, possibly that of a simple chiefdom scale of complexity, developed in Hamasien in the mid- 1st millennium BCE, as can be inferred from the settlement pattern, administrative devices and one elite grave of the so-called Ancient Ona Culture (ca. 900 - 400 BC) (Schmidt and Curtis, 2001; Yusuf Libseqal, 2005; Schmidt, Curtis and Zelalem Teka, 2008b; Schmidt, 2009a; Tringali, 2001). Monumental architecture, sculpture, administrative devices, and inscriptions point to the rise of a complex chiefdom or early state (D'MT) in central Eritrea and eastern and central Tigray in early to mid- 1st millennium BCE (Anfray, 1990; Fattovich, 1990a, 2004, 2010; Michels, 2005; Finneran, 2007). Most of the recorded evidence fits well with the characteristics of a rank society: the stone sculpture and votive altars could represent the display of wealthy high-ranking chiefs and elite. The construction of temples, however, suggests a state scale of social and political organization (Flannery and Marcus, 2012, pp. 229-250). Several inscriptions record the names of kings; a division of the population into two main groups, the Reds and the Blacks; and a prominent role of the queen, with a matrilineal genealogy of the king (Drewes, 1962; Schneider, 1973, 1976; Durrani, 2005, pp. 123-124; Gerlach, 2012). A few inscriptions record the Sabean title 'mukarib', but the correct meaning of this title is debated (Schneider, 2003; D. W. Phillipson, 2009)33. 32 These monoliths are usually described as South Arabian pillars (e.g., Manzo, 1999b; Curtis and Daniel Habtamichael, 2008). A personal inspection of the monoliths by the South Arabist J.-F. Breton and myself in June 2005 demonstrated that they are neither typically South Arabian nor Aksumite in style and might represent a different cultural tradition. 33 According to several scholars ' mukarib ' in the Sabean context might be interpreted as 'federator' or a person in charge of unifying groups of people (s. Breton, 2000, p. 33). If this interpretation is correct, this title can be interpreted in the African context as something 26</page><page sequence="27">ai a&gt; 0 1 X/l a&gt; Ì tí .g O tí #o "3 'u yi *3 'I cd 0 1 0 1 ffi I i z ▼H W) E</page><page sequence="28">Fig. 2 Northern Horn of Africa, traditional regions and archaeological sites. / / RORE ' ' &gt; / RORE ' " -'l &amp; ' ' SOUTHERN ATBAI j Mawmwk ' * ' ° M ■ , I ¿Agorà* ^--TN. •• ^ Kassala rA Teatmos M / HAMASIEN Arqlqo ' ^ ^ ° f SefrMŁ L x *«*. r* &lt;7 *7 a / I i V BUR ¿o f ' S/ /' ļ Addi Qayeh A ^ito / 1 / '- ļ ¿kKaskase 'L « / ' SERAE f^Aňůi M«t»r«A F«łr« I *Sot»i 1 _ / ' / AGAME '/ ""GRAY Adwa Maztoer^ Adigwt L S* / / ' AARSUm ?

This society is identified in the archaeological record with the Proto-Aksumite assemblages (ca. 400 - 50 BCE) on the top of Bieta Giyorgis Hill to the northwest of present-day Aksum. The main indicators of this society are monumental architecture, elite tombs and administrative devices (Fattovich and Bard, 1994, 2001; Manzo, 2003). The location of these hierarchical societies was related to the spatial distribution of the major resources (aromatic resins, ivory, ebony, gold) in the region. The Gash Group and Jebel Mokram Group, pastoral and agro- pastoral chiefdoms, were located within the western area of distribution of these resources, to the east of the Nile Valley and south of Eastern Desert, with possible access to the Red Sea at Aqiq. The complex societies in the highlands were located along the eastern edge of the area of distribution of these resources, with access to the sea at Massawa and Arqiqo from the Hamasien34, at Adulis from Agame and Bur35, and possibly at Arsilè and Raheita near Assab on the Danakil coast from Tigray36. The progressive shift in the location of these societies from the lowlands to the highlands depended on the changes in the long-distance network of interactions with Egypt and the Levant. The earliest rank societies emerged in the western lowlands as a consequence of the Egyptian trade with Punt in the 3rd - 2nd millennia BCE. The later like 'paramount chief,' and might correspond to the later Aksumite title 'king of the kings'; s. e.g., the title " basileus ek basileõn Aksõmeiíõn megas Sembrouthēs " (king of the kings of the Aksumites, the great Sembrouthes) in an inscription in Eritrea (Pedroni, 1998). 34 The occurrence of ceramics decorated with shell impressions and bifacial obsidian tools at Gurgussom (Roubet, 1970; Franchini, n.d.; Trucca, n.d.), and lava-carved columns at El Gerar (Godet, 1980-1982, p. 92) on the coast at Massawa, suggest that this coast had been frequented since late prehistoric times. The region of Bur corresponds to the eastern highlands in present-day central Eritrea (Abduldaker Saleh, Hirt, Smidt and Tetzlaff, 2005, p. 352). 36 The occurrence of obsidian microliths, fragments of glass, and possibly ruins at Arsilè (Margebla/Assab) (Godet, 1980-1982, p. 82), and seven large grinding stones associated with cisterns at Raheita (Deirè) (Conti Rossini, 1920, pp. 291-292, 1928: 58, 60, 103, 167- 168, pl. LIII; Anfray, 1970, pp. 40-41, pl. X-XI) point to fréquentation of the coast near Assab in early historical times. 27</page><page sequence="30">RODOLFO FATTOVICH hierarchical societies emerged in the highlands as a consequence of the shift of the trade routes to the Red Sea and western Arabia in the 1st millennium BCE. THE "D'MT" COMPLEX SOCIETY: AN OUTLINE Archaeological and epigraphic evidence suggest that the "D'MT" polity developed in the early to mid- 1st millennium BCE and occupied a territory stretching from present-day central Tigray Regional State to central Eritrea (Fattovich, 1990a, 20 10)37. The formation of this polity incorporated present-day central Eritrea, and eastern and central Tigray Regional State into one territory. Small temples were erected at the edge of the plateau overlooking the valleys and may have been border markers controlling the caravan routes from the lowlands (Fattovich, 1990a, 2010). Over one hundred sites with ceramics of the Yeha-Matara Tradition can be ascribed to the "D'MT" polity, but only twelve sites have been more extensively investigated: Yeha, Hawlti, Melazo (Gobochela), Kidane Mehret (Aksum), and Seglamen in central Tigray Regional State; Mazber (Goulo Makeda) and Sobea in eastern Tigray Regional State; Maqaber Ga'ewa and Addi Galamo in south-eastern Tigray Regional State; and Matara, Kaskase and Addi Gerameten in central Eritrea (Godet, 1977, 1980-1982; Fattovich, 1990a; Michels, 2005; D. W. Phillipson, 2012, pp. 24-32). What can be inferred about "D'MT" from the scant epigraphic evidence is consistent with the description of the Puntite chiefdom in the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari. In both cases the 'king' and the 'queen' are equal in status and the population is divided into groups of 'reds' and 'blacks'38. This possibly suggests that "D'MT" polity developed from a pastoral or agro-pastoral rank society comparable to those of the 2nd millennium BCE in the western lowlands. 37 Sites with ceramics ascribable to the Yeha-Matara Tradition have been also recorded in the region of Shire to the west of Aksum, but they were not well published (s. Finneran and Phillips, 2003; Finneran et al., 2005). The prominent role of the queen is confirmed by a recently discovered inscription with the female genealogy of a king from Yeha (Gerlach, 2012). 28</page><page sequence="31">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE The original location of this earlier rank society is unknown. The location of most sites ascribable to "D'MT" in present-day central and eastern Tigray Regional State (Fattovich, 1990a, pp. 3-4) suggests that the core area was in present-day Tigray, but an eastern location cannot be excluded39. The original location of the core area of "D'MT" in present-day central Tigray can possibly be supported by the discovery of a few small statues representing a seated female figure40, sometimes with ornaments in a Nubian style, from Hawlti in central Tigray, and Maqaber Ga'ewa and Addi Giamo in south-eastern Tigray, and a carved standing female figure reminiscent of Kushitic queens, on a stone canopied throne, from Hawlti (de Contenson, 1962; Pirenne, 1967; Wolf and Nowotnick, 2010a)41. These figures suggest a significant role of women in the western region42. On the contrary, the anthropomorphic lion in the shape of a male sphinx, similar in style to Egyptian and Nubian ones, may have been a symbol of the chief or a male lion god in the eastern region (Fattovich, 1990a, pp. 5- 6)43, as most sphinxes occur in central Eritrea. These sphinxes possibly pertain to an Eritrean cultural tradition44. The earliest royal inscriptions, bearing the name of a personage (w'rn hywt) with the title mlk (king), have been found at Seglamen and Yeha in present-day central Tigray Regional State, and at Kaskase in central Eritrea 39 This evidence may be the result of limited investigation in Eritrea. 40 Small statues representing seated female figures have also been found in Yemen, but they are more crude in style and later in time than the Ethiopian statues. Moreover, the Yemeni figures have always been found in a funerary context, while those from Tigray were recorded in a ceremonial and ritual context (s. Antonini, 2001). 41 The female figure on the throne from Hawlti is associated with a larger-size male figure, which holds two insignias. The scene might represent a king and a queen. 42 The recorded legend of reigning queens at Aksum in a very ancient time in a manuscript in Saint Petersburg is possibly a surviving memory of the relevant role of the queen in present-day central Tigray in ancient times (Conti Rossini, 1942). 43 A sphinx from Dibdib in central Eritrea has a short inscription with a dedication to HBS, a South Arabian female deity (Ricci, 1955). A fragment of a clay sphinx was found in a ceremonial context at Hawlti, to the southwest of Aksum (de Contenson, 1963, pl. XXXVc). 29</page><page sequence="32">RODOLFO FATTOVICH (Bernard, Drewes and Schneider, 1991, pp. 68, 74-75, 81). The association of the king with the queen in the inscription from Seglamen possibly suggests a western origin of this individual (s. also D. W. Phillipson, 2012, 38) Although ambiguous, the epigraphic evidence is consistent with the picture emerging from the archaeological evidence (Fattovich, 1990a; D. W. Phillipson, 2012, pp. 38-40). Four kings, bearing the Sabean title mukarib D 'MT, and in one case mukarib "D 'MT" and sb ', are recorded after w'rn hywt. These kings seem to belong to at least two different lineages, suggesting a transfer of power from one lineage to another one (D. W. Phillipson, 2012, p. 39). The title mukarib "D 'MT" has only been recorded in traditional Tigray, and may point to a possible location of "D'MT" in this region (D. W. Phillipson, 2012, 38), while the title mukarib "D'MT" and sb' occurs in two inscriptions from eastern and south-eastern Tigray (Bernard, Drewes and Schneider, 1991, pp. 76-78, 79-80). Although the correct meaning of mukarib is uncertain (D. W. Phillipson, 2009, 2012, pp. 38-40), if we assume that "D'MT" and SB' are geographical or tribal names, this title might indicate an authority over both the western (D'MT) and eastern (SB') regions in Tigray and Eritrea, rather than Saba in Yemen, as scholars usually claim. The economic and social organization of the "D'MT" polity is uncertain (Fattovich, 2008; D. W. Phillipson, 2012, pp. 32-36). Palaeobotanical and archaeozoological evidence point to a mixed subsistence economy relying on cultivation of hulled barley, emmer, linseed, peas, oats, noog, lentils, and possibly teff, as well as domestic cattle, sheep and goats. Most likely, plough agriculture was practiced, but no evidence of irrigation has been found (Fattovich, 2008; D. W. Phillipson, 2012, pp. 35-36). The possession of livestock may have had a social significance, as can be inferred from anthropomorphic or geometric "marks of identity" in copper-alloy, which have been found at several sites, especially at Yeha (Fattovich, 1990a). The emergence of the Yeha-Matara Ceramic Tradition suggests a remarkable integration of communities from present-day central Eritrea to central Tigray Regional State (see Flannery and Marcus, 2012, p. 451), 30</page><page sequence="33">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE although the frequency of the ceramics of each tradition at each site suggests that the two regions maintained their basic identity. Most likely, local markets and/or ceremonial centers were the connective tissue in this network (Michels, 2005), as can be inferred from the occurrence of ceramics from different localities of Tigray at the ceremonial sites of Maqaber Ga'ewa and Seglamen in present-day south-central and central Tigray Regional State, respectively (Wolf and Nowotnick, 2010b, pp. 193- 203; Fattovich et al., 201 1). At present there is no record of long-distance trade, but archaeological and epigraphic evidence suggests privileged contacts with the South Arabs, which resulted in an indisputable South Arabian cultural influence. This influence is evident in the use of Sabaic as the official language and South Arabian script in the inscriptions, as well as in elite displays of rank and power, such as monumental architecture, art, small votive altars, offering tables, and perhaps copper-alloy "marks of identity" or seals (Fattovich, 1990a). On the contrary, only very few types of vessels in a South Arabian style have been found at the sites ascribable to "D'MT" (Fattovich, 1980; Durrani, 2005), and may have been local imitations of South Arabian types45. Most elements also point to contacts with different South Arabian regions, not only Saba (Fattovich, 1977, 1990a; Anfray, 1994; Robin and de Maigret, 1998). The inscriptions demonstrate that deities of the South Arabian pantheon were worshipped in the "D'MT" polity (Drewes, 1962). Only two temples at Yeha, however, are in a typical South Arabian style (Anfray, 1990, pp. 18-19, 1997; Robin and de Maigret, 1998; Japp et al., 2011). The remains of other small temples are not typically South Arabian, as they consist of a central, rectangular shrine with two or three rooms in the sanctuary, surrounded by an enclosure, and may be related to Nubian traditions (Fattovich, 1990a; Wolf and Nowotnick, 2010a, 2010b). 45 The so-called "torpedo" jars are an example. These jars occur in the African and Yemeni assemblages, but were made locally in each region (Porter, 2004). 31</page><page sequence="34">RODOLFO FATTOVICH Epigraphic evidence also suggests that individuals or small groups of South Arabians penetrated the highlands in Eritrea and Tigray at this time (Schneider, 2003). Rock inscriptions, dated to mid-9th - mid-6th centuries BCE, near Qohaito in central Eritrea, record individuals with South Arabian names as well as other Semitic names which do not occur in South Arabia or Ethiopia/Eritrea (Drewes, 1962, pp. 5-10; Ricci, 1959, 1960, 1994). This possibly suggests that South Arabs followed the Haddas Valley, from Adulis to Qohaito, to get to the plateau, but no certain South Arabian evidence has been found at Adulis46. The occurrence of vessels similar to those of the Sabir Culture at Matara in central Eritrea suggests that people in the eastern region of "D'MT" were directly interacting with those of the Yemeni coastal region (Anfray, 1966; Fattovich, 1980). Two inscriptions from Yeha recording individuals from Marib (Saba), as well as fragments of several vessels in Sabean style from the foundations of the so-called "Great Temple" and the lower strata at Yeha, suggest the presence of Sabeans in present-day central Tigray Regional State (Fattovich, 1980, p. 84; Bernard, Drewes and Schneider, 1991, pp. 104-105, 118-1 19; Robin and de Maigret, 1998; Japp et al., 201 1). Sabeans must have penetrated central Tigray from the Afar region, as excavations conducted at al-Hamid in Yemen demonstrated that this site was a Sabean coastal outpost opposite the Danakil coast (C. Phillips, 1997, 1998)47. There is also some evidence of contacts with the Nubian kingdom of Kush, but the interaction between the two regions does not seem to have been intense. Besides a pectoral in Egyptian/Nubian style carved on two statues of seated women from Hawlti, this evidence includes several beakers in a bell shape, which are well known in Nubia since prehistoric 46 Some South Arabian artefacts in the Archaeological Museum in Asmara are said to come from Adulis, but they were brought to Eritrea from Yemen in colonial times (s. Ricci, 1983). 47 A small rectangular temple within an enclosure, similar to those of present-day central Tigray, was found at al-Hamid (C. Phillips, 1997). This temple might be an African element on the Yemeni coast. 32</page><page sequence="35">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE times48, an alabaster jar from an elite tomb at Yeha, two amulets from Hawlti, and an amulet from Matara (Fattovich 1990a, p. 14). The end of the "D'MT" polity is obscure. At present, we can only suggest that this polity declined or collapsed in central Tigray Regional State in the 4th - 3rd centuries BCE, although an urban society apparently survived in central Eritrea (see Fattovich, 1990a). The destruction by fire of the two temples in South Arabian style at Yeha (Anfray, 1972, 1997) possibly suggests warfare as a cause of the end of "D'MT" in central Tigray (Fattovich, 2006, 2009), but the date of this event is unknown and may have been earlier than the 4th - 3rd centuries BCE. The similarity in design between two small shrines at Hawlti, where a canopied throne and two female statues were found (de Contenson, 1963), and the small Temple 292 at Meroe, where a bronze head of Augustus was discovered (see Welsby, 1996, p. 189), possibly suggests that the canopied throne and statues from Hawlti were Meroitic war trophies. At present, however, there is no record in Meroitic texts of any raid as far as the Tigrean highlands49. In any case, whatever actually happened, the "D'MT" and SB' polities, along with South Arabian influence, were a short-lived episode in the cultural history of the northern Horn of Africa, which did not last more than 100-150 years, if a maximum period of 25-30 years of reign for each king can be assumed (Schneider, 1976b, p. 92). The archaeological evidence suggests that after the end of the period of Ethiopian mukaribs, small scale hierarchical societies emerged again, at least in central Tigray Regional State, and survived until the rise of Aksum (Michels, 2005; Fattovich, 2009, 2010). Eventually, a new Proto-Aksumite rank society (ca. 400 - 50 BCE) emerged at Aksum in the 4th century BCE (Fattovich and Bard, 1994, 48 The Ethiopian specimens were most likely locally made for ritual use. 49 The Annals of Harsiyotef (404 - 369 BCE) and Nastasen (335 - 315 BCE) record frequent Meroitic raids in Eastern Sudan, most likely as far at the Eritrean-Sudanese lowlands, in the 4th century BCE (s. Eide, Hägg, Pierce and Török, 1996, pp. 437-464, 471- 501). The Annals of Nastasen record campaigns against many populations that cannot be located with certainty, and thus might have included the Tigrean highlands. 33</page><page sequence="36">RODOLFO FATTOVICH 2000). The archaeological evidence of this society shows only few elements of continuity with the earlier material culture. Proto-Aksumite mortuary evidence, on the contrary, points to a basic change in ideology between the "D'MT" and Proto-Aksumite polities, from one where public works were the cult temples of the gods to one where monumental works commemorated elite burials. The use of elite funerary stelae similar in style to those of the Gash Group also suggests a cultural link with the late prehistoric cultural traditions of the Eritrean-Sudanese lowlands (Fattovich, Manzo and Bard, 1998; Bard, Fattovich, Manzo and Perlingieri, 2002). TENTATIVE INTERPRETATION Despite the fact that the origin and development of the "D'MT" polity are obscure, it can be assumed that the rise of this polity was the result of long-term historical processes based on the evolving long-distance trade between the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean regions. These processes can be investigated by distinguishing a series of interaction processes at different spatial/temporal scales. A) Macro-scale interaction process First, the formation of the "D'MT" polity depended on the progressive inclusion of the northern Horn of Africa into the long-distance interaction network between the Mediterranean (mainly Egypt) and southern Red Sea regions in late prehistoric and early historical times. This macro-scale process generated a shift of social complexity from the western lowlands to the highlands, as a consequence of shifts from African land routes (4th- 3rd millennia BCE), to Red Sea maritime routes (2nd millennium BCE), to Arabian land routes (late 2nd - 1st millennia BCE), and once again to Red Sea maritime routes connected to Indian Ocean maritime routes (late 1st Millennium BCE - early 1st millennium CE). The spatial distribution of valued natural resources for ancient trade was decisive in this process: ebony along the slopes of the highlands, aromatic resins on the western and eastern slopes of the highlands and the plateau as far as Temben in central Tigray, gold in the Mareb/Gaslrand 34</page><page sequence="37">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE Barka river valleys, and ivory in the lowlands and northern highlands (Fattoyich, 1990b; Manzo, 1999). Initially, in the late 3rd to mid-2nd millennia BCE, a chiefdom emerged in the western lowlands in the Gash Delta as pastoral peoples in this region were geographically more exposed to direct interaction with the Nile Valley, and had easy access to strategic resources during their transhumance from the lowlands to the plateau. These pastoral people spread over the whole lowlands as far as the Red Sea coast (where they could meet Egyptians and perhaps South Arabs), the Barka Valley, and possibly the highlands in Eritrea and Tigray, transplanting forms of social complexity at the edge of the highlands and/or on the highlands50. Beginning in the mid-2nd millennium BCE, the people living in the alluvial plains to the east of the Mareb/Gash were marginal in the network of interaction with the Nile Valley and people from the Eastern Desert in Sudan penetrated into the lowlands, but forms Of social complexity survived in the region. At this time the Barka Valley might have been the Land of Punt in the Hatshepsut's relieves at Deir el-Bahari. In the early to mid- 1st millennium BCE products from the western lowlands were apparently channelled to the Red Sea (and most likely the Yemeni coast) through the highlands to be transferred to the Levant along the caravan routes of the western Arabian Peninsula (s. Groom, 1981, pp. 189-205). Hierarchical societies appeared on the highlands as a consequence of this shift of the trade routes from the Nile Valley to Arabia. B) Middle scale interaction process Beginning in the early 2nd millennium BCE, the inclusion of the regions on opposite sides of the southern Red Sea into the long-distance trade network with Egypt and later the Levant accelerated the interregional interaction between southern Arabia and the northern Horn of Africa. 50 Ceramics similar in style to those of the Gash Group were recorded around Barentù in the middle Mareb Valley (Brandt, personal communication, September 1994), from where a system of valleys connects the lowlands to the highlands to the west of Aksum. 35</page><page sequence="38">RODOLFO FATTOVICH An interaction network between the opposite sides of the southern Red Sea already existed since at least the 5th - 4th millennia BCE. In the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE Egyptian seafaring expeditions to Punt reinforced this network and people from the coastal regions of Yemen participated in the trade with the Egypt, most likely frequenting the African harbours (Aqiq?, Adulis?) when the Egyptians were there (Fattovich, 2012a; Bard and Fattovich, 2013). The collapse of the Egyptian trade to Punt, together with the expansion of trading activity from Yemen to the Levant along the western Arabian Peninsula, and the development of tribal kingdoms in south-western Arabia, opened the way to the inclusion of the northern Horn of Africa in the South Arabian commercial network. This inclusion was possibly stimulated by the desire to gain direct access to the resources of the western lowlands, to the southeast of the Nubian kingdom of Kush, which was controlling the flow of products from the African hinterland to Egypt along the Nile Valley (Edwards, 2004, pp. 139-140). The penetration of South Arabs to the highlands in Eritrea and Tigray apparently followed two different routes: a) Present-day central Eritrea and eastern Tigray Regional State were included in a network of contacts with people from the coastal regions of Yemen, and a local hierarchical society possibly arose at Kaskase. At this time the people in Hamasien were included in the eastern network as intermediaries in the flow of products from the lowlands to Adulis and as direct suppliers of gold from the mines around Asmara (Schmidt, Habtemichael and Curtis, 2008). b) Sabeans may have followed the salt routes from the Danakil coast to present-day south-eastern and central Tigray Regional State, possibly in order to bypass the eastern region and to gain direct access to the sources of aromatic resins in Temben and ivory in the lowlands to the southwest of the Mareb/Gash river, where the main source of ivory was located in the late 1st millennium BCE - early 1st millennium CE (Conti Rossini, 1928, p. 115). Interaction between the local elite and South Arabian traders may have generated a new rank society which developed into an early state incorporating both regions in the highlands in the - 7th/6th century BCE. 36</page><page sequence="39">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE O Small-scale interaction process In the absence of any evidence supporting a massive migration and/or colonization from south-western Arabia to the African highlands, it can be suggested that the South Arabian elements characterizing "D'MT" society appeared as a consequence of deliberate choices by a few individuals and were possibly part of a political competition at a small scale of interaction. Unfortunately, the dynamics of interaction within small-scale social networks at the scale of local groups are the most difficult to identify in the archaeological record because they depended on the behaviour of individual social actors - and textual evidence is almost inexistent. The little textual evidence that we have are: 1) The kings have Semitic, but not Sabean names (Lusini, 2000); only the name w'rm used by the first king {w'rm hywt ) and by the founder of the second lineage (w 'rm rydri) occur in Sabaic (Caqijot and Drewes, 1955, p. 31). 2) The kings belong to two different lineages (Schneider, 1976b; Bernard, Drewes and Schneider 1991, p. 67); 3) The queens are associated with the earliest two kings (Schneider, 1976a, p. 53). 4) One (anonymous) king records his female genealogy (Gerlach, 2012)51. 5) The title mukarib "D'MT" appears with the second king, and mukarib "D 'MT" and sb ' with the fifth one. 6) The first king stated that South Arabian gods, including the Sabean god Almaqah, gave him the throne (Schneider, 1976b, pp. 81-89). By also taking the archaeological evidence into account, a tentative interpretation of the textual evidence suggests that: 1) South Arabian merchants settled in both the western and eastern regions of the highlands and maintained their religion to keep alive their identity52. 51 A similar formula was used by the Nubian king Aspelta (ca. 593 - 568 BCE) to legitimize his power in his 'Stela of Coronation' (Budge, 1907, II, pp. 63-66; Welsby, 1996, p. 27). 37</page><page sequence="40">RODOLFO FATTOVICH 2) These merchants may have been considered as emissaries of South Arabian kings and thus enjoyed a special protection by local chiefs, such as between the traders from Massawa and Arqiqo on the Red Sea coast and the Bogos and Maria tribes in the highlands in the 19th century CE (Conti Rossini, 1916, pp. 642, 714)53. 3) Links with the South Arabian kingdoms, especially Saba, were likely maintained in order to guarantee the flow of products from Africa to the Arabian Peninsula, as can be inferred from the occurrence of similar ceramics and other artefacts, such as, e.g., the elongated ('torpedo') jars and 'marks of identity', in Yemen, Eritrea and Tigray (Fattovich, 1977). 4) A few South Arabian (or possibly Sabean) merchants (or even just one) gained political power through marriages with women of the local elite and legitimised their authority through the local matrilineal line of inheritance, generating 'Afro-Arab' elite lineages and at the same time claiming their devotion to South Arabian and local deities54. 5) A change from an indigenous matrilineal line to an exogenous patrilineal line of power inheritance may have been a consequence of the emergence of an 'Afro-Arab' elite55. Such a change in the traditional social system may have been emphasized by declaring that the throne was given 52 S., e.g., the small shrines of foreign traders at the Ptolemaic/Roman port of Berenike on the Red Sea coast in Egypt (Sidebotham, 201 1). According to the traditional custom of sedentary and pastoral people in the northern Horn of Africa, a foreigner could be incorporated into a community through the patronage of a chief or high ranking individual (Conti Rossini, 1916, pp. 80-84, 564-567, 642, 714). In the traditional societies of the northern Horn of Africa, protected foreigners could become members of elite lineages by marriage (s. e.g., the customary rules of the Maria, a pastoral tribe in northern Ertirea; Conti Rossini, 1916, p. 714). A similar process of incorporation of Arabs into elite lineages by marriage was a component of the Arabization of Nubia in the early 2nd millennium CE (Adams, 1977, pp. 558-559). The same process is well documented in northwestern Wallega, where by the mid- 19th century CE the half-caste descendants of Arab traders were able to gain power from their protectors through intermarriage and manipulation of internal politics (Triulzi, 1975, p. 59). This process may be suggested by the representation of a male figure much larger in scale than a female figure on the side of the canopied throne from Hawlti, suggestmg a dominant position of the 'king' over the 'queen' (s. de Contenson 1963, pl. XXXII- XXXIII). 38</page><page sequence="41">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE to the king by Almaqah and other South Arab gods (Schneider, 1976b, pp. 81-89). 6) An 'Afro-Arab' chief may have imposed his dominion over a larger territory, adopting the Sabean title of mukarib, and he may have built the temples at Yeha using Sabean workers and craftsmen in order to display the new power to the people in the region (s. also Wolf and Nowotnick, 2010a). 7) Competition for leadership between lineages may have caused conflicts and eventually the incorporation of both western and eastern regions under a new 'king'. These conflicts may have caused the destruction by fire of the monumental temples at Yeha56. This interpretation, though indisputably speculative, may be coherent with the origins of other historically documented 'first-generation kingdoms' elsewhere in the world (Flannery and Marcus, 2012, pp. 341- 366). The emergence and consolidation of these kingdoms was always the result of the action of particularly ambitious chiefs, who were capable of manipulating the social and political logic of their society, and expanding their power by getting a military advantage in competition with the surrounding chiefs (Flannery and Marcus, 2012, pp. 364-366). CONCLUSIONS The evidence I have reviewed in this article suggests that the "D'MT" polity was deeply rooted in local (African) social and cultural traditions, and the South Arabian component was only a superficial, though impressive, aspect of this society. The historical process, which led to the rise and decline of "D'MT" was characterized by57: 56 According to local traditions, most likely dating to the late Middle Ages, Yeha was the residence of the Queen of Sheba and the town was destroyed before the rise of Aksum, as a consequence of a conflict between two brothers, Soba and Noba (Anfray 1963, p. 171, n. 2). 57 In this article I have privileged the analysis and interprettion of one major aspect of this process, i.e., changes in the economic, social, political and cultural interaction networks at different scales. Of course, there are other aspects to be examined, such as, e.g., the impact 39</page><page sequence="42">RODOLFO FATTO VICH 1) The progressive inclusion of the northern Horn of Africa since late prehistoric times into the macro-scale network of interaction between populations settled around the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean, because of the occurrence of highly valued resources along the western slopes of the highlands and the western lowlands. 2) The southward Egyptian economic and political expansion along the Nile Valley and Red Sea, which stimulated the emergence of rank societies at a chiefdom scale of complexity in the western lowlands in the 3rd - 2nd millennia BCE. 3) The inclusion of the northern Horn of Africa into the South Arabian area of economic expansion after the collapse of the Egyptian trade with Punt in the late 2nd millennium BCE. 4) The penetration of traders from the coastal regions and later highlands in Yemen in the late 2nd - early 1st millennia BCE. 5) The incorporation of these traders into the local communities through the patronage of chiefs and/or other elite members. 6) The skilful manipulation of the indigenous social and political system by protected traders through intermarriage with elite women and the consequent emergence of local 'Afro-Arab' elite lineages and chiefs in the early 1st millennium BCE. 7) The emergence of a kingdom under the stimulus of one or a few 'Afro-Arab' chiefs, who used South Arab symbols of power to legitimize and display their dominion in the early to mid- 1st millennium BCE. 8) The collapse of the kingdom because of internal conflicts in the mid- 1st millennium BCE and the emergence of distinct small-scale societies and/or petty kingdoms in the late 1st millennium BCE (Fattovich 2010). 9) The eventual rise of a new kingdom at Aksum in the late 1st millennium BCE - early 1st millennium CE. In conclusion, I am aware that the narrative I suggested here is largely speculative, raising more questions than it provides answers. In my of climate, which may have stimulated movements of people from the lowlands to the highlands in the late 2nd - early 1st millennia BCE, or intensification of agricultural productivity to sustain the early state in the highlands. These aspects will require further investigation in the future. 40</page><page sequence="43">THE NORTHERN HORN OF AFRICA IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM BCE opinion, however, this narrative, though incomplete and questionable, may provide further hypotheses to be tested in the field. First, a systematic survey of the Red Sea coast will be necessary to locate the harbours that the Egyptians and later South Arabs used for their trading activity58. Surveys of the salt trade routes from the highlands to the Danakil Depression in the Afar region will also be necessary to identify possible evidence of South Arab penetration into present-day central Tigray Regional State59. An accurate investigation of the settlement pattern will also be necessary to identify the scale of complexity and internal interaction of the "D'MT" polity (s. A. Smith, 2003). Eventually, stratigraphie excavations at the individual sites will be required to detect possible traces of destruction. The most important step forward in the research will be the abandonment of any ideological prejudice about either the role of the South Arabs in forging the Ethiopian state and culture or the negation of this role. History is much more intricate and fascinating than archaeologists and historians think. 58 In particular, the site of Raheita, near Assab, is worthy of a more detailed investigation to collect possible evidence of a South Arab outpost on the Danakil coast. 59 The rock inscriptions at Qohaito (central Eritrea) already provide some indication of the route from Gulf of Zula to the highlands. 41</page><page sequence="44">RODOLFO FATTOVICH BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES Abdulkader Saleh, Hirt, Nicole, Smidt, Wolbert G.C., Tetzlaff, Rainer (eds.), 2005, Friedensräume in Eritrea und Tigray unter Druck , Berlin.
