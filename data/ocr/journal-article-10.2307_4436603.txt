<plain_text><page sequence="1">DREAMS, RELIGION AND POLITICS IN REPUBLICAN ROME* Roman literature is rich on narratives about dreams which influenced the course of history. A long list of illustrious dreamers - from Aeneas and Scipio the Elder to Augustus and Constantine - links the city's mythical origins with the advent of the Christian empire.' Political dreams which delineated a pro- gramme - be it strategic, dynastic or religious - are part of what early modern Europe inherited from Rome. The Romans themselves adopted this solemn manner of inaugurating great events from others - and they did so from early on. By the second century BC dreams had become a stable ingredient of all poetic genres, of epos and comedy, of mythological and historical drama - and the models for this were patently Greek.2 Rome's historians were no less receptive. In the hellenistic world cities and sanctuaries had often been founded 'on account of a dream' - and, like Rome herself, some of her altars, temples and ludi eventually acquired similar ori- gins.3 However, when republican historians dealt with Rome's more recent histo- ry, be it political or military, they had little to tell about dreams. Here too, Greek historians offered numerous models.4 By the fourth century BC dreams about * I am indebted to the Danish Research Council as well as the Danish Academy in Rome for their generous support; and to my colleagues Ittai Gradel, Copenhagen, Pia Guldager, Aarhus, Mette Moltesen, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek and Henrik Mouritsen, London, for information concerning archaeological and historical matters.

After all, dreams had but a marginal place in the religion of the Roman state. The taking of auspices, the divination from entrails, the interpretation of prodigia, were standard proce- dures, sanctified by law or tradition. But on matters concerning the res publica dreams were rarely consulted. Prior to the first century BC generals and consuls invoking a dream are not only unusual, but exceptional.5 So a number of interesting problems are raised when Cicero, in his magiste- rial discussion of Roman divination, claims that the Senate from time to time 'had not ignored dreams of a serious kind if they seemed of public relevance' (nec vero somnia graviora, si quae ad rem publicam pertinere visa sunt, a summo consilio neglecta sunt). To illustrate his point, Cicero quotes only one example. But parallels are known; however, not all of them have been examined in detail, still less as a whole. Nor is it clear how the Senate handled such dreams and what was their impact. The present article provides the first comprehensive survey, from Fabius Pictor down to Sulla. For practical reasons it sets out by examining the specific case to which Cicero refers. The dream of Metella, which during the Social War in 90 BC induced the Senate to arrange a series of supplicationes and order the temple of Juno Sospita to be restored, is by far the best documented political dream from the republican period. Cicero, who remembered the incident well (he witnessed the crisis of 91-90 BC at close range) further quotes the com- ments of another contemporary, the historian Sisenna. Centuries later, when compiling his epitome of prodigies, Iulius Obsequens consulted Livy's account of the episode, thereby preserving important evidence.6 Greek historian Silenus: W. Herrmann, Die Historien des Coelius Antipater (Meisenheim am Glahn 1979) 73 ff.; 176 ff.; Cic. Div. 1.39; 46; 50 and 2.135 further quotes Philistus. Heraclides Ponticus and Dinon Persicus (dreams of mothers prior to the birth of famous sons), Agathocles of Cyzicus (a general prior to battle) and finally an anonymous historian of Alexander the Great. 5 On the definition and handling of prodigia, the studies by F. Luterbacher, Der Prodigien- glaube und Prodigienstil der Romer (Burgdorf 1880; reprint, Darmstadt 1967) and L. Wulker, Die geschichtliche Entwicklung des Prodigienwesens bei den Romern (Diss., Leipzig 1903) are supplemented by R.

(n. 5) 3 seems mistaken when dismissing 'die niemals staatlich gesuhnten Traume'.</page><page sequence="3">Dreams, Religion and Politics in Republican Rome 55 There are, however, aspects which still need to be clarified, as to the status of Metella, the whereabouts of Juno's temple and the purpose of the restoration. While these problems are discussed in the article's first four sections, the final two proceed to examine the episode in a wider perspective, comparing previous and subsequent Roman reactions to political dreams. I 'The Dreams of a Woman' When on the Ides of March Calpurnia warned her husband against attending the fatal meeting in the Senate (she had dreamt he would come to harm), one of the conspirators asked whether Caesar would indeed offend the senators by absent- ing himself, using "the dreams of a woman' as his excuse. What matters here is not the reliability of this colourful account, but its portrayal of Calpurnia as a tragic heroine, a latter-day Cassandra vainly trying to protect Caesar. Her role in this dynastic tragedy reaches its culmination when the slaves return from the Senate carrying Caesar's body and she receives them standing in front of his house, surrounded by her attendants and loudly bewail- ing his death: Had he but listened to her dreams! In another early version her dream even represented the endangered Caesarian domus: according to Livy, Calpurnia dreamt that the honorific pediment with which the Senate had al- lowed Caesar to adorn his residence fell down. While the assassin - for obvious reasons - dismissed her dream as being of no consequence, its subsequent impact was strong. Few historians fail to men- tion the episode, and in the telling rival versions emerged, eventually furnishing Caesar with a dream of his own.7 Still, Calpurnia held her ground. At Rome, her vision was the first and most famous of its kind; and with the advent of monarchy the model caught on. Imitating this and earlier examples, be they Persian or Greek, later historians and poets would from time to time furnish the wives and mothers of the Caesars with no less startling premonitions about the future greatness or impending fall of the imperial house.8 7 yujivatx6; Evxnviot;: Nic.

Calpurnia was by no means the first Roman woman whose dreams had interested historians. But significantly the previous visions on record do not concern the future of an aristocratic domus, but that of the res publica as such. Moreover, while Calpurnia's warnings fell on deaf ears, those of her visionary predecessors are known occasionally to have impelled the Senate to take appropriate expiatory action, thereby to avert imminent danger. To bring out the contrast, one merely needs to go back to the year 90 BC, another year of crisis, when another Caesar (a distant relative of the Dictator) was in power, and another, far more effective, visionary addressed the Senate. It was at a highly critical juncture, with virtually all Italy in open revolt, that the Senate received a report about the dream of Caecilia Metella.9 In the pre- vious autumn, the murder of Livius Drusus and the massacre of Roman magis- trates at Asculum had brought political tension to a head. When the Marsi threw off their allegiance, Rome's allies throughout Italy followed the lead.'0 As usual there had been warnings from above. Prior to Metella's dream reports of other prodigia had been submitted to the Senate. Among these was a maxumum ... portentum from Lanuvium which the haruspices considered high- ly alarming (tristissumum): mice had destroyed some silver shields deposited in a sanctuary. Since Lanuvium was the seat of the great temple of Juno Sospita, in times of crisis a traditional centre of prophecy, the incident seemed to spell disaster. " focus on the imperial thalamus, is prominent at [Sen.] Oct. 115 ff. (Octavia) and 712 ff. (Poppaea); cf. P. Kragelund, Prophecy, Populism and Propaganda in the Octavia (K0ben- havn 1982) 22 ff. 9 Cic. Div. 1.99 dates the episode to Marsico bello; the temple was restored by L. lulius Caesar qui cum P. Rutilio consul fuit (i.e. in 90 BC): ibid. 1.4. Obseq. 55 records the dream as the first item in 90 BC, prior to early Italic victories in Picenum and over Rutilius in June, but this is not necessarily the Livian order of events: cf. P.L.

NH 8.221; 2.98 and Div. 2.54. Lanuvium a centre of prophecy: n. 36.</page><page sequence="5">Dreams, Religion and Politics in Republican Rome 57 This was all too soon confirmed by events. The Italians founded a rival state and in the spring of the year 90 BC Rome suffered a series of military defeats, culminating in June when one of the consuls, P. Rutilius Rufus, fell in battle and his army was routed. On the southern front, Rutilius' colleague Lucius Iulius Caesar was like- wise defeated. But later that year a victory over the Samnites seems somewhat to have turned the tide; and Caesar's policy of compromise probably contribut- ed to split the rebels. According to the lex lulia, all Latins and Italians who had remained faithful or who had readily surrendered were to be rewarded with Roman citizenship. The consul was now elected censor, in which capacity he could supervise the implementation of the law.'2 At some point during this troubled period the Senate, moreover, had en- trusted Caesar with the task of superintending the religious ceremonies with which to appease Juno Sospita. Juno had - perhaps for the second time - announced her displeasure; this time by means of a dream. The content of this dream is only known from lulius Obsequens, who perhaps as late as the fourth century compiled a list of the prodigies mentioned by Livy.13 According to Obsequens, Juno appeared to Metella to complain that her temple had been grossly polluted. Hence the goddess' decision to leave. Only with great difficulty (aegre) had Metella succeeded in persuading her to stay. This was, for a number of reasons, not only an unusual, but also an alarming epiphany. From time immemorial the announcement that gods intended to abandon their temples seemed to herald imminent disaster; and the medium adopted by the goddess must have added to the feeling of urgency.'4 The gods normally communicated with the Romans by means of portents. These could of course vary greatly, but as a rule there were time-honoured precedents. Thunder and celestial apparitions, fire from earth, bleeding statues and abnormal births - it had usually all been heard of before, and tradition prescribed how to handle individual cases. When such reports were brought 12 Rutilius and Caesar: Broughton, MRR II, 25 (with sources). Rutilius fell on II June 90: Ov. Fas. 6.563-566. Lex lulia: n. 50. 13 Obseq. 55 (ed.

Tac. Hist. 5.13 (the gods [!] leave the temple in Jerusalem prior to the city's fall); similarly, in dreams, Apollo leaves Tyrus prior to its fall (Diod. Sic. 17.41.8; Curt. 4.3.2 1) and Minerva leaves her sanctuary and abandons Domitian: Suet. Dom. 15.3.</page><page sequence="6">58 PATRICK KRAGELUND before the Senate, the Senate could reject them, demand to hear witnesses, or decide at once how to appease the gods, either on its own authority or by way of consulting the haruspices or one of the priestly colleges.'5 For reasons to which we shall presently return dreams rarely figured in such reports - but in Metella's case there were at least two precedents. No less an authority than Fabius Pictor preserves a legend about the Senate once having decided to repeat the games in honour of Jupiter, partly because one Titus Latinius had dreamt that this was the god's demand, partly because it was found out that an error had been committed (cf. p. 78). However, while this was long ago, the second known instance was more recent, and probably also more pertinent. In the autumn of 105 BC, when news of the defeat at Arausio reached Rome, nothing seemed to stand in the way of the Cimbrian advance. As usual, panic was intensified by the reports of horrifying prodigia - all of which were duly expiated. A solemn vow was even undertaken to honour Jupiter with votive ludi if things turned out well.'6 The crisis seems, moreover, to have given rise to religious innovation. A number of matronae reported that on the same night they had been sent the same dream. The dream (the content of which the historian Granius Licinianus fails to divulge) was clearly regarded as a sign of divine anger and expiated with sacrifices; and a chorus consisting of boys of noble blood performed a hymn 'in honour of the gods' (in deos).'7 It is a priori unlikely that a ceremony involving the sons of the nobility took place without official approval, but Granius Licinianus provides no details, and for some reason either Livy or Obsequens discarded the incident. There may, moreover, be other such omissions. So it cannot be excluded that the Senate had decided to act upon other reports about dreams (be it of groups or individuals), when in 90 BC panic once again seized Rome. Now the threat was not posed by the Cimbri, but by the Italians: the Italian bull should crush the Roman wolf- to judge from the rebels' coinage that was their deadly aim. 15 On procedures, see e.g. L. Wulker, op. cit. (n. 5) 79 ff. and B.

As during the Cimbrian war, Jupiter was promised votive ludi; and even if it was highly unusual, it was decided to examine what was the import of Metella's dream. Indeed, the indications are that this latter incident loomed large in accounts of the period. Cicero quoted it as one of the rare examples of a dream which was relevant for the res publica. Similarly, Obsequens devotes more space to this than to any other portent, so it may be presumed that Livy too would have treated it at length. It is unfortunate, therefore, that the sources do not reveal what priesthood the Senate consulted, but since it all resulted in a series of supplicationes, the decemviri are the most likely candidates.'8 In any case, the persons in charge clearly examined the matter thoroughly; and their findings confirmed Metella's report. At Juno's temple the matronae involved in the rituals had somehow polluted the sanctu- ary; a bitch with her newborn puppies was even found to have nested under the very statue of the goddess.'9 With these findings the affair moved onto familiar ground. Polluting a sanctuary was something that called for specific action; and, to this end, a reassuring wealth of prescriptions and procedures was available. In the present case the outcome was a senatus consultum prescribing that Juno's temple should be purified, that a series of supplicationes be arranged, and her temple restored. Gellius preserves a similar document, a senatus consultum concerning a prodigium from 99 BC (the sacred lances of Mars in the Regia had moved by themselves). Beginning with a brief statement, 'Because NN has reported that this and this has happened' (Quod C. Iulius L. filius pontifex nuntiavit ...), it then specifies what victims the consul should sacrifice to what gods (de ea re ita censuerunt, uti M. Antonius consul hostibus maioribus lovi et Marti procuraret etc. ).20 For his own account, Livy probably relied on such a decree - or on someone who did; and to judge from Obsequens, he appears to have described the epiphany in appropriate style. A case in point is Juno's use of a plural (sua templa) when referring to 'her temple'. This was apparently the way gods 18 Ludi for Jupiter: n. 73; a supplicatio was normally (but not always) proposed by the decemviri: L. Wulker, op. cit. (n. 5) 38-39 and K. Latte, Romische Religionsgeschichte (Munchen 1960) 245. 19 Matronae at Lanuvium: J. Gagd, op. cit.

In an archaic oracle quoted by Livy, Apollo calls Delphi mea templa.2i What further happened is unclear; neither Obsequens' aedem ... refecit nor Cicero's templum ... restituit is graphic, but the terminology reveals that things went beyond a mere purification: the temple was restored, or even rebuilt (cf. p. 73 ff.).22 According to Cicero, Lucius Caesar was responsible for the restoration; perhaps his colleague, Rutilius, was already dead by then, but such works were, in any case, often entrusted to one of the consuls. Yet it should be noted that Obsequens - without mentioning Caesar - gives the whole credit to Metella. The discrepancy is in the circumstances explicable: in 87 BC, when the war with the allies had become a civil war between Sulla and Marius, the latter executed Caesar. Later, Metella would then have assumed the charge and seen it through to the end. II A Woman with virtus For a woman to undertake such a prestigious charge was highly unusual. In the religious sphere, the Vestal virgins and the ordo matronarum had their well- defined areas of competence, but the influence of individuals had traditionally been slight. Against this background Metella's preeminence is truly remarkable (a fact which has gone strangely unnoticed). It therefore seems imperative briefly to reexamine the evidence concerning her life - all the more so since there are aspects which hitherto have been misconstrued. 'Caecilia Metella' or 'Caecilia, the daughter of Q. Baliaricus' (as Cicero and Livy call her) belonged to the highest ranks of Roman society.23 By 90 BC, 21 Obsequens shortens and normalizes, misunderstands and leaves out topographical detail, but sometimes preserves characteristic phrases: P.L. Schmidt, op. cit. (n. 9) 13-18. For parallels to Juno's complaint quod immunde sua templa foedarentur, see Liv. 5.16.11 (Apollo calls Delphi templa mea); immunde is unique, but has clear religious overtones; so, of course, has foedare: cf. e.g. Liv. 3.18.10 (streetfighting and bloodshed 'polluted the temple' on the Capitol [foedavere templum]; the temple was therefore purgatum atque lustratum). 22 From Obsequens (n. 13) L. Crozzoli Aite, I tre templi del Foro Olitorio, Atti della Pontificia Accademia, Memorie 3.13 (Roma 1981) 114 infers that the temple was purified and not restored (a solution which allegedly fits the archaeological evidence from Rome, cf. n. 52), but to judge from parallels such as Liv. 4.20.7 aedem ... vetustate dilapsam refecit (sc. Augustus), Augustus, RG 20 duo et octoginta templa deum ... ex auctoritate senatus refeci and Asconius, Scaur. 24 Castoris ... templum Metellus ... refecerat, Cicero's templum ... refecit implies a good deal more than that; and so, apparently, does Obse- quens' restituit: cf. e.g. Cic. Verr. 2.4.69 (Capitolium ... restitutum by Catulus). 23 Caeciliae, Baliaricifiliae and Caeciliae Q. filiae: Cic. Div. 1.4; 2.136 and 1.99; at Obseq. 55 she is Metella Caecilia.</page><page sequence="9">Dreams, Religion and Politics in Republican Rome 61 when the Senate received a report about her dream, a splendid line of Metellan consuls and censors had for more than a generation dominated the res publica. Among them was Caecilia's father, Q. Metellus Baliaricus. Also elsewhere Cicero refers to a daughter of Baliaricus named Caecilia (presumably one and the same). In 80 BC, when defending Sextus Roscius, Cicero stressed the benevolence of this lady towards his client. To impress the judges Cicero enumerates Metella's consular kinsmen, her father, uncles and brother, Q. Metellus Nepos.24 To Cicero's long list of distinguished kinsmen modem scholarship has added a husband. Metella was, so is it claimed, married to the consul of 79 BC, Appius Claudius Pulcher; among their children was Cicero's adversary, Clodi- us.25 This assumption, which remains the standard view, is based on the fact that Cicero repeatedly refers to the sons of Pulcher and of Nepos (the brother of Metella) asfratres (i.e. 'cousins') - and cousins is of course what they would be, if the sister of Nepos were the wife of Pulcher: Q.

First of all, Cicero nowhere describes her as a wife, still less as a mother (Pulcher was the father of six, all counted). Assuming she was married, this is odd. Not only was Claudius Pulcher a prominent figure in Sulla's Rome, but in his rhetoric (as indeed elsewhere) Cicero rarely fails to mention the husband, sons or in-laws of a prominent woman. As a rule it is only when there are no such links he falls back upon the roles of daughter, sister or niece.26 This is what happens in the case of 'Metella, the daughter of Baliari- cus', and there seems to be no reason for discarding Cicero's testimony. Hence a modification: rather than the Metella known from Cicero, Pulcher might have married an otherwise unattested sister - or perhaps Metella had divorced Pulcher by the time Cicero defended Sextus Roscius.27 All very logical - provided, of course, that Pulcher did in fact marry a daughter of Baliaricus. But here again there are problems. As the stemma illustrates, the assumption of such a marriage is based on Cicero's calling the sons of Pulcher and Nepos fratres (i. e. cousins). However, this inference overlooks a crucial fact. In classical Latin, fratres (with or without an added patrueles) does not refer to cousins in general, but only to t h e s o n s o f b r o t h e r s 28 And Cicero, who repeatedly uses frater when referring to the persons in question, is at one point explicit: Pulcher's son Clodius was the frater patruelis of a son of Nepos.29 If this is correct, it remains to be explained how members of different gentes could have fathers who are brothers. The obvious answer is adoption - and since the patrician Claudians took pride in never having adopted (whereas the Metelli happily went along), Nepos was perhaps a brother of Pulcher who had been adopted by Baliaricus.30 26 cf. D.R. Shackleton Bailey, Onomasticon to Cicero's Speeches (Stuttgart 1988) under the relevant entries. 27 Modifying Munzer, J. Carcopino, Sylla ou la monarchie manquee (Paris 1931) 180 ff. insisted on the unmarried status of the visionary Metella and postulated a sister, who married Pulcher; similarly, R. Syme, Rom. Rev. (Oxford 1939) 20-21; E.S. Gruen, Roman Politics and the Criminal Courts, 149-78 BC (Cambr. Mass. 1968) 266-267 and E. Rawson, Historia 22 (1973) 222. Alternatively, M. Geizer, Cicero (Wiesbaden 1969; reprint of RE 1939) 19, n. 18 suggested that Cicero's 'Nichtnennung des Gatten (sc. der Metella) muBte damit erklart werden, daB die Ehe im Jahr 80 geschieden war'. 28 frater andfrater patruelis = patruifilius: TLL 6 col. 1254, 83 ff. and TLL 10.1 col. 791-2. D.R. Shackleton Bailey, "Brothers or Cousins?", AJAH 2 (1977) 148 and T.P. Wiseman, Catullus and his World (Cambridge 1985) 16 ff. stress the relevance of this evidence, but the objection has gone unheeded. 29 The sons of Pulcher and Nepos being fratres: Cic. Att. 4.3.4; Har. 45; Dom. 7 and Cael. 60 (in the latter case with the specification patrueli); the MSS warrant for this latter reading, but R.G. Austin ad loc. and TLL 10.1 col. 792 follow Munzer in regarding patrueli as a gloss. 30 On the Claudians and adoption, Tac. Ann. 12.25.2 quotes the periti and Suet. Claud. 39</page><page sequence="11">Dreams, Religion and Politics in Republican Rome 63 But whatever the correct alternative, one thing seems certain: if the cousins were in fact paternal, their stemma does not need a daughter of Baliaricus in order to cohere. Of course Cicero only calls the brothers patrueles once; normally, he manages without the adjective. In view of the prosopographical difficulties, editors have therefore chosen to discard the isolated patruelis as a gloss. Yet even if it is, the proposed interpretation remains valid. A frater (in the sense cousin) is always paternal. However, the assumption of a gloss admits an alternative scenario. If Nepos and Pulcher had been married to the same woman, their sons would also have beenfratres, but now in the sense half-brothers (fratres uterini) - and according to prosopographical experts this solution (which completely rules out Metella since she could not have married her brother) fits the data equally well.31 Either way, everything suggests that the visionary Metella was a spinster, a daughter, niece and sister of Roman consuls, censors and highpriests; as I shall argue later on, this combination of aristocratic lineage and unmarried status probably counted in her favour when she approached the Senate on account of her dream (cf. p. 90 ff.). If, moreover (as indeed seems probable), this lady is identical with the person who saved the life of Cicero's client, Sextus Roscius, there are clear indications that she was very much her own; at least it is unusual in classical Latin that a woman is said to be endowed with that most masculine of virtues, virtus - but then, few men had mustered the courage it took to defy Sulla's minions.32 the family historian, the emperor Claudius; cf. D.R. Shackleton Bailey, art. cit. (n. 28) 149. Hence the suggestion by T.W. Hillard (quoted by T.P. Wiseman, op. cit. [n. 28] 18, n. 4) that Baliaricus adopted a brother of Pulcher. Metellus' cognomen Nepos has been interpreted as a reference to his grandfather, Macedonicus (Asc. Corn. 56 and I. Kajanto, The Latin Cognomina [Roma 198221 304), but with adoption one also acquired new grandfathers; cf. Ov. Fas. 1.10 (Augustus the avus of Germanicus). 31 Thus D.R. Shackleton Bailey, art. cit. (n. 28) 149 and T.P. Wiseman, op. cit. (n. 28) 16 ff. Plut. Cic. 26.6 quotes a rumour that Nepos' wife was unfaithful: did she leave Nepos to marry Pulcher? 32 cf. Cic. SRosc. 27, eius (sc. Caeciliae) virtute and 147, Caecilia ... spectatissimafemina, quae cum patrem clarissimum, amplissimos patruos, ornatissimum fratrem haberet, tamen, cum esset mulier, virtute perfecit, ut quanto honore ipsa ex illorum dignitate adficeretur, non minora illis ornamenta ex sua laude redderet; according to J. Carcopino, op. cit. (n. 27) 182, Cicero refers to Metella's almost saintly vertu, but parallels tell a different story: cf. W. Eisenhut, Virtus Romana (Munchen 1973) 108 and J. Sarsila, Some Aspects of the Concept of Virtus in Roman Literature (Jyvaskyla 1982) 33 on the virtutem etfortitudinem of Cicero's wife (Fam. 14.1.1); similarly, Curt. 9.6.23 (Semiramis as brave as men) and Tac. Germ. 18.4 (Germanic women have a share in their warrior husbands' virtus).</page><page sequence="12">64 PATRICK KRAGELUND Metella's conduct during the crisis of 90 BC was no less courageous. At Rome, her insistence on being a visionary with a political mission is without known precedent. For all the backing of her powerful relatives it seems a measure of her determination and prestige that the Senate - perhaps in the face of protests - took her dream so seriously. III Rome or Lanuvium? Metella's involvement in restoring a public sanctuary is yet a circumstance which highlights her prestige. But here again there are - if I am not mistaken - aspects of the evidence which need to be re-examined. The problem is the location of Juno's temple. Iulius Obsequens offers no obvious clues; and neither is it from Cicero immediately clear whether it was the old and famous sanctuary at Lanuvium33 or one of its urban counterparts (Livy refers to a temple in Forum Holitorium from 194 BC, Ovid to one on the Palatine).34 Despite this uncertainty, few scholars have hesitated to identify the sanctu- ary of Metella's dream with the temple in Forum Holitorium. Having later been incorporated in the medieval S. Nicola in Carcere next to the Theatre of Mar- cellus, the remnants of this temple remain a Roman landmark.35 33 Juno at Lanuvium: A.E. Gordon, The Cults of Lanuvium (Berkeley, California 1938); R.E.A. Palmer, Roman Religion and Roman Empire (Philadelphia 1974) 30-32; P. Chia- rucci, Lanuvium (Roma 1983) 55 ff. and F.

Briscoe ad loc.). For the Palatine sanctuary next to the Magna Mater the evidence is tenuous and perhaps confu- sed; in Ovid's day the temple no longer existed (Ov. Fas. 2.55-58) and scholars have suspected that the poet somehow got it wrong: K. Latte, op. cit. (n. 18) 168-169 and A. Ziolkowski, The Temples of Mid-Republican Rome and their Historical and Topographi- cal Context (Roma 1992) 77-79. Yet the fasti Antiates confirm the Ovidian foundation date as I February: ILLRP 9; by combining fragments of other fasti referring to the foundation of a temple for Juno (ad theatrum MaJRCELL(i) on 1 July, J. Rupke, ZPE 108 (1995) 119 ff. and F. Coarelli, "Iuno Sospita (in Foro Holitorio)" in: E.M. Steinby (ed.), Lex. topogr. urbis Romae 3 (1996) 129 make an interesting case for accepting Ovid's account. 35 The early commentaries to lulius Obsequens by T. Hearne (Oxford 1703) and by Scheffer and Oudendorph (I quote the ed. from 1772) say nothing about topography; while H. Jordan and C.

In my view a number of circumstances makes it far more reasonable to assume that the focus of interest was the old temple of Lanuvium, since 338 BC the joint sanctuary of Rome and her former Latin ally. First of all, Lanuvium was - according to Ovid - Juno's 'own', and cer- tainly one of the most venerable and prestigious Latin sanctuaries, with priest- hoods reaching back to times immemorial; its treasures were renowned and its fame reached far and wide, to Bithynia in the East and Spain in the West. Every year Rome's consuls went out to Lanuvium to sacrifice to Juno Sospita Mater Regina (as she was officially called), thereby confirming and renewing the old treaty. In times of crisis Lanuvium was, moreover, an important centre of prophe- cy. From the Second Punic War onwards it reported more prodigia than any other town in Italy - and of these the majority came from Juno's temple itself.36 The spear of Juno's cult statue was shaken, ravens flew into and even nested in her temple, her statue wept while others produced tears of blood and terrible sounds were heard.37 Reports from the city continued throughout the second century, and were still reckoned with in the first.38 In 99 BC Juno's 'chamber' was stained with blood, and on the eve of the Social War the haruspices received the report about the mice-gnawn silver shields.39 510 and G. Lugli, Roma antica (Roma 1946) 556 were uncertain whether to chose Rome or Lanuvium, G. Radke, Die GotterAltitaliens (Munster 1965) 206 was inclined to opt for the latter, but communis opinio favours the temple in Forum Holitorium: cf. e.g. G. Wissowa, Religion und Kultus der Romer (Munchen 1912) 188 n. 9; A.S. Pease, S. Timpanaro and G. Freyburger and J. Scheid (n. 25) ad Cic. Div. 1.4; Platner-Ashby s. v.; J. Carcopino, op. cit.

Even when due allowance is made for the fragmentary state of our knowledge, it is therefore a far more natural assumption that the sanctuary in question is the one at Lanuvium.40 This is by no means contradicted by Cicero and Obsequens. The latter may of course have been careless (or his text garbled), but when assessing the possible reasons for his silence, it should be remembered that he has already twice referred to prodigia from Sospita's temple at Lanuvium - most recently in 99 BC.41 When reporting a new portent from Juno Sospita in 90 BC, he would therefore (if consistent) only have needed a toponym, if the location were no longer the same. Similarly with Cicero. His failure to reveal the location of the temple may of course be a lapse (the dialogue was composed in a hurry), but, then, he may also have considered such specification superfluous. Many of his readers are anyway bound to have known its whereabouts; if not, they would (one suspects) automatically assume that he was referring to Sospita's most famous abode. Far from endorsing the identification with Juno's urban temple, the lack of topo- nym is therefore yet a circumstance which favours the candidacy of Lanuvi- Um.42 So, I believe, does a passage in Cicero's De natura deorum, which in this context has been strangely neglected. The passage in question refers to the appearance of Juno's cult statue - an aspect on which it is natural that Cicero should have been well informed: from early on he had friends and connections at Lanuvium, the patria of his revered teacher, Aelius Stilo. In the De finibus he further recalls the knight Lucius Thorius Balbus - a fine and brave man, at the same time a refined voluptuary and a sceptic, who viewed the sacrifices and sanctuaries of his home-town with contempt (an affinity to the Epicureans has been suspected). However, when becoming moneyer for the republic, Balbus acknowledged his patriotic duty. His coins from 105 BC (the year of the Cimbrian panic) display Lanuvium's goddess, with her characteristic goat-skin helmet.43 Other moneyers (presuma- there was a pulvinar and a cenaculum Lanuvii apud aedem Iunonis, R.E.A.

In this dialogue another of his early acquaintances from Lanuvium, Gaius Velleius (the leading Roman Epicurean of the time) faithfully defends one of his master's most controversial ideas, namely that the gods are universally accepted to be anthropomorphic. This, of course, is poor anthropology, and Velleius' opponent, the pontifex Cotta, has a field day enumerating the stones, cats, crocodiles and cows venerated by the Egyptians and others. To bring home his argument, Cotta compares the Egyptian respect for the Apis with Velleius' for his home-town goddess, illam vestram Sospitam, Juno Sospita from Lanuvi- um. According to Cotta, Velleius would never - 'not even in dreams' (in somnis) - see this Juno 'unless equipped with goat-skin, spear buckler and slippers turned up at the toe'.45 Cotta's main point is clear, but his reference to dreams may at first seem puzzling. According to the Epicureans such nocturnal visions are of course one of the sources for man's knowledge of the gods. However, Cotta does not seem to be referring to a hypothetical event or lofty philosophical principle, but rather to a familiar episode: This was - as everyone knew - how Juno from Lanuvium looked, even in dreams.46 Now, there may of course have been other such epiphanies, but Metella's is the only dream on record which figures Juno Sospita as a protagonist - and in its own day (the dialogue takes place in the early 70s BC) it was doubtless renowned. After all, few dreams had been the subject of senatorial debate. And since Velleius came from Lanuvium, it is natural to assume that it is indeed to this episode that the witty pontifex is referring. sopography of Roman Epicureans (Frankfurt 19912) 1 1 1 questions Balbus' membership - but even if Balbus seems to have been far from orthodox, Fin. 2.64 implies an affinity of sorts. 44 Sospita on coins: M.H.

H. Rackham, Loeb). 46 On Cic. NatD. 1.82 as a possible reference to the Epicurean theory of spontaneous epiphany, see Pease ad loc. ('perhaps'); but, surely, Epicurus' carefree gods had no need for spear, shield and slippers.</page><page sequence="16">68 PATRICK KRAGELUND The plural in somnis is no obstacle: in Cicero's dialogues (as indeed else- where) this is more often than not equivalent to the singular.47 And the refer- ence to the statue's appearance may well be a further clue. In the account of her dream Metella is bound to have mentioned how she identified the god-dess, the standard method being to invoke the similarity with the sacred statue of a sanctuary.48 In short, all the evidence points to Lanuvium - and so does the immediate historical context; at least it is on this assumption easier to understand why the Senate took the dream so seriously. In the history of Roman religion, Lanuvium holds an important position. Not only were legends current, which linked the origins of Lanuvium and Rome (according to Fabius Pictor the Latin city was founded by Lanoios, an 'ally' of Aeneas and Ascanius), but Juno's great sanctuary was itself a symbol of the links between the two communities: in fact, its peculiar joint status was part of the renowned legislation of 338 BC when the Senate, after the defeat of the Latin League, granted her former ally Roman citizenship. By becoming the common responsibility of Rome and Lanuvium, the cult gave the new political foedus a religious dimension. Each year, when the consuls went out from Rome to sacrifice to Juno, the legendary treaty of Aeneas and Lanoios was, as it were, renewed - and the singular importance which the Senate attached to portents occurring at Lanuvium illustrates how high Juno Sospita ranked among the powers whose support the Fathers considered vital. When Hannibal in 218 BC threatened to break up the unity of Rome and her Latin allies, the Senate would for instance vote Juno Sospita a gift of massive gold, which at the time was only outweighed by the one presented to Jupiter Capitolinus in the spring of 217. In 90 BC the old alliances between Rome and her allies were once again put to the test. Now the issue of citizenship was back on the political agenda, indeed it was central to the war now breaking out. During the previous summer, a fierce debate focusing on the legal and political distinction between the citizens of Rome and the allied communities had raged, thereby adding fuel to existing discontent. The Italians felt discriminated against, and so, apparently, did some of the Latins. Tension had escalated when a conspiracy was detected to assassi- nate Rome's consuls during the Latin festival on the Alban Mount.

At one extreme there were the hardliners insisting that senators favouring the Italian demands be prosecuted as traitors, but in the end it was the opposite strategy that prevailed. Without her Latin and Italian allies Rome risked losing everything. It was better, therefore, to compromise by offering Roman citizenship not only to the Latins, but also to the allies still honouring their allegiance (or sitting on the fence waiting to see how things turned out).50 When this policy of accommodation finally prevailed is uncertain (early autumn 90 seems likely), but it is tempting to assume that its advocates were strongly represented among those who voted that Lucius Caesar should restore Juno's sanctuary to its former glory. After all, the goddess' chief sanctuary was itself a monument to the very policy of extending Roman citizenship which was now readopted. The treaty of 338 BC had proved a success; now Rome reached out to ensure the goodwill of the goddess who had been central to the original settlement and from whose sanctuary prodigies had always been expiated with care. On this view Lucius Caesar's restoration of Juno's temple represented a way of ensuring divine sanction for the policy of compromise codified by the same consul's lex Iulia de civitate. Equally, the efforts to appease the divine Saviour (this was what Sospita commonly was taken to mean) would of course have served to sustain public morale - and this was badly needed, in Rome no less than among her Latin allies. Throughout Italy, Latin colonies were under siege, some were captured and one defected. At such a juncture, Metella's vision offered a glimpse of hope: Had not Juno, despite her anger, given in to Metella's entreaties and agreed not to abandon her ancient stronghold, high above the southern border of Latium Vetus? 49 Fabius Pictor and Lanuvium: SEG 26 (1976-77) 1123 (an inscription from Taormina); the legend a reflection of the foedus of 338: G.

To answer these questions is, for a number of reasons, far from simple. Beginning with the urban sites, it is, first of all, uncertain whether there were one or two such sanctuaries in Rome. On the Palatine, Ovid knew a temple of Juno Sospita, but this had by then long fallen into disuse; of this structure faint traces may recently have been detected, but they seem to offer no information that is relevant here. Better documented is the temple of Juno Sospita in the Forum Holitorium, but here too identity is by no means certain: in fact all three temples once facing onto the Forum, and now incorporated in the church of San Nicola in Carcere, have at some point during this century been identified as Juno's; and even if the current candidate seems plausible, certainty on this point may well prove unobtainable.51 The same applies to the traces of an early first century restoration (which naturally has been one of the criteria for identification). Here too, solid evi- dence is in either case hard to obtain. On the Palatine the remains are far too scanty, and in the Forum Holitorium, the situation is not much better. The most recent investigation dates the extant remains to the Augustan period, when all three temples appear to have been rebuilt; beneath two of them are traces of previous structures which roughly seem datable to the third or second century BC. A fragmentary inscription which was found near the church suggests that Hadrian restored the temples after a fire, but of an early first century restoration there is - arguably - no visible trace. Others argue for a pre-augustan rebuilding of the central as well as northern temples and suggest that this (dual?) interven- tion is what Cicero and Obsequens refer to - but either way the evidence seems inconclusive.52 51 Sospita on the Palatine: n. 34; L. Crozzoli Aite, op. cit. (n. 22) 116 ff. sets out the doxography concerning the possible occupants of the three temples of Forum Holitorium: the northernmost was favoured as Juno's by DelbrUck, the southernmost by Platner- Ashby, Hulsen, Castagnoli and Coarelli; the latter subsequently opted for the central temple - as did Frank, Blake, Lugli, Gros and Crozzoli Aite herself. 52 Hadrianic restoration: CIL 6.979 = 40521 (with comments by G. Alfoldy). Date of the early temples and vain attempts to find traces of an early first century restoration: L. Crozzoli Aite, op. cit. (n. 22) 103 ff. By contrast, P. Gros, Aurea templa (Roma 1976) 1 1 1-1 12 considers the rebuilding of the central and northern temple 'proto-august6enne'; the former (and by implication the latter) is then dated to 90 BC by reference to Cicero and Obsequens; similarly, P. Innocenti, "1I Foro Olitorio", in: F. Coarelli et al., Roma</page><page sequence="19">Dreams, Religion and Politics in Republican Rome 71 Lanuvium provides a much clearer picture. The head of a huge acrolith (cult?)statue as well as an inscription referring to 'Juno's porticus' (PORTIC(u)/ ... IVN(onis)) confirms beyond reasonable doubt to whom the sanctuary be- longed. Its chronology is likewise easier to establish. The site has yielded evidence of three building phases, of which the first seems to reach back to the sixth and fifth centuries BC and the second to the fourth and third century (probably coinciding with the treaty of 338 BC).53 For the rebuilding of the third phase, which is what matters here, there is neither a secure terminus post nor ante, but it seems clear that the site saw great activity during the last century of the Republic (dates vary from the end of the second and beginning of the first century down to the fifties BC).54 Within this timespan scholarly attention has focused on indications that Lucullus and his lieutenant from Lanuvium, Lucius Licinius Murena (cos. 62 BC) were responsible not only for rebuilding the temple, which during this third phase was surrounded by spacious terraces and faced with a stretch of porticoes 100 m long, but also for the dedication of a great number of statues, which have been found on the site. However, the evidence for the involvement of Murena and Lucullus is at best circumstantial and at worst not even that. An inscription (OMVRENN = [licini]O MVRENNA[e] ?) found on the site may of course refer to 'our' Murena (Lanuvium's first consul), but his grandfather and father had been praetors, the latter earning himself a triumph.55 By contrast, there is - despite claims to the contrary - no evidence to show that Murena's general, Lucullus, was also involved in the project.56 repubblicana dal 270 A.C. all'eta augustea (Roma 1987) 19 (without reference to Crozzoli Aite) and F.

In politics as well as in war he had earned a name for himself, so it is indeed unlikely that his res gestae would have gone unnoticed in his hometown. But monumental praise, be it in the form of inscriptions or honorific statues, is one thing, rebuilding and redecorating a state sanctuary quite another. A fruitful idea can sometimes be taken too far. The arguments for dating the porticoes facing the temple to the sixties BC are for instance not implausible, but neither are they cogent. There are, to be sure, similarities with the quasi- reticulatum from Pompey's theatre (61-55 BC), but given the fluid chronology for the Roman building techniques of the early first century BC, this is, at best, merely a broad terminus ante.57 Secondly, it seems problematic that the written sources are so reticent about Murena's putative involvement - and in this particular case this is a serious difficulty, since Cicero's speech from 62 BC provides such detailed knowledge about Murena's public career. His bravery as an officer in Asia, his generosity towards provincials, the splendour of his ludi at Rome - Cicero enumerates everything laudable, but, strangely, he has nothing to say about Juno's temple. In fact, Juno only appears in the peroratio, where Cicero prays that the consul from Lanuvium may be allowed to bring her Rome's customary sacrifice - which seems meagre, if Murena was in fact responsible for rebuilding her entire sanctuary.58 Of course, the rebuilding may have commenced soon after - but this is where the argument turns circular. Rather than proceeding along those lines, it therefore seems sounder to acknowledge, firstly, that while there is no positive evidence supporting Murena's candidacy, the Senate is on the other hand LVCV... (= Not. Scav. 1884, 239 = CIL 12, 2978a) refers to Lucullus. The inscription is no longer extant, but CIL notes that the excavator subsequently changed the reading to AIM...! IVCV... (= J. Savile Lumley, Archaeologia 49,2 [London 1886] 377). Hence, of course, unease; and even if LVCV were correct, it might - as argued by T.P. Wiseman, Gnomon 61 (1989) 279 (reviewing F. Coarelli, Santuari In. 331) - just as well refer to luno's sacred grove (Liv. 8.14.2, aedes lucusque Sospitae lunonis); cf. A. Keaveney, Lucullus (London/New York 1992) 136 and 0. Salomies, art. cit. (n. 55) 61. 57 According to F. Coarelli, art. cit. (n. 33) 232 the quasi-reticulatum employed at Lanuvium is 'assai vicino a quello del teatro di Pompeo', but 'assai' is an elastic term, and so, apparently, were technical developments (cf. e.g. F. Coarelli, Santuari [n. 33] 93 ff.); the possible range of divergences is well illustrated by the quasi-reticulatum of the urban Horrea Galbana, some twenty years prior to the opus mixtum employed at Hercules Victor in Tibur (according to F. Coarelli, Santuari [n. 331 97 securely datable to the 80s BC). 58 According to F. Coarelli, art. cit. (n. 33) 252 Cicero presents not only the citizens of Lanuvium but also Juno as 'clientes del console designato', yet this is not what Cicero says. On the contrary he stresses Murena's devotional links to the goddess of his home- town: nolite a sacris patriis lunonis Sospitae, cui omnes consules facere necesse est, domesticum et suum consulem potissimum avellere, Mur. 90.</page><page sequence="21">Dreams, Religion and Politics in Republican Rome 73 known to have initiated restoration of a temple of Juno Sospita in 90 BC; and secondly, that since everything indicates that the senatus consultum referred to Lanuvium, it may well prove significant that this sanctuary underwent spectac- ular, large scale reconstruction in what seems to be the relevant timespan. Here too there are, of course, uncertainties. A reexamination of the site and a clearer outline of its stratigraphy is badly needed. It should, however, be noted that from what has hitherto been found there is nothing which precludes the proposed chronology. Even if one accepts that reconstruction commenced in 90 BC, the project is after all unlikely to have progressed far before Lucius Caesar was murdered and the troops of Marius occupied Lanuvium.59 Like other Alban cities along the Via Appia, Lanuvium was at the mercy of the armies of the Civil War (advancing on Rome, rebel Samnites camped in the area in late 82), but with Sulla's victory and the return of peace, the restoration of the sanctuary was presumably resumed. Which is where Metella, finally, comes in. When Cicero spoke in defense of Sextus Roscius in 79 BC, she was apparently as powerful and active as ever. There is therefore nothing which speaks against her involvement in a project which anyway seems datable to this period. Indeed, it can be argued that Livy by no means is the sole evidence for a link between Metella and Lanuvium: there also seem to be traces in situ. During excavations of Juno's temple at Lanuvium in the 1 880s, one of the most spectacular finds was that of the marble fragments of at least eight almost life- size equestrian statues. These fragments, which are now distributed between the British Museum and the City Museum in Leeds, seem datable to the period between late second and mid-first century, but a case can also be made for a narrower timespan, with a date in the first half of the first century BC. Despite differences in detail, it is generally agreed that the sculptures are the work of the same workshop. And even if other explanations cannot be excluded, clothing and style suggest that the ensemble represented a Greek squadron.60 Hence the plausible inference that the group was inspired by Lysippus' famous bronze group representing Alexander the Great and his 25 mounted guardsmen.6' 59 Marius at Lanuvium in 87: Liv.

In 73 BC Lucul- lus defeated king Mithridates' army at or near the legendary river Granikos, where Alexander defeated Darius some 250 years earlier.63 Admittedly, this Roman victory was far from decisive, and the great antagonist Mithridates did not actually take part in the battle, but in distant Italy such details may not have mattered; far-fetched coincidences were anyway the raw stuff of much pane- gyric. Moreover, since other Roman generals favoured imitatio Alexandri (with Pompey as the great example), the idea is not a priori implausible.64 Of course, Lucullus seems easier to cast in the role as a new Alexander than Murena, who fought as a mere legatus, but since there is no sign that Lucullus was involved in restoring Juno's temple, scholars now tend to settle for his deputy.65 However, if it was in fact this temple which the Senate in 90 BC decided to restore, a different - and by no means less plausible - scenario suggests itself. On this reading the dedication is a grand statement of dynastic pride, intended to commemorate Roman victory, not in Macedonian style but over Macedonia herself. For it was the grandfather of Metella who had conquered Macedonia. The victory of Macedonicus (as he was subsequently called) was an event in 61 J. Bergemann, op. cit. (n. 60) 78 accepts that Lysippos' turma Alexandri might be the model, but would not exclude other possibilities; the uniform style and Greek dress are according to F. Coarelli, M.L. Gualandi and G. Calcani decisive (the position is summari- zed by the latter in the catalogue Lisippo. L'arte e la Fortuna [Roma 1995] 148 ff.). B. Sismondo Ridgway, Hellenistic Sculpture I (Bristol 1990) 120 describes the group as 'a reflection of the Granikos monument' and A. Stewart, Faces of Power. Alexander's Image and Hellenistic Politics (Berkeley/Los Angeles 1993) 123 ff. agrees that this is perhaps the model. 62 The original setting at Dion is well evoked by G. Calcani, op. cit. (n. 60) 19 ff. and A. Stewart, op. cit. (n. 61) 128 ff.; as emphasized by the latter, the group seems originally to have included statues of Alexander's infantry. 63 Lucullus at Granikos: F.

From then onwards a Macedonian shield would from time to time adorn the coins of the Metelli.66 More than anyone it was, however, Macedonicus himself who ensured that his victory would never be forgotten. Near the Circus Flaminius in Rome he built a porticus enclosing a sacred precinct, thereby introducing an architectural form which forever changed Rome's urban landscape. A long family tradition for piety (an ancestor risked his life when saving the sacred image of Vesta from her burning temple) was here combined with hellenistic magnificence. The complex included an all- marble temple, allegedly the first in Rome. Here the trophies of Metellan victory were set out for all to see. Among these trophies Lysippus' statues portraying Macedonia's finest soldiers and greatest general seem to have occu- pied the place of honour.67 At some point, presumably during the first century BC, Juno's hilltop temple above Lanuvium was given a layout which in a significant respect was very similar. Here too, the sanctuary was adorned with lifesize statues of Alexander and his companions. Who dedicated these statues is unknown, but if the first century date is correct, two circumstances may well be pertinent. The group of sculptures would not only have recalled the finest trophy which Macedonicus brought home from Macedonia - a fact which in itself seems to give the whole decorative scheme a Metellan stamp - but virtually all the fragments were found in the ruined porticoes of the very temple, which the sources suggest that his visionary granddaughter had been involved in restor- ing. V Republican Dreamers, from Fabius Pictor to Sulla But it is time to leave Lanuvium and address the wider issues raised by the evidence concerning Metella and her dream. Two problems seem central. Prior to this incident, how did Senate, priests and historians handle such portents? And, more generally, what was the role of dreams and dreamers in the religious 66 Metellan coins with Macedonian symbols: M.H. Crawford, RRC no. 263.1-5b and 369.1 (127 and 82-80 BC). 67 Paradigmatic status of the Metellan porticus: J. Isager, Pliny on Art and Society (London 1991) 160 (with bibliography); in its Augustan rebuilding, Lysippus' statues faced the temples: Vell. 1.1 1.3-5 with discussion in G. Calcani, op. cit. (n. 60) 155 f.; at Lanuvium virtually all the fragments were found in the ruins of and beneath the square and porticus to the west of the ancient road traversing the temple enclosure: F. Coarelli, art. cit. (n. 33) 233. So far, no epigraphic evidence suggests a link between the Metelli and Lanuvium: ILLRP 170 is an early dedication to Juno by one Q. Caecilius, the LEIBERTVS of Gnaeus and Aulus Caecilius as well as of Q. Flaminius, but Gnaeus and Aulus are not attested as Metellan praenomina: RE 5 (1897) "Caecilius" nr. 10.</page><page sequence="24">76 PATRICK KRAGELUND and political life of the republic, roughly from the Second Punic War down to Sulla? When we survey the relevant evidence, one fact seems immediately strik- ing. Unlike many other Mediterranean cultures, early Rome can boast of few illustrious dreamers. Not that the temple of Juno Sospita was the only sanctuary in or around Rome which owed its existence or appearance to a dream. Such legends were well attested at the temple of Fortuna in Praeneste; and visitors to the temple of the Penates in Lavinium68 as well as to sanctuaries of Hercules Victor69 heard similar tales. But from Rome itself the evidence is meagre and obscure. While the Latin sanctuaries could invoke the dreams of Aeneas and a Samnite noble named Numerius Suffustius (Suffucius?), the origin of the urban sanctuaries and festivals is remarkably modest: the prostitute Acca Larentina, a low born rusticus (who in some sources is anonymous), the children of Valesius (the legendary ancestor of gens Valeria), and dreamers unknown.70 68 Praeneste: Cic. Div. 2.85 (a honestum hominem et nobilem named Numerius is in dreams told to excavate the cult image). Lavinium: Dion. Hal. 1.56.5-57.1 (a dream makes Aeneas sacrifice where the sanctuary of the Penates later was built). 69 According to the Augustan jurist, Masurius Sabinus (= Macr. Sat. 3.6.9 and Serv. ad Verg. Aen. 8.363) Hercules once helped the merchant M. Octavius Herrenus (Serv.: Hersennus) in a battle against pirates; on account of a dream Herrenus later built victorious Hercules a temple. Hence the cognomen 'Victor'. Macrobius and Servius use this story to explain why Virgil called Hercules 'Victor', and they also seem to relate it to one of Hercules' urban sanctuaries, be it the temple ad portam Trigeminam, or the one in foro Boario - but on this latter issue they may well be mistaken. Firstly, because there are strong indications that the story originated in Tibur, the seat of the great sanctuary of Hercules Victor: Macrobius (3.12.7) quotes one Octavius Hersennus who wrote a study on Hercules at Tibur (cf. S. Weinstock, RE 62 [1936] 828). And secondly, because the legend is highly unlikely to be relevant for the study of the Roman state cult. Given the prestige attached to temple foundations it is a priori doubtful that a flute player turned merchant would be granted permission to found an urban temple in the late second century BC (pace F. Coarelli, ll Foro Boario [Roma 1988] 182 ff. who opts for the 120s BC.). At Rome public altars and temples were founded according to all sorts of complex rules, but always, apparently, by a magistrate with imperium or by duoviri elected for the purpose and always DE SENA(tus) SEN(tentia), ILLRP 269 (122 BC) or IVSSV POPVLI ROMANI, ILLRP 409 (ca. 42 BC); cf. Cic. Dom. 136 on episodes in 154 and 123 BC. Herrenus was clearly a privatus, and, if at all historical, his 'victory' over the pirates belongs in the same category. Nothing debarred a privatus from obtaining a lot on which to build a temple from the magistrates (impetrato a magistratibus loco), but such a sanctuary would apparently still be p r i v a t e. It is therefore not to be identified with the p u b I i c sanctuary for Hercules ad portam Trigeminam: A. Ziolkowski, "Mummius' Temple of Hercules Victor and the Round Temple on the Tiber", Phoenix 42 (1988) 324 ff.; 332 ff. Contra (but without meeting the objections) F.

In the hellenistic East, the dreams of the great and famous had long since become commonplace. But on this issue Rome proved remarka- bly resistant, not - it will here be argued - owing to ignorance, but to choice.71 Rome's political and religious structure had no place for such visions, the problem being that dreams are such an exclusively personal experience. In a state religion characterized by mutual and collective control and by the strict division of competences - between magistrates and assemblies, and between the Senate and the various priestly colleges - there was no clear role for the inspired visions of individual prophets. Such prophecies were only taken into account if there seemed to be no alternative.72 This is the lesson to be drawn from a legend which few republican histori- ans, from Fabius Pictor onwards, failed to repeat; indeed the story is known in more than a dozen versions, a fact which in itself seems to confirm its paradig- matic status.73 In these versions details vary - such as the date of the incident (491 BC in the vulgate tradition, 280 in Macrobius), the number of dreams and even the name of its protagonist (in Cicero he is anonymous; Livy and others call him Titus Latinius; Macrobius, Titus Annius) - but the basic story line remains identical, which is what matters here. In the main, it will therefore suffice to summarize the version of Cicero, who draws upon three second-century historians.74 In dreams a 'man of the Aug. Civ. 6.7.10 are alone in claiming that his epiphany was in a dream; cf. n. 85. The rusticus: n. 74. According to Lact. Defalsa religione 1.20, the Capitoline Ara lovi pistori was inspired by a collective dream (quod eos in quiete monuisset [sc. Jupiter]), but neither Ov. Fas. 6.349 ff., Liv. 5.50 nor Val. Max. 7.4.3 mentions this. According to Val. Max. 2.4.5 the ludi saeculares were instituted on account of the dream of Valesius' three infants. This legend may well be ancient (H.S. Versnel, "Die neue Inschrift von Satri- cum", Gymnasium 89 [1982] 217 ff.) but Valerius Maximus (who had a natural interest in Valerian genealogy) admits that it was 'rarely attested' (minus trita notitia). 71 Roman familiarity with the dreams of the Greeks: n. 2 (epic and drama); 3 (foundation myths) 4 (historiography); dreams were also prominent in the contemporary lives and legends of Rome's great antagonist, Hannibal (n. 4). 72 The division of religious power and competence is well brought out by M. Beard, "Priesthood in the Roman Republic", in M. Beard &amp; J. North (edd.), Pagan Priests. Religion and Power in the Ancient World (London 1990) 30 ff. 73 Dream of the ludi: Fabius Pictor, fr. 15P, Coelius Antipater, fr. 49P and Gellius, fr. 21P (all quoted by Cic.

Chassignet [ed.], L'annalistique</page><page sequence="26">78 PATRICK KRAGELUND people' (a rusticus) is told to tell the Senate that Jupiter was displeased with the ludi that had just been celebrated in his honour. But the man refuses. 'He dared not' (non esse ausum), says Cicero. This angers the god, and the dreams turn menacing, but still the man dares not (ne tum quidem esse ausum). Then his son dies, and in a third75 dream the god repeats his command. By now the poor man is crippled and, in desperation, confesses to his friends what is wrong. They persuade him to address the Senate. He does so, is instantly healed, rises from his litter, and walks home. This miraculous recovery impressed the Senate; and since it clearly con- firmed the man's story, the senators accepted the dream's message (somnio comprobato) and gave orders that the games be repeated; but first a double- check was made in order to determine when and how the error had been committed. This often repeated legend throws an interesting light on the status of dreams at Rome. All its versions agree, firstly, that, in order to be accepted, dreams needed secondary confirmation. A case in point is the recovery of the dreamer which, in Livy's phrase, was a 'further miracle' (aliud miraculurn)76 - and with dreams, such additional corroboration was apparently always neces- sary. If the gods would not by themselves provide such confirmation, tradition- al divination might serve as an alternative.77 Hence Obsequens' emphasis (cf. p. 59) on the evidence proving that Juno's temple in fact had been polluted: this confirmed a message which on its own carried insufficient weight. romaine I [Paris 1996] ad loc.): By 43 BC Coelius was, surely, not the most recent study on the origin of the ludi; in any case Coelius seems to have had a foible for dreams: cf. fr. 11, 34 and 50P = Cic. Div. 1.49, 48 and 56 (two of Hannibal's and one of Gaius Gracchus'). 75 On repetition of dreams, see the hellenistic inscriptions quoted by R. Merkelbach, "Zwei Texte aus dem Sarapeum zu Thessalonike", ZPE 10 (1973) 51-52 and F.T. van Straten, art. cit. (n. 48) 15 f. There are close parallels in the foundation myth of Praeneste, where the gods in 'frequent dreams, which finally turned menacing' (somniis crebris, ad extremum etiam minacibus), insisted on Numerius' digging for the sacred image; this was well attested (monumenta declarant, Cic. Div. 2.85), whether from written memorials or inscriptions (thus A.S. Pease ad loc.); invoking Etruscorum declarant ... libri (Div. 1.72), J. Champeaux, Fortuna. La culte de Fortune a Rome et dans le monde romain (Roma 1982) 73, n. 219 opted ('sans doute') for the latter, but a passage like eodem monumento declarari, Phil. 14.35.1 (of an inscription) confirms that inscriptions are at least equally likely. 76 Liv. 2.36.8; miracula is sometimes used as almost equivalent to omina or prodigia: 1.36.5; 22.17.6 and 24.10.10. 77 For the use of sacrifices and extispiction to confirm the message of dreams, see n. 81. For the gods providing additional information, the locus classicus is the sow with piglets confirming the prophecy of Aeneas' dream = Fabius Pictor, fr. 4P; Cato, Orig. fr. 13 (Schr6der); Verg.

That the dream of a mere commoner should have any public relevance seemed utterly improbable - even to the dreamer himself. Such emphasis on status was not, of course, peculiar to Rome. From Homer onwards antiquity was obsessed with questions of hierarchy, when asleep no less than when awake.78 In principle only men of importance could have im- portant dreams, but in practice neither commoners, women nor slaves could be wholly discarded. In early republican Rome, however, such was the system of checks and balances that even the dreams of magistrates with imperium needed due corroboration. This is at least what one of the legends concerning the consul of 340 BC, Publius Decius Mus, seems to imply. Of this legend two versions are known. The first is preserved by Cicero, who vaguely refers to early historians (in annalibus), according to whom Decius displayed extreme courage when serving as military tribune in the mid- 340s. When warned not to risk his life, he had invoked a dream: He would die in battle thereby achieving great glory; which was what happened some years later, when his devotio ensured Roman victory over the Latins. While ignoring this early dream, Livy offers a far more dramatic version which clearly is indebted to a poet or historian with antiquarian interests. The detailed rendering of the ritual of devotio is a showpiece - which, incidentally, reflects interestingly on attitudes to dreams. The dream now occurs immediate- ly prior to the devotio, and is - unusually - sent to Decius as well as his consular colleague, Titus Manlius Torquatus. Both dreamt of 'a man of superhuman stature and majesty' (species viri maioris quam pro humano habitu augustioris- que) who told that 'the general on one side and the army on the other were due as an offering to the gods of the Underworld and to Mother Earth'. Yet despite this impressive unanimity the consuls did not consider their dreams sufficiently reliable. Once again, control was necessary, and for purpos- es of corroboration, nothing could apparently compete with traditional extispi- cation. Victims were slaughtered in order to avert the anger of the gods and, at the same time, to check 'if the signs indicated by the entrails coincided with what they had seen in their dream' (si extis eadem, quae somnio visa fuerant, portenderentur).79 Only when the entrails were seen to 'conform' (congruerunt) 78 cf. Hom. Il. 2.80-82 (Nestor accepts the importance of Agamemnon's dream, because he is the 'first among the Greeks') - a passage which Artemidorus from Daldis quotes with approval: as a rule humble persons cannot dream about great affairs (1.2); cf. n. 106 and A.J.

Hereby Decius Mus established a family tradition, with his son and grandson following the lead, but in neither case are dreams known to have influenced the course of events; and the insistence on using traditional divination to control what both consuls had dreamt illustrates that the dreams anyway were of secondary importance - even when backed by both consuls.81 Of course the story about Decius is more legend than history. While some dismiss it entirely, regarding it as an ex post facto elaboration which reflects and expands the narratives of subsequent devotiones, the prominence given to a pontifex named Valerius suggests that someone close to the gens Valeria has been at work to magnify the family's exploits.82 Yet for all its antiquarian embellishment, the legend still seems to reflect traditional attitudes. No matter how impressive, dreams needed corroboration - at least when outside the private sphere. The indications are that this was for centuries the prevalent attitude (at least there is no evidence suggesting the opposite). At Rome, a p r i v a t e person could consult an interpreter or interpretress of dreams, raise a dedication 'on account of a dream', be miraculously healed and perhaps even obtain divine advice, but such practices had no natural place in the conduct of p u b I i c business.83 80 cf. Val. Max. 1.7.3, congruerunt; at De vir. ill. 26.4 the narrative is further abridged, but the consuls still 'compare their dreams' (collato cum collega somnio); at Zon. 7.26 they first debate whether the dream comes from the gods. 81 On the Decii, see e.g. L. Deubner, "Die Devotion der Decier", ARW 8 (1905) 66 ff. (= Kleine Schriften zur klassischen Altertumskunde [Konigstein 19821 47 ff.) and S.P. Oakley, A Commentary on Livy Books VI - X (Oxford 1998) ad loc.; according to D.S. Levene, Religion in Livy (Leiden 1993) 221 the 'confirmatory sacrifice' serves to stress 'the piety of the consuls' - but that is, surely, only half the story. As parallels, S.P. Oakley ad 8.6.11 quotes the sacrifices at Aesch. Pers. 176 ff.; Soph. El. 634 ff. and Plut. Caes. 63.9-12, but the difference is that the Greeks sacrifice in order to avert the evil announced by a dream, the Roman to check its reliability. 82 The pontifex Valerius (Liv. 8.9.4): E.T. Salmon, Samnium and the Samnites (Cambridge 1967) 207; the fragments of Valerius Antias merely offer one parallel, a feigned dream from the first book of his history: Origo gentis Romanae 19.4. From verbal parallels Ch. Guittard, "Tite-Live, Accius et le rituel de la devotio", CRAI (1984) 581 ff. argues that Livy's account stems from Accius' praetexta on a subsequent devotio, but even if the parallels are suggestive, they may well be accidental. Ennius certainly described a devotio (fr. 191 ff. Sk.) - but it seems uncertain which of the classic three: T.J. Cornell, JRS 76 (1986) 248 f. 83 The three cippi, CIL 12, 2844-46 may stem from an archaic dream oracle, perhaps that of Faunus in Verg. Aen. 7.81 ff. (cf. e.g. R.E.A. Palmer, op. cit. [n. 331 79 ff.), but the epi- graphical evidence says nothing precise about dreams and the literary is late. However,</page><page sequence="29">Dreams, Religion and Politics in Republican Rome 81 There are, to be sure, exceptions - but only of the kind which prove the rule. During the Second Punic War magistrates are in two cases said to have insisted on the importance of their dreams, not only for themselves but for all. The timing is in both cases important. With Hannibal ad portas, Rome was in the grip of panic, religious and otherwise. During these years soothsayers pros- pered, prophecies circulated, and at one point crowds gathered in the Forum and on the Capitol, not to celebrate the ancestral rituals, but new and foreign ones. The Senate made frantic efforts to keep the situation under control, suppressing some such manifestations, but allowing the introduction of others; still, the period was for more than a decade characterized by religious upheaval.84 In this charged atmosphere it should cause no surprise that two exceptional and headstrong commanders chose to discard the traditional division between public and private and started talking openly of their dreams as of relevance for all; and it seems equally understandable if this sudden emphasis on outstanding individuals led to the emergence of a new, more personal type of dream; at least it is noteworthy that the impersonal spectres seen by previous visionaries now give way to stories of far more direct encounters, with the spectres of the dead or with the gods themselves.85 The least renowned of the early Roman visionaries is Lucius Marcius, the son of a Roman knight, whom the army in Spain elected as their commander, when their two generals, Lucius and Gnaeus Scipio had fallen in battle (211 BC). In this desperate situation Marcius proved a born leader, and even if his self-confidence displeased the Senate, a long line of second and first century annalists (Livy quotes Acilius, Claudius, Piso and Valerius Antias) are known to have magnified his exploits, with strong emphasis on the miraculous. Livy also seems to be relying on these predecessors when he presents Marcius haranguing his desperate men prior to a decisive attack on the Punic army (the Plaut. Curc. 245 ff. and Mil. 693 presuppose familiarity with the habit of consulting a dream coniector or coniectrix as well as incubation (the cult of Asclepius was introduced in 292 BC); the epigraphical evidence for republican dedications (ex] viso (thus CIL 12, 998) and somn(i)o monitus is slight (neither Dessau nor Degrassi would accept CIL 12, 1423 as republican), but this is probably accidental: Cicero (Dom. 140) refers to an altar dedicated somniis stimulatus as something familiar. 84 Prophets: Liv. 25.1.6-12; religion in the third decade: D.S. Levene, op. cit. (n. 81) 38 ff. (with bibliography). 85 The children of Valesius were healed by nescio quo deorum (Val. Max. 2.4.5) and in Coelius (quoted by Cicero, n. 74) Latinius saw a nameless spectre (visus est venire, qui); yet, in Livy, Valerius Maximus and Plutarch the latter dream features Jupiter himself; later versions continue to describe the vision of Manlius and Decius as a nameless 'man of superhuman stature and majesty' (n. 79); the story of Acca Larentina's dream about her night with Hercules is only known to late sources (n. 70); for spectres with a name, see n. 86 (the brothers Scipio); n. 92 (Neptune); n. 105 (Tiberius Gracchus); n. 13 (Sospita) and n. 117-118 (Ma-Bellona, Venus and Sulla's dead son, all seen by Sulla).</page><page sequence="30">82 PATRICK KRAGELUND early historians offered a similar scene). On this occassion Livy lets Marcius tell his comrades about an auspicious dream (some describe it as a vision, but this is not what Livy seems to say); and since dreams (as indeed visions) are so uncommon in Livy, this too is probably a traditional element. In Livy the reference is terse and sketchy. The army's fallen generals had appeared in Marcius' dreams, 'repeatedly' (saepe) waking him from his slum- ber. While exhorting Marcius not to allow their death to go unavenged, the Scipionic brothers had commanded him to follow their example in conducting the war.86 As told by Livy, Marcius' visions serve as an encouragement for the soldiers still lamenting the Scipios. Even if Marcius was an officer without imperium, his dreams confirmed that he somehow enjoyed the support of the fallen generals. But, according to Livy's predecessors, a (further?) miracle had at this point contributed to boost the army's morale: flames were seen above Marcius' head while he was still speaking (and the soldiers would have known this to be a propitious sign).87 Yet Livy was sceptical; indeed, his depiction of divine intervention in this episode is remarkably low-key, with Marcius admonishing his soldiers that the gods prefer helping those who help themselves. Still, the story of the flames was apparently so much part of the annalistic tradition that Livy had to explain why he chose to discard it. Not that these arguments convinced Valerius Maximus, who repeats the story without trace of doubt, but unfortunately 86 Marcius and the Senate: Liv. 26.2; his dreams: 25.38.5, Scipiones me ambo dies noctes- que curis insomniisque agitant et excitant saepe somno. Following Weissenborn-Muller, R.J. Getty, "Insomnia in the Lexica", AJPh 54 (1933) 15-16, F.G. Moore (Loeb, 1940), J. Feix (Tusculum, 1977), F. Nicolet-Croizat (Bud6, 1992) and Oxford Latin Dictionary s.v. translate insomniis as Schlaflosigkeit, 'sleeplessness', 'loss of sleep' or the like. Yet, as argued by V. Ussani, Insomnia. Saggio di critica semantica (Roma 1955) 54 ff. and TLL 7.1 col. 1938, a number of telling parallels speak against: Sen. Controv. 7.7.15, insomniis ... agitatum (a prophetic dream used for rhetorical effect); Curt. 3.3.2, anxium de instanti- bus curis agitabant etiam per somnum species imminentium rerum and Amm. 23.3.3, luliani quiescentis animus agitatus insomniis. If, moreover, Livy were describing a case of insomnia, with spectres appearing to Marcius in a vision rather than a dream, it is hard to see how these could then rouse him from his sleep (excitant saepe somno). Surely, insomniis ... agitant means that the Scipionic spectres 'haunt ... (Marcius') ... dreams' (A. de S6lincourt [Penguin 1965]; similarly, G. Stubler, Die Religiositat des Livius [Stuttgart 19411 141, V. Ussani, l.c. and TLL I-c.), commanding him (iubent) to ensure that they obtain revenge. 87 According to Liv. 25.39.12-16, Acilius, fr. 4P, Claudius Quadrigarius, fr. 57AP, Valerius Antias, fr. 23P and Piso, fr. 32P described the miracle as occurring while Marcius harangued (contionanti) the soldiers; Pliny, NH 2.241 confirms that Valerius Antias did so.</page><page sequence="31">Dreams, Religion and Politics in Republican Rome 83 Valerius does not say whether the sight of the propitious flames originally served to c o n f i r m what Marcius had told of his dreams.88 The charismatic Marcius therefore remains a dim figure. Although it seems plausible that the story of his dreams featured in the early historians, there are no means for determining its original form and function. Of Scipio Africanus, the period's second visionary, we are far better in- formed.89 Polybius, who wrote some fifty years after the event, not only profited from his personal acquaintance with a number of Scipio's friends and contemporaries, but could further draw on a widespread literary tradition, according to which Scipio partly owed his success to prophetic dreams; indeed, he said so himself. Polybius would have none of this. In his view, such 'explanations' were pure superstition, and as a historian he loathed nothing more than stories of dreams and miracles.90 However much Polybius admired Scipio, this scepticism colours (and per- haps distorts) his discussion of the self-proclaimed Roman visionary from the very outset - but at the same time it at least gives an impression of traditions which otherwise would have been unknown. According to these stories, dreams had originally encouraged Scipio to embark on his political career. In 217, when his elder brother Lucius canvassed the electorate to become aedile, Scipio twice dreamt that he too would be elected; and when he succeeded, people accepted that the dreams (of which he talked freely) had come true and that he was divinely inspired. Polybius insists that he was no such thing. While Scipio's election was the result of his personal qualities, his stories of dreams and divine guidance were merely an instrument to impress the superstitious multitude. Leaving aside what Scipio thought of the matter, there are elements in Polybius' narrative which seem unhistorical. Lucius was the younger, not the elder brother, and Scipio was aedile in 213, not in 217 - but still the tradition that he invoked his dreams and visions may well be early. While adopting a different chronology, Livy at least had no problems with this aspect. On the contrary, he confirms that Scipio from early on made it his habit to do 'most of his actions before the public, either as if they were prompted by visions in the 88 Marcius' speech: I. Kajanto, God and Fate in Livy (Turku 1957) 91; the miracle was a prodigiumfelicis eventus, Val. Max. 1.6.2. 89 On Scipio's dreams, W. Hoffmann, Livius und der zweite punische Krieg (Berlin 1942) 78 ff. and F.W. Walbank, "The Scipionic Legend", PCPhS ns 13 (1967) 54 ff. = Selected Papers (Cambridge 1985) 120 ff. examine the basic problems. 90 Polybius' dismissal of prophetic dreams: n. 4; elsewhere, he subscribes to a psychological view: cf. 5.108.5 (Demetrius encourages Philip's military ambition, so that the king dreams of such matters at night) and 18.15.13 (traitors live in daily fear and therefore dream of 'plots and disasters').</page><page sequence="32">84 PATRICK KRAGELUND night (per nocturnas visa species) or inspired by the gods'.9' Whatever the reliability of these early incidents, all the sources confirm that Scipio a few years later made similar claims. Prior to the capture of New Carthage in Spain in 209 BC, he told his soldiers of a dream in which Neptune had revealed how the Romans could capture the city; the god had even prom- ised to send a spectacular sign once the battle had begun.92 What subsequently happened seemed to confirm this claim. Seeing that the isthmus providing access to the city was strongly fortified, whereas the city otherwise was only protected by a laguna against attack from land, Scipio took advantage of the tide, which partly emptied the laguna, and under the cover of the night his soldiers crossed the shallow waters on foot. When a wind rose, which added to the effect of the tide, this was seen as a further token of divine favour. And when the city was taken, the soldiers felt convinced that their general was divinely inspired. Again, Polybius insists that this was not so. Scipio had simply been well informed. According to Scipio's friend Laelius (who was with him in Spain and whom Polybius quotes), he had in fact made a point of getting hold of reliable information concerning the tide and ebb of the laguna prior to the siege. Indeed, Scipio had himself told of this in a letter to the king of Macedonia. Polybius' verdict has been much debated. Clearly, this was a subject on which the Greek historian held strong views. Hence the suspicion that he is unduly simplistic: Scipio would neither be the first nor the last to combine careful and "rational" planning with trust in divine assistance. Yet what matters in the present context is not Scipio's personal convictions, but the tradition - or rather traditions - which evolved. While Scipio remained the great republican dreamer, Polybius' scepticism likewise had a lasting impact. This would hardly have been the case if the Greek exile had been alone in being sceptical. Even Valerius Maximus (who else- where accepts what others professed to doubt) lists Scipio among those who used religion in a fraudulent way.93 Livy is more cautious, carefully noting the pros. et cons. Indeed, his attitude, which clearly mirrors a heated debate, has itself been much discussed, and conclusions are sometimes at variance - above all when his text is exam- ined as evidence for the sincerity of Scipio's beliefs.94 91 cf. Polyb. 10.4.5 (Scipio's dreams prior to his election) and 10.5.5-9 (the public accept his claim) with Walbank ad loc. per nocturnas: Liv. 26.19.4. 92 Neptune at New Carthage: Polyb. 10.1 1.7; Scipio's strategy: H.H.

Max. 1.7.5 quotes Cicero's dream about Marius as a truly prophetic vision; so does Quintus, in the first book of De divinatione, but Marcus himself explains it as caused by his anxiety and frequent reflections on Marius' fate: cf. Div. 1.59; 2.140. 94 W. Hoffmann, op. cit. (n. 89) 78 ff. and H.H. Scullard, op. cit. (n. 92) 27 bring out well the</page><page sequence="33">Dreams, Religion and Politics in Republican Rome 85 Be that as it may: what matters here is the tradition, which the classic historian of republican Rome chooses to adopt. And here it is, to begin with, commonly agreed that Livy's Scipio reveres the gods of his ancestors. This was the great leader, thefatalis ... dux chosen by Gods and Fate to defeat Carthage. But for all his admiration Livy at the same time seems to have viewed Scipio's "mysticism", his emphasis on personal and direct contact with the gods, as problematic. Not because he subscribed to Polybius' verdict that it was all a fraud (on the contrary he accepts that some of it was genuine), but the consequences were no less damaging for that. As it has succinctly been put: 'at best superstition and at worst deceit'.95 It could of course be argued that Scipio' s behaviour had been misconstrued, but Livy meets the objection by emphasizing that Scipio did distressingly (or suspiciously) little to set matters right. Hence what seems to be Livy's final verdict: Scipio's ambiguity encouraged an admiration that 'went beyond the bounds befitting a human being' *96 For Livy the main problem is, in other words, not so much the Polybian issue of truth versus fraud, but rather that Scipio occasionally would combine ancestral divination with individual prophecy, thereby discarding traditional priorities. Still, this was a minor flaw in an otherwise admirable person, a disconcerting habit, which never entirely allowed personal inspiration to over- rule public restraint. In accordance with this attitude, Livy's narrative of events at New Carthage differs significantly from that of Polybius. Livy acknowledges that Scipio 'knew in advance' (compertum habebat) what he subsequently presented as a miracle, but makes it less of an issue.97 As for the famous dream, he likewise handles it in a more subdued key. While agreeing that Scipio made such claims ambiguities of Livy's attitude, but as argued by I. Kajanto, op. cit. (n. 88) 45-46 (cf. D.S. Levene, op. cit. [n. 81] 19) they seem to underestimate his scepticism; P.G. Walsh, Livy. His Historical Aims and Methods (Cambridge 1961) 94f. argues convincingly that tradi- tional unease (as reflected by Livy) was politically motivated. 95 cf. Liv. 26.19.3 fuit enim Scipio non veris tantum virtutibus mirabilis, sed arte quoque quadam ab iuuenta in ostentationem earum compositus, pleraque apud multitudinem aut per nocturnas visa species aut velut divinitus mente monita agens, sive et ipse capti quadam superstitione animi, sive ut imperia consiliaque velut sorte oraculi missa sine cunctatione exsequerentur.

(n. 88) 46.</page><page sequence="34">86 PATRICK KRAGELUND (here represented in oratio recta), he only accords the dream a secondary and subordinate role. To be sure, Scipio claims to know that the gods favour the Roman cause, but he knows this through (note the order) 'augury, auspices and even nocturnal visions' (auguriis auspiciisque et per nocturnos etiam visus). Livy's narrative has no reference to such augury, so the episode may well be yet a further illustration of the way Scipio used religion 'to promote his military and political aims'.98 But surely it is no less striking that the dream - instead of being presented as Scipio's primary contact with the gods - is cast as an extra, a supplement to the time-honoured methods of ensuring divine benevolence. To judge from the legends about Titus Latinius and Decius Mus, this emphasis on traditional priorities goes right to the core of the problem. What was at stake was not philosophical conviction, but constitutional principle. By invoking his dreams with such demonstrative zeal, Scipio seemed to claim for himself a position which was much too eminent for a system based on a high degree of equality within the oligarchy - not only in political, but also in religious matters. Perhaps it also mattered that dreams were associated with Eastern kingship - i.e. with ambitions incompatible with everything Roman.99 In either case, there were strong reasons for being against them. Which is where Polybius comes in. The Greek intellectual provided just what was needed: a rational argument for dismissing an individualism which might prove a danger- ous precedent. On this reading it is therefore not surprising that none of Scipio Africanus' colleagues followed his example: vestigia terrent. And even if Scipio's claims impressed the multitude, this does not seem to have diminished official distrust; on the contrary, it probably only made it stronger. Indeed everything suggests that the Roman Elite remained cautiously scep- tical about political dreams down to the end of the second century BC. Cicero's De divinatione is in this respect instructive. Despite his declared intention to provide Roman examples, neither Marcus nor his opponent Quintus have much to offer in the way of political dreams from Roman history, politics or religion; in fact the two most arresting examples concern Hannibal (the one of Jupiter ordering him to carry the war into Italy, the other of Juno warning him not to carry off a golden column from her temple at Lacinium). Cicero quotes these dreams from the historian Coelius Antipater, who in his turn adopted the former and probably both from a Greek historian (the impression being that what Rome 98 auguriis: Liv. 26.41.18-19; 'to promote': D.S.

Here the distribution is similar. If one discards his biographies of pre-first century Romans, dreams are virtually a Greek monopoly.'02 Not that Plutarch disliked such stories, but the extant books of Livy go far in suggesting that there was little to tell.103 Livy's total of six instances (of which the most flamboyant is of Greek origin) is in itself meagre - and even more so, when opposed to the record nine instances in Plutarch's Alex- ander. 104 Of course there are differences between annalistic history and biogra- 100 Roman dreams in De div.: Aeneas (from Fabius Pictor, n. 3), Ilia (from Ennius, n. 2), Tarquin (from Accius, n. 2), Numerius (from Praenestinian monumenta, n. 75), 'Titus Latinius' (from Fabius Pictor et al., n. 74), Decius Mus (from annalists, n. 79), Gaius Gracchus (from Coelius, n. 105) and finally Metella, Marcus and Quintus Cicero (the latter three memoria nostra, n. 6; 93); from Greek historians Cicero's sample is more generous: n. 4. 101 Pre-first century dreams in Val. Max.: 1.7.3-6 (Decius, Titus Latinius and C. Gracchus) and 2.4.5 (Valesius and the ludi); the dream (1.7.7) of the Greek-speaking "evil demon" (icaov 6aikov) seen by one of Caesar's assassins closely resembles those at Dion. Hal. 5.54; Plut. Brut. 36-37; 48 and Appian 4.134, the first about lawless conspirators, the latter two likewise about the tyrannicides. 102 For a survey, see F.E. Brenk, "The Dreams of Plutarch's Lives", Latomus 34 (1975) 336 ff.; in the Roman lives there are no dreams in Numa, Publicola, Camillus, Fabius, Aemilius Paullus, Cato the Elder, Flamininus and Tiberius Gracchus; one in Romulus (2.5.5, from the Greek historian, Promathion); one in Coriolanus (24-25, Titus Latinius, cf. n. 74) and in Caius Gracchus (n. 105) and a rare case of psychology at Marcellus 28.5 (he thought and talked about war with Hannibal at daytime and dreamt about it at night); the latter item may well stem from Polybius (cf. n. 90), according to H. Peter, Die Quellen Plutarchs in den Biographieen der Romer (Halle 1865; reprint Amsterdam 1965) 79 one of Plutarch's main sources for this life. 103 Liv. 2.36 (Titus Latinius, n. 74); 8.6.9 (Decius Mus and Titus Manlius Torquatus, n. 79); 21.22.6 (Hannibal; ultimately from a Greek historian, n. 4); 25.38.5 (L.

Romans hardly dreamt less than Greeks, but their state religion and political system provided few outlets for commemorating such experiences. In the life and history of the res publica there was only room for individual prophecy insofar as it had a bearing on the well-being of all. With the exception of Titus Latinius, Decius, Marcius and Scipio, the few pre-first century dreams on record are as a consequence politically marginal. Pliny the Elder quotes an odd anecdote about a third century consul who dreamt that he would turn blind - and when he awoke the dream had come true. What matters here is not whether this story is apocryphal or otherwise, but that it seems completely unrelated to the consul's turbulent career. The same is true of Gaius Gracchus' talk of dreams in which his murdered brother warned him of a similar fate. None of the sources claim that such talk had any influence, either on the electorate or on his followers.'05 When and how this situation changed is unknown; the sources for the late second and early first century BC only provide glimpses of the process (be it sudden or gradual) by which an institutional precedent for acknowledging a dream as a kind of prodigium was finally created. In the two known instances, panic is likely to have prompted official recognition. In 105 BC the fear of a Cimbrian invasion was augmented by reports of horrifying portents. It is hardly accidental that it was during a period which resembled the early catastrophic stages of the Second Punic War that prophetic dreaming reemerged; and it seems equally logical that it made its reappearance, not among magistrates or generals, from whom such claims might prove controversial, but among Rome's matronae who had less to gain or lose by having their claim either accepted or rejected. It may moreover have reassured the Senate that the report came from a group rather than an individu- al; according to a late expert the dreams of a group (even of commoners) are no less reliable than those of a high magistrate (and the Senate was traditionally uneasy about revelations of the latter sort).106 Finally, religion was an area 105 The consul turning blind was Sulla's ancestor, P. Cornelius Rufinus (cos. 290 and 277 BC): Plin. NH 7.166; since Pliny elsewhere quotes Sulla's Memoirs (fr. I OP = NH 22.12), the story of the visionary ancestor may well be from his no less visionary descendant (thus R.G. Lewis, "Sulla's Autobiography: Scope and Economy", Athenaeum 79 (1991] 513): Sulla wrote much about his own dreams (n. 18) and his fr. 2P refers to the son of Rufinus, the first with the cognomen Sulla.

In either case tradition and priestly or senatorial supervision delimited their competence, but with the Cimbrians threatening to invade Italy, private panic clearly mixed with public concern and the Senate knew better than to forbid, and probably even sanctioned, the public expiation of the dream of these matronae. Indeed, the Senate may at this juncture have had little choice. Parallels show that if it refused to comply, it now ran the risk of being defied. A few years later, when the Senate dismissed the prophecies of a Syrian priestess called Martha, women from the highest aristocracy are for instance known to have offered this foreign lady their protection. Indeed, Julia, the wife of Marius and herself from a family assiduously stressing its ancestral links to the gods, took such a liking to Martha (at gladiatorial combats she was a bookmaker's nightmare, always foreseeing who would win) that she sent her off to the front to help Marius defeat the Cimbri. And here Marius, in open defiance of the Senate, made a point of consulting the exotic prophetess in front of the army. As in the case of Scipio, critics dismissed all this as a fraud designed to deceive the superstitious, whereas others were convinced that Marius was himself taken in. What matters here is not, however, Marius' sincerity, or credulity, but the characteristic emphasis on the general's direct contact with the gods, on the name of his soothsayer and the initiative of his wife. Without openly discarding ancestral practice, Julia and Marius felt free to adopt alternative methods and cultivate exotic divinities. Gone were the days when the Senate could forbid a consul to consult Fortuna in Praeneste prior to a military campaign. Now, some of the great and powerful insisted on their exclusive and direct contact with the powers above - and the Senate could no longer mobilize the consensus which previously had obstructed such dangerous experiments.'07 When in 90 BC a new crisis threatened the survival of the republic, the pattern repeated itself, but now in a more extreme form. In 105 the reported Valesius) and Plut. Luc. 10.4 (Athena appearing to 'many' at Ilium - an event recorded in a public inscription); for the reliability of group dreams, Artem. 1.2 quotes two major authorities, Nicostratus of Ephesus and Pannyasis of Halicarnassos, both of unknown dates (I owe this reference to my colleague Hanne Lavdr Hansen). 107 Martha: Plut. Mar. 17.2 (the episode is datable to 102 BC); an impostor: cf. Val. Max. 1.3.4 (de superstitionibus) and Front. Str. 1.11.12. On this and parallel instances of religious friction, see E.

Max. 1.3.2 (in 241 BC); according to J. Champeaux, op. cit. (n. 75) 80, the reason for the Senate's refusal was Praeneste's being an ancienne ennemie de Rome, but after 338 BC there had been no sign of hostility; Valerius Maximus was probably right when asserting that the problem was the cult being 'foreign': auspiciis enim patriis, non alienigenis rem publicam administrari iudicabant oportere.</page><page sequence="38">90 PATRICK KRAGELUND dream had come from a group of matronae, now it came from an unmarried woman without a priesthood (but with highly influential relatives). But even if such individualism gave cause for anxiety, it may well have seemed reassuring that Metella was the daughter and sister, rather than wife of an ex-consul; and unlike certain others, there is no sign that she flaunted her independence; instead she had respectfully submitted her case to the Senate's arbitration. What followed has already been examined. The indications are that the dream resulted in expiation on a monumental scale (cf. p. 73). For all the official sanction it is, however, noteworthy that the report did not go unchal- lenged. Whether then or later the contemporary senator and historian Sisenna objected strongly to the project. According to Cicero, Sisenna's reasoning smacked of influence from 'some Epicurean'; and from a fragment of his Historiae it seems clear that the historian was familiar with the school's doctrine.'08 But given the period this is not in itself surprising; and if Metella's dream in fact concerned Lanuvium, it would only be natural if a member of that school had felt that a critical comment was called for. Lanuvium was after all the home-town of the senator Gaius Velleius, who in the early 70s BC was regarded as the school's Roman leader (cf. p. 57). In short, there was locally (not to mention elsewhere) enough talent who might feel tempted to apply Epicurus' teaching on the case at hand: Far from being divine messages about the future, dreams are the product of man's habits, hopes and fears (and with the whole of Italy in revolt, fear was what everyone felt, day as well as night). Even when a dream 'comes true' (and Sisenna admitted that Metella's vision had hit the mark 'remarkably well' [mirifice]) this does not prove that the gods care; it is simply 'the product of coincidence'.109 Sisenna could in short find strong arguments in the Epicurean armory, but from his dismissal of prophetic dreams it does not follow that he consistently viewed events from this philosophical angle. On the contrary he seems to have had no problems with normal prodigia (of which he recorded a whole series when discussing the prelude to the Social War)."0 The reason for this 'incon- 108 Sisenna, fr. 5P = Cic.

Once again, what seemed problematic was hardly the philosophical, but rather the constitutional implications." 2 For prodigia the procedures were well established, but for dreams there were fewer antecedents and far fewer means of control. Among the educated it was moreover well known that 'some dreams are true, but not necessarily all'; while some were pure invention' 13 others simply reflected what had been occupying the dream- er's mind."14 Like their Greek masters, Roman rhetors were therefore con- scious that whatever one's personal attitude this was a slippery ground on which to base an argument, be it in politics or in the law courts."5 Still, Metella's case may well have appeared straightforward. The issue of citizenship was, after all, a subject on which Juno Sospita could almost be expected to pronounce herself. The examination of her sanctuary had in a way confirmed the story. And even if the form was unusual, the dream's message had been reassuringly traditional: far from being prophetic, the Latin goddess had merely announced her displeasure. What had caused her anger was only implied; but since the Senate had reason to believe that the survival of the Republic depended on their response, one can readily understand why the Fathers at this juncture, unusually and perhaps uniquely, agreed to expiate 'the dreams of a woman'. 111 E. Rawson, op. cit. (n. 108) 382 translates Cicero's reference to Sisenna's being insolen- ter with 'impertinently'; similarly, P. Kragelund, art. cit. (n. 79) 441 and A. Cucchiarelli, "Sogno e prologo letterario tra alessandrinismo, precedenti enniani e dottrina epicurea", Maia 46 (1994) 177, but reexamining the passage I now agree with W.A. Falconer (Loeb) and the translations quoted in n. 25 that Quintus refers to Sisenna's 'n'; cf. TLL 7.1 col. 1930, 32 contraria eis, quae antea dixit (sc. Sisenna). 112 While A. La Penna, art. cit. (n. 25) 115 assumes that the historian's scepticism was politically motivated, E. Rawson, op. cit. (n. 108) 382 would not exclude other causes (such as an Etruscan's respect for augury). 113 Ennius, fr. 346 (Jocelyn) = Cic. Div. 2.172, aliquot somnia vera ... sed non omnia necesse est; Lucilius, fr. 493 (Krenkel) likens childish superstition to belief in somniaficta (cf. J.J. O'Hara, "Somnia Ficta in Lucretius and Lucilius", CQ 37 [19871 517 ff.). 114 As so often later, the two opposed views of dreams already coexist in a fragment of Accius' Brutus (fr. 2 [TRF]), where the interpreter tells Tarquin: Rex, quae in vita usurpant homines, cogitant, curant, vident/quaeque aiunt vigilantes agitantque, ea si cui in somno accidunt/minus mirandum est - then adding that the king's dream clearly was relevant for the state. 115 The difficulty in defining the status of dreams is reflected in the ambivalent attitude of imperial rhetors: As evidence dreams carried little weight, but some would use them as ornament (color); cf. P. Kragelund, "Epicurus, Pseudo-Quintilian and the Rhetor at Trajan's Forum", Classica et Mediaevalia 42 (1991) 259 ff. Their absence from the rhetoric of Cicero and his predecessors suggest that this attitude was traditional.</page><page sequence="40">92 PATRICK KRAGELUND VI Sulla - and After Less than two years later, in late 88, the very premises for discussing political dreams changed beyond recognition, the agent being forces which eventually would bring down the republic. Sulla's march on Rome disclosed a secret: power no longer resided with the Senate and People, but with the generals and their client armies. What triggered the crisis was Sulla's enemies depriving him of his eastern command. Rather than obeying, Sulla unexpectedly decided to resort to vio- lence. When learning of his plans, Sulla's officers deserted en masse, but the rank and file proved eager to follow. They too would profit if they ensured their charismatic leader the coveted command against king Mithridates. 1 16 What matters here is that Sulla, on the very eve of embarking on this momentous, revolutionary course, is said to have had a dream. Now, such pre- battle visions prophesying either victory or defeat are of course a common motif in hellenistic as indeed in late republican and imperial history, but it is surely significant that Sulla is the first Roman commander since Scipio who is said to have received such admonition. For over a century historians and generals had apparently respected the tacit constitutional veto against such claims; along with so much else this was now pushed aside. The violence of Sulla's dream only makes it stand farther apart. According to Plutarch, he saw 'a goddess whom the Romans learned to worship from the Cappadocians, whether she is Semele or Athene or Bellona'. Plutarch's refer- ence to Semele (Selene? - the text is uncertain) is puzzling, but Athene and Bellona suffice to establish that it was the belligerent Cappadocian goddess Ma-Bellona whom Sulla saw handing him a thunderbolt with which to strike down his enemies; she then called them forth, one by one, and helped Sulla kill them. Unfortunately, it is unknown when this story became current. Since Plutarch otherwise draws extensively on Sulla's Memoirs, repeatedly quoting his refer- ences to epiphanies and, in at least three instances, to his own dreams, it is of course tempting to assume that the dream of Ma-Bellona likewise represents things as Sulla wished them to be remembered. Sulla had previously been to Cappadocia. In his Memoirs he claimed to have received favourable prophecies from local Chaldaeans; and at a similar juncture, prior to his second march on Rome, he described how Ma-Bellona had sent him further encouragement."7 116 On Sulla and the army: E. Gabba, Republican Rome, the Army and the Allies (Oxford 1976) 27 ff. and H. Behr, Die Selbstdarstellung Sullas (Frankfurt am M. 1993) 68 ff. (with bibliography); on the officers, B.M.

Peter, HRR2 cclxxvii; E. Valgiglio, "L'autobiografia di Silla nelle</page><page sequence="41">Dreams, Religion and Politics in Republican Rome 93 On the other hand it may well be relevant that Plutarch refrains from giving his source. Sulla was 'said' to have had a dream - and subsequently told this to his fellow commander. Given the momentous consequences this is remarkably subdued - but if the account is not from Sulla himself, it certainly provides the kind of prophecy that this decisive episode would seem to demand. In historiographical terms Sulla's dream of Ma-Bellona is, as it were, a blueprint for all that followed. It projects onto a symbolic level what now became political reality. Things had indeed come full circle. As opposed to Scipio of old, Sulla invokes divine guidance not when attacking Rome's ene- mies, but when marching upon Rome herself. The dream of a Roman general no longer prophesied Roman victory, but the murder and exile of fellow Romans. Whatever its date and origin, Plutarch's account is moreover correct in underlining the importance of dreams in Sulla's self-representation. Indeed, Sulla himself is known to have taken great care to ensure that the stories of his felicitas, his divine support and vivid dreams became known to all. In this he was not of course the first (Scipio remained the great example), but in his own day the flamboyance of Sulla's performance clearly made him second to none - and that was no doubt the desired effect. When offering a golden gift to Venus in Aphrodisias Sulla would for instance furnish the dedication with an epigram describing a dream in which he had seen the armed and victorious goddess fighting on his side. To contemporaries, the claim must have seemed disturb- ingly bold. This was not how the average Roman commander described his relationship with the gods. Nor was this an isolated case. On the contrary, Sulla represented himself similarly in his Memoirs. Virtually from first to last he there cast himself as a visionary: In its preface Sulla claimed that nothing is as trustworthy as dreams; this was exemplified in the narration of his res gestae: prodigy and prophecy, epiphanies and dreams had guided his steps from beginning to triumphant conclusion; when reaching the twenty-second and last book, now himself on the verge of death, Sulla included a vision of his dead son inviting him soon to join his family in the peace and quiet of the hereafter (remorseful fears of infernal punishment were never Sulla's line).118 Such stories also provided posterity with a proper commemorative framework: Even if the hypothesis that one of his dreams is depicted in the late republican coinage seems questionable, there is biografie di Plutarcho", Stud. Urbinati 49.1 (1975) 276 and H. Behr, op. cit. (n. 116) 18; 53; 74 (with bibliography). 118 Aphrodisias: Appian 1.97; dreams in Sulla's Memoirs: fr. 8P (from the preface) = Plut. Sul. 6.10; Luc. 23.6; fr. 21P = Plut. Sul. 37.3 (from the last book); to judge from fr. 19P the dream prior to the battle at Sacriportus (Sul. 28.7-8) also comes from the autobiogra- phy: H. Behr, op. cit. (n. 116) 92; for further prophecies and epiphanies, see fr. 9P, lOP, 16P, 18P and 21P with H. Behr, op. cit. (n. 116)18 f.</page><page sequence="42">94 PATRICK KRAGELUND no doubt that this remained a central aspect in the myth about Sulla's unique position vis-ai-vis the gods."19 When attempting to understand why the visionary commander makes his reappearance at precisely this point in Roman history, two circumstances seem decisive. First of all, the panic caused by the escalating civil war and aggravated by fears that Rome's eastern empire would fall apart was at the time reflected in a spate of portents and prophecies. In 88, the adherents of king Mithridates at one blow massacred some 80,000 Romans and Italians in Asia Minor. When Etruscan soothsayers proclaimed that the end of the eighth saeculum was at hand, events seemingly confirmed such apocalyptic forecasts. This feeling of imminent disruption was augmented by the attitude of the army, by now not only a decisive, but also an unpredictable political factor. The early 80s not only saw the first march on Rome, but also the first instances of Roman soldiers assassinating their lawful commanders. Mutinies now threat- ened to become the order of the day. With discipline disintegrating a new kind of personal charisma was required, if a commander wished to uphold authority. Years of fierce and aggressive competition with Marius had provided Sulla with a persona which more than fulfilled such needs. When Marius consulted his personal sooth- sayer and stressed his mission as the divinely ordained saviour of Rome, Sulla knew how to outbid his rival, on each and every claim. And if Sulla's methods at first were traditional, the escalating spiral of increasing violence eventually changed not only the rules of the game, but the game itself.'20 Sulla's demonstrative reliance on his dreams is in my view best seen against this background of anarchy and panic. Far from being a 'traditional' element rooted in ancient Roman religiositas, far from representing a view of 'the nature of the gods and their relationship with men' which was 'sincerely shared by the vast majority of his fellow countrymen', the reemergence of the 119 In addition to Plutarch, Plin. NH. 7.138 and Appian (n. 118) and 1.105 refer to Sulla's dreams. A coin from 44 BC and glass paste in Copenhagen have traditionally been held to depict a version of Sulla's vision of Ma-Bellona: M.H. Crawford, RRC no. 480.1; N. Breitenstein, Acta Arch. 8 (1937) 181 ff. and H. Gabelmann, LIMC 3.1 (1986) 736; in both cases the supposed Ma-Bellona is depicted in the guise of Selene, with the moon sikle on her head, but the Teubner text of K. Ziegler suggests that Plutarch wrote Semele; moreover, even if Ma-Bellona's iconography is somewhat uncertain, she was, apparently, a solar goddess: N. Proeva, LIMC 6.1 (1992) 330-331. Returning to W. Helbig's old identification, J. Rufus Fears, "Sulla or Endymion?", ANSMN 19 (1974) 29-37 therefore argues that the coin as well as glass paste depict the naked Endymion (left) approached by Selene (right) while a somewhat oversized winged Cupid presides in the center (the pattern recurs in wall paintings); cf. H. Behr, op. cit. (n. 116) 74. 120 Panic and portents in 88 BC: Plut. Sul. 7.2-6; Diod. 38 fr. 5. Mutinies in 89 and later: H. Behr, op. cit. (n. 116) 109. C.J. Classen, art. cit.

Why bother about procedure when no one dares to oppose? The wider implications of this step soon dawned upon the successors. 'If Sulla could, so could they'. Indeed, now all could join in, provided they had the military backing. In the last age of the republic, military dynasts like Sertorius, Lucullus, Crassus and Pompey would from time to time likewise invoke dreams to support their rival claims, and if they did not do so themselves, others did so for them.122 Still, it was only when the rivals had been eliminated and one of the dynasts emerged supreme that Roman rulers and historians started invoking the kind of somnia imperii which for centuries had announced the accession of Eastern monarchs. Beginning with the Memoirs of Augustus and gaining a new direction with Constantine's insistence on having seen the Cross of Christ prior to his victory at the Milvian Bridge, this was a procedure which monarchies throughout early modern Europe adopted from Rome.123 Royal Academy of Art, Copenhagen Patrick Kragelund 121 'Alles was wir von ihm (sc.
