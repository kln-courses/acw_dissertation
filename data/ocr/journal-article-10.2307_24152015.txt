It follows that the students would be free to better appreciate the intellectual feats which are the various scientific hypotheses of origins. Both teacher and class can then carefully compare the different theories and theoretical models, recog nizing that, with new observational data, one of them will gain in power, but it remains that we will probably never known with certainty just how the universe began, if it began at all.

TV Science Series on "Man and His Universe" North American Rockwell announces a series of hour-long documentary tele vision programs to be broadcast over the ABC network this fall and winter. Titled "Man and His Universe," the series will have as its central theme science and the men and women who devote themselves to science in order to make our lives more rewarding and more productive in the future. The first program, scheduled for No vember 29 with a rebroadcast on Febru ary 9, was "The Scientist." It focused on scientists who are making major con tributions in various fields. "Cosmopolis," January 13, will deal with the future of the city and some proposals for future organization of urban living. "The View From Space," March 14, will depict what man has seen of earth and beyond during the first decade of space exploration. This special will also examine how science is interpreting these newly acquired facts from space and adapting them to benefit mankind in geology, oceanography, in land use, water conservation, and how meteorological pictures from space are benefiting our predictions of weather.
