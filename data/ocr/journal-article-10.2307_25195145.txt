<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bergson's Hand: Toward a History of (Non)-Organic Vitalism Hisashi Fujita "Today vitalism is sterile, but it will not always be so."?Henri Bergson Introduction Let me say at the outset that my question is not whether or not Bergson was a vitalist. If vitalism is defined as a theory that proposes a "vital force" underlying phenomena which transforms matter into living, organized matter while stressing its irreducibility to physico-chemical phenomena, and if one takes into account the bergsonian notion of life that is "more than anything else, a tendency to act upon inert matter" (CE, 96), as well as his notion of the "elan vital" ("the explosive force?due to an unstable balance of tendencies" [CE, 98]), then incontestably there is a kind of vitalism in Bergson. My concern here is to understand what kind of vitalism is at work in Bergson's philosophy1 This being so, where in his work should we focus on the intertwined relationships between life and matter, mind and body, the organic and the inorganic, the body and the machine, and so on? I propose to approach this question via the notion of the "organ," a notion that seems to give a key to Bergson's vitalism. For the term "organ" is an amalgamation of various meanings, whose condensation into a single word is highly significant for our inquiry. Let's look at a few of organ's meanings. First of all, it means machine, for in Greek organon means "instrument of work, tool." Next it means a part or member of a body?either individual, or social. Finally, organ can be a voice?a medium of communication, as a newspaper is the "organ" or voice of a party.2 Like the theory of life in Creative Evolution which unmistakably calls forth the theory of knowledge, the "organ" possesses its specific organon, which could be useful for our inquiry into a unique vitalism. More generally, a whole series of words like organ, organized being, organic, organism, organization, organicism, organon, as well as organum, orgue (musical organ), and even (not unreasonably here) orgasm or orgiasm,3 belong to a constellation of words related to the org (shorthand for this ? Board of Regents, University of Wisconsin System, 2007 215 SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="2">116 Hisashi Fujita semantic system), and have played a decisive role in the traditional problematic of vitalism. Characterized by a certain intervention, intermediation or interpretation at the very heart of immediacy, the org prompted certain vitalist philosophers to overthrow the traditional division between life and death, body and machine, organic and inorganic, and so on. Rather than demonstrating this thesis, I would like to give an example of it. I would like to approach Bergson's vitalism in the context of the "the org" by concentrating on the theme of "the hand." More precisely, on the forcefully exerting hand or arm [le bras s'efforqant]. This figure recurs throughout Bergson's oeuvre: Time and Tree Will takes up the forcefully exerting hand from the start, in the category of muscular effort; Matter and Memory speaks of the amputated hand; in Creative Evolution we recall the hand that plunges into a mass of iron filings; in The Two Sources of Morality and Religion, we find the movement of the hand carried from one point to the other?an indivisible, moving and multiple gesture. One might wonder if such a theme is worth pursuing, especially since it is merely an example, a metaphor or an analogy, and not a philosophical notion. But Bergson himself stressed the power of metaphor. Taking this term in its etymological sense ?that is, taking it as transposition of senses or alteration of meaning between the representable and the unrepresentable, Bergson exhorts us, "Let us not be duped by appearances: there are cases in which it is imagery in language which knowingly expresses the literal meaning, and abstract language which unconsciously expresses itself figuratively" (CM, 49). In the spiritual, vital or metaphysical domain, the use of comparisons and metaphors, which suggests that everyday or scientific language is insufficient, is not a detour; rather, we are taken straight to the point to which the image carries us, via "direct vision." It is this transpositional logic, characteristic of Bergson's discursive strategy, which is at work in his use of hands. Admittedly, the hand, the arm, the fist, and the finger are merely examples. What matters is not whether or not they remain simple examples, but to understand what kind of exemplariness they embody. In fact, in Bergson, the hand fluctuates between being a random example (the hand as merely one example of the organ), and a paradigmatic example (the hand as best example, incomparable to other organs, metaphor of what characterizes the human being as the pinnacle of an onto-teleological hierarchy), while between these two poles it is an example harboring another teleology (the hand neither as one example among many, nor as a paradigmatic normative, but as the best analogy). SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="3">Bergson's Hand 117 We will observe as rigorously as possible this fluctuation or drift or even ambiguity, in order to weigh its consequences. We must first distinguish the hand from the sense of touch, strongly allied with the "direct vision" of intuition, which represents immediacy or continuity as the first axiom of a phenomenology of the sense of touch. Starting with Plato, and for obvious etymological reasons, intuition has privileged the sense of sight, but as a sort of tactile sense, like the sense of the touch of light. Recall that in Descartes's La Dioptrique and in Diderot's Lettre sur les aveugles, the luminous ray is to the eye what the stick is to the hand of a blind man. It cannot be denied that in Bergson there is an intuitionism that privileges the complicity between vision and the sense of touch, as Derrida detects in the The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics.4 In this work, Bergson clearly refers to this haptico-optical model: The intuition we refer to then bears above all upon internal duration. It grasps a succession which is not juxtaposition [....] It is the direct vision of the mind by the mind [....] Intuition, then, signifies first of all consciousness, but immediate consciousness, a vision which is scarcely distinguishable from the object seen, a knowledge which is contact and even coincidence. (CM, 35-36; cited in Derrida, 123) The rigor, prudence and impartiality that one expects from Derrida's readings, unequaled for their patience and minuteness, nevertheless do not seem to suggest that this Bergson might be distinguished from another one ?an as-yet-to-be discovered Bergson. In what follows, through a study of Bergson's use of the hand in Creative Evolution and elsewhere, I hope to catch a glimpse of this fecund multiplicity of textual voices. Bergson's hand, which does not necessarily imply the sense of touch, seems to resist the longstanding primacy accorded to vision as touch, as the haptic model of philosophy as intuitionism or as theoria itself. Thus the hand is a privileged example, if not the example par excellence of what Bergson calls ... the mediating image [...]?an image which is almost matter in that it still allows itself to be seen, and almost mind in that it no longer allows itself to be touched,?a phantom which haunts us while we turn about the doctrine and to which we must go in order to obtain the decisive signal, the indication of the attitude to take and the point from which to look. (CM 139) It is an exemplary example that allows us to come to grips with the questions that are crucial for bergsonian vitalism. In brushing up against a discontinuity in continuity, in touching a mediation at the very heart of immediation, Bergson's hand, inasmuch as it embodies tekhne or SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="4">118 Hisashi Fujita prosthetic extension, which likewise extends the org, occupies a strategic place in the history of philosophical figures or tropes. I would like to focus on three figures of the hand that Bergson uses in Creative Evolution?the hand of man, the hand of the philosopher, and the hand of God. In the course of this study we will encounter the main bergsonian concepts: duration, memory, and the elan vital, as well as those of body, effort, tendency, and indetermination. We will attempt to discern the relationships between matter and life, between mind and body, between body and machine, and between "the artificial and God."5 I. The Hand of Man Let us begin with the hand of man. It is no longer the springboard for a psychophysical explanation, as in Time and Free Will, nor for a psychopathological explanation, as in Matter and Memory, but this time for a biological one. However, it is not enough to say that for Bergson, life is a phenomenon that cannot be reduced to physico-chemical laws or to any enterprise of mathesis universalis, and that this biological irreducibility itself constitutes bergsonian vitalism. For in fact it is the term "biological" that must be questioned. It is not a matter of the biological as a scientific discipline, but of the "bio-logical" as logic and technique, organization and normativity of life. And it is in this context that the hand presents itself as the place where tools and machines are produced. Among vertebrates, whose two pairs of members accomplish various functions that are much more independent of their form than is possible among arthropods, it is in man that this prehensile machine achieves its acme, in becoming the nearly all-powerful human hand: "The independence becomes complete in man, whose hand is capable of any kind of work" (CE, 133, my italics). According to Bergson, this liberation through the hand dates from the time when "the first weapons, the first tools were made" (CE, 137).6 The definition of man?not Homo sapiens, but Homo faber?seems at first glance troubling, since it appears to distance Bergson from the vitalism or spiritualism ordinarily imputed to him. But obviously the human hand would be nothing without intelligence,7 for although this process of production is only actualized through the hand, it nevertheless proceeds via intelligence. It is intelligence that tends "to transform matter into an instrument of action, that is, in the etymological sense of the word, into an organ. Life, not content with producing organisms, would fain give them as an appendage inorganic matter itself, converted into an immense organ by the industry of the living being" (CE, 161). The "meaning" of the hand and that of intelligence ("what our intellect is SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="5">Bergson's Hand 119 meant for" [CE, 164]) come together in the "meaning" of life. Our organs are natural tools, and tools themselves are artificial organs. Thus the bergsonian "organ" transcends the boundary between organic and inorganic. Not just the hand, intelligence, and tools, but also "memory, imagination, conception and perception, generalization in short" (CM, 61) in the name of life, in the name of Primum vivere?all work together in "making us masters of matter" (CM, 43). If then everything is organ, it is not surprising to see emerge what we might call the law of extension or logic of the org: "Our intelligence is the prolongation of our senses" (CM, 43); "The workman's tool is the continuation of his arm; the tool equipment of humanity is therefore a continuation of its body" (TS, 267). This law or logic of extension is a direct consequence of the "theory of two bodies" deployed in Matter and Memory: if one perceives things where they are, and if perception is nothing more than a virtual action, then the human body does not stop at the point where it touches itself; beyond the "body itself," the "very small, organized body," man has another body, "our very large, inorganic body," which extends "as far as the stars" (TS, 221). In order to see where this logic eventually leads us, and to better determine the characteristics of Bergson's hand, we must question here the meaning of the following quasi-materialist argument that this logic engenders: the artificial organ's advantage over the natural instrument is that Above all, it reacts on the nature of the being that constructs it; for in calling on him to exercise a new function, it confers on him, so to speak, a richer organization, being an artificial organ by which the natural organism is extended. For every need that it satisfies, it creates a new need; and so, instead of closing, like instinct, the round of action within which the animal tends to move automatically, it lays open to activity an unlimited field into which it is driven further and further, and made more and more free. (CE, 141) If Homofaber is not only capable of fabricating concrete or abstract things, but also can "fabricate himself" (CM, 99), it is via matter that man accomplishes this self-transformation: "the inventions which strew the road of progress have also traced its direction. [...] it takes us longer to change ourselves than to change our tools" (CE, 138)?an idea that is almost materialist. One day, Bergson says, several millennia hence, our era of "modernity" will be defined by its industrial revolution, by its invention of the steam engine, rather than by its wars or other revolutions. Thus technology is a kind of prosthesis that extends purely biological evolution (as has been admirably shown by Andre Leroi Gourhan, who was inspired by Bergson).8 Through his invention, the SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="6">120 Hisashi Fujita intelligent being extends that capacity for indetermination that life originally possesses in the form of potential: "The role of life is to insert some indetermination into matter" (CE, 126). It's life that inserts indetermination, but this only takes place in matter. Thus matter is "the vast spring-board from which life has taken its leap" (CE, 265). And it is precisely in this sense that Bergson uses the notion of the elan vital: The impetus of life, of which we are speaking, consists in a need of creation. It cannot create absolutely, because it is confronted with matter, that is to say with the movement that is the inverse of its own. But it seizes upon this matter, which is necessity itself, and strives to introduce into it the largest possible amount of indetermination and liberty. (CE, 252) Between life and matter, the hand of man thus expresses an exteriorization of this indetermination, this liberty of human activity. By making tools?that is, by working in cooperation with man's intelligence, inventiveness and industry,9 the human hand establishes a line of de-marcation, dis-junction or dis-articulation between man and machine, and from there, between man and animal, between the organic and the inorganic, between life and matter. Thus I feel confident in saying that Bergson is one of the thinkers who helps us to understand the relationship among man, technology, and life. The Hand of the Philosopher Now let's take a look at the hand of the philosopher. While the "hand" in this context remains a methodological tool, an organon for dissolving false problems rather than attempting in vain to resolve them, it is no longer a random scientific example, but a metaphor or analogy. What characterizes this methodological maneuver? Let's look at two ways that Bergson operates this "hand," and we will see that these two uses of the hand correspond to two bergsonian critiques. First, there is the hand that plunges into the iron filings, for the critique of the notion of finality. Then there is the hand that crosses out, for the famous critique of the idea of nothing. The Hand Plunged into Iron Filings We have seen above the meaning of the logic of Primum vivere, the primacy of survival over intelligence, of praxis over theoria; one only thinks in order to act. Molded by action, the intelligence focuses on combining and directing actions and movements in order to achieve an end, based on a pre-existing model that has only to be actualized: "We are born artisans" (CE, 44). To speak of an "end" or a "goal" in Life is thus to SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="7">Bergson's Hand 121 consider the process unpredictable by biological evolution, in terms of mechanical causality or anthropomorphic finality, which in the end are only "standpoints to which the human mind has been led by considering the work of man" (CE, 89). "Anthropomorphic" because, in assimilating Nature's work with that of an "intelligent workman" (CE, 60), a "workman, who also proceeds by the assemblage of parts with a view to the realization of an idea or the imitation of a model" (CE, 88), finalists assume, in fact, that life proceeds like intelligence, like Homofaber. Thus it is necessary to criticize, in Kant's sense of the word?that is, to delimit the boundary between fabrication and organization. Bergson's critique of finality is not the total rejection of the idea of an immanent finality to life, but a modification of this idea. He rejects only the "internal finality" (classical finalism), and proposes "external finality" (modified finalism). The difference lies in the fact that "the materiality of this machine does not represent a sum of means employed, but a sum of obstacles avoided: it is a negation rather than a positive reality" (CE, 93, B's italics). Bergson uses the "hand" to unmask the fact that in presupposing an inexplicable, demiurgical power, a mechanism like finalism believes in creation ex nihilo. Let us suppose, says Bergson, that the invisible hand and arm attempt to plunge themselves into a pile of iron filings. Here is the forcefully exerting hand in that context: Let us now imagine that [...] the hand has to pass through iron filings which are compressed and offer resistance to it in proportion as it goes forward. At a certain moment the hand will have exhausted its effort, and, at this very moment, the filings will be massed and coordinated in a certain definite form, to wit, that of the hand that is stopped and of a part of the arm. (CE, 94, my italics) The mechanists would relate the position of each grain to the action the neighboring grains exercise on it; the finalists would claim that a grand plan presided over the detail of these elementary actions. In order to get past this finalism/mechanism aporia, and to finally arrive at a third possibility, Bergson needs a means of explanation sui generis, which would be neither a mysterious force within the pile of iron filings (classical vitalo-finalism), nor merely an external interaction of the grains (pure, hard mechano-causalism), but something in a friction between the grains and the hand, in a unique and indivisible movement of the hand and the filings: It is similar to the simple act of an invisible hand plunged into iron filings, which, if we only took into account what we saw, would seem like an inexhaustible interplay of actions and reactions among the filings themselves in order to effect an equilibrium. If such is the contrast between the real working of life and the aspect it presents to SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="8">122 Hisashi Fujita the senses and the intelligence which analyse it, is it surprising that a soul which no more recognizes any material obstacle should feel itself, rightly or wrongly, at one with the principle of life? (TS, 41) Thus Bergson's explanation lies neither in the hand nor the filings, but in the relationship between them. Hence I would propose that Bergson's vitalism is "(non)-organic." For Bergson, there is no mechanistic interaction of matter, nor a mysterious vital-finalist principle, but a friction or resistance between matter and life. A certain creativity, not found in either matter or life alone, emerges in their relationship, which is purely negative, if not dialectical. For, as Bergson proclaims, ... the impetus is finite, and it has been given once for all. It cannot overcome all obstacles. The movement it starts is sometimes turned aside, sometimes divided, always opposed; and the evolution of the organized world is the unrolling of this conflict. (CE, 254) Thus life and matter exercise their power upon one another in a radically negative way. But life as tension, and matter as extension or detente, are not opposed to one another in a traditional way. If there is a negativity or a dialecticity, it is of a new kind, which can only recognize and understand itself after its total transformation (if not its disappearance) via a complete affirmation. How can one create an instrument of liberty with matter, which is necessity itself? How can one construct a mechanics that will triumph over mechanism? These questions only arise "in man, and in man alone" (CE, 264), whose consciousness frees itself, breaking the chain of ready-made nature. More precisely, these questions are only understood by intuition, which sheds a different light than that shed by reason?a natural light: Intuition is there, however, but vague and above all discontinuous. It is a lamp almost extinguished, which only glimmers now and then, for a few moments at most. But it glimmers wherever a vital interest is at stake. On our personality, on our liberty, on the place we occupy in the whole of nature, on our origin and perhaps also on our destiny, it throws a light feeble and vacillating, but which none the less pierces the darkness of the night in which the intellect leaves us. These fleeting intuitions, which light up their object only at distant intervals, philosophy ought to seize, first to sustain them, then to expand them and so unite them together. (CE, 267-268) The relationship between life and matter is henceforth grasped in a totally new perspective. This is why I propose that bergsonian vitalism is "(non)-organic." And it is in this sense that we understand Jankelevitch's well-justified observation: "The critique of ideas of disorder and of nothingness is the key to Bergsonism" (200; Cf. 2). Let us turn now to our next example. SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="9">Bergson's Hand 123 The Hand that Crosses Out Bergson summons his second example of the methodological hand in order to dissolve the false problem, i.e. the famous critique of nothingness and disorder. When someone enters a room and considers it to be "in disorder," what does he mean by that? It's that he expected order?a well-arranged room ?and was disappointed in this expectation. However, disorder, when it appears as an absence of order, is merely another mode of being of order. If this is true, then the pair order/disorder does not exist, and there are in fact only "two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another" (CE, 235): "thinking the absence of one thing is only possible by the more or less explicit representation of the presence of some other thing" CE, 283); consequently "Negation, therefore, differs from affirmation properly so called in that it is an affirmation of the second degree" (CE, 288, B's italics). Thus there is not less, but more in disorder than in order; first comes the idea of order, then its negation. Here again, the privileged example of the hand intervenes at the crucial moment, to express the indissociability of non-being and the maneuver of negation. Bergson says that if one believes that to deny is like taking up a pen and crossing out an imaginary clause written somewhere in one's head, it is because one forgets the existence of the hand performing the crossing out?one forgets the cause of the negation, the act by which one denies the existence of something: "that which expels being inseparable from the expulsion as the hand which drives the pen is inseparable from the pen-stroke" (CE, 285). To believe that this intellectual crossing-out is self-contained and can be isolated or independent from the rest of things, even autonomous or autarkic, is to believe that one has found, in a general process of negation, something like creation ex nihilo. Thus we must reject the dualist notion of cause/effect, matter/life, and turn to creative evolution as ongoing recomposition, perpetual agency by a new kind of monism that transcends the conflict between monism and dualism. Through these two examples, we now can understand the "sense" of intelligence ?"sense" in two senses ?its meaning and its direction destination?which is what Bergson calls "the stumbling block of vitalist theories": "the fact that, in nature, there is neither purely internal finality nor absolutely distinct individuality" (CE, 42). We see here an anticipation of Gilbert Simondon's ontology of "transindividuation." But before pursuing the consequence of this definition of vitalism, let us consider this last example. SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="10">124 Hisashi Fujita The Hand of God In this third case, we see the hand connected to the theme of effort?a theme developed by Maine de Biran (1766-1824), and already taken up by Bergson in Time and Free Will. But in this instance the hand is no longer a concrete example, nor an analogy, but a metaphor, in the bergsonian sense of the term, defined in my introduction, above. Already in the second example considered above, the hand was no longer that of man, but more what one might call the "invisible hand of God." And here we will see the turning point of the notion of indetermination. What Bergson calls "effort" here is the spontaneity of life that is manifested in the evolution of the organic world by a continual creation of forms that succeed other forms: "the life manifested by an organism is, in our view, a certain effort to obtain certain things from the material world" (CE, 136). In order to conceptualize this "original impetus of life, passing from one generation of germs to the following generation of germs through the developed organisms which bridge the interval between the generations" (CE, 87), "as if a broad current of consciousness had penetrated matter, loaded, as all consciousness is, with an enormous multiplicity of interwoven potentialities" (CE, 181), Bergson first had recourse to the famous image of a "a vessel full of steam at a high pressure, and here and there in its sides a crack through which the steam is escaping in a jet" (CE, 247).10 But he later renounces this image, since all of its elements (the fissure, the jet of steam, the evaporation and condensation of the drops of water, etc.), in obeying laws of physics, are necessarily determined. In order to show that the creation of a world is a free act, and that life, within the material world, participates in this freedom through effort [effor cement], Bergson takes as the best example the arm, the forcefully exerting arm: Let us think rather of an action like that of raising the arm; then let us suppose that the arm, left to itself, falls back, and yet that there subsists in it, striving to raise it up again, something of the will that animates it. In this image of a creative action which unmakes itself we have already a more exact representation of matter. In vital activity we see, then, that which subsists of the direct movement in the inverted movement, a reality which is making itself in a reality which is unmaking itself. (CE, 247-248, B's italics) The advantage in this metaphor of the arm or hand of God, or more precisely the arm that is the Creator, is that it represents an experience that is necessarily finite. Thus a finite indetermination or an indeterminate finitude. If life is "like an effort to raise the weight which falls" (CE, 246), an "an effort to re-mount the incline that matter descends" (CE, 245), if SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="11">Bergson's Hand 125 "all life, animal and vegetable, seems in its essence like an effort to accumulate energy and then to let it flow into flexible channels, changeable in shape, at the end of which it will accomplish infinitely varied kinds of work" (CE, 253-254), and if finally "The whole history of life until man has been that of the effort of consciousness to raise matter, and of the more or less complete overwhelming of consciousness by the matter which has fallen back on it" (CE, 264), then "the force immanent in life" is not infinite, for "everything seems to indicate that this force is limited" (CE, 141-142, my emphasis). If "From the bottom to the top of the organized world we do indeed find one great effort" (CE, 127), "It must not be forgotten that the force which is evolving throughout the organized world is a limited force, which is always seeking to transcend itself and always remains inadequate to the work it would fain produce" (CE, 126, my emphasis). This metaphor of the forcefully exerting arm helps us to grasp the dual character of the elan vital: both determined and undetermined, finite and infinite, continuous and discontinuous, self constructing and self-destructing. In actualizing every degree of difference that exists in virtual multiplicity, the elan vital (as a movement of finite differentiation) advances as far as possible that very line of humanity that becomes aware of itself?a line whose advance is none other than what Bergson calls the great Christian mystics. Thus this elan has a specific "destination." Note that most of the above quotes come from the section entitled "The Main Directions of the Evolution of Life." "It is in this quite special sense that man is the 'term' and the 'end' of evolution" (CE, 265). In Bergson, as in Fichte,11 we can retrace the increasingly frequent and rigorous use of this concept of "destination" invoked as response to the double question of the (in-) determination and finality of a human and vital reality. Man is always (in)determined (free) vis-a-vis life. This is not only because man makes considerable efforts, but because he is himself an effort of nature. Thus we arrive at the "sense" of life. As for Bergson's forcefully exerting arm taking on that same anthropomorphic character that he challenged in finalism, we can speak here of a certain "humanualism" [humainisme],12 an anthropologism or Christianizing anthropocentrism of French spiritualism. Biran's thinking on finitude seems to return in Bergson.13 If the power in the elan vital is both indeterminate and finite, what is the status of the task that the hand executes? Isn't it possible that we are heading toward a very bad ending? In fact, it was 25 years after the publication of Creative Evolution?that is, in 1932, after having lived through World War I and its difficult aftermath, that Bergson wrote The SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="12">126 Hisashi Fujita Two Sources of Morality and Religion, in which he sets out the final, much more problematic and much more disquieting consequence of this logic of extension. If Two Sources "performs an extension" (as Seris suggests in his study of the relationships of the machine and technology in Bergson), then we must question the shifts that have taken place in these extensions. It is significant that Bergson recalls and sums up this theory of two bodies in a section entitled "The Problem of Evil."14 We might seek the "sense" of this finitude in Two Sources, but that is another project. By Way of a Conclusion: Toward a History of (Non)-Organic Vitalism In this rapid overview of Creative Evolution, and in focusing on three "hands" and thereby on the question of the org, we have seen the rudiments of Bergson's unique vitalism. It is not a substantialist vitalism founded upon a random vital principle that might be extracted from the mechanist-finalist view of evolution. For Bergson, the body is not simply the physico-chemical " body itself," "the little body," but also the virtual, machine-like "great body." In this key theory of the two bodies, it is a matter of discerning all the intertwinings of animality/humanity (anthropocentrism), of organic/inorganic, of body/machine, of human body/social body (organicism), of man/God (theology). Defined as a surpassing of mechanism and finalism, the "philosophy of life" nevertheless contains a certain affinity with finalism, when it comes to the way of representing "the organized world like a harmonious ensemble." But, as we know, Bergson's finalism is totally different from that of some pre-established harmony: But this harmony is far from being as perfect as it has been claimed to be. It admits of much discord [...] whence arises a possible conflict with other forms of life. Harmony, therefore, does not exist in fact; it exists rather in principle; I mean that the original impetus is a common impetus, and the higher we ascend the stream of life the more do diverse tendencies appear complementary to each other. (CE, 50 51, my italics) Thus for Bergson, life is something that transcends the organism in the auto-poietic or homeo-static sense. This is because it always needs the outside?needs escapes of every sort toward the outside?and because Bergson's vitalism can no longer be "organic" in the ordinary sense of the word. Bergson was one of the few French philosophers (if not the only one) to consider mechanical invention as distinct from science, like a biological function?an aspect of the organization of matter by life. Acknowledging this, Georges Canguilhem wrote in La Connaisssance de la vie: "Creative Evolution is in some sort a treatise on general organology" SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="13">Bergson's Hand 127 (125). Organology, yes, as long as this is not understood as a branch of biology that studies the organs in relationship to the entire body, the parts to a "whole" organized like a closed circuit, but rather is understood in a musicological sense, something like a science of the "organ" that studies the instruments of all places and all times. Organology as the unheard-of encounter of instruments. This is one of the building blocks of Bergson's vitalism: opening to the universe and to oneself, immanent transcendence of self. This is why I propose to call bergsonian vitalism "(non)-organic." I use this term in a way similar to the way Deleuze used "(non)-being" or "?-being": "the (non)-being, the ?-being who denounces both the being and the non-being" (Difference, 262). It is by denouncing the indifference in both opposition and limitation, thereby denouncing every kind of traditional dialectic that necessarily preserves one or the other of two terms (opposition) or even one within the other (limitation), that the criticism of the negative becomes truly efficacious, or what Nietzsche calls a "genealogy" or a "reversal of values." Let us recall that the bergsonian notion of multiplicity denounces both the One and the multiple. It's the diversity in the mode of being that denounces both order and disorder. It's normativity, Bergson would say, along with Canguilhem, that denounces both the normal and the pathological. We see that this bergsonian logic of the (non)-organic?of multiplicity, of normativity ?is at work everywhere, as well as this link between problematization and differentiation against the complicity of the negative and of the dialectical. In closing, I would like to advance one step further, in affirming the following: Bergson seems a privileged figure, inscribed as such not only in the vitalist tradition, but in the perspective of what I would call the "history of (non)-organic vitalism," "history of trans valuation," or the "genealogy of genealogy," a perspective that inherently implies the critique of nothingness, an open and finite organology, and a particular view of pathology and the political. It is there that, in a certain way, Bergson inscribes himself in a great tradition of vitalism. In this history, besides Bergson, we find Spinoza, as well as Darwin, who drew attention to "the history of natural technology, that is, to the formation of the organs of plants and animals as instruments for producing the life of plants and animals." We find Marx, who proposed "the history of the formation of the productive organs of social man, of the material basis for any particular organization of society" (417-418), and Nietzsche, who considered life as an active form of thinking, and thinking as the invention of new possibilities for life.15 We encounter Andre Leroi-Gourhan (1911 SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="14">128 Hisashi Fujita 1986), who developed in his own way Bergson's ideas on life-technology, and Georges Canguilhem (1904-1995), who never stopped asking the question of life as creation of norms, like normativity, by examining life in a complex relation of organism-machine (the question of technicity). The list includes Foucault, in many ways Canguilhem's successor, who saw life as power from outside, both in history and in what he called contemporary bio-politics. We find the question of the individual and of individualization in Gilbert Simondon (1924-1989), and later in Gilles Deleuze, who was a student of Canguilhem, an important reader of Simondon, and a philosophical friend of Foucault. Deleuze wrote, "Everything that I have written is vitalist, or so I hope."16 An investigation of this hypothesis must be deferred to another occasion.

An early version of this text was presented in English at the Collegium Phaenomenologicum 2003: "Thinking through the Difference between Immanence and Transcendence: Levinas, Bergson and Deleuze," Citta di Castello, Italy, July 12, 2003. A French-language version appeared in the University of Tokyo's Revue de Langue et Litterature Erancaises, no. 29, May 2004, pp. 307-331. I would like to thank Deborah Blicq, Taichi Hara, Stephane Legrand, Yoshikazu Nakaji, Guillaume Sibertain Blanc, and Frederic Worms for their helpful comments. Also, as my title suggests, I am indebted to Jacques Derrida's Le Toucher, Jean-Luc Nancy (Paris: Galilee, 2000). 2. This voice or communication can also be a spiritual calling, as Bergson suggests in The Two Sources of Morality and Religion, where a certain vox Dei is described as "a series of appeals made to the conscience of each of us by persons who represent the best there is in humanity" (TS, 68). "We may not hear their voices distinctly, the call has none the less gone forth, and something answers from the depth of our soul" (TS, 53). These great moral figures, who for Bergson are the "great Christian mystics," among others, are an organ of God: "a machine of wonderfully tempered steel, built for some extraordinary feat [....] The mystic soul yearns to become this instrument" (TS, 197-198). 3. Schelling spoke of the "Orgasmus der Krafte," "orgasme des forces" in Les Ages du Monde, 179 [Die Weltalter, 1811-13], and Deleuze, the great "paronymist," in Difference et repetition neologized the word "orgique" [orgic] as a process of saturation or devia tion in which organic representation tends toward the "orgiaque" [orgiac] (61). 4. Derrida declares, "Never mind Bergson, whose recommendation it is to multiply metaphors in order to exceed the deceitful rigidities of concepts, 'abstract ideas, SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="15">Bergson's Hand 129 whether general or simple.' Never mind when he recalls us to the need of this disparate multiplicity of tropological figures: seeing fulfills itself in touching. [....] Bergson is still hierarchizing. And then (shall we say, as Plato does?) he subjects vision to contact" (On Touching, 122-123). The present essay is written in the hope that Bergson, as one of the points of difference between Derrida and Deleuze, may become one of the virtual venues for an encounter between these two philosophers. 5. Jean-Pierre Seris, La Technique (Paris: PUF, coll. "Philosopher," 2nd ed., 2000, p. 177). Seris analyzes and compares two philosophers of life?Bergson and Spengler?and their prognosis (one optimistic, the other pessimistic) for the future that the machine will bring. 6. Note that weapons precede tools. This description is developed in the last chapter of The Two Sources of Morality and Religion: "Now man is necessarily the owner of his tools, at any rate while he is using them. But since they are things apart from him, they can be taken away from him; it is easier to acquire them ready-made than to make them. Above all, they are meant for action in some specific avocation, to be used for hunting or fishing, for example; the group of which he is a member may have fixed its choice on a forest, a lake, a river; another group may find it more convenient to settle in that very same place than to look further afield. There is no nothing for it but to fight the matter out [....] the origin of war is ownership, individual or collective, and since humanity is predestined to ownership by its structure, war is natural" (TS, 245). 7. It is in this context that we must situate the passage where Bergson makes a significant digression on "manual labor, on the role it can play in school": "We forget that the intellect is essentially the faculty of manipulating matter [....] Why then should the intellect not profit by manual training? [....] it is quite natural for the child to try its hand at constructing. [.... ] Let us give the child exercise in manual training, but without allowing that teaching to sink to the level of a drill [un manoeuvre]. Let us apply to a real master, that he may perfect the touch to the point of making it a sense of touch [un tact]: the intelligence will go from the hand to the head" (CM, 100, my italics). 8. On Leroi-Gourhan's concept of the "tendency toward technology as a coupling of man and matter" and its relation to Bergson's analysis of the organic/inorganic rela tionship, see Bernard Stiegler's La Technique et le temps, Vol. I, "La Faute d'Epimethee," especially the long note on pp. 58-60 (Paris: Galilee, 1994). 9. I stress this term because of its unique ambiguity: "Life, not content with producing organisms, would fain give them as an appendage inorganic matter itself, converted into an immense organ by the industry of the living being" (CE, 161). What does this "industry" mean? 10. It is interesting to note that numerous bergsonians have taken up this metaphor, which Bergson himself later abandons. 11. See J.G. Fichte's The Vocation of Man, trans. W. Smith. Revised and ed. by R.M. Chisholm, NY: The Liberal Arts Press, 1956 [Die Bestimmung der Menschen, 1800]. Jean-Christophe Godard notes in the introduction to his French translation of this work (La Destination de I'homme, GF-Flammarion, 1995) "the two concurrent mean ings of the word Bestimmung: its traditional, ontological meaning, which is the Ger man equivalent of determinatio [determination], of limitation, and its practical meaning of vocation (Stimme = voice), of destination, which presupposes the indetermination of the free being. [...] In moral determination?that is, in the certitude that at this instant and in this place that I occupy in the Whole of the rational world I am called to free self-determination in a certain way, and that a task is assigned to me?we find both the indetermination and the determination of the human being?that is, the two senses of the word Bestimmung" (11-2). 12. This is Derrida's term, which he used apropos of Biran (On Touching, 152). SubStance #114, Vol. 36, no. 3, 2007</page><page sequence="16">130 Hisashi Fujita 13. See Francois Azouvi's Maine de Biran. La science de Vhomme (Paris: Vrin, coll. "Bibliotheque d'histoire de la philosophic"). Also Henri Gouhier's "Maine de Biran et Bergson," in Etudes bergsoniennes, vol. 1, 129-173. 14. Likewise, it is not by chance that precisely here and precisely as metaphorical analogy of creative evolution we find Bergson's "invisible hand of God"?that "Carry the hand from one point to another," like a movement that is both internally a simple indivisible gesture, and externally a multiple, divisible infinity (TS, 275-276). 15. See Pierre Montebello, Vie et maladie chez Nietzsche (Paris: Ellipses, 2001). 16. Pourparlers, 196. Also, "There is a profound link between signs, the event, life, vitalism. It's the power of a non-organic life" (ibid.) Deleuze advances another line in this genealogy: "Between Lucretius, Hume, Spinoza and Nietzsche, there is for me a secret link constituted by the critique of the negative, the culture of joy, hatred for interiority, the exteriority of things and relations, the denunciation of power" (ibid., 14). After Deleuze, will Hans Jonas (1903-1993), celebrated author of Le Principe Responsabilite, be added to this genealogy, with his works on Organisme et liberte or on Le Principe Vie (1997)?
