In March of 2006, Christian Heck, Bonn, Germany, photographed Maya stone monu ments in the Museo de Sitio de Tonina, in the ruins of Tonina, Chiapas, Mexico. Among the sculptures he photographed is a fragmentary human figure in the round, bearing several hieroglyphic blocks (cover; Fig. 1), obviously discovered in the course of archaeological investigations conducted by the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, under the direction of Juan Yadéun. Presently no data are avail able on the original location of this object. The sculpture is a hitherto unpublished inscribed statue from Tonina and is not documented in the four published fascicles that appeared between 1983 and 2006 in connection with Harvard Univer sity's Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions (appreviated CMHI) Project (Mathews 1983; Graham and Mathews 1996 and 1999; Graham et al. 2006). Since Heck only took photographs of the front of the sculpture, it is not possible to determine if it is a free-standing sculpture or an architectural décoration with a horizontally projecting tenon at the back, although the latter possibility is highly convincing. Despite the fact that the anthropomorphic figure is decapitated, the overall condition of the carving is good and the glyphs are only slightly eroded. The sculpture in the round portrays a male human figure bound with a rope that holds the arms at the back. The figure is obviously a cap tive or prisoner. Unfortunately, the head of the personage and a portion from one Shoulder are missing. The captive is in a kneeling position. With regard to Ornaments and costume, the remnants of oblong, hanging ear Ornaments are depicted, as well as a wide loincloth apron. On the front of the statue hi eroglyphic inscriptions appear on the Shoulders, on top of the ehest, and a vertical glyphic band embellishes the loincloth apron. The inscriptions encompass in total six glyph blocks, namely one each on both Shoulders, one on the upper ehest, and three placed vertically on the apron. Elisabeth Wagner and Christian Prager, University of Bonn, Germany (written communication, November 2007), have studied the text of the monument and offer the following decipherments and commentaries: 'The inscription on the sculpture Starts with the Calendar Round date 7 Ben 11 Sip (written here as 7 Ben 10 Sip). At first sight, there are two alternatives for placing it in the Long Count: either 9.13.2.1.13, 9.15.14.14.13, or 9.187.9.13. But similarities in style and composition of the monument to other epigraphically dated monuments allow one to assign it to the reign of 'Ruler 8' (K'inich ? Chapaat). The event recorded is represented by the glyph for capture, followed by the name of the captive on the loincloth of the figure. His name consists of three glyph blocks, the first of which gives the personal name as IK'-na-la, Ik'nal. The following one records him as a noble of Puwal. The name ends with the title Ba Ajaw, 'first noble lord' - so far a unique example of this title at Tonina (Table 1). Of particular interest is the spelling of the toponym in the captive's title of origin, pu-wa-la. It represents a purely phonetic spelling of the so-called throne or pillow hieroglyph, which occurs several times in the inscriptions of Tonina, sometimes prefixed by the syllable /pu/. Designating a specific toponym, puwal or puwa, the pillow glyph T609a represents a logograph that is probably read POW or PUW (Prager and Wagner n.d.). The consistent use of /pu/ as an initial phonetic complément for T609a at Tonina may indícate a specific local Fig. 1.

But the variety of stone used as well as stylistic and compositional similarities to other sculptures from Tonina allow at least a rough attribution to the sculptural style dur ing the reign of K'inich Baaknal Chaak and his successors. In style and composition our sculpture is identical to Monu ments 151 and 152 (Graham et al. 2006, pp. 85-86), though it is slightly higher. The latter two monuments represent kneel ing bound captives as well, both with their individual ñames on their loincloths. Ail sculptures have a tenon on their back, showing that they originally were architectural sculptures. Comparing the face - particularly the rendering of the eyes - of Monument 151 with that of Monument 146 (Gra ham et al. 2006, pp. 77-79), we see a very strong similarity as pronunciation that differs from a commonly known one. One if they were both carved by the same hand. Another stylistic may speculate that perhaps an loi to lui sound-shift is présent trait is the slightly plump and disproportionate rendering of here, perhaps based on a dialectal variant, an innovation or the body in contrast to the fine modelling of the face and the préservation of an archaic form of a lexeme designating ornaments worn. The latter portrays an Aj K'uhuun whose a (throne) pillow. Scanning the dictionaries we could find name is recorded in the dedication inscription on the base of the root /puh/ and its cognate /poh/ in Tzotzil and Yucatec Monument 146. The Calendar Round date is given as 7 Imix (Laughlin 1975, p. 289; 1988, p. 289; Barrera Vásquez 1980, 14 Xul. The additional record of G3 allows us to define the pp, 671, 672) with meanings such as "in ated, bloat, swell, precise Long Count position as 9.17.16.10.1 7 Imix 14 Xul. ballooning, baggy", meanings that clearly can be applied to If the stylistic assessment presented here proves to be correct, pillows as well.

Unfortunately, the lack of contextual information prevenís But the strongest evidence to place the sculpture in Ruler a precise assignment of the sculpture discussed here to a spe- 8's reign is the captive's name on Monument 152, Chan Aj Chih Aj Pomoy. This individual is seemingly an important captive of Ruler 8, since his capture on 9.17.18.13. 9 (789 AD) is recorded retrospectively on Monument 159 (Graham et al. 2006, p. 94), deidicated by Ruler 8 (Martin and Grube 2000, p. 188). In sum, one can assume that the three captive statues were ail carved by the same Workshop and perhaps even part of a particular sculptural programme on a building commissioned to commemorate the victorious military campaigns of Ruler 8. If ail three sculptures were part of the same programme, the fact that one sculpture is slightly larger than the others and that this one is the only one of the group giving the date and verb of the event commemorated, one may speculate that our sculpture was the main or centre piece of a group of sculptures constituting a line-up of captives taken in Ruler 8's various war campaigns." The motif of captives bound with ropes is a very fréquent one in the large corpus of sculptures from Tonina (cf. Patrois 2000, Figs. 6-8). In a study of the typology of monumental stone sculptures at Tonina, Claude Baudez (Becquelin and Baudez 1982, pp. 638-641), classified various représentations of captive statues; among the sculptures which he describes under the type "statues de captifs, Variété 2: agenouillés" he listed Monuments 38, 41, 100 and 108. Generally, Tonina captives are rendered either in low relief on wall panels or in a three-dimensional form, mostly representing tenoned architectural décorations. The sculpture described and illustrated here is comparable to several similar Tonina kneeling prisoner statues in the round, for example Tonina Monuments 38 (Graham and Mathews 1996, p. 85), 41 (Graham and Mathews 1996, p. 98), 100 (Graham and Mathews 1996, p. 123), 108 (Graham and Mathews 1999, Fig. 2.
