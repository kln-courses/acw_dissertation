The nineteenth century appears to be emi¬ nently religious. It is so from choice, and freely, and consequently in a manner more profound and deep-felt, than all preceding ages. A greater number of religious writings, also, appear among all sects, and in all languages; the impression that these writings produce on the public is greater; and religious opinions, among all classes of society, are treated with a higher degree of respect than formerly. " Much has been said," says M. de Bonald, " of the progress of the age, and the commotion in men's minds, and no one has noticed a phe¬ nomenon worthy of arresting the attention of the statesman and the legislator. In the pre- B i</page><page sequence="6">2 PROGRESS OF ceding century, the minds of men, misled by false doctrines, were violently opposed to re¬ ligion; but, having arrived at the height of its power, the irreligious influence stopped, or rather a contrary influence, wholly religious, carried the public mind in an opposite direction. Bonaparte knew this, and profited by it. Since that period the religious feeling has been con¬ stantly on the increase, as the situation of Eu¬ rope demonstrates to every attentive eye. Who cannot recognise its influence in the com¬ motions of Greece?—in the troubles of Ireland? —or in the vague restlessness which impels men to meditation on momentous topics? From one extremity to the other, Europe is animated with a religious ferment at work in the mass of the social body. Mens agitat molem."* This ferment has not been remarked merely by Catholic and Royalist Frenchmen; a Pro¬ testant preacher, in a Swiss republic, lately alluded to it at a Missionary meeting for the conversion of pagan nations. " In order," he says, " that the work of missions might be ac¬ complished, it was necessary that there should be a general revival of religion among many * Vide the Speech of M. de Bonald on the Law of Sacrilege.

The reviving breeze is felt universally; and, as at the return of spring, it penetrates to continents and isles, to the val- lies and the tops of the mountains—to the palace and the cottage. Every where we behold souls awakening to the feeling of their miseries—fear¬ ing the wrath to come—turning to the Holy Scriptures — flying to Jesus and receiving peace."* We might also bring forward, in testimony of this phenomenon, the most independent philoso¬ phers of the age, who, far from shaking religion by their attacks, like their predecessors, on the contrary zealously labour to consolidate the union of religion and reason: we might also refer to the antiquaries, who, like Creuzer,-\ have so unremit¬ tingly laboured to unfold and explain to us the religions of antiquity; or the excellent work of * Vide Speech of M.

Benjamin Constant, which unites the most extensive learning with the most brilliant ideas, and where the religious feeling is shown to be a fundamental law of our nature. Others, it is true, speak in quite a different tone. They accuse the age in which we live of eagerness to demolish all religious belief, of blindly and arrogantly endeavouring to precipitate it into atheism. But they who speak thus appear less in the character of pious men, than of men who wish to make religion an instrument of political power: they threaten and insult the age in order to assume an air of superiority, and usurp the rights of a divine mission. They either deceive or wish to deceive us, and the want of consistency in their words and their actions is sufficient to convince us of it. In choosing the present moment for unfolding their ambitious projects, they must certainly have perceived a powerful auxiliary in the dispositions of the people; but, in attempting to deceive they are deceived themselves; it is the religious feeling which has appeared with such vigour and freedom in every bosom : it is neither the spirit of priestly submission, nor of superstition or fanaticism, passions that the priesthood de¬ pends upon for founding anew its empire. The religious spirit, as it appears in the great body</page><page sequence="9">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. O of the present generation, is a spirit of tolera¬ tion, of charity and of respect for all varieties of opinion: the priestly spirit, as it appears in a part only, but the most stirring and active part of an ambitious clergy, is a spirit of exclusion, of intolerance and of anathema. This twofold action, arising from a consoling and an elevating faith, and from the abuses which some would make of it, is unquestionably one of the most interesting subjects that can arrest our atten¬ tion, for it is here we may look for the promise of the future. A toleration of, and respect for all creeds, is, we said, the peculiar character of the religious spirit of the present day. It seems to be uni¬ versally acknowledged that all religions are true, so far as they are as so many different languages in which the feeble creature expresses its respect, its gratitude, and its love for the great Creator. This identity of religious feeling- is the fundamental idea of the first book of the great work of M. Benj. Constant, one of our most eloquent orators and able writers. M. Constant has shown the invariable appearance of this feeling in man in the most barbarous as well as in the most civilized states, always asso¬ ciating with his purest and noblest aspirations, and forming the foundation of what M. Constant terms religious forms. These forms, as society</page><page sequence="10">b PROGRESS OF advances in knowledge, become better adapted to their end. In this feeling of the necessity of religion, which is inherent in the human race, M. Constant beholds a mysterious -tie uniting man with the invisible world ; a proof, a first revelation as it were, of that great object of fear and love towards whom the hearts of all created beings turn, and for whom the various modes of worship express but a common sentiment.* In analysing the religious feeling, we shall per¬ haps go still further than M. Constant, as, in¬ deed, seems incumbent on us; and, instead of regarding it as a primitive attribute of the human race, we shall find that it is the neces¬ sary result of the preserving passions of our nature : love, fear, the feeling of our need of help, and of faith, for which the present world is not sufficient, and which seek the sphere of infinity.f We shall find, also, that by revealing * De la Religion consideree dans sa Source, ses Formes, et ses Developpemens, liv. i. f These pleasing desires of love, fear, and hope, which are inherent in human nature, appear to me expressed with a deep feeling of truth in the following lines of M.

We shall find that our religious knowledge is still mingled with error, but that this knowledge is not religion, which consists entirely in a feeling acting simultaneously on all men. Love is the first preserving principle of our nature. Without that love which unites the individuals of the human race—which identifies their happiness with that of their fellow-crea¬ tures—which places infancy and feebleness under the protection of experience and strength Ce destin des mortels egares sur la terre, Cet avenir obscur, cet immense mystere, Le secret de la vie et celui de la mort, Et l'immortalite promise comme un port, Oil, long-tems eprouve sur l'ocean du monde, L'homme verra finir sa course vagabonde, Sans que 1'afFreux neant, qu'une sombre terreur, Qu'un invincible instinct repousse avec horreur, Puisse engloutir jamais, dans un commun abime Le vice et la vertu, l'innocence et le crime : Ces sujets solennels et de doute et d'effroi Dans mes esprits troubles reviennent malgre moi.

Our hearts, there¬ fore, were formed to love, and endowed with an unbounded susceptibility to it, that, in our pro¬ gress through life, as its ties multiply around us, and our mental powers "become developed, it might still be inexhausted. But, the more we know of creatures, the more we find them incapable of satisfying our desires. We are in quest of perfection which is not granted them; we ask for greater goodness, beauty and know¬ ledge ; for higher degrees of power and love. Our desires thus raise us to the idea of infinite perfection, which is God, and the necessity we are under of loving has revealed Him to us. Fear, no less than love, is one of the preserv¬ ing principles of the human race. If we fled not from danger it would be impossible to pre¬ serve existence amidst the blind forces which threaten us on every side. If we had no fear before knowledge, we should fall a thousand times from our inexperience. Thus the dread of what is unknown is strongest in infancy, and in the savage state, which is the infancy of society—conditions of life that are most sub¬ ject to such influence. Every unknown power, real or imaginary, while it excites fearr leads also to adoration, because every manifestation</page><page sequence="13">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 9 of power appears as God. As the prospect extends, the unknown retires before it, and every such manifestation appears but as the work of a single cause, which is still hid, but which becomes greater in proportion as every secondary cause disappears. Fear reveals the almighty power of the Deity, thus leading to the same result as love. Pain no less serves to warn us of the pre¬ sence of danger, and also to develope the social principle. By pain we learn the need we have of consolation and assistance. We address our¬ selves to our fellows when we suffer—we put confidence in their prescriptions,—and if any of them pretend to associate unknown influences with the relief he gives, we put faith in his incantations and unknown powers — in the greatest of all powers—in God, whom our wants reveal as the physician and the consoler of every creature. Independently of this need of aid, faith is ano¬ ther of the wants of our nature. To believe is at once the faculty of instruction and of imagi¬ nation. The progress of one individual in knowledge and experience would never profit another, if man were not disposed to place con¬ fidence and to believe in what he does not com¬ prehend. But the faculties given us for our</page><page sequence="14">10 PROGRESS OF welfare are sources also of pleasure by their mere exercise. Thus there is a pleasure in love, in fear, in hope, and in gratitude, as there is also a pleasure in faith; and this latter, which belongs to the imagination, is the stronger as the belief required is the greater, and in pro¬ portion as faith is exercised on what is least credible. We need faith to elevate us to the infinite God, so far above the grasp of our comprehen¬ sion; but faith, credulity, and furious attach¬ ment to a system in proportion to its absurdity have been the cause of the corruption of reli¬ gion, of the profane use made by the priesthood of the religious passions, and of the reluctance shown by the people to follow in their religion the progress of the human mind. And so it is with the other affections implanted in man and necessary to his preservation; if we follow them we shall perceive that, after having directed him to his immediate and material good, they all raise him to a supreme and infi¬ nite Being, revealed by the sentiment of reli¬ gion ; that all, in proportion as his view extends, and his mental powers expand, exhibit more clearly to his contemplation, God, all-powerful, good and wise; God, spirit and truth. These passions and affections, so necessary</page><page sequence="15">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 11 for our preservation, which at first led the savage to a belief in superior beings, which afterwards informed him that these powers were intelligent, and when a greater degree of light at last shone upon him, led him to unite them in one God alone—everywhere present—these passions and affections have at the same time directed man in the worship he should render to the Supreme Being or to inferior powers. From the consideration of the human faculties man rose to the contemplation of the divine. By degrees he arrived at the knowledge of Almighty Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, while the per- fectionof the object adored led to moral improve¬ ment. To be worthy of God, we must study to resemble him. Thus, morals arose from the religious sentiment; and although they were lower as knowledge was more limited, yet they always sprung from the desire of being assimi¬ lated to the object of worship, and the feeling of the necessity of this, in order to the divine favour. This original union of morality and religion, as ideas necessarily connected, is im¬ planted by nature in the human heart, in spite of the efforts to prevent it, which have ever been made by those who make a trade of religion. Indeed we have ever seen that the deeper any sentiment is, the more universal and inhe-</page><page sequence="16">12 PROGRESS OF rent in the nature of man, so much the more have the ambitious sought to turn it to their own advantage; so much the more has religion, originally pure from the heart of man, been corrupted to his own advantage by the priest, who, not contented with the generous passions which gave it birth, has connected with it all the malignant passions of the human breast, and turned the universal bond of the human race into a barrier of discord and a source of persecution. Religion, in reference to man, should be pro¬ gressive ; discovering truth in proportion to his ability to perceive it, and advancing in purity and perfection with the progress of knowledge and civilization. But this progress would destroy the influence of the priesthood, since it implies the inferiority of the present to the future teacher. Thus the priesthood has everywhere endeavoured to arrest the progress of religion, or to render it retrograde, and to attain this, has made its essence to consist in creeds and faith, not in love, or progress towards perfec¬ tion, or morality. Creeds, or dogmas in religion, are the expla¬ nation given by the priest of that which is least known to us, and often of what is incomprehen¬ sible, in reference to that spiritual world, of the</page><page sequence="17">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 13 existence of which we have only the presenti¬ ment. According to the degree of knowledge diffused among mankind at the period of the formation of the various religions, these dogmas are either systems (more or less rude) of the origin of all things, or true notions revealed to us on the divinity, but communicated in human language, and consequently imperfect and ob¬ scure; or they consist of mysteries depicted in terms susceptible of various interpretations, to which indeed our understandings may submit, but no more, since real belief is only in propor¬ tion to comprehension. Religious forms is the term applied by M. Constant to all that part of religion which varies in different nations, while the religious sentiment is everywhere the same. This expresses our idea but imperfectly; we go further, and affirm boldly that religion does not consist in dogmas, but in the connection of man with the Deity; not in the idea that is formed of God, or in the words by which it is expressed. Religion is a feeling, and not a science; it is the expression of the love and gratitude of the creature towards its Creator, and of its efforts at conformity to his will. Religion is not the opinion formed of the essence of God, nor the words by which a feeble description is attempted</page><page sequence="18">14 PROGRESS OF of what human language can never describe, nor the human understanding conceive. It is evi¬ dent that the conception we form of the Deity must ever be proportioned to our finite capa¬ city, and that it must vary with the mental powers of individuals. In expressing by words our belief of what is incomprehensible in the Deity, we may indeed repeat the same language, but the meaning of these words, in the appre¬ hension of each individual, will be as different as one human understanding differs from another. Our theology, that is, our knowledge of God, or, to translate it still more accurately, our speaking of God, is merely the expression of the knowledge or ignorance of each person consi¬ dered with relation to that of another; it does not depend on us; it can neither offend the Deity, nor please him. It is therefore a religious as well as a chari¬ table feeling which leads us to respect the belief of other men, and other sects, however different from our own; for however ignorant and barbarous it may be, with whatever errors it may be enveloped, it is worship offered to the Deity, who will accept it under whatever name it is presented to him. The poor savage acknowledges the presence of a God in the threatening thunder and in the</page><page sequence="19">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 15 fertilizing shower; in the consuming fever and in the medicinal plant which restores his wasted strength. He seeks this God, and thinks he has found him in his cabin or in the neighbour¬ ing forest. The object of his worship is often a shapeless stone, a tree or a bird; his error is very gross; nevertheless, when he prays to it, he thinks of the invisible being, or the being whose power is invisible, who is more power¬ ful than man, who rewards and punishes, and whose protection he implores. But, there is only one Being of this description in the world. Afterwards, however, he finds another idol, and adores it also, believing it endowed with another part of invisible power. One has ripened his harvest—another has multiplied the game around him ; one protects the banks of his river —another threatens him from the cascade of a neighbouring torrent. He is as yet ignorant that it is the same being wrhom he meets with in all these places. From the cloud one hand descends to bless him; one hand chastens him, one hand sustains him in adversity, and one hand heals his wound: his eyes cannot as yet pierce through the cloud and behold the many- handed Being who has everywhere followed him. His gratitude looks but at the hand he has seen or fancied; but the Being who has set</page><page sequence="20">16 PROGRESS OF all these agents in motion accepts the homage, which, with all its imperfections, and under various names, is still addressed to Him. • It was God whom the savage adored under those gross symbols termed fetiches by our priests.* * M. Constant himself has adopted the term fetiches and fetichism for denoting the first state of religion preceding the anthropomorphism of the gods and the sacerdotal organization. The injurious name of fetiche is not without its inconvenience, for as it arises from a false idea, it may give birth to others in its turn. Feticho and fetichcro in Portugueze signify witch¬ craft and sorcerer. The same words are found in all the lan¬ guages of the south : hechizo and hechicero in Spanish ; fattuc- chierie and fattucchicre in Italian. The intolerant priests who first landed on the coast of • Africa with the Portugueze navi¬ gators, when they perceived the religion of the natives to be different from their own, regarded it as offered to the devil. They did not deny that there was something supernatural in their religion, but then they attributed it to their incantations and to the power of evil spirits. When the French, in their turn, came in contact with these idolaters, having a little more charity and a little less faith, they saw, in the prodigies in which the savage believed, nothing but the juggling and slight of hand of the priests, to whom they gave the name of jugglers, the same name which they had given to the valets of the troubadours. The worship of unknown powers is not, how¬ ever, witchcraft, and its priesthood is no more a system of jug¬ gling than any of the succeeding religious systems. It is the first step made by man in the search after God—the first wor¬ ship rendered to his most striking manifestations. M. Constant knows the meaning of the words he employs as well as we do,</page><page sequence="21">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 17 It was God whom the Greek and the Roman adored, even when every one of his attributes was exalted into divinity; and it is the same God whom we adore, as Jews, Mahometans, and Christians; for there is no other. In the same manner that, as a Christian, I have re¬ jected the personification of Almighty Power assumed by paganism ; I reject, as a Protestant, the mysteries of Catholicism. Let us reflect, however; perhaps we shall find that we differ only in name, while we agree in the religious worship that we offer in the same spirit to the same God. The Catholic priest tells me, that in the consecrated host the Deity is present. I am of the same belief with the Catholic, for the Deity is everywhere present; but no, he replies, it is the Divinity himself changed into this substance ; our eyes behold him; all our senses witness him on the altar. Does he deny then the omnipresence of the Deity quite the contrary. It is a part of the mystery which he teaches, that the Deity is bodily present at the same time on all the altars where the same mystery is accomplishing; while, also, his presence fills the universe. I do not com- although these terms seem to have misled him, and throw n sort of obscuiity, even on the first chapters of his second volume, where he afterwards attains such an elevation.</page><page sequence="22">18 PROGRESS OF prehend this, it is true, but I am no longer shocked at his belief. If I may be allowed the expression, the presence of the Deity is repre¬ sented under different degrees of intensity—a sentiment which surpasses my powers of com¬ prehension, but does not subvert them. Among Protestants there is a sect tefmed Unitarians, because, although they admit the divine mission of Jesus Christ, they do not ac¬ knowledge his divinity. Suppose them to be right. We know what troubles this controversy has excited in the church since the commence¬ ment of Christianity. It, however, more than the preceding, is a mere quarrel about words. Do the Trinitarians acknowledge three inde¬ pendent gods, opposed to each other? No, certainly. Do they think that we can please one and displease another The answer is similar. The same attributes, the same goodness, power and omnipresence, are the proofs of that consub- stantiality which the orthodox believe and teach. Words may distinguish the different persons of the Trinity, but they are always regarded as One in the prayers of the Christian. The Tri¬ nitarian speaks of God under three names; I speak of Him under one. The Trinitarian has certain fixed notions on the independence of the various faculties, which he terms divine persons,</page><page sequence="23">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 19 of this infinite Being; but they are beyond my comprehension, and therefore I cannot dispute them. But of what importance is it to me that he calls Him by turns Jesus and Holy Ghost, whom I always call God Am I not persuaded that by whatever names he is addressed, the Supreme Being will listen alike to the prayers of all his creatures Am I shocked at the name of Gott or Dios bestowed upon God in the mouth of a German or a Spaniard? Why should the name of Christ bestowed on the Ruler of the Universe shock me more Will God, infinitely good, refuse the homage which is presented to him under another name than that by which I address him Hitherto I have reasoned as if I were right and others wrong, but perhaps it is I that am in error. Perhaps it is my blindness that can¬ not discover the Divinity in Christ;—in the sacrament; — in the various manifestations adopted by others. And of what consequence is that? Have I therefore refused to worship Him? Although I have not prayed to Him as the Sacrament, or as Christ, have I not addressed Him as God? Although I do not employ the same names or the same symbols as others, is not my worship always addressed to Him? Have I prayed to another God, the rival of the</page><page sequence="24">20 PROGRESS OF Ruler of the Universe It is on this supposition **ij&amp;t ~f that blasphemy would be committed. This would degrade the Divinity to a level with the kings of the earth, and would suppose a divi¬ sion of power, a spirit of enmity and rebellion to his government. Intolerance still cherishes the remains of polytheism. The more spiritual religion becomes, the idea of one God as Al¬ mighty, and perfectly Wise and Good, is better comprehended^ we perceive better the folly of disputing about words, and see how all men- agree in their search after God. Perhaps I shall be told that I thus destroy faith, to which the Apostles of Christianity at¬ tached so much importance. Faith is a word of various import: when it represents a virtue it is equivalent to confidence, and signifies that union of love, fear and hope, which connects man with the Deity. It cannot mean the knowledge of that which is beyond his attain¬ ment. But faith, we are still told, is exercised on the historical part of revelation; this is not the case: the history of revelation is history, and is amenable to the laws of criticism, like every other history; it requires deep research, vast erudition, the talent of estimating truth and appreciating evidence; it is founded on the</page><page sequence="25">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 21 knowledge of man, which explains the rise of opinions, and on the knowledge of languages, which enables us to correct the errors of trans¬ lation, to trace traditions to their source, and compare them. In short, it is a science, and one of the most vast and complicated that can be investigated by man. Now, religion, the homage of the creature to its Creator, cannot be a science, for it is a want of our nature, it is both a pleasure and a duty to all: it has its source in the heart, and cannot be denied even to the ignorant and uninformed. I am very far from concluding, however, that all religions are addressed to the true God, that all are equally true, and that choice is indiffe¬ rent. But it is not the truth of their dogmas which creates a difference among them of which we ourselves are to be the judges. Our view, too feeble to discover truth in the sky, can at the utmost recognize it upon earth. It is by the influence of religion on our conduct here, that we may with the greatest certainty arrive at that system which is best. Our opinions of the Deity, on his essence, his persons, his names, and his history, if such a term can be used in speaking of him, can neither change nor offend him; for He will not reproach us with our weakness or ignorance; they cannot hinder Him</page><page sequence="26">22 PROGRESS OF from hearing us, although our opinions influence ourselves and our conduct. From God reveal¬ ing himself to us as the ideal, the unbounded source of all perfection, we derive the sentiment that our duty towards him consists in a con¬ stant effort at self-improvement. The attributes of the Deity are the beacon which points out our duty; and an absurd creed, if it does not render us culpable before God, at least renders us unfortunate, since it degrades us. A strict union connects the dogmas of every religion with the conduct of those who profess it, particularly when these dogmas are fashioned by the priesthood according to its interests. It would be easy to show how one creed has rendered men cruel and unmerciful; how ano¬ ther has checked their progress in the arts and plunged them in indolence; how a third has given them a distaste for the exercise of rea¬ son, and accustomed them to rest satisfied with absurdity; how another, in yielding them up to an ascetic enthusiasm, has enslaved them to that sensual influence which it pretended to have vanquished; how almost all, in short, if they have not changed vice into virtue, have at least reversed the order of moral duties. If morality is the best criterion of the value of religions, moralists and historians, who know</page><page sequence="27">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 23 present times and can compare them with the past, are of all men the best able to confirm the truth proclaimed at the beginning of this sketch —that our age is religious, and more so than preceding ages, because it is more moral. Morality profits by every step made in the pro¬ gress of reason. When nations become civilized, the voice of morality is better heard, and its injunctions, perhaps, better observed. Its progress is from itself, it acquires all the regu¬ larity of a rational system, confirms the moral sense, and corrects the prejudices that are sometimes mistaken for it. It is when seen in all its beauty that we blush at the atrocities and shameful deeds by which our forefathers sometimes thought they honoured the Deity. Historians, indeed, are unanimous in decla¬ ring that the more they study past times the more they are struck with the moral superio¬ rity of our own; the more they feel that we have risen above that confusion in the princi¬ ples of right and wrong which formerly pre¬ vailed ; that we are less given to invoke religion as a cloak to the greatest atrocities, and that we have less to reproach ourselves with on the score of barefaced lying and villainy. Certainly we do not mean to say that public morality has made all the progress it ought to</page><page sequence="28">24 PROGRESS OF make; which it, no doubt, will make; or that religion influences the public affairs of go¬ vernment as powerfully as it already acts on the great body of the people. Great public crimes, committed before our eyes, while they fill us with horror, lead us sometimes to doubt of the religious advancement which we have endeavoured to point out. It is sufficient to mention Africa, condemned by the continu¬ ance of the slave trade to endure more suffer¬ ings and atrocities every year than was pro¬ duced by the French revolution during its whole progress;—Greece, devoted by an exe¬ crable policy to the massacre and slavery, or the apostacy of all its inhabitants;—Spain, at the moment when she endeavoured to get rid of her barbarous institutions, plunged anew beneath the yoke of a fanatical population, who destroy all the knowledge and virtue above their own level. Yet even these remarkable and fatal in¬ stances of corruption attest the progress of public morality. They who led the states of Europe into this sanguinary course, belong not to our age; all their opinions are retrograde, and their politics are still those of past ages. Even those who secretly encourage the slave trade cannot speak of it in public without stig¬ matizing it as a scourge which they will use all</page><page sequence="29">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 25 their efforts to abolish. But it is not half a cen¬ tury since the slave trade was an object of the ambition and emulation of every government, and none blushed at it. An universal outcry from every corner of Europe has been raised against the sacrifice of Greece, and in this matter politics must soon give way to public opinion. In the sixteenth century, however, Henry II. attempted in like manner to sacrifice Italy to the Turks, to which he had invited' Soliman and Barbarossa. In the same ranks with the Turks, Frenchmen were to be seen fighting; a Grand Prior of Malta landed them on the coast of Italy, and it was not the fault of Henry II. that Naples, Rome, and Milan did not share the same fate as Chios or Ipsara in our own days. Spain, at length, will put the Holy Alliance to the blush, and will compel that confederation to raise her from her state of anni¬ hilation. The long anarchy of Poland was the work of the neighbouring powers; for ages they laboured to drive that unfortunate country more and more into suffering, ruin and civil war, and then they blushed not at the last fatal act. Let us hope that the triumph of morality is at last approaching; we see the seeds ger¬ minating in every heart; we hear their triumph proclaimed by all the organs of public opinion.</page><page sequence="30">26 PROGRESS OF The heads of government cannot long resist this influence; and when morality shall have given the law to politics, religion will have achieved a victory of much more importance than any that can be promised to it by the missionary. Hitherto we have endeavoured to show how religious feeling was the natural and necessary result of men's faculties; how each affection, each want of our nature, revealed to us the Di¬ vinity ; how each step we made in intelligence drew us nearer to him; but how, nevertheless, whatever was the degree of our civilization or of our barbarism, our knowledge or our igno¬ rance, under whatever name we adored the Divinity, into whatever number of persons or manifestations we ignorantly divided the exer¬ cise of his omnipotence; it was always to the One Being that we addressed our homage, so that, by the essence of religion, adoration, and our aspiration after perfection, which assimilates us to the All-perfect Being, we were in harmony with all the nations of the earth. Whence comes it then that religion has be¬ come a banner of persecution and ill-will; that, nourished by sentiments of humility, perfection, and love, she has almost always inspired her ministers with so much acrimony, with so</page><page sequence="31">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 27 many expressions in which contempt, aversion, and the desire to destroy those who are not of the same way of thinking as themselves, show themselves in so hideous a form? Whence comes it that the language of controversy is the only one which has been remarked to be com¬ pletely destitute of charity in any form The spleen of the devotee is but too apparent in all communions. Odious expressions are but too often interchanged between them, such as we observe in almost all confessions of faith : We abhor all the heresies, all the diabolical inven¬ tions of our adversaries ; ice pronounce them to be accursed! The spirit of Christianity, however, seemed at last to be prevailing over that of the priest¬ hood; charity, which covers the errors of others, humility, which reminds us of our own, were beginning to triumph over the habit of re¬ ligious execration, when, behold there appears in the Catholic church a sect, which, under pretence of reviving the zeal, and rebuking the lukewarmness of the members of its own com¬ munion, renews its imprecations against all who are out of its pale. The ' Memorial Catho- liquc,' the ' Amide la Religion et du Roi,' overflow with bitter expressions of contempt and detes¬ tation for those who do not concur in the opi-</page><page sequence="32">28 PROGRESS OF nionsof these journals;* a considerable number of men of letters assist in editing them, and the most eloquent of them all, the Abb6 de la Mennais, signalizes himself by his philippics against the civil and political order under which Frenchmen live; he seems in his ardent zeal to call for the renewal of those human sacrifices, at which Christianity has so long had cause to blush. Let us not hesitate to confess it: it is because religion is an instrument of power, that it has been so often polluted with a passion the most irreligious, the most destructive of all charity— hatred of those who do not think with us. Re¬ ligious sentiment, so powerful, so universal, so irresistible, so pure in its origin and its design, must have inspired every ambitious mind with the desire to possess it, to become its organs and regulators, and finally to apply its whole force to the accomplishment of their private ends. Perhaps, such is our weakness, that mere opposition to what we hold dearest is sufficient to excite in us animosity towards those who view things in a different light from * To be satisfied that these evil spirits represent only a part of the Catholic church, it is sufficient to consult the other re¬ ligious journals published in opposition to the Memorial, such as La.France Cathuliquc.

Let man then yield himself without scruple to the impulses of his heart, which inspire him to approach the Divinity. There he will find consolation, hope, resolution, all the support which can assist him in the happy accomplish¬ ment of his earthly pilgrimage, all the assistance which can purify his immortal being. But let him be on his guard, when a mere fellow crea¬ ture interposes himself between him andhisGod; let him take care, when any one offers to teach him what he should believe, and is bold enough to assert that on his belief of the doctrine which he lays down to him, will depend the mercy to be shown to him by the God of all creatures. This man, who is no nearer to God than him¬ self, deceives him, whether he is himself in error, or desires to mislead; he deceives him for his own advantage. He wishes to assume power because God is powerful, wisdom be¬ cause God is wise; but he will never assume goodness, because God is good; for goodness never contributes to the establishment of a usurped power. Much rather does he conceal this highest of God's perfections: he depicts him</page><page sequence="34">30 PROGRESS OF as an inflexible judge, an angry avenger, a being whose wrath cannot be appeased but by expia¬ tions and sacrifices; and the very individual who prescribes these sacrifices converts them to his own profit. This man is the only real instigator of idolatry, and of the only idolatry which is a crime. He diverts the homage which ought to be rendered to a benevolent God by his crea¬ tures, to bestow it on all the malicious passions of his fancy. Instead of recognizing the Master of the Universe, always the same, under a thou¬ sand different descriptions, when painted in colours of perfect goodness and power, he figures to deluded men a God who cannot exist. He represents him as wicked and powerful, and demands for him a worship consistent with these execrable attributes. Let not this man, who stigmatizes all who differ from him with the name of Atheist, be surprised at receiving the same appellation; for he disowns the exist¬ ing God, and demands adoration for a being who could never exist. The charge of Atheism is in some degree the watchword of the sect now under consideration: it attaches it to all those whose opinions are not in accordance with its own. All philosophy is in its eyes tainted with Atheism; Protestants are but disguised Atheists. Liberals are Athe-</page><page sequence="35">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 31 ists; the learned bodies which have enlightened France, men distinguished in literature; in fine, all who do not display the most abject sub¬ mission to this particular sect, are Atheists, and the journals which it supports teem with these denunciations. The most eloquent man of the sect goes much further: " The state," says he, " which grants equal protection to the most opposite religions has evidently no religion; the state which pays ministers to preach contradictory doc¬ trines has evidently no faith; the state which has no faith and no religion is evidently Athe¬ istical."* We must begin by observing that this rea¬ soning, which appears so close, rests on a figure of language. It supposes that faith, which is an attribute of the soul, can exist in a creature of imagination, the State, which has no soul. Admit¬ ting, however, this figure, the reasoning is not a whit more correct. The word atheist, taken in a bad sense, must signify one who does not be¬ lieve in the existence of a God, and that is the common acceptation of the word. If Monsieur * -De la Religion consideree dans ses Rapports avec I'Ordre politique et civil, par l'Abbe F. de la Mennais, p. 51.</page><page sequence="36">32 PROGRESS OF de la Mennais understand the word atheist to mean a man who does not speak of God, he may, consistently with etymology, and with the advo¬ cate or tribunal which he refers to as having sanctioned the charge, call the legislature of France atheistical, because it preserves a re¬ spectful silence on the subject of the Deity: but in that case he should apply the same epithet to grammar, to physics, to the instruction in all arts and sciences, which, as well as legislation, regulate the use of the faculties which God has implanted in man, which admit, as a first prin¬ ciple, without proving it, without enjoining it, the existence of God and his laws, and which even dispense with the mention of them: for, although every thing in this world depends on the existence of its Maker, his existence does not depend on human science, nor does it be¬ long to us to sanction it, or to give it weight by the stamp of our authority. Besides, every sentence of this argument is equally false: the state does not grant equal protection to the most opposite religions. It protects all citizens in the manifestation of their virtuous sentiments, in the accomplishment of all their innocent pursuits, more particularly in the varied expression of homage which they</page><page sequence="37">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 33 render to the Divinity, so far at least as the worship which their heart and reason suggest does not interfere with the rights of others. But the state does not protect those forms of worship which are inconsistent with morality, the universal revelation. It should not protect in India the religion which requires the sa¬ crifice of a wife on the funeral pile of her hus¬ band, more than the abominations which out¬ rage public decency: it no longer protects in France those human sacrifices, which were practised for so many ages, under the name of Sermons publics, and which are now known by a foreign appellation, Auto-da-fe; as if the holy inquisition which enjoined them was not of French origin; as if French priests had not sa¬ crificed thousands of victims on the funeral piles; and as if, even at the present day, the Memorial Catholique did not constitute itself the defender of the institution of the Holy Office* The state would, perhaps, have done better to permit each sect to pay its own ministers; but, because it pays ministers of a different faith, it does not follow that the state has no faith. The faith of the state, as far as that ex¬ pression is applicable to it, is confined to that * Memorial Catholique, lre annee, t. ii. p. 199, 267, &amp;c. D</page><page sequence="38">34 PROGRESS OF part of instruction by its ministers which is common to them all. In France, the State pays the clergy of three Christian sects only: it therefore encourages the teaching of those doc¬ trines which they hold in common, namely, the existence of God, the immortality of the soul, and the divine mission of Jesus Christ. But, if the same government pays (which I am not aware of) the Mahometan Muftis and Hindoo Bramins at Pondicherry, although its collective faith is thereby reduced to a smaller number of articles, it is not less true that, in paying various sects, its motive is to encourage all its subjects to persist in the belief of a protecting provi¬ dence, under whatever name that providence may be adored, and in the performance of the duties which that faith imposes on them. Be¬ sides, the faith of the state is nothing more, even according to M. de la Mennais, than the declaration of a fact, namely, the agreement of its members generally on a greater or less num¬ ber of fundamental truths. If they did not agree on any one, the state which had no common faith would not therefore be atheistical; for it would neither deny, nor contend against the existence of a God. " How often," says the same author,* " has it been remarked, that one * Memorial Catholique, 1" annee, t. ii. p. 50.</page><page sequence="39">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 35 would search in vain for the name of God in our Codes; the only monument of this kind where man appears to command man in his own name." A most singular reproach to make to our legis¬ lators, that they had not deceived their country¬ men and the world, by passing off language, wholly human, and labours, stamped with the seal of human imperfection, for the language and the work of God himself! God has chosen, in his wisdom, his own method of commanding, his own manner of communicating with men. If his commands are not understood by all, it would seem that he has not wished it; but he has no need of our mouths to repeat his laws. Let men receive from God himself those laws which come from God ; and as for the regula¬ tions that we make according to our own under¬ standings, interests and passions, let us not blaspheme, by requiring for our own insignifi¬ cance that adoration which is only due to His greatness. Again he says, " the revolution, which has been and continues to be confounded with that which was but a horrible circumstance attend¬ ing it, is nothing, in reality, but the overthrow of doctrines, which, from the commencement of the world, have been the foundation of human d2</page><page sequence="40">36 PROGRESS OF societies.* Depravity, however, is increasing, family ties are relaxed, or rather marriage and paternity are no longer known: a man has his female and his progeny, that is all; and often it is not even known to whom these belong. Vices are propagated, and are exposed without shame to public view. The infant is surrounded by them from its cradle, and their frightful nudity inspires neither horror nor astonishment. To the moral sense which is nearly extinct, suc¬ ceeds a sort of blind movement which stupidly incites the degraded beings towards every thing which promises enjoyment to their gross appe¬ tites. Sometimes a ferocious instinct develops itself amongst them; they become bloodthirsty, and unheard of crimes terrify the world."f If the beautiful style of this declamation mis¬ leads us in spite of ourselves, we are certainly far from admitting the justice of it. Unheard of crimes! While an ambitious priesthood oc¬ cupied the councils of kings, used the name of God as a political tool, and religion as a cloak to. their tyranny, it exhausted the list of crimes; it did. not leave to human depravity the means of inventing new ones. " The revolution under * Memorial Catholique, lrc annee, t. ii. p. 96. f Ibid. p. 83.</page><page sequence="41">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 37' which Europe is labouri?ig," says he, " has blotted out every trace of the Christian monarchy"* Does he confine that epithet to an absolute govern¬ ment, under which the interests and the voice of the people were wholly disregarded? If so, it is not in a moral point of view that it will be permitted him to regret it. Let us compare, since he compels us to do so, the present times with the past; let us search, in this Christian monarchy as he is pleased to call it, for a period to which he cannot except, either because the darkness of ignorance and barbarism was still too dense, or because the reformation which he regards with such horror had not yet begun to agitate men's minds. We shall take the fifty years which followed the death of St. Louis; France was never more Catholic or more priestly. Besides, the virtues of this good man must have influenced those who succeeded him. We shall collect nothing but historical crimes; and from the barrenness of the annals of that period, it may be supposed that the greatest number will escape us. However, let us examine them. In 1276, we shall find the son of St. Louis, Philip III. suspecting his wife of having poison¬ ed his son; and in order to direct the attacks to * Memorial Catholique, 1 annee, t. ii. p. 95.</page><page sequence="42">38 PROGRESS OF be made in the dark, without trial, against her, or her favourite, consulting sorcerers, through the medium of three of the greatest prelates of his kingdom.* In 1282, this same king obtains absolution from his oaths by the Cardinal Chollet, in order to attack his ally and brother in law the King of Arragon.'|" In 1285, he makes himself master of Elna, the chief town of Arragon, and " the legate of the holy Roman church grants absolu¬ tion to the French soldiers, charging them to spare no one, but to massacre all the inhabi¬ tants." All, in fact, perished by the edge of the sword; women, old men, and infants were put to death in the cathedral church, in which they had taken refuge.;}; The grandson of St. Louis, Philip IV., having his pride wounded by Pope Boniface VIII., is not satisfied with imprisoning this old man, and hastening his death by the bad treatment he inflicted on him; above all, he is anxious to load his memory with disgrace; and it is in the infamous trial which this king brought against * Guillelmi de Nangiaco.

The accuser is the most Christian king, the accused a pope, the witnesses are the most distinguished indivi¬ duals of the church and the state, the judges who receive their depositions are cardinals ; but the manners of the present day will not allow us to give translations of them. Whether we believe these witnesses to have been suborned, or that they spoke the truth, the idea which they give us of this filthy period is equally re¬ volting.* In the gratification of his insatiable covetous- ness, the grandson of St. Louis plundered his sub¬ jects by classes, and it was by means of the execu¬ tioner and the torture, that he levied contribu¬ tions on them. The 1st of May, 1291, all the Italian merchants settled in the kingdom were imprisoned on the same day, threatened with the rack, and stripped of all their property.\ On the 22d of July, 1306, all the Jews were also imprisoned; some were threatened, while others were put to death, and all made equally the objects of plunder.j The 13th of October, * Testes examinati per papam seu ejus commissarios.—In Dupuy, pag. 536. 540. t Gio.

Louis X., who filled the throne but a few months, delivered to the executioners the ministers and confidants of his father. Philip V. permitted the Inquisition to multiply its frightful sacrifices with a frequency of which even Spain has given no example, and the monks of the third order of St. Francis, victims to their zeal for evan¬ gelical poverty, to perish by hundreds in the flames.J When, in 1320, the unhappy shepherd pea¬ sants assembled to the number of 50,000 to liberate the holy sepulchre by a new crusade, no other means were found to suppress the .excesses of these poor people, than to drive them without food into the marshy plains of Aigues-Mortes, to hang all who attempted to escape, and to let the rest perish by disease * Canonici Sancti Victoris Vita: Pontif.

This is undoubtedly the period, when, in the eyes of M. de la Mennais, the spirit of the royal saint watched over France; the period during which public education was exclusively in the hands of the clergy; the period at which religion, placed at the head of society, penetrated it throughout. But, if he should prefer any other of these fourteen centuries of what he calls Christian monarchy, because the priests could do all and the people could do nothing, we should be at no loss to point out abundance of crimes in any one of them. We refer him to the sanguinary memorials of the Me¬ rovingians, to the degrading recollections of the last Carlovingians, to the atrocities of the war with the Albigenses, finally to that age of mad- * Contin.

Undoubtedly, we have still much to do to purify and elevate our souls, to amend our lives, and to conform to the regulations of the divine laws ; but, it is in measuring our task with our weakness, that we are able to humble ourselves; it is not by looking back, it is not by comparing ourselves with those who lived under the igno¬ minious yoke under which our necks no longer bend. We certainly shall not say with M. de la Mennais, " certainly we are fallen very low, so low, that it is difficult to conceive that we can descend lower."* Above all, we will not deem ourselves authorized in saying so, because it has been asserted in a College, in a Catholic Church or a Calvinistic chapel.\ We think, on the contrary, that a great step was gained in the improvement of morals and religion, when the Catholic knew that the Protestant, although he does not admit some of the mys¬ teries to which he himself submits his reason, opens his heart to the same God as himself, and considers himself obliged to make the same *»v * De la Religion, p. 100. t Ibid. p. 91.</page><page sequence="48">44 PROGRESS OF efforts to amend his life; when the Protestant, whose ancestors accused the Catholic of idol¬ atry, has learned to respect, as a manifestation of a religious sentiment, the mysteries which he does not admit, to renounce controversy on points beyond the reach of human intelligence, and in place of dwelling on their verbal con¬ tradictions, has ascertained by the heart that there was harmony between them in sentiment. We think that the members of both communions are become more religious, since they have be¬ come more charitable, since they regard a dif¬ ferent sect as only employing a different lan¬ guage from themselves in addressing heaven, and as expressing the same idea by different symbols. Such, indeed, was the happy change to be remarked in the minds of the people after the fever of the revolution had abated. During its continuance, such a change was not even sus¬ pected; men do not engage in combat unless actuated by ardent passions; when they put on their armour and throw themselves into the affray, they see the causes of their dispute in an exaggerated point of view. When the Re¬ formation shook the dominion of the church, when the Revolution overturned the civil power, all the grievances of men presented themselves</page><page sequence="49">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 45 to them in the blackest colours. They were not, nor could they be impartial in correcting the abuses they wished to put down. But, after the victory, when the galling of their former chains had ceased to be painful, their ancient ani¬ mosities gave way to feelings of brotherly love and good will. If they were disposed to err, it was rather in regarding with too much indul¬ gence those whom they had ceased to consider enemies. This disposition was particularly con¬ spicuous amongst the Protestants; the Catholic clergy reaped the benefits of it during the emi¬ gration, and this will even now afford a clue to the conversions of which personal interest was not the leading motive. The same spirit of tolerance and brotherly love is widely diffused throughout England; it is true we must not look for it among the more stubborn portion of. the oligarchy which supports the oppressive laws of which the Irish catholics demand the repeal. For these men, who are much disposed in general to admit the principles of M. de la Mennais, and very desirous, when they come to France, to form connections with all his friends, regard the protestant ascendancy, as they call it, as a means of strengthening the govern¬ ment. But all the liberal part of the nation calls loudly for emancipation, and on this occasion,</page><page sequence="50">48 PROGRESS OF make so complete an apology for both the Ca¬ tholic religion and the Catholic clergy, that the latter may congratulate themselves on observing that the zealous protestants say more in their favour than they could conscientiously say for themselves. At the moment when the revolutionary storm abated, a like good feeling actuated the Ca¬ tholics in favour of the Protestants. While it lasted, every religious feeling of the former formed a ground for their persecution; they were now anxious to recognize as brethren those who were animated by the same sentiment, al¬ though under a different form; they were some¬ times observed entering protestant churches; they were heard to speak of the reformed wor¬ ship with the respect which men owe to what their brethren consider sacred. This good feel¬ ing gave rise to projects for the union of the two churches; a proof of the progress of tole¬ rance. The time will no doubt come when it will be admitted that this union can never take place but in the mutual support of different opinions, and not in the submission of both to an uniform mode of worship. It is painful to observe, at the present day, a very different feeling pervade not only the minds of the most religious, but of the most priestly</page><page sequence="51">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 47 party in the Catholic church. This feeling is apparent in the various journals with which this party inundates France. The priests seem to look with consternation at this fraternity amongst believers in different creeds; in a po¬ litical point of view they are right in entertain¬ ing this feeling; but, how completely are such politics opposed to the real interests of religion! Whenever we cease to hate, to despise, and to persecute those who think differently from our¬ selves, whenever we look on them calmly, we find among them men of pure hearts and un^ biassed judgment, who, reasoning on the same data with ourselves, have arrived at different conclusions on the subject of the spiritual world. This difference leads us to review the ori¬ ginal data on which we all proceed, and to ask ourselves if they are sufficient to produce cer¬ tainty; to inquire whether the extent of our faith is not regulated by the extent of our know¬ ledge; and how it happens that, although truth is single, the impossibility of grasping it en-- tirely, with our limited faculties, reduces each of us to see only a part of it, and in different lights. But to examine our motives for belief, is to examine our belief itself, is to shake off the yoke of authority. If belief is not the property of the priest, he can no longer command, he can</page><page sequence="52">48 PROGRESS OF no longer punish, he has no other superiority over the common believer than that which his knowledge and intelligence ensure; and his duty is reduced to the setting a good example and teaching virtuous lessons. It was not this course of devotion and of sacri¬ fices to which, at the period of re-opening the churches, the clergy considered they must ap¬ ply themselves. They had the recollection of an almost universal dominion in former times; around them the good will and prayers of those who had compassionated their sufferings; a re¬ ligious impulse seemed to have been given to the whole generation which brought them back to the altar. The great and powerful of the land, who had been amongst the first to turn the ancient creeds into derision, and to overthrow the edifice of religion, were the most zealous of all in rebuilding it; the people were horror- struck at the profanations to which, in a moment of excitement, they had become a party. These symptoms have led the priests to flatter them¬ selves that their reign was about to recom¬ mence : they have put forward the pretensions to which they laid claim in their most powerful days; they have preached hatred of every creed not in accordance with their own; they have decried every mode of worship of which they</page><page sequence="53">RELIGIOUS OPINION'S. 49 were not themselves the ministers; they have reorganized the armies of monks by which the church formerly swayed the people ; they have caused sanguinary laws to be passed to pro¬ tect their ceremonies; they have reclaimed their former portion of the riches of the country; they have presented themselves everywhere as candidates for power; and at the very time that they were grasping at the sceptre, they have declared themselves the champions of a government in direct opposition to the wishes of the people; and, finally, they have proclaimed their own rights, while they were denying the rights of man. But they have mistaken both their time and situation. From the bosom of the very people which had recalled them, which -had brought them back to the altar, a voice has risen to answer them : This is not the religion the return of which we called for. " Our hearts were overflowing with gratitude to God for the blessings which he had bestowed so plentifully upon us; we wished to offer him through your ministry the tribute of our thanks¬ givings; we did not ask you to explain to us his incomprehensible being, or to shock our reason by compelling us to repeat contradictory language. We felt ourselves surrounded by his goodness; we did not ask you to speak E</page><page sequence="54">50 PROGRESS OF to us of his vengeance, to threaten us with his judgments, to discover a hell beneath us, whilst his providence is smiling on us from every object in nature. We wished to honour the invisible God, in his visible works, in the most perfect of all, man, whom he has formed after his own image. Our hearts were overflowing with good will towards all creatures, above all our fellow- creatures, who can suffer and enjoy like our¬ selves ; we did not ask you to point out to us the dissonance in the harmony of our prayers, to denounce heresies, and to teach us to hate those whom we would willingly love. We recalled you as men devoted more constantly than ourselves to holy contemplation, to en¬ lighten us with your understandings, and to form us by your example; but not to be our masters; we required of you advice and moral lessons, not commands. We said to you, teach us to adore God. Perhaps we were too hum¬ ble in making this request; for, previous to hearing you, our hearts already adored Him. We never said to you, teach us obedience to men. Politics are not your province. From the moment you speak of human interests, you forfeit all claims to our confidence. You have incessantly stunned our ears with the words the altar and the throne; and you have by the one</page><page sequence="55">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 51 compromised the other. Leave the throne on its national and most secure foundation. All that you have done to establish the divine right of government has only served to make us sus¬ pect that its existence is not for the common benefit. The assistance which you demand of the government in return, only convinces us that you are not, and will not be the ministers of our religious opinions." Such is the language which France in heart makes use of towards that portion of her clergy which calls itself apostolical; such is the language by which she continually demands for herself a religion, but a religion purified, chari¬ table and tolerant. If the clergy succeed in imposing silence on her, she may turn hypocrite; but she will not become more faithful. She will never regret those ages of ignorance and crime which some priests extol as the good times. History, which is now better known, will by her terrible lessons destroy the illusion of those great names which M. de la Mennais is still repeating.

We have endeavoured to show what, since the commencement of the present century, was the progress of religious opinions, both among the people, and the clergy of the Catholic church. We have seen that a fresh zeal ani¬ mated the people, which encouraged them to unite in a spirit of charity and piety; that the priests, on the other hand, mistaking the fer¬ vour which thev remarked in their flocks, thought it a favourable opportunity to preach * De la Religion, p. 6.5. + Ibid. p. 69. f Ibid. p. 85.</page><page sequence="57">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 53 at the same time submission and intolerance; that this variance between the spirit of the clergy and of the people had arrested the pro¬ gress of religious opinions, and might possibly cause them to retrograde. In order, however, to form a correct judgment of the religious progress of this age, it will be right to direct our attention to the Protestant church, which in its turn is roused by a similar fermentation; for, in that also we shall find a redoubled zeal in the people, and an attempt by the heads of some churches to obtain from this fervour, a submission of consciences, an in¬ tolerance of dissenting opinions. However, the Protestant clergy, being appointed in a manner totally different from the Catholic, takes but little part in this contest; and the principle of the reformation being diametrically opposed to the submission of reason, and to in¬ tolerance, the efforts of the bigotted party in this church, far from conciliating, only tend to multiply the number of dissenting opinions, and render more necessary the mutual toleration to which that party is hostile. Protestants have not always understood their own system; they have not always felt that the independence of individual opinions was the essence of their church; they have not al-</page><page sequence="58">54 PROGRESS OF ways renounced uniformity of belief; and they have sometimes felt embarrassed when re¬ proached with the variations in their creeds, and the numerous dissenters that are found among them. And even at the present day, one half of the Protestants, persisting in the same error, contend for unity in doctrines, although with but little chance of obtaining it, as every one is looking for it in a different system. We need not be astonished at the inclination of most individuals who think and reflect, to make others bend to their own opinions : it is the inevitable result of our faculties. The re¬ sistance of any one to that which appears to us self-evident, shocks us ; it appears to us at first stupidity, then obstinacy and insincerity: be¬ sides, as the opinions with which our worldly interests are connected are the moving spring of our actions, when those of men about us differ from our own, we are alarmed; we ex¬ pect accordingly to suffer from them, and to see our dearest interests compromised or destroyed. The republican would destroy the monarchy to which we are heartily attached, and the roy¬ alist would destroy the republic. Opinions which naturally lead to actions that may essen¬ tially alter the subject upon which these opi-</page><page sequence="59">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 55 nions are exercised, must undoubtedly be con¬ sidered as dangerous. Religious opinions do not lead to the same results; a man's belief can never change that which has existed from all eternity. But evi¬ dent as this difference is, it may be said that no one has yet pointed it out. The world of souls is still more independent of us than the extent of the heavens, which we can measure, although we cannot act upon it. Whether an astronomer adopt the system of Copernicus, or that of Ptolemy, he cannot alter the real motion of the heavenly bodies; though a blind man should deny the existence of the sun, he cannot extin¬ guish its light; still less can our confined ideas, our feeble expressions, change the essence of the Almighty. There is undoubtedly something in the vari¬ ous religions besides the dogmas, on the reality of which our belief exercises no influence ; there is a moral instruction more or less pure or cor¬ rupt, which, guiding our actions in a virtuous or vicious path, may compromise our interests in the most serious manner; this instruction is capable of exciting the most serious con¬ troversies ; on this subject however there has never been any division among the sects : they have often calumniated each other, on the score</page><page sequence="60">56 PROGRESS OF of their moral conduct; but they have never attacked the principles of morals, because these principles could not be discussed or settled without the aid of reason. There may be also something in preaching a new doctrine which may endanger the credit, riches, and power of the priests attached to the ancient doctrine: these men may be alarmed for their temporal interests; but let them not therefore tell us that they are defending God, or aveng¬ ing the cause of God, when they are only thinking of themselves. The doctrines which have created so many controversies turn en¬ tirely on the mysteries of the various religions; they exercise no influence on the essence of things, they neither endanger God, nor can they offend him. In proportion ds these doctrines are inoffen¬ sive as regards Him, they are incomprehensible as regards ourselves. The fundamental ideas of the Divinity, even those on which the religions of all civilized people are agreed, such as his omnipresence, omnipotence, omniscience, so completely exceed the limits of our ideas, that we have never more than a confused and con¬ tradictory notion of them, which we are conti¬ nually falsifying by our language ; for example, when we place God in Heaven. That our thirst</page><page sequence="61">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 57, after knowledge should lead us to be incessantly scrutinizing this great mystery of the universe, is perfectly natural; but, from the moment we compare the extent of the subject with the nar¬ rowness of our faculties, we must feel convinced that every man must form a different opinion of it, in proportion to his capacity, and varying with its extent; and that, should he repeat the same words to express this mystery, still in his heart he would put a different construction on such words. The Christian revelation, when it taught men how they should act to render themselves wor¬ thy of God, abstained from explaining that which they could not understand, namely, the nature of God and his connection with man. Christians, however, have not contented them¬ selves with this silence ; from the first ages of Christianity, they have looked to the spiritual world for an explanation of them, and dogmas have been delivered founded on a more or less subtle interpretation of the Scriptures; the Roman Catholic church makes her excellence consist in the uniformity with which she has expounded these dogmas. Her experience during eighteen centuries ought, however, to have convinced men of the impossibility to make them think or believe alike on a subject so far.</page><page sequence="62">.58 PROGRESS OF above their understandings. She has only maintained the uniformity of her doctrines by casting out of her bosom, when she was weak or indulgent, all who dissented from the canon of the faith, and by punishing them with death when she was powerful or cruel. It is from the Catholic church that have sprung all the heresies, which may be counted by thousands; she has not therefore preserved her own children from those variations in the faith, with which she reproaches other churches; she has only abjured them by degrees, as they made use of their understandings to examine her dogmas. Jesus Christ spoke to men with a divine authority ; but men were curious to know who Jesus Christ himself was, and how it happened that his authority was confounded with that of the Divinity. Hundreds of hypotheses were laid down by ingenious men, who all relied on the Scriptures, which each interpreted his own way, all of whom were probably sincere, for they bore with courage persecutions and punishments for their opinions ; all called them¬ selves Catholics, all in truth were Catholics, until the period when the temporal authority, which had hitherto wavered between these con¬ flicting opinions, decided in favour of the one, and persecuted the other. But, after the divine</page><page sequence="63">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 59 nature of Jesus Christ had been proclaimed by the conquering party, still more abstract ques¬ tions were started by the Catholic doctors, on the union of the divine with the human nature, and on the union of two wills in the same being. Each doubt divided the church, each decision cast a portion of the faithful from her bosom. This continual birth of fresh heresies, which was nothing more than the successive exami¬ nation, by the Catholic divines, of all super¬ natural questions on which the mind could exercise its subtilty, continued up to the last century and until the birth of Jansenism. But the sects successively rejected by Catholicism having been at the same time proscribed from the civilized world by the temporal power, have almost all perished, with the exception of the reformation, which, in the sixteenth century, found civilized temporal powers to protect it, and Jansenism, which, although condemned by the church, and without temporal support, could not, from the change in our manners, be de¬ stroyed by fire and sword. Habit checks and enchains the most resolute minds. The reformers, after having raised a controversy on a particular dogma, flatly re¬ fused to submit to the authority of the church which condemned them, as all the sectaries had</page><page sequence="64">60 PROGRESS OF done, perhaps without exception, who had been born in the bosom of the Catholic church, and been successively expelled by her; but they were not less attached to uniformity of belief: they were equal admirers of all the previous judgments pronounced by the church, on those points which they themselves did not dispute; they repeated equally the anathemas pro¬ nounced by the Catholics against opinions for¬ merly discussed in the bosom of that church: and it was one of the fatal consequences of the prejudices in which he had been educated, and of which his mind had as yet only dissipated the smallest portion, that Calvin caused Servetus to be burnt. But the reformers had been obliged to appeal from the authority of the church to the right of examination, as all controversialists must do; and from this examination, to which all then- sectarians devoted themselves, and which lasted for three centuries, arose a second, and much more important reformation than they had ever hoped to effect. The original reformers wished that every man should see, and judge for him¬ self, but yet should think as they did: they assumed to themselves the right of watching over the purity of the faith, of excluding or punishing dissenters; of drawing up confessions</page><page sequence="65">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 61 of faith, and compelling all the members of their clergy to sign them; and of inserting anathemas in them against all who thought differently from themselves. The reformers, called upon to judge for themselves, took up in a modified form all those opinions which the successive condemnation of heresies had made a part of orthodox belief, and they disagreed on all of them. At that time there really existed as many modifications of opinion as there were in¬ dividuals. It has been often said that there could not be found on the largest tree two leaves entirely alike-: can we hope to find in the whole human race two minds perfectly identical? It is, however, with our whole soul that we form our faith: we employ at the same time our un¬ derstanding, our imagination, our sensibility, our memory ; there is not one of these faculties which does not modify the objects which it perceives in its own way. Toleration of dissenting opinions, an inevitable consequence of the right of inquiry, became tacitly established during the last century, in all the Protestant churches. In England, where the clergy formed a more powerful body, en¬ dowed with great political privileges, and whose organization remained nearly the same as that of the Catholics, the church showed more attach-</page><page sequence="66">•62 PROGRESS OF ment to her confession of faith, and compelled all dissenters to separate themselves, and to form as many little independent churches as there existed modifications in their belief. But the liberty guaranteed to the English by the laws permitting them to discuss their opinions publicly, occasioned new dissensions to arise out of each question even in the bosom of these minor churches; and, however multiplied the sects might be, they were few compared to the diversity of opinions. In the bosom also of the English church, which alone had a fixed liturgy, some of its members began to refuse subscrip¬ tion to the Thirty-Nine Articles; and others to strike out of the liturgy the Athanasian and Nicene Creeds, or such phrases in the litany as r were repugnant to their personal feelings. On the continent, the liberty of examination was exercised in the bosom of the reformed church without creating any schism in it. It seemed to be much sooner felt there that reli¬ gion did not consist in the solution of the enigma of the universe. The church of Geneva suppressed, as early as the year 1705, the prac¬ tice of compelling the members of her clergy to sign the same confession of faith. From the moment that anathemas ceased to be pro¬ nounced against certain opinions, their votaries</page><page sequence="67">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 63 no longer displayed such fury in the support of them; they were quietly banished from the domain of faith into that of philosophy; and, although every reflecting person modified them according to his own ideas, far from creating new sects, the three churches of the first re¬ formers, Luther, Zuinglius and Calvin, were tending rapidly to form but one church. In this state of things the French revolution broke out to astonish and shake all Christen¬ dom. The revolution, in a religious point of view, was quite unconnected with Protestant¬ ism. Directed against the priesthood, it broke out furiously where their yoke was most op¬ pressive; it persecuted the individuals, in the destruction of the abuse: it attacked religion it¬ self, and abjured all those doctrines which were most consoling to mankind. But, during its greatest violence, notwithstanding the assist¬ ance which the government and soldiers afforded to its maxims, it made no progress among Pro¬ testants. In Switzerland, in Holland, in Ger¬ many, public worship was never suspended, even during the presence of the French armies; the preachers lost none of their credit, and the number of infidels, which was always very small in this communion, was not increased. Meanwhile the attacks of the French terror-</page><page sequence="68">64 PROGRESS OF ists against the fundamental principles of all re¬ ligion scandalized the Protestants quite as much as the Catholics; they revived religious zeal and excited the reaction of which we still feel the effects. The doctrines which the revolu¬ tionists attacked, and which they separated en¬ tirely from moral instruction, were precisely the doctrines which were inculcated by the new preachers of Christianity; they elevated them above moral instruction, in order to distinguish themselves from the revolutionists, and they professed with redoubled zeal the doctrine of saving faith, and that in the purity of faith con¬ sists all Christianity. It became, however, difficult to decide what was the faith of the Protestant church: for every divine, and frequently every believer, had considered doctrinal questions in a particular point of view; controversy had ceased, but religious instruction and preaching had con¬ tinued to develope independent opinions. To exhibit the Protestant religion as a complete body of doctrine, would have required a survey of all the questions which had been the subject of controversy in the Romish church, from the time of her condemnation of the first heresy up to the very latest: it would have been ne¬ cessary to exhibit in intelligible terms, that</page><page sequence="69">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 65 would bear examination and discussion, all the mysteries which, for more than a century, had been allowed to remain in obscurity, and the application of which had never been required to strengthen the piety of the believer. The zeal of those who were anxious for this kind of reformation, or rather for making the reforma¬ tion to retrograde, seemed eager after sacri¬ fices : but as the Protestant church does not admit of practices designed for the mortification of the flesh, they mortified the spirit, and thought to render themselves more acceptable to God by adopting that faith which was most repugnant to their comprehension. At the same time they permitted themselves to be guided by the confessions of faith adopted by the first reformers; they resumed them in all their strength, and submitted themselves with eagerness to their authority: those who neither recognized that of Popes or of Councils, looked upon that of Calvin and his first disciples as conclusive. From the period that the writings of Voltaire attained their greatest vogue, new teachers among the Protestants started up, and conside¬ rably increased during the stormiest period of the revolution, who under the character of defend¬ ers of the faith required of their auditors the F</page><page sequence="70">6$ PROGRESS OF most absolute submission of their consciences and abnegation of their reason. Some of these allied themselves with theologians who were feorn Catholics, but who had tacitly withdrawn themselves from their church; these were the Martinists, who thought they had re-opened a mysterious communication with spirits of a superior order, and the Quietists, disciples of Feiielon and Madame Guyon, who almost wor¬ shipped the memory of the latter. Their num¬ bers had multiplied in Switzerland, before the peace, so as to form a very active and pretty nu¬ merous congregation. Others attached them¬ selves to the obscure reveries of the old Ger¬ man enthusiasts, such as Jacob Boehm and Swedenborg, and commented upon them as a second revelation. The subtle metaphysics which at the same period had taken possession of the German schools, contributed to spread this cloudy mysticism over all Protestant Ger¬ many. Finally, others endeavoured to bring- back the reformed church to the doctrines of Calvin; they laid great stress on his profession of faith on the union of the two natures in Jesus Christ, on the efficacy of his sacrifice, and upon grace. These opinions chiefly prevailed in England, and inspired the sect of the Method¬ ists with fresh ardour.</page><page sequence="71">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 67 The doctrines of the new apostles who en¬ deavoured to convert the Protestants, whom they denominated lukewarm, were not identi¬ cal ; but all had the same spirit, to believe more, and to examine less. When they came to ac¬ tual conflict, the English ones soon obtained an immense advantage over the rest, from the habit acquired in a free country of acting in concert, and of forming rich and skilfully or¬ ganized associations, to direct their efforts^ The Bible Society, although formed of Chris¬ tians of all denominations, soon fell under their influence, and afforded them powerful support. Other societies were formed for the purpose of sending missionaries into Protestant countries; subscriptions were raised with that profusion which is no where found but in England; preachers favourable to the new doctrines were liberally paid, and were charged to distribute alms abundantly to the poor who intrusted them with the care of their consciences; the books of the sect were gratuitously distributed amongst all who would accept them. In England, where the right of naming incumbents is a sale¬ able property, all the presentations of livings which were to be sold were bought up by the Methodists, and the prodigious influence which money exercised over public opinions was truly f2</page><page sequence="72">68 PROGRESS OF remarkable, even in cases where there is no reason to think that the converts had sold their consciences. Protestant missionaries therefore are now labouring in France and throughout Europe, along with Catholic missionaries. Their ob¬ jects are not the same, they have not a power¬ ful and organized church; they have no politi¬ cal projects, and have not the least idea of as¬ suming into their hands all the powers of a social body. The greater proportion of them are not even clergymen; they are men of the world, men of letters, and often women, who labour to diffuse their opinions with all the fer¬ vour of new converts. But these opinions are not on that account less exclusive; they arro¬ gate to themselves equally with the Jesuits the authority of prescribing to men what they should believe; they equally demand the sacri¬ fice of human reason to divine faith; but, as they have no authority, as they cannot pretend to have been in possession of general instruc¬ tion for ages past, and equally disavow all claims to inspiration; their pretensions are perhaps somewhat more offensive to their hearers. In truth, one is at a loss to account for the presumption of these prophets who have con-</page><page sequence="73">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 69 stituted themselves missionaries: many of them, on all other subjects, are modest and open to conviction : they would respect the science and philosophy of men, whose faith they would, in the height of their presumption, condemn. What, however, let it be asked, are their at¬ tainments? what their claims? what proofs have they given of their superior judgment? Doubt¬ less no human studies would sufficiently enable them to comprehend the Divinity, or the rela¬ tion which he bears to man; but farther, if they are Protestants, it is in the Holy Scriptures alone that they profess to look for the truth. Can they say that they comprehend better than others that volume which is appealed to by thousands of sects, and has been always made to adapt itself to the various constructions which individuals have put upon it? Have they studied it in its original tongues Are they acquainted with the history of its various read¬ ings, of its supposed interpolations, and of the different translations of it? Have they compared the different versions? Have they examined each heresy from its origin, the controversies which it has caused, and re-examined the ques¬ tions on which another church has thought diffe¬ rently from their own? They will not answer; but M'e will answer boldly for them, that they</page><page sequence="74">70 PROGRESS OF have done nothing of the kind; for those who have bestowed most time and attention on such studies have thereby only proved, sometimes much against their inclinations, that these im¬ portant questions must remain undecided. It is well known that a German baroness, who placed herself at the head of the most en¬ thusiastic of these evangelical sects, and who exercised a remarkable influence over men in power, even over sovereigns, thought herself gifted with supernatural powers; that she pre¬ tended to have had apparitions and revelations, and that upon the authority derived from these reveries of a diseased brain, she rested her claims to the obedience of her disciples. But Mad. de Krudner was probably sincere in this illusion: whoever cherishes such fancies is soon transported to an imaginary world, where they lose the faculty of distinguishing the visions of this description of fever, from those derived from the natural organs of vision. Making allowance for this first deception, of which she was herself the dupe, the conduct of Mad. de Krudner was much more simple, much more modest than that of many great ladies, who, without fancying themselves inspired, do not therefore preach less, who do not decide less promptly, who do not condemn less un-</page><page sequence="75">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 71 hesitatingly those opinions which it is not the province of man to scrutinize. In the midst of this fresh excitement on the subject of religion, the Protestant clergy, in general, have conducted themselves with much wisdom and moderation. They have avoided, as much as possible, entering into controversies, and have set the example of tolerance and mu¬ tual forbearance. The English clergy, it is true, are more attached than all the others to ortho¬ doxy, and confessions of faith; they cannot, however, avoid taking a part among the conflict¬ ing opinions; it is remarked, indeed, that the parochial clergy show a decided dislike to al¬ lowing their brethren in the ministry and neigh¬ bours, to preach in their churches, fearing lest their parishioners should be led astray from the pure doctrine which they have taught them; as though they could perceive, by any particular mark, that their own doctrine is purer than that of their brethren. At the same time, the heads of the clergy have looked with a jealous eye, when the impulse has been given to this newzeal in religion, by persons not in the church: they regarded it as an usurpation of their attri¬ butes, and the Archbishop of Canterbury has recently declared his opposition to the Bible</page><page sequence="76">72 PROGRESS OF Societies, seconded in this step by the warmest champions of the English church.* In the Protestant churches of Germany, the philosophical spirit of the great biblical critics appears in opposition to the enthusiasm of some new schools; but their controversy is also a proof of the liberty and of the division of opi¬ nions. The evangelical churches of the coun¬ tries on the Rhine resolved, by their act of union, section 3. to take the Holy Scriptures as the sole basis of theological instruction, thus doing away with all creeds; and this resolution was confirmed after fresh deliberation, in the month of November, 1825, by the third ge¬ neral synod of the Rheno-Bavarian Protestant church. In Switzerland, the clergy at first showed a degree of bitter zeal for orthodoxy; but, finding themselves soon surpassed by inno¬ vators who pretended to greater orthodoxy than themselves, and feeling piqued by con¬ troversies as void of argument as they were irritating, they showed a want of moderation and firmness, by stimulating the council of state of the Canton de Vaud to pass a decree on the 15th of January, 1824, against the evangelical Christians, who were there designated by the * Vide John Bull, Oct. 1st, 1825.

It was vigorously attacked, but has not resorted to de¬ fence, in order to avoid embittering disputes: it has treated all opinions with respect, when em¬ braced with sincerity; it has communicated to its pastors a sentiment of charity, humility and peace, which makes them avoid in the pulpit all controversy with the Roman Catholic church all damnatory expressions, all anathemas, all charges of heresy^ which might disturb the edi¬ fication of their hearers, whatever faith they might profess; it has also, by its ordinance of the 3d of May, 1817, forbidden its members from discussing in the pulpits of the Canton, questions which are still controverted, even by Protestants themselves; namely, those which relate to the twofold nature of Jesus Christ, to original sin, to grace and predestination, but without controuling, in any manner, their opi¬ nions, or their right to discuss them in their wri¬ tings.')- * Vide Archives du Christianisme, April and May, 1824. t Precis desDebats tkeologiquesde Geneve, par J.J. Cheneviere, 1824, p. 22.</page><page sequence="78">74 PROGRESS OF At the same time that the company of pas¬ tors of Geneva united thus in its practice the greatest tolerance with a charitable attention to the stifling of religious controversies, and pre¬ venting them from disturbing the edification of the faithful; many of its members published, with, at least, the implied consent of their body, writings that may be regarded as the real pro¬ fession of faith of the reformed church, the only one consistent with the right of examination, which is the essence of Protestantism, and with the independence of individual belief, which is its necessary consequence. Amongst these writings, all of which well de¬ serve the serious attention of religious philoso¬ phers,* we shall confine ourselves to the most recent, by a young clergyman, who is in this instance the organ of the theological school of Geneva as to its present course of instruction. M. Chastel begins by establishing: " that the doctrines of Christianity may be reduced to two classes. The first are recognized as an¬ terior to the interpretation of the Gospel, with¬ out which Christianity could not exist; to this * Coup d'QZil sur les Confessions de Foi, par M. Heyer, pasteur.

Geneve, 1823.</page><page sequence="79">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 75 class belong the belief in the existence of God, the divine mission of Jesus Christ, and the inspiration of the Holy Scriptures; these we term primitive. The others are derived from a fixed interpretation of the Gospel, after it has been recognized as a rule of faith; these we will term doctrines of interpretation. " On the primitive doctrines, all Christians are agreed; for they would cease to call them¬ selves Christians, if they disowned God, Jesus Christ, or the Holy Scriptures. On the doc¬ trines of interpretation, the Catholics are equally agreed, because they attribute infallibility to their church, and the right of settling the true meaning of the Scriptures. But the reformers, when they separated themselves from the Ro¬ mish church, adopted the following principles : that the word of God is the only rule of our faith; that as there is no infallible judge on earth, no one has the right of imposing a fixed interpre¬ tation of the Scriptures; but that every Chris¬ tian is at liberty to adopt that which appears to him the best. By \ irtue of these principles, each person interpreting the Scriptures in his own way, different creeds will arise; they will agree on the primitive doctrines, but will differ on those derived from interpretation."* * Dc I L'sagc dcs Confcsiiom dc Foi, p 2.</page><page sequence="80">76 PROGRESS OF The author passes from these principles to the history of confessions of faith. He shows that they were not regarded as obligatory till the third century of the Christian a^ra; that, far from establishing a unity of faith, they have raised discussions and divisions on the most intricate questions; that they have multiplied heresies; in fine that they were as much opposed to Christian charity as to the right of free in¬ quiry, which is the basis of the reformed religion. He goes farther, he would banish uniformity of instruction in seminaries, in order that he who proposes to instruct others, may be acquainted with all creeds, and be better able to select the best.* " A Christian," he says, " well con¬ vinced of his proneness to error, will never compel others to adopt his principles, especially if he believe that salvation depends on his belief; it seems to me, that he would be afraid of their eternal damnation; he would have some repugnance to driving people from his commu¬ nion, who, from his own showing, think perhaps more rationally than himself, people whom Jesus, perhaps, prefers to himself. He will al¬ ways respect the sentiments of his brethren : he will never treat them as heretics, he will * De I'Usage des Confessions de Foi, p. 52.</page><page sequence="81">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 7.7 never hate them, he will never reject them on account of their belief."* No appeal has yet been made to the religious world in a spirit of greater charity and recipro¬ cal tolerance. The clergy of Geneva address themselves to all men who believe in God. "We only refuse," say they, " to recognize as Chris¬ tians those who themselves refuse to take that title. If you acknowledge Christ and the Holy Scriptures, we recognize you as Christians and as brethren; we do not ask you on that account to renounce any of your dogmas, any of your doctrines, but only not to impose them on us." The excitement that we have noticed as ex¬ isting among different parties in the protes¬ tant church, and the zeal for proselytism which animates the new teachers, certainly do not agree with these pacific invitations. Mean¬ while, by an opposite route, these missionaries will arrive at the same point. Many errors, many fantastical doctrines are taught us with a confi¬ dence which seems to say, that those who wish to dictate to us in matters of faith fancy them¬ selves secretly inspired of God; but, as all have a right to be heard, as contradictions arise, and as conviction must be effected by arguments, * De I'Usage &lt;les Confessions de Foi, p. 106.</page><page sequence="82">78 PROGRESS OF not by punishments, discussion extends itself universally; historical criticism is more studied, and gains in depth and extent; sects split still further; individual opinions become still more independent, and matters will end by acknow¬ ledging the sincerity of our adversaries, and the impossibility of proving to men what is above their comprehension. In the same work from which we quote, the Church of Geneva holds out even to the Ca¬ tholics a friendly hand. It concludes thus : " All the reformed, whatever may be their in¬ terpretation of the Holy Scriptures, ought to consider themselves as members of one Chris¬ tian church; to banish from amongst them ex¬ communications, schisms, and disputes; and to regard and cherish one another as brethren in Christ. As for the Catholics, if we reject them from our communion, it is not on account of their doctrines, or their rites, but on account of the in¬ tolerant spirit professed by their church, and of their submission to human authority; it is because they serve two masters, while we can serve but one. Besides, we profess with regard to them the most perfect tolerance, the most sincere charity, the most ardent desire to see ourselves one day united with them, so that there may</page><page sequence="83">RELIGIOUS OPINIONS. 79 no longer exist, to use the language of the Sa¬ viour, ' but onefold and one shepherd.' " * Thus it is no longer the reproach of heresy or idolatry which one division of Christians re¬ peats against the other: it is not even an accu¬ sation of error; for the Protestant church admits that she herself may be mistaken; she claims only that liberty of thought which the Catholic church renounces. An abyss formerly sepa¬ rated the two communions, which, at the pre¬ sent day, is dwindled to a boundary mark; and we think we can augur from this review of re¬ ligious opinions in the two divisions of the church, that even this mark will not long be looked upon as dividing the inheritance of hos¬ tile brethren. * De l'Usage des Confessions de Foi, p. 106.
