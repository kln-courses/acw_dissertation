<plain_text><page sequence="1">PALÉORIENT Vol. 5 1979 OBSERVATIONS ON THE PREHISTORY OF THE BALIKH VALLEY, SYRIA, DURING THE 7th TO 4th MILLENNIA B.C. L. COPELAND ABSTRACT. - The interest for prehistory of the Balikh Valley, north-central Syria, lies in its position, almost mid-way between the Levant and Mesopotamia. Interesting links, both to the east and the west, can be deduced from flint, obsidian and ceramic material collected from early tells during a survey in 1978. Two of these seem to refer to an early pottery Neolithic dating to the end of the 7th Mil. (hence, pre- Amuq A) and known in the Euphrates and Balikh Valleys from Bouqras and Aswad. The Halaf and Ubaid sites can be dated, based on the stratified pottery sequence at Tell Aqab(#), to various phases of the Halaf and Ubaid cultures. RÉSUMÉ. - La vallée du Balikh, située au centre nord de la Syrie, presque à mi-chemin entre le Levant et la Mésopotamie, présente un grand intérêt pour la préhistoire de cette région. Des relations économiques, tant avec l'ouest qu'avec l'est, peuvent être déduites de l'étude du matériel lithique (silex et obsidienne) et de la céramique provenant de ramassages de surface effectués en 1978 sur des tells anciens. Deux d'entre eux peuvent, semble-t-il, être attribués à un Néolithique ancien avec céramique, vers la fin du 7 e mil. (soit pré-Amouq A), représenté dans les vallées de l'Euphrate et du Balikh sur les sites de Bouqras et d'Aswad. Les sites de l'horizon de Halaf et d'Obeid peuvent être datés d'après la séquence céramique de Tell Aqab(*) et attribués aux différentes phases des cultures de Halaf et d'Obeid. The 1 978 season of the Centre National de le Recher- che Scientifique team R.C.P. 438, led by P. Sanlaville, was spent surveying the Quaternary deposits in the region of the confluence of the Balikh and Euphrates rivers at Raqqa (1). In the course of examining the river terraces of the lower and middle Balikh, post-Palaeoli- thic material was sometimes encountered, in the form of sherds, flint and obsidian artifacts, fragments of stone tools, etc., on the surface of tells. These were located either on the lowest terrace or on the floodplain itself. Other early tells were found on a short survey of Holocene sites, which we carried out towards the end of the season. An account of this survey, and a brief description of the prehistoric finds, has been sent for publication in the Annales Archéologiques Arabes de Syrie (2). In this paper, discussion will be confined to a num- ber of sites of the 7th - 4th Mil. B.C. which we found on the survey, and an expanded description of the material. The latter, when considered together with se- veral recently published Carbon 14 determinations, as well as with the results of new excavations in the region, combine to give insights into the cultural chro- nology of this interesting area, placed as it is nearly half- way between Mesopotamia and the Levant. THE AREA OF THE 1978 SURVEY The River Balikh is one of the three perennial tribu- taries of the Syrian Euphrates (Fig. 1), and, like the Séjour and the Khabour, its waters originate in the high rainfall zone of the Taurus. Its valley properly begins in the northern Jezirah near Urfa (as the Nahr Jullab), but the river is considered to rise in the karstic spring, Ain el-Arous, near the Syro-Turkish frontier (3). This and other sources, fed by subterranean streams draining a vast piedmont north of Urfa, give the Balikh a small but regular flow of 3-5 cubic metres per second at issue and for most of its c. 100 km length, despite the fact that its course lies between the isohyets of 300 mm (at Tell Abiad) and 200 mm (at Raqqa), and that about mid-way between these points, the line marking the limit of reliable dry farming crosses the valley transversally (4). At first, the Balikh meanders southwards across the rolling Jezirah plains; it then flows through a 3-5 km - wide floodplain bordered by gravel and silt terraces which were deposited successively during Upper Pleis- tocene glacial periods (5). Eroded remnants of the lowest (last glacial) terrace jut out into the floodplain as penin- * DAVIDSON 1977. (1) The team consisted of J. Besançon and P. Sanlaville, geomor- phologists, and F.

Thus, today the Lower Balikh is in the arid zone where agriculture must be carried on with the help of irrigation; the upper part of its course is in the borderline area where rain-dependant crops could easily fail two out of every ten years (WALLEN, ibid.). Presuma- bly, before the destruction of the natural vegetation cover by centuries of primitive dry-farming, the situation was somewhat different.

The latter is essential in a region where no rain falls between March and October, and it has permitted the permanent human occupation of the valley in recent times ; numerous ancient mounds occur down its length. The valley forms a natural north-south commu- nications passage, linking up (at its confluence with the Euphrates) with the east-west passage between the Le- vant and Mesopotamia. Until recently there were extensive areas of marsh in the lower reaches of the Balikh; these have now been drained and the water diverted into irrigation canals, but a vivid account of conditions in the valley only 40 years ago is given by Mallowan (6), who mentions the abundance of wild fowl and other animals in these marshes - survivors of what must have been a rich source of game in prehistoric times (7). Our survey located eight prehistoric tells, which, when added to the eight already known, form a total of 16 so far for the lower-central sector. Many more no doubt still await discovery. PREVIOUS WORK IN THE BALIKH VALLEY Prehistoric material was first reported on Balikh tells by W. Albright, who visited tells Zaidan and es-Se- maan; he likened the painted pottery found to that of Tell al-'Ubaid, Eridu and 'Tell Khazneh", near Kir- kuk(8). Some sherds, as well as flint and obsidian artifacts, were illustrated (9). Thirteen years later, Mallowan spent a season in the valley. Among other excavations, he sounded two pre- historic tells - Mefesh and Aswad, and reported on material from Hammam and Shuwaikh(lO). On Aswad he found Halaf sherds, together with a group having designs described as 'Samarran cognates'. These occur- red around a structure of narrow mud-brick rectangular rooms. He also noted the presence of tanged arrow- heads, presumed to be of an earlier period, and similar pieces were picked up on Tell Hammam (11). On Me- fesh he found a 'hybrid Ubaid pottery' style with traces of another structure, this time with larger rooms, and roofed (just as are pre-cement block village houses of today) with poplar poles covered by reeds and mud. Similar pottery is mentioned from T. Shuwaikh, near Mefesh (location not specified). In their article on Harran, Lloyd and Brice (12) refer briefly to Balikh prehistory, mentioning surface finds of Halaf and Northern Ubaid sherds north of Tell Abiad, on Tell Asagi Yarimça, on the old road to Edessa, 4 km from Harran. More recently J. Cauvin surveyed the Jezirah and Balikh areas in 1969, reporting Halaf sherds on T. Assouad (Mallowan's Aswad) and on two new sites, Khirbet el-Bassal and Tell Rijliye ; plain burnished pot- tery also occurred on the first-named. He also visited Tells Zaidan and Mefesh, noting Ubaid sherds (13). The following year he excavated a step-trench from top to base of the 10 m height of Tell Assouad/ Aswad, finding a somewhat surprising sequence of Ceramic Neolithic levels at the base (VIII-VII) without architecture, over- lain by Aceramic Neolithic levels with buildings (VI -I); a few Halaf sherds occurred at the surface (14). No connection could be made to Mallowan's trenches, which seemed to have been obliterated. Two C. 14 dates were obtained from the lower (cera- mic) levels, which averaged at 6585 B.C. The pottery consisted of plain coarse wares with black core, some of which were red burnished, and some white slipped, with flat bases, lug or knob handles and simple bowl shapes. Of some 700 sherds, not one was incised, im- pressed or pattern-burnished; one was painted in a simple linear pattern in red. The flint of both phases was the same, consisting of tanged arrowheads of Byblos Point type, burins, end- scrapers and sickle-blades (15). These assemblages were interpreted as representing an early Neolithic, the flint deriving from a PPNB tradition such as that seen in (6) MALLOWAN 1938. (7) The same agroclimatic studies indicate that open forests once occupied the semi-arid areas of the Near East which supported the appropriate range of animals, mainly cervids, other bovids and equids. (8) Not identified. Several sites of this name are listed in the Atlas of Archaeological sites in Iraq. 1970 in the Kirkuk Muhafizat, but none as prehistoric.

Others must surely have visited the more accessible of the tells to be discussed below, but so far as we are aware, nothing has so far been reported (17). SITES OF THE 7th TO THE 6tji MILLENNIA B.C. LOCATED IN 1978 Two sites, Tulul Breilat I and II and Tell Mafraq Slouq, are referrable on present evidence (see below) to the 7th Mil., and one, Tell Mounbateh, had a sequence starting early in the 6th Mil. B.C. The two former are found, not far apart, on the east bank of the Balikh (3 and 5 on Fig. 1). Tulul Breilat (or, more correctly, Bughaylat) consists of five or more low eminences bordering the floodplain; on two of these (I and II) we found tanged arrowheads and obsidian bla- delets, and in addition Site I produced flint burins and end-scrapers (Fig. 2), as well as fragments of stone and gypsum-plaster vessels, and plain handmade sherds (Fig. 4). Tell Mafraq Slouq is an inconspicuous low mound some distance from the Balikh, located near a point where the large tributary, the Wadi Hemar, enters the floodplain. Similar material was found here, al- though sherds were fewer and flint more abundant (Figs. 3 and 5). On both these sites, there was evidence of similar debitage methods of blade-working, for instance the "cores for side-blow blade-flakes" (Fig. 2:14 and 1 6 in obsidian, and 17 and 18, in flint), and the 'chanfrein technique' (Fig. 2 : 13 and Fig. 3 : 16) (18). Both sites had the same Byblos Point tanged arrowhead types; these are made on blades, with the central ridge left largely intact, the retouch coming mainly at the tang; one or two showed areas of pressure-flaking (Fig. 2 : 2 and 1 5 ; Fig. 3 : 3 and 4). The burins were usually small and either made on blades or broken tools; most were of single-blow type, that is, the burin spall struck off a snap or plain surface. A well-made series of end-scra- pers occurred at Mafraq Slouq (Fig. 3 : 9-13), as well as a few simple blades with sickle-sheen (no. 15). Fig. 3 : 17 and 18 show the range of sizes of obsidian blades and bladelets, these two being of grey and green obsi- dian respectively. The pottery was also similar at both sites, and con- sisted of coarse, vegetable and grit-tempered ware, often with black core, smoothed or red burnished outside (the latter more rare). All the sherds were light-coloured, and the shapes were mainly hole-mouth bowls, straight- sided bowls, low plates, or more rarely, jars ; bases were flat, and some rim-sherds with lug-handles were found at Breilat (Fig. 4:11 and 14). The gypsum-plaster ves- sels were either white or a dirty grey colour, as at Assouad(19) and one of these had the impression of a reed mat (as had some Bouqras plaster sherds), on the base. Other plaster fragments may be wall or floor- coverings, one having a smooth surface on one face. (16) CAUVIN 1972 and 1978. (17) Professor Van Loon passed by Tulul Breilat in 1977, noting Neolithic material (p.c. letter 1979). (18) The chanfrein technique, present in, for example, the Neolithic of Jericho (CROWFOOT-PAYNE 1937) is a method of truncating a blade which leaves a bevel or chamfered surface on the break. Side- blow blade-flakes are fully discussed below. (19) The grey colour may represent the inclusion of ashes; I observed modern inhabitants of Bouqras in 1978 making gypsum plaster on the shoulder of the main Aleppo - Deir-ez-Zor road by burning dung and brushwood on top of a pile of gypsum rocks in a stiff breeze. The article of GOURDIN and KINGERY (1975) describes the process and chemistry.

The Cauvins likened the Assouad arrowheads to the Levant Byblos Points (20); they can also be said to resemble the blade arrowheads of the Aceramic Neo- lithic at Abu Hureyra(21). Just as at Assouad, no trace of incised or impressed wares was found at our sites, and this factor as well as the scarcity of burnished pieces, their thickness, and the prevailing light colour, sets these assemblages somewhat apart from those with the Dark-faced Burnished Wares of the Levant (22). References to analogous material are included with the 'Description of Drawn Pieces', below. Turning to the 6th Mil., Tell Mounbateh is the ear- liest of the six painted pottery sites. It is an extensive but low tell (again, one of a group of low eminences bordering the floodplain) beside a spring which forms a pool, giving rise to areas of greensward and thick stands of reeds. This pleasant spot was evidently the site of a Halaf community of some duration. Sherds painted in red, reddish-brown or black on a cream or buff ground had typical Halaflan designs and motifs, such as bucrania and mouflon heads, dotted circles, etc. (Fig. 6 à 9). Many had shapes known from other Halaflan sites to the east, such as carinated, squat body and short, everted neck jars (Fig. 6 : 3) or deep plates (7, 1), straight-sided bowls and even bow-rim jars (Fig. 7 : 6), a more western form. Examples of designs and shapes typical of Early Halaf levels at Tell Aqab (23) are present, such as the jars with tall, straight collars shown in Fig. 9:2,4 and 7 ; these are painted in horizontal bands and oblique lines, resulting in a pattern of rectangles in reserve. Other sherds are similar to what would be present in Middle, Late and Transitional Halaf levels at Aqab, according to T. Davidson (24). One possibly 'true' Samarran and several 'Samarran cognates' were present (Fig. 8 : 5 ; Fig. 8 respectively). Tell Mounbateh also produced several plaster vessel fragments, and plain undecorated pots (Fig. 4:2,7 and 12) but since there were no arrowheads we do not claim a Neolithic occupation. Stone bowl fragments (alabaster, marble and perhaps schist) were also found. The flint tools consisted of end-scrapers and rough burins, with a surprising lack of sickle-blades (given their frequency in other painted pottery sites), and there were large numbers of unretouched or 'utilised' obsidian blades and bladelets, as well as cores and much knap- ping-waste. Human bone material, some of it charred, appeared to be eroding out of burials close to the surface. Halaflan sherds were found on several other sites, but these seem to refer to a Late Halaf or Transitional (to Ubaid) context, and these will be described below. SITES OF THE 5th TO THE 4th MIL. B.C. LOCA- TED IN 1978 On four of these, Tells Helu, es-Sawwan, Subhi Abiad and Chahine there were traces of Halaf occupa- tions, but on the fifth, Tell Zaidan, the Halaf period is more certainly attested (it is not a new site, but is included here since its material has not, so far, been published in any detail). The sample was fairly small at Tells Helu and Subhi Abiad, so the following comments are based largely on finds from Chahine, Sawwan and Zaidan. (20) CAUVIN 1972. (21) MOORE et alii 1975.

The Lake Van green, the type with treacle-brown colour at the edges, and both cloudy and clear grey obsidians are present. As mentioned in note 39, according to Ren- frew (25), all these types could have come from the Eastern Anatolian sources. In many respects the flint industry resembles that of the earlier sites (for example the burin types (Fig. 12:1- 3)); the debitage methods are also similar. However, not a single arrowhead or fragment of one was found on any of the five tells. The sickle-blades were also marked- ly more numerous, consisting of either bi-truncated (or, more rarely, backed and truncated) to trapeze forms (Fig. 12 : 5-8, 11-15, 18). Some pieces without sheen but identical typology are also probably sickle-blade ele- ments (Fig. 12:4, 9-10, 16). To truncate them, both the chanfrein technique and the "side-blow method" were used, as well as nibbling inverse retouch (Fig. 12:9 and 14). None of them were denticulated. As might be expected from its name, Tell es-Sawwan was covered with fresh flint, mainly blades and cores (Fig. 12 : 17). The pottery is illustrated in Figs. 10, 1 1 , 1 3 et 14 ; the bulk appears to be of Late Halaf and Transitional type and where one or other can be distinguished, it is so noted in the "Descriptions"; the rest, especially at Tell es-Sawwan could be regarded as more clearly Ubaid in style. The painted sherds from Tell Chahine (a near neigh- bour of Mallowan's Tell Mefesh) are dominated by S- curved bowl-rims similar to those of Mefesh (Fig. 10:4- 6, no. 4 being virtually the same shape and design as Mallowan's no. 8, Fig. 7 (26)). Other bowls with inver- ted rims have a more Ubaid-like aspect (Fig. 11 : 1-3) while there is a range of large, coarse vessels which seem identical to the Mefesh grain jar (27) kept at the London Institute of Archaeology; examples are on Fig. 14, 7 and possibly 4, and on Fig. 11 : 1 1 . It is a question whether the Transitional is regarded as a Final Ha- laf (28) or an early Northern Ubaid (Mallowan), and this is discussed below; meanwhile the sites concerned have been marked as "Ubaid" on Map 2, Fig. 1. The sherds from Tell es-Sawwan and some from Zaidan have a somewhat later appearance, and simple motifs in plain bands, swags, festoons, etc. are common (Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 : 5). DISCUSSION Conventionally, the sites first discussed, with arrow- heads and no or rare painted pottery would be designa- ted "Neolithic", while those without arrowheads and with much painted pottery would be "Chalcolithic" (29). In spite of a common awareness of how unsatisfactory these terms are, I, too, use them here purely as a convenience.

Bouqras ; seven dates, base to top : from 6400 - 5900 B.C. Abu Hureyra, from levels late in the Aceramic se- quence : 6240 B.C. Mureybet, top of IVb (Aceramic) : latest date - 6900 B.C. The Syrian cultures concerned are thought by most workers to represent variants of the Pre-Pottery Neoli- thic В of the Levant, a tradition deriving from an earlier stage such as that seen in Mureybet IV a (31); being the most easterly site yet known, Bouqras with its eastern and western traits may be at the limit of this distribu- tion. These sites have many common features, for example the extensive use of lime or gypsum plaster for covering walls and floors of rectangular, mud structu- res ; if there are differences, these do not always depend on the easterly or westerly location of the site. An instance of this is the presence of posthole doors or crawlways at Bouqras, Umm Dabbaghiya and Abu Hureyra, but not seen at Mureybet. The flint industry is characterised by tanged arrowheads of Byblos Point or Amouq Point type, and often by use of "naviform" (bi- polar) blade-cores. These sites are either aceramic (Abu Hureyra and Mureybet) with traces of a ceramic and plaster vessel industry (on the surface in the case of Mureybet, in pits at Abu Hureyra) or else there is a fluctuating or intermittent use of ceramics and plaster vessels (Assouad and Bouqras). Illustrations in these works show that the sherds and flint from Breilat and Mafraq Slouq are of equivalent type and stage of development. In the case of the pot- tery, it is equally sparse and is especially similar to some of the Bouqras wares which I was privileged to examine at the site in 1978 during the Groningen excavation- season. However, the Bouqras sequence (not all houses in a level, nor all levels, had ceramics (23)), and the context of the few sherds at Abu Hureyra and Mureybet (over Aceramic levels with similar flint industry) show that both are associated with tanged arrowheads. For the moment, therefore, we cannot say whether the Byblos points at Breilat and Mafraq Slouq belong with an Aceramic, Ceramic, or "Intermittent Ceramic" phase. In any case, according to the C. 14 dates, the Balikh and Euphrates Neolithic sites which we are discussing date to the latter part of the 7th Mil., and their "Intermittent" Pottery therefore preceeds that of Amuq A. (It will be recalled that Amuq A-related material has dates in the range of from 5970 (at Ramad III), 5950 (at Labwe II A), to the later " Altmonochrome ' of Tell Halaf, at 5620 B.C.). As Moore has noted (34) the Euphrates 7th Mil. pottery forms the earliest evidence for ceramics in Syria, except for the even earlier occurrence in Murey- bet III (35). Both Cauvin and Moore (36) have commented that the wares of Assouad and Abu Hureyra bore some resemblance to the Levant Dark Faced Burnished Ware (DFBW). The excavators of Bouqras consider its pottery to have resemblances to that of Umm Dabaghiya(37). Now that dates are available, it is seen that the Euphra- tes pottery preceeded Amuq A at least, and perhaps Umm Dabaghiya as well, and that the different traits were inherited by the succeeding early 6th Mil. cultures. It is worth stressing here that our early pottery is not similar to the DFBW of the Amuq and Levant as defined by Braidwood and Braidwood (38), which is usually thin (i.e. half a centimeter thick), fine, well fired and without coarse temper as well as being often dark (black or chocolate), buff or red; this is seen the length of the Turkish, Syrian and Lebanese Levant at sites like Sakce Gözü, Ras Shamra, Sukas, Labwe, Byblos (39).

In a recent review, Contenson has gone further, suggesting that the Bouqras pottery is related not only to that of Umm Dabbaghiya but also to that of Jařmo, Tepe Guran and Temerkhan (CONTENSON 1977 : 35, col. 2), forming a Mesopota- mian province distinct from that of Syro-Cilicia. However that may be, pottery seems to have begun earlier here than in the Levant. (38) BRAIDWOOD and BRAIDWOOD 1960. (39) This does not contradict a recent comment by J. MEL- LAART, in MATTHERS et al. 1978 : 124, footnote 10, that the "monochrome burnished wares that appear in the top layers of Abu Hureyra, El-Kowm and Bouqras are the equivalent of the dark-faced burnished wares of Amuq A, Ras Shamra VB and Tell Sukas" so long as it is kept in mind that "equivalent" does not imply "similar". It may be that the unexcavated layers presumed to exist below the water table at Judaidah contain wares which are more like those of the Euphrates sites, and would be closer to them in date. 266</page><page sequence="17">OBSERVATIONS OF THE PREHISTORY OF THE BALIKH VALLEY Nor is this early ware the same as the Syrian Jezirah "Grey and Black Burnished Ware" or the Altmono- chrome, which are usually c. 2 cm. thick, coarse, under- fired, with much vegetable and mineral temper, usually of buff to brown colour; this is (according to C. 14 dates) of later date, contemporary with Amuq B. How- ever, at least on the Balikh sites, the early pottery is more like the succeeding Jezirah wares than it is like the Levant types. Moreover, no incised or impressed sherd of Amuq A type was found, either at our sites, or at those already known, neither was there any trace of the "ogee" and other characteristic Umm Dabaghiyah pot- tery forms. Taking all this into account, I am going to assume that the pottery and plaster vessels at Breilat and Mafraq Slouq refer to the same phase as seen at Bou- qras and Assouad, i.e. the last half of the 7th Mil., or around 6500 - 6000 B.C. The flint industry would tend only to confirm this idea. The arrowheads at the new sites are entirely com- parable to those of Assouad and other Euphrates sites. It would seem that the majority of specimens in this part of Syria have narrower tangs, less dorsal retouch and generally smaller dimensions than the Levantine Byblos Points - but comparable specimens also occur, especially at Bouqras. Amouq Points (which have no shoulder between tang and body) are absent so far from Assouad, are present at Bouqras and appear at Abu Hureyra towards the end of the sequence (40). The other lithic types (simple burins, end-scrapers, sickle- blade elements) are closely comparable at all the sites under discussion; all have many unretouched obsidian blades and bladelets, mostly from Eastern Anatolian sources, and some of these may also have been used as sickle-blades. Obsidian side-blow blade-flakes and the "cores" for same These minute artifacts (a specimen kindly shown to me by P. Mortensen measured 18mm wide, 6mm long and 2mm thick) were first reported by L. Braidwood from the ceramic levels or the 6th Mil. site of Jarmo, in the Zagros foothills (4 1 ). They were not noted at Shim- shara (42) and apparently do not occur at Zagros Sites to the south, e.g. at Tepe Guran(43). More recently, specimens were noted at Umm Dabaghiya and on the surface of tells in the Sinjar region, by D. Kirkbride (44) and others. This alerted the excavators of Thalathat II to conduct careful small-mesh sieving when they recom- menced work in 1978, with gratifying results: 50 or more were obtained from the basal levels XVI and XV (45); three of these were evidently "cores for side- blow blade-flakes" (their Fig. 3, no. 3), measuring 14, 17 and 18 mm wide, corresponding to the usual length of side-blow blade-flakes (the Umm Dabaghiya specimens drawn by Mortensen measured 15 mm and 24mm in length (46)). Until the Bouqras flint is published, we will not know if any pieces occurred there, but specimens identical to the "cores for side-blow blade-flakes" of Thalathat were found at Breilat (the two drawn on Fig. 2:14 and 16 measure 20mm and 22mm respectively). This unexpected result was due to an attempt to recover as much obsidian debitage as possible from Breilat; 1 believe that further search (at ground level) would produce the true, small thin sections as defined by L. Braidwood. The latter author regards these as, technically, the products of a special blade- working method, and as thin sections of Blades, struck off on the thickness, from either dorsal or ventral surface (47). P. Mortensen notes (48) that detachment occurs after another piece has been struck off higher up the blade, so that the thin section has a bulb of percussion on one surface and a negative impression on the other. In contrast, the "cores" ("parent blade segment" might be a better term) have a negative scar on both break surfaces as our Fig. 2 shows ; a side-blow flake could have been struck from either. For the moment we do not know whether the flake itself or the "core" was the desired result of the method - or whether both are waste-products of, for example, sickle-blade manufacture. I am grateful to Dr. M. New- comer for drawing my attention to a technique similar to that which must have produced the "cores" ; it is used to this day by the gun-flint makers of Brandon in Norfolk (49), in order to obtain a blade section of a desired length. To obtain two lengths from the same (40) CAUVIN 1972 ; AKKERMANS et al. in press; MOORE et al. 1975. (41) BRAIDWOOD 1952; BRAIDWOOD and HOWE 1960 : 45; HOLE in the forthcoming Jarmo publication.

A different view is held by P. Mortensen, who has noticed that the true thin sections often have secondary retouch, indicating that they were produced as artifacts for their own sake (50), and in correspondance with L. Braidwood, it seems she is of the same opinion (51). In any case, since virtually all known specimens are of obsidian, some connection with the obsidian trade from Eastern Anatolia seems likely; it is perhaps significant that the "cores" seem to have a distribution further west : two were found last year at Tell Bahouerte, north of Aleppo near the Tur- kish frontier (52). As would be expected, they are of obsidian, treacle-brown at the edges (53). At Tulul Brelat, a few cases were noticed where the method had been used on flint blades, resulting in blade segments somewhat larger than the ones in obsidian (e.g. Fig. 2:17 and 18). As a blade-truncation method, this seems fairly prevalent in the Near East; at Byblos, Cauvin remarked on the " cassure volontaire ' or " cas- sure à stigmate ' (54). The same technique was detected by M.-C. Cauvin at Assouad(55), and I have recently noticed it on flint from the sounding at Tell Arjoune near Nebi Mend (56). Arjoune and the Balikh sites have in common both the treacle-brown-edged obsidian type (which Renfrew (ibid) attributes to the Eastern Anato- lian sources) and the greenish Lake Van type. To sum up the evidence for the Neolithic period in the Balikh, there was a pre-Amuq A, PPNB-related culture complex occupying the Middle Euphrates and Balikh valleys at the end of the 7th Mil., continuing (in the case of Bouqras) to 5900 B.C. Eastern traits are detectable at Bouqras (57). So far, we lack evidence for the next, Amuq A- related, cultures of the early 6th Mil. in this region - in fact across a vast area from that of the new sites discovered north of Aleppo (58) up to the Syro/ Iraqi frontier, east of which 6th Mil. sites do occur in the Sinjar (59), unless the traces of arrowheads at Tell Fak- hariyah, near Tell Halaf (mentioned in Note 51) repre- sent such a phase. An extension of the aridity of the hiatus palestinien , which some think occurred at about the same time, could explain this (60). However, the area has not been extensively surveyed, and against the idea of abandonment is the presence, in a marginal area, of Umm Dabaghiya at just this period. Alternatively, since the latter site is as yet undated, it could be broadly contemporary with the upper levels at Bouqras, which, as we have seen, continued till 5900 B.C. ; it will be recalled that both sites were eventually abandoned, al- though occupation of similar sites in the more moist Sinjar region (Yarim Tepe I, Sotto, etc.) may have continued without too much interruption (6 1 ). (50) P.c. 1979. (51) P.c. 1979. L. BRAIDWOOD tells me that in recent replication experiments, side-blow blade-flakes were struck off in sequence without difficulty, much as she suggested in her 1952 article, Fig. 1. The results seem to me to resemble somewhat the "cores". Morever, efforts at replication by other workers (p.c. J. RODDENBERG and also M. NEWCOMER) have led to different conclusions; for example, I have seen the latter strike off a typical thin section from a discoid core. It seems that we have not yet exhausted discussion of these enigmatic small obsidian artifacts ! (52) P.c. H. THOMAS, who is studying the flint of the second season of the survey of MATTHERS et al. (53) I am most grateful to Professor RENFREW for looking at some obsidian samples from T. Mafraq Slouq. In a preliminary visual attribution he suggests that obsidian from Eastern Anatolian sources (4 С for the green, 1 G for the grey) was reaching the site; the brown- edged sample could also be from the 1 G source (p.c., letter, dated May 1979). The latter type of obsidian is first mentionned by RENFREW in HOLE 1977 : Appendix II : 293, and provisionally assigned by him to the 1 G source in Armenia or vicinity. It is interesting to note that, to quote RENFREW (ibid : 290) "group 1 G obsidian - has been repor- ted as in excess of 30 percent of the total of obsidian found at Bouqras". Eastern Anatolian sources at this time were supplying sites both in the Levant (Ramad) and Luristan (Ali Kosh); ibid : Fig. 112. (54) CAUVIN 1968 : Fig. 50 : 9 and 10. (55) CAUVIN 1972 : 102-3. (56) PARR et al. forthcoming. (57) However it must not be assumed that Bouqras was an isolated "outlier" of this complex without more evidence; we already know of two other Neolithic sites on the Khabour : Tell es-Sin, found only this year by the Bouqras team (AKKERMANS et al. In press, see their map Fig. 1) with material of the same type, and Tell Fakheriyah, near Tell Halaf, where arrowheads of Byblos point type as well as celts, sickle- blades and obsidian blades, were incorporated into the soil used to made bricks for the early 1st Mil. structures (L. BRAIDWOOD, in Mc EWAN et al. 1958). We have much to learn of the limits and distribu- tion of the Neolithic cultures in this area. (58) MATTHERS et al. 1978 and in preparation. (59) MERPERT in press. (60) CONTENSION 1978 : 350. (6 1 ) The question of abandonment is fraught with difficulties ; not only do workers disagree as to the timetable for post-Pleistocene clima- tic fluctuations, but other factors, such as the exhaustion of resources around the site, or political upheavals etc., could have had the same effect. 268</page><page sequence="19">OBSERVATIONS OF THE PREHISTORY OF THE BALIKH VALLEY The Chalcolithic Phase in the Balikh Valley We come now to the "painted pottery cultures", and it is regrettable that at no site in our region can we see in stratigraphy any kind of transition from the Neolithic to the Early or Middle Halaf phase, the latter being dated broadly to the latter half of the 6th Mil. B.C. (62). The origins of the Halaf culture are still un- known (63). The earliest manifestations seem to occur between the Khabour in the northern Jezirah and the Tigris river in the Mosul region, beginning about 5500 B.C. (i.e. contemporary with Amuq B); they are seen at Tell Aqab, Tell Halaf, and at Tell Arpachiyah in Mallowan's levels Pre-T.T.10 and Hijara's earlier levels, XI - VI, his Phases I and II (64). In its Middle phase, the Halaf culture spread over the southern Jezirah reaching the Levant; in its Late phase, which would be contem- porary with Amuq C, it extended even further south and east. In the Balikh, although it arrived fairly early, the Halaf culture seems to have reoccupied an uninhabited area ; no connection is seen at Assouad/ Aswad between the exposures of Mallowan and Cauvin. (In fact, since both found scarce Halaf sherds at the top, associated with rectangular (not circular) buildings, and Cauvin found Neolithic levels from top to base, it seems quite likely that Mallowan's building was in fact Neolithic, and older than the Halaf sherds.) It will be recalled that the architecture found by Cauvin was reminiscent of that at Bouqras, and that the base dated to c. 6585 B.C., a thousand years before the Early Halaf is held to have begun in the north. However, on Bouqras analogies, if Assouad lasted until c. 5900 B.C., the "gap" only lasted about 400 years. There is no transition in the Middle Euphrates valley, where the early Neolithic sites (Mureybet, Abu Hureyra, Bouqras) were abandoned, the next attested occupation being Middle/ Late Halaf (at Shamseddine, Mureybet Gas Pump, Tell Krein, etc. (65)). A different situation is again seen in the Sinjar, where the series of local early pottery cultures (succeed- ing perhaps the Aceramic phase reported by Merpert at Magzalia) (66) are apparently overtaken by Hassunan and then by influence from Samarran painted pottery cultures, either without a break or with a much less clearly marked hiatus. Only in the northern Jazirah does the Halaf have immediate antecedents in stratigraphy - the Altmono- chrome at Tell Halaf, for example, and at Tell Aqab; at the former, the C. 14 date of 5600 B.C. suggests that it is later - contemporary with Amuq B. Until recently, Tell Halaf was the only site with such evidence, and unfortunately could not be used to illustrate the precise course of the development from unpainted to painted pottery. Thanks to the work of Davidson at Tell Aqab (where there is, at the base, 33% of burnish- ed monochrome pottery with the Halaf) we now have a stratigraphie sequence documenting a part of the change, as well as the sequence through time of Halaf development - i.e. its Early, Middle, Late and Transi- tion al (to Ubaid) phases; these are based primarily on pottery shapes, painted designs and the decline of the percentage of burnished monochrome wares. There are no. C.14 dates from Aqab as yet, but if we follow the timetable for the Halaf sequence proposed by Mellaart (67), the early phase at Aqab (according to the pottery sequence established by Davidson) would have started about 5500 B.C. (68). Some of the sherds found at Mounbateh can proba- bly be assigned to the Early Phase; already mentioned was a certain neck decoration on jars (Fig. 9 : 4) which occurs only in Early Halaf levels at Aqab, as do certain motifs on straight-sided bowls. The most characteristic form is perhaps the "cream-bowl" type of low carinated vessel (as in our Fig. 6 : 1) or squat carinated jar (Fig. 6 : 3); both are common in the Early and Middle Halaf at Aqab, according to T. Davidson (69). A few sherds at Mounbateh appear, therefore, to represent an early in- cursion into the Balikh valley by Halaf folk. They evi- dently remained, since the bulk of collection consisted of Middle or Late Halaf and Transitional types, for exam- ple, the red and black bichrome sherds, which occur only in Late Halaf levels at Aqab. Some of the bucrania (62) MELLAART 1975; HOURS et al. forthcoming. (63) It is unfortunate that we know so little of the likeliest source area - the vast region of foothills between the Syro-Turkçsh frontier and the Halaf site of Tilki Tepe, beside Lake Van; see comments of MELLAART 1975 : 169-70.

(68) It is reassuring to learn that broadly the same progression can be detected from a study of Mallowan's Arpachiyah material, and that, when various factors are taken into account, Chagar Bazaar 15-12 follows the same pattern (DAVIDSON 1977). (69) P.c. 1978. 269</page><page sequence="20">OBSERVATIONS OF THE PREHISTORY OF THE BALIKH VALLEY would be of Middle and Late style (70). As for the Samarran and Samarran-related sherds, we know from Iraqi evidence that the Samarra culture was succeeded by Transitional and Ubaid II levels at Choga Marni, or had disappeared, by about 4900 B.C. (71); hence, tra- ding or other links between them and the Mounbateh Halafians must have taken place during the Middle Halaf period - perhaps between the Balikh sites and Baghouz. So far Baghouz is the westernmost known Samarran site (72); it is c. 250 km distant from Moun- bateh. A further confirmation of Samarran links with (or influence on) the Euphrates Middle Halafians is the presence of Halaf and Samarran sherds, in association with Amuq В rocker-impressed and pattern-burnished sherds, at the base of Chagar Bazaar (level 15), as Davidson has noted (73). It would seem that some sup- posedly "Samarran" motifs, such as the pendant tassels ("dancing ladies") were used not only at Halafian sites (T. Halaf and T. Chagar Bazaar) but also in Sumer e.g. at Eridu ; they seem quite common at Mounbateh (Fig. 8 : 2, 3 et 5, and Fig. 9). In sum, Mounbateh saw Middle and Late Halaf phases, which must be contemporary with the great expansion of this culture between 5000 and 4750 B.C., when it reached (either directly or through "influence") the Mediterranean in the west (Ras Shamra IV) and, by the Late phase, to the Diyala and beyond in the east ("J" ware). This seems to have ended around 4500 B.C., by which time some sites were entering the Transitional phase between Late Halaf and Northern Ubaid (74). The question of where to "place" the Transitional phase was alluded to above ; as a result of Davidson's study, material of this phase has been recognised at a number of sites, for example Tepe Gawra levels XX and XIX ; it was absent from Arpachiyah, which was appa- rently abandoned after the Late Halaf phase of T.T.6-5. The characteristic "hybrid" aspect noted by Mallowan at Mefesh consists of Ubaid-like shapes and fabric, but with Halaf-like motifs and patterns. Where there was continuity of occupation this was "effectively a fourth Halafian phase", as Davidson puts it. It would be contemporary with Amuq D in the west, and, judging by the presence of bow-rim jars, a form characteristic of this phase, on a number of Jezirah and Euphrates sites, it was fairly widespread in Syria; the bow-rim jar painted in Halaf style from Mounbateh (Fig. 7 : 6) resembles one from Tell Halaf having the egg and dot design on the shoulder (75). Besides Mefesh, the Tran- sitional phase was surely present on tells Chahine, Zai- dan and Subhi Abiad. From the excavation at Mefesh we know that rectangular architecture was in use, and that circular domestic installations in the courtyards continued the Halafian tradition. Organic remains inclu- ded reeds from the roof, barley grains, willow and poplar wood, and the bones of a large goat, a large bovid and a small equid (76). At Tell Aqab, as at Tepe Gawra, this phase seems to have passed smoothly unto the Northern Ubaid, and this must cause us to wonder whether the Halaf culture really did break up and come to a sudden end, as we heretofore assumed (77). On the Balikh, the Ubaid phase proper appears to be most clearly present on Tell es-Sawwan (Fig. 14). Mallo- wan has commented on the relative scarcity of Ubaid material in Syria, in contrast to Iraq, where it is abun- dant. Only a few Ubaid sites have been published, so that it is hard to find analogues for the pottery styles in our collections. Judging by the material from Brak and Chagar Bazaar (shortly to be augmented by finds from the new excavations of D. Oates), as well as from Tell 'Anab as-Safina on the Euphrates (78), Northern Ubaid sherds also occurred on Tells Helu, Subhi Abiad and Zaidan, not forgetting Tell es-Semaan (79). We do not know whether one or both Ubaid phases are present (Ubaid III and IV of the scheme of J. Oates), but we learn that both are present at Brak (80); these phases would correspond to the end of Amuq D and Amuq E in Levant terms. The C. 14 date from level 4 at Qalaat al-Mudik of 3595 B.C. (Amuq E), reported by Collon et al. (8 1 ), provides a clue as to the date of the Post-Ubaid phase - at least at those sites where there was a change of culture at this stage, e.g. Ras Shamra III В h-f, where (70) Recent work at Arpachiyah, as well as at Yarim Tepe II and Yarim Tepe III, indicates that naturalistic motifs are not confined to Early Halaf phases, as was once thought.

(74) If the dates of level 6/7 at Yarim Tepe II are correct (4550 and 4450 ВС - MERPERT and MUNČHAEV 1977 Sumer 33), they place it late in the Halaf sequence, confirming DAVIDSON'S view that the styles are those of the late Halaf. Of course, the new site of Yarim Tepe III might be earlier. (75) VON OPPENHEIM 1943 : Tafel XLV, 5. (76) MALLOWAN 1938. (77) MELLAART 1975 : 23. (78) BOUNI et al. 1974. (79) CAUVIN 1970.

As for post-Ubàid occupation along the Balikh, our impression is the same as that of Mallowan, i.e. that there was perhaps another hiatus in the proto-literate or Bronze Age periods; apart from a possible Ninevite 5 sherd, no clearly Uruk or related material was found, but this is perhaps because not specifically searched for. Ecology in the Balikh Valley One aspect of our survey has not been mentioned. The two prehistorians greatly benefited from the com- pany of the geomorphologists on their perigrinations. Living in the valley for a sustained period and circulat- ing with our colleagues resulted in our gaining an improved understanding of past environments and the effects these had on the daily activities of the rural population, past and present. The fundamental facts of life in the Lower Balikh and Middle Euphrates, that is, the work patterns imposed on the farmers, shepherds, transhumant nomads and their womenfolk by the cli- matic regime, could be distinguished as passing through various stages : the modern phase where the "new agri- culture" is based on flood control, irrigation, cash-crops and the use of machinery; the more ancient cycle upon which the present system is superimposed, of transhu- mance, mixed farming and pastoralism, interwoven in the symbiotic relationships which allowed the same terrain to be differentially exploited according to sea- son (82); before this, the prehistoric open forest environ- ment, as it would have been when our 7th Mil. folk arrived. Here, as mentioned in Note 4, we presume that conditions were less severe than today, due to better water retention, among other factors. Even today the steppe country above the flood-plain can provide pas- ture in late spring, and often into early summer, when enclosed depressions, can, for a time, retain an accumu- lation of moisture (83); when this fails, the flocks of sheep and goats can be withdrawn to the river valleys and the bottom-lands of their tributary wadis, where they are able to survive the summer because the pre- sence of the river ensures the maintenance of a water table, and provides water for them to drink (84). Today, sheep and goats are the only stock animals reared in the Middle Euphrates valley (excluding workers such as dogs, donkeys and horses), but this need not have been so in prehistoric times. Nevertheless, our impression is that some form of pastoralism would be mandatory for groups who chose to inhabit this part of Syria; it was probably the recourse of the people of Bouqras and related sites at the end of the 7th Mil., used in conjunc- tion with hunting and perhaps even primitive irrigation agriculture (85). If the Euphrates valley in the Raqqa - Deir ez-Zor region and the lower course of the Balikh are climati- cally comparable, this is not the case of the upper reaches of the latter. As one passes north of Hammam Turkman village (Fig. 1 , Map 2) and enters the northern Jezirah, slight changes can be observed in the topogra- phy, vegetation and life-style of the villagers. One is now in the dry-farming zone, and closer to the 300 mm isohyet; cattle are raised here, and one sees the occasio- nal orchard and grove of trees. The tells become very numerous, and it is known that many are prehistoric. We hope to study part of this area next season, using the same combination of geomorphological observation and study of archaeological finds. Some intriguing ques- tions could not be answered by this method, for exam- ple : do the bucrania on our Mounbateh sherds repre- sent trophies of wild oxen, hunted in Balikh thickets, or are they the bulls of the Halafians' cattle herds (or their plough-animals, as Davidson has suggested) ? However, it should be possible to know whether there were, or were not, thickets, capable of supporting wild cattle; this and other such reconstructions could be useful to excavators. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Superficial as the present survey has been, it has nevertheless produced eight additional prehistoric sites in the Lower Balikh and alerted us to the need to follow up certain aspects of the typologies, cultural distribu- tions and chronology in the region.

(85) In making these comments, camel-dependent nomads have not been considered, because it is not clear how much earlier than the Assyrian period the Bedouin way of life began. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that the Balikh area until recently formed the summer quarters of certain "true" Bedouin tribes who, come October, crossed the Euphrates to winter in the warmer south-est (Wadi Hauran) area (MULLER 1931). We Ourselves observed one day near Deir ez-Zor the appearance of camels in herds of many hundred each, travelling along the old north-west to south-east migration route, presumably some to market and the rest to the winter pasturage in the Syrian desert. 271</page><page sequence="22">OBSERVATIONS OF THE PREHISTORY OF THE BALIKH VALLEY thic enclave' can be distinguished in the vicinity of Hamman Turkman village (86). It is likely that a new Early Halaf area can be added to the known range of that phase. The data available so far indicates that the Neolithic and Chalcolithic flint industries are remarka- bly similar, except for the absence of arrowheads and increase of sickle-blades in the latter; at the same time, in comparison with the Levant, some of the technical methods are very different here, and obsidian is present on a scale not seen in the west. If there appear to be one or more gaps in occupation at least there seem to be more links across the 'Khabour gap' (87) than was appa- rent heretofore, both in the late 7th Mil. 'Intermittent Ceramic' phase and in the 6th Mil. Middle Halaf and Samarra phases. In short, as might have been predicted, given its location roughly half-way between the Levant and Nor- thern Mesopotamian cultural zones, the Balikh region has its own particular sequence, which reflects contribu- tions from each. To conclude, I would like to thank those colleagues who have corresponded with me or who have examin- ed the material or the drawings, especially L. Braid- wood, T. Davidson, I. Hijara, J. Mellaart, P. Mortensen, J. Oates, C. Renfrew, M. Van Loon and others; many of their valuable comments have been incorporated into the text, but they are not necessarily responsible for my interpretations. ADDENDUM After this paper had been sent to the publisher I received some new information from Dr. M. Voigt, to whom I am most grateful. It appears that obsidian side- blow flakes were excavated from all phases of Hajji Firuz Tepe, N.W. Iran, which has C.14 dates of c. 5300 - 5100 B.C. in mid-sequence. Both the 'true' thin-sec- tions and the parent blades or 'cores' are present, amounting to 15 out of 21 1 artifacts. A piece illustrated in Dr. Voigt's dissertation (88) looks identical to our no. 14, Fig. IB. Hence, to the geographical distribution of these artifacts we can now add a more northerly area, one which is closer to the obsidian sources; as to the chronological range, we know that they begin in Iraq in e.g. Aceramic Jarmo and it appears that they last almost to the end of the 6th Mil., at least at Hajji Firuz.
