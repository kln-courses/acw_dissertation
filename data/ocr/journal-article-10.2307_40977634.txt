This paper presents a detailed anthropometrical analysis of osteological mate- rials collected by Dr. M. W. Stirling during his explorations at Cerro de la Mesas in the state of Vera Cruz Mexico during 1940-41. Two enquiries are stressed in the study, the possibility of determining the somatic characteristics of the ethnographic, historic and archaelogical group known as "Olmecs", and the establishment of so- matic analogies between the Olmecs and other cultural or linguistic groups. The series consists of 10 crania, 17 mandibles, 4 femurs, 3 humeri and 3 radii plus miscellaneous and fragmentary skeletal bones. Seven skulls are sufficiently preserved to permit measurement and the calculation of indices. Five of the ten skulls show artificial deformation while five do not. The following table extracts a few of the recorded anthropometric measures and indices in order to illustrate the characteristics of the series: 136</page><page sequence="2">BOLETIN BIBLIOGRAFICO DE ANTROPOLOGIA AMERICANA Crania Cranium N?

These run from 1448 mm. to 1660 mm. for the males; and 1410 mm. to 1634 mm. for the females. Dental mutilation is noted, there being examples of types A, C, E and P as classified by Rubin de la Borbolla (Am. J. Phys. Anth. XXVI, pp. 349-362). A comparison between other American Indian groups and the Olmec series is set forth through tables of the important indices. A few of the observations Which may be noted from these tables are as follows: Horizontal cranial index: Cerro de las Mesas specimens higher than any other group set forth. Vertical cranial index: Cerro de las Mesas series has wide range but falls toward the high end of the distribution scale. Vertical transverse index: Cerro de las Mesas series lower than any other Ame- rican crania considered. Cranial module: At the low end of the scale of indices quoted, the nearest being those from Kentucky, from Tennessee and the Apaches. Total facial index: Of the three in the Cerro de las Mesas series two are euryprosopic and one is mesoprosopic. In the comparative table the other eurypro- sopic specimens are from Madisonville, from Kentucky, and the Apaches. The mesoprosopic skull has an index similar to a number from the southern and wes- tern United States. 137</page><page sequence="3">INSTITUTO PANAMERICANO DE GEOGRAFIA E HISTORTA Superior facial index: In this index the Cerro de las Mesas specimens approach- most closely the Paltacalos, the Santa Rosa and the Lagoa Santa populations. Nasal Index: The tendency of the Cerro de las Mesas series is toward pla- tyrrhiny, resembling the Delawares, Pecos, Louisiana, Pericues, Iroquois and Palta- calos populations. Orbital index: The Cerro de las Mesas is preponderantly hypsiconch, although one cranium, a female with only the left orbit gives a mesoconch index. Other hypsiconch types noted include the Eskimo, Arikara, Apaches, Santa Catalina,. Calif., and Paucarcancha populations. In general the Cerro de las Mesas population did not present a single unified somatic type, there being at least two "Olmec" types. The similarities in specific- characters between the Cerro de las Mesas people and their neighboring groups neither prove ethnic relationship nor may these resemblances be discounted as- coincidence in view of the present paucity of materials. The anthropomorphic repre- sentations in "Olmec" art cannot be accepted as indicative of an "Olmec" physical type. Although some features in the art are founded on true physical characteris- tics, no general physical type is represented. Spencer L. Rogers</page></plain_text>
