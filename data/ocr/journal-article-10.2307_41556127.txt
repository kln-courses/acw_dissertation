<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rome's Disgrace: The Politics of Rope in Shakespeare's Lucrece PETER J. SMITH W.B. Yeats's 'Leda and the Swan' is probably the most famous literary rape of the twentieth century: A sudden blow: the great wings beating still Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill, He holds her helpless breast upon his breast. How can those terrified vague fingers push The feathered glory from her loosening thighs? And how can body, laid in that white rush, But feel the strange heart beating where it lies? A shudder in the loins engenders there The broken wall, the burning roof and tower And Agamemnon dead. Being so caught up, So mastered by the brute blood of the air, Did she put on his knowledge with his power Before the indifferent beak could let her drop? In the original edition, published in The Dial in June 1924, Yeats noted: 'I wrote Leda and the Swan because the editor of a political review asked me for a poem. . . . My fancy began to play with Leda and the Swan for metaphor, and I began this poem; but as I wrote, bird and lady took such possession of the scene that all politics went out of it." That Yeats views politics and rape as mutually exclusive is hardly surprising. On the one hand, an offence so clearly directed at the person and so intimately executed seems worlds away from the larger social structures that constitute the political. Even though Jove's rape of Leda is shown to unleash the violence of the Trojan war - as the reference to 'the burning roof and tower' makes plain - the painful © CS 2005</page><page sequence="2">1 6 Critical Survey, Volume 1 7, Number 3 focus on the 'terrified vague fingers', the seized nape, breast and thighs implants the poem with a physicality which has the effect of evoking the sadistic act rather than exploring the ideological implications of the moment. Moreover, the final lines ask a dangerously leading question - was Leda in some way empowered by her forcible coupling with a god? Did she, in other words, profit by the act? In 1968 William Empson infamously made the same suggestion of Lucrece: 'She was no virgin, having several children; and it is a basic fact about the young Shakespeare that he considers young men in general overwhelmingly desirable to women, let alone brave young lords. Thus she took an involuntary pleasure in the rape, though she would have resisted it in any way possible; that is why she felt guilty, and why some of her blood turned black'.2 The fact that Yeats could have seen such questions as apolitical or that Empson could have viewed the episode in terms of personal blame is a sign of the shift in sensibility between 1924/1968 and the present day. For contemporary feminist critics, rape is an act of the most profoundly political nature and it would seem that this view of rape is shared by Shakespeare's The Rape of Lucrece. As Sara E. Quay has argued, 'Lucrece is not able to be raped because she is a woman, but because she is constructed as a woman who is able to be raped* The feminist rationale is not difficult to see. In cultures in which rape is accepted as an albeit abnormal part of sexual behaviour, it is naturalised and the circumstances that produce it remain unquestioned and therefore dangerously unchallenged. If, on the other hand, rape is viewed as a social or political construction, the reasons for its acceptance and perhaps even its existence are available for interrogation. It is my contention that Shakespeare's poem sets out to display the 'constructedness' of rape and that its concentration on the political aspects of the crime are not due to a shying away from the horror of the act itself, but rather reveal the social and cultural organisations that allow rape to occur in the first place. In such a way this essay takes issue with Coppélia Kahn's assertion that criticism of The Rape of Lucrece 'has so far failed to confront' the rape in the poem.4 While she may be right that it is 'painfiil to confront the poem squarely', the poem's stress on the political consequences of the crime and the political circumstances that led to it, constitutes an empowering rather than a disempowering reading for a feminist agenda in that it makes manifest not the physical details of the assault but rather the patriarchal structures that permit and even sponsor the activity.5</page><page sequence="3">Rome s Disgrace : Shakespeare s Lucrece 1 7 Rape in Renaissance literature was often set in directly political circumstances. In a horrible instance, Tamburlaine defies the supplications of the Damascan virgins who plead with him to spare the marital security of the city's population: Pitie the mariage bed, where many a Lord In prime and gloríe of his loving joy, Embraceth now with teares of ruth and blood, The jealous bodie of his fearfull wife, Whose cheekes and hearts so punisht with conceit, To thinke thy puisant never staied arme Will part their bodies, and prevent their soules From heavens of comfort, yet their age might beare, Now waxe all pale and withered to the death -6 The husbands' 'jealous' embrace is to be ruptured by Tamburlaine's soldiers so that the defilement of the marriage bed is seen to be an act of war. In a moment of thinly veiled phallic aggression, Tamburlaine mocks the virgins by introducing them to Death, who sits on the end of his sword: 'there sits Death, there sits imperious Death, / Keeping his circuit by the slicing edge' (V. i. 1 1 1-12). Tamburlaine voices his determination to defile the city in terms that suggest the sexual nature of his invasion: 'I will not spare these proud Egyptians, / ... for the love of Venus, would she leave / The angrie God of Armes, and lie with me' (V i. 121-5); the violation of the city will be even more sexually charged than sleeping with the goddess of love. Even Zenocrate, the woman Tamburlaine claims to love, has been subjected to his sexual assault. Agydas asks her why she appears so troubled given that she has had so long to get over her abduction by Tamburlaine: 'Tis more then pitty such a heavenly face / Should by hearts sorrow wax so wan and pale, / When your offensive rape by Tamburlaine I ... Hath seem'd to be digested long agoe' (III. ii. 4-8). These instances exemplify the essentially political nature of the sexual crime as well as its ineluctable contiguity with martial conflict. A decade later, this tyrannical sexuality reappears in another fearful example, this time in Shakespeare's Henry V. Before the siege of Harfleur, the romanticised warrior spits out threats of sexual violation designed to terrorise the Governor into submission: If I begin the batt'ry once again I will not leave the half-achievèd Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie burièd.</page><page sequence="4">1 8 Critical Survey, Volume 1 7, Number 3 The gates of mercy shall be all shut up, And the fleshed soldier, rough and hard of heart, In liberty of bloody hand shall range With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass You fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants . . . What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause, If your pure maidens fall into the hand Of hot and forcing violation? What rein can hold licentious wickedness When down the hill he holds his fierce career? . . .why in a moment look to see The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters.7 Not only will the female inhabitants be sexually assaulted but, as my emphases demonstrate, the city itself will be laid waste as if it were a female victim of a perverted attack. As Heather Dubrow has pointed out, 'given the common association of gates with the vagina, the notion of rape is latent in the image of the attacked city.'8 Towards the end of the same play the French King describes the hitherto peaceful cities in terms of anthropomorphic landscapes. Their intact walls make them politically virginal: 'you see them perspectively, the cities turned into a maid - for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never entered' (V. ii. 317). In his oration to his troops on the eve of Bosworth, King Richard galvanises his men with the threat that if they lose the battle, their lands and wives will pay the price: You having lands and blessed with beauteous wives, They would distrain the one, distain the other. Shall these enjoy our lands? Lie with our wives? Ravish our daughters? (V vi. 51-67) Moreover, this sexually charged intimidation is not merely the warped and twisted oratory of the play's villain; even the political saviour, Richmond, attempts to arouse his soldiers with threats to their womenfolk: 'If you do fight in safeguard of your wives, / Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors' (V v. 213-14). Though less blunt and offensive than Richard's rhetoric, the threat is the same - if you lose this battle, you will be cuckolded. In The Rape of Lucrece the rampaging army appears as a version of Tarquin's engorged veins which, let loose, run away in a riot of</page><page sequence="5">Rome s Disgrace: Shakespeare s Lucrece 1 9 impetuous rape and murder, levelling all in front of them, including the rhyme scheme: And they like straggling slaves for pillage fighting, Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting, In bloody death and ravishment delighting, Nor children's tears nor mothers' groans respecting, Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting. Anon his beating heart, alarum striking, Gives the hot charge, and bids them do their liking. (428-34) This concatenation between urban devastation and rape is figured most clearly in the poem during Lucrece's contemplation of the picture of the Trojan war. As she summons up her memory of the whereabouts of the picture, the immediacy of the two events is reinforced: At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece Of skilful painting made for Priam's Troy, Before the which is drawn the power of Greece, For Helen's rape the city to destroy. (1366-9) Urban and female ravishment are fused. In The Rape of Lucrece , as has often been noted, the act itself occupies only a tiny fragment - lines 673-83, that is ten lines out of the poem's 1855 lines or 0.54 percent. This is a startling statistic and firmly gives the lie to the suggestion that (as far as this poem is concerned) 'rape is a strangely pleasurable topic to read about because it draws us to what is perceived as a "closed" topic, a taboo'.9 In fact this poem is quite the opposite of Yeats's since it lacks any close attention to the process of forced intercourse. Instead the poem dwells on the larger political context that surrounds the attack. In the 'Argument', the rape occupies only a single perfunctory sentence: 'The same night he treacherously stealeth into her chamber, violently ravished her, and early in the morning speedeth away.' It then goes on to spell out, in much greater detail, the political consequences of the action: with one consent they [Lucrece's relatives and friends] all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the Tarquins, and, bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted the people with the doer and the manner of the vile deed, with a bitter invective against the tyranny of the King; wherewith the people were so moved that with one consent and a general</page><page sequence="6">20 Critical Survey, Volume 1 7, Number 3 acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled and the state government changed from kings to consuls. The rape, then, is first and foremost a political action with grave political consequences. It is the moment that transforms the Kingdom of Rome into a republic and the poem is thus much more a narrative of cultural formation than an account of a gross act of violence. Its very setting - the siege of Ardea - frames the action, much as the Trojan war frames the action of Troilus and Cressida; the feuding of Verona frames the central affair of Romeo and Juliet; and the civil disorder between the triumvirate defines the world of Antony and Cleopatra. But in addition to the setting, the poem's metaphorical treatment of its heroine and her violation is quite explicitly and deliberately politicised. As Peter Stallybrass, Georgianna Zeigler and Linda Woodbridge have shown, the female body is frequently a site of masculine occupation and colonial struggle.10 Examples are legion, the most famous of which are Donne's 'Oh my America, my new found lande, / My kingdome, safeliest when with one man man'd, / My myne of precious stones, my Empiree, / How blest am I in this discovering thee' (27-30), as well as Ralegh's naming of his newly founded colony: Virginia, and his evocative description of Guiana in 1595 as 'a country that hath yet her maydenhead'.11 Petruchio's definition of his new wife as '[m]y household-stuif, my field, my barn' ( The Taming of the Shrew, III. iii. 103-4) and Valentine's description of his love as a 'principality' (Two Gentlemen of Verona, II. iv. 150) are further examples. This Renaissance geo-eroticism dramatises the inherent violence as well as the facelessness of masculine desire. These landscaped women are generally supine, still and anonymous from the neck up. In Thomas Carew's 'A Rapture' the female body is itemised, dissected and fragmented as it melts mysteriously into a fervently eroticised landscape: I'le seize the Rose-buds in their perfiim'd bed, The Violet knots, like curious Mazes spread О 're all the Garden, taste the ripned Cherry, The warme, firme Apple, tipt with corali berry: Then will I visit, with a wandring kisse, The vale of Lillies, and the Bower of blisse: And where the beauteous Region doth divide Into two milkie wayes, my lips shall slide</page><page sequence="7">Rome s Disgrace: Shakespeare 's Lucrece 2 1 Downe those smooth Allies, wearing as I goe A tract for lovers on the printed snow; Thence climbing o're the swelling Appettine, Retire into thy grove of Eglantine. (63-74)12 Like Donne's intrepid explorer, Carew's persona is also a cartographer leaving his trail for others to follow as they certainly will, for in this poem and the female landscape of the Renaissance, woman is sexually available for anyone. The poet of 'A Rapture' despises those 'greedy men that seek to enclose the common, / And within private armes empale free woman' (19-20), but she is not free herself, rather she is freely available to everyone else, just like Jonson's Doll Common who speaks of herself as a commonwealth, 'Haue yet, some care of me, o' your republique ' {The Alchemist, I. i. 1 10). 13 Land held in common and women commonly used lose their value. Robert Tofte insists on the consequences of trespassing: And so puissant and potent is this our desire, which wee haue to enioy that Party (which wee loue) soly and alone, without the societie and company of any other whatsoeuer, as that (many times) when this our high-pris'd Com modi tie chanceth to light into some other merchants hands, and that this our private Inclosure proueth to be a Common for others, we care no more for it, but giue it altogether ouer.14 Woman comes to be an object for man's libidinal pleasure rather than a presence in her own right in these sexually charged pastorals. As Mercedes Maroto Camino writes, 'woman is nothing other than the unlucky terrain where political struggles are fought and her sexuality the liminal space where a culture establishes its coordinates and fixes its boundaries."5 It is trenchantly significant that the Latin verb rapere, 'to take by force', gives us both rapture and rape. This vocabulary of geo-sexual assault is employed during Shakespearean rapes. Titus Andronicus addresses the raped Lavinia as '[t]hou map of woe' (III. ii. 12) while the sleeping Lucrece is described, immediately prior to her rape, as a 'map of death' (402). Her breasts are 'like ivory globes circled with blue, / A pair of maiden worlds unconquerèd' (407-8). As her male relatives attempt to console her she turns from them: 'with a joyless smile she turns away / The face, that map which deep impression bears / Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears' (171 1-13). Lucrece is landscaped in such a way as to reify her as an object of masculine ownership or</page><page sequence="8">22 Critical Survey, Volume 1 7, Number 3 occupation - as Collatine pronounces 'she was my wife. / 1 owed her, and 'tis mine that she hath killed' (1802-3). The poem articulates the rape as a kind of trespass just as Tofte describes it: Tarquin's hand rests '[o]n her bare breast, the heart of all her land' (439) and the final image of the dead and bleeding body is of 'a late-sacked island [which] vastly stood, / Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood' (1740-1). In addition, this imagery of physical geography, that is of natural scenery, is overlaid with the discourse of urban invasion I have already documented. Repeatedly and in a way that emphasises the political rather than the physical, the body of Lucrece is transmogrified into the features of a cityscape - Tarquin's 'hand did scale / Left their [her breasts'] round turrets destitute and pale' (440-1); 'His hand that yet remains upon her breast - / Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall -' (463-4); the movement of her breathing 'moves in him more rage and lesser pity / To make the breach and enter this sweet city' (468-9); 'Under that colour am I come to scale / Thy never-conquered fort' (481-2). Lucrece is both a colonised landmass and a besieged city and her attack is, in places, indistinguishable from the larger political strife - the siege of Ardea - with which the poem opens: Tarquin's assault is described as a 'siege that hath engirt his [Collatine's] marriage' (22 1) while Lucrece herself images the violation of her soul in terms of a routed castle: Her house is sacked, her quiet interrupted, Her mansion battered by the enemy, Her sacred temple spotted, spoiled, corrupted, Grossly engirt with daring infamy. Then let it not be called impiety If in this blemished fort I make some hole Through which I may convey this troubled soul. (1 170-6) Lucrece appears as yet another spoiled man-made structure: a muddied fountain. She appeals to Tarquin to '[m]ud not the fountain that gave drink to thee' (577); the rape is likened to the poisonous toads that 'infect fair founts with venom mud' (850); and as she addresses the possibility of her own redemption she notes that '[t]he poisoned fountain clears itself again' (1707). Lavinia too appears as a polluted fountain. Titus tells her attackers, '[h]ere stands the spring whom you have stained with mud' (Titus Adronicus, V ii. 169) and he proposes to his daughter that they should 'sit round about some</page><page sequence="9">Rome s Disgrace: Shakespeare s Lucrece 23 fountain' and cry into it: 'in the fountain shall we gaze so long / Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness, / And made a brine pit with our bitter tears' (III. i. 123, 127-9). Clearly, in a society predicated on primogeniture, rape muddies the line of descent so that the clarity of legitimate lineage is mired in dynastic confusion. In addition to the employment of these ideologically loaded images of country, city and fountain, the outcome of Lucrece's rape is publicly staged. Just as we witness the aftermath of Lavinia's ordeal at the hands of Demetrius and Chiron - the actual rape takes place offstage ( Titus Andronicus, II. iii. 187) - so the audience that witnesses Lucrece's 'confession' and the procession of her body ensures that her suffering is publicly acknowledged. In this way her wounds, like those of Julius Caesar, are displayed to political ends: 'They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence, / To show her bleeding body thorough Rome, / And so to publish Tarquín 's foul offence' (1850-2, my emphases). Virtue is conspicuous: 'Poor grooms are sightless night, kings glorious day. / Gnats are unnoted wheresoe'er they fly, / But eagles gazed upon with every eye' (1013-15). Moreover, while men seem to be able to cover their tracks with machiavellian cunning, women have no choice but to reveal their inner corruption: 'Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks, / Poor women's faces are their own faults' books' (1252-3). Little wonder then that while Tarquin exits subtly (1280-1), Lucrece's grief and funeral are public, even state occasions. Lucrece's account of the previous night is an explicit and civic event. The poem is insistent that the account takes place in front of an assembled audience: 'Collatine and his consorted lords / With sad attention long to hear her words' (1609-10); "'But ere I name him, you fair lords," quoth she, / Speaking to those that came with Collatine' (1688-9); 'Each present lord began to promise aid' (1696). Also, the vocabulary associated with her description of the rape is drawn from that of the public court: My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak; No rightful plea might plead for justice there. His scarlet lust came evidence to swear That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes; And when the judge is robbed, the prisoner dies. (1648-52, my emphases) Injustice is not only done, but it is seen to be done and the reason this is important is because chastity is as much about public - that is</page><page sequence="10">24 Critical Survey, Volume 1 7, Number 3 political - reputation as personal virtue. As Hamlet instructs his mother, repute is all: 'Assume a virtue if you have it not' (III. iv. 1 5 1 ). In The Duchess of Malfi , Ferdinand's apocalyptic vision links sexual licence with fading reputation: Upon a time, Reputation, Love, and Death Would travell ore the world: and 'twas concluded That they should part, and take three severall wayes: Death told them, they should find him in great Battailes, Or Cities plagu'd with plagues: Love gives them corniceli To enquire for him 'mongst unambitious shepheards, Where dowries were not talk'd of: and sometimes 'Mongst quiet kindred, that had nothing left By their dead Parents: stay (quoth Reputation) Doe not forsake me; for it is my nature If once I part from any man I meete I am never found againe. And so, for you: You have shooke hands with Reputation, And made him invisible: So fare you well. I will never see you more. (III. ii. 123-37)16 Sexuality (especially female sexuality) is public property, an index of the civilisation of the society in which it resides. Brutus is adamant that the rape of Lucrece is just as much (if not more so) a crime against the state as against her person. Collatinus is not considered to be the wronged husband of Lucrece but rather '[t]hou wrongèd lord of Rome' (1818) and Brutus' call to action is peppered with conspicuous references to the city: Courageous Roman, do not steep thy heart In such relenting dew of lamentations, But kneel with me, and help to bear thy part To rouse our Roman gods with invocations That they will suffer these abominations - Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced - By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased. Now by the Capitol that we adore, And by this chaste blood so unjustly stained, By heaven's fair sun that breeds the fat earth's store, By all our country rights in Rome maintained, And by chaste Lucrece' soul that late complained Her wrongs to us, and by this bloody knife, We will revenge the death of this true wife. (1828-41)</page><page sequence="11">Rome s Disgrace: Shakespeare s Lucrece 25 It is 'Rome herself [which] doth stand disgraced' - Lucrece hardly figures. At the climax of the poem then, the personal is configured as the political in a way that underlines the cultural significance of the moment, for rape is seen to be not a crime against an individual, but an offence against a civilisation. Diana Fuss questions the 'tendency to psychologize and to personalize questions of oppression, at the expense of strong materialist analyses of the structural bases of exploitation.'17 While Shakespeare's poem acts in the opposite direction, it is a brave critic who will argue that their depersonalised readings of rape must be recognised to be more progressive or radical than those that focus on the victim. Rape is after all not a literary event, but a terrible reality with real-life casualties. Notes 1 . Peter Al It and Russell K. Alspach, eds, The Variorum Edition of The Poems ofW.B.
