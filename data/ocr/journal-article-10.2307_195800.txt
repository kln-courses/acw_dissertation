<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS: GENERAL community of Tur 'Abdin, which is still widely spoken and has been well described by scholars, including Jastrow himself. There are, however, important differences and these are pointed out in comparisons between the two dialects at various places in the grammatical description. In some respects the Mlahso dialect represents an older stage of development than Turoyo. This is particularly clear in the vocabulary, where a larger range of originally Aramaic words have been preserved in the Mlahso dialect, and also in certain features of phonology. Many of the differences in grammatical features represent independent developments in the two dialects. Of particular interest is the development of the verbal forms qtile and qatil. In Turoyo the first expresses the preterite of transitive verbs and the second the preterite of intransitive verbs. In Mlahs6 the two forms express different tenses without any distinction due to the transitivity of the verb. The first is the preterite form, whereas the second expresses the present perfect tense. Overall, however, the Mlahs6 dialect is much closer to Turoyo than any other known dialect and the two should now be grouped together in the classification of neo- Aramaic. UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE GEOFFREY KHAN ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND INTERPRETATION OF THE QUR'AN IN THE THEOLOGY OF AL-QASIM IBN IBRAHIM, KITAB AL-MUSTARSHID. Edited by BINYAMIN ABRAHAMOV (Islamic Philosophy Theology and Science, Texts and Studies, Vol. 26). Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1996. xvii, 154 pp. Index. The ZaydT Imam al-Qasim ibn Ibrahim al-Hasani al-Rassi, who died in 246/860, is one of the earliest Muslim theologians whose works have survived in any quantity. He was a contemporary of the great Mu tazill scholars of the early Abbasid era, and is credited with introducing many of their ideas and methods into Zaydi theological thought. Most of al-Qasim's works are relatively brief. But they are tremendously valuable both for the insights they afford into the development of Muslim theological thinking in one of its most vigorous phases, and for the glimpses they preserve of an agile mind engaged in the task of discovering and expounding the truth about God. Al-Qasim was concerned to defend God's oneness above everything else, and in his various writings he used impressive arrays of arguments which reveal wide knowledge and surprising sensitivity towards opposing views: the description of the Trinity, for example, in his Radd ala al-Nasara is one of the clearest and closest to patristic models known from an early Muslim author. In the brief work edited here, 'The Epistle of whoever seeks Guidance', al-Qasim maintains the distinctive uniqueness of God against Qur'an teachings which may appear to suggest he resembles other beings. He examines a number of difficult verses, and shows that, when they are given the correct interpretation, they do not contradict the doctrine but rather enforce it. And to sustain his case he employs a number of methods seen also in other authors, including elucidation from other verses (tafsrr al-Qur'an bi- al-Qur'an), reference to the familiar or poetic usage of a word, and appeal to reason. He does not seem to have any single method of interpretation, but proceeding from the premise that the doctrine of tawhTd is unquestionably right, he shapes the meanings of the texts to fit. This approach marks out the Epistle as an exercise in the application of 300</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS: GENERAL reason to scripture and also as an invaluable example of Qur'an exegesis from the period of greatest Mu tazilT intellectual influence. The editor has established the text (pp. 48-144) on the basis of five manuscripts which he suggests (pp. 44-47) represent three families. He also provides an English translation (pp. 49-145 facing the Arabic) which, if somewhat clumsy in places and occasionally misleading (e.g. 'for it is an attribution of a copartner to God' for li-anna dhalika shirk, pp. 114-115), gives a helpful guide to the intricacies of the Arabic. The edition contains an introduction with a brief history of arguments against anthropomorphism from ancient times to classical Islam and summary of the Epistle's contents (pp. 1-18), a survey of al-Qasim's attitude towards the Qur'an from his surviving writings (pp. 19-29), and a discussion of his interpretative methods in this work (pp. 30-43). Much helpful material is included, though the edition lacks any information about al-Qasim himself or his works, and any indication of how the Epistle may have been influenced by and in turn have influenced other works. Its place in the tradition to which al-Qasim made this distinctive contribution is left to be resolved by others.

Richmond, Curzon, 1996. xi, 282 pp. ?14.99. These books are both very useful additions to the existing literature on Sufism, and continue the enterprising series on Sufi studies which Curzon has initiated. What is particularly useful about this series is that it makes available in English, often for the first time, works by important Sufi thinkers. These are thinkers who are often well known in the Islamic world, and who are significant for the Sufi thinkers whose works have become popular in English, and so it is doubly necessary to have some account of them available for anyone interested in the area of Islamic mysticism. Abdullah Ansarn lived in the tenth century CE, was born in Herat into a Sufi family and had a typically tumultuous career during which he went in and out of favour with the authorities and his peers largely as a result of his antagonism to what he took to be the anthropomorphism of the Ash'arites. He is best known as a staunch defender of HanbalT Islam, and his works resound with the argument that the Qur'an is pre-eternal and uncreated. Despite his Hanbalism, though, Ansari was also a Sufi, albeit certainly not the variety of Sufism which has since Ibn al-'Arabi become so well known, and remains popular in both the Shi'i and Sunni worlds. In fact, he is today far better known in the Shi'i community than in the Sunni, perhaps because it is far neater to see Hanbalism as an antagonist of Sufism. We should remember that there is a branch of Sufism which opposes ecstatic mysticism, and Ansar is a representative of such a branch. His writings display a consistent suspicion of ecstatic mysticism, an attitude in 301</page></plain_text>
