<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONTEMPORARY PSYCHOLOGISTS. PROFESSOR EDWARD ZELLER. Protessor Zeller was born in 1814. At the age of twenty-sis he became docent of theology in Tubingen, in 1849 was called to Berne as assistant professor, and to Marburg as full professor two years later. In 1862 he was called to Heidelberg and transferred from theology to the chair of Philosophy, and ten years later came to Berlill as the suc- cessor of lrendelenburg, where he is now the leading teacher among sis in his department. Here, in 1878 he was elected rector, receiving, ac- cording to the liberal German custom, a large fraction of all the exam- ination fees. His chlef publications are, Geschichte der Gr?echischen Philosophie, the first edition of which was begun in 1844, the fourth in 1876; Vortraye ?nd Ab/zandlnayen in two volumes 187o and 1877, and Geschichte der De?tschen Philosophie seit Leibnitz, In one volume, 1873. He was the founder and for nlany years the editor of Dze Theologische Zeitschrift, and has written shorter articles, to be found only in its pages. Personally he is a man of moderate height, almost alarmingly thin, sallow, of distinct, deliberate monotonous delivery of genial but somewhat precise manners in persollal intercourse. His iectures attract hundreds of students each semester. As a comparatively young man he married the daughter of F. C. Baur of Tubingen, and his family rela- tions have been exceptionally happy. He, with several others of the prominent professors of Berlin, was a frequent and familiar guest of the family of the Crown Princet Friedrich, and according to common report, was in an informal way the religious adviser of his consort. Nest to Lotze he has been, no doubt, the most influential professor in his depart- ment in Germany. He has no sy stem whatever. but has devoted his life to the critico-historical presentation of the views of others a depart- ment of labor to which nearly half of all the philosophic writings and philosophic lectures in the German Universities are now devoted. In this work he is probably without a peer. lVe shall first epitomize for OU1 readers his remarkable summary of recent investigations in the field of comparative religions and the psy- chology of religion in the newly edited tnvo volumes of essays, which contain his most personal as well as, perhaps cBriginal views. In a laboriously compzeted essay on the Origin and Essence of Religion he premises that philosophy, or psychology is the closest and most indis- pensible friend of religion. Doubt, which marks the important moment when we question or seek explanation about things which have sur- rounded us from childhood, is sure to lead to a deeper and purer faitht if it is manfully faced. The notion of God is not innate but is given perhaps necessarily, although always mediately, through experienceT and thus rests upon the same sort of grounds and inferences as the notion of atoms, and is as scientific. In fact all intellectual possessions whatever are self-won, qee make all which comes into our minds out of experience. All men irresistably infer that there are laws and that things are connected, not merely in time and space but inwardly; they not merely are, but hang together, and that not only in our ideas objec- tively carried over into e2rperience but in themselves by the law of causation. Like all things else, causality itself must have a cause.</page><page sequence="2">PSYClIOLOGICAL LITER A TURE. 157 Thus at first as many substances are postulated as there are forces ob served; later these forces are found so closely conneeted, their actions and reactions so poised and equipolated, the one by the other, that they must be thought as one. But this unity is, of course, as hypersensuous and immaterial as force itself. Consciousness in its essence is a unioll of the manifold, and hence by the very form of its knowing, its every object, n-hether cosmic or microcosmic must be a unity of the composite or fhe simple. Hence the nece3sity of inferring a primitive unitary foree. In illustration of these principles he proceeds to group a great num- ber of facts gathered from popular psychology and mythology. From just such feelings as arise vividly ill our own consciousness when we talie the first spring ramble in the country, by the sea, or under the stars, frons just such instinctive needs as we now feel in the thunder- storms, floods, in battle, famine or in sickness, and frotn the experience of comrnon family and social life, not only all poetry and mythology but all religion have taken their origin. These are the feelings and needs they interpret. The strongest and most unwonted impressions drive us irresistably beyond the limits of our own ability or knowledge to super- natural causes. General forces are not deified. There are no gods of space or gravity. There was no interest in the beautiful but only in the pleasant and the fearful; and what was more fearful than night before man svas possessed of fire. Because most of his instincts are satisfied, mall assumes that somehow his wishes also must be, and so, when thought asks, fancy answers questions, though the answers are but changed facts. Thus the first religions are polytlleistic and preserve a faithful record of thc wishes, fears and hopes of prehistoric peoples whose spirits nvere wrought upon by nature and history with an inten- sity inversely as their knowledge of them. As long as no one dreamed that, e. g., even the sun and fire might be the same, no one thought of ordering this cromTding and increasing throng of deities. But as men saw unity in the world and later as they learned to concentrate their own eflolts upon some one paramount object, did tirst some group of gods becolne paramount, and later some one god was made king or president ill the council of the others. Sometimes a tribe who had developed a nsltional deity like that of the Jews induced others by argument or by the sword to accept it as their own. Perhaps monotheism svas first the result of a philosophical critique, as among the disciples of Xenophanes, or again ullity was favored or suggested by the all-enclosing arch of heaven and the apparent limits of the horizon and the visible universe. The visible always precede the invisible gods, and monotheism is al- ways developed from polytheism. The personification of active forces iS iD fact the natural form under which the idea of cause is first repre- sented. It is impossible to follow all the subtle assoeiations of ideas by whith the wind was replecented as a breath, the lightning as God's spear. every bright or smooth st;one as an amulet, the stars as living be- ings, by which a stick was thought to reveal hidden treasure, or a back- warci look to the left to cure sickness. Whether it was at first some fanz ied analogy or a rare but opportune chance sequence in time to whieh they owe their origin, they have possessed the mind of Inan for unnumbered ages, and hence, and because they minister, however vm- worthily, to a real need they are very hard to eradicate. As long as there is no postulate that a11 things are connected by law s, and in pro- portion as man is uncertain of his own position in an unexplored world where the most uxlexpected thing may happen to him at any moment, so long and so far is he ansious to get the unknown powers on his side by presents, wounds self inflicted. the offering of animals and finally of hunan beings and especialls of innocent persons. Sometime3 the deity is small and weak, or perhaps the priest, who even in the catholic church</page><page sequence="3">158 PSYCHOLOGIC A L LITERATURE. holds a sort of eonjuring power, has found some magie liturgy or eere- mony of mighty and eonstraining eogeney and the god may even be whipped or imprisoned till the wish is gratified or the fear allayed. But religions must ever beeome more rational, i. e. immaterial. 'lnhis proeess begins before all known developed languages, in the inferenee that soul and body are distinet, and that the eyo is not a whole, made up of soul and body as subordinate unities. In the sight of a dead aequaint- anee and in dreams this distinetion begins. The sollls of men are at first loeated in the heart, head, bowels, liver, diaphragm, ete. and are weak and shadowy The ithe himselft' is the body, as in Homer. They lead an unreal life under the earth, affeeting the fruits of the fields, are figured as ghosts, manes, elves, and finally, in German mythology survive as dwarfs, till the eoneeptio)l took more definite form in the idea of :EIades. At first only chiefs and leaders had souls and these are invoked along with the SU)1 and moon as in the worship of aneestors. As long as their favor eould be tought deities had, of eourse, no moral eharaetel . As hospitalits, agriculture, eommereial and family life, eon- eeptions of regularity in nature, ete., were developed the gods eeased to be awe or fear-inspiring (unheimisch) and influeneed more direetly the life men. Religion now began to grow in importanee with the worth of the mora1 life. The lowest form of propheey is the interpretatzon of signs. Faith is the child of the wish; then an audible voiee must speak from the elouds; then men are inspired by a daimon, nvhich is the inner oracle of collviction beloxv distinct eonseiousness. 1'hey are sudderlly and perhaps violently possessed by ideas, which wrap them in a dream revery or vision, so ne^r aIld so absorbing that the poet or rnusiciarl dare not elaim his work as his own. They did not kllow the inner proce3s but were sure of its reslllts, alld thus inspiration +^Tas the best forn which creative genius kneu1 to give itself. From thc above principles of its growth we may infer why religion sometimes became largelypolitical as amon the Jews; whyancient systems lay great weight upon the cultus or ssorship and modern u^)on dogulatie orthodosies; why re]igions must change; why the tension between the old and the new is proportional to the rapidity of this change, why a11 that cannot be harrx}onized to the new standpoilts shouldz as Schleiermacher said, be allowed to lapse from the Christi.tn consciousness and above a]l vre can see that as we shollld not studs the Bible to know what Jesus believed but svhat we must,-so the worth of religion does not depend on how it orifflinatertl but on what it does just as the dignity of mall and of science are not irnpaired by the conviction that one was developed froIn the ape and the other from astrology, al- chemy, etc., or as the cogency of a man's logic is not prejudiced bv the fact that a few decades ago we could use only baby-language. Not the first form but the historic principle is the esselltial thing. No man loses esteenl for the Gerrman people of today by readin Tacitus or studying the life of the mediaeval Teutonic tribes. A poetic race +s ill emphasize the mythological element, a speclllative people the dogmatic and a practical the active sicle of religious life, but Schleiermacher vas right in seeking a deoper eommon prillciple lVe must always reason from srhat the religious eonsciouslless says to srllat it means.

It rests upon and is determined bnr the needs of soeial and individual life and especial- ly of the (Vem?ith. Its cultus is the natural expression of a natural feel- ing and must evoke vworthv frames of mind and all noble resolves Does it bring joy and certainty into the life of the souI, does it increase the sense of personal happiness, rest, peaee? ete., and not does it make us work sueeessfully for the rewards of a future pay-day, are the ques- tions? Call we dispellse with the sense of our universal relationship and give up the postulate of the search for a unity of all things? In his religious views Zeller has been greatly influenced by Schleier- maeher whorn he very justly terms "the greatest of all protestant theo- logians," a many-sided, Platonie mind, a true ethieal genius who nzust preaeh" and \NthO i8 best vluderstood not by his avowed pupils but by those who, refuting his letter by his spirit, hi3 later by his earlier works, have passed beyond his standpoint. ais great objeet was to mediate between supernatulalism and rationalism, mystieism and em- p&lt;X-rieismz docetism and ebionetism, manicheism and pelagianism to test the true value of a11 knou ledge by the religious eonseiousness. to bring the eulture of his tinle bacl; to piety. 1n his earlier writings Sehleiermacher argued that seIipture beeame Bible solely by foree of its own innvard ezeellenee, bs the natural law of survival, in short that ehristianity does not insist upon being the only form of religion. but w-ould prefer at any time to yield to a better should it appear. Not only all dogma but even Jesus himself, to whose person he attaehed such eentral importance later, but who nelrer elaimed to be the ouly mediator, sere not inclispensable to the Christianity characterized in the religious Rezlen. His philosophy was always for the sake of his theol- ogy of which it +=as ouly a broadeI forin. God and the world, he savs are different expl essiolls for the sallle worth each ullthinkabIe without the other. Gotl is the esXsence of the world andnot a ^ill overit* hence there is no di Serenee between Eis +s ill and knowledge, between the pos- sible and actual, betsveen ability to do and performance. As providence is the law of nature, thele can be no oliracles, no origin of the world, no physical answers to pra) cr. Personal life is not the essence of the soul, hut its phenomena, and the im}erfectioll of the inf1ividtla1 is but a part of the perfection of the whole. In short Spinozism is softened and idealized. Correspondin, to Want's di3tinction between the sensory and the un- derstanding, Schleiernacher distinguishes the organie from the intellec- tual fulctiont the former as nlaterial and manifold. the latter as unify- ing, and each malwing and needing the other. All expeliellee impels us to God, whom nevel theless u-e cannot know; ,tet he does not infer God to be unknowable like Want's thing perset from t}e antithesi3 of our faeulties but because the nature of the ideas gisren in experienee does not correspond to the God-idea which latter he thus illogically Zeller thinks presuppose3. Our will he says fluetuates but sse vainly seek for th;? grouncl of will; rhile for Kant it is the X-ill mrhich first opens the illtelleetual nTorld. The deepest problem-the relatic)n between will alld being-is found ill personal;y, which is the appearance of the in- finite spirit, aud is the conlpendiurll of the universe. It must be de- velopeel to the fullest individuality between v.hich and general la s there is no confliet. This noble romanticism by sshich he strives to unite earnestness and scientific breadth and to reselle the abstraet mor- als of Want aud Fichte from their subjectivity, nzakes our inmost nature the picture of the iufinite and personality the organ of knowing it. Here God and every moral principle is revealed. the knowledge of which we must work out into ever purer forms. Thus religion is feeling. Pere and perfect self-feeling, hoNever would be a knowledge of God</page><page sequence="5">160 PSYCHOLOGICAL LITER ^ TURE. without the M orld, which is impossible because the God idea can never be freed from antithesis. But conception also gives a notion of God, hence religion is not over philosophy, and while the former should be universal, reason and criticism are also allowed free scope. Over against an absolute pomrer and causa]ity no feeling but that of dependence, or of being determined, is possible. This form of feeling is originally given with personality, before all self-activity. We dare not say that we know its source, as substance or otherwise, hence there is no God-idea, save the vague whence of the feeling of absolute depend- ence, and all attempts to personif.y God are gratuitous. Religion origi- nates naturally in us, but we must actively develop it, and it remains ever imperfect; hence there are always parts of sin as well as of grace in us. The former preceding the latter, as the life of sense precedes the life of nliIld. Because as feeling, it is the most individual religious life most needs enlargement in companionship. It is aroused by inter- course and needs conlmunity. This is the basis of the church. Every experience or representation of the individual life by word or act, which arouses others to responsively produce the same state in themselves, is revelation. This is best seen in the expressive individuality of a rela- tivelJr perfect type, and others are aroused to discipleship. So far Zeller essentially agrees with his teacher; but when the latter proceeds to make Jesus typically perfect (urbildlich) as a historical person by virtue of his special religion or God-consciousness, Zeller objects that Schleiermacher failed to prove the latter, and that Jesus in wno authentic passage claims typical perfection. Jesus may be a perfect man, but he is not thus proven a God-man, and as such neither hi3 per- son nor the dogmatic deduction from it are natural. With surprising critical freedom Schleiermacher, in the matured form of his system, urges that a11 Christ S acts and words merely reveal his personality and so far as this creates or waliens my religious life, or in other lvords makes grace outweigh sin in tne, he may be called mJr redeemer. There is absolutely no substitute or proxy bearing of the penalty of sin. The church visible and invisible, ol actual and ideal or typical simply aids men to reproduce the image of Christ, as a norm ill their own lives. Thus in esslaining the creative beginning of moral life in Jesus and the chllrch according to profound and more or less intelligible psychologic laws, in exploring the essence of religion, and in transforming its tradi- tions to the spirit of our times, in giving esen theoloory a new ground in modern consciousness, and in deriving a11 from self-consciousness. Schleiermacher s work is incomparable and imperishable. But shen, as dogmatist, he treats the gospels, and even John before all, as historical and labors with such painful illgelouitv to pour his new wine into the old vessels which Strauss and Baur s ere so soon alld so easilsr to shatter, he was not only inconsistent with the freedom of his own earlier posi- tion, but brought long discredit upon his religious philosophy, the most profound and quickelling iIl modern thought. Zeller s attitude to Schleiermacher is thus sorLlewhat analagous to that of J. S. Alill to Comte. While reproducing and developing the spirit of his earlier best period vvrith ripened and condensed vigor, he rejects the tortuous scholasticism of his dogmatic and esegetical [accordirlg to Darner his best and most maturedl systematizing, as worthless. Religion is well (lalled a feel- ing but to describe its content as one of absolute dependellce is inade- quate or at least misleading. It is as svell the consciousness of absolute freedom in a pregnant Hegelian sense. No matter how philosophic the concel)tion of fatalism may be made, it must ever be prejudicial to moral accountability. In discussing the teleological and mechallical explanation of nature, vvhich is perhaps the most fundaluelltal question of religious philosophy Zeller urges that it is equal]y senseless and tasteless to conceive animals</page><page sequence="6">161 PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE. as maehines, the world as a huge time-piece, the mind as a body, attrac- tion as caused by hooked atoms or to banis}l all notion of final causes as barren vestals on the one hand, and to explain trifles teleologically on the other. Neither can he agree with Plato and Aristotle that nature is to be e2rplained in part mechanically and in part teleologically, nor wfith Leibnitz that the world as a whole is teleological alld single phenomena mechanical. VVhile the latter satisfies science it grants too much to metaphysics. All possible vorlds had no struggle tor e2ristenee in Gods mind, but the nyorld as it is is the only possible form of its revelation, and is hence necessary. ln a perfect nature the divine will and ability coincide with action. The world has no beginning or end in time. It was never without life and reason in some form. Because necessity is perfect and absolute it must be best conceived as imminently teleolog- ical. and the antithesis between the two applies only to its elements and llot to the world as a whole. The need of the latter is only felt after man's acts have become plan-full, and if granted would require an infi- nite series of reasons, which at bottom would be, like the conclusions from logical premises, rather more mechanical than otherwise. Before matter, as sl)ace filling, moving etc., can become an adequate logical cause of all things it must be collceived in a radically new way, while teleology is at most only one heuristic presupposition, and not a scien- tifically-grounded constitutive principle. The development of monotheism Zeller considers as the most impor- tant of moral-theoretical problems, and among the Greeks the most gift- ed of all races, it is especially suggestive. 'l'he poesy of Homer and Hesiod depicts Zeus, the God-killg, as subject to fate, surroullded by a turbulent and tricky aristocracy of deities, and although the protector of rights, as yet possessing Ilo ver^s moral character. His rule is far mild- er than that in the shadowy old dispensatiou of the Euminides. The poets were the first theologians, and it was thev who reformed the cru- dities of the the early faith. Pililosophy did not grow up, as since the christian era, in the serviee of theolooy. Xenophanes contributed the first monotheistic conception in de3criting men alld gods as having one origin, and the Infinite One as being all eye, ear, thought, etc. From his keen irony e. y. in saying the Thracian gods have blue eyes and red hair, and that horses and osen could they thirlk and speak, would have quadruped gods like themselves, anthropomorphic polsrtheism never entirely recovered. The teachings of the sophists, which pervaded all ranks of society-that we cannc)t tell whether the gods exist or not, that religion was the invention of shrewd legislators who sought in an appeal to fear the strongest sanction for their laws, or that the Gods represent those natural objects found to be the mcest useful, was fol- lossed br Socrates' conception of a unitary plan in nature and au all wise and good principle over-ruling all things. Yet he was by no nleans hostile to the popular religion, but believed in many Gods, who do all for the good of man, who must submit to and obev them, but also in a world-forming reason over a11. The Eleatics believed in one only God not in humau form; the Cynics ridiculed the popular faith the Skeptics declared it not proven, the Epicurians thought chance and necessity ruled the universe and that the gods led a life of placid repose, far off between the worlds alld mrere worthr of unselfish veneration Over Plato's eternal, change]ess, ideal rorld. the Good rules supreme It is the ground of all thouht and heinffl, giving to things reality and to thought truth. It is essential deity, towards ^rhich we strive in every act and thought, yet hard to know. It created and rules the w-orld, is approached by purity of life, is llot jealous of human happi- ne6s, is beyond feeling pleasure or pain in hulnan acts. To this concep- tiOll cllristian theology is immensely indebted. Yet Plato does not give up the idea of other visible gods. Stars, like the world, are incorporate</page><page sequence="7">162 PSYCEOLOGICAL LITERATURE. deities. Men must be trained by mythie lies to later abandon figurate and poetie for true thinking. Aristotle reasserts most of the same notions but aflds that God must be a personal, aetive, first moving eause ete., his providenee itnminent. The Aristotelean eoneeption requires polytheism only for politieal ends. The Stoie pantheism whieh held that ereative fire, reason and lamr eould all be worshipped, also granted that myths were indispensable allegorie representation of eternal elements. But the reaetion of skeptieism whieh, from its extreme distrust of rea- son, eanle to long for revelation and whieh, even among the Jews after the Babylonian exi]e, admitted the doetrine of angels and devils to gratify man's polytheistie eravings, led, among the Greeks, to the no- tion of demons, which were only the old deities of polytheism, as the servants and tools of the supreme being. The eommingling of raees led to the vonception of the later Stoics, that all men are children of the same father, to the belief in the unity of God, and to dissatisfaction with any merely national go(l or messiah. The last stand of polytheism was made in the llew platonic philosophy in its long but ineSective strnggle with christianity. which, refuting its central collception of a desceJld- ing series of beings emanating from the one perfect light, which was at last estinguished in inert matter, adopted it as a form of speculation. Thus, Zeller argues, Greek philosophy prepared the way, though some- what esoterically at first, or Chri3tianity, and sllpplied the elements for lts subsequent rational development to an extent hitherto unsus- peeted. Pythagoras, after premising that the stronger the impression made by any person or event the greater mrill be the Inythopoeie re,aetion, he infers that the sage of hrotona must have been a ulany sided, earnest and sagaeious ethieal reformer. He eame frorn his native Lanos to southern Italy in a time peeuliarly fitted for his work. The eentral doetrine of the society of xvhieh he beeame the eentre was that of future rewards ancl punishments and the transluigration of souls, or that moral purifieation was the hifflhest end of life. 'This and llis aseetieism were perhaps lealned in the orphie mTsteries. He taught mnsie-or the art of tEle muses-alld gymnasties, and that a]l things might be expressed in numerieal relations. His folloszrers refused to eat the heart of ani- mals beeallse it was the seat of life, and svere bllried in linen garments that the suSering of wool-bearing animals might be mitit,ated. 'l'hey held their goods in eonjmon, made fide]ity the chief virtue, and taught that the best should rule. Such are probably tlle facts. AVithin four eenturies after the masters death his folloxvers deseribed him as a proph- et, whose head xvas constantly surrounded by a nimbus, who ealled up storms, healed the insane, arrested plat,ues, ealied down an eagle from the skyz ordered a bear to cease eatillffl flesh and was obeyed, xvas seen at two distinet plaees at the same tillle, vsTas called by name by a river god, remembered his preceding life in whieh he lvas the son of Hermes, as in this of Apollo! heard and taught the harmony of the spheres, hafl made a visit to Hacles, etc. Nearly all distinguished men in Egypt and the east, it was said, had been his teaellers. The older his sehool beeame the more his youn diseiples were able to tell of him. IIe left no writitlgs, but in the first century B. C., many aseribed their writings to him partly as a eomplilnent and partly to win eonsideration for them till several seores of volumes now beal his name. The germ of the Pboman religion he finds in the Latin-Sabine venera- tion of invisible spiritual beings in nature. The solitude of woods, the gurgling of springs, the eracliling of flanles, the gloom of forests, the phenomena of the sky, of growth of the seasons, suggested to the old Romans three classes of natural forces, heavenly, terrestial, and sub- terranean, xvhieh were poetieally personified as gods instead of scien- titieally interpreted. The transiton from a fanciful eoneeption, to a</page><page sequence="8">163 PSYCHOLOGIC A L LITERATURE. matured ethical religion can be nowhere so fully studied as among the Romans, whose fundamental characteristic was awe of unknown forcese and constraiIlt before supernatural influences. IIence their reverenee for tradition their extreme eare not to offend the gods by inauspiciolls chance words, by the neglect of the innumerable formalities which hallowed nearly every act of life. For centuries at first, like the Ger- manic races, the Romans had no or few images of the gods but later there were throngs of protective deities e. g. one for gates, another for hinges, one for doors another for thresholds, or again one for the cry of a new born babe, another for the father's acknos^Tledgement of it, a god- dess of the cradle, another who presided over the ceremony of naming another was protectress from ^itches. There was one eaeh for the child's food and drink, one which brought it from the cradle to the bed. Sacrifice was made to appropriate deities respeetively that the boy's bones might grow lightly, when he first stood, ^alked, went to and calne frorn school, to others that he might reckon, sing, be strong in body and in mincl, etc. In the third and foulth century B. C., the influence of the religions of the north and south, especially that of Greece, began to be felt. First the mythology and rites, then the literature and later the Greek philosophy radically changed the popular faith and at last prepared the sv;y for an easy transitioll to christiaIlity. First the shal- low Euhemerus taught that the go(is vere ancestors and Jove was the head of an old regent house. His doctrines lvere long influential. rrhts epicurean deist Lucretius deseribed the world as set free from the heavy oppression of sllperstiLion by philosophy. The Gods lvere far oR and cared not for lmen. They could have no ses or age, the story of Iphigenia was an unmitigated horror. Sc&gt;evola declare(l tnat the relig- ion of the poets was childi3ll and often imllloral and that of the philoso- pher abstruse and powerless, and held that religion was chiefly an art of the statesman, who must and ought to use it for political ezzds. rrhat the powltifex maxtezzss could thus hold dogma as nothing beside religious cultus +^-itl20ut exciting antagonism is significant. Varro, the authoritv for lUOSt modern knonvledge of the religioll of ancient Rome! declared God to be the universe, especially the solll alld reason.

The middle, half-orthodox party, which rested upon Hegel and Sehleiermaeher's attempt to reeoncile reason and faith, and whieh never had any logical basis, was broken up by Strauss, Baur and Feuerbaeh and all its ambitious and domineering or weak and depend- ent members betook themselves to the eonfessional hyper-orthodo2y which was then favored by the reaetionary German eourts, and chureh and state fell largely under the leadership of dogmatie fanaties or im- patient hierarehs. Though nonv a tidal wave of re:letion has strongly set in, the desolation thus wrought in the head and heart may still be seen in the faet that, while other seienees have progressed, theologzsr has been stationary or retrogressive during the last half eenturr. On the one hand are the free religionists in Germany, shallow, tasteless, un- scholarlzsT, without thoroughness or method, negative and eminently un- proeressive, and on the other ultra-orthodoxy of the Hengstenberg type ever elaborating its uneritieal gospel harmonies or an exegesis of the pa- tristic type whieh ean put any meaning into or out of the seripture te2at, and well content with working out praetieal unionistic platforms for evan- gelical co-operation between trivially diverging seets. Both are alike unsuseeptible, he says, to the great pressing needs of scientifie the- ololry, viz., the explanation of relifflion itself rom its pschologie and of Christianity from its historieal grounds. The latter problem is by rlo means finally solved by the 1'ubingen sehool. Baur, its eory- phaeus, held that the last result of the elitieism of the New Testament and other early Christian nvritvrs should and would be a noble and at the same time historieal pieture of Jesus himself. This, however, so far from being given by the negative residual lnethods of Strauss, could only be reaehed after the bias of eaeh evangelist and apochry- phists, the authenticit} of every text, as svell as its historical validity, and every persona], doglnatic or philosophical part irfluence of the age should have been sreifflhed and tested. It was to this, in some sense pre3iwlinary work, which Strallss by destroring the foundation of dog- matie supernaturalism, made possiblel that 13aur xn:winly devoted himself; and the goal rhieh inspired him, but which he did not attain, must be striven for and reaehed by his method if Christian theology is to mairl- tain a respeetable position in the rnodern intelleetual world. Man's de- sire for happiness is oppressed by a sense of his finitudel but the true religious eonseiouslless reveals a higiner arld compensating happiness attained by the eulture of purity of moral disposition. Msn's elevation through the religious consciousuess above the finitude of his llature expressed as poverty of 8pirit, humility, simplieity, unselfishness, arld the inwardness and absoluteness of religious life eharacterized by the doetrine of the fathelhood of God, soluething like this ICaur thought svould be ultimately found to t&gt;e tlle fundamelltal idea of Jesusl eon- eeived with intense reKllistie ethical gellius and made a pressing and practieal question by being boldly and safflaeiously illterpreted as the bottolls meaning of a cotLlillg Mesianie reconstruetion of the Jewish state. In his earlier Hege]ian peliod Baur regarded Christianity as main]y a philosophieal, but later as a purely uloral proble)n. The in- eomparable influenee xvhich Jesus started ill history eonsisted not so ElUth in any novelty of his conceptionsl these are now traeed to earlier sourees; but in the nobility of his eharacter; the force and purity of his personality ^s ere so great that a new moral and religious ty pe of life was inevitable. He ?ras the Messias in his own inspiring sense and not merely elaimed to be. 'rhis, as every sueh coneeption mu3t now bel in the absenee of reliable ol detailed historieal information respeeting Jesus, is as yet too general aIld vagueF and must be on the one hand elab- orated by a sound and lrigorous ethieal philosophy into a wealth of needed molal power too long unutilizedl (somewhat as Pfleidener has sinee at-</page><page sequence="10">PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE. 165 tempted, although the ethical gellius of a Fichte is more adequate to such a work than that of Baur,) and oll the other it must be verified and corrected by a deeper and stricter critico-historical study than even that of the 'rubingen school has made. One of Zeller's best essays is dearoted to a characterization of his teacher, F. C. Baur, who, in his unearentful home-staying llfe, his slow- ly ripenillg nature, his amazing industry and persearerance, in philo- sophicl critical tact and vigor, in the growitzg importance and initiative power of his work, i3 aptly compared with Sant. His temperate mind could hold an important question open for years, sifting and weighing evidence with piety to every suggestion of fact, and so honest snd anima candida so without hyper-self-consciousness that he seemed like the noblest of the old reformers, while his moral sensitiveness was so acute that he was more grieved by lack of thoroughness or truthfulness in the work of his pupils than by the bitterest attacks of his opponents. He lived in and for his work, but could always preach edifyingly to the Gemuth, and his nature was profoundly religious and pastoral. His school, which has revolutionized religious opinions throughout Germa- ny, Holland, Switzerland and even in protestant France, and has found many points of access even to English and American thought, is unlike the liberalism of deists, encyclopedists, etc., Schiller, Strauss and i'euer- bach, in that it was founde(l by professional theologians and by men of deep personal piety. It simply drew conclusions which hovered in the intellectual air and which every one who thought logically must infer It showed the time its own images and in urging that the New Testa ment was not pure history and not supernatural it only applied the crit- ical methods which had almost revolutionized our knowledge of anti- quity and its literature. Every one has smiled over the forcing, tortur- ing and tasteless methods of the old German rationalism which es- plained away the miracle of Cana as a wedding jest, the fiery tongues of pentecost as electricity, the resurrection of Jesus as recovering from a tranee, and declared that Paul at his conversion was blinded by light- ning and was cured by the natural eff8ect of the shock of an old manXs hands, that the fetters were shaken from the hands of Paul and Silas in prison by an earthquake, that Jesus, though seeming to walk, on the water, really walked at its edge on the shore, etc.; in short, that orien- tal imagery and the reference of rnediate natural processes immediately to God, which, though the esorcising supernatural, makes scripture none the less credible, but in an altered sense, even this had its effect upon the then current method of ortlhodox interpretation because it was no less tortuous and taRteless, as is perhaps best seen in the church history of Neander, who, w ithout aballdoning a single miracle or wavering on the doctrine of inspiration, which make3 all Bible criticism impogsible, yet loves to break off the points of the strongest mirac]es and is con- stantly conceding to the rationalistic Illethods, and capitulating to the Zeit-Gfeist, Bruno Baur, who has since declared the Tubingen school too conservative arld apologetic, and been removed from his professorship and who deduced Alessiahship, resurrection aud other evangelical mo- tives from ab;stract dialectic principles ignoring or denying the existence of an historic Jesus. hIarheinike, who made Bible tests into many- sided scholastic formulae, and Goschel, who all but identified philoso- phy and scripture, were alilie unable to see the necessity or accept the results of such minute and painstaking researches as those of Baur. First of all it must be borne in mind that the sense of literary pro- perty during the early Christian centuries was as undeveloped as any socialist could desire. Plato and Xenophanes put their sentences into the mouth of Socrates, [perhaps somewhat as a modern theologian states the true BibEe doctrine, although in quite other than scriptual terms]. To present or develop the views of another, to win attention,</page><page sequence="11">166 PSYCIIOLOGICAL LITERATURE. to produee immediate eff8eet, to seek shelter from eritieism behind a great name, personal modesty, piety to a beloved teaeher to whom now a days a volume would be dedicated-all these motives of apoehryphal fabrieation were so eolutnon that a moralist mu3t be as laive and devoid of historie setlse to raise the seruples of a modeln conscienee here, as to apply the laxvs against stealinffl in a moderll statute book to the eon- stitution of Sparta. 'rhe well proven eases of pseudonymous authorship in aIleient times, many of xvhieh Zeller instaIlces are, estremely numer- ous. BaurXs eollelusion that the gospe]s and the greater number of the epistles are ullauthentie, of later orifflin and tnsinly reeords of violent partisan eontroversies svhieh rent the earlier ChristiaIl party from its beginIling, opetls the most interesting atld classic of all ancient litera- tllre to the use seholars, elevates of and frees the intellectual llfe of the age, to a degree to which only the work of moderll science can be in ally deree compared. [t xvas his speeial endeavor to discover the bias or tendencies of the early Christian writers. 1n an age when men believed what pleased, interested, or edified them, -wheeher that Homer arfflued for the Jewish sabbath, that Orpheus sang of Xbraham, lAloses and the ten eommandments, or that an old or hardened heathell was eonverted by a relie stealthily laid under his pillow by night, in ehiliasm, or that now recorAs of the life of Jesus written by apostles were suddenly dis- covered at opportune polemic moment3, and when credentials and criti- cism were all but unknown, the chief task of the historian is to seek alld define the tides of party feeliug and prejudices, the currents of men's wishes, ambitions and hopes, and occasionallv political relations and the ground traits of individual character. These ^rith traditions and sagas as material for a mythopoeic fantasv in a most agitated age of persecution and millenial expectations must be controlled before ob- jective history can be reconstructed. It was hard for the personal disciples of Jesus and the Elionite party gathered about them to uphold his tenets against the dominant Phar- asaic sect after their leader had been esecuted as a seditious agitator but it was still harder for them to see Paul, who had never known Jesus personally, so successfully propagating his teachings, as not only inde- pendent of, but tactually irreconcilable with Judaism, among Gentile races and even declarirg that by it Jews were freedfrom their own laws. The conservative wing of the early Christian party, which held that Jesus could be the Messiah of the Jews only, and that the mosaic rites and laws were still binding as a propa3deutic of Christian- ity, regarded Paul as an interloper who really designed to use the large collectlons he was making ostensibly for the church at Rome to buy the gift of apostleship. He is again even described as a conjurer who rep- resented himself inspired till Peter e2mposed him. To define and defend his universalistic view, viz., that Christianity simply set men in right relations to God, Paul composed the letters to the Galatians, the Corinthians and e3pecially thas to the promising and hitherto neutral church at Rome. Meanwhile hard pressed and perple2red bythe vast di.screpancy between the actual low-born Jesus and the splendors of the Messianic kingdotn of popular and patriotic hopes, the disciples had come to expect that he would appear again-an event by no means unparalleled in Jewish storv and inaugurate a new kingdom of inde- scribable magnificence. S5ero, the anti-Christ too, it was rumored was not dead but had escaped and would come again with oriental armies and new wars and persecutions would most severely test the fidelity of the faithful. In this condition of things the book of revelations was written by John as a manifesto before its decisive struggle after which the millenial new Jerusalem, with Jesus as king, would fill the earth. Thus read it is no longer a puzzlinffl riddle-book, but most historical and authentic, in fact the only book in the New Testament written by a</page><page sequence="12">PSYCHOLOGICAL LITER1TURE. 167 apostle-diseiple. The old Israelite expeetations are all to be fulfilled in the wonder world of the re-appearitzg lWessiah. 'lhose N-ho elaim to be apostles butare not, together with the hated doetrines of the Nieolai- tanss-bitter allusions to Paul and his teachiIlgs- are to have no plaee in the new theoeraev, with its walls of jasper, its streets of gold and its tree of life. Thus too the most phantasmagorial dream of Jewish patriotism is suecessfully usedl to save the forlorn hope of a leaderless and losing eause. The eolltroversy between the Pauline and the Jew- ish Christians was long and bitter, and colors, if it clid inspire, most of the books of the ne+^T testament. The twelve apo6tles are paralleled, by the sevellty eo-workers of Paul. The Petrine party elaborated the SamaritanX Judean, the Pauline, the Galilean aetivity of Jesus. Peter is even represented as the founder of the first heathen chureh at Anti- och, and is made to go to Rome beeause Paul had been there. James repudiates Paul's doetrine of j ustifieation bv faithX urges that even devils may belies-e, and represents Jesus, peIhaps his brother, as an aseetie Essene with loll hair, and as abstainirlg from flesh and nvine. In a word, Paulinism, ^shich dispensed with offerings and with eireum- eision, and denied that the only way to the new faith was through Juda- ism, stands for the freedom of wisdoln and mature znanhood while the Jewish Christians argued for a status and moral regimen of adoleseenee Meanwhile both parties were perseeuted alikeX both were represented in nearly every ehurch, praetieal, administrative, unity beeame more essential as the ehureh began its immense organization, while old pas- .sions and prejudiees only faintly survived in a new generation. In the seeond eentury a coneiliatory desire to save the effeets of the +zEork of both wings is maIlifest by aeeommodating, and often even transforming their destruetive tenets. Thus Aets written in the seeoncl eentury and based perhaps on notesof Pauls traveling eompaIlion, and Luke, though both written with unmistakable Pauline drift are very eoneiliatory, Colossians ends with eomplimentary mention of a list of Petrine worthies, while like Ephesians its Paulinism is very tempered. The first epistle of Peter nnakes surprising eoneessions to Paulinism. On the one hand it was apparently granted that Paul was too intrieate and speeulative, and that faith alone was not enough for salvation and on the other it was neeessarily aeknowledged that the wall of partition, between Jews and Gentiles was broken down in faet, and the vast num- bel of non-Jewish Christians were taken into fellowship. Theneeforth all traces of primitive discord were carefully scored away, and the energies of the church were free for the work of practical and dogmatic development and defense. As the church grew, all parties united to elevate the conception of the person of Christ still higher, a convenient point for dogmatic unity in zeal for which old discords might be for- gottens until at last even the Messiah idea with which it had become identified in the first century was not exalted enough for the head of a church that had its stronghold in the capital city of the world, and was destined to become universal, and of a hierarchy so rapidly growing in influence and self-conscious dignity. The son of David gradually be- came with the growing influence of the ultra-Pauline Gentile eleTnent and the Alexandrian gnostic-philosophy not merely the heavenly pneu- matic man, the new Adam, but the pre-esistent, creative Word. The gospel of John, (A. D. 170-180) which is not historical, but lepresents the maturest and best points of the work and teaching of Christianitv up to the period of its composition, which quietly appropriates the service- able elements of the dangerous heresies of gnosticism and montanism and shows no trace of heirarchism in the church, marks the point where the history of primitive Christianity ends and that of catholicism begins. The charm of the Johannean inzage of Jesus, so pure, so exalted and almost femininely delicate, so harmonious that his inward peace was</page><page sequence="13">168 PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE. undisturbed by conflict and sorrow, and so free from all earthlv limita- tions is unprecedented among all ideal personalities hitherto offered to human contemplation. The Johannean gospel not only reconstructed the previous Christian history from its new and tranquil stand-point, but represents the highest theological development of the first period of Christian history. In an essay entitled Greek and Roman Prejudices against Christ- ianity, Zeller shows that while the reige of Alexander and the Roman Empire had prepared the way for the outward spread of Christianity, the popular Stoic philosophy, uThich taught that all men were brothers with equal rights aud duties, and subject to the same moral law, which instead of faith made ethical temper the saving prin- ciple and divided mankind into two great classes, the fools and the wise, instead of the redeemed and the lost, and which longed for the" birth- day of eternity, " an entrance into the i' great eternal peace," prepared the mental soil for the reception of Christian doctrine. The popular heathen notion was that the Christians, if not all Syrian barbarians, were yet atheists, criminals, who perhaps cooked and ate children, prayed to a God with an ass' head, were the worst and most unpatriotic citizens, and in fact enemies of the human race, so that Nero found no difficulty in circulating the report that it was they who had fired Rome. Pliny thought their creed in itself a harmless superstition, but believed their stiS-rLeckedness in refusing to adore images of the Gods and the Emper- or, and in violating the laws against malging proselytes should be punished. rlahe mild M. Aureleus persecuted them because he deemed the pertinacity of their creed,-so unlike his all sided toleration and un- critical eclecticism, dangerous to the dicipline of the state. Lucian said the sect was composed of pitiable and deluded disciples of an arch soph- ist. The platonic Celsus argued that Jesus had stolen and disturbed philosophic doctrines which he could not understand, was of dishonor- able birth, and a conjurer. Greek joyousness and Roman pride had only contempt for a religion designed for the sorrowing, oppressed, weak and guilty. The Neoplatonists revered Jesus, but one inquired lilie Reimarus, why, if salvation was through him, he appeared so late and urged that if Peter and Paul could disagree about fundamentai tenets his doctrine must be very uncertain, another thought Jesus did too few miracles to be really a god and proved that Apollonius did far more, while Julian, believing it was impossible for all men to have the same religion, argued that all noble men and great deeds in the world had come from heathendom and forbade Christlans to teach the ancient literature. In the saga of Peter as Roman Bishop the ultra ebionite view of Paul which described him under the name of Simon the gnostic Samaritan sorcerer, who, after he had been exposed by Peter in Palestine came to Rome, where, by his arts and by the aid of demons, he had won great honors and many followers, is the ground motive. Later when Romish canonists sought to derive the power of the popes directly through Peter it is said that the latter followed Simon to Rome. The Jewish legend dishonored Paul svhom the catholic party would honor, hence he is now distinguished from his double and made to join Peter in opposing Simon, and both Paul ard Peter it was said died in Rome. Later Peter alone is made the first Bishop of Rome and thus the great- est work of Paul's life is accredited to the hostile apostle of the circum- * @ clslon. Much importance is ascribed to Schwegler's work on Montanism and the Post-apostolic age wherein it is concluded that Christianity assumed at first to be nothing but a more complete form of essenic Judaism, and that the autonomy and universality which Paul attempted to give it, transformed and dejudaized it materially le3s than had been gener- ally supposed.</page><page sequence="14">169 PSYClIOLOGICAL LITERA1'URE. In the Platonic republic Zeller sees not only a significant ideal and prophecy impossible of realization, despite Plato's unreserved belief in it, and not only a product of the time, vvhen, after the Pelloponnesian svar, thedangers of individualism, the greed of riches and party strife seemed to show that men could not be trusted with their own develop- ment, but especially a type of society which has been no less than a germ for the organization of the rnediaeval church. Instead of the philosophers who were to rule absolutely in the Platonic republic, are the priests, instead of the warrior cast, the temporal powers, instead of corilmunity of goods which was an ear]y Christian ideal voluntary pov- erty of goods or of spirit and the mendicant orders. Community of wieres, which was recommended to restrain not to satisfy desire, is par- alle]ed by celibacy that monks may live all for the church. Both the ideal and the actualized system rest upon ethical dualism and teach that suffering here will be compensated in a future life and both assert a divine leadership of the state. The republic, like the kingdom of God, is an institution for training men in virtue. The church on the other hand does not so absolutely subordinate the individual to the commu- nity and the spirit of universal fraternity is widely contrasted with the casts and the national exclusiveness of the republic. While Plato would class modern theology, so far as it does IlOt coincide with philos- ophy as mythology, and would be able to find in modern universities no suitable philosophers for rulers, and would be incensed at the modern political romances, wherein private interest is satisfied instead of anni- hilated, he must nevertheless be counted as one of the most important predecessors of organized Christianity. Much space is devoted to show that this was not the result of mere analogy but was history and that Plato's conception, at first too spiritualistic to be popular, had passed into the general culture of the day. Cl'his matured and moderated digest of the Tubingen school so briefly and imperfectly epitomized and digested abovet records, we believe, the most iruportant achievement of the historic critical methed. It aXords the geueral terms of a suggestive and edifying solution of the most intricate and also the most obscured of all historical problems,- a prohlern not of one sect and race or century. but of commingled na- tionl]ities of contending political and philosophica], religious, partisan and personal interests. The facts were so inaccessible and so meta- morphosed in this long contest, that ouly the most patient and consci- entious rescarch coupled with amazing psychologic insight and tact was able to reconstrue t them at last after ages of misconception, with so high a degree of verisimilitude that the most distinguished of Ro- mall historians, whose essential impartiality cannot be denied, declared that several years ago no (;erman scholar under forty-five had thorough- ly studied the Tiibingen writers without being in the maill convinced by them. There will long be many to fear that moral restraints may be practically weakened if scripture is proven uninspired in the old sense, or if miracles are disallowed, just as the Emperor Julian feared that classical literature would be ignored and perhaps lost if faith in the ancient gods was destroyed. This is, without doubt, sometimes the case among the young and the undiscriminating. But on the other hand it is only thus now made possible for men of thorough modern culture and moral self-respect to call themselves Christians if they will, and to be so in mind and heart in a sense deeper and larger than many conventional churchmen comprehend, and even if they seeflt andhopeful occasion, to urge friendly even though misconstrued aid in ameliorating the nar- row severity in faith and life, and in sustaining and reforming church organization, as a right by no means invalidated by stricter modern definitions of the Christian name but rather new vested by the supreme sanction of a positive and adult moral understanding. lEyth is a deeper 11</page><page sequence="15">170 PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE. and broader expression of humanity's common nature and needs than reason itself has yet attairsed. It is never the utterance of the mere in- dividual, but is the toyos, or over-soul of the half-unconscious moral instinct of a race or an age. It is never bound too closely to details of place or time. These only hinder or elnbarass its rare and strange mov- ing and edifying power. In its noblest scriptural form,-Biblic2w1 in the classic sense wherever found-it comes most clearly and directly home to the Gemibth, takes men out of their own selfish personal lives, and raises, purifies and broadens their motives and feelings an-d purposes, as nothing else does. How to make it most effective for good is a problem which homiletic art has perhaps not 5 et finally solved. tthe " Tubingen men " in Germany have grown now inactive and ret- roapective, and even Zeller is somewhat prolis and boastful in his re- capitulations, and a et not only is their criti( al work incorLlplete, but its practical deductions, (the last consideratioll of a German savant) be- cause left to be drawn in a negative, popular and superficial way, have been often sadly injurious instead of most helpful as they should be to the cause of religion and morality, and the German eapital hasgrown perhaps more unconscious of the existence of religion anal its institu- tions than any city in Christendom. Far from assenting to any ultra theories as e. g. that of Rothe-that the moderll state more than the church expresses the essence of Christiatlity, we canllot deny that the latter has grown far too consubstantial with our s(cial, moral, intellec- tual and sesthetio life and development to be eradicated by any violtence, or even to be inteJlectually distinguished and traced through all the long and subtle associations, by whic}l it has become ingrained in our inmost paychic character. By being proven the oldest of all historic categories, and rooted in the earliest written records, instead of a super- natural graft upon an old and decayillg trunk, it challenges the rever- ence of science itself aa the most inlportant problem of popular (Volker) psychology, by contributing to the experimental solution of which all known civili7ed races and agea have become in a noble philosophic sense organically united. As the modern musical scale, and the masterpieces composed in it are not endangered by the proof of its luathemtltital in- accuracy, ita rude empirical origin, or by the suggestions of improve- ment, as the nsodern state is not lost to socialislll by the demonstration that all values originated in the ten fingers of the working man, or that the rights of bequest and of absolute private ownership are, so to speak recent habits, resting upon a series of accidents and misconceptions, so the Christian church is by no means essentially or permanently weak- ened by being compelled to relinquish its beliet in miracles, inspiration and an incarnate deity for more historical conceptions of its origin. It is only another reformation that impends, as radical, possibly, to the more assumptive and unreasoning of modern Pharisees as was the new dispensation of Jesus itself, but only salutary to every true religious interest. A brief notice of some of Zeller's less important essays nvill perhaps convey a better idea of the range and minuteness of his learning and of the acuteness of his critical power. In his defence of Xanthippe he re- minda us that the young wife of an old man who could hurnorously boast of the advantage of ugliness like his over the classic Greek type of beauty, that the bridge of his nose was low, that with one of his prom- inent eyes he could look directly into the other, his mouth so large that he could save much time by eating faster than others, and his lips so thick and soft that he could give and receive the sweetest kisses, and whose ponderous body was the type of Silenus, might be excused for not being proud of the most monstrous among all the handsome Greeks for a husband. lW:oreover he would seek no office, lounged all day on the streets and in the public marts talking with tailor, shoemaker and</page><page sequence="16">PHYCEOLOGICAL LITERATURE. t71 even heterai about the dialectic conception of their profession, and al- though so poor that wife and husband had but one outer garment be- tween them so that one must stay at home when the other was out, would sometimes stand all day in one spot lost in reverJr, ridiculed by boys and comedians, and at last come home, old and fat as he was, to practice a dancizlg lesson for which, perhaps, he had paid his last heller. Moreover the suspieion that he had married her as a discipline in pa- tience would brdly havse been delicate and flattering to a woman's nature. Wthen she came sobbing with a child in her arlus to see him for the last time in prison before the fatal draught of hemlock, and severely looking at her he ordered Krito to take her home, and when she had been removed sereaming, he calmly began a philosopllic discourse. 1t08- sibly Xanthippe threw dirty water upon hims attempted to tear off his garments in the market plate, overthrew his table aud trod upon a cake that had just been sent in, no one kllows fron whom and perhaps Soc- crates consoleA himself that she never kicked or bit hitu, but more probably these are ullsalLed invelJtions of lively Greek gossips or chron- icles to make the name of Socrates brighter by contrast. She was probably no worse than many a modeln woman would have been with her provocatioll. Very readable is his characterization of Alexander the Paphlagonian imposter and Peregrinus the enthusiast. 'rhe former was famou3 for his beauty, and lived in the time of Traj.an. Planlling to found a nes oracle at Abonuteichas, he buried anA caused to be found, brazen tab- lets announcirlg that Askulepios alld his father Apollo were about to re move thither, caustd it to be announced that he was the grandson of the former, and later appeared himself in purple with the sword of Per- seus in a feigned exstat y and wit h artiAcial foam flowing from his mouth. 'l'hrowing aside all his garments he showed the assembled multitude a young sert)erlt in a broken egg shells and a few days later an immense artificial snake ^!ith a hurnan face, with eyes and mouth worked by in- visible hairs, which he declared had grown from the little one and uas a llesv Gofl, Elz-con, and from lvhom he mtould receive divine messages. Sealed letters were sent, and if they could be operled and sealed without suspicion were rcturned with answers written beneath every question. He hired a claque in distant cities and finally in Rome who reported the most astonishing llliracles hidden treasllres and thieves discovered, the sick healed and even the {lead raised. Messengers were bribed, difflcult questions generously referred to the priests of other oracles, until at last Rutilinus, a man of high standillg in the Ron2an court, like another Zollner, fell coulpletely irlto his net, and he became the fashion in the imperial city to which he graciously officred his protection against pest, conflngl ation and earthquake. He became immenselv rich and made it dangerous for rationalistic epicurearas or for Chri3tians to attempt to exl)ose him, and died at the age of seventy with undiminished fame. Peregrinus of Pazium gave his fortune to his townsmen and traveled in the east where he learned the " rare wisdom " of the Christians who, it was said m lde him a bishop. LateJ he appeared in P&gt;ome as a cynic, anathematizing all the urorld, and especially the Roman emperor Anto- nius Pius, wh-o banished hiln from the city imits, beyond which he lived in a hut alld attracted lllany y-oung men by his philosophical dis- courses.

In " A Strike in Rolne " Zeller discllsses the variously recorded story of the origin of the llomaI] festival quinguatrus. 'The pipers, it is said, vexed by eertain resErictions of their prerogatives, withdren to a man to 'ribur and occasioned thereby great distress in Rome. 'l'here could be no festive sacrifices to the gods, no religious processions, no mar- riages, no burials. l'he senate in Vaill tried to indllce the irate musicians to return, and only after they had been rnade drunk at a feast given in Tibur and brought hoane ill wagons did they eonsent, if all their aneient rites were restored, to resulue their duties as before. 'This i8 eompared with the legend of tlle origin of festivals of cazmenta. rrhe Roman matrons of old had the right to ride in carriages, of which they were deprixed by the senate. They all s^Tore to beal no llloIe childreen till the privilege was restored, which the senate hastelled to do. Both these tales, the lormer of which has l)een hitherto 1lndoubted, Zeller argues xvith great ingenuity are instances of the 3etiologica1 sagas so eornlnon among the Romans and uttelly without historical foundation. In characterizing Fichte as a politician we are told that he possessed the very rare eombination of great scientific aculnen alld clllture, with imrnense vigor and sensitiveness of moral charaeter. lt was the sub- stance of his philosophy that the will of the individual created not only his own charactel, but his own world, and that individllal action anll development might bc free and unhindered, was the ground motive of his life. The trtle state itself is only a three-fold compact of the sov- erigrl people who call therefore never rebel. Its business is solely to protect men ill their rights. 'rO this end they must oversee all depflrt- ments of work in every detail, and cause every one to be remunerated according to his services. 'llhis view has nnade him a favorite with the modern socialists. It alone controls intercourse with foreigrl st2wtes and its citizens should have otlly its money and nevel that of other countriesg So long as the state is anfi thing other t}an tlle spontaneous organization of the people, the latter are not free. An absolutely iree people wou]d need no state. 'l'he fate of the true culture of freecloto rests Wit]l regener- ated Germany.

His philosophy and his political theories, it is concluded, are both superceded by later and better views, but will yet long remain, even where most coutrXldicte(l, very illstructive and elevating. In XVolff's expulsionfromHalle*Zeller sees the pure epitome of a con- test which is not yet ended. At the close of the thirty years war Ger- many had grown barbarous, ignorant, schismatie, sensuous in taste alld life to a degree which German patriotism now iinds it hard to aclmit. Protestantism had fallen into the hands of rnen ssrhose rule was searcely less fruitless, forlllal and unproglessive than that of tlle Tesllits then dominant in the catholie ehurcll. It had no underst.luding of the reli- gious needs of the people aIld hatl driven edification frorl the church, learning from the sehools, and freedom and thoroughtless frorn the uni- versities and from literature. At this period pietisln and philosophy first took their lise in Germany.

WolfE, whose methods affected mathematical form and certainty, who used the ver- nacular tongue in his thronged philosopllieal lecture room, who had arsued that even an atheist might lead a moral life, and that if no di- vine reveletion had been made even reason would incline men to virtu- ous lives, was violently attacked by the pietists and obliged to enter intotedious and profitless disputations. He sawhisstudentsandfol- lowers and even his friends gradually alienated from him until at length the king of Prussia, induced by a plulup lie of an enemy of WolS, or- dered him to leave his domains within forty-eight hours on penalty of being hung, and made it a orime to circulate or read his writings. This his pietistic colleagues declared was in answer to their prayers. He was recalled late but not until his vigor and his itldllence were forever impaired. The relatiolls of church and state in the past and present and the dis- cipline, cultus, orders, property and influence on educatioll of the former are discussed from an abstract, moral stand-point in a readable little volume, which space fails us to eI)itomize.

The latter has beetl the aentral question in Gerlnan philosophy since Kallt brought into flu2 the questiotl of the origln and truth of our no- tions of things. Based UpOtl special solutions of it, the great idealistic systems were wrought out. The crJr " hack to Kallt," alld the general abandonment of the foulldations upon which Fichte, Schelling and He- gel built, which ill many quarters has degenerated to all uncritical cul- tus of Kantain orthodoxy was at first m.rtured by the conviction that, he alone had fairly examined and justls estimated the importance of the "theory of knomTledge," while later the experimental psy&lt;hology of the physiologists and the studies of Helnlholts have only tnore special- ly elaborated this theory and more critically anssvered Kants problem. XVe must not infer from the study of Kantl that cxperience can give ?4n- ordered matter, or that all form is illtlate, still less Call we awree with him that because we apprehend tllings by lueans of subjectisTe forlns ve must necessarily be igllorant of things as they are in themselves.

Here at last we glitspse a liluit to Zeller's remarkably wide eritieal horison whieh is particularly mallifest throughout his eourses of psy- ehologieal lectures. 'rhe h-pothesis of a fourth dimension of spaee, in no way destroys the validity of the old geolnetrieal three. Alathemati- eal physies has elaborated equations eontaininffl funetions whieh rnight be true in a spaee of x dimensions atld forthwith metaphysieal psyehol- ogists, reasseltirlg old idealistie traditions, or perhaps too easily bullied bD seientifle authorities, stultify seience by talking of an absolutely spaeeless universe, anl a nnxtended rnatter. To Zeller this is only a logical possibility whieh must not be forgotten. Like many of the older German professors of l)hilosophy he does not deem it all too ullworthy the dignity of his departmellt to interest a eurious elass by reeounting sore of the more striking results and luethods of the physiologieal stllely of sensation, bllt too often ollly to disparage their philosophieal importance an(l to limit to the narrowest the impressions dedueed from them in detail while roundly acknowledging the gerleral importanee of such investigations for the theory of \nowledge. 'rhe fundancetltal importance anfl the immense seope of these, eentering as they do about the transforming psychologieal conception of reflex actiOtl luodified by speeifie nervous funetions and iJIhibition Zeller fails adequately to appree iate. We svill p ruse here only to observe that the srhole dl if t of German physiology i3 now strongly and almost without exeeption agaillst the possibility of such rnaterialistic deduetions as Zeller fears theref'rom. Philosophieal truths to Zeller are not eoins stamped and weighed to pass unchanged from hand to hand, but historieal produets deeply rooted ill personal, national and religious eharacter.
