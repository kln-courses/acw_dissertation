Despite Lord Reid's protestations that it is not the function of the judges ". . . to frame definitions or to lay down hard and fast rules" (p. 681) one cannot but agree with him when he says: " But I suppose that those of us who merely concurred with him [Lord Devlin] ought to have foreseen that this might happen and to have taken steps to prevent it" (p. 682). Despite recent criticisms of assenting judgments (e.g., Blom- Cooper and Drewry, Final Appeal, pp. 90-95) there may be some- thing to be said for his Lordship's espousal of them in cases like Rookes v. Barnard (p. 681; see also his Lordship's speech in Saunders v. Anglia Building Society [1971] A.C. 1004, 1015). I)AVID FLEMING. LOCAL AUTHORITY V. CR1TICAL RATEPAYER-A SU2T IN DEFAMATION IT'S a free country, is it? A man says that hls local council is behaving in a dictatorial and undemocratic manner. He is tried for it, fined £32,000 and threatened with imprisonment if he ever says such a thing again. It couldn't happen? It did happen, in England, in 1972. Or very nearly. Bognor Regis U.D.C. v. Campion [1972] 2 W.L.R. 983 was a private suit in defamation, so it wasn't a prosecution (or there would 02ave been a jury), and it wasn't a fine exactly (or Mr. Campion, who could not give security for costs, would have been able to appeal), and instead of being convicted he will just be bankrupted for damages of £2,000 and costs of perhaps £30,000. Terms and technicalities apart, however, the matter is as stated. In effect it is a gross invasion of civil liberties and in method it is a serious reproach to English law. It may be instruc- tive to consider first the legal result and secondly the factuaI back- ground; this will be at somewhat greater length than is usual in a case-note, for there is not often such a bad case. The narrow legal question- the only point on which the long judgment of Browne J. is reported --was whether a locaI council can sue " in defamation." A Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench in 1891 held that it could not, unless the libel reRected on its property (Manchester Corpn. v. Williams [1891] 1 Q.B. 94) but t}}ree years later the Court of Appeal held that a trading company could sue without proving any loss (South Hetton Coal Co. v. North- Eastern News Association [18941 1 Q.B. 133) and the same has since been held of trade unions (Willis v. Brooks [1947] 1 AII E.R. 191). Browne J. took the later decisions to have eclipsed the earlier one. This is unfortunate because the Court of Appeal was wrong to hold that a trading company could sue"in defamation"; it was</page><page sequence="2">239 C.L.J. Cases and Conzlnent also unnecessary because local authorities are significantly different from trading companiesv We shall take these points in order. But we must first be clear what we are asking when we put the questson " Can thts body sue ' in defamation '? " We are not asking whether that body can obtain compensation for any loss it can prove to have resulted from a false statement improperly made by the defendant. Certainly it mays under the rubric of maliclous falsehood or injurious falsehood or whatever one chooses to call it. We are asking a very different question, namely whether an institution shouId enioy the benefit of all the legal rules offered to the human berng as a protection for his esteem in his own eyes and others'. What are these rules? They are very exceptional in the law of tort. The individual need not prove that any loss resulted from the libeIlous publication; nor need he prove that it was false; all he has to prove is that the defendant criticised him. The defendant, who is liable not only for intentional implications but also for unforeseen and unforeseeable inferences, cannot defend on the ground of " reasonable belief " or " good faith "; for statements of fact he has the complete defence of " truth " and the normally rebuttable defence of " privilege '; for statements of opinion he has the further defence of 4' fair comment," if the matter is one of public interest, provided that he can prove that the underlying facts were as he irnplied or as others might infer. If not right, one is rude at one's peril. Only flattery is safe. Nil Ztisi bonum, except de mortuis. These rules make for a quite remarkable restriction of the freedom to speak and write. How did it come about, and is it now justifiable? In the eighteenth century there were still men of honour, proud of their self-esteem; they would call out the man who spoke out; since a suit was better than a duel, a strong remedy had to be provided, and was. To nineteenth century mans more afraxd of public embarrassment than private shame, what others thought was more important than what he felt; indeed, the former dominated the latter; respectability, the supreme Victorian bourgeois good, had to be well protected, and was. Now that lace curtains have yielded to open-plan, respectabiIity mllst give way to self-expression; nor will the absence of ready law-suits do any harm now, for the cut and thrust will be that of public debate, to t}le general good. So many of the old rules must go. There is still some justification, however, for the rule that the human plaintiff need not prove any harm. If the statement is defa- matory, he will feel bad and others will think badly of him; the first need not be proved and the second cannot be. Indeed, this duality of harm can be presumed precisely because it is required: you get damages only if the defendant has been rude aboat you to</page><page sequence="3">240 [1972A] The Caenbridge Law Journal someone eIse. Thus it was not wholly absurdt though lt was certainly generous, of the jury to giV&amp; £15,000 as compensation to Captain Broomet though hIs pension was not dimin}shed nor his expenditures increased as a result of his being libelled ([1972] 1 All E*R. 80I). On the other hand, it was wholly absurd for the jury to g've £100,000 to Rubber Improvements Ltd., of whom (or, rather, of which-astonishing how anthropomorphic about companies lawyers are) the Daily Mail had saids when the Fraud Squad was probing that firm, "Fraud Squad Probes Firm" ([1964] A.C. 234). It svas absurd because Rubber Improvements Ltd. had no feelings which might have been hurt and no social relations svhich might have been lmpaired. The tsvo kinds of presumptive harm could not be presumed because they couId not have occurred. The only kind of harm that Rubber Improvements Ltd could have suffered was harm to its commercial relations, because that was a11 it had; harm of that sort, had it occurred, couId be proved, and therefore should be proved. But Rubber Improvements Ltd. oSered no proof of loss, because Lord Esher MeR. in the 30uth Hetton Cosl Co. case had said ;4 the law of libel is one and the same as to all plaintiSs." This is quite wrong, because the reasons for which we absolve the human plaintiff from the usual requirement of proving loss cannot and do not apply to the inhuman plaintiS So an inhuman plaintiff should not be permitted to sue for words unless it establishes that they cawsed it harm. Furthermore, if a tradtng company should not be given damages unless it proves Ioss, a fprtiori it should not beneEt from the other, less supportable special rules of the tort of defSmation, and for the same reason: it does not have those interests of the individual which alone might justify the severe restriction of free speech which those ruIes procure. To prefer the interest in maintaining the corporate image to the right of the citizen to say what he reasonably believes to be true is a grim perversion of values. Accordingly the decision in the South Hetton Coal Co. case should be reversed, although the libel bar will be displeased at losing their lovable corporate cIients like Broadway Approvals Ltd. l[l965] 1 W.L.R 805), the more so since hllman plaintiffs cannot obtain legal aid for their expensive services. Browne J was of course bound by the decision of the Court of Appeal that a trading company could sue " in defamation ' just like a human being. But if he could have found a significant difference between the Bognor Regis Urban District Collncil and trading companies or trade unions, he could welI have followed the decision of the Divisional Court which heId that Manchester Corporation could not sue. Now it is true that the Bognor Regis Urban District</page><page sequence="4">C.L.J. Cases and Comment  241 Council is a non-trading corporation, but that is not its leading characteristic; its leading characteristic is that it is a unIt of govern- ment. In other words, it is not just that the Bognor Regis Urban District Council doesn't make prierate profits; it is that the Bognor Regis Urban District Council performs public functions. To put it another way, this was not a mere tort suit but a constitutional law case. We have seen one false step already the analogy between the tradang company and the individual; now we see another-the analogy between the company and the government. In other systems of law a fundamental distinction is drawn between public law and private law. One part deaIs with the rela- tions between government and citIzen while the other deals with the relations between citizens, bt they real or artifi&amp;ial. The distinc- tion is justified because quite diSerent considerations determine what those respective relations should be. English law, despite Lord Bacon, does not like that distinction. Indeed, the Crown Proceedings Act of 1947 expressly assimilates the liability of the Crown to that of a private person (s. 2 (1)). Now this is quite all right so far as it goes, or, more accurately, provided that it does not go too far. The theory that 3ack in office is the same as Jack out of office is splendid in so far as it means that Jack in office should have no special immunities. But in so far as it suggests that Jack in oflice should have no special liabilities and in so far as it suggests that Jack in office should have all the rights he would have outside it the theory ls pernicious. Our case, indeed goes very much further, and hoIds that the ogice itsel has all the rights Jack wouId have outside it: quod absurdum est. Government can properly be put under special liabilities because much is expected of it: government should behave exceptionally well, and be an examp]e to the flock &amp;c. Nor need governments have all the rights of individuals, there are two reasons for this: the first is that governments are not individuals, and the second is that there are some things they, as governmentss should have to put up with One of the things a government should have to put up with is criticism. The only criticism which government may properly repress is criticism which is harrnful to the state or to public orders and the only proper method for such repression is the criminal law. The exclusive use of the criminal law in such cases is safer for the citizen and the citizenry because its use attracts attention by showing that the relations of state arld citizen are in lssuet and its processes contain, for that very reason, many safeguards not found in private law. For example, had Mr. Campion been openly prosecuted instead of being sued in such a sneaky mannerf he would have had a jury, legal aid and the possibilIty of appeal- furthermore, he would not halre been fined £32s000 and, who knows,</page><page sequence="5">242 The Canbridge Law Journal [1972A] the Attorney-General might have intervened to stop the whole nonsense. In brief, the government should not be allowed to bring a private suit " in defamation." But, one may object, the plaintiff here was not the government; the government is in London, not in Bognor Regis. Here we run up against yet another peculiarity of English legal thinking. Exactly as, to our minds, tribunals are not courts just because their members wear no wig, so local councils are not government because they lack the pomp. But if they lack the pomp of government they have its powers legislation (by-laws), taxation (rates) and eminent domain (compulsory purchase); functionally speaking, the Bognor Regis Urban District Council is governmexlt, though doubtless of a very low order. Would one allow a defamation suit brought by the Department of the Environment? If 1lot, and one hopes not, then a local authority must not be permitted to sue. The next questIon is why this local authority did. In the last eighty years many local authorities must have been subjected to unjustifiable criticism, yet no suit in defamation has been brought by a local authority since Manchester tried and failed in 1891. Was the Bognor Regis IJrban District Council unusually sensitiVe Ot was Mr. Campion quite extraordinarily bothersome? Both, it appears. If public exposure makes for sensitivitys the Bognor Regis Urban District Council might well be sensitive. On no less than ninety days between 1964 and 1967 did ItS affairs figure in The Times; twice they were the subject of leading comment. There was comment in the courts too. Salmon L.J., at first instance, in holding that one of the Council's compulsory purchase orders was invalid as being ultra vires, said: " It was an abuse of power and a flagrant invasion of private rights which the council has tried to cover up by means which do them no creditv I confess that I find it most disturbing that a public authority can behave irl such a fashion." Danckwerts L.J., on unsuccessful appealS felt it fairer to ascribe the Council's errors to arrogance and ineptitude rather than bad faith. Not a good press, especially since judges, though immune to actions of libel, are trained to self-restraint. More trouble was to come. Shortly afterwards the Council dismissed its new Clerk who evidently disapproved of the way things were being done. A public inquiry was set up by the Minister of Housing at the Council's request and public expense. The anodyne report of J. Ramsay W;llis, Q.C. (as he then was) gave the Council an acquittal which carries small convic- tson, and ended with the hope that the " unhappy domestic quarrel " should be allowed to be forgotten as soon as possible.</page><page sequence="6">C.L.J. Cases and Comment 243 But Mr. Campion had no intention of allowing the CounciI's misdeeds and misdoings, as he saw thems to be forgotten. He continued to attack on every front sewage disposal, coastal protec- tion works, use of open spaces, slum clearance, the development of Butlin's camp, the low rent charged to Butlin's and others, the undeclared interests of the councillors in matters under debate, the dismissal of the Clerk and the uncooperativeness of the new one. All these are matters of public interest cvery aspect of local govern- ment isven if Mr. Campion was the only member of the public interested in them all. On some matters he was right, on many he was wrong, on all he was extreme. His means of attack varied. He wrote letters in enormous numbers and very disobliging terms to the Clerk, to the councillors, to the Council, to other councIls, and to the press, local and national; he appeared on television to broadcast his criticisms; he distributed leaflets of his own composition to visitors and residents; he promoted investigations through the Director of Public Prosecutions; himself he laid an information against the Clerk; he objected time and time and time again at the annual audit -a right which ratepayers have not yet lost through non-use. Mr. Campion was tireless. And tiresome. Unquestionably he was a very great nuisance. How can government operate if every time they do anything wrong they are pounced on and pilloried with persiflage? How can they do anything at all if, whatever they do, it will be said to be wrong? Nerves were fraying in the Town Hall, on whose steps Mr. Campion once left his dustbins. The war of attrition was telling. So much so that just before Christmas 1968 a councillor, with the immediate approval of nearly all his colleagues, made a long state- ment inveighing against Mr. Campion's activities. This statement (along with an advertisement for Bognor's largest Do-it-Yourself centre) filled the front page of the next issue of the Bognor Regis Post, under the nineteen-millimetre headline " Horrifying, Disturbing and Almost Evil." The very next month Mr. Campion used the very same words in a leaflet he distributed at a ratepayers' meeting. It was because of that publication that the Council sued. Or, rather, it was not because of that publication that the Council sued. The publication was not the reason but the ground. The publication gave the Council an opportunity of suing Mr. Campion because he was a nuisance, though being a nuisance was not, in the circumstances, tortious by itself. They wanted to muzzle him because he barked too much. He was a most vexatious ratepayer and he had to be stopped. It is understandable, people being what they are, that the Council took the opportunity. They svere wrong to do so, however; and it was very wrong that they were permitted to do so</page><page sequence="7">244 The Cambridge Law Journal [1972A] with effect. The idea of suing for defamation must have come readily to the Council, as advised, because the Clerk ha d just collected £2,250 in damages from Mr. Campion for saying that he had suppressed a letter which the clerk had simply not put forward. Now if the Clerk had been so successful on such tenuous grounds, why did not all the councillors personally follow with suits? Well, you see, they were not members of N.A.L.G.O., so they couldn't get support from their union; ands though there was a policy, paid for from the rates, which protected them if a defamation suit were brought against them, that policy wouldn't pay for the costs of an action brought by them; and they couldn't get legal aid because no one can get legal aid for defamation cases. On the other hand, if it was the Council that sued (not on their behalf admittedly that isn't allowed but certainly, if successful, to their benefit) the costs could come from the rate-box; in other svords, the other ratepayers would pay for the suit against Mr. Campion. Very nice: a lawyer's dream, the citizen's nightmare. But we have not yet exhausted the horrifying and dIsturbing aspects of this lamentable affair. For that we must return to Her Majesty's courts. We can leave aside the qualified interlocutory injunction granted by Fisher J., and proceed to the question as to the mode of trial. Either party to a defamation suit may demand trial by jury. He has a right to it, unless " the trial requires . . . prolonged examination of documents . . * which cannot conveniently be made with a jury" (R.S.C., Ord. 33, r. 5), in which case the judge has a dIscretion. The plaintiff asked for trial by judge aIone, but Master Ritchie, on the defendant's asking for trial by jury, ordered that trial be with a jury. Very shortly before the case was to be tried the Collncil, now represented by silk as well as stuff, moved before Milmo J. that the triaI be by judge alone, since there were some letters to be looked at. Mr. Campion, speaking for himself as he did throughout, again demanded trial by jury, but Milmo J. ordered trial by judge alone. This decision is the worst aspect of a very bad case. In interlocutory proceedings especial care shouId be taken to protect the rights of aIl unrepresented party; in constitutional cases, at any rate where the government is attempting to punish and prevent criticism, there should be a jury That was what Fox's L1bel Act was about in 1792, when what the critics wrote svas really strong meat and not the pap which the plaintiS Council was too weak to stomach. Milmo J. should have been more evidently aware of the implications of the case before him for persons other than those, like 02imself, very conversant with the hieratic mysteries of the tort of defamation, as developed. It is not clear that he really had a discretion in the circumstances; and it is quite clear that, if he dld he should not</page><page sequence="8">CI l ,.J . 245 Cases and Comment have exercised it as he did. We are truly in Kafka-country when we find Browne J. saying in his judgment " The Village Hampden is nearly always a popular figure with the public and I am sure that the Courts will always go out of their way to protect his rights." No one else; on the evidence, will be so sllre. Would the Court of Appeal, if appealed to,, have overturned Milmo J.? One hopes so though that court has quite gratuitously tried to dissuade parties to defamation suits from insisting on their rights (Richards v. Naum [1967] 1 Q.B. 620). Nevertheless it would be a difficult thing to uphold a decisIon which actually deprived an unrepresented defendant of such a right in such a case on such a ground. About the trial and the judgment on the merits numerous ques- tions raise themselves which cannot be laid here. How can the libel that the Council " conducted its affairs in a dictatorial and undemo- cratic fashion" possibly be held to be a statement of fact rather than a statement of opinion? Was it not evident, there and then in the court, that Mr. Campion was justified in saying that the Council was trying to repress free speech? If " The Council were entitied to take the view (rightly or wrongly) [sic] . . .' why was Mr. Campion not entitled to take the wrong view, which had commended itself to Salmon L.J.? Why damages of £2,000, I1O more and no less? But this last question is perhaps unfair: if one lets a plaintiff sue although he cannot have suffered any damage whatever sum one gives him is bound to be infinitely too great; still, the South Hetton Coal Co. got only £25 for a charge of inhumanity, so perhaps this case should have been trsed by a Jury after all? Not that the amount of damages matters very much when the plaintiffs have submitted a bill for costs, exclusive of svitnessess expenses, amounting to £34,445s24. One reason for not going into these matters is that the fuIl judgment is not available, but what readers can do is to go to the reports and see what Mr. Campion actually wrote; it is not worth £36,445 24, which is vvhat it may cost hlm. The story is a dismal one. Mr. Campion was perhaps wrong to go on as he did; tlie Council was probably wrong to sue him; Browne J. was wrong to let them do so; and Milmo J. was very wrong to let them do so without a jury. And how will things end? Mr. Campion will be banlcmpted by his local authoritys piously collecting money to reduce the rates (and why not? After all, it was Mr. Campion that the judge found, obiter, to be Inalicious); the Bognor Regis Urban District Council will disappear l after its fluctu- ations it will be merged; and we shall be left with an authority in the books which is fundamentally wrong-wrong in the method and horribly wrong in the result. This decision gaves to units of govern- ment the rightfi at your expense, to put their critics to the private</page><page sequence="9">246 The Cambridge Law Journal [1972A] cost of justifying themselves; much worse, it gives them the power to threaten to do so unless the critics shut up sharpish. Eternal vigilance is not required to prevent such a thing; all that is required is to wake up for half a minute. J. A. Weir.</page></plain_text>
