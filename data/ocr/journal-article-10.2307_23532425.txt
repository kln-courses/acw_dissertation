<plain_text><page sequence="1">REDON S DEBT TO THE CRITICAL ESSAYS OF BAUDELAIRE Lois Boe Hyslop and Francis E. Hyslop* More than any other artist of the post-Baudelairean period, Odilon Redon, draftsman, lithographer, and painter, is closer in spirit—far closer than is gener ally believed—both to the aesthetic ideas and to the practices of the author of Les Fleurs du mal. The critic Emile Hennequin, an intimate friend and one of the few who, in the artist's opinion, really understood the nature of his work, used the same memorable expression that Victor Hugo had applied to Baudelaire's poems in proclaiming that Redon had brought "un nouveau fris son" into the world of the plastic arts: "Autant que Baudelaire, M. Odilon Redon mérite le superbe éloge d'avoir créé un frisson nouveau."1 It was Huysmans, however, who was largely responsible for linking Redon with Baudelaire and Edgar Allan Poe and for insisting that the artist was their rightful heir. His comments, made in critical reviews of 1881 and 1882, and his evocation of Redon's art in his famous novel A rebours did the artist almost as much harm as good. By maintaining that Redon's art was "une véritable transposition d'un art dans un autre," he encouraged the belief that the artist was not only "un peintre littéraire" but also the exponent of Satanism in the plastic arts.2 Yet despite this interpretation of his work—disturbing as it was to Redon—the artist was nevertheless grateful to Huysmans for having brought him from complete obscurity to the attention of a cultivated, but largely uncomprehending public. Other critics, both among Redon's contemporaries and those of today, have likewise noted a close affinity between the ideas and works of artist and poet. At the same time, each generation of critics has interpreted Redon's works somewhat differently. Depending on their optic and on their particular bias, they have classified him as a Decadent, a Wagnerian, a Symbolist, and a Sur realist. Realizing how much his art had been misunderstood, Redon took pains to define his own personal position in writings that constitute an exposé of his aesthetics. An examination of those writings confirms the belief that Redon's practice and theories were, and continued to be, deeply influenced by Baude laire, who today is considered a precursor of the Symbolist movement. 141</page><page sequence="2">142 Nineteenth-Century French Studies Redon's deep and lasting interest in'Baudelaire is evidenced by certain telling facts. In his journal A soi-même, he recounts how a friend, the distin guished botanist Armand Clavaud, a man of remarkable culture and erudition, had introduced him to Baudelaire, Poe, and Flaubert as well as to Shakespeare, Spinoza and Flindu poetry: "Très avisé, il était au courant de tout. Lorsque parurent les premiers livres de Flaubert il me les désignait déjà avec clair voyance. Il me fit lire Edgar Poe et Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du mai, à l'heure même de leur émission."3 Since, as Redon wrote to his friend A. Bonger many years later, he was about twenty years old when he met Clavaud, it was obviously the second edition (1861 ) of Les Fleurs du mai to which he was referring.4 That he also read the third edition (1868) of Les Fleurs du mai is evident from the fact that one of his prints, belonging to the album entitled Les Fleurs du mat, is based on a poem "La Prière d'un païen" found only in that edition. That same year Redon must also have read Les Curiosités (esthétiques, pub lished in 1868, which contained among other essays "Quelques Caricaturistes étrangers" with its praise of Goya and its articulation of aesthetic ideas which, as will be seen, concurred with those of the aspiring young artist.5 There can be no question that Redon recognized much of himself in the poetry of Baudelaire. He too had been the small child who, on the lonely estate of Peyrelebade "played with the wind and talked with the clouds" ("Bénédiction"); he too "understood the language of flowers and of mute things" ("Elévation") and in his dreams traveled beyond "the possible and the known" ("La Voix"). He too had known quiet evenings with the sun illu minating the simple supper table ("Je n'ai pas oublié") and, as a student, both in Bordeaux and in Paris, had experienced the humiliation of being unlike his companions and of encountering the misunderstanding and the derision of both teachers and students ("L'Albatros"). It was soon after meeting Clavaud and after becoming interested in Baude laire that Redon, according to his own admission, found himself. In his jour nal A soi-même he wrote: "A quel moment suis-je devenu objectif, c'est-à-dire assez regardeur des choses, assez voyant de la nature en soi, pour aller à mes fins et m'approprier des formes visibles? Ce fut vers 7865" (ASM 250, my italics). An omnivorous reader, Redon continued to read Baudelaire and to find in his Salons and critical essays an affirmation of his own ideas and a better understanding of his own creative genius. His reading of Poe as translated by Baudelaire gave further impetus to the development of his genius, despite his rather low opinion of the American writer, and resulted in an album A Edgar Poe published in 1882.6</page><page sequence="3">Lois Boe Hyslop and Francis E. Hys/op 143 As for Flaubert, it was only in 1881, after reading La Tentation de Saint Antoine, that Redon discovered in Its pages, as he wrote Emile Flennequln (March 31, 1882), "une merveille littéraire et une mine pour mol."7 It Is true that La Tentation proved a more potent source of Inspiration for Redon than Les Fleurs du mal and that he devoted three Important lithographic albums to Flaubert In 1888, 1889, and 1896, but by that time the artist had already found his way, thanks In large part to the Inspiration and encouragement he had discovered In Baudelaire. In fact, as Rosellne Bacou aptly points out, in the three albums devoted to Flaubert, Redon only offers new variations on themes we already know (Bacou 1: 52). Baudelaire continued to be a source of great Interest and Inspiration for Redon throughout the rest of his life. In the 1870's, during those years when the artist was developing his own unique style, he had an opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge of the poet-critic In the Salon of Mme de Rayssac, wife of the poet Salnt-Cyrde Rayssac, whose members Included Fantln-Latour and Chenavard, both of whom had known Baudelaire for many years. It was to the members of this Salon, where Baudelaire was often the subject of conver sation, that Redon is referring In a notation found In his Journal of 1878: "Pourquoi ne fut-ce qu'alors, après la guerre de 1870, à un âge tardif pour d'autres, et de renouveau pour mol, que me vinrent quelques amitiés clair voyantes?" {ASM 60-61). In the 1880's Baudelaire continued to be a frequent topic of conversation for Redon and his friends. The young Emile Hennequin, an enthusiastic ad mirer of both Redon and Baudelaire, "ne mettait rien au-dessus de Baudelaire, du Flaubert de la Tentation, et de Fluysmans," Bacou has noted (1: 77). And as late as 1912, G. Sarrazin in his Hommage à Redon further testified to the popularity of Baudelaire among the young Intellectuals of that time. Brought to the artist's studio by his friend Flennequln, he was struck by the remarka ble affinity between the works of Redon and those of Baudelaire and Poe— "deux poètes dont nous parlions constamment à cette date," he added signif icantly (Bacou 79, my ¡talles). Moreover, Baudelairean echoes are to be found everywhere In Redon's writings: In his Salon de 1868, In his Journal, and even in his letters. As late as 1893, a tantalizing reference to Baudelaire Is found In a letter written to Emile Bernard: "La grande affaire est de trouver la joie en soi. L'art est là et sera toujours là: Il n'y a qu'à en faire avec de l'or et de la boue" (Bacou 223, my italics). Obviously he remembered, without perhaps even being aware of the fact, what Baudelaire had written In his unfinished epilogue to the 1861 edition of Les Fleurs du mal. Addressing the city of Paris, the poet had used the very same expression: "Tu m'as donné ta boue et j'en al fait de l'or."8</page><page sequence="4">144 Nineteenth-Century French Studies Fifteen years later, Baudelaire was still very much on the artist's mind. In his preface to the catalogue of a Bresdin retrospective held at the Salon d'au tomne in 1908, Redon actually quoted from a short letter written by Baude laire on April 29, 1861, to his friend Théophile Gautier, in which he urged the critic to attend the exhibit of Bresdin's work that was then on display. Redon had obviously read Baudelaire's letters which had begun to appear in published form as early as 1872. Moreover, in 1906, two years before the Bresdin exhibit, he could have read the letters written between 1841 and 1866 that appeared in the Mercure de France and in the Baudelaire: étude biogra phique of Eugène and Jacques Crépet. In his letter to Gautier, Baudelaire had written: J'ignore si ses dessins sont reçus au Salon, mais en tout cas il est bon que tu voies quel ques morceaux de lui. Je te connais assez bien pour deviner qu'il y a là des choses qui te plairont infiniment. Reçois donc Bresdin comme une vieille connaissance; il te fera peut être cet effet quand tu connaîtras ses oeuvres.9 Nor should it be forgotten that as late as 1890, thirty years after first reading Les Fleurs du mal, Redon did a set of nine drawings, reproduced by the Evely process, which were intended for a special edition of the poems in question. It would be an exaggeration to attribute the maturity of Redon's genius to the influence of Baudelaire alone. There were many others in whose concepts and practices he found inspiration. But it should be remembered that fre quently these very ideas had already been noted and enthusiastically approved by Baudelaire in his critical essays. In still other cases, friends of Redon were reading or re-reading Baudelaire's aesthetic ideas and making of them a lively and "constant" subject of conversation, as G. Sarrazin has testified. To mention but a few instances. There was Redon's unbounded admira tion for Delacroix's painting and lithographs, strengthened even more by the unqualified praise of Baudelaire. There was his early training with a local drawing-teacher Stanislas Gorin who shared his young student's admiration for Delacroix. There was the botanist Clavaud who introduced him to Baude laire's writing and initiated him into scientific theories. There was the strange romantic art of Rodolphe Bresdin—admired and praised by Baudelaire—whose juxtaposition of the real and the dream Redon was to emulate. And finally there was Corot who taught him to base his dreams on reality: "A côté d'une incertitude, mettez une certitude" {ASM 35). Despite marked differences in their personalities, Redon and Baudelaire had much in common, especially during their early years. Both were long in submitting their work for public approval. "Je suis le fils de mes loisirs," the</page><page sequence="5">Lois Boe Hyslop and Francis E. Hyslop 145 artist once remarked, and his confession recalls that of Baudelaire who wrote in his Journaux intimes.10 C'est par le loisir que j'ai, en partie, grandi. A mon grand détriment; car le loisir, sans fortune, augmente les dettes, les avanies résultant des dettes. Mais à mon grand profit, relativement à la sensibilité, à la méditation, et à la faculté du dandysme et du dilettan tisme. (OC 1: 697) Redon may have been thinking of these last lines when in 1903 he wrote of himself: "Le loisir n'est pas un privilège; il n'est pas une faveur; il n'est pas une injustice sociale: il est la nécessité bienfaisante par quoi se façonnent l'es prit, le gôut, le discernement de soi-même" (ASM 102). For both Baudelaire and Redon, the experiences of their childhood and young manhood, their interests and predilections became a vital source of their work. Echoed in Re don's work are his memories of early life at Peyrelebade, of the old sixteenth century manor, and of the large neglected estate, filled with brambles and pine trees, where he liked to read and dream. In like manner, Baudelaire's memories of the few happy years he spent with his widowed mother before her remarriage as well as those of his sea voyage to the tropics furnished him with many of his images and even his themes. Both artist and poet were likewise aware of the role played by childhood in later life and of its association with the creative genius. In Les Paradis arti ficiels Baudelaire had written: "C'est dans les notes relatives à l'enfance que nous trouvons le germe des étranges rêveries de l'homme adulte, et disons mieux, de son génie." And a little later in that same essay he had added even more emphatically: "Le génie n'est que l'enfance retrouvée à volonté . . ." (OC 1: 497-498). Redon was expressing the same idea when he wrote to his friend and biog rapher André Mellerio on August 16, 1898: "Elle [la fantaisie] aime surtout la jeunesse et l'enfance, et la sagesse est de rester toujours un peu enfant, pour créer" (Lettres 33). It was because it was easier for him to remain "un peu enfant" and thus to rediscover the freshness of his vision that for many years he returned each summer to Peyrelebade to find new inspiration. At Peyre lebade, he wrote his friend Bonger on October 27, 1905: "C'est mon âme d'enfant que certains chemins me font renaître comme dans un renouveau" (Lettres 66). But it was in his Salon de 1868—a series of three articles reviewing the Salon in Paris that appeared in La Gironde, a Bordeaux newspaper—that the influence of Baudelaire is first undeniably apparent. Not that Redon was in any way plagiarizing Baudelaire's art criticism. Instead, like the poet-critic</page><page sequence="6">146 Nineteenth-Century French Studies who had found inspiration in Delacroix, Diderot, and Stendhal among others, he had obviously discovered in Baudelaire ideas and principles that were compatible with his own temperament and genius and that corroborated and confirmed his own unformulated beliefs and thoughts. As Rewald points out, "Redon did not simply draw from Baudelaire. He had personal things to say. The lucidity with which he evaluated, praised or condemned the works exhibited was entirely his own."11 The same, of course, had been true of Baudelaire's criticism and evaluation of his own contemporaries. Redon's approach to the Salon de 1868 was much like that of Baudelaire to the Salons of 1846 and 1859. As much conerned with aesthetic ideas and tendencies as his predecessor, he mingled his discussion of individual artists with the presentation of his own experiences and beliefs. In fact, Redon always felt that criticism divorced from a discussion of aesthetic concepts was largely worthless. From the very beginning of the Salon de 1868, Baudelaire's voice can be heard in the background. Redon's pronouncement that great art no longer exists recalls Baudelaire's lament in 1846 that "la grande tradition s'est per due, et... la nouvelle n'est pas faite" (OC 2: 493). For both artist and poet critic, the reasons are the same. If art had become decadent and had lost its way, it was mainly because it was devoid of imagination. In fact, Redon's Salon de 1868, like Baudelaire's Salon de 1859, is mainly a defense of the imagination as opposed to the realism of Courbet and the tendency of the "Actualistes" (who six years later were to be given the title of "Impressionis tes") to sacrifice vision and inner life to outward appearance. For Baudelaire, imagination had been "cette reine des facultés" to which all other faculties are subordinate (OC 2: 620); "la reine du vrai" one of whose provinces is "le possible" (OC 2: 621); "une faculté quasi divine" which per ceives the secret relationships of things, the correspondences and analogies (OC 2: 329); and "la plus scientifique des facultés" because it understands universal analogy (Corr. 1: 336). For Redon, imagination is likewise both a sovereign and a divinity. Fantasy (which he uses synonymously with imagination), he told André Mellerio in 1898, is "cette souveraine, qui nous ouvre soudain des séductions magnifiques, surprenantes, et qui nous subjugue." This fantasy, he added, was "un ange gardien" (Lettres 33, my italics). For Baudelaire the power of the imagination was such that, stimulated by music, it enabled him to be freed from "les liens de la pesanteur," as he wrote in his essay on Wagner, and to soar "au-dessus et bien loin du monde naturel" (OC 2: 784-785). Redon experienced at times a similar sensation. He too con</page><page sequence="7">Lois Boe Hyslop and Francis E. Hyslop 147 fessed having felt "une vie à son comble haute et suprême, inou'ie," compara ble, he admitted, to the ecstacy produced by music which reveals "un infini sans mélange découvert comme un absolu réel, le contact même avec l'au-delà" (Bacou 57). For both Redon and Baudelaire, the absence of imagination in the art of the day was the result of what Baudelaire called "ce culte niais de la nature, non épurée, non expliquée par l'imagination ..(OC 2: 660). Because the slogan "copiez la nature; ne copiez que la nature" was being constantly re peated, artists had come to paint not what they dreamed but what they saw. "Les artistes qui veulent exprimer la nature, moins les sentiments qu'elle ins pire, se soumettent à une opération bizarre qui consiste à tuer en eux l'homme pensant et sentant..." (OC 2: 660, my italics). Redon was in complete agreement. Describing the trend of the new move ment, he wrote: "Leur but n'est autre que la reproduction directe de la réalité: voir la nature et la rendre attrayante par la seule fidélité de celui qui la repro duit. Ces théories réalistes," he added, "bornent l'art et lui refusent ses sources les plus fécondes: la pensée, l'inspiration, le génie enfin et tout ce qu'il nous révèle" (Bacou 43).12 Years later, in 1913, he was even more emphatic in speaking of the Impressionists: "Vrais parasites de l'objet, ils ont cultivé l'art sur le champ uniquement visuel et l'ont fermé en quelque sorte à ce qui le dépasse et qui serait capable de mettre dans les plus humbles objets, même en des noirs, la lumière de la spiritualité" (ASM 127). It was also in Baudelaire's discussion of the imagination that Redon found encouragement for his use of the strange subject matter to which he was attracted. In his Salon de 1846 the poet-critic had maintained that, of the three kinds of drawings (exact or silly, the physiognomic, and the imagina tive), the imaginative, which is the most noble and the most strange, is permit ted to neglect nature: "il en représente une autre, analogue à l'esprit et au tempérament de l'auteur" (OC 2: 434). Baudelaire went a step farther in his Salon de 1859 and, in a moment of exasperation, provoked by the doctrine of the Positivists, he actually antici pated Redon's art: "Je trouve inutile et fastidieux de représenter ce qui est, parce que rien de ce qui est ne me satisfait. La nature est laide, et je préfère les monstres de ma fantaisie à la trivialité positive" (OC 2: 620). It is undeniable that much of Redon's art was inspired by the "monstres de [sa] fantaisie" and in Baudelaire's statements he obviously found approval for his own strange, imaginative art—an art which portrayed a nature alien to the world of reality and at the same time "analagous to the mind and the tem perament of the author." Redon may well have been thinking of Baudelaire</page><page sequence="8">148 Nineteenth-Century French Studies for one when he wrote: "J'ai fait un art selon moi seul .... Je l'ai fait aussi avec l'amour de quelques maîtres qui m'ont induit au culte de la beauté."13 Baudelaire and Redon are also in agreement that art, however much inspired by imagination, must have its roots in observed reality. For the poet-critic, nature, serving as a source of inspiration, is a fodder; for Redon it is a leaven or yeast. Basing himself on Delacroix, Baudelaire wrote in 1859: "Tout l'uni vers visible n'est qu'un magasin d'images et de signes auxquelles l'imagination donnera une place et une valeur relative; c'est une espèce de pâture que l'ima gination doit digérer et transformer" (OC 2: 627, my italics). Redon was to write in a similar vein: "Après un effort pour copier minu tieusement un caillou, un brin d'herbe, une main, un profil, ou tout autre chose de la vie vivante ou inorganique, je sens une ébullition mentale venir: j'ai alors besoin de créer, de me laisser aller à la représentation de l'imaginaire. La nature, ainsi dosée et infusée, devient ma source, ma levure, mon ferment. De cette origine, je crois mes inventions vraies" (ASM 30, my italics). Though Redon's art often seems completely divorced from reality, his claim that nature was for him a yeast or leaven has been corroborated by both friends and critics. It is a known fact that he studied the bone structure of various creatures at museums of natural history and that from this basis of observation he proceeded to distort natural forms and to create imaginary beings. The collector Gustave Fayet, a close friend of Redon, tells how, on visiting the artist's studio during his momentary absence, he saw on an easel a picture entitled La Mort rouge, depicting an enormous coiled serpent. From its jaws issued a green skeleton. On the artist's color box a child's zoology book lay open: "Sur la page, il y avait un serpent boa: de cet infâme dessin était né le magnifique serpent de son tableau" (Bacou 1: 70). And as Rewald has pointed out, it was while living near a horse dealer that Redon conceived a series of works representing Pegasus as well as Apollo's chariot.14 As for the artist's flower pictures, it is obvious, even to the unini tiated, that it is fantasy in addition to observation that explains the strange beauty of his floral compositions. Throughout his life Redon continued to insist that his art, however much stimulated by his imagination, was always rooted in his observation of the visible world. In the opening sentence of his Journal he states categorically: "J'ai fait un art selon moi. Je l'ai fait avec les yeux ouverts sur les merveilles du monde visible, et, quoi qu'on en ait pu dire, avec le souci d'obéir aux lois du naturel et de la vie" (ASM 11). As late as 1904, Redon was still insisting that in his art, imagination had always gone hand in hand with observation. On the margin of a very flattering</page><page sequence="9">Lois Boe Hyslop and Francis E. Hyslop 149 article that had been published by Emile Bernard, he had jotted down a num ber of comments contradicting what he believed to be certain misconceptions on the part of the critic. Repudiating Bernard's contention that he was a Sur realist, the artist had written: "Le surnaturel n'est pas ma nature. Mon dessin tient du visible. Il formule des êtres immatériels en les constituant selon la logique matérielle" (Bacou 280-281). Elsewhere on the margins of the same article he protested: "Ma volonté est toujours présente" and again "Le surnaturel ne m'inspire pas. je ne fais que contempler le monde extérieur et la vie" (Bacou 279, 283). But a visible or external nature was for both Baudelaire and Redon only a starting-point. Once nature has been observed, the artist or poet must move from the visible to the invisible, from the external world to the artist's own inner world. In 1859, Baudelaire had given a new dimension to art in his well known definition of pure art—a definition which was not published until ten years later in 1869: "C'est une magie suggestive contenant à la fois l'objet et le sujet, le monde extérieur à l'artiste et l'artiste lui-même" {OC 2: 598). Baudelaire had done exactly this in much of his own poetry. For him, exte rior reality had become a sort of metaphor—a means of exteriorizing his état d'âme. And more often than not, his state of mind, like that of Redon during the period of his "noirs," was one of gloom and melancholy or even despair. Adopting the word "suggestive," Redon used it to describe his own art as well as certain tendencies he admired in Delacroix, Rembrandt, and Leonardo da Vinci. Above all, he sought what he called "suggestive ambiguity." His early art teacher Gorin, an admirer of both Delacroix and Baudelaire, had first taught his pupil to regard art as the expression of one's individuality and had encouraged him to transmit that individuality through suggestive effect. Together with the botanist Clavaud and the artist Rodolphe Bresdin, whose strange, imaginative etchings strongly appealed to the aspiring young artist, Gorin reinforced Redon's belief that art, while retaining its basis of observa tion, should be poetically suggestive as well as technically accomplished. All three mentors would have accepted Baudelaire's dictum: "Toute bonne sculp ture, toute bonne peinture, toute bonne musique, suggère les sentiments et les rêveries qu'elle veut suggérer" (OC 2: 598). In his journal, Redon insists on the fact that "cet art suggestif ... est aussi le mien . . . ." And he goes on to explain: "Mes dessins inspirent et ne se défi nissent pas. Ils ne déterminent rien. Ils nous placent, ainsi que la musique, dans le monde ambigu de l'indéterminé. Ils sont une sorte de métaphore, a dit Remy de Gourmont, en les situant à part, loin de tout art géométrique. Il y voit une logique imaginative. Je crois que cet écrivain a dit en quelques lignes plus que tout ce qui fut écrit autrefois sur mes premiers travaux" (ASM 27-28).</page><page sequence="10">150 Nineteenth-Century French Studies In the opinion of both Redon and Baudelaire, the inner world suggested by artist or poet is what gives a work its freshness and originality. Without feeling, art becomes dull and banal. Such banality, the poet believed, was especially true of landscape painters who "à force de contempler.. . oublient de sentir et de penser" [OC 2: 625). Though most landscape artists, he admits, paint remarkably well, "presque tous oublient qu'un site naturel n'a de valeur que le sentiment actuel que l'artiste y sait mettre" (OC 2: 660). Baudelaire even goes so far as to insist that "tout paysagiste qui ne sait pas traduire un sentiment par un assemblage de matière végétale ou minérale n'est pas un artiste" (OC 2: 660). If he considered Troyon's art flawed, it was because he painted "sans âme." Delacroix, on the other hand, was eminently successful, for, gifted with a richer imagination than his contemporaries, he expressed "l'intime du cerveau" (OC 2: 662). Redon was equally insistent that art should reveal "both the world outside the artist and the artist himself." In the Salon de 1868, he criticized those who reproduced only what they saw; "Ceux qui restent dans ces limites bornées se condamnent à un idéal inférieur." It was because Corot and Chintreuil were not content merely to observe, because they used nature as a means of express ing imagination and fantasy that he considered them the greatest landscape artists of his day. For to Redon: "C'est là l'artiste supérieur: il est peintre devant la nature, poète ou penseur a l'atelier" (Bacou 46, my italics). Unconsciously or by coincidence, Redon was restating, though more suc cinctly, Baudelaire's comments regarding the difference between a study and a finished picture. In his Salon de 1859 Baudelaire had exclaimed: "Je com prends qu'un esprit appliqué à prendre des notes ne puisse pas s'abandonner aux prodigieuses rêveries contenues dans les spectacles de la nature présente; mais pourquoi l'imagination fuit-elle l'atelier du paysagiste?" (OC 2: 665, my italics). In the second article comprising his Salon de 1868, Redon continued to stress in Baudelairean fashion the necessity for the artist— landscapist or other —to feel as well as to see. While conscious of their great merits and generous in his praise, he accused Courbet, Manet, Monet, Picasso, and Jonkind of ren dering only "la réalité vue": "leurs personnages manquent de vie morale, de cette vie intérieure, intime, que le peintre traduit dans ces moments heureux." "Courbet ne sait pas rythmer," he wrote, "c'est un prosateur." As for Manet, despite his admiration for the latter's originality and brilliant technique, he regretted his tendency to sacrifice thinking man to good craftsmanship. It was Manet's failure to capture feeling and thought that prompted his harsh judg ment of the portrait of Zola: "plutôt une nature morte que l'expression d'un</page><page sequence="11">Lois Boe Hyslop and Francis E. Hyslop 151 caractère humain." The true artist, he concludes, not only sees but feels: "Tout en reconnaissant pour base la nécessité de la Réalité vue, pour eux l'art vérita ble est dans la Réalité sentie" (Bacou 1: 44-45). This declaration, asserted for the first time in his Salon de 1868, continued to be, as Bacou suggests, one of the keys to Redon's aesthetics. It is one from which he never deviated. As late as December 1903, he reiterated his position of 1868: "Un portrait est l'image d'un caractère, d'un être humain, représenté dans son essence. Toute la vie profonde qui le manifeste pour nous au dehors: attitude, expression, densité morale" (ASM 102). Baudelaire, in his Salon de 1859, had praised the artist Ricard for much the same reason: "Il a vraiment une intelligence toujours apte à peindre l'âme qui pose devant lui" (OC 2: 658). That the "suggestive magic" characterizing "pure art" is revealed through the participation of the viewer as much as through the accomplishment of the artist was clearly brought out by Baudelaire in his famous essay on Wagner: "Dans la musique, comme dans la peinture, et même dans la parole écrite, qui est cependant le plus positif des arts, il y a toujours une lacune complétée par l'imagination de l'auditeur" (OC 2: 781-782). Redon makes a similar comparison between the suggestive art of music and his own art: L'art suggestif est comme une irradiation des choses pour le rêve où s'achemine aussi la pensée . .. .Cet art suggestif est tout entier dans l'art excitateur de la musique, plus libre ment, plus radieusement; mais il est aussi le mien par une combinaison de divers éléments rapprochés, de formes transposées ou transformées, sans aucun rapport avec les contin gences, mais ayant une logique cependant. (ASM 100) And, like Baudelaire, he insists that the role of the spectator be that of an active participant: "L'œuvre d'art est le ferment d'une émotion que l'artiste propose: le public en dispose; mais il faut aimer" (ASM 100). Redon not only insisted on the right of the artist to express feeling and thought, he was also in complete agreement with Baudelaire that art should be divorced from morality and utility and that its only goal be beauty: Une œuvre conçue en vue d'un enseignement sera sans sa facture conduite par de mauvais chemins. Un tableau n'enseigne rien; il attire, il surprend, il exalte, il mène insensiblement et par amour, au besoin de vivre avec le beau; // lève et redresse l'esprit, voilà tout. (ASM 108, my italics) Baudelaire had been expressing the very same idea when he wrote in his 1857 essay on Poe: "Ainsi le principe de la poésie est. .. l'aspiration humaine vers une beauté supérieure, et la manifestation de ce principe est dans l'enthou siasme, une excitation de l'âme" (OC 2: 334, my italics).</page><page sequence="12">152 Nineteenth-Century French Studies Though early in his career Baudelaire had for a short time maintained that art should be inseparable from morality and utility, he soon came to change his mind. "L'art est-il utile?" he had asked in "Les Drames et les romans hon nêtes." "Oui. Pourquoi? Parce qu'il est l'art. Y a-t-iI un art pernicieux? Oui. C'est celui qui dérange les conditions de la vie" {OC 2: 41 ). Redon, in addressing himself to the question of utility in art, adopted Bau delaire's rhetorical manner: "Le beau est-il utile? Non. L'utile est-il beau? Non. Un soulier n'est pas beau, un pain non plus" (ASM 141). Somewhat earlier in his Journal he had explained his position in greater detail: Soumettre le talent et même le génie à des concepts de justice ou de morale est une grande erreur .... Il ne faut pas enchaîner son art à des convictions politiques, ni à une morale. Au contraire, l'art doit fournir au philosophe, au penseur, au savant, et peut-être même au théosophe, qui sait? matière à spéculer et à aimer. (ASM 108-1 09) Redon was likewise in agreement with Baudelaire on the importance of the dream in the creation of art. The poet-critic's insistence on the mystical importance of the dream and its role in aiding the imagination could not fail to find sympathetic understanding on the part of one who, as a child, had lived in a dream-world of his own and peopled his solitary existence with imaginary beings. Huysmans seems to have been the first to note the close correpondence between Baudelaire and Redon, at least in the matter of dreams. In fact, in his review of the Salon of 1881, he suggested that the artist must have con templated Poe's consoling aphorism that all certitude lies in dreams. The nov elist was referring to Baudelaire's 1857 essay on Poe in which he had quoted Poe's statement that "toute certitude est dans les rêves" (OC 2: 323). A few pages earlier in the same essay Baudelaire had cited the exact quotation which Poe had used at the beginning of Eureka-. "J'offre ce livre à ceux qui ont mis leur foi dans les rêves comme dans les seules réalités" (OC 2: 321 ). This is not the only reference to dreams that Redon would have found in Baudelaire. At the beginning of Les Paradis artificiels, the poet-critic had expressed much the same idea: "Le bon sens nous dit que les choses de la terre n'existent que bien peu, et que la vraie réalité n'est que dans les rêves." And elsewhere in that same article he had added: ". . . c'est par le rêve que l'homme communique avec le monde ténébreux dont il est environné" (OC 399, 497). Given Redon's thorough knowledge of Baudelaire, it seems hardly a coin cidence that the artist should have chosen as a title for his first series of litho graphs the words Dans le rêve. As in the poem "La Voix," he had determined, by means of his art and his imagination, to "voyager dans le rêve / Au-delà du</page><page sequence="13">Lois Boe Hyslop and Francis E. Hysiop 153 possible, au-delà du connu." What Baudelaire had said of Grandville was to be as true of Redon as of the caricaturist: "il appliquait sa volonté ... à noter sous une forme plastique la succession des rêves et des cauchemars. . ." (OC 2: 559). Moreover, Redon may also have been thinking of himself when he wrote of Bresdin in his Journal: "Ce qu'il a voulu, ce qu'il a cherché n'est autre chose que nous initier aux impressions de son propre rêve" (ASM 157). Even the most cursory glance at Redon's art reveals the close kinship be tween his actual practice and the ideas expressed by Baudelaire both in his prose and poetry. Nowhere is this relationship more striking than in their con ception of beauty. In the poet-critic's definition of beauty, noted by him in his Journaux intimes, are to be found almost all the features that characterize Redon's "noirs" as well as his works in color. "C'est quelque chose d'ardent et de triste," he begins, "quelque chose d'un peu vague, laissant carrière à la conjecture" (OC 2: 657). Though melancholy and sadness were essential ingredients of Redon's art even before he could have known the definition, he would have had ample opportunity to observe the important role they played both in Baudelaire's criticism and in his poetry. In his essay on Gautier (1859 and 1869), Baude laire had written: "C'est un des privilèges prodigieux de l'art que ... la dou leur rythmée et cadencée remplisse l'esprit d'une joie calme" (OC 2: 123). And nowhere had he proved his contention better than in his moving poem "Recueillement." In the case of the artist, technique was as important in the presentation of sadness as the subject itself. Black and white did for his prints what rhythm and cadence had done for Baudelaire's poetry. As Richard Hobbs points out, Redon's use of black and white in his lithographs and etchings "served well the melancholy and pessimism predominant in his work."15 In 1913 Redon remarked: "Le noir est la couleur la plus essentielle .... Il faut respecter le noir. Rien ne le prostitue. Il ne plaît pas aux yeux et n'éveille aucune sensibi lité. Il est agent de l'esprit bien plus que la belle douleur de la palette ou du prisme" (ASM 119). Baudelaire's comment on the art of Delacroix could only have encouraged Redon's taste for the sad and melancholy. In his Sa/on de 1846 he had asserted that what made Delacroix "le vrai artiste du XIXe siècle" was "cette mélanco lie singulière et opiniâtre qui s'exhale de toutes ses œuvres, et qui s'exprime et par le choix des sujets, et par l'expression des figures, et par le geste, et par le style et la couleur" (OC 2: 440). This same strange and persistent melancholy which Baudelaire admired in Delacroix also characterizes the works of Redon. Save for the huge spider whose smiling face becomes a source of horror rather than joy, there are no</page><page sequence="14">154 Nineteenth-Century French Studies smiling or happy faces in all of Redon's work, including that of his later and more optimistic period. His charcoal drawing of 1875 known as Profil de lumière (1886) depicting a woman's head, eyes half-closed, an expression of gentle melancholy on her lips, corresponds almost exactly to Baudelaire's evocation of Delacroix's use of melancholy. Moreover, the rich, luminous black that further accentuates the equally luminous white of the woman's profile is thoroughly Baudelairean. We have but to recall the impression made on him by Delacroix's use of color—an im pression "sombre, délicieuse pourtant, lumineuse, mais tranquille . .(OC 2: 753). Baudelaire might have been speaking of Profil de lumière or even of Les Yeux clos, done both as a painting and a lithograph in 1890.16 Even more than by its melancholy and pessimism, Redon's art is character ized by its mystery which, as we have seen, Baudelaire also associated with his personal conception of beauty ("quelque chose d'un peu vague, laissant carrière à la conjecture"). "Le sens du mystère," the artist wrote in his jour nal, .. c'est d'être tout le temps dans l'équivoque, dans les double, triple aspects, des soupçons d'aspect (images dans images), formes qui vont être, ou qui le seront selon l'état d'esprit du regardeur" (ASM 97). And to Mellerio, who was seeking the genesis of his "noirs," Redon answered that his only purpose was to "produire chez le spectateur une sorte d'attirance diffuse et dominatrice dans le monde obscur de l'indéterminé.... Encore une fois, il est bon d'entourer toute genèse d'un mystère" (Lettres 30-31). Redon seemed frankly puzzled by the attempts of his young admirers to discover the meaning of his works: L'on me suppose trop d'esprit d'analyse: c'est du moins ce qui ressort des curiosités que je sens chez les jeunes écrivains qui me visitent. Je les vois, à mon abord, étonnés. Qu'ai je mis en mes ouvrages pour leur suggérer tant de subtilités? J'y ai mis une porte ouverte sur le mystère. J'ai fait des fictions. C'est à eux d'aller plus loin. [ASM 89) Moreover, he made no attempt to hide the fact that the captions he used in a number of his albums were deliberately equivocal—an effort on his part to gain the attention of the public. Those invented by him for his album on Poe and written in true Poesque style were, he admitted, "une équivoque, bien permise, très légitime; l'album fut remarqué, c'était l'essentiel pour moi" (.Lettres 31). Mallarmé, a close friend of Redon in his later years, who also sought to mystify his readers, expressed his admiration for the captions and confessed: "Vous le savez, Redon, je jalouse vos légendes" (Bacou 1: 95). In Baudelaire's essay on Victor Hugo, Redon found further indications of the importance the poet-critic attached to the element of mystery. Hugo, according to Baudelaire, was the man best endowed to reveal "le mystère de</page><page sequence="15">Lois Boe Hyslop and Francis E. Hyslop 155 la vie" arid to express "avec l'obscurité indispensable ce qui est obscur et con fusément révélé .... Ses sens subtils lui révèlent des abîmes; il voit le mystère partout.... De là, dérive ce sentiment d'effroi qui pénètre plusieurs de ses plus beaux poèmes" {OC 2: 133-134). Hugo's poetry, he explains in words that actually suggest many of Redon's "noirs," translates for the human soul the most fleeting and most complicated sensations transmitted to it by "la nature inanimée, ou dite inanimée;. .. tout ce qu'il y a d'humain darts n'im porte quoi, et aussi tout ce qu'il y a de divin, de sacré ou de diabolique" (OC 2: 131-132, my italics). Baudelaire's opinion on the matter of mystery undoubtedly gave Redon the confidence he needed. To his friend Fayet, he wrote: Les œuvres qui bravent le temps ont du mystère. Leur secret s'en révèle peu à peu, elles sont ainsi faites que beaucoup d'hommes différents se reconnaissent en elles. Comme la nature, elles sont des réponses diverses aux éternelles questions du désir, du rêve et de l'inquiétude. (Bacou 1:218) If Redon accepted Baudelaire's association of beauty with sadness and with mystery, he also accepted and put into practice the poet-critic's associa tion of beauty with the strange, the ugly, the horrible and even evil. The artist could hardly have failed to note Baudelaire's insistence on the element of the "strange." Like Poe, who had cited Bacon's famous dictum, "There is no exquisite beauty without some strangeness in its proportions," the poet had designated the bizarre as "the indispensable condiment of all beauty." And in his article on the Exposition Universelle, he had developed the same idea at even greater length: Le beau est toujours bizarre. Je ne veux pas dire qu'il soit volontairement, froidement bizarre, car dans ce cas il serait un monstre sorti des rails de la vie. Je dis qu'il contient toujours un peu de bizarrerie naïve, non voulue, inconsciente,et que c'est cette bizarrerie qui le fait particulièrement le Beau. (OC 2: 578) This approval that Redon found in these lines for his own proclivities was further strengthened by Baudelaire's comments on Gautier's poetry: "C'est un des privilèges prodigieux de l'art que l'horrible artistement exprimé, devienne beauté .. ." (OC 2: 123). And in a later essay on Gautier, he had expressed a similar thought: "Il n'a aimé que le Beau; il n'a cherché que le Beau; et quand un objet grotesque ou hideux s'est offert à ses yeux, il a su encore en extraire une mystérieuse et symbolique beauté" (OC 2: 1 52). Over and over, Baudelaire was to insist on the power of art to transform horror, ugliness, and even evil into beauty. In his famous poem "Hymne à la Beauté," he had written:</page><page sequence="16">156 Nineteenth-Century French Studies Tu marches sur des morts, Beauté, dont tu moques; De tes bijoux l'Horreur n'est pas le moins charmant, Et le Meurtre, parmi tes plus chères breloques, Sur ton ventre orgueilleux danse amoureusement. In poems like "Une Charogne" and "Une Martyre" Baudelaire had himself given beauty to horror and to murder and he had done so believing, as he said of Goya's caricatures, that art is "purificateur comme le feu" {OC 2: 547). Redon was attempting to do the same thing not only in works like Sur la coupe in which he portrayed the severed head of a beautiful woman, but also in the greater part of his "noirs" where the Baudelairean influence is plainly evident. In his essay on Victor Hugo, Baudelaire had also stressed the need for the artist or writer to paint the horrible as well as the beautiful, heaven as well as hell: Celui qui n'est pas capable de tout peindre . . . tout ce qu'il y a de plus doux et tout ce qui existe de plus horrible . . . tout enfin depuis le visible jusqu'à l'invisible, depuis le ciel jusqu'à l'enfer, celui-là, dis-je, n'est vraiment pas poète dans l'immense étendue du mot et selon le coeur de Dieu. (OC 2: 1 35, my italics) A few lines later Baudelaire added what seems as true of Redon as of Hugo: "Le génie qu'il a de tout temps déployé dans la peinture de toute la mons truosité qui enveloppe l'homme est vraiment prodigieux" (OC 2: 137). Roseline Bacou has noted that Redon's art is based on an essential antith esis—on either "ces laideurs et ces étrangetés qui se dissimulent dans les replis de l'âme" or on the dreams of "une terre heureuse, secrète et pure"—and that his inspiration oscillated between the horror-struck face of Le Prisonnier and the calm visage of Orpheus who transcends his grief in song. She reminds us of Baudelaire's statement in L'Art Romantique: "Tout cerveau bien conformé porte en lui les deux infinis: le Ciel et l'Enfer, et dans toute image de l'un de ces infinis, il reconnaît subitement la moitié de lui-même." And she concludes by maintaining that Redon has given the plastic form of monsters to those two halves of ourselves (Bacou 72). It cannot be denied that Redon's art is testimony to Baudelaire's belief that "l'art moderne a une tendance essentiellement démoniaque," as he stated in his essay on Théodore de Banville (OC 2:168). Critics, in fact, have often men tioned the demoniac symbolism that marks so much of the artist's work, par ticularly his lithographs and charcoal drawings. As Klaus Berger has suggested, "they were either filled with admiration for the visions of his Daemonic Dream world or with repugnance against his impenetrable, indeed terrifying halluci nations."17</page><page sequence="17">Lois Boe Hyslop and Francis E. H y slop 157 Redon himself freely admitted that many of his creations were monsters, but done according to the laws of nature: "Toute mon originalité consiste donc à faire vivre humainement des êtres Invraisemblables selon les lois du vraisemblable, en mettant, autant que possible, la logique du visible au service de l'Invisible" (ASM 29-30). And In a letter of 1904 to Emile Bernard, he admitted that some of the heads on one of his prints were "d'expression per verse et mauvaise" (Lettres 212, n. 1). It is often suggested that Redon found Inspiration for his monsters In the Caprichos of Goya. The Spanish artist was well known at the time, both In France and England, as the creator of Los Caprichos, and one of his greatest admirers was Baudelaire who praised them enthusiastically In "Quelques Cari caturistes étrangers." A serles of eighty prints comprising etchings and aqua tints and published In book form in 1799, Los Caprichos represent a strange admixture of dream, fantasy, and social satire. In Redon there Is, of course, no social satire, which may be one of the rea sons why Huysmans, though acknowledging an affinity between Redon and Goya, insisted that his real precursors were Baudelaire and Poe. There Is much truth in Huysman's observation, for even In other respects there is a vast dif ference between the "monsters" of the two artists. Redon's monsters are, as he himself admitted, "des êtres Invraisemblables" made to live "selon les lois du vraisemblable." Goya's monsters, on the other hand, are real human beings that he has dehumanized. They possess "des physionomies humaines étrange ment anlmallsées par les circonstances," as Baudelaire has so aptly noted (OC 2: 568). Both artists, however, sought to make "le monstrueux vraisemblable," and Baudelaire's praise of Goya's success in this respect must have further inspired and encouraged Redon. In his essay "Quelques Caricaturistes étrangers" he had written: Le grand mérite de Goya consiste à créer le monstrueux vraisemblable. Ses monstres sont nés viables, harmoniques .... La ligne de suture, le point de jonction entre le réel et le fantastique est impossible à saisir; c'est une frontière vague que l'analyste le plus subtil ne saurait pas tracer, tant l'art est à la fois transcendant et naturel. (OC 2: 569-570) Knowing Redon's keen interest in Baudelaire, we can be sure that the poet critic's words had an even more profound influence on the artist than the prints themselves. Redon himself paid his own tribute to Goya in 1885 by entitling an album of his lithographs Hommage à Goya. It has also been suggested by S ven Sandstrôm, among others, that Redon may have been influenced by caricature and by popular illustrations, espe cially those of Grandville. He cites in particular anthropomorphic flowers,</page><page sequence="18">158 Nineteenth-Century French Studies detached and winged heads, floating eyeballs, and even cellular forms found in Grandville's book and magazine illustrations. He likewise mentions a late print Premier Rêve that he suggests may have influenced Redon. But the spirit animating Grandville's grotesque works is so different from that of Redon that his influence can only be regarded as secondary. If, however, Redon knew Grandville's work and was influenced by it, it is certain that Baudelaire's comments on that art gave him the courage to use somewhat similar devices in his more serious art forms. In his essay on French caricaturists Baudelaire had written: Or c'est par le côté fou de son talent que Grandville est important. Avant de mourir, il appliquait sa volonté, toujours opiniâtre, à noter sous une forme plastique la succession des rêves et des cauchemars, avec la précision d'un sténographe qui écrit le discours d'un orateur. (OC 2: 559) Baudelaire's sharp criticism of Grandville's use of "banderoles parlantes" may also explain why Redon ceased to write captions to accompany his lith ographs. The poet-critic had characterized Grandville as "un esprit maladive ment littéraire, toujours en quête de moyens bâtards pour faire entrer sa pensée dans le domaine des arts plastiques; aussi l'avons-nous vu souvent user du vieux procédé qui consiste à attacher aux bouches de ses personnages des banderoles parlantes" {OC 2: 858). Redon, who deeply resented being viewed as a literary artist, would have been struck by these words and would have sought to avoid a similar criticism directed at his art. Redon's debt to Baudelaire's critical essays was not limited to the aesthetic principles embodied in those works. It is, of course, well known that Baude laire's poetry was one of the many sources that inspired the subject matter of Redon's art. Mention has already been made of the album created in 1890 for a special edition of Les Fleurs du mai. Moreover, the skeletons, skulls, spiders, worms, serpents and winged creatures that abound in Redon's "noirs" are everywhere present in the poems: in "Sépulture," spiders, vipers, half-starved witches; in "L'Irrémédiable," slimy monsters with wide, phosphorescent eyes; in "Le Revenant," angels with eyes of wild beasts; in "Spleen," bats, spiders, bells leaping with fury, wandering spirits; in "Le Mort joyeux," snails, sharks, crows, worms. The list can easily be extended. What is less well known is the fact that Baudelaire's critical essays also inspired a number of the images and themes which appear in the "noirs." It is significant that the titles of the first two lithographs appearing in the album Dans ie rêve are undeniably drawn from one of Baudelaire's best known criti cal essays—one devoted to his famous contemporary, Victor Hugo.</page><page sequence="19">Lois Boe Hyslop and Francis E. Hysiop 159 Hugo, Baudelaire wrote in his essay, lets his thoughts wander in an intox icating labyrinth of speculations. There is not a problem, philosophical or scientific, he maintained, that has not found a place in his works. The world of the stars and the world of souls, the vast cosmos, the existence of a God who brings forth worlds and then calls them back to his bosom—all these are only some of the problems which Baudelaire listed among the subjects pre sented in Hugo's poetry. But it is Baudelaire's references in his essay to the "extra-scientifique" conjectures of Hugo's work that aroused the interest of Redon and relates directly to some of his "noirs," especially to those in Dans ie rêve: Et la conjecture sur l'appropriation morale, sur la destination de tous ces mondes, nos voisins inconnus, ne prend-elle pas aussi naturellement sa place dans les immenses domai nes de la poésie? Germinations, éclosions, floraisons, éruptions successives, simultanées, lentes ou soudaines, progressives ou complètes, d'astres, d'étoiles, de soleils, de constella tions, êtes-vous simplement les formes de la vie de Dieu, ou des habitations préparées par sa bonté ou sa justice à des âmes qu'il veut éduquer et rapprocher progressivement de lui même! (OC 2: 138, my italics) And Baudelaire goes on to ask if it would exceed the rightful limits of poetic conjecture to believe that new systems and clusters of planets presenting new unanswered problems may spring forth in the future: "Je m'attache à ce mot conjecture, qui sert à définir, passablement, le caractère extra-scientifique de toute poésie" (OC 2: 138-139). "Germination," "Eclosión"—the words with which Baudelaire begins his question about the nature and purpose of heavenly bodies—are the very words which Redon chose to entitle the first two lithographs of Dans ie rêve. So striking a choice and combination of words on the part of both critic and artist is obviously not a result of mere coincidence.18 And the similarity in nature of Baudelaire's commentary and the lithographs in question only offers further proof of that fact. "Germination," Thomas Walters writes, "is com posed of what appears to be a disembodied head in profile emerging from a black nimbus. One is given the impression that, with its fellow beings, it will fall to a distant earth below.. . ,"19 One could also surmise that the mask-like heads floating in the black void surrounding the even blacker nimbus are souls seeking, as Baudelaire suggested, a habitation prepared by God. A lithograph in the album Le Juré, done as late as 1887, also seems to relate both in theme and in treatment to this same discussion of Hugo. Its title—"Pourquoi n'exis terait-il pas un monde composé d'êtres invisibles, bizarres, fantastiques, em bryonnaires?"—seems to have come right out of the essay.</page><page sequence="20">160 Nineteenth-Century French Studies That other lithographs, charcoal drawings, and etchings in Redon's œuvre owe their inspiration, in part or in whole, to Baudelaire's critical essays calls for further investigation. What is of primary importance to us, however, is the fact that, in addition to furnishing Redon with ideas and images, those essays encouraged and confirmed the aesthetic principles and proclivities of an artist who, though he stood apart from the art world of his day, was in reality—much like Baudelaire himself—an heir of Romanticism, an adherent of Symbolism, and, in certain aspects of his work, a distant, though unintentional precursor of Surrealism.

Baudelaire's description of Delacroix's La Madeleine dans le désert has so much in common with Les Yeux clos that it could almost be taken as one of its sources: "C'est une tête de femme renversée dans un cadre très étroit. A droite, dans le haut, un petit bout de ciel ou de rocher—quelque chose de bleu—les yeux de la Madeleine sont fermés, la bouche est molle et languissante, les cheveux épars. Nul, à moins de la voir, ne peut imaginer ce que l'artiste a mis de poésie intime, mystérieuse et romantique dans cette simple tête ... les tons, loin d'être éclatants ou intenses, sont très doux et très modérés; l'aspect est presque gris, mais d'une harmonie parfaite" (OC 2: 354). Though the head in Redon's painting is not upturned and the touch of blue has be come a solid blue background for the head, the gentle, languid mouth, the undone hair, the intimate, mysterious poetic effect are all there, even to the restrained tone and the perfect harmony of the soft, greyish tone that marks the work. In a letter to Bonger (February 5, 1904), Redon himself comments on the greyish tone (Lettres 55). Baudelaire's definition of feminine beauty found in his Journaux intimes is even more suggestive of Redon's portraits in question: "une tête séduisante et belle, une tête de femme, veux-je dire, c'est une tête qui fait rêver à la fois—mais d'une manière confuse— de volupté et de tristesse; qui comporte une idée de mélancolie, de lassitude, même de satiété . . ."
