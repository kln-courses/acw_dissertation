<plain_text><page sequence="1">A LIBYAN ATHENA WITH ANCIENT GREEK INSCRIPTIONS* Patricia W. Rovik PROLOGUE In February 1941, a military force under the command of Erwin Rommel arrived in Tripoli on the north-west coast of Libya. This was an exercise in Axis support as the Italian North Africa Army had been in retreat westwards from Sidi Barrani and had recently suffered a major reverse with the capture, by a mainly British and Commonwealth force, of Benghazi, the city most cherished by the Italians in their Libyan colony. After the Benghazi victory, as British Intelligence had been unaware of the impending arrival of the Germans in North Africa, major divisions of the British and Commonwealth force were sent from Libya for duty in Greece and Crete. The newly arrived German force, soon named the Deutsches Afrika Korps, outnumbered and outclassed the depleted British/Commonwealth force in armoured vehicles and in weaponry, and it was supported by the Luftwaffe. In quick succession, the erstwhile victors soon evacuated the recently occupied sites, one after another—so fast that the Australian troops called it 'the Benghazi Handicap'. British Command decided to fall back to Tobruk in the east, regroup, dig in, and seek resupply there. As the Afrika Korps moved from Tripoli towards Tobruk, it had to cope with the ghibli—desert sandstorms—and with raids by the Desert Airforce; so the men dug in along the way. From Palestine, the Australian 7th Division was sent to Tobruk which soon became a place of siege. There were daily raids by Stukas of the Luftwaffe.1 The men who dug in at Tobruk gained the epithet of 'the Rats of Tobruk' and eventually most of them had made individual foxholes for themselves, as did Sapper Harold Price. He was one of the 7th Division Australians detailed to lay and raise mines and to go on reconnaissance and fighting patrols beyond the outer perimeter defence line. On one such sortie, Sapper Price and his small band of mates, having killed the Germans in a bunker from which there had been constant fire, then moved in to see what supplies might be available there. Sapper Price looked across the bunker, saw a stone figure on a ledge, and indicated that that was his sole choice. When Price and his field company left for Palestine in August 1941, he carried in his kitbag the 6 kg stone figure. After Palestine, his unit was temporarily sent back to Australia, as the Japanese had brought the Pacific War to New Guinea and the 7th Division was needed there. The figure acquired in the Libyan desert was kept in the home of Harold and May Price in Sydney, at South Hurstville. It was there in 1983 that it first came to my notice. Before Harold Price's demise in July 1984,1 talked with him often about the research I was by then undertaking on the statue and about its future. He wished the statue to be left to me; but he agreed that it should eventually be in the professional care of a well-regarded museum where it may be seen by other people. It was given place in The Collection of Small Sculpture at Macquarie University in 2001. The author would like to express her thanks to the family of the late Harold and May Price, to the staff and postgraduate students of the Departments of Archaeology, Classics, and Ancient History at The University of Sydney, and the Sydney Society for Literature and Aesthetics. 1 For these wartime events, the publications used here were: E.

Rovik DESCRIPTION AND INTERPRETATION The 25 cm-high statue is of grey-white high-grade metamorphic marble with a few touches of vesuvianite (pis. IV; 14-15) 2 Whereas thumbnail-sized patches of pinkish vesuvianite appear underneath the statue, only a tiny spot is noticeable on the sculpted surface at the front, below the second line of inscription. There are inscriptions in ancient Greek on all four sides of the statue (fig. 1). These have so far proved to be untranslatable.3 The head of the figure is one-fourth the length of the body—from topknot to toes—as is traditional in much North African art, especially sculpture.4 The high breasts indicate that the figure is female. The head is dolichocephalic; the triangular face is almond-eyed, platyrrhine nosed, wide-lipped, and broad-jawed; the hair is either straight or slightly wavy.5 The garment is three-quarter length and the feet appear to be bare. The only arm clearly shown is the left one, and it is ambiguously suggestive of a long lock of hair; but five incised digits at its extremity indicate a hand there. On the statue's right side is the figure of a bird whose feet appear somewhat feline. It has a hooped corona, circular eyes, and a downward-pointing beak. On the reverse of the statue is the indication of a lumpy item appended over the statue's right shoulder; it culminates, just above ground level, in a spherical protuberance. On the statue's left side is a small human figure which is dolichocephalic, round-eyed, broad-lipped, and with a platyrrhine nose. Both arms are indicated there. No feet are visible and the garment appears to be full-length. The headwear is large and layered. The incised circles on the upper chest are conducive to reading the figure as female, however there are four, and evidence for multiple breasts in North African mythology and art is lacking. I suggest that the circles are a pattern in or on the textile. Is the statue a fake? Understandably this question has been asked by some archaeologists on first seeing the figure. However, had it been produced recently with the intention of selling it as an antique, the figure would surely have been made to resemble a style of sculpture that is well-known in the corpus and readily saleable. Also, the ancient Greek inscriptions engraved on it would be likely to have been ones that are translatable. The provenance of the statue somewhere between Tripoli and Tobruk —where it was, probably unexpectedly, excavated by a group of Deutsches Afrika Korps soldiers and then taken with them to Tobruk—is credible.6 Sapper Price was unaware that the statue he brought to Australia had any historical or commercial value. 2 The lithic analysis was undertaken by Emeritus Professor B. Hostetler, the epigraphic tracings are due to Dr B. Ockinga, the photographs to Ms E. Alexakis (all of Macquarie University). I am grateful to all three. Special thanks are due to Emeritus Professor Edwin Judge who arranged for the placement of the statue in the Macquarie Collection of Small Sculpture and to Professor Di Yerbury, Vice-Chancellor, and Curator Errol Davis who accepted it there. 3 A. Laronde was shown the statue when he was in Sydney in 1985 for the First Australian Congress of Classical Archaeology. He expressed the view that the statue may have been severed from a plinth which could have carried further inscriptions. 4 W. Gillon, A Short History of African Art (1984) 82-6, notes with regard to the 'sophisticated' sculptures of the Nok Culture of northern Nigeria—5th century BC to 2nd century ad—that 'The complete figures have disproportionately large heads. In nature the ratio of head to body is about one to seven, whereas in Nok sculptures it is about one to three or four. These are the so-called "African proportions" still used by many tribes and nations proving that, amazingly, African aesthetic traditions extend over 2500 years'. 5 S. Cole, Races of Man (1963) 78, describes the Touareg, a Berber people, as follows: 'the head is large and dolichocephalic, the face long and moderately broad, with high narrow forehead' —these are Touareg who have 'no Negroid admixture'. The width of the statue's jaw, giving the head a near-mesocephalic index, is seen as an iconographie, stylistic feature and will be discussed below. 6 It has been suggested that the DAK soldiers may have taken the statue from a deserted Italian villa in Benghazi. A close look at the official German records for the route-of advance may indicate if this might be possible. According to W. Rutherford (Rommel [1981] 63) 'Rommel ... developed a sort of dilettante preoccupation with archeology largely as a result of having a German archeologist on his staff. Perhaps the statue was not reported to the staff archaeologist: or maybe it was dismissed as 'grotesque'.</page><page sequence="3">A Libyan Athena 83 K M^V ^vjt Front. + HI1K Pt&gt;/V Back.

The inscriptions on the statue.</page><page sequence="4">84 Patricia W. Rovik The use of ancient Greek script suggests that the statue was created at a time when, or in a place where, no Libyan script was available, and that its creator wanted the inscription to be understood by both bilingual Berber and Greeks. Libyan scripts were in use with some Berber by at least the 4th century bc.7 The centuries when ancient Greek was prevalent, then dominant, in Libyan North Africa were the late 7th to the 1st centuries bc. After that, Roman occupation made Latin the dominant language, although in Cyrenaica the use of Greek continued for some time. So, hypothetically one might propose a dating of the statue to the period of Greek dominance or to the immediately following centuries, with other considerations being more exactly determinative. The round object in what may be a bag over the right shoulder of the statue could be a human head. The upper lump cannot be the statue's right arm, but it may be a bunched bag. The bird at the right side of the statue is definitively owl-like. However, owls have clawed feet, so this owl is either standing on little mounds, as is the statue herself, or has feet that are feline; and if so it would be a composite creature. The owl that is most akin to this in present day Libya is the Little Owl (Athene noctua) which has a well-rounded head and a squat body. The small figure at the left side of the statue has a distinctive headdress that may be of iconographie or social significance. It is in three layers—two upper and one beside the o head—which are suggestive of folded textile. My interpretation of the statue is that it is Athena and that, on the reverse, the lower protuberance is the head of Medusa. The creature on the right side of the statuette seems to be an owl, a bird frequently associated with Athena. It is in the habit of standing on small mounds.9 For the little figure on the left side of the statue, alternative interpretations are: Athena in her role of patroness of weaving, or a priest or priestess of the goddess, or a representation of the donor or donors of the statue. The formidable expression on the face of the main figure suggests Athena in a warrior mood, as may be expected when she is carrying the head of Medusa. It is most likely that the statue was produced when Greek language was dominant in Eastern Libya, so the 6th and the 1st centuries bc provide reasonable parameters for determining its date. Some consideration of the mid-Mediterranean world of the final millenia bc is necessary in order to appreciate the antecedence and the milieu of the creators of the Libyan Athena statue. HABITATS AND INHABITANTS Underlying Libyan North Africa are geological formations that have remained mainly stable since Palaeozoic times. The major upward thrust of the Atlas Mountains and the minor upward warping of the Cyrenaican coast are of Late Tertiary and Early Quarternary date. However, the Hoggar and Tibesti massifs are attributed to more recent volcanic action.10 Additionally, C. B. M. McBurney has noted smaller areas of volcanic activity there, and it is one such minor thermal event that A. Albani estimates may have resulted in an outcrop of the 7 E. Fentress in M. Brett-E. Fentress, The Berbers (1996) 37. The possibility of the inscriptions being magical text has been considered and rejected by Dr D. Jordan (pers. comm., 6 Oct. 1999). For this specialist contact, my thanks to Dr N. Hardwick. It has also been suggested that the inscriptions may be Greek-style nonsense script. 8 There is some resemblance between the headwear here and that of the authoritative seated figure from Ghadames, of the 3rd century ad, in O. Bates, The Eastern Libyans (1914) 128, and in D. J. Mattingly, Tripolitania (1994) 30. Regarding the high status of weaving in even the modern Berber household, Fentress (Brett-Fentress op. cit. 240-1 ) notes that the loom is placed on a raised section of the main room; and that 'Weaving is the women's activity which carries the greatest symbolic importance, signifying both the prosperity of a house ... and the skill and application of the women in it'. 9 C.

During the Neolithic, the lithic assemblage of the hunting culture that had been in evidence from the Middle Palaeolithic at the Haua Fteah Cave at Gebel Akhda in coastal Cyrenaica, was significantly replaced with ceramics and adzes, indicative of incipient food production there. As the North African climate has been stable for the past 4,000 years, habitats in lst-millennium bc Libya were similar to those of the present time. After the final pluvial, the subsequent burst of lithic industry and of agricultural activity is thought to have been a response to the worsening environmental conditions. The natural vegetal covering of Libyan North Africa varies from coniferous forest in the Gebel to clumps of scrub and bunched grass in the pre-desert regions; and along the southern limits of the desert lies a zone of steppe and savannah. The forests of Cyrenaica, Tripolitania, and Carthaginia included cypress, olive, and holm-oak; and Libyan fauna during the pluvial maximum included the terrestrial elephant, giraffe, zebra, gnu, antelope, Barbary sheep, and the aquatic hippopotamus, crocodile, warthog, and Lates fish.13 From Libya's avian genera, ostriches appear in the rock art, their eggs were eaten, and the shells were decorated as gifts, but archaeologically little else avian was recorded there.14 However, the Libya Palette of the First Dynasty in Egypt features a tufted owl as the emblem of a captured Libyan city.15 In the final millenniums bc, Berber16 were the people of the whole of the Libyan littoral and the inland, from Marmarica to the Maghreb where there had been intermixture with an earlier indigenous people, the Mekta-Afalou. The prehistorian G. Camps sees a proto-Berber people here as far back as 7000 bc; and in the Capsian sites of ancient southern Tunisia, they made small anthropomorphic sculptures in stone.17 The Berber comprised many tribal groups whose distinct but related languages have survived, with varying success, the subsequent occupations that came from West Asia and from Europe. These occupations, which began in the 8th century with the Phoenician founding of Carthage, led to some integration of the Berber with the Phoenicians, then with the Greeks and the Romans; and only later was there some withdrawal of coastal tribespeople to oases, such as Siwa and Augila in the east, and to the Atlas Mountains in the west. In the Libyan landscape, two elements which have been associated with Athena are the owl (of which the indigenous representative is Athene noctua, subspecies saharae)18 and the olive (Olea africana)}9 The wild olive is said to have originated in Ethiopia and Libya and been 11 Professor Alberto Albani, of the Geology Department at The University of New South Wales (pers. comm., 4 Aug. 1985). He expressed the conviction that the marble used for the statue was not from any of the known ancient quarries of Italy or Greece. According to Hostetler (pers. comm., 8 May 2002), the marble can only have come from a quarry in a contact metamorphic zone. Across a wide swath of northern Africa, from Egypt to Tunisia, these zones occur on a large scale in only one place—north-central Libya. 12 McBurney op. cit. 162; L.

To the Imazighen, I apologize. 17 Fentress (Brett-Fentress op. cit. [n. 7] 11-12) is troubled by Camps seeing these people as 'proto-Berber', but is satisfied with their being designated as 'proto Mediterranean'. 18 Kônig-Weick-Becking op. cit.

However, until further palaeobotanical evidence is available for North Africa, West Asia, and Southern Europe, the place of origin and of first cultivation of the tree will remain a matter for rival claims and continued conjecture. Certainly the Siwa Oasis, Cyrenaica and, during the last pluvial, near Lake Tritonis are areas where Olea africana may have been cultivated earliest in North Africa. Olea nubica, indigenous to Ethiopia, was cultivated in Egypt.20 There is an element of the Libyan faunal-floral landscape which was associated with the Libyan goddess Neith in her Egyptian contexts: this is the Lates fish. It is a large silver-white fish; and Neith was called 'Goddess Neith of the Lates' in an Edfu Temple text and subsequently in a text at Esna—which is also known as Latopolis—and later in Ptolemaic Sais.21 El-Sayed regrets that there is little iconographie or textual elucidation of what was apparently a Nilotic cult of Neith as goddess of the Lates; he notes that near Ghurob in the south, there is a cemetery of Lates close to the Temple of Neith of the Acacia—the tree from which her emblematic bow and crossed arrows were made. NEITH—NIT—NEIT Libyan Neith was worshipped in Egypt from the 4th millennium bc. Her standard appears in Predynastic Upper Egypt,22 and many of the theophoric names in the First Dynasty, including those of four royal women, carry her name.23 Apart from her southern temple at Esna, a temple was built to honour Neith at Sais in the Nile Delta. This temple eventually became her principal one in the north. It was rebuilt many times and was flourishing when visited by Herodotus in the 5th century bc, by Plutarch in the 1st century ad, and later by Proclus in the 5th century.24 Neith was credited with being autogenic, androgynous, and parthenogenic;25 the claim that she was 'all that was, is, and will be' continued into the fifth millennium of her worship at Sais. Neith was the Egyptians' goddess of warfare, and one reading of her name is 'the terrifying'. In her role as Egypt's gentle goddess of weaving, she was said to create the cosmic web of eternity. In the conflict of Seth versus Horus, twice at crucial moments Neith was called upon to give judgement. The wisdom of her verdict in favour of Horus yet compensating Seth was a minor moment in the hearing, but a significant one. Her advice was eventually adopted and it resolved this eighty-year-long dispute. The two most frequently seen symbols of the goddess Neith are crossed arrows, often on a shield, and a weaver's shuttle. In a depiction of four Tjehemu Libyans in the Tomb of Seti I of the early 13th century bc, each has a tattoo of a full or a modified shuttle (fig. 2). The appearance of these men is interesting for a number of features: ostrich feathers rise from their elaborately plaited hair, they wear highly-patterned long straight robes with a side-split, and two of the four appear to have a platyrrhine nose. 20 Ibid. Amongst statements about the origin of the olive and the earliest production of olive oil are those by D. P. Bertini (Olive Growing and Processing [1960] 5). He credits the Oasis of Zeus Ammon with the earliest cultivation; he then notes the claim that this honour is said to belong instead to the Phoenicians. J. Connell, 'History and Scope of the Olive Industry', Olive Production Manual (1994) 1, says that Syria in 3000 bc was engaged in olive cultivation and the oil trade. 21 R. el-Sayed, La déesse Neith de Sais, Vol. I (1982) 27-8. 22 'Neith'website (http//www.geocities.com/skhmt_netjert/ neith.html).

LIBYANS AND GREEKS After the founding of Cyrene in 631 bc, then of Barce, Euhesperides, Teuchira, and Apollonia, the interactions between Greek settlers and Berber tribespeople were more co operative than acrimonious. The 5th-century law at Athens that citizenship was restricted to people whose parents were both Athenian was unknown in Cyrene where, according to R. J. Littman, marriages between citizens and non-citizens 'were legal and frequent and the interaction of native peoples with the colonists was considerable'.27 Later when skirmishes took place, as A. Laronde has noted, they were most often between settler communities, of Greeks and Berbers, and the nomadic herder communities who objected, in times of environmental crisis, to being excluded from previous pastorage.28 The nomads however had a long-established dominance in the oases of the northern Sahara.29 Who were the tribespeople to the south, the east, and the west of the Greek Pentapolis, centred on Cyrene? Throughout the region, there were the Berber—of oil-of-olive complexion, some black-haired, some fair-haired, and with brown, green, or grey eyes. These characteristics were still apparent when the poet Callimachus of Cyrene wrote, in the 3rd century bc, of 'the golden women of Libya' with whom the colonizing Dorians loved to dance. By the time Libyan tribespeople figured in the Egyptian historical records, some integration of Berber with southern peoples was already manifest due to the trade routes through the oases and the Fezzan to Nubia, to the nomadic herders in the savannahs, and to the Niger. This integration must have become apparent not only in the physiognomy of the Berber but also in their life-style. 27 R. J. Littman, The Greek Experiment.

Rovik Tjehenu, Tjehemu, Ribu/Libu, and Meshwesh—words used in Egyptian texts of the 2nd millennium bc to differentiate Libyan tribes and subgroups—do not appear in Herodotus' list of sometimes descriptive terms for fourteen Libyan tribes of the 5th century.31 Nevertheless, 'Libu' had come into Greek usage as a term for Africans west of Egypt, and had given the name 'Libya' to the country and 'Libyan Sea' to the Mediterranean between North Africa and Crete. The association of Greeks with Libya had been indicated long in advance of Herodotus' remarkable ethnography and even of the colonization at Cyrene. In the mid-2nd millenniu bc, Mediterranean traders sailed between Kommos in Crete, Libyan Marmarica, Cyprus, Kas in Lycia, and back to Crete, on a constant counter-clockwise sea-route (fig. 3).32 There had been Odysseus and his Trojan War comrades who landed by chance on the Libyan coast and had temporarily become lotophagi; and there were Menelaus and Helen for whom Libya was a vacation-tour choice.33 Some generations earlier, in fable if not fact, the Argonauts' craft had been washed inland from the Libyan coast to Lake Tritonis, and they had to take the assistance of the guardian of the lake in order to be returned to the sea for their voyage home.34 Earlier still, according to Apollodorus, King Danaus and his fifty daughters had D,T£ri?anean SEA .Derna Haua Fteah TURKEY % t&gt; Cape Gelidonya Kas \f ■ &lt;*^3 CYPRUS 0 100 200km 1 i 1 Cyrenaica LIBYA Marsa Matruh ■agSp* Alexandria^ EGYPT &gt; Jerusalem Figure 3.

Greek awareness of Libyan dress and appearance was evidenced in art such as the early 7th-century funerary amphora from Eleusis showing the Gorgons pursuing Perseus—they wear long straight gowns split on the side.36 On a late 6th-century krater now in the Louvre, Euphronios has depicted Heracles wrestling with the Libyan Antaeus whom he represents with fair hair; and Pindar refers to the many suitors for 'the famous fair-haired daughter of Antaios'.37 Even if one discounts, as some archaeologists do, the assertion by Sir Arthur Evans in his Palace of Minos that the beehive tombs of Early Minoan Crete are 'classical "mapalia" or round huts of the historic Libyans'38 —an assertion supported by S. Xanthoudides, J. D. S. Pendlebury, and S. Alexiou, but refuted by K. Branigan39—it is reasonable to hypothesize that there were Libyans among the residents of Mesaran Crete. Influence from Libyan and Egyptian North Africa on 3rd- and 2nd-millennium Crete and Greece is sometimes apparent.40 A further, perhaps more challenging, hypothesis is that the goddess who was chosen by a Greek city as their patroness, against a rival claim by Poseidon, and for whom the city was named 'Athenai' in her honour, was the Libyan Berber goddess Neith whose name became A-TA-NA when expressed reverentially retrograde.41 With this premise the Pelasgians perhaps, certainly Herodotus and Plato, agree 42 It should be less surprising that goddess Neith could have been adopted by the Greeks at a distance of 1,800 km from Libya's Lake Tritonis than that she had been adopted by Egyptians of the Upper Nile at 2,700 km distance. The date of Neith's incorporation into the incipient Egyptian pantheon was the Predynastic of the later 4th millennium bc. A putative date for Neith-Athena entering the pre-Hellenic Greek pantheon is the early to mid-3rd millennium bc. Gradually Athena was Hellenized, and by the 6th century she appears on Corinthian vases wearing a Corinthian helmet; soon she is shown in full modern armour, but with a Libyan aegis, and sometimes with a representation of the Medusa on it or on her battle shield as an apotropaic protome.43 In the Egyptianizing of Neith, it is her appearance at the Fifth-Dynasty Sun Temple of Userkaf, then at Sais, wearing the Red Crown of Lower Egypt, that may be thought of as a beginning—it was with this crown that she was thenceforth seen frequently. 35 Apollod. Bibl. II 1:4. Others, such as Herodotus (II 171), have Danaus and his daughters emigrate to the Peloponnese from Egypt. 36 For a good illustration of the scene see, e.g., K.

Libyan mapalia were noted by Pliny (HN XVI 178); and Brett-Fentress op. cit. (n. 7) pi. 7: 1 shows mapalia in common use by nomadic Berber of the present time. 40 K. P. Foster, 'Snakes and Lions', Expedition 30/2, 1988, 18-20. 41 J. Chadwick, The Mycenaean World (1976) 88. Chadwick records here the earliest known reference to a goddess Athena in a Greek text: Knossos tablet V 52. Names that are later frequently inscribed retrograde on Greek vases are 'Zeus' and 'Athena'. On the late 6th-century bç calyx-krater by Euphronios, his principal vase of the scene with Sarpedon being carried from the battlefield (N.Y. MMA 1972.11.10), there are six figures on the obverse including Hermes; all are named but only 'Thanatos' is inscribed retrograde. 42 Hdt. II 58-61; PI. 77. 21e. Poseidon, according to Hdt. II50, is indubitably a Libyan deity. 43 E.g., LIMC II (1984) 960 s.v. Athena nos. 28, 29 (Demargne). On the red-fig. Attic pelike Louvre G 233 (ibid, no. 31) Athena bears in her right hand an olive branch, which reminds us of the fact that the tree was propagated in ancient times not by seed but from a piece, preferably of an old tree (Bertini op. cit. [n. 20] 75). Athena appears here alone and from the right, as on Panathenaic amphorae; this indicates that she is coming from afar, and I would suggest Lake Tritonis as her point of departure.</page><page sequence="10">90 Patricia W. Rovik FROM TJEHEMU TO WODAABE During the New Kingdom in Egypt, it was said to be the Tjehenu who lived in Marmarica; possibly the Meshwesh and the Libu lived in Cyrenaica.44 However it is the Tjehemu whom O. Bates noted as the inhabitants of the easternmost oases of Libya, and it is their dress style that has a remarkable modern equivalence 45 The Wodaabe, a present-day nomadic people who move between the Sudan, Chad, the Niger, and northern Nigeria, have an annual Geerewol ceremony for which the male attire in one event is almost identical to that of the Tjehemu Libyans as seen in the Tomb of Seti I. M. van Offelen has noted this 'striking resemblance to plumed yaake dancers' of the Tjehemu as depicted there.46 The Wodaabe pride themselves on having maintained their ancient traditions, with minimal variations through time. Should it be thought unlikely that the wearing of these patterned robes with a side-split, combined with ostrich feathers in the hair, could have persisted through three millenniums, it is salutary to recall McBurney recounting in 1960 the 'unique discovery of a pile of large, carefully finished stone spheres' at a Middle Paleolithic site in southern Tunisia. He commented that 'it is a curious fact that among the present Berber of the area, a superstitious ... practice survives which finds expression in arranging similar piles of stone spheres'.47 There is a less extensive time-span between the present-day Wodaabe and 6th-century bc Cyrene; and among the yaake dancers, those men who do not wear ostrich plumes wear hats, mostly of a conical shape with a knob on top or a more decorative pinnacle. Such a hat quite unlike a Greek petasos—is worn by King Arkesilas while he superintends the silphium weighing, as seen on a Laconian cup of the mid-6th century. Bates had suggested that the AO Arkesilas hat had a Saharan origin—from where, he was unsure. The. Wodaabe provide the answer, and a continuing connection between them and the Berber is evidenced by the annual sharing of their Worso ceremony with the Berber Touareg people. It is an association that may be of considerable antiquity. Some years ago, Libyan Tifinagh script of the ancient Touareg was recorded from rocks at Wadi el-Agial—in the course of the Fezzan Project 2000—at this Garamantian site to the south of Tripoli.49 During Greek colonization of Libya, cultural influence was flowing in both directions, and it is evident that some Berbers had become assimilated into Cyrenaican Greek religious life when, as O. Masson has noted, names which are recognizably Libyan appear in Greek lists of priestesses.50 Ammon was a powerful North African deity and in the 1st millennium bc, he was the principal one. The integration of Zeus with Ammon seems to have occurred early. The depiction of Zeus with ram's horns on the handsome Cyrenian coins, and the designation of Siwa as an oracle site for Zeus Ammon, are evidence for a reciprocity of cultural influence there.51 It was at the Siwa Oases that the Hellenized Athena, according to some accounts, was born from the head of Zeus. Others have the birth take place at Lake Tritonis.52 Herodotus, as well 44 D. O'Connor, 'The Earliest Pharaohs in the University Museum', Expedition 29/3, 1987,35. 45 Bates op. cit.

Whether one</page><page sequence="11">A Libyan Athena 91 as Pausanias later, noted that Athena was originally said to be the daughter of Poseidon and Tritonis, the goddess of the lake; but she quarrelled with Poseidon and offered herself instead to Zeus. In the remaking of Athena and the discarding of her Libyanness, Metis became her procreative mother but Zeus was her 'birth mother', and Athena leapt from his head, fully armed and dancing the Pyrrhic. Athena, like Neith, was sometimes thought of as androgynous. Apart from her prowess in battle, Athena was skilled at weaving—a craft for which she r o was the patron deity—and at the trial of Orestes, she showed wisdom and forbearance. Her verdict at it brought about an eventual resolution of that long-running case. Her role there was akin to that of Neith at the contention of Horus and Seth. With the Berber of the region of Lake Tritonis—and also perhaps for those of Tripolitania, Syrtica, Cyrenaica, Marmarica, and the oases sites—their ancient goddess, who was known as Neith in Egypt and as Athena among the Greeks, was fêted annually at the lake with a ceremonial battle. MAINTENANCE OF A MYTH Myths of warrior Berber women are strong amongst present-day Berber.54 Earlier, there may have been stories to live by still recounted at the time of the making of the Libyan Athena statue. In 1997, in a brief article on Libyan 'Amazons', A. Siraj regretted that little has been done to record the many myths that survive.55 In 1996, E. Fentress had given space in The Berbers to the well-attested prophetess Kahina whose troops fought in the late 7th century ad against the incoming army from West Asia; and she also noted there the earlier, eponymous Touareg Queen Tin Hinan, an unusually tall Targui—only mythically a warrior—of the 5th century ad.56 The tomb of Tin Hinan at Abelessa had no weaponry, unlike the tomb of a 4th-century bc warrior woman of the eastern Black Sea region, as recorded by K. F. Smirnov.57 The question of warrior women in early Mediterranean myth and history is indeed yet to be fully addressed and, apart from Siraj, Bates too evidenced an interest in the topic; in an uncharacteristically unreferenced footnote, he mentioned as significant 'the fractured forearms of Predynastic Egyptian women'—with relevance to Neith and to ritual sham fights to bring on rain, akin to the Tritonis region women's ceremonial battle.58 References to Amazon women in Mediterranean myths site them in three regions: Libya, the Black Sea, and Syria-Palestine.59 It seems that the earliest of the mythical warrior women may have been in Libya, the birthplace of Neith, where Heracles is said to have defeated the Libyan Gorgons and Amazons before founding the city of Capsa en route to Spain to perform translates Y^dDKOlii as grey, grey-green, or blue is a matter of interpretative choice. 53 Aesch. Eum. 767-8; Eur. IT 1471-81. 54 At the 'Libya' website (http://www.myrine.at/ Berber/berber.html&gt;History&gt;The Amazons from Libya&gt;The Berber) the similarity between the Berber word 'Amazigh' and the Greek word 'Amazon' is noted (15 Jan. 2002). 'Amazigh' means 'a Berber' and 'Berber' as an adjective. 55 A. Siraj, 'La Libyenne dans la mythologie antique: à propos du mythe des Amazones', AntAfr 33,1997,67-73. 56 Brett-Fentress op. cit. (n. 7) 206-8. 57 'Une "Amazone" du IVe siècle avant n.è. sur le territoire du Don', trans. T. de Sonneville-David, DialHistAnc 8, 1982, 121-41. 58 Bates op. cit. (n. 8) 204-5 n. 1. Whereas Bates sees the fractures as due to sham fights or 'war dances' to bring on rain, they could also have been the result of fractured shield arms in ceremonial battles to honour a deity, similar to that described in Htd. IV 179. 59 Designation of these women as 'mythical' has a long tradition in Greço-Roman studies and I am here merely following that tradition. Socrates, however, after his discourse with Phaedrus on the Oreithya-and-Boreas myth (PI. Phdr. 229 b-d) also lists as incredible: Centaurs, the Chimaera, Oorgons, and Pegasus, but Amazons are noticeably not included there.</page><page sequence="12">92 Patricia W. Rovik his tenth labour, the securing of Geryon's cattle.60 Myrrhine, who commanded the Amazons of Syria-Palestine, joined forces, according to Diodorus Siculus, with the Libyan Amazons for a number of forays. It is only the Libyan warrior women, however, who appear to have done battle with other warrior women; and whereas they seem to pre-date, in their warrior ways, those bands further east, they too eventually disappear into the prevalent patriarchal life style. When Medusa showed disrespect for Athena by bedding with Poseidon in Athena's temple at Lake Tritonis, Athena sought revenge—as would be expected by the ancient warrior code. Is the story of Medusa and Neith/Athena that of two warrior queens of a euhemerist early Libya? TRIBAL FOCUS To which of the Libyan peoples listed by Herodotus may the sponsor(s) and the sculptor(s) of the statuette representing Libyan Athena have belonged? It is of interest that the style of the work is traditionally African, with 'African proportions', as seen also in the Cyrenaican Slonta Cave figures carved into the limestone there.61 For that segment of Libya from Tobruk to Tripoli, Herodotus lists the Asbystae, Auchisae, Bacales, Nasamones, the Garamantes inland, the Macae, and the Gindanes. However, of special significance are the Auseans of the Lake Tritonis region, further west, whose ceremonial battle by women was enthusiastically described by Herodotus. He also recounts other rituals by the Auseans 'to honour their native deity—which is the same as our Greek Athena'. Apart from Tritonis, it is Cyrenaica, Syrtica, and Tripolitania that remain a primary area of focus, as the statue was seemingly excavated somewhere in this territory. However, the somewhat Naucratian style of the Greek script on the statue, noted by G. Tanner in 1990, indicates that eastern Libyans, as well, have reason to be considered as likely creators of the statue.63 It is perhaps relevant that it was to Cyrene that Pharaoh Amasis sent a statue of Neith, in the 6th century bc after he came to the throne in Sais. As Amasis considered himself under Neith's protection, his serekh had a shuttle at its centre.64 The tribes of East Libyan Marmarica mentioned by Herodotus were the Egyptianized Adyrmachidae and the Giligamae, and inland there were the Ammonians of the Siwa and Augila oases. The tattoos of the previously noted four Tjehemu males indicate a deference to the deity who, in Egypt, was known as 'the Libyan' and for whom the shuttle was the Libyan emblem of eternal life. According to Bates, Tjehemu were dominant throughout the Eastern oases region. In the far west of Eastern Libya, the Auseans, as noted, held ceremonies in honour of a deity whom we may perhaps equate with Neith. These ceremonies, however, owed much, by the 5th century bc, to direct Greek contact; and whereas battling between women even for a festivity was not a Greek habit, the dressing of the specially chosen woman in a Corinthian helmet and full armour shows a desire to emulate the Athena of Greece. The chariot in which 60 Diod. Ill 55. In 5th-century bc outer Libya, the Zaueces women who customarily drove war chariots (Hdt. IV 193), and in inner Libya the sexual and marital freedom of some women, such as the Nasamones, Gindanes, and Auseans, is the only evidence for a possible earlier warrior life style. 61 A critical comparison of the style of the Athena figure with the figures in the Slonta Sanctuary of highland Cyrenaica will perhaps be undertaken in the future. M. Luni, 'II Santuario rupestre libyo del le "Immagini" a Slonta (Cirenaica)', Quaderni di Archeologia della Libya, 12: Cirene e i Libyi (1987)415-8, suggests a Roman date for this complex; and Bates op. cit. 129 had done likewise. However, Fentress (Brett-Fentress op. cit. [n. 7] 35-6) sees the sanctuary as of Hellenistic date. 62 Hdt. IV 179-80. It is to Herodotus that one turns on matters of ethnography for this period as there is no similar source. His reliability may sometimes be queried, perhaps due to his having had an informant who was unreliable. 63 Pers. comm. (9 Nov. 1990). 64 Bates op. cit. 207 n. 1; Hdt. II 182.</page><page sequence="13">A Libyan Athena 93 the 'special one' was driven around Lake Tritonis may have been of local derivation as was her aegis—the one item of Libyan dress still worn by Hellenized Athena.65 Between the two territorial extremities of Tritonis and Siwa, it is likely that the same deities were worshipped in a pantheon that included Ammon and Neith. Possibly individual cults existed for each tribe. Of the aforementioned tribes listed by Herodotus, only the Asbystae, Nasamones, and the Garamantes are mentioned as having four-horse chariots—and only the Zaueces, west of the Auseans, as having chariot-driving women. S. Stucchi sees the epic journey to the Niger by five young men of the Nasamones as being 'before the more generalized diffusion of the chariot among the other Libyans' in the 5th century bc.66 When more widely established contacts by four-horse vehicles such as these had been made, the carrying—if from afar—of a piece of marble large enough for a plinth-and-statuette would have become easier than before. Who is likely to have arranged for this dedicatory statuette? No doubt it could have been any of the Libyan worshippers of goddess Neith/Athena. I have no definitive answer to this pivotal question, merely some further questions. Would the aim of the Asbystae to 'emulate the Cyrenians,' aided by their ownership of four-horse chariots, encourage them to fulfil this role? Would the special ceremonies carried out by the Auseans in the birthplace of Athena indicate that they are the most likely people to have commissioned and installed the statue? If so, the fact that the statue appears to have been set up closer to Cyrene than to Tritonis suggests a missing narrative. Neither of the two most active tribes of the focus area have so far been proffered as a possibility; yet it would indeed be reasonable to credit either the Nasamones or the Garamantes with organizing this sculptural enterprise. However, the epigraphic style of the inscriptions is evidence of considerable significance. The Ammonians of the oases, or expatriate in the Delta including Sais itself, and who were formerly known as the Tjehemu, may indeed have fulfilled the patronage role. Like the identification of the marble source, the identity of the creators of the statue nevertheless remains a matter for other archaeologists to determine. Returning to the statue itself, in the context in which it was found and taking into account the use of Greek for the inscriptions, it may be seen as Athena rather than as Neith.67 Antecedent to it, sculpturally, is the fine anthropomorphic stone head from Tabelbalet, Tassili n'Ajjer.68 The topknot at the front of Athena's head has an equivalence in similar protrusions on sculpted heads of heroic Borama males of present-day Ethiopia. Herodotus says only of the Auseans that they let their hair grow on the front of their heads, but he may have meant the Libyan forehead fringe.69 The slight thrust of the statue's chin is a feature even more emphasized in the sculpture in metal of the great god of war Gû in the court art of Dahomey, and in the Jenne terracotta figures of the llth-13th-centuries ad West Sudanese culture. Also the inscriptions on, rather than under, the Libyan Athena figure have a parallel in the Sabaean inscriptions on the lion god of Aksum in Ethiopia—sculpted in stone and dated to about 1500 bc.70 65 Hdt. IV 188-9. Zeus is the other Greek deity who sometimes wears the aegis; and, as Herodotus says, it is an item of Libyan women's dress, Zeus' use of it seems somewhat inappropriate. Bates op. cit. 128 n. 3 comments that the aegis, presently called 'raht' in Libya, is worn not only by the women of Libya but also by women in Sudan and Nubia. 66 S. Stucchi, 'Problems Concerning the Coming of the Greeks to Cyrenaica and the Relations with their Neighbours', Meditarch 2,1989,83. 67 In 1985, when I showed the statue to A.

Rovïk The small figure on the left side of the statue has a possibly Egyptianizing element. Its striated headwear is akin to the aura above some sculpted deities; this would suggest that it represents the goddess as Cosmic Weaver. In North Africa today, many women, and some men, wear layered headwear and these include the Wodaabe-Fulani women. They are deft embroiderers of the men's and their own festive garments; and among the traditional embroidery designs, all of which have meanings, the design for 'encampment' is rows of circles—such as those on the top of the gown of this small figure (fig. 4).71 Significantly, rows of circles may be noted on the robes of the first and third of the four Tjehemu males in the Tomb of Seti I. The platyrrhine nose of the Libyan Athena and of the small side-figure indicate people with a sub-Saharan admixture. With regard to Greek Athena herself, she was black-haired and—as was said often—with flashing grey eyes. EPILOGUE This has been merely an introduction of the statue and a review of its antecedence, its milieu, and its people. The exact source of the marble of the statue remains to be determined, the inscriptions are yet to be deciphered and translated, about the identity of its creators there is conjecture, and for it there is no definitive date. Sixty years after her voyage from North Africa to Australia, the Libyan Athena is now—again—in the public domain, where her gallery name is 'The Libyan Athene'. oinding read cùrpl&amp;ne Snake S&amp;ndal Figure 4.
