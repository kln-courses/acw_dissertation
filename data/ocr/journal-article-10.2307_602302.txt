<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ARTICLE PROBLEMS OF METHOD IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY AND ART HISTORY OF THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST EDITH PORADA COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY This review article contains a discussion by an archaeologist-art historian of present orientations which attempt to impose upon archaeology standards of precision attainable in the "hard sciences." These attitudes result in a downgrading of the individual work of art as a source of knowledge. The chief example for the application of new methods is the Repertoire analytiques des cylindres whose shortcomings are caused by lack of concern for the individual seals, but which is nevertheless an important new tool for the future. THIS ARTICLE BEGAN AS AN EVALUATION of the computer- based analytical repertory of cylinder seals published in Paris in 1975, here called Repertoire,' which is one of the most ambitious and-in my opinion-most promising undertakings of archaeology today. In that long review I took issue with some of the basic new concepts concerning the compilation of archaeological materials which had been applied to the Repertoire and caused some of its shortcomings. The Editor of the JA OS therefore asked me to transform the review into an article in which the discussion of the theoretical concepts involved would precede their application in the Repertoire. These theoretical concepts were developed by the brilliant Jean-Claude Gardin, the driving force behind the Repertoire. One of his early works was the publication of the pottery and coins found at Lashkari Bazar and Bust in Afghanistan.2 In working on this publication he realized that the research articles dispersed in a vast array of periodicals and books needed to be organized in more easily accessible and manage- able form. At this time he doubtless formed also some of his other ideas which have surfaced in his theoretical writings of the past three decades and which are summarized in his latest ' Franqoise Digard avec la collaboration de C. Abellard, L. Bourelly, J. Deshayes, J.-C. Gardin, J. Le Maitre, M.-R. Salom&amp;, Repertoire analvtique des cvlindres orientaux publies dans des sources hibliographiques eparses (sur ordinateur).

In addition to the interest of its text, Gardin's book is therefore an excellent guide to this literature. In the last sections he gives his guidelines for future archae- ological publications. He defines "archaeology" as the sum of studies bearing on material objects which may throw some light, in conjunction with other data, on the history and way of life of ancient peoples (specific events, daily activities, institutions, beliefs, etc.) (p. 5). His term "construction" designates "any written text presented as a unit in the archaeological literature...." These constructions are divided into "works of compilation, in which the primary goal is to disclose materials hitherto unpublished or not easily accessible, while the other group is made up of more speculative texts meant to diffuse new ideas on various aspects of life in ancient times (technology, symbolic functions, social organization, etc.) grounded in the study of material remains." Of course, he is aware of the existing connection between the two poles. No decent cata- logue of archaeological materials can be drawn without reference to the context and significance of the materials contained, nor is a theoretical treatise without factual data likely to be of lasting value. Gardin's goal is "to reformulate 3 Jean-Claude Gardin, Archaeological Constructs; an As- pect of Theoretical Archaeology, Cambridge University Press, 1980. The book was also published in French, Une archeologie theorique, Paris, 1979, and has received appropriate acclaim and extensive reviews by R. Ginoves and Anne-Marie Guimier-Sorbets in Revue archeologique, (1981), 87-96, and by F. Hours in Eudes, 352/2 (Feb., 1980). Here mainly those points will be mentioned on which I take issue with Gardin. 501</page><page sequence="2">502 Journal of the American Oriental Society 102.3 (1982) archaeological constructions in order to come closer to the requirements of logical thinking" (p. 15). One of the most admirable aspects of the book is the tightness and clarity of its structure. Every major topic is set off by a heading, with main points which appear in the first paragraph and are then enlarged upon in the text which follows. This is a fundamental change from the method of presentation of scholarly matter during the first half of the century, in which arguments concerning a topic were sum- moned to build up gradually to a conclusion.4 One would wish that Gardin, in addition to demanding logic and rigor in publications of the future had added a request for a lucid presentation. Writing as he does, he would take this for granted. Unfortunately, the American theoretical elite often uses a terminology limited to the small field of its specific research, without making any effort at explaining it for the non-theoretical archaeologist, like myself; probably because we, the people who excavate, draw, photograph, describe and record, are considered to be at a lower level of scholarship than those concerned with the "cognitive aspects of archae- ology"-an opinion to which Gardin also ascribes, as he states repeatedly in his writings. Gardin's attitude in this respect is consonant with his treatment of works of art to which he refuses the status of a special category among archaeological remains in Archae- ological Constructs (p. 4). This is entirely logical in view of his advocacy of minimalist strategies of description (p. 139) which are inadequate for works of art. These deserve as full a description, that is a visual analysis, as the writer can provide. Such a description can only be made after a long and intensive exposure to the work, from which the writer derives joy and experiences a growth of knowledge. Such a perception of art is thus not only an intellectual but also a sensual and emotional experience and the source of many of our insights. 4 The realization of this change reminded me of the advice A. Leo Oppenheim gave me in 1946 with regard to organizing my Seal Impressions of Nluzi by summarizing the results of the study at the beginning of the book because "people no longer have time to wade through the entire text to find out what has been learnt. For those who are interested, you present the material in the subsequent chapters." However, when I presented a manuscript written according to Oppenheim's stricture to the American Schools of Oriental Research for their 24th Annual, I was asked by Albrecht Goetze, Millar Burrows and Abe Sachs to rewrite the text "in the manner of a scholarly presentation, placing the material before the reader and drawing the conclusions at the end." Today, this leisurely buildup of the evidence has been aban- doned under the very pressure of time which Oppenheim sensed a generation ago. In the resulting description, the writer acquaints the reader with the work, prepares him for the recognition of the style, and in some cases even for the interpretation of the icono- graphy. Such a description would not fit into Gardin's system; hence, it had to be left out. A minor issue concerning the descriptions of works of ancient art, which nevertheless deserves to be mentioned in defense of this method, is the occasional stimulus they may provide for scholars outside the field. To cite one example: in the description of the scene on a Middle Assyrian cylinder seal, found by Patricia Bikai at Tyre,5 I mentioned "a table decked with a cloth and perhaps two cakes in the shape of temple towers...." I made no special point about these cakes and did not even repeat the statement made in the first publication of that cylinder,6 that the cakes resembled a larger such object on a table in a scene on the White Obelisk.7 Yet, Nicholas Postgate and Stephanie Dalley wrote to me about the cakes and I quote from Dr. Dalley's letter of Nov. 20, 1981, "Such cakes are found in the Middle Assyrian text VS 19 33 commented on by Postgate in BiOr 37, 1980, p. 68 made of linseed/sesame. In a Neo-Assyrian text from Nimrud, which we are editing together, we have a profession, which is probably to be read LU sa ziqqurdtesu, the 'man responsible for temple-tower shaped cakes'." Without my verbal descrip- tion, neither scholar would have noticed this feature, which had long been visible in reproductions of the tower-shaped cake of the White Obelisk. Not only does this correspondence of a detail in the representation of the White Obelisk with a Middle Assyrian text add another indication for the much discussed Middle Assyrian date of the pictorial part of the Obelisk, but the fact that the cylinder seal design can be shown to portray an actual object, perhaps of ritual signifi- cance, is important because there is little evidence available to assess the relation of the seal designs to the material culture of their period. In sum, the perception and description of a work of art seems to me to be among the most important functions of an archaeologist, which he can do best if he draws and photo- graphs the object himself, supposedly non-"cognitive" tasks, which do not enter at all into the discussions of Archaeolog- ical Constructs. In actuality, drawing and photographing an object forces the viewer to follow the artist's creation in every detail and to discover features which might have been missed otherwise. This intimate association with the object also 5 E. Porada in Akkadica, 13 (May-August, 1979), 9. 6 Patricia M. Bikai, The Potter}' of Tilre, Warminster, 1978, Appendix A by E.

Gombrich called "imaginative participa- tion"8 which one has to attain in order to understand and properly interpret a work of art. That such interpretations are usually based on very limited evidence and are therefore easily faulted, is shown by Gardin in the one section in which he discusses art at any length. He shows up the deficiencies in an analysis of a Seljuk relief in the Konya Museum of the twelfth to thirteenth century A.D. by J.-P. Roux. Among other short- comings, Gardin points out Roux's failure to mention that the seated man "holds the chin of the man standing in front of him" (p. I 12).9 Gardin's demand for precision in the interpre- tation of works of art seems to me unrealistic as are many of the postulates in Archaeological Constructs. He requires that the thought process, by which results in archaeology are obtained, become an object of scholarly focus. In my opinion this may detract from the primary purpose of gaining new insights into an aspect of archaeology.'? The Repertoire was an early creation of Gardin's, the direction of which he passed on to Franqoise Digard. But the idea and the method had been worked out in some detail before the project was set in motion. The work consists in an analysis of the representations on cylinder seals for the purpose of deriving comparanda from the computerized items. Over 4,600 cylinders are reproduced with photographs or drawings on cards, sizes 7.50 x 12.50 cm, which fill two boxes. The cards are exactly of the right size and consistency for easy handling, which is an achievement worth mentioning. x Sir Ernst Gombrich, "Focus on the Arts and Humanities," Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 35 (Jan. 1982), 21. 9 Perhaps Roux did not mention the gesture especially because it was common in Turkey. I take it to be the same as that portrayed in a relief at Medinet Habu (W. Wolf, Die Kunst Agyptens, Stuttgart, 1957, p. 589, Fig. 591), showing Ramesses III stroking one of his harem girls under the chin, a gesture which reflects both endearment and familiarity. This is the basic meaning expressed in the Austrian vernacular, das Goderl kratzen, which has come to mean flattery in a secondary stage of the expression. '0 Fortunately, Gardin's own publications have none of the theoretical overburden which he calls for in Archaeological Constructs. On the contrary, one of his most recent articles (with P. Gentelle) is a must for every scholar dealing with the pre-islamic art and archaeology of ancient Bactria (Bulletin de l 'cole Fran oise d'Extrime Orient, 66, [1979], 1-29). It explains the ebb and flow of wealth in that region by the varying exploitation of the soil, which he ascribes to the amount or lack of effort put into irrigation projects by the population of the area. The code for the computer is contained in Volume 2 and an explanation of the code's terminology appears in Volume 3. The introduction and some of the results of the work with the Repertoire are found in Volume 1. In the catalogue are assembled seals from small collections and scattered articles published to about 1960 (Volume 1, p. 19). Bibliographical lists in Volume 1, pages 250-320, form an index for the catalogue cards. Regardless of the quality of the repro- ductions, which is generally poor (due partly to the often poorly reproduced originals), the catalogue alone makes the work a valuable acquisition for research on seals by a specialist. Since the code was devised to find not only single items, which any traditional index would yield, but groupings of figures or objects, a system had to be found to label such groupings. This was done by applying a grammatical termi- nology to the figures in a scene, of which one became the subject, the other the object of the scene. The entire repertory of the scenes was divided into three zones. The first was called 'Thzmatique' and comprises the relation of the iconographical elements to each other, as well as their distribution in the field. The second zone covers animate beings, the third inanimate elements. In a fourth zone, called 'Glyptique', the non-iconographical features are assembled. Within the zones the iconography is arranged as follows: Zone I: (1) beings and cases, (2) actions, (3) syntax, (4) number, (5) configuration; Zone II: (6) personages, (7) an- imals, (8) hybrids, (9) orientation of the figures, (10) postures, (11) gestures; Zone III: (12) garments, (13) hairdress, (14) attributes, (15) structures, (16) seats, (17) other pieces of furniture, (18) receptacles, (19) tools, (20) weapons, (21) emblems, (22) plants, (23) details, (24) nature: earth and waves, (25) nature: sky, (26) ornaments, (27) indeterminate designs, (28) orientation, and (29) manner of carrying an object. The fourth Zone, Glyptique comprises (30) seal in- scriptions, (31) the cylinder, (32) provenance, and (33) dating. The last two items merely contain brief explanations for the use of the Repertoire. The terminology, together with the explanations given in the commentary contained in Volume 3 of the Repertoire should be studied by everyone working with descriptions of cylinder seals. Their precision and brevity are obviously the result of long, careful thought and should be imitated as far as possible. However, the explanations are not easy to follow and require much concentration. The possible uses of the Repertoire are demonstrated in about 1500 subjects of research, which were formulated as questions put to the data bank of the Repertoire, written out in brief sentences for the benefit of persons not familiar with the "meta-language" of the computer. There are numerous questions to which the answers provide valuable iconographic information in the seal designs listed as including the relevant</page><page sequence="4">504 Journal of the American Oriental Society 102.3 (1982) items. I have not checked one question without being made aware of some iconographic detail, which I had not noted before. I therefore consider the project to have produced an important tool for further research in ancient Near Eastern iconography. However, this tool could have been far more valuable if the work had been performed by persons who had some interest in and knowledge of cylinder seals. This appears to have been purposefully avoided, probably so as not to prejudice the results because, as stated in several places in the introduction, the principal aim of the chief organizers of the Repertoire was the perfection of the method employed in this pilot project. Thus the cylinder seals themselves were of secondary impor- tance. This is obvious throughout the entire work, even in the terminology. To give an example of erroneous terminology, the verb &amp;craser, 'to crush,' is used for the action in which a person places a foot on the neck of a feline, thereby breaking it rather than crushing it, as suggested by the description (p. 24:A. 1); illustration (p. 41: Fig. 1.100). This shows a complete lack of understanding of the action and its implication. Placing the foot on the neck of an enemy is amply documented in Assyro- Babylonian texts relating claims of victory. An example is the statement of the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta 1 (1243-1207 B.C.), who said of his victory over Kashtiliashu IV, "[I] trod with my feet upon his lordly neck as though it were a footstool." (A. K. Grayson, Assvrian Royal Inscriptions, I, Wiesbaden, 1972, p. 108 # 716). Another example is provided by the "anthropomorphic trees" (Volume 2, p. 279: illustration bottom, left, with reference to 2090 and perhaps also 3069). One of the examples cited, perhaps both, shows not a human tree but a deity whose lower body is formed of streams of water from the sides of which plants grow. Errors, which stem from a failure to observe precisely are even more serious in the explanatory drawings which were doubtless included to satisfy the modern reader's preference for visual, rather than verbal explanations. For example, in the illustrations to the actions of touching (Volume 2, p. 29, 58) a man kneels before a deity, touching the latter's knee. I do not know of any such representation, and there is no reference to this in the catalogue cards as indicated by the answer to the relevant question 41 in Volume 1, p. 70. I wonder whether the action has been properly observed on the cylinder on which it must have occurred, which would have been of Old Syrian or Syrian colony style, both of which show small worshipers kneeling on one knee before a deity but never touching that god. In my opinion such an action would be much too intimate within the context of Western Asiatic religiosity. It is unfortunate that the originals of the little drawings were not always indicated to permit the reader to check their validity. The answer of the organizers will be that these drawings are theoretical, not based on specific seal designs of the catalogue (see Volume 2, p. 6, s.v.c). But how legitimate are such theoretical designs? The creation of the imaginary grouping of an Old Babylonian king facing right with a deity standing before him (Volume 2, p. 39 [75]) seems to me to be the equivalent of a falsification, because in Old Babylonian scenes the king faces left and is never shown alone with a deity. Moreover, the schematic drawings are often simplified to such an extent as to create erroneous images in the memories of students who work conscientiously through the Repertoire. Thus, the Mesopotamian nude bearded hero with frontal face, whose characteristic appearance from the Agade period on- ward includes three pairs of curls, is shown with only two pairs (except in the illustrations of hairdress in the Com- mentary, Volume 3, p. 153: 13.4). There are no recognizable textual references to the appearance of this hero; nevertheless, the three pairs of curls may have been meaningful since they are so consistently portrayed down to the Old Babylonian period. Another simplification which borders on falsification is the representation of the god in ascending posture, holding a saw and thus characterized as the sun god without the few lines elsewhere used to indicate a beard, the main criterion of differentiation between the sexes in seal designs. How little the person who made the small explanatory drawings had actually looked at the original cylinder seals is shown by the drawings of the figure with a mace, Volume 3, p. 173: 17. 17 and 17. 18. The figure holds its "weapon" with the mace-head pointing down. This is entirely logical. To use the mace to strike an enemy, one would need to hold the weapon toward the end of the staff with the top pointing down. However, this is not the way this figure was portrayed in Old Babylonian cylinder seals, where it is ubiquitous, or in some clay plaques where it is quite clearly seen (e.g., one in the Metropolitan Museum of Art). Had the draftsman found it necessary to check with photographs of the figure in cylinder seals, even among the drawings of Volume 2, where the figure is correctly shown, he would have realized that the figure was not holding the mace as a weapon in readiness for battle but as the king's symbol of power, held like an emblem." An " To the west of Mesopotamia, in Syria, the king's mace seems to have been held with the head down as seen on a cylinder in Damascus, H.

Any student with only superficial knowl- edge of Aegean iconography would have immediately realized that no griffin is ever attacked from the back with a thin weapon, resembling a fencing foil, but that a different mean- ing is suggested by a frequently reproduced Mycenaean gem from Vaphio with a massive priest apparently holding a griffin on a leash. A check of the card in the fichier, No. 3070- 1, shows that the man indeed holds the griffins on two thin leashes, one of which was made to sag a little to emphasize its nature. In a work which has pretensions to scholarly validity neither the draftsman nor the supervisor either glanced at the reproduction of the Vaphio gem on plate III of the original article in Syria 32 (1955) on which the cylinder excerpted for the Repertoire was reproduced, or read Henri Seyrig's des- cription on the first page of that article, which states "standing personage holding two griffins by leashes." This example indicates that the work was done mindlessly, as on an assembly line, by persons who had neither knowledge nor interest in cylinder seals. The most reprehensible lack of concern for the integrity of the seal material is shown in the inclusion in the Repertoire of cylinders the designs of which were forged and of which the printed warnings concerning indication of falsification were obviously ignored.12 was felt between the king's mace and the weapon of the "smiting" weather-god so ubiquitously represented in that region. 1 No. 3772 of the catalogue, a seal in Turin, is reproduced in reverse, probably from an old mold. The cylinder was prob- ably badly recut, to judge by the figures' undifferentiated and unevenly proportioned forms as well as the presence of a lion- headed eagle over a scorpion, which is not to be expected in what would be classified as a Late Old Babylonian cylinder on the basis of the genuine-looking divine figure at the left of the reproduced scene and of the inscription. No. 3777-8-9, also in Turin, has as the most distinctive criterion for forgery a hero in the central pair of figures killing a lion with a spear, not to speak of the unparalleled postures and garments of the figures. No. 3846-7, published by D. J. Wiseman, Catalogue of Western Asiatic Seals in the British Museum (London, 1962) pi. 1:d, is described in that catalogue as, "Probably recut, Early Dynastic period, authenticity questioned." The fact that the cylinder was questioned does not seem to have prevented the organizers of the Repertoire from including it, although they must have been aware of Wiseman's doubts since they cited the reference to his catalogue. Other examples of Not only must a user of the Repertoire recognize forgeries, but the extent of what needs to be known about seals is best illustrated by reviewing the cylinder seals to which the reader would be referred by the "answer" to the first question: "comparanda for confronted personages whose legs cross," (Question 1. Volume 1, p. 38). The first item, No. 101, cited as corresponding to the requested motif is a sealing from Ras Shamra-Ugarit which shows not figures with crossed legs, but instead one figure placing its foot on that of the confronting figure. The analyst rightly connected the representation with those of figures with crossed legs because in the latter a plant is also held by both figures, as in No. 465 from Levels V-IV from Atchana-Alalakh. Both scenes may have been meant to show figures in a dance. Such scenes differ completely from a cylinder from Atchana-Alalakh, No. 441-2, which is also listed among scenes in which figures cross their legs. Here one man places his foot on that of his opponent but the meaning is that of a contest, perhaps a wrestling bout. The next number, 1495-6 has two confronted bull-men whose legs do not cross at all. The double or triple number on a card was meant to indicate that the representation could be considered as show- ing several different actions. In No. 2221-2 two men with a plant again have one foot placed on that of the opposite figure, while No. 2902-3-4 is not relevant at all. No. 3128 from the Iranian Talyche has two kneeling figures in the typical posture required by the question. In No. 3780-1, a forgeries are Nos. 3919-20 and 3939 in the Royal Ontario Museum, in which the impressionistic carving of the figures is typical of forgeries made 80 to 100 years ago, but this was not recognized by T. Meek in Beritus 8 (1943-44) from which the cylinder was reproduced. The same style may be represented by the forgeries Nos. 4220 and 4221, Collection Saarisalo, Stud Or 12/8 (1947 Op 5), figs. 4-5. No. 3949 from Meek's article in BerYtus was probably recut. No. 4046 in the Archaeological Museum in Florence, published by L. Dela- porte in Arethuse 4 (1927), p. 65, pl. VIII, 31, from which it was reproduced, is a modern pastiche with pseudo-writing; No. 4052, also in Florence, is a modern copy of the Neo- Assyrian cylinder in the Pierpont Morgan Library, Corpus of Ancient Near Eastern Seals in North American Collections I (Washington, 1948) No. 714. No. 1164, Collection E. Gross- man in St. Louis, is a forgery in which quasi-alphabetic figures are used. Finally, No. 4357 is published with a reference to Corpus 1, 1151 under which I included the cylinder among the forgeries of the Pierpont Morgan Library Collection and referred the reader to the original of the cylinder in J. Menant, Catalogue ... de la Hal'e (The Hague, 1878), No. 25. Therefore, this could scarcely have been an oversight.</page><page sequence="6">506 Journal of the American Oriental Society 102.3 (1982) Syrian cylinder in the former Schmidt Collection in Solo- thurn, two small figures have their entire bodies crossed, not just their legs. No. 3919-20 is a forgery in which two small figures cross legs in the posture of modern soccer players; a sealing from Kirkuk, No. 4034, is once again a typical Mitannian representation of the desired scheme. No. 4088-9, a cylinder of classical Syrian style, formerly in the Imhof- Blumer Collection, difficult to make out in the reproduction, shows a row of marching men, who cross legs, but this is not a pair of figures, hence this cylinder is again not relevant. In eleven examples cited by the computer, there are three genuine representations of pairs of figures with crossed legs and one forgery; two representations show closely related pairs of figures and five are not related. This could be expected in view of the fact that the answers were printed as they came out of the computer and were not checked for their validity so as not to give the impression of precision when "in actuality approximation is the rule in such automatic docu- mentation" (Volume 1, p. 37(b)). Moreover, the differentia- tion between crossed legs and one leg placed on top of the other in scenes of figures with a tree was probably omitted for the reason cited ibid-that the precision of the description stopped at a certain level of refinement. However, such precision is essential for a valid statement concerning ancient Near Eastern iconography. Everything short of precision is not only useless but misleading, and damaging to scholarship instead of contributing to it. The monumental project which could have greatly furthered iconographical studies of ancient Near Eastern art founders on the insufficient interest of the researchers in the works of art with which they were dealing. Gardin confirms this by stating (Volume 1, p. 32, s.v.2.(a)) "Neither the principal author nor any of the assistants have the sense of mission, strength or desire to continue the project, for example to continue the bibliographical 'diaspora' of cylinder seals after about 1960, where the project stopped, to fill the lacunae of earlier years, or to add to the considerable mass of cylinders published in the catalogues of collections or in excavation reports particularly rich in cylinder seals, which had been purposely omitted from the first edition of the fichier." This means that the undertaking is basically unfinished. The reason given by Gardin is lack of institutional patronage. In my opinion it is the preoccupation with method per se, rather than interest in the iconography of the ancient Near East as it can be derived from cylinder seals, which has doomed the project. Had compilers acquainted with ancient Near Eastern history, culture, and art been chosen for the task, interest and commitment might have led them to continue the project even after the completion of its initial stages. What can be done to make the Repertoire in its present state useful to persons not intimately familiar with cylinder seals? I suggest appending a list of at least approximate up-to- date stylistic determinations of every cylinder on a catalogue card. This means indication of approximate date and region so that an uninformed user has some idea from where his parallels come. Perhaps the organizers of the Repertoire feel that such uninformed users have no place in scholarship, for their attitude throughout is exclusive, not inclusive. But one can be well informed in one field and not in another, and even if a person is conpletely uninformed, as is a beginning student, one has to start somewhere! I would be glad to furnish such a list as soon as I would have the time to do so as a contribution to this project, which was intended as an efficient way of organizing and subse- quently disseminating information on cylinder seals. Their number grows with every campaign of excavation in the Near East. At the same time their importance for our knowledge, not only of ancient Near Eastern art but also of culture in general and of political and trade relations with east and west-Afghanistan on the one hand and the Aegean regions on the other-is becoming more commonly recognized. From a desideratum in 1957, their classification and accessibility has become a necessity in 1982. The Repertoire, for which the use of computer techniques is essential, is a valiant beginning in this direction. But even more important than developing mechanical techniques, methods of recording, and "cognitive theories" about them, (all of which change with every genera- tion of machines and scholars), are the creation of a precise pictorial record and the presentation of a detailed verbal description of the cylinder seal. For, in the final analysis, it is the work of art alone which is of lasting value for future generations of scholars.</page></plain_text>
