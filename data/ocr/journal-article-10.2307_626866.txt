<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ares in Coronea.-In a recent article,1 Mrs. A. D. Ure discusses the interpretation of a scene on an early Boeotian vase in the British Museum,2 and establishes it as referring, not to the Pana- thenaic games, as formerly suggested, but to the Pamboeotian festival at Coronea. On the vase in question a procession of men advances to a flaming altar, behind which stands Athena Itonia in the forecourt of her temple. Immedi- ately behind her rises an image of a snake, placed on a stand, and equalling in height the image of Athena. Mrs. Ure considers that the snake 'may well have been some primitive under-world deity who was on the spot before Itonia came down from Thessaly.' This under- world deity she identifies, on the basis of two passages in Pausanias and Strabo,3 as Zeus- Hades, a chthonic conception akin to Zeus Meilichius. Is it possible that in the snake and the notion of a primitive chthonic deity there may be some reference to the cult of Ares ? My suggestion is based on the mention of a horse-race drr6 troO "ApEo in an inscription of the second century B.C.,4 which records the programme of the Pamboeotian festival at Coronea. On the evidence of this race, Foucart, in originally publishing the inscription,' wished to assign the worship of Ares to this locality, and would emend the passage in Strabo from Hades to Ares.6 Mrs. Ure stresses the likeness of the Zeus- Hades conception to the chthonic Zeus Meili- chius, and points to the association of the latter with the snake in various localities. I may mention the various attempts which have been made to attribute an original chthonic signifi- cance to Ares. Kern 7 makes a statement that ' Kriegsgottheiten sind fast immer unterirdische Wesen.' F. Schwenn in an article on Ares in Archiv fiir Religionswissenschaft 8 notes the various legendary connexions of Ares with the snake in Thebes,9 and concludes that in Thebes at least Ares was originally worshipped in the form of a snake. In all other known cults of Ares, particularly in Argos, Arcadia, and Laconia, Schwenn finds some evidence for Ares as an SJHS. 49, PP. 167 if. 2 CVA., B.M., fasc. 2, P1. 65, 4. 3 Paus.

P. Kretschmer 1 calls him 'ein Tod und Verderben bringender Damon der Erdtiefe, eine chthonische Gottheit, die als Strafer der Missetat, besonders des Mordes gedacht wurde.' The whole matter is highly problematical. But the very fact that there was a doubt even in antiquity 2 about the identity of the god who shared the temple with Athena at Coronea, suggests that the original significance and identity of the god had become confused in later anthropomorphic representations. The oldest form of representation is no doubt preserved for us in the snake on the sixth-century vase. Whether this very early worship should be connected with the Ares of the late inscription may seem questionable, but the inscriptional records of the local festivals are notably con- servative in preserving customs of earlier centuries. Moreover, the Coronean horse-race is the only occurrence of the race in agonistic inscriptions, and such unique ceremonies in local programmes are usually survivals from the earliest times. For the nature of the race I would suggest a possible parallel in the rites of the Roman Mars. In the festival of the October horse the central feature of the celebration was a horse-race in the campus from the altar of Mars, at the conclusion of which the victorious horse was sacrificed to the god by the flamen Martialis.3 In the custom of decorating the horse's neck with a garland of sheaves commentators have seen an indication that the sacrifice was performed 'ob frugum eventum.' dw6rr -ro ApEcos in Coronea may have comprised some similar ceremonies.
