HOBROUSE. I.-By J. S. HALDANE. THE subject of this discussion, as I understand it, is whether the general conceptions or " categories " ordinarily used in interpreting physical, biological and psychological phenomena are essentially different and irreconcilable with one another. In approaching this qutestion, I think we must carefully distinguish between the conceptions, or, as I should prefer to say, working hypotheses, which we commonly use in inter- preting reality, -and that reality itself. The discussion applies to our working hypotheses or categories; and I propose to mnaintain that our ordinary working conceptions of what we regard as physical, biological and psychological phenomena are not only different, but irreducible to one another. I will deal first with the difference between physical and biological interpretations of experience. The theory which aims at interpreting the phenomena of life as nothing but physical and chemnical phenomena, accompanied, it may be, by consciousness, is generally known as the mechanistic theory of life. The theory which, on the contrary, interprets biological phenomena in terms of a special conception based on the observation of life itself may be called the biological theory. Of these opposing theories each seeks to interpret the same facts in its own way, and the one way is completely different from the other. But there is also an intermediate theory-that known as vitalism. The vitalists accept as true, so far as it 2 D 2</page><page sequence="2">420 J. S. HALDANE. goes, the physical and chemical interpretation of the phenomeina connected with living organisms, but maintain that in living organisms we must in addition assume the existence of some- thing quite distinct which interferes with and guides the physical and chemical reactions. This something has been called " vital force," " the vital principle," or, to use Driesch's expression, " entelechy." So long as the vitalists confine themselves to merely pointing out the deficiences of the purely mechanistic theory, the evidence which they bring, forward is so strong that it seems to me to be unanswerable. When, however, they try to define vitalism on its positive side the result is quite indefinite. The sonmething which was supposed to interfere from witlhout in the physical and chemical reactions can always be shown by experimenit to be dependent on what were admitted to be physical and chemical conditions, though there is no explanation of how these conditions bring about the actual results. Vitalism thus represents no clearly definable working hypothesis, and for this reason I do not propose to consider it further. The same considerations apply to the corresponding animistic theory in psychology. I shall now try to present shortly the mechanistic argument and what seem to me its fatally weak points. The conception of a living organism as a mechanism is in some respects quite natural and very useful. We can, for instance, understand up to a certain point the movements of the limbs if we regard the bones as levers acted on by the contractions of the m-uscles. It is equally natural to seek for corresponding mechanical explanations of the contraction of muscle; and though defin-ite progress in this direction has hitherto been limited I feel confident that we are on the eve of such progress. When we turn to any other form of bodily activity we find similarly that physical and chemical explanations will carry us a long step forwards. Thus, the chemistry of the blood enables us to see exactly how oxygen is carried from the lungs to the tissues, and carbon dioxide is carried from the tissues to the lungs; the</page><page sequence="3">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 421 chemistry of the digestive secretions enables us to understand the chemical changes in digestion; and the structure of the eye and the laws of optics show us how an imiiage is formed on the retina. At first sight, therefore, it seems justifiable to assume that, if our knowledge of the chemistry and physics of the living body were sufficiently complete, we could explain completely all the phenomena occurring in living organisms. It used often to be stated confidently that the develop- mnent of phvsiology shows a continuous advance towards a mechanical explanation of life; and this statement is at present widely accepted. It is certainly true that physical and cheinical explanations are beino profitably applied to more and more of the phenomena associated with life. It is, however, equally true that more and more of these plhenomena are being found to be quite insusceptible of the simple mechanical explanations which were formerly given of thlem. Fifty years ago many physiological processes whlich, fronm a physical and chemical standpoint, are now seen to be extremely complex and obscure, were regarded as quite simple. I need onily refer to such activities as the oxidative processes in livinig tissues, the processes of secretion and absorption, or reflex action. There is a prevalent idea that the progress of chemistry, and particularly of physical chemistry, has helped towards an explanation of these processes. This is most certainly not the case. What physical chemistry has helped us to do is to obtain ineasures of the processes in the living body; but the results of the mneasurements lhave been to show with ever-increasing clearness that the processes in the livinig body do not correspond with our conceptions of those in non-livinig structures, and that we are not remotely in sight of mechanical explanations of the former. As an example, I need only take the case of the exquisitely thin and delicate living, membrane which separates the blood in the lung capillaries from the air in the alveoli or air-cells of the lungs. A short time ago it was assumed that this membrane</page><page sequence="4">422 J. S. HALDANE. plays only the passive part which we regard a nion-livinig membrane as playing, and allows oxygen to diffuse through just as a non-living membrane would. On applying accurate methods of measurement we found that, whenever there is need for an extra supply of oxygen, as, for instance, during rnuscular exertion, the membrane assumes an active role and pushes oxygen inwards, without regard to the mechanical laws of diffusion. In this respect the alveolar epithelium acts just like epitlhelium of the swim-bladder, or that of the kidney or any other gland, or the alimentary canal. The progress of physical clhemistry is enabling us to distinguish sharply between physiological activity and the processes occurring in non-living structures; and the establishinent of the distinction is sweeping away the easy-going mechanistic explanations which becamiie current during the latter half of last century. On the whole, there is no evidence of real progress towards a mechanistic explanation of life; and those physiologists who still believe that the mechanistic line of attack is the right one are compelled to justify their belief on general philosophical grounds. We ought, they say, to advance from the simple to the complex; from the sure and famiiliar ground of physics and chemistry to the unknown ground of biology. Practically speaking, they argue that life mutst be a mechanical process, although at present we cannot understand the mnechanismi. Now, I wish to go straight to the point, and explaini why, as it seems to me, life cannot be regarded as a mechanical process. A living organism differs in this respect from any mechanism which we can construct or conceive, that it forms itself and keeps itself in workino order and activity. Bearing this in mind, let us look again at the various apparent mechanisms previously referred to. The bones and muscles involved in limb-movements have not only developed into the particular arrangement which renders them efficient, but from hour to hour and day to day nutritive activities are occurrinog in them which keep this arrangement intact. More- - 1-</page><page sequence="5">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 42,: over, the actual movements are, apart altogether from conscious interference, guided and conitrolled at every point. These are facts which the mechanical explanation does not account for. When we look closely 'into the changes occurring, in a miiuscle doing muscular work we see that reprodtuction of the muscular substance is an integ,ral part of these changes. The wonderfully beautiful balance of chemical composition which enables the blood to perform correctly its work in carrying oxygen and carbon dioxide depends no less evidently on constant and minute regulation. The formation and liberation of the digestive ferments is likewise minutely regulated; and the same is true of the exact form and optical properties of the refractive structures of the eye. Moreover, the whole of these wonderfully delicately balanced miechanisms have originally developed from a single cell containing no trace of the future structures. It is thus evident that, although we find within the living body many phenomena which, so long as we do not look closely, can be interpreted satisfactorily as physical and chemical mechanismri, there are side by side other phenomena for which the possibility of such interpretation seems to be absent. The mechanists assume that the bodily mechanisms are so constructed as to maintain, repair, and reproduce themselves. In the long process of natural selection, mechanisms of this sort have, they suggest, been evolved gradually. Let us examinie this hypothesis. When we state an event in mechanical terms we state it as a necessary result of certain simple properties of separate parts which interact in the event. Thus, it is through the interaction of rigid bones of a certain configuration with contractile muscles attached to themi at certain points that we explain the movements of a limb. Similarly, it is in terms of the inter- action of oxygen molecules with the molecules of hlemoglobin</page><page sequence="6">424 J. S. HALDANE. and other substances in blood that we explain the takinag tip of oxygen by venous blood. The essence of the explanationl or re-statement of the event is that after due investigation we have assumed that the parts interacting in the event have cer tain simple and definite properties, so that they always react in the same way under the same coniditions. For a mechanical explanation the reacting parts must first be givenl. Unless an arrangement of parts with definite properties is given it is meaningless to speak of mechaniical explanation. To postulate the existence of a self-producing or self- maintaining mechanism is, thus, to postulate soinething to which no meaning can be attached. Meaningless ternis are sometimles used by physiologists; but there is none so abso- lutely meaniingless as the expression "mechanism of repro- duction." Any mechanism there may be in the parenit organism is absent in the process of reproduction, and must reconstitute itself at each generation, since the parent organism is reproduced from a mere tiny speck of its owIn body. There can be no "mechanism" of reproduction. The idea of a mechanisnm which is constantly maintaining or reproducing its own structure is self-contradictory. A mechanismii which reproduced itself would be a mechanism without, parts, and, therefore, not a mechanism. Let us try to get nearer to what the self-reproduction and self-maintenance of an organism imiplies. Perhaps, the clearest analogy in the inorganic world to the reproduction of an organismn is the reproduction of a crystal. By increasing the external pressure, or adding heat, we can cause a crystal of ice to waste away by nmelting. If, however, we remlove the pressure, or the heat, the crystal re-forms and grows to its former size. We can also, with proper precautions, cool water to below the freezing-point without any ice forming. But if to the supercooled water we add the smallest crystal of ice it rapidly grows into a larger crystal, just as the germ of an organism grows. The molecules of water possess the property</page><page sequence="7">PHIYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 425 of attracting onie another in such a way as to produce muitual orientation or arrangement, in which they take up more space than when they were present as a mere mobile crowd in the liquiid state; and in the starting of the process of orientation sonme initial hiindrance has to be overcome, so that crystallisa- tioni occurs far more readily if it is given a start. We must assume that each molecule possesses the property of so attracting each other molecule as to produce the mutual orientation if there is no hindrance from pressure or from the molecular agitation due to heat, or from other causes. An organism maintains itself through a balance between constant loss and gain, whereas the crystal of water seems at first sight not to change except by growth or melting away. When we look closer, however, we find that the crystal has a vapour pressure. It is, therefore, constantly giving off, and must be equally constantly takingt up, water-molecules from its environment. Hence, in this respect also, it resembles an org,anism. Where the resemblance fails is that the arrangement of the mnolecules in the crystal is mnere repetition, whereas in the organisnm there is individual variety of detail, and yet perfectly definite and specific unity of plan. For the formation of the erystal it is necessary that each molecule of water should have the property of tending to orientate itself to any other in a certain definite manner. Mere cenitral forces of attraction do not explain the formation of a crystal from molecules or of a molecule froimi atoms. Similarly, in the development of an organism we seem bound to assume that the germ has the pro- perty of tending to orientate towards itself certain surrounding miolecules in the specific arrangement of the fully developed org.inisin, and that these surrounding nmolecules have corre- sponlding properties. It ilmay be pointed out that this is no explanation. Nor is it meant to be an explanation. It is a mere general statement of what appear to be the facts of observation. In mechanical</page><page sequence="8">426 J. S. IfALDANE. physics we have becolmle accustomiied to think of molecules or atoms as quite simple thing(,s with easily definable properties, such as miass, extension, an(I central forces of attraction. For biology, the properties which must be assumed in a uniit of living structure are enormously more complex, and are only capable at present of statement in general terms. It is solely from previous actual observation that we can predict how the living structuire will behave, and we can only do so if the environment is about the same as in the previous observation. Practically, therefore, we must look upon organism and environment as one interconnected whole, in which, as a matter of empirical fact, the organism tends to maintain itself, just as a crystal in its mother-liquor does, or a molecule in the solution in which it has formed. From no elementary mechanical principles can we deduce the behaviour of even the molecule of water in crystallisation; and similarly, fromz no elementary physical or chemical principles can we deduce the behaviour of the organism. It is owing to this empirical fact that the ordinary working hypotheses of physics and chemistry are irreconcilable with those of biology. The tacit assumption is oftenl made that in mechanical physics we reach a definition of the ultimate reality of which the visible world consists. For many practical purposes this definition, it is true, suffices. But even in connection with heat, light, and electricity, the definiition is insufficient. In chemistry it breaks down still more, and in biology the breakdown is complete. Like pure mathematics, nlechanical physics is only an abstract science. We can use it for certain practical purposes, but it tells us only a very little about reality, anid in only a very imperfect form. Let me illustrate my meaning by reference to the kinetic theory of gases-a subject which has been specially engaging me lately. For the kinetic theory of gases, a gas is an assembly of molecules kept in nmotion by heat, with the necessary conse- quience that each molecule, whatever its mass may be, possesses</page><page sequence="9">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHIOLOGICAL CiATEGORIES. 427 on ail average the same amount of kinietic energy. .Hence, an equal number of gas muolecules will always produce the sanme bomibardment pressure at the same temuperature, and from this pressure we obtain an absolite scale of temperature. In this way we can predict from the theory the three well-known "gas-laws," called, after their discoverers, Boyle's, Charles's and Avogadro's laws. These laws are embodied in the equa- tion PV = RT, where P = pressure, V = volume, T = absolute temnperature, and Rt is a constant for each gas, but varies for different gases in inverse proportioln to their miolecular weights. Now, it is evident that this equation can only hold good if molecules are regarded as points with mass, but without exten- sion. Some mathematical physicists have clung tenaciously to this idea and to the equation. There we mutst leave them, because we are not dealing with mathematical figments, but with reality in so far as it is revealed to us in experience. As a matter of fact, the equation PY = RT has only the appear- ance of holding within certain linits of temperature arild pressure. If the temperature falls or the pressure increases sufficiently, the value of PV becomes, or may become, greater than RT, because the volumne of the molecules themselves begins to count. Hence, if we call v the volume occupied by the molecules, we must alter the equationi to P (V-v) = RT. If the molecules were siinply indifferent to one another, so that they merely repelled one anotlher on contact, we should now have an equation expressing the behaviour of a gaseous substance. But, as a matter of fact, even the amended equation does not express the behaviouLr of actual gases, for, with sufficient cooling, gases condense to liquids. The molecules attract one another, and with progressive cooling their kinetic energy is so inuch reduced that on an average a constantly increasing proportion of thenii remain within their mutual spheres of attraction, like the planets in the solar system, and hence exercise 11o external pressure. We must, therefore, alter the significance of P, so that it uleans, not external, but</page><page sequence="10">428 J. S. HALDANE. intermaolecular pressure. We canl, then, as I have recently endeavoured to show, extend the gas-laws to liquids, and by means of them predict with great accuracy a very large number of facts. There remain other facts, however, which we cannot predict, for with sufficient further fall of temperature a liquefied gas crystallises. It doing so it may, like water or molten iron, increase in bulk. Now, the simuple assumptions on which the kinetic theory of gases and liquids is based are insufficient to explain the phenomena of crystallisation, with the accom- panying abi upt change of volume and of other properties. We IImust, tlherefore, assume, not merely that the molecules attract one another in the directions joining their centres, after the manner of gravitation, but that they tend to assume a definite position, pole to pole, in relation to one another, and actually assume this position as soon as their mutual move- ments, due to heat, are insuifficient to prevent them from doing so. The liquid thus crystallises at a perfectly definite tem- perature, unless its elnormous intermolecular pressure is sensibly increased by added external pressure. This shows us that when we look closely at actual molecules we are forced to the conclusion that the tendency to take specific forin or arranigement is always present in molecules, and, therefore, in what we call matter. We cannot sum up the properties of molecules in the conceptions of mass, extension, and central forces proportional to mass, in accordance with the fundamental physical conceptions of Newton. The actual pro- perties of molecules can only be expressed in terms of their potenitial orientations to various other kinds of molecules; and, when we pass beyond the comparatively simple empirical facts relating to crystallisation, when we consider also the limitless empirical facts of chemistry, we can see that the physical conceptions of extension and central forces connecting masses are nothing but imperfect representations of reality, however useful these imperfect representations may be within</page><page sequence="11">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 429 certain limits. The reality is far more than these conceptions can express. From yet another point of view the abstract mechanical conception of a molecule is unreal. We now possess abundant evidence that molecules, just like crystals or other gross molecular aggregates, are in a state of constant decomposition and recomposition. So far may this process go in very dilute solutions of what are distinguished as electrolytes, that for all practical purposes their molecules hardly exist as suclh, and only the dissociated fragments are present. Thus, a very dilute solution of sodium chloride or hydrochloric acid contains,. practically speaking, only the ions formed by tne dissolution of the molecules of sodiumn chloride or hydrochloric acid. I need, perhaps, hardly refer in detail to the very great signific- ance of the conception of ionisation first introduced by Faraday, and the manner in which this conception has developed uintil it has transformed the whole outlook of both chemistry and physics. It is now evident that not merely gross aggregrates, but also molecules and atoms, are in a state of constant decomposition, recomposition, and internal action. Their mass and extension appear to be nothing but an expression of this action; and, if so, the distinction between matter and energy, or between structure and its activity, becomes oiily an imperfect representation of the actual world. There are, thus, no real grounds for the contention that life must, in ultimate analysis, be capable of interpretation as a mechanical process. We must base our working conception of life on actual observation of living organisms, and certainly not on miechanical conceptions. Even from the purely physical standpoint, these are no longer adequate, but only provisional working hypotheses, useful for certain limited practical pur- poses, like the gas laws in either their original or amended form. Empirical observationis with regard to the behaviour of living organisms point clearly to the conclusion that in each detail of organic structure, composition, environment, and</page><page sequence="12">430 J. S. IIALDANE. activity there is a mwanifestationl or expression of the life of the organism regarded as a whole wlichl tends to persist. It is this manifestation which distinguishes biological plhenomena; and, through all the temporary variations of structure, activity, composition and enivironim-ent, it can be traced more and inore clearly with every year of advance in biological investigation. We can trace it through the ordinary metabolic phenomena in living organisms, as well as through the phenomena of -senescence, deatlh, and reproduction. As it seems to me, it is only through the central workin(g hypothesis or category of life that we can bring unity and intelligibility inito the group of phenomena with which biology deals; and it is because the biological working, hypothesis is for the present absent in our ordinary coniceptions of physical and chemical phenonmena that we must treat physical and biological categories as radically different. The popular and completely natural distinction betwveen the living and non-living, is thus wholly justified on the ground that biological observations cannot be expressed or described in terms of ordinary physical working, hypotheses. For a more detailed discussion of this position in the light of the empirical facts of physiology I may, perhaps, refer to my recent book, Organism and Environment. I must now pass to the question whether biological and psychological categories must also be treated as different. To this question it seemns to me that there are still clearer reasons for returning an affirmative answer. When we examine the organic wholeness and persistency which shows itself in the life of an organism we see at once that life is limited on all sides by what we can only interpret as physical and chemical conditions. If the oxygen percentage in the air breathed falls low enough, or the external tem- perature rises or falls sufficiently, life no longer dominates the phenomena. In every direction we see similar limitations. A plant may be regarded as the type of what appears to be</page><page sequence="13">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 431 a mere organism. It is very seinsitive to chlanges in its environ- ment, and is helpless against numierous accidental changes, though human foresight can often quite easily guard it. A conscious organism is distinguLished by the mannier in which it overcomes these hindrances. It is aware of, and avoids, neutralises, or even takes advantage of them. It adapts its behaviour in such a manner as to maintain itself in the presence of what is outside the mere organic unity of its life. But in so doing the organism shows itself to be miore than a mere organism; it includes within the unity of its life what seemed to be independent. In other words, the biological interpretation of the phenomena of organisms is only a partial interpretation, just as the physical interpretation is a still more partial interpretation. The reaction between a conscious organism and its environ- ment is wholly different from the immediacy of what we interpret as physical or physiological reactioni. In physical or physiological reaction one object reacts directly with another in space, but only in space; the reaction is immiediate or "blind." lnto conscious reaction, both the actual past and the potential future enter also. Conscious reaction determines future reactions directly, and also directly modifies what, apart from consciousness, would have been the effects of past reactions. A psychological object has thus a dynamic influence on other objects surrounding it, not merely in space, but also in tinme. It has thus an element of timelessness, inasmuch as it directly modifies the influence of not only present, but also future anld past objects. It represents action at a distance, not only in space, but also in tim-e. The physical world which we seem to see so plainly aroulnd us is reality as it appears in our consciousness. It is a reality of objects of consciousness, the constant presence of which guides all our conlscious actions. What guides us is our knowledge of objects. This knowledge is there and constantly active, though the objects as physical or biological objects are</page><page sequence="14">432 J. S. HALDANE. out of sight or contact, so that their immediate inifluence is entirely absent. It has already been pointed out that the world of mathe- matical physics is a very imiperfect presentation of reality, and that in the biological world much more of reality is presented. In the world of psychology still more of reality comes before us. The real world is not merely a physical or biological world, but also a kmown world. In identifying it as a known world we are making use of an additional category or working hypothesis. What makes this necessary is simply the nature of the empirical facts. A world which is not a known world means as little to us as a world in which the equationl PV = PiT holds good absolutely, or a world of atoms indifferent to one another. Such worlds are mere figments of ouir imagi- nation, though the figments are often useful for certain limited purposes. In judging of the nature of reality we have no right to exclude the facts which emerge in either biological or psychological observation. It would be just as reasonable to- exclude from physics or chemistry all the facts relating to ionisation. Conscious activity is a part of our objective universe, and must be taken account of in our juidgments of reality. Consciousness has been looked upon as a mere accompani- ment of physical and chemical changes in nerve-cells. As has been already pointed out, the active changes within the living body cannot be interpreted as mere physical and chemical changes. An alternative view is that conscious activity is a subjective accompaniment of what we interpret as vital activity. To me it seems clear that this view is not possible. Vital activity is blind." This means that the organic unity which we can always identify in vital or biological activity is immediate in character. An unconscious organism adapts itself to new con- ditions, but only through a process which appears to be essentially as blind as the action of gravitation. In the process</page><page sequence="15">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOCICAL (ArEGORIES. 433 of reproduction the germ might seenm as if it were realising a conscious plan of the fully developed organism. Embryological investigation indicates, however, that each step in development is the immediate outcome of the conditions existing at the moment. If these conditions are abnormal the development will also be abnormal, so that all sorts of monstrosities are possible. It is true that for a mere organism the past lives on in the present, and there is a sense in which we can speak of organic memory. But we might equally describe this organic persistency as of the same nature as inertia. It does not present the character of conscious memory. In perception and conscious reaction to it we are in contact with phenomena which we cannot interpret in termns of either physical or biological conceptions. An object which has been perceived is present to, and directly influences, both future and past objects of perception, so that their influence on con- scious action is altered. When Faraclay pointed out the existenice of ions in solutions he made a discovery which has gradually exercised a more alnd more wide-spread influence on scientific and practical activity, and has at the same time given a new significance to previous discoveries. In every new act of perception, however unimportanit, there is a similar influence on the reactions to future, present and past perceptions. To what we regard as mere organism the past is simply a dead weight on the presenit, and the present oni the future, just as in the case of what we regard as mere physical existence. It has been assumed widely that, while we can directly perceive physical or biological phenomena, we cannot perceive psychological phenomenla directly, since they have no "objective " existence, and are only subjective accompaniments hidden behind, and possibly determining, objective physical and physiological changes. This assumption is baseless. The objective behaviour of a conscious organism or person is quite distinct from that of an unconscious organism, although at the lowest stages of consciousness the distinction may be so 2 E</page><page sequence="16">434 J. S. HALDANE. faintly muarkedl that we are left in doubt, just as at the lowest stages of life we can hardly distinguish the living from the non-living. When we perceive a person it is most certainly a person, and not a mere organism, that we perceive. It is only by a process of abstraction from the full objective reality that we canl regard him as a miere organism. The doctor or physiologist is constantly performing with great pains this act of abstraction, and the engineer or economnist performns a still more violent act of abstraction wheni he regards the mail as a motor or working unit, or as a weight to be carried. By a similar effort we can abstract fromn the objective reality of what is beautiful. It is, of course, only by interpretation of our experience that we perceive psychological phenomnena. But exactly the same is true of biological and physical phenomenia. The physical realities which seem to lie so clear and solid in front of us are only bundles of interpretations in the light of previous and co-existing and anticipated experiences, all determining the existing experience. Even if, following Hume, we seek to disenitangle the sensations forming the crude basis of these interpretations, we are no better off. The simplest sensation carries interpretation with it, as Kant showed. The " objective " world is nothing but the world as interpreted in knowledge, and the physical or biological worlds are only abstractions from this objective world. Not onily wheni we are observing psychological phenomena. in other persons, but wbhen we are studying natural phenomenia of all kinds,is our world a psychological or spiritual world. Perhaps, we realise this best when the progress of experimental science leads to a reconsideration of fundamiiental physical interpreta- tions which, like those of mass, energy, or unchangeable atoms, have been emaployed without question for long periods. We have to go back to what was in the minds of those who established these interpretations. I will now try to summarise the argunment of this paper.</page><page sequence="17">PHYSICAL, BIOLOCICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 435) Whlen we nmake use of physical categories, we are employing simplified nmaxims or principles which, oln account of their siim-plicity, are very convenient for purposes of prediction, but which can only be used over a liinited extent of our experience without gross error. When we attempt to apply them to biological or psychological phenomena, the error becomes apparent; we cannot express biological or psychological experieinee in terms of physical conceptions. In other words, we caninot reduce biological and psychological to physical categories. Similarly, in biology we are also employing relatively simnplified maxims which enable us to predict another large class of phenomenia, but which cannot be applied to what we distiinguish as psychological phenomena without gross error. Hence we cannot reduce psychological to biological categories. We may ask why, in interpreting the physical world, we make use of schematised conceptions which biological and even physical and chemical observations prove to be untenable. The reality behind atomns and molecules, for instance, is evidently far iiiore than the schematised atoms and molecules of ordinary physics and chemistry. The answer is that for a large nlumber of purposes the schematised conceptions are practically sufficient, and give us a short cut without which we should be helpless in practical affairs, since we have not the data for framiing more adequate conceptions correctly. For biological phenonmena the schematised physical conceptions are insufficient practically and we must, therefore, make use of special biological con- ceptions, the relation of which to the physical conceptions must for the present remaini more or less obscure for lack of data. It is the saime as regards the relation of psychological to biological conceptiolns. For certain ordinary practical purposes we treat the biological and physical worlds as objective anid independent of our knowledge of themn; but this is only a convenlient figmiient. From the point of view of each individual science there is a conflict of categories or fundamental hypotheses with those of 2 E 2</page><page sequence="18">436 D'ARCY W. THOMPSON. other sciences; but fronm the wider standpoint of philosophy these categories are only provisional working hypotheses. The world of our experience is a spiritual world, as already pointed out above; and this being so we must regard categories as only forms which the riches of this spiritual world pass through in the course of their ever fuller manifestation. IT.-By D'ARCY WENTWORTH THOMPSON. THE great astronomers have given us a " Mcanique Celeste," and the great physiologists have sketched for us a " Mcanique Humaine." The one was drawn, by Newton and Laplace, to a strict mathematical scale; the other, more complex and specific, is traced with a freer hand. on lines laid down by the physicists and by the chemists. If neither gives us a consummate and uiltimate explanation of things, or even a complete ratio eiciendi of the working of its particular machine, both alike give us an admirable ratio cogitandi; they serve the purpose of ordering our thotughts, of correlating our knowledge, of anticipating phenomena, of climbing slowly but steadily (not without many a false step here and there) up the pathway of discovery. But. now Dr. Haldane throws down a challenge to the naturalist, and in particular to the physiologist; for he tells us, in effect, that we have mixed up alien concepts, that in applying the "'mechanical" laws of chemistry and physics to living things we have confused our categories, and that "biological observations cannot be expressed or described in the terms of ordinary physical working hypotheses." It is with some reluctance, I conifess, that I enter on this discusslon. The naturalist has his hands full of relatively simple problems; he approaches them in;his own way, he solves, or tries to solve them, by his owni accustomed methods. But he is afraid, generally speaking, of the larger problems which lie beyond; and his fear may be justified, or at all events pardoned,</page><page sequence="19">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGrICAL CATEGORIES. 437 or at least condoned. When we speak of Life itself, we know that we speak of a great mystery. We seeimi to havre stepped unbidden upon holy ground. Ignorance beclouds our tlhoughts, traditional beliefs disturb our minds, anid ineradicable pre- conceptions interfere with our endeavours to ratiocinate. We confess our ignorance, we admnit our failure, we seek refuge in " intuition,"' or we are lost in wonderment. Yet, now and then we take our coturage in both hands, lay aside our comfortable intuitions, endeavour to face the facts, acknowledge our difficulties, and open to review and criticism our half-formulated creeds. If these things are to be discussed at all, let me at least attemnpt to narrow the great issue. Dr. Haldane sets out to prove that, for the three several sciences, or disciplines, of physics, biology and psychology, the general conceptions with which we should approach them, the categories by which it behoves us to interpret them, are essentially different, incompatible, irreconcilable, irreducible. At once and willingly, I grant the point as regards psychology. That matter and mind are incommensurables seems to imiy judgment so obvious that it needs no argumnent and risks no serious denial. It involves, doubtless, an uncomfortable dualism, an awkward breach in the conitinuity of our thinking. I must leave it at that; and be content to state rather than to defend my dualistic attitude. Biology, then, for the present, I take to mean the study of the forms, whether gross or molecular, assumed by matter in the fabric of living things, and all the changes, processes, activities associated therewith, so far (and it seems to me a long, long way) as we canl study them apart from consciousness, or " conscious reactions." I am not without some lurking fear that I may here be charged with a petitio principii. Professor Ward has told us (for instance) that " if we begin from the material side we must keep to this side all through; if Matter is to explain Life at all, it mnust explain all life." And the converse</page><page sequence="20">438 D1ARCY AV. THOMPSON. is also maintained by many; that, if a psychical elemenit be admitted in Life at all, it nmust be admitted in all life; if by means of it we interpret the behaviour of some livinig things, so must we explain themi all; if some actionis of living things, then all actions; in short that, apart from psychology, there is no biology at all.* Howsoever this may be, in the meanwhile Dr. Haldane spares me the trouble of deciding. I am applying myself to his brief; and he discrinminates very explicitly between the psychological and " biological " categories, declaring that " the reaction between a conscious organism and its environment is wholly different from the immediacv of what we interpret as physical, or [even as] physiological reaction." In another very important way Dr. Haldane himself narrows our issue, by setting wholly aside that " intermediate theory" of " vitalism" which lies (as he says) between the physical or mechaniistic interpretation and what he designates, Kcwr' CT?Xnv' as tlhe "biological theory." That is to say, he will have nio dealings with any of those who "accept as true, so far as it goes, the physical and chemical interpretation of the phenomena connected with living organisms, but maintain that in living organisms we must in addition assume the existence of some- thing quite distinct, which interferes with and guides the physical and chenmical reactions."t Such views seem, in Dr. Haldane's judgment, to be neither fish, fowl, nor good red herring. "Vitalism," he says "represents no clearly definable working hypothesis, and for this reason I do not propose to consider it further." I am Inot sure that I understand him. But I take him to mean that vitalism is but a perverted mechanism, * So, for instance, Dr. James Ward says, in Heredity and Memory, "We find then no ground for separating organic life from psychical life ; for us all life is experience, etc." t I fear that Dr. Hobhouse is introducing something quite indis- tinguishable from the ordinary hypothesis of vitalism as, described above. when he speaks of a living being as a " psychophysical whole" containing elements-" forces if you will "-which hold its parts together and correlate their action.</page><page sequence="21">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL ANT) PSYCHIOLOGIC ( CATE(ORIES. 4.39 a theory which would still explain the whole in terms of its parts, and which merely superadds to the known (anid seemingly iinadequate) parts of the mechanism a new, nondescript kind of part, to wit, entelechy. At all events from our immediate discussion the hypotheses of the vitalists are withheld, and they trouble uis no more. I take it that all this clears away many things from our imnmediate field of debate; among other things, that it sets aside that subconscious or unconscious memory, that "Mneme," to which Hering introduced us some 50 years ago, which Samuel Butler has so subtly analysed, and which Dr. Ward has of late so warmly championed. I part with it with regret; almost the first little paper I ever wrote-I wrote it well-nigh forty years ago, when I was a Cambridge undergraduate-was an attelmpt to expound and to advocate that fascinating but (as I think now) that elusive and slippery doctrine. There is still a lion in our path, and it is a formidable one; for it is miothing less than the great metaphysical concept of Reality. This lion, however, is chained. For Dr. Haldane, at the very outset of his paper, tells us that " we must carefully distinguish between the conceptions, or, as I should prefer to say, working hypotheses, which we commonly use in inter- preting reality, and that reality itself." And then he imme- diately assures us that this " discussion applies to our working hypotheses or categories." Reality, it is true, appears again, and yet again, in Dr. Haldane's paper; and now and then we begin to be afraid of it, and once at least it seems to " straddle quite across the whole breadth of the way." Dr. Haldane makes much of the fact that, ' like pure mathematics," mechanical physics " tells us only a very little about reality, and in only a very imperfect form." (I might demur, and demur strongly, to the inclusion of pure mathematics, but let that pass.) He denounces the "tacit assumption that in mechanical physics we reach a definition of the ultimate reality of which the visible</page><page sequence="22">440 D ARCY W. THOMPSON. world consists"; he shows that the definiitioni is inisufficient; he then, this being so, lhas no difficulty inl maintaining that the same insufficiency extenids also to chemistry and to biology. I do not question it. I accept the metaphysical position. I have no quarrel with metaphysics: I have no wish in the world to contend that the great concept of ultimate Reality is but a toothless lion, or, worse still, a chimaora with a lion's head. Bqt, it belongs to the metaphysiciains, and in our present argument it is chainied. We are to deal with working concepts, or working hypotheses or categories, with the interpretatioln of " phenomena," and not with ultiinate reality. It is here, precisely on this narrow ground, that we have to consider whether or no the same working hypotheses or categories will avail us both in physical and in biological science, and all metaphysical speculationi is out of bounds. And yet, after all, we must lnot too hastily exclude Reality from our scope, as we have disnmissed vitalism; for our lion is brought upon the stage, he has a speaking part in the play, and " let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion's claws."' The concept of Reality is not something wlholly outside of our phenomena, but they themselves are part, though it may be a small part, of it; and all our group of sciences, physical, chemical, and biological, strive to interpret those " bits of reality" which are withini their reach and appropriate to their categories. Pure physics, essentially quantitative, deals with such concepts, or such aspects of matter, as extension and mass; chemistry, essentially qualitative, deals with matter analysed and distinguished according to its kind. Chemistry, therefore, makes a nearer approach to, or seems to give a somewhat closer insight into, reality than physics does; they are successive approximations to reality. The physical hypotheses are intended to deal with very general characters of reality, and they have the abstract form and character appropriate to that purpose. Chemical hypo- theses and certain of those of applied physics apply to things, to</page><page sequence="23">PHYSICAL, BIOLOG(TICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 441 kinds of matter or forms of energy aInd modes of force, which are regarded as specific; and, hence, they are necessarily less abstract and less general, miiore direct and more specific. It is obvious that biology, when we iniclude under it all the phenom-iena attendant upon or associated with life, goes further still. But our particular question is, whether biology regarded under certain definite limitations, to wit, a biology apart from the manifestations of consciousness, need necessarily involve a higher range of categories, incommensurate with mechanism. And so, while metaphysical speculation is undoubtedly o-ut of bounds for the timie being, I am prepared to agree that in a fuller treatment of the themne the natture of reality might be found to be at the bottom of the whole case; and especially if it be conceded that reality is a something wvhich can be dealt with piece-meal, and whose "pieces" or several aspects can be analysed into grades. But now let me come at last to discuss, with all possible brevity, Dr. Haldane's attitude to the " mechanistic hypothesis." He gives us, by the way, so slight an inkling for the moment of his own " biological hypothesis," that I find little to say about it in the way of Yea or Nay. The maini question is, Is it required at all ? To begin with, I am inclined to delmlur to Dr. Haldane's general treatmelnt of the " mechanistic theory." He talks about the " easy-going mechanistic explanations, which became current during the latter half of last century." There may be some ground here anld there for the aspersion; but the phrase sounds to inie prejudicial. Rough and ready indeed seem to us the first mechanistic theories of Descartes; but even they were not " easy-going. Generations of " mechanistic " physiolog,ists have tried, by no easy road, to use, as Dr. Haldane himself has done, every stepping-stone that advancing physics and advanc- ing chemistry supply towards an elucidationl of the bodily mechanism. Where is it, precisely, that they have failed ? And</page><page sequence="24">442 D ARCY W. THOMPSON. where is it (I do not know) that an alternative method has yet succeeded better ? Upon my word, Dr. Haldane gives us no clear and sharp answer to either question. He tells us, on the one hand, that it is natural to seek for " a mechanical explana- tion of the contraction of mnuscle, and though definite progress in this direction has hitherto been limited, I feel confident that we are on the eve of such progress." " Good," one is apt to say, "he is evidently sound in his appreciation of the efforts of the orthodox physiologist." Yet, on the next page one reads, " on the whole, there is no evidence of real progress towards a mechanistic explanation of life." It may be that the apparent contradiction is removed by the last two little words, and that Dr. Haldane would welcome a mechanistic explanation of isolated phenomena, though he does not recognise, or countenance, or even anticipate, its possible extension to the whole. But we have already seen that we have nothing to do with "the whole," for not only the great metaphysical concepts but also the great problems of psychology are ruled out; anid, surely, the contraction of a muscle is a fair sample of the uinconscious and non-psychological problems of physiology. If we can progress, and progress continually, in our bio- logical studies towards a physico-chemical explanation of such phenoinena, can we reasonably say that the categories of these physical sciences are alien to or irreducible with our own? And as for " easy-going explanations," I venture to think that the " easy-going " attitude is on the part of those who, when they come to a perplexing and entangled problem, one (for instance) where chemistry and physics are manifestly con- cerned, and when their knowledge of these subjects does not suffice to solve it, would too readily abandon the ship, anid pray to the deus ex nmachina of a new philosophy. And lastly, for that miiatter, the phrase would seenm to suggest that the physicist himself deals with " easy-going mechanical explanations." Now, not only do I think that this is not the case, but it seems to me that a study of some</page><page sequence="25">PHIYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 443 of the commonest and hoiiieliest of natural phenomena would teach IIs that it is by ino means so. In many cases the nechanism involved is yet unknown; in others it has been only recently elucidated; in all it is and has been the subject of anxious care and hard thiniking. The formation of dew, of mist and fog, of rain itself, are all instances which come quickly to my mind, and satisfy me in my contention that easy-going mechanical hypotheses will never do, will never last long, but give place in due time to infinitely mnore refined explanations, without, however, ever leaving the old level of concepts, the established class of physical categories. Dr. Haldane's chief illustration is drawn from the phenomena of respirationi, a part of physiology where he is peculiarly at home. He tells us that here, for instance, we have a series of phenomena quite insusceptible of the simple mechanical explanations which were formerly given of them. I do not wonder: the same is true, word for word, of a nmultitude of phenomena in ordinary physics and ordinary chemistry; is not "solution," for instance, a very different thing to the modern chemist fromn what it was much less than fifty years ago ? Fifty years ago many physiological processes which, from a physical and chemical stanidpoint, are now seen to be extremely complex and even obscure, were regarded as quite simple. Again, word for word, this is true of clhemistry and of physics; for instance, the whole of modern physical chemistry goes to show how inadequate were the loose nion-minathematical ideas of a previous generation of chemists. Dr. Haldane's crucial instance (or that which I take to be so) lies in the phenomenon of "regyulation," whereby the passage of oxygen through the living membrane of the lu-ng is increased when the needs of the organism become greater; "wherever there is need for an extra supply of oxygen, as for instance, during muscular exertion, the membrane assumes an active r6le, and pushes oxygen inwards without regard to the mechaniical laws of diffusion." I am shy of entertaining, and</page><page sequence="26">444 D ARCY W. THOMPSON. slhyer still of expressinig, a dloubt regarding Dr. Haldane's physiology. But I do venture to think that, in our admittedly, incomplete knowledge of the phenomenon, this statemenit seems a trifle too specific. More oxygen undoubtedly goes through, but are we certain that it is pushed through, rather than pulled ? And in any case, if it be pushed to the one side, it must surely be first pulled from the other. I fail to see that we are here transcending the powers of mechanism. Many a machine is constructed to oil itself the more copiously when it works the faster, and the printing- press, as we urge it to put out more newspapers on the onie side, pulls in more blank paper on the other. These illustra- tions are crude, admittedly, as are all instances drawn from machines constructed by the hands and designed by the mind of man. But in nature herself, if we look at her larger handiwork, self-regulatioin and self-maintenance become para- mount attributes and characteristics of her machines, The solar system, qua mechanislmi, is the perfect specimell, the very type and norm, of a self-maintaining, self-regulating mechanism; and so also, grade after grade, are its dependent mechanisms, such as the world-wide currents of the atmosphere and of the sea. Let me try to choose witl-h greater care a case which shall illustrate the temporary inadequacy of a miechanical explanation, and the successful mastery of the problem by the elaboration of new hypotheses, or the discovery of new " laws." The phenomenon of " sedimentation," by which sand and nmud settle to the bottom of the sea, is at first sight one of the simplest of miechanical phenomena. The particles gravitate to the bottom, by virtue of their greater density; while doing so and after doing so they are disturbed by currents and other motions of the fluid; the small and light ones are carried on, the large and heavy are left behind; the finest particles settle down at last in the calm centre of an eddy or at the termination</page><page sequence="27">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 445 of the streamn. It is by dint of this explanation, so far as it goes, that we may map out roughly the currents of a shallow sea by charting the distribution of the muds, sands and gravels on its floor. But it is found that this is by no ineans the whole story, and that it fails in the light of a closer study of the experimental facts. It is a "working hypothesis" which, by itself, will not do. And now Dr. Joly has shown that the phenomenon is far more complex than we had thought; that it is qualitative as well as quantitative; that chemistry is involved; that complicated surface-actions have to be considered, and that ionisation enters the field. Apart from ordinary chemical action, decomposition or disintegration of any kind, the little particles will be influenced in their fall by the " valency " of the chemical salts dissolved in the surrounding fluid; and they will fall at very different rates in solutions of equal density, but of different kinds. And the new hypotheses are, for the present at least, adequate to the case; they bring our experi- ments into harmony, and enable us to foresee their results. It is just another illustration of the fact that science not onily "flows," like everything else, but flows in waves. A subject is obscure to-day, when we know little of it; it is easy to-morrow, when we have learned more; but we have only to learn yet more, and we feel ignorant again. I lay stress upon this illustration. I think it safe anid fair to assert that it is very inuch on all fours with Dr. Haldane's case. A certain physical explanation of a physical phenomenon is found to be inadequate; a mechanical explanation, simple and for a long while acceptable to all, is no longer satisfying. But a wise man finds a certain key at his girdle, a new key of the old bunch, and unlocks the gate, and pursues his journey. I draw the simple lesson that, when a closed gate confronts us in our way, we had better wait and search for a key, and that we should be very loath indeed to forsake the pathway for the open fields.</page><page sequence="28">446 D'ARCY NV. THOMPSON. But a very curious thing to ime is that, while Dr. Haldane shows so great a readiness to break away from the old road, to abandon the old working hypotheses, and to devise niew categories for the biologist, yet at timnes he seems to say precisely what I would have him say, anid to accept just the lesson, or at least a part of the lessoni, which I think the foregoing illustration is fitted to teach. For, on p. 429, he says that, when Faraday pointed out the existence of ions in solutions, he made a discovery which has gradually exercised a more and more widespread influence on scientific and practical activity, and has at the same timne given a new significance to previous discoveries. Precisely so; and who is he that should set bounids to such an influence, or who should despair of other such discoveries ? They give, indeed, a new significance to our old knowledge, but they do not depart one bit from the old pathway; they refine and improve the old categories; they create new ones perhaps, but these new ones are of the same natture and are commensurate with the old; the general and fundamental working hypothesis is unchanged, save that it is better spelled, and is somehow found to be imtore convincing and satisfactory than before. Dr. Haldane lays stress upoIn several points which he asserts to stand in open contradiction to our concept of a mechanism. He says, for instance, that " a living organism differs in this respect frorn any nmechanism which we cani construct or conceive, that it forms itself, and keeps itself in working order and activity." We might, I think, show not un-uisefully that many a imachine improves, up to a certain poinlt, as it goes along. The ship finds herself, as Kipling says. My typewriter works more easily and writes better than when it was brand-new; bearings work easier, springs are slightly and advantageously relaxed, the thing is decidedly in better "working order." A spade sharpens itself as wve dig with it, as " iron sharpeneth iron." All this is very true " up to a certain point," and surely of the body the same restriction</page><page sequence="29">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 447 liolds. It is, alas, not true at all that the body " keeps itself in working, order and activity." I anm old enough to be assuired of the contrary. Like all other machines, the bodily mnachine grows old, and wears out, and works itself down. Againi, iDr. Haldane tells us (for example), that " the existence of a self-producing or self-maintaining mechanisml" is somnething to which no meaning can be attached, for the idea of "a mechanisrn which is constantly maintaining or reproducing its own structure is self-contradictory," and this is all expanided into the assertion that ("a mechanism which reproduced itself would be a machine without parts, and therefore not a miiechanism "; and, again, that "in each detail of organic structure, composition, environment, and activity there is ain expression of the life of the organism regarded as a whole which tends to persist." The parent organism is, indeed, "reproduced fronm a mere tiny speck of its own body," but that tiny speck does not stand alone, to live of itself, to work out its own destiny, and to make or to maintain itself. When the parent tissues have ceased to nourish it, it is not left alone. All the forces of nature impinge and react upon it; together they niourish it; they mould and conform it; the sun shines upon it; the air bathes it; it is a mechanism, but only part of a greater miiechanism, and the mechanismn of which it is a portion is the world. The fact is, that the whole argument, as Dr. Haldanie puts it, together with a few of the other points by which he strives to show the inadequacy of mechanical explanations, is not a very novel one; I seem to have read the same thing, or just the same sort of thing, in Driesch, and in Bergson too, and in the books of inany other of those who shrink from mechaniisin, anld introduce those very concepts of vitalism, those more or less shadowy entelechies, which Dr. Haldane for his part rejects and repudiates. The alleged phenomena of self-production, self-maintenance, and self-regulation are the common currency of those who, finding the mechanistic theory</page><page sequence="30">448 D 'ARCY W. THOMPSO.N. difficult and unisatisfactory, are content to postulate a something "which interferes with and guiides the physical and chemical reactions." After specifying mnaniy important points wherein the growth of the organism is comparable to that of a crystal, Dr. Haldane tells us that " where the resemblance fai]s is that the arrange- ment of the nmolecules of the crystal is mere repetition, whereas in the organism there is individual variety of detail, and yet perfectly definite and specific unity of plan." Let me take another illustration, crude perhaps, but not cruder than that of the crystal. Imagine a bowl of soap-suds, into which you blow. The simple mechanism consists, appa- rently, of a bowl of water and a stream of air; in truth it is more complicated than that, but it is exquisitely simple after all. But whether or no, in a few moments it develops into a very wonderful thing-a mass of froth, a shapely heap of very beauitiful bubbles. The resultant whole is a very elaborate and a -very perfect thing; and in no single bubble of it all is there a single free surface, or point or line or surface of contact, which is not absolutely definite, and (what is more) which our present knowledae cannot satisfactorily explaini. There is "perfectly definite and specific unity of plan." Moreover, there is almost infinite " individual variety of detail "; for no two bubbles are precisely the same, and repeat the experiment, and no single bubble in the first corresponds individually to a single bubble in the second. Pour a little of the water inito another dish, and the whole complex structure will reproduce itself-or rather it can be made to reproduce itself. For, again we must blow; the forces are not inherent in the soapy water (any more than the forces of growth and reproduction are all inherent in the protoplasm); the system is a larger system-it is a portion of the world. Let me say before I leave Dr. Haldane's paper, and say in perfectly frank anid candid words, that I find him difficult to</page><page sequence="31">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYChIOLOGICAL CATEfGORIES. 449 uniderstand, and that for this I am not inclinied to shoulder all the blamne. I find it hard to reach a clear definition of all his terms, and hard even, in some cases, to follow the threacd of his argument. I shall be disappointed, but I sh(all not be wholly surprised, if he tell me that I have failed to follow hini and that he and I are talking about different thinigs. Let imie try once niore to reach his standpoint, and, if possible, to meet, his argumen t. One of my chief difficulties arises, I think, froin the fact that, on the one hand, Dr. Haldane talks of a distinction between " physical" and " biological " categories, as though this were, by the nature of things, the one place in which to look for a sharp distinction. One is hereby invited, to all appearance, to interpret "physical" by physico-chemnical or even "inorganic" science, and to draw our one and only essential contrast (in this portion of our subject) betweeni the study of the living and the study of the dead. But, on the other hand, Dr. Haldane recurs again and again to the special department of chemistry, he draws sonle of his chief illustrations from it, and it is plain that he recognises to the full the tindoubted fact that its categories include much more than is contained in the working hypotheses of ordinary physics. In short, there is a gap between the categories of physics and of chemistry, what- ever there mlay be or may not be between these Sciences and biologv. Yet, while there is a categorical differenee betweer our present-day physics and chemistry, it may be admitted that this difference is not of the first order of magnitude; it is even a possible anid a plausible anticipation to look forward to a day when this breach of categories may be remloved, for not a little has already been done to narrow it. At present, the " working hypotheses" of chemistry and physics are manifestly different, and " for practical purposes" they will always, in all probability, remain so. Were, however, the transinutation of the well-known elements to become an accomplished experimnental fact, were we to succeed at last in reduicing the qualitative 2 F</page><page sequence="32">400 1))ARCY Mt. THOMPSON. differences of chemistry to differences in the number and arrangement of qualitatively similar elenments (such as electrons), and to find theim obeyinig a single set of rules, then the distinction would have disappeared, and we should have in truth reduiced the categories of chenmistry to the "'simpler categ,ories " of phiysics. IDr. Haldanie mlust be fully awake to the possibility; I take it, therefore, that he does recognise the narrowness of the gulf between these two sciences, and that it is a inuch wider gulf which hie sees between them both anid the science of organisms-even of theC "non-conscious " organism. Still, he does not tell us as clearly as one would like how he recognises it, or of what nature he believes it to be. Nor does Dr. Haldane define what he really means by the "C working hypotheses or categories of biology," and I remain in :oine doubt as to what they precisely are. That they are very ill-defined in general is pretty obvious to me; anid it is precisely to Dr. Haldane, and it is just for the purposes of such a dlscussion as this, that we might look for a new and clear expression of them. For the " ordinary naturalist," the ordinarv student of beast and bird, specific difference, if not all in all, is the cardinal concept; for all he cares, for all he sometimes knows, the tissue and the cell are concepts which might never have been devised. The comparative anatomist or the morpho- logist deals with larger units, and cares little about the difference between a blackbird and a thrush, a robin and a wren. The physiologist deals with still larger groups; the cell and the tissue are his especial themes, and most (though of course not all) of the lessons which he learns are lessons common to and taught by the study of a very few " types," such as man, the rabbit, and the frog. The working hypotheses of (say) the ornithologist are certainly not mechanical, they are very largely teleological; the ordinary working hypotheses of the physio- logist are, in the great majority of cases, distinctly mechanical, and include and practically coincide with those of the physicist and the chemist.</page><page sequence="33">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 451 And here we may at least nlote in passing that there is one common concept or workinig hypothesis of the biologist, which occupies a very peculiar positionl; it is the working bypothesis of heredity, regarded as a definite impulse, or " force," leading to hereditary transmission. It is an everyday statement of the morphologist that this or that structure, often apparently functionless, is " due to heredity "; it is prefigured as a kind of " Mneme "; it is (commonly at least) a purely vitalistic hypothesis. I for my part look forward, in faith and hope, to the ultinlate reduietion of the phenomena of heredity to much simpler categories, to explanations based on mechanical lines, and on the peculiar and strict limitatioins which physical and mathematical laws set to what are at first sight the endless and unlimited possibilities of variation. Yet, this is but an opinion, and it may be maintained by others that heredity is an independent concept, sui generis, indispensable to the biologist; that it is a phenomenon, or group of phenomena, within a category all its own; and that the special science which deals with it has at least found, in Mendel, its Kepler, and only waits for its Newton. I take it that it is in the main of biology, as it is considered, or as it ought to be regarded, by the physiologist that Dr. Haldane speaks, not forgetting those formal, or morpho- logical, or histological, and of course also embryological, problems of the tissues and of the cell with which the physiologist's work is interconnected. It must be largely for his own use and guidance as a physiologist that Dr. Haldane seeks for a definition of the biological category or categories, and it is from his own experience as a physiologist that he maintains them to be irreducible to the physical. I hope to learn from this discussion, but I do not yet easily or fiully comprehend, precisely where he stands. I can understand clearly enough a cardinal distinction between the categories of teleology and of mechanical causation; 2 F 2</page><page sequence="34">452 D?ARCY W. THOMPSON. thouigh even here there are not lacking certain risks of confusion, as in the case, for instance, of the man-made machine. But I do not think somehow that this cardinal distinctioin, between a final and an efficient cause, is what Dr. Haldane asserts to lie between the phenomena of the living and of the dead; it would be so easy to say so if it were !* Moreover. in one or two places, Dr. Haldane seems actually to reject it, as, for instance, where he not only denies that the phenomena of the reproduicing germ ale such " as if it were realising a conscious plan of the fully developed organism,"-a theory which, by the way, or something extremely like it, certain embryologists have actually upheld,- but, on the contrary, tells us that "embryological investigation indicates that each step in development is the outcome of the conditions existing at the moment." Here surely is the " efficient cause," and the description looks very like a " mechanical " one to me. I am led, then, to suppose that Dr. Haldane demands for the living organism, or for "living matter," somie difference, as compared witlh dead matter, which endows it with wholly novel properties and capacities, now limited by, but anon transcending, the physical conditions, and conferring peculiar potentialities, such as those of self-regulation and the rest. If this be so, new categories are indeed required; but in wvhat sense, or why, are we to look upon them as permanently and necessarily irreducible to those of physical science ? If they be irreducible, they are (for the tirne being) mysteries ;t our current theories and explanations crumble and vanish * Dr. Hobhouse faces this cardinal distinction, boldly raises an hypothesis upon it, and expresses the same in the plainest of words. "We now suggest," he says, " that the organic system is in a general sense purposive, i.e., at least conational, becoming purposive in its higher removes. The purposive and the mechanical, on the other hand, remain fundamentally distinct categories." t And mysteries they emphatically would be, if attached to, or intrinsic in, them were the least tinge of conation, such as Dr. Hobhouse suggests.</page><page sequence="35">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 453 away; aild we need another Archimedes, another Galileo, another Newton, to discover the elementary laws, and to write the Principia, of biology. But even were these new categories necessary in the present, in order to avoid confusioln and error and to amend our rationes cogitandi, it would still have to be proved that they were something more than a mere present help, and that they were for ever irreducible to the categories of physics. And such categories may not be " mechanical " in the ordinary sense, but may yet be mechanical in an extended sense. For mechanism is not a stationary concept but a growing one. What it meant to Aristotle is not what it means to us. Chemistry has opened our eyes, and electricity (for instance) has strained them to keep the nature and significance of a " mechanism " in view. And that Dr. Haldane recognises a "continuum" in the grades of mechanism, a succession of advancing categories, is indicated to my mind by a certain paragraph which at first sight perplexed me mightily. On page 426 he says, " From no eleiimentary mechanical principles can we deduce the behaviour of even the molecule of water in crystallisation; and similarly, from no elementary physical or chemical principles can we deduce the behaviour of the organism. It is owing to this empirical fact that the ordinary working hypotheses of physics and chemistry are irreconcilable with those of biology." I do not quite follow the statement about the behaviour of the molecule in crystallisation. I should have thought that the labours of the mathematical crystailgraphers, all they have taught us about the partitioning of space, the methods of close-packing, the large but strictly limited range of possible crystalline forms, etc., all the labours, in short, of Kelvin, Fedorow, Schoenfliess, Tutton and the rest, had vastly increased our knowledge, and helped our deductions, as to the behaviour of the molecule of water in crystallisation. Whether or no,</page><page sequence="36">454 D)'ARCY IV. THOMPSON. it is certainly more than a matter of elementary mnechanics, but it is reconcilable with the most general and fundamental principles which the physicist and the mathematician lay down. Can it be that Dr. Haldane is here only emphasising the poverty of our elementary mechanical principles, and of the ordinary working hypotheses of physics and chemistry, and again of the ordinary working hypotheses of biology ? If this be so, then, in this particular, he and I are not far apart. There is a principle of "economy," doubtless, in science, as I amii told there is even in theology; tlhere are exoteric and esoteric doctrines even in the concrete sciences, there are categories sometimes to be considered and sometimes silently passed by-as every teacher of elementary students knows. The simpler setting consists of those "schematised conceptions" of which Dr. Haldane speaks, and which are "practically sufficient for a large number of purposes." But behind these lie many more recondite concepts and hypotheses; and on these the working chemist or physicist knows that he can draw at need, without fear or risk of outstepping the funda- mental categories of physical science. And now to summarise my own position, so far as in a few words I can. I believe that the material body of a living thing (apart from consciousness) is a mechanism. I see no other way of investigating in detail its material structure, its form and its activities. I know no way of studying its material aspect otherwise than by the help of physical and chemical methods, and of the mathematical laws on which these sciences rest in their turn. I set ouit provided with the physical concepts of matter and of energy, and the mathematical concept of force. I know that change of form in a concrete material body involves the movements of matter, and that the mxovements of matter are to be symbolically ascribed to the action of force, and actually to the transference of energy. The body consists</page><page sequence="37">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 455 of matter; it is set in a material world; it has its store of energy within, it has its share in the great store of energy without. It is a part of a physical system; I study it, as well as its environment, accordingr to the working hypotheses, or categories, of physical science, with all my inight and without either hesitation or fear. It is its physical or material phenomena, admittedly, that I am studying. What more, outside of psychology and outside of mDetaphysics, can I do? There is one thing miore that strengthens in a high degree my belief in the applicability of physical methods to the organlism and in the community of principles in the two classes of miiachines. And that is the simple but most instructive fact that, while the biologist has been trying to learn of the physicist, the physicist has also found his own science vastly enriched through the labours of the physiologist anid by a study of the phenomena of the living body. That identical phe- nomenion of osmosis, which Dr. Haldane finds so difficult to understatnd as it is exemplified in the human body, was actually introduced (under its modern aspect) to the physicist by a botanist, who drew the lesson from his plants. Aild no small number of corollaries, experimental and theoretical, to Pfeffer's original discoveries have found their way into the sciences of physics and chemistry from the same biological starting-point. Furthermore, we all know that one at least of the great men for whom is claimed the first enunciation of the principle of the conservation of energy was a physiologist, who had learned his physics from the study of the plhysiological machine; and I am inclined to think that to that great physiological physicist the verdict of history is more and more freely ascribit)g the credit of this epoch-making discovery. I thiink the fact of the obvious benefit to both sides of the interchanige of ideas, this reaction and interaction between mechanical physiology and ordinary physics, one with another, goes far to convince us that the processes are fundarmentally identical, and that thte</page><page sequence="38">43 6 D 'AlhCY AV. THOAMPSON. mniechaniical hypothesis is niot alpplied to the organismii falsely or in vain. Again, choosing rather the morphological side than the physiological side of the common field of biology, I wouLld illustrate my own position by such few facts as these: When I regard the minute and simple organisms, whether unicellular or multicellular, I see among their multitudinous forms a large number which are easily described and classified in physical terms. They consist, for the most part, of tiny spheres, of tiny cylinders, and these latter are capped by portions of tiily spheres; others, again, are, so to speak, wavy or beaded cylinders-we call themn " unduloids,"-and others, closely related to these, are shortened unduloid swith spherical bases, exactly like the Florence flask that a glass-blower so easily blows. In short, every one of these figures is most easily reproduced by the glass-blower, and for the simple reason that, like his molten glass, they have assumed the known and well-under- stood configurations of a fluid film, or fluid surface, according to the simple mathematical conceptioii of " surfaces of miniial area," under this or that simple condition of restraint. Tiie words which describe, or the so-called " laws which govern," a soap-bubble describe and "govern" them. Precisely analogous principles evidently extend, the general law of sur- faces of mitnimal area evidently applies, to other less simple but equally minute organic configurations, including spirals or helicoids of various kinds. Witlhout the mathematical or physical concept I am lost or mystified in considering them, and in classifying this mazy congeries of forms; by the help of it, my observations are co-ordinated, and my facts "explained." And, mark you, this "explanation" is not a Inere matter of nonmenclature, a mere symbolic terminology, or juggling with words. It presupposes a definite acquaintance with somewhat abstruse laws of statics, and the definite assertion that the precise conditions under which the results and consequences of</page><page sequence="39">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCllOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 457 these laws are displayed are common to the living and to the dead. And if it be only in the miinute living things and rminute parts of living things that they are openly displayed, a simple and adequate reason is at hand. For it is only in them, by reason of their little mass and relatively extensive surface, that the force of gravity is overwhelmed by the molecular forces imme- diately concerned. If there be a few such forms, and they are very few indeed, to which the same principles do not obviously apply, I wait in patient expectancy for more lighlt, but I do not hurry to exchange imiy old lantern for a new. Let us take a little multicellular organism, anid let us by no means be ashamled to choose a simple one; for it is an essential part of the method of physical science, and of mathematics itself, to deal with simple, even simplified, cases, and thereby to avoid a confusion of issues, a conflict of causes. How does the first cell divide ? In what way, or under what sort of configurations, do its products of division divide again ? Generations of microscopists have depicted and described the configurations of the subdividing cell without ever dreaming that they were aught else than a specific biological phe- nomenon. But Berthold and Errera, and others, have shown, or helped to show, that they are, point for point, line for line, and surface for surface, capable of interpretation by the same mathematico-physical principles-that they are neither more nor less than exquisite illustrations of fluid surfaces in complete or partial equilibrium. I can take an imilaginary discoidal mass of liquid, represented by a circle, and inquire on purely mathematical principles how, were it to divide into drops or fragments and the fragmnents to remain in contact, the partitioins between theni, the cell-walls, would be arranged, and in wlhat order of succession they would appear. The question is not a very easy one; it involves no little calcu- lation, and the result is more complicated than one might perhaps expect. Yet, it is a literal fact that, when we have sought and found a little organism of just such a simple,</page><page sequence="40">458 D'ARCY W. THOMIPSON. flattelned, discoid form, and when ve have watchled its first little cell divide and divide again, the resultanit configuration, complicated as it is, and the successive stages in their orderly succession as they severally appear, aaree in every essential particular with the scheme which otur physico-iimathematical principles had enabled us to foretell. Dr. Haldane has referred you to a book of his; may I say that I have written a book too ? And in it, fromn beginning to, end, I have sought to show that the phenomena of Growth and of Form in organisms are phenomena to which the working hypotheses, or categories, of pllysico-mathematical science strictly, and even adequately, apply. They are not. the same physico-mathematical laws, by any means, that apply to and explain the crystal. But the difference between them, is not a difference between physics anid biology, between the living and the dead; it is merely the simiipler difference, or series of differences, between the solid crystal and the drop of water, between the symmetry of a solid and the symmetry of a liquid drop or liquid film, between the condition of equilibrium (or minimum potential energy) in a growing system whose particles, as in the fluid drop, are mobile, and one whose particles, as in the growing crystal, fall one after another, and once for all, into their places, and are free to move no more. That is, in itself, a very important difference; it leads by simple steps to many very important results; it reminds us of several important things-among others that " this too, too solid flesh" of ours is not a solid at all, and that (apart fromn our teeth and our bones) even the contours of our own bodies are not those of solid bodies, but of elastic membranes or fluid films.* The material structure of our bodies, like those of all other organisms, is styled a fabric, and is regarded by many or most * In short, the analogy of the crystal is essentially illegitimate, and that of the froth is legitimate.</page><page sequence="41">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 459 students of biology as a miiechanism. One may be, I hold, a consistent " mechanist " without being by any means a " mere materialist." I am neither afraid nor ashamed to uphold (to the great length that I have gone) a mechanical theory of the organism and its activities, or rather of its reactions with the outer world. I do not admit that in doing so we degrade our conceptions, or belittle our notions, of the organism. The mechanical concept is no base one at all. The earth itself and the sea, the earth with her slowly changing face, and the sea muiltitudinous with all its tides and currents and great and little waves, constitute a mechanism; the heavens themselves, the sun and moon and all the little stars, are a glorious mechanism. The whole material aspect of the universe is a mechanism; we know not how it has its being, but we know that it lives and moves obedient to everlasting laws; and the sanme Benedicite Dominunm is addressed to the Showers and Dew and to the Winds of God as to all that move in the waters and all that move in the air, and to all Beasts and Cattle, and unto the Children of Men. Yet a word, ere I am done, about the teleological side of our phenomena, or about our interpretation thereof. I am no friend of that aspect of teleology which professes (or presumes) to find an end or purpose in this structure, this action, or in that. It is but a petty "teleology," a poor philosophy, an unsafe attempt on the part of science, to seek to find a " final cause " in every isolated detail-in the shape of a leaf or the coloration of an egg-shell. But with this subject, and especially with some of the grosser exaggerations to which the method has led, I have dealt sufficiently in my book. As a heuristic method, that of the final cause was much in vogue in physics in the days of Euler and of Maupertuis, and in the hands even of Leibniz himself; it has been abandoned by the physicists long ago. I do not think it is to be commended in biology, and the old</page><page sequence="42">460 1) ARCY W. THOMPSON. Baconian argunments are, to my mind, its proper condemnation still. It gives too often the easy answer to those who are only seeking after a sign. It is full of traps set for the unwary and baited for the credulous. It attracts us to the particular case, and blinds us to the general. It "angers me," like Hotspur, and I would argue with it (if I could) as Hotspur with Owen Glendower. Yet there is a higher and broader teleology, which is a -vastly different thing. It is involved in our faith that the world itself is good, and that for good and not evil do the parts of its vast machinery act and interact among themselves, :in ways of which we have often little understanding, and in things that we see as through a glass darkly,-if at all. If we get one little glimpse of it better than another, I think it is again through mathematics. For there is a profound anid lasting lesson (I have quoted it before) in what Colin Maclaurin said, after studying the cell of the bee, that " whatsoever is most beautiful and regular is also found to be most useful and excellent." At least let us recognise, if we venture to apply ourselves to the teleological argument at all, that teleology never stands alone, but that the final and the efficient causes are combined, or to be construed, together. It is difficult to serve two masters, but it is also difficult in this case to under- stand that the Master is One. There is a certain castle amolln, the famous castles of Touraine, and in it a great artist fashioned a staircase-a marvel, a very jewel of a stair. Round the central newel of the staircase wind side by side two separate stairs; the climber by the one stair sees nothing of those who pass or cross him on the other; there is no passage- way between-tuntil you come out at the top. So is it, I suppose, with the teleological and the mechanical categories; and my path lies by way of these last. I know that there is another ladder towards reality, but I am contented with my own. I have been told that Galileo and Newton were at the building of it; and I am heartened by the sight of great names scribbled on the wall.</page><page sequence="43">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAtL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 461 But last, and last of all, let me repeat agrain that in the concepts of matter and of energy, whether quantitative or qualitative, the Whole is not enshrined, and that mechanism is but one aspect of the world. These are the proper categories of objective science, but they are no more; the physicist is, ipsofacto, a mechanist, but he is not by implication a materialist; nor is the biologist of necessity a materialist, even though he may study lnothing but mliechanism in the material fabric and the bodily activities of the organism. It is not merely that in dust we had our first beginnings and that to dust we shall at last return. Our bodies are dust all the while, as is the grass that withers and the flower that fades; and the laws by which our bodies are governed are the laws by which earth and dust are ruled. To this same purport the greatest of the Schoolmen, the Angelic Doctor, spoke (in words which I set in the forefront of my book), telling us across seveni hlundred years, that, inasmuch as the material and corporeal forms of the body non excedant virtutern et ordinem et facultatem principiorum agentium in natura, nulla videtur necessitas eorum originem in principia reducere altiora. And so also a greater than he spoke, saying earth to earth, and dust to dust. But there is a something that is not dust at all, though as in all things else it is found therein; some- thing that is the order of the Cosmos and the Beauty of the World; that lives in all things living, and dwells in the mind and soul of man; something not fulfilled in physics, and which vivifies the dust and makes the dry bones live. You may call it what you please, but it is always the same. You may call it entelechy, you may call it the harmony of the world; you may call it the elan vital, you may call it the Breath of Life. Or, you may call it, as it is called in the Story- book of Creation, and in the hearts of men,-you may call it the Spirit of God.</page><page sequence="44">462 P. CHALMERS MITCHELL. III.-By P. CHALMERS MITCHIELL. THE questioni set for our symposium preseints one aspect of an enduring dispute. Thore have beein, are, and always will be, dispositions reluctant to picture a universe unsustained by creative will. " Creative will" assumes many phases, philo- sophically indifferent. It may be presented as God or gods, entelechy, or vital spark, but is something beyond prediction or conitrol, the subject of observation, not of experiment. Belief in it is an expression at once of inan's humility anid of man's pride; an admission of the limits of our intelligence, and a soothing -exaltation of what is beyond our intelligence. There have been, are, and always will be, dispositions reluctant to picture a universe any part of which is nlot a possible suibject of pre- diction, control and experiment. A part, continually increasing, of the universe has been subjected to prediction, control and experiment, and, although each accession of human power has revealed a wider horizon of the unknown, many reject the idea that the unknown is different in kind from the known. The assumptions necessary to the logical completion of either view are enormous and familiar. The second view is plainly hopeless; inasmuch as success in the intensive or extensive investigation of any bit of nature always discovers new difficulties, always extends rather than contracts the problem, the naturalist, for so, as a matter of temporary convenience, I may call him, is a ready prey for the gibing supernaturalist. His carrot dangles from a pole fixed to his own forehead, and like the donkey in the story, however fast he may runs, he never reaches his objective. But the supernaturalist is in little better case; he has a craving for the incarnation of his principle, observing, it in time and place, now in the plains of India, now in Galilee, now in the secreting epithelium of the lungs, and in due course, to the great content of the niaturalist, bumps up against the evidence.</page><page sequence="45">PHYSICAL, 1BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 463 I believe that the naturalist and the supernaturalist are the exhibitors of two dispositions, and that there is as little chance .of coming,, to a just decision between then, did an impartial judge exist, as there would be in the cases of the agorophobic eel, which, when disturbed, dashes into a drain-pipe, and the ,claustrophobic mackerel which dashes into the open. The wording of the problem I am invited to discuss forms a trap for the unwary, and, indeed, might have been designed to land even so small a philosophical fish as myself, and to show how a naturalist, gasping out his life in the rare metaphysical -medium, assumes the hues of the supernaturalist. Let me restate the problem in terms that are more familiar to me. It becomes threefold. Is it possible, with our present knowledge, -to explain or state the observed phenomena of mind in terms of the observed phenomena of anatomy and physiology, and the observed phenomena of biology in terms of those of physics ? If it be not possible at present, is the trend of science towards such a set of syntheses? Do our observations discover ,differences in kind justifying the assertion that the syntheses -are impossible ? To the first phase of the problem an answer can be given with assurance. At present, mind cannot be interpreted or stated in terms of anatomy and physiology, nor biology in terms of physics and chemistry. Let me insist, however, on the crude fact that mind cannot be interpreted without anatomly and -physiology, nor life without chemistry and physics. We can make no observations on anly mind or on any mental phenomenon -isolated from and independent of structure and physiological -function. Even God always speaks through His prophets. Logic and imagination clarify thought, but so also do cascara and bismuth. I cannot explain the reactions of protoplasm by the properties of solutions and the qualities of chemical -elements, but I cannot observe them apart from these properties -and qualities. It is a commonplace of polemics that life escapes -under the scalpel, that the protoplasm which the chemist</page><page sequence="46">464 P. CHALMERS MITCHIELL. analyses is dead. True; yet not only life, buit blood escapes unider the scalpel, and the protoplasm in (Iying has changed its ehemical reactioni. To the secon(l phase of the problem, the trend of science) it is difficult to give ani answer uncoloured by disposition. For the answer must be interpretation, not mere observation. Somne forty years ago, the categories of science were clear-cut and glitteringc abstractions; in physics what Dr. Haldanie calls "mechanism"bys reigned; in biology function was believed to depend on structure; in psychology, instinct, intelligence, and emotion were thought to be inidependent of one another and of struLcture and funcetioni. Nonie the less, there were confident naturalists who believeld that biology could be explained in ternms of mechanism, and psychology in terms of a function- structure complex. And even within the limits of these categories, progress was made towards synthesis. I need recall only illustrative examples. Many organic compounds have been made in the laboratory from inorganic materials; the attempt to evade this breaking down of the barrier between organic and inorganic by the suggestion that vital action was still involved, to wit, the vital action of the chemist in the laboratory, is only silly, for water is equally inorganic whether it be found in nature or synthesised in a laboratory. Many of the observed phenomena of living protoplasm have been copied by artificial non-living preparations. The fertilisation of the egg-cell, which seemed a supreme case of the action of life upon life, has been aehieved by the action of an inlorganic salt on the ovum. The direct dependence of psychological differences on differences in structure has been denmonstrated at least in pathological cases, and indicated in comparative anatomy. These are notable achievements; and, if the categories of science had remained unchanged, I should claim that an advance had been made in the direction of naturalistic monism,-an advance which had given the naturalists a sure entrance into</page><page sequence="47">P11YSICA'.:L, BEOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 465 forts that supernlaturalists had acsserted to be imiapregnable. Put tlhe categories have shifted, and the advance of knowledge has openied up new vistas of the unknown. I agree with. Dr. Haidaine that what he calls mechanism nio longer satisfies the chemist and the physicist. I will go further, and say that we have learned to see, or to think that we see, function deter- minin, structure in biology, and, perhCaps, even the mind creating its own organs in psychology. Yet, I do not share his apparent triumph. If what we call matter be eniergy that waxes arid wanes, if we have to deal with ions rather than with nmolecules, if the material fabric of the universe be alert rather than inert, then the categories of physics and chemistry are moving towards the categories of biology. If we have to think of function as determining structuire, then our conception of the process of evolution shifts from the hard conception of the origin of adaptations by selection of chance variation, shifts from it nearer to our observat;ion of the triumphant ascent of life. And precisely as the categories of physics and of biology have become less mechanical, they seem to me to approach, not to recede from, the categories of psychology. In anothier respect I agree with Dr. Haldane's presentmenu of his case, but dispute the conclusion towards whiclh he seems to proceed. I agree that organic chemistrv nmust be observed as chemistry of an organism rather than as chemistry in anl organism. The subject of observation is a livino organism, its parts in relation to the whole, acting as parts of the whole, the whole dominating ancl determining the parts. And so, in psychology, what is being observed is this or the other mental quiality of a living body, the livilig body in reaction with a living and a non-living environiiment. We can, in a senise, study the iilorganic isolated fromn the organic; we cannot study the or(ranic isolated from the inorganic. We can, in a sense, study the organic isolated from psychology, but not psychology isolated fromn the organic and the inorganic. In such a senise the working categories of physics, biology, and psychology, are 2 G</page><page sequence="48">466 P. CHALMERS AIITCHELL. different in kind. The properties of 1, 2, and 6, may, for con- venience, be studied independently, and 1 can be studied without considering 2, and 2 without considering 6, but we cannot go far with 2 unless we realise that it is two ones, or with 6 unless we realise that it is six ones. I am disposed to believe that the properties of 1 ilmust explain those of 2 and of 6, although in the case of 6 an apparently new factor, 3, has appeared. But I do not suppose that if we had only ones we could infer twos, or only ones and twos that we could infer three and sixes. Even within what Dr. Haldane would agree to be mechanism, an apparent difference of categories is a matter of observationi. It is convenient and necessary to observe watches and motor cars as wholes, and not as compounds of wheels and levers composed of metals and oils. The machine has qualities of its own, modes of influencing its parts and being influenced by them, which no doubt depend on the properties and qualities of the parts and constituents, but which in practice cannot be inferred from them. Two machines, built by the same mechanics from standardised parts to the same specificationi, behave differently as wholes, get different work out of their parts, react and adjust themselves differently. In a very practical sense there is a dens ex machina, and His level in the celestial hierarchy is inversely as the knowledge of the observer. These are commonplaces, and yet watches and motor cars tare designed on strictly mechanistic principles. The simplest living organism is more complex than the most elaborate machine, and in every detail of its structure avoids the rigidity ,of mechanism. Clearly, it miust be studied as an organism and not as a compound of certain chemnical anid physical pro- perties. But this apparent difference in categories is certainly an empirical conveniience, anid far from certainly a philosophical distinction. I must suppose it to be possible that if a human mind could retain and combine all the indepenident variables in a motor car, he would dethrone the god from the machine,</page><page sequence="49">PHYSICAXL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 467 and predict the conduct of the whole from knowledge of its parts without testing it practically. Yet, we take the easy, probably the inevitable way, even in the case of machinery, and observe. In biology, and still more in psychology, the easy way is the inevitable way. Unabashed, therefore, by Dr. Haldane's facts, which I am not concerned to dispute, I follow my disposition, and declare that the trenid of science is towards synthesis of the categories. There remains the last phase of the problem. I can see no ground for the tremendous assumption that the categories of physics, biology, and psychology are irreducible, if by the phrase more is lneant than that it is convenient to observe the phenomena independently, in so far as independence is possible, and that, therefore, we can go a long way in observation whilst using different working hypotheses, laws, or generalisations for the three subjects. But in my own picture of the universe, the problem as set for us has only a dubious relation to reality. By reality I mean what can be explored but not exhausted, the bottomless well of surprises, that which appears to be outside us and from which the new is always coining into us. Our categories are arranged abstractions of what has come into us, simplified and codified in our endeavour to recreate the exterinal world. In observation of the secreting epithelium of the lung we are nearer reality than in the physiologist's description and explanation of what he has observed; and the physiologist gqua physiologist is nearer reality than when, as metaphysician, he abstracts his physiological abstractions. Lord Morley once described the universe as a " sovereign wonder of superhumani fixedness of law." In my picture of the world, man, and not the superhuman, is the maker of laws, categories or what it may please us to call our abstractions. He achieves fixedness only inasmuch as he departs frorn reality. If observation were to cease, I do not doubt but that we should come to achieve a synthesis of our categories, a logically complete and completely anthropomorphic unity. I admit that the effort towards a 2 G 2</page><page sequence="50">468 L. T. HOBHOUSE. logical and coherent arrangemenit of categories is anl excitingc pursuit. It is, however, the manufactuire and worship of a graven image, and the temple of reality is a house not built with human hands. If the real goal be to answer the question, Are matter, life and mind different aspects of the samiie reality ? then I am more encouraged by observation than by thought. The detection of the same elemient in a distant star and in the fabric of the brain, the analogies between the effect of a cylinder of oxygen on a dull flame, a torpid muscle and a dyinig nmind, lead my imagination further towards a conception of the unity of reality than the subtlest rearrangemiient of categories. And I have a closer vision of the realness of reality given me by the surprises of matter than by the syntheses of thoughts. Perhaps, it is as well to add that I do not forget that matter is a thought of the individual as much as is a category. Yet, there are thoughts that are of the earth earthy, and thoughts that are of categories categorical. All the wonder and the hope and the new knowledge are in the earthy thoughts; all the failure and the despair in the metaphysical thoughts. IV.-By L. T. HOBHOUSE. THE living body in general, and the human body in particular, obviously acts in some respects like a mechanism, while in other respects it appears to act differently. About the differences two questions iimay be raised. First, taking them at their face value, are they all of one kind, reducible to onie formula, or of two or more kinds, such as the organic and the teleolog,ical? Secondly, are they to be taken at their face value, or are they to be regarded as mere appearances due to some subtle complexities of.mechanism not yet adequately laid bare ? To answer these questions we must seek first a definition of the mechanical, the organic, and the teleological. We must,</page><page sequence="51">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYChIOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 469 then, loolk at the actual behaviour of living beings, and ask to which of these they conform. The term muechanism seems to have established itself in philosophy as antithetic to the term teleology. It is an odd usage, since a machine is as clearly soinething contrived with a purpose as anything canl be. But perhaps it is the contrast between the purpose which contrivecL the machine and the blindniess with which it acts that has given the term its currency. Be that as it imiay, the characteristics of mechanism can be seen in a man-made machine, if we look at the details of its action, readily enough, and they are these. In a machine, though all the parts are so compacted as normally to act in relation with one another so as to produce a certain joint result, yet each several part acts uniformly without relation to the rest in response to the forces operating upon it, whiatever they may be. The chain of the bicycle is pulled by the teeth of onie wheel and pulls the teeth of the other wheel. Normally, in its complete fitting, this serves to propel the bicycle, but if either wheel is in somie way out of gear it makes no difference to the chain. Pull it by hand, and the pull will be propagated along its links in just the samne way, and will move the wheel into which it fits in just the same way. The action of the part does not depend on the action of any other part as such, but only on the pull or push affecting it, whatever the source of that pull or push may be. Similarly, the action of the part does not depend on any result accruing froin the action. Given the pull or push, the action is just the same, whether the result is the normal one of propelling the bicycle, or is simply to whirl the hind-wlheel round in the air, or to create a jam arid a wreck. In a mechanical whole, then, each part acts uniformly in response to a given force independently of the condition of other parts,* and independently of the results of its action. * So far as the past condition of other parts has gone to determine the push or pull upon the part considered, it is of course relevant to its</page><page sequence="52">470 L. T. HOBHOUSE. Part of the behaviotur of living beings exhibits a similar independence. A reflex action, for example, like blinking, appears to be the response of a specific structure given uniformly to a specific stimulus. The blood flows along, the arteries projected by an impulse from the heart, much as it might be forced along the dead arteries by a pump. Fluids and gases are interchanged through membranes of the body as outside the body they are interchanged by osmosis. In such processes the body appears to be acting mechanically, but, as Dr. Haldane has shown, when we come to look into each process more lnarrowly a divergence from the mechanical model appears. The interchange of gases and liquids in the living tissue does not correspond precisely to the diffusion in inanimate tissue. The reflex may be inhibited and varied in greater or less degree, and the variations are all in one direction. They are such as to serve the requirements of the entire body as a structure maintaining itself in and through changes. Thus, e.g., the respiratory system works normally like a mechanism for the supply of oxygen and the elimination of carbon dioxide. But the needs of the organism frequently vary, more oxygen being required at one time and less at another, more carbon dioxide needing elimina- tion now and less a little later on. The respiratory system shows a. delicate responsiveness to these needs. Thus, on the face of the facts, it does not act like a bit of a machine, independently of the rest, but in some correlation with the living structure as a whole. Now, it may be that this adjustment is in reality effected by a more subtle mechanism. We can in our machines introduce contrivances, like the gyroscope, which adapt their actions to the r equirement of the whole going concern. The mechanical theory of life is that all adaptations in the living body are the action, but the simultaneous or future state of other parts is not relevant, and even the past state is not essentially so, as a pull or push from any other source will have the same effect. Briefly, the action of any one part does not depend on that of other parts as such.</page><page sequence="53">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCIIOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 471 work of such contrivances, so that, just as there is a gross miechanism of respiration in general, so there are suibtler, more cunning, mechanisms which adapt variations in respiration to varying states of the body, but all by an indirect process which preserves the independence of each several part. The arrange- ment, it is suggested, is such that the force operating on the part does in general vary in consonance with the organic requirement. This is planned out beforehand. But there is no method by which the requirements arising here and now act directly on the part which serves them, i.e., are themselves the forces stimulating the part. Now, the existence of such mechanisms is a question of fact, but for the moment we are concerned with the definitions suggested by a certain view of the facts, and worth clearing up even if it should turn out at the end that there is nothing in nature corresponding to them. The definition suggested by the facts, then, is that in organic activity* the parts do not act quite independently of one another, but the requirements of the whole or, perhaps, of some other part are operatinig influences upon each part. The defini- tion raises questions which I will return to later, but I would look first at certain other aspects of the activity of living beings. I want to light my pipe, and feel, mechanically as we say, in my pocket for the match box. Then I remenlber that in this year, called of grace, 1918, matches are scarce, and I resign myself to the use of a clumsy spill, which I twist and turn about till a light is secured. There is here a little series of actions apparently determined by the end which they subserve. The expression is difficult because the end said to determine the acts does not exist when the act is performed, but the difficulty is, I think, removed if we so far alter the phrase as to * The definition suggested is a definition of organic activity not of an organism or organic whole, which would require a somewhat more general formula. For our purpose, however, which is to contrast distinct modes of action, the definition, which indicates an essential character of organism, will be found convenient.</page><page sequence="54">47 2 L. T. HOBIIOUSE. say that not the end, but its owIn tendtency to produce the end, brings each successive act about. The various acts form parts of a whole which, as a whole, has a certain culnminating result, the lighted pipe, and their causative relations to this result are the true determinants of the acts. They are initiated, dropped, mnaintained, varied, combined,-all in such ways as from moment to momient tend to the result. Thus, the purposive act is caused, so to say, by its own effect or, more strictly, by its tendency to produce the effect, and this causation brinigs each step into an org-fanic relation with the other steps that are equally necessary to the effect. It may be said that this is not an ultimate analysis. A particular movement, e.g., a twist of the spill, is made because it will bring the flame into closer contact with the tobacco, but it is inade by my will as a consequence of knowledge and expectations left by antecedent experience in my mind. The movemlent of the spill, then, is not determined by its effect, nor even that of the hand by its effect, but both by my mind, its equipment, and the present trend of its inmpulse. True, it is within the milnd that the real purpose lies, but here in its true home the essence of purpose will be found to be just what we have described. Ideas, perceptions, efforts, are taken up, pressed, discarded, varied, brou(gllt into relation in such a way as to serve the result, so that the purpose is an organisation of elements determined by relation to the effect which it produces, and if we look to the ceintre of this oroani- sation, in the case instanced a desire, we find its very niature unstateable except by ani inclusion of reference to the result. It is nothing if not an impulse towards an end. The tendency to bring somethinig about does not merely determine but rather constitutes it. Now, purposive activities, as we know themn, rest on a central impulse of this type, and, certain obscure and abnormal cases apart, involve awareness of what we are doing and antici- pation of what is coming. But an intelligent observer from another planet, knowing nothing of human organisation, would,</page><page sequence="55">PHIYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 473 I suggest, infer logically from the behaviour of human beings that here were curiously constructed bodies determined in many of their operations by that which cornes out of those operations, -though by what means he might not be able to tell. His conclusion would be that there was something in those beings which secures that their actions are conditioned by their own causal tendency, and are thus differentiated fulndamentally from other actiolns which do not vary in accordance with any results that emerge from them, but are, so to say, complete in tlhemselves. We have, now, three definitions before us. A whole is 'miechanical when and in so far as its parts act uniformly in response to the forces operating on each of them, not varying in relation to the results of their action or to the state of other parts. A whole acts organically wheni and in so far as the operation of any part is varied in accordance with the requiremeints of the whole as a self-maintainingo structure. A whole acts purposively in so far as its acts are determined by -their own tenidency to produce results affecting the whole. On analysis, I think the second of these definitions will be fouind to resolve itself into a case either of the first or of the third. How does the. " requirenient " of the organism operate upon the part ? It may be that the " requirement" is to be interpreted as a certain physical condition falling short of the normal (or exceedinig it). E.g., the blood is inisufficiently oxidised. The lack of oxidation nmay then act as a stimulus on a certain tissue such as the respiratory centre in the medulla, exciting it to an enhanced activity which redresses the balance. This is at bottom a mechanical explanation, anid if all the recuperative and regenerative processes of the body can be so explained, then they are ultimately mechanical. On the other hand, it may be that the requirement of more oxygen is itself the stimnulus exerting the tissue to an effort to supply it, i.e., the actioni of the tissue is determined by relation to its result. The difficulty in this interpretation is that it</page><page sequence="56">474 L. T. HOBHOUSE. seemns to make the tissue a conscious being acting with a purpose. But it is clear from a review of actions that definite purpose is the most developed species of a genus called conation. In all conation the tendency of the act towards the result is a condition, but in the lowest forms of conation this tendency is obscurely reflected in consciousness and is indirect in action. In the lowest stages it is, perhaps, no more than a felt lack or uneasiness which stimulates whatever be the characteristic activity of an organism, or an organ, to a higher pitch. If this activity begins to give relief, it is maintained till relief is fully achieved, when the need vanishes and tlle effort with it. If it fails the activity is, perhaps, inhibited, giving place to another, or if there is no alternative, it is increased to a maxiimluin fruitlessly till exhaustion ensues. All these modes of response are verifiable, as Jennings has shown, among the lowest known independent organisms, and it is conceivable that something like them, or possibly some still lower grade of conation, should be found in cells of the metazoon. I would suggest, though I m:ust leave it to others with more knowledge to apply and test the suggestion, that so far as the operation of organic parts appears to be domiinated by the requirements of the organism, the operation is either due to a subtle mechanism or to a low grade of conation. If it is such that what we call the requiirement of the organism expresses itself as a force operating by push or pull on the molecules of the partial structure it is a mechanism. If it is such as to cause an uneasiness in the part, and this uneasiness sets up an activity tending to remove it and continued or varied until the removal is effected, then the system is conational.* I doubt * Observe that there is at bottom no question of the part acting without a stimulus, even if you will a force, impressed on it. The question is whether the requirement of the organism or of another part is itself such a stimulus, or whether things are so arranged that the physical condition giving rise to that requirement normally conveys a stimulus. In the apparent result the second method may be brought to</page><page sequence="57">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 475 if there is another alternative. We lhave seen that the pur- posive system is organic in that its parts are esselntially related to the whole which depends upon them. I now suggest that the organic system is in a general sense purposive, i.e., at least conational, becoming purposive at its higher removes. The purposive and the mnechanical, on the other hand, remain fundamentally distinct categories. Whether anything exists in correspondence with the pur- posive category is, oI course, another, and it is a harder, question. There are real and unreal difficulties. The real diffi- culty is to get a definite external test of purposive determina- tion. Machines are made by the human mind and hand to execute human purposes. Though each part of such machines acts independently, yet the machine may be so. contrived, by taking thought for contingencies, as to vary its action suitably to the varying requirements of the purpose which the maker had in view. The limit of such variability is that, however much the machine process may change, it must still be change from one uniform type-process to another. An indefinite lnumber of types of required action may be foreseen and provided for, but they must all be types. Purpose, on the other hand, being bona fide guided by the relation of each particular act to its particular end, may he wholly individual. On behalf of the mechanical view, the reply might be made that the distinction if clear in priilciple is not applicable without ambiguity to actual behaviour. May not the living beinig be a machine devised to meet a vastly greater number of con- tingencies than any inanimate machine, but so devised that each contingency just supplies the necessary stimulus to the necessary parts to act in such a way as is consonant with the maintenance of the organism ? On behalf of this view, there would not be lacking evidence of blindness and mechanical coincide with the first in proportion to the delicacy of the mechanism and the power of providing for all the contingencies of varying requirements.</page><page sequence="58">47 6 L. T. HOBHOUSE. tendency in human, as in other animate, behaviour. Two thingps, however, must be said: (a) There seems no theoretical limnit to the plasticity of lhuman purpose. No range is too vast, no consideration too remote, no correlation too complex to affect our action if occasion calls. We are nowhere finally stopped, and it is this, not the absence of continuity in character, which is what we really mean by freedom. (b) If this freedom of range could in any way be supposed to rest on a pre-established structure, so formed as always to act suitably to the required effect, yet without being determined by the actual relation of the given act here and now to the effect, it would postulate the operation of a creative mind of infinite scope, capable of foreseeing and providing for every detail of our individual lives. That such a structure should be the product of heredity is wildly impossible. Our evolution is from simpler and more general to more highly organized and individualized activity, and can at best only supply a structure suited to respond uniformly to situations of a general character. The mechanical view must break with evolution and postulate a Calvinistic deity and a detailed predestinationl. The main objection to this view is that the world is not one which we can fit in with the possible plans of a mind unconfined by any limitations. There may be evidences of purpose in the world-personally I think there are-but not of unconstrained, undefeated purpose. They are of one or more purposes that are constantly broken, limited, incomplete. Nor is there any way of escape by supposing the infinite mind to be stupid or bad, for in the region of mind badness, stupidity and limitation are at bottom almost convertible terms. There are then strong reasons for rejecting predestination. Predestination-determination by an exterior purpose-seems the only alternative to the admission of determination by internal purpose. The more unreal difficulty is that to which most weight</page><page sequence="59">PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. 477 has been attached. It is supposed that the whole physical world moves mechanically. The living being is physical. Therefore, it moves mnechanically. Either the major or the minor premiss really assumes the point in question. We may grant if we will that everything that is purely physical moves mechanically, but is the conscious living being purely physical ? If the term " puirely " is omitted, the major premiss becomes doubtful. We are not to suppose a physical body somewhere within which a soul is seated, acted on by the impact of molecules and reacting upon them. What we call the physical is just as much of reality as is known to us by the senses and various inferences which we draw by putting the reports of the senses together. We have not the smallest reason to assume that what we so get exhausts the nature of any real thing, unless we find that it explains the whole behaviour of that thing. Now, in the case of living beings, we find just the contrary and, moreover, of one of these living beings, every one of us has indepenident and first hand information showing that it contains elements that are not physical. What is the difficulty of supposing that these elements play their part in determining its behaviour, i.e., that the living being is a psychophysical whole in which the parts are lheld together and their action correlated by elements- forces if you will-which are determinied in their direction by the results to which their actions tend as they affect the living whole ? Objection is, perhaps, taken on the ground of a supposed breach of continuity, but none such exists, if body ancl soul instead of beinc regarded as separate entities are taken as names for distinguishable (and possibly incomplete) aspects of one real being. Or, is it alleged that we are postulating a motionl or change in the direction of a motion without a force to cause it ? If the term force is used, not for a rate of acceleration, but for a cause of motion, tbat is not the case. The conative condition is a force producing motion. The question is merely in what ways and in what directions</page><page sequence="60">478 PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES. such a force acts, and the answer that it is directed towarcls results in no way affects its capacity to direct motion. Or, is it supposed that causation is denied, the truth being that the attempt is nmerely .to discover what kind of cause purpose is ? That the purpose as something found in you or me grows out of what we were before is not questioned. If the objection turns on none of these points, it comes simply to this, that all causation must be mechanical-which was to be proved, but is not.</page></plain_text>
