<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES with Neolithic figurines. Drawing a careful distinction between use and meaning, Talalay surveys the ethno- graphic record to find a range of uses and meanings for small anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures. Applying this to the Franchthi collection leads her to some interesting suggestions. Some of the figurines may well have been toys or dolls. Others, in particular a group of zoomorphic figurines, may have been objects of sympathetic magic. Elsewhere in southern Greece animal figurines appear "suddenly" at the end of the Neolithic, at a time when herding appears to have become a more widespread practice; Talalay suggests that the two are linked, that the production of zoomor- phic figurines allayed the anxieties associated with the risks of expanded animal management strategies. Another group of figurine fragments is even more interesting. There are at Franchthi (and elsewhere in the neighborhood) split-leg figurines-that is, figurines deliberately designed so that the legs can be easily detached. Since, ethnographically, objects made to be split often serve as tokens of contract and/or identity, Talalay suggests that the split-leg figurines mark the participation of persons at Franchthi in a network of relations encompassing five other Peloponnesian Neolithic sites. All of these suggestions are refreshing alternatives to shopworn claims that Neolithic figurines in Southeast Europe represent the goddesses and gods of "Old Europe"; Talalay finds no convincing evidence for the existence of Neolithic religions or fertility cults. The volume finishes on a regional level, with lists and illustrations of the other Neolithic figurines known from southern Greece, which serve to compare Franchthi with the rest of the Peloponnesos. Like Renfrew, Talalay does not want figurine research to run before walking. Considering the metic- ulousness of her work, though, we are treated to a pret- ty brisk hike. Before Writing, Volume I: From Counting to Cuneiform. DENISE SCHMANDT-BESSERAT, with foreword by WILLIAM W. HALLO. University of Texas Press, Austin, 1992. xv + 269 pp., illustrations, notes, index. $ 60.00 (cloth). Reviewed by J. P. Dessel, Bryn Mawr College. Can the primordial origins of literacy be traced to enig- matic ceramic objects, which begin to appear in the Near East during the Neolithic period? This is precise- ly the question that Denise Schmandt Besserat has pio- neered over the last 20 years. "Tokens" are small, hand- made objects ranging in size from 1 to 5 cm. By the late eighth millennium the use of tokens had spread throughout the Near East, where they continued to be used into the second millennium. Although they can be made from stone or other materials, the vast majority are produced from clay. This volume is the culmination of Schmandt- Besserat's research into clay tokens, which began in 1969. It serves to assemble much of her already pub- lished material into a single, comprehensive volume. Initially, Schmandt-Besserat was interested in the earli- est use of fired ceramics in the Near East. Tokens fre- quently turned up in her research on early ceramics, and her fascination with them increased. Her sugges- tion, building on an earlier proposal by Pierre Amiet that such tokens are part of a counting system, led her to consider further the role of tokens in the develop- ment of literacy. In the course of her research, Schmandt-Besserat has examined more 8,000 tokens from 108 sites in Anatolia, Iran, Mesopotamia, Palestine, and Syria. The volume is divided into sections presenting data, interpretation, and a series of typological charts of tokens. The first part is a thorough, well-organized description of the entire corpus of excavated tokens from the Near East. Tokens are divided into plain and complex types, a distinction that significantly figures into her understanding of the history of writing. Each of the basic types is presented separately and organized according to temporal and geographic considerations. The contexts and functional ascriptions of token assem- blages are then discussed in greater detail and arranged chronologically. The section concludes with a discus- sion of the emergence of the more highly evolved off- spring of tokens, such as token strings, envelopes, and impressed tablets. The manner in which this data is presented continu- ally reinforces a unilinear evolution of tokens. Schmandt-Besserat gives the impression that all tokens, regardless of date or location, belong to a unified, coherent, and widely recognizable cognitive frame- work. Part of this framework includes a Neolithic counting system that seamlessly evolved into an abstract writing system by the fourth millennium. The interpretive section is more readable. Here Schmandt-Besserat more fully considers the evolution- ary process represented by tokens and the implications of counting systems for social organization. In this the- oretical arena Schmandt-Besserat's overall approach and use of unsupported inferences becomes problemat- ic. Can a complex and multifaceted process such as the development of writing be understood within the con- fines of a single unilinear evolutionary trajectory? Schmandt-Besserat's first contention that the entire 159</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Neolithic Near East uniformly adopted a single com- prehensive well-developed information processing sys- tem as represented by ceramic tokens is difficult to accept. Were the "meanings" of simple geometric shapes the same at Beidha as they were at Susa? Furthermore, she suggests that the meaning and even the uses of tokens remained essentially unchanged for over 4,000 years, and that token shapes were the direct precursors of particular cuneiform signs. Beyond the remarkable conservatism that this presupposes, it also demands that the hundreds of token types and subtypes, and their meanings, have a logic and consistency akin to grammar and syntax. Such a rigid evolutionary scheme for the development of writing from tokens is too simplistic, and is untestable in any event. There were many attempts at information process- ing and storage prior to the adoption of a successful pictographic script during the Uruk IV period. Cylinder and stamp seals, bullae, potmarks, amulets and emblems, along with tokens, all represent different methods of communication, which were ultimately combined in order to represent and transmit a wider array of information. Many other attempts have, no doubt, been lost over time. But ultimately writing emerged only after basic economic, social, and political structures were well developed and there was a need to store and communicate specific types of information for large Mesopotamian economic institutions. Certain aspects of the token system were no doubt influential on administrative structures and early writing. The use of clay was crucial in creating and maintaining a flexi- ble information processing system. The use of bullae and envelopes was important for verifying origins, con- tents, and destination. But the emergence of an inte- grated writing system, with only some 60 numerical signs but a variety of counting systems, is a unique event, with many different sources. The final section is essentially an appendix. It con- sists of a series of charts of token types. Schmandt- Besserat's typology consists of 16 major types with 500 subtypes. One representative example of each subtype is presented. The complete corpus of Near Eastern clay tokens is fully published in Before Writing, Volume II: A Catalog of Near Eastern Tokens. While these charts are useful in order to visualize the basic shapes and treat- ments of the various subtypes, Schmandt-Besserat acknowledges tokens are handmade and not all highly standardized. However, the validity of deriving ideal types of highly variable artifacts, which are alleged to store and process very specific data, is questionable. The lack of standardization mitigates against her sug- gestion of a single pan-Near Eastern semiotic system. To those familiar with Schmandt-Besserat's approach and data, there is little new offered here other than the convenience of consolidation. The inclusion of ethnographic data on counting is important and laud- able. Discussions of the relationship between changes in social organization, economy, and the ability to store and process greater amounts and more complex data are also important. Schmandt-Besserat carefully con- siders the entire issue of counting and its relationship to writing. But the simplicity of her model is problematic. Can the emergence of writing be understood within a unilinear evolutionary trajectory? And if it can, do tokens in themselves provide adequate evidence for this process? Is writing merely a byproduct of abstract counting'? The work of Schmandt-Besserat certainly deserves attention, and her careful presentation of an overlooked corpus of material culture is praiseworthy. The simplic- ity of her model, however, and subordination of inher- ently complex cognitive systems to a single token-cen- tric view, is unconvincing. Settlement and Society in the Early Bronze Age I and II, Southern Levant: Complementarity and Contradiction in a Small-scale Complex Society. ALEXANDER H. JOFFE. Sheffield Academic Press, Sheffield, England, 1993. ix + 129 pp., figures, appendix, references, index. $37.50 (cloth). Reviewed by C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky, Harvard University. This book contains a thoughtful and thorough study of the emergence of cultural complexity in the southern Levant. Its substantive approach, methodological con- cerns, and theoretical perspective make the volume of interest to archaeologists working beyond the bound- aries of the Levant. In the first chapter the author con- siders aspects of method and theory pertaining to sur- vey and settlement archaeology. The well-known works of Robert McC. Adams, Robert Whallon, and Gregory Johnson in the Near East, 0. de Montmollin among the Maya, and J. F. Cherry in the Aegean are but a few scholars whose works the author critically evaluates. Chapter two considers "The Chalcolithic: Rise and Fall" and points to the author's concern for dealing with the nature and process of cyclicality-continuity and discontinuity. Chapter three considers the emergence of cultural complexity in the southern Levant and its rela- tionship to Syro-Mesopotamian and Egyptian interac- tion, while chapter four considers the urban process in the subsequent Early Bronze II. The treatment of Egyptian-Levantine cultural inter- action in the EB I is of fundamental importance to archaeologists interested in core-periphery relations. 160 [Vol. 61, No. 1, 1996]</page></plain_text>
