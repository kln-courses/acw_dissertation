<plain_text><page sequence="1">RAMSEY SCOTT Sergeant Pepper's Meter Maid: Letters on Parenthood in Present-Day Berkeley Dear Sergeant Pepper, For a long time now I've been convinced that drugs construct a link to history's underside. LSD conjures the sixties; prewar Vienna reclines in cocaine's powdered foothills. On the cover of the album that bears your name, Edgar Allan Poe, Sonny Liston, Sigmund Freud. I write to you because this album forms patterns, along with co-op peanut butter and carob chips, my dreams make into quilts and fold over childhood's pillows. I'm writing to you because half-baked concepts define my labor; my pallid inspiration can't access completion. Experts consider your Lonely Hearts Club Band an unfinished concept album. Visionary excess never completes its projects, but its leavings provide ample room for inebriations others title entertainment. Do the sixties as a decade match this pattern? All I know today dissolves in water, fits into my medicine cabinet, contours deformities in bone and muscle. The mannequins on your album cover remind me that all knowledge is orthopedic. Thanks anyway for your well-boiled optimism, Ramsey Dear Sergeant Pepper, In mornings rain converts to caverns, I paint buffalo on igneous walls my mind makes. Waiting for the coffee to percolate, I watch neighbors shepherd children into cars. The lunch box deserves more respect as an object. I don't know what my neighbors do, no one here seems to have a job, empty store fronts line thoroughfares. The town is a great obscurantist; its mystique arises from the walled-in nature of its being, the fact that borders order its existence. Berkeley, California, virtual incubator, petri dish for the experiments they call family life, begets its own breed of progenitors. Parenthood in Berkeley signals infantilism's rediscovered popularity. In Berkeley only bodies age, dress ing themselves in wrinkles California sun perfects for its palest conquerors, karmic revenge for winters spent out of doors, sampling warmth: fogged in warmth, postrainfall asphalt-inspired warmth, warmth lifting as mist from backyard gardens, warmth as smiles Berkeley residents share like sugar-free mints. The entire town fashions itself humanity's compost, preserving its 531</page><page sequence="2">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW degradable waste for future generations. Sergeant Pepper, I write to you because I don't know what to do with decades. The sixties, your decade, belong to me, but not like a lunch box belongs to a hand; I'm thinking about burnt matches, coffee grains. I don't have the energy to use them as fertilizer, but I can't get rid of them either: that's the sixties. They refuse to leave me alone, they lead me into halfhearted metaphors. As a decade I didn't inhabit, the sixties mark the other side of my beginning?the years my parents became themselves, or someone did. I write to you because I live in Berkeley, fairy godmother of the sixties. I write you letters because I've never been much for deltiology?postcards mark voyages. I seek the permanent imprint, the definitive stamp. On the other hand, fugacity interests me most, and your title epitomizes the impermanence my letters cannot match. They strain for significance, for duration. Sergeant Pepper, nomenclature withheld, origin unknown, corresponding body unspecified: your shifting identities expose my desire for stability. Here's to chasing vulgarities in gas masks, Ramsey Dear Sergeant Pepper, Tonight I drove my pregnant wife to San Francisco. The inevitability of parenthood dissipated in evening traffic; the Bay Bridge's tunnel through the island that marks its midsection must be an unusual feature for bridges, or so I mused, focusing my eyes on the minivan in front of us. I recollect this bit of half-spoken dialogue to remind you that instants must be composed of something, must contain details like cacti. Instants are succulents, I said to my wife, the jade tree or friendship tree, Crassula ovata, instants can't overtake the gardens our minds leave unwatered, but they can be rediscovered long after other vegetation acquiesces to the inevitable. Just drive, she replied, just drive. Sergeant Pepper, I'd like to focus on my concern with the inevitable, with parenthood, but minivans and traffic keep me preoccupied. While my wife and my mother-in-law watched theater, I enjoyed an illicit massage; my ejaculation heralded guilt. Later, in a used bookstore, I came upon John Wieners s Hotel Wentley Poems, a first printing of the original chapbook sitting in a broken wooden bin. I did not buy it but wondered instead about my ongoing inability to purchase the transsexual I'd likely prefer to the female prostitutes I normally frequent. The Bay Bridge is a transsexual bridge, comprised of both bridge and tunnel, I tell myself, just like the prostitute I can't purchase. Transsexuals, like celebrities and people I admire upon first meeting, stifle my language. Others identify my silence as shyness; your name induces similar results. A sergeant, but a forgiving one, tuned to humanity's celebrated dissatisfaction. Waiting for the play to end, I bought a 532</page><page sequence="3">Ramsey Scott cup of coffee and witnessed a panic attack: a woman, about my age. Emer gency personnel lifted her into the ambulance while I ogled. I reminded myself, apropos of nothing, that vases we own sit on high shelves, awaiting flowers we don't buy. Wishing I could play self-hating Jew to a rewarding audience, Ramsey Dear Sergeant Pepper, We share impulses toward mysticism, but your mysticism conceals mili tarism; mine disguises adolescent drug use. On your album cover I remember blue and jackets. The sky dominates faces of people I don't recognize, save The Beatles. My high school English teacher, Mr. Wixon, once told me Edgar Allan Poe could be found in the back row. Today I review your cover art to confirm his claim. Lapels, like castanets, remind me that not all nouns bear equal weight.You signal a decade I can't translate, ideological static. The only military man I recall: "Lovely Rita."When I first listened to your music, rubber bands, like paper clips, seemed vital to me; repositories of mystery, they possessed physical abilities neither anthropomorphic nor mechanical. A Lonely Hearts Club Band couldn't match the importance of a rubber one. Sergeant Pepper, Buffalo Bill, Rocky Raccoon, entities necessarily child friendly, pairing foodstuffs or animals with smart handles. Music informed me of movements my parents' stories confirmed but I confused. Civil rights, antiwar, feminism, Stonewall: buttering my pancakes, history melted into whole wheat. My parents, back-to-the-land, built their own home, grew vegetables. I suffered through haircuts my mother administered: the bowl, a coiffure-based mistake that condenses my entire childhood. Today my wife and I, exhausted, took our socks off in the living room and left them on the floor. Socks on carpet testify to the pleasure lethargy brings. Indecent, the socks gestured to memory's pinfeather: my father considered socks left on the living room floor a personal insult. Today, I understand his extremism. He built the floor himself. Rejections of consumerism my parents made I can't match, but I claim my own forms of guilt. On the way home from work, I stop at an overpriced grocer for premade salads?signature dinners for yuppies?and organic apples. In the dairy aisle, a student of mine from the after-school program I work in, reminder of my half-assed employment, reads cheese labels to her mother. I can't remember anyone's name, but in Berkeley spices are eponyms: Sage, Rosemary, Juniper, Cinnamon. I don't know how to build houses or, like my mother, diagnose diseases. I feel life as something worth fumbling, or rather, I find myself fumbling. I want des perately to succeed in recalling the purpose behind my misplaced desires, but this hope, like the Mississippi, signals a flow and not an expulsion. I am 533</page><page sequence="4">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW writing a theory of frustration; I call it "letters ."The cassette tape that played your music in the deck of our Civic hatchback became stretched and dis torted. Remember facts of the eighties? Sun through a car's windshield warps cassette tapes. "When I'm Sixty-four" drones into drunken garble. As a kid I wondered what army you called your own; the image on the tape's cover didn't help me. In a testament to technology's redundancy, my par ents also had your LP. Contemplating the cassette tape's resignation? inevitable?signals desire's unquenchable thirst. We want things that last, but not for too long. Recently I have begun resigning myself, a process I call inevitable. My mediocre career, my history of entry-level jobs. My ability to forget lyrics. I don't like the Beatles, not enough to share in fandom's inanity. Fans share conversations the way parents trade witticisms about children. Holding on to commonalities that initiate dead-end dialogues, they strain for subtle gestures of superiority: the run-in with a band member, the eldest son's summer camp exploit. Sergeant Pepper, today I write because I hate children, but only because Berkeley parents irritate me, especially those who insist upon your music as childhood's balm. Reeking of marijuana, a parent arrives to pick up his third-grader. Does his inebriation signal antiwar rallies, jazz clubs, conspiracies Weathermen hatch? He fumbles with a pen, signs something, wanders after his child and out the door. Mao died in 1976, the year before my birth; I would become a monk whose faith is built upon this fact, but I smoked my faith in joints rolled to commemorate marijuana's historical import. From Berkeley, Halicarnassus of the sixties, Ramsey Dear Sergeant Pepper, I think I fail in my effort to articulate the importance my inconsistent work history should bear in letters addressed to your irresolute image. I want to carve out of my indigence a metaphor your music makes evident. I'm insisting upon parenthood and Berkeley, theme and location, to administer treatments lost decades deserve. I invoke your image because you figure in myths from which marketers still profit; heralding change, you usher conser vatism in through the back door. What does this skullduggery have to do with my inconsistent employment? Let's let this question linger in the racket kids stir on the way home from school, parading upper-class privilege in pageants starring immigrant nannies toting knapsacks and cello cases. A friend tells me that tracking keeps Berkeley High teenagers busy on week ends: promising material rewards, boyfriends prostitute girlfriends to class mates. We live in Lorin, southernmost outpost of Berkeley, a neighborhood bordering Oakland and edging ever closer to gentrification.Walking the dog 534</page><page sequence="5">Ramsey Scott past neighbors whose skin color doesn't match my own, I wonder what my whiteness means. Is your music the material factor I seek when I look for evidence that my cultural makeup accentuates pallid features? My fugitive paychecks suggest shortcomings histories of oppression can't explain. Only witches drink Strega; temper your thirst with Ativan. Ramsey Dear Sergeant Pepper, Today I think parenthood, the anxiety it brings, has everything to do with lost limbs and photographs. Think about pictures you throw out, extras that don't belong in the scrapbook. Once, for a birthday party, my friends and I attended an exhibition basketball game and afterward, with my new camera, I had a chance to have my picture taken with Clyde "The Glide" Drexler.Then I took my friends' pictures with him. Each time I cut them out of the picture; you can see a friend's arm, and then Clyde's arm, arching over a body that's not there. Parenthood must be like this body, the one left out of the picture, the one you know someone reaches toward. The hypogeum I imagine connects homes to demimondes, refigures the domestic as momentary respite from life's disreputable constants. Take my indolence, for example; I ought to descend into my hypogeum where hoodlum friends consider torpor refreshing. Instead, I linger on side streets, looking through ferns at discarded apple cores. Tie-dyed, my imag ination staggers against concrete: what I can't fathom concerns the sixties as ideological collapse, liberalism's last hurrah. Agent Orange, napalm: chemical warfare announces realities Berkeley gardeners, masked against allergens and preening roses for competitions, can't answer. This town refigures the Great Depression as what happens when radical thinkers earn enormous wealth. Strapped for revolutionary ideas, rich intellectuals sit down with pinot noirs and consider investments in third homes. Today I visit the independent bookstore; in the poetry section, I notice half-assed efforts, poems young, self-admiring self-starters smartly address to peers of similar stature. Nobody wants thinking anymore, they want companion ship. Just do your homework, I tell my students, but homework names worksheets teachers pass around to avoid more demanding activities. Everyone today thinks time means something you expend while doing something. Try indolence, I want to say, let laziness take over, grow weeds not flowers. People want to think their leisure time means something, means they're not wrecking everything worthwhile by turning capitalist tricks at the fuckholes they call jobs. And what do you care, Sergeant Pepper? Today I prefer the Supremes, but I'll return my lonely heart to you after the half-dead ex-hippies that run this hellhole sell the last stock they 535</page><page sequence="6">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW need in order to buy another fucking ski lodge. Until then, I reserve my malaise for me alone. Don't write back, call me; I want to hear your voice, "Turning again," as Jaques says in As You Like It, "toward.. .pipes and whistles." Ramsey Dear Sergeant Pepper, Please excuse the Shakespearean dramatics of my last letter; drinking wine, I fashion Berkeley's debilitation my own. In truth the franchise I most cherish must be more folkish, almost pedestrian; Shakespeare, Fonda's ancient predecessor and ongoing superior, doesn't interest me. My father watched Easy Rider upon its release in 1969. He claims that at the movie's climax, the murder of Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda brought cheers from the crowd surrounding him in Huntsville, Texas. The lesson isn't thatTexans don't like hippies; it's that things are not, as John andYoko understood, "get ting better all the time." David Farragut, commander of the US. Navy during the Civil War, conjures no memory for me when, stepping toward the bakery, I see a flier that bears his name. The flier lies in the gutter, evidence that the lecture to be delivered on the long-deceased commander's exploits might not garner the audience the lecturer hopes for. Everyone in Berkeley has a favorite bakery save me. I don't like baked goods, but I buy them for my pregnant wife. Nonetheless, I find I must project an admiration for pastries in order to entertain the counter help at the bakery, enthusiasts for every thing sugar soaked and oven heated, who prattle on about fruits in muffins and organic flour. What doesn't interest me about baking is the formerly heated but now room-temperature trajectory of its existence, a trajectory that maps the sixties. Baking, like pottery, seems to me a holdover of some bohemian communal spirit, but it ends in domesticity, however disguised by sage and incense, a domesticity that proposes to replace all the terrible domesticities that came before. In the bakery, patrons trade stories of garlic presses and filleting techniques. This, Sergeant Pepper, is where the sixties have landed: the Whole Earth Catalogue turned Williams and Sonoma. I want my LSD, but I don't want to expect it; I want it in the water supply where it belongs, I want psychedelia to reclaim terrorism as its proper ground. I'll buy any pastry infused with hallucinogens; it's the sugar and cooked fruit I can do without. Good luck garnering cheers when they learn your band has only an intro and its reprise, Ramsey 536</page><page sequence="7">Ramsey Scott Dear Sergeant Pepper, In an antiques store nearby a dealer explains that the device in my hand combs noils out of wool before spinning. Inevitably, he says, someone asks; I haven't asked, but his explanation drags on regardless. I resign myself to the inevitable. I make myself a sign of the inevitable: it's the sun or some such, a mythic thing hieroglyphs capture. Back at home, I sketch an image. Later, in front of my students, I display my drawing. My students admire what I sketch because they don't know what sketching should be. The inevitable confronts me in children's linguistic contortions; they speak in time's language, the voice introducing death's approach. Scientifically, my mother likes to say.Whenever she says "scientifically" an explanation follows. A great believer in science, she considers many events inevitable. I find words attach themselves to people, or people to words. "Inevitable" clings to my mother. I don't mind the inevitable, I've resigned myself to antique theories and to death, the voice its usher. Nonetheless I find parents hesi tant to introduce children to the inevitable, hedging death with artificial sweeteners and pathetic appeals to religious solutions. Sergeant Pepper, I don't mind death, but California's sweetness irks me. My former place of residence: New York City. I try to adjust to Berkeley by rethinking my own habits, reminders that surroundings don't erase lifelong proclivities. In truth habits only sand-castle tendencies. My wife is pregnant, and her pregnancy signals an acquiescence we both acknowledge, one to Berkeley's domesticity. In Berkeley everybody's pushing some stroller, pedaling a bike behind which a child-transporting device trails, navigating the three streets that lead some where, cars strapped down with safety seats, stepping down BART stairways toward trains, hands gripping next generation's commuters. All this motion disguises the return of the fifties, conservatism clad in progressive fabrics. We may buy organic cotton, but our homes have security systems military men designed. When I throw my no-hitter, I want your kid to make the last out, Ramsey Dear Sergeant Pepper, Wandering a Berkeley side street, I stop at a fence made from old Volvo hatchbacks. One thing I notice here: no one reads. Crafts and baking, garden ing and antiquing leave little room for books. In New York you see people reading all the time, on the subway, in the park. New Yorkers make of read ing an activity, the way Berkeley residents ride bicycles, but even on the subway New Yorkers read gracefully. Berkeley's timelessness, the fact that its residents group-sing Grateful Dead songs the rest of the world long since forgot, also defines its influence on adults, whose demeanors, hobbies, 537</page><page sequence="8">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW stances or modes of being in the world remain retarded by Berkeley's Dr. Seussian atmosphere. The skateboard maintains its popularity with people Jerry Rubin would have called old. And while I too favor transportation alternatives, the image certain folks cut, their unshapely silhouettes lumber ing by on the thin frames of undersized bicycles, leaves me aesthetically underwhelmed. Bicycle helmets remain uncool, and even if they declare safety, the relative risk posed by Berkeley's half-dead chronically empty sub urban avenues renders most headgear superfluous. A gnu and a wildebeest are one and the same. An ocarina is also known as a sweet potato. Nonetheless, common meanings rescue language from redundancy. Choosing between inebriation and crapulence, I try my hand at both via different, similarly illegal substances. Like children whose fears lurk under beds or behind closet doors, the adults that claim Berkeley as their place of residence localize fear in unlikely places. The plastic water bottle, the neigh bor who smokes cigarettes on the porch, the contents of the day care center's cabinets; each of these entities has its role as the monster Berkeley parents fear most. What concerns me today: my resignation to the conventional. Living in Berkeley, I fend off my participation in suburbia's inevitable slide toward the familiar. Consider the mission position parenthood's sexual equivalent, parenthood its insipid conclusion. I like kids, but I don't want to wake up to my own children singing "When I'm Sixty four." With mortal and pestle I grind out these letters, Ramsey Dear Sergeant Pepper, This morning I rose like a Morisco, draped by religious oaths addressed to someone else's god. My wife craves mortadella; I know where to buy it in Brooklyn, but I can't find it in Berkeley. Could life be like driving toward mortadella? Or like mortadella itself, a soft, pink condensation of leftover meats, an ongoing search for the lone pistachio. The moon still out, I wandered with the dog toward stanchions that make of our street a virtual cul-de-sac. The health food my parents fed me made baloney verboten. I want to make an observation to illustrate the world that misses you, that you're missing, blissed out somewhere, craving stardom but reveling in its recession. I like to think of you as the John and Paul dyad that never existed, a perfectly amiable male union. Perhaps that's why I write you these letters: I recognize that in addressing you I have not one audience, but two. What's more, I envision you as the homosocial unit I can't access through my marriage. Nonetheless, these features make you neither wise nor receptive; in fact, they make you remote, a transcendent figure only drugs allow me to contemplate with any precision. Think of the sixties, humanity's public answer to centuries of 538</page><page sequence="9">Ramsey Scott secret indulgences. Berkeley bakers mimic the sixties in vegan brownies and inventive pizzas incorporating nettles, oysters, aged cheeses, raw eggs. Suburban planning constrains car traffic, stop signs bear graffiti against driv ing. These aren't observations, they're antispiritual rants that mistake precise language for blows against the idiocy others call religion. In fact what I desire most this morning: a cane. Not to help me walk, but to swing through the air or wave at passersby.Yes, some college students lurk around certain Berkeley streets, but once you leave the critical center the university thinks it marks, everything's transformed by kinship's mysterious caverns. Suburban and subterranean, the Berkeley family stakes its claim to generational roles by turning maturation on its head. Children, fonts of wisdom, enforcers of tradition, face attention-deficient parents who can barely focus on the out door hobbies that distract them from more pertinent tasks. It's parents who show no signs of maturity. I stand in the front yard of the home that houses our apartment; overhead, the Goodyear blimp floats; a football game draws cars to the stadium up the hill. Who doesn't want to be like that blimp? In your songs and movies that feature them, anything becomes a dirigible; air borne, contagious, I drift toward failed serums, imagination galvanized by former intoxications I don't want to rediscover so much as understand anew; reenacting failure, I recollect bum acid purchased at arts and crafts fairs masquerading as hippie revivals. Let's make a pact to commemorate failure through two-word phrases. The sixties, for example. To hangovers, salves for egos overheated by alcoholic confidence, Ramsey Dear Sergeant Pepper, The sweatshirt?Berkeley's favorite fashion piece?remains in vogue, even if its long-heralded successor, the fleece pullover, maintains a majority in the well-heeled districts toward the hills and in the inappropriately named "Gourmet Ghetto." How a city that prides itself on sensitivity can call one of its wealthiest neighborhoods a ghetto, while to the south real zones of impoverishment stretch toward Oakland's notoriously less well-off streets, remains a mystery that soy lattes in cups of recycled cardboard can't explain. I work at an elementary school here, a moderately employed after-school drone. The kids that entertain me maintain certain characteristics childhood teaches, but I can't understand their progenitors. In Berkeley, bumper stickers abound; desperate for recognition, left-wingers soothe guilt by advertising disapproval of the government, oil companies, farmed salmon, school vouchers. Berkeley recently voted to impeach the president. What importance this smug gesture, apparently part of a larger claim (cultural and political superiority), has to the rest of the world remains unclear. Regardless, it too 539</page><page sequence="10">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW strikes me as a sign that the political sophistication, the self-satisfied so-called liberal outlook Berkeley residents manage both to share and struggle over endlessly, serves as insufficient drapery for the adolescent lifestyles residents ask one another to overlook. Every adult of a certain age and political per suasion has a story about Berkeley. These recycled narratives grate on me. Remnant of changes the sixties failed to bring, Berkeley stands as hippie dom's last outpost, reminder that conservatism remains America's foremost product: manufacturer of excess, trimmer of the world's flesh, enforcer of fear. Once inside the valley of Hinnom called Berkeley, two forces define daily life: wealth and poverty. The liquor store can't match the Whole Foods shopping experience, but if you don't have a car or the time to make your way across town, the products lining its shelves will fill bellies. Sergeant Pepper, I care about politics, but I don't think a few vegetarian meals make things better, I don't think my liberal inclinations make things better, I don't always buy organic, I don't always recycle. I confess my shortcomings to you because I know you understand failure, you understand politics as a personal obligation to criticize without regret.You offer your own identity as a shelter for those of us stranded by political indecencies. I should clarify: when I say politics, I mean something specific, something like a blue military jacket's shiny brass button, but this something always changes. When I say politics, I mean something you can lose after a few trips through the washing machine. Composting my coffee grinds, I pledge my devotion to human waste. I'm hedging my bets. If the revolution comes before I die, I hope it kills me. To revolution; if not revolution, to impending environmental catastrophes sunsets remake as beauty, Ramsey Dear Sergeant Pepper, Tonight I think about flowers, and because I don't know anything about them, I plan to make my dispatch brief. Flowers, like historical facts and geographical details, become measures of learning: tidbits thrown as con versation pieces wherein speakers declare a certain knowledge. I avoid poetry about flowers; too often, I can't imagine the actual blossom to which the poet refers. I think what I mean to say concerning flowers is that igno rance remains a value I can't do without, something I find has its own rewards. In ignorance I find a curative for elitism, that which defines the sector of humanity that draws my malaise. The Beatles don't interest me. I don't have time to gather the facts fandom requires. I have the time, but not the interest. Perhaps I have a little interest, and a little time, but not enough time or interest. I think the Beatles end for me when I see Paul singing in 540</page><page sequence="11">Ramsey Scott the middle of the Super Bowl. Commercial reality crushes countercultural myth. You, like your progenitors, grow small under the shadow capitalism's great silhouette casts. Perhaps that's where I take my interest: standing in the same shadow, I feel the communal swoon your wealth wrings from onlook ers. We wait for wealth to awe us, we shudder with wonder at the great accumulations others amass, amazed that labors we contribute disappear and then reemerge as somebody else's megamillions. Flowers, like bands, wallpaper wedding receptions. What I want to remember about you marries carnation to incantation, evanesces when pigments become chants monks make over candlewax. Ramsey Dear Sergeant Pepper, I'd like to crown couches in an essay dedicated to the cushioned nature of their beings. Monarchs of the domestic, couches ground family life. Let's toast to televised excess and commercial indulgence. Your music feeds ado lescent cravings, croons to soccer moms whose desire for countercultural authenticity can't get beyond nostalgia's pop outcroppings.What do I know of your progenitors, the Beatles? The Sergeant Pepper I imagine amalga mates John and Paul, but leaves room for George and Ringo. Listening to my parents' records, I counted knots in the wooden ceiling while lying upside down, the couch my correspondent. To this day I can't dance. I blame the Beatles for my choreographic shortcomings. In my unmusical upbring ing the Beatles take the place commas assume in these letters: they interrupt, but allow for further error. I write to you because your unoccupied body signals the blank sign the sixties never occupy, an emptiness where history abandons me to musical pleasure. And what accompanies this pleasure? My sense that the sixties, like the concept album that bears your name, go unfinished. Idealism swallowed whole by capitalism's boundless appropria tive apparatuses, the sixties consume hope. Just visit Berkeley; you'll see that domesticity reforms radicalism according to tricks of the market. The stroller converts sit-in sites, remakes them as avenues for family performances in which couples take turns playing the disgruntled spouse. In truth I ache for your return, but my cynicism, coached by your disappearance, reemerges when I see upper-middle-class children group-singing Beatles songs for school pageants. "Yellow Submarine" has traded psychedelic undertones for sophomoric innocence; I blame you. In your absence idiocy becomes our most profound product. In Berkeley, adults claim superiority, convinced that personal political awareness transcends America's global ignorance; amidst well-heeled liberals, I find my nostalgia for idealistic earth enthusiasts sapped by post sixties flakiness that yoga dupes and hibiscus-tea-sipping hybrid 541</page><page sequence="12">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW driving soul-searching middle-aged divorce lawyers epitomize. Everyone has a cause, but no one's going to sacrifice anything, myself included. I'm going back to sleep, but not to the soothing sounds of your music, which remind me that movements, like pop music, become useful refrains when taking action seems like too much of a risk. Let's meet in Yalta; from its mountainous coastline we'll carve our own versions of twentieth-century history, Ramsey Dear Sergeant Pepper, I think of you when I clip my toenails; that's the present I say, leftover deposits the body converts into protective coverings. In my effort to purge myself of the reminiscences your music conjures I read Sei Shonagon's Pillow Book. Walking to work, I think of the dirty nun that sings outside the empress's room, waiting for some food or small favor. Growing up in Oregon, I fashioned the remnants of the commune that once populated the forest into ruins of early European settlers. A half-built log cabin became, for me, a pioneer's makeshift shelter. Perhaps ruins contradict their own histories, become timeless as the chronological orders that begat them crumble and rot in forgotten mezzanines. Parents teach history as the glitches that interrupt recording technologies. When the video camera fails or the digital camera malfunctions history emerges as the undocumented. Family histories use the past to account for current inadequacies; my pillbox empty, I turn pedestrian and walk toward sobriety. I'd like to own a mattock and spend days chopping up soil for seeds I don't own. That's how I understand labor. Effort expended without purpose. Childbirth must be something else, Matterhorn to my mattock. At a party given by friends of my parents, a bearded guru asked me what animal I'd like to be. I must have been about six. His attitude exuded child-speak expertise, as though I ought to appreciate his ability to speak down to me. A dog, I said, refusing to elaborate, but thinking of my family pet's ability to run, sleep, eat. The guru said he'd like to be a bird, and blab bered about soaring, eyesight, hawks, wind. I think this exchange condenses what I don't like about your generation: you understand ornithological traits as superior to canine practicalities. My parents' friends owned llamas. They encouraged potluck sensibilities, but fed idealism to inbred Labrador retrievers. If these letters arrange themselves like leaves, let orthostichy guide their arrangement, Ramsey 542</page><page sequence="13">Ramsey Scott Dear Sergeant Pepper, Today I listen to your Lonely Hearts Club Band thinking of the Bhagwan Rajneesh. Cult leader of my youth, the census his schemes take of Oregon profile a birdbrained populace eager for mystical guidance. I grew up around classmates whose parents exchanged Ken Kesey novels for the Good Book. Born-again Christians may be rare in Berkeley, but the faith with which res idents pursue shiitake mushrooms suggests that idealists grow old as gour mands, transcending earthly concerns in moments of culinary bliss. At the corner store, I purchase frozen corn dogs, my pregnant wife's current craving. Outside, drug dealers' cigarettes bob and weave, mapping ritual movements. A poster advertising exterminators invokes termites. Back at work, giggling students ask if I'm a hippie. This noun conjures style, artifice. On the way home from work I stop at Berkeley Bowl, a grocery store with progressive trappings, but I can't get through the logjam they call the bulk food aisle and head home empty-handed. What kind of parent do you think I'll become? A red, flowered corduroy bag my wife calls the "Dad Bag" holds books that don't fit in my backpack. "Only a dad can be seen carrying such a bag," she says, explaining her nomenclature. When I taught at a college in Brooklyn, a student told me the dad bag demonstrated a confident masculinity. I'm not a dad yet, but I carry the bag. Perhaps I'll be a dad like Al Morse, childhood neighbor, a born-again who raised his kids on Rambo movies and reruns of The A-Team. Let's recall these entertainment extravaganzas, propaganda (should I say morality?) tales in which men emasculated by Vietnam regain their spunk through courageous acts of violence. Silas, son of former hippie Al, eschewed evolution for creationism, though he excelled at science; last I heard he was studying neurobiology somewhere down south. Perhaps the willful ignorance of the researcher is the scientific equivalent of the soldier who pursues what they call bravery in a battle against impossible odds. Rather than soldiery I prefer an olla podrida of intoxication, insubordination, and molestation, a melodramatic defenestration of Das Kapital. My childhood dictionary exhibits four varieties of the mechanical nut: hexagonal, wing, square, cap. One is circled. Can you guess which? Ramsey Dear Sergeant Pepper, Remember Rhodesia, Burma, Abyssinia, Kampuchea? A sergeant like yourself should respect former names as ciphers for remote operations. My grandmother brought me maracas after a trip to Guadalajara. Was this gesture meant to communicate via a code I never understood? Rhythmically underprivileged, I used my maracas as paddles and swatted Nerf balls around the living room, careful not to target the record player, my parents' finest 543</page><page sequence="14">THE MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW appliance. George (my father) showing me how to clean records: a recollec tion that fails to account for technology's supposed aversion to nostalgia. What forms of outdated knowledge will I provide for my children? We light our menorah, but can't remember the proper prayer. No matter; religion is, for us, mescaline in vodka, or the miracle we comprehend when at last the coffee brews. God? We write that topic off as the proper toxin for meshugaas. I write from bed, contemplating F. A. Mesmer to avoid Freud; thanks for listening, Ramsey Dear Sergeant Pepper, My brother's recipe for opium tea leaves me almost euphoric, incredibly constipated. For a long time now I've been thinking of the word "onus."To me, it doesn't signify duty or responsibility; it points sideways to "anus." As a child, I believed anus was a name, like Amos. I had to remind myself con stantly of the difference, like reminding myself to say "kernel" when I read "colonel." In the newspaper today, a Berkeley resident (who, the paper sug gests, "earned his lefty stripes" during years of public school teaching) rails against the homelessness that interrupts his ride through town in his new convertible. In high school, I wrote letters for Amnesty International and imagined firebombing National Guard outposts; have I too earned the right to abandon my politics for material indulgence? Shall we reserve this right for baby boomers alone? I'm blending my yogurt with painkillers. I plan to nap my way toward fatherhood. My wife sleeps already, Joe Wenderoth's Letters to Wendy's spread-eagled across her belly. I don't want tickets to Ravi Shankar, I don't want freshly squeezed organic orange juice.

Will my wife become a multigravida? If so, I plan to communicate displeasure to my brood in pipes and whistles, skipping middle age for the fragility of the elderly. A local kennel's logo claims that "It Takes a Village to Raise a Pet."

Yesterday we woke to frost, Berkeley frozen over, an aberrant weather pattern descending. In the book I'm reading for the dis sertation I don't feel like writing, "inextricably linked" appears, a phrase my teacher once flagged in my own writing, citing general overuse. The author asserts autobiography as political protest, while I envision the local diner's plat du jour.These sentences trace Sei Shonagon's subject, "people who look pleased with themselves"; I leave it to you to decide who's who.
