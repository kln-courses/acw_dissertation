<plain_text><page sequence="1">Janice Hewlett Koelb "This Most Beautiful and Adorn'd World": Nicolson's Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory Reconsidered Next to indecency of expression comes meanness, [. . .] when the grandeur or dignity of anything is diminished by the words used, as in the line : ' There is a rocky wart upon the mountain's brow ēf - Quintilian, Institutio Oratoria, bk. 8.3.48-50. Marjorie Hope Nicolson's 1959 Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory, reprinted for a new audience in 1997 and reintroduced by William Cronon as a classic text in ecocriticism (vii-viii), still has many lessons, both positive and negative, to offer ecological literary critics. After nearly half a century, the positive lessons have already been thoroughly assimilated into the current critical discourse, but those negative lessons still await serious consideration. Certainly scholars have already taken to heart the notion that a "green" criticism- one that investigates the reciprocal relation between literature and the non-human environment- is crucial to a proper understanding of British Romanticism (Kroeber). And certainly all of us have become far more sensitive to the need for placing literary texts in their full cultural-historical context, as Nicolson taught us to do by focusing on the interplay among seventeenth-century British geology, theol- ogy, and a developing sense of landscape now called "Romantic" (Cronon xii). But now it is time to examine carefully the way in which Nicolson's handling of evidence from periods before the Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 16.3 (Summer 2009) Advance Access publication July 28, 2009 doi:10.1093/isle/isp063 © The Author(s) 2009.

Nicolson was charting new terri- tory for literary scholarship, and though she never consciously misled her readers, she did have some blind spots. Shedding some light on those blind spots can perhaps help others avoid similar pit- falls lying in the path of ecological literary critics who attempt, as sometimes one must, to make arguments about historical processes that span many centuries and cross many national and linguistic boundaries. Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory makes a startling and influen- tial claim about a late-seventeenth-century revolution in landscape perception. Notwithstanding some disclaimers in her preface about her focus on Britain (xvii), Nicolson defends a general proposition about European culture: During the first seventeen centuries of the Christian era, 'Mountain Gloom' so clouded human eyes that never for a moment did poets see mountains in the full radi- ance to which our eyes have become accustomed. Within a century -indeed within fifty years- all this changed. (3) The change, according to Nicolson, marked the triumph of something akin to the spirit of "Greeks who worshiped their gods on Olympus and Hebrews who, lifting up their eyes to the hills, remembered men who had walked familiarly with Deity upon 'the Lord's holy hill'," over Roman distaste and "primitive Christian" distrust for "that which is high" (45). This positive revaluation of mountains correlates with a new and more general emotional response not just to moun- tains but "to the mighty, the majestic, the mysterious aspects of Nature, to a sense of vastness and spaciousness never expressed- and apparently never felt- before the closing years of the seventeenth century" (27). European experience of mountains before the eight- eenth century can, for her, be charted as a fall from original Greek and Hebrew Glory into a straight-line decline through Roman and Christian Gloom to the warts, wastes, and pustules of the seventeenth-century British rhetoric that fascinates her. She rightly focuses on this pathologizing descriptive rhetoric and wants to understand its cultural implications, so sharply does the descriptive rhetoric seem to reject mountains as in any positive sense aesthetic. Nicolson is at her most illuminating when she examines this episode in British intellectual history that attempted to square the</page><page sequence="3">Most Beautiful and Adorn'd 445 Biblical account of the earth's special creation and deluge with the history of the earth that was emerging from the new science of geology. Her book's most admirable and original quality is that in 1959 it opened the doors onto British science and theology as a cul- tural context for the descriptive literature of eighteenth-century Britain. She lays open this quarrel between theology and geology as one of the ways that Britain became mountain-conscious and increas- ingly attracted to visiting, describing, and writing about them. As William Cronon explains in his Foreword, One of Nicolson's favorite exemplars of this transitional moment is Thomas Burnet, whose Sacred Theory of the Earth (1681) presents mountains in what seems to a modern reader the most paradoxical of ways. On the one hand, Burnet quite explicitly declares mountains to be among the ugliest objects in God's creation- and yet, on the other, they are also capable of eliciting in him the most spiritual of feelings. The further into the eighteenth century we go, the more we find this latter emotion predominating. By the end of the eighteenth century, when mountains had clearly become one of the chief landscapes of romanticism both in England and on the Continent, these once ugly places had become for many the nearest thing to a divine cathedral on earth, (xi) What is most instructive about Nicolson's account of the Burnet con- troversy is the cultural insight she gains from seriously examining the description of one particular subject, mountain landscapes, across various discourses within a carefully focused historical context. In 1959, she was in effect a new historicist avant la lettre. But because her focus is limited, she is unable to explain how the British got all the way from Gloom to Glory through the sort of mountain- consciousness stimulated by Burnet's paradox, if indeed the British did generally dislike mountains as much as she claims; nor by focus- ing on seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Britain can she give any- thing like an adequate account of European engagement with mountain landscapes upon which to found such an absolute thesis as "never for a moment" during 1700 years "did poets see mountains in the full radiance to which our eyes have become accustomed," if indeed our eyes have become so accustomed (3).1 A great deal of persuasive evidence, however, leads to a different conclusion: it is not Mountain Glory but Mountain Gloom that is most unusual in European history. The theory that mountains are</page><page sequence="4">446 isle warts and scars defacing the earth, ruins of a broken world, is a late, sophisticated one. This extreme position is, as Nicolson shows, not unprecedented, but then nothing is completely unprecedented. More to the point, this bizarre notion is not at all typical of either the Romans or the "primitive Christians" in whom she locates the origins of Gloom. It is far from mainstream Christian theology as expressed in major religious epics such as Dante's Commedia or Milton's Paradise Lost , a tradition that ought to be heavily weighed if we are concerned about literary and cultural history. Romantic mountains have roots just as deep in the spiritually figurative mountains where Dante and Milton situate their earthly paradises as in the enthusiastic mountain descriptions of the eighteenth century. In arriving at her conclusions, Nicolson is guilty indeed of gloss- ing over the 1700 years of Gloom; of ignoring visual art; of patroniz- ing Cicero, Virgil, Lucretius, Dante, and Petrarch; of reducing all classical and neo-classic aesthetics to a single uncontested formula of beauty as smoothness and proportion; of dismissing the figurative mountains of earlier visionary poetry, just because they are figurative, while embracing the metaphysical conceits of seventeenth-century poets and the visionary figurations of Romantics as transparent evi- dence of popular taste and sentiment; and even more extraordinarily, of paying tendentious and scant attention to earlier descriptions of actual mountains: just the sort of description she so ably and care- fully analyzes in the tortured and extravagant reflections of her seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Britons. One cannot in a brief article set such a massive historical record completely straight. It will have to suffice here only to review Nicolson's argument and offer a few of the more striking historical counter-examples that need to be accounted for in any revision of her now generally accepted views.2 In so doing, I argue that Romantic mountain-description, and more generally the emotion often figured by Romantic place-description, has other and deeper historical roots than the roots Nicolson (correctly) identifies as a response to seventeenth-century British theology and geology. Many of my examples are in fact suggested by Nicolson's disclaimers and qualifi- cations. She often acknowledges exceptions to her rule, but without arguing why she has not examined these exceptions more carefully or given them more weight. A more patient examination of texts that go against the grain of Nicolson's argument, especially the more fig- urative texts, will help clear at least a provisional path through the Mountain Gloom that Nicolson finds in European culture. We will then be in position to see more clearly a general, and very old, aesthetic problem that remains unexamined by Nicolson, though</page><page sequence="5">Most Beautiful and Adorn'd 447 it is crucial to her claims about mountains and is implicit in her argument. The question is this: how does the presence or absence of verisimilitude in nature-description operate when the description as a whole is read as a figuration of something else less tangible? The answer will always depend on the author's and reader's shared beliefs about that "something else"; it is the critic's task to discover just what those beliefs might be. When we encounter a literary mountain (or a literary rose or nightingale) offered as a figuration, we surely cannot simply conclude that, because it pays what we consider to be insufficient attention to the object's physical attri- butes, the author or his culture must not have liked mountains (or roses or birds), or that such figuration proves, ipso facto , a lack of observation, interest or approval. The problem can be expressed in another way: What is the point of depicting nature "accurately" in painting or in poetry? Why do it at all? If I personally have decided that there is no point in painting cherries in such a way as to fool the birds, my decision tells you nothing about how I feel about actual cherries or about what I think the role of cherries, as an image or concept, is or ought to be in poetry or art. Issues of this kind were well-rehearsed in classical and Renaissance debates about mimesis and verisimilitude.3 Pliny complained that, although the famous sculptor Myron could sculpt the body realistically, his art could not express " animi sensus," the feelings of the mind or heart or soul (170; bk. 39.19.58). Disjunctions of the sort that worried Pliny and the Renaissance art-theorists are precisely those that emerged again, and powerfully, in Romantic aesthetic and poetic manifestos. Christian Distrust Nicolson's general approach to "primitive Christian" taste is to give no weight at all to the facts cited in her footnotes about Christians liking actual mountains before 1700, to read mountains fig- uratively only when they symbolize a Gloomy concept such as pride or difficulty, and to infer from these figurations universal distrust of mountains among Christians, and then not to read any other possibly more cheerful figurative mountains from the age of Gloom- to dismiss them as mere allegories and symbols that make a moral point (49 n.17; 44-62). Indeed, one methodological inconsistency of Nicolson's entire Gloom vs. Glory tableau is that she deprecates allegory, while reading allegorically when it suits her thesis, and while writing allegorically in the bargain. Nicolson's topic is the moral status of mountains- as emblems whether of sin, ruin, and</page><page sequence="6">448 isle ugliness, or of the highest aesthetic or spiritual values- but, having pitted capitalized and personified Gloom against the triumphant protagonist Glory, and having sorted history into that binary con- ceptual structure, Nicolson is not at all conscious of having herself written a rigid allegorical interpretation of the history of taste: wherein mountain into Gloom and Glory, battle it out for our hearts and minds. Nicolson's reading of Dante is instructive in this connection. Because her notion of allegory is limited to concept-allegory, the neo- classical practice that Coleridge all too successfully deprecated in The Statesman's Manual as mechanical "picture-language," she filters out the complexity of Dante's allegorical practice and reduces it anachro- nistically to a picture-language it never was (30). In Nicolson's reading, "mountain" equals "difficulty" for Dante, and that is the end of it. Medieval allegory, in her view, precludes "realism" and moreover closes the doors of perception for centuries afterwards: "Throughout the Middle Ages, indeed throughout the Renaissance, allegorization, abstraction, and personification so overshadow realism that the characteristic mountain imagery of the earlier seven- teenth century is little more than a series of conventional stereotypes" (50).4 Moreover, she becomes confused and contradictory whenever figuration of any sort (not just allegory) involves naturalistic descrip- tions that figure something intangible but more complex than a single abstract concept. Consider Nicolson's reading of the following passage from Purgatorio. Undermining the antagonism she perceives between "alle- gory" and "realism," Nicolson does credit Dante with a "realistic account" (48). Because Dante lived in the age of Gloom, Nicolson has no trouble imagining that Dante actually experienced, or believed someone could in principle experience, the following sort of distress on an actual mountain: Up through the riven rock we made our way; Cliffs hemmed us in on either side; the ground Beneath called feet and hands both into play . . . Surpassing sight, the summits pierce the sky . . . Forcing myself, I crawled up after him Until the ledge was underfoot at last. (Fletcher trans. 4.31-51; qtd. in Nicolson 48) She invites us to conclude from this moment of difficulty (her only quotation from Dante) that "nowhere [. . .] did Dante suggest the slightest aesthetic gratification in this or any other mountain ascent" (48). She quotes with approval John Ruskin's judgment that</page><page sequence="7">Most Beautiful and Adorn'd 449 mountains are repugnant to Dante, "always causes of rudeness or cruelty" (qtd. in Nicolson 48). Presumably, had the pilgrim experi- enced a moment of pleasure on a mountain, Nicolson would have challenged Ruskin's opinion about Dante's attitude toward mountains. The pilgrim does experience pleasure, in the very scene that Nicolson quotes without context and with undeserved deference to the authority of Ruskin. Between the Fletcher translation and Nicolson's elisions, we lose the information that Virgil is making the climb easier for the pilgrim by breaking it into steps and by encoura- gingly talking him through it, like father to son. The pilgrim is having a moment of difficulty; Virgil gets him through it. Here is the end of Nicolson's passage, but in W. S. Merwin's translation and without Nicolson's elision: "My son," he [Virgil] said, "haul yourself up that far," pointing to a ledge, a little higher, that ran round that whole side of the hill. His words had such power to spur me on that I made myself crawl up after him until I had the terrace under my feet. (4.46-51) The ongoing dialog, the camaraderie, and the pilgrim's well-founded confidence in his guide give the difficult climb a tone of safety and expected mastery. The tercets immediately following depict Virgil and the pilgrim resting on the terrace and looking back toward where they were: There both of us sat down, with our faces turned to the east, where we had come from, for often, facing that way, the heart rises. First I looked down to the shores below us and then up toward the sun, and I marveled to see it was on our left that it struck us. (4.52-57) This is a moment of pleasure and repose, wonder and curiosity; it is every bit as naturalistic and well-motivated as the climb itself. The pilgrim feels just the way we expect someone to feel after climbing onto a pleasant terrace with a wide prospect. But the whole episode of climb and repose is also allegorical. Not only does the allegory not detract from the naturalistic verisimilitude, it is the verisimili- tude with which the two men are rendered climbing, resting, and looking back that gives the allegory its persuasive vividness. This episode, like all the other episodes of ascent and repose on the Mount, establishes the distinctive pattern of mountain-imagery</page><page sequence="8">450 ISLE found in Purgatorio , the firm association between physical ascent and the decreasing physical difficulty that attends Virgil's good gui- dance. The realistic physical details of the climb attest to the pil- grim's increasing spiritual clarity and broader psychological and cultural prospect. The Christian pilgrim climbs; his heart rises; at the same time, he does not reject but lovingly assimilates the pagan literary past from his mentor. If we are justified in reading the climb as having to do with what it feels like to work through spiritual dif- ficulty-as Nicolson rightly observes- we must also pay attention to how the broad prospect from the terrace, and the wonder and curi- osity it inspires, is an equally vivid commentary on the pilgrim's growing consciousness and increasingly elevated mood. The figura- tive language reinforces the idea that as the pilgrim's spiritual vision clears, his physical work lightens and his heart opens. An earlier moment, in the Inferno, and a later one in Purgatorio, help make this larger pattern clearer. First recall that in Inferno Í, guide Virgil proposes ascending "the delectable mountain/ the source and cause of every happiness," a description much at odds with the pilgrim's initial distress when he finds himself stuck on a mountain (1.77-78). To the pilgrim, the idea "mountain" has just one simple emotive aspect: it is an obstacle. Then Virgil proposes that the right journey is just the opposite, that the mountain is "dilettoso," delect- able. What is Dante up to here? This initial analysis or splitting of the mountain image is typical of medieval visionary allegories in that, as Paul Piehler explains, we have a "preliminary description of the poet's disturbed mental state, within which occur metaphors or seminal images that develop into central features or themes of the main allegorical action, the vision itself" (146). In the Commedia, one of these seminal images is the mountain. The first allegorical analysis of the mountain bifurcates the image into a paradox: the difficult mountain is delectable. The paradox intimates that "mountain" enfolds all aspects of the problem, including the solution and the means of attaining it. The "mountain" thread of the poem's detailed allegorical develop- ment makes clear, often in strikingly naturalistic ways as in the passage above, just how this can be so. Dante's accomplishment, as Piehler has shown, is to have transformed the "ancient taboo of the holy mountain," the full complex of awe, dread, and what we might call Nicolsonian Glory, "into an allegory of spiritual life" (114).5 There is no reason at all to suppose that Dante's mountain somehow breaks either with the Old Testament tradition or with Greek tradition as transmitted to Dante by Christian Latin civiliza- tion. On the contrary, as Piehler explains,</page><page sequence="9">Most Beautiful and Adorn'd 451 [t]he dilettoso monte may be primarily associated with the Sinai of Exodus xix and with the montem domini [mountain of the Lord] of the twenty-third psalm.6 Behind these Biblical associations lies a whole body of feeling about the sacredness of mountains, some of which would be accessible to Dante through the fre- quent references to Zion as the holy hill of the Lord in both Old and New Testaments, and the pagan associ- ations of Olympus and Helicon. (115) The entire mount of Purgatory in all its particular detail, and the pil- grim's ascent through the various terraces, is of course crucial to Dante's analysis of such a complex visionary landscape. Running through its intricate particulars is a general trend that links the mount to the realization of Virgil's seminal metaphor, "dilettoso monte." In Purgatorio , the ascent becomes gradually easier as the pilgrim achieves enough clarity to experience the seemingly inaccessible delegability that Virgil was talking about in Inferno 1. We have already seen one station along the way and the pilgrim's heart con- tinues to flourish as he ascends. At the top of the mount, in the earthly paradise, an extended mountain simile likens the pilgrim's transforming heart to a thaw along the crest of the Apennines. Consider, first, the figurative vehicle of the simile: As the snow freezes among the living rafters, with the Slavonian wind blowing and packing it, along the spine of Italy, then, melted, drips into itself, if the land breathes as it loses its shadow, so that it seems like a fire melting a candle. (30.85-90)7 Note that the figurative vehicle itself contains another simile, likening the immense thaw to the small melting of a candle. The contrast between the mountains and the candle points the quiet immensity of the change that the pilgrim is describing by means of the extended figuration above. This is what is happening to him: the ice that had been clamped around my breast turned to breath and water, and came forth out of my breast through the eyes and mouth. (30.97-99) The analysis is as much physical as it is psychological, and it depends upon close observation of nature. The pilgrim experiences the delectable mountain here in an image from nature that mirrors</page><page sequence="10">452 isle his (certainly non-gloomy) heart. Dante's naturalistic figuration only works if the reader finds something awesome about how snow thaws on mountains. Such an image would never occur to a poet whose readers might think that the snow-capped Apennines are pustules defacing the spine of Italy. Dante's mountain thaw is just the sort of mind-reflecting nature we find in Nicolson's Glory era several centu- ries later in Romantic poets, who, like Dante, wrote poetry of the human mind. Roman Distaste Another approach, which Nicolson applies to Romans and Christians alike, is to imagine first that aesthetics before the eight- eenth century was nothing but the repetition of a uniform doctrine (from which the Greeks and the Hebrews must be curiously exempt if the claim of original Glory is to hold) and second, that this doctrine is inconsistent with a taste for rugged scenery, or even a taste for external nature at all. Her gloss on aesthetics rather insinuates than argues closely, as in this: Although the seventeenth-century poets recognized the beauty of nature- in the small if not yet in the large- they seldom paused to consider the nature of Beauty, and, when they defined beauty, did so in terms of con- ventions they had inherited. 'The worlds beauty is decai'd and gone,' Donne wrote in "The First Anniversary"- 'Beauty, that's color and proportion.' He was saying only what Augustine had said, paraphras- ing words of Cicero that were probably already a com- monplace when Cicero used them: 'Beauty is a proportion of the parts, together with a certain agree- ableness of color.' Bacon wrote essays "Of Deformity" and "Of Beauty" in which there was nothing original. He and others who wrote on these topics associated beauty with human beings, not with external nature. (69-70) The passage begins by acknowledging what the last sentence denies, that beauty is in one way or another associated with nature.8 An inconsistency such as this invites closer scrutiny of Nicolson's claims: (1) that a long and complex tradition of classical aesthetics can be reduced to a simple formula, and (2) that classical beauty is associ- ated only with human beings and certainly not with rugged scenery or high places.</page><page sequence="11">Most Beautiful and Adorn'd 453 Fortunately, Latin writers have much to say about the appearance of the natural world and about mountains in particular. The epigraph to this essay offers just one example, in which Quintilian makes as clear as he possibly could his appreciation of the "grandeur" and "dignity" of mountains and his disapproval of calling them- or parts of them- "warts." He specifically chooses mountains as his example of some- thing obviously and unquestionably magnificent. Before examining some other ancient Roman writing about mountains, I want to glance briefly at a bit of straightforward Roman evidence concerning the reli- gious or aesthetic response to mountains, namely what we can learn from geography and settlement patterns. The real-estate choices made by the most affluent and mobile ancients are especially telling. The several-thousand-year history of an actual Roman mountain, such as the Albanus mons, provides persuasive evidence that the Romans did not harbor a general "distaste" for mountains or "high places," and that the Romans, like the Greeks and Hebrews, had a sense of mountains as sacred places. The Albanus mons (Monte Cavo), rising to 950 meters (3,115 feet) fifteen kilometers southeast of Rome, was an active and sparsely populated volcano until its last eruption in about 1150 BCE. On the summit stood the Latin federal sanctuary of Jupiter Latiaris, where Roman consuls celebrated the feriae Latinae, a festival honoring Jupiter in his role as god of the Latin people. The temple has vanished but remains exist of the via Triumphalis leading up to the site where, as E. T. Salmon and D. W. R. Ridgway point out, "at least five Roman generals celebrated ovations after being refused regular triumphs in Rome" (50). An eastern section of the crater's outermost rim, called Algidus, was, according to Salmon and T. W. Potter, just as "famous for its temples of Diana and Fortune" as it was for "its fashionable villas" (63). The Algidus included as well the ancient city of Tusculum, the extensive remains of which "occupy a strong, bracing site 668 meters (2,198 feet) above sea level," near the modern city of Frascati. During the late republic and early empire, "Tusculum was a fashionable resort where wealthy Romans sojourned," notably Cicero, who wrote and studied at his villa there (Salmon and Potter 1565). A synoptic view of an ancient volcano like the Albanus mons, with its well-documented archeological and historical record, looks backward to the genuinely sacred mountains of its earliest inhabitants, and forward to a culti- vated Roman attraction to mountains as aesthetic building sites that are conducive both to recreation and philosophical reflection. If the leisure classes of eighteenth-century Britain experienced a spectrum of quasi-religious and aesthetic responses to mountain scenery, it was a taste they shared with the kind of sophisticated Roman Martial</page><page sequence="12">454 isle satirizes in Epigrams. The people who most enjoy villas, suggests Martial, are the servants permanently quartered there to keep an eye on the property; the owners are too busy in Rome. (bk. 10.30) "This Most Beautiful and Adorn'd World": John Ray and Cicero Cicero enters only obliquely or vaguely into Nicolson's history, as yet another Roman with nothing new to say about aesthetics and cer- tainly no words of praise for mountains. Her most interesting oblique reference is this: Nicolson instances John Ray's Wisdom of God (1691) as the model defense for mountains against Burnet's charge that mountains are the ruins of the Flood and emblems of man's iniquity (253). Ray argues that mountains are part of the original creation, but "Ray's mountain defense," according to Nicolson, was largely the old pragmatic and utilitarian argument. He took his point of departure from a classical passage in the second book of Cicero's De Natura Deorum, in which Cicero, opposing the atomic hypothesis, argued that 'this most beautiful and adorn'd World ' could not have been produced by a fortuitous concourse of atoms. (255; italics mine) Nicolson alludes to part of the old Stoic argument that Cicero gives Balbus in De Natura Deorum: that this beautiful world could not have come about by chance. Citing Balbus on the world's beauty under- mines her characterization of Balbus's argument as merely "prag- matic and utilitarian." The phrase quoted by Nicolson is at De natura deorum 2.93, where Cicero's Balbus illustrates his thesis that the beautiful world must be the purposeful artwork of a divine artificer. "At this point must I not marvel," says an exasperated Balbus, that there should be anyone who can persuade himself that there are certain solid and indivisible particles of matter borne along by the force of gravity, and that the fortuitous collision of those particles produces this elab- orate [( ornatissimum , literally "most adorned"] and beau- tiful [pulcherrimum, literally "most beautiful"] world. (212-13; bk. 2.93) As the Latin makes clear, John Ray's translation as "most beautiful and adorn'd world" is no seventeenth-century effusion. Ray faithfully renders the two superlatives that the modern Loeb translation above</page><page sequence="13">Most Beautiful and Adorn'd 455 flattens out into "elaborate and beautiful." But no single English word then or now captures the nuance of Cicero's "ornatissimum." Ornatus could mean "well-equipped, properly arrayed" or "richly adorned or embellished, magnificent, etc." A well-equipped army is ornatus ; a magnificent lake is ornatus (OLD, "ornatus" 1, 2). In English today, ornamented nearly always has the sense of something having been optionally applied. Ornaments are literally applied and removed (as military equipment can be supplied or not); they are never inherent attributes. Unlike the Romans, we cannot now say that a lake is ornamented, unless we have in mind that some struc- ture has been added to it.10 It is clear from the general tenor of the argument Cicero puts in the mouth of Balbus, as well as from the meanings of the very words he uses, that ideas of beauty and utility are not as neatly separated for him and for Romans as they will come to be in later European aesthetics. Cicero's superlative phrase " ornatissimum et pulcherrimum" foregrounds beauty and pleasure while at the same time introducing the idea that the world is well-equipped and properly arrayed, and Balbus needs these superlatives to register the increasing emotional pitch of his argument. His emotive diction prepares the way for the aesthetic argument to follow. He offers an illustrative sketch, of ancient vintage then, and still familiar as the tableau of infinitely many monkeys infinitely pounding away on typewriters and never producing Shakespeare. "I cannot understand," continues Cicero's Balbus, why he who considers it possible for this to have occurred should not also think that, if a countless number of copies of the one-and-twenty letters of the alphabet, made of gold or what you will, were thrown together into some receptacle and then shaken out on to the ground, it would be possible that they should produce the Annals of Ennius, all ready for the reader. I doubt whether chance could possibly succeed in produ- cing even a single verse! (212-13; bk. 2.93). In what follows, Balbus's rhetorical strategy for developing the full force of this argument is first to provide a descriptive catalogue of the beautiful world, a bill of particulars that places the world as he sees it securely before the inner eye of his interlocutors. "For we may now put aside elaborate argument," says Balbus, "and gaze as it were with our eyes upon the beauty [pulchritudinem] of the creations of divine providence" (219; bk. 2.98). Balbus praises beauty large and small: flowers, meadows, woods, animals tame and wild, stars and</page><page sequence="14">456 isle planets, the expanses of ocean and sky, and notably, the "deep vaulted caverns, craggy rocks, sheer mountain heights and plains of immeasurable extent" (218-33; bk. 2.98-115) (219; bk. 2.98). Sharp rock, sheer cliffs, measureless plains: these too are beautiful. Cicero would not have let Balbus include them if he doubted that his audi- ence, who represent the full spectrum of learned opinion as to the origin of the world, would consider them so. The world's manifold beauty, including the beauty of mountains, is one thing they can all agree on. The dispute is over how the world got that way. Having described the wonders of nature, Balbus can better per- suade his audience that such beautiful and well-formed objects must be the purposeful artwork of a divine artificer, that they could not have come about by chance, as the Epicureans argue. Having brought his audience this far, Balbus can then more confidently advance the utilitarian argument that the divine artificer must have made all this for man's use and enjoyment, for what else but man (the argument goes) is so well suited to appreciate such a manifestly beautiful and useful creation? When Wordsworth wrote in the Preface to the 1814 Excursion , "how exquisitely [...]- / Theme this but little heard of among men- / The external World is fitted to the Mind," he re-introduced a Stoic psychological notion that Cicero gave to Balbus (xii -xiii). The world's utility, in this view, entails experiencing its beauty. Contrary to the assertions of Nicolson, this is a traditional view that we find in the major literature of Christendom and Latin antiquity. Moreover, both Dante and Milton locate the earthly paradise on a mountain, something they would not have dared if their audiences thought mountains were ugly warts. John Ray's defense of mountains is in fact entirely consistent with Balbus's view of nature; mountains are both useful and beautiful. Ray, like Balbus, praises the beauty of the world. In reply to Burnet's contention that "the present earth looks like a Heap of Rubbish and Ruins" (qtd. in Nicolson 260), Ray writes, I answer, That the present face of the Earth, with all its Mountains and Hills, its Promontories and Rockes, so rude and deformed as they appear, seem to me a beau- tiful and pleasant Object, and with all that Variety of Hills, and Valleys, and Inequalities, far more grateful to behold, than a perfectly level Country without any Rising or Protuberancy to terminate the Sight, (qtd. in Nicolson 261) In another passage, Ray writes,</page><page sequence="15">Most Beautiful and Adorn'd 457 [Mountains] are very ornamental to the Earth, affording pleasant and delightful Prospects, both to them that look downwards from them upon the adjacent Countries . . . and to those that look upwards, and behold them from the Plains and low Grounds What a Refreshing and a Pleasure it is to the Eye. (qtd. in Nicolson 261) What is different about Ray's mountains is that Ray, unlike Balbus, feels he must defend mountains at all against charges of ugliness. It would never have occurred to Cicero to defend the beauty of moun- tains; he takes it for granted when he reminds his audience of the world's beauty by offering a comprehensive catalogue in which mountains have their place. Mountain Gloom is located not in Rome but in a seventeenth-century British discourse. This seventeenth-century quarrel between geology and theology may not in fact be a reliable index of more popular British taste. Recall that even Burnet was ambivalent: he thought mountains were a Heap of Rubbish and Ruins, but he was attracted to them all the same. Ray claims that the public is in fact widely attracted to moun- tains, and he brings into play the evidence of visual art. "That the Mountains are pleasant Objects to behold," he writes, "appears in that the very Images of them, their Draughts and Landskips, are so much esteem'd" (qtd. in Nicolson 261). Ray finds this taste in pictures quite telling. It clinches his argument. We, too, should be persuaded that, if the public really thought mountains were ugly, there would be no market for pictures of them during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when reproductions of pic- tures were becoming commercially available. Landscape may have been considered a minor or trivial genre, but I know of no the- oretician who argues against visually depicting mountains because they are ugly.11 A strong Palladian strain in neo-classic British aesthetics, however, does argue for the beautiful as the smooth and elegant. Nicolson rightly points out that such a notion underpins the ambivalent aes- thetic status of mountains for theorists such as Burnet. But already in 1690, Erasmus Warren's Geologia , another work discussed by Nicolson, suggests that this standard is not applicable to the aes- thetics of nature. Consider how Warren's metaphors of embossing and fret-work imply that such a strict canon of the smooth and elegant is not even applicable to the arts. The earth, he writes, does not have that smoothness and entireness, which is pretended to have been in the first Earth. But then</page><page sequence="16">458 isle (which is more considerable): it has the raised Work, of Hills; the Embossings, of Mountains; the Enamellings, of lesser Seas; the Open-Work, of vast Oceans; and the Fret- Work of Rocks, (qtd. in Nicolson 265) As Nicolson points out, "Warren's was a God of Beauty," and therefore "any attack on the beauty of Nature was an attack on God" (264). Warren's and Ray's pleas on behalf of the world's divine artificer and his beautiful artwork are ancient pagan arguments that were embraced and carried forward by Roman intellectuals and Christians alike. What gave the rhetoric of Ray and Warren its urgency in seventeenth-century Britain was not that they were formulating a revolutionary aesthetics of nature; rather, they had to reassert a most conservative aesthetic against a radical theological attack on traditional ideas about the manifold beauty and fitness of the world. "A Certain Divine Joy and Shuddering": Lucretian Sublimity To Nicolson's credit, she often strays from her absolute thesis into a more nuanced evaluation of Roman intellectuals who wrote about the natural world. She herself now and again admits a ray of Mountain Glory into the era of Gloom, as in this sincere appreciation of Lucretius: Lucretius alone among major Latin poets seemed to feel sublimity in wild scenery, though, ironically enough, as a philosopher he insisted that mountains were the waste places of the world. Yet Lucretius made more than one ascent to see a prospect from a summit; he described clouds as they floated above mountains; he exulted in the violence of thunderstorms. Mountains and storms, volcanoes and earthquakes- no matter how Lucretius the philosopher explained their origin, Lucretius the poet experienced some of the 'rapture' of the eighteenth-century poets, many of whom prided themselves upon being 'anti-Lucretians'. (40) The fact that some eighteenth-century poets, while sharing the Lucretian rapture, rejected Lucretianism is one irony that can easily be disposed of, for what was at stake in this eighteenth-century ambiva- lence about Lucretius had not much to do with the aesthetics of nature. It was the same "intelligent design" issue that had engaged the Stoics in their assault on Lucretius and his Epicurean tradition and that con- tinues to provoke controversy today. Lucretius held that everything in</page><page sequence="17">Most Beautiful and Adorn'd 459 this amazing world comes into being and passes away through the recombination of atoms, but without design. The Stoic position (as expressed, for example, by Balbus above) held that such a well-formed creation must be the purposeful artifact of a divine artificer. The second irony Nicolson detects (without citing Lucretius) is that Lucretius loved mountains but considered them waste places. There is no such irony in Lucretius's account of the creation. During the "flowering newness of the world," "novitas [. . .] florida mundi," early man was called by the sound of moving water, writes Lucretius, "as now the rushing of water down from the great moun- tains [montibus e magnis] calls loud and far to the thirsting tribes of beasts" (my trans. 5.943; Rouse and Smith trans. 5.946-47). In this state of nature, man was guided by helpful Nymphs "whence they knew that some running rivulet issued rippling over the wet rocks in abundant flow and dripping upon the green moss, and in parts welling up and bubbling out over the level plain" (5.949-95). Lucretius's enthusiastic appraisal of the flowering newness of the world, where great mountains and level plains alike are integral with animal pleasure and well-being, is at odds with mountains as "waste places." Without a specific Lucretian mountain landscape from Nicolson, I have just chosen one of my own. I would like to propose an example that suggests that the irony or inconsistency Nicolson reads into Lucretius's attitude toward mountains may be an artifact of English translation. The modern English adjective waste is a convenient but sometimes disastrously inaccurate translation for Latin vastus. Latin writers use vastus in describing the earth and the cosmos; it has many possible shades of meaning that produce problems for translators in precisely the kinds of aesthetic contexts we are considering. Latin vastus produced two English words with different meanings and connotations, waste and vast; but the Latin adjective can have yet another meaning, absent from modern, negative waste in the sense Nicolson uses the word, but still at least faintly evoked by English vast : "Awe-inspiring by reason of size, force, etc." (OLD "vastus" 3). The Romans called vastus such awe-inspiring forces as wild animals, volcanoes, oceans and the like, just the sort of phenomena that the eighteenth century called sublime. Edmund Burke himself appeals to the authority of Lucretius to support his theory of the sublime: Lucretius is a poet not to be suspected of giving way to superstitious terrors; yet when he supposes the whole mechanism of nature laid open by the master of his</page><page sequence="18">460 ISLE philosophy, his transport on this magnificent view which he has represented in the colours of such bold and lively poetry, is overcast with a shade of secret dread and horror. (63; pt. 2.5) Burke refers to a passage in which Lucretius credits Epicurus with "illumining the blessings of life" (3.2); "the walls of the world open out, I see action going on throughout the whole void" (3.16-17). Lucretius feels at once a sense of "horror" and "voluptas": "a sort of divine delight [divina voluptas] gets hold upon me and a shuddering [horror], because nature thus by your power has been so manifestly laid open and uncovered in every part" (3.28-30).12 In addition to experiencing an emotion that the distinguished eighteenth-century aesthetician did in fact label sublime, Lucretius apprehends sublimities that are, if anything, more complicated than the eighteenth-century version.13 Lucretius is struck by the union of complementary immensities, the immensely small and the immen- sely large: the awesome vastness and variety of the phenomenal world laid open to view by the atomic theory of Epicurus. Lucretius not only understands the "aesthetics of the infinite" that Nicolson locates as an eighteenth-century development but also anticipates a twentieth-century aesthetic response to the world as revealed by modern physics. Of course Lucretius has no tools for directly investigating atomic theory. What he is able to observe directly and describe with great clarity is just what interests us most in investigating Nicolson's two related charges that the Romans had no aesthetics of the infinite and no aesthetic appreciation of mountains. For this reason, I would like to examine a particularly sublime and rugged Lucretian landscape that is relevant to Nicolson's argu- ment in several ways. First, it contains the problematic word vastus. Second, it describes one kind of amazing place that is recognizable as a topos in later European poetry and painting. Third, the rhetoric involves describing an actual geographical place, not an imaginary landscape, and then deploying it as a figure of comparison in a context that leaves no doubt as to his attitude toward the landscape. Lucretius begins by describing the rugged wonders of Sicily. Having put Sicily before the eyes of the reader, he can compare it to someone he obviously admires, Empédocles, Sicily's favorite son. Because Lucretius admires Empédocles, we have no doubt that he admires the landscape as well. Empédocles, Lucretius tells us, was born on</page><page sequence="19">Most Beautiful and Adorn'd 461 that island, around which the Ionian deep, flowing with its vast windings, sprinkles the salt brine from its green waves, and the swift-moving sea in its narrow strait divides with its waves the shores of the Aolian land from the boundaries of that isle. Here is wasteful [vasta] Charybdis, and here Etna's rumblings threaten that the angry flames are gathering again, that once more its violence may belch fires bursting forth from its throat, and once more shoot to the sky the lightnings of its flame: which mighty region, while it seems won- derful [miranda] in many ways to the nations of mankind and is famed as a place to see, fat with good things, fortified with a mighty store of men, yet it seems to have contained in it nothing more illustrious than this man, nor more sacred and wonderful and dear. (1.717-30) Lucretius calls Charybdis "vasta," which the translator renders as "wasteful," a meaning not attested in the OLD. But since we know that Charybdis is a whirlpool, perhaps we can recover the difficulty the translator faced in finding a plausible English adjective. The whirlpool is neither vast, in the sense of huge, nor waste in the sense of either desolate or ruined; the whirlpool does, however, waste or destroy sailors, whence the translator's poetic license in translating vasta as "wasteful. The broader context, however, supports the more straightforward and well-attested idea that this turbulent spot is awe-inspiring by reason of force rather than size, and that Lucretius has a positive aesthetic response to this force.14 The whirlpool is a feature in a landscape that Lucretius calls "marvelous [miranda]," "a place that must be seen [regio visendaque]" (my trans. 1.726-27). Miranda communicates both wonder and admiration. (Incidentally, Lucretius also alludes to the place as a tourist attraction.) He describes the Sicilian landscape in just this way so that he can use the description figuratively in vivid praise for an awe-inspiring intellectual ancestor. Nothing in this amazing place is, Lucretius tells us, "more sacred and more wonderful and dear [sanctum magis et mirum carumque ]" (1.730) than her favorite son. The three adjectives recapitulate, as so often happens in Lucretius, the combined sense of what Jenkyns calls "gran- deur and homeliness" that marks Lucretius's sensibility (236). Empédocles, the magnificent philosopher-hero, is carus 'dear,' like magnificent Sicily, which is not only powerfully awesome but also just simply "fat with good things," agriculturally lush and abundant.</page><page sequence="20">462 isle The idea that fat, fertile, and amazing Sicily produced the great man as her own physical child is clearer in Latin than in the Loeb translation. Consider this more literal rendering: The island bore [gessit] him within the triangular coasts of its earth, around which the Ionian sea, flowing through great winding coasts [magnis anfractibus ], splashes salt from its blue-green waves. (My trans. 1.717-19) The island actively bearing the man (gesso is the normal verb for human gestation) is the subject of the sentence, and she accomplishes her procreative work within a triangular earth-form that further delineates the image of a womb. In this sentence, Lucretius's figure renews the metaphoric sense of the ordinary Latin idiom for "indi- genous," terra ortus , literally "sprung from the earth." Accordingly, great personages are often figured by great mountains in classical lit- erature. Such figurations are aided by the fact that the several parts of a mountain are anthropomorphically named, from its head to its feet, in Latin more so than in English, though we do have "foothills" and "piedmont." In these ancient mountain figurations, the sense of a sacred mountain or mountain god has become domesticated as a figure of speech applied to the most august personages, an example of the partial but incomplete de-sacralization of landscape.15 Lucretius delights in the rugged, resilient exterior of this protective space, the " magnis anfractibus ," which has almost enough sound effect to require no translation. Anfractus (am[bi] + fractus) refers to something "broken around." Here in the plural, it refers to the many windings of the coast, no smooth surface, and Lucretius obviously admires it. The ruggedness of the coast is evidenced by the descrip- tion of how the sea engages the island. The sea here is aaec¡uor," a word for the sea that emphasizes its calm aspect, and it is "fluitans," flowing as it splashes [aspar git'. The landscape has elements that some eighteenth-century aestheticians might try to sort out into beau- tiful or sublime or picturesque, but for Lucretius, the world with its walls let down is all of one piece and miranda. Richard Jenkyns has written extensively on how Lucretius's De Rerum Natura transformed the place of nature in poetry and made the epic landscapes of Virgil possible (59). Since Virgil is by far the most consistently read poet throughout the centuries of European Mountain Gloom, whether of the classical, medieval, or later var- ieties, one would expect a study such as Nicolson's to have examined Virgil's mountains. But Nicolson manages to avoid Virgil by dispos- ing of him in two ways. First, she notices that he is merely a source of</page><page sequence="21">Most Beautiful and Adorn'd 463 "classical reminiscences" that preclude authentic perception and orig- inal creation (60), an observation rather like the old joke about Shakespeare: nothing but clichés! Deciding whether or not reminis- cences of Virgil preclude authenticity (a difficult enough question) does not address the question of whether or not the Roman source of these reminiscences tells us something about Roman cultural atti- tudes. Second, Nicolson writes that "Virgil never really praised mountains, which he knew well enough" (40). Deciding whether Virgil really praises mountains or not does not address the question of what Virgilian mountains are like, or how they do figure in his poetry, or what if anything we can conclude about Roman feeling for mountains by reading such poetry. Virgil's mountains cannot in fact be slotted into one aesthetic cat- egory; he deploys them figuratively to achieve various subtle effects. A pair of examples, each from an emotional speech, briefly illustrates that "mountain" is, for Virgil, no simple code for gloom or glory or some other emotion. On the one hand, Dido's enraged speech against Aeneas accuses him of being so cold-hearted that he must have been nursed by a tigress on a cliff: Liar and cheat! Some rough Caucasian cliff [horrens Caucasus] Begot you on flint [duris cautibus]. Hyrcanian tigresses Tendered their teats to you. (Fitzgerald trans. 4.505-07) But another kind of animal on a cliff is deployed to opposite effect when a craggy cliff with goats receives a tender farewell: "Not I here- after, stretched full length in some green cave, /Shall watch you far off hanging on a thorny crag [dumosa rupe]" (Guy Lee trans. 1.75-76). The crag is " dumosa " or "overgrown with thorn, briar, or similar bushes," but nobody would say that this thorny crag is presented as anything but attractive (OLD, "dumosus"). Its overgrown vegetation nourishes the goats, and the speaker is sad that he will no longer be looking at it. Neither of these passages really praises or blames moun- tains as such; the rough landscapes are contextualized by the animals and by the emotions of the speakers, and vice versa. Setting and emotion flow back and forth, mutually informing each other. For such figurations to work at all, Virgil has to depend on the reader bringing to the text a flexible (but not indeterminate) set of feelings and beliefs about actual mountains (whether acquired through direct experience or mediated through art) that can reliably be evoked by providing particular contexts that define and shade particular emotive meanings. Virgil counts on a negative valuation of the distant, desolate Caucasus, home to fierce beasts, and a positive valuation of the rugged Italian cliffs, home to domestic animals. In</page><page sequence="22">464 isle each case, the combination of emotive geo-politics (places foreign or domestic, under civilized control or not) and emotive animals (wild or domestic) is crucial in depicting the sort of emotive mountain landscape we are to imagine as amplifying the speaker's particular sentiments. Virgil's sheltered and menacing cliffs, Lucretius's dear and awesome Sicily, Dante's "delectable mountain," Cicero's "most beau- tiful and adorned world," Quintilian's rebuke to the forgotten author of the "rocky wart" insult- and, at a more mundane level, the settle- ment patterns of Romans who were free to move where they liked and look at what they wanted to see- all show that the distinction between "gloom" and "glory," though useful as a heuristic device for an enterprise such as Nicolson's, will not stand up to serious scrutiny as a history of taste, perception, or landscape consciousness. The interplay between what is attractive about rugged landscapes and what is distressing about them plays a significant role in literal and figurative descriptions of mountains at all periods of European litera- ture, and there is no point at which we can say with confidence that either Gloom or Glory has definitively effaced the other. Certainly one can understand the rhetorical need that prompted Nicolson to compose her mythic tale of a disastrous fall from Glory to Gloom, fol- lowed by a triumphant and redemptive return to Glory, and one can appreciate the value this tale has had as a simple framework on which to pin a complex set of facts. But the facts ultimately will not allow so simple a framework to stand. Establishing the proper histori- cal context for British Romantic landscape perception requires a genuine engagement with classical and medieval texts and an acknowledgment that, in those texts, the environment and its human inhabitants interact with a powerful emotional intensity that cannot be reduced to a few simple terms. Once such a corrected historical record is established, the genuine contribution of Nicolson's path- breaking book can be properly recognized and gratefully applauded. Nicolson's enduring service was to provide literary scholars with an essential interdisciplinary tool when she revealed, with boldness and originality, the turbulent crosscurrents among theology, humane letters, and scientific speculation about the natural world at a seminal moment in British intellectual history.16 Notes 1. Cf. Francis G. Townsend, who finds it "curious" that Nicolson's case rests so strongly "on the sensibility of one man, Thomas Burnet" and asks</page><page sequence="23">Most Beautiful and Adorn'd 465 why Burnet felt as he did and was able to propagate this feeling in others. Townsend nevertheless accepts Nicolson's basic account of the historical facts (401). 2. See Abrams 98-101, Hitt 128-29, and Henighan 36-37. For a favorable response to Nicolson that has reservations about the contradictory evidence from visual art, as well as reservations about Nicolson's aesthetic concepts and terminology, see Hagstrum 48-51. Although Derek Roper objects to certain other quotations out of context from Luther, Evelyn, Hobbes, Howell, and Marvel, he accepts Nicolson's general view that the perception of moun- tains did change "spectacularly" and that "before the Renaissance mountains had been symbols of pride, reminders of the Fall, at best inconveniences" (90-91). 3. For historical surveys and bibliographies, see Halliwell; Panofsky. 4. For nuanced discussions of medieval allegory, see Piehler; Rollinson; Russell. 5. Contrast, for example, the Mount of Purgatory with the Inferno' s Old Man of Crete, a mountain emblematic of human sin and sorrow, composed of materials that devolve from gold to clay. Mount Purgatory redeems the earlier mountain image. 6. The reference is to the Psalm numbered 23 in the Vulgate version, 24 in English versions. Cf. Isaiah 30.29, where the Lord's mountain is explicitly connected to laetitia cordis , "gladness of heart." 7. As Charles Singleton explains in his Commentary to Purgatorio , the "living rafters," "le vive travi" are the forest, and the rafter metaphor is "common in the Latin poets" (748). Cf. Ovid at Metamorphoses 8.329: "Silva frequens trabibus." Dante's "living rafters" conveys a primordial sense of the earth's living integrity. Anything rising up out of it is alive, and to cut some- thing away (e.g. quarry stone or fell trees) for building material is to confer a kind of death or injury. The general notion that having to build and make things is somehow transgressive or fallen informs both pagan and Judaeo-Christian accounts of the creation and devolution of man from a state of nature. 8. There are two points to be made about this paragraph: (1) "The First Anniversary" is an elegy upon the death of a fifteen-year-old girl. Mutilation (of the deceased, the mourners, and/or the world) is an emotive elegaic topic, not an aesthetic or theological proposition about people or nature. See Race (86-117). A discussion of Augustinián aesthetics would have to ask just what the properties perceptible to the senses, such as color and proportion, have to do with notions such as: "Late have I loved you, beauty so old and so new: late I have loved you. And see, you were within" ( Confessions 201; bk.10.27). 9. Readers conditioned to the Alps or Mt. Everest might be tempted to dismiss Albanus as a mere molehill. It is well to remember that the principle peaks of Britain's Lake District- sites of Mountain Glory- are under 1,000 meters in elevation. 10. One can get a feeling for an ornament as non-detachable by consider- ing another English word with a similar meaning and history, decorated , from</page><page sequence="24">466 isle Latin decorus, which can mean "glorious honorable, noble" (OLD, sense 3). One specialized English usage retains this old Latin nuance. When a man appears in civilian clothes and we say that he is a decorated war veteran, we mean that he is an honored hero and not that he is literally wearing the color- ful ribbons that are the tokens of his honor. Whether the "decorations" are packed away or not, a man, unlike a Christmas tree, remains "decorated, decorus/' 11. Ray's remark suggests how Britain's rapidly changing visual culture, brought about by the availability of landscape prints, was aiding and abet- ting the theological debate on the side of mountains and landscape generally. Prints were at least as important, perhaps far more important, to British land- scape consciousness than the Burnet controversy. 12. Lines 28-30 in the original Latin: "his ibi me rebus quaedam divina voluptas/percipit atque horror, quod sic natura tua vi/ tam manifesta patens ex omni parte retecta est." Burke slightly misquotes the passage as follows: "His tibi me rebus quaedam Divina voluptas/Percipit, adque horror, quod sic Natura tua vi/Tam manifesta patet ex omni parte retecta." 13. Richard Jenkyns points out that Lucretius's religious sense has nothing to do with traditional or sentimental Roman religious rites and prac- tices (240). Lucretius writes, "It is no piety to show oneself often with covered head, turning towards a stone and approaching every altar, none to fall prostrate upon the ground and to spread open the palms before shrines of gods, none to sprinkle altars with the blood of beasts in showers and to link vow to vow; but rather to be able to survey all things with tranquil mind" (5.1198-1203). This quietistic disregard for institutions made Lucretius controversial among some Christians. 14. Compare Wordsworth's letter to Dorothy upon crossing the Simplón: "Among the more awful scenes of the Alps . . . my whole soul was turned to him who produced the terrible majesty before me" (Letters: The Early Years 34; qtd. in Abrams 496, n. 60). We know for a fact that Wordsworth's use of the words "awful" and "terrible" did not imply negative valuations. Awful did not acquire the meaning "ugly or monstrous" until 1834 (OED, "awful" 4). 15. For the least sacred end of the spectrum, see Ovid's sophisticated depiction of Mt. Atlas (Metamorphoses 4.632). Longinus, like Lucretius, shows a strong sense of the "natural sublime" when he likens the rhetoric of mighty Demosthenes to a mountain (On the Sublime 34.4). Dante draws on this anthropomorphic tradition for his Old Man of Crete (Inferno 14). 16. I am grateful to Karl Kroeber and Paul Piehler for their valuable advice on improving this essay.
