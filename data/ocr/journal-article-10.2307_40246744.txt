<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nothing: Reading Paul Celan's "Engfuhrung" ARIS FIORETOS "How can one write nothing?," Jacques Derrida asked in a book-length essay some years ago, devoted to the poetry of Paul Celan. l The question, posed more than answered by Derrida, addresses a central complication and opens a field of inquiry that Celan scholarship has avoided to a certain degree. Instead of reading Celan, critics tend to domesticate his work by introducing categories such as "the Hôlderlinian tradition," "her- meticism," or "poetry after Auschwitz." These categories are as necessary as legitimate; nonetheless they tend to neutralize what is essentially other, resisting hermeneutic elucidation. Thus one too often writes literary his- tory, not taking into account that the history of literature is always the history of an understanding whose possibility remains unscrutinized.2 Al- though more sophisticated attempts at interpreting Celans's poetry substi- tute this positivistic optimism with linguistic descriptions or thematic accounts, only rarely is it pointed out that Celan's poems have already themselves problematized their own readability. In its desire to render the poetic text comprehensible - and this comprehensibility is in the final analysis supposed to be achievable - Celan exegesis neglects the her- meneutic resistance that his poetry articulates. This essay is the winner of the second annual A. Owen Aldridge Prize in Comparative Literature (1989), presented to a graduate student currently enrolled in a Comparative Literature program in the United States, and selected by Comparative Literature Studies in conjunction with The American Comparative Literature Association.

They confront language with its own unreliability in a rigor- ous attempt to write that which lacks comparison. The poems are "at once open and hermetic," as Celan himself remarks in a letter referring to Osip Mandelstam's writing.3 This open hermeticism, or hermetic openness, may serve as passable prolegomenon to a poem like "Engfuhrung" (197- 204). The text can be taken to be a reading of its euphonically more naive precursor, "Todesfuge" (41-42), with which it shares its fugal composi- tion. Yet "Engfuhrung" reinscribes a set of deeply troubling problems in a manner that obliquely undoes whatever uncomplicated, albeit coolly des- perate, faith in the salvaging power of naming is still prevalent in the former text. Both poems are concerned with the Holocaust, but whereas "Todesfuge" still partakes in a tradition whose poetic assumptions are essentially Schillerian, "Engfuhrung" must be read as an austere critique of the aestheticizing ideology permeating this tradition of eloquent immedi- acy. In contrast to "Todesfuge," it chooses a language which is essentially at odds with a tradition that partly, perhaps distortedly, had informed the tongue of the masters of death. In some sense, then, "Engfuhrung" chooses the language of the deprivation of language, trying to circum- scribe the incomparable event of the Holocaust. I will restrict my discus- sion to one marker of punctuation in this poem of some eight to ten pages - which is nothing, one might be compelled to think, and rightly so, though in this particular case it does make a difference. In passing, I will also make some shorthand reflections concerning a certain chiasmus, already encountered in the crossing of openness and veiling, hiddenness and exposure, touched upon by Celan in the letter quoted above. The chiasmus will demonstrate the precarious way in which Celan tries to ground his poetry, and the marker of punctuation will indicate how he tries to write that nothing which for him lacks comparison. * * * As a technical term, the Engfuhrung, or "stretto" in English, refers to a device employed in the composition of fugues. An artifice by which theme and figures are made to overlap, it gives "a direction," in the definition proposed by the Oxford English Dictionary, "to perform a pas- sage, esp. a final passage, in quicker time" (1117). The definition, by underscoring the elliptic way in which the poem is written, also under- lines, as Renate Bôschenstein-Schâfer has pointed out, a certain "passage</page><page sequence="3">160 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES from content to structure" ("Traum and Sprache," 226 [emphasis in origi- nal]). Derrida touches upon this feature of "Engfuhrung" in referring to "the rhythm of its own caesuras" (84). Of special interest in our context is the marking of these "caesuras," but it may be worth noting that the shorthand character of "Engfuhrung" is already from the outset brought close to the etymological meaning of steno-graphy - the German particle eng, as in the title "Eng-fuhrung," corresponding to the Greek word for "narrow" or "strict," sténos. Relying on the fugal composition of "Engfuhrung," where the semantic weight of the poem is less crucial than the pattern of its syntactic texture, Peter Szondi remarks in what remains perhaps the most vigilant reading of Celan's text: "the reading subject coincides with the subject of the poem that is read" (388). In an ostensibly more familiar phrasing, one could say that Celan's poem is a stenographic allegory of reading. But such a charac- terization, whose reiteration only reinforces the constitutive aberrancy of its familiarity, nevertheless lacks precision if it is not accompanied by a memento; it seems to be a question in Celan of terrible reading. Aware of the catastrophic tonality of "Engfuhrung," Szondi develops the idea that what the poem unfolds "is the terrain of death and mourning" (389). According to another critic, Stéphane Moses, the place depicted in Celan's poem is one which his poetry "raises to the order of an allegory of absolute terror" (54). This allegorical feature of much of Celan's writing, which has attracted surprisingly little attention,4 has essentially to do with an act of remembering the other and the difficulty of interiorizing, but also articulating, an irretrievable absence. Nothing remains. The wound that this loss reveals - of which Celan's colleague Nelly Sachs in one of her late poems said it must be made "readable" (37) - is inscribed in Celan's poetry as the trace of a violence it does not cease to meditate upon. The stenographic character of "Engfuhrung," in which the issue of temporality is of pertinent importance, may be approached through the third stanza of the poem. With reference to a sleep which "came over them," it is said there: Kam, kam. Nirgends fragt es - Ich bins, ich, ich lag zwischen euch, ich war</page><page sequence="4">CELAN'S "ENGFÛHRUNG" 161 offen, war hôrbar, ich tickte euch zu, euer Atem gehorchte, ich bin es noch immer, ihr schlaftja. (198) Time is here phenomenalized through anthropomorphism, ich tickte euch zu. As Szondi remarks, the verb ticken signifies both "to tick" and "to touch with fingers."5 That which ticks and touches, he concludes, is "at the same moment the emblem of time," the clock, and "time itself, temporality" (358). The anthropomorphized temporality - given hands, as it were, to indicate itself, and phenomenalized in audible ticking - puts an invisible equal sign between life and listening. The figurai affirmation of the trope thus allows for an exchange of attributes, perforating not only the boundaries that separate innate substance from a limitless movement devoid of materiality, but also piercing the bar that keeps apart sound, which is always prey to disappearance, from mute durability. Temporality becomes "listenable," ich war . . . hôrbar, ich tickte euch zuy and this lis- tenability refers to an act of touching. Szondi interprets the listenability of time as life approaching those who are deprived of hearing, the deaf ones, the lost souls, enveloped in a diminutive death: sleep. An opposition is thus set up - between life and death, speech and muteness, openness and closure - whose implications can best be pursued in the paratactic compo- sition of the poem. "Engfuhrung" consists of nine stanzas, developing a "contrapuntal bringing-together of themes."6 Szondi distinguishes a pattern, modelled on the formula 4+1+4, where the first five stanzas are governed by a temporal succession from present to past, and the last five stanzas reverse this succession, going from past to present (Szondi 399-400). The for- mula, in other words, allows the middle section to be part of both tempo- ral movements, from present to past to present.7 The passage immediately preceding this middle stanza, which Szondi variously nominates as being in "the focus of the composition" and its "central part" (393), is therefore of particular interest, since it is literally the turning point of the text. The fourth and fifth stanzas read: Bin es noch immer - Jahre.</page><page sequence="5">162 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Jahre, Jahre, ein Finger tastet hinab und hinan, tastet umher: Nahtstellen, fùhlbar, hier klafït es weit auseinander, hier wuchs es wieder zusammen - wer deckte es zu? Deckte es zu - wer? Kam, kam. Kam ein Wort, kam, kam durch die Nacht, wollt leuchten, wollt leuchten. Asche. Asche, Asche. Nacht. Nacht'und'Nacht. - Zum Aug geh, zum feuchten. (199) What was previously put in the mode of subjectivity, Ich bins . . . ich tickte euch zu, has now been turned into a category of calculable time, Jahre. This measure of time, three times repeated, is then paratactically extended to ein Finger. The subjectivity which was one of pure and phe- nomenalized motion in the earlier section, ich tickte euch ?u, has now frozen into semantic concretion at the expense of fluid temporality, ein Finger I tastet. The description of the moving finger - a handy synecdoche for time, as it were - is then further transformed. The two subsequent lines end with hier-hier, turning the figure of the finger into a deictic, or pointing, gesture - which is the very means by which language turns itself into something that is taking place and can be referred to.8 In "Eng- fùhrung," this act of reference has to do with Nahtstellen. These "seams" are the stitches by which the sensuous, or "palpable," and the abyssal are tied together, "here." It is a wound at once open and sewn together. Not wanting to ask about the meaning of this - one recalls Szondi's distinction between function and meaning, corresponding to the one he makes be- tween reading and interpretation9 - Szondi expresses the discreet wish to</page><page sequence="6">CELAN'S "ENGFUHRUNG" 163 read what thereafter occurs as an inversion between the two stanzas of the poem: wer I deckte es zu? II * II Deckte es I zu* wer? He reads it as an "abyss" and a "rupture" (400). It must also be noted, however, that the inversion of syntagms in this abyssal passage, "here," performs a chiasmus. The poem asks "who covered it up?," a question inverted in the subsequent stanza of the text: "Covered it / up - who?" But it does not say what is covered up. As speech acts, the anguished questions of the poem are thus enacted unknowingly. They are non-constat ive. Yet in their expressed unknowing, they disclose something as still veiled and left unsaid, with- drawn from what is pronouncable. Since a question performs its essential lack of constativity in the act of enunciation, it opens up to its inner abyss; it finds its ground in groundless- ness. It may therefore be of value to recall that "chiasmus" is indeed a word without root in any meaning. Derived from the Greek - and ulti- mately Phoenician - letter chi, it describes a cross-shaped arrangement. Because its root is a letter and not a word, the figure lacks a grounding in semantics. It acquires significance only in performing, as a figure. Celan's chiasmus performs such a tropological movement over an abyss that can- not be filled with meaning. This abyss gapes wide open, grows together again, but lacks the meaningful ground which could answer the chias- tically arranged questions. Open though not accessible, veiled and yet not sealed, this is the "abyss" out of which Celan's poem speaks. 10 * * • Whereas a poem such as "Todesfuge" retreats to surrealistic symbolism, juxtaposing the goldenly blond Margarethe and Sulamith with her ashen hair, "Engfuhrung" is the renunciation of the naming of that which can- not be named, the denial to utter that which refuses pronounceability. Szondi realizes this crux involved in reading the late Celan, yet something seems to get lost in his reading. Strictly speaking, nothing gets lost. Com- ing to the end of the argument, it may also be appropriate to come to the point - what Klaus Voswinckel touches upon when he writes that "in such a manner of elocution, the extinction of the starlike word turns into an immediately shattering occurrence" (101). It is crucial to stress this turn into a directly disruptive transition, executed through the annihila- tion of a "starlike word."11 What occurs in "Engfuhrung" - at its turning point - is a trope, a chiasmus, through which the movement of the text is</page><page sequence="7">164 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES literally reversed. No "starlike word" is uttered at the heart of this inver- sion, but a sign does occur: an asterisk. This graphic marker, used nine times, silently punctuates the elliptic course of "Engfuhrung. " Between every section of the text, in the very passages from one stanza to another, Celan has posited asterisks. Asterisks, needless to say, are also stars. They hardly can be said to carry any meaning, devoid as they are of all semantic ambition, but they do serve a function. Compositionally they make a difference, giving the text "the rhythm of its own caesuras." They "write apart," as the poem itself puts it when twice referring to grass that is ausein* andergeschrieben (197; 204). The asterisks occur in between, however, in the chasm separating the stanzas. It is not all surprising, then, that Szondi's reading passes over these graphic markers. After all, alphabetically speaking, they are noth- ing. They cannot be uttered in any form other than the refusal to utter, in silence, as something that goes without saying. Es stand auch geschrieben, daji} the poem has it rather abruptly in the sixth stanza. By means of an anacolouthon, breaking off at a point where nothing indeed can be stated, it questions itself and continues in an instructively interrogative mode: Wo? Wir I taten ein Schweigen dariiber (200). The answer to Wo?f "Where?," cannot be given other than through silence, a silence which nonetheless will veil precisely nothing in terms of speech acts. This noth- ing cannot be articulated, yet it is not identical with the silence that veils it. The asterisks mark a positional act, but what they posit is essentially negative, a loss of language. They function as the material inscription of this unspeakability, bereft of the semantic dignity that somehow always goes along with speech. In the penultimate stanza of the poem, it is said: Also stehen noch Tempel. Ein Stern hat wohl noch Licht. Nichts, nichts ist verloren. (204) Relying on the initial Also, Szondi reads these lines as the "lesson" of "Engfuhrung" (416). Something remains. Nothing is lost. Nothing, but nothing. The first, solitary Nichts posits the lack which the second nichts</page><page sequence="8">CELAN'S "ENGFÛHRUNG" 165 assures us is not lost. Read together with the previous daruber, as well as the zudecken of the chiastically arranged questions quoted earlier, one begins to sense the resistance to hermeneutic unraveling that Celan's poem exerts. "Engfuhrung" discloses the trace of that which can never be converted into language. By passing silence over it, however, the poem also veils this trace. Nothing is inscribed in the text, and nothing resists articulation. This nothing can hardly be hermeneutically excavated and brought to articulation, since it is passed over and covered by silence. Another way of putting it would be to say that nothing cannot be de- ported. Equally well, nothing, having taken place in the inscription of the asterisks, cannot be annihilated, nor lost, simply because it has taken place. The stars irreducibly belong to the poem. They write the text apart, this text which according to Szondi is "the terrain of death and mourning." Marking the taking place of the text, the materiality of the asterisks resists hermeneutic disclosure precisely because it cannot be turned into something meaningful. If Celan's poem transcribes an unspeakability - if it speaks, that is, out of the punctuating constellation of mute stars - this implies at the same time, strictly speaking, that we ought to read. The lesson being that something radically other than language takes place in the poetic text; perhaps a constellation. Szondi, who attentively cites Mallarmé from "Crise de vers" (408), does not quote the even more pertinent lines from "Un Coup de dés," that poem which is incessantly occupied with the Abîme: "Nothing may have taken place but the place," the famous dic- tum runs, "except perhaps a constellation" (474-77). n The asterisks - being the inscription of nothing other than what they are, which is nothing - resist hermeneutic appropriation, since they mark the taking place of language without language. This, then, may be the adequate place to discuss the notion of poetry after the incomparable event designated as the Holocaust. "Engfuhrung" demonstrates what may be regarded as the possible impossibility of poetry after Auschwitz. The poem is "in a very definite sense the refutation of the overly famous assertion of Theodor W. Adorno," Szondi remarks (416). He is, of course, referring to the much quoted Adornian proscrip- tion that after Auschwitz "it has become impossible to write poetry" (34). Szondi elaborates Adorno's thesis, though, by underscoring: "After Ausch- witz, poetry can only be written by virtue of Auschwitz" (353). Despite this admirable attempt at coming to terms with the position of poetry after</page><page sequence="9">166 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES the Holocaust, it is necessary to further augment Szondi's specification and add that if the basis of poetry after Auschwitz is abyssal - if poetry is grounded, that is, on what is groundless; if it in a certain sense is based on an annihilation - then the condition of its possibility is its impossibility. Werner Harnacher makes this necessary addition in an essay, conjecture ing: "the poem is only still capable of speaking because it exposes itself to the impossibility of its speaking" (297). If the poem after Auschwitz speaks only thanks to its openness to the "impossibility of its speaking," it is thus less a po-em and more a no-em. Asterisks occur only in texts. They must be read - read, that is, in a certain light. Thus making a difference, writing the text apart, these graphic stars shed light - written or material light, as it were - on that which was lost. Ein I Stern hat wohl noch Licht. But with "the dark light of this nothing," as Derrida puts it in "Mnemosyne," an essay dedicated to the memory of Paul de Man, "we learn that the other resists the closure of our interiorizing memory" (34). This would be what makes Celan's poem such incomparable, yet truly terrible, reading: nothing, nothing makes a difference. Yale University NOTES 1. Schibboleth, 110.

Szondi refers to Grimms' Deutsches Wôrterbuch 480 (397). As Werner Harnacher has pointed out to me, one should not rule out the possibility of a dactylic meter in the quotation. The question of metrics in Celan, still much overlooked in Celan scholarship, might profitably be approached from the point of view of a thematization of inherent attributes of language. 6. This is the definition given by Der Grofie Brockhaus, cited in Jean Bollack's German</page><page sequence="10">CELAN'S "ENGFÛHRUNG" 167 translation of Szondi's essay ("Durch die Enge gefiihrt," 351). The French original quotes Limé and Robert (393). 7. I would add that Hermogenes, who rhetorically codified figures such as chiasmus, talks about "chiastic periods" in his treatise on invention, Peri eureseos, which seems to correspond to Szondi's scheme (176-83). For Hermogenes, the chiasmus does not exclu- sively fill a stylistic task. It also functions as a principle giving order to ideas. One is also reminded of Hôlderlin's theory of the alternation of tones and periods. 8. Wlad Godzich, whom I am here paraphrasing, wants to see deictics as the "inaugural act of reference" from which "all other forms of reference will flow" (xvi- xvii). 9. On the "premise" of his enterprise, Szondi writes: the poem "demands less that the meaning of words is taken into consideration, than that their function is considered" (401). The implied distinction involves reading the text as a musical score and not interpreting it in terms of the representation of a given semanticity - which indicates that Szondi is more interested in the "in-between," so to speak, or the stuff out of which relations are made. He advances the idea that, "fundamentally, there is no representation" (390). "Poetry is not mimesis, no longer representation," he continues later on, "it becomes reality. Poetic reality, to be sure, text" (399). If there is a disadvantage to this view - in which a "poetic reality," the text, guarantees a resistance to extinction that is of a pure linguistic order - it might be that it overlooks a certain materiality through which negativity is nonetheless posited in Celan's poetry. This materiality refuses, in the final analysis, to be converted into language. Out of such a condition, it is my thesis, Celan's poetry nevertheless speaks - impossibly. Cf. also Hans-Jost Frey's critique of Szondi's implicit assumption that writing is a "reproduction" (Abbildung) of speech (63). 10. The crossing of theme and structure, the modus operandi of the stretto, finds a crucial formulation in a note in Celan's Nachlafi, where it is said: Im Chiasmus ist das Kreuz ndher als im Thema "Kreuz" ("In the chiasmus, the cross is closer than in the theme 'cross' " [reported by Boschenstein-Schàfer, "Traum und Sprache," 226]). 1 1 . Voswinckel is close to equating "the starlike word" with the word of those who wore the yellow star, an interpretation which is paralleled by Mayer 94-95 and 129-33. 12. For brevity's sake, I quote the text, which is spread over several pages, in compressed form and without capital letters. In this context, one may be reminded of the "alphabet of stars" that Mallarmé discusses in the section on "L'action restreinte" in Variations sur un sujet, of which "Crise de vers" is also part (370). As for the asterisks in Celan's poem, one also thinks of the tenth of Rilke's Duino Elegies, in which not only an owl figures - as in the penultimate stanza of "Engfuhrung" - but also the only asterisk in the Elegies (725).
