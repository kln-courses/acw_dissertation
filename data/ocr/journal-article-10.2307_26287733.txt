This large format, lavishly illustrated volume traces the career of Salvador Dali, the artist-writer, through his formative years and the decline of his art in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Dali's relationship with surrealism and Breton comprises one of the important moments of Finkelstein's narrative. Breton's judgment of Dali is well known. In the 1930s, Breton lavished praise on Dali and regarded his paranoiac-critical method as incarnating the "omnipotence of desire" so endearing to the surrealists. As the decade drew to a close, however, Breton increasingly criticized Dali, whom he saw as displaying racist and fascist sentiments and a proclivity to commercialize art. (Breton created from Dali's name the anagram: "Avida Dollars.") Finkelstein sets out to counter the view that Dali's art in the late 1930s and 1940s was eclipsed by his exhibitionism. Rather than accepting the notion of a transition, Finkelstein sees him as an antithetical, even antinomical artist, moving in his early work, as well as in his later work, between "seriousness and clowning, authenticity and playacting, clarity of vision and self-deception" (3). Finkelstein posits the thesis that between his work in the late 1930s and the early forties, Dali underwent a radical change (hence the subtitle) that eventually brought about a decline in his "artistic and creative strength" (3). Finkelstein examines closely the interplay between Dali's early art and writing as well as personal events that led to an evolving dynamics, an evolution from chaos and confusion to aesthetic control (the desire "to become classic," as Dali said). Two important moments of this evolution involved Dali's relationship with Federico Garcia Lorca and his collaboration with Luis Bunuel. Lorca exerted an overweening influ ence on Dali's writing of the twenties, through perhaps 1927. Their relationship played itself out under the sign of the protean figure of Saint Sebastian, with its sadomasochistic and androgynic traces, which offered Dali an aesthetic escape from what he saw as the dis order of the world. He effected escape through what he termed a "saintly objectivity" (letter to Lorca, summer 1926), which drew on aspects of cubism and increasingly on meta physical art, that of Chirico in particular. He developed a formal vocabulary "to express his perception of an all-pervading putrefaction as an aesthetic equivalent to an underlying cpnep r\f coviialiftr" Little by little Dali's aesthetic of "saintly objectivity" ceded to his erotic and scato logical exhibitionism. Dali became more and more critical of Lorca's turn, in Canciones, to local and traditional culture and his disinterest in modern technological innovations. Dali moved closer to Bunuel, who tried to pry him loose from Lorca's "dire influence" (his sup posed provincialism and homosexual tendencies) (79-80). In the film Un chien andalou, the symbol formation contributed by Dali worked through Freudian ideas of displacement, while Bunuel's depiction of human presence helped to break Dali out of his preoccupation with abstraction and to awaken him to the rich possibilities of meaning through the com bination of human action and symbolic representation (95). This change evinced itself in Dali's attempt in the late '20s to mediate between abstract art and surrealism, whose poetic and artistic automatism attracted him. The surrealists, though strongly drawn to Dali's work, found it too explicitly pornographic and were put off by Dali's scatological imagery and its terrorizing intention (182). The most dramatic moments of Dali's work in the early '30s derived from Freud's notion of "perverse sexuality" and the sexual interdictions tied up with the father figure. Also at this time Dali began an affair with Gala, who became for him "a fixed point of reference" serving as an anchor for his sexual fantasies (134) and as a cure for his fear of the act of love as an annihilating force (214). Vol. XXXVI, No. 4 97</page><page sequence="2">L'Esprit Créateur In his art he increasingly mixed the animate and inanimate and developed a "body language of hysterics" (159), mutilation, decomposition, cannibalism, ingestion and excre tion. His Paranoia-Criticism involved the process of paranoiac delirium controlled and directed by the artist "to systematize confusion and thus contribute to discrediting com pletely the world of reality" (Oui 1 155; cited 181). It served as an alternative to automa tism, a transcription of fantasies and obsessions (psychotic delusions) conjuring images in the imagination. The multiple artistic figuration conveyed "a symbolic representation of the paranoic process" (193). In applying the technique of PC to canvas, Dali in the mid-30s experimented with anthropomorphic landscapes involving the Gestalt phenomenon of figure and ground reversal that led the viewer to perceive a changing tableau, where, for instance, a landscape became a human or animal figure. Breton likened this activity to the concoction of parlor games, "mere entertainments on the level of crossword puzzles" (Surrealism and Painting 147; cited 206). Finkelstein clearly documents the slackening in the late '30s in Dali's art/ writing of his aesthetic and formal preoccupations and a turn to commercialism. His aban donment of the "aesthetics of libidinal gratification as the mainspring of his theoretical system" implied a change in his stance vis-à-vis surrealism and "a declaration of libera tion" from Bretonian and Freudian thought (241-42). The quasi-autobiographical Secret Life of Salvador Dali shows Dali, in the early '40s, moving away from psychoanalysis towards mythology, metaphysics, and mysticism (under the aegis of Gala, whom he associ ated with the Gradiva myth, suggesting that Dali's art represents the return of the repressed effected by Gala herself, who replaced the paternal super-ego figure of the father). Finkelstein's work is one of the few that fully and clearly account for the radical changes occurring in Dali's art and writing during the formative years of the late '20s through the early '40s. He leads the reader ultimately to pose the question of Dali's impor tance to modern art and thought. As Finkelstein's subtitle, "The Metamorphoses of Nar cissus," alludes, few artists have so unfetteredly explored their private passions and obses sions, for better or for worse. Dali's art and aesthetics, in their supreme (least commercial ized) moments enriched surrealism by their "masterly visual sophistication" (xiii, Fran cesco Pellizzi, in his Foreword). Finally, Dali's anti-formalist iconoclasm contributed sig nificantly to exploding the notion of "high art" that underlay modernist theory, leaving a legacy that has helped to carry modern art and thought into the present time of critical scrutiny and artistic-writerly liberation to which many have given the term postmodernism.
