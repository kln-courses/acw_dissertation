SMITH New York University New York City, New York 10012 mssll@nyu.edu The first part of this two-part essay comments on the indigenous Levantine cultural tradition that helped to generate early Israelite lite- rature. This second part examines the question of Mesopotamian influence on the Israelite narrative tradition and some of the subse- quent effects in the formation of biblical narrative. There is one factor in the hermeneutical process in ancient Israel's transmission of its tra- ditions (thought hardly the only one), which to my mind has not been considered sufficiently, and that is the possible influence of Mesopo- tamia on biblical prose narrative. Mesopotamian Influence in Iron II Judah Before moving into this question, it is important to note the larger context for such possible literary influence, in the form of Mesopota- mian influence on related aspects of ancient Israelite culture, specifi- 1 I wish to reiterate my thanks to Elizabeth Bloch-Smith, Daniel Fleming, Baruch Levine, Bernard Levinson, Peter Machinist, S.

On the level of material culture,2 we may briefly note a few examples of Assyrian influence for Iron II Judah. The Assyrian style painting of a figure (thought to have been a seated governor) was dis- covered on a shard at Ramat Rahel.3 Assyrian-style clay vessels identi- fied at Ramat Rahel, Jerusalem and many other Judean sites became, in Menachem Stern's term, "Judaized," through the addition of red bur- nishing typical of local tradition.4 An Assyrian glass cup has been found at Aroer in the Beersheba valley.5 Personal seals from Judah in this period likewise show Mesopotamian motifs (Stern lists the hero strug- gling with two lions or other monsters; a priest standing before a Meso- potamian fire-altar; a human-headed legless scorpion with a long tail; and finally, the winged sun-disk in what he calls "its Mesopotamian rendering").6 Such influence, particularly on objects, 7 is unsurprising for Iron II Judah in view of the Assyrian influence in various areas of material culture in its new provinces directly north and west of Judah.8 Mesopotamian religious influence in the Levant and in particular in Judah has long been noted as well, most strikingly in "the Tammuz" (Ezek 8:14) and the Queen of Heaven (Jer 7:18; 44:18, 25).9 While the 2 For discussions of the archaeological evidence for Iron II Judah, with evidence for Assy- rian influence (or its lack), see Ephraim STERN, Archaeology of the Land of the Bible: Volume II: The Assyrian , Babylonian , and Persian Periods (732-332 B.C.E.)

Akka- dian loanwords into Biblical Hebrew in the prose narratives of both the Pentateuch and the Deuteronomistic History further suggest that the evidence is not operative only in the arena of material culture, but also in the literary production of the Bible.

One possibility worth pursuing is whether the older poetic Levantine tradition in Israel (as discussed in Part I) was dis- placed by the development of Israelite prose narrative under the influence of Mesopotamian models, whether direct or indirect David Damrosch has argued a case of this sort: The great question is how the Hebrew writers came to write such rich and ambi- tious historical prose, apparently beginning almost as soon as a scribal elite was established in the early monarchy and very rapidly outstripping, in length, com- plexity, and literary power, any known examples of historical prose in earlier Near Eastern chronicle. The thesis of this book is that the origins of Hebrew historical prose can be traced in Mesopotamian literature of the second millen- nium, but not through a direct comparison of historical writings alone.12 To my mind, Damrosch may be on the right track. However, his ana- lysis lacks precision in that he would broadly date Mesopotamian influence on Israelite genres in the second millennium. Following Dam- rosch, one might see an older period of influence arguably at work, especially for Genesis 1-11 (perhaps more particularly, Genesis 6-9), in exemplars of Atrahasis and perhaps some other Mesopotamian classics known in the Levant in this early period. From Ugarit we do know of traditions of Atrahasis, Gilgamesh and other compositions of the Meso- potamian scribal tradition.13 It is possible that these Levantine imports 12 DAMROSCH, The Narrative Covenant: Transformations of Genre in the Growth of Biblical Literature (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1987) 40-41. 13 The Atrahasis text at Ras Shamra, RS 22.421, was published in J.

More recently, the disco-</page><page sequence="5">UGARITIC AND AKKADIAN BIBLICAL LITERATURE (II) 193 continued from the Late Bronze Age and then into Israelite tradition. Within Genesis 1-11, the lack of verbal agreement with parallel Akka- dian texts as opposed to motifs and the relative paucity of loaned voca- bulary in literature militate against direct literary dependence. With Genesis 1-11 we are working more with shared motifs and a basic plot- line14 that originated in Mesopotamia rather than actually known texts. (In view of the West Semitic tradition evident in Genesis 2-3, 15 one might reduce the view of this influence to Genesis 6-9.16) In sum, there is little in the Iron I Israelite context that points in the direction of early influence; perhaps then these works did not survive into the Iron I context from the Late Bronze scribal practice in the Levant.17 Instead, it seems equally, if not more, plausible to suppose that this influence came into biblical tradition considerably later, in the Iron II period. When we turn to biblical texts apart from Genesis 1-11, a basic dif- ference in the issue of influence is to be noted at the outset. The force of the Mesopotamian impact may work differently in biblical narrative apart from Genesis 1-11. In the case of Genesis 1-11 (or at least, Genesis 6-9), these works show the imprint of Mesopotamian tradition. In these chapters, the Bible receives and modifies the prior Mesopota- very of a tablet of Gilgamesh has been reported from the 1994 excavations in the House of Urtenu at Ugarit, but the tablet has yet to be published by D.

SMITH mian narrative. In contrast, the narrative traditions in biblical prose narrative outside of Genesis 1-11 appear largely indigenous to the west (as discussed in Part I), and these may have been influenced seconda- rily by Mesopotamian forms and language. For biblical narrative apart from Genesis 1-11, Iron II appears to be the relevant period of influence. As noted above, Akkadian loanwords point to influence in this period. To be sure, such loanwords in some categories are not very helpful, except as general indicators of Assyrian influence (e. g., terms for office such as tapsâr (a military officer) in Jer 51:27 and Nah 3:17, rab-šaqeh in 2 Kings 18-19//Isaiah 36-37, tartan , "field commander" in 2 Kgs 18:17 and Isa 20:1, or segai , "queen" in Ps 45:10 and Neh 2:6). However, other vocabulary loaned into Hebrew from Akkadian might be evidence for literary use of Akkadian; here one may point to words such as agam, "swamp, pool" (&lt; Akkadian agammu) in Exod 7:19, 8:1; Isa 14:23, 35:7, 41:18, 42:15; Jer 51:32; Pss 107:35, 114:8; ed, "ground-swell, flood" (&lt; Akkadian edû) in Gen 2:6 and Job 36:27. While perhaps not so much weight should be placed on this sort of evi- dence, some literary knowledge more specific than motifs might have come into Judean literary culture. Moving to literary evidence, it is evident that thanks to Judean vas- salage in the Iron II period Judean scribal culture had some knowledge of Akkadian forms.18 Political terms (such as the ones mentioned above) would have been obvious choices for such a Judean scribal culture. So would the treaties between Judah and its Assyrian overlord, as sug- gested by a parallel that R. Borger saw between one Esarhaddon curse and Deut 28:23. 19 W. L. Moran seconded this parallel and added another that he called "one of the most striking parallels the writer knows between cuneiform and biblical literature,"20 namely Deut 29:23f. and the following from the annals of Assurbanípal that refe- rences the curses in his treaty with Arubu (as rendered by Moran) : "The people of Arubu asked one and other again and again, 'Why has such an evil thing as this overtaken Arubu?' (and) they say, 'Because we have not kept the mighty oaths of the god Assur, we have sinned against the 18 See K.

It would make sense that the Judean scribal culture operating in the milieu of Assy- rian suzerainty would know not only the textual forms expressing Assy- rian domination, but also some of the legal norms operative across the ancient Near East in the wake of Assyrian domination. We may infer further familiarity also from the scope of Mesopotamian impact on pro- phetic material, discerned for example by Peter Machinist for First Isaiah.25 Accordingly, the Judean scribal culture and the larger elite sur- rounding it might well have been conversant with a variety of Meso- potamian forms, rhetoric and ideas. The question is how. In the area of religion, some scholars have suggested seeing an Assyro-Aramean symbiosis as the larger cultural context for Mesopota- 21 For further discussion of other parallels, see J. H. TlGAY, "Excursus 27: The Literary Background of Deuteronomy 28," in his The J PS Torah Commentary: Deuteronomy (Phila- delphia/Jerusalem: The Jewish Publication Society, 1996) 494-97. 22 The older groundbreaking work in this regard was Shalom M. PAUL, Studies in the Book of the Covenant in the Light of Cuneiform and Biblical Law (VTSup 18; Leiden: Brill, 1968). 23 David Wright has proposed an exilic setting for this borrowing. See WRIGHT, "The Laws of Hammurabi as a Source for the Covenant Collection," Maarav 10 (2003) 11-87. The wealth of detail in the study is quite valuable. 24 On this question of Deuteronomy's relationship to the Covenant Code, there are widely varying approaches. In his theory that Deuteronomy 12-25 was ordered by topic in the order of the Ten Commandments, Stephen A. Kaufman has hewed to a largely comparative approach: KAUFMAN, "The Structure of the Deuteronomic Law," Maarav 1/2 (1979) 105-58. Cf. the seminal work by Bernard M. LevinSON, Deuteronomy and the Hermeneutics of Inno- vation (New York/Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997); and the review by Paul DlON, Biblica 80 (1999) 116-19. Levinson looks at cases of textual interpretation between the two corpora. Both approaches nonetheless indicate the priority of the Covenant Code. 25 See MACHINIST, "Assyria and Its Image in the First Isaiah," JAOS 103 (1983) 719-37; and "Mesopotamian Imperialism and Israelite Religion: A Case Study from the Second Isaiah," in Symbiosisy Symbolism...

SMITH mian influence on Iron II Judah.26 Accordingly, one might consider Akkadian-Aramaic bilingual texts as some indicator of the mechanism of scribal translation. Here the curse formulas of the Tell Fekheriyeh inscription appear potentially instructive. This inscription is suggestive of the Assyro-Aramean scribal symbiosis, known already in Mesopo- tamia and emblemized by figures such as Ahiqar. Neo-Assyrian wall painting, for example from Tel Barsip, shows a cuneiform scribe working alongside the Aramaic writing scribe.27 In this connection, we may also note Neo-Babylonian sēpiru/sepīru , "scribe writing alphabetic script (mostly on skin)."28 Closer to ancient Israel, the ancient site of Hama yielded texts in Akkadian and Aramaic during excavations conducted in the 1930s. The Akkadian texts includes two letters, one dating to the ninth and the other to ninth-eighth centuries, as well as "about 20...cuneiform tablets, mainly of medical, magical and astrolo- gical contexts" from a building that appears to have been destroyed in the Assyrian attack of 720 BCE.29 The Aramaic inscriptions from the site appear on objects. Many are personal names scratched on the surface of slabs sometimes with petitionary formulas; there are also a few seal impressions and ostraca with names.30 The disposition of the presently available material suggests that Akkadian continued to be used for professional purposes while Aramaic served for identification and other personal use. It is unclear how representative the evidence from Hama was for the wider Levantine context in the Iron Age, especially in the southern Levant. Some scholars, most recently Paul-Alain Beaulieu, have sug- gested that Akkadian may be in some retreat from the Levant in the 26 See Cogan, Imperialism and Religion , 113. 27 See ANEP 235. 28 CAD S:225. Note also the verb sepēru , "to write in Alphabetic script (on skin)" (CAD S:225). Both words are labeled by CAD as Aramaic loanwords into Akkadian.

According to 2 Kings 18:26//Isaiah 36:11, he is asked to give his speech not in "Judean", but in Aramaic. It is to be noted that if Akkadian were the lingua franca, then the Rab-shaqeh would have been asked to give his speech instead in Akkadian. In short, Akkadian as a lingua franca could be in retreat in the southern Levant, even as Aramaic is becoming an important lan- guage medium even within the Mesopotamian heartland.32 Given its rising importance at that time, Aramaic as a means of mediation of Assyrian texts seems plausible, for at least some biblical material. Still, this is difficult to confirm. Indeed, there are not so many Aramaic loan- words for this period (perhaps bar in Psalm 2: 12, 33 which would suit a monarchic-period context) which one might expect if Aramaic had been a mediating language. Instead, what little Aramaic we have in Genesis-2 Kings (e. g., Genesis 3 1 :47) could derive from the proximity of Aramean territory and ancient Israel (cf. 2 Kings 5:20, 8:28-29; the Tel Dan inscription). In short, the idea of Aramaic displacing Akkadian in the southern Levant seems a problematic direction for explaining the broader Mesopotamian impact on biblical narrative in Genesis-2 Kings. There remains so much that we do not know about the nature of Mesopotamian literary influence on Iron II Judah. The mediation process is hardly clear, and the related issue, namely the extent of foreign language knowledge in Judean scribal circles, remains equally obscure. And yet the influence appears undeniable. Thanks in large measure to the repertoire of shared motifs, we have a general sense of Mesopotamian material that has made its way into Judean culture. In sum, the primeval material of Genesis 1-11, the legal tradition and M P. -A.

See also the comments of Parpóla, "Assyria's Expansion in the 8,h and 7,h Centuries and Its Long-Term Repercussions in the West," 100-1. According to Parpóla, Tiglath-Pileser III introduced Aramaic as the lingua franca for purposes of imperial control. 52 If so, the loss of Aramaic versions of texts, might be explained as a question of the medium used for Aramaic texts in the Mesopotamian context. The palace of Assurbanipal has records of texts that came into his library, many of which were written on writing boards subsequently lost, and the relief from Tel Barsip mentioned above shows the Aramaic writing scribe working with skin. Both materials are highly perishable. Both bar and *ben (see bèni in verse 7) are evidently known to the author of Psalm 2; so the question is why *bčn was not used in both instances. Perhaps the word bar was used in verse 12 for its resonance with beyirâ and bir'adâ in the preceding verse.</page><page sequence="10">198 MARK S. SMITH treaty/covenant material all involve adaptation of Mesopotamian tradi- tions, with rather broad and very complex histories (which lie beyond the scope of this discussion). In these genres, it may be suggested that they received their Israelite formulations by the end of the Iron II period. With this limited sense of Mesopotamian literary influence, we may proceed to the question of the genre of chronicles. The Genre of Chronicles as a Mesopotamian Import? The books of Kings, with their Akkadian loanwords, seem to reflect the sort of Mesopotamian impact discussed thus far. It would be wor- thwhile to explore a possibility - it is one that is neither particularly original nor possible to prove - involving Mesopotamian impact in one area of narrative, and that is the genre of chronicles. G. W. Ahlström posed a related, salient question over a decade ago: "If national histo- riography first started in Babylonia in the eighth century BCE, might not Hebrew historiography be later...?" 34 For all the possible criticisms and lack of supporting evidence, a consideration of the apparent career of the chronicle form may provide, at a minimum, a heuristically helpful angle for looking at biblical prose narrative, especially in the genre of chronicles. The chronicle form in Mesopotamia and its mani- festation in the books of Kings at least provide a witness to a broad royal interest in the past in the 8th to 6th centuries. More specifically, such an interest may have generated a more direct influence of older Mesopota- mian chronicle form on the evolving exemplars in Kings. As Ahlström noted, within Kings there are embedded older historiographie works that predate the chronistic form as such in ancient Israel. The larger chronistic framework may have served to provide a broader context for emergent Israelite and Judean royal historiography that had earlier pre- served a variety of accounts apart from the chronicle form that extends over multiple reigns. The question is the origins of the chronistic form, possibly as a Mesopotamian borrowing and adaptation. To situate this possibility, it may be helpful to note the relative dis- tribution of the chronicle genre in ancient Near East sources. The chro- nicle form covering multiple dynasties is unknown in either Ugaritic or any other Levantine corpus through the beginning of the Iron Age.

For example, the "Story of Zalpa, written during the Old Hittite period, combines a foundation story with an account of the reigns of two Hittite kings.35 There is also a remarkable piece of historiography from Mari. This text covers over a century in the history of Shamshi-Adad's family, with years listed by name often fol- lowed by a further description.36 Despite such texts, we do not seem to have anything in the periphery resembling the chronicle form covering multiples dynasties. In contrast, royal chronicles covering multiple reigns enjoyed a sub- stantial tradition in Mesopotamia, as Jean-Jacques Glassner's recent volume nicely illustrates.37 "Older Mesopotamian models" such as the Assyrian "Synchronistic History," are regularly cited in comparison with the books of Kings despite some notable differences.38 In the west, chronicles of this sort are attested first in what we see in the books of Kings. Further west, in Egypt, the chronicle form does not appear until considerably later. Donald B. Redford argued that the chronicle form was an import into Egypt. Redford comments: Chronicles per se do not constitute a native genre, being derived from Baby- lonia. For the Late Period there is the so-called Demotic Chronicle..., of selected events of the past, which, in form and inspiration, shows strong Asiastic influence.39 Redford's observations point to a West Asiastic middle-point between the long tradition of Mesopotamian chronicles and the rather late 35 See Alexander UCHITEL, "Local versus General History in Old Hittite Historiography," in The Limits of Historiography: Genre and Narrative in Ancient Historical Texts (Mnemo- syne Suppl. 191; Leiden/Boston/Köln: Brill, 1999) 55-67, esp. 59-60 (reference courtesy of Karel van der Toorn).

SMITH appearance of the form in Egyptian literature. The biblical books of Kings, which shows many of the features known from Mesopotamian chronicles, evidences influence somewhere in-between. Cory Peacock has noted that some of what I have called literary loanwords are topo- graphical terms used in neo-Assyrian annals.40 One can thus imagine a Judean scribal culture that works, whether directly or indirectly,41 with various Akkadian forms including chronicles. Given the possible borrowing and adaptation of the chronicle form, its use in Kings requires some comment. Various forms of royal chro- nicles might be reconstructed in Israel and Judah prior to any first edition of the Books of Kings as claimed by scholars (whether Hezekiah or Josiah or in the exile, or some combination of these). As a working model, it may be supposed that any pre-Hezekian chronicles or a first edition in the time of Hezekiah or Josiah would constitute a terminus a quo for the influence of the Mesopotamian chronicle form.42 Likewise borrowed toward the end of the Neo-Assyrian period, legal codes and treaty/covenant forms, with their long Mesopotamian backgrounds, share the curious coincidence of being combined with chronicles in the construction of Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomistic History. While much more work clearly needs to be done, the impact of Mesopotamian 40 Peacock, "The Akkadian Loanwords in Biblical Hebrew: A Sociological and Semantic Distribution Analysis." 41 Note the lack of neo-Assyrian influence on West Semitic building inscriptions.

D. diss.; New Haven, CT: Yale University, 2003) esp. 421-22 n. 66. 42 The question of the history of the composition of Kings, including various proposals for various editions and redactions, lies beyond the scope of this discussion. I am inclined to accept a highly complex compositional history that includes pre-Hezekian material of various sorts, a Hezekian edition, a Josianic redaction and post-Josianic additions, along with later additions of various sorts; in short a long process involving a "rolling corpus." For a survey of views, with his own reconstruction of seven successive redactions/editions from ca. 970 to ca. 560, see André Lemaire, "Vers l'histoire de la redaction des livres des Rois," ZAW 98 (1986) 221-36.

G. N. Knoppers and J. G. McConville; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2000) 446-61. Robert R. Wilson (oral communication) has likewise used this term for Kings (I wish to thank Professor Wilson for several discussions on this question of the composition of Kings).

In a myriad of ways, Israel reformulated its own cultural traditions in the ongoing literary and religious context of Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Baby- lonian hegemony. This period, running roughly from the eighth to the sixth centuries, was arguably the first major period of written literary production in ancient Israel. The confluence of genres was part of an expression of the larger creative energies evident in this period.44 The longer Pentateuchal and Deuteronomistic narratives, which amalga- mated older traditions into increasingly complex narratives, included massive reinterpretations of older tradition. While the books of Kings, for example, include a great deal of older material (material from royal annals and prophetic legends), its oldest posited edition reorients these materials toward the king (variously Hezekiah or Josiah, in different scholarly reconstructions) who functioned as its hero. Similarly, the Pentateuch, with older traditions predating the Neo-Assyrian period, may have received significant literary impetus during this period.45 One might recklessly speculate further that the chronicle form deve- loped for the books of Kings ultimately helped to inspire not the form but the generation of other long narratives in the Deuteronomistic History and perhaps had a comparable effect on the generation of the 4,ł PARKER, The Pre-Biblical Narrative Tradition (SBLRBS 24; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1989).

KawaSHIMA, Biblical Narrrative and the Death of Rhapsode (Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature; Bloomington/Indiana- polis: Indiana University Press, 2004) 8, 9. To my mind, Damrosch's comments about genre are only a beginning point; clearly, other literary factors are involved as well. 4&gt; The dates of the material long designated as the J and E sources, if they can be so maintained, may work in an eighth century setting.

SMITH longer forms of the Pentateuch. I do not mean to suggest that the sort of story-telling in the Pentateuch relates formally to the chronicle form; indeed, story-telling in the Pentateuch, Judges and Samuel has been compared with great benefit rather to the cycles of stories in the Uga- ritic poetic works of Aqhat and Kirta; I am only suggesting the possibi- lity that the generation of long cycles of written material in the Pentateuch and the Deuteronomistic History in their prose forms might have been inspired, in part at least, by the literary amalgamation reflected in the books of Kings in this period. Thanks to the ongoing collection of and reflection on received materials, the Israelite tradition issued in works that arguably were psychologically more complex com- pared to their older Levantine prototypes (e.g., parallels between the books of Samuel versus Kirta, or between some of the chapters in the patriarchal stories compared to Aqhat). In sum, whatever the precise nature of cultural influences from either Ugarit or Mesopotamia, we may locate the prose narrative tradition of the Bible in a highly creative matrix situated between the older indigenous Levantine tradition, which was mainly poetic (as represented in part by the Ugaritic texts), and the later impact of Mesopotamian culture. This combination of influences served as the matrix that helped to generate the rather complex narrative works of the Bible. Biblical Narratives: Textual Harmonization versus Textual Sites of Cultural Conflict Placing biblical prose narrative broadly between Ugaritic and Akka- dian leads to a reconsideration of biblical narrative compared to and contrasted with our longer Ugaritic narratives. Let us look first to some of the dynamics internal to the development of Ugaritic and biblical corpora. In the case of both Ugaritic and biblical literary corpora, scho- lars have identified royal and priestly perspectives in the production of both sets of texts. The larger, literary compositions of both Ugarit and the Bible bring together different voices. How they do so differs in some rather significant ways. In the case of the Ugaritic texts, in particular the Baal Cycle, they harmonize the symbolic worldviews of the monarchy and the priesthood. In ancient Ugarit, these texts harmonized the central claim about the cosmic order mediated politically by the monarchy and cultically by the priesthood. In ancient Israel, early Iron II forms of royal presentation could have included such harmonizations of the representations of the past, for example in royal psalmody (see</page><page sequence="15">UGARITIC AND AKKADIAN BIBLICAL LITERATURE (II) 203 the oracles in royal psalms, such as Psalms 2, 89 and 110) and cult as represented in both texts (e. g., Psalm 29) and temple architecture, which has been insightfully noted by E. M. Bloch-Smith.46 However, such a harmonization of royal status and priestly support in represen- ting the past is not the key to the present form of the books of Kings or to the Pentateuch. The major narratives of the Bible are not simply representations or juxtapositions of representation of the past, but jux- tapositions of competing responses to, and interpretations of, Israel's past. In contrast with the Ugaritic texts with their monarchic-priestly harmonizations, the Bible developed from a further constellation of viewpoints, which cluster under the rubrics of deuteronomic or deute- ronomistic texts47; these were added to the priestly traditions over and above the older monarchic harmonizations. Despite the complexity of their definition and historical relations, the versions of past Israelite identity from the perspectives of the deutero- nomistic tradents of the Pentateuch and Deuteronomistic History constitute sites of cultural conflict. The juxtapositions of viewpoints in these large prose corpora venture a claim for priestly and deuterono- mistic subordination of prior or contemporaneous representations. For example, the Temple narrative in 1 Kings 6-8 partially submerges the expression of monarchic power and closes with the massive deuterono- mistic reformulation of the Temple plan. It is the end point of the text, with Solomon's dedication of the Temple in chapter 8 that the deutero- nomistic purpose of the Temple overrides the purposes of its royal 46 E. BLOCH-SMITH, '"Who is the King of Glory': Solomon's Temple as Symbol," in Scrip- ture and Other Artifacts: Essays on the Bible and Archaeology in Honor of Philip J. King (ed. M. D. Coogan, C. Exum and L. E. Stager; Louisville, KY: Westminster/John Knox Press, 1994) 18-31; and "Solomon's Temple: The Politics of Ritual Space," in Sacred Place- Sacred Time: Archaeology and the Religion of Israel (ed. B. Gitlin; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2001) 83-94. 47 My comments do not presuppose a single edition of "the Deuteronomistic History" as proposed by Martin Noth and modified in a number of directions since Noth. While it seems that the books of Joshua through Kings were each produced under the influence of figures who hold to some version (s) of deuteronomic thought, the differences in the amount and types of deuteronomistic material in Samuel as opposed to Kings militates against a single redaction across Joshua through Kings. For the older standard work on the subject, see Moshe WEINFELD, Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972; repr., Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1992).

As a result, the construction of the Temple serves less as a des- cription of a place of sacrifice and more as a relay station for prayer, in particular in chapter 8. On the whole, 1 Kings 8 strongly redirects the perspective on the Temple that the older royal annalistic material within 1 Kings 6-7 promoted. If we turn to the Pentateuch, we see first and foremost how the priestly tradition has manipulated the version (s) represented in modern scholarly criticism as the "Yahwist" and "Elohist" "sources" (or "docu- ments"), and triumphed over the older poetic versions known inside and outside of the Pentateuch. It is for this reason that "the last shall be the first," that Genesis 1 overpowers (perhaps even overwrites) the prior creation narrative of Genesis 2:4bf., and its placement and textual relations to later priestly material in the Pentateuch reshape its larger trajectory so that the priestly cult becomes the central moment of world revelation on Mount Sinai. The older model of divine conflict had been suitable for expressing royal power as in Psalm 89:2648, but in Genesis 1, conflict is out; God is the power beyond such analogies with human power, and the world is not simply made or created. Instead, it is ren- dered in terms of priestly distinction, lěhabdtt , the priestly term for making ritual distinctions, for example in Leviticus 10:10, 11:47 (P); 20:25 (Holiness Code). As a result, cosmic creation becomes a religious map promoting priestly institutions of Shabbat (2:2-3), the priestly calendar (1:14), and arguably even an early form of priestly kashrut (1:20-25; see lěhabdíl applied to animals in Lev 11:47, cf. 20:25). The older versions centering on anthropomorphic presentations of divine power are submerged, yet remain as sub-versions of the master tradi- tion, if only to reflect God's ultimate power. Perhaps most spectacularly, the placement of Genesis 1 as the head of the entire biblical corpus is not simply a statement of priestly hegemony, but a literary victory over other versions. The textual formulation is itself the context for cultural conflict. As sites of religious battle, biblical texts show some of the blood of Israel's own cultural conflicts. For example, the divine battle conflict of the older Levantine poetic tradition was first reshaped in Israel's poetic traditions, and it was then submerged under the weight of Israel's prose reshapings driven by its own internal religious conflicts. Similarly, the juxtaposition of the differing views of the same events, such as creation 48 See Paul MOSCA, "Ugarit and Daniel 7: A Missing Link," Biblica 67 (1986) 496-517; Smith, The Origins of Biblical Monotheism , 157-61.</page><page sequence="17">UGARITIC AND AKKADIAN BIBLICAL LITERATURE (II) 205 or the Temple, did not mark an effort to simply harmonize representa- tions of the past. Rather, it was all about asserting a master-version vic- torious over other versions that were permitted to remain. This textual warfare in turn affected the representation of the Deity in Israel's past. The Deity shifted in nature from the anthropomorphic family god of the father or the monarchic warrior-king into the priestly Holy One, who like the holiness of the high priest would avoid sex and death; or, into the deuteronomistic corpus, God became the unseen Speaker of the heavenly word, now totally disembodied (a view also seen in Genesis l).49 Chaoskampf, the battle of the warrior-god over the divine foes, functioned no longer to proclaim royal power, as it had at Mari, Ugarit and monarchic Israel. In Israel, the newer versions of Chaos- kampf served as expressions of Kulturkämpfen , of cultural conflict of the priestly and deuteronomistic traditions asserted against royal tradition. It is true that it was a combination of priestly and deuteronomistic traditions that together textually overwhelmed the monarchic world- view. Signs of post-exilic compromise between deuteronomistic and priestly compromise appear as notes, for example within 1 Kings 6-7, thereby putting their spin on the Temple's purpose.50 For example, the priestly note of 1 Kings 6:13a especially with the root expresses the priestly notion of divine immanence in the Temple (wěšakantí bětok bene yiśrael; cf. Exod 25:8; 29:45; Num 5:3; 35:34). Juxtaposed to this priestly element is a combined deuteronomistic-priestly addition in 1 Kings 6:12b, which stresses keeping divine statutes and rules and commandments (cf. 1 Kgs 2:3; 9:6; 11:34; Lev 26:3). These little addi- tions are enveloped in the resumptive repetition (also called Wiederauf- nahme) of the phrase "he built the house" in w 12a and 14. That these are a late insertion is apparent by their absence from the Old Greek version. Thus taken together, the additions suggest a late post-exilic compromise in which the priestly view can live with the deuterono- mistic position as long as sacrificial cult and prestige remain. To sum- marize: where the Ugaritic corpus yielded a harmonization of viewpoint exerted by royal authority and maintained by the priestly elite sup- ported by the monarchy, the Israelite narrative works produced the victory of the deuteronomistic-priestly compromise over the older royal worldview. w M.

SMITH If we return momentarily to the external influences on the biblical corpus, these too will highlight a basic literary contrast with the Uga- ritic corpus. Ugarit and Israel share an important cultural similarity in their production of literature in vernaculars, a point brilliantly noted by Seth Sanders.51 As Sanders observes, it was in the context of the larger international hegemony of the Akkadian language in general and of literary texts in Akkadian (or Sumerian and Akkadian) in particular, that both Ugarit and Israel generated literary works in their own lan- guages. There is further a great and important difference within this similarity that Sanders does not address. At Ugarit, there is the develop- ment of Ugariťs own literature in its own language, while the classics of Mesopotamia are produced at Ugarit in their native language of Akka- dian. So there is a development of a vernacular at Ugarit, but there is no translation of Mesopotamian traditions into Ugaritic. In sharp contrast, the Bible shows not only the development of an indigenous literary corpus in the local language of Hebrew. It also shows a transia - tability of literary works into this vernacular. The Bible's authors took whatever they may have inherited of the Mesopotamian literary tradi- tion on their own terms, fashioning it as they saw fit. This difference may be correlated with the way deities and types or categories of divi- nity were handled across cultures, in what Jan Assman has called "translatability" of divinity.52 At Ugarit, local tradition correlated foreign deities with their own local deities, for example in god-lists. In the ancient Near East, correlation of deities in treaties and other forms was common practice. Israelite tradition as enshrined in the Bible, while translating Mesopotamian works into Israelite vernacular, often did not posit translatability of deity. Instead, biblical literature, even where it shows the operation of translating Mesopotamian classical tradition (or series of operations), renders divinity on its terms.53 In these cases, there 51 SANDERS, "What Was the Alphabet For? The Rise of Written Vernaculars and the Making of Israelite National Literature," Maarav 11/1 (2004) 25-56. 52 ĀSSMANN, Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism (Cam- bridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1997) 3, 28, 44-54. For the sort of rejection of trans- latability in Israelite religion, see the rather different views of R. S. HENDEL, Remembering Abraham: Culture , Memory , and History in the Hebrew Bible (Oxford/New York: Oxford Uni- versity, 2005) 4, 25; and M. S. SMITH, The Memoirs of God: History , Memory , and the Expe- rience of God in Ancient Israel (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2004) 113. Translatability of divinity was operative in non-priestly and non-deuteronomistic texts, however. See my forthcoming book, God in Translation: Cross-cultural Recognition of Deities in the Biblical World (tentative title; in preparation). 53 For an interesting discussion involving the well-known biblical transformation of the Mesopotamian flood tradition, see Moran, The Most Magic Word , 72-74.</page><page sequence="19">UGARITIC AND AKKADIAN BIBLICAL LITERATURE (II) 207 is no translatability of deity as found in the cases of ancient Near Eastern cultural transfer and exchange of deity discussed by Jan Assmann; at best, there is absorption (Yahweh as the repository of all positive divine character) and/or counterconstruction (Yahweh powerful beyond the empire gods who are in fact powerless). Translata- bility in such biblical texts is thus a form of inverse hegemony, whereby the dominant culture of Mesopotamia, its literary cultural contribution and its understandings of divinity are reduced and subordinated to fitting into Israelite visions of reality. In short, one dimension of the lite- rary brilliance of the Bible can be seen in part how it uses the traditions of the empire ruling over it in order to establish Israelite identity over and against it; in short, cultural victory, of both literary and religious sorts, in inverse relations to political realities. In this view of biblical narrative, Israelite literary traditions traveled a considerable cultural distance not only from their West Semitic ante- cedents, but went further through their refraction by the influence of Mesopotamian literary genres (chronicle, treaty/covenant and law- codes), and still further through their larger amalgamation in the long narratives now contained in Genesis through Kings. In this textual process, Israel's cultural memory went through several twists and turns.54 The Bible constituted more than the representations of collec- tive memory about cultural conflicts; it became the very site, the batt- lefield, for playing out cultural conflicts within Israel and against its larger world. 54 For a sketch in this direction with prior studies cited, see Smith, The Memoirs of God , 124-58.</page></plain_text>
