THIS paper is an attempt to define some of the issues raised by the " modernist " controversy which was at its height in the years 1907-19o9. The term " modernism," is here used not in the general sense in which it is applicable to all those who in each successive generation attempt to interpret Christianity to the mind of the age in which they live, but in the proper and technical sense according to which it denotes the attempt made in the opening years of the present century, by a group of Catholic thinkers of which the Frenchman Loisy and the Irishman Tyrrell were acknowledged leaders, to sever the link between History and Dogma by combining an affirmation of the spiritual and religious truth of the dogmas of the Historic Church, with the claim of free- dom to deny any or all of the alleged facts of history with which the said dogmas had hitherto been held to be implicated. Modernism was an attempt to succour a distressed orthodoxy: and the intellectual situation which it aspired to meet was one which was bound to arise so soon as the claim was conceded that methods of critical inquiry analogous to those employed in secular history should be applied equally to those documents and alleged facts A</page><page sequence="2">94 THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. which lie at the basis of the Christian tradition. It is not, indeed, that the documents in question are as a whole less trustworthy, or the alleged facts less well- supported, than is the case in other departments of his- torical investigation. It is rather that all history is more or less debateable ground: that individuals will always differ-sometimes widely, sometimes only in details-in their estimate of historical probabilities: that there is always a certain case for the historical sceptic: and that the attainment of demonstrative certainty with regard to alleged happenings in the past is in the nature of things impossible. Especially does the very desire to find a thing true operate in many of the best minds as a pre- disposition towards scepticism: for men do not desire, in that which concerns them nearly, to be self-deceived. The rationabile obsequium of faith is something wholly other than the credulity which suffers historical judge- ment to be over-ridden by the will to believe: and the just balance in such a matter is both difficult of attain- ment and incapable of verification when attained. It was inevitable, therefore, that the attempt to isolate the investigation of the early documents of Christianity as a purely historical problem, and to find a basis for religious faith in the results (however stoutly affirmed to be "assured ") of historical " science," should break down. The successive phases of opinion in the sphere of historical criticism are as transient and as kaleidoscopic as are the ever-changing hypotheses which from time to time are dominant (shall we say?) among physicists with regard to the consti- tution of matter. And in the meantime the religious man (as a recent writer voices his complaint) cannot afford to be dependent upon "a yearly statement from Dr. Sanday, comparable to the weather report, as to ' What we may still believe.' " Meanwhile the modern historico-critical attitude of mind had familiarized us all with a distinction, very commonly drawn, between fact and value, between events</page><page sequence="3">THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. 95 and their interpretation. The distinction in question is one which, if made absolute, is in the long run of very dubious validity from the point of view of the philo- sopher. In strictness it is impossible ever to isolate an event as bare fact: there are no " bare facts " of history, ascertainable as such. The element of valuation and interpretation is already present in some degree from the beginning-in the very selection of particular facts for investigation, in the isolation of them from their his- torical context as especiall$y significant or interesting. The very documents which form the historian's data are themselves already in some degree interpretations they are never bare statements, if only because they are never complete statements, of " what actually occurred." Moreover it is not true that the historian (for all his claim to be " scientific ") approaches his problem in indepen- dence of presuppositions. There is not, and there cannot be, such a thing as " impartial " history, in this sense of the words. A certain view of the universe, a particular mental furniture, a definite outlook, is presupposed by every historian who ever wrote. It is something which he brings with him to his work. It may be modified by what he finds there, but it certainly is not created by what he finds. Nevertheless it may be granted that it is not nonsense to speak with a certain relative validity of a distinction between fact and interpretation: and that in particular it is plausible to draw a certain distinction between the facts, real or alleged, which are at the basis of the Christian creed, and the interpretation which in that creed the Church is putting upon the facts. Will the facts bear the interpretation ? Or even if they will bear it, do they necessitate it ? The problem being considered from 'this point of view, there arose a certain parting of the ways. If, in regard to Christianity, the possibility of a distinction between fact and interpretation be once granted, it is obviously possible to concentrate attention either upon facts, dis-</page><page sequence="4">96 THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. carding as far as possible interpretations, or upon inter- pretations, discarding facts. The former method underlies the work of all writers of the modern school of Liberal Protestantism: the latter was the method of the Catholic modernists. Liberal Protestant writers, inheriting as a tradition from Ritschl the repudiation of religious metaphysics, are for the most part metaphysically agnostic. Their aim is to arrive, by a process of critical inquiry, at a positive and strictly " scientific " account of the life and career and teaching of the historical Jesus, and then to consider what significance the result-regarded as a purely human phenomenon-may possess for humanity at large. It is immediately obvious, indeed, that this procedure is not really to discard interpretations but to substitute a new interpretation, or set of interpretations, for the old. To suppose the contrary is on the one hand to conceive of history as a " science " in a sense in which it is illegitimate so to regard it, and on the other to degrade it to a mere investigation of phenomenal sequences, precluded by a rigorous metaphysical agnos- ticism from every attempt to determine causes or meanings. The writers of the Liberal school have, how- ever, shown themselves singularly deficient in any sense of the obligation to criticize the presuppositions of their own method: and the general upshot of their inquiry has been in minds of a certain temper pure scepticism, in natures already temperamentally religious a pietistic attitude towards life and towards the universe as a whole, determined, in ways which are seldom clearly defined, by an interest in, an admiration for, or in some cases even a virtual worship of, the historical figure of Jesus. It must be explicitly recognized that the Christ of the Synoptic Gospels is discovered in the actual lives of many Liberal Protestants to be invested with a religious value and function which goes beyond anything which is either explicable or justifiable in terms of Liberal Pro- testant doctrine--or lack of doctrine-with regard to</page><page sequence="5">THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. 97 Him. It remains true, however, that Liberal Protes- tantism, regarded as an intellectual system or position, is not Christianity, in any sense which the word has hitherto borne; inasmuch as in it the fundamental Christian dogmas are ruled out upon principle as inad- missible, and it is consequently impossible to interpret the story of Jesus as in the old sense a Gospel of the power and grace of God. In contradistinction to all this, Modernism proper sought, as aforesaid, to take precisely the opposite line. It professed a complete indifference-so far as any effect upon religion was concerned-towards historical criticism and all its works: it was ready to discard facts, or sup- posed facts, if need be; it was content to cling to interpretations. It made its appeal to Christian, and especially to Catholic, experience. Whatever might or might not be the truth as to the career and teaching, or even as to the existence, of the historical Jesus, the fact remained that human lives through a succession of generations had been moulded and touched to fine issues by the practice of Catholicism as a dogmatic and institu- tional system. Might there not be a truth of faith capable of maintaining itself in independence of so-called truths of fact? Did not the dogmas of the Christian creed represent in any case " values" of proven efficacy in the life of the human spirit, and was there any need to ask for anything more? The ablest statement of the modernist view of dogma is that given by Edouard Leroy in Dogme et Critique. The difficulties which lead perhaps a majority of the " intellectuals " of our day to reject the dogmatic creed of historical Christendom arise, thinks Leroy, mainly from the tendency to construe dogma in an intellectual sense, as a contribution to speculative knowledge. Consider, for example, the dogma " God is personal." To say nothing of the difficulties raised by the word " God," in what sense are we to understand the word " personal " ? To assert personality of God in the same</page><page sequence="6">98 THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. sense as we assert it of man is to be involved in an anthropomorphism which Catholics and agnostics are at one in repudiating. On the other hand if, asserting the personality of God, we explain that we mean by the term something quite incommensurable with the personality of man, the objection at once suggests itself, why then use the same word for two different things ? Analogous difficulties might be raised with reference to other dogmas of the Christian faith : nor is there any way of meeting them, until it is realized that they are dependent one and all upon a misconception of the true nature and function of dogma as such. Leroy then proceeds to expound his own proposed alternative view of dogma, in opposition to the intellec- tualist conception which he rejects as plainly wrong. He points out, in the first place, that dogma is from an intellectual point of view negative rather than positive in function. It does not so much determine positively what is true as exclude and condemn certain errors. As instances he selects the dogmas of the Real Presence and the Resurrection in addition to his own previous example, viz. :-the personality of God. The dogma that " God is personal " is to be regarded rather as negating the conception of God as impersonal or sub- personal, than as defining positively His nature. It gives us no new positive conception, still less does it guarantee the truth of any particular system of meta- physics: but it warns us that such and such forms of Pantheism are false and to be rejected. Similarly the dogma of the Real Presence is to be taken not as a positive theory of the manner or nature of the association of our Lord with the Eucharist, but as negating the doctrine of a real absence, and as stigma- tizing as inadequate the view that the consecrated Host is a mere figure or symbol of the Christ. The Resurrection as a dogma of faith is to be explained in the same way. It embodies no theory of the. mechanism of our Lord's rising or of the nature of</page><page sequence="7">THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. 99 His post-resurrection life. But it excludes such ideas as that death set limits to the action of Jesus upon things in this world. It means that Christ comes amongst us and lives amongst us still: and that, not in the sense in which a bygone thinker (for example) may be said to live on as a memory and an influence among subsequent generations, but in the sense that He is our literal con- temporary. In a word, death was not for Christ, what it is for the generality of mankind, a cessation of prac- tical activity among the living. Intellectually, then, the function of dogma is negative: it is the ruling out of certain positions as inadequate. But dogma has, of course, a positive function also: and this, according to Leroy, is not speculative but practical. " Dogma," he writes, " has above all a practical sig- nificance. It is a prescription d'ordre pratique." It is the formula of a rule of practical conduct. To illustrate once more by the same three examples :- (I). The dogma " God is personal " means "behave in your relations with God as you would in your rela- tions with a human person." (2). The dogma " Jesus is risen " means " be in rela. tion to Him as you would have been before His death, as you would be if confronted by a contemporary." (3). The dogma of the Real Presence means " act in relation to the Host as you would in relation to Christ Himself visibly present." And so on as regards the other dogmas of the Church. Thus far Leroy's position might appear to be simply a crude religious pragmatism: it is saved, however, from this implication by two very important provisos:- (I). Every dogmatic precept of the Church involves the implicit affirmation that Reality is objectively of such a character as in some real sense to justify as right and reasonable the conduct which the dogma prescribes: and (2). The acceptance of dogma as a rule of life must not exclude the religious duty of thought: and qua thinker</page><page sequence="8">100 THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. the Christian must aim at an intellectual synthesis of the values of his creed as determining the nature of Reality. Leroy's is by far the ablest, the least inadequate, the most carefully thought out of all the various forms of Catholic modernism. It is reached, moreover, not by way of an antithesis between dogma and history (he is not interested primarily in historical criticism or con- cerned to maintain historical negations) but by way of a positive analysis of the nature of dogma as such. He does not, with some of the extremer modernists, deny the connexion between the Christ of faith and the Jesus of history, but on the contrary implicitly affirms their identity. And in fact, if we consider it purely as a philosophy of the significance and function of dogma in the life of a churchman, the writer of this article is dis- posed personally to accept his view. It does not, how- ever, go to the root of the question of truth; it merely raises it and leaves it unanswered. " Dogma interpreted as a rule of conduct involves the implicit affirmation that ultimate Reality is such as to justify the conduct pre- scribed." Precisely: there the whole problem resides. How much or how little need those words imply ? Two comments may be made. (4). It is perfectly intelligible that one who is already a devout and practising Christian might continue to be such upon the basis of a very considerable agnosticism as to ultimate questions. It is intelligible, for example, that he might argue somewhat in this way :-" These practices of prayer and sacrament, and this dogmatic Catholic creed, have brought spiritual life and strength to me and to others in the past and can still do so in the future. I may be doubtful enough as to the alleged historical origins of my religion, and I may be unwilling to commit myself speculatively to Theism in any orthodox sense of the term : but I believe that there is a spiritual reality at the back of the world, and through these par- ticular creeds and forms and symbols-imperfect, crude and fumbling as I take them to be-I have found by</page><page sequence="9">THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. 10- experience that my finite spirit-so runs at least my dream-may hold communion with the Infinite." But (2) it is difficult to see how so agnostic a presen- tation could ever constitute an effective basis of mis- sionary propaganda, or indeed could be expected to make much of an appeal to anyone not already-as it were-within the Christian fold. It is a possible basis of religion for such as hold it: but it is surely an entirely different thing from the traditional Christian faith. And if we are to consider not the man of temperamental piety and natural virtue, but the man of strong temptations in the rough and tumble of life, it appears to me to be futile to expect the recommendation by another of a particular method of human approach to the Infinite as salutary and beneficial, to achieve moral miracles such as used to be effected by the doctrine of a real incarnation and atonement wherein God approached man. There is all the difference surely between religion advocated as a possible view of the universe and a helpful attitude to life, and religion proclaimed as the truth of God Himself and the very core of what life means : between Pantheism grown sentimental, and the Gospel of the living God. For Christianity has from the beginning been pro- claimed as a Gospel: and it may conduce to clearness if we attempt to summarize shortly the content of that Gospel, from the point of view not of the philosopher but of the plain man. In brief, then, Christianity has always started from the assumption of a living personal God, maker of heaven and earth, upon whom all things depend, and who is throughout the length and breadth of His creation ceaselessly operative and active. Man, made for communion with God, is asserted to be in a state of fallenness from such communion, the fault being con- sidered to lie not upon the side of God but on that of man. The result is a sense of spiritual dissatisfaction in man's life, a seeking after God that is perpetually frustrated by an inherent inability on man's part to</page><page sequence="10">102 THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. attain. And man is fain to set up for himself-as witness all heathen religions and religious philosophies -imagined divinities which are emphatically asserted by Christianity to be mere i'oXca--idols--not the real thingi: whether they be literal idols of wood and stone, or the hypostatized projections of man's own ideal, is by comparison of small account. Thus far an impasse, a problem of human need which no striving of the human spirit can of itself supply. Doubtless there are qualifications to be made-" God left not Himself without witness," and so forth-but speaking broadly, Christianity asserts an emphatic doc- trine of man's impotence to find God, as the very presupposition of its own essential Gospel of a definite historic act, manifestation, or advent, whereby God once for all found man. For if heathen religions are the religions of man's search for God, Christianity is the religion of God's search for man. It is asserted that in the definite his- toric person of Jesus Christ the Life once for all was manifested, revealed in suffering and triumphant through death and resurrection : that the Eternal Passion of selfless Love, which was at the very heart of God Himself, in the fulness of time came forth and took hold of the human race, in such wise as to make men,. in virtue of that adoption, sons of God; further, that that divine act, which we are to see in the incarnation, passion and resurrection of the Christ, is not merely an event of the remote past, but something for ever con- tinued and perpetuated in the Church, an unending process whereby Christ is daily born anew in human hearts and lives, gives Himself sacramentally to be their spiritual food and drink, inwardly transforms them into His likeness by the effectual dynamic of His communi- cated Spirit, and moulds them into realized oneness with His Person. Doubtless any alleged facts-and the Christian facts in particular in proportion to their transcendent importance</page><page sequence="11">THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. 108 -must if accepted have their implications for philosophy. But it is, emphatically, as a Gospel of fact rather than as a theory of metaphysics that this Christian message has historically been proclaimed. It implies indeed a doctrine of God, and of the relation of the Eternal to the process of events in time, which may and do suggest difficulties to the philosopher. It has been elaborated and sophis- ticated by theologians in ways which are not always either intellectually tenable or morally edifying. But its essential character as a simple and effectual Gospel for simple people has persisted unchanged through the centuries: and it has proved its power in the conversion of sinners and the reclamation of the degraded, has interpreted the issues of life and destiny for multitudes in many generations, and has borne fruits of ethical beauty and spiritual force of character in those whom we call its saints, which are consonant with the hypothesis of its truth, and are otherwise less easily to be explained. We have spbken of it as a Gospel of fact-the pro- clamation of certain events as true. It may be charac- terized still more precisely as a Gospel of act-the proclamation of an eternal act of God, wrought indeed in one sense at a definite time and place, and yet continued for all time as a perpetual dynamic power, a perpetual putting forth by God for man's salvation of a transform- ing spiritual energy-" My Father worketh hitherto, and I work." The initiative, the energy, the power and activity which underlies the phenomenon of Christianity is proclaimed as God's act throughout. Man's part is but to yield himself, to correspond and not to resist: and even so, the process, for example (so it is asserted), by which a man comes to Christ is not his act but God's -" no man cometh, except the Father draw him ": it is something which is wholly the gift of God-" not of works, lest any man should glory." The French Catholic writer, Laberthonniere, in his book Christian Realism and Greek Idealism, draws out very suggestively the contrast in this respect between</page><page sequence="12">104 THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. the view of the world which is characteristic of Greek philosophy and that which is implied in Christianity. The former tends always towards a static conception of the universe, in which (abstraction being made from the individuality of concrete particulars in the world of time and change) Reality is envisaged as a hierarchy of ideas coheriag logically in the ultimate unity of a single Supreme Idea or Absolute, indifferently to be described as God or Nature, but in any case something fixed, final, determined: an eternal, impersonal, changeless Fact. In contrast with this the Christian world-view is dynamic, concrete, individual. In the actual world no one existence is ever the merely logical consequence of another, because no two particulars are ever identical. Christianity, instead of making abstraction from the individuality of particulars, seeks to take account of their actual character as concretely presented in experience, by conceiving them positively as products of the Divine activity. God is conceived no longer as merely a supreme Idea, but as a supreme Personal Being, alive and active-" un Dieu-personne qui est une puissance d'agir "-" a God-person who is potential activity." So far from being an idea or an essence reposing statically in an eternal calm, the God of Chris- tianity is rather the ceaseless activity of an eternal life: a life moreover which is not merely intrinsic to the Divine Being but is for ever putting itself forth as a creative energy which constitutes and sustains a world other than God, though a world which apart from God could not exist. It follows that God is present to the world not merely as ideal, exemplar and final cause: He is present actively and really as an efficient cause, cease- lessly co-operant in all events. His activity is a transcendent reality which penetrates the world and becomes immanent therein, determining its course, its nature, its destiny: assuming consequently the form of events in time, and becoming an integral factor in the history of mankind and in the lives of individual men.</page><page sequence="13">THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. 105 The history of the world and of man is from this point of view, in part at least, a history of God's action : and the knowledge of God must consequently be sought not in the abstract contemplation of Him as an idea or principle, but concretely through His self-revelation in history, and pre-eminently (according to Christian teaching) in those alleged facts, or rather acts of God, which underlie the Christian tradition and form the content of its creed. Christianity, therefore, in so far as it is doctrinal, is not an abstract doctrine, not a view of the world, such as was the ideal of the Greeks, and is the ideal of the pure philosopher to-day: it is an apprehension of the inner significance of certain events past and present in which God is pre-eminently operative and active. In brief, it tells how God came and how God comes to man. To distinguish with the modernist between fact and interpretation, between history and dogma, is from this point of view illegitimate. It is, in effect, to Hellenize the Gospel: it is to view it as a Greek philo- sopher might view it-as something to be contemplated and analysed from outside. An act, in contradistinction to a fact, is properly apprehensible and intelligible only from within. Its meaning, purpose and value are intrinsic; they belong to its essential character qud act; they are a part of what it is, and if abstraction be made from them the act itself is imperfectly apprehended: they are by no means to be regarded as values read into " what really happened " by external observers after the event: they are and constitute " what really happened." Assuming that Laberthonnidre has correctly formu- lated the essential Christian position it is immediately obvious that a Gospel so conceived cannot possibly be independent of all imaginable conclusions either of his- torical science on the one hand or of philosophical speculation on the other. Philosophically, for example, it will be in conflict with any metaphysical school which</page><page sequence="14">106 THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. is unable to concede the validity of its implied concep- tion of God: while on the side of history, though not indeed necessitating a priori any particulat order of events, or prescribing beforehand to historical criticism the conclusions at which it shall arrive as to the external character and phenomenal sequence of the occurrences which presumably uhderlie the Gospel stories, it is-yet inconsistent with the acceptance of any such reconstruc- tion of the external order of events as would render inadmissible their interpretation as from within in terms of the doctrine that " God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself." Many questions may indeed be left open and regarded as fairly debate- able: such questions, for example, as the duration of our Lord's public ministry, whether it lasted for several years or only for a few months: questions with regard to specific events in the ministry, whether for example He did or did not heal this or that sick person, feed 5,000, or walk on the water : or even--a profounder issue, and one much debated in theological circles of late- what it felt like to be Messiah, and how much our Lord knew about it at the time: but whatever answer or. answers be given to questions such as these, the main- tenance of the validity of the traditional Gospel does appear to involve the assertion that to interpret the history otherwise than as an act of God in Christ for man's salvation is to miss the inner truth of what in point of fact occurred. Now, that what is called Christian experience is con- sonant with, explains, and is explained by, such a theology as I have suggested will hardly be denied. Bearing in mind Laberthonnibre's contrast between the Christian and the Greek conceptions, we may remind ourselves that the history of the thought of Europe since the Renaissance has been predominantly a history of Hellenic conquest-especially in philosophy-and of the rise of natural science and scientific method. Orthodox Christian doctrine has in consequence found itself</page><page sequence="15">THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. 107 threatened upon both its vulnerable sides-both by the widespread vogue of metaphysical theories inconsistent with its idea of God, and by the supposed conclusions of historical science affecting to dissolve away into myth and legend its basis of reputed fact. It was indeed out of such a tension (not to say conflict) between Christian theology upon the one hand and secular thought and science upon the other, that the phenomenon of Modernism, such as this paper has discussed it, arose. It arose as an attempt, at a time when the Philistines appeared to be laying profane hands upon the ark of God, to remove it out of their reach. Enough, it may be hoped, has been said to make clear both the sense in which the modernist apologetic is of value and also the point at which it would appear to break down. On the one hand it is possible to accept Leroy's interpretation of the nature of dogma, and to agree with the modernists in taking the proven efficacy of Chris- tianity in the spiritual experience of the Church as the starting-point of any argument with regard to its truth. On the other hand it does not appear that the divorce of dogma from history can be made absolute, in the manner in which the modernists desired. Christianity is, and must incorrigibly remain, an historical religion. That has unquestionably been its character from the beginning: and apart from the fundamental concep- tions of the revelation of God in and through history, the self-manifestation of God in Christ as operative and active for man's salvation, and the continuance of the work of Christ thrbugh the Spirit in the Church, Christianity changes its character, and becomes some- thing quite other than itself. We may take the efficacy of Christianity and the witness of Christian experience as our starting-point: but as we pursue the argument, we shall be driven either to asperse the validity of that experience and to deny that it is what it appears and claims to be, or else to affirm the truth of the Gospel, at once historical and dogmatic, as its only sufficient</page><page sequence="16">108 THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOGMA AND HISTORY. ground and explanation. As I have already put it, we must be able to affirm that as a simple matter of actual fact God was and is in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself. To say this is not to render unnecessary or illegitimate the process of Biblical criticism : neither is it to prejudge in detail its results. Our faith, it has been recently remarked, is dependent neither upon the credibility of Judges nor upon the edibility of Jonah. I would add that it is dependent neither upon the authorship of " Q " nor upon the historical character of the Fourth Gospel. When once the belief in an historic incarnation is granted, the attempt to investigate, to understand, and to interpret the actual facts as to the form and manner of it at once becomes important: and (for all those who by education and training are capable of undertaking it) it is a religious duty and privilege. Here is at once the justification and the value of the whole process of modern historical criticism as applied to the Gospels, and of the successive attempts which have been made to reconstruct and to interpret the portrait of the actual historical Jesus. Apart from such a belief, on the other hand, the investi- gation of Christian origins becomes simply a highly technical department of archaeology, which can be of interest only to specialists. But it is important in either case to recognize the limitations of the historical method: and if the portrait of the Christ as provisionally reconstructed by the critics should in any given case prove such as to be incapable of interpretation in terms of Christian dogma, then clearly we should be face to face with the choice between abandoning the Gospel, or modifying the presupposi- tions of our criticism.
