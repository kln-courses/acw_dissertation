<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rational Choice Theory William J. Goode I first encountered rational choice theory just sixty years ago, when I was forced to listen to stupefyingly dull lectures in economics, which explained exactly how everything works out for the good of everyone, while outside the classroom the longest and most severe depression of this century was unfolding. At that time, I laughed bitterly and incredulously at the glaring contradictions between this Panglossian theology and the harsh economic reality we were experiencing, and I could not then and I cannot now understand that reluctance to transform the theory so as to fit common observation somewhat better. I have continued to be puzzled, and often exasperated, by this curious gap in a field whose members pride themselves on their tough-mindedness. I have discussed it with several Nobel prize winners in economics, and many times with sociologists who had good training in the field but were strong critics of it. I myself have offered several criticisms of rational choice theory in several articles (including those on a theory of role strain and exchange, as well as in books) and I am also doubtless guilty of making some small contributions to that theory. Thus, even though I recognize that no one can now encompass all the work in this general area, my comments are at least based on a long period of serious study.1 As a way of clarifying the larger issues, I shall present several paradoxes. The first of these challenges is that sociologists by and large say they reject rational choice theory. A respected mainstream analyst of (rational) corporate bureau cratic behavior exclaimed, "Why are you associating with those people?" Soci ology lectures commonly include derogatory remarks about rational choice theory, especially in economics. This is not new; it was common fifty years ago as well. As with many sociologists, my negative comments about it, throughout my ca reer, far outnumbered the positive. What is different now is that an organization officially exists within our field whose aim it is to explore and develop this theory. Also, on the other side of the intellectual wall, there is some movement in economics as well: there is William J. Goode is a Research Associate in the Sociology Department at George Mason University and Professor Emeritus of sociology at Stanford University. Address correspon dence to: William J. Goode, Department of Sociology, George Mason University, 4400 Univer sity Drive, Fairfax, Virginia 22030-4444. 22 The American Sociologist/Summer 1997</page><page sequence="2">even an association of empirical economics, actually pledged to test parts of the theory. Aside from its real deficiencies in practice, rational choice theory: 1) has suffered from a bad press; 2) it is not guilty of all the sins ascribed to it; and 3) whatever its sins, almost everyone engages in it. As with many sociologists, my own negative comments about it, far outnumbered the positive. Thus, the real ization came very late to me that my own theorizing, reaching though it did into half a dozen subfields (e.g., primitive religion, industrial sociology and the pro fessions, marriage markets and the dynamics of divorce at both micro and macro levels, prestige processes, force, force-threat, and power), was based on rational choice theory, too. Why then do so many of us employ rational choice theory at some level, while explicitly rejecting it as an overall exploratory approach? The answer requires, unfortunately, a long exposition. Seeking that answer does however lead to a reward: we are then led to a new view of rational choice theory. I hope you will bear with me through this long and complex exposition; otherwise you will not be persuaded. In its course, we shall clarify some related issues and affirm additional paradoxes. Understanding the second half of our paradox (that most sociologists use rational theory regardless of their stated antipathy to it) requires an epistemo logical excursus and taking note of a central theory about cognition. In Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason the great philosopher made the seemingly ob vious statement that, despite philosophical skepticism, physical science was firmly based, and it was advancing. However, Kant offered the startling argument in its defense that its ultimate epistemological or methodological foundation is our mode of thinking: we simply cannot think rationally at all about physical phe nomena, except within a structure of received categories or parameters, which confines and organizes all of our apparently objective, empirical reasoning and observation. We perceive, or think, within the categories of space, time, causa tion, and so on, and we shall never get outside those framing ideas.2 You will surely recognize that statement as a powerful modern?or "postmodern"?in sight. It is, of course, an early adumbration of the much later discovery by Godel, that no set of rules can be made for any mathematics that will allow it to be both consistent and fruitful (in simpler language, we cannot get outside the system); or the discovery by our own ethnomethodolog?sts, that no set of rules can be written to direct mathematicians in their steps to "prove" a mathematical theo rem or how to proceed in the work of scientific discovery and proof.3 Indeed, Garfinkel's essential finding is that scientific or mathematical research, quite like rational choice or everyday action, cannot create its own codifications that will transcend and fully explain what the actors are really doing.4 Parallel to these notions that we cannot get outside our own cognitive sys tem?but offering a different hypothesis?I am now asserting that we make causal and rational choice hypotheses because we find it difficult to get outside it and think any other way. Based on the lengthy array of evidence that I shall Goode 23</page><page sequence="3">present for this claim, I shall offer an additional thesis, almost as startling as this one: Because some version of the Kantian, Godelian, or Garfinkel hypothesis is valid, the rational choice claim is essentially untestable (like Kant's categories), because we cannot easily conceive of any alternative "outside" interpretation, and we cannot prove that any such alternative is empirically provable, either. In line with that first epistemological hypothesis, I shall make the surely surprising assertion that it is nearly impossible for us to develop a body of social action theory that is not ultimately and fundamentally a rational choice theory. Even when we begin with the obvious, nearly banal, claim that human beings are irrational in part and nonrational in large part, we persist in moving from that presumably empirical claim toward some frame of rational choice process, usually by searching for another level of order and choice within which those nonrational processes will again make sense to us. And we do it nearly universally. Doubtless, fifty years hence, if there is still a field of sociology, we shall still be doing it. It is so ubiquitous in our thinking that I am willing to assert the additional, powerful hypothesis, that this mode of reasoning is hard-wired into our cognitive processes. We have almost no alter native guesses about why people carry out any action. It is so deeply inherent in our thinking that we apply it to processes and things that are not even conscious. I shall demonstrate this assertion shortly by adducing some neat examples. But first let me offer another challenging paradox: When we criticize the basic economic module for its frequent failure to include other forces, which in fact, in real life observation, do shift action away from the maximization of money, then two consequences follow, the first of them trivial. The first is that because the number of variables must then increase, our measurement problems and equations also become more complex. The second is more fundamental. Our formulation aims at predicting behavioral patterns, and as soon as our nar row list of one variable?that is, money?fails to predict correctly we must look about for another, and yet another: That is, we can assert it is not money that the actor maximizes, but actually prestige, or friendship, or time or energy, or fun on the tennis courts, or whatever.5 For instance, Casanova tells us that early in his youth he decided that ambitious men like himself sought fame, fortune, and power. However, he knew men wanted those things only to gain the love of women, and thus his own program would be straightforward: Why not, then, bypass those arduous roads to the real goal, and seek that love directly? Surely he was wiser than the pure economists like Gary Becker, who make the pursuit of money the heart of all other activities. Often that new, nonmonetary variable will solve the immediate problem of prediction, and if it is strong enough we can use it to make a better formulation for the next phase of the inquiry. Achieving a more robust answer at that stage does not, however, prove the validity of our grand, underlying rational choice theory, for we simply continue to assume its truth when we look for and find an alternative driving variable: that is, we now say, that act was done for rational purposes just the same, for the goal was to get more of the new variable, X, i.e., 24 The American Sociologist/Summer 1997</page><page sequence="4">more prestige or respect, or more love, more fun on the tennis courts, or whatever. For example, Etzioni offers the sensible proposal that a mono-utility theory is too parsimonious, and that at a minimum we should accept what we seem to observe in most social life: People also seek another good, moral utility, by conforming with a rule they feel is right, just, or ethical.6 Even if that helps in understanding social action, it is no proof that the broad theory is correct. We do not, then, simply accept rational choice theory, even when we use it. We ourselves impose it on any observation of action, whether human or animal, or for that matter even vegetable. Most people who observe a group of sales people find it difficult to suppose that the goal of their action is to harm them selves, or that the activities are merely random or chaotic. Indeed, if we observe what seems to us to be chaotic behavior, whether among human beings under stress or among cells being attacked by a virus, we are likely to call it some kind of pathology?and then seek its rationale. But, since most readers will be reluctant to agree with this set of paradoxes and challenges so flatly and laconically presented (and there will be more), some summary of evidence about this mode of analysis is in order. Let us review the ways that various intellectual disciplines rely on it: 1. First consider the wide range of psychodynamics, which forthrightly accepts that much of human behavior is irrational or nonrational, for that is its subject matter. However, as all of you know, its various practitioners, from Freud to the modern behavioral therapists, seek order just the same.7 They do so by finding a deeper set of rational patterns and processes, which are really choices aimed at more comfort able short-term results, however destructive they seem to the outside observer. Thus, our neurotic, psychosomatic responses are ways of diverting the conscious mind from confronting some even more hurtful unconscious impulses. A seemingly irrational anorexia is really a fear of the dangers of mature sexuality. Clearly, self destructive rages against one's boss can be seen as an expression of father-hostility that the person was unable to show while ho was a young child. And so on. In ordinary gossip, most of us occasionally analyze our friends in the same way. We observe objectively foolish, unwise, or irrational behavior and "explain" it by reference to our guesses about an underlying orderliness?specifically, that he or she is really making choices of what is easier, more pleasurable, moral, esthetic, or more comfortable in the short run. The psychotherapist tells us, you think you are doing X, but since your actions do not move toward your supposed goal and you keep on doing X, you must be aiming at something else. 2. In our own field, whatever our philosophical distaste for rational choice theory, it is a fact that most of our analyses assume that the people in our sample do act "rationally," both at the macro and the micro levels. The poor are more likely than the rich to vote Democratic because it is in their interest; corporate heads try to expand sales and profit, and also take steps to increase their prestige; organizations make alliances in order to gain added resources of money, or power, or prestige; nations do the same?as industrialization spreads in a nation, family elders lose some authority, because they can no longer control the life opportunities of their members as much as they once did, and thus these members find better, nontradi tional choices. And so on. On the other hand,sociologists use a wide array of formal and informal variables Goode 25</page><page sequence="5">to describe what people are doing or believe they are doing. We recognize that people work for money, but also report that they work for a large number of other goals as well, such as respect, acceptance in a religious community, or obedience to tradition. They seek moral and religious utility, and not dollars alone. If people we observe do not seem to maximize their financial incomes, we do not label that "irrational." The sociological tradition has long taken for granted that people and groups spend much of their time, energy, and money trying to gain these other goals as best they can within the knowledge, beliefs, and values that are part of their daily lives. That is, we consistently report that they are trying to be as sensible as possible in gaining these various nonmonetary goals. 3. Since at least part of the political science territory includes the processes of power accumulation and allocation, it is not surprising that many of its practitioners have begun to utilize rational choice theory. Coughlin asserts that it has had more im pact in this field than in any other (aside from economics, of course).8 Power, by most definitions, is more difficult to measure than money, but either can be cast into rational utility equations. However, those who proclaim the power of the new intellectual tools in politi cal science processes, as well as those who rail against them, miss the central historical point. In the relatively modern world, from Hobbes onward, analysts in this field have (consciously or not) taken for granted that actors, whether nations, political movements, parties, or people, do seek their own interest in ways they seem to believe are as reasonable as possible, within the normal restraints of ap parent reality. The obvious madness of war as well as the self-destructive steps of a Louis XVI are seen and analyzed within a framework of goal-seeking, i.e., weigh ing goals, paths, and alternative moral or esthetic values in as sensible a manner as possible. When we read such analyses, we are not even conscious of this underly ing assumption, for it seems self-evident. Long before the new barbarians of ratio nal choice theory came to the gates, then, political scientists were following that mode of thought, albeit without the equations. 4. Mainstream economics is the only social science field that proudly proclaims its full allegiance to rational choice theory in its basic textbooks. Institutional, develop mental, and historical economists have, by contrast, waged a generations-long, some times acrimonious, campaign to correct the assumptions and conclusions that reign in the dominant, more formalistic part of the field. Those practitioners have suf fered the accusation that they are not "real economists." In their critiques of the dominant mode of thought, they have charged that important variables were being omitted: 1) increasing political power did influence the rising wages of workers during the nineteenth century, whatever the weight of the famous " invisible hand" in its grasping after financial gain; 2) economic transactions are not set only by supply and demand, but also by the continuing sociopolitical relations of the par ticipants; 3) people and political units seek prestige and power, honor and family influence, not material goods alone. Nevertheless, even these variations from stan dard economics also interpret this much richer set of socioeconomic processes by supposing people and organizations are trying to make sensible choices that will be to their advantage?again, whether measured by money or religious purity. By now you can see that, in trying to answer the question?Why do human beings act like that??most analysts of human behavior look for and find order and pattern. These are generated, we are told, because people or organizations want X more, or Y less, or both, and choose what they judge to be the more intelligent, 26 The American Sociologist/Summer 1997</page><page sequence="6">moral, or esthetic steps toward that goal. To be sure, many people may not be as wise as you or I hope they would be, and they may spend only modest amounts of energy and time on gathering information or on calculation. But, only a few purists in rational choice theory have postulated the perfectly "rational" decision maker as the normal actor. People may be doing the best they can even when they are hardly conscious that they are weighing alternatives; probably, most of our small decisions are of that kind. Amos Tversky has told me, for example, that sometimes he asks economists whether the members of their families are "rational" even in their everyday economic decisions, and their answer is uniformly negative, even intensely so. 5. In fact, this general view?that people are usually trying as best they can to be sensible or effective in aiming at a wide variety of goals?is so much an assumption within human thinking that it is built into our observations of behavior even when that behavior is almost certainly not conscious, not imposed by language or culture, that is, among animals and even plants. Currently, sociobiologists have selected a kind of "as if" theory of mating choices among animals, of competition for space and food, or indeed of any behavior. That is, we are told that the best way of interpreting biological diversity, evolutionary change, and survival is to say that the animal is "acting as though" it is making a rational choice in choosing habitats, maximizing the number of its offspring, mini mizing the threats from predators or from other members of the same species, the stability of its sexual relationships, the paths it makes while walking through the forest, the care of its young?indeed, almost any of its behaviors can, we are told, be so interpreted. The so-called theory can explain almost anything the animal?or, for that matter, any plant?will do. If swans choose to mate for life, it is because that social pattern maximizes the number of survivors who carry their specific genes; if other birds? sometimes both males and females?instead try to mate with as many others as possible, the goal is the same, and the driving force is the same, that is, rational choice.9 As a lifelong aficionado of such studies and such biological processes, I am not making fun of this view. Whatever its excesses, it yields fascinating hypoth eses and findings. I am rather focusing intently only on my main theme at this stage?the pervasive, recurrent use of this view in most attempts to understand any behavior. As in the social sciences, it is likely to be applied even when the author rejects "rationality" as a factor in these areas of behavior. Darwin did it, too, in his amusing explanation of why honey is so abundant where there are many spinsters. His reasoning was thus: The spinsters keep cats; the cats eat the field mice, who otherwise would consume the bumblebees; who thus expand in numbers to fertilize the clover more completely?and, we may suppose, all that ultimately feeds the real bees and thus yields more honey for the spinsters' breakfast table. The regularities of each pattern of behavior are explained by showing how each of these animals pursues its own goals. (This account, re peated frequently, may be apocryphal, but it is true to both Darwin's reasoning and to that of the field.) There is an interesting contradiction among those who use this logic. On the one hand, for many generations, natural historians, experimental animal psy Goode 27</page><page sequence="7">chologists, ethologists, evolutionary theorists, and their colleagues have warned the reader against anthropomorphism?i.e., supposing animals think like us, are fully engaged in rational thought and planning, and perhaps are even coopera tive and self-sacrificing. On the other hand, they have also warned against the opposite belief, i.e., that animals are just a set of automatic, reflexive, instinc tual, biologically wired organisms, a sort of biological machine. Very often, both of these warnings come from the same people. Whichever stance is taken, inter pretations of real animal behavior in the wild and in the laboratory continue to follow the same pattern of thought we have described: Conscious or not, genu ine choices or reflexive actions, what the animal does is to the animal's interest, given its range of available choices. In the field of paleontology and ecology, the evolution of species and subspecies is also explained by this handy little cogni tive tool. No one seriously claims that genes or animals actually plot and plan as best they can?they only seem to do so?and certainly Darwin's mice and bumble bees did not, but no one will still be surprised by the notion of the self-seeking gene.10 That view asserts that we can best explain "gene behavior," i.e., the animal's actions as determined by genes, if we ask what it would do if it were acting in its own best interest. Thus, if a gene is "smart," it will direct its organism to save a brother or sister, rather than a cousin, and a stranger not at all. The selfish gene theory has been widely attacked, but its seductiveness as a mode of thought does not weaken. We have recently learned, for example (NYT, June 28,1994, pp.C-1,3) that those billions of noncoding bases in our genes, which have been called "junk" because they do not seem to tell the organism to do much of anything in particular, must be important, because they are still there, after millions of years of evolution: they would not be there if they did not serve the interest of the genes, the chromosomes, the organism, and thus the species. No one actually supposes that organisms (or genes) give a moment's thought to preserving the species, but when analyzing animal behavior, the biologist points out that, in fact, the choices made do just that, as though they are making "rational" decisions. Indeed, in biology generally, if the processes and organisms do not seem to behave in this fashion, that turn of events is labeled a pathology, and the next step is simply to discover the underlying regularities of that pathology, i.e., how the cells or viruses or pathogens promote their own welfare, sometimes, for example, creating a local environment in which they can flourish without killing the supporting host. We may suppose, and even proclaim, that in cells or plants the activity is simply the outcome of biochemical processes, and in animals the outcome of instincts and learning. And to be very cautious, we are told not to label it as "rational" or "choice." Nevertheless, the pattern of thought is nearly identical: we start, and usually finish, with the idea?which we experience as observa tion, not hypothesis?that the activity is goal-oriented (e.g., heliocentric, geo centric, water-seeking) and the goal is to increase a gain of some kind, or to decrease an alternative loss. 28 The American Sociologist/Summer 1997</page><page sequence="8">We may try to justify that large supposition or mode of thought by pointing out that organisms (human, animal, plant) that fail to be goal-oriented will re duce their chances of survival. However, we do not need that justification. In fact, I believe that this way of thinking is quite ancient. It is rooted in the observations made by early human beings about other human beings and about animal behavior. It is deeply embedded in magical and religious ideas as well. I have no doubt at all that two hundred thousand years ago, when our ancestors tried to understand any organic process or phenomenon, they imputed initia tive, reaction, goals, capacities, even calculation to them. Doubtless, they used magic and theology to explain some physical processes that we now explain scientifically. However, when we look at organic and human processes we con tinue to use a similar mode of thinking, and its simplest label is rational choice theory. Even a modest familiarity with these fields or subfields in this brief and el ementary survey attests to the general pattern I am describing. Thus, my seem ingly radical thesis, that this mode of interpretation is really the only one we possess, and may even be hardwired into our cognitive processes, no longer seems so daring. We can state this in a nearly formal heuristic way: Ordinarily, sociologists begin with behavior whose aims or goals seem to be clear enough, and we try to find out which variables explain most of its variance. However, if those variables fail to predict adequately, if for example people choose con sistently to act in ways that lower the likelihood they will achieve what they claim is their material, moral, or esthetic goal, we do not suppose that those people are irrational. Instead, we look at them more closely to locate the "un derlying rationality" of what they are really seeking. Sociologists have typically done this in their analyses of, say, praying for rain, lower class support for Tory parties, the destruction of goods in the potlatch, or denunciations of witchcraft or sin. Researchers follow this mode of thinking whether they espouse rational choice theory, or instead oppose it strenuously. Analyses of this general approach must focus on some of the most important, and therefore perennial, issues in the+ large question of whether and how a science of society can be built. Necessarily, then, our debates sometimes be come a bit strident. The central topic of Talcott Parsons's The Structure of Social Action can be seen as the place of rational action in the actions of individuals and societies. In his preface to a re-issue of that book, thirty years after its publication, Parsons argued that the book had stayed alive so long because its main subject, the boundaries and limitations of economic theory, was so relevant to modern concerns, specifically capitalism in its relations with a wide variety of major political movements.11 Now, nearly thirty years after his comment, we still wrestle with that large question, the place of rational action in a science of society. As in most sociological debate about fundamental issues, now and in the past, attacks and counter-arguments miss their mark because neither side will even attempt to agree with the other on what the basic traits are or on doctrines of the intellectual "school" being debated. If Denzin's list of the main tenets of Goode 29</page><page sequence="9">rational choice theory (drawn heavily from Garfinkel)12 is correct, then people who believe all of them are surely fools, who must be paying only little attention to real life behavior. In a more sensible world, those who attack any set of doctrines would be required to quote or cite the specific words of the defenders, to prove that they really do believe those doctrines. Unfortunately, sociological debates have rarely been that finicky. I have yet to find, e.g., any extensive attack on functionalism that proves by specific citations that the doctrines ascribed to it were ever actually proclaimed by any group of living sociologists. Nor have I ever seen a defense written by a self-confessed functionalism theorist who agreed that those were indeed the core doctrines of his or her own version of functionalism.13 As long as attackers and defenders of any school of thought can or will not agree on what constitutes its basic ideas, debate is not likely to clarify our thinking. Thus, I take for granted?having often observed it?that one may utilize rational choice theory in one's concrete analyses while attacking it as a doctrine, just as many anti-functionalists used functionalism in their real life analyses of social behavior. Main Charges against Rational Choice Theory Still, that is where and what we are as a field. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to take note of a few of the basic accusations against rational choice theory. Perhaps the four most common are: 1) It is really post-dictive, not predictive; that is, only after the action has taken place can we point to its causal elements and forces; when used carelessly, its logical framework can look remarkably like a tautology; 2) it postulates that people try to maximize only material goods or money; 3) it focuses on individual action, and leaves ambiguous the origins or forces that create macro structures and processes; and 4) it postulates a kind of pure rationality that is not common in real life, where we encounter muddle, shifts in decisions because of minor distractions or whims, actions contrary to common sense, and so on. Let us consider them briefly. I The assertion that people's behavior can be explained by their choices among better or worse alternatives is a prediction claim. However, critics argue that, no matter what the person or the group does, however erroneous the prediction, the analyst tries to show afterwards that the goal was to increase some good, or to avoid something bad, or some combination of the two. If, for example, the analyst predicts that people will rationally maximize their monetary outcome, it is easy to locate dozens of behaviors that seem to contradict that prediction. But then the analyst (or some of them) can show that what seems to be "nonrational" might nevertheless be interpreted as increasing the actor's goods. Thus, though she donated money to a philanthropy, we can argue that she thereby increased her social prestige, making an investment that will later earn her more money. 30 The American Sociologist/Summer 1997</page><page sequence="10">He bought a painting for esthetic pleasure, but the analyst states that he was really making a financial investment. A cousin risks her life to save a child, but that is simply a way of increasing the survival chances of her own genes, and so on. When analysts engage in this kind of assertion, they reveal inadvertently, in economics as in sociology, that their version of the theory is not falsifiable. They have removed from their logic of proof a necessary element in any statement about the real world: it must be possible to disprove it, but that is not possible if we are permitted to go back and point to a variable that was not explicitly in the research design at the outset. A more obvious form of this gap or failure is found in the unconscious tau tologies that occasionally creep into rational choice theory, not only in econom ics (supply [at the market price] equals demand [at the market price]), but also in sociology. These are by definition incapable of disproof. We are much indebted to George Homans for his excellent research, and thus choosing examples from his work merely reminds us that the best will some times nod. His attempt to reduce any good analysis to Skinnerian behavioral psychology?his odd label for rational choice theory?seems now and then to be ineffective, or even silly, when it stumbles into tautology. James Rule notes one embarrassing case of Homans's tautologies: William the Conqueror did not try to conquer Scotland because that conquest was not valuable to him. Proof? If it had been, he would have tried to do it. Since he did not, Scotland must not have been valuable to him.14 Another is Homans's view of distributive justice as an outcome of exchange, which was widely hailed three decades ago (more than two thousand years after its introduction). He asserted everyone agrees that people who are equal in social rank and other important attributes should be rewarded equally. Carefully examined, this formulation can be shown to be another near tautology. For that reason, it seems intellectually seductive. As I noted some time ago, it becomes a comically perverse rule of logic: People who are the same in all ways should get the same rewards; if they do not, then they must not have been the same? so we look for another difference, which we had not noticed before.15 These examples are instructive, for Homans falls into these errors when he thinks he is "proving" rational choice theory. By contrast, in normal sociological analysis, as in real life, we do not try to "prove" that theory, but instead we make dozens of robust predictions about social behavior: At a minimum, we report, under specified conditions, that this or that correlation or behavioral pattern will be observable. Even when we are using rational choice theory, we are not in fact trying to prove it. It is only that endeavor (i.e., proving it) which is likely to be "postdictive," nonfalsifiable, or tautological. However, aside from such attempts at "proving" rational choice theory, it is not clear whether sociologists who attack it, or those who defend it, are more prone to such errors. As it is normally used, as I insist by almost everyone, it is not a theory at all. It is only a theoretical orientation. Its basic notions make a handy tool that directs our search for strong variables. Looking for the robust Goode 31</page><page sequence="11">variables that shape behavior is, after all, our job, and almost all of them will be viewed by actors as more or less desirable/undesirable. It is especially useful to us as an orientation when our subjects seem to carry out behaviors that simply do not produce what they claim are their goals, e.g., making rain, proclaiming and executing a war on drugs, executing witches to expunge evil, purchasing lottery tickets, or simultaneously proposing tax reductions and adding costly social or military programs. Such disparities are likely to move us toward a deeper search for the goals that human beings are really seeking. At present, most of our theoretical errors in talking about rational choice theory occur when we try either to demonstrate it, or disprove it. We flounder when we give it substantive prominence, as though it were a real theory, instead of focusing on our real life variables. As a theoretical orientation, by contrast, it is not at all incompatible with such traditional variables as group cohesion, commitment to a radical religious group, socioeconomic rank, or group resources. Then we simply find out how much variance they control in some outcome, and we do not worry much about whether rational choice theory is being proved once more.16 When we use that theoretical orientation, rather than trying to prove it, we illustrate once again my broad large assertion (that we sociologists do not really treat it as a theory or hypothesis to be proved): we never find a causal factor, and then triumphantly announce, "See! rational choice theory is vindicated once more." When we are careless, we may do what the economist McCloskey asserts his own colleagues do: "...an economist is an expert who can tell you tomorrow why the thing he predicted yesterday didn't happen today"17 If it does not work well, sociologists do not, on the other hand, announce, "See! Rational choice theory is wrong." Instead, we look for a more powerful variable, for at bottom we do truly believe that people are trying to get what they want, as sensibly as they can. Moreover, we may also sense that proving this is wrong may not be possible. II The accusation that rational choice theorists actually believe or postulate, that most people are simply trying to maximize material goods or money, is an old canard, correct in a number of elementary economics texts that I have seen, and occasionally in preliminary pages of monographs in economics. Thus, in an early version of his larger work on the family, Gary Becker asserted that men and women divorce because they anticipate that they will be better off financially if they do. Nevertheless, I have never seen an instance of such a claim in sociology, though of course many bizarre things exist, and therefore must be possible, which I have not seen. All the self-confessed rational choice theorists I know have entertained a broad range of variables, far beyond money. In addition, maximization itself has always had a bad press among sociologists of all stripes.18 Becker himself argued that maximization is not mathematically needed to achieve 32 The American Sociologist/Summer 1997</page><page sequence="12">most of the basic equations in economics. Herbert A. Simon's work in the 1950s on "satisfycing" was more in attune with sociology, and of course many sociolo gists considered him one of us anyway. And those who follow closely the recent drama of rational choice theory understand (as I note below) that we now possess much better information about precisely how we weigh our choices. In any event, until scholars can pin down the specific texts in which rational choice theorists in sociology proclaim the "Maximization of money" postulate as their own, I shall doubt that it has ever been of consequence in our field. In summary, the standard, mainstream position of sociology has been the same for several generations: If a society were based literally on maximizing self interest in money or power, it could not function adequately. Without group constraints and encouragements, internal and external rewards and punishments, Hobbes's conclusion would be correct: Life would be solitary, poor, nasty, brut ish, and short. Whether or not they claim to be rational choice theorists, soci ologists know quite well that money will not directly buy prestige or respect, much less love, and each is so important a "good" that almost certainly more people have been killed for any one of them (in wars as in peace) than for money. Ill Critics have also charged rational choice theory with being only "atomistic" or individualistic, denying the importance of social structures. In fact, most sociologists are quite content never to wrestle with the difficulties, if any, that face the researcher who wants to move from the micro- to the macro-level of analysis. As Coleman points out, social theorizing focuses on how social systems operate, but most research focuses on individual behavior, which yields descrip tions of social patterns by aggregating individual data.19 Of course, there are real problems in that process. If we are not careful in our guesses about what individuals do, some curious errors will be found in our picture of social structures. The central failures of various theories about aggre gation were neatly dissected in Parsons, in his outline of the main schools of action theory.20 When he wrote Exchange and Power in Social Life (Wiley, 1964), Peter Blau thought we should build macro-theory on the basis of individual data. Later, he came to the conclusion that macro- and micro-theories are complementary, and that different perspectives and conceptual frameworks are necessary for each of them.21 Sociologists have generally felt comfortable in making statements about groups or whole nations on the basis of individual data; and those with larger pretensions have shown how social structures, especially by constraining oppor tunities, shape individual behavior.22 Whether we can as yet analyze at the micro level, and thereby explain how various traits emerge at the group, macro-, or structural level?the protection of the commons, the degree of inequality, homogeneity, the notion of justice?is a very different question. Sociology as a field has a bias toward self-criticism, and Goode 33</page><page sequence="13">thus before we flagellate ourselves once more, we should ask whether other fields experience this problem as well. In fact, it is a common problem in most disciplines, for the obvious reason that all science begins with the observation of individual units: that is what reality is ultimately grounded in. As a spectacular instructive example, in a field that is more firmly based than almost all other disciplines, astronomical observations have revealed within the past few years that many "structures" (e.g., the Great Wall) exist in space, which were not predicted from traditional knowledge about individual planets, stars, or even galaxies. Meteorology has had to cultivate a stoic, or artfully smiling, accep tance of its difficulty in leaping from local observations to large storm structures ("Generally, we have weather every day; yesterday we did, too"). Centuries of detailed animal and plant observation were needed before they could be linked to ecological processes. Sometimes we can get macro-patterns by simply ma nipulating individual data (e.g., some index for intermarriage, degree of ethnic heterogeneity, or an index of philanthropy). Some are more difficult, and critics have especially argued that theorists who claim people act in their own self interest alone cannot figure out why people also sacrifice themselves, donate blood or kidneys, demand justice for unrelated others, engage in less free-riding than economic models predict, and so on. Ordinary sociologists, who take for granted that people are trying to do what they do, have never found this prob lem overwhelming, and have consistently reported that people approve of such apparently non-selfish acts: They are values, norms, passions, and preferences, and they shape much of our behavior. If perhaps some zealots of the pure econometric persuasion do not understand that, certainly the rational choice theorists in sociology are not guilty of such observational blindness, and most have continued to wrestle with the problem, with varying success. IV It is difficult to work out any agreement about how "rational" the rational choice theorists actually believe people are. However, those who intend to use the idea more consciously, and proclaim its embeddedness in ordinary thinking, and especially those who wish to apply it mathematically, will achieve more precise equations if they find out how people do in fact make their calculations. With reference to one area, of rational behavior, i.e., when people really believe they are being rational, a stunningly brilliant mass of experimental work is increasingly available to guide us. I have sometimes likened the received theological formulations in economics as a kind of powerful vise, which unfortunately does not close very precisely. We ignore its findings at our peril, even when we see that they continue to seem somewhat askew, not quite right. The work of Tversky, Kahneman, Thaler, and many others has shown us some of the good reasons for our continuing skep ticism. By testing experimentally many of the common assumptions and findings of economics, they have offered much more precise descriptions of how people calculate even when they actually believe they are arithmetically reckoning their 34 The American Sociologist/Summer 1997</page><page sequence="14">best financial interest. They have proved by actual test that many of the tradi tionally accepted economic rules are not followed in real life. Here is only a small sampling of these rules that people do not follow consistently: 1. Previous gains and losses should not influence subsequent choices.23 2. A dollar of opportunity costs, or losses, is treated as equal to out-of-pocket costs.24 3. To the rational thinker, sunk costs (the money or labor we have already put into our goal-seeking) are irrelevant; only prospects and the future are counted. 4. Equivalent dollar losses and gains are weighted equally; losses do not loom larger than gains (Thaler, pp.28 ff). 5. Money is spent on its highest use (where it will bring in the maximum financial return); it has no label or bracket (Thaler, p. 149-150 et passim), no qualitative character, that would make us apply it to one type of action rather than another (aside, of course, from its highest financial return). 6. The worth or utility of the outcome is weighed by its probability; what causes the uncertainty will not be important in economic decisions (Thaler, pp. 140-3). I cannot now list all of them, and I especially cannot analyze the pretty tests these researchers have cleverly worked out to ascertain to what extent real people in their life-calculations actually follow these and other basic economic rules. People do, it seems, pay more attention to an actual loss of cash than to a forgone opportunity; their judgment about a financial decision is, in fact, changed if they have already invested in a course of action; and so on. It is enough to remind you that this work is substantial and robust, and anyone who wishes to utilize rational choice theory in more precise or mathematical forms? in economics as in sociology?must take these findings very seriously. They do in fact begin to describe what we must "mean" when we want to use the term "rational" to imply the conscious calculation of gain, but especially financial gain. They also constitute a new challenge, for many sociologists might try their own hand at specifying more exactly how human beings think in other arenas than the economic.25 Indeed, this is an important task, if we are to understand why sociologists denounce rational choice theory, while they continue to as sume that people carry out actions because that course seems better, or less bad, than others. Critics of rational choice theory often charge that it asserts people are cooly calculating, without passion or emotion, finely econometric, that it does not see how people in the real world are muddled, mindless, living in a swirl of whim and thoughtless decisions. Thomas J. Scheff even denies that social sciences generally pay much attention to the emotions, in spite of the central place of values and norms in sociology over many generations.26 Denzin feels it is necessary to give us an elementary lecture on his version of the importance of emotions, and loftily concludes that rational choice theory cannot encompass all of its mysteries27?though in charity he might have confessed that no field of knowledge will ever focus on everything he mentions. The impor tance of this conflict (and its attendant misunderstandings) is emphasized by the publication of a special issue of Rationality and Society devoted to the emo Goode 35</page><page sequence="15">tions, and Heckathorn's comment that in the past it was understood that soci ologists focused on nonrational behavior.28 In that same issue, Stinchecombe hopes (as I do) that clarification of the necessary interrelations of rationality and the emotions will "make sociologists love each other more."29 I am suggesting, then, that one important element in that clarification would be a more exact specification of just how our thinking proceeds in those innu merable actions of daily life in which the actors do not consciously calculate like accountants, but an observer can observe that they aim just the same at goals, and therefore with regard for constraints, opportunities, and unattractive alter natives. That achievement would complement the work of Tversky, Kahneman, Thaler, etc., who have so neatly begun to specify precisely how people think when they truly believe they are cooly calculating. And it also would help to reduce the misunderstandings between those (the majority) who use some form of rational choice theory but are hardly conscious of it and believe they do not like it, and a few who proclaim their allegiance to it. Modern Modes of Anti-Positivism It is also necessary to take note of a small but valiant and prolific set of our colleagues who follow an entirely different road in these matters. They hope to escape the paradoxes I have outlined here by proclaiming some form of an anti science position, which is often given the confusing label of "anti-positivism."30 However, postmodernists cannot accomplish that through brave, chic, literary statements and tag lines about the prevalence of chaos, a meaningless universe, the epistemologically inherent errors of observation, the impossibility of ever arriving at the truth, or the shaky bases of science. It is not enough to proclaim that all is shaky and chaotic; fortunately, it also has to be proved. With reference to a wide range of such skeptical views of science?ancient or modern, and encountered, e.g., in Wissenssoziologie, in some contemporary Marxist analysis, in Derrida, Foucault, deconstructionism and "radical" feminist theory, in psychodynamics?I reaffirm a traditional view, which will seem radi cal to a few of you but the logic is inescapable: The various forms of apparently nonrational choice analysis are vitiated at their core because all of them must be presumed to be open to empirical denial, which is itself generated by precisely that same nonrational choice theory; that is, they are incorrect, too, or equally nonrational, and therefore need not be believed. If the factual basis of any factual statement is so shaky, that denial must also apply to the proposition which asserts that shakiness. These widespread versions of anti-positivistic thought are often viewed as the latest thing in contemporary thought, but they have been a part of Western thought for centuries among intellectuals, however surprising that may seem to the lay person and a new generation of readers. Its most eloquent spokesmen were the nineteenth-century Romantics, who emphasized the power, and indeed the desirability, of irrational impulses in human beings. Of course, asserting that general anti-scientific stance is easier at the cocktail party, or in salon sociology, 36 The American Sociologist/Summer 1997</page><page sequence="16">sociology, for there it leads to no research commitments. Very likely that stance does not generate any shift in research strategy. Without doubt, it generates few changes in day-to-day choices about practical problems of ordinary life. I can say that confidently because that is also what has happened in physical science over the past several hundred years. That is, no rigorous epistemological proofs have ever been widely accepted that would refute the classical philo sophical assertions by Berkeley, Hume, and others, not to mention more distant figures such as Plato, that the ultimate grounds for science (and especially for a "science" of sociology) are not firm. We have never been able to demonstrate rigorously the key elements in scientific reasoning: cause/effect, links between sense data and reality, the logic of induction, and so on. Kant understood that, and thus proposed the solution I noted earlier. Serious researchers do, in fact, generally understand the apparent fragility within the foundations of science. Nevertheless, they go ahead with their inquiries and discoveries. Most sociolo gists are wise enough to follow them. Among some sociologists and many literary folk, these proclamations that science can and perhaps should be viewed as merely a text, that research find ings are not robust, that human society and human beings are essentially irratio nal, seem to be heady stuff. However uncharitable it may be to take notice, any observer can see that, for all the widespread modern epistemological skepticism about the true value of social science, and the rationality of human beings, the most firmly committed deconstructionist still feels confident that the airplane will fly just the same on his or her way to the next conference?or that if he/ she insults a colleague, the consequences will not be random. In any event, as I noted earlier, all of the anti-positivist positions are self destructive at their core, for if their accusations against empirical science are correct, then we need not listen to them either, since they claim to describe reality, and their very accusations against all such claims can then be denied, too. For example, if we assert that descriptions of reality need not be taken seriously because they are merely texts to be analyzed, that assertion applies to itself-as-text as well, and we can dismiss its overt message. The Greeks said it first, in their famous Cretan Paradox: If the Cretan says that all Cretans are liars, we have to believe he is lying when he says that; and therefore he must be telling the truth, and then his statement is untrue, for he just spoke the truth. And so on. To be sure, one can name a few versions of ancient, theological modes that have instead been used to explain social action. For example, we can say "kismet"; it is all fate; everything happens by the design of some supernatu ral forces or beings. It is all part of God's plan, and it is inscrutable. In that case, ordinary people will continue stubbornly to calculate how other people seek their own interests, while conceding that they may be unable to achieve their own wishes, because God has a plan of His or Her own, serving His or Her own unknowable goals. Trying to build on those wobbly assumptions, human beings might find it even harder (and less worth doing) to construct a social science than at present. Goode 37</page><page sequence="17">Penultimate Comment The uneasiness, even hostility, that many sociologists feel toward rational choice theory is not simply cant, the insincere spouting of pious clich?s, ignor ing one's own indulgence while denouncing it in others. Nor do those feelings arise only from a base envy of the economists' success in the marketplace. This misplaced rancor is, in fact, common in social and political life, in which one or more groups talk past each other, attacking one another for beliefs each does not really hold. Many women reject "feminism" while supporting or taking for granted the main feminist principles; most sociologists casually sneer at "functionalism," if they note it at all, which has actually lost almost all empirical content. In the minds of many sociologists, "rational choice" is made up of several heresies?e.g., the claim that all people are cooly rational, that social processes and values are best described by elementary economic principles, and so on. Such accusations are typically not true. Let me emphasize the point because it is now thought that sociologists no longer can agree on any empirical point at all. They can, and this is one such agreement. I want to make my statement grandly: The "convergence" that Talcott Parsons asserted Vilfred Pare to, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim were creating (with rich support from the great economist Alfred Marshall) denies that a society can work on the basis of the deductions from that famous, and immensely fruitful, tautology, Supply=Demand. Almost every sociologist believes, I am sure, that no society ever thrives, in fact (not in ideology alone, but empirically) never does operate in its entirety, and indeed cannot operate by the rationality principles promoted in elementary economics textbooks, and by enthusiastic boosters for the principles of the truly free market. From my reading of thousands of public statements, it seems likely to me that a fair number of trained economists and a host of people who were persuaded by their basic economic course in college, actually do believe that a society based only on free market, rationality principles is empirically possible. Cer tainly, some sociologists must believe that, too (among so large a number, al most any belief is possible), but I spent most of a lifetime among them, and I never actually met one. Not even those who openly confess they are rational choice theorists would avow that belief. It is not therefore likely that those who practice rational choice analysis? even those who admit it without shame?are trying to sneak in and destroy sociology by inserting pure economics in its place. Conclusion Having asked you to follow me through some difficult terrain, here I want only to emphasize three summary observations. First, sociologists reject rational choice theory but use it just the same; in all other fields that try to analyze organic processes, rational choice theory remains dominant, too; it may be hard 38 The American Sociologist/Summer 1997</page><page sequence="18">wired into our thinking, and thus may be more powerful than we are inclined to believe; and for all these reasons we shall keep on doing it, whether or not we attack it. Thus, my second point is that, nevertheless, we can be more precise about just how people actually do choose or muddle through as they engage in finan cial or moral or even passionate acts (and sometimes an act is all of those). My third point is an obvious one to any sociologist. Even if we agree that people do try to gain their own ends, sociologists have consistently argued that human behavior cannot be explained by the endless pursuit of money. People seek other things, such as love and respect and power, spirituality and grace, and they are not translatable into money, without making the analysis rather grotesque. But as they try to accomplish those other goals, whether or not they are highly conscious about what they are doing, we are likely (as lay persons or as sociologists) to predict their behavior under the assumption that they are really aiming at those goals about as well as they can, given their constraints, resources, and alternatives. I have argued (and I think most sociologists would agree) that in no society have people been entirely engaged in the self-interested pursuit of money, not even this one, and that people implicitly understand that no such society can exist, much less endure. One modest proof is that, whenever people have any choice about the matter (as, for example, corporate officials sometimes can), they quickly make arrangements that undercut the pure system that the econo mists praise. For example, governmental welfare for corporations is widespread. Of necessity corporate officials often employ, or keep, or promote individuals who are not the best for the job (e.g., friends, kin, sychophants, etc.). Societies, of course, have always done so. Some of the dynamics in that process you may find in my analysis, called "The Protection of the Inept,"31 but most of you could make your own. Sociologists will continue to do rational choice theory of some sort, con sciously or not, wisely or not. But the best way to guarantee that we do not commit the errors of the purist economists is to continue to build into our analyses the group-related variables that inherently introduce a macro or system dimension into our thinking and our results.32 The apparent theoretical difficulty in moving from the micro- to the macro-levels, the focus of Coleman's major work, is much reduced if one uses variables that intrinsically bring in a group or third-party dimension, or set of variables. One small example of this would be the many variables associated with one of my continuing concerns, the con trol processes of honor, prestige, approval, and respect. Thereby, we would broaden the range of what many people erroneously believe is the narrow scope of rational choice theory, we enrich it, and we make its findings more precise. And, if we do that, we shall stay closer to the true and continuing genius of our field, a dedication to getting the facts straight, that is, finding out how the social world actually operates. And as Charles Darwin often asserted, if we get the facts straight, we are not likely to be led far astray by any theory, not even our own. Goode 39</page><page sequence="19">Notes 1.

Max M?ller, (New York: Macmillan,1902),2d ed. rev.(1881,1781). 3. Garfinkel's earlier work also showed that no set of rules can be written to account fully for the daily operation of a bureaucracy.

Denzin, "Rational Choice Theory," Rationality and Society 2 (2), (April 1990): 178 9, frequently invokes some of Garfinkel's views, he seems not to understand the importance of this central conclusion. 5. Over the past two decades, mainstream economists have actually explored many of these ^additional" richer variables by the simple process of giving them a monetary variable. Becker's work on the cost of time and of discrimination is an example. He begins his work on divorce by postulating (against all empirical evidence) that people divorce because they expect to be better off financially. One of George J. Stigler's contributions was to calculate the cost of searching for information. Marshall did not draw up an econometric analysis of these variables, but he did look on respect/esteem/prestige as an economic variable ("the desire of men for the approval of their own conscience and for the esteem of others"), in Memorials, ed. A.C. Pigou (London: Macmillan, 1925), p.285. Talcott Parsons (among others) noted long ago that Marshall's view of economic processes was broad, in The Structure of Social Action (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1937), ch. 4.

Neil Smelser has pointed out the similarities in the cognitive patterns of psychoanalysis, classical function alism, Marxism, and standard economics, but he states that by including many "enriching" variables, the theory becomes more abstract, truistic, and incapable of falsification. He sees these processes (of reaching out for new variables and processes) as a matter of "theoretical degeneration" (p.400).

I confess, however, that I do not yet see how to frame the central problem of socialization in terms of rational choice theory for the person being socialized. The parents' aim (or that of any socializing agent) is not simply to "train" the child not to wet the bed, to eat with a fork, to speak respectfully to others, as one might train a pigeon or rat to make the right moves within the maze. The core aim is to get the child to "want" the right things, such as the avoidance of sin or the love of honor, certain types of art or learning, and so on. But the child has no control over whether he/she will actually feel that way, any more than an adult has. We cannot make ourselves love or hate, or believe, or disbelieve. We may want to do so, to please our parents or socializing agents; or we may not want to do so, but in either case that 40 The American Sociologist/Summer 1997</page><page sequence="20">emotional commitment is not ours to command. Parents may, and typically do, accomplish their goals by applying effective socialization variables. Nevertheless, there remains a slippery puzzle around the pro cesses by which that happy result may occur. 17. Donald N. McCloskey comments on this point as part of his general argument that stock market predictions by economists are worthless, in If You're So Smart (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990), p. 119. For an amusing and sharp analysis of the mode of intellectual presentation in economics, see his book, The Rhetoric of Economics (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985). 18.
