<plain_text><page sequence="1">"SOCIAL CHARACTER" AS A SOCIOLOGICAL CONCEPT HENRY OZANNE Columbia University The concept of group character is finding increasing use by social scientists. This paper proposes to standardize the term social character and to construct a sociologically acceptable definition. The term is made a normative one, embody- ing the relationship between culture norms and the generality of their individual acceptance. The determination, then, of the social character of any group becomes the problem of the specification of the group ideals and the ascertaining of their correlation with actual behavior. Four categories of such relationship are set up for research. I THE concept of group character recent- ly has found its way into sociological literature. The contribution, however, is one not from the sociologists proper but from the anthropologists and psychologists, including the psychoanalysts. This concept of group character is intended to satisfy an obvious and growing need in the current the- oretical orientation of the social sciences. Recent studies in the interpenetration of cul- ture and personality searchingly focus atten- tion on the psychological aspects of the re- lationship of the individual to his social group and demand the forging of a con- ceptual tie between personality and the social process. But although the problem has been posed and the need for the concept recognized, there is as yet no agreement on terms, little concern with the methodological issues and almost no consideration of the implica- tions for sociological theory. Many partial and conflicting formulations are used. In the literature there now exists, besides the term "group character" itself, a dozen other desig- nations: "average character," "group per- sonality," "social character"; etc. Margaret Mead uses the term "tribal personality," while Dr. Cora Du Bois makes some in- sistence on "modal personality." All these terms roughly express the idea that "under certain conditions one person is like another." The problem lies in the adequate specification of wherein and to what extent the "likeness" consists and what are the conditions. In view of the long terminological confusion over such concepts as "personality," "character," "attitude"; 1 etc., it is not surprising that the still newer and even less standardized terms are in verbal chaos. Before examining the theoretical prob- lem, I shall illustrate the current difficulty as reflected in the language of two outstand- ing contemporary writers, Erich Fromm and Abram Kardiner.2 Both Fromm and Kardiner direct ex- tended remarks to the term "social charac- ter." They present what is at first an ap- parent antithesis of views. Kardiner says: A group cannot have a character any more than it can have a soul. This anthropomorphism is misleading. What creates the impression of a group character is the operation of general sanctions, which when universally followed may lead to the apparent absence of certain character traits (p. 87). Fromm says: In studying the psychological reactions of a social group we deal with the character struc- ture of the group, that is, of individual persons; we are interested, however, not in the peculiar- ities by which these persons differ from each other, but in that part of their character struc- ture which is common to most members of the group. We call this character the social char- acter (p. 277). ' For a review of the prevailing confusion in the use of many of these terms, see Gordon W. Allport: Personality: A Psychological Interpretation, Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1937. ' Erich Fromm: Escape from Freedom, Farrar &amp; Rinehart, I94I. Abram Kardiner: The Individual and His Society, Columbia University Press, 1939. Page references here are to these two volumes respectively. 519</page><page sequence="2">520 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW On analysis much of this discrepancy is simply on the verbal level, and even on this level it is not persistent, as, ior instance, the following quotation from Fromm shows: . . . we have assumed that ideologies and culture in general are rooted in the social char- acter; that the social character is molded by the mode of existence of a given society; and that in their turn the dominant character traits become the productive forces shaping the social process (pp. 296-297). Disregarding superficial language differ- ences, the conceptualization of Fromm is vir- tually identical with Kardiner's primary in- stitutions -* into basic personality structure -&gt; into secondary institutions. Kardiner him- self says as much: None of the people who use one of these concepts makes any acknowledgment to any- body else who uses another form of it. The strange thing about all these terms is that they have precisely the same connotation, and in the method used to derive the so-called 'modal' or 'tribal' personality, they use precisely the same procedure as I outlined.3 Yet in these various formulations there are certain implicated distinctions relevant for sociology. For example, under Kardiner's conception of character as a mere individual variant of basic personality structure, it would seem that Kardiner is logically obliged to minimize the socially functional signifi- cance of character,4 while Fromm ascribes ' From personal correspondence, Kardiner to the author. 4 Kardiner completely disagrees with my interpre- tation here. He contends "I do not venture outside the range permitted me by the actual material at hand, and so I do not undertake to treat the social relevancy of character variations because I had no such materials available for this book (The Indi- vidual and His Society). I am now engaged in writing a second volume. (The Psychological Fron- tiers of Society, to be published by Columbia Uni- versity Press, 1944) which takes up this very ques- tion, for I now have materials pertinent to this theme." Despite Kardiner's express statement, I feel he has not wholly reconciled the methodological di- lemma. In his conceptual framework basic person- ality structure, as distinguished from character, is a product formation of the primary institutions and this basic personality structure in turn molds the to character both an individual and a social function. Fromm says: . . . the subjective function of character for the normal person is to lead him to act according to what is necessary for him from a practical standpoint, and also to give him sat- isfaction from his activity psychologically. If we look at social character from the standpoint of its function in the social process, we have to start with the statement that has been made with regard to its function for the individual: that by adapting himself to social conditions man develops those traits which make him desire to act as he has to act. If the char- acter of the majority of the people in a given society-that is, the social character-is thus adapted to the objective tasks the individual has to perform in this society, the energies of people are molded in ways that make them into pro- ductive forces that are indispensable for the functioning of that society (p. 283). Kardiner's objection to the conceptualiza- tion of culture in terms of character harks back to an old methodological controversy involving the levels of abstraction. Character designations such as "paranoid," "intro- verted"; etc., are not applicable as culture descriptive labels, he holds, because "to re- gard character as an irreducible racial or cultural idiosyncrasy is at once to use a psy- chological designation and at the same time secondary institutions. In the whole process charac- ter appears to play a minimum functional role. In fact, this constitutes in another form one of my chief criticisms of Kardiner's scheme-it is one- directional, not fully interactional, in that it pro- vides no mechanism by which secondary institutions can work back on basic personality structure and through it on the primary institutions. The trouble here, as I have sought to show elsewhere (The Con- cept of the "Social" in Neo-Freudian Literature, to be offered as an M.A. thesis, Columbia University) lies in Kardiner's treatment of institutions. Primary institutions in Kardiner's conceptualization take on the character of a "given," existing prior to and back of the social process, an implication which is, of course, totally anti-sociological. A source of Kardi- ner's difficulty, I feel, rests in his concept of charac- ter as a strictly psychological phenomenon, rather than as a normative abstraction. In his usage Kardi- ner is not in accord with many authorities in his own field. For instance, Allport (Personality) defining character as "personality evaluated," says "it is sounder to admit frankly that it is an ethical con- cept" (p. 52). And Allport finds no need for it as a psychological term.</page><page sequence="3">"SOCIAL CHARACTER" AS A SOCIOLOGICAL CONCEPT 52I to deny the validity of the psychological derivation of character." Kardiner adds: "The result is no different if instead of using a character trait, we designate cultures through a formula which expresses 'instinct' repression." All this sort of conceptualization is faulty, Kardiner argues, because "it confuses the boundaries between individual and institu- tion." He says: Comparisons between societies on a dynamic basis cannot be made by general terms describ- ing predominant traits or characterological types as they are found in the individual. Such com- parisons can be safely established only by com- paring institutions and then comparing the end results in the individual (p. 87). Kardiner's thought along this line shows an inflexibility that is chiefly the result of his definitional bases. This dilemma which Kardiner cites is for Fromm wholly artifi- cial.5 Methodologically, the advantage of Fromm's formulation is in the substitution of the concept modality for that of range. Fromm specifies social character "as only a selection of traits, the essential nucleus of the character structure of most members [italics mine] of a group which has de- veloped as the result of the basic experiences and mode of life common to that group." Hence Fromm can conceptualize individual deviants as falling outside the social char- acter (or, in Kardiner's terms, outside the basic personality structure), while for Kar- diner such deviants must be embraced with- in the range of basic personality structure. This may become crucial when dealing with certain extreme deviants. For instance, Laf- cadio Hearn as a character deviant of Ameri- can culture must, according to Kardiner, "be more like" any American than "like" any Japanese. Fromm, on the other hand, em- ploying a modal concept can disregard this deviant as irrelevant to the establishment of the social character pattern. 'For a sociological discussion of the epistemologi- cal implications in this problem of levels of abstrac- tion, and an answer to the whole "either . . . or" construct, see G. A. Lundberg: Foundations of So- ciology, Chaps. I and II, Macmillan, I939. And, too, Fromm does much substantively with his concept of social character. He in- forms it with sociological implications and makes, I judge, a significant contribution to political sociology. Particularly does the con- cept serve Fromm fruitfully for the clueful inquiry into social ideologies and the so- ciology of knowledge. II. I adopt the expression social character to satisfy the terminological need already mentioned. My problem at this point, then is that of definition contruction, and the re- mainder of this paper is directed to a meth- odological exposition of the conceptual con- tent of the term as it can be made sociological- ly relevant. The choice of the term social character is governed by two considerations. It is probably the oldest of the terms expressing group character. Fromm appears to have been the first to use it and certainly was one of the first to develop the concept.6 And despite the fact that Fromm's earlier position is more orthodoxly Freudian than his present one, Fromm believes that in his paper of eleven years ago he said "all the essential things about the social character, as I see it." In the next place, the term social character has a normative and evaluative connotation which I make central to its sociological defi- nition.T I define social character, then, as a concept embracing the relationship of two component constructs: (i) Those abstracted elements of the culture which function as norms, here- inafter called culture norms; and (2) The generality of the individual acceptance of these norms. Concrete behavior of individuals in groups, including interaction between groups, is primary data for the sociologist. The term group itself and society are first-order ab- e Ueber Methode und Aufgabe einer analytischen Sozial-Psychologie, Zeitschrift fuer Sozial forschung, Jahrgang, I932. 7Yet the term does not enjoy unanimous ac- ceptance. Dr. Ralph Linton and Dr. Kardiner both have expressed to me their objection to the ex- pression and to the "value" content of my defi- nition.</page><page sequence="4">522 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW stractions from the individuals constituting the interacting system. Institutions is a first- order abstraction from the behavior of indi- viduals. Culture may be either a summative first-order abstraction covering the additive whole of a society's institutions (in general this is the anthropological usage); or it may be a second-order abstraction denoting the integrative patterns of institutions when those patterns are viewed as a new conceptual configurations8 I use the term social character as a second-order abstraction to cover the selective area of culture which embodies the normative, or regulative, standards of the culture. Thus social character is formed around and is expressive of the values of a society-objective goals and aims, morality systems, legal codes; etc. Some of these culture norms have characteristic structural counterparts in the society's institutions, such as the criminal law; while others are virtually non-structured ideals, aphorisms and slogans. Yet the mere projective system of a so- ciety's value configuration is insufficient to delimit social character. In addition, the gen- erality9 of individual acceptance of the cul- ture norms is determinant. Symbolizing culture norms as N, and mass individual reaction to them in terms of ac- ceptance as R, four sets of two-way relation- ships are possible: N+ R+ N+ R- N-R? N-R- The plus and minus signs express for N the positive and negative value standards of the culture, and for R the signs express the behavior reaction (including linguistic) of acceptance. For the culture norms the "+ " indicates the prescripts of the given society, and the "-" indicates the proscripts. For R, the " + " indicates general individual accept- ' For instance, as treated by Ruth Benedict: Pat- terns of Culture. 'Here I do not factor out the intensity of indi- vidual reaction. From other points of view this factor may be crucial; as see, e.g., S. C. Dodd: A Tension Theory of Societal Action, this journal, Feb., I939, Vol. III, No. I. In regard to the measure of incidence I here regard "acceptance" as a dichoto- mous (all-or-none variable) non-quantitative charac- teristic. "Generality" then simply means its statisti- cal distribution as present or not present. ance of either the prescriptive or the pro- scriptive culture norms, while the "-" indi- cates the lack of such acceptance. This ab- sence of acceptance may itself vary from general indifference to actual rejection of the culture norms, but the schematic repre- sentation provides no "neutral" point.'0 The correlation of the N and the R factors ex- presses the relationship between the "ob- jective" and the "subjective" aspects of the culture viewed normatively. But it is essen- tial to remember that both N and R are psychological components of the social char- acter; "objective" and "subjective" are not distinctions between non-psychological and psychological elements, but rather between the psychological elements which are viewed from the standpoint of the group and those which are viewed from the standpoint of the individual." Examples of each type of the four sets of relationship are readily at hand: '?That is, no constitutive relationship is possible where there exists intra-personal indecision (the indi- vidual "doesn't know his own mind"), or intra-group indeterminism (acceptance-nonacceptance bimodal- ity) resulting from, say, a group conflict situation. " My concept here closely parallels the Thomas and Znaniecki "value" and "attitude" formulation. (See The Polish Peasant in Europe and America, VoI. I, pp. 20-2I). ". . . social theory must include both kinds of data . . . namely, the objective cultural elements of social life and the subjective characteris- tics of the members of the social group-and . . . the two kinds of data must be taken as correlated. For these data we shall use now and in the future the terms 'social values' (or simply 'values') and 'atti- tudes."' My term "culture norm" carries the con- cept beyond the mere "object of activity" into the evaluative; and my term "generality of acceptance" I regard as more sociometric than "attitude," and one which avoids an old area of methodological con- flict. "Generality of acceptance" is purely a be- havioral term. My analysis also is close to Linton's "overt" and "covert" culture elements. Linton is at work on a manuscript which carries his distinc- tion beyond his original formulation of "overt" and "essential" (The Study of Man). Of course, one source of this analysis to which due recognition is seldom adequately made is Durkheim. Durkheim, however, in his exposition of "social fact" made the unfortunate dichotomy between the "social" and the "psychological." His viewpoint was more rigor- ously clarified by C. Bougl: The Evolution of Values, translated by Helen S. Sellars, Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1926.</page><page sequence="5">"SOCIAL CHARACTER" AS A SOCIOLOGICAL CONCEPT 523 N+ R+: This relationship expresses a posi- tive acceptance of prescriptive culture norms in terms of individual behavior. It is exemplified in the ordinary workaday social ethics of a people and in the prescriptive forms of its legal sys- tem, such as contract obligation. Most members of our society which positively evaluates prop- erty rights act in a manner to uphold the prop- erty system. N+ R- : This relationship expresses a neg- ative acceptance in terms of individual behav- ior of prescriptive culture norms. One type of it is found in the various normal and ethical florations (mostly verbal) which fall short of legal support or other institutional embodiment: that is, which lack universal sanction. Our cul- ture moralizes the "helping hand," "love your neighbor as yourself"; etc., but individuals gen- erally counter such mandates by acting in their own interests at the expense of others. N- R+: This relationship expresses com- mon individual acceptance of proscriptive cul- ture norms. It is exemplified most typically in a society's legal system (proscriptive law = crim- inal law) and provides the commonsense obser- vation that criminality is atypical of any society in terms of its own definition of crime. Most persons, that is, are not criminals. In our cul- ture most individuals do not kill their business rivals or abduct their brother's wife. N- R- : This relationship expresses the generalized rejection of proscriptive culture norms. It is the typical pattern of criminality. It may vary from cases constituting highly penalized violation of law to those of almost complete toleration, such as exemplified in "Thou shalt not covet," or drinking in the pro- hibition era. The problem of the designation of the social character then consists in the deter- mination of which type of relationship exists between culture norms and their generalized personal acceptance. Different research tech- niques are required for the investigation of each. What are the culture norms? This question will be answered by inquiry into the culture configuration at the level of the concrete, covering the tangible and the kinetic" factors ' Linton distinguishes three factors of culture: the tangible, the kinetic (behavioral including lan- guage), and the "psychological." His ordering, I fear, is in danger of falling into the old Durkheimian of the culture. This is commonly termed the institutional level. Its indices consist of de- scriptive accounts of the various institutions, legal systems, moral codes, conventions, ver- balizations (to the extent that they prescribe rather than describe behavior); etc. "Let the sociologist but know the standards of a people and he can infer the chief features of their social history," says Ross.'3 But these standards are not that in the sense, for instance, that Sumner's mores are standards. The latter are standards in the sense of usages, customs, habits; that is, as actual behavior patterns. Culture norms are stand- ards in a different sense, in that they embody the ought pronouncements of a society. They are the ideals of action. And my definition of social character centers on the relation- ship between the ought and the actual in group behavior. Culture norms, it is true, must be characterized by a people's ever- present awareness of them, but they are not necessarily rational in that they are not al- ways submitted to and are not always com- patible with intellectual judgment. What constitutes a generality of accept- ance of these culture norms? This question is answered by inquiry into the individual actions of a society's members. It covers the "subjective" aspect of culture as previously specified and also embraces the kinetic as link between the objective and the subjective. Its indices are established through surveys of how institutions "work" in terms of personal response to them, questionnaires, Gallup polls, face-to-face conversation to the extent that all these specify actually observed be- havior reactions. And then the correlation between the N and the R factors can be taken as the specification of social character. Social character as here defined must be distinguished from social character traits. fallacy of social vs. psychological. But Linton's intro- duction of the "kinetic" is a needed extension of the "material culture" category of the older anthro- pologists, such as Malinowski. I retain here Linton's tripartite classification but with the repeated insist- ence that the "elements" of culture cannot be dichotomized into the psychological as against the non-psychological. "3 E. A. Ross: Principles of Sociology, Rev. ed. p. 406.</page><page sequence="6">524 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW The latter are first-order abstractions of ac- tual behavior and are the component ele- ments of the social character itself. The social character is a second-order abstraction-the dominant configuration of social character traits from the standpoint of some value ref- erence. It is possible to speak of the social character traits of the American people from the standpoint of a variety of selective values, such as opinions about war, or support of the church. Social character, however, as a second-order abstraction covers the integra- tion of social character traits into a har- monious total value configuration which is marked by generality wide enough to char- acterize the unit taken as the object of study. This unit may be a dyad, an audience, a sect, a race or a nation. The fruitfulness of the concept of social character will lie in its predictive possibilities. If we describe the social character of the American people in terms of a dynamic prop- erty system as "upholders of private prop- erty," and if we are testing the probability of the establishment of a socialist economy in the United States, then we must evaluate this probability relative to the social char- acter in terms of the prevailing culture norm and the mass individual reaction to it. The first and third sets of relationship may express present American social character from different facets. Either we may view our current prescriptive economic system as favored by the general positive acceptance of the people (N+ R+), or we may view it as the generalized acceptance of the social proscription of a socialist economy (N-- R+). Either formulation is equivalent to saying that the system of private property represents a culture norm for our society, and that the majority of American people on the basis of the things they do support and reinforce that norm. On the other hand, should we find the second and fourth types of relationship su- perseding the first and third, we should be more hopeful (or more fearful) of the possi- bility of the introduction of the socialist economy. An increasing finding of the second type of relationship (N+ R-) would indi- cate a generalizing rejection of the prescrip- tive culture norm of private property value. This might take one of a range of forms, from active subversion of the culture norm in criminal activity, to the widening of a social ethic which had as its goal the aboli- tion of the private property system. To the extent that the fourth type of relationship (N- R-) was found increasingly preva- lent, it would indicate a generalizing rejec- tion of the proscription against a socialist economy. In the dynamics of the social proc- ess such change is always apace; for the determination of social character the place of the balance point in such a moving dis- equilibrium is always the test. This definition of social character which I set forth provides a sociological proving ground for its validity and specification in behavioral terms. The definition is intended to serve as an organizing principle, as a framework for research, not, of course, as a substitute for research.</page></plain_text>
