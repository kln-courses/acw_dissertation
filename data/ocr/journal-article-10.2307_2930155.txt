<plain_text><page sequence="1">E. S. BURT Cracking the Code: The Poetical and Political Legacy of Chenier's "Antique Verse" Andre Chenier left a legacy in two parts: a fragmentary, unfinished and unpublished poetic work; a set of published articles on political topics that were partially responsible for his meeting his death on the scaffold during the Terror. What kind of double legacy is this to hand down? Because the poetic work was left unpublished, because the politi- cal works were published to such dramatic effect, the question has a peculiar immediacy. The first task of editors in preparing Ch6nier's manuscripts for publication has been to provide the poetic work the polish that it lacks, thereby making it inseparable from the history of its reception.' The political works on their side have also posed a problem. Strongly argued, passionate reflections on issues ranging from partisan spirit and the constitution, to the National Assembly and the trial of Louis XVI, the political articles are topical enough pieces of journalism to have provided a battleground for the ideologi- cal disputes over the inheritance of the French Revolution and of the Terror.2 Critics have tended to seek to determine by their means 1. The unfinished state of the poems has tempted more than one critic to bring scissors or pen to bear on them.

BURT 211 whether Chenier was guilty as charged of being an "Enemy of the people," or whether the libertarian and antipartisan sentiment he expressed in his political writings was not, on the contrary, closest to the spirit in which the Revolution was undertaken.3 The existence of these two parts to the legacy has led to a third area of difficulty: the apparently innocuous decisions made by editors about the shape of the poetic work are suspiciously ideological; the ideological battles tend, on the other hand, to get translated into such questions as whether poetry makes a good weapon in the war of ideologies, or ought rather to exist in retreat from political questions, whether Chenier mistakenly conceived of the poet as warrior and legis- lator, etc.4 The two parts to Chenier's legacy raise a question: can they be thought of together, despite differences in formal treatment, degree of completion, status of publication, or audience addressed? Ought they to be thought separately, despite those places where the literary and the political can be made to share a common definition-as mode of action on a public, as the products of a single intention, as leading to indeterminable effects?

Walling (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1978), 39-60. He finds Chenier to take a crucial turn away from political allegory to a Romantic poetry of the self. For Starobinski, it is this poetry of lyric expression that has a future. 5. At various moments in the Essai, literature is defined to harmonize with politi- cal action: "Two things, being more than others the fruit of genius and of courage, and ordinarily of both, lead most surely to true glory: these are great actions that uphold the commonweal [la chosepubliquel, and good writings that enlighten it. To do well is that which may most make a man great; to speak well is not to be disdained either; and often a good book is itself a good action; and often a wise and sublime author, being the slow cause of healthy revolutions in customs and ideas, may seem to have done himself all the good that he makes others do." Walter, 622. In other passages from the Essai, Chenier distinguishes literature from the political, with which it nonetheless lives in harmony, because it provides knowledge of corrup-</page><page sequence="3">212 Yale French Studies Chenier traces together in a fictional geneology the degeneration of literature and of republican political institutions, is the central the- oretical text where the question is addressed, as the political writings are the place where it is given its most clearly pragmatic turn.6 But it is in the unfinished epics, above all in Hermes, where is told the history of mankind with respect to the law, that the theoretical pos- sibility of defining the literary and the political "so that they agree with or else exclude one another,"7 and the practical necessity of deciding on a given occasion which definition is to be preferred, come together. It is thus in that epic that we can best discover the principles that divide, and bring together, the two sides of the legacy. Now it is a peculiarity of Chenier's poetical legacy, named as the chief offering of Hermes, that it is no whole cup of poetry he hands us, but a cracked and fragmentary vessel. Why is the poetical work so fragmentary and what do its perceptible cracks have to say about the political? The question has been obscured by the assumption that Chenier embraced unproblematically the political and aesthetic models of the Greco-Roman tradition. The fragmentariness of the work has been considered exclusively in this light, without taking into account Ch6nier's interest in the Orient, and without consider- ing whether his fragments might not lie outside, or border on, the ideals of the western tradition.8 A digression into the fragmen- tariness of the poetical works is thus required. tion in the state. For a corrupt republic, letters are a salutory reminder of antique institutions, and are far removed from the avarice and pragmatic economies governing power relations in the state (623). In tyrannies, however, he finds letters to turn frivo- lous and their degeneration actively to propagate the ills in the public domain (624). In this case, literature has to retreat, in the person of the poet, from the neighborhood of political action (624-25). 6. In Avis au peuple franqais sur ses veritables ennemis, for example, Chenier justifies his examination of an enemy "party" of writers by means of a claim that the Revolution is intimately bound up with writing: "All the good and evil that has been done in this revolution is owed to writings; it will perhaps be there also that we will find the source of evils that threaten us" (206). In Reflexions sur l'esprit de parti, previous to a critique of the chaotic ideas and bad metaphors of Burke's Reflections on the French Revolution, he finds one of the characteristic marks of the Revolution to be that of good writing (242). 7.

Chenier's famous lines on the birth of the poet ought to be considered in this context: ". . . a Greek, in her young springtime, / Beautiful, from the bed of a spouse nursling of France / Bore me French in the heart of Byzantium" (72). The French poet is born in, and oriented toward, a Greek East.</page><page sequence="4">E. S. BURT 213 A peculiar set of conditions-Chenier's premature death, his dis- orderly method of composition,9 and his transitional position be- tween the neoclassicism of the late eighteenth century and the ro- manticism of the nineteenth-have provided critics with ample material for speculation. Many pages have been written that attempt to fill in the gaps and to produce a continuous narrative: how Chenier would have developed had he survived the events of the Terror, 10 how he would have knit together the fragments jotted down in his note- books for publication, how he would have negotiated the transition from the didactic philosophical poems of the eighteenth century to the lyrical voice of the Romantics." 1 Common to the general run of these stories is an implicit reproach directed at the poet for having failed so signally to provide his poems with the autonomy and aes- thetic perfection we expect from the miniature totality that is the work of art. We may ask whether the work is not as it stands complete. Does Chenier pass on to us, for reasons laid down in the work, a lack of polish that he finds to be the polish of poetry? 12 The specific finish to 9. See Paul Dimoff, "Preface" in Oeuvres completes d'Andr6 Chenier, (Paris: De- lagrave, 1946), 3 vols., vii-xxv, for a discussion of the manuscripts. Chenier's writing practices contribute to the difficulty facing editors. He worked on many poems at once, noting down randomly isolated lines, long fragments, prose synopses or critical re- minders to himself; he added to apparently finished poems, inserted short poems in longer poems, or developed, out of the single image of a longer poem, a shorter poem. The poems themselves comment on their composition. 10. Examples of this kind of speculation are too frequent to be enumerated. Paul Dimoff, op. cit., 432-37, provides one of the most fully developed of the fictions attempting to overcome all the disjunctions of the work and life in a story of what would have happened had Chenier been "preserved by miracle from the perils of the Revolution." 11. Did the work remain unfinished because there was a defect in Chenier's poetic conception? A whole school of Chenier criticism concentrates on his transitional position between the long didactic poems of the eighteenth century and the emerging lyric of Romanticism, to find in Chenier's incomplete recognition that the future lay with the lyric the explanation for the fragmentariness of the long narrative poems. Similarly, the brittleness of some of the Odes and Bucoliques derives, or so the theory goes, from a neoclassicism in which too much attention is paid to the respectful recycling of old cliches, and not enough to the expressive originality of the lyrical subject. See, for example, Francis Scarfe or Jean Starobinski, op. cit. Henceforth cited in the text. 12. In a passage from the Essai, Chenier talks about an epic on America projected as unfinished: "As for Mr.... it is a pity that with such great talents he has not carried through so beautiful an enterprise. We would have a poem to oppose to the ancients. But, as we have heard him say several time, his design, in beginning, was not to finish this work. He was already too old and had not yet finished several writings that have</page><page sequence="5">214 Yale French Studies be given poetry is addressed explicitly in various places, among oth- ers, in Chenier's much celebrated and misunderstood definition of the task of poetry from L'Invention: ("Sur des pensers nouveaux faisons des vers antiques") On new thoughts let us make antique verse (127). The central difficulty of the line centers on its articulation of incongruous terms-"new thoughts" and "antique verses." Where we might expect a relationship of a simple contrast-old or ancient opposed to new or modem-we get a different, puzzling articulation between language and thought: the task of poets is to give us antique, that is, outdated, verse on new thoughts. Ancient connotes a con- tinuity between present and past, either within a single existing being, or within a tradition, but antique names the no longer extant, the untimely. It marks a rupture with a continuous narrative joining present to past. Much of the interpretative effort that has been expended on Che- nier has consisted in translating articulations like this one into op- positions, and then reading Chenier's definition of the poet's task as that of overcoming the opposition by the discovery of metaphors expressive of a larger totality. Had "new thought" been opposed to "old form" then the thesis of Francis Scarfe would be correct, and the "central problem of L'Invention (might) be reduced to the paradox: imitate the Ancients but dare to be new and original" (94). For Scarfe, Chenier stands opposed to his age around the issue of metaphor, which the poet sees as no mere ornament or poetic vehicle for ex- pressing the thought of Enlightenment philosophy, but rather as the sensuous form in which the imagination reveals itself. Scarfe finds evidence that Chenier is an early Romantic poet and theorist of the lyric imagination in L'Invention, where invention is said to be the art of knotting things together in metaphors: ". . . in the arts the in- placed him in the first rank among our poets. His project was only to show by this sample what road had to be followed and to which he alone was capable of holding. He aspired to take possession of this land without conquering it, and that his flag planted on the shore should intimidate and make flee whoever might desire to approach it. He wanted the short and precious fragment that he has published to be like the painting that Apelles left imperfect and that no other hand dared take upon itself the charge of finishing" (686). Paul Van Tieghem, "Un 'Monsieur . . . 'mysterieux: Andre Chenier," Revue d'His- toire Litteraire de la France 35 (1928): 92-98, (henceforth cited in the text) has con- vincingly demonstrated that the "Mr." in question is Chenier himself and the poem, his epic LAmerique.</page><page sequence="6">E. S. BURT 215 ventor is he / .... Who, by certain knots, unforeseen and new, / Unites objects that seemed rivals . . ." (124). That Chenier only two lines previously defines the other half of the poet's task as the critical one of separating what old metaphors have assembled, of making peaceful "rival seeds" (124) by undoing false resemblances, seems to have escaped Scarfe, who has nothing but scorn for the threads of materialism and critical thought that tie the poet to his age. Scarfe's thesis comes to grief somewhere between the Scylla of the evidence available and the Charybdis of the evidence lacking. If the same poem, L'Invention, where Chenier supposedly gives his theory of a poetry of lyric expression, turns out to be, as Scarfe bad-humoredly states, "a piecemeal composition which does not logically hold to- gether" (94), one has to wonder whether the failure is not in the account of the poetic theory, rather than in the poem. Nor is it partic- ularly convincing to be told, faced with the formulation "On new thoughts let us make antique verse," that for Chenier, originality lies "in perceiving hitherto unknown analogies and in giving them new expression" (96). Surely, had the poet meant to say the opposite of what he did say, he would have said so. A brief article by Paul Van Tieghem, "Un 'Monsieur. . .' myste- rieux: Andre Chenier," provides a more complex and theoretically informed understanding of the line, which it still translates into a binary opposition: Ch6nier possesses to a rare degree that faculty of splitting himself that allows one to be almost simultaneously creative artist and critic at- tentive to grasping in advance the effect that the work, seen in a manner from the outside, will produce when it will have been finished. The continual see-saw motion that we observe in his works between the practice and theory of his art can be explained by this. One could almost say that he always has in front of himself two pieces of paper; onto one he throws down his poetic projects, onto the other he writes the general reflections that these same projects inspire in him, he notes the reactions that the work of art makes the philosopher conceive. [96] Van Tieghem splits off a projective, inventive writer, a Homer who does not clearly envisage the questions to which he unwittingly pro- vides answers, from a reflective, critical writer, whose belated posi- tion with respect to the text allows the discovery of things ignored by the inventive writer. The capacity of the poet to act as reader of his</page><page sequence="7">216 Yale French Studies own work-to uncover its foresightedness and its shortsightedness- turns the poet into a theorist analyzing the failures and successes of his original project.'3 Now Van Tieghem's direct interest here is in explaining why Che- nier was haunted by the unfinished work. The critical position of the modern involves, for Van Tieghem, a theory of the fragment. A critic is able to see in retrospect what is missing from the legacy of the past, and in his belated, self-conscious commentary, will seek to compen- sate for the failure to achieve the totalization aimed at. In the most literal sense, this is the position of the eighteenth-century observer who considers the monuments of the past from the perspective of a Winckelmann or a Warburton. He has to take into account a discrep- ancy between the avowed aim of transmitting formally perfect en- tities, symbolic works of art, and the fragments or ruins that con- stitute the actual legacy of the past. The new thought Chenier wants to translate into his fragments is a thought concerning the material conditions of the production and transmission of the works of the past. 14 In the last analysis, of course, the critical posture of the modem restores the symbolic model criticized. The opposition to symbolic 13. For Van Tieghem, the new thoughts are those of a critical Enlightenment thinker, and "antique verse" can be glossed as meaning perfect formal treatment: "It is not easy, when one is very hard to please over the quality of verse and very ambitious about the value of ideas, to make antique verse on new thoughts, to be at once the thinker and the artist, the Rabelais drunk with modem culture and the Ronsard in love with antique and perfect poetry" (97). "Antique" is not, however, a synonym for formal perfection. Nor is it certain, in Chenier's vocabulary, that both of the terms in the formula are to be positively weighted. "New thoughts" are not to be swallowed tel quel by a pleasure-seeking wine drinker. In a fragment to Hermes, speaking of the discovery of the new world, Chenier evaluates discovery in two entirely contradictory ways: "Speak at the end prophetically of the discovery of the new world. Oh destinies, hasten to bring this great day which ... which .... But ... no, destinies, defer this fatal day, and if possible, let it never arrive, this day which ... which ... etc....." (415). See also the fragment from the Essai quoted in note 12, where the poet plants a flag in a New World from which all will flee. 14. There is some evidence for this position. In Hermes, Chenier makes it the concern of modem science: "Science wants, not content with admiring the form and the work, to know the material and to see the hand act" (407). The poet would be seeking to figure the critical posture of modem science with respect to the action of the hand on the material that "to their (Greek) eyes is yet too veiled" (125). Indeed, Chenier, who compares the path of the poet with that of the wandering comet, and the poet with Mercury, is perfectly capable of adopting-temporarily-the scientist's position. How- ever, it would be a mistake to think that he confuses his alchemy with the experiments of Newton or Descartes.</page><page sequence="8">E. S. BURT 217 writing is a negative moment quickly subsumed by a larger re- semblance to it. A newly made fragment, however self-consciously it distances itself from a naive harmony between form and idea, neces- sarily reinstates a similar harmony, for the fragment then becomes the form adequately expressing the thought of modernity; it, too, "paints the spirit to the senses" (126), although the spirit in question, the spirit of Enlightenment, becomes critical and materialist. One might legitimately say of this scheme what de Man, in his article on Benjamin "The Task of the Translator," says of Gadamer's: it is "the scheme or concept of modernity as the over-coming of a certain awareness or naivete by means of a critical negation."'15 In Van Tieghem's view, Chenier still concerns himself with "finishing some little part" (98), with composing some perfect fragment exhibiting all the autonomy and aesthetic detachment of the masterpieces of the Greeks. The more rigorous formulations of Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe in L'Absolu litteraire give the stakes of this view for literary history. They explain that the "romantic fragment, far from bringing into play the dispersal or bursting apart of the work, inscribes its plurality as the exergue of the total, infinite work."'6 The fragment supplies the critical perspective missing from classicism. But it also points for- ward to Romanticism by its "fundamental theme of finishing" (67) and by its promise of future works to be written in the perspective of a dialectic of becoming. The characteristic path of the Romantic work-the development of consciousness as it projects itself outward into the visible world, and then bends back onto itself to critique its prior, naive understanding-is already implicit in the self-conscious fragment for Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe. They state that the "frag- ment . . . completes and incompletes [acheve et inacheve] at once the dialectic of completion and incompletion [de 1'achevement et de 1inachevement]" (71). It proves an unstable form pregnant with the promise of a Romanticism that will have fully incorporated into itself the whole history of the development from the Greeks to the En- lightenment as a coming-into-consciousness of modernity. At least one of Chenier's readers saw him as a Moses looking over 15.

Henceforth cited in the text.</page><page sequence="9">218 Yale French Studies into just such a promised land. Victor Hugo suggests that Ch'nier's oddly cut lines and his neoclassical brittleness of diction contain the seeds for a perfecting of poetry: ... this incorrect and sometimes barbarous style, these vague and incoherent ideas, this effervescence of imagination, tumultuous dreams of a wakening talent; this mania for mutilating the sentence and, so to speak for carving it a la Grecque; the words derived from ancient languages employed in all the breadth of their original accep- tance; these strange cuts, etc. Each of these defects of the poet is perhaps the seed of a perfecting for poetry. In any case, these defects are not at all dangerous, and it is a question of rendering justice to a man who did not enjoy his glory. Who would dare reproach his imper- fections while the revolutionary axe lies still bloody in the midst of his unfinished works?"'7 For Hugo, the fragment does indeed constitute a transitional entity. Its very failures and imperfections show a way, prove replete with a promise to Romantic poetry of an inexhaustible development. Despite surface differences, Hugo and Van Tieghem share a com- mon vision of how the poetic legacy works to establish a coherent historical picture. As a seed develops into a tree, so a young man with his audacious and incoherent dreams develops into a maturer, more critical thinker. As a father hands on to a son in an unbroken line the findings of the past which the son has to turn against, in order to constitute himself as an inventive father, so the works of the Moderns in the domain of poetry can be said to derive from those of the An- cients, insofar as they first criticize and then extend metaphor to cover larger narrative sequences. Hugo notes, however, that Chenier's work was interrupted pre- vious to his having become the promised poet of becoming. Further, he puts his finger squarely on a problem: what Chenier's unfinished texts actually offer is a translation between two languages: one, the untimely writing of "antique verse," at once barbarous, tumultuous, and mutilated, dead, obsolete; the other, the polished, living, and expressive language of French. Chenier is less interested in breathing new life into past models or in establishing his poetic filiation, than in carrying forward into modern French the features of inscription: its unnatural inversions and incisions, its sculpted stoniness, its muti- 17. Victor Hugo, Litterature et philosophie melees, in Oeuvres completes, ed. Seebacher (Paris: Robert Laffont, 1985), vol. 12, 94.</page><page sequence="10">E. S. BURT 219 lated, fragmentary state, etc. Hugo's understanding of Chenier's art as an art of translation between dead and living languages corresponds to what the poet himself says of it. In Hermes, the poet envisions that this poem will offer itself in a "new world" as an "antique writing and no longer a language" (405). The poetic legacy opens onto a new land insofar as its own language has become unusable as language. Hermes bequeathes to future sages "thinking lines," "powdery, half-eaten, obscure" (405) that do not claim that it is poetry's chief task to com- municate spontaneous or reflected emotion. An emphatic, if puz- zling, refusal of the expressive Romantic lyric distinguishes Hermes. What does the translation into living language of a language of inscription have to offer? One offering is clearly knowledge of a dead aspect of language that tends to get overlooked when it is considered a means of communication. The fragmentariness of the work derives partly from Chenier's perception of a discrepancy within language between what humans mean by it and the means by which it says it, its codified, systematic and inhuman features, of the sort that a fu- ture sage who cannot understand what a writing means, could none- theless discern. Antique verse offers knowledge of the code even as it survives the death of meaning. But the struggle to translate inscrip- tional features into the living language of French is also productive. It arrives in some unnamed, featureless "new land," which is its other offering. It opens onto something. Both of these offerings are hinted at by the preposition that articulates the relation between new thought and antique verse. Poetry is not new thoughts expressed in the form of antique verse, as the traditional topos would have it. Poetry is antique verse on new thoughts. Two distinct metaphors are suggested here. On a new foundation, on the underlying ground or sustaining surface of new thought is to be erected the edifice of antique verse. The new thought is (of) the condition or sustaining surface. The task is to discover or invent. The other metaphor that comes to mind is very different. Antique verse rises on new thoughts as a heap of stones is piled up to mark a grave. The new thought lies buried under rubble; a radical loss of meaning has taken place; antique verse records, stands for a lost expressive voice, and keeps on standing past its loss. The task is to warn that the code is not subject to the same laws of progress, perfectibility, becoming, as human thought. In Hermes, the question of code-system of laws, collection of rules and conventions, dictionary of equivalent terms (specifically, between a natural and an arbitrary language)-also explains the con-</page><page sequence="11">220 Yale French Studies jugation of the literary with the political. Of concern to poet and to law-maker alike is the instituting of signs in a code meaningful to an interpretative community and transmissible to posterity. Potential failures of meaning, breakdowns in transmission, interest both as well. From the perspective of the active establishing of rules govern- ing the interpretation of a code, as from the perspective of the failure of an interpretation to be handed down intact, politics and poetics lie roughly within the same domain. In the second song of Hermes, Chenier seeks out the common precondition for the establishing of codes and for their conservation. The condition for invention in arts, sciences, and statecraft, he says, is writing, conceived as active, pri- mary art. The condition for conserving and progressing in them is also writing, but a writing relegated to a secondary position as the means of preservation and transmission of the other arts: Avant que des Etats la base f ut constante, Avant que de pouvoir a pas mieux assur6s Des sciences, des arts monter quelques degr6s, Du temps et du besoin l'in6vitable empire Dut avoir aux humains enseign6 l'art d'6crire. D'autres arts l'ont poli; mais aux arts, le premier, Lui seul des vrais succes put ouvrir le sentier. [394] Before of States the basis was constant, Before being able with pace more assured, In the sciences, in the arts to climb several steps, Of time and need the inevitable empire Had to have taught to humans the art of writing. Other arts have polished it; but to arts, the first, It alone to true success could open the path. So begins the dense fragment that traces the fictional development of writing in conjunction with the development of political institu- tions. The discovery of political institutions goes hand in hand with the seizing and fixing of the writing code. In the beginning, writing is the primary art. It is the art that opens the path for the steady progress of other arts, including that of government. Writing is active: "An elo- quent hand ... makes seen invisible and rapid thought" (394). It man- ifests and fixes the invisible and unstable. As the poet tells the story of how Hermes' gift of writing develops, he will show that institutions take shape at each stage by way of an increasingly complex interpreta-</page><page sequence="12">E. S. BURT 221 tion of the writing code. Beginning with a contractual model in which writing testifies to treaties between individuals, political entities will be discovered that regulate exchanges among larger groups. Each new institution establishes itself by discerning and elaborating new pat- terns to which meaning is assigned; each one sheds light on sign relationships previously obscure. Modernity, Chenier will further suggest, needs to be reminded of this because in one of the stages in the seizing of the writing system, the active capacity to make thought visible that writing has on the "page of Egypt" (394) is covered over and it gets conventionally deter- mined as a transparent, faithful, and enduring repository for "our souls and customs" (395). The passage just quoted already foresees this reversal: at first writing opens the trail for arts, sciences, and statecraft. Later, it loses its primary status and becomes a secondary art polished by other arts; it conserves what has already been dis- covered, in keeping with its other function as memorandum: "An eloquent hand ... holds ... (main... tient) invisible and rapid thought" (394). The stage when writing gets irrevocably determined as window glass or shiny mirror in Chenier's fiction, is the stage during which the phonetic alphabet is discovered and writing be- comes subservient to spoken language. It corresponds to the opening of the Classical era. Along with the invention of a western Greece will come the foundation of a stable state, the development of the arts and sciences, the beginning of man, and the reorientation of the world, now a Western world that has forgotten its oriental cradle, along with a North-South axis. But it has to be borne in mind that the turn that makes writing the subsidiary of other arts is not the only way that written signs work. It is, simply put, the one that has had currency in the Western tradition as it has been handed down to us. The eloquent hand always both "holds and makes seen"; it is only by arbitrary decree that it is determined primarily as holding, sec- ondarily as manifesting. There is something to be gained by this determination, since it enables the history of other arts to unfold as a continuous, steady, progression along a path. But at no moment does writing lose its double force. Its manifesting activity may go under- ground; it does not, however, lose it. The continuous history that determination of writing as secondary enables can be disrupted by its other force. The reverse is also true. The activity of the hand making thought visible can always undergo alteration, take on the aspect of a static,</page><page sequence="13">222 Yale French Studies holding hand. A quick look at Chenier's description of the develop- ment of hieroglyphic writing shows that the Egyptians for us are always nothing more than the once inventive, now unintelligible handwriting they left. However, to themselves, the Egyptians were much closer to being Greeks.'8 We have a compelling reason for reading their "antique writing," for their history shows they were unaware of how their writing was rendering itself antique; their story may unwittingly be our own: De la, dans l'Orient ces colonnes savantes, Rois, pretres, animaux, peints en scenes vivantes, De la religion tdn6breux monuments, Pour les sages futurs laborieux tourments, Archives de l'Etat, ouI les mains politiques Traqaient en longs tableaux les annales publiques.

This is consonant with Warburton's insight, in his Essay on Hieroglyphs, that the Egyptians sought to transmit a science by their hieroglyphs.

This simple and crude art sufficed us perhaps So long as all our discourses knew not how to see and know More than the present objects in scattered nature. But one saw, when toward man one learned to descend, When it was necessary to fix, to name, to write, to hear, Of the heart, the passions the most secret detours, The spaces of time either longer or shorter, What a narrow circle confined this antique writing. The more pains one took with it, the more uncertain, obscure, Of meaning confused and vague it thickened the night. Five stages in an interpretation by a tormented future sage are sketched out around the inscriptions: in the first stage, the obelisks are considered as religious monuments, whose hieroglyphs are read as pointing toward a metaphysics; in the second, the knowing col- umns are called archives of the state on which a history has been written; next, they are considered as a ruin, a heap of heady emblems, from which one is chosen to explain in a meta-code the composition of the code; fourthly, the whole of the Egyptian code is compared to a living language having the power to express man's inner world; and finally, Egyptian writing is determined to be a nonlanguage, an unin- telligible writing, whose law of becoming is not that of progressive enlightenment, but of becoming-more-obscure. At each stage in the seizing of the hieroglyphs, a double move- ment can be discerned. On the one hand, the logic is of invention and destruction: a new institutionalization takes place that involves the ruin of an old system. The fixing and destroying work is most appar- ent in the first three stages of the passage, where the knowing col- umns are first called "monuments of religion," then "archives of the state," then, "a heap of heady emblems." By the last two stages, where the destruction of Egypt is more visible than its construction, and where the presence of the interpretative voice is paramount, the in-</page><page sequence="15">224 Yale French Studies stituting signs regulating the interpretation have become verbal co- lossi like man, nature, the heart, spaces of time, or certainty and clarity. On the other hand, the logic that regulates the development of each system from the inside, as a system of meaning, is that of polish- ing, in its twin sense of perfecting and wearing away.'9 Each new interpretation takes into account something left out or obscure in the earlier system. It enables a larger set of exchanges, and is addressed to a larger group. The heads of state and religion in the first scene give way to representative members of the polis at work, "political hands" tracing. By the third stage, a whole mass-the people-are involved, that soon give way to "us," men and women of the present who judge the Egyptians as lesser versions of ourselves, and then to "one," a pronoun large enough to include both the "us" who came after them, and them, the third-person Egyptians. The wider audience is found at the price of erasures: the vivid scenes of living beings-kings, priests and animals, are effaced in the second scene to leave "long pictures." by the third scene reference is uncertain. In the fourth and fifth stages, past referents like the state, man, or metaphysical beings are denied by the interpreter, who then asserts the writing to be mean- ingless. The twin logic made visible in Egyptian writing knits together writing as inventive-manifesting and destroying-and writing as polishing-perfecting and wearing away.20 At each stage, the dou- bleness of the hieroglyphs-they are both pictures and characters, as Warburton informs us-gets stabilized by the erect columns into a totalizing interpretation, implying a unified interpretative commu- nity around it. On closer view, however, a discrepancy or obscurity, entailing a new interpretation shows up in the very signs-the know- ing columns-that fix the code. As the passage progresses, instead of a wider interpretative system managing to overcome the doubleness, it keeps on migrating somewhere else and getting harder to master. By the fifth and final stage, not only has the elucidating process led to 19. For a discussion of the law of "usure" in Warburton's discussion of the develop- ment of Egyptian writing, see Jacques Derrida, "Scribble," in William Warburton, op. cit. 20. See Chenier's discussion of the challenge French poses to the poet at the end of L'Invention for another twist on the same theme. French is described as having a twin source: in the barbarous, rusty, proud, and indocile Frankish tongue; in the polished, civilizing, seductive, easily-molded wax of Latin.</page><page sequence="16">E. S. BURT 225 total obscurity, as night falls on the Egyptians, but the doubleness spills over into the comments of the interpretative voice itself: the same line tells us that this antique writing thickens the night of meaning [elle epaissit la nuit du sens], that is, has become unin- telligible; and affirms that it thickens the night with meaning [elle epaissit du sens la nuit], that is, the folds of the curtain falling, and thus unintelligibility itself, are thick with significance. This interplay is worth a closer look, because the features of Egyp- tian writing are translated into the language of the interpreter, mak- ing the story into an allegory for a French present. The problem in the code's development lies chiefly in the signs that institute-the erect columns-and that are not regulated by the interpretative system they set up. They have to lie outside the system that holds sway at any stage in order to establish it; but because they are themselves double and are not regulated by the system they estab- lish, they can be toppled at any point. The first stages show most clearly that the columns lie outside the system they regulate: the obelisks are first called "somber monuments," and are then picked up again and elucidated as "archives" set up in an open, public space. The move from the religious to the political code entails a disclosure, a publication of the space defined by the obelisk that was dark in the first scene. The monuments of religion are pushed over, and in their place rise the secular archives of the state. To understand the darkness of the monuments, we have to look at the interpretative system they regulate. The monuments establish religious allegory as the way to decipher isolated picture words: the living scenes are words that mean literally, properly, the physical beings depicted, the kings, priests, and animals. Figuratively speak- ing, however, they mean metaphysical, otherworldly beings. A sim- ilar interpretation is at work in the accumulation of nouns and adjec- tives provided by the French speaker describing the columns. Each semantic unit has a proper, literal meaning but can also stand for an abstract entity-the priest for the spiritual, the king for the temporal, the animal for the physical world. Religion's monuments act to sta- bilize the doubleness of the hieroglyphs, their referential and their figural capacity, into a hierarchy of meanings: first the proper mean- ings, then the figurative one. But what about the monuments themselves? Are they signs hav- ing a literal, proper meaning, or are they figures? As signs arbitrarily chosen to perpetuate the memory of the gods, they surely have a</page><page sequence="17">226 Yale French Studies literal meaning, awarded to them by religion's decree. But, the monu- ments of instituted religion have substituted for natural signs- "the august book and sacred letters" of nature mentioned a few lines above. They do not just stand for something; they also stand in, in the absence or loss of something; they commemorate the loss of the pantheistic gods. The articulating preposition of, foregrounded in Chenier's line by inversion and sonorous repetition (Dela, dans l'Ori- ent .... De la religion), is undecidable in the same way. It tells us that the monuments are the property of religion, which erects them to remember the gods. But it might also be that religion belongs to the monuments, that they are monuments to religion, reminders of its death. If the genitive is subjective, then religion has erected the mon- ument. If objective, religion lies buried under it. The articulating preposition that tells us which is the proper term and which the extended one is undecidable. For the Egyptians living by the monu- ments, interpreting the hieroglyphs on their face, the obelisks are stable, enlightening. But there is an undecidability in the instituting sign that already imperils the monuments of religion and opens out onto the secular interpretation of the next scene. just so, the genitive repeats the gesture of stabilizing and destabilizing the property rela- tion in Chenier's poem. In the next stage the destabilizing sign from the first stage, the memorializing sign, is incorporated into the interpretative system and the columns move onto center stage as archives. Documentary writing, where signs serve to record, is the primary function of writ- ing here. At this stage, writing is already alphabetic. Chenier follows Warburton who suggests that the obscurity of picture words necessi- tated the invention of a conventional alphabet of hieroglyphs whose letters "express words, and not things" (160). Some picturing function is still discernible, but it is less important: the long pictures in which the annals are recorded also serve as symbols of the "long-stand- ingness" of the state, of the duration of its continuous history. A hierarchy of sign systems gives the priority to documentary writing over fictional writing. The primary feature of the interpretative system is that writing has become conventionally determined as a secondary art. Hiero- glyphs are assigned to express the inventive signs of the earlier stage; verbal deeds, like other deeds, take place and then are written down, recorded. Much could be said about the space set up: it is a public</page><page sequence="18">E. S. BURT 227 space where men are considered with respect to their job functions, their roles in the state apparatus, where arts and strategies are being practised by crafty hands. Once again, Chenier's lines translate the situation into French: a fully articulated grammar shows up in the relative clause describing the archives. One does not have to be a volitional subject to be the subject of a sentence; one does not have to perform any deed worth recording to be doing something in a sen- tence. In the place of meaningful subjects or deeds there is a subject- verb-object construction: "where political hands traced ... annals." Roles, grammatical functions, have taken precedence over semantic units of meaning, much as the scribes' hands take a role in maintain- ing the state machinery. But what of the archives? They establish a public space, a polis, which promises to last so long as records are kept. The archives themselves, however, are of another matter. They are material col- umns, and as such, are subject to a very different set of accidents than the state. They can outlast it, as the obelisks have outlasted Egypt. They can fall into rubble before the Egyptian adventure is over, as they do in the next stage. Furthermore, as material signs, in excess of the "where" that they help institute, they are eminently appropriable into other contexts. They constitute a "where" of a very different sort than the "where" of a room or a square or a city. The adverb where [oui] is the undecidable feature in Chenier's translation of the problem. As an adverb introducing a relative clause, it relates hands to the place indicated by the antecedent archives. Hands trace where there are archives, that is, inside the state. But where can also be an adverb meaning: there where, the place where. The phrase would then de- fine where the archives are: "archives of the state [are] there where political hands traced." In other words, the archives might not be opening the space within which scribes work; the scribes might be opening the archives wherever they leave material traces. The page is designated as the archive; the state as an invention masterminded by secretaries.21 The crafty political hands, so modestly effacing themselves as 21. Cf., Warburton, op. cit., 160, who explains that epistolic writing-a code at once unambiguous and, at first, secret-was made possible by the invention of an alphabet by a secretary to the King of Egypt. For Ch6nier, the development of the state itself, with its mechanisms, its secrets, its publicity, is indissociably linked with the alphabet.</page><page sequence="19">228 Yale French Studies mere recorders of deeds, and reducing writing to a skill among others, are effectively the "doers" and "rulers" at this stage. What they are doing is actively repressing something. The sign system operative allows for the marking of local losses and posits a continuity tran- scending them, but it actively forgets that the promised continuity depends on the survival of the material columns and traces that con- stitute the archive. It represses the accidents and misappropriations to which the archive is subject. The excluded materiality of writing returns to organize the next scene-in the heap of rubble and the dream emblems composed out of dismembered body parts. Before turning to the emblem, which as stage of assembly re- counted in the present tense, turns out to be the crucial one for an understanding of the lesson of the hieroglyphs for present-day in- stitutions, a few summarizing remarks are in order. We have shown that instituting signs establish increasingly more complex systems of interpretation, with greater possibilities of exchange, at the price of some loss of expressiveness. But the columns lie outside the system they set up. They are always unsteady, are subject to another set of evaluations, of accidents, etc., and may serve to undo the very sys- tem-however long-lasting-they have erected. The instituting signs construct and undo, they fix and crack the very codes they allow us to crack. The undecidability of the signs that institute has to be dis- tinguished from the stability that reigns within the sign system in- stituted, however. The latter relies on a forgetting or repression of the instability of the articulating sign. That repression can be positively or negatively evaluated depending on whether one is faced with in- venting institutions or maintaining those already found. It is not necessarily a simple matter to know what kind of period one is in, however. In 1790, in Avis au peuple franqais sur ses verita- bles ennemis, Chenier will state that the period the nation is travers- ing is one of division and intense uncertainty; it is in the "interval that there must necessarily be between the end of the past and the beginning of the future" (203). The uncertainty is over the question of whether the nation has entered into the enjoyment of rights already discovered, or whether the institutions that will establish them have yet to be grounded. In 1791, writing on the National Assembly's work on the constitution, Chenier suggests that the Revolutionary mo- ment is over, the new edifice in which people have to learn to live in peace has already been built. He warns the Assembly against the</page><page sequence="20">E. S. BURT 229 dangers of continuing to act as if the house had not yet been con- structed: So long as the National Assembly lasts, the attentive peoples, watch- ing always act the hand that has destroyed everything and rebuilt everything, will remain always in suspense and seem always to fore- see some new thing. One only inhabits a house with security once the workers are no longer there. [236] In the same passage, however, he suggests that the state edifice can- not be said to be firmly grounded until people are convinced of its stability, and that the time of division and uncertainty cannot end until the constitution that will guarantee the people its rights has been written: Among the causes that must make us hope ardently that the National Assembly, abandoning to future legislatures all that does not require its hand, not lose an instant in finishing the constitution, and put an end to its immense work, the hope of seeing finish all these parties, which tire us and deteriorate the public spirit, does not seem to be counted among the least.... Then only will everyone, patriots and malcontents, be well convinced that the edifice is stable and firm.... Then only will it be possible for concord and peace to be reborn among us, as among our legislators. [236] The state edifice is built and requires only maintenance and pol- ish; the peaceful state has not yet been firmly grounded in conviction. The uncertainty that Chenier consistently sees as characterizing the Revolution has an analogue in the third stage of Egyptian writing. When we look to what the interpreter says of the emblem and its interpretation, we discover an open question as to whether any ruling interpretation has been set up at all. A whole has not yet been com- posed, it is to come: "enemy parts will compose a single whole." But a means has also already been found to gather disparate pieces, in the "knot that reassembles" enemy parts. The knot has now to be main- tained. The French commentator explains that interpreters of the emblem waver about its status in about the same way as the nation wavers over the status of the period it traverses. Among other features that suggest the stage as analogous with the uncertain 1790s, is the use of a terminology of assembly and of parts. Throughout his brief career as political journalist, the National Assembly and partisan politics were Chenier's central preoccupation.</page><page sequence="21">230 Yale French Studies But if the emblem is a promising place to investigate what Che- nier takes to be the stage in the development of the code France traversed during the Terror, it is also a singularly difficult place to do so. What kind of interpretative system is established by a "heap of heady emblems," which, at the very moment that it gives the code to the community, already stands as a ruined, undecipherable column? What is the code that allows the enigmatic emblem to be deciphered? Warburton, from whose Essay on Hieroglyphs Chenier has been borrowing heavily all along, provides a clue. The hieroglyph that Chenier describes can be identified as the figure accompanying para- graph 55 of the Essay, which is a figure of offering. It shows a woman with an eagle perched on her head, wearing a formfitting dress of a criss-crossed design that is reminiscent of scales or tilework. She is offering a platter of cups to an enframed male figure, bearing a staff and swathed from neck to toe in a garment whose more loosely crossed hands Warburton shows to be like those of a mummy. The pedestal on which the male figure stands is covered with hiero- glyphics, and there are inscriptions as well above and below the plat- ter offered by the female figure. And Warburton explains: the hiero- glyph manifests "a mixture of diverse kinds of Egyptian writing" (219). Chenier's translation of the hieroglyph also recapitulates and brings into conjunction the two earlier stages of writing described in Hermes: the word-pictures of the first stage with their religious sig- nificance, and the words-standing-for-words of the second stage, with their political function.22 The emblem represents the stage in which a code as a dictionary of equivalents is being proposed that will allow for a maximum translatability between its diverse kinds of writing. It can be identified as a poetic composition for it talks about the sign system and how it signifies. However, just as the instituting signs of the earlier stages exceeded the interpretative field they set up, so does this offering exceed the intention of maximum translatability that informs it. Instead of providing maximum intelligibility for the di- verse kinds of writing, the code starts to become fragmented and 22. For Warburton, there are four sorts of Egyptian writing: 1) the Hieroglyphic, divided into curiological and tropic; 2) the Symbolic, divided into the tropic and the allegorical; 3) the Epistolic; 4) the Hierogrammatic. The last sorts were alphabetical, and stood for words, whereas the first two sorts were symbolic and stood for things (op. cit., 136). Chenier has telescoped these four kinds into two.</page><page sequence="22">l~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1/~d4 l Fip. orl S j.$ | j A Figure 1.

We register here, above all, a failure of interpreters to come to grips with the poetic emblem. It is easy to see that the translation of the emblem assembles the diverse kinds of writing. On the one hand, are brought together body parts, figures left over from the earlier stage when living pictures of physical creatures were the literal form in which abstract meanings were expressed. There are plenty of disjecta membra from physical beings of different provenance here. The eagle drifts down from the air; the flanks are the flotsam of a denizen of the sea; the woman's body dwells on the earth. "Scale" suggest that we may even have a salamander, scaly creature who, according to legend, can live in fire. On the other hand, all the words that stand for other words, the grammar and alphabet of documentary writing are piled up here as well. The conventionalized parts of a language are being assembled, as can be seen in the French sentence structures which exactly repeat the earlier patterns. The first clause repeats the pattern of the monu- ments' description ("Thence, in the Orient. . . Thence, in a heap . . ; For future sages laborious torments.... For ignorant people religious monsters; Kings, priests, animals, painted.... A single whole, as- tonished . . 1'). The juxtaposed second clause repeats the subject- verb-object pattern of the archives' description ("political hands traced ... the annals; a body of a woman ... joins the scale"). Evi- dence of structural work with a language voided of meaning can be found in other places as well. An alliterative chain joins in the blah blah blah of an emblem an aMas d'EMBLEMEs, Monstres reLigieux, MEMBres ennEMis, coMPoser ENsEMBLE, rassEMBLE, that engen- ders and shades off into further strings, as, for example, the fricatives joining Femmes, Front, enFant, Flancs. The principle is of reassem- bling language parts into structural patterns without considering meaning. The emblem is also put together as a grammar or an alpha- bet whose structures do not refer to anything outside language. But the emblem does not just assemble the diverse kinds of writ- ing. It tries to make them translatable, to bring them together in a larger system that allows their deciphering. As a dictionary permits the exchange of one term against another across the whole terrain of the language, whatever the derivation of the individual terms, so the emblem tries to make all of the pieces derived from its earlier stages accessible, translatable into one another. It does so by providing a bridging term that brings the enemy elements of picture words and conventional letters (or figure and grammar, in the French) into con-</page><page sequence="24">E. S. BURT 233 junction with one another: the woman's body joins the scale and the flanks. Now the fishes' flanks are a region of the body and can sub- stitute for the woman's thighs by likeness. As in the earlier stage where pictures gave visible form to metaphysical being by resem- blance, so do these flanks substitute for those of the woman. The scale, on the other hand, is not a body part but a covering bearing a mosaiclike motif of interlocking parts. It can represent conven- tionalized grammar, both because it figures a set of relationships and because it is a carapace, a covering. The scale, like the woman's dress in Warburton's figure, does not resemble the body; it substitutes for it as a conventional sign decreed to stand for another sign. The scale designates writing as a secondary art, as an artificial structure of arbitrary signs. The emblem thus asserts that a larger figure, the body of the woman, bridges the gap between the two kinds of writing signs found in the earlier stages. It brings them into relationship, opens a communicating door between religious allegory and documentary writing. The woman's body is a figure that relates all the signs in the Egyptian writing system as translatable. Whether the thighs are dis- closed by way of a metaphorical transfer, or by taking off the dress of conventional written language, it is the same thing. In both cases, a single signified, the woman's body, is disclosed. The larger figure articulates the two kinds of signs as exchangeable. But what is the status of the larger figure, the sign that carpenters the joint? The instituting sign that offers the dictionary is just another sign in the dictionary to which the key is needed. The emblem comments on this as well. The woman's body can join scale and flanks in a very different way. When one plank joins another, when an individual joins a group, when, a little further on, a new word enrolls itself in a reg- iment of other words, joining does not mean "to make communi- cate." It means enlistment, enrollment, enumeration. The woman's body is just one more heady emblem flung onto a heap of others. The scale and the flanks and the forehead and the woman's body are so many unrelated terms. The emblem offers the code as a set of figures and conventional characters, translatable by recourse to a larger fig- ure that says grammatical structure and figures are interchangeable because they all signify the "body of language." But it also offers the writing system as a heap of names or letters to which access has been lost. The emblem, we can say, is self-fragmenting. An enigma arises as to the origin of the term, a woman's body, that</page><page sequence="25">234 Yale French Studies bridges and does not bridge the gap between the two systems. The problem can be stated as follows. Does the larger figure that makes all signs translatable emerge, by chance, in the midst of a list of diverse kinds of writing? Or, is a figure decreed in order to allow translation, which then turns out to have already been altered, added to the list as just another piece of language? Have instituted signs, letters, become inventive? Are instituting signs getting altered into conventional signs? The crossing of terms shows that the emblem takes as its problem the undecidability of writing. It is suspended over the ques- tion of whether writing manifests itself as an active force capable of producing meaning independent of human intention, or is always altering its active force by maintaining iterable terms. Because Che- nier has been attributing agency to the hand writing, rather than to human will, it is clear that the poem envisages the problem from the perspective of the laws of a text and not of expressive language. The problem can be understood in visual terms, by reference to a mosaic, one of the etymological meanings of emblem. Structurally speaking, a mosaic is a network of tiles joined, as the planks in a floor, by blank spaces or articulating intervals. On the face of the tiles appears a figure, a picture delineated without concern for the design of the ground. The mosaic is somewhat like an anamorphic painting, in which a picture appears at the expense another.' But it is unlike anamorphic painting in that one picture of a mosaic is most often a representational painting of a human scene, whereas the other is a geometric design. Furthermore, one never can quite erase the visible cracks running through the figure in a mosaic, nor quite forget about the parts of the human figure in examining the design. The other pattern is always interfering. One can crack one code, say that of the figure, only by forgetting about the crackwork of the tiles, say that of the structure of enumeration. But, as in a mosaic, there is too much evidence of the other code's activity to be sure about the prevailing pattern. It is impossible to say whether the emblem is constructed as an alphabet, from which a figure emerges by accident to gather all the terms, or is constructed as a figure, which is then added to the signs it is meant to translate as one more undecipherable piece. The French interpreter comments upon how the poetic emblem was received by its audience. The people who interpret the "heap of heady emblems" dwell in ignorance. In trying to understand the dou- ble aspect of the code offered by the emblem, one inevitably misun- derstands it. The decisive move is the interpretation of the emblem in</page><page sequence="26">E. S. BURT 235 terms of interpretation, that is, in the attempt to understand where the suspension of meaning by listing comes from and what it means. People understand the irresolvable conflict over the emblem's origin as the expression of the essence of some divine author. The dou- bleness of the emblem is read as the representation of a hybrid god, a monstrous being ruling over the different elements. The various parts are made the moments of a mythic narrative of transformations (from the belly or flank of a fish, to the eagle, child of air, to the woman's body, to the dead scale of the mummy's bands) by which the god's essence as creator is revealed. The self-fragmenting fable about the emblem's undecidable origin is understood as a literal narrative re- vealing the nature of a divinity. The emblem is a figure for language, and it poses an open question about the way one of its terms joins others; the figure is taken as the proper, literal meaning of some monstrous creative force manifesting itself. In a fragment attached to Hermes, Chenier comments on the propensity of people to misinterpret the emblems and apologues of its sages: Most fables were without a doubt the emblems and the apologues of sages.... It is thus that were made such and such dogmas, such and such Gods . .. mysteries . .. initiations. The people took as proper meaning what was said figuratively.... Origin of religious follies. [411-12] And later: This mania of believing that the Gods had their eye on all their little disputes, and that on the most frivolous occasions a miracle would come to violate the laws of nature. [413] People decide that some divine author reveals itself in this un- decidable text. The emblem does not know whether it originates in meaning or in enumeration. But it seems to be impossible, when one tries to understand it, not to decide that the suspension of meaning is the visible form of a thought. Now within the ignorant people, there are actually two divergent sacrifices being made to the monstrous divinity. On the one hand, there is a sacrifice, discussed by Chenier in a political text called Les Autels de la peur, of thought to belief (358). Thought tells us that we cannot tell whether someone means the figure to emerge, or whether it just emerges out of the spewing up of the words in the language.</page><page sequence="27">236 Yale French Studies Belief tells us that the emblem means to tell us this. That is super- stitious nonsense. It cannot be that some single author controls the effect of what is stated to be an uncontrollable machine. On the other hand, another group of people, working within the same interpretative framework, but inflecting it differently, sees a chance to chase after private interests and pleasures. Among the signs indicating this group are the terms ascribing human feeling to the empty verbal entity of the emblem: "heady," "astonished." This group can be said to make another kind of sacrifice to the God, which Chenier also names in Les Autels de la peur-the sacrifice of con- science, the moral faculty of judging action (358). There are initiates into the mysteries of the God, knowledgeable people who understand that the larger figure may have been produced by an accident of struc- ture. They treat the machine producing meaning as machine, having nothing to do with human bodies or wills. Language is just language; one can play with it, exploit it for the power it provides. The emblem asserts that texts always undecidably refer to the world and to language, undecidably offer a sage's understanding and offer things no sage could mean. But this group grasps the emblem as meaning "just language producing more language effects." They for- get that the emblem provides only one figure from a heap for the way that the hand writing may always be working. The story shows that the grasp of the writing system is indissociable from the progress of institutions, as well as of the arts and sciences. To claim that this is just this language working to proliferate extra meaning is to deny that the machinery might be operative in those places which were of most concern for Chenier in writing the history of Hermes' gift, namely, in politics, religion, arts, and sciences. It is also a literalization to under- stand the figure for the monstrous text as just language play, since the play by now involves institutions, legal and religious codes, etc. Che- nier translates the technical manipulation of the textual machine into the prepositions of the emblem. The prepositions do not merely relate semantic units into larger units of meaning; they also disarticulate and rearticulate them. Take the de which relates astonishment and knot as a subjective attitude toward an object of perception ("a single whole, astonished at the knot . . ."). Besides functioning to relate parts, the de makes the line into a self-reflexive commentary on the potential of knotting preposi- tions to produce wholes out of unrelated parts. It can also relate these semantic units in a very different way on which it provides a very</page><page sequence="28">E. S. BURT 237 different commentary, however. It can make the "single whole" into the object of an action for which the knot is the agent, thereby en- tirely changing the meaning of the adjective "astonished" to cracking or splitting (one of the significations of etonner): the phrase would then read: "a single whole, cracked by the knot."23 The preposition turns the sentence into a metacommentary on the capacity of knot- ting prepositions to fragment into parts the wholes that it assembles. A whole surprised at the knot that makes it a whole trembles by the selfsame knot. Or take another example among the many that could be found: the au that joins a woman's body, a forehead and an eagle. The preposition gives us at least two separate figures: the woman's body with the forehead of an eagle; the woman's body on the forehead of an eagle. To this could be added another relation: because "au front" is the place of conflict between two enemy members, it can be read as a battle line, a front, the interval or line where a conflict over interpretations is joined. The prepositions and joining intervals of the emblem are hyperac- tive. They seem to be producing and destroying meaningful struc- tures. They seem to be acting to try to undo the figure, to point to its enumerative ground. But in fact, the hyperactivity is really a simula- tion of production and destruction: it looks like someone is offering further knowledge of the systematicity of the text, when in fact all we get is accumulated instances of how one can make purely relational, grammatical terms mean. The group of technicians just offers more parts to the monstrous divinity of which it can proleptically make sense. Prepositions are not pre-positional to meaning in the emblem; they do not undo the anthropomorphism whereby both grammar and figure are translated into meaning. They simply provide added in- stances of how meaning can be made of functional, grammatical relations; they simulate, as a technical operation simulates, the oper- ation of the understanding. Nothing is happening here; nothing is getting destroyed, nothing is getting established. We are just watch- ing busy hands simulating the work of construction and destruction 23. Etonner, besides meaning "to cause a violent moral commotion by admiration or fear" also has a more literal meaning in French. It can mean "to produce a violent commotion, a trembling" of the sort that sometimes rocks Californian buildings. By the nineteenth century, it will have taken on the very technical meaning of "cracking something," (6tonner un diamant). The Petit Robert provides as synonyms fe1er, 16zarder: to crack, to split. The lizard is not a salamander at all. It is a fissure, an interval produced within an apparently seamless surface.</page><page sequence="29">238 Yale French Studies in order to enjoy the power to make sense of everything that an- thropomorphism offers.24 Drunken interpreters with stupefied fac- ulties are more clued in about the artifice of writing, and the power signs provide for making and undoing systems, but they are senseless to the danger clearly indicated by all the disarticulated body parts lying about. When the sage gives us the emblem as an allegory of textual undecidability, he does not give a religious code to live and make sense by, but a code to die by-in thought or in conscience. Understanding textual allegory as a "negative theology," or as free play with a linguistic machine is to misunderstand it. That is how the dead Egyptians understood the emblem; they knelt at the foot of what Chenier calls a "murderous idol" (396). The problem spills over into the meta-text of the French interpret- er as well, despite the comfortable distance of several thousand years from the text on which he comments. The body, the forehead, the scale, and the flank, are joined by "heady" to form the larger figure of a "heady .., body." Juxtaposition, abusive coupling, produces the larger figure here and makes the Egyptian text communicate with the French meta-text. The Frenchman is commenting on the emblem, but his commentary adds a new part of which the emblem makes sense. We cannot say he means to do this, since what he tells us is that the textual machine can produce meaning out of random juxtaposi- tions. We cannot say, however, that he does not mean this, since he also tells us that this machine can always be made to spin by any skilled technician with a grip on the mechanism. The beheading of the French interpreter, who starts to get confused with the dead Egyp- tians, is also figured by the text. The text gets stuck in a machinelike mode when we try to in- terpret its inhuman conflict in mythico-religious terms, as pointing to divine intention. It just keeps on spitting up new parts that join to make larger figures, and that join in the list of mutilated parts. So long 24. For example, in trying to determine what "child of the airs" modifies, one is faced with a dizzying number of possibilities: does it modify the eagle alone? Does it modify the woman's body with (or on) the forehead of an eagle, or at war with the eagle over territory at the front? Does it modify any thing at all, or, deserted child (enfant desert), dropped here to complete the line, does it only have the air of being a modifier? It might be a commentary on the poetic imagination, "child of airy fancy," or a com- mentary on the need for an artifice to fill out the rhyme, the "child of a musical air." "Child of (multiple) airs," it surely also reunites all these possibilities. "Desert child," it comments on its sterility and emptiness. A confusion of tongues can be heard in the very modifier that strikes the most satisfyingly harmonizing of notes.</page><page sequence="30">E. S. BURT 239 as one persists in thinking the inhuman way that texts engender meaning by random juxtaposition in terms of a negative theology or as the mere play of the signifier, one is stuck in this mode. Chenier analyses the Terror as an epoch when people were making like the Egyptians, that is, translating into meaningful human terms the undecidability of texts. The period was characterized by an at- tempt to come to grips with a textual problem that its only managed to literalize. The French commentary hints at who is identifying itself with the monstrous god: the people, in whose name the Revolu- tion was undertaken. "People" is a collective term for disparate mem- bers related by proximity; it is also a term that collects into a single whole, a body subjected to a single set of laws, a singular will. To understand "people" as a body, we have to forget about disparate peoples and understand its enemy members as members of a collec- tive body to which they are subject. The freedom of each individual member, however, depends upon each having the possibility of appro- priating, in private, for their own interests, the machinery of the state. This is fairly straightforward Social Contract, and is a figure for the textual problem of a collective term. The Terror takes the figure literally: individual people keep getting sacrificed so that the will of the people as a whole can reappear, and individual people keep appro- priating the mechanisms of power the concept "will of the people" provides.25 Chenier does not offer this textual allegory because he sits 25. The point could be supported by the analysis of various political articles, among which the aforementioned Les Autels de la peur, Avis au peuple frangais sur ses veritables ennemis, and Rfflexions sur 1'esprit de parti. De la cause des desordres qui troublentla France et arretentl'etablissement dela libertW states the problem to be one of misinterpretation. By an anthropomorphism with distinctly religious overtones, the people (defined as a public space or legal system of relations), are viewed as a body: "This Society of (Jacobins) has produced an infinity of others: towns, boroughs, villages, are full of them. Almost all obey the orders of the mother-Society, and entertain with her a very active correspondence. She is a body in Paris, and she is the head of a vaster body spread over France. It is thus that the Church of Romeplanted the faith and governed the world by congregations of monks.... A simple ambiguity was enough for everything. The constitution being founded on the eternal truth, the sovereignty of the people, all that had to be done was to persuade the forums (tribunes) of clubs that they are the people" (273-74). A finger is placed on a similar anthropomorphism humanizing the inhuman in the poems. The "warlike" (187) Iambes in particular are illuminating of the mechanical aspect masked by the appeal to the "body of the people." For example, in "Vouites du Pantheon, quel mort .. ." the personified guillotine weeps, seeks consolation and justice, tries to save France by calling its vassals to it by name. The machinery of decapitation is greased by the personification. In the name of "humanity," of patriotism, etc., it starts to decapi-</page><page sequence="31">240 Yale French Studies at the feet of the God Language and ignores "real" people, or because he takes pleasure in mere formal play. He offers it because texts always do offer such allegories, and because their misunderstanding in religious terms has consequences for "real" people. The only way to get the machine unstuck, since the anthropomor- phism is a step that cannot be undone by interpretation, is to recall the enumerative possibility that is the ground for the figure. In the tale from Hermes, it is by enumeration of the unintelligible em- blems, rather than by the attempt to understand them, that people topple the monstrous god and new discoveries are made: "Quelque peuple a la fin par le travail instruit / Compte combien de mot l'h&amp;- reditaire usage / A transmis jusqu'a lui pour former un langage." [Some people at last by work instructed / Counts how many words hereditary usage / Has transmitted to it to form a language.] Enumer- ation also turns out to be the key to the political allegory with which the fragment ends. Le passe du present est l'arbitre et le pere, Le conduit par la main, l'encourage, l'6claire. Les aleux, les enfants, les arrieres-neveux, Tous sont du meme temps, ils ont les memes voeux. La patrie au milieu des embuiches, des traitres, Remonte en sa memoire, a recours aux ancetres, Cherche ce qu'ils feraient en un danger pareil, Et des siecles vieillis assemble le conseil. [396] The past of the present is the arbiter and father, Conducts it by the hand, encourages it, enlightens it. Forefathers, children, grand-nephews, All are of the same time, they have the same wishes. The fatherland in the midst of ambushes, of traitors, Goes back in its memory, has recourse to ancestors, Seeks what they would do in like danger, And of the centuries grown old assembles the counsel. tate those who once made it function. Nor ought one to think that Chenier sees in the vengeance of the axe turned against its wielders a "just" solution. The guillotine is impartial. It does not stop calling roll. Whoever wields it in the name of justice be- comes subject to its justice: "You will save France. / For your arms la Montagne . . . / Le Gendre ... / Collot d'Herbois ... / More than one Robespierre, and Danton / Thuriot, and Chabot; at last the whole band; / And club, commune, tribunal; / But who can count them? I recommend them to you. / You will call the roll" (188).</page><page sequence="32">E. S. BURT 241 Take just one of the sententious statements that regulates the fatherland as it collects itself into a political unit: "The past of the present is the arbiter and father" [Lepasse dupresent estl'arbitre etle perel. This commonplace works as a true-false statement that assem- bles into one counsel, one piece of advice and one representative group, three distinct interpretations of the relation between present and past as a father-son relationship. 1) The past is the arbiter and father of the present, that is, it invented the model that the present imitates. This is the way that French classicism understood Greece. 2) The past of the present is arbiter and father, that is, the past in- vented by, belonging to, the present, fathers. The French interpreta- tion of Latinity as the inversion and satirizing of the Greek model is also represented. 3) The past of the present, by way of the ambiguous genitive, might also be the pastness that possesses the present, that makes it unintelligible to itself, that lives on in it, that obsesses it, that it cannot master. An Egyptian is also included on the counsel, as the forefather of the disjunction between action and meaning poten- tially repeated in the present. These are three interpretations of a single true-false statement, three ancestors to a counsel. But a fourth, and very different, translation can be found. The line actively asserts: the past is the arbiter and father, from the present, for the time being [Du present, le passe est Parbitre et le pere.] Other assemblies are possible, the true-false statement being simply the way the present has decided to understand the relation. An exchange among sons of the advice given by Greek, Roman, and Egyptian an- cestors is just the rule by which, for the present, things are to be interpreted. The rule thus shows a disjunction between the conserving true- false statement that governs interpretation within the counsel, and the inventive, active writing which imposes the code on the present. The rule regulates the disjunction: for there to be a present, for the fatherland to appear, one has to forget about the arbitrariness of the inventive fiction. On the other hand, as a willful fiction, the rule enrolls itself on the list as an already-past rule that can be subverted by a critique recalling its fictional origins. The decree, "Let the past be arbiter, for the present" signs up as one in a series of other arbitrary rules. Chenier's politics are not a party politics, however closely a pas- sage like this one might seem to associate him with the constitu- tionalism of the moderate Feuillants. He is explaining that, for there</page><page sequence="33">242 Yale French Studies to be a political space, and not a religious one, a violent imposition of a fiction has to take place and be forgotten. But he is also explaining that that fiction can always be shown to be a repressive fiction, an arbitrary and violent decision about an undecidable relation, and as such, can be subverted by any text that recalls writing's materiality. The political emerges by way of undecidability, be it as a strategy for making use of undecidability to impose an interpretative law, or as a critique that recalls undecidability to topple worn-out fictions. The poet separates himself from the scribes of the second stage of Egyp- tian writing, the political hands who hid the violence of the fiction regulating the state. He, unlike the scribes, has written his rule on the list of falling idols. Chenier, the political thinker, concerned with peace inside the house, tells us that, for the fatherland to be con- vinced of its stability, it has to forget about the violence of the rule. But Chenier, the poet, is critical of the arbitrariness of such laws. The fiction of humane familial relations drawing together pious sons in the fatherland is a mask for a machinery anything but humane. The political thinker is at his most revolutionary in his poems. Two distinct reasons, both of which touch upon the political, emerge to explain why Chenier did not publish his fragmentary po- etry. He may have wanted to cordon off the dangerous productivity of textual allegories. His understanding that people tend to read poetic language in mytho-religious terms, romantically, as translating for- mal structures and figures into single totalities expressive of a divine artist's intention could very well be one reason for what amounts to an act of self-censorship. But there is another, and perhaps more com- pelling reason. An invisible hand offers us poetry by a posthumous author; the "thinking lines" of "antique verse" never do appear as the lyric songs of a human author, but always as the legacy of writing itself. They cannot be thought as expressive, lyrical language; they are always thinking along the lines of the political.</page></plain_text>
