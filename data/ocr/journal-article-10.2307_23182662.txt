The two white marble pilasters (figs. 3-4) dating to the early sixteenth century are the product of the diffusion of Renaissance architectural ornament in Sicily. This type of decoration, derived directly from the heritage of classical Rome, developed in the principal centers of the Italian peninsula and then spread to Sicilv through the activity of "foreign" artists who established themselves above all in Palermo and Messina. In some cases, such architectural orna ment mav have been acquired by Sicilian patrons directly from Italian centers, particularly the famous quarries of Carrara in Tuscany. However, there is no reason that the pilasters could not have been produced in Palermo, considering the large number of sculptors from Lombardy, Tuscany, and other areas of the peninsula who worked steadily in the Sicilian capital from the second half of the fifteenth centurv. There is no doubt, however, about the Sicilian provenance of the four other pieces: two panels (figs. 1-2) and two pediments (figs. 5-6). They exhibit the characteristics of the type of poly chrome marble decoration produced exclusively in Sicily during the baroque period, which, as will be discussed below, is clearly distinguishable from Italian works of the same time. It is also possible, based purely on stylistic considerations, to relate the panels to the decorative style of late seventeenth-century Palermo; the pediments are certainly linked to a later phase that developed in the Sicilian capital during the first half of the eighteenth century. The origin of these six marbles in the artistic environment of Palermo is supported by their place of acquisition. All the pieces were bought in Bagheria, a small center several kilometers from Palermo. The area of the present-day town was substantially rural until the end of the eighteenth century; known as "Bagaría," the site was chosen by the aristocracy of Palermo as a desirable place for the construction of their country residences. Most of the great pleasure villas still found throughout the region date from the early 1700s and constitute</page><page sequence="2">one of the most important architectural phenomena of eigh teenth-century Sicily. Because Bagheria was a country retreat, it was not a center of artistic production, and therefore all that was constructed there in the seventeenth and eighteenth cen turies was first planned or executed in Palermo or created by artists who came from Palermo. It is unlikely that all six ele ments derive from one particular building in Bagheria. The pilasters were created well before substantial architectural construction began there. The panels certainly come from a church, as evidenced by the figures of iVgnus Dei and the Pelican in Her Piety (a pelican that feeds her young with drops of blood, a symbol of Christ the Redeemer). Their form and dimensions seem to be conceived for a fairly large church, which would not have existed in Bagheria at the time they were created, and they are difficult to relate to any of the small chapels found in the villas. Only the pediments could conceiv ably have been used in a residence, perhaps as overdoors. The possibility that the pieces were dismantled from one or more buildings in Palermo and brought to Bagheria where they were sold cannot be excluded.

Marble Architectural Decoration in Palermo, Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries In the mid-fifteenth century, Palermo was once again the most important center of Sicily, rivaled only by Messina. The Sicilian ruling class was concentrated in Palermo, where its members established residence while maintaining contact with the country estates that were the sources of their tides and incomes. A group of wealthy merchants and bureaucrats, newly entitled by the ruling Aragonese authorities, now competed with the long established barons for authority and power. After the death of King Alfonso of Aragón in 1458, work came to a halt at the construction site of the marble Arch of Castelnuovo in Naples, causing the dispersal of the artists who had gathered there. Among them was the Lombard sculptor Domenico Gagini (ca. 1420-92) who arrived in Palermo about 1460 in search of work. In 1463 he was commis sioned by Pietro Speciale, baron of Alcamo and Calatafimi, to build a funer ary chapel of Carrara marble for his son Antonio.1 The chapel, built in the tribune of the church of San Francesco d' Assisi, was dismantled in the sixteenth century. Nevertheless, Gagini's contribution to San Francesco has emblematic value for the history of Sicilian art, for it repre sents the first known work in Palermo designed according to the new rules of classicism and is a testimony to the openness on the part of Palermo's cultivated ruling class to Renaissance Figure 3 Sicilian?

Pietro Speciale's initiative in com missioning the work of a humanist artist was followed by that of another illustri ous member of Palermo's ruling class, Antonio Mastrantonio, who entrusted the building of his private chapel (1468-69) in the same church of San Francesco d'Assisi to the Dalmatian sculptor Francesco Laurana,2 who worked in Sicily from 1467 to 1471. For several decades, however, the new classical vocabulary was primarily applied to sculpture and painting," and architecture was affected only in the area of funerary decoration and in the form of decorative inserts.4 Gagini's workshop took maximum advantage of the opportunities available in Sicily, thanks to the growing interest of the ruling class in the new Renaissance style, which offered a fashionable means of affirming cultural and social prestige. The many commissions for chapels in aristocratic homes as well as altars, altarpieces, tabernacles, and door and window frames not only established Gagini's workshop but prompted the arrival in Palermo of numerous sculptors and stonecutters, principally of Lombard or Tuscan origin.5 The migration of sculptors from these two regions, espe cially from Lombardv, is a phenomenon that occurred simultaneously throughout most of Italv. Their works spread the language of classicism, yet were not necessarily linked to the more complex and radicallv innovative spatial and structural systems of Renaissance architecture. New sculptural and compositional criteria were closelv linked to the use of architectural orders, increasingly accompanied by decorative flat panels enhanced with bas-relief ornament. The Detroit pilasters (figs. 3-4) are a valuable example of this phenomenon. The for mal vocabulary of classical ornament, applied to pilasters and lintels, included grotesques, rinceaux, candelabra, and trophies, an aesthetic derived from Roman antiquity and found in monuments such as the Arch of the Argentarii in Rome, as well as in the private collections of antique objects that were multiplying in fifteenth-century Italy. The term "grotesque" derives from the word grotta and indicates the decorations copied from the underground ruins of ancient Rome where stucco and painted decora tions were discovered. The term refers principally to the pictorial vocabulary drawn from Nero's Domus Aurea of the first century A.D., which, as it was discovered in about 1480, exerted a great influence on Renaissance pictorial decoration. The iconographical repertory of grotesques includes a vast array of Figure 5 Sicilian (probably Palermo), Pediment, ca. 1700-1725; white and polychrome mar ble, 1.33 x 2.15 m (4 ft. 41/2 in. x 7 ft.

Reproduced in Di Marzo 1883, table IX. Bulletin of the Detroit Institute of Arts floral, human, and hybrid forms, as well as weapons and emblems. Spiraling rinceaux motifs, also part of the grotesque vocabulary, constitute one of the most diffuse elements of architectural decora tion in the classical style.6 The "cande labrum" motif wras a reinterpretation of monumental Roman candelabra: the antique candelabrum is often identified today by its components, which are a tripod foot, a shaft articulated in knots, and a flaming brazier at the top. Largely absent in the works of first-generation humanist artists such as Lorenzo Ghiberti, Filippo Brunelleschi, Masaccio, and Donatello, these decorative motifs began to spread during the second half of the fifteenth century, achieving great popularity in a short time. Increased interest in antique ornament was related to the dedicated research that humanist artists were conducting on the relics and ruins of classical Rome in their eagerness to learn the rules for the new art from the evidence of the antique. A record of their intense study and survey activity is preserved in the drawings that compose such celebrated graphic collections as the Codex Escurialensis (ca. 1491)7 and the notebooks of Giuliano da Sangallo.8 The employment of relief-decorated pilasters and lintels had a parallel development in the field of painting—in painted architecture, in the vertical framing elements of frescoes, and in the wooden frames of paintings. Architectural elements of this type are featured, for example, in the early works of Andrea Mantegna, such as the cycle of Saint James in the Ovetari chapel (1450-55) in Padua;9 Pinturicchio's decorations in the Piccolomini library (1502) of Siena cathedral; and the pilasters at the sides of Raphael's School of Athens (ca. 1510-12) in the Vatican. The diffusion of the bas-relief decorated panel in Sicily can be traced to the early production of Domenico Gagini10 and the works of his direct successors, such as Giuliano Mancino and his close col laborator Bartolomeo Berrettaro, both from Carrara.11 These two sculptors were probably the most active in the Palermo area between the death of Domenico Gagini (1492) and the return in 1507 of Gagini's son Antonello from Messina. Antonello Gagini (1478-1536) is considered the foremost representative of Renaissance sculpture in the first half of the sixteenth century in Sicily.12 It was thanks to the activity of Antonello Gagini that this type of decoration realized its most imposing and refined manifestation. An especially outstanding example is the grotesque panels for the marble tribune of Palermo cathedral (see fig. 7), one of the most monumental works of its kind in Renaissance Italy; Antonello was awarded this commission in 1507. The tribune was formed by a great frame, which included two orders of pilasters (for a total height of about twenty-one meters) and forty statues. The completion of the project occupied not only Antonello and his sons but numerous other artists who had gathered to work in the cathedral's sculpture workshop. During reconstruction of the cathedral in 1781, the tribune was dismantled and dispersed.13 In addition to the sculptors cited above, there remains a large group of practically unknown artists who were active along side or in competition with the Gagini workshop, among whom the author of the Detroit pilasters is probably to be found. The difficulty in identifying artis tic personalities in grotesque decoration is also due to the scarcity of information on fifteenth- and sixteenth-century sculpture and architecture, often known only through archival documents.14 Comparing the pilasters to similar works in Palermo and in the rest of Sicily, there do not appear to be any particular Figure 7 Reliefs of pilasters in Carrara marble decorated by Antonello Gagini (Sicilian. 1478 1536) for the tribune of Palermo cathedral, first half of the 16th century (no longer extant).

The authorship of sculptors active in the fifteenth century, as well as that of Antonello Gagini, whose treatment of decorative elements is easily recognizable, must be excluded. However, this anonymous artist certainly was a capable sculptor active in the first decades of the sixteenth century, perhaps one in contact with Gagini during work on the tribune of the cathedral. In the delicate extension of the candelabrum motif there are refined quotations of the classical vocabulary, such as the birds among tendrils and the music-making cupids, elements that are fairly common in Italy but rare in the area of Palermo. Also interesting are the metaphoric references to fire, represented by the dragon and brazier placed at the top of one of the pilasters (fig. 4), and to water, symbolized on the other pilaster (fig. 3) by the fountain supported by dolphins and the waves under the tripod foot. The dimensions of the pilasters (2.64 by .68 meters, or 8 feet 8 inches by 2 feet 3 inches) could apply to a vast array of works (altars, funerary monuments, tabernacles, window frames, altarpieces, etc.) and are therefore not helpful in identifying their original role. With the passage of the sixteenth centu ry, the use of grotesques in architectural decoration tended to diminish drastically in favor of a more severe decorative vocabulary. Architectural writers of the second half of the sixteenth century, intent on standardizing architectural elements, probably played an important role in this change. It is significant that a panel decorated with a bas-relief can delabrum is reproduced (and therefore legitimized) together with the canonical classical orders in Cesare Cesariano's 1521 edition of De architectura, written by Vitruvius in the first century A.D., wrhile it was totally excluded by the most authoritative architectural writers of the later sixteenth century, such as Andrea Palladio, Giacomo da Vignola, and Sebastiano Serlio. In Sicily, use of these motifs tended to linger because of the fundamentally conservative attitude of Antonello Gagini's successors.15 The decorative vocabulary of candelabrum and grotesque decoration continued to be used, especially in Palermo, throughout the 1500s and eventually served as a formal basis for seventeenth-century decora tions in polychrome marble. Polychrome Marble Architectural Decoration in Palermo, Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries During the second half of the sixteenth century, the urban streets and open spaces of Palermo underwent a substantial reconfiguration, reflecting a renewed vitality of social and political life in the city. These ambitious initiatives were accompanied by intense construction activity, both civic and religious, tied to the social restructuring that had begun with the consolidation and expansion of the aristocratic ruling class and parallel ecclesiastical bodies. Thus, the period's architecture came to reflect the complex interplay of competition between the old nobility and the more numerous new aristocracy, between the traditional Catholic orders (Benedictines, Dominicans, Franciscans, etc.) and the rapidly expanding new orders of the Counter Reformation (Jesuits, Theatines, Philippines, etc.). Above all, it was reli gious construction between the second half of the sixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth that changed the old urban fabric of Palermo. Ambitious projects, encouraged and in part financed by the aristocracy, resulted in the loss of many medieval churches, which were incompatible with Renaissance architecture, with the new functional Figure 8 Sicilian, church of the Gesü a Casa Professa, Palermo; chapel of the Holy Confessors, lateral arch, 1630s.

This final point led architectural ornament to assume a particular significance; the new decorative style became one of the primary expressions of the baroque vocabulary in Palermo. With dense compositions of contrasting color, light, and shadow, decoration developed in the course of the seventeenth century, especially in ecclesiastic interiors, and in many cases assumed a primary role as definer of space. This tendency toward architectural "decorativism" gave rise to a distinct type of ornamentation that was extraordinarily fertile and character istic of the region: the development of mosaic inlay and relief decoration in polychrome marble, called marmi mischi a tramischi, constituted one of the salient phenomena of seventeenth-century art in Palermo. The term mischi, or "variegated," in peninsular Italy indicating the generic use of colored marble as well as some types of stone and bresciated marble,16 acquired new meaning in Sicily during the course of the seventeenth and eigh teenth centuries. It was used to describe marble decoration composed of intarsiated polychrome inlays arranged in a dense interplay (mischi) and, later, the poly chrome decoration of sculptural reliefs (tramischi). The support for the inlaid pieces was a slab of white Carrara marble on which the design was traced and then carefully hollowed out to receive individual tesserae of colored marble; the portions of the base that were to remain white were left untouched. The marbles used for the inlay were all of Sicilian origin, with the exception of black stone, which was imported from La Spezia, southeast of Genoa. Experimentation with this type of marble decoration was concentrated in Palermo and Messina; within the span of a few decades, these cities had become the Sicilian centers for the elaboration and production of baroque decorations in polychrome marble.17 The development of this form of decoration in Palermo progressed slowly through several phases.18 The first works, limited in number, consisted of tombstones and sarcophagi made of white Carrara marble and inlaid with colored marble tesserae cut in rigid geometric forms, produced from the end of the sixteenth through the first decades of the seventeenth century. Sculptors of Tuscan and Lombard origin introduced this technique to island craftsmen. Once again, therefore, Sicily found itself sub jected to the influences of a decorative culture that had first developed and spread on the Italian peninsula.19 Unfortunately, some of the earliest important works by Tuscan and Lombard artists have been lost.20 It is therefore necessary to consider slightly later examples from the 1620s which were substantially based on the use of simple geometric figures.21 Well distanced from more opulent Sicilian baroque decoration, these works show no local characteristics. After an initial popularity, the use of colored marble ornament with geometric motifs seems to have been progressively abandoned in favor of polychrome marble inlays derived from classical grotesque forms, both anthropomorphic and floral. The vocabulary that had been widely diffused in Sicily during the preceding century was now expressed in new materials. The fragmentary decoration of the Grotta of Santa Rosalia in the Sanctuary of Monte Pellegrino in Palermo, designed by Sicilian architect Mariano Smiriglio, Figure 10 Sicilian, church of the Gesii a Casa Professa, Palermo; pilaster of the cross-vault, 1670s, detail.

The decoration of the chapel of the Holy Confessors in the church of the Gesu a Casa Professa, from the early 1630s, is even more revealing. If one observes the small pilasters of the lateral arcade (fig. 8), it is clear how this decorative project grew from the reworking of the panels by the addition of polychrome to white marble grotesques. As discussed above, such colorful expressions of classical decora tion had already been widely realized in painting, and it is possible that it was the painting medium that first suggested the choice of colors.22 A tradition in polychrome glazed terracotta had been initiated by the Tuscan workshop of the della Robbia, but the idea of translating flat architectural areas into decorative panels with colored marble inlay and bas-relief ornament, drawing on the vast decorative repertory of the grotesque, was probably a Sicilian innovation. The local preference for this type of decora tion proved a definitive and enduring aesthetic choice, independent of contem porary Roman taste, which instead regu larly favored abstract geometrical motifs.23 There remained for some time, however, points of contact with the formal reper tory adopted in Neapolitan works or in other limited spheres, such as certain Genoese altars. Possible relations with Naples, which after Sicily was the most important Italian center for the use of polychrome marble decoration during the seventeenth centurv, have been a subject of study,24 but the Neapolitan ornamental vocabulary appears to have exerted only a sporadic influence on Sicilian decoration. Marble ornament in Palermo was fundamentally different from that of Naples in several respects. The seven teenth-century' Neapolitan environment was largely dominated bv the activity of the Lombard Cosimo Fanzago. An architect and sculptor of the highest level, Fanzago was also the undisputed master of polychrome marble decoration in the ecclesiastical interiors of the Neapolitan region.25 The distinctive treatment of his work in marble in tarsia included a tendency toward stylized floral themes, often resulting in an abstraction unrelated to the classical tradition. In Palermo, exactly the opposite was true: while designs became increasingly complex, with lively new additions to the ornamental repertory, an interest in Renaissance vocabulary inspired by natural forms remained a constant throughout the seventeenth century.26 Still greater divergences between the decorative culture of Naples and that of Palermo can be traced to the architectural use of polychrome marble. In Naples, stone intarsia in small works, such as chapels and altars, often devel oped into a dense, tangled intertwine that covered the entire surface.27 The intarsia was limited, however, when used in larger settings, ceding its place to broad uninterrupted slabs of marble with mosaic nuclei in the center of the flat mirrorlike surfaces of the architectural structure (as in the church of the Certosa of San Martino, decorated by Fanzago). The decorative partem never attained the role of qualifying element for large architectural spaces as it did in Palermo. This purely Sicilian tendency to define architectural structures with marble intarsia may already be seen in the works of the sculptor Carlo d'Aprile (died 1668); in the entry pilasters of the chapel of the Holy Virgins in the church of the Gesu (1653); and in the end wall of the church of the Concezione al Capo (i 65 5-6°), where the intricate play of tesserae is extended in a manner unrelat ed to the decorative function of marble intarsia in Naples. The definitive separation from contem porary decoration in Naples and on the Italian peninsula was achieved in the 1660s through experiments conducted by the architect and sculptor Gaspare Figure 12 Sicilian, church of the Gesü a Casa Professa, Palermo; pilaster of the lateral nave with dol phin motif, 1690-1700, detail; workshop of Baldassare Pampilonia (active 1680-1700) and Giovan Battista Ferrera (active 1680-1700), based on a design attributed to Lorenzo Cipri (1639-1702). Guercio, creator of marble installations in the chapels of Saint John the Baptist in Sant' Ignazio aH'Olivella (attribution of Donald Garstang);28 of Gravina and the altar of San Gaetano (1668) in the church of San Giuseppe dei Teatini; and of the Oneto-Sperlinga Chapel in San Domenico (begun 1664). These works of marble intarsia, the design of which had reached maximum complexity, were combined with dense sculptural relief, so that the walls became particularly sensitive to light and seemed to dissolve. Such an extensive use of marble relief sculpture in the walls is not seen else where in Italian decorative art of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Gianlorenzo Bernini's decoration of the pilasters of Saint Peter's in Rome provides an important contrast to the decoration realized several years later in Palermo for the pilasters of the church of the Gesu. The Roman master conceived of the sculptural insert as a plastic inter val within the smooth mirror surface of the pilaster. In Palermo, relief and inlay suffuse the entire surface of the pilaster, Figure 12 Sicilian, church of the Gesü a Casa Professa, Palermo; pilaster of the lateral nave with dol phin motif, 1690-1700, detail; workshop of Baldassare Pampilonia (active 1680-1700) and Giovan Battista Ferrera (active 1680-1700), based on a design attributed to Lorenzo Cipri (1639-1702).</page><page sequence="9">Bulletin of the Detroit Institute of Aits Figure 13 Sicilian, church of the Gesú a Casa Professa, Palermo; apse decora tion, 1700-1710, detail; Gioacchino Vitagliano (1669-1739), based on models by Giacomo Serpotta (1656-1732). fusing ornament into the architectural structure. The decorative sculpture is not assigned a complementary role but functions as the defining element of the wall surface and therefore of the interior space. It is this unique use of decorative relief and inlaid marble tesserae as a means of qualifying architectural space that makes Palermo's style of ornament so remarkable (see fig. 9). While didactic themes recurred in reli gious decoration produced in peninsular Italian centers, they were expounded with a more relentless consistency in Sicily. Strong theological considerations shaped the choice of every project (almost always awarded to architects belonging to the clergy), making architectural decoration a universal instrument for the communication of Catholic princi ples. This message, sometimes clear and immediate, sometimes complex and not easily comprehended, adapted itself to the different levels of understanding of those using the ecclesiastical space. Sculptural relief and semantic meaning were increasingly emphasized between the 1680s and the 1720s, so that occa sionally inlay was almost totally substi tuted by relief and purely decorative imagery was transformed into symbolic figures or representations of biblical events.29 The interior decoration of many Palermo churches dates from this period, including the vast decorative complexes of the churches of the Gesü a Casa Professa, of Santa Maria in Valverde, of Concezione al Capo, of Santa Caterina and of Santissimo Salvatore, in addition to the chapels of the Rosary in Santa Cita and of the Immaculate Conception in San Francesco d' Assisi.30 The two Detroit panels (figs. 1-2) also date from this period and are important representative examples of religious decoration in late seventeenth-century Palermo, illustrating the individuality of the local culture. The form and dimensions of the panels suggest that they come from the pedestal or lower portion of the pilasters of a large church. Panels of this type were executed for the church of Santissimo Salvatore and for that of the Gesü (see fig. 10). It is practically impossible to establish accu rately the original location of the panels: numerous Palermo churches have under gone extensive remodeling designed to eliminate exactly this type of decoration, which was considered decadent through out the nineteenth century. Other churches have been destroyed, and their interiors remain practically unknown. The panels could possibly have come from San Giuliano, for example; the pilasters of this church, razed in 1875, were compatible with the dimensions of the panels.31 Undeniably, the figures of the panels fit within the iconographical repertory of the period. In particular, the Pelican in Her Piety was a popular image of the day, and numerous examples can still be found in the churches of Palermo (see fig. 11). The dolphin motif was popular as well, to be found, for example, in the many pilasters of the church of the Gesü a Casa Professa (fig. 12). The principal designers of marble installations in the last two decades of the seventeenth cen tury were the Jesuit architects Lorenzo Cipri and Angelo Italia and the architect Paolo Amato of Ciminna. It was the latter, however, who assumed a central role in the city's artistic circles. A cultured writer and capable architect, Paolo Amato (1634-1714) was the author of various marble decorations as well as a designer of stucco ornament and, as holder of the title of architect of the Senate, the creator of ephemeral decora tions for city festivals. The exuberant, intricate, and exaggerated decorative motifs, already typical of seventeenth century Sicilian culture for several decades, reached their maximum development in Amato's work, in which decorations were characterized by a plasticity that negated structure, in opposition to classical principles. This erudite artist's apparent distance from the main tenets of Italian artistic culture, especially that of Rome, should probably be interpreted as an assimilation of Spanish decorative themes. It is worth mentioning that Paolo Amato collabo rated on the completion of the church of San Giuliano in 1679. Although there is no documentary proof, it is possible that he designed polychrome marble decora tions for the interior, perhaps to be identified with the Detroit panels. This hypothesis, while plausible, is purely conjectural. The large-scale production of poly chrome marble decorations of the period was in the hands of artisans who, while capable of executing complex decorative motifs, were pedestrian modelers of fig Figure 13 Sicilian, church of the Gesü a Casa Professa, Palermo; apse decora tion, 1700-1710, detail; Gioacchino Vitagliano (1669-1739), based on models by Giacomo Serpotta (1656-1732).</page><page sequence="10">.1 larl'le Architectural Decoration in Sicily, Fifteenth to Eighteenth Century ures. Among the decorators most active at the end of the seventeenth and begin ning of the eighteenth century was the sculptor and marble worker Baldassarre Pampilonia,32 whose limited ability as a relief carver and sculptor revealed his early training in stonecutting workshops and resulted in works that were often rigid and void of expression. Modeled figures remained at generally mediocre levels in this period and are of interest only as an integral part of a complex and original decoration. Within the horror vacui exhibited in marble decoration, new elements already began to appear in the 1680s, destined to bring radical change to the city's artistic vision. The religious architect Giacomo Amato (1643-1732) returned to Palermo in 1685 after a long residence in Rome and immediately became involved in various construction sites in the city. At the same time, the art of Giacomo Serpotta (1656-1732), who is considered a European master of stucco and statuary, began to exert an important influence, eventually dominating Palermo's artistic environment for more than half a century, either directly or through the activity of his son Procopio.33 The activity of these artists introduced new compositional principles to the local decorative style, and the knowledge and reworking of Roman themes played an increasingly important role. Giacomo Amato and Giacomo Serpotta had a great capacity for invention, however, and their art revealed no sterile obedi ence to Roman style. Within a few years, Palermo's artistic environment was dominated bv a refined elite that orbited about the charismatic figures of Amato and Serpotta: the painter Antonino Grano, the sculptor Gioacchino Vitagliano, the engineer Gaetano Lazzara (a student of Paolo Amato but later a collaborator of Giacomo Amato), the Roman-trained Giovan Battista Ragusa, and Procopio Serpotta. The happiest results of the collaboration of this group of artists are to be found in the stucco and frescoes of the vault of the church of the Pietá (begun 1708), in the spectacular marble complex of the apse of the Gesü (1703-21), and in much of the decoration of the church of Santa Caterina (1705-31). In these works, the extravagant decorativism of the local seventeenth-century culture assumed more controlled tones through the reworking of the formal vocabulary and the drastic reduction of vibrant color and chiaroscuro. Serpotta's intense activity was influential in causing artisans' early training in stonecutting to be replaced with instruction in the principles of seventeenth-century Italian baroque sculpture. Although his activity was exclusively as a stuccoist, Serpotta was often called to execute clay models for sculptors, in particular for Gioacchino Vitagliano (1669-1739), his brother-in-law, who was probably the first accomplished sculptor of early eighteenth-century Palermo and whose sculptural ability quickly surpassed that of his direct predecessors, such as Baldassare Pampilonia and Giovan Battista Ferrera. Another talented sculptor was Giovan Battista Ragusa (died 1727), who according to contemporary chroniclers had trained in Rome and was a student of Pietro Papaleo (a follower of Bernini) and Pierre le Gros the Younger.34 One of these two artists, Vitagliano or Ragusa, was most probably the sculptor of the Figure 14 Sicilian, church of Santa Maria deil'Ammiraglio, Palermo; decoration of the presbytery, ca. 1720; attributed to Gioacchino Vitagliano (1669-1739), based on a design by Gaetano Lazzara (recorded 1702-31). Detroit pediments (figs. 5-6). These works may be dated within the first three decades of the eighteenth century and are certainly the fruit of the circle of Amato and Serpotta. Similar compo nents are to be found, for example, in the apse reliefs of the Gesü (fig. 13), based on designs of Serpotta and execut ed by Vitagliano, and in the decorations of the presbytery of Santa Maria dell' Ammiraglio (fig. 14), designed by Gaetano Lazzara about 1720. Much of the marble decoration of this latter church was dismantled during restora tions begun in 1870. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that can tie the Detroit pediments to the works that were removed from the church.35 The decorations developed by Giacomo Amato and his circle made way for a new taste, clearly established by the 1730s, which found earlier marble decorations unpalatable.36 The new style, character ized by greater geometric control, eschewed both naturalistic forms and didactic iconography, basic elements in the previous period. Clear, linear compositions were preferred and strong contrasts of color and light avoided: the contortion of three-dimensional forms was calmed, surfaces flattened, and heavy sculptural protrusions replaced by smooth and subtle profiles that extended along the walls, reorganizing the surfaces Figure 14 Sicilian, church of Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio, Palermo; decoration of the presbytery, ca. 1720; attributed to Gioacchino Vitagliano (1669-1739), based on a design by Gaetano Lazzara (recorded 1702-31).</page><page sequence="11">y2 Bulletin of the Detroit Institute of Arts into a paneled system of marble slabs. The sculptural element, eliminated almost completely from wall decoration, was directed to independent relief figures, as if to reestablish distinctions between artistic media, in open contradiction to the earlier style. The marble decorations tended toward simpler, more rigorous forms, acquiring a more important decorative significance and no longer functioning as message-bearers of reli gious concepts. Abstract decorative motifs replaced the naturalistic forms that were the final manifestation of late baroque marble decoration in Palermo37 before the advent of neoclassical forms, present in the island capital from the 1760s. The dilution of pure local decorative forms in the first half of the eighteenth century was the result of the opening of Palermo's culture to the various manifestations of the late baroque in Italy and Europe. In many cases, however, the desire to eliminate the indigenous style through the rapid assimilation of a vocabulary deemed more sophisticated tended to rob local decorations of the originality they had once represented. In the course of the eighteenth century, a reaction against baroque art led to a series of remodelings that eliminated many examples of seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century architectural decora tion. Furthermore, work began in 1875 on the demolition of the church of San Giuliano in order to make room for a large new building, the Teatro Massimo. At the end of the nineteenth century, the extension of Via Roma destroyed many historic buildings in Palermo's center, including the church of Santa Rosalia, designed by Giacomo Amato. Probably as a result of this vast urban restructuring, some pieces of marble decoration were transported to Bagheria, where they were bought by William Salomon for the dec oration of his home in the United States, six of them eventually entering the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts.

In Sicily, this decorative motif may be found in works attributed to Gagini, such as the lateral portal of the church of Sant' Agostino in Palermo and the Area of San Gandolfo in the mother church of Polizzi Generosa.

The same abstract geometry, although employed in a totally different design, is seen in the chapel of the Crucifixion (begun 1623) in the church of Sant' Ignazio all'Olivella, designed by Mariano Smiriglio, the architect of the Senate, and in the marble decoration of the altar in the chapel of San Filippo Neri (1622) in the same church. 22 In the adaptation of painted wall panels, a black ground was often used, upon which a thick white decoration was extended, exactly as occurs in the polychrome marbles of Palermo. This is seen, for example, in the previously mentioned cycle by Pinturicchio for the Piccolomini library in Siena cathedral. If one excludes the isolated case of Borromini's Spada chapel. 24 See A.

This stylistic shift furthermore encouraged costly renovations in an attempt to eliminate the decorative installations of Paolo Amato and his circle, such as occurred in the churches of Santa Chiara and Santissimo Salvatore, as well as the presbytery of San Giuseppe dei Teatini and the transept of San Domenico. 37 Sculptors from the Pennino family and the family of Ignazio Marabitti, the leading sculptor of the late baroque period in Palermo, were active in this climate. Trained first by Gioacchino Vitagliano and then by Filippo della Valle in Rome, Marabitti monopolized the most prestigious sculpture commissions upon his return to Palermo (1745-46); of particular importance is the Ecce Homo chapel in the church of San Francesco d' Assisi, where the sculptor executed two large reliefs of the Flagellation and the Deposition.
