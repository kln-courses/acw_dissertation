<plain_text><page sequence="1">I.-EDUCATION AS A SCIENCE. (IV.)* I NOW proceed with the review of the Emotions, as motives in Education. Play of the Elmotions of Activity. Nothing, is more frequently prescribed in education than to foster the pupils' own activity, to put them in the way of discovering facts and principles for themselves. This position needs to be carefully surveyed. There is, in the human system, a certain spontaneity of action, the- result of central energy, independent of any feeliings that may accompany the exercise. It is great in children; and it marks special individuals, who are said to possess the active temperament. It distinguishes races and nationalities of human beings, and is illustrated in the differences among the animal tribes; it also varies with general bodily vigour. This activity would burst out and discharge itself in soine form of exertion, whether useful or useless, even if the result were perfectly indifferent as regards pleasure or pain. We usually endeavour to turn it to account by -giving it a profitable direction, instead of letting it run to waste or something worse. It expends itself in a longer or shorter time, but while any portion remains, exertion is not burdensome. Although the spontaneous flow of activity is best displayed and most intelligible in the department of muscular exercise, it applies also to the senses and the nerves, and comprises mental action as well as bodily. The intellectual strain of attention, of volition, of memory, and of thought, proceeds to a certain length by mere fulness of power, after rest and renovation; and may be counted on to this extent as involving nothing essentially toilsome. Here, too, a good direction is all that is wanted to make a profitable result. The activity thus assumed as independent of - feeling is nevertheless accompanied with feeling, and that feeling is essentially pleasurable: the pleasuire being greatest at first. The presence of pleasure is the standing motive to action; and all the natural activity of the system-whether muscular or nervous-brings an effluence of pleasure, until a certain point of depletion is arrived at. If, further, our activity is employed productively, or in yielding any gratification beyond the mere exercise, this is so much added to the pleasures of action. If, besides the delight of intellectual exercise, we obtain for ourselves the gratification of fresh knowledge, we seem to attain the full pleasure due to the employment of the intellect. # Continued from MIND, No. XI.</page><page sequence="2">452 Education as a Science. Much more, however, is meant by the gratification of the self-activity of the learner. That expressioni points to the acquiring of knowledae, as little as possible by direct comlMunication, and as much as possible by the mind's own exertion in workinig it out frdin the raw materials. We are to place the pupil as nearly as may be in the track of the first discoverer, and thus impart the stimulus of invention, with the accompanying outburst of self-gratulation and triumph. This bold fiction is sometimes put forward as one of the regular arts of the teacher; but I should prefer to consider it as an extraordinary device admissible only on peculiar occasions. It is an obvious defect inr teaching to keep continually lecturing pupils, without asking them in turn to reproduce anid apply what is said. This is no doubt a sin against the pupil's self-activity, but rather in the manner than in the fact. Listeniing and imbibing constitute a mode of activity; only it may be overdone in beino out of proportion to the other exercises requisite for fixing our knowledge. When these other activities are fairly plied, the pupil may have a certain complacent satisfactioni in his or her own efficiency as a learner, and this is a fair and legitimate reward to an apt pupil. It does not assume any independent self-suffieciency; it merely supposes an adequate comprehension and a faithful reproduLction of the knowledge communicated. The praise or -approbation of the master, and of others initerested, is a superadded reward. Notwithstanding, there still remains, if we could command it, a tenfold power in the feeling of origination, invention, or creation; but as this can hardly ever be actual, the suggestion is to give it in fiction or imagination. Now, it is one of the delicate arts of an accomplished instructor to lay before his pupils a set of facts pointino to a conclusion, and leave them to draw the conclusion for themselves. Exactly to hit the mean between a leap too small to have any merit, and one too wide for the ordinary pupil, is a fine adjustment and a great success. All this, however, belongs to the occasional luxuries, the bon-bons of teaching; and cannot be included under the daily routine. It is to be borne in mind that although the pride of origina- tion is a motive of extraordinary power, and in somie minds surpasses every other motive, and has a great charm even in a fictitious example, yet it is not in all minds the only extraneous motive that may aid the teacher. There is a counter motive of sympathy, affection and admiration for superior wisdom, that operates in the other direction; giving a zest in receiving and imbibing to the letter what is imparted, and jealously restraining any independent exercise of judgment such as would share the credit with the iinstructor. This tendency is no doubt liable to</page><page sequence="3">Education as a Science. 453 run into slavishness and to favour the perpetuation of error and the stagnation of the human mind; but a certain measure of it is only becoming the attitude of a learner. It accompanies a proper sense of what is the fact, namely, that the learner is a learner and not a teacher or a discoverer, and has to receive a great deal with mere passive acquiescence, before venturing to suggest any improvements. Unreasoning blind faith is indis- pensable in beginning any art or science; the pupil has to lay up a stock of notions before havinig any materials for discovery or origination. There is a right moment for relaxing this attitude, and assuming the exercise of independence; but it has scarcely arrived while the schoolmaster is still at work. Even in the higher walks of university teaching, independence is premature, unless in some exceptional minds, and the attempt to proceed upon it, and to invite the free criticism of pupils, does not appear ever to have been very fruitful.* Play of the Emotions of Fine Art. This is necessarily a wide subject, but for our purpose a few select points will be enough. The proper and principal end of Art is enjoyment; now whatever is able to contribute on the great scale to our pleasure, is a power over all that we do. The bearings on education are to be seen. The Art Emotions are seldom looked upon as a mere source of enjoyment. They are apt to be regarded in preference as a moral power, and an aid to education at every point. Never- theless, we should commence with recognising in them a means of pleasure as such, a pure hedonic factor, in which capacity they are a final end. Their function in intellectual education is the function of all pleasure when not too great, namely, to cheer, refresh, and encourage us in our work. There are certain general effects of Art that come in well at the very beginning. Such are symmetry, order, rhythm, * It would lead us too far, although it might not be uninstructive, to reflect upon the evil side of this fondness for giving a new and self-suggested cast to all reiceived knowledge. It introduces change for the mere sake of change and never lets well alone. It multiplies variations of form and phraseology for expressing the same facts, and so renders all subjects more perplexed than they need be ; not to speak of controverting what is established, because it is established, and allowing nothing ever to settle. Owing to a dread of the feverish love of change, certain works that have accidentally received an ascendancy, such as the Elements of Euclid, are re- tained notwithstanding their imperfections. The acquiescent multitude of minds regard this as a less evil than letting loose the men of action and revolution to vie with each other in distracting alterations, while there is no judicial power to hold the balance. It is a received maxim in the tactics of legislation that no scheme, however well matured, can pass a popular body without amendnment ; it is not in collective human nature to accept any- thing simpliciter, without having a finger in the pie.</page><page sequence="4">454 Education as a Science. and simple design and proportion; which are the adjuncts of tlle school, just as they should be the adjuncts of home life. Pro- portion, simple design, a certain amount of colour, are the suitable elements of the school interior; to which are added tidiness, neatness, and arrangement, among the pupils themselves; only this must not be worryiing and oppressive. In the exercises suited to infants, Time and Rhythm are largely employed. Of all the fine arts, the most available, universal and influential is Music. This is perhaps the most unexceptionable as well as the cheapest of human pleasures. It has been seized upon with avidity by the humani race in all times; so much so that we wonder how life could ever have beenl passed without it. In the earlier stages, it was united with Poetry, and the poetical element was of equal, if not of greater power than the musical accompaniment. As the ethical instructors of mankind have always disavowed the pursuit of pleasure as such, and allowed it only as subsidiary to morality and social duty, 'the question with legislators has been what form of music is best calculated to educe the moral virtues and the nobler characteristics of the mind. It was this view that entered into the speculative social constructions of Plato and Aristotle. Now, undoubtedly the various modes of music operate very differently on the mind; everyone knows the extremes of martial and ecclesiastical music; and fancy can insert many intermediate grades.* For the moment, a musical strain exerts immenise power over 'the mind, to animate, to encourage, to soothe and to console. But the facts do not bear us out in attributing to it any permanent mioral inifluence; nothing is more fugitive than the exciteme'nt of a musical performance. Excepting its value as a substantive contribution to the enjoyment of life, I am not able to affirm tllat it has any influence on education, whether moral or intellectual. Certainly, if it has any effect in the moral sphere, it has nonie that I can trace in the sphere of intellect. As a recreative variety in the midst of toil, it deserves every encomium. In those exercises that are half recreative, half educational, as drill and gymnastic, the accompaniment of a band is most * Plato, in the Republic, wishing to train a vigorous and hardy race, interdicted not simply the unfavourable musical strains, but the instruments most adapted to these. He permits only the lyre and the harp, with the panspipe for shepherds attending their flocks ; forbidding both the flute and all complicated stringed instriunents. Disallowing the lugubrious, passionate, soft, and convivial modes of music, he tolerates none but the Dorian and the Phrygian, suitable to a sober, resolute, courageous frame of mind; to which also the rhythni and movement of the- body is to -be adapted. (Grote's Plcato, III. 196.)</page><page sequence="5">Edcucation as a Scienoc. 455 stimulating. In the Kindergarten it is well brought in, as the wind-up to the morning's work. But music during ordinary lessons, or any -sort of intellectual work, is mere distraction, as -everyone knows from the experience of street bands and organs. Excess in the pleasures of music, like every other excess, is unfavourable to mental culture. But some of the most intel- lectual men that ever lived have been devotees of music. In the case of Luther it seems to have been incorporated with his whole being; Milton invoked it as an aid in poetic inspiration. These were men whose genius largely involved their emotions. But the musical enthusiasm of Jeremy Bentham could have no bearing on his work, farther than as so much enjoyment. Poetry is Music and a great deal more. Its bearings are more numerous and coinplicated. In the ruder stages of music, when it accompanied poetry, the main effects lay in the poetry. The poetic form-the rhythm and the metre-impresses the ear, and is an aid to memory; whence it has been transferred from the proper themes of poetry to very prosaic subjects by way of a ninemonic device. The subject-matter of poetry comprises the stirring, narrative, which is an enormous power in human life, and the earliest intellectual stimulus in education. Play of the Ethical Emotions. The feelings called Ethical, or Moral, from their very meaning are the support of all good and right conduct. The other emotions may be made to point to this end, but they may also work in the opposite direction. When the educator describes these in more precise and equi- valent phraseology, he generally singles out regard to the pleasure and displeasure of parents and superiors, together with habits or dispositions towards obedience; all which is the result of culture and growth. Any primitive feelings conspiring towards good conduct must be of the nature of the sympathies or social yearnings; which are called into exercise in definite ways, well known to all students df human nature. By far the most powerful stimulus to acts of goodness towards others, is good conduct on their side; whoever can resist- this, is a fit subject for the government of fear and nothing else. The law says ' Do unto others, as ye uould that they should do unto you'. The lower ground of practice is 'Do unto -others as tlhey do unto you'. This is as far as the very young, can reach in moral virtue. It is too much to expect in early years generous and disinter- ested impulses, unreciprocated. The yotung have little to call their own; they have no means. Their fortune is their free, unrestrained vivacity, their elation, and their hopes. If they</page><page sequence="6">456 Education as a Science. freely give up any part of this, it is in consideration of equiva- lent benefits. They are susceptible of being worked up to moments of self-renunciation, in which they may commit their future irrevocably, without knowing what they are about. But they cannot be counted on for daily, persistent self-restraint, willingly encountered, unless there be some seen reward, presenit or in the distance. It takes a good deal to bring any one even up to the point of fair and full reciprocity of services in all things. The Feelings as appealed to in Discipline. The survey that has now been made of the sensibilities of the b1mi-an mind available as motives, prepares for the consideration of Discipline in teaching. The instruietor finds that, in school momients and for school purposes, he has to restrain all the unruly impulses, and to overbear the sluggishness of the youthful nature. To suceeed in this requirement, many arts are employed, corresponding, to the wide compass of sensations aind emotions that agitate the human breast. The question how to maintain discipline among masses of h-uman beings is of very wide application, and is therefore the suLbject of a great variety of experimenits. In the wide field of moral control, it includes a principal function of government, namely, the repression of crime; a department that has lately received much attention. To collect all the lights furnished in each of the spheres where moral control has to be exercised, is to contribute to the illumination of each. There has, un- doubtedly, in former times been very great mismianagement in almost every one of the regions of repressive authority; in the state, in the family, and in the school, in all which an excess of lhuman misery is habitually engendered by badness in the manner of exercising control. It is perhaps in the family that the mischief is most widely spread and most baneful. By degrees we have become. aware of various errors that ran through the former methods of discipline, in the several institu- tiolns of the state, as well as in the family. We have discovered the evil of working by fear alone, and still more by fear of coarse, painful, and degrading inflictions. We have discovered that occasions of offence can be avoided by a variety of salutary arrangements, such as to check the very disposition to unruly conduct. We consider that a great discovery has been made in regard to punishments, by the enuinciation of the maxim that certainty is more important than severity; to which should be added, proportion to the offence. We also consider that by a suitable training, or education, the dispositions that lead to disorder and crime, can be checked in the bud; anld that until</page><page sequence="7">Education as a Science. 457 there has been room for such training to operate, the mind should not be exposed to temptation. We have beconle accustomed to lay more stress in cultivatiing the amicable relations of htuman beings, all which tend to abridge the sphere of injurious conduct on the part of individuals. The consideration of discipline in Education supposes the relation of a teacher to a class; one man or woman exercisilng over a body of pupils the authority requisite for the work in hand. Nevertheless, it is not lost time to advert, in the first instance, to the maxims pertaining to authority in gfeneral. Authority, government, power over others is not an end in itself; it is but a means. Farther, its operation is an evil; it seriously abates human happiness. The restraint upon free agency, the infliction of pain on individuals, the setting-up a reign of terror-all this is justified solely by the prevention of evils out of all proportion to the misery that it inflicts. This might seemi self-evident; but is not so. The deep-seated male- volence and lust of domiination in the human imiind makes the necessity of government a pretext for excesses in severity and repression; to which must be added the opportunity of preyingt uponl the substance of the governed. Mankinid have had their eyes gradually opened to this state of things; the philosophy of society now endeavours to formulate the linmits to authority, and to the einployment of repressive severities. Not only is it restricted to the mildest penalties that will answer its purpose; but its very existence has to be justified in each case. Authority is not necessary to every teaching relation. A willing pupil comina up to a master to be taught, is not entering into a relationship of authority: it is a mnere voluntary compact, terminable at the pleasure of each. There is no more authority over the assemblies of grown men to hear lectures, than over the worshippers at church, or the frequenters of the play. There is nothinig but the observance of mutual toleration and forbearance so far as requisite to the common good; if this were grossly violated, there would be an exercise of power either by the collective mass themselves, or by summoning the constable to their aid. No authority is lodged in the lecturer, preacher, or performer, to repress disturbances. Authority first appears in the family, and is thence transferred with modificationls to the school. It is between these two that the comparison is most suggcestive. The institutions, bb parent's authority is associated with sustenance, and has an almost unlimited range; it is tempered by affection, but this depends upon mutuality of pleasure-giving, and supposes a limited number. The teacher's authority has nothing to do with</page><page sequence="8">458 Education as a Science. sustenance, his is a duty undertaken for payment; it is sub- sidiary to the single object of teachina a definite anmount of knowledge; it wants the requisites of affection; the numbers are too great, and the mnutual concerni too restricted; but affection is not wholly excluded, and in certain well-marked cases it may play a part. On the other hand, the family and the school have some important agreements. They both deal with immature minds, for whom certain kinds of motives are unsuitable. Neither can employ motives that are applicable only to grown men and women; they cannot appeal to consequences in the distant and unknown future. Children do not realise a remote effect, and they fail even to conceive many things that will one day have great power over their conduct. To talk to them about riches, honours, and a good conscience is in vain. A half holiday is more to them than the prospect of becomiing head of a business. The position of immaturitv is attended with another pecu- liarity, namely, that the reasons of a rule cannot always be made apparent. Sometimes they can, if not to the younger, at least to the older children. This is a highly prized aid to obedience in every department of government. There are many important points of agreement in the exercise of authority in every sphere-the family, the school, the relation of master and servalnt, ruler and subject whether in the state at large or in any subordinate societies. For example:- (1.) Restraints should be as few as the situation admits of: the multiplication of grounds of offence is a great evil, and yet exceedingly natural. (2.) Duties and Offences should be definitely expressed, so as to be clearly ulnderstood. This may not always be possible to the full extent; but should be always aimed at. (3.) Offences should be graduated according to their degree of heinousness. This too needs clearness of discrimination and definite language. (4.) The application of Punishment is regulated according to certain principles, first clearly pointed out by Bentham. (5.) Voluntary dispositions are to be trusted as far as they can go. (6.) By organDisation and arrangement, the occasions of disorder are avoided. Quarrels are obviated by not permitting crowds, jostling, and collisions. Dishonesty is checked by want of opportunity; remissness, by the watchful eye and by definite tests of performance. (7.) The awe and influence of authorityis maintained by a certain formality and state. Formis and ritual are adapted to all the operations of law: persons in authority are clothedc witli</page><page sequence="9">Education as a Science. 459 dignity and inviolability. The greater the necessity of enforcing obedience, the more stern anid imposing is the ritual of authority. The Romans, the greatest law-griving people, were the most stately in their official rites. A small portion of fornmality should accompany the slightest forms of authority. (8.) It is understood that authority, with all its appurtenances, exists for the benefits of the governed, and not as a perquisite of the ruler. (9.) The operation of mere vindictiveness should be curtailed to the uttermost. (10.) So far as circumstances allow, every one in authority should assume a benig,n character, seekingc the benefit of those under him, using, instruction and moral suasion so as to stave off the necessity of force. The effect of this attitude is at its utmost, when its limits are clearly discerned, and never passed. (11.) The reasons for repression and discipline should, as far as possible, be made intellicible to those concerned; and should be referable solely to the general good. This ilnvolves, as a part of national education, a knowledge of the structure of society, as being a regulated reciprocity among, all its mnembers, for the good of each and of all.* * Whoever occupies a position of authority ought to be familiar witlh the general principles and conditions of Punishment, as they may be found set forth in the Penal Code of Bentham. The broad, exhaustive view there given will co-operate beneficially with each one's actual experience. I iake no apology for presenting a short summnary of his principles. After precisely defining- the proper endls of Punislhiment, Bentham marks the cases unmeet for Punishment. First, where it is groundless: that is, where there never has been any real misclhief (the other party consenting to what has been done), or where the misclhief is overweighed by a benefit of greater value. Second, where it is ineffccacious: including cases where the the penal provision has not come before the offender's notice, where he is unaware of the consequences of his act, or where he is not a free agent. Third, cases where it is unpr ofitable: that is, when the evil of the punislhmiienit exceeds the evil of the offence. (The evils of Punishnment, wlhich htave to be summed up and set against the grood, are (1) coercion or restraint, (2) the uneasiness of apprelhension, (3) the actual suffering, (4) the suffering caused to all those that are in symnpathy with the pezison punished.) Fouirtlh, cases wlhere Punishment is needless: as when the end can be attaine(d in some cheaper way, as by instruction and perssuasion. In this class, Benitliam specially inclucles the offences that consist in disseminating pernicious principles in politics, morality, or religion. These should hee iiiet by iinstruction and argument, ai(l not by the penalties of the law. Under what he calls the expense or frugality of Punislhnment, Bentlham irgres the necessity of presenting to the mind an adequate notion of whalt a punislment really is. Hence the advantage of punishments that are easily learnt, and remembered, anid that appear greater, and not less, than they really are. Next as to the main point, the measutre of Punishment. First, it shoulI be, such as clearly to outweigoh the profit of the offence: including lnot sinilply the imnmediate profit, but every advantage, real or apparent, that</page><page sequence="10">460 Education as a Science. The points of comparison and contrast between the school and family have been noted. The nmore special distinction of the school, as compared with relations of authority in general, is resolvable into its main object-Instruction, for which the con- dition that needs to be imposed is Attention and Application of mind, with a view to permanent intellectual and other inmpres- sions. To evoke, charm, cajole, comnpel this attitude, is the first aim in all teaching. The hostile influences to be overcome are such as plhysical inability and exhaustion, irksomenless in the wolk, diversions and distractions from other tastes, with the natural rebelliousiness of humani beings under autlhority. has weighed as an inducement to conmmit it. Second, the greater the m-ischief of the offence, the greater is the expense that it is worth while to be at, in the way of punishnment. Third, when two offences colmie into competition, the punishment for the greater should be such as to make the less preferred; thus robbery with violence to the person, is always punished more severely than simple robbery. Fourtlh, the punishment to be so adjusted, that for every part of the resulting mischief, a motive miiay be provided to restrain from causing it. Fifth, the punishnment should not be greater than is needed for these ends. Sixth, there should be taken into account the circunistances affectingthe sensibility of the offenders, so that the sanlepunlish- ment imiay not operate unequally; as age, sex, wealth, position. Seventh, the punishnment needs to be increased in nmagnitude as it falls short of certainty. Eighth, it must be further increased in magnitude as it falls short in point of proxinmity : penalties that are uncertain and those that are remllote, correspondingly fail to iinfluence the mind. Ninth, when the act indicates a habit, the punishment must be increased so as to outweigh the profit of the other offences that the offender may conmniit with impunity: this is severe, but necessary, as in putting down the coiners of base money. Tenth, when a punLishment well fitted in its quality cannot exist in less than a certain quantity, it may be of use to employ it, although a little beyond the measure of the offence : such are the punishments of exile, expulsion from a society, dismissal from office. Eleventh, this may be the case more particularly, when the punishmeent is a moral lesson. Twelfth, in adjusting the quantum, accoLnt is to be taken of the circulmstances that render all punishment unprofitable. Thirteenth, if in carrying out these provisions, anytlhing occurs tending to do more harm than the good arisinig from the punishment, that thing should be omitted. In regard to the selection of punishments, Bentham lays down a number of tests or conditions whereby they are fitted to comply with the foregoing requirements. First, is the quality of Variability: a punishment slhould have degrees of intensity and duration ; this applies to fines, corporal punishment, and imprisonment; also to censure, or ill-namle. Second, Equability, or equal application under all circumstances: this is not easy to secure ; a fixed fine is an unequable punishment. Third, Commen- sutrability: that is, punishments should be so adapted to offeices, that the offender may clearly conceive the inequality of the suffering attached to crimes of ditferent degrees of heinousness; this property can be grafted on the variable punishnments, as imprisonment. Fourth, Characteristicalness: this is where something can be found in the punishment, whose idea exactly fits the crime. Bentham dilates upon this topic, in order to discriminate it from the old crude method of an eye for an eye; cases in point occur abundantly both in the family and in the school. Fifth,</page><page sequence="11">Education, as a Science. 461 The arts of proceedingy are not the same for a single pupil, aiud for a class. For the single pupil, individuality may be studied and appealed to; for the class, individualities are not considered. The element of number is an essential feature; carrying with it both obstructions and aids, and deinanding a very special manipulation. It is in dealing with numbers that the teacher stainds dis- tinguished fronm the parent, and allied to the wider authorities of the State; exercising larger colntrol, encountering greater risks, aind requiring a more steady hand. With an indivi(lual pupil, we need only such motives as are personal to himself; with numbers, we are under the liarsh necessity of punrishing for example. Good physical surroundings are known to be half the battle. A spacious and airy building,; room for the classes to come to- gether and depart without confusion or collisioI: these are prime facilities and aids to disciuline. Next is organisation, or rmethod and orderly arrangement in all the movements; whereby each pupil is always found in the proper place, and the entire mass comprehended under the inaster's glance. To this follows the due alternation and remission of work, avoidinog fatigue and maintaining the spirits and the energies wliile the teaching, lasts. After thle exterlnals and arralngements come the Methods and Arts of Teaching, eonsidered as imparting lucidity to the ex- planations, and easing the necessary intellectual labour of com- prehension. If to this primre quality can be added extraineous interest or charm, so mueh the better; but not to be at the expense of clearness, the first condition of getting through the subject. The personality of the teacher may be in favour of hiis influi- ence; a likeable exterior, a winning voice and mainer, a friendly Exemplarity: this is connected with the impressiveness of a punishment; all the solemnities accompanying the execution increase this effect. Bentham, however, did not sufficiently consider the evils attending too great publicity, which have led to withdrawing puinishments firom the gaze of the nLultitude ; it being simply intimated that they have been carried out. Sixth, Frumcglity: or making punishments less costly to the State, as when prisoners are employed productively. Seventlh, Subserviency to Reformation: by weakening the seductive, and strengthening the preserving motives; as in giving habits of labour to the idle. Eighth, Efficacy in Iisablerment: as in deposition fronm office. Ninth, Subserviency to Compensa- tion: as by pecuniary inflictions. Tenth, Popularity. Bentharm lays much stress upon the popularity and unpopularity of punishments, wlherebv the public sympathy nmay work for or acainst the law ; when a punishment is unpopular, juries are reluctant to convict, aind public agitation gets up for remission of sentence. Eleventh, Simplicity of Description: under this head, Benthani commiients upon the obscure and unintelligible descriptions of the old law, as capital felony, prcrmunire. Twelfth, Remnissibility, in case of mnistake.</page><page sequence="12">462 Education as a Scieence. expression, when relaxing the sternniess of authority. This is the side of allurement or attraction; the other side is the stately, imposing, and dignified bearing, by whiclh the master can imper- sonate authority and be a standing memento to the evil-disposed of the flock. lt is seldom given to one man or woman to display both attitudes in their highest force; but wherever, and to whatever extent, they can be assumed, they constitute a barrier to disaffection and remissness. Any pro6minent displays of swagger and self-conceit operate against the teacher's influence, and incite efforts to take him down. It is possible to temper authority with an unassuming demeanour. Muich of course depends upon tact: meaning by that a lively and wakeful sense of everything that is going on. Disorder is the sure sequel of the teacher's failure in sight or in hearing; but even with the senses good, there may be absent the watchful emplovment of them. This is itselfa natural incapacity for the work of teaching ; just as an orator is sure to fail, if he is slow to discern the signs of the effect that he produces on his audience. A teacher must not merely be sensitive to incipient and marked disorder; he must read the result of his teaching in the pupils' eyes. That quietness of mianner that comes not of feebleness, but of restraint and collectedness, passing easily into energy when .required, is a valuable adjunct to discipline. To be fussy and flurried is to infect the class with the same qualities; unfavour- able alike to repression and to learning. Any mnistake, miscarriage, or false step, on the part of a teacher, is for the moment fatal to his ascendancy. Such things will happen, and they render undue assumption all the more perilous. The stress of the teacher's difficulty lies in the heavings of a mass or multitude. The working of human beings collectively, is wholly distinct from their individual action; a new set of forces and influences are generated. One man against a multi- tude is always in the post of danger. .As units in a mass, ever-y individual displays entirely new characters. The anti-social or malevolent passion-the delight in gaining a triumph-which is suppressed in the individual as against a more powerful in- dividual, is re-ignited and irflamed in company with others. Whenever a simultaiieo&amp;us charge is possible, the authority of a single person is as nought in the balance. It is often said that the teacher should get the collective opinion on his side should, in short, create a good class-opinion. It is easier to deserve success in this than to command it. The fear is that, till the end of time, the symipathy of numbers will</page><page sequence="13">Ediucation as a Science. 463 continue to manifest itself against authority in the school. There will be occasions when the infection of the mass is a stronghold of order, as when the majority are bent on attending to the work, and are thwarted by a few disturbers of the peace; or when they have a general symnpathy with their teacher, and merely indulge themselves in rare and exceptional outbursts. While a teacher's merits may gain for him this position of advantage, more or less, he is never above the risks of an out- break, and must be ready for the final resort of repression by discipline or penalties. He may still work by soothing applica- tions, gentle and kindly remonstrance; he may check the spread of disaffection by watchful tactics, and by showing that he has the ringleaders in his eye; but in the end he must punish. It is this position of constant preparedness for disorder, some- times in isolated ilndividuals, and sometimes in the mass, that demands an air and manner betokening authority, and carrying with it a certain ha?aeur and distance; the necessity for which is the stronger, as the warring elements are more rife. The discipline of numbers is impeded by two sorts of pupils: those that have no natural liking for the subject, and those that are too far behind to understand the teaching. In a perfectly- arranged school, both sorts would be excluded from a class. The foregoing considerations lead up to the final subject- Punishment; in administering which the practice of Education, as well as of other kinds of government, has greatly improved. The general principles of punishment have been already enounced. We have to consider their application to the school. But first a few words on the employment of Reward. Emulation.-P-izes.-Place-takin7 9g. All these names point to the same fact and the same motive -the desire of surpassing others, of gaining distinction; a motive that has already been weighed. It is the most powerful known stimulant to intellectual application; and where it is ill full operation, nothing else is needed. Its defects are (1) it is an anti-soclal principle, (2) it is apt to be too energetic, (3) it is limited to a small number, (4) it makes a merit of superior natural gifts. - It is a fact that the human intellect has at all times been. spurred to its highest exertions, by rivalry, contest, and the ambition of being first. The question is whether a more moderate pitch of excellence, such as befits average faculties, could not be attained without that stimulant. If so, there would be a clear moral gain. Be this as it may, there is no need to bring it forward prematurely, or to press its application at the beginning. In the infant stage, wlhere the endeavour is to draw</page><page sequence="14">464 Education as a Science. out the amicable sentiments, it is better kept back. For tasks that are easy and interesting, it is unnecessary. The pupils that possess unusual aptitude, should be incited to modesty rather than to assumption. The greater prizes and distinctions affect only a very small number. Place-capturing, as Bentham phrases it, affects all more or less, although in the lower end of a class position is of small consequence. Too often the attainments near the bottom are nil. A few contesting eagerly for being first, and the mass phlegmatic, is not a healthy class. Prizes may be valuable in themselves, and also a token of superiority. Small gifts by parents are useful incitements to lessons; the school contains prizes for distinction that only a small number can reach. The schoolmaster's means of reward is chiefly confined to approbation, or praise, a great and flexible in3trument, yet needing delicate manipulation. Some kinds of merit are so palpable as to be described by numerical marks. Next, in point of distinctness, is the fact that a thing is right or xvrono,, in part or in whole; it is sufficient approbation to pro- nounce that a question is correctly answered, a passage properly explainied. This is the praise that envy cannot assail. Most unsafe are phrases of cominendation; much pains is needed to make them both discriminating and just. They need to have a palpable basis in facts. Distinguished merit should not always be attended with paeans; silent recognition is the rule, the exceptions must be such as to extort admiration from the most jealous. The controlling circumstance is the presence of the collective body; the teacher is not speaking for himself alone, but directing the sentiments of a multitude, with which he should never be at variance; his strictly private judgments should be privately conveyed. Bentham's "Scholar-Jury Principle," althougll not formally recognised in modern methods, is always tacitly at work. The opinion of the school) when at its utmost efficiency, is tlie united judgment of the head and the members, the master and the mass. Any other state of things is war: although this too may be unavoidable. Punishment. The first and readiest, and ever the best, form of Punishment, is Censure, Reprobation, Dispraise, to which are applicable all tlle maxims above laid down for praise. Definite descriptions of definite failures, without note or comment, are a power to punish. When there are aggravations, such as downright carelessness, a damaging commentary may be added; but in using terms of reprobation-, still more strict regard has to be paid to discrimi- nation and justice. The degrees of badness, are sometimes</page><page sequence="15">Education as a Science. 465 numerical, as by the quantity of lesson missed, and the repeti- tion of inattention; this very definiteness literally stated is more cutting than epithets. Strong terms of reproof should be sparing, in order to be more effective. Still more sparing ought to be tones of anger. Loss of temper, however excusable, is really a victory to wrong- doers; although for the moment it may strike terror. Unless a inan is of fiendish nature throughout, 'he cannot maintain a consistent course, if he gives way to temper. Indignation under control is a mighty weapon. Yet it is mere impotence to utter threats when the power of execution is known to be wanting. There is nothing worse for authority than to over-vaunt itself; this is the fatal step to the ridiculous. Ptunishments must go deeper than words: indeed, the efficacy of blame depends on something else to follow. Bearing in mind what are the evil tendencies to be encountered in school discipline-want of application being the most constant-we may review the different kinds of penalties that have been placed at the disposal of the schoolmaster. The occasional aggravation of disorder and rebelliousness has also to be encountered, but with an eye to the main requisite. Simple forms of Disgrace have been invented, in the shape of shameful positions, and humiliating isolation. As appealing to the sense of shame, these are powerful with many, but not with all: their power varies with the view taken of them by the collective body, as well as with individual sensitiveness. They answer for smaller offences, but not for the greatest; they may do to begin with, but they rapidly lose power by repetition. It is a rule in punishment to try slight penalties at first; with the better natures, the mere idea of punishment is enough: severity is entirely unnecessary. It is a coarse and blunldering system that knows of nothing but the severe and degrading sorts. Detention from play, or keeping-in after hours, is very galling to the young; and it ought to suffice for even serious offences; especially for riotous and unruly tenadencies, for which it has all the merits of " characteristicalness ". The excess of activity and aggressiveness is met by withholding the ordinary outlets. Tasks or impositions are the usual punishment of neglect of lessons, and are also employed for rebelliousness; the pain lies in tlhe intellectual ennui, which is severe to those that have no liking for books in any shape. They also possess the irksomeness of confinement and fatigue-drill. They may be superadded to shame, and the combination is a formidable penalty. With all these various resources ing:eniously plied-Emulation, Praise, Censure, Forms of Disgrace, Confinement, Impositions- the necessity for Corporal Punishments should be nearly done 33</page><page sequence="16">466 Education as a Science. away witb. In any well-regulated school, where all the motives are carefully graded, through a lon.g series of increasing privations and penalties, there should be no cases but what are sufficiently m-iet. The presence of pupils that are not amenable to such1 means is a discord aind anomaly: and the direct remredy would consist in removing tlhem to some place where the lower natures are grouped together. Inequality of moral tone is as much to be deprecated in a class as inequality of intellectual advancemelit. There should be Reformatories, or special institutions, for those that cannot be governed like the majority. Where corporal punishment is kept up, it should be at the far end of the list of penalties ; its slightest applicatioll should be accounted the worst disgrace, and should be accompainied wvitl stigmatising forms. It should be regarded as a deep inijury to the person that inflicts it, and to those that have to witness it- as the heig,ht of shame and infamy. It ought not to be repeated wTith the same pupil: if two or three applications are not enouglh, removal is the proper couirse. The misfortune is that in the Nationial Schools, the worst and most neg&gt;lected natures have to be introduced: yet tlhey should not brutalise a whole school. Even when childreni are habituated to blows at home, it does not follow that these are necessary at school; parents are often unskilful, as well as hampered in all their circumstances, and emergencies are pressing; the treatment at school may easily rise above the conduct of the family. In many inistances the school will be a welcomiie lhaven to the clhildren of troubled homes; aiid lead to the generous response of good behaviour. In point of fact, however, the children of wretchedness are not always those that give trouble, nor is it the schools wlhere these are found that are most given to corporal punishments. The schoolmaster's miost wayward subjects come often from good families; and they are found in schools of the highest grade. There shouild be no difficulty in sencding away from superior schools all such as could not be disciplined without the degradation of flooging. * Testimonies are adduced from very distinguishecl men, to the effect that without flogging they would have done nothing. Melancthon, Johnson, Goldsmith, are aI1 quoted for a sentiment of this kind. We must, however, interpret the fact on a wider basis. There was no intermediate course in those days between spoiling and corporal punishment: lie that spared the rod hated the child. Many ways can now be found of spurring young and capable minds to application; and corporal punishment w-rould take an inferior position in the mere point of efficiency. It is not to be held that corporal punishment, to such extent as is permissible, is the severest form of punishment that may be administered in connexion with the school. For mere pain, a whipping would often be</page><page sequence="17">Education as a Science. 467 T'he Discipline of Consequences. The idea of Rousseau that children, instead of being pnnished, should be left to the natural consequences of their disobedience, has much plausibility, and is taken up at the present day by edu- cationists. Mr Spencer has dwelt upon it with great emphasis. One obvious limitation to the principle is that the results may be too serious to be used for discipline: children have to be protected from the consequences of many of their acts,. What is intended is, to free parents and others from the odium of being the authors of pain, and to throw this upon impersonal agencies, towards whom the child can entertain no resentment. But before counting on that result, two things are to be weighed. For one, the child rnay soon be able to see through the device, and to be aware that after all the pain is brought about by virtue of a wvell-laid scheme for the purpose: as when the unpunctual child -is left behind. The other remark is that, the personifying or anthropomorphic tendency being at its greatest in early years, every natural evil is laid to the door of a person known or unknown. The habit of looking at the laws of nature, in their crushing application, as cold, passionless, purposeless, is a very late and difficult acquirement, one of the triumphs of science or philosoplhy: we begin by resenting everything that does us harm; and are buit too ready to look round for an actual person to bear the brunt of our wrath. A further difficulty is the want of foresight and foreknowledge in children: they are unable to realise consequences when the evil impulse is upon them. This, of course, decreases by tinme; and according as the sense of consequences is strengthened, these become more adequate as a check to misconduct. It is then indifferent whether they are natural or ordained. Among the natural consequences that are relied on as correc- tives of misbehaviour in the family, are such as these: going with shabby clothes, from having spoilt a new suit; getting no new toys to replace those that are destroyed. The case of one child having to make reparationi to another for things destroyed, is more an example of Bentham's "characteristical" punishment. In school, the discipline of consequences comes in under the arrangements of the school for assigning each one's merit on an impersonal plan; the temper or disposition of the master being nowhere apparent. The regulations being fixed and understood, non-compliance punishes itself. A. BAIN. chosen in preference to the intolerable i-rksomeness of confinement during play or after hours, and of impositions in the way of drill tasks ; while the language of Icensure may be so cutting as to be far worse thani blows. What is maintained is that these other punishments are not so liable to abuLse, nor so brutalising to all concerned as bodily inflictions.</page></plain_text>
