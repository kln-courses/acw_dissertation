Shelley says, for example, that Poetry with music and beauty? II does not seem a simPle di" the reign of Charles II was "the period in [English] history" chotomy. But one thing is for sure: for Shelley freedom and which was "of the grossest degradation . . . when all forms in creativity are interpenetrable-one does not exist without which poetry had been accustomed to be expressed became the other-and together they engender the "progress of phi hymns to the triumph of kingly power over liberty and vir- losoPhy and civilization" (Shelley, Major, 638).

Here again, Shelley presents a combination of liberty If England were divided into forty republics . . . there is no and the arts.

Here again Shelley correlates liberty and poetry. But the rela tionship is expressed in two inverted presentations. First, The artistic and creative independence of Florence is Shelley says that if England were divided into republics, or exemplified in "that union of energy and of beauty which fashioned in the form or likeness of the medieval republican distinguish from all other poets the writings of Dante" (964). Italy of Dante's age, "each would produce philosophers and And in A Defence of Poetry, Shelley says that poets" (my emphasis added) of unsurpassed achievement. 104</page><page sequence="3">The implication here is that a liberated and independent so- cussion of freedom and creation there must also be a discus ciety, fashioned after the Italian city-state, "would produce sion of their antitheses. Perhaps it is not the exact condition philosophers and poets" and foster great flourishes of art and of freedom and independence that corresponds to artistic creativity. Then Shelley says that he sees in the "great writers creativity but rather the seeking after freedom that is the of [his] own age" the potential to act as "companions and companion to, and often nurturer of, poetry. Perhaps the forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condi- "evolution toward betterment," toward liberty and a flourish tion or the opinions which cement it;" and now he has articu- ing of the arts, is actually more fraught, lated a relationship where poets can be either "companions" or "forerunners," going either with or before this "beneficial The Triumph of Life is considered Shelley's poetic pali change," but not as a product of that change. He concludes node to Prometheus Unbound. Where, in Prometheus Unbound, that the "cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning, Shelley presents a clear "evolution toward" such "betterment" and the equilibrium ... is now restoring, or is about to be in the movement from being bound to unbound, The Tri restored." Upon initial reading statement appears structured umph of Life, in an unfinished state, is grounded firmly in the as a basic cause-and-effect: the cause being the "cloud of narrator's position of oppression under the tyranny of Life, mind discharging its collected lightning" and the effect being The Triumph of Life reflects Shelley's own point of view con the restoration of the "equilibrium between institutions and cerning the political and cultural situation in England—a opinions." But Shelley connects the two statements with the cultural climate in which censorship of artistic and political conjunction "and"—not "and thus," or "and so" or any other expression was commonplace and in which Shelley himself conjunctive clause that would indicate a definite relationship was ostrasized, even investigated by the Home Office for his of cause and effect. This leaves not only a great deal of room revolutionary and divergent sentiments, for ambivalence, but also a great deal of room for possibility. This statement of ambiguity and possibility illustrates Shel- In A Philosophical View of Reform, Shelley also refers to a ley's debt to David Hume s scepticism about causation; for, "restlessness of fervid power which expressed itself' in the Shelley was interested in Hume's idea that the human mind arts of the Italian city-state (Cameron et al. 964). This "rest can never really perceive cause and effect but rather develops lessness of fervid power" is embodied in The Triumph of Life as a habit in which it associates two contigious and sequentially Shelley articulates, in the deliberate terza rima of Dante and occurring events.

Shelley says: "A the evils they lament by the hypocrisy that springs from poet is the combined product of such internal powers as them," as he said in a letter dated June 29, 1822, contempo modify the nature of others, and of such external influences rary with the composition of The Triumph of Life and a little as excite and sustain these powers; he is not one, but both" over a month before his death. (Shelley, Utters, II: 441) (Major, 231). In the case of freedom and poetry, for Shelley, one does not cause the other; rather, freedom leads to a jhe ambivalence of Shelley's last poem and the expres flourishing of creativity in literature and the arts, and by the sion of -a dun and faint etherial gloom" which "Temper[s] same turn, when the "cloud of mind is discharging its col- . . . iight" (92-93) is fascinating. Shelley fills the poem to the lected lightning, it causes action toward the establishment of brim with equivocating images and ideas. Even the narrator's liberty, toward the restoration of the "equilibrium between attitude toward "Freedom" seems "antithetically mixt," as By institutions and opinions. ron WOuld say (see Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, III.xxxvi.317). In describing the entranced and "Raging" throngs, the "cap Shelley s Prometheus Unbound enacts this dynamic rela- tive multitude" (119) hewn down and scattered from Life's tionship between freedom and creativity. In this dramatic path, Shelley invokes the images of Rome and freedom in a poem Shelley emulates that "union of energy and beauty" contradictory light: that distinguished Dante's poetry, and a union, or at least a collaboration, of liberty and poetry. Such a union occurs in \s when to greet some conqueror's advance Act III, where, when Prometheus is finally freed from the tyr r, . , . , , . , . .

(112-16) But where, then, in the interaction between liberty and Here Shelley seems to turn even freedom upon itself. The creativity does tyranny and stagnation fit? For surely in a dis- anthropomorphic embodiment of "Freedom" leaves those 105</page><page sequence="4">who had enslaved others to bear the very "yoke" they sought to inflict upon the truly "free." But amidst the difficult syntax, Shelley demonstrates that "Freedom" actually acts as an agent of justice, restoring "equilibrium between institutions and opinions." The incomplete poem, "dwell [s] in Possibility," to adopt a phrase from Emily Dickinson; the reader does not know what Shelley intended for the completion of the poem. Shelley presents a poetic vision in which the poet dreams a possible, but perhaps not certain, future—and thus the framework and the presentation of the vision provide a hope of "evolution toward betterment" to counter the despair in the predicament of Rousseau and the Enlightenment. Shel ley's presentation of oppression under the yoke of Life's sin ister reign actually provides an opportunity for the poet to act as a herald of liberty. For, in spite of the emphasis Shelley places on the relationship between liberty and artistic creativ ity, he leaves much unsaid, but implied, about how tyranny and a poet's reaction against oppression engenders great cre ative power. Shelley sought refuge in 19th century Italy, the "Para dise of exiles," as he calls it in Julian and Maddalo (1.57) be cause (although it was not the Italy of Dante and the Italian city-state) he hoped to find a social climate more fertile than his native England and thus more conducive to a literary flourishing that might result in his own "union of energy and beauty" as a herald, companion, follower and poet of liberty. Regardless of whether Shelley and his readers can determine the causal relationship between liberty and artistic creativity, the flourishing in the arts and personal freedom in England is indebted not only to Dante and the Italian city-state, but also to the "restlessness of fervid power" in Shelley's own in dependent, artistic and poetic achievements.
