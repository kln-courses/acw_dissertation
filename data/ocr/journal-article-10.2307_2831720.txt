<plain_text><page sequence="1">INSECT-EATING PLANTS AND HOW TO GROW THEM. By Adrian Slack. University of Washington Press, Seat- tle(Washington). $19.95 (paper). 172 p.; ill.; index. [First published in 1986 by Alphabooks Ltd., Sher- borne, Dorset, England.] ISBN: 0-295-96637-8. 1988. By using a common anthropomorphic title, the au- thor implies that this book is written for the layper- son. Readers interested in the technical information the book contains might reject it because of its title. "Carnivorous Plant Culture" might have been a bet- ter title since the wealth of information the book con- tains would be valuable to schools and universities, cooperative extension services, arboretums, botan- ical gardens, commercial growers and the general public. This book deals with plants that over a long period of time have adapted to growing in very specialized environments-chiefly bogs, where nutrients are generally unavailable because of low pH levels, so there is reduced competition from other plants. The author, a nurseryman with 30 years of experience growing carnivorous plants, has developed success- ful culture systems for growing more than 200 spe- cies of these plants. The book contains 15 full-page, over 20 half-page, and more than 60 quarter-page color photographs of excellent quality. There are more than 60 line</page><page sequence="2">76 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY VOLUME 64 drawings that supplement and help to explain the text. There are short lists of recommended readings and of nurseries, suppliers (in the United States and throughout the world) and plant societies. I recommend this book to anyone who grows car- nivorous plants. The use of the author's culture sys- tems, designed for the special needs of each species, should enable the reader to grow these plants either for teaching, research or home pleasure. G.
