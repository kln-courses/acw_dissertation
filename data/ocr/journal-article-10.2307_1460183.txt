<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review Article Yehezkel Kaufmann's View of the Religion of Israel* J. PHILIP HYATT Vanderbilt University INCE 1937 Yehezkel Kaufmann has been publishing in modern Hebrew a history of Israelite religion which offers a challenge to the prevailing critical view of the nature and development of that religion. Eight volumes have been published, the last in 1956. Kaufmann has had great influence in some circles, especially on Jew- ish scholars, but his influence has necessarily been confined largely to those who read modern Hebrew. We are now in the very fortunate position of having a translation into English of his work, or rather of its most important portions. This is not a trans- lation of all that has appeared in Hebrew, but an abridgement of the material devoted to the pre-exilic period; nothing is presented from Volume VIII, which deals with the post-exilic age. But it is in the pre-exilic period that Kaufmann puts the greater part of ancient Hebrew literature and also its important religious creativity. Kaufmann's work is monumental-not alone in the sense that it is very extensive but also in that it offers a fundamental criti- cism of the prevailing view, which is based on the work of Julius Wellhausen, and pre- sents an alternative to that view which is in no way fundamentalistic or obscurantist, but makes use of critical methods. When a care- ful scholar says that the direction of the evolution of Israelite religion was from mon- otheism to monolatry, and that the Torah preceded classical prophecy, the reader can be prepared for some startling differences from the regnant critical view of Israelite history and religion. Yehezkel Kaufmann, a native of the Ukraine, was educated at Odessa, Petrograd, and the University of Berne (Ph.D., 1918). He has taught in Palestine since 1928, and has been Professor of Bible at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem since 1949. I According to Kaufmann, monotheism be- gan in the age of Moses. While he con- stantly insists that monotheism was the belief of the people of Israel, he does not deny to Moses a creative role in the beginning of their monotheistic faith. Moses was "the initiator of a religious revolution" and "the creator of an original idea" (p. 227). This religion was utterly different from paganism and was not influenced by it. Moses was not led to his belief in one God by any "tend- encies toward monotheism" in other reli- gions, Egyptian or otherwise. "Israelite re- ligion was an original creation of the people of Israel. It was absolutely different from anything the pagan world knew; its mono- theistic world view has no antecedents in paganism" (p. 2). The author means by paganism "all the religions of mankind from the beginnings of recorded history to the present, excepting Israelite religion and its derivatives, Christianity and Islam" (p. 21). He often speaks of vestigial remnants of paganism, linguistic fossils, and poetic im- agery derived from foreign sources, but he * YEHEZKEL KAUFMANN.

The monotheistic idea was not a product of speculation or of mystical meditation, as in Greece or India. "It first appeared as an insight, an original intuition" (p. 60). Moses was an apostle-prophet (the word "apostle" being used in its etymological sense of "one who is sent on a mission"). "He was sent; his God revealed himself to him and let him hear his voice. Intuitive insight took the shape of a prophetic vision" (p. 228). It is difficult to determine whether Kaufmann at- tributes monotheism basically to the intui- tion of Moses and the people, or to special revelation; or whether he considers these as two sides of the same process. He seems to put the emphasis on human intuition and in- sight, rather than on supernatural revelation. The nature of the Israelite faith is clearly summed up in the following: "the biblical religious idea, visible in the earliest strata, permeating even the 'magical' legends, is of a supernal God, above every cosmic law, fate, and compulsion; unborn, unbegetting, knowing no desire, independent of matter and its forces; a God who does not fight other divinities or powers of impurity; who does not sacrifice, divine, prophesy, or prac- tice sorcery; who does not sin and needs no expiation; a God who does not celebrate festivals of his life. An unfettered divine will transcending all being--this is the mark of biblical religion and that which sets it apart from all the religions of the earth" (p. 121). This monotheism implies, however, only a delimited kind of universalism. It is a uni- versalism of the dominion and power of deity, but not of his favor and self-revelation. Yahweh is in reality ruler of the whole world, but he has revealed himself and shown his special favor only to Israel. It is the type of monotheism which is expressed in Deuteronomy 4:19 and 3t2:9: Yahweh has allotted other deities to the foreign nations, but Israel alone is the "portion of Yahweh." The patriarchs before the time of Moses were not monotheists. They were no more than links in the chain leading to monothe- ism. Kaufmann considers the patriarchs as historic figures, whose history took place largely under the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt after 1350 B.C. The Israelite tribal federation goes back to the patriarchal pe- riod, and is thus not a product of the age of conquest and settlement. The Israelites were not genuine desert nomads; at best their life was semi-nomadic. Israelite religion was born amidst a high cul- tural environment, the nations of Egypt, Mesopotamia and Canaan. There was no "nomadic ideal" in Israel. The conquest of Canaan was carried out by the confederation of tribes, who were only partially successful, taking over mainly the central highlands.1 The Bible knows two kinds of boundaries of the land: those of the real land, occupied by the Israelites; and those of the utopian land, which could never be conquered but existed only in the imagi- nation. However, the Israelites completely destroyed or dispossessed the Canaanites (except the Gibeonites), according to the law of h.rem. Thus, Israelite religion re- ceived no basic influence from the Canaan- ites, and it cannot be considered as an amal- gam of Canaanite and native elements. The only Baalistic cults in Israelite history were promoted by kings and the royal court (par- ticularly under Ahab and Jezebel, and Ma- nasseh), and were never adhered to by many of the common people. One of the points which the author con- stantly seeks to make is that the Bible never combats mythology, and never conducts a polemic against the existence of foreign gods as living realities. (He defines mythology in the narrow sense of stories about the gods and their activities and relationships, not in the broad sense used by Bultmann.) The only polemic is against idolatry. It was natural for the foreigners to worship their own idols in their own land. In Israel idola- try was really fetishism. Kaufmann says that</page><page sequence="3">54 J. PHILIP HYATT "the popular idolatry was not authentic polytheism, with mythology, temples, and priesthoods. It was vestigial idolatry, a vul- gar superstition of the sort that the ignorant level of monotheistic peoples practices to this day. YHWH was God, but the vulgar believed also in the virtue of idols, amulets, spells, and pagan rites; saw no harm in traffic with satyrs and demons; believed in the influence of the host of heaven. They did not practice a genuine, mythological cult of pagan gods, but they did not reject the host of anonymous 'elIim and teraphim ... Besides this there was at times another form of 'idolatry': the worship of YHWH in pagan ways" (p. 142). The judges of Israel were "apostle-sav- iors." Some may have been contemporaneous with others, and some may have been fa- mous only locally. They were "men of the spirit." In the time of the settlement a new cultic factor came into being: the sanctity of the land of Israel. Foreign lands were con- sidered impure. Certain sanctuaries came to be more venerated than others, but they were not taken over from the Canaanites. The Bible is only partly correct in consider- ing this a time of great idolatry; it was only that "vestigial fetishistic idolatry" which prevailed throughout the pre-exilic period among the ignorant masses. The kingship of Israel was instituted partly because of the need to meet the Phi- listine menace. The Israelites never believed in a divine kingship; the king succeeded to the task of the prophet-judge, not of the priest. The king was the elect of Yahweh. David, however, was considered as "more than just another savior of Israel; he is the ultimate savior, his kingship is the final ex- pression of God's grace" (p. 268). Kaufmann values highly the classical prophets. Yet, he places the "Torah litera- ture" before prophecy, and says that the classical prophecy was rooted in the earlier popular religion; it did not so much repudi- ate that religion as rise above it. In the classical prophets "Israelite religion reached a new height. They were the first to conceive of the doctrine of the primacy of morality, the idea that the essence of God's demand of man is not cultic, but moral. This doctrine regards human goodness as the realization of the will of God on earth. It negates the intrinsic, transcendent value of the cult" (p. 345). The latter point is made several times: the prophets did not absolutely op- pose the cult (sacrifice, festivals, prayer, etc.) but they denied that it had any intrinsic or absolute value. It was not to be conceived as magic, working automatically. The earlier literature had put much emphasis on the cult, and had condemned cultic sins. The prophets condemned Israel for moral sins. Some of the prophets repudiated the power state and militarism, and the last two- Jeremiah and Ezekiel-looked forward to the time when idolatry would be abolished among foreign nations. Kaufmann goes to great pains to try to prove that Israel was not really as wicked as portrayed by Jeremiah and Ezekiel; thus Israel did not actually deserve the exile. He makes a distinction between an empirical view of the fall of Jerusalem, and the dog- matic religious view presented in the proph- ets-and supported by Christian doctrine- which "regards the two destructions of Jeru- salem as merited by the continuous sin of Israel, which was climaxed by the rejection of Jesus" (p. 403). The author can succeed in this only by making Ezekiel a very un- realistic, highly imaginative prophet, given to fantasy, as we shall see. An empirical view of the fall of Jerusalem tells us that it fell "because the might of Babylonian arms overwhelmed the small state of Judah which was abandoned in the field by all its allies" (p. 401). II It should be quite clear that Kaufmann is not a fundamentalist or literalist, of the sort</page><page sequence="4">KAUFMANN'S VIEW OF THE RELIGION OF ISRAEL 55 prepared to defend the complete historicity of the Old Testament. He often declares statements in the Bible to be unhistorical or legendary; at several points he rejects the "historiosophy"-philosophy of history--of the biblical writers. He can say of the Torah that it embodies "divergent and at times mutually contradictory matter" (p. 448). He often says that the biblical writers mis- understood the nature of Israelite idolatry. Kaufmann considers three conclusions of classical criticism as assured (pp. 156-157): (1) He accepts the analysis of the three primary sources, JE, P, and D, together with their laws and narrative framework; the author is especially insistent that there are three separate and mutually independent legal corpora. (2) The present Torah book was not in pre-exilic times canonical and binding on the nation. Before this book came into ex- istence, there was a long period of literary creation by priests and religious writers. (3) Deuteronomy was promulgated in the reign of Josiah, and the Torah as a whole was promulgated in the times of Ezra and Nehemiah. The author thus accepts the broad outline of the classical literary analysis. He differs in the dating of the sources, and in his in- terpretation of the history of religion based on those sources. Actually, he is not very precise in the dating of the separate sources (see p. 291). JE and the materials that went to make up the Torah-group (which in- cludes both the Pentateuch and the historical books, Joshua through Kings) are pre- prophetic. D was apparently composed in the period between Hezekiah and Josiah, perhaps some of it before Hezekiah. Kauf- mann believes that much of the literature often assigned to post-exilic times is early: Proverbs, Jonah, and Job are all pre-exilic, and none of the Psalms is later than the exilic 137th. He completely rejects the Scandinavian oral-tradition school of criticism. Its view of the way in which the Torah came into being "is quite unclear in details," and its religio- historical views "are even more paganistic than those of the classical criticism" (p. 156, n. 1). The author thus seems to imply that the basic trouble with much of the criticism with which he disagrees is that it is "pagan- istic"! He often asserts that "the critics" fail to see the obvious, and that they fashion their literary analysis or interpretation to fit preconceived notions of history. At two points it appears to me that Kaufmann has done precisely the same thing himself. The two books that most clearly contradict his view of Israelite monotheism and popular idolatry are Hosea and Ezekiel. Kaufmann deals with the former by dividing the four- teen chapters of Hosea into First Hosea and Second Hosea (he believes also in First and Second Isaiah, and First and Second Zecha- riah); he deals with Ezekiel by asserting that the prophet was given to fantasy. The book of Hosea consists of two distinct literary units, whose authors lived about a century apart. First Hosea (chapters 1-3) must have been written before King Jehu destroyed the Baalistic cult once for all (II Kings 10:28). Kaufmann thus proceeds to place the earlier prophet in the time of Je- horam, son of Ahab (853-42 B.C.), by re- jecting the Massoretic reading "house of Jehu" in 1:4, and supposing that the original reading was "house of Jehoram" (for which he thinks a slight support is given by the Septuagint's "Judah" for "Jehu"). First Hosea is thus a product of pre-classical prophecy. Second Hosea (chapters 4-14) prophesied between 732 and 725 B.C. But his work is not, as many scholars hold, a mine of infor- mation concerning the syncretistic worship of Israel. To Second Hosea, Baal worship is a sin of the past only (9:10; 13:1); the</page><page sequence="5">56 J. PHILIP HYATT "harlotry" and the licentiousness to which it refers really have nothing to do with Baal worship. As for Ezekiel, Kaufmann's theory re- garding the religion of Israel is embarrassed by that prophet's portrayal of the sins of Is- rael, particularly his description of the abom- inations in the temple in chapter 8, and his interpretation of the history of the nation as one of continual sinfulness and apostasy from the very beginning. Kaufmann thinks that Ezekiel was given to fantasy and imagina- tion; much that the prophet portrays is based upon what he had heard about the reign of Manasseh. For Kaufmann, both the proph- et's histories and his visions of events in Jerusalem "are products of an exuberant imagination and have no historical worth" (p. 432). Of the fantastic description in chapter 8, he says: "Ezekiel who was carried to Jerusalem by his hair in a vision sees these things, but Jeremiah who frequented the temple and its courts does not" (p. 430). It is probable that Ezekiel never left Baby- lonia. III This work of Kaufmann is very valuable, and one can learn much from it. It is filled with many acute insights, and will doubtless stimulate other scholars to re-think many problems. To some extent, however, the "classical criticism" of Wellhausen is a straw man, for in many respects Old Testament scholarship has gone beyond the positions described here. Yet Kaufmann's basic agree- ment with the literary analysis of classical criticism (as well as the partial agreement of the Scandinavian school) should help to demonstrate how solidly founded that analy- sis is. There are many points at which I find my- self in agreement with Kaufmann, or at which I find his views most suggestive. For example, he has correctly shown that many of the strands that finally went into P were early; many scholars will agree with that view. We should not think of P as having been composed by Ezra in Babylon and brought back to Palestine from there. The author's repeated emphasis on the biblical view that man has freedom and re- sponsibility before God, and may choose either to obey or rebel, is salutary. His re- marks on repentance are valuable, particu- larly the paragraph on p. 284. His discussion of the difference between the true and false prophets is illuminating (p. 278): the false prophet was a prophet only of weal, and was given to moral complacency; the true prophet was a prophet of both woe and weal, and was morally alert. Very suggestive is the point that the rift between prophecy and history, or between the ideal and the real, in classical prophecy indicates that the words of the prophets attained quasi-canonical status very early. Yet, I find myself asking many questions about Kaufmann's theories. In particular, his basic position respecting Israelite monothe- ism is not convincing. His view of what he calls paganism seems to me distorted, and hence his attempt to interpret the religion of Israel as utterly different and radically new fails. It appears to me to be erroneous his- tory and inadequate theology to say that Hebrew religion was utterly new or unique. (The same remark should be made about Christianity.) Also, Kaufmann's distinction between idolatry as fetishism and idolatry as true polytheism is too sophisticated; it is not likely that the distinction would have been understood by the ancient Israelite. I won- der if the average Israelite did not consider the idol to be a god, and if the distinctions even of the ancient Hebrew theologians were not lost on him. As for the view that Israelite religion was monotheistic from the time of Moses, there are a number of basic questions that ought to be asked. (1) Kaufmann says on p. 230: "We do not have a reliable account of the original</page><page sequence="6">KAUFMANN'S VIEW OF THE RELIGION OF ISRAEL 57 content of Moses' message. Although the whole biblical literature is a product of the deep transformation that it brought about, the Bible tells nothing of the course of that transformation." Is not the author here a captive of the literary analysis which he es- pouses ? Once he has admitted the presence of the sources in the Pentateuch (JE, D and P), he is driven to say that we do not really know much of a reliable nature about the message of Moses. How then can he be sure that Moses was a monotheist, and that a folk monotheism existed from Moses' time for- ward? The First Commandment, which seems important to him, can be used as a witness for henotheism as well as for mono- theism. (2) Is not the author's definition of monotheism, quoted above from p. 121, far too abstract and philosophical for Moses and the Mosaic age, and in fact for most if not all of the pre-exilic age? This definition or description seems far removed from the highly personal deity of the Old Testament who chooses, loves, becomes angry, makes demands, repents, and so on. Kaufmann sees that much of the literature of the pre-exilic age is "anthropomorphic," but this does not enter into his own essential definition of monotheism. (3) Is the religious faith which Kauf- mann describes a true monotheism? After describing the faith of Israel as being of the type expressed in Deuteronomy 4:19 and 32:9, he seems compelled to say not only that the foreign nations found it natural to worship their own gods, but that it was valid for them to do so. Isaiah, he says, was the first to envisage the possibility of the aboli- tion of idolatry among the foreign nations, and this was made more definite in Jeremiah and Ezekiel. The faith of the early centuries as described by Kaufmann must seem to many to fall short of monotheism, and to be better covered by the term that he and some other scholars apparently dislike--heno- theism. (4) It should be frankly admitted that Kaufmann's thesis, and the more widely ac- cepted critical thesis that monotheism de- veloped much later than the time of Moses, are both attempts to explain the same set of phenomena. Kaufmann does not deny that the pre-exilic literature contains traces of idolatry, magic, divination, mythology, etc., but these are to him merely vestigial remains of an earlier Hebrew paganism, linguistic fossils, poetic imagery, and the like. The two factors which appear decisive to him are the absence of a polemic against polytheism, and the absence of true mythology in Yahwism. The classical criticism views these various phenomena as steps on the way to mono- theism, rather than as vestigial remains of an earlier paganism. We can be certain, on the basis of the prophet's own words, that Second Isaiah was a self-conscious mono- theist who saw the implications of his faith; it is possible that a virtual or implicit mono- theism existed before his time (perhaps in Amos, or even as early as Elijah). Are not the various phenomena, which are admitted by both sides in the argument, better ex- plained as steps leading to a monotheism which was eventually made explicit, rather than as vestigial remains of a paganism that preceded a monotheism we cannot really demonstrate from contemporaneous sources ? In spite of the criticisms that can be made of this book, it is one from which every reader can learn. The scholarly world should be grateful to Professor Greenberg of the University of Pennsylvania for making it available in a splendid English translation.
