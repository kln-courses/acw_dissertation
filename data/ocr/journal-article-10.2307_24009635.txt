<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kerstin Pilz Literature as Natural Philosophy: Italo Calvino's (Post)modern Re-evaluation of Cosmogony September 2005 marks the twentieth anniversary of Italo Calvino's death. It is an opportune moment at which to re-evaluate the legacy of one of Italy's most celebrated and best known contemporary authors. Internationally Calvino is perhaps best known as a prominent postmodern author/icon.1 His manifold literary experimentations amount to a textbook-like illustration of the passage from literary modernism to postmodernism: his narratives become gradually more fragmented, open-ended and non-linear, geometrical narrative structures that turn into interdependent webs, where order is challenged by disorder and characters submit to an increasing sense of disorientation, perplexity and dispersion. Yet pigeonholing Calvino in this way would not do him justice and indeed would betray the central theme of his oeuvre. His most important legacy and the overarching ambition of all his works have been that of remaking and reevaluating literature as a source of knowledge and as a cultural unifier: "Vogliamo dalla letteratura un'immagine cosmica" (Saggi 1. 123), he pledged in 1962. First and foremost Calvino needs to be remembered and celebrated as a pioneer who advocated an interdisciplinary approach to culture and knowledge, long before this tendency became fashionable. Only a dialogue of literature, science and philosophy, he argued in 1967, could save culture from the perceived ideological and epistemological impasse that dominated the second half of the twentieth century: "Una cultura all'altezza délia situazione ci sarà soltanto quando la problematica della scienza, quella della filosofia e quella della letteratura si metteranno continuamente in crisi a vicenda" (Saggi 1. 193 94). In this article I propose to examine Calvino's notion of interdisciplinarity and illustrate its link to traditional cosmology.2 I will do so by taking a closer look at the posthumously published Lezioni americane: sei proposte per il prossimo millennio, which amounts to an intellectual balance sheet of the 1 Cannon illustrates this point by quoting an article from the New York Times Book Review, where Calvino is listed alongside Philip Johnson's AT&amp;T building, Disneyland, Monty Python, Max Headroom, and Donald Bartheleme as the most prominent "icons" of postmodernism (198). 2 Calvino's interest in science has already been examined in some detail.

Annali d'italianistica 23 (2005) Literature and Science</page><page sequence="2">192 Kerstin Pilz thought models, ideas and writers that nourished and inspired Calvino's work and the points of contact he made between different forms of knowledge. While Calvino's concern to integrate literature with other branches of knowledge is not restricted to those works that make direct reference to science, but is in fact evident in all his prose fictions, it is the Charles Eliot Norton lectures that provide the most complete and fascinating example of a true dialogue between literature, science and philosophy. After his untimely death in September 1985, on the eve of his departure to Harvard University where he was to deliver the prestigious Norton lectures, several obituaries paid tribute to Calvino as a uniquely interdisciplinary writer and thinker, whose interest and knowledge of science went well beyond a merely superficial acquaintance. Massimo Piattelli Palmarini, a philosopher of science and a personal friend of Calvino, who had been looking forward to exchanging ideas with Calvino during his stay at Harvard, stresses the writer's lifelong interest in science: Insaziabile curioso per ogni cosa, lo era in particolar modo per i fatti della scienza. Leggeva avidamente e puntualmente ogni numéro di Scientific American, ricavandovi spunti e riflessioni che poi sottoponeva, tra il timido e il provocatorio, agli scienziati di mestiere. Nella scienza Italo era entrato con quello che i cristiani chiamerebbero un battesimo di desiderio. Trovava che la realtà rivelataci dalle scienze superava spesso la fantasia. Spesso la sua. Azzardava ipotesi e spiegazioni nuove, eterodosse, quasi sempre ben ispirate e plausibili [...]. Italo ne traeva sue speciali riflessioni cosmogoniche e lezioni filosofiche. In writing Calvino's obituary, Primo Levi likewise confirmed Calvino's interest in science: "[...] aveva fame di scienza, la coltivava, se ne nutriva da dilettante colto e critico, e di essa nutriva i suoi libri più maturi." Levi elaborated on Calvino's and his own attempts to reconcile science and literature: "Avevamo discusso e condividevamo programmi vaghi e grandiosi, di una letteratura médiatrice, rivelatrice, a cavallo fra 'le due culture', partecipe di entrambe." Both Piattelli Palmarini and Levi referred in these obituaries to the pleasurable experience of participating in Calvino's guide to Queneau's Petite cosmogonie portative. Calvino had turned to the two scientists for assistance with some obscure passages in Queneau's poem. Levi recalls Calvino's fascinating "acutezza di filologo," while Piattelli Palmarini stresses Calvino's relentless inquisitiveness regarding the allusions to scientific theories and facts contained in the poem: "[...] voleva sempre saperne di più. Ogni nota al testo comportava tra noi lunghe escursioni sul Big Bang, la genetica del cervelletto nei topi, i mutanti della Drosofila." The above observation makes clear one reason for Calvino's interest in science. He envisioned contact between the disciplines as a two-way exchange: literature can serve science as, in his words, a "molla propulsiva per lo scienziato: come esempio di coraggio neH'immaginazione, nel portare alle</page><page sequence="3">Calvino's (Post)modern Re-evaluation of Cosmogony 193 estreme conseguenze un'ipotesi. E cosi in altre situazioni puô awenire il contrario. In questo momento, il modello del linguaggio matematico, della logica formale, puô salvare lo scrittore dal logoramento in cui sono scadute parole e immagini per il loro falso uso" (Saggi 1. 237). Raymond Queneau, a hobby mathematician and a unique example of a truly interdisciplinary writer, served Calvino as a revered mentor who demonstrated points of contact between mathematics and literature.3 Queneau's interest in and scepticism towards science — notably the irony and wit that characterise his Cosmogonie portative — set an important example for Calvino who followed it closely. With his watershed prose fiction Le cosmicomiche Calvino embraced Queneau's model of reverting literature to its original task as a cosmogony and cosmology. Calvino's cosmicomical stories are an attempt to integrate narrative with empirical knowledge and scientific theory in an effort to reconcile humanity with the Copernican universe. He accomplishes this task by coalescing ancient forms of understanding — myth and fable — with contemporary science. The volume Le cosmicomiche marks an important point of demarcation in Calvino's work. It closes a period of ideological and intellectual reorientation and critical reassessment of the role of politically engaged literature, while it also indicates a new conception of literature and new perspectives on knowledge. After abandoning his studies of agriculture in favour of literature, thereby breaking with family tradition (both his parents held professorships in science faculties), Calvino turned to science for inspiration and as a way of facing up to the crisis of modernity. In the decade prior to the publication of Le cosmicomiche he had alternated between social realist fictions, that embody his increasingly anguished commitment to politically engaged literature, and novels of pure fantasy, that signal his stylistic reorienation. The novels of the trilogy I nostri antenati, for example, are populated with visual images of incompleteness and displacement. Most prominently, Medardo, the cloven Viscount of the eponymous novel is accidentally split into an evil half and a good half by a cannon ball, each half ultimately unable to live without the other. In another novel of the same collection, Il barone rampante, Cosimo de Rondo, the Baron who lives in the trees wilfully separates himself from society. His life amongst the treetops, from where he successfully spreads the ideas of Enlightenment philosophers, reflects the decentering of humanity subsequent to the Copernican Revolution, which was followed by the search for a new centre. The result of that search is embodied in the main character of the last novel of the trilogy, Il cavaliere inesistente. The invisible knight Agilulfo who is the embodiment of pure rationality, has paid for his gain of mastery and control of 3 In his foreword to the collection he edited of essays by Queneau, Segni e chifre e lettere, Calvino pays tribute to the French writer as a precious mentor, "[...] uno dei pochi che restino in un secolo in cui i maestri cattivi o parziali o insufficienti o troppo bene intenzionati sono stati tanti [...]" (xv).</page><page sequence="4">194 Kerstin Pilz the world with the loss of self. In brief, the characters of the trilogy describe a genealogy of the shades of alienation modern civilisation has passed through. These characters symbolically render the laceration and manifold scissions that underlie the crisis of modernity: the separation of man from nature; the defeat of reason; history as a series of discontinuous events rather than as process and evolution; fragmentation of branches of knowledge into separate pockets; and alienation in place of an organic harmony between man and nature. In an interview with Daniele del Giudice Calvino explained that the awareness of laceration evokes the desire for its opposite: [...] ogni illusione d'armonia nelle cose contingenti è mistificatoria, perciô bisogna cercarla su altri piani. Cosi sono arrivato ai cosmo. Ma il cosmo non esiste, nemmeno per la scienza, è solo l'orizzonte di una coscienza extraindividuale, dove superare tutti gli sciovinismi di un'idea particolarista dell'uomo, e raggiungere magari un'ottica non antropomorfa. [...] Siamo anello di una catena che parte a scala subatomica o pregalattica: dare ai nostri gesti, ai nostri pensieri, la continuité del prima di noi e dopo di noi, è una cosa in cui credo. E vorrei che questo si raccogliesse da quelfinsieme di frammenti che è la mia opera. (Saggi 2. 2831) Calvino's perceived postmodernism, therefore, is not only to be sought in his narrative techniques, but most importantly in his effort to escape an anthropocentric understanding of the world. His flight into the cosmos in the quest for the reintegration of humanity and nature coincides with the trend in postmodern science to return to pre-Cartesian forms of understanding and to reevaluate cosmology and cosmogony as absolutely modern sciences. In his book Return to Cosmology (1982), Stephen Toulmin identifies the return to the cosmos and cosmology as a markedly postmodern trend, motivated by the search for a pre-Cartesian concept of an interrelated cosmos, where humanity is part of the cosmos rather than the detached observer of a rational universe. In classical antiquity, he explains, the cosmos denoted a unified conception of the universe and all things in it: namely "[...] the conviction that the entire system of the world forms a single, integrated system united by universal principles," in which "Humanity and Nature participated in a single, common order." This connectedness collapsed with the beginning of modernity and the introduction of the Cartesian and Newtonian dualisms and dichotomies, "separating Humanity from Nature, Mind from Matter, Rationality from Causality," which means, Toulmin concluded, that "so understood, the world view of Descartes and Newton no longer represents a genuine cosmos" (224). What was lost with the advent of modernity was not only the notion of a cosmos but a genuine cosmology, since natural philosophy became separated from natural theology in the seventeenth century, thereby leading to the specialisation of disciplines. "As a result," Toulmin explains, "it was no longer the professional business of anybody in the sciences to think about 'the Whole'</page><page sequence="5">Calvino's (Post)modern Re-evaluation of Cosmogony 195 — that is, to deal with those broader questions, about the overall interrelations between things of vastly different kinds, which had been a major concern of earlier cosmologies" (237). Traditional cosmology, Toulmin asserts, was fundamentally interdisciplinary in character: although "historically it was /^disciplinary, functionally it was /r&lt;mvdisciplinary"(229). Likewise, Calvino's call for literature to supply us with a cosmic image of reality is an appeal to literature to return to the role it had before the advent of modernity:4 a return to the pre-modern concept of the "transdiciplinary" cosmology. This appeal picks up what Calvino sees as a tradition of Italian literature continued from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance but lost in modernity: Questa è una vocazione profonda della letteratura italiana che passa da Dante a Galileo: l'opera letteraria come mappa del mondo e dello scibile, lo scrivere mosso da una spinta conoscitiva che è ora teologica ora speculativa ora stregonesca ora enciclopedica ora di filosofia naturale ora di osservazione trasfigurante e visionaria. E una vocazione che esiste in tutte le letterature europee ma che nella letteratura italiana è stata direi dominante sotte le più varie forme [...]. Questa vena negli ultimi secoli è diventata più sporadica, e da allora certo la letteratura italiana ha visto diminuire la sua importanza: oggi forse è venuto il momento di riprenderla. (Saggi 1. 232-33) As I have argued elsewhere (Mapping Complexity: Literature and Science in the Works ofltalo Calvino), Calvino's appeal to return literature to its original function as a unifying cultural framework where diverse forms of knowledge intersect, needs to be read into the wider context of interdisciplinary studies in philosophy and science that are concerned to recuperate a holistic approach to knowledge. The loss of an integrated approach to knowledge can be dated to the beginnings of modernity and the development of experimental science which led to the split into two distinct cultures: science and the humanities. William Paulson points out that up to the dawn of modern science the study of natural science was a matter of textual study, as in fact "all study was essentially a study of texts" and all knowledge was sought in texts (i.e., the texts of the classics, including Aristotle and Ptolemy, whose works were the recognised points of reference). "Literature was synonymous with written culture, [when] literary education was not a speciality but was nearly identical to education in general." (Paulson 17). Literature in this way constituted a depository of all knowledge and provided culture with a unifying framework. According to Paulson, the marginalisation of literature began with Galileo and Newton, when science moved away from treatise writing and the study of classical texts to experimentation and observation of nature; one consequence of this shift was the devaluation of writing in favour of the empirical truths science can deliver. As 4 In a letter to Giuseppe Bonaviri (29 April 1969), Calvino writes: "letteratura come 'filosofia naturale' (I libri degli altri 579).</page><page sequence="6">196 Kerstin Pilz Paulson points out, as a result literature today seems no longer a source of knowledge, since even the few remaining bastions, such as the realm of the inner world of emotions and our interactions with the outer world, have been taken over by the new social sciences, such as psychology and sociology. By contrast, as studied today at our universities, literature (including Calvino's) has become an object of knowledge. Notably, after structuralism literature tends to objectify and deconstruct itself from within. Calvino's Se una notte d'inverno un viaggiatore, for example, is a fictional exploration of the role of reader, writer and literature itself. Its very form as hypernovel — that is, as an all encompassing, combinatorial novel or catalogue of literary genres — renders Calvino's proposition to reassign to literature an encyclopaedic role, within which are contained an infinity of observations on the processes of reading and writing. The Norton lectures, on the other hand, were projected towards the new millennium as a collection of values and examples of how literature might remain meaningful in a world where it occupies a lesser role in the face of the increasing dominance of other media.5 Unfinished and unpublished at the moment of his death and addressed to an international audience, the lectures are his literary testament, where Calvino demonstrates literature's role as a unifying framework of ideas and models of thought.6 In them he draws a "cosmic image" of literature without distinction of genre, historical period and language. In a discarded draft of an opening speech, Calvino makes the point that his conception of literature as an all-encompassing map of written discourse is conditioned by the fact that in Italy, in contrast to other cultures, the term poetry is in fact conceived as a broader category: [...] caratteristico délia letteratura italiana è il considerare in un unico contesto culturale tutte le attività artistiche, perciô è per noi perfettamente naturale che nella definizione delle Norton Poetry Lectures il termine poetry venga inteso in senso estensivo, tanto da comprendere anche musica e arti visuali; cost come è perfettamente naturale che lo scrittore di fiction tenga présente nello stesso discorso poesia in versi e romanzo, perché nella nostra cultura letteraria la separazione e specializzazione delle due forme d'espressione e delle relative riflessioni critiche è meno accentuata che in altre culture. (Saggi 2.2958) Literature, furthermore, is a universal discourse: "Le mie riflessioni mi 5 Or as Calvino puts it: [...] "il modo in cui la letteratura dimostrerà la sua insostituibilità in un mondo future in cui apparentemente il suo posto sarà più ridotto" (Saggi 2. 2978). 6 See also Asor Rosa who observes: "Le lezioni americane [...] assumano il valore pieno di un testamentum, non tanto nel senso più ristretto dell'eredità lasciata quanto nel senso della 'testimonianza' che lo scrittore rende in pubblico intorno aile sue più profonde convinzioni letterarie e poetiche e aile sue molteplici e contrastanti visioni del mondo" (67).</page><page sequence="7">Calvino's (Post)modern Re-evaluation of Cosmogony 197 hanno sempre portato a considerare la letteratura come universale senza distinzioni di lingua e di carattere nazionale, e a considerare il passato in funzione del futuro" (Saggi 2. 2958). The five lectures that were posthumously published in the volume Six Memos for the Next Millennium (Lezioni americane) are dedicated to a variety of values — lightness, quickness, exactitude, multiplicity, visibility — that Calvino conceived of as stylistic and aesthetic as well as conceptual and methodological principles. The notes to the lectures, collected and annotated in the Mondadori Meridiani edition of his complete works, outline the somewhat tortured process of organising the separate lectures in an all-encompassing discourse that would be true to the "cosmic" vocation Calvino assigned to literature. The evolution of topics into the existing table of contents documents well Calvino's approach to knowledge as a combinatorial catalogue: interconnected and infinitely re-orderable, the catalogue is potentially all encompassing, yet open and fluid. Between March and June 1985 he experimented with a number of possible headings, which he arranged and re-arranged in a variety of ways to accommodate a list of overarching themes, topics and authors. Interestingly, the first outline of possible topics starts with the value "cosmicità," which was to be dedicated to Lucretius, Ovid and the notion of the encyclopaedic knowledge. At other stages Calvino thought of developing the topic "encyclopedia" under the heading "La relazione di tutto con tutto" (which was to comprise Ovid, Lucretius, Gadda and Perec). The fact that "cosmicità" was never developed into a separate lecture is perhaps an indication of Calvino's struggle to separate what in fact constitutes an all-pervasive concern and quality from the values he did develop as separate categories. Another heading excluded from the final draft is "sense of connection," which he associated with "interconnection, plentifulness, intricacy (?) involvement (?) interweaving, connectedness, multiplicity, manifoldness" (question marks are the author's), values which were later combined under the all-encompassing heading of "multiplicity." Again, a "sense of connection" is in fact an underlying theme of all his lectures, which in themselves are projected towards and encompass their opposites, as is explicitly acknowledged in the opening paragraph of the first lecture: "Dedicherô la prima conferenza all'opposizione leggerezza-peso" (Saggi 1. 631). At various stages Calvino had also considered developing the antithesis of "cosmicità" and "sense of connection," using the headings of "la singolarità" or "mathesis singularis" (a homage to Roland Barthes) and "disconnection." Another list of six possible topics is conceived entirely as antitheses: "1) stile come modello universale vs. stile come singolarità; 2) il tutto vs. la parte; 3) gli altri vs. l'io; 4) disordine vs. ordine; 5) Mercurio vs. Vulcano; 6) compatto vs. fluido." These pairs of opposites were furthermore accompanied by notes on how to combine autobiographical reflections with the vast catalogue of universal literature. In the draft of what he had initially planned as the opening lecture, "Cominciare e</page><page sequence="8">198 Kerstin Pilz finire," he alludes to a second projected lecture which was to deal explicitly with the "cosmicità" of literature: "La mia seconda conferenza tratterà di questa tentazione o vocazione (a seconda dei punti di vista) della letteratura contemporanea: il libro che contenga in sé l'universo, che s'identifichi con l'universo; e in particolare rifletterô sulla tendenza del romanzo contemporaneo da diventare un'enciclopedia" (Saggi 1. 753). The lecture "Cominciare e finire," now published in the Mondadori Meridiani edition as an appendix to the five completed lectures, had been discarded and was to be redrafted as a new lecture dedicated to the topic of "consistency" to be written at Harvard. It is unclear why he had decided to redraft the lecture under a new heading; yet again, it is a lecture that explicitly deals with a topic Calvino seemingly struggled to contain as a separate topic. In the opening paragraph which would have served as an introduction to the entire series of lectures, he explains this concern to be important methodologically: II punto di partenza delle mie conferenze sarà dunque questo momento decisivo per lo scrittore: il distacco dalla potenzialità illimitata e multiforme per incontrare qualcosa che ancora non esiste ma che potrà esistere solo accettando dei limiti e delle regole. Fino al momento precedente a quello in cui cominiciamo a scrivere, abbiamo a nostra disposizione il mondo [...] e noi vogliamo estrarre da questo mondo un discorso, un racconto, un sentimento: o più esattamente vogliamo compiere un'operazione che ci permetta di situarci in questo mondo. Abbiamo a disposizione tutti i linguaggi: quelli elaborati dalla letteratura, gli stili in cui si sono espressi civilité e individui nei vari secoli e paesi, e anche i linguaggi elaborati dalle discipline più varie, fïnalizzati a raggiungere le più varie forme di conoscenza. (Saggi 1. 735) This awareness of the interconnectedness of stories, languages and discourses is one that marked all of Calvino's writings. Indeed, Lezioni americane is, amongst other things, an effort at situating literature within a vaster field of knowledge. In contrast to the writer, who, as Calvino explains in the above-quoted passage, is faced with the problem of how to mark off an individual story from the vast universe of possible stories, the scientist needs to situate his or her research hypothesis and results within the parameters of an existing paradigm. Applied science, in other words, operates within the strict confines of a shared set of assumptions, methods and questions that constitute a given paradigm and determine the way the scientist interrogates nature. It is interesting to note that Calvino's call in 1962 for literature to provide us with a cosmic image coincided with Thomas Kuhn's well-known theory of paradigm shifts, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, published in the same year. Kuhn had explained that the advancement of knowledge is not a cumulative process, but a discontinuous layering of incompatible, even mutually exclusive paradigms. Paradigms are periodically abandoned when anomalies occur and results no longer match the questions asked by the scientist.</page><page sequence="9">Calvino's (Post)modern Re-evaluation of Cosmogony 199 Consequently, a sense of crisis falls upon a scientific community. One implication of this approach to knowledge is that applied science forgets its history: to understand the current paradigm and situate their research hypotheses within it, scientists do not have to read diachronically starting with Newton's Principia; instead they only need to take into consideration the literature produced within the contemporary paradigm of their research. Science, therefore, as another commentator has put it, has no classics (Antonello 219). Literature, on the other hand, values its classics as an inevitable passaggio obbligato, which, as Calvino tells us in his essay "Perché leggere i classici," "persiste come rumore di fondo anche là dove l'attualità più incompatibile fa da padrona" (Saggi 2. 1823). Lezioni americane offers important lessons on how to value and re-evaluate our classics as the building blocks that continue to nourish and inform our changing literary conventions. More importantly, Calvino's lectures demonstrate the relevance of the classics — in which cosmogony ranks among the oldest literary genres — to understanding the present. Furthermore, Calvino's Norton lectures inadvertently address a central problematic that arises from Kuhn's theory of paradigm changes, namely, how to value a paradigm once it has become superseded: "If these out-of-date beliefs are to be called myths," Kuhn explained, "then myths can be produced by the same sorts of reasons that now lead to scientific knowledge. If, on the other hand, they are to be called science, then science has included bodies of belief quite incompatible with the ones we hold today" (2). An answer to the second part of the paradox is provided by the very form of Le cosmicomiche and Lezioni americane, which are examples of such an overlap of incompatible paradigms or models of thought. Calvino's brand of cosmology blends different forms of knowledge, from literature to myth, from philosophy to the visual arts, amongst which science is but one form of knowledge. For example, the semi-serious list of sources that inspired the cosmicomical tales does not include scientific texts: "Le Cosmicomiche hanno dietro di sé soprattutto Leopardi, i comics di Popeye (Braccio di Ferro), Samuel Beckett, Giordano Bruno, Lewis Carroll, la pittura di Matta e in certi casi Landolfi, Immanuel Kant, Borges, le incisioni di Grandville" (Romanzi e racconti 2. 1322). In Lezioni americane Calvino returns to the classics of natural philosophy (Lucretius, Ovid), myth (Hermes, Mercurio), the classics of modern and Renaissance science (Galileo, Leonardo da Vinci) and of literature itself, informed as they were by different scientific paradigms, and he integrates these with contemporary science (cybernetics and information science; chaos theory and complexity science). In other words, the lectures weave a synchronic narrative of knowledge — inclusive of different genres and cognitive branches — that demonstrates how literature can serve science as an example of a different form of imagination. As I have pointed out above, Calvino abandoned the completed lecture "Cominciare e finire" in favour of "Leggerezza." This shift allowed him to trace the value of "lightness" from Lucretius's atomism to modern day information</page><page sequence="10">200 Kerstin Pilz science. The second scientific revolution of high-tech and information science, Calvino explains, has replaced the images of heavy steam-engines of the first scientific revolution with images of lightness: "[...] oggi il mondo si regge su entità sottilissime: come i messaggi del DNA, gli impulsi dei neuroni, i quarks, i neutrini vaganti nello spazio dall'inizio dei tempi [...]" (Saggi 1. 636). Contemporary science's focus on lightness inadvertently picks up again what Lucretius poetically had expressed many centuries before in his cosmogonie poem: "Il De rerum natura di Lucrezio è la prima grande opera di poesia in cui la conoscenza del mondo diventa dissoluzione della compattezza del mondo, percezione di ciô che è infinitamente minuto e mobile e leggero. Lucrezio vuole scrivere il poema della materia ma ci awerte subito che la vera realtà di questa materia è fatta di corpuscoli invisibili" (Saggi 1. 636). Calvino valued Lucretius's ability to describe in words the pulviscular existence of the world as an aesthetic and stylistic ideal that had practical methodological implications and served as a precondition of knowledge. He reads this emphasis on lightness at the microcosmic level into a range of authors, from Shakespeare to Cyrano de Bergerac, drawing attention to their connectedness to the prevailing paradigm. Shakespeare's Renaissance, for example, "conosce gli influssi eterei che connettono macrocosmo e microcosmo, dal firmamento neoplatonico agli spiriti dei metalli che si trasformano nel crogiolo degli alchimisti [...]" (Saggi 1. 646). Cyrano de Bergerac, on the other hand, is identified as the first true precursor to science fiction writing with a flair for atomism: "Seguace del sensismo di Gassendi e dell'astronomia di Copernico, ma soprattutto nutrito della 'filosofia naturale' del Rinascimento italiano — Cardano, Bruno, Campanella — Cyrano è il primo poeta dell'atomismo nelle letterature moderne" (Saggi 1. 648). Before Newton Cyrano describes gravity as a universal problem. Calvino points out the truly cosmic emotion expressed by the French writer, who celebrates the unity of the animate and inanimate worlds with irony and wit and traces the connectedness between humans with the animal and vegetable realm. The example brings to mind Calvino's own attempts of expressing a cosmic connection between humans, the macrocosm and microcosm in Cosmicomiche and I nostri antenati, both of which are clearly inspired and informed by Bergerac's creative recourse to natural philosophy. But let us return for a moment to the notion of beginnings. As mentioned earlier, Calvino had abandoned the completed lecture "Cominciare e finire" in favour of the lecture dedicated to the value of "leggerezza," evidently one of his most treasured stylistic principles. Importantly, this choice allowed Calvino to bring together in the opening lecture Ovid and Lucretius, whose respective works, Metamorphoses and De rerum natura, are important blueprints of a literature as natural philosophy. Most importantly, they demonstrate possibilities of tracing an interconnected map of the world and the knowable (Saggi 1. 722). Ovid's continuous narrative poem of all available myths and legends is an example of the encyclopaedic vocation Calvino's prose aspired to. Juxtaposing</page><page sequence="11">Calvino's (Post)modern Re-evaluation of Cosmogony 201 Lucretius and Ovid in his first lecture allowed Calvino to open his lectures with a reference to the oldest narrative form: myth. He begins by juxtaposing Ovid's description of the petrified "pesantezza" with the lightness of Perseus and the example of how Medusa's petrification can be turned into its opposite: the winged horse Pegasus. The importance of myth, Calvino reminds us, is in the image it provides. "La lezione che possiamo trarre da un mito sta nella letteralità del racconto, non in ciô che vi aggiungiamo noi dal di fuori" (Saggi 1. 632). In another lecture, "Visibilité," he elaborates on the implications this notion has for his process of writing. He explains that his stories similarly tend to start with an image that somehow harbours a story to be told, and the resulting narration is an attempt at formulating its significance in words.7 This process, he acknowledges, is typical of myth. The mention of myth brings us back to Kuhn's paradoxical question whether myth may be produced by the same sort of reasoning that underpins contemporary science. An answer to this issue comes from the work of the Italian-born historian of science Giorgio de Santillana, whom Calvino had met during his first visit to the USA in 1959-60. Calvino dedicated his third lecture, "Esattezza," to Santillana, in recognition of their friendship and the profound impact a lecture he attended in 1963 in Italy had on him at a point of crisis. Santillana's lecture on the importance of myth as a first scientific language provided an important creative stimulus as it demonstrated the interconnectedness of all things. Calvino recalls: Ascoltando la conferenza nel 1963, ne ebbi come la rivelazione d'un nodo d'idee che forse già ronzavano confusamente nella mia testa ma che m'era difficile esprimere; e sarebbero state difficili da esprimere anche dopo, ma da quel momento sono stato cosciente d'una distanza da colmare, d'un qualcosa a cui "far fronte." (Santillana: "Ed è cosa da poco che il nome stesso della scienza in greco, epistéme, significhi far fronte'}"). Dico I'idea che nessuna storia e nessun pensiero umani possano darsi se non situandoli in rapporto a tutto cio che esiste indipendentemente dall'uomo; I'idea d'un sapere in cui il mondo della scienza moderna e quello della sapienza antica si riunifichino. (Saggi 2. 2088) Calvino's cosmicomical stories, most of which start from a scientific explanation or hypothesis about the origin of the universe and its many forms, can be seen as a direct translation of Santillana's theory that myths start from a scientific hypothesis. In his lecture Santillana illustrated that scientific practice as we know it today has its precursor in humanity's first attempts to create meaning and understand the workings of the cosmos by observing the night sky and marking down with precision the movements of the stars. This led to a first technical or scientific language, preceding the alphabet and having reached us in the form of myth: "I cosiddetti mid storici si rivelano all'analisi costruzioni 7 "[...] o meglio, sono le immagini Stesse che sviluppano le loro potenzialità implicite, il racconto che esse portano dentro di sé" (Saggi 1. 704).</page><page sequence="12">202 Kerstin Pilz astronomiche" (Santillana 327). In other words, the ancients translated scientific data as they perceived them into narrative knowledge in order to make this data more tangible. Significantly, this pre-historic attention to numbers and precision, a true "fiiror mensurandi," as Santillana refers to it, driven by the quest for harmony of numbers, has conditioned our collective imagination to privilege symmetry and order as aesthetic and moral ideals, and still continues to influence our scientific paradigms (Santillana 324-45). Calvino's own works are prominent examples of this tendency. He valued "esattezza" for a variety of reasons. Exactitude describes his penchant for geometrical and ordered narrative structures. This preference is best captured in the mathematical precision of the tables of contents that accompany and frame many of Calvino's prose fictions. Exactitude is also a value that satisfies his predilection for precise description, for which Lucretius and Leonardo da Vinci as well as modern "cosmogonie" writers such as Valéry and Ponge serve as examples. Ponge, the "Lucretius of our times," "ricostruisce la fisicità del mondo attraverso l'impalpabile pulviscolo delle parole" (Saggi 1. 693). Calvino identifies this emphasis on writing as "un incessante inseguire le cose, un'approssimazione non alla loro sostanza ma all'infinita loro varietà, uno sfiorare la loro multiforme inesauribile superficie" (Saggi 1. 693) as a method for pursuing knowledge. Likewise, Leonardo da Vinci used writing in the form of precise description as a means of reasoning, which demonstrates that the methods of scientific reasoning are not exclusively those of abstraction and mathematical patterns and theorems, but coincide with those of writers of fiction. "Per questo," Calvino concludes "il giusto uso del linguaggio per me è quello che permette di awicinarsi alle cose (presenti o assenti) con discrezione e attenzione e cautela, col rispetto di ciô che le cose (presenti o assenti) comunicano senza parole" (Saggi 1. 694). The examples Calvino provides in this lecture illustrate that literature and science coincide in their methods and in their ambitions to explain the unknowable through precise verbal articulation. This suggestion implies a deep gnoseological connection of literature and science that precedes the fragmentation into branches of knowledge and indeed links us to our prehistoric ancestors: Credo che i nostri meccanismi mentali elementari si ripetono dal Paleolitico dei nostri padri cacciatori e raccoglitori attraverso tutte le culture della storia umana. La parola collega la traccia visibile alla cosa invisibile, alla cosa assente, alia cosa desiderata o temuta, come un fragile ponte di fortuna gettato sul vuoto. (Saggi 1. 694) In becoming the bridge between the visible and the invisible worlds, the written word contains images of exactitude that serve as guiding principles for the use of language itself. The crystal is one such image that visualises Calvino's</page><page sequence="13">Calvino's (Post)modern Re-evaluation of Cosmogony 203 ideal of writing. He had proposed the crystal at various stages during his career, with varying emphases on its quality as an emblem of order and complexity and as a symbol of an impersonal rationality inherent in nature.8 In Lezioni americane he returns to the crystal as an element that joins the inanimate with that of living organisms: II cristallo, con la sua esatta sfaccettatura e la sua capacité di rinffangere la luce, è il modello di perfezione che ho sempre tenuto come un emblema, e questa predilizione è diventata ancor più significativa da quando si sa che certe propriété délia nascita e délia crescita dei cristalli somigliano a quelle degli esseri biologici più elementari, costituendo quasi un ponte tra mondo minérale e mondo vivente. (,Saggi 1. i Calvino quotes here from the foreword by his friend Massimo Piattelli Palmarini to a volume on language acquistion where the crystal theme ("immagine d'invarianza e di regolarità di strutture specifiche") is juxtaposed with that of the flame ("immagine di costanza d'una forma globale esteriore, malgrado l'incessante agitazione interna").10 It is revealing that after having upheld the crystal throughout his life as a guiding principle, towards the end of his life, indeed in what was to become his literary testament, Calvino is finally able to acknowledge, albeit not embrace, its opposite in positive terms. Crystal and flame, he explains, are two emblems of perfect beauty, "due simboli morali, due assoluti, due catégorie per classificare fatti e idee e stili e sentimenti" (Saggi 1. 689)." He had previously explored the negative connotations of the flame model in pessimistic scenarios, such as the cosmicomical tale "I cristalli," where Qfwfq is painfully aware of the negative consequences of the Second Law of Thermodynamics which appears to have pushed the universe irreversibly down a path of destruction and dissipation. Calvino first proposes the crystal motif alongside his call for an interdisciplinary approach to culture in 1967 as an emblem of complexity. Yet he points out, nonetheless, that imitation of the perfection of the crystal is an unachievable ideal and, as a consequence, his rigidly structured novels always contain an arbitrary element, an imperfection that leaves him dissatisfied (Saggi 2. 2831). 9 A likely inspiration for Calvino's use of the crystal motif is Queneau's Petite cosmogonie, where, as Calvino observes in his guide to the poem, it is an important motif symbolising the passage from geometrical perfection to organic bio-diversity: "11 motivo piü insistito del poema è [...] il passaggio dai cristalli ai virus, da una moltiplicazione di forme geometriche a una moltiplicazione biomorfa" ("Piccola guida" 166). 10 Calvino quoted from a debate by Noam Chomsky and Jean Piaget about language acquisition, Théories du language — Théories de l'apprentissage (1980), to which Piattelli Palmarini had written the foreword. " See Pilz 46-48 for a more detailed interpretation of "I cristalli" in light of complexity science.</page><page sequence="14">204 Kerstin Pilz Qfwfq's emotions of despair at the sight of disorder and chaos are coherent with scientific theory about the destructive force of entropy (symbolised by the flame model) and instability and breakdown of balance in complex systems. While theories such as René Thorn's "catastrophe theory," for example, had dominated the Seventies, the close of that decade saw also the emergence of a positive epistemology in the form of the new science of complexity. Most importantly, Prigogine and Stengers in their influential book Order out of Chaos: Man's New Dialogue with Nature, which Calvino reviewed enthusiastically in 1980 as "a passionate mediation on Man and Universe," converted the negative connotations of disorder and instability into a positive force and showed how chance and determinism could be linked in a more meaningful way. In the Norton lectures Calvino re-evaluates his previous conception of the crystal as a static model of symmetric perfection and reappraises it in terms of the science of complexity as a self-organising system halfway between the stillness of the crystal and the turbulence of the flame: II gusto della composizione geometrizzante di cui potremmo tracciare una storia nella letteratura mondiale a partire da Mallarmé, ha sullo sfondo l'opposizione ordine disordine, fondamentale nella scienza contemporanea. L'universo si disfa in una nube di calore, précipita senza scampo in un vortice d'entropia, ma all'interno di questo processo irreversibile possono darsi zone d'ordine, porzioni d'esistente che tendono verso una forma, punti privilegiati da cui sembra di scorgere un disegno, una prospettiva. L'opera letteraria è una di queste minime porzioni in cui l'esistente si cristallizza in una forma, acquista un senso non fisso, non definitivo, non irrigidito in una immobilité minérale ma vivente come un organismo. La poesia è la grande nemica del caso, pur essendo anch'essa figlia del caso e sapendo che il caso in ultima istanza avrà partita vinta. "Un coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard." (.Saggi 1.1 Yet, as I have argued elsewhere, whilst in theory Calvino was ready to embrace new epistemological perspectives inclusive of chance and disorder and indeed modified his definition of the crystal accordingly, he did so reluctantly, as expressed in the anguish and disorientation his characters experience. The above quotation, as well as other examples throughout Lezioni americane, makes clear that Calvino maintained a sustained dialogue with science in an effort to link his formal and stylistic choices to a wider cosmological model. In another context he had identified cosmology as "lo studio di possibili 'modelli' di universo" and cosmogony as "quella branca della cosmologia che studia l'universo in divenire, la sua origine ed evoluzione, la sua storia" (Romanzi e racconti 2. 1305). The Norton lectures illustrate literature's importance in advancing knowledge due to its creative capacity to test out and develop the models science offers: "La forza della letteratura sta nel suo presentarsi come un'esposizione permanente di modelli dell'universo, in un'epoca in cui i modelli dell'universo sono degli strumenti indispensabili per</page><page sequence="15">Calvino's (Post)modern Re-evaluation of Cosmogony 205 pensare" (Saggi 2. 2978). While in his cosmicomical tales Calvino had creatively explored various scientific scenarios, his hypemovel Se una notte d'inverno un viaggiatore is directly informed by, and even anticipates, as I illustrate elsewhere, chaos theory and complexity science (Pilz 125-32). But rather than taking a scientific theory and transforming it into entertaining fictions, as he had done in the cosmicomical tales, in his last completed novel Calvino is continuing and refining his search for a model of the encyclopaedic novel. As he explains in the lecture "Molteplicità," modern and postmodern literature has returned to a very ancient ambition and tradition in literature, one that existed before its modern categorisation into genres: "[...] il romanzo contemporaneo come enciclopedia, come metodo di conoscenza, e soprattutto come rete di connessione tra i fatti, tra le persone, tra le cose del mondo" (Saggi 1. 717). Since science shuns generalisations and has fragmented into specialised branches, it is up to literature to take on the challenge of providing an inclusive, cosmogonie image where different branches of knowledge can be linked again into an organic whole: "[...] la grande sfida per la letteratura è il saper tessere insieme i diversi saperi e i diversi codici in una visione plurima, sfaccettata del mondo" (Saggi 1. 722-23). It is facing up to this ambition, even if unachievable, that will ensure literature's importance. Calvino advocates here what could essentially be construed as a controversial proposition, given the postmodern fragmentation of master narratives, where totalising ambitions are associated with exclusion and restriction. Yet he is careful to add that, unlike medieval literature, that tended to enclose knowledge in structures of static symmetries tied to a belief system of unifying order, such as that which underpins Dante's Divina commedia (Saggi 1. 726), the modern and postmodern encyclopedia becomes an open web: "Oggi non è più pensabile una totalité che non sia Potenziale, congetturale, plurima" (Saggi 1. 726). His search for a model of potential literature takes inspiration from Lucretius's atomism, Raymond Lull's ars combinatoria, Leibniz's system of monads, information science and the experimentations of potential literature conducted by the Oulipo group. Calvino's combinatorial novels emulate the principles inherent in Lucretius's atomism, i.e., the idea that an overwhelmingly complex world can be reduced to a finite number of discrete units or building blocks. Calvino's combinatory novels are likewise based on a finite set of elements (the 78 tarot cards in II castello dei destini incrociati, 55 travel reports in Le città invisibili, 10 beginnings of 10 different novels in Se una notte) that denote an infinite potential of combinations and imply mutability and openness. At the basis of this form of writing is Calvino's predilection for the short story or petit-poème-en-prose. The short text requires a maximum of precision of expression and allows him to create a unique form of narrative tension, through the exploration of abstract ideas and spaces within the confined space of a few pages. As he explains in the lecture "Rapidité," his ambition is the paradoxical</page><page sequence="16">206 Kerstin Pilz notion of combining the macrocosm within the microcosm of the short text: "[...] sogno immense cosmologie, saghe ed epopee racchiuse nelle dimensioni d'un epigramma" (Saggi 1. 673). It is interesting to note that Lyotard defines the short text or petit récit as "the quintessential fonn of imaginative invention, most particularly in science" (60), since scientific experiments can be viewed as "so many smaller narratives or stories to be worked out" (xi). Lyotard points out that the short text is characteristic of postmodernism, since it replaces the totalising grand narratives of legitimation of knowledge. Yet while Calvino's "atomised" narratives are on the one hand linked to the postmodern episteme, they are also firmly embedded within the Italian literary tradition, which as he observes, has always been "povera di romanzieri ma sempre ricca di poeti" (Saggi 1. 671). Combinatorics not only provides a concrete literary model that allows Calvino to create ordered structures that nevertheless imply fluidity and openness. As he explains in the lecture "Visibilité," it furthermore mirrors the definition of the imagination as a "repertorio del potenziale, dell'ipotetico, di ciô che non è né è stato né forse sarà ma che avrebbe potuto essere" (Saggi 1. 706). This definition draws on Giordano Bruno's conception of a spiritus phantasticus as "un mondo o un golfo, mai saturabile, di forme e d'immagini per ogni forma di conoscenza" (Saggi 1. 706). As Calvino explains, it is a concept that applies both to the writer and the scientist, whose imagination at a crucial point becomes charged with visual associations as a way of sifting through the infinity of forms. Calvino's definition of the realm of the imagination updates Giordano Bruno's view of the world as "mundus quidem et sinus inexplebilis formarum et specierum" in accordance with the current paradigm and technologies, which Calvino likens to a computer: "La fantasia è una specie di macchina elettronica che tiene conto di tutte le combinazioni possibili e sceglie quelle che rispondono a un fine, o che semplicemente sono le più interessanti, piacevoli, divertenti" (Saggi 1. 707). Calvino did not live to see the proliferation of computer technology and the advent of new textualities through the world wide web, although his hypemovels clearly anticipate similar forms of textuality, and were inspired by the flowering of information science and cybernetics.12 In fact, the computer analogy illustrates another cognitive and aesthetic value to which one of the Norton lectures is dedicated: "Rapidité." The computer provides a technology that matches the model of the hypernovel as it makes possible tapping into the inherent potentialty of the hypernovel by way of a virtual shuffling and 12 Usher provides a very useful reading of the metaphor of the computer in Calvino's work.</page><page sequence="17">Calvino's (Post)modem Re-evaluation of Cosmogony 207 reorganisation of the individual short texts13 Most importantly, the new technology is based on principles of speed that capture Calvino's aspiration for "quickness" as a way of accessing simultaneously the vastness of forms. This emphasis on quickness in narrative pace is illustrated in some of the oldest narrative forms Calvino had always held dear: "II mio lavoro di scrittore è stato teso fin dagli inizi a inseguire il fulmineo percorso dei circuiti mentali che catturano e collegano punti lontani dello spazio e del tempo. Nella mia predilezione per l'awentura e la fiaba cercavo sempre F équivalente d'un'energia interiore, d'un movimento délia mente" (Saggi 1. 670). The most important role model for this form of narrative tension and pace is Ariosto's Orlando furioso, which illustrates movement — in the form of travellers who traverse immense distances at lightening speed — as a guarantor of fluid non-totalising representations of multiplicity. Likewise, Galileo, whom Calvino hailed as Italy's greatest prose writer who deserves to be famous as a "felice inventore di metafore fantasiose quanto lo è come rigoroso ragionatore scientifico" (Saggi 1. 366), provides a metaphor of quickness. A favourite metaphor Galileo employed in his Gedankenexperimente to describe the speed of thought is the horse, resulting in the analogy that "il discorrere è come il correre." Calvino valued Galileo's prose for this ability to merge a method of reasoning — the essential features of "il pensar bene" being speed and the agility of thought — with literary style (Saggi 1. 666). Significantly, Calvino's model of the "open encyclopedia" is written under the patronage of the Olympian God Hermes-Mercury, a patron of speed and lightness, a messenger between different discourses, who connects the multiple and the disconnected, the local and the global. Mercury, the Roman equivalent of Hermes, is the god who presides over the challenge for literature to return to its role as cultural unifier: Mercurio con le ali ai piedi, leggero e aereo, abile e agile e adattabile e disinvolto, stabilisée le relazioni degli dèi tra loro e quelle tra gli dèi e gli uomini, tra le leggi universali e i casi individual^ tra le forze della natura e le forme délia cultura, tra tutti gli oggetti del mondo e tra tutti i soggetti pensanti. Quale migliore patrono potrei scegliere per la mia proposta di letteratura? (Saggi 1. 673-74) Calvino's choice of patronage situates his memos for the next millennium in the context of an alternative philosophy of science that was emerging at the end of the Seventies and gained prominence during the time he composed the lectures. Michel Serres, for example, adopts Hermes in his role as "weaver of 13 In 1975, together with members of the Oulipo group, Calvino participated in one of the first experiments of computer-aided writing at the Centre Pompidou, held under the guidance of the Oulipean computer expert Paul Brafford.</page><page sequence="18">208 Kerstin Pilz spaces" as the patron of his alternative philosophy of science of plural spaces, fluids and turbulence, which re-evaluates Lucretius's philosophy as an alternative to the dominant paradigm that had excluded disorder and chance as aberrations.14 Prigogine and Stengers's new science of complexity likewise re evaluated Lucretius's theory of atomism which provided a model of how order and disorder, determinism and indeterministic processes can be reconciled.15 The most immediate precursor of Calvino's reference to Mercury as a patron of a new understanding of literature, however, is Raymond Queneau's modern rewriting of Lucretius's cosmogony, Petite cosmogonie portative, where Hermes inhabits a central role. In his introduction to Queneau's poem, "Piccola guida alla piccola cosmogonia portable," Calvino draws the reader's attention immediately to the importance of Hermes-Mercury as a patron of rhetoric and eloquence. Hermes is summoned towards the middle of Queneau's Petite cosmogonie portative to explain the meaning of the poem, which lies in its perpetuation of a "saggezza diversa;" that is to say, an alternative epistemology that hails the recognition of disorder and randomness as a return of physics to nature. The "saggezza diversa," in other words, consists of the understanding that the artificial order of deterministic systems is a fortress of rational logic that suppresses the real, which is disorderly, indeterminate and fluid, like the powder-fine dust Lucretius describes dancing in the rays of sunlight penetrating a dark room. It is indicative that the posthumous publication of the lectures in the volume Lezioni americane opens and closes with a reference to Lucretius. Calvino concludes his lecture on "Molteplicità" with the observation that an important ambition of his prose had been that of honing his skills of precise description with the aim of capturing the objectivity of the material world, in an attempt to reach the essence of the common nature of things: "[...] magari fosse possible un'opera concepita al di fuori del self un'opera che ci permettesse d'uscire dalla prospettiva limitata d'un io individuale, non solo per entrare in altri io simili al nostra, ma per far parlare cio che non ha parola, l'uccello che posa sulla grondaia, Talbero in primavera e l'albero in autunno, la pietra, il cemento, la plastica [...]" (Saggi 1. 733). Lucretius and Ovid's prose, Calvino concludes, demonstrate this ability. Modem science is of course another discourse that claims an objective and detached description of the world: "[...] la scienza mi intéressa proprio nel mio 14 See for example Hermes: Literature, Science, Philosophy. 15 "In Lucretian physics we thus again find the link we have discovered in modern knowledge between the choices underlying a physical description and a philosophic, ethical, or religious conception relating to man's situation in nature [...]. Classical science from Archimedes to Clausius was opposed to the science of turbulence and of bifurcating changes" (304).</page><page sequence="19">Calvino's (Post)modern Re-evaluation of Cosmogony 209 sforzo per uscire da una conoscenza antropomorfa: da ciô la mia scommessa di rappresentare antropomorficamente un universo in cui l'uomo non è mai esistito, anzi dove sembra estremamente improbabile che l'uomo possa mai esistere" {Saggi 1. 706). The paradox of how to escape the confines of an anthropomorphic representation of the world is a thread running through all of Calvino's works. In one of the Palomar stories his alter ego's contemplation of his own death sparks a wider reflection on the death of humanity, when planet Earth has become a wasteland visited by extraterrestrials searching for traces of our civilisation. Palomar decides that if time itself will have to come to an end, it is possible to describe it, instant by instant: "Decide che si metterà a descrivere ogni istante della sua vita, e finché non Ii avrà descritti tutti non penserà più d'essere morto. In quel momento muore" (Romanzi e racconti 2. 979). In an ironie parallel, Calvino's own death was preceded by the time he dedicated to the Norton lectures. In them he does not so much describe an objective reality, but the complex interconnectedness of the microcosm of his own works and his subjectivity as a writer with the wider macrocosm of literature and other discourses of knowledge. The lectures trace his intellectual life, which in itself is nothing but an open web of interconnected possibilities: "Ogni vita è un'enciclopedia, una biblioteca, un inventario d'oggetti, un campionario di stili, dove tutto puô essere continuamente rimescolato e riordinato in tutti i modi possibili" (Saggi 1. 733). With the Norton lectures he attempted to give a momentary form to his cosmos of knowledge; he could not have foreseen that they would become, to use his own analogy, a permanent pocket of order withstanding the forces of entropy. As such the lectures survive as a literary testament and a map of the territory where literature and other discourses of knowledge intersect, a testament that has at once surpassed yet remains forever tied to a singular, visionary subjectivity.
