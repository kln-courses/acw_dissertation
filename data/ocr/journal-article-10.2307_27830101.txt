<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARISTOTLE'S UNMOVED MOVERS By PHILIP MERLAN According to Aristotle1 all heavenly movement is ultimately due to the ac tivity of forty-seven (or fifty-five) 'unmoved movers'. This doctrine is highly remarkable in itself and has exercised an enormous historical influence. It forms part of a world-picture the outlines of which are as follows. The universe consists of concentric spheres, revolving in circles. The outermost of these bears the fixed stars. The other either bear planets or, insofar as they do not, contribute indirectly to the movements of the latter. Each sphere is moved by the one immediately surrounding it, but also possesses a movement of its own, due to its mover, an unmoved, incorporeal being. (It was these beings which the schoolmen designated as the intelligentiae separatae.) The seemingly irregular movements of the planets are thus viewed as resulting from the com bination of regular circular revolutions. The earth does not move and occupies the centre of the universe. Such was Aristotle's astronomic system,2 essential parts of which were almost universally adopted by the Arabic, Jewish, and Christ ian philosophers of the Middle Ages.3 Famous as this theory is, it seems, however, inextricably to entangle Aristotle with difficulties and self-contradictions. It is expounded in Met. 84 and it is here that the difficulties just hinted at reveal themselves. The status of the problem would seem to be this: In the preceding chapters of book , especially in ch.s 6 and 7, the principle of monotheism seems to be clearly established : one unmoved mover only is here referred to. But ch. 8 reads as if a sudden invasion of polytheism had taken place: the unprepared reader is confronted with the question: Now, is there only one such mover, or are there many, and, in the latter case, how many? And the answer is that there are forty-seven (or fifty-five) of them. It is only in ch. 9 that the monotheistic conception returns and is upheld to the very end of the book: ts Koipavos ? . Can it be denied that an irreconciliable and indeed an almost grotesque contradiction obtains between these two theories, one un moved mover?forty-seven unmoved movers? 11 am indebted to the late Professor H. Gomperz for reading this paper in manuscript, for aiding me in bringing it into its present form, and for contributing by some of his criti cisms to its content also. 2 Two furth?r assumptions, however, also formed part of this system: spheres and stars were supposed to consist of ether, and the latter were viewed as living beings. See my paper Simplikios-Zitat bei Pseudo-Alexandros und ein Plotinos-Zitat bei Simplikios,' in Rheinisches Museum 84 (1935) 154-160 (cf. P. Duhem, Le syst?me du monde IV [Paris 1916] 422-428); my review of R. Walzer, Aristotelis dialogorum fragmenta, in Philologische Wochen schrift 58 (1938) 65-69, and W. . C.

London 1929) lxxi; P. H. Wicksteed, The Reactions Between Dogma and Philosophy (London 1920) 33f. 4 1073a 14-1074b 14. In Physics 6 it is hardly more than alluded to. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 TRADITIO Furthermore, ch. 8 appears to be inconsistent in itself. It comprises a section in which, in sharp contrast with the rest of the chapter, the monotheistic position is emphasized: according to this passage there is but one world and one mover.5 Finally, any plurality of movers seems to be incompatible with some of Aris totle's fundamental principles: if these movers are immaterial, they cannot dif fer from one another since matter is the only principle of individuation ;6 if, on the other hand, they are not purely immaterial, they cannot be eternal.7 And this dilemma is the more puzzling since it would seem to be emphasized by Aristotle himself in the section just mentioned.8 Such are the difficulties of the problem. The following discussion proposes to show that, in Aristotle's mind, the problem of the unmoved movers was closely bound up with certain views held, according to Aristotle, by Plato and the Acad emy and, in particular, with their conception of Ideal Numbers; and that some of the difficulties and apparent contradictions emerging from that problem were, or at least appeared to Aristotle, less striking when viewed against this Platonic background. For the purpose of shedding some light on this background we must first recall some facts concerning the structure of Aristotle's metaphysics.9 5 Metaph. 8, 1074a 31-38. 6 At least according to the rather generally accepted interpretation of Aristotle. But cf. . 46 infra. 7 Cf. Metaph. 2, 1088b 14-28. 8 Cf. W. Jaeger, Aristotle (London 1934) 354. Jaeger's solution is as follows: (1) The whole of ch. 8 is a later addition. Originally, the entire book was based on the assumption that there is one unmoved mover only. (2) Later, Aristotle adopted the conception of 47 movers in order to adjust his metaphysics to the views of contemporary science. He thereby involved himself in difficulties from which he was unable to extricate himself, chiefly because a plurality of immaterial movers is inconceivable, according to Aristotelian principles. But the philosopher himself became aware of this impossibility and brooded over it. Section 1074a 31-38 contains his meditations on the problem. It was originally written on a loose 'sheet' and was incorporated into the text by the editors of the Meta physics. The passage flatly contradicts the doctrine of a plurality of movers and is ob viously foreign to the context of ch. 8, and is indeed destructive of its argument.?Jaeger's interpretation has been almost universally adopted. Only, it has often been assumed that 1074a 31-38 was not inserted later but presents a remnant of an earlier and more con sistently monotheistic phase of Aristotle's development. Cf. W. K. C. Guthrie, 'The Development of Aristotle's Theology,' Classical Quarterly 1934, pp. 90-98 and esp. 91 n. 1 ; R.

Dockx, 'De Theorie von den Onbewogen Beweger bij Aristoteles,' Tijdschrift voor Philosophie 1 (1939) 747-800. 9 According to Jaeger, Aristotle implicitly assigned three different meanings to the term 'first philosophy' in three successive stages of his development. In the first phase, it is conceived as Theology and, as such, as the knowledge of but one, the highest d?parte ment of being, this phase being represented best by Metaph. . In the second stage?that of transition?it means something like metaphysical logic; the knowledge of being as being</page><page sequence="3">aristotle's unmoved movers 3 One of the basic questions in Aristotle's metaphysics is: What is a? This question, however, is often expressed in another form: How many a are there? In this form it is first raised in Metaph. 1, 995b 14 (= 2, 997a 34): Are there sensible a only, or are there others besides? And if so, how many? This problem, viz. the problem referring to the number and the types of a , is traced back by Aristotle to Plato who, as Aristotle holds,10 distin guished three types of a: Forms, mathematical objects, sensible objects.11 It is obviously this Platonic classification of Being on which Aristotle bases a classification of 'philosophies'.12 'Physics' deals with sensible objects;12a mathe matics with mathematical objects; theology with that division of Being which, in Aristotle's philosophy, occupies the place of Plato's Forms.13 For, the most outstanding characteristics of Plato's Forms are these: they are eternal and un moved14 and 'separated' from the realm of sensible things. And it is obvious that the subject-matter of Aristotle's theology is of precisely the same nature: it is something separated, eternal, and unmoved.15 (Metaph. and E). In the third and final stage (which, however, was never fully and con sistently worked out) it means knowledge of the Supersensible based on, and including, that of the Sensible (the latter also being a legitimate object of metaphysics); and it is this final view which underlies the discussion of Metaph. , , (in which ???os is conceived as imbedded in matter) and M 1-9 (where a new metaphysical approach is launched).?For criticism see H. F. Cherniss in The American Journal of Philology 56 (1935) 261-271, esp. 265. It is at any rate metaphysics as theology, whether representing a particular stage or only a particular aspect of Aristotle's philosophy, that we must here consider. 10 It must be emphasized that the question, to what extent Aristotle's account of Plato's philosophy is correct, may be entirely disregarded for the purposes of the following discus sion, for we are here concerned solely with Aristotle's self-interpretation by means of his interpretation?right or wrong?of Plato. 11 Metaph.

D. Ross, Aristotle's Metaphysics (London 1924) lxxviii. In Phys. 2, 193b 22-36 and 194b 14 the distinction of these three 'philosophies' is likewise presupposed. On the history of this famous trichotomy see J. Mari?tan, Probl?me de la classification des sciences d'Aristote ? St.-Thomas (St.-Maurice and Paris 1901) and L.

Maritain, The Degrees of Knowledge (London 1937) 44-46. Cf. also E. Zeller, Die Philosophie der Griechen II 2 (4th ed. Leipzig 1921) 181 . 3. To the Platonic root of this tripartite division no sufficient attention seems to be paid; I intend to return to this topic and to the question of how 'degrees of being' became gradually trans formed into 'degrees of knowledge'.

It is ob vious that modifications of Plato's tripartite division were the order of the day: a thinker did not cease being a Platonist by such a modification, at least not by a modification of the type just indicated. Now, it is well known that Aristotle did not recognize either Forms or mathe matical objects as a separate, self-sufficient, independent division of Being.18 It is all the more interesting therefore to find that Met. A likewise starts with a trichotomy. Even if this were all, it might suggest that Aristotle was, at the time, still closely attached to certain forms of Platonic thinking. But the Platonism of the passage is evidently not limited to the form of trichotomy. There are three a , says Aristotle: the Sensible and Perishable; the Sensible and Imperishable; and the Unmoved. And Aristotle goes on to say: There are some who split the Unmoved into two, Forms and mathematical objects, while others avoid such a split, either by identifying Forms and mathematical objects, or by discarding Forms altogether.19 This remark shows clearly that Aristotle was well aware of the fact that his division was closely linked to the divisions propounded by Plato and his disciples, and this is all the more significant be cause it is one of the chief aims of book A to show that there really is an un moved a in addition to the two types of sensible a (perishable and im perishable), viz. the unmoved mover. Thus, it is Aristotle himself who prompts us to compare his division with the divisions of the Academy, and the following synopsis outlines such a comparison: Plato Other Platonists Aristotle The Sensible The Sensible The Sensible and Perish able The Sensible and Imper ishable The Mathematical The Unmoved The Unmoved = Forms The Unmoved The Forms = Mathematical; or = Mathematical alone (the existence of Forms being denied) u Metaph.

For the purpose of describing it as such we might say that, whereas others split the sphere of the Unmoved in two, Aristotle performed the same operation on that of the Sensible, splitting it into the Perishable and the Imperishable. As is well known, the sphere of the 'Sensible and Imperishable' is that of the heavenly bodies and the science that investigates it is Astronomy. And in this sense it might be said that, in Aristotle's system, Astronomy re placed Mathematics. But we cannot even say that this modification of the Platonic schema was peculiar to Aristotle alone, because we find it in Xenocrates also.20 Xenocrates, like Aristotle, posited three divisions of Being: objects of sensation, i.e. things within the celestial sphere; objects of opinion, or 'composite', i.e. the heavens; objects of knowledge, i.e. things beside the celestial sphere. The first of these divisions does not call for any comment.21 But it is interesting to learn why the objects within the second division were termed 'composite' by Xenocrates. It was because they were, on the one hand, visible and hence objects of sensa tion, and, on the other hand, the subject-matter of astronomy, and hence objects of knowledge. And in this respect they correspond exactly to Aristotle's realm of the Sensible and Imperishable. The third division, things 'beside' the heavenly sphere, naturally reminds us, first of all, of Plato's Ideas since these, in the Phaedrus, are located 'beyond the heaven'. But we must not overlook the fact that this expression may be appropriately applied to Aristotle's Unmoved Mover no less than to Plato's Ideas. Aristotle's 'new' classification is thus very Platonic; it almost coincides with that of Xenocrates. Who first propounded it, is, of course, immaterial. Indeed, how could we determine the issue of prior ity? Xenocrates and Aristotle lived, studied, and speculated together for about twenty-three years, and a perpetual give and take must have gone on between them. Let us now return to our diagram. It shows clearly that there was a common heritage of views shared in by Aristotle as well as by other Platonists, to the effect that there are several spheres of Being ( a ) ; their characteristics are expressed by predicates like Perishable, Moved, Not-separated; Eternal, Im perishable, Unmoved, Separated; and each of these spheres forms the subject matter of a specific 'philosophy'.22 Hence, a common problem is involved in 20Xenocr. fr. 5 Heinze and pp. 3ff. and 75 Heinze. Cf. Ross, Arist. Metaph. lxxv n. 2; also Theophrastus' Metaphysics ed. Ross and Fobes (London 1929) 56f. Incidentally, it is worth noting that it is, virtually, impossible to tell whether in Rep. VI 13, 500c, Plato is speaking of ideas or else of celestial bodies. Cf. Arist. Metaph. 6, 1063a 16; 5, 1009a 30 and 1010a 30; H. Cherniss, Aristotle's Criticism of Plato and the Academy I (Baltimore 1944) 199 n. 117. 21 The expression kv tQ ohpavQ for a a occurs in Aristotle, e.g. Metaph. 2, 997b 7; cf. A 8, 990a 5; De c?elo I 9, 278b 19-21. 22 That the Sensible can be an object of 'philosophy', therefore true knowledge, seems to be a doctrine peculiar to Aristotle. But see F. Solmsen, Plato's Theology (Ithaca 1942) 82f.</page><page sequence="6">6 TRADITIO this common heritage : what is the nature of these several spheres and how are the predicates enumerated above to be distributed among them? As regards Aristotle, he, indeed, reserved full immutability to the highest sphere, but ex tended both eternity and indestructibility not, as had hitherto been done, to the mathematical objects (because he denied the existence of such objects), but, instead, to the heavenly bodies. In so far, as was said before, Astronomy replaces Mathematics and a further proof of this may be seen in the fact that it is by no means easy to determine whether Aristotle's Astronomy is a branch of Mathematics rather than of Physics.23 And so it is only natural that once at least the formula 'three philosophies,' which in Aristotle generally means theol ogy, mathematics, physics, should mean theology, astronomy, physics.24 An objection, however, might be raised. Even admitting, it may be asked, that the correspondence between the two lower divisions of Being as posited by Aristotle and the two lower divisions of Being as recognized by Plato and some of his followers is not a purely formal one,?can any but a purely formal analogy really be pointed out between Aristotle's highest division, the unmoved mover, and Plato's highest division, the Forms or Ideas? Was not the con cept of a First Mover the great discovery by which Aristotle ceased being a disciple among disciples? Although this may be correct, the analogy between the First Mover and the Ideas is still a real one and may even be worked out more fully. Only, one important qualification must be kept in mind; in order to be comparable to Aristotle's highest sphere of Being, the realm of the Ideas must be understood as Aristotle understood it, namely as comprising, or even being identical with, (ideal) Numbers. To what extent this interpretation of the Platonic theory is correct, is immaterial in this context. 'Plato's Ideas are Numbers' : that is what Aristotle frequently says and what he evidently held to be the truth.25 How, then, do the difficulties of book A present themselves to a reader familiar with Plato's theory of ideal numbers? In the preceding chapters of this book, 23 Cf. H. H. Joachim in his edition of Aristotle's De gen. et corr. (Oxford 1922) xix and xxii; Ross, Aristotle3 70; Metaph. A 8, 989b 34; E 1, 1026a 27. 24 In Phys. 7, 198a 29 we read: rp??s al - a^ a ^ a , and expect to find physics, mathe matics, theology, but find actually e irepl a , ?? irepl a a , irepl a a a. The second division obviously designates astronomy. Cf. . 12 i.f. 25 Metaph.

Ross. Arist. Metaph. lxiv if.; O. Becker, 'Die diairetische Erzeugung der Platonischen Idealzahlen,' Quellen und Studien. . . , Abt. I (1931), 464 501.?P. Shorey (e.g. in Plato, The Republic, Loeb Class. Libr. II, pp. xx and 164f.) denies emphatically the existence of such a doctrine in Plato's writings and is obviously very much inclined to deny its existence in Plato's teachings at all. The motive seems to be his conviction that both the identification of Ideas with Numbers and the distinction of ideal from mathematical numbers are 'silly' and could be maintained only by 'uncritical students of the Academy'. Shorey's attitude towards Aristotle's reports on Plato reminds one of Natorp. At any rate, for our present purposes, the historic correctness of Aristotle's report is of no importance. Cf. now also H. Cherniss, The Riddle of the Early Academy (Berkeley Los Angeles 1945) 17-30; 60.</page><page sequence="7">Aristotle's unmoved movers 7 as pointed out above, the existence of an unmoved a has been proved; it is represented by the 'first mover'. Most modern readers will feel that the prin ciple of monotheism has thereby been established ; but the more convinced they may be of this, the more they are likely to be shocked in reading the beginning of ch. 8: 'But is there only one such (unmoved) a, or are there several, and, if so, how many?' The question which Aristotle raises here?suddenly, as it might seem?he goes on to justify by referring to the Platonic and post-Platonic doctrines of Ideal Numbers: Our predecessors, he says, were not concerned about the number of such a . The theory of Ideas contains no proper treatment of this problem ( a y?p irepl ras L??as ? a ' a a ) ; ideas and numbers are identified with one another; but respecting the 'number' of these numbers no definite statements are made; sometimes these philosophers express themselves as if there were only 10 (ideal) numbers, sometimes, again, as if their number was infinite.26 But why just such or such a number of num bers is assumed, is never made clear and no conclusive arguments are advanced (a y?p \eyo ras Ideas X?yovres i??as, ? ?? , a ore cos irepl a e a, ?re de cos rrjs ?eic??os e . ' ' alr'iav r? 7rX?70os tco?&gt; a , o?d?v Xeyerai er? a^ o e r s). And it is by this clause that Aristotle introduces his reasons for assuming 47 (or 55) movers. Hence, it is obvious from his own words that Aristotle's teaching regarding the plurality and the number of the movers was by him meant to be an improvement on, or a counterpart to, the views current among Platonists with respect to the plurality and number of ideal numbers. In substance he seems to say: 'The doctrine of ideal numbers introduces an indefinite multitude of numbers and thereby of eternal and unmoved a , but I am the first to determine the pre cise number of such eternal and unmoved a .'27 This, then, is Aristotle's self-interpretation. In his opinion it is one and the same question that had been incompletely answered by the Platonic and post Platonic theories of Ideal Numbers and completely by his own speculations con cerning the Unmoved Movers, viz.: What is the exact number of unmoved a But we must remember that questions may be merely rhetorical and need not necessarily express a real doubt. Thus, when Aristotle asks (as he does time and again, in the Metaphysics) : Are there any a beside the sen sible a ?this is hardly more than a rhetorical question, because, being still a Platonist he does not seriously contemplate the possibility that his answer might be other than in the affirmative. And it would seem that when Aristotle asks: Is there more than one unmoved a}?this question, too, is hardly more than rhetorical since to a Platonist it is evident that there is, at any rate, more than one ideal number.28 And now the question can no longer be evaded: what, actually, does Aristotle mean by a? In the preceding pages the term has either not been translated 26 Cf. Metaph. M 8, 1084a 12; Phys. 6, 206b 32. 27 Metaph. 8, 1073a 14-22. Cf. Ross, Arist. Metaph. lxix f.; Jaeger, op. cit. 220 n. 3. 28 This explains why as early as ch. 6 (1071b 21) a plurality of eternal a is assumed as a matter of course. Cf. . 53 infra and Cherniss, Aristotle's Criticism I 220; 458 n. 406.</page><page sequence="8">8 TRADITIO at all or, in order to avoid the overworked substance, has been paraphrased by expressions like 'sphere' or 'division of being'. But it must be borne in mind that a, apart from other meanings, irrelevant in the present context, may mean ( 1 ) the entire sphere or division of being to which an obj ect belongs29 (and it is in this sense of the term that Aristotle speaks of three a ) and (2) a particular and individual (independent) object belonging to such a sphere or division (and it is in this sense of the term that Aristotle designates animals and plants as a ).30 In other words, a, in Aristotle, may mean both 'thing' and 'kind of thing',31 and will, in this paper, henceforth be rendered by entity12?a term which is perhaps vague enough to cover both meanings. Hence, when Aristotle, in the beginning of ch. 8 of book A asks whether only one 'such entity', or several, ought to be assumed, he seems really to ask: Does 'Highest Entity' or 'Unmoved Entity' (considered as a sphere of Being) comprise only one single entity (viz. one individual entity), or several such entities? And, furthermore, he seems to parallelize this question with another, which?according to him?Plato and his followers ought to have raised, namely: How many Ideal Numbers does the sphere of Ideal Numbers comprise? If this is correct, it can hardly be maintained that ch. 8 of book A exhibits a polytheistic tinge whereas the other chapters of the book reveal a monotheistic inspiration. It would seem, rather, as if the question concerning the number of Unmoved Movers, discussed by Aristotle, had had no more to do with the problem of monotheism or polytheism than a discussion on the number of Ideal Numbers would have had for Plato. It would seem to follow, furthermore, that in Aristotle's mind there was not the slightest contradiction between ch. 8 and the preceeding sections of the book. What he felt he had proved in these sec tions was that there is a sphere (and of course, one sphere only) of 'Unmoved Entity'. But whether or not this sphere comprises more than one unmoved entity was, as he understood it, still an entirely open question?open, of course, for his hearers rather than for the author who, being still a Platonist, probably felt sure from the very outset that the sphere of 'unmoved entity' comprised more than one unmoved entity. ?

To a reader of today the chapter concerning the 47 movers is almost an affront : he feels as if he had been precipitated from the loftiest heights of speculation to the flattest lowlands of pedantry.33 But let us suppose that Plato or one of his successors had actually done what Aristotle rebukes them for not having done ?let us suppose that they had actually worked out the number of Ideal Num bers and that their result had been preserved: would not this result appear to us as unpalatable as Aristotle's? The latter, as is well known, blamed his contem poraries for having turned philosophy into mathematics. Plato himself had done so and even his Timaeus is just on the brink, bearable only because of its mythological form.34 Aristotle's sole innovation consisted in turning philos ophy into astronomy, instead of mathematics.35 If more of the Academy's 'mathematical philosophy' had come down to us, our judgment on Aristotle's 47 movers might be less severe?or else our opinion of Platonism less high. Nor must we forget that when we compare Aristotle's note-books with Plato's published works, it is alrnost impossible for us to be fair to either.36 If the sudden introduction of 47 movers may, to a certain extent, be justified, or at least understood and explained by realizing how profoundly Aristotle was rooted in the tradition of Plato's old-age philosophy, might not this same fact also account for some of the other difficulties already referred to? Let us ask: whereby do Plato's ideal numbers differ from one another? Cer tainly not by their matter since the individualizing function of matter is a purely Aristotelian conception.37 They differ because every ideal number is unique in its kind.38 We should express this by saying: there is but one Oneness, one Twoness, and so on; in the Academy this would have read: there is but one ideal number One, one ideal number Two, and so forth. Hence, if Aristotle, in introducing his unmoved movers, had Plato's ideal numbers in mind as his 33 Cf. J. Lagrange, 'Comment s'est transform?e la pens?e religieuse d'Aristote,' Revue thomiste 1926, pp. 285-329, esp. 310f?. 34 It has been repeated so often how great an artist Plato was when compared with Aris totle that I beg leave to call to mind that even as a myth the Timaeus is often ugly or almost ridiculous.

It would be absurd to maintain that the Great and-Small, i.e. the Indefinite Quantity which is turned into a definite Quantity by the number Two was another Great-and-Small than that to which definiteness is imparted by the number Three. 38 Metaph.

It will be seen that this explanation is closely akin to that known as Thomis tic.39 St. Thomas interpreted the Unmoved Movers as angels and held every one of them to be an individual and a species at the same time.40 The inter pretation suggested above merely replaces the angels of Mohammedan, Jewish, and Christian exegetes by Plato's Ideal Numbers. But does this remove the difficulty that, according to Aristotelian principles, entities differing from one another cannot, as it would seem, be completely im material, if, according to these principles matter is indeed the only princ?pium individuationisf Indeed, in order to account for the differences among species, Aristotle assumed that, with respect to species, their common genus played a role analogous to that ordinarily played by matter with respect to individual objects: in its relation to the species, the genus is, in a sense, matter. Hence, even admitting that, in Aristotle's opinion, the Unmoved Movers differ from one another as species do, the difficulty would still remain. For, being species, 39 On this explanation see Ross, op. cit. exix and cxxxix. Actually, it is not specifically Thomistic since it was already known to Albertus Magnus: Metaph. XI, II, 10: 'coelestes . . . circuii habent animas sed praeter animas sunt intelligentiae separatae et has intelligentias Angelos vocant . . .'; XI, II, 28: 'omnes substantiae separatae differunt ab invicem specie . . . Sicut loco sphaerarum una est superior altera, ita etiam dignitate una substantia differt ab altera.' But his own opinion expressed in Summa theol. II, II, q. 7 reads: 'frivolum est dicere quod intelligentia movens aliquid corporum coelestium sit Angelus.'?The subjects of Albertus' vocant are, of course, philosophers like Avicenna, Averro?s, Maimonides (on whose interpretation of the unmoved movers see H.

For he had never abandoned a remarkable logical doctrine first worked out by his master (or attributed to him by Aristotle). Plato had contended that there is no Form or Idea corresponding to things like numbers, figures (and, strange as it may sound to us, constitutions), viz. to things standing to each other in the relation of 'prior and posterior'? a contention which, in Aristotelian terminology, means that such things do not form either a species or a genus.42 There is no species or genus 'number' apart from all particular numbers, no species or genus 'figure' apart from all triangles, quadrangles, etc. Hence, though ordinarily the genus may indeed be the 'in telligible matter' whereby its several species differ from one another, yet, for the Unmoved Movers, just as for the Ideal Numbers, an exception would have to be made, since the relationship of 'prior and posterior' obviously applies to them in the same sense in which it applies to the celestial spheres in which they move. According to Aristotle, Plato had defined the relation of 'prior and posterior' as follows: a is prior to b when a can exist without b whereas b can not exist without a.43 Now, according to Aristotle, every outer sphere contributes to the revolutions of all inner spheres while these do not react on its movement. Hence, the spheres evidently form a series wherein every outer sphere is prior to every inner one. Consequently Aristotle says explicitly that the Unmoved Movers are ordered according to the order of their spheres, so as to form a series: the first mover, second mover, etc.44 In this respect too, then, the Unmoved Movers resemble the Ideal Numbers. Since, among the latter, there is the relationship 'prior and posterior', there is no genus 'Ideal Number'. In the same way, since among the Unmoved Movers there is the same relationship, there is like wise no genus 'Unmoved Mover'. It follows that the Unmoved Movers, even though being in the division 'unmoved entity', must not, therefore, necessarily be a species of a genus 'unmoved mover'; nor must the division 'unmoved en tity' necessarily stand to them in the relation of a genus. It would seem, then, that even if Aristotle held the unmoved movers, on the one hand, to be strictly immaterial and yet, on the other hand, to differ specifically from one another, nonetheless these assumptions would not have been incompatible with the rest 41 Cf.

The solution of these problems will here be presented in the form of a concise commentary. The section will be paraphrased and some explanatory remarks will be added in brackets. Aristotle's argument would seem to be as follows: 'There is one heaven [or world: ovpav?s] only. For if there were several heavens, each of them would have to have its own First Mover [i.e., at least one First Mover of its own: per haps, in some of the worlds, there would have to be more than one mover; that would de pend on the number of heavenly bodies in every one of them]. These First Movers would participate in one and the same form and would yet be many in number. [Suppose there were two heavens: our present heaven, moved by 47 movers, and another one, moved by, say, 10 movers. There would then be two First Movers, two Second, Third, . . . and two Tenth Movers. The two Movers in each of these couples would participate in the same form, but would be two in number.] Now, things differing in number but not in form must have matter. But a First Mover [and a Second, Third, etc. Mover as well, the number of such movers depending on the num ber of heavenly bodies in each heaven] must, by definition, lack matter altogether. Hence, there can be only one First Mover, and consequently, only one heaven.'46 If the interpretation suggested here is correct, then the passage does not ex press any criticism of the assumption that there is a plurality of movers in one and the same world, and, more specifically, in our world; nor does it involve any other contention incompatible with the remainder of the chapter. Moreover, it becomes evident, that the section, far from being a later insertion of hetero geneous inspiration, cannot possibly ever have been absent from the context. 45 Do species ordered hierarchically form a genus??this is one of the crucial questions in M. J. Adler, Problems for Thomists (New York 1940), and in his 'Solution of the Problem of Species/ The Thomist 3 (1941) 279-379 (available to me through courtesy of the author). It would seem that by raising this question, Adler unwittingly revives the problem under lying the logical views of Plato and Aristotle discussed above. 46 It seems that this interpretation is akin to that given by Thomas Aquinas and Ps. Duns Scotus. The latter writes in his commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics (XII, II, c. V); 'Posset enim forsan aliquis dicere, quod sunt plures alii mundi, in quorum quolibet sunt plures, et tot sphaerae et motus, sicut et in isto et ideo oportet poner? plures im materiales substantias. Hoc ergo excludens dicit: "Quod autem sit unum coelum tantum manifestum est. Si enim essent plures coeli", supple numero et in eadem specie, "ut" sunt plures "homines", sequitur quod "princ?pium", supple primum et immobile, quod esset "circa unumquodque" primum coelum, fieret "unum specie, numero vero multa", ita quod essent plura prima principia secundum numerum communicantia in una specie, quod ostendit esse impossibile dicens: "Sed quaecunque sunt multa numero", et supple unum specie, "habent mat?ri?m". . . .'' St. Thomas' commentary ad loc. (2593-5 C?tala2) is almost identical; an additional note in Ps. Duns Scotus is, therefore, all the more inter esting: Aliqui pervertentes sensum literae, he says, maintain based on this Aristotelian pas sage that matter is causa individuationis. The aliqui refers, of course, to St. Thomas and the note is another contribution to the controversy matter vs. haecceitas as the principle of individuation. Cf. Duns Scotus in his commentary in II sent. dist. 3, q. 7; also Sharp, op. cit. ( . 39) 380f.</page><page sequence="13">aristotle's unmoved movers 13 In opening the chapter, Aristotle had pledged himself to indicate the precise num ber of unmoved movers and later on redeemed this pledge by showing that their number was either 47 or 55. Thereupon (1074a 17) he proceeds to prove that this number may not be increased. This proof falls into two parts. In the first part (1074a 17-31) it is pointed out that our world cannot comprise more than those 47 or 55 movers, the reason being that, in this our world, there are only 47 or 55 eternal and independent movements so that any additional movers would, so to speak, lack employment. In other words, additional movers would presuppose additional (independent and eternal) movements; but, in our world, such do not take place. But obviously, this demonstration would remain in complete could it not be supplemented by another one, to the effect that there are not, and cannot be, other heavens beside our own in every one of which eter nal and independent movements might also be going on; in which case an in definite number of additional unmoved movers would have to be assumed and the contention that only 47 or 55 such movers exist would lose most of its sig nificance. That is why Aristotle in the second part of his argument (1074a 31-38) undertakes to prove what he had to prove, namely that there is not, and cannot be, more unmoved movers than the 47 or 55 responsible for the 47 or 55 eternal and independent movements going on in this one and unique heaven. For it is only by this supplementary demonstration that the conclusion 'this must be the number of (unmoved) entities' (1074a 21) is definitely established. Thus, far from revealing a heterogenous inspiration, the section 1074a 31-38 is actually the keystone of the whole argument.47 How did it occur to Aristotle that this argument (to the effect that the number of unmoved movers is no more than 47 or 55) would not appear convincing to an adversary who believed in a plurality of heavens? The answer is simply that this problem of a plurality of heavens, first raised by the philosophers of old, had in no way lost its significance in Aristotle's time. He himself discusses it (e.g. De c?elo I 8-9), always vigorously asserting that there is one heaven only. Plato had favored the same view (Tim. 30d; 31a; 92c) and had stigmatized the opinion that the number of heavens was a e as worthy of an a e person, reluctantly admitting, however, that to posit five heavens might not be un reasonable to the same degree (Tim. 55d). But another Platonist, Heraclides Ponticus, had taken the other side and had taught that every star was a world by itself, with its own earth and air (A?t. II 13,15: Doxogr. Gr. p. 343). Hence, it is obvious that belief in a plurality of heavens constituted a real and actual threat to Aristotle's position (according to which the number of unmoved movers was limited to 47 or 55) and that it was natural and even necessary for him to endeavor to safeguard it against this menace. Those critics who hold that the section 1074a 31-38 is a later addition, dis pose, it is true, of one more argument. (1074b 3) seems to refer to the heavenly bodies mentioned in 1074a 30, and this is supposed to prove that the 47 From the viewpoint of context, likewise the passage 1074a 31-38 connects smoothly and unobjectionably with what precedes: . . . a a e e a a a a . 6 e e a , a e .</page><page sequence="14">14 TRADITIO intervening section was subsequently inserted. But actually the section from 1074a 38 ( a a ? a ,. . .) to the end of the chapter forms an epilogue to ch. 8 in its entirety, and consequently the word ovtol does not refer to the heavenly bodies in so far only as they are mentioned in 1074a 30, but rather insofar as they have been discussed all through the chapter. When the concluding sentences of the chapter were read in class, the word ovtol may even have been clarified by a gesture pointing to the heavens above us. At any rate, these concluding sen tences (1074a 38 [7rapa&lt;5??orcu]-1074b 14) ought to be print?d as a separate paragraph. Thus, the organization of ch. 8 becomes quite clear. The basic problem dis cussed in it is : How many unmoved movers (and hence unmoved entities) are there? Can their precise number be determined (1073a 14-23)? The solution is: generally speaking, there are as many unmoved movers as there are inde pendent and eternal movements; for the same reasons that induce us to assume an unmoved mover for the First Heaven compel us to assume such a mover for every one of the other independent and eternal movements as well (1073a 23 b 3). But to be more specific: astronomy teaches us that there are 47 or 55 independent and eternal movements; hence, the number of unmoved movers also must at least be 47 or 55 (1073b 3-1074a 17). But neither can their num ber be greater since (a) the number of independent and eternal movements within our heaven is limited to 47 or 55 so that any additional mover would lack a spe cific function and would indeed by superfluous (1074a 17-31), and since (b) there is but this one heaven, and no other, in existence (1074a 31-38). Epilogue: indeed, the divinity of the heavenly bodies (spheres and stars) has, in some form or other, always been recognized; this recognition has, it is true, been somewhat obscured in traditional mythology, but forms its essential content and underly ing justification (1074a 38-b 14) .48 Thus, ch. 8 is logically and satisfactorily organized. It tea?hes one consistent doctrine, to the effect that there is but one heaven and that, within it, there are 47 (or 55) independent and eternal move ments caused by as many unmoved movers whose number is thus precisely limited and determined. The chapter does not reveal any trace of doubt, un certainty, inconsistency, self-contradiction,49 or self-correction.50 But if this is so, a new difficulty seems to arise. It has here been contended that, for Aristotle, there was no contradiction between ch. 8 and the rest of book A because Aristotle, with Plato's sphere of Ideal Numbers as a pattern of un moved entity in mind, could easily overlook the discrepancy between the 'mono theistic' (or rather 'monokinetic') and the 'polytheistic' (or rather 'polykinetic') 48 It is highly significant that this criticism of traditional mythology takes exception at its anthropomorphism, but not at all at its polytheism. Even St. Thomas ad loc. (2597 C?tala2) seems to be not quite sure of Aristotle's monotheism. 49 Apart, of course, from the well known error committed by Aristotle in reckoning the number of the spheres. 50 On the whole solution, cf. H. v. Arnim, 'Die Entstehung der Gotteslehre des Ari stoteles,' Sitzungsberichte der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien, Phil.-hist. Klasse 212 (1931) 72ff. Arnim's objections against an interpretation that would resemble the one given in this paper are hardly convincing.</page><page sequence="15">Aristotle's unmoved movers 15 features of his theology. But does it not become all the more difficult to re concile the spirit of ch. 8 with that of the chapters preceding it, the more clearly this spirit reveals itself as being unequivocally 'polytheistic'? As long as the section 1074a 31-38 could be regarded as essentially monotheistic?even though but as a survival of an earlier and more definitely monotheistic phase of Aris totle's thinking, or else as a later addition, qualifying and correcting the all too polytheistic views expressed in the rest of the chapter?it seemed at any rate to impart a certain monotheistic flavor to the entire chapter and thereby to assimilate it, to some extent, to the preceding ch.s 6-7. But if this interpreta tion has to be discarded and the inspiration of ch. 8 turns out to be purely 'poly theistic', consistently and without qualification, how may we henceforth hope to harmonize the spirit of ch. 8 with that of ch.s 6 and 7? As cited above, ch. 8 opens with these words: 'Let us now consider whether there is one such (eternal, unmoved, etc.) entity only or whether there are sev eral and (if so) how many?' Hence, the person?whether it was Aristotle himself or a later editor?who assigned these words to their present place can not possibly have felt that this question was incompatible with what preceded; in other words, he cannot have held that the problem referring to the number of unmoved movers had already been disposed of and definitely settled in the earlier parts of book A. Thus the question naturally suggests itself whether he may not have been correct in this view or, in other words, whether we ought not to interpret ch.s 6-7 in the light shed upon them by ch. 8 instead of doing the reverse? There are three entities, so we were told in ch. 1 of book A (1069a 30) : two of them sensible, one unmoved. The two sensible entities are discussed in the section from 1069b 3 to 1071b 2; at p. 1071b 3 the discussion of the third entity begins. Since movement is eternal, there must also be an eternal unmoved entity. (1071b 3-11). But it will not do to assume eternal entities like the Forms (Ideas), or possibly other eternal entities distinct from the Forms, insofar as such entities do not act (and hence cannot function as movers); nor even to posit entities capable of acting, but which do not act always and necessarily; for, the entity we are looking for must be a principle the essence of which is activity, not mere potentiality.51 'Furthermore, these entities must be without matter; for they must necessarily be eternal (if anything is). Hence, they (must be) actualities.'52 What, up to this point, is the object of Aristotle's quest? Entity, eternal 51 e ' a e a , e at a , a ' a , e a e e a a* e a a a a a .

And what is the entity that does not fulfill the conditions of this quest; that can not be the entity to be detected? Forms?because forms lack activity. What entities (plural!) are suggested in the place of forms (and/or mathematical objects, since these are obviously referred to by the words, 'or if there should be any other such entity apart from the forms', A 6, 1071b 16; cf. 1069a 34)?52a Entities (plural!), eternal, without matter, and therefore, ac tualities. It is obvious and has, indeed, hardly ever been overlooked that here already a plurality of movers is alluded to or is, at least, hinted at.53 From the very point at which Aristotle sets out to prove that an eternal and unmoved entity must exist, he conceives this entity as (at least possibly) comprising a plurality of (eternal and unmoved) entities. Indeed the question with which ch. 8 opens is here already foreshadowed. And here again these entities are com pared and even opposed to Plato's Forms (or Ideal Numbers), but Aristotle's criticism of these forms is directed not at their plurality but exclusively at their lack of activity. So far, there is no reason for expecting that the sphere of un moved Entity he is about to discover and to describe will comprise but one single entity. There follows (1071b 22-1072a 9) the proof that the actual is (in the sense here required) 'prior' to the merely potential. Consequently, the universe and, in particular, the unmoved Entity responsible for its movements, being essen tially actual, cannot ever have existed as a mere potentiality, but must have actually existed at all times. Aristotle then (1072a 9-17) goes on to show that actuality (hkpyeLo) must be twofold: one type of actuality responsible for the uniformity of change (ael a evepyovv), the other for change itself (evepyovv a a a ) ; the former acting in the same way at all times, the latter acting differently at different times. The meaning of this passage is obscure. Customarily, it is interpreted in the light of De gen. et corr. II 10, 356b 15, and its 'general upshot' is then supposed to be 'that the motion of the sphere of the fixed stars ... is the cause of the permanence in the history of the world while the ecliptic motion of the sun . . . causes the alternation of birth and death.'54 But whatever the passage 52a What is the a ^ a a a a ? The soul? Mathematical? On this problem, see Cherniss, op. cit. 391 . 311. To me, the plural oMas in 1071b 21 seems to prove that the latter are meant. 53 Such a plurality seems to be envisaged (at least as possible) also in 5, 1015b 14, and, particularly, in E 1, 1026a 16: Theology deals with a a a a and a a (plural !) and a a . . . a a tois &lt;?&gt;avepots e (heavenly bodies). In order to maintain his 'mono theistic' interpretation, Arnim (op. cit. 59) is compelled to declare the whole sentence from to 'Evkpyeiai apa (cf. n. 52) spurious. Cf. v. Arnim, 'Eudemische Ethik und Meta physik/ Sitzungsber. Akad. Wien, Phil.-hist. Kl. 207 (1928) 36; Jaeger, op. cit. 217; Cherniss, op. cit. 593-95. 54 Ross, op. cit. II 371. If this interpretation is correct, the passage would seem to imply that Aristotle recognized at least two different principles of motion: one responsible for the movement of the First Heaven, the other for the movement of the sun. It may be worth while to note that Plato's distinction between two types of motion (Tim. 36c)?one char acterized by Sameness and related to the motion of the outermost heaven, the other char acterized by Otherness and referred to the motion of the planets?forms a remarkable</page><page sequence="17">Aristotle's unmoved movers 17 may mean, the following (1072a 21) provides firm ground on which to take stand again. The existence of an eternal and unmoved Entity had previously been deduced from the eternity of movement, and this argument is now taken up again: It is, says Aristotle, the First Heaven which is eternal but moved; hence, there must exist something which is likewise eternal and moves it, but which is itself unmoved (1072a 24). Here then, the specification1 o? the unmoved movers and of the eternal move ments caused by them begins. The First Heaven, at any rate, is eternal and so is its movement; consequently, there must also exist something eternal that moves it, without moving itself. But Aristotle does not say that the First Heaven is the only eternal body eternally moved. Nor does he say or imply that it is not the only one. The question regarding the number of unmoved movers is neither raised nor prejudged. If raised at this point, the logical reply seems to be: 'We shall see. Should the movement of the First Heaven turn out to be the only (independent and) eternal movement, no further unmoved movers will have to be assumed; otherwise, such an assumption will be inevit able.' In other words, for the time being the unmoved mover of the First Heaven represents the unmoved Entity, but does not necessarily exhaust it. The next section (1072a 26-b 13) describes the manner in which eternal move ment is brought about. The mover is in the 'column' of intelligible objects; is a self-sufficient entity ( a) ; good and desirable; a final cause; exists of neces sity, etc. None of these predicates is inapplicable to more than one mover. It is only in the next section (1072b 13-30) that the mover is, for the first time, styled God and is described in terms which we find difficult to apply to a god among gods. But might not this difficulty be due, mainly, to the mono theistic tradition from which scholars of a later age have approached Aristotle, who as a matter of fact employs, in other passages, the same tones of* rapture in extolling 'Gods' which he here makes use of in exalting 'God'? Two illus trations may be given. 'Hence, the things there are of such a nature as not to occupy any place, nor does time age them; nor is there any change in any of them . . . they continue through their entire duration unaltered and unmodified, living the best and most self-sufficient of lives.'85 And again: 'We assume the gods to be above all other being, blessed and happy . . . Everyone supposes that they live and therefore that they are active . . . We cannot suppose them to sleep ... The activity of God which surpasses all others in blessedness must be contempla tive.'56 counterpart to Aristotle's words. Another explanation of the Aristotelian passage is to be found in v. Arnim, 'Die Entstehung . . 59-62; 'Eudemische Ethik . . 43-47. 55 De c?elo I 9, 279a 18 (Oxford translation, slightly modified). 56 Eth. Nie. X 8, 1178b 7 (Oxford translation). Here, where 'God' and 'gods' alternate, nothing indicates that Aristotle was less enthusiastic about the life of many than about the contemplative life of the one God.</page><page sequence="18">18 TRADITIO Why, then, ought we to assume that Aristotle, in describing and deifying the mover of the First Heaven, should have meant to deny (even by implication) the existence of any other movers? Having refuted (1072b 30-1073a 3) the view that the best and most beautiful is not a first principle, Aristotle (1073a 3-13) sums up ch.s 6-7. It has been proved, he says, that there exists an Entity?eternal, unmoved and separated from the sensible (entities or things). It has further been shown that this Entity cannot possess magnitude and is without parts, indivisible and free of change. Whatever Entity may mean in this context, whether a single being or a sphere of being, the words, 'there exists an Entity' can hardly mean, 'There exists only one such entity.' There must exist an entity besides the sensible entities? with these words ch. 6 opened and with them ch. 7 ends: it is this that has been proved. Nothing is said to indicate that the entity whose existence and nature has just been established (i.e. the mover of the First Heaven) must be necessarily unique in its kind.57 On the contrary, the summary which enumerates the prop erties characteristic of such an entity forms a perfectly natural transition to the discussion with which ch. 8 opens; it is as if Aristotle said: We know now what unmoved entity must be like and we know that there is at least one such entity ; now let us consider whether this is the only one or whether there are others as well. Indeed the summary, 1073a 3-13 is so indispensable an introduction to ch. 8 that it is difficult to see how the latter could be a later addition if the former is not.58 But does not all this only involve us in other and even greater difficulties and perplexities? If it is true that there is no monotheistic (or 'monokinetic') bias even in those sections which introduce the mover of the First Heaven, and 57 The words a ? a ??Laiperos (1073a 6) certainly do not imply this in any way. When someone contends that 'the soul' is essentially simple and indivisible he does not mean to imply that there is but one soul in existence. His meaning is that these properties may be predicated of any and every soul. And in the same way the contention that the 'unmoved entity' is without parts and indivisible is far from implying any assertion regarding the number of such entities (Prof. Gomperz' remark). 58 F. Blass?it may be worth noting?in 'Aristotelisches,' Rheinisches Museum 30 (1875) 481ff. esp. 486f. and 493, maintained, indeed, that the entire section 1073a 3-1074b 14 was a later addition, inserted by Aristotle himself, but originally forming part of another dis sertation. Thus, the in 1074b 3 had a definite reference in its original context whereas it now seems to float in the air. In addition, however, the inserted section was itself inter rupted by another insertion: 1073b 38-1074a 38 (the section correcting Eudoxus' figures). Blass based his theory on his observation of hiatus. There is no hiatus in 1073a 3-b 38 whereas they abound in 1073b 38-1074a 38, to disappear again in 1074a 38-b 14. Now, even according to this theory, the 'monotheistic' passage 1074a 31-38 would have formed part of the larger section 1073a 3-1074b 14 before this was incorporated with Metaph. A and consequently could not have been written for the purpose of criticizing the plurality of movers. But even if it could be proved that it is, after all, a later addition, it could only have been inserted for the purpose of supplementing and completing the proof that the num ber of unmoved movers cannot be greater than 47 or 55?a proof which otherwise would have remained incomplete.</page><page sequence="19">Aristotle's unmoved movers 19* that even the 'polykinetic' doctrine of ch. 8 is already foreshadowed in ch.s ? and 7; how can we account for that famous monotheistic trumpet-blast at the end of book , that celebrated els a ' Can we suppose that such a challenge shoots up all of a sudden, without any roots in what precedes? Now, the present writer makes bold to prove that quite independently of the foregoing discussion, and irrespective of whether the interpretations proposed are sound or wrong; irrespective even of all arguments for or against Aristotle's monotheism or polytheism?the e?s aolpavos can in no case have anything to do either with monotheism or with polytheism in the ordinary sense of these terms. This is what the following discussion will seek to make clear. In ch. 10 (1075a 25ff.) Aristotle criticizes his predecessors. This criticism is obviously not confined to the topics discussed in what immediately precedes (1075a 11-25) where it is contended that the Good is transcendent as well as immanent and that there is an order pervading the universe. The criticism is much more far-reaching and is to the following effect: (1) All philosophers have supposed that all things proceed from contraries. But that is unsatisfactory. Not all things proceed from contraries and there must be matter be sides (1075a 32; cf. Physics A 6, 189a 20-b 27; 7, 191a 4; Metaph. 2, 1004b 29; A 2, 1069b 2). (2) Nor is it permissible to identify matter with one of these contraries (1075a 32-34; cf. Physics A 4, 187a 18). (3) If all things proceeded from contraries, they would all participate in the Bad?with the exception of the One (which cannot, of course, itself proceed from contraries (1075a 34-36; cf. Phys. A 9, 192a 13). (4) Still less are those right who deny that the Good and the Bad are principles (1075a 36f.). (5) Some admit that the Good is a principle but do not make it clear in what way (i.e. as what kind of cause) it is a principle (1075a 38ff.). (6) Empedocles* view is likewise absurd. First, because he holds friendship (which for him is the Good) to be both a moving cause and a material element and both, essentially so; and secondly, he considers Strife (which for him is the Bad) to be eternal (1075b 1-7). (7) Anaxagoras, indeed, admits that the Good (Intelligence) is a principle as a moving cause; but according to him it acts for the sake of something else, different from itself (is not a final cause); furthermore, he does not recognize a principle opposed to the Good. (1075b 8-11). (8) Even those who recognize contraries as the principles do not make any proper use of them (1075b llf.). (9) Nor does anyone explain why some things are perishable, other imperishable; for, according to them all things proceed from identical principles (1075b 13f.; cf. 4,1000a 20). (10) Furthermore, some wrongly suppose that the Real arises from the Unreal (1075b 14f). (11) Others, in order to avoid this consequence, declare all things to be one, (1075b 15f.; cf. Phys. A 8,191a 23; Metaph. 4, 1001a 30). (12) Not one points out the cause of generation and of its perpetuity (1075b 16f.; cf. A 7, 988b 2; A 9, 991b 3). (13) Those who recognize two principles ought (consistently) to have recognized a third one as well, superior to both (1075b 17f.). (14) And this applies also to those who assume Forms (and perishable things), for (if there were no third principle) what could cause the participation of things in Forms? (1075b 18-21).</page><page sequence="20">20 TRADITIO (15) Whereas all other philosophers are compelled to assume something contrary to wis dom and the most precious form of knowledge, 'this is not necessary for us;' for the First89 there is no contrary since it is without matter (1075b 21-24). (16) Many deny the existence of suprasensibles altogether, but such a denial entails absurd consequences (1075b 24-27; cf. A 8, 988b 22; 5, 1010a 1). (17) Forms or Numbers60 are (it is true, suprasensible, but then they are) not causes, or at least not causes of movement (1075b 27 f.; De gener alione 9, 335b 7; Metaph. A 9, 991a 11; 991b 4; 991b 9; M 5, 1079b 12; 27; 1080a 2). (18) Besides, how could a magnitude or a continuum arise from unextended Number? (1075b 28-30; cf. A 8, 990a 13). (19) Contraries, presupposing matter and potentiality, cannot account for things eternal (1075b 30-34). (20) None is able to explain the union of form and matter 'if he does not agree with our contention that it is the moving cause that brings this about' (1075b 34-37). (21) Finally, those who (in their accounts of the spheres of Being) first mention mathe matical (not Ideal) Number and then go on to enumerate one entity (sphere of being) after another and posit different principles for each, have a conception of the universe (as if it were a bad play and) as consisting of unconnected scenes in which what precedes makes no difference to what follows; and introduce a multitude of (independent) principles (?px?s iroXK?s). But Reality does not care (to be like) a badly ruled city ( ? e a a ). 'Many rulers (independent of one another) are not a good thing; the (supreme) ruler ought to be one.' It was necessary to reproduce the entire series of Aristotle's criticisms since they form the background for the famous els KoLpavos ' ?a background having nothing whatsoever to do either with monotheism or polytheism. What are the main targets of Aristotle's criticism insofar as Platonic and post Platonic philosophy is concerned?61 First of all, the theory according to which all things may be reduced to (deduced from)62 (two) contrary principles one of which is supposed to be matter (criticisms 1, 2, 3, 13, 15, 19). Secondly, the theory according to which a sphere of Forms (and/or mathematical objects), existing apart from that of sensible things (criticism 17), ought tobe regarded as the universal cause (criticisms 12,14, 20) or at least as the 'first' entity (criticism 21). What is Aristotle's own view? First, that there are only two spheres of Being, the Sensible (subdivided into the Perishable and the Eternal) and the Unmoved. Secondly, that in the Sphere of the Sensible, individuals have no common principles whatsoever. Matter, Form, Privation, Potentiality, and Actuality may be styled common principles per analogiam only. For in truth it is always the concrete sensible thing that acts (insofar as it is form or actuality) or is acted upon (as far as it is matter or potentiality).63 The only common principle, 59 applies equally well to one mover and to several; the point is merely that the First cannot arise from contraries. 60 Ei ' ' a a (or explicativum) a mss. omnes. 61 Criticisms 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 16, 18 refer partly to non-Platonic views, partly to Platonic (not just Plato's) doctrines having but little to do with the present investigation. 62 On this a a see e.g. Metaph. 2, 1004b 33; 2, 1061a 10. 63 Metaph. 4, 1070a 31; 1070b 9-22; 26-30; 5, 1071a 3-11; 19-24 (principles common per analogiam). The further case of common principles (what is principle of an a is also principle of its accidents): 5, 1070b 36-1071a 3; 1071a 34.</page><page sequence="21">Aristotle's unmoved movers 21 here, is the unmoved entity, the first moving cause.64 But this entity cannot be deduced from any higher principles since it is pure actuality.65 What is the historical background of Aristotle's position and of his attitude toward Platonism, in this respect? Book A begins with the words: 'It is Entity that has to be considered since the principles and causes to be determined are principles and causes of entities.'66 It has been pointed out, in the first part of this paper, that Aristotle's views concerning the number and the character of entities were conditioned by certain Platonic doctrines. The same must now be shown with respect to his teachings regarding the principles and causes of entities. This brings us back to Metaph. A: the specific objects of wisdom are the first principles and causes.67 As Aristotle saw it, this had been Plato's solution of the problem: In the first place, Plato had assumed three entities: the Sensible, the Mathematical, and the Forms, and indeed he and the Pythagoreans who had preceded him had been the first to recognize a suprasensible entity essentially distinct from all sensible objects.68 In the second place, he had represented the Forms as the causes of all other objects.69 And in the third place he has deduced the forms themselves from two ultimate elements or principles:70 the One and the Great-and-Small. At the same time, the One, in Plato's system, had played the role of form (in the Aristotelian sense of this term) and of the Good; the Great-and-Small that of matter and of the Bad. Consequently, according to Plato these two prin ciples (the One and the Great-and-Small) were the principles of all existence and, in particular, of things eternal as well as of things perishable.71 Plato's theories (and those of his disciples) concerning the principles (causes, elements) are criticized ex professo in the last two books of the Metaphysics (M 9, 1086a 18-N 6, 1093b 22). But only a few of the arguments there ad vanced are relevant to the purpose of this paper.72 64 Metaph. A 4, 1070b 34f.; 5, 1071a 36. 65 Metaph. A 10, 1075b 22; 2, 1088b 14-28. 66 Cf.

But this supposition is untenable: contraries presuppose matter as a substratum common to both and cannot exist by them selves.74 It is also inadmissible to identify one of those contraries (Inequality, Multi tude, the Great-and-Small, the Many-and-Few, the Exceeding-and-Exceeded, the Different, the Other) with matter.75 But it is inadmissible to assume that (the other contrary, namely) the One, is a principle (of all and any things in one and the same sense) ; in truth the One is only a measure and, consequently, in each category of things it stands for something different.76 Furthermore, the Eternal cannot possibly consist of elements. If it did, there would have to be some matter underlying it and then it could not be entirely free of all potentiality. But where there is potentiality there is always at least the possibility of corruption and destruction. Even number, be it ever so enduring, could not really be eternal (in the strict sense of the term, that is necessarily enduring forever), if it consisted of elements.77 Those who introduced the aforesaid contraries (viz. the One and the Great and-Small, the latter also styled the Indefinite Dyad, etc.) as causes (principles, elements) did so, feeling (wrongly) that there was no other way of escaping the consequence that 'all things are one\78 They held that only by opposing its contrary to the One and representing it as the Cause of Non-being, would they succeed in safeguarding the plurality of things.79 But in truth the contention that 'all things are one' is senseless anyway since the word 'to be' has a different meaning in each case according to the category (an entity 'is' and a quality likewise 'is\ but in an entirely different sense).79a The thinkers who introduced Ideal Numbers (i.e. Plato) contended, at least, that these numbers were the causes of all other things. But the philosopher who (denies Ideal Numbers and) posits the Mathematical Number only (viz. Speusippus) does not even maintain that mathematical numbers are causes.80 The only argument which he has to offer (in favor of recognizing mathematical numbers as a separate sphere of being) is that if there were no mathematical entity, the mathematical sciences would disappear.81 Actually, he maintains issue whether the principles (elements, causes) of the forms are concrete or general. For the relation between and cf. Jaeger, op. cit. 223ff. 73 Why just these two are named will be seen below. 74 Metaph. 1, 1087a 29-b 4 (cf. supra p. 19, criticism 1). 75 Metaph 1, 1087b 4-33 (cf. criticism 2). 76 Metaph. 1, 1087b 33-1088a 8. 77 Metaph. 2, 1088b 14-28 (cf. criticism 19). 78 Cf. criticisms 10 and 11, and Phys.

(For instance) even if mathematical numbers did not exist, (the next sphere of being, viz.) spatial magnitudes, might exist never theless; and even if the latter did not exist, (the next sphere after these, namely) souls, and bodies perceptible by the senses, might yet exist. But according to all appearances, nature is not like a bad tragedy, consisting of incoherent scenes.82 Those, again, who make a distinction between the ideal and the mathematical numbers do not and cannot answer the question of what elements (principles, causes) the mathematical numbers may consist.83 If they are the One and the Great-and-Small, then the mathematical will not differ from the ideal numbers, since according to Plato it is just the ideal number that consists of the One and the indefinite Dyad (the Great-and-Small). It may be contended that the Great-and-Small serving as the matrix of the mathematical numbers is not identical with that from which the ideal numbers are generated (and indeed such a distinction is implied in the description of the magnitudes);84 but this would imply a multiplication of the fundamental elements. It may be con tended, furthermore, that the One in the Realm of ideal numbers differs from the One in the realm of mathematical numbers ; but this likewise would imply a multiplication of the fundamental principles.85 So much for Aristotle's criticisms. They might be summarized as follows: According to Plato, (1) there are three spheres of Being: Forms, mathematical objects and sensible things; (2) Forms are the causes of all other things; (3) two contraries function as the elements (causes, principles) of the Forms, and, conse quently, of all other things, sensible and unmoved, as well.86 But these assump tions are untenable. According to Speusippus, on the other hand, there are more spheres of Being than three, the first of these comprising the mathematical objects. But all those spheres are not essentially related to one another (not one of them, e.g., causes any other one); each sphere has its own specific principles (elements, causes) wherefrom an indefinite plurality of elements (principles, causes) results; actually, in each sphere there are two specific contraries functioning as the funda mental elements (so that the number of fundamental elements is twice that of the spheres). But these contentions are likewise inadmissible. Neither spheres nor principles, all of them entirely independent of each other, can claim to be satisfactory accounts of reality. Now, let us face the following question: Is Speusippus' view polytheistic? For only if it is and only as far as it is, is it legitimate to style the view expressed 82 Metaph. 3, 1090b 16-20 (cf. supra, criticism 21). A comparison of this passage with 2,1028b 21 and 10,1076a 1 makes it clear that it is Speusippus who is assailed in the three passages. On Speusippus' spheres of being see Frank, op. cit.

In truth the words, ?yad?v a , els Ko?pavos ' mean just this and nothing more: 'It is wrong to assume a number of incoherent spheres of Being; these spheres depend on one another. And it is wrong to assume that every sphere has its own specific prin ciples only; in fact, the unmoved sphere is the principle of, i.e. causes, the sens ible sphere.' But if it be assumed that these same words refer as well to the entire series of criticisms by which they are preceded, and of which the criticism of Plato's theory is the most significant, then this further meaning may be as signed to them: 'It is wrong to assume that there are two contrary principles (elements) viz. the One and the Great-and-Small, which, being the principles of the Forms = Numbers, would also be the principles of all things;87 because the unmoved entity, being immaterial, is not produced by, or dependent on, con trary principles (elements),88 but is itself the only principle on which all other things depend.' The main results of this study may now be recapitulated as follows: (1) The belief in a plurality of unmoved movers voiced in Metaph. A 8 is not in contradiction with the doctrine propounded in the rest of this book?regard less of the question as to when and by whom ch. 8 may have been composed or inserted. This chapter is neither less nor more monotheistic than the rest of the book, and this is true of the concluding clause of ch. 10 no less than of any other passage. (2) Nor is the belief in a plurality of immaterial movers incompatible with any other doctrines essential to the Aristotelian system and, in particular, with the assumption that matter is the principle of individuation. Every one of the immaterial movers forms a species by itself (like Plato's ideal numbers, or St. Thomas' angels) and the movers are not individuals of a common species or genus 'unmoved mover' since they constitute a series the terms of which stand to one another in the relationship of 'prior and posterior'. (3) The section 1074a 31-38 does not express any criticism of the belief in a plurality of immaterial movers. On the contrary, it proposes to prove that there cannot be unmoved movers beyond those 47 (55) movers responsible for the movements of the heavenly bodies known to us, because there cannot be another system of such movers apart from the one just referred to, which consists of those 47 (55) movers. Far from being foreign to the body of the chapter, the section forms an essential part of its argument. (4) In Aristotle's system the Unmoved Movers held a position closely analo gous to that held, in Plato's philosophy, by the Ideal Numbers, and thus it was natural that the latter should function, as it were, as pattern for Aristotle's conception of the former. (5) Aristotle's 'theology' is closely connected with Platonic and post-Platonic doctrines implying divisions of Being and principles of those divisions. But has not Met.

That may be so; but perhaps this same interpretation might no less justly be considered as a return to the view of scholars who did not yet feel the need of supporting and fortifying their own monotheistic tenets by tracing them back to Aristotle's Metaphysics. This is what Duhem tells us about the first reaction of the Middle Ages to this work: 'Au XlIIe si?cle les premiers lecteurs de la M?taphysique ont fort bien senti que la doctrine de ce livre ?tait en formelle contradiction avec le monoth?isme chr?tien; ils on fort bien vu que les .. . moteurs immobiles . . . ?taient autant de dieux.'89 And even of St. Thomas' reaction he says: 'St. Thomas a donc vu que la th?orie des moteurs c?lestes propos?e par Aristote conduisait au polyth?isme.'90 Perhaps these statements are even a little too sweeping. There is an element of 'subordinationism' in the doctrine of the unmoved movers that might well encourage a mono theistic interpretation.908, God would then either be identified with the mover of the First Heaven or even the latter might be subordinated to Him. In either case he might be conceived as having created the rest of the movers.91 One thing, however, appears to be certain: when Aristotle composed Metaph. A he was very much interested in demonstrating the actual existence of a divine entity, but much less interested in proving this entity to be numerically and individually one.92 After all, even the only passage in Aristotle's writings93 89 Duhem, op. cit. V 355. Albert the Great and Henry of Ghent, at any rate, saw Aris totle's polytheism clearly; see S. Talamo, L'aristotelismo della scolastica (3rd ed. Siena 1881) 162fL; cf. Ph. Boehner, 'Der Aristotelismus im Mittelalter/ Franziskanische Studien 22 (1935) 338-347, esp. 340 n. 4. Ps. Duns Scotus, in his commentary in Metaph. (loc. cit.), says: 'Philosophus videtur aperte consentire opinioni, quae dicebat omnes substantias immateriales esse Deos . . .' For St. Thomas see . 48 supra. 90 Duhem, op. cit. V 548. 90a Cf. De gen. et. corr. II 10, 337a 20-22. 91 Cf. E. Renan, Averroes et VAverroisme (4th ed. Paris 1882) 118. 92 And in this respect his position seems but to reflect the general attitude of the Greek mind. I am indebted to Prof. Gomperz for the following quotation from E. Meyer, Ge schichte des Altertums II (Stuttgart 1893) 769: 'In Griechenland spielt die Frage bez?glich eines oder mehrerer G?tter kaum irgend eine Rolle. Ob die g?ttliche Macht als eine Einheit oder Mehrheit gedacht wird, ist belanglos im Vergleiche zu der Frage, ob sie ?berhaupt existiert und wie ihre Natur und Beziehung zur Welt verstanden werden muss.' Exceptions are, of course, always possible. One of them is represented by Philodemus, who (De pietate 17-19, pp. 84-86 Gomp.) maintains that monotheism is godless and only the polytheistic view really pious. Much later Celsus (Orig. c. Celsum VIII 11; 25) will assail the godless ness of the Jewish monotheism. It has been said by W. Jaeger ('Greeks and Jews,' The Journal of Religion 18 [1938] 127-143) that Hecataeus of Abdera, the first Greek author to mention the Jews, must have been attracted by their monotheism; and that Theophrastus must have appreciated the Jews as a philosophic nation because of their monotheism. But even if we do not assume with J. Bidez and F. Cumont, Les mages hell?nis?s (Paris 1938) 240-242, that Hecataeus, indebted to Democritus or Leucippus, was entirely an esprit libre, we must allow the possibility that he was, perhaps, more shocked than attracted by Jewish monotheism. For the Mosaic a a and e way of living (FGrHist. 1 F 6) he has but little sympathy. 93 Phys. 6, 259a 6-20.</page><page sequence="26">26 TRADITIO in which he explicitly raises the question whether there is only one unmoved mover, and answers it in the affirmative, will, on closer inspection, prove rather disappointing to the advocates of Aristotelian 'monotheism'. For this passage of the Physics forms part of a chapter the essential doctrine of which was aptly expressed by Eudemus94 when he said that corresponding to every eternal and continuous movement there must be a mover, unmoved incidentally as well as essentially. No statement can be found to the effect that only one such move ment is possible (on the contrary, in the passage 259b 28-32 a plurality of move ments seems to loom). What Aristotle does say is that one and the same move ment cannot be due to the activity of more than one mover95 since a plurality of movers would render the movement discontinuous; and even this contention refers only to the case of several movers contributing to the production of one and the same movement by successive activities, whereas the case of a plurality of movers simultaneously contributing to the production of one movement is not even considered.96 All that has hardly to do anything with 'monotheism'. It is true that Jaeger?to whom we are indebted for pointing out Eudemus' interpretation?himself interprets Phys. 6 in a different way. According to him97 the theory originally propounded in this chapter was the following: There is, indeed, only one unmoved mover who is eternal and causes an eternal and continuous movement; and there are many unmoved movers (souls) that are perishable and cause discontinuous movements of a passing nature. The eternal mover is unmoved in the sense of being never moved either primarily or inci dentally,98 whereas the perishable movers may be moved incidentally and hence are unmoved only insofar as they are never moved primarily or, as it were, 'in their own right'. The argument offered in support of the contention that there is only one eternal mover was to the effect that movement caused by a plurality of movers would needs be discontinuous and hence could not be eternal. But, according to Jaeger, it subsequently occurred to Aristotle that this argument would not hold if there were a number of co-eternal and continuous movements (such a plurality of co-eternal movements was assumed by newer astronomical theories)?caused by an equal number of unmoved and eternal movers. In order to adapt the chapter to this new viewpoint Aristotle added two clauses ?not, however, because he intended to refute the possibility of co-eternal move 94 Fr. 80 Mullach (p. 105, 5 Spengel) : e a , e ae . . . e a e e , e a , ( a ' e a ", cos , a e a a a 1 a a a a ?e? . . . 95 a in passages like 259a 19 obviously means a a a (one and the same), not 'the only one'.

Guthrie, 'The Development' ( . 8 supra) p. 91 n.: 'In so far as the possibility of more than one unmoved mover has occurred to Aristotle [seil, in Phys. 6], it has presented itself in the form of a succession of movers, not a coexistent plurality like that described in Metaph. A. The argument for unity which is based on the continuity of motion could only be valid against the conception of a series of movers succeeding one another in time. .</page><page sequence="27">Aristotle's unmoved movers 27 ments, but, on the contrary, because he admitted it. These two clauses read: 'whether one or several' (258b 11), and: (the prime mover) 'if it be one, or the prime movers, if more than one' (259a 7f.). But, according to Jaeger, a new difficulty arose. Aristotle had contended that the perishable movers (souls) were moved incidentally (though not primarily) ; but what about the movers of the heavenly spheres the existence of which he had now admitted? For some reason or other it seemed to Aristotle that these, too, would be moved incident ally?in the same way in which the souls of living beings are moved together with their bodies (even when this movement is caused by the souls themselves). But Aristotle felt that, in this respect likewise, there ought to be a difference between the movers of the spheres and the souls of living beings. And for the purpose of working out such a difference Aristotle introduced a distinction be tween two ways in which unmoved movers may be moved incidentally: souls are moved incidentally insofar as they are carried by the animal bodies over whose movements they preside ; the celestial movers are moved incidentally in sofar as the spheres moved by them are also moved by other movers (viz. in the case in which a plurality of eternal movements is imparted to one and the same heavenly body). And this new consideration was expressed by another addi tion, namely by the clause 259b 28-32. By these two series of additions the chapter was now adapted to the new view which admitted a plurality of unmoved and eternal movers. One thing, how ever, remained unsaid: Aristotle had not yet explicitly declared that every eter nal movement presupposed a separate eternal mover and it was left to Eudemus to say so in so many words: he interpreted as if Aristotle had written: every separate eternal movement must be accounted for by assuming a separate eter nal mover. And Eudemus' 'polytheistic' interpretation was entirely legitimate: it simply represented Aristotle's final views. This is Jaeger's analysis of Physics 6." Being very complex, it might per haps be impugned in some respects. But let us suppose that it is correct in every detail. What follows? If Aristotle could feel?as he must have felt 99 For the sake of convenience I shall quote the decisive passages of that chapter, in cluding between double brackets the words that are, according to Jaeger, a later insertion: 'Eirei e e ae e a . . . a a- e a a e , [[e?re tv e e e ]], a a . . . e a , a a e a , [[e e e e e , e a a a. e e a a . . .]] a e a e , a a ?v e a a aXXots e . . . a e e a e e a a^ e a ?v a a . e e a y?p a a- ae e a , e e ae , a a e e a ? a y?p ae e , ' e e e , a a etye e , a- a ', * e e a e ? e y?p a a a e , e , a ' e e . . .

Furthermore, this chapter is (or originally was) 'monokinetic' insofar only as it also assumes (or originally assumed) but one eternal movement. By this assumption, however, Aristotle did not mean to deny the possibility of more than one eternal and continuous movement, but he simply did not consider such a possibility and the problem of co-eternal move ments altogether. Consequently, whether we endorse Jaeger's analysis to a greater or lesser extent, there is nothing even in Physics 6 to contradict the re sult of our investigation, which is to the effect that the doctrine laid down in Metaph. A is consistently polykinetic (or 'polytheistic') rather than inconsistently monokinetic (or 'monotheistic')?although certainly not anthropomorphic. Generally, it is true, we are inclined to think of the transition from polytheism to monotheism as being at the same time a transition from crude anthropomor phism to a purer notion of God. A middle stage, a de-anthropomorphisized polytheism, appears as a logical construction rather than a living reality. But it seems that Aristotle (and, perhaps, Plato, too101) represents just this inter mediary stage. It was the anthropomorphism or anthropopathism of the popu lar religion by which they were repelled, not its plurality of gods.102 And it is quite correct when Epicurus, in his polemic against its 'impious' adversaries, insists on both: on the plurality of gods and on their anthropomorphism, be cause the two issues are different. Aristotle's unmoved movers are gods cer tainly not resembling men; but still they are many.103 100 To the writer it has been a profound satisfaction to find that his evaluation of Aris totle's alleged monotheism, though based exclusively on philological considerations, is in complete agreement with the view expressed by ?. Gilson, L'esprit de la philosophie m?di?vale I (Paris 1932), esp. pp. 48f. 53, 226 n. 6, and 230 n. 13. Gilson- shows convincingly that it would be idle to look for explicit monotheism in Aristotle and that his theology represents, at best, a semi-conscious step in the direction of this doctrine. M. de Corte, 'La d?finition aristot?licienne de Y ?me,' Revue thomiste 1939, pp. 460-508, advocates a solution more or less like that propounded by Zeller: movers are souls and, hence, differ necessarily from the first mover who is not a soul. Is this not an interpretation presupposing rather than proving Aristotle's monotheism? 101 On Plato's monotheism see Ross, Arist. Physics lOOf.; F. M. Cornford, 'The "Poly theism" of Plato,' Mind 47 (1938) 321-330; A. E. Taylor, 'The "Polytheism" of Plato/ ibid. 180-199; Solmsen, op. cit. ( . 22) 70. 102 It is worth noting that R. K. Hack, God in Greek Philosophy to the Time of Plato (Princeton 1931), esp. p. 149, also arrived at the concept of an un-anthropomorphic poly theism. 103 Two attempts at linking Aristotle's political to his theological theories should be mentioned: Erik Peterson, Der Monotheismus als politisches Problem (Leipzig 1935) 14f.; Hans Kelsen, 'The Philosophy of Aristotle and the Hellenic-Macedonian Policy/ Interna tional Journal of Ethics 47 (1937) 1-64.</page><page sequence="29">Aristotle's unmoved movers 29 Additional Note It is well worth while to read the opening section of Theophrastus' Metaphysics (I 1 II 7; pp. 3-6 Ross and Fobes) which discusses all the problems referrirg to the number and characteristics of the spheres of Being; their concatenation; the number of Entities in the highest sphere; the first mover; the number of eternal movements; and the difficulties connected with the assumption of one unmoved mover not less than with the assumption of many unmoved movers.

A 10, 1076a 1), whose universe consists of spheres of being, mutually not contributing to one another, is true; or else a view like that of Plato (Arist. Metaph. 3, 1090a 2-4), who at least asserted that Forms are 'causes' of all other things; or like that of Aristotle, who proved that the Suprasensible, being the cause of the movement of the Sensible, is in 'contact' with it. Theoprastus is for the latter views. Et ' , tls a (seil, ) a e ', This is Aristotle's question whether there is only one or else several kinds of supra sensible a , and of wiiatkind they are (Arist.

Et ' e a a e a a e e , a e a e t?yeiv, e a Tis, a ' a a ' e a a ykvos. Here Theophrastus discusses the possibility that there could be another (non-mathe matical) suprasensible entity and connects with this the question whether this higher entity is one or many, i.e. he asks exactly the same question as Aristotle in A 8. Thus, it becomes absolutely clear that to say 'there is but one suprasensible a = sphere of being' does not prejudice the number of a ? entities within this sphere of being. Only, Theophrastus does not exclude the possibility that the suprasensible entity could stand to its entities in the relation of their genus or species. t \oy epov ' a e a e oKiyois e a a e , e apa a a e . Thus, Theophrastus favors 'oligo-polytheism' or 'mono-polytheism' in a manner re sembling Arist. Phys. .
