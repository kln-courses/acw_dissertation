<plain_text><page sequence="1">Function versus Purpose By J. CARL BASS Kansas State College Pittsburg, Kansas T HE TERMS "purpose" and "function" are regularly misused and, more significantly, the concepts inherent in their meanings are often confused. If just the terms were confused, and not the concepts, the matter could be settled by a word-study and by definition. Consider the following definitions: Purpose is defined as- the object or intention for which a thing exists or for which an action is executed. Teleology is defined as a belief that natural phenomena are determined not only by mechanical causes but by an over-all design or purpose in nature; opposed to mechanism. Anthropomorphism is defined as the assignment of human-like characteristics to sub- human organisms and to inanimate objects. Function is defined as the normal, natural action (s) of a part or whole of an organism, or component of the universe. Obviously, in many instances the use of the terms "function" and "purpose" overlaps. For example, a landscape artist may design (purpose), out of his imaginative and esthetic mind (function of his brain at the cognitive level), that a concrete walkway shall be placed along a certain route and that it should have a certain curvature. As this is the product of man's mind (designing in this instance), purpose may be readily assigned. Since the walkway may serve to keep one's feet out of the mud and to lend some esthetic quality to the landscape, then function is present. However, one should not confuse the two distinct points of view. Function bears a strictly mechanical, utilitarian denotation. A given item (such as a muscle-fiber or gland-cell) reacts, in response to a stimulus, within the limitations of its structure and available energy. That is to say, the structures function within the character- istic limitations of inherent capacities and those established by the environment. In the case of the concrete walkway, it being a product of the mind and a result of constructive labor, it is per- missible to refer to the purpose of the walk (in proper context) or</page><page sequence="2">BIOS 27 to the function of the walk (again in proper context). In the case of muscle-fibers or of gland-cells, since these cannot be shown to be the products of mind or of constructive labor, one must use the term "function." Who designed and who built the muscle-fibers of a modern animal? Who designed and who built gland-cells, spores of ferns, the vascular-cells of an elm tree, or the mammalian heart? Unfortunately, too many teachers and writers promote the thesis of purpose in circumstances in which it is not warranted. Children's books and stories are often written with inanimate and sub-human objects talking and "thinking" as in the story of LITTLE BLACK SAMBO. The assignment of thought and speech to animals and objects not shown by evidence to be capable of such acts results in an erroneous concept of "purpose." Examples of teleology in other- wise effective writing may be found in many of our college biology textbooks: "Hydra is sensitive to light and seeks out a suitable illumina- tion." (Elliott and Ray, 1960) "In evolving to become adapted to terrestrial life, animals, like plants, had certain problems to solve for survival in the absence of a surrounding watery medium." (Villee, 1962) "When the magnet was placed directly over the animal, pulling the iron filing against the hair cells on the top of its equilibrium organ, the crayfish thought that "up" was "down" and responded by turning over and swimming on its back." (Villee, 1962) "The female reproductive system with its accessories is con- structed according to the following plan." (Core, Strausbaugh and Weimer, 1961) "The term symbiosis refers to the intimate interrelationships between two organisms of different species for the purpose of deriv- ing energy or for some other benefit." (Hickman, 1961) "As the animals of the surface plankton die, they sink to deeper layers of the ocean to serve as food for animals at lower levels." (Hickman, 1961) "Paramecium bursaria harbors a green alga (Zoochlorellae) which manufactures carbohydrates (by photosynthesis) for the benefit of the paramecium and receives a safe shelter in return." (Hickman, 1961) "Molariform teeth are for crushing and grinding, and hence have flattened, often broadly occlusal surfaces; . . . (Lagler, Bardach and Miller, 1962) The above quotations were taken from books selected at random; in no instance was more than one page examined before the quotes were found. More acceptable expressions might be: "Hydra, being sensitive to light, may locomote and upon en- countering a suitable illumination take up a position." "In evolving toward adaptation to terrestrial life, animals, like plants, survived without a surrounding watery medium despite critical factors of the environment." "When the magnet was placed directly over the animal, pulling the iron filing against the hair-cells on the dorsal side of its</page><page sequence="3">28 Bios equilibrium organ, the crayfish responded to this stimulus by turn- ing over and swimming on its back." "The female reproductive system with its accessories may be described as follows: ". "The term symbiosis refers to the intimate interrelationships be- tween members of two different species in which members of one or of both species may benefit from the relationship." "As the animals of the surface plankton die, they sink to deeper layers of the water where they may be utilized as food by other animals at lower levels." "Paramecium bursaria incorporates a green alga (Zoochlorellae) within its pellicle. These algae may photosynthesize carbohydrates on which both the organisms may depend as an energy-source." "Molariform teeth, which have flattened, often broadly occlusal surfaces, function well in crushing and grinding." In countering the argument that the worth of man lies in his purpose, it can be contended that the worth of man lies in his pro- ductivity and in his civil and cultural relationships with others, rather than in an inherent purpose (as if it were purposed that men are worthy). The purposeful designs which might be produced by the individual's mental activity may well have great worth by a common definition, however. Such a line of thinking will lead one to the problem of the origins of living things and living material (protoplasm). To avoid a discourse on organic evolution, let it suffice to recognize the tre- mendous body of knowledge supporting the proposition that evolu- tion did occur and is occurring. Geological, anthropological and archaeological records alone yield data which are difficult to ignore. Yet one regularly encounters an insistence that the worth of man lies in his "purpose," in his having been created with built-in pur- poses and purpose for each component. How can any organism, man or other, have been designed and built molecule by molecule and cell by cell? The capacity of man to recognize his potential, to establish goals and to seek the satisfaction of attaining those goals is pertinent to this consideration. The mind of man can project goals, and, indeed, most of us do attempt to attain established goals. The pertinent fact is that evidence is not available that man or any other organism has been established as an immutable being with individual and collec- tive goals or purposes. If one were to extend this premise, one might propose that no organ, tissue, or cell of any organism has been planned, designed or purposed; indeed, has not been provided a built-in purpose. One could project such a premise to any com- ponent of the universe. The expression, "Everything has a purpose," is a bland cover for our inability to better understand and explain phenomena, much as is the palliative, "It's part of the plan," or "It's nature's way of . . et cetera.</page><page sequence="4">Bios 29 Without evidence, one cannot prove that "purpose" or "the plan" does not exist. However, from a scientific point of view, there is no evidence that purpose does exist in nature except as a peculiar function of mind. Against such a seeming impasse it may be con- tended that the scientific-the pragmatic and experimental-ap- proach to problem-solving does function, while superstition or other so-called revelatory approaches to knowledge collapse progressively and slowly as they are attacked. The demand for all available data and the scientific analysis of data pertinent to a problem has resulted in solutions which had remained unattainable otherwise. There is surely a name for such a point of view as is presented here. Whatever tag may be applied (whether mechanistic or other), the view probably does warrant the label of pragmatism, in that it has been shown to work. Labels are likely to be misleading or insignificant except when they are used with precision as a medium of communication. Most thinking persons probably face the question of function versus purpose at some time, perhaps regularly. To reach a con- clusion regarding the proposition is of no small significance, since to do so would seem to indirectly establish one in one camp or another. Indeed, in this instance there would appear to be an inconsistency in attempting to embrace the "purpose camp" and the "function camp" simultaneously. Does a protozoan seek out a termite for "purposes" of finding an appropriate environment? Does a termite seek out a protozoan for the "purpose" of establishing a mutually beneficial symbiotic rela- tionship? Is there a master-control system and a master plan with a master planner which directs such relationships? Alternatively, does the genetic mechanism of such organisms, through enzyme- stimuli, dispose them toward patterns of activity and response? Can one ignore the factor of chance of survival, or the statistical probability that a given fish will not reach reproductive maturity from its spawning date? To understand the universe-physical and living-one should first find answers to such questions for himself. One must recognize that there is a great comfort in embracing the proposition that a master plan and a master planner exist; that in that plan there is care, motivation, direction, and perhaps some form of salvation. We are concerned with only one fraction of this list; that is, motivation. Wan and wistful beliefs in fantasy result in assignment of pur- poseful activity to non-thinking organisms; evidence does not. The assignment of purposeful activity to parts (cells, tissues, organs) of an organism or to an organism is teleology. Despite the fact that many working scientists, as well as far too many non-scientists, express themselves teleologically, most scientists give lip-service to a non-teleological attitude. To be magnanimous, one might suggest</page><page sequence="5">30 Bios that most teleology results from a lapse of concentration on one's manner of expression; to be less magnanimous, teleology results from carelessness or intent. This is not to agree that teleology is acceptable in any form. The assignment of human characteristics such as thought and self-motivation to non-human organisms or non-organisms (anthro- pomorphism) is no more admissible in a systematic philosophy than is teleology. From a viewpoint of pure appreciation of organisms, it is degrading to insist that those organisms require some super- spirit, super-being, guiding self, Pan, sentient god, or whatever, to direct activity and response.
