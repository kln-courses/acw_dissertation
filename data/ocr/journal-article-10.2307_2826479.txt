The dinosaurs have thrived in the public eye for a hundred and fifty years. Among the scientific community they have recently stimulated thought and controversy about their physiology and ways of life. Our own ancestors, the mammal-like rep- tiles or Synapsida, have rested in the shadow of their more spectacular cousins. Now John McLoughlin has attempted to strip their obscurity and bring them into their own. His Synapsida is not a scientific treatise but a down-to-earth, some- what anthropomorphic, look at the creatures of the late Paleozoic and Mesozoic from which the mammals qradually took form. It consists of a generally simple, readable, and voluminously il- lustrated text. Everyone has stereotyped notions of what the dinosaurs looked like in the flesh, although recent artists have portrayed them as more active than the older stereotypes would suggest. No matter what is done to flesh out the bones of the synap- sids, with their large heads, heavy bodies and squat gaits, they do not look reasonable to our un- tutored eyes unless great liberties are taken in put- ting on muscles and skin, so as to make them look either like well-known reptiles or else like mam- mals. McLoughlin has avoided this trap and his drawings hew generally to the skeletal configura- tions, although they are stylized and in some cases rather crude. His account shows a thorough familiarity with the literature and with changing ideas on the na- ture of mammal-like reptiles and their role in the origin of mammals. Some of the things he says</page><page sequence="2">SEPTEMBER 1981] NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 325 would have been revolutionary thirty years ago, but are passed off now as known; sometimes he steps somewhat beyond the bounds of the known and into the speculative without drawing a clear- cut line between the two areas. This is especially true in the difficult areas of physiology and phy- logeny where much less than the information nec- essary for sound conclusions is available. Whether or not one likes his flip and sometimes "cute" style is a matter of personal taste, but back of it is a solid and informative narrative. The book begins, after an introduction, with a short study of the source of vertebrates as a whole. It rapidly progresses to a consideration of pelyc- osaurs and primitive therapsids, the early synap- sids, and then to the more advanced therapsids and the beginnings of mammals. In these sections the significance of diet and dietary changes form a central theme of the evolutionary sequences. A short section on the Mesozoic associates of the synapsids follows. The history is set in the pangeic world of the Permo-Triassic. The chapter entitled "The Making of Mam- mals" is a generally good analysis of the reptiles- to-mammals transition, the problems at inter- grade zones are well handled. Emphasis shifts from diet to what the author terms the "inner space," referring to the inner world created by the increasingly large and complex brain of the mam- mals. Dealing with this and with some of the mor- phological aspects requires a somewhat more technical approach than do other parts of the book, but these matters are crucial to the story. This section is somewhat marred, in my view, by such "cute" phrases as "mammals are dinosaurized therapsids." All in all, however, it is well done and extrapolations beyond the data are usually prop- erly qualified. There is a good glossary of technical terms and a useful index. The drawings by the author are mostly rather simple pen-and-ink reconstructions; often they are rather over-boldly printed. The vol- ume, in my opinion, is much superior to McLoughlin's Archosauria, both in content and in tone. It should find ready acceptance and appreci- ation among paleontological history buffs, al- though I doubt that the Synapsida will come to match the spectacuar dinosaurs in popularity. EVERETT C.
