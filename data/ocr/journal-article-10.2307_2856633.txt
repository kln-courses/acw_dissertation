<plain_text><page sequence="1">THREE OLD FRENCH SOURCES OF THE NONNES PREESTES TALE (PART II) BY ROBERT A. PRATT FOR the narrative of the Nonnes Preestes Tale Chaucer made significant use of "Del cok e del gupil" by Marie de France (1170-90), of Pierre de Saint Cloud's fox and cock episode in Branch II of the Roman de Renart (1174-77), and of the corresponding episode in Branch VI of Renart le Contrefait by an unknown clerc de Troyes (1328-42).17 In using these three Old French poems Chaucer established new emphases on the characters, stressed new conflicts and themes, and de- veloped certain features of his various models, such as learning, anthropomorph- ism, historical perspective, mock-heroic grandeur, and auctorial comments factors which helped to crystallize his themes and universalize their significance. In Marie's fable where, as its title suggests, there are two characters, the cock has the lead. Marie begins with him: "D'un cok recunte"; the opening action is his: "chantot"; he is the center of interest; in the fable proper he has the last word. The audience is concerned throughout with what happens to the cock, the protagonist; the fox is his antagonist. In the Roman de Renart the fox is important because he is the eponymous hero of the entire cycle as well as of the particular series of adventures written up by Pierre de Saint Cloud (Branch II-Va), who makes his audience perpetually eager to learn bow Renart will fare. Renart opens the episode of the fox and cock and he closes it; as he approaches the farm of Constant des Noes it is seen through his eyes; he frightens the hens; he is the center of attention in the complicated, twice-told dream and in Pinte's interpreta- tion of it; he tries to seize Chantecler before enticing him to sing. The story is generally told from his point of view; for the most part it is a series of failures, and the audience see him go off, disconsolate, toward his next adventure. The cock and hen are of secondary and tertiary importance in this episode of the Roman de Renart. The eminence of Renart is even more pronounced in Branch VI of Renart le Contrefait; of the three thousand lines, he has by far the largest share. Thus Chaucer, in making the cock more important than the fox, is in the fable tradition of Marie de France. His "My tale is of a cok" (3252) matches her "D'un cok recunte." Chaucer's own particular contribution was to make even Pertelote the hen more important than the fox. At the same time he made the rivalry of cock and hen more important than the rivalry of cock and fox - so emphatically indeed that when in some manuscripts editors chose to entitle the poem, they generally called it "the Nonnes Preestes tale of the Cok and Hen, Chauntecleer and Pertelote," or the like.'8 17 See Part I in SPECULTUM, XLVII (1972) 422-444.

In the former there is disagreement concerning the dream: after Pinte correctly explains that the fox will betray and deceive him, Chantecler calls her foolish and says that he will not believe that he may have evil through this dream. Pinte declares that it is as she said. Although after Pinte interprets the dream she and Chantecler present their opposing views in only fifteen lines, this very fact of opposition evidently joined the outpourings of the Pinte of Renart le Contrefait to influence Chaucer. Inspired by her discussion of conseil de femme, her hundred-line denunciation of fear and cowardice, her view that the dream was only fantasy, and the fatalistic yet con- cerned attitude toward it of the Chantecler of Renart le Contrefait, Chaucer de- veloped between his Chauntecleer and Pertelote the general conflict concerning conseil de femme, and the debate on the particular question of whether dreams are to be feared. In Studies in Philology, LXIII (1946), 30-31, J. Burke Severs sug- gests that Chaucer's "central theme" is "the baleful influence of woman's counsel"; related to this and equally important (though designed with a different end in view), is the debate on the problem of divination through dreams, which fills nearly three hundred lines or almost half the poem. It was by basing the Nonnes Preestes Tale on these two themes that Chaucer made the rivalry of the cock and hen overshadow and dominate the rivalry of the fox and cock which had formed the core of each of his three models. Pinte's discussion of conseil de femme in Renart le Contrefait had far-reaching effects on the Tale. First, Pertelote insists that her advice to Chauntecleer is sound: "I conseille yow the beste, I wol nat lye" (2945). Next, Pinte's discussion of conseil de femme evidently reminded Chaucer of the passage in his Tale of Melibee where Dame Prudence gives her husband advice on counsel and counsel- lors, and particularly of the example of Eve, whom Dame Prudence holds up as a model woman who gave her husband good counsel; for the Nonnes Preest chooses to present Eve as an example of a woman who gave her husband bad counsel. Dame Prudence says: "And the same bountee in good conseillyng of many a good womman may men telle. And mooreover, whan oure Lord hadde creat Adam, oure forme fader, he seyde in this wise: 'It is nat good to been a man alloone; make we to hym an helpe semblable to hymself.' Heere may ye se that if that wommen were nat goode, and hir conseils goode and profitable, oure Lord God of hevene wolde nevere han wroght hem, ne called hem help of man, but rather confusioun of man." (1102-06). In this passage of course, Chaucer found a reminder that "Mulier est hominis confusio," which Chauntecleer immediately translated as "Womman is mannes joye and al his blis" (3164, 3166) - reminder merely, because the words "con- fusioun of man" are Chaucer's own paraphrase of the words "dommage" and "nuisement" in Renaud de Louens' translation (Sources and Analogues, p. 577) of Albertano of Brescia's Liber Consolationis et Consilii; in Albertano's Latin (ed. Thor Sundby, London: Trtubner, 1873, p. 18) the closest phrase is "malum auxilium." Likewise in the passage spoken by Dame Prudence, the Nonnes Preest found sentiments which he perversely twists into the lines,</page><page sequence="3">648 The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) Wommennes conseils been ful ofte colde; Wommannes conseil broghte us first to wo, And made Adam fro Paradys to go, Ther as he was ful myrie and wel at ese. (3256-59) These interrelations suggest that just as the tragedies framing the fox and cock story in Renart le Contrefait may have determined the position of the Monkes Tale, so Pinte's lecture on conseil de femme may have influenced the position of the Melibee; these portions of Branch VI of Renart le Contrefait may thus have helped determine the organization of the latter half of Fragment VII of the Tales. Next to be considered is Pinte's support of conseil de femme by explaining how Andromache gave Hector counsel which he ought to have followed. This exem- plum, which Chaucer transferred from the hen to the cock, may have been the crucial factor in his decision to provide Chauntecleer with exempla in support of divination through dreams, and thus set up the debate. Comparison shows that Chauntecleer's anecdote about Andromache's dream which accurately fore- warned of Hector's death, was based directly on Pinte's account in Renart le Contrefait. As Chaucer's probable source for this passage, commentators have usually recognized one or more of the well-known, far longer accounts, such as that which fills Chapter xxiv of the De Excidio Troiae Historia of Dares Phrygius, ed. Ferdinand Meister (Leipzig: Teubner, 1873), pp. 28-30; the account found in lines 15263-6244 of the Roman de Troie of Benoit de Sainte-Maure, ed. Leopold Constans, SATF (Paris: Firmin-Didot, 1907), iII, 20-75; that filling most of Liber XXI of the Historia Destructionis Troiae of Guido de Columnis, ed. Nathaniel E. Griffin (Cambridge, Mass.: Mediaeval Academy of America, 1936), pp. 171-75; or that found in lines 8421-660 of "The xxj Boke" of the "Gest Hystoriale" of the Destruction of Troy, ed. Geo. A. Panton and David Donaldson, EETS, 39 (London: Trtibner, 1869), pp. 274-81. In addition to these I have examined lines 425-512 of Liber V of the Frigii Daretis Ylias of Joseph Iscanus in his Werke und Briefe, ed. Ludwig Gompf, Mittellateinische Studien und Texte, 4 (Leiden: Brill, 1970), pp. 173-76; ?? 154-65 of the Roman de Troie en Prose, ed. L. Constans and E. Faral, CFMA, 29 (Paris: Champion, 1922), I, 125-35; lines 9993-109492 of the Laud Troy Book, EETS, 121, 122 (1902, 1903), pp. 295-322; and the three sentenlces quoted in SPECULUM, X (1935), 285, by Pauline Aiken from the Speculum Historiale (ii, lxii) of Vincent de Beauvais. Depending on its length, each of these accounts goes into more or less detail concerning such matters as the actual dream of Andromache, her pleading with Hector to stay out of battle, his reaction, her pleading with Priam, Hector's getting his armor, Priam's keeping Hector from battle, the prowess of the Greeks when they realize that Hector is absent, the slaying of many Trojans, Hector's rushing into battle, his various fights, which encourage the Trojans, and his death at the hands of Achilles. Of the accounts, that in Renart le Contrefait is the closest to Chauntecleer's. The next closest is Benoit's, for its first sixty lines (15263-321; Vol. iII, pp. 20-23) provided the clerc de Troyes with certain ideas and phrases; but study of Benoit's account serves to emphasize the close dependence</page><page sequence="4">The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) 649 of Chaucer on the clerc de Troyes, each of whom presents only Andromache's revelation and Hector's death. Andromada, la femme Hector, Fort com lion, cruel com tor, Se son seigneur creU 1'eust, Si tost a mort point mis ne fust, Quant par amour et par honeur El dit a Hector, son seigneur: "Sire, n'alez pas ad ce jour En bataille ny en estour! Se ad ce jour vous y allez, Si com des dieux est revellez, Ochis serez sans nulle faille, Pour bien le vous conseille et baille; Si vous pri, pour mort retarder, Que vous en voeulliez bien garder." Combien que desist chose voire, Oncquez Hector ne le vaut croire; I1 y ala, et la morut Par Achiles qui le ferut. (31323-40)19 Lo heere Andromacha, Ectores wyf, That day that Ector sholde lese his lyf, She dremed on the same nyght biforn How that the lyf of Ector sholde be lomn, If thilke day he wente into bataille. She warned hym, but it myghte nat availle; He wente for to fighte natheles, But he was slayn anon of Achilles. (3141-48)20 The parallels of word and thought are striking; further, Andromache's "Pour bien le vous conseille" (31334) is echoed by Pertelote's "I conseille yow the beste" (2945). Pinte's use of this exemplum in Renart le Contrefait involves a curious incon- sistency which is matched by a curious omission. Pinte makes clear that Hector's mistake was his refusal to believe Andromache's revelation; but a little later she tells Chantecler that his fear is based on fantasy. In other words, she uses a dream-anecdote to persuade the cock to follow her counsel; but her counsel is that he look upon his own dream as "fantasie" (31464). Now of all the versions, Pinte's is the only one that does not mention the actual dream; instead Pinte says simply 19 Any suspicion that it was with satiric intent that the clerc de Troyes permitted his Pinte to refer to Andromache as "Andromada" is dispelled by the spelling "Andromata" in the prose Roman de Troie (pp. 125-27, 137) and by the MS variants "Andromeda" in Benoit (see, for example, p. 20, 1. 63), and "Andromata," "Andromatha," and "Andrometa" in Guido (p. 171, footnotes 16 and 17). The scribes of the Canterbury Tales offer sixteen variant spellings for "Andromacha"; see John M. Manly and Edith Rickert, The Text of the Canterbury Tales (Chicago: U of Chicago Press, 1940), vi, 584. 20 The exemplum of Andromache's dream in the Nonnes Preestes Tale is followed by a couplet (3149-50) which suggests that Qhauntecleer knew a fuller account than that of the clerc de Troyes: "But thilke tale is al to longe to telle, / And eek it is ny day, I may nat dwelle." Indeed, Chaucer's familiaritv with Benoit, Guido, and Joseph Iscanus has long been recognized.</page><page sequence="5">650 The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) that Hector's fate was revealed to her by the gods: "Si com des dieux est revellez." By this device the clerc de Troyes glosses over the illogical inconsistency in her argument. Chaucer, familiar with the accounts of Troy by Benoit, Guido, and Joseph, recognized clearly that the Andromache exemplumi was far better suited to a cock who believed in divination through dreams than to a hen who was skeptical about it. Thus Pinte's Andromache exemplum in Renart le Contrefait may have influenced Chaucer to have Chauntecleer use exempla to reply to Pertelote's views on dreams and to explain away his fear of the dream. It was suggested in Part I that its companion piece, Pinte's anecdote of the fatal "voiage" of the Count of Bar, may have reminded Chaucer of Valerius Maximus' story of the shipwreck which Chauntecleer took, as his second exemplum, from Robert Holcot's Super Sapientiam Salomonis. Thus Pinte's two stories may together have reminded Chaucer of Holcot's anecdotes and discussions concern- ing dreams. As Petersen made clear (pp. 103-8), Holcot provided both Perte- lote's information on the origin of dreams in the human body, where they arise from the superabundance of a humor, and Chauntecleer's statements in sup- port of divination through dreams as well as most of his illustrative examples. In addition to providing Chauntecleer with his final example of a dream that ought to be feared, it may be that the clerc de Troyes was even-handed enough to aid Pertelote also by teaching her a little about herbs. In Branch IV of Renart le Contrefait the clerc slows down his narrative while Renart describes several professions, including that of "espicerie" (26535-26850), the occupation of the clerc's father and one which the clerc himself followed for ten years. Although Renart names none of the particular herbs listed by Pertelote, some of his re- marks are close to some of hers in lines 2942-67 of the Nonnes Preestes Tale. Renart explains that the apothecary pretends that his herbs were imported, so that he can charge a higher price for them, when actually all of them grew in his own garden: "Et trestout crut en son jardin!" (26762); as for others, men gathered them all in the fields: "aulx champs toutes les coeullirent" (26768), statements with which may be compared the "herbe yve, growyng in oure yeerd" (2966) and Pertelote's remark, "in oure yeerd tho herbes shal I fynde" (2951). One concoction was intended to diminish great heat ("celle tresgrant challeur": 26595); two or three spoonfuls should be taken to diminish the great heat and set the humors in order: Pour aneantir la grant challour Et pour bien mettre a point 1'humour. (26607-8) Another preparation diminishes "le chaut humeur" (26628). Pertelote in turn fears that Chauntecleer may be "repleet of humours hoote" (2957) and offers her remedy. A passage linked to both the Nonnes Preestes Tale and Holcot is Renart's discussion of a concoction called "diacitonitem" (26574) which, he says, "purge melencolie" (26585). In both Lectio cii and Lectio cci of Super Sapientiam Salomonis,2' in the midst of passages on dreams used by Chaucer, 21 I use the edition printed at Basle, 1489; Petersen used that printed at Reutlingen by Johann Otmar, 1489, in which these lectiones are numbered ciii and ccii respectively.</page><page sequence="6">The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) 651 Holcot quotes Albertus Magnus' account of a man who discharged black choler (the humor melancholy): "emisit de se coleram nigram"; this and Pertelote's counsel to Chauntecleer, "That bothe of colere and of malencolye / Ye purge yow" (29946-47), may have interested Chauicer in Renart's passage on "diaci- tonitem" and in the entire discussion of "espicerie," with the result that he de- cided to have Pertelote prescribe to Chauntecleer the herbs and worms. Renart also tells of "une preparacion" so effective that "Dix fois ou douze a chambre irez" (26683), a promise which helps make vivid such a line as "To purge yow bynethe and eek above" (2953). He also says that some medicinal herbs "poeuent estre mortelz" (26823), and even that "Trop croire phisique est folie" (26674)- remarks which bring to mind the climax of Chauntecleer's long, learned, and windy discourse in support of the significance of dreams, where he finally de- clares, I seye forthermoor, That I ne telle of laxatyves no stoor, For they been venymes, I woot it weel; I hem diffye, I love hem never a deel! (3153-56)22 Thus Chaucer elaborately developed the opposition and debate between Per- telote and Chauntecleer. The shift of emphasis from fox and cock to cock and hen which accompanies the introduction of the themes of "wommannes conseil" and of debate on dreams brought about less development and elaboration of personality for the fox than for the hen and the cock. What does each of these creatures bring to the farmyard from its Old French prototypes, and how does Chaucer develop erach? Daun Russell the fox is descended directly from the nameless fox of Marie's fable: it was seen in detail after detail that his actions and conduct are basically those of Marie's fox. The most impressive feature of the Renart created by the clere de Troyes is his extensive learning, which he often displays for a thousand or more lines at a time; yet Chaucer allows his fox only two bookish comments: the statements that Chauntecleer has "in musyk moore feelynge / Than hadde Boece" (3.293-94) and that Chauntecleer's father had more wisdom, discretion, and skill than the cock in "Daun Burnel the Asse" (3312-19). The Roman de Renart may have inspired the hypocritical attempt to get Chauntecleer down out of the tree, an iinnovatioil which intensifies the fox's poise, cleverness, and cynicism. A few details of the enticement scene come from the Roman but they do not affect the character of the fox; nor does Chaucer's emphasis on his mur- derousness (32221-926), which echoes the emphasis on murder and violent death in Chauntecleer's exempla, the Monkes Tale, and one episode of the Prioresses Tale. Daun Russell is essentially the clever, sly, deceitful, murderous, natural fox of the fable tradition. Wishing to preserve this character, Chaucer deliberately gave him a name dif- ferent from that of the eponymous hero of such poems as the Roman de Renart, 22 In reading "venymes" in line 3155 (where Robinson reads "venymous") I follow Manly and Rickert, IV, 269, line B 4345.</page><page sequence="7">652 The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) Renart le Bestourne of Rutebeuf, the Couronnement de Renart, Jacquemart Gielee's Renart le Nouvel,23 and Renart le Contrefait, works which had brought all kinds of accretions to the personality of Renart. Joh Flinn, in reviewing the developing and changing personality of Renart, writes of' the "malin h6ros, gai et alerte, des vieux contes" and of the "personnage arrogant, triomphant, sitr de lui-meme, qui avait 6tale orgueilleusement sa gloire et sa toute-puissance dans tant d'ouvrages du Xllleme siecle" (p. 417); and of the "anciennes conceptions d'un Renart mattre du monde et prince de tous les vices" (p. 405). Again he says: I1 est interessant de suivre dans Renart le Contrefait, la derni&amp;re branche importante de Renart ecrite en frangais, 1'evolution du caractere et du r6le de Renart m6me. Le vieux heros des branches primitives etait devenu avec Rutebeuf le symbole des Ordres Men- diants; dans le Couronnement de Renart il representait avec son election au tr6ne la victoire du patriciat flamand, et dans Renart le Nouvel il incarnait 1'esprit du Mal lui- meme... . Par moments il n'est que le goupil ruse des vieux contes. Ailleurs il joue un r6le tout allegorique, allant jusqu'a representer 1'esprit du Mal, 1'ennemi de Dieu et de la Raison, l'heritier direct de Faux-Semblant et de Fauvel. (pp. 439-40) In short, twentieth-century readers may at times be unaware of the vast and complex accumulations of characteristics and significances which by the late fourteenth century had become attached to the particular fox Renart, and so be unaware of how much Chaucer gained by giving his fox a name with none of those connotations. The Old French adjective "russel," "roussel," means reddish or red-haired. The hero of the Roman de Renart is called on occasion "Renart le rox" (Ia.1797), "Renart le rous" (II.1144), "Renart le ros" (VJ.20), "Renart li roux" (XVI.649). It is the squirrel who is called "Rossaus" (Ja.1691), "Rosauls," Roxel," "Rossel," "Roussel" (XI.1865, 1872, 2050, 92264), "Rousel" (XVII.621), "Rous- siaus" (XXIII.1951, 1958), and "danz Roxax li escuireus" (J.1325). However, at 1.551 and XII.8 is mentioned Renart's son "Rovel," whose name appears as "Rousel" in one manuscript (B) out of the ten containing Branch XII; in the same manuscript the same reading occurs also at line 551 of Branch I (which is in eleven manuscripts). The fox's second son is "Rosseel" in Reinaert de Vos, II.3380, 4464 (c. 1250), a free redaction of Branch I of the Roman de Renart composed by a Flemish poet called Willem.24 Likewise, "Rossel" is the son of Reynard in Jacquemart Gielee's Renart le Nouvel, ed. Henri Roussel, SATF (Paris: Picard, 1961). Whatever may have brought this particular name to his mind, the intention of Chaucer is clear: by calling his villain "daun Russell" he avoided the connotations that had gathered around the name "Renart" and also kept his poem an entity in itself, an independent fable, distinct and apart from the great beast epic, the cycle of Renart, and its descendants. And as "daun Russell," the fox does not disturb the centrality of Chauntecleer and "For the last three poems see Bossuat, pp. 152-58; Flinn, pp. 175-363. X Reinaert: Willens Gedicht Van den Vos Reinaerde, ed. Ernst Martin (Paderborn: Schoningh, 1874); II.4464 reads, "quam mijn joncste soon Rosseel."</page><page sequence="8">The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) 653 Pertelote, whereas with the name "Renart" he might have tended to upstage them. In dramatic fashion Chaucer holds back the name of the fox until the height of his prosperity, the very moment when his trickery has succeeded and at long last his jaws grip the cock by the throat: And daun Russell the fox stirte up atones, And by the gargat hente Chauntecleer. (3334-35) That Chaucer called his villain by name once only, suggests that he did not choose that name in order to intensify the fox's personality in some way, but simply to prevent his identification with the famous Renart, thus denying him both the accretion of Reynardine characteristics that had been developing for two centuries, and also undue prominence. The fact that he is a col-fox with black tips also distinguishes him from the tradition. Daun Russell enters the narrative with no more initial, predetermined importance than that of a local marauding fox who breaks through the hedges. Although Chaucer does not give his fox the great mass of connotations which had become attached to the name "Renart," he nevertheless uses a few epithets and comparisons which the clerc de Troyes had applied to his fox. For example, Chaucer introduces his villain as "A col-fox, ful of sly iniquitee" (3215), and a few lines later calls him "False dissymulour" (39228). During the dialogue between Chantecler and Renart in Branch VI of Renart le Contrefait, the cock tells the fox exactly what he thinks of him: "Tais toy," dist il, "tresmalvais lerres, Tout faulx, tout malvais bareterres, Pire que loup, pire che chien, Je ne te creroie de rien; Tu es plain de male aventure, De iniquite et d'ordure." (31773-78) In introducing the fox, the Nonnes Preest thus uses two of the epithets applied to Renart in Branch VI by the clerc de Troyes. The auctorial apostrophe which contains the phrase "False dissymulour" says more than just that: O false mordrour, lurkynge in thy den! O newe Scariot, newe Genylon, False dissymulour, o Greek Synon, That broghtest Troye al outrely to sorwe! (3226-29) In Branch Va of the Roman de Renart Brun the bear recalls the adventure of the tomtit ("la mesange") from whom Renart wanted a kiss (II.469-508) and com- pares the fox to Judas: "il au baissier l'asailli / Conme Judas qui deu traY" (Va. 761-62). In Branch VII of Renart le Contrefait the priest Hubert, the kite, preaches Renart a long sermon, including a section which urges upon him re- pentance, with the example of Judas: "Judas, quant il ot Dieu tray, / Repentance monlt l'envaiy" (35485-86). Renart mentions Ganelon in the long prose history he recites to Noble the Lion in Branch II of Renart le Contrefait (Vol. I, p. 267, ? 94), but with no sort of comparison. In the first half of the thirteenth century, however, Philippe de Novare had made the comparison in Sirvente LXVII,1l.</page><page sequence="9">654 The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) 9-10: "Car Renart sait plus de traison faire / Que Guenelon, dont France fu traie" (Memoires, ed. Charles Kohler, CEMA, 10, Paris: Champion, 1913, pp. 39-40). When Chaucer named "Greek Synon" he echoed Dante's line, "I'altr'e '1 falso Sinon greco di Troia" (Inferno xxx.98). Although Sinon is not mentioned in Renart le Contrefait, Chantecler twice compares the treachery of Renart with that involving the Trojan horse: in Branch II before Noble the lion (5295-300), and in Branch VI during the enticement episode (32250-60). Clearly some of Chaucer's predecessors had anticipated his auctorial pronouncements on the falseness and treachery of his villain the fox. Of greater importance is the hen Pertelote. Marie's fable had no hens, much less a favorite wife. In Ysengrimus Pierre de Saint Cloud found twelve hens under the sovereign command of their husband, the cock Sprotinus (IV.936); so he chose to have a flock of hens in the Roman de Renart and created Pinte, whose role in the poem is to speak for all the hens when the fox scares them, to hear and interpret the dream, to defend her interpretation, and to lament the capture of the cock. She contributes to Chaucer's presentation of Pertelote in that she perches beside Chantecler (91), is his "amie" (273), and cries, "Avoi!" when he says he is frightened (177). Otherwise this first Pinte has little in common with Chaucer's heroine and contributes virtually nothing to the Nonnes Preestes Tale. She lays big eggs and knows more than the other hens (89-90); she is the one Chantecler turns to concerning his dream because he has faith in her, "ou molt se croit" (170); she believes that his dream signifies that evil will come to him; she calls him her lord, "mon seignor" (367); her chief emotion is fright (93, 179); in lamenting the capture of Chantecler she says, "I told you so!" and, with the airs of a grande dame, is more concerned for her "onor" than for him (357-68). Like her prototype in the Roman, the Pinte of Renart le Contrefait is the hen in whom Chantecler has confidence, "ou il se fye" (31301); otherwise she is a more important figure and a finer creature: she does not display fright, recrimina- tion, or smugness, but tries to give Chantecler courage, help, and comfort. When the fox seizes the cock, this Pinte is not singled out to lament; but "les gelines" are able to cry out loud enough to bring on the chase (33221-29). This second Pinte answers Chantecler's request for good counsel concerning his dream by discussing conseil de femme, fear and cowardice, and the emptiness of dreams, in a passage (31305-31474) twice as long as all her prototype's speeches combined, and she supports her views with two exempla. Altogether it is clear that Pertelote owes little to the Pinte created by Pierre de Saint Cloud but is based on this new Pinte of the clerc de Troyes. In the Nonnes Preestes Tale Chaucer rescues the leading hen from her some- what lowly roles in the Rom( n de Renart and Renart le Contrefait when, making her the fairest of seven sisters, he endows her with compelling beauty which in- spires Chauntecleer's love. This and her other qualities exist to influence her husband. She is a feminist with definite ideas of what her man ought to be. Pinte's enthusiasm for conseil de femme contributed a central issue to the Tale, and her skeptical attitude was developed by Chaucer in the portrayal of his heroine. Like this Pinte, Pertelote has some learning: a knowledge of humors</page><page sequence="10">The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) 655 with which she hoped to convince her husband that dreams are "vanitee," and also a practical knowledge of the herbs she urges him to ingest. During his learned lecture Chauntecleer attempts to hold her attention - and thus keeps the audience aware of her presence and hence of the central conflicts - by re- peatedly addressing her as "Madame," "faire Pertelote so deere," and the like (2970, 3105, 3122, 3158, 3165). This is the hen whose husband "tok his conseil of his wvf, with sorwe" (3253) - though she triumphed not with her arguments, any more than he with his, but with her "softe syde" (3167). No wonder Chaucer chose to reject the name "Pinte" ("pint-sized," or "painted") for this bird and to concoct, on the model of "Chauntecleer" ("one who sings clearly, loudly"), another compound, "Pertelote," which seems to signify "one who ruins, confuses, destroys ('perte') someone's lot or fate ('lote')." In other words, she is "hominis confusio." Yet in the end, for her "Amor vincit omnia": when Chauntecleer was taken, "sovereynly dame Pertelote shrighte" full louder than the bereaved Carthaginian queen - a solo fittingly set between the Trojan and Roman choruses of "alle the bennes" - thus bringing about the chase and the oppor- tunity for Chauntecleer to help himself. Characteristics of Chauntecleer are found in all three Old French poems. In Marie's "Del cok e del gupil" the outstanding possession of the cock is his voice; as the fable begins he stands on a dunghill and sings: "D'un cok recunte ki estot / Sur un femer e si chantot." Of the sources, only the fable has the fox praise the cock's voice and has the cock succumb to flattery concerning his voice; Chaucer likewise has the fox flatter the cock by praising his voice (3289-3303). Pierre de Saint Cloud had emphasized the importance of the voice by calling its possessor "Chantecler," and this is the one name that Chaucer retains from the Roman de Renart and Renart le Contrefait. Since pride in his voice is to be a con- tributing cause of Chauntecleer's fall, Chaucer takes special pains to glorify it. With his first mention of the "cok, hight Chauntecleer" (2849), Chaucer im- mediately states that his voice was peerless, and merrier than the church organ, and that he was so attuned to the heavens that his crowing was more accurate than clock or abbey horologe (2850-58); that he duets with Pertelote in sweet accord (2877-79), with blissful voice pompously announces prime after observ- ing the height of the sun (3191-99), and sings more merrily than the mermaid (3269-72). It is no wonder that Chauntecleer was taken in by dain Russell's lines, But trewely, the cause of my comynge Was oonly for to herkne how that ye synge. For trewely, ye have as myrie a stevene As any aungel hath that is in hevene. (3289-92) Marie's cock is subject to flattery and so possesses at least a modicum of pride. However, the fact that Chaucer's Chauntecleer parades with his wives "in all his pryde" (3191) should be attributed not to Marie but to Pierre de Saint Cloud, who emphasizes the pride of Chantecler on his first appearance in Branch II of the Roman de Renart: "Moult fierement leur vient devant / La plume ou pie, le col tendant" (85-86). Although in the Roman pride is also shown in the cock's</page><page sequence="11">656 The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) disdainful attitude towards the warnings given by Renart's scaring the hens, by the dream itself, by Pinte's correct interpretation of it, and by the fox's first attack, yet a factor contributing to this disdain is the cock's exceeding foolishness. It should be noted in passing that in Pinte's soliloquy-lament her words, "Vostre senz vos a escharni" (362) become "Vostre orgoil si vos a trai" in two manu- scripts (C, Mn). The cock in Renart le Contrefait did not possess a remarkable voice; he was neither proud nor susceptible to flattery; he was exceedingly bold. Yet he made two significant contributions to the Nonnes Preestes Tale. His fatalistic but con- cerned attitude towards his dream Chaucer utilized as the germ of Chauntecleer's attitude. In order to set this cock squarely in opposition to the skepticism of Pertelote, Chaucer developed the fatalistic concern into belief in divination through dreams, a development aided and influenced by learning found in Robert Holcot's Super Sapientiam Salomonis. In making Chauntecleer learned - and also Pertelote and daun Russell, though to an inferior degree -Chaucer yet again followed the precedent of the clerc de Troyes, for the clerc's Chantecler was exceedingly well read, even though not on the subject of dreams.25 There is no learning in "Del cok e del gupil" of Marie de France, and little in the Roman de Renart. To be sure, in Branch XVI of the Roman de Renart the fox quotes Cato (618-20); elsewhere casual allusions are made to David (XXIII.1014), Solomon (VII.562), Julius Caesar (Va.482), and Judas (Va.7692). Otherwise the animals and birds of the Roman reveal no evidence of having "hir bookes herd." The situation in Renart le Contrefait is altogether different: Renart's learning is dis- played throughout the poem, filling a generous portion of its forty thousand lines. As for Branch VI alone, the enticement episode (31490-3200) consists of a seven- teen-hundred-line dialogue in which Renart tries to win Chantecler's friendship by quoting Cato and twelve other authorities. Chantecler counters by quoting from David, Cato, Cicero, Seneca, St. Augustine, and St. Maximus. He later lists the names of most of the writers cited by Renart and piles onto them eighteen more. During the dialogue each speaker uses illustrative stories: Renart tells two stories and a saint's life; Chantecler, two exempla. Further, it will be recalled that in Branch VI, before his adventure with the cock, Renart told of certain personages, including five from classical times, who like him had been maltreated by Fortune. Although her learning is far less than Renart's or Chantecler's, even Pinte can tell about Andromache's warning to Hector as an example in support of conseil de femme. Thus the clerc de Troyes presented Chaucer with a rooster who was exceedingly well read, and a hen who in this respect was distinctly his inferior. In the Tale Pertelote dilates on humors and herbs, quotes Cato, and concludes by saying, "Dredeth no dreem" (2969). Then, just as in Renart le Contrefait the fox's speech rouses the cock to answer, so in the Tale the hen's discourse incites 26Lilian Winstanley, ed., Chaucer: The Nonne Prestes Tale (1915; rpt. Cambridge: the University Press, 1960), pp. Iviii, lxviii, suggests that Chaucer knew Renart le Contrefait because of its learning, digressions and "general method."</page><page sequence="12">The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) 657 the cock to counter with his show of learning that fills nearly two hundred lines. Although this massive outpouring of authorities and "ensamples olde" may be due in part to his joy in hearing himself lecture, his main purposes are clearly to maintain superiority over Pertelote, to prove her wrong and himself right, to justify and explain away his fear, and to avoid the proffered laxatives and emetics. He not only musters a vast amount of knowledge acquired from Holcot and others, but again and again heightens its relevance to this particular debate. He particularly desires to show that in being "agast" of his dream he is not foolish nor cowardly, but wise and knowledgeable. Since Pertelote had said, "Dredeth no dreem," Chauntecleer especially emphasizes his proofs that "dremes been to drede" (3063; see also 2970-77, 3105-9). To Valerius Maximus' story of Simonides (Holcot, Lectio cci) Chauntecleer even adds a new character, the skeptical friend who foolishly and fatally rejects the dreamer's advice not to sail that day: "No dreem," quod he, "may so myn herte agaste That I wol lette for to do my thynges. I sette nat a straw by thy dremynges, For swevenes been but vanytees and japes." (3088-91) In this speech the skeptical friend echoes the very language of the skeptical Pertelote: Have ye no mannes herte, and han a berd? Allas! and konne ye been agast of swevenys? Nothyng, God woot, but vanitee in sweven is. (2920-22) Likewise the cock touches up the story of the two travellers by saying of the skeptical dreamer, "Hym thoughte his dreem nas but a vanitee" (3011). Again, taking Daniel from the Monkes Tale, where he "the dremes of the kyng ex- powned" (2156), the cock suggests to the hen that she consider well whether Daniel "heeld dremes any vanitee" (3129). Nailing down the lid, Chauntecleer deliberately and carefully disposes of Pertelote's contentions. Working in a contrary direction is Chauntecleer's love for Pertelote. In the Roman de Renart the only hint of love between cock and hen is the fact that Pinte perches on Chantecler's right: "Qui pres du coc jucoit a destre" (91). R,,nart le Contrefait offers no hints at all. Hence one of Chaucer's most significant innovations is Chauntecleer's strong and steady predilection for Pertelote. His mood of love is introduced early in the poem along with his "Sevene hennes for to doon al his plesaunce, / Which were his sustres and his paramours" (2866-67), and is continued through most of the Tale. Passion keeps him busy all day long and leads him near to downfall. The Nonnes Preest stresses the love of Chaunte- cleer for the fairest of the seven, the beautiful demoiselle Pertelote; their love song (2877-79); her beauty, which destroys his fear (3160-62); her "softe syde" (3167); his feathering and treading (3177-78); his pet names for her (2889, 3105, 3200); and, topping all,'these lines which even echo from the opening passage (2866) the phrase "al his plesaunce":</page><page sequence="13">658 The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) 0 Venus, that art goddesse of plesaunce, Syn that thy servant was this Chauntecleer, And in thy servyce dide al his poweer, Moore for delit than world to multiplye, Why woldestow suffre hym on thy day to dye? (3342-46) Thus fatally does love cause Chauntecleer to submit to "wommannes conseil." The courtly nuances of the love and behavior of the cock and hen fit well with the princely, the regal qualities of Chauntecleer and with the grande dame in Pertelote. In their high gentility this couple is far removed from the Chantecler and Pinte of the fox and cock episode of the Roman de Renart, except perhaps for Pinte's words, "se je ci pert mon seignor, / A toz jors ai perdu m'onor" (367-68). They are related instead to the world of Noble the lion, which lies outside the farmyard. Noble's court is frequented by his vassals, the chief of whom - Pierre's "deus barons" (11.14) Renart and Ysengrin - are, as Foulet says, "conscients de leurs privileges feodaux et de leur dignite" (p. 166). Of their king, Bossuat writes, "Au sommet de cette hi6rarchie tr6ne un souverain, Noble, le lion, qui, d6ja' dans la fable antique et dans les Isopets qui en derivent, jouit de cette pri- maut6. Comme le roi Arthur, dans les romans courtois, comme Charlemagne, dans l'epopee, comme le roi de France aussi dans la realit6 contemporaine, il s'impose par sa majestV" (p. 91). This heritage and a touch of this majesty en- hance the stately figure of Chauntecleer, at the summit of his little world; and the character of Pertelote somewhat resembles from afar that of Noble's queen, of whom Bossuat writes, "Madame Fiere, la lionne, paratt directement issue de la po6sie courtoise," and whom he describes as "Orgueilleuse, e1lgant et belle" (p. 102). Like these fine creatures, Chauntecleer and Pertelote in words and be- havior imitate and parody the heroes and heroines of the romans courtois. Many phases of this courtliness, of the love and "plesaunce," of the question of 'wommannes conseil," and of the opposing views on dreams, contribute effec- tively to one of the most pointed and delightful features of the Nonnes Preestes Tale, its anthropomorphism, of which Chauntecleer is the chief beneficiary."Del cok e del gupil" has no real anthropomorphism. Of Marie de France, Foulet wrote, "Chez Marie le goupil et le loup ne sont que des animaux: ils peuvent parfois singer les attitudes et les gestes de la societe bumaine, a tel point qu'on peut tirer de leurs actions une morale utile, mais ils n'en savent rien" (p. 166). Chaucer, on the other hand, develops his poem into a veritable Symphonia Domestica as cock and hen sleep, wake, eat, quarrel, love, sing, weep, strut, argue, and advise. Yet those members of Chaucer's audience who were familiar with such poems as the Roman de Renart were presumably not impressed by the mere presence of anthropomorphism in the Tale: they had become accustomed to the tradition. The anthropomorphism, charming as it may be, was not Chau- cer's gift to the cock and fox story: he had been anticipated by Pierre de Saint Cloud and his fellow authors of the Roman as well as by their successors. An important part of the anthropomorphic effect was obtained by applying to the animals, terms which properly belong to human beings. For example, the title "dan" ("dans," "dant," "danz") was often given to Renart in the Roman,</page><page sequence="14">The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) 659 though not, it so happens, in its fox and cock episode; in Branch VI of Renart le Contrefait the fox is twice called "dampt Regnart." In various relationships to the cock and hen Chaucer applied a variety of words identical with or similar to words used in connection with animals in the Roman.2" Such words as "fader" and "sire" are matched by corresponding words ("pere," "sire") in Pierre's fox and cock episode, which also has "cosin," "oncles," and "parenz," which are not in the Tale. The following correspond to words in other episodes of the Roman, some of them, as might be expected, designating high rank: "mooder" ("mere"); "sustres" ("suer"); "man" ("hom"); "housbonde" ("mariz"); "womman," "wyves" ("fame"); "madame" ("dame"); "damoysele" ("damoiselle"); "prince" ("prince"); "real," "roial" ("roial"); "a prince . . . in his halle" ("la cort le roi," "en cort de roi"); "sovereynly" ("souverain"). Thus the cock and hen in the Nonnes Preestes Tale are presented by means of words identical with, or rather similar to, words used for some of the other animals in the Roman. How effectively Chaucer uses them may be seen, for example, in "For certes, what so any womman seith, / We alle desiren ... / To han housbondes hardy, wise . . ." and so on (2912-14), or "I herde nevere man so synge" (3301). The creatures in the two poems use similar expressions: "By God!", "pardee" ("par De," "par Dieu"); "God woot" ("Dieu sait," "Diex le set"); "as wys God helpe me" ("si m'aist Diex"); "God yeve hym meschaunce" ("Diex doint male avanture"); "for Goddes love" ("por amor Dieu"); "Up peril of my soule" ("par m'ame"). In making his animals seem human, Chaucer was inspired not merely by the fox and cock episode of the Roman, but by other portions as well. What sort of model was available to him is indicated by Bossuat's description of anthropo- morphism in the hands of Pierre de Saint Cloud and his imitators; and the extent to which Bossuat's comments apply also to Chaucer suggests the extent to which be worked in the tradition of Pierre. Bossuat is discussing the "habilete des jongleurs pour adapter la societe des animaux 'a la societe des hommes": L'art du poete consiste a mener ce jeu delicat mais dangereux de telle fagon que le lecteur se laisse prendre a la fiction sans perdre de vue la realite. Ce qui fait la superiorite des deux branches principales, c'est que leurs auteurs ont su garder 1'equilibre en se tenant sur 1'ar6te etroite qui separe les deux mondes. L'anthropomorphisme se reduit cbez eux a des nuances psychologiques, mais ils ont soin de laisser aux animaux leur figure et leur instinct. Comme 1'ecrit justement M. P. Jonin, a propos de la branche I: "L'auteur veut bien creer l'illusion en pretant a ses personnages des aventures et des passions humaines, mais cette illusion, il ne la veut pas totale. II nous rappelle de temps a autre que nous sommes chez des quadrupedes qui conservent leurs caracteristiques respectives."27 (p. 130) Chaucer's contribution appears to be the ringing of changes on the usual, the conventional devices of anthropomorphic portrayal by introducing absurd details and connotations, for example, Chauntecleer's mention of his undershirt: "By 26 These words and others may be located through the "Index des mots relatifs a la civilisation et aux mceurs" at the back of each of the first five volumes of Le Roman de Renart, ed. Mario Roques, CFMA, 78, 79, 81, 85, 88 (Paris: Champion, 1948-60). 27 The comment by Pierre Jonin is found in Annales de la Facult6 des Lettres d'Aix, xxv (1951), 81, in his article on "Les animaux et leur vie psychologique dans Le Raman de Renart (branche i)."</page><page sequence="15">660 The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) God! I hadde levere than my sherte / That ye hadde rad his legende, as have I" (3120-21). In a spirit of comic incongruity Chaucer has Chauntecleer and Perte- lote oscillate between the gallinaceous and the human. After his final exemplum Chauntecleer feathers Pertelote; then he is like "a grym leoun" (3179), a com- parison appropriate to Hector, as with the clerc de Troyes: "Fort corn lion, cruel com tor" (31324);28 then "in his pasture" (his eating area, his domain) Chaun- tecleer is awarded a stately simile with intimations of the grand ceremonials of royalty; but he starts as a cock foraging for grain: He chukketh whan he hath a corn yfounde, And to hym rennen thanne his wyves alle. Thus roial, as a prince is in his halle, Leve I this Chauntecleer in his pasture. (3182-85) Thus Chaucer works a comic reverse on anthropomorphism: after convincing the audience that cock and hen are actually prince and "damoysele," he abruptly zoomorphizes them back to the farmyard with a jolt. Again, in the midst of lan- guage of amour courtoise Chauntecleer finds beauty in Pertelote's face, saying, "Ye been so scarlet reed aboute youre yen" (3161) and mentioning her "softe syde" and their perch. And after she discourses on herbs, exhibiting the lore of a well-nurtured lady, Pertelote with disconcerting suddenness cries, "Pekke hem up right as they growe and ete hem yn" and then immediately alludes to the cock's gentle birth: "Be myrie, housbonde, for youre fader kyn!" (p2967-68). Comic anthropomorphism and zoomorphism are accomplished simultaneously when Chauntecleer's hens are called "his sustres and his paramours" all in one breath (2867); when his dream causes Chauntecleer at once to "gronen" and to "roore" (2886, 2888); and when Pertelote cries, "Have ye no mannes herte, and han a berd?" (2920), the audience realizing that wattles were called "barbae."29 The beard reappears when the lament by the hens on the capture of their husband surpasses that made for Priam: Chaucer knew from Virgil and his other authori- ties that Priam was seized bv the hair, but he brings him close to Chauntecleer by having Pyrrhus seize his beard. Then suddenly after the lamentations, as if the clock had struck midnight, the hens are no longer fine ladies; Chauntecleer is an imperilled farmyard cock and daun Russell a marauding fox. The ultimate purpose of this carefully developed "oscillating" anthropo- morphism cannot have been to ridicule a farmyard rooster pretending to be a man. Chaucer was after other game. By means of subtle flattery based on impli- cations of superiority, he entices members of his audience - whether ordinary people, lords, princes, or learned clerks - to laugh at the pompous cock; then without warning he lowers the boom by making them suddenly realize that they laugh at themselves. The butt of his satire is man. 28 For comparison of Roland and others to the lion see Maurice Wilmotte, L'1pop6e Frangaise: Origine et Elaboration (Paris: Boivin [1939J, pp. 106-07. 29 Alexander Neckham, De Naturis Rerum, ed. Thomas Wright (London: Longman, Green, etc., 1863), p. 121, writes of the "palearia rubricata, quae vulgo dicuntur barbae"; see John M. Steadman, Isis, L (1959), 243.</page><page sequence="16">The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) 661 Chaucer humanizes his characters and brings them into the world of mankind by presenting them against a background of history. The Roman de Renart glances only once at the past, comparing Chantecler, Pinte, and others, to the Trojans (VI. 1344-50). However, the clerc de Troyes was forever eager to air his learning; so when Chaucer enriched his anthropomorphic portravals by alluding to his- torical figures, he was probably influenced by the great variety of historical figures in Renart le Contrefait. Branch I has a series of biographical sketches filling nearly 600 lines in which Renart says that good counsel is necessary if one is to avoid the fates of such men as Croesus, Priam, Nebuchadnezzar, Ferrand of Portugal, Nero, and Pierre Remi. Renart's pavilion, described in 700 lines of Branch II, is decorated with paintings of a dozen events, biblical, classical, and medieval, including the fall of Troy, the combat of Hector and Achilles, and the history of Joseph and his brethren. Later in the same Branch Renart relates to Noble the lion the history of the world from the fall of the angels to 1328. After 17,000 lines he reaches Augustus, having covered two thirds of his material; Noble suggests that he continue in prose, which he does for the remaining third. The biographical sketches of unfortunate men and women in the opening and closing sections of Branch VI were listed in Part I. The clerc uses many historical personages for decoration, illustration, and comparison; his characters live in a vast world extending from the creation to their immediate present, and with pre- monitions of the future, as his mind sweeps from Adam and Eve to the betrayal to the day of judgment, from earth to hell, earth to heaven. By similar means Chaucer too gives his Tale depth of perspective and imagina- tive scope. Utilizing few figures in little space, he places daun Russell, Chaunte- cleer, and Pertelote against an essentially tragic background of universal history which enhances the personality and condition of each. At the opening of the fable section, he sets the stage for Chauntecleer's adventure by telling of . . . the month in which the world bigan, That highte March, whan God first maked man, (3187-88) a passage which seems to echo the clerc's lines from Renart's generous account of the beginning of the world, the temptation, and the expulsion from "Paradis terrestre": Lorsfist Dieu homme a sa samblance.... Le premier jour du ciecle fu, Ainsi comme je I'ay sceu, Dix et sept jours en mars entrant; Fu du monde commencement. (6507, 6511-14) Soon daun Russell is introduced; it has already been noted that Chaucer drew from predecessors - including both Pierre de Saint Cloud and the clerc de Troyes -when he compared this fox to Judas Iscariot, Ganelon, and Sinon (32296-29). Just as the clerc refers to contemporary events, so Chaucer compares the shouting of the fox's pursuers to that of "Jakke Straw and his meynee" (3393-97). Again just as in Branch VI Renart compared his misfortunes with those of various personages, so Chauntecleer, after his warning dream, by implication compares</page><page sequence="17">662 The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) himself to victims of tragic falls and deaths, dreamers of significative dreams: the boy martyr King Kenelm, King Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, King Croesus, and Prince Hector. He is also compared in various ways to other tragic figures Adam, King Richard Coeur-de-Lion, King Priam, King Hasdrubal, and the Roman senators under Nero - and also, by indirection, to Christ and Roland. Most of these are paragons of chivalry, royalty, or sanctity. Pertelote is con- trasted with Andromache and receives heightening from Eve, from the wives bereaved at Troy, Carthage, and Rome, and from the goddess Venus. Through such allusions, the role, predicament, and significance of each character is elevated and universalized. Closely involved with the anthropomorphic elevation of Chauntecleer, his high social rank and courtly bearing, and his purported resemblance to great figures of history and romance, is Chaucer's use of high style, both in the narrative proper and in auctorial interpolations, guided in part by the precepts of Geoffrey of Vinsauf. Like the oscillation of Chauntecleer between the gallinaceous and human states, the often simultaneous alternation between the high and low styles con- tributes to the comic inflation and deflation of the hero. Especially effective are the mock-heroic set-pieces which heighten five important moments in the Tale: the introductory description of the hero, his dream, the ideal landscape setting for his adventure, the funereal lament of the nearly widowed ladies, and the wild and raucous chase. Except for the first, these purple passages are related to and presumably inspired by mock-heroic episodes in the Roman de Renart. The chansons de geste and the romans often portray the physical beauty, abilities, and character of the hero.30 Although such portraiture is not characteristic of the Roman de Renart,3' Chaucer makes up for the lack with his brilliant portrayal of Chauntecleer, its tone set by the description of his comb, "batailled as it were a castel wal" (2860), of "his legges and his toon" "Lyk asure" (2862), suggesting heraldic tincture, and of his "wyves." The occurrence in the Roman de Renart of the other mock-heroic features is discussed by Bossuat: "Or le souvenir des romans arthuriens survit dans un grand nombre de branches" (p. 124); and later: "L'influence des chansons de geste n'est pas moins apparente, si bien que l'epopee animale offre souvent une parodie de l'epopee feodale et guerriere dont elle adopte les cliches et les elements carac- teristiques. C'est le songe de Chantecler, qui rappelle les avis premonitoires adresses par le Ciel a Charlemagne . .." (p. 127). Pierre de Saint Cloud has Chantecler awaken from his dream in fright, following the epic convention. 80 See, for example, Otto Clausnitzer, Die Kampfschilderung in den dltesten Chansons de geste, Diss. Halle-Wittenberg 1926 (Halle: Jung, 1926), 37-42; Alice M. Colby, The Portrait in Twelfth-Century French Literature (Geneva: Droz, 1965), Ch. iv, "Chr6tien's Portraits of Handsome Men." 3' There is a portrait of a dwarf in one of the later branches (XIII. 755-79), In the historical section of Branch II of Renart le Contrefait are descriptions of Alexander (10018-27 and 11639-54), and of Julius Caesar (21463-74) and his horse (21489-513); in Branch IV the exemplum concerning two brothers, one religious, one worldly, uses description to contrast them (26069-124). None of this portraiture seems relevant to the Nonnes Preestes Tale.</page><page sequence="18">The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) 663 Charlemagne, however, had not been terrified, evidence perhaps of his greatness, or of his intimate relationship with God.2 Going to the opposite extreme, Chaucer exaggerates the dreamer's conventional fear; he also has Chauntecleer not only groan, like La3amon's Arthur, but even roar. The solemn prayer after the dream - a fairly common tradition - is reduced to two lines. As an example of the influence of the romans arthuriens on the Roman de Renart Bossuat points out that Noble, the lion, "tient sa cour pleniere au retour de la belle saison, . . . quand fleurit l'aubepine et s'epanouit la rose" (p. 124). Descrip- tions of springtime settings were often a feature of the chansons de geste and the romans; Bossuat notes several which appear in the Roman de Renart, three for the month of May (p. 129). 3 One such passage occurs in Branch XVI, mentioned in Part I in connection with the setting and chase because of the well-stocked farm of Bertaut le Mere, his "baston," and cry of "haha!"; as Renart approaches the farm, the conventional flowers and birds are described: Ce fu en mai en cel termine Que la fleur monte en I'aube espine, Prez reverdissent et 1i bos, Et oissel chantent sanz repos. (15-18) Renart comments on this Maytime scene: Je cuit, c'est paradis terrestrez.... Vez ci le bois et le ruissel! Onques mes ne vi voir si bel: Veez con est vert et floris! (46, 49-51) In tune with these rhapsodies are Chauntecleer's remarks on the paradisical May- morning setting of his adventure. First Chaucer brings to mind the beginning of the world and the creation of Adam before allowing the cock to promenade in the sun with his wives and to say, Madame Pertelote, my worldes blis, Herkneth thise blisful briddes how they synge, And se the fresshe floures how they sprynge; Ful is myn herte of revel and solas! (3200-03) Just as the chansons de geste and the romans courtois tell what the bereaved U For the fear following a dream see, for example, Richard Mentz, "Die Triiume in den Alt- franz6sischen Karls- und Artus-Epen," Ausgaben und Abhandlungen aus dem Gebiete der Romanischen Philologie, 73 (Marburg: Elwert, 1888), 25-28; for Charlemagne see p. 28; for the prayer after the dream (to be mentioned next) see p. 27; for the customary fear, see also Wilhelm Baake, Die Ver- wendung des Traummotivs in der englischen Dichtung bis auf Chaucer, Diss. Halle-Wittenberg (Halle: John, 1906), pp. 45-46. 38 Bossuat suggests that these descriptions are perhaps "une reminiscence de la po6sie lyrique" (p. 129), but in Die Landschaftsschilderungen in den Ronmanen Chrestiens de Troyes (Bern: Francke, 1958, pp. 43-47) Manfred Gsteiger makes amply clear that these Friihlingsschilderungen are also an established feature of the romans.</page><page sequence="19">664 The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) say in their laments, 4 in the Roman de Renart "ce sont les lamentations de Pinte, qui regrette son vaillant seigneur" (Bossuat, p. 127); but in the Tale Chaucer tells instead what noise the hens made and how Pertelote shrieked, and amplifies the "lament" with grandiose comparisons from antiquity. Of the chases in the Roman de Renart Bossuat writes, "On notera comme une frappante imitation des procedes epiques, dans la branche I, l'enumeration des vilains qui se ruent sur Brun, . . . et surtout, dans la branche Va, la cavalcade eperdue des matins et des lices qui, sous la conduite de Roonel, cherchent a couper au goupil le chemin de son repaire.... Comme les Sarrasins dans le val de Roncevaux ou dans la plaine de l'Archamp, la meute dechainee se rue sur le guerrier fugitif et la poursuite se deroule 'a un rythme accelere, jusqu'au moment oui Renard disparait dans l'ouverture de son terrier. La parodie est ingenieuse et l'effet saisissant . . ." (pp. 127-28). The possible influence upon Chaucer of the comic chases of the Roman has already been stressed; but he was not slavishly following the mock-heroic tradition of that poem, for he reduces some of the pursuing troops to geese and bees, and then echoes the heaven-shattering trum- pets of Arthur. Thus mock-heroic passages in the Roman inspired Chaucer to imitation, but his satiric originality colors the various moments of epic grandeur that enhance his poem from beginning to end. The content of the auctorial interpolations which interrupt and at the same time enrich the narrative of the Tale, comes mostly from Latin sources. Espe- cially noteworthy is the Nova Poetria of Geoffrey of Vinsauf, which in addition to providing material, may have stimulated and guided a number of Chaucer's rhetorical extravagances both in the interpolations and elsewhere.35 It was noted earlier that material in the apostrophe on the treachery of the fox - "O newe Scariot ... !" - is related to Old French poems on Renart; and it may have been the Roman de Renart and Renart le Contrefait that incited Chaucer to make excessive use of auctorial comment. Nine branches of the Roman have auctorial introductions of various lengths, and one has a concluding statement. Branch II begins, "Seigneurs, you have heard many contes which many a raconteur recounts to you of how Paris ravished Helen, . . . of Tristram, . . . but never of the war between Renart and Ysengrin" - and so on (lines 1-22). Concerning state- ments in this passage the author says, "ce est la voire" (17), and "ce est la pure," that is "the pure truth (14; likewise IV.3). A little later, introducing Chantecler's dream, Pierre interrupts the narrative by saying, "this is the truth, you may find it in the histoire (history, account, story)" ("ce est la voire, / Trover le poez en l'estoire": 133-34). The Nonnes Preest interrupts his Tale in order to say, "This storie is also trewe, I undertake, / As is the book of Launcelot de Lake, / That wommen holde in ful greet reverence" (3211-13). In Branch VII the author, with "For the lament see, for example, Otto Zimmermann, Die Totenklage in den altfranz&amp;sischen chan- sons de geste, i, Diss. Berlin 1899 (Berlin: Ebering), 30-86: "Die Gattin beklagt ihren Gatten." 35 See, for example, Karl Young, "Chaucer and Geoffrey of Vinsauf," MP, XLI (1948-44), 172-82; Robert A. Pratt, "The Classical Lamentations in the Nun's Priest's Tale," MLN, LXIV (1949), 77-78; and Nevill Coghill and Christopher Tolkien, eds., Chaucer: The Nun's Priest's Tale (1959; rpt. London: Harrap, 1968), pp. 18-20, 46-50.</page><page sequence="20">The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) 665 Renart in mind, comments on Fortune, saying, for example, "Tex est la costume Fortune / Que l'un eime, l'autre rancune" (9-10; cf. "Lo, how Fortune turneth sodeynly / The hope and pryde eek of hir enemy!": 3403-04). In the prologue of Branch IV (1-32), the author says, "Si me selt em por fol tenir. / Mes j'ai ol dire en escole: / De fol ome sage parole" (14-16; cf. "But ye that holden this tale a folye . . .": 3438). In the opening of Branch II he says, "Or oez le conmencement" (19). Branch X starts, "Se or vos voliez taisir, / Seignor, ja poriez oTr . . ."; and XII, "Oez une novele estoire . . ." (cf. "Now, goode men, I prey yow herkneth alle": 3402). These are all conventional minstrel remarks, and the Roman de Renart anticipates Chaucer's parody of the tradition. In Renart le Contrefait the clere has much to say on his own account. At the beginning of each of the first three Branches the clere talks about himself or comments on his book. At a break in the action of Branch IV he discusses corruption in the world (28329-80) and between two episodes of V gives an unexpected discourse on grace (29871-988). At crucial moments he stops the story of the fox and cock in order to comment on the action. When the cock lays his head on the ground so as to see hell, the author deliberately interrupts in order to say that he who seeks hell deserves to have it (33183-90); already noted is the clerc's interruption, as the fox is about to taunt his pursuers, with a preachment against excessive joy (33239-52), thus delaying Chantecler's escape. In a similar manner Chaucer stops the action at about the same point in order to tell (as just noted) how Fortune turns against her enemy (3403-04), and he delays the capture, chase, and escape with apostro- phe after apostrophe. The clerc de Troyes was preaching in a serious vein, but Chaucer's Preest was clearly amused by these inane interruptions and parodied this auctorial gaucherie, even taking his digression on flatterers (3325-30) almost verbatim from a manual for preaching, as pointed out in SPECULUM, 41 (1966), 635-36. Although Chaucer parodied auctorial interpolations, in his use of them he went far beyond his models. The Nonnes Preest sets the tone of the Tale and acts as Chorus, commenting on and interpreting the near-tragedy, by means of inter- polations, at once comic and significant, on such matters as "Goddes worthy forwityng," "necessitee," "free choys," on "conseil of wommen," Venus, and Fri- day. The clerc de Troyes, too, had presented a universe offering a variety of scien- tific, philosophical, and religious problems. For example, he has Renart consider determinism, the relation of the planets to God, and their influence on human affairs (23585-98; 35035-84). In Branch VI during his long dialogue with Renart (31490-33202), Chantecler is greatly concerned about Christian values and prac- tices, and is eager to learn about hell and the singing angels of Paradise. At the close of Branch VII when Renart reveals a fatalistic attitude, Hubert the kite maintains that a man owes his misfortunes to himself (38663-82). It was noted above that in an auctorial interpolation the clere de Troyes discusses grace. With the example of the clere in his mind, it was natural for Chaucer to enrich his ver- sion of the cock and fox story with comments fundamental alike to the characters, author, and audience. For example, one of the most significant of Chaucer's mock-heroic set-pieces is</page><page sequence="21">666 The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) the description of the ideal landscape, for taken with the auctorial comments immediately preceding it on the creation of the world and of man (3187-88) and the expulsion of Adam because of "Wommannes conseil" (3257-59), the setting- even with all the wives - becomes the Garden of Eden, and the audience is re- minded that they, quite as much as Chauntecleer and Pertelote, are sons of Adam and daughters of Eve. In such ways as this Chaucer's interpolations help to develop the two basic conflicts of the poem, the two themes, until these even- tually become one. Chauntecleer, in tune with the heavens, receives a "super- celestial" dream, a warning from God, whose "conseil" is opposed by that of Pertelote, "hominis confusio." The cock was well warned of the fox's presence, which was "By heigh ymaginacioun forncast" (3217).36 He could not escape his "destinee" (3338). As the Preest may have learned from the Nonne, "Amor vincit omnia." The ambiguity of the word "amor" is matched by that of the word "bliss," for "mannes joye and al his blis," his "confusio," is the opposite of that "heighe blisse" of God to which the Nonnes Preest points in his benediction. Marie de France does not interrupt her fables with auctorial comment; instead she explains the lesson of each in the moral at the end. For example, after the story of the ant and the cricket she points out that it is a warning against careless- ness and idleness; and after the story of the crow and the fox sbe indicates that it warns how the proud are taken in by flattery. Now as a part of the narrative of "Del cok e del gupil" each of the two characters in the fable presents his tradi- tional moral: first the fox warns against speaking when one should be silent, and then the cock against shutting the eye that ought to watch and guard. Yet even so, Marie puts in the last word: needing to add a moral herself, she simply echoes the message of the fox: Ceo funt ]i fol: tut 1i plusur Parolent quant deivent taiser, Teisent quant il deivent parler. (36-38) Chaucer notes well this excessive moralizing and manages to outdo Marie. He avoids her repetition of the fox's moral; keeping in mind the weaknesses of his characters, he offers something different in the way of pointing the lesson; and he hits not just one foible but two, piling up moralites to the point of absurdity: '1 With a hint from Kenneth Sisam, ed., Chaucer, The Nun's Priest's Tate (1927; rpt. Oxford: Clarendon, 1966), p. 48, I take this to mean "foreseen, or foretold, or imagined beforehand, by the exalted imagination," i.e., in Chauntecleer's dream; see Victor M. Hamm, MLN, LXIX (1954), 394-95, who points out that Dante, in connection with his ecstatic visions in Purgatorio xvii, uses the expres. sion "alta fantasia" (25). In this passage Dante also makes use of the words "imaginativa" (13), "imagine" (21, 31), and "l'imaginar" (43). See the notes on Purgatorio xvii.13-18 and 25 in Volume II, part 2, of Dante Alighieri, The Divine Comedy (Princeton University Press, 1972), translated and edited by Charles S. Singleton, who has generously allowed me to study them in proof. The word "imaginatio" and such cognates as "imaginativi," "imaginatum," and "imaginarie" are used by Hol- cot in connection with dreams (Lectiones cii and cci). See also MED, Part F.3, p. 733, s.v. "forecast- ing," (b): "divination, foretelling," c. 1500; and OED, IV, 430, s.v. "Forecast," v., 2: "imagine beforehand" (1494).</page><page sequence="22">The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) 667 Lo, swich it is for to be recehelees And necligent, and truste on flaterye. (3436-37) But Marie is not content with merely appending a moral to each fable; she also takes pains to point out in her Prologue that there is no fable of folie where there is not some wisdom (i.e., moral teaching) in the morals which come after- wards, where all the weight of the stories iS:37 Mes n'i ad fable de folie U il nen ait philosophie Es [es]samples ki sunt apres, U des cuntes est tut li fes. (23-26) Chaucer did not miss this; he continues to parody Marie and the tradition, embellishing point by point: But ye that holden this tale a folye, As of a fox, or of a cok and ben, Taketh the moralite, goode men. For seint Paul seith that al that writen is, To oure doctrine it is ywrite, ywis; Taketh the fruyt, and lat the chaf be stille. (3438-43) The sources of the Nonnes Preestes Tale are not lost. Written in England for aristocratic forebears of Chaucer's patrons, Marie's Fables must have been known to Chaucer from his early years; later he seems to have read widely in the Roman de Renart, read and reread. How he came to know the almost unknown Renart le Contrefait one can at present only conjecture. He seems to have absorbed these poems well enough to create the Nonnes Preestes Tale without reopening the books. Their many similarities of phrase and action provided Chaucer's mind with a multitude of associative links like those discussed by Jobn Livingston Lowes in The Road to Xanadu: A Study in the Ways of the Imagination (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1927) in connection with the composition of The Parlement of Foules (pp. 43-44), The Ancient Mariner, and Kubla Khan (see, for example, chapters III, "The Deep Well," tnd XVIII, "The Hooked Atoms"). Thus various materials - sometimes unpromising - episodes, phrases, traits of character, and little details, from the three Old French versions of the fox and cock story, were assimilated, transformed, and reorganized; the story was recreated with brilliant narrative skill, and shaped in part under the influence of the anthropomorphism and mock-heroics of the Roman de Renart, the learning and historical background of Renart le Contrefait, and the auctorial comments of each. Renart le Contrefait offered so much to Chaucer that one may even speculate whether the self-portrait of this unknown clerc de Troyes, who had been obliged to renounce the priesthood because of concubinage or "bigame," this misogynist, this satirist of religious, may not have stood as model for a feature or two in Chaucer's portraiture of his antifeminist priest, teased by Herry Bailey not as bigamist nor even as octogamist, but as potential polygamist with paramours 37 Warnke glosses "philosophie" as "moralische Lehre" and "essample" as "Moral einer Fabel."</page><page sequence="23">668 The Nonnes Preestes Tale (Part II) "moo than seven tymes seventene" - "This sweete preest, this goodly man sir John." The Host, at the last, said to his other priest, the PaTrisshe Prest, "Telle us a fable anon, for cokkes bones !" Did he desire yet another "folye, / As of a fox, or of a cok and hen"? But the Parisshe Prest would not offer "swich wrecchednesse," would not "sowen draf out of [his] fest," promising instead "Moralitee and ver- tuous mateere" - something which he had failed to find either in the fable of the Nonnes Preest or in the accompanying extravagances of exemplum, descrip- tion, amplification, and auctorial comment, which are the vehicle of the poet's parody and satire, and of his insights into the human condition and the divine plan.
