<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Nature's Nation to Shamu on a Stick BRIAN BLACK Skidmore College Spectacular Nature: Corporate Culture and the Sea World Experience. By Susan G. Davis, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997. 313 pages. $18.95. THE CROWD GASPS IN ORCHESTRATED AMAZEMENT. THE MASSIVE MAMMAL leaps out of the water-filled tank to expose its breadth. Throughout the performance, Shamu demonstrates the cetacean's immense power, but also something more. Suddenly, the orca bursts from the water again, yet this time not upward but outward-out of the water and on to land. The flukes of the whale seem to grasp the edge of the stage, holding Shamu, back arched and tail pointing to the sky, outside of the tank and within the audience. "Something more" is revealed: Shamu lay prone like the extended hand of the marine world, inviting us land-lubbers to know more of the area composing 90 percent of Earth's surface environment. Susan G. Davis writes, "As the tidal zone is a margin between life on land and in the sea, whales and their kin, as mammals, occupy similar liminal space between humans and the living ocean" (9). Davis's Spectacular Nature: Corporate Culture and the Sea World Experience mixes cultural theory, material cultural analysis, and cultural anthropology to analyze Sea World's effort to create a "spectacular story about nature in general and oceans in particular" (9). This is a story of connections with nature, some contrived, some genuine, but each inveter- ate. The analysis is based in theories of Raymond Williams, particularly his declaration that humans are hopelessly intertwined with their environ- ment. There can be no distinguishing what is natural and human, he writes, "we have mixed our labour with the earth, our forces with its forces, too Brian Black is a specialist in environmental and landscape history who teaches American studies at Skidmore College.

If we attempt to "go on with singular abstractions," Williams argues, we can never compre- hend the complex relationship of humans and nature. The goal, then, is to excavate this complexity within forms of our vernacular, everyday culture. Davis offers Sea World as a representation of this contemporary relation- ship in all of its complexity and confusion. Access to the inner-workings of San Diego's Sea World Park allows Davis to piece together the corporate agenda that lay beneath a veneer of teal and yellow. She captures the entire discursive exchange by interview- ing trainers, executives, and park workers while also observing school groups and other visitors. Davis's efforts fully deconstruct the Sea World experience, for the most part leaving it exposed as a superficial effort to use nature for corporate profit. This revelation proves to be a backdrop for a much more complicated and intricate interaction between contemporary humans and the natural environment-as does Sea World itself. Aside from using Williams's models, Davis seems to resist larger implications in order to focus on the microscopic analysis of consumptive entertainment. A scholar in American studies and communications who teaches at University of California-San Diego, Davis connects Sea World to a long line of theme parks and other attractions designed to thrill and intrigue the American consumer. She ties her work to that of John Kasson, Roy Rosenzweig, Kathy Peiss, Robert Rydell, Judith Adams, and others, while suggesting that Sea World's bizarre popularity reveals a great deal of what appeals to the contemporary American consumer.2 Davis seeks not to trace this spectacle within a progression of nature's importance in American life; instead she exclusively stresses its connec- tion to the amusement industry. This is unfortunate because her work suggests the next stage for American studies' inquiry into the role of nature and the environment in American life. The cultural interest in the natural environment has grown so pronounced in contemporary American society that corporations create products such as Sea World to profitably package environmentalism. Davis's fascinating and polished analysis presents Sea World's appeal as evidence that Americans have become content with a processed, artificial representation of natural forms. Davis estimates that the four Sea Worlds in North America, owned and operated by beverage and food giant Anheuser-Busch, entertain 11.6 million paying visitors per year (27). Unlike the amusement theme parks with which it competes, Sea World fuels visitor consumption through education, spectacle, and science surrounding a fairly specific theme.</page><page sequence="3">214 AMERICAN QUARTERLY While continuing Disney's "concept of the 'themed environment,' the fully designed, highly coordinated 'land' with all services, performances, and concessions designed and provided in-house," Sea World limits the form to the marine environment and bases the entire experience not around technological thrills, but the demonstration of natural wonder in animal/ mammal performance (25-26).3 Shamu's wondrous display of natural power and the anthropomorphism of the crafty or clumsy seals, Clyde and Seamore, afford Sea World mass appeal, while the educational tanks, displays, and demonstrations allow the park to appear sensitive to nature, despite the training of captive performers (31). Davis uses this appearance of sensitivity to include Sea World in the general tradition of nature appreciation in America, while admitting that the park will never be confused with trails through the Sierras. Yet her disclaimer need to go one step further. More precisely, Sea World operates within a branch of environmentalism that has always placed humans firmly in control of nature. Davis's service to environmental history here is to include such an unnatural site in the paradigm at all. This inclusion can be instructive to environmental historians, many of whom fail to fully consider the construction of the cultural landscape, particularly in contem- porary America. American studies has a long history of inquiry into the relationship between Americans and nature, and Davis's work offers to bring this into the postmodern era.4 Perry Miller and Roderick Nash long ago established that nature has played a crucial role in the definition of American identity." "Nature's Nation" came to mean both a trust in human reason and a unique reliance on the natural environment for more than necessary resources.6 Leo Marx then established an enduring paradigm that stages the construction of American identity within variations in ideals of civilization and nature.7 Historians of environmentalism use this concept to suggest that the modem environmental movement embodies Marx's quest for a "middle land- scape," a reconciled balance.8 Donald Worster, a pioneer in environmental history with roots in American studies, refers to environmentalism as "that peculiar search for national atonement."9 With such a legacy in mind, Davis's book takes on additional meaning; however, it continues to oversimplify the issue to say, as Davis does, that this search runs directly through Shamu's tank. Instead, it may be more precise to view the marine theme park as an extension of nature's presence in American life through green consumerism. Less a full-blown stop on the intellectual development of environmentalism, Sea World clings with only</page><page sequence="4">SHAMU ON A STICK 215 convenient ties to environmental concern in America. It resembles a parasite; however it has yet to be seen whether its effects will be positive or negative. While it broadens public awareness, it might also dilute the morality many environmentalists place at the movement's heart. While "Shamu on a Stick" (a popsicle shaped like the performing whale) is thoroughly unnatural, this commodity continues the American quest to reconnect itself to natural roots. This type of nature presentation has been a component of American environmentalism since the late 1700s. It can be traced to Charles Wilson Peale's Natural History Museum (founded 1784), the excavation and exhibition of a North American mastodon skeleton by Peale in 1801, and Thomas Jefferson's Natural Bridge attraction (one of the nation's first tourist sites).10 The artistic/ ornithological work of Alexander Wilson and John James Audubon then connects the early nineteenth century to the origins of the conservation movement and hunter/outdoorsmen such as George Bird Grinell, who founded the Audubon Society in 1886. The created landscape itself also became a representation of this sensibility after 1820 when Andrew Jackson Downing, Frederick Law Olmsted, and others connected the carefully-sculpted rural cemetery form to both suburban homes and urban parks. Landscape and cultural historians have begun to study nineteenth- century landscape architecture with a clear eye toward including unnatural forms as part of the environmental movement. In an essay on Olmsted, landscape architect Anne Whitson Spirn writes, "Calling some landscapes 'natural' and others 'artificial' or 'cultural' ignores the fact that landscapes are never wholly one or the other.""11 While it does not argue this point, David Schuyler's recent Apostle of Taste: Andrew Jackson Downing, 1815-1852 provides dramatic evidence that an environmental sensibility was marketed during the mid-19th century. Such public interest in having an organic park or a sculpted natural setting surrounding one's rural or suburban home easily connects to purchasing popsicles or souvenirs resembling a natural form such as Shamu. Nineteenth-century landscape design, which galvanized the post-bellum drive for National Parks, allows us to categorize the phenomena of Sea World within nature presentation, or viewing the unknown. Sea World can be viewed as part of the Wild Kingdom or Jacques Cousteau genre of nature-loving. This continuum of "nature appreciation" is not meant to suggest that Sea World is a type of national or natural park; however, this context enables us to see Shamu as more than a trophy-head on the wall of an exploitative nation.</page><page sequence="5">216 AMERICAN QUARTERLY Davis's superb analysis of the Sea World experience compels readers to make these broader connections. As an artificially existing zone, Sea World is constructed by human work that is controlled through research and statistics. "Everything about the park's structure," writes Davis, "is planned, based on a pool of numbers provided by customers themselves" (78). While educators and scientists with the park might try to explore what visitors actually take away from their experience, Sea World admin- istrators manage with market research as a "closed loop." The bottom line is the only criteria for content. At best, writes Davis, visitors find only a "controlled freedom" within the park (115). It may surprise visitors to realize the extent to which their experience is controlled, because the structure is designed to be unobservable. For instance, park staff uses the guise of educational programming to control visitors. The superficiality of attractions such as the "Kodak Photo Spots" (where kids can hold starfish, etc.) indicates that not only does Sea World lack a true interest in educating its visitors but that it is willing to use such a guise to organize, stagger, and limit visits. A basic portion of this contrived educational initiative is environmental, intended to provide Sea World with the feel of a laboratory offering visitors unique access to another world through science. Marketing becomes a major component of such initiatives in the form of classroom outreach programs throughout the San Diego region and Shamu TV, which was launched nationally in 1994. "Like the education department itself and many of its activities," writes Davis, "Shamu TV was proposed by the marketing department" (137). These satellite initiatives seek to spur visitation and entice tourists to visit Anheuser-Busch's landscape of consumption. The amusement park business has become a huge money-maker since 1960, growing from a $100 million industry to an annual $4 billion enterprise in 1990.12 "As a piece of industrial magic," writes Davis, "Sea World represents an enormous contradiction. Using living animals, captive seas, and flourish- ing landscapes, the theme park has organized the subtle and contradictory cultural meanings of nature into a machine for mass consumption" (30). Due to its use of environmentalism to appeal to tourists, Sea World's promotions make less effort to conceal the image they are packaging than most amusement parks. Indeed, Sea World performs as a figurehead of green consumerism. "Sea World," Davis writes, "is not so much a substitute for nature as an opinion about it, an attempt to convince a broad public that nature is going to be all right" (242). The irony of this image, of course, is drawn viciously by the excesses of theme park culture, Anheuser-</page><page sequence="6">SHAMU ON A STICK 217 Busch's ownership of the park, the artificiality of the surrounding environ- ment, and the use of captured, incarcerate animals and mammals. The rest of Davis's analysis functions as material research to illuminate Sea World's unique fashion of attracting consumers. A cross between "a circus, an aquarium, and a botanical garden," Sea World differs from nearly all competing amusement parks (152). Shamu, and not a grand, looping roller coaster, functions as the park's gate attraction and other performances supplement the whale's half-hour show. The coordination of scheduling and the layout of attractions stimulate the knowledge, physical activity, and consumption that enhances the performance experience. Davis provides a succinct history of trained orca performances, begin- ning at Sea World in 1965. While these shows are the cornerstone of each Sea World, the high cost of maintaining and training whales, more than any other variable, has forced corporate ownership. In the aptly titled chapter "Routine Surprises," Davis interviews trainers and administrators who reveal that the mammals' actions are never certain, making the overall theme the show's only structure. The current tone of the performance (Davis discusses variations during the years of her data collection) merges environmental politics, science, and childhood entertainment in order to construct a spectacle of mass appeal. The animal's body and abilities become important components of this appeal. Again, trainers apply biological understanding to achieve marketing solutions. While the orca possesses raw power that can be cued for awe-inspiring impact, it also is capable of being "animated" with a personality. Like other economic devices, Sea World has attempted to systematize this entertainment process. While this is difficult when including animals/ mammals, it has become more important with the simultaneous operation of multiple Sea Worlds. This necessitated that Sea World create a template for Shamu's personality-varying by degree between killer-predator and cuddly-panda. The killer whale or orca thereby functions as a dual force "balanced or alternating between fearsome power and delicate gentleness" (184). Shamu's form becomes an illustration of the broader relationship with nature that Sea World attempts to fill. Nature, albeit artificially staged and constructed, can be friendly or dangerous and therefore demands human understanding and respect. The scene sounds startlingly similar to Marx's middle landscape. Davis's discussion of these performances is more observational than theoretical.13 She excerpts field notes taken during years of attending Shamu's shows in order to deconstruct larger meanings she has investi-</page><page sequence="7">218 AMERICAN QUARTERLY gated through interviews. The deconstruction functions well, although little new information is revealed. The specific descriptions of the spec- tacle might be used more effectively if less confined to these latter portions of the text. As structured, these field notes simply reiterate her overall point that the Shamu show is "routinized magic" based in human awe of natural forces (199). The performance involves humans vicariously through audience participation, the rousing of collective emotions such as fear and compassion, and, of course, getting dowsed by Shamu's belly flop. The latter seems to function as a baptismal-connection to the natural environ- ment that Sea World wishes to represent. "What is Shamu?" Davis asks rhetorically of the whale that is simulta- neously "transcendent being and a souvenir" (223). It is a creation of our collective aspirations passed through the sieve of the consumptive market. Americans long to be connected to nature. Such aspirations have become more acute as they have been thwarted by the age of technology and asphalt. The danger inherent in this frustrated search for nature, suggests Davis, is that we have become content with a false version of it. While we must locate our own longings in our melting Shamu popsicle, we need to also recognize the economic motives behind its presentation. Davis's analysis allows us to perceive the dual reality of Sea World and to begin to transcend its artificiality. The tone of Susan Davis's account is intensely personal. She treats this story as a tale of discovery and spends the bulk of the introduction chronicling her own intellectual change and growth with the topic. While such a tone can seem tiring initially, in conclusion the reader sees it as the author's device to lead us in the path of Raymond Williams: to see oddity in what we might first consider normal. Spectacular Nature can be placed with the best work that Cultural and American studies has to offer: using the disciplined view of a well-trained folklorist, Davis analyzes a contem- porary phenomena with depth and understanding. She discloses a broader meaning that contains continuity and discontinuity with historical mod- els-it authenticates a well-known American urge while also updating it. While Davis stops short of placing her topic in the larger canon of America's relationship with nature, we can view her Sea World as a suggestion for additional work in American studies. The time is ripe for American studies to inquire carefully of the rapid change currently going on within the human/nature relationship. While our physical distance from nature grows, we have begun also to loosen our definitions of what constitutes naturalness or wildness. The willingness of</page><page sequence="8">SHAMU ON A STICK 219 Williams and others to explore these conceptual changes allows us to recover a construction such as Sea World and to position it correctly within the environmental paradigm. No field can more effectively analyze these cultural constructions than American studies. Eventually, such inquiry will allow us to properly perceive the continuity between "Nature's Nation" and Shamu on a stick.

Sea World obviously bears a great resemblance and debt to the culture of Disney's creations. The main argument of this essay distinguishes such sites by focusing on the ethical concern that Sea World hopes to market to visitors. There are many excellent sources on the construction of consumptive landscapes in the model of Disney. See, for instance: John M. Findlay, Magic Lands: Western Cityscapes and American Culture after 1940 (Berkeley, Calif., 1992); Alexander Wilson, The Culture of Nature: North American Landscape from Disney to the Exxon Valdez (Cambridge, 1992); and Henry Giroux, "Beyond the Politics of Innocence: Memory and Pedagogy in the 'Wonderful World of Disney,'" Socialist Review 23 (1993): 79-107. 4.
