<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> The World of Wolves: Lessons about the  Sacredness of the Surround, Belonging,  the Silent Dialogue of Interdependence  and Death, and Speciocide Glen Mazis School of Humanities, Penn State Harrisburg, 777 West Harrisburg Pike, Middletown, PA 17057; glen.mazis@comcast.net This essay details wolves sense of their surround in terms of how wolves  perceptual acuities, motor abilities, daily habits, overriding concerns,  network of intimate social bonds, and relationship to prey give them  a unique sense of space, time, belonging with other wolves, memorial  sense, imaginative capacities, dominant emotions (of affection, play,  loyalty, hunger, etc.), communicative avenues, partnership with other  creatures, and key role in ecological thriving. Wolves are seen to live  within a vast sense of aroundness and closeness to aspects of their sur- round (compared to humans), a highly charged intimacy and coopera- tion with other wolves, and a caring and non-aggressive attitude that  goes beyond the pack, despite their loyalty and defense of territory. The  cultural myths and history that absurdly demonize the wolf are explored  in their self-righteous attempts to exterminate wolves, which I call “spe- ciocide” and probe for projections of human viciousness. The supposed  rapaciousness of wolves is re-examined by expanding Barry Lopez’s  sense of the silent dialogue of death with other creatures to be reconsid- ered as a kind of respect, assertion of vitality, recognition of mortality,  and cooperation. I. Entering the World of Wolves A wolf might cock its ears to hearken to the far distant sound of another pack of  wolves, gathered for a few minutes of howling together into the winds beneath  the gathering black sky of early night in their moments of joining side by side  before dispersing for a night of hunting. The wolf might even hear them from  across several valleys and forest stands.1 The distant singing—and it can be  rightly called song in its haunting, dynamic flow of differing notes—might  1� Robert H� Busch, The Wolf Almanac: A Celebration of Wolves and Their World, New  and Revised (Guilford: The Lyons Press, 2007), 15–16.

Although wolves have vision comparable  to humans, their peripheral vision and ability to detect motion is more acute,  and their night vision is far superior, given that they have a ninety-five per cent  ratio of retinal rods to cones (Busch, 35–36)� Their sense of the “around world”  (the scope of things and events to which they are related), even at night, would  move towards distant horizons of detecting motion, smells, and sounds. If we  begin to conceive of them through the unity of perceptual body and surround  suggested by the work of Merleau-Ponty on human perception and its over- laps with animality (and according to other phenomenological perspectives  and even Buddhist and Taoist perspectives), this “greater body” would extend  in its reverberations over a vast area.  Indeed, what seems most common to humans and animals is that our bod- ies are ways into the world, enmeshed with others of our species and other  species, and that embodiment means to be interwoven with a surround, wheth- er human or animal� As Merleau-Ponty compellingly articulated the body as  “lived body,” as a portion of the fabric of the world, but one that is torn away  from seamlessness with it, it is inseparably a part and yet is at a distance� Per- ceiving is not a sensing across a chasm, but is rather a “certain possession of  least sixteen times better than humans and can hear as far as six miles away in the forest  and ten miles on the open tundra� 2� Farley Mowat, Never Cry Wolf: The Amazing True Story of Life Among Artic Wolves  (New York; Little, Brown and Company, 1963), 130–2.

Their landscapes interweave, their actions and passions fit to- gether exactly: this is possible as soon as we no longer make belongingness  to one same ‘consciousness’ the primordial definition of sensibility, and as  soon as we rather understand it as the return of the visible upon itself, a car- nal adherence of the sentient to the sensed and of the sensed to the sentient�  (Visible, 142)  If the human sense of ourselves comes back to us from perceptual vectors  emerging from the world, instead of emanating from a central source called  “consciousness,” then there can be a folding over and enfolding among species  of animals, including the human and animal�  An analogous kind of being immersed in the surround and yet having a  certain distance from it can be seen in the idea of the animal’s Umwelt first  articulated by Jakob von Uexküll, the founder of ethology. For Uexküll, the or- ganism was not separable from its “around world,” its environs. Von Uexküll’s  idea of the Umwelt as interpreted by Merleau-Ponty (which differs from Heide- gger’s8) allows us to see that, in animals with more developed nervous systems,  there is a behavioral grasp of the world, “an opening” to the surround.9 Mer- leau-Ponty means that the animal is not seamlessly immersed in the surround,  driven by its forces, but that the developed system of apprehension gives it a  6� Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception, trans� Colin Smith (London: Rout- ledge and Kegan Paul, 1962), 250� 7� Maurice Merleau-Ponty, The Visible and the Invisible, trans.

In these animals  such as wolves, the Umwelt allows a back and forth, a responsiveness and a  meshing such that “the world is possessed by the animal�” The animal has a  keen sense of some aspects of the surround, as if they are “distilled” by the  animal’s sensing, which in “differentiating sensorial givens, can respond to  them by fine actions” (Nature, 171)� The smell of moose or the motion of mice  have a perceptual intensity for the wolf that we cannot experience as humans.  They respond to beckonings more intensely. Yet, in being open to the surround  as from within an enlarged body, human and animal overlap (in what Merleau- Ponty called “interanimality”). However, the animal opens its own “field of ac- tion,” with “its specific temporality and spatiality” that differs from the human  (Nature, 173)� As we are with other humans but more radically, we are open  together to the surround and its ways of being registered in sensibility, yielding  overlapping dimensions, and yet there are important differences in sensibility.  For humans, within the depth of perception, the senses are inseparably meshed  with not only emotion, memory and imagination, which have analogous di- mensions in animals, but also with conceptual, linguistic, and abstract articu- lations, yielding a different matrix. Human and animal fields of action share  some imperatives and also differ widely. For the wolf, who hears and smells over great distances and has peripheral  vision with a hair-trigger sensitivity enfolding its more central visual focus, we  can only imagine being immersed in an expansiveness of emplacement and a  closeness of the far that dwarfs the human sensorial register� If animal is an- chored in what it perceives as also being a perspective on itself in the dynamics  of perception as articulated by Merleau-Ponty, its body returns to itself from  far-flung places. The banks of the river far upstream and the edge of the forest  downwind an hours trot away must have the feel of being under its skin and  in its nostrils and heard within the spine in a way humans might feel about the  rather small expanse of the size of their yard where we might lie in a hammock  or the becoming permeated by the sensed clearing in the woods in which we  have stopped to rest, or maybe about the room upstairs where I hear my spouse  stirring or smell cooking from the kitchen. Bachelard’s “murmurings among  things” would be for wolves a vast chorus stretching outward. Barry Lopez,  who has observed wolves and integrated the known facts about wolves, shares  with his reader an imagined trek of the wolf in the late afternoon:  He moves along now at the edge of a clearing. The wind coming down-valley  surrounds him with a river of odors, as if he were a migrating salmon. He can  smell ptarmigan and deer droppings� He can smell willow and spruce and the  fading sweetness of fireweed. Above, he sees a hawk circling, and farther  south, lower on the horizon, a flock of sharp-tailed sparrows going east. He  senses through his pads with each step the dryness of the moss beneath his  feet, and the ridges of old tracks, some of his own. He hears the sound his  </page> <page sequence="5"> tHe World of Wolves 73 feet make. He hears the occasional movement of deer mice and voles. Sum- mer food�10 In an opening through the smell of things—logs, scat, flowers, ravens—and  the resounding of the heard—mice rustling, brooks gurgling, the muted pads of  other members of the pack—within its resonating body, the surround of many  miles moves through the wolf as notes in a melody of its own felt sense of its  unfurling life in the cool, dappled afternoon light� This formulation echoes the  phrase that Merleau-Ponty finds most telling in von Uexküll’s idea of the Um- welt when von Uexküll refers to “the unfurling of an Umwelt as a melody that  is singing itself” (Nature, 173). This singing for either wolf or human takes up  the songs of the surround, but the wolf hearkens with a sensitivity that stems  from the acuity of its immersion in the prereflective. This breadth of the lived surround felt as sinews of the body and as sens- ing, expressive filaments running through the myriad beings of the surround  into which one is woven would also be traced in the wolves’ kinesthetic sense.  The human sense of world stems from our kinesthetic paths we inscribe around  us, and so it should also be for wolves in our “Ineinander with animality” in  which perceptual structures are a “being before reason, [in which] humanity  is another corporeity” (Nature, 208)� As Erwin Straus stated in The Primary  World of the Senses, “Just as sight, hearing, touch, and taste are interrelated,  so is sensing as bound in an inner connection to vital, living movement.”11  The way we move through the world structures the way the world means, and  the wolf is always on the move. As David Mech states, “There are few other  mammals that on a day to day basis roam as widely as the wolf�” Accord- ing to an old Russian proverb that Mech quotes “the wolf is kept fed by his  feet” (Mech, 149)� The wolf is able to trot at a rapid clip in a manner which is  fairly effortless, and it can be sustained hour after hour, at a pace of five miles  per hour (Busch, 71). The northern wolves who live on tundra where prey is  spread out will typically roam twenty miles from the pack and then return in a  night’s hunting for a 40 mile daily jaunt (Mech, 150). Even in the more south- ern forested locales where prey is more concentrated, a wolf will typically  travel fifteen to thirty miles per day (Mech, 160). It is estimated that wolves  spend at least eight to ten hours per day on the move (Lopez, 25). When the  entire pack is on the move in the winter, they will also typically cover twenty  miles per day� As Robert Busch puts it, “the wolf is made for running” (Busch,  71). When pursuing their prey, they can run at least at twenty-five miles per  10� Barry Holstun Lopez, Of Wolves and Men (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons,  1978), 11� 11� Erwin Straus, The Primary World of the Senses (Toronto: Collier-Macmillan Co�,  1963), 233, or as Merleau-Ponty put it, our bodies being “our general medium for hav- ing a world,” a “motor space” is more than the place through which we move, but rather  “through the study of motility is a new meaning of the word ‘meaning’ (Phenomenol- ogy, 144, 146)� </page> <page sequence="6"> 74 glen mazis hour if not more, and although the chase usually is a series of these sprints, if  necessary it can be kept up for miles (Busch, 72). With these creatures who are  active all day and night, except when in the summer the heat makes them less  active, and are always on the move, it should not be a surprise that their home  ranges—the square miles about which they typically wander—can range from  a lowest size of twenty square miles in a tightly forested area to more than a  thousand square mile area in the tundra region (Mech, 86). If the wolves have  a sense of having inscribed upon the surround the sense of their movement,  then again we find them having a sense of interconnection with a spread out  spatiality�12 The wolf has this enormous expanse for its “lived body” as incor- porating its surround taken in through both the senses and its motility, a space  of trotting flow, dynamism, and variegated in myriad ways. The wolf also sleeps upon the earth. They have an underfur, besides the fur  that is more apparent, that makes it possible for them to be insulated at temper- atures that many animals could not endure (Mech, 17)� They sleep on the snow  at 40 degrees below zero without any shelter either around them or covering  them, and seeming to relish the cold. The pack lies in a group spread across the  landscape� The Dutchers would watch them at these temperatures “curled up in  the snow with noses tucked on their tails, they slept comfortably” (Dutcher and  Dutcher, 20). Even though the heat does make them more uncomfortable, they  still find an open spot and lie upon the ground, spread out a few yards from  each other, upon the earth (Dutcher and Dutcher, 106)� This literal resting upon  the open ground each night, their sinews and weight letting go into the earth,  would allow them the sense of being immersed in the surround as in a rhythmic  fusion with its seasons and changes� I wanted to open this meditation with the reader gaining a sense of some  specifics of the perceptual or “lived world” of wolves, with imagined sensorial  brushings of that world upon the reader’s body, before framing conceptually  how one might be able to enter the life-world of the wolf and what that might  mean. I agree with Marc Bekoff’s approach in Minding Animals that he calls  “deep ethology” and its practice: “As a deep ethologist, following the tradition  of ecopsychology, I as the ‘seer,’ try to become the ‘seen.’ I try to step into  animals’ sensory and locomotor worlds to discover what it might be like to be  12. It is true that humans in the twenty-first century do have a lived sense of spatiality  that may include cities in Europe, Asia, and South America, as part of the sense of a  North American’s surround, or of tropical rain forests in Costa Rica and deserts in the  Middle East, since we jet about the planet. However, these lines of felt interconnection  are weaker, vaguer and fit into my sense of “around space” with puzzling gaps and  disjunctions, given that we haven’t moved among these spaces in a directly embodied  way, but were miraculously “plunked down” after encasement in a distancing machine  that moves through the skies in Zenoian detachment and displacement. The paths we  walk and run every day are etched in our felt sense of the surround in another, more  deeply felt way� </page> <page sequence="7"> tHe World of Wolves 75 a given individual, how they sense their surroundings, and how they behave  and move about in certain situations” (Bekoff, 11). Given the Merleau-Pontian  notion of reversibility, we know that part of our everyday perception is the  perception from the vantage of the trees around us or the birds above us, or  more relevant to this essay, a resonance to the wolves distantly fleeing about  us—seeing, hearing, smelling, and otherwise sensing in a way as if from their  perspectives, not as clearly, not nearly as forcefully as our human and cultural  ways, but as echoes and reverberations within our perception. It is the tracings  of these reverberations within the perceptual matrix of the world that can give  us an access point to the experience of wolves. Bekoff’s approach and marvel- ous descriptions are at odds with the ontological perspective of ethology that  still thinks in objective categories, but given the ontology of Merleau-Ponty,  make sense within a non-dualistic framework. I will endeavor in this essay to  provide this framework in drawing upon the ethologists’ and other scientists’  insights into the physical capacities, the sensual realm, the affective life, the  social structures, the behavior, and the history of the human involvement with  wolves.  Any philosopher, psychologist, ethologist or other thinker who endeavors  to articulate the experience of wolves or other animals runs into the objections  of many scientists, philosophers, and others within our culture that such expe- rience is not accessible to humans and any attempt to describe it is just a pro- jection of human ways of experiencing onto the animal in question, so-called  “anthromorphizing.” In the confines of this essay, I would rather give a descrip- tion of the wolves’ world and not just another lengthy argument against this  charge of “anthropomorphizing�”13 Instead, I would like to suggest that these  objections to any possibility of describing animal experience are what Bekoff  labels (taking the term from Frans de Waal) as “anthropodenial.” It is one of  my underlying purposes in writing this essay to have you, the reader, consider  whether “anthropodenial”—as the cutting off of a palpable interconnection  with other species—has not been very destructive to the lives of animals and  allowed humans to unleash their “shadow side” upon them—in the Jungian  13. I am assuming in this essay that we not only have access to animal worlds through  perceptual depths, but can use a sense of Bachelard’s “material imagination” that is  productive, moving beyond one’s past experience, to poetically and sensorially sound  the given facts of a situation for their reverberations that give new insights. This is in  distinction to famous arguments like Thomas Nagel’s essay of 1974, “What Is It Like  to Be a Bat?” that have fueled skeptics who think only categorical reason can bridge  the gap with animal’s experience, an impossibility since what makes an animal’s per- spective unique are aspects outside of universal rational categories and who think that  imagination can only be “reproductive,” recombining what we have already ourselves  experienced. For a lengthy discussion of these issues, see chapter six of my book, Hu- mans, Animals, Machines: Blurring Boundarie, 69–82.  </page> <page sequence="8"> 76 glen mazis sense of those characteristics in us with which we refuse to identify, that we  project onto others, and that then enact in supposed “response” to them�  If we are of the flesh of the world, then our interconnection with other  species is part of the depth of our perception, and anthropodenial is the detach- ing from part of our own perceptual emplacement in the world. We might see  that this detachment is a grave matter that has led to horrific violence in what I  would like to call “speciocide,” the massacre of various species. I have coined  this term “speciocide,” because genocide refers to the massacre of a family,  tribe, or race (génos), whereas as we will see with wolves, humans have some- times seen an entire animal species as deserving to be annihilated� There is no  way to think about the lives of wolves, the nature of their experience, and the  history of their relations with humans without considering the nature of spe- ciocide in general and specifically in regard to wolves, since their vicious and  almost complete extermination is a very important and disturbing dimension of  the story of wolves and of human beings. II. The World of Wolves as the Belonging with Other Wolves and the  Natural World To enter the wolf’s world is go beyond the merely sensory feel of its surround,  for like humans, each percept is lined with an affective warp to its woof, that  also delimits those beings and objects in its surround that matter to it, that are  part of its relational map, because they are what it cares about, fears, dreads,  delights in, hungers for, seeks reassurance from; they offer comfort, provide  tranquility, or are the object of hostility or even curiosity. As Mark Bekoff, who  as an ethologist demands stringent evidence for such assertions, says in his  book Minding Animals of his work with wolves, coyotes, primates, and other  species of mammals: “The emotional states of many animals, especially mam- mals, are easily recognizable” (Bekoff, 105). Anyone can have a sense of their  emotions by inferring from the shape of their face, its expressions, eye move- ment and size, muscle tone, posture, gait, vocalizations, gaze quality, and other  gestures, Bekoff comments. This reminds us of Merleau-Ponty’s statement  about emotion as constitutive of being-in-the-world with the exception that  Merleau-Ponty feels these emotions are not inferred but directly perceived:  Since emotion is not a psychic, internal fact but rather a variation in our re- lations with others and the world which is expressed in our bodily attitude,  we cannot say that only the signs of love or anger are given to the outside  observer and that we understand others indirectly by interpreting these signs:  we have to say they are directly manifest to us as behavior.14  If we are of the flesh of the world and emotions are relational ties among its  beings, effulgent within our postures, gestures, tone of vocalizations, and so  14� Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Sense and Nonsense, trans� Hubert and Patricia Dreyfus  (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1964), 53. </page> <page sequence="9"> tHe World of Wolves 77 forth, then within our own embodiment is a sense of others’ bonds with the  world, both human and animal�  The affective world of wolves has seemed apparent to scientific observ- ers� According to the testimony of the famous naturalist, Adolf Murie, who  spent long periods observing wild wolves in Alaska: “The strongest impression  remaining with me after watching wolves on numerous occasions was their  friendliness� The adults were friendly towards each other, and were amiable to- ward the pups” (Mech, 4). This assessment is echoed by David Mech, foremost  authority concerning wolves, who reports that “Probably the creature’s stron- gest personality trait is its capacity for making emotional attachments to other  individuals” (Mech, 4). Indeed, Robert Busch, in explaining how vital a sense  of belonging through emotional affection is to wolves’ well-being, cites wolf  biologist John Theberge, according to whom “their social bonding and care- giving behavior are second only to those of humans and other social primates”  (Busch, 47). To fathom the world of wolves is to explore how these deep bonds  are manifest and how they structure its sense of the surround� In contradistinc- tion to those who cry “anthropomorphism” when we describe animal emotion,  if we have an immediate prereflective apprehension of the sense of these ges- tures, then we are actively denying what we know, actively cutting off inter- species ties that reverberate with us, by raising this seemingly sober, “rational”  objection—hence the justification for de Waal’s term, “anthropodenial.”  When we see that wolves remain in packs of usually around seven or  eight wolves, and that the so-called “lone wolf” is the case in only about 15%  of wolves observed, we are led to believe that being part of a pack is vital to  wolves (Busch, 55). When the Dutchers suggest that wolves that are not part  of a pack should rather be called “dispersers,” because for some reason they  have been driven out of a pack to seek a mate, for lack of food, or from some  discord, have been dispersed and expend their energy to find or start another  pack, and do not thrive on their own, maybe we can trust our apprehension of  the wolves’ affective relations.15 It is true that as an animal that weighs about  95–100 pounds for males or 80–85 pounds for females and measures from  5–6�5 feet from nose to tail tip for males and from 4�5–6�0 feet from nose to  tail tip for females, trying to take down a bull moose that weighs 1250 pounds  or even a cow moose at 850 pounds or an average white-tailed deer buck of  240 pounds or a caribou of an average 300 pounds, it is a “survival strategy of  sustaining each individual by performing as a team” (Mech, 11, 205, 220, 228;  Dutcher and Dutcher, 58). Wolves are the top predator in many food chains and  being the only animals in North America that hunt as a team makes this possi- ble (Dutcher and Dutcher, 80). However, this practical advantage does not ne- gate the fact that “when they reunite, their tails wagging loosely to-and-fro and  individuals whine and jump about” (Bekoff, 109). They lick each others, faces,  15� Jim and Jamie Dutcher, Living with Wolves (Seattle: The Mountaineers Books,  2005), 60�  </page> <page sequence="10"> 78 glen mazis hug each other, nuzzle, and wag. Nor does the practical advantage explain why  when an older pack member broke its jaw, others brought it regurgitated food  until it was healed (Dutcher and Dutcher, 104), or why pack members brought  an arthritic wolf food, waited periodically for an injured member even when  in the midst of a hunt, or feed old wolves (Busch, 53). The best explanation as  Mech puts it is that the pack is held together by “affectional ties” (Mech, 46);  or the Dutchers put it, after living for six years in an enclosed tract of wilder- ness area in a tent observing a wolf pack, “Wolves develop trust in one another  from lifelong bonds that reinforce a sense that they belong to a particular fam- ily and a specific pack” (Dutcher and Dutcher, 58). Wolves care about each  other, trust each other, and thrive with a sense of belonging. No doubt, these  are the traits we see in our dogs, who are descended from the first wolves to  cohabit with humans twelve thousand years ago (Mech, 29). A wolf belongs to an extended family group of a breeding pair, their off- spring, perhaps another generation of offspring, and another wolf or two. When  members are gone from the pack, especially for an extended time, other mem- bers have been observed pacing agitatedly until they return. A death is felt as  a loss to all of them, as the following story told by Jamie Dutcher attests when  one of the females of the pack died, having been killed by a mountain lion:  For the six weeks following her death, the pack did not play. What had been  a daily occurrence stopped altogether. When the wolves passed through the  aspen grove where she had been killed, they became quiet, their tails drooped  noticeably. When they howled, Jim noted that the sound had an eerie quality,  very different from the normal riotous pack rallies. Jim could only come to  one conclusion: the wolves were in mourning. (Dutcher and Dutcher, 104)  Mourning indicates feeling a loss, and this indicates the web of wolf feelings  of closeness, concern, loyalty, and belonging� Unlike the sometimes grim picture of wolves portrayed in traditional Eu- ropean tales, a significant portion of their time is the fun-filled, exciting time  of play� Not only do the pups continually play with one another and with the  adults who keep watch over them, but as the Dutchers put it, “Play is a crucial  component of every stage of a wolf’s life” (Dutcher and Dutcher, 88). During  the day, the pack can be seen wrestling, chasing each other, jaw sparring, am- bushing sleepy members, chewing on each other, and immersed in a medium  of “snarls and nips, running and chasing, flipping and rolling” (Dutcher and  Dutcher, 88). Despite the often-invoked “scientific framework” of seeing ani- mals as driven by survival and practical exigency, the day-to-day existence of  wolves differs from that vision: “Wolves love to play, shouldering one another,  bumping bodies together, flopping tails over each other’s backs, and leaping  up and placing forepaws around others’ necks” (Busch, 74). This is an activity  entered by the wolves after communicating their wish, signaled by “dropping  front legs into a crouch position, with smiling face and wagging tail,” with  the result that “adults stage mock fights, play chase, and leap on each other’  (Busch, 74) The favorite game of ambushing unwary members seems akin to  </page> <page sequence="11"> tHe World of Wolves 79 what humans would call a joke. This leads an observer to comment that, “Play  to a wolf . . . is not merely important as a training and regulatory device; it  also exemplifies the sense of humor that makes it possible for there to be an  identification with man and vice versa.” We know how dogs seem to almost  laugh when romping with each other or with humans, perhaps spinning wildly,  pretending to attack, or ambushing us, and this is a trait that also must come  from wolves.  Play not only binds wolves to each other, but with the surround. Another  observer notes the play spirit is so irrepressible that even if no other wolf will  respond because of being tired, there are always cones to throw, leaves to run  after, or one’s own tail to chase. The natural world is a playmate: “Any event  can spark wolf play. Even falling snow can cause the pack to erupt in a spon- taneous celebratory romp� They may chase each other or nip at a tail or a rump  and they take turns being pursuer and pursued or they may just try to catch the  snowflakes” (Dutcher and Dutcher, 88). Even with another species, ravens,  wolves have been observed playing “chase,”—instigated by a raven who crept  up to the sleeping wolf, sped away, marched back and forth in front of the wolf  again, giving piercing, raucous taunts, was lunged at, escaped, and so on for  twenty minutes, until the wolf got too tired to continue (Dutcher and Dutch- er, 130–132; Busch, 68)� Not only do affectional ties deepen in play among  wolves, but with other species. The moment with which this essay began is another sort of shared excite- ment and joy, the joining together before a night’s hunt or at another time to  howl together: “like a community sing, a howl . . . is a happy social occa- sion. Wolves love a howl. When it is started, they instantly seek contact with  one another, fur to fur. Some wolves . . . will run from any distance, panting  and bright-eyed, to join in, uttering, as they near, fervent little wows, jaws  wide, hardly able to wait to sing” (Mech, 101)�These moments both indicate  the bonds among the pack and also a joyousness with the sheer being of those  things around them in the surround, whether snow, plants, feathers, having a  tail (to be chased), being able to run (in playful sprints), or being able to sing as  part of long minor, modulating chords. Akin to these feelings is the curiosity of  wolves, who have been reported, not just by Farley Mowat, to have been qui- etly observing the ethologists and wolf biologist who were searching for them  in vain (Mowat, 70–71). To be curious about other creatures, but even other  beings of all sorts within the environment, is to have a kind of lived wonder,  as demonstrated by this observation: “a black wolf stood by her first patch of  newly-opened dark-pink daisies, acquainting herself with them. She brushed  her nose across them, raised her paw and touched them� � � � A wolf’s curiosity  is impersonal� It goes beyond food and fear” (Busch, 62)� This is quite an im- age to add to our picture of the wolf, nuzzling, breathing in, and touching flow- ers with its paw. If wolves have striking vitality, awareness of their surround,  playful enjoyment of each other and the things about them, it seems plausible  </page> <page sequence="12"> 80 glen mazis that they live in some sort of immediate wonder or appreciation of the richness  of living things around them. In quieter moments, wolves groom each other, licking each other’s coats,  nibbling with teeth to get things out of the fur of the other, and in doing so ex- press affection or concern. This is also part of courtship. However, when there  is a pack member injured, then “Injured wolves are intensely groomed by other  pack members, providing both physical and mental comfort” (Busch, 75–76).  This expression of concern is part of a matrix of communication among the  members of the pack as “wolves continually communicate with each other”  (Dutcher and Dutcher, 102). Wolf communication take places in body pos- tures, tail positions, facial expressions, gestures of various sorts, continual and  varied kinds of vocalizations (like whines, barks, growls, howls, whimpers,  moans, etc�), and other ways� Jamie Dutcher categorizes a few of these in ob- serving that  When together wolves almost continuously communicate with one another  with low, faint whines� A higher pitched, longer lasting whine is used in greet- ing or when a wolf wants something it cannot obtain. Whining is also used  by submissive pack members, partnered with corresponding body posture— lowering the body and tucking in the tail—that denotes the social status.  Barking indicates that a wolf is confused, agitated, or distressed. Growls ac- company threats of challenges� (Dutcher and Dutcher, 114)  These vocalizations are often accompanied with gestures, including fine facial  ones� The wolf community is not a mechanical synchronization of isolated  units, but a group that makes its feelings, desires, fears, angers, joys, and dis- tresses known to its partners, as well as negotiating actions together, or making  invitations to others, for example, to play. The best known feature of the pack is its social order, but it is important  not to impose human structures upon it. Even though there is a “typical pack”  as we have described, the size can vary greatly given many factors such as  climate, topography, prey availability, etc. (Mech, 40). There is an organization  where one wolf, when it is vital to the pack, will decide the direction of travel,  the times to rest, whether to attack prey, how to respond to an intruder and  so forth (Dutcher and Dutcher, 73). This “alpha” wolf usually eats first when  devouring prey and is shown deference by other wolves in the pack who ap- proach it with submissive postures, such as lower tail or lowered carriage, face  licking, etc. What this means is that one wolf seems to be of a more confident  nature and has great energy, a sense of decisiveness, or one might say “the  alpha male is the most consistently highly motivated” (Dutcher and Dutcher,  74). However, it can be the case that a female wolf will be the alpha leader of a  pack (Dutcher and Dutcher, 60). The females usually have their own organiza- tion with a female alpha and beta, and the female alpha will take precedence  over the other dominant males.  </page> <page sequence="13"> tHe World of Wolves 81 However, it is also the case that any highly motivated wolf can effect be- havior of the pack and in relaxed times “pack government seems the result of  the impulses and motivation of various members” (Dutcher and Dutcher, 70).  It is also the case that “if the pack hesitates, the alpha may change direction,  etc.” (Mech, 76). It is tempting to impose human rule governing formalities  onto our idea of this fluid group of animals, but, as Barry Lopez cautions, these  are projections:  But the term alpha—evolved to describe captive animals—is still misleading.  Alpha animals do not always lead the hunt, break trail in the snow, or eat be- fore others do. An alpha male may be alpha only at certain times for a specific  reason, and, it should be noted, is alpha at the deference of other wolves in  the pack. . . . The wolf is a social animal; it depends on its survival on coop- eration, not strife. Human beings, particularly in recent years, have grown  accustomed to speaking of ‘dominance hierarchies’ in business corporations  and elsewhere, and the tendency has been to want wolf packs (or troops of  chimpanzees) to conform to similar molds� The social structure of a wolf  pack is dynamic—subject to change, especially during the breeding season— and may be completely reversed during periods of play.”16 (Lopez, 33)  The loyalty among the members of the pack, the teamwork in hunting and rais- ing the pups, marks their sense of affection. Even the so-called “omega” wolf that some observers have dubbed the  “scapegoat” of the pack is a vital member, often the wolf with the tempera- ment who instigates play among the members or is least aggressive and apt to  roll over or nuzzle and lick the others. But it may be a human projection to see  this as an abasement or hurtful position because of our sense of human ego and  self-respect� As Barry Lopez puts it, it might be less misleading to forget the  word “submission” with its human neurotic overtones and call these gestures  “‘reassurance displays’ aimed at group harmony rather than submissive whim- pering at the feet of an ogre” (Lopez, 48). The Omega wolves may be last to  eat, be the object of nipping, biting, pushing or even lose some fur to nips, but  they are usually resourceful and “seem to be born with certain timid and sub- missive qualities that make them suited to the role. Although the lowest rank,  the omega is nevertheless a solid position within the pack and so carries with  it a sense of belonging” (Dutcher and Dutcher, 64)� The wolf mentioned before  as killed by a mountain lion and the cause of such grief in the other pack mem- bers was an “omega wolf” and obviously dearly cared about and mourned.  What seems to be true of all wolves, whatever their role, is that “a wolf is lost  16. Lopez, 33. As Lopez implies in this statement, the behavior of captive wolves dif- fers from wolves living freely or “wild” in their territory. Also, Lopez goes on to warn  about misconstruing the sense of hierarchy in a pack of wolves: “To place a heavy em- phasis on such supposed facts of behavior as ‘intimidation,’ ‘pulling rank,’ and games  of psychological cruelty based on social structures is simply to confuse the tools of  human analysis with the behavior of wolves” (Lopez, 33–34). </page> <page sequence="14"> 82 glen mazis without the social context of a pack” (Dutcher and Dutcher, 60). This is not to  deny that, within the pack, there are conflicts that arise or that there may be  competition to become the new alpha when, for example, the present leader  of the pack becomes too old to effectively fulfill this role. However, as Mech  puts it, “Most conflicts, as severe as they may be, are solved through ritualis- tic threatening and fighting and only occasionally does the fighting cause any  injuries” (Mech, 70)� If only human beings could report the same about the  stability of our extended families and the resolution of conflicts within social  groups, and yet we label wolves as “savage” or even “rapacious”! Two other aspects of wolf relations deserve at least a brief description to  give a sense of their social world: breeding and raising the young pups. Wolves  are ready to breed at twenty-two months of age. Unlike many animals, the pair  have a long time of courtship, up to a year. They are often seen nuzzling, lying  together, putting one of their necks on top of the other’s neck, holding fore- paws, leaning a head on the shoulder of the other, licking each other, rubbing  their heads together, rubbing their snouts, and of course, playing (Mech, 112)�  According to Bekoff, they  eventually form an exclusive unit. They also rebuff interlopers. When re- uniting they greet effusively, whining and licking one another’s muzzles. If  another male attempts to mate with his consort, he will drive the intruder off  and defend her. Likewise, the female will reject males with whom she has no  interest in mating. (Bekoff, 21)  The pair stays together, unless one of them perishes� Sexually, wolf mating  is also unique, as distinctive as the long and intimate courtship: “The second  peculiarity in wolf breeding is the ‘copulatory tie.’ The male and female be- come physically fastened back-to-back for as much as a half hour and cannot  break the tie (Mech, 47).” This sexual bond is resonant with the affectionate  and intimate bond among pack members and between the breeding pair. For  those who see animal behavior only in terms of the practical tasks of eating and  reproducing, this long copulatory tie is puzzling, since it is not efficient and  makes the pair vulnerable to being surprised by an adversary. Mech comments,  “The function of this has baffled animal behaviorists” (Mech, 47). However, in  Merleau-Ponty’s perspective, the accidents of embodiment are taken up into a  rhythm and style of life that pervades a human life and seems analogously pos- sible in animal existence, which he calls a “preculture” (Nature, 176)� However, it is not only the behavior of the breeding pair that shows this  closeness of bond among the wolves of the pack, but the relationship of all  the members to the pups. The simple fact of this relation is “wolves are crazy  about puppies” (Busch, 83). When the alpha female goes into the den that she  has dug or found in the three weeks before this birthing time (Mech, 119), the  pack is anxious and excited: “prior to a birth, pack members may gather at  the den entrance, whining and scratching the ground” (Busch, 83)� Then once  the pups are born, “there is much excitement in the pack caused by the birth  </page> <page sequence="15"> tHe World of Wolves 83 of pups” (Busch, 83). Other members of the pack play with the pups, take  turns disciplining the pups, and watch over and accompany the pups when the  mother goes off to hunt (Dutcher and Dutcher, 84; Mech, 145)� After a few  weeks of breast feeding, the pups emerge from the den, and as the wolves of  the pack return from the hunt, the pups touch their lips to mouths of any of the  adult wolves of the pack. The adults respond by giving the pups regurgitated  food that they have carried back with them from the hunt, perhaps for great dis- tances (Mech, 48, 134)� The feeding of the pups is a priority for all and “adult  wolves will go hungry if necessary so that young pups may eat” (Dutcher and  Dutcher, 82). Ethologists have coined the phrase “alloparental behavior” to  describe this communal relationship of the pack as together parenting the off- spring in calling it (Bekoff, 81). It seems evident in reading their behavior  that “although, the pups typically are born to the alpha male and female, they  belong to the group as a whole, as part of an extended family” (Dutcher and  Dutcher, 70). The entire pack nourishes and cares for the pups. Given this group parenting, it is fair to claim that “Few animals on earth  display the same intensity of commitment to family in the collaborative care of  the young” (Dutcher and Dutcher, 102)� Not only do the adults feel this bond,  but the relationship is reciprocal as the “pups idolize and imitate the adults,”  which allows them to be taught by all the members of the pack (Dutcher and  Dutcher, 72)� The pups are equally fond of each other, as they stay rolled up in  a ball together in the back of the den for the first three weeks, and then, having  emerged, spend many hours playing together (Mech, 49)� Also, “indulged and  adored by the adults, pups hold a special status within the pack. For a time,  they are outside the pack hierarchy” (Dutcher and Dutcher, 62). Although, the  pack has a certain fluidity, it is still true that “ties are year round, even if they  wander off a bit in summer or winter” (Mech, 55)� A wolf grows up in a web  of caring and excited adults and playful littermates, and for the most part will  stay with this group of wolves, mating, hunting, playing, journeying and rest- ing together, feeling both its place in the group and a sense of belonging� There  may be rough patches of competition for mating or rank in leading the pack,  but these pass�  The strong bonds of affection, loyalty, care, concern, playfulness, coop- erativeness, communicativeness, and trust that persist among the wolves of  the pack mark their sense of the surround. This does not mean that wolves are  not capable of fighting with members of other packs and injuring them, and at  times even killing a trespassing nonmember of the pack in a particularly acute  fight (Mech, 93). Nor does it not mean, as we will explore in the last section,  that wolves are not able hunters who excitedly rip the flesh from deer, caribou,  moose, or other prey animals, swallowing it in large gulps. However, what  seems most significant to understanding their sense of the world is the way  they treat the beings with whom they share a concerned life not only to eat and  survive, but also to play and maintain their bonds. As humans, we now dele- gate a few of our species in the “slaughtering” industry (and their machines) to  </page> <page sequence="16"> 84 glen mazis kill the animals that we eat, as well as keeping these animals to be slaughtered  in prolonged captivity in settings of psychic and physical suffering, and yet we  do not take this one aspect of our existence in order to define this as our es- sence. Why, then, should the proficiency of jaws and teeth of wolves be taken  to characterize how they enter into relationship with the world around them? III. The Silent Conversation of Mortality, Projection of Evil, and  Speciocide In addition to observing wolves’ strong capacity for affection in emotional  bonding, Adolf Murie was struck by another aspect of the wolf personality:  “A second characteristic of wolf personality is the animal’s basic aversion to  fighting” (Mech, 5). He related the anecdote of a wolf ‘frantically upset” at  a dog fight and breaking it up by pulling the aggressor dog by the tail off the  other dog. The wolf will not attack a human being, even if the human were to  take its pups from its den or take away the prey that it had hunted down and  was in the midst of devouring (Mech, 292). As a matter of fact, Lee Smits, who  looked over all the historical records, came to the same conclusion with previ- ous researchers who have done this search: “no wolf, except a wolf with rabies,  has been ever known to make a deliberate attack on a human being in North  America” (Mech, 292)� Of course, the tales often claimed otherwise� Until the recent past, it was also the case that the wolf was the most suc- cessful mammal, except for humans, in inhabiting all habitats of North America  but the tropical rain forest and arid desert (Mech, 31). Even globally, the wolf  only failed to inhabit Africa (Mech, 32)� It seems that for much of prehistory  and even recorded history, human and wolf co-existed and helped one another  as the two predators of large mammals: “Until about four hundred years ago  the wolf was second only to man as the most successful and widespread mam- mal in North America. There is extensive evidence to show that far from being  at enmity, the wolf and hunting man enjoyed globally something approach- ing symbiosis, whereby the existence of each benefited the existence of the  other” (Mowat, vi). Wolves near human encampments were believed to have  served as a warning system for humans of the approach of adversaries with the  wolves’ sensory acuity and tendency to communicate by howling. For many  of the Native American peoples of North America, the wolf was an object of  veneration for its strong loyalty and affection for its family, its skill as a hunter,  and its role in maintaining the health of its prey by culling the weak, sick, and  decrepit (Busch, 110–111)� As is common knowledge, however, the state of affairs between wolves  and humans changed in the Medieval Ages (although scapegoating wolves is  more ancient) and in North America with the arrival of European settlers: “Of  the twenty-four wolf subspecies and races inhabiting North America at the  beginning of the European invasion, seven are now extinct and most of the  remainder are endangered. The wolf has been effectively exterminated in all  </page> <page sequence="17"> tHe World of Wolves 85 of the south-central portions of Canada, in Mexico, and in almost all of the  United States south of Alaska” (Mowat, vii). To concentrate on North America,  especially the United States, it is estimated that since the first settlers arrived,  two million wolves have been killed (Dutcher and Dutcher, 148)� Not only were  wolves killed to the point of extinction, but they were slaughtered with a vehe- mence that is shocking:  Wolves were shot, poisoned, trapped, bludgeoned, and tortured. Wolves were  infected with mange and then released to spread the deadly disease across  the plains. Wolves were staked down and torn apart by dogs. Wolves had  their jaws shut so they could not eat, ensuring a long slow agonized death by  starvation. Wolves were blown to bits by set guns or poisoned by wolf getters,  devices that when bitten fired sodium cyanide into a wolf’s mouth. Wolves  were poisoned by the thousands by strychnine strewn carelessly across the  prairies. Wolf pups were dragged from their dens and either beaten to death  or shot� (Busch, 114)  Wolves were killed with a kind of zeal and self-righteousness that can only  disturb anyone who knows about the ways wolves live and function within the  ecosystem, and what they had to offer humans� The settlers brought with them from Europe hostile attitudes towards  wolves. The wilderness that confronted the settlers was seen as something dis- mally disordered and a threat to the moral order that had to be cleared and  civilized (Lopez, 142–144). Of all the wild creatures within the New World,  the wolf epitomized this threat. The wolf was seen as “the Devil, Red tongued,  sulfur breathing and yellow eyed” (Lopez, 145)� The wolf’s tearing creatures  limb from limb was part of its depravity, as was its attacks on the livestock  the Europeans brought with them that were seen as innocent creatures� These  animals were innately good and the wolf was innately evil—a murderer (Lo- pez, 146). Of course, the wolves were being displaced from their habitats and  losing their prey to be confronted with the settler’s livestock. When livestock  were lost—and it is estimated that only one percent of livestock have been  lost to wolves in the United States, and ninety-nine percent of farmers and  ranchers in territories with wolf populations never lose any livestock to wolves  (Busch, 137)—a killing campaign of many thousand wolves was sanctioned  by the government of various states in return. However, their zeal went beyond  practical concerns� It was felt that humans had to wreak vengeance on behalf  of the innocent animals killed by the depraved murderer: “men felt a moral ob- ligation, not simply that they had the right, to find the wolf and kill it” (Lopez,  146). The moral deficiency of the wolf was popularly expressed as long ago as  Aesop (600 BC) and followed by centuries of tales of the wolf as the essence  of avarice, greed, lust, and viciousness, followed by Medieval tales of wolves  as the devil, followed by the sixteenth-century tale of Little Red Riding Hood  eaten by the wolf, followed by hysteria in seventeenth-century France about  the threat of werewolves as utter sinners (and hundreds of people were also  </page> <page sequence="18"> 86 glen mazis killed as werewolves), and accompanied by three centuries leading up to the  1800s of false European stories of wolves eating humans (Busch, 99–107). The first bounty put upon wolves in the United States was passed by the  Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630, carrying on a European tradition that  started in the 1500s in England (Busch, 115)� It was followed by other states�  To cite one example of these wolf-killing drives, between 1883–1918, there  were 80,000 wolves killed in Montana (Busch, 116). It is interesting to see  the pictures of slaughtered wolves hung up by their feet and nailed to sides of  warehouses, such as the one taken in the 1960s in Minnesota (Lopez, 165):  they have an eerie resonance to the pictures burned into our memories of Nazi  concentration camps. Of course, the slaughter of wolves was part of a much  vaster speciocide that reached a fevered pitch in the nineteenth-century. On the  American plains, there were slaughters from 1850 to 1900 of not only wolves,  but also buffalo for hides, pigeons for target practice, antelopes for backstraps,  and Indian ponies to keep Native Americans poor that totaled 500 million crea- tures, 1 to 2 million of them wolves (Busch, 180). As Barry Lopez argues, the  growing nation had to impose some control over the wolf population once  their prey had been greatly diminished by the settlers and livestock kept near  them, and this would entail killing some wolves, “but it didn’t have to, as it  did, kill every last wolf” (Lopez, 180). By 1900, the wolf became extinct in  most of Europe and Eastern United States, and then gradually as the century  wore on, also became extinct in other areas of the country. However, as late as  the 1920s, 20,000 wolf pelts per year in Canada were taken. Even in the recent  year of 2004–2005, still about 3,000 wolves per year were killed for parka trim  in Canada and 700 in Alaska, as well as 452 killed by snowmobile hunters in  Alaska. Humans still kill wolves for pleasure (Busch, 145). In comparison to record of the so-called “civilized” human killing, it is  instructive to turn to the wolves’ manner of killing that has been represented  as pure evil. Varying with the differing locations, wolves’ main prey are deer,  moose, caribou, elk, wild sheep of various sorts, and beaver (Mech, 173). In  the summer denning period, wolves can also exert a lot of effort in catching  mice (Mech, 179). However, the picture that haunts the minds of those who  see the wolf as an evil creature is not that of them pouncing over and over  again on little field mice, but of them ripping great chunks of flesh and organs  from the body of a moose or an elk or a caribou (Mech, 185). Wolves have a  capacity to eat twenty pounds of meat at a time, and their sharp teeth and pow- erful jaws allow them to rip large chunks of flesh from the body of the fallen  prey (Mech, 181). Wolves hunt into the wind, picking up the prey’s scent, and  usually run them down after a series of chases (Lopez, 60; Mech, 197, 202)�  Barry Lopez feels that many more people would have protested the speciocide  against wolves if “they could have got over the revulsion of the way wolves  kill” (Lopez, 56). Wolves run alongside the prey and slash at it with their teeth,  rip at its flanks and abdomen, tear at the nose and head, and either grab it by the  flank or nose and throw it down, or wait until it collapses from loss of blood.  </page> <page sequence="19"> tHe World of Wolves 87 They then rip open the abdominal cavity and begin eating, even if the animal  is not yet dead (Lopez, 56; Bekoff 95). Even though this may seem to be a hor- rific way to die, this way of killing needs to be seen in context. First of all, the  prey animal probably has gone into shock with the first massive injuries and  resulting blood loss, and does not feel the pain of the rest of the attack. Second,  is this any more gruesome than the forced shuffle of domestic animals being  prodded down shoots in a single file march, then being given a 300 volt shock  to the back of the head, then hung upside down by the feet while remaining  stunned, then carried along in this position until their main arteries and veins  are cut by a knife in the neck, and then allowed to bleed to death? It may well be that there is no kind way to administer a death blow to one’s  prey, yet savagery might consist more in the relationship between predator and  prey or in the way that the sacrifice of another being is carried out and used for  the good of the greater web of life, as we compare the two competing predators  of large mammals—human and wolf. Human prey tends to live in conditions  of confinement that involve crowding, boredom, lack of exercise, lack of nor- mal life activities, lack of social existence, unhealthy conditions controlled by  drugs, coercion, and many other causes of continual suffering� Food animals  have been kept in this manner because humans have regarded other animals  as not having rights or inherent dignity, and they want to make a greater profit  from them� After the animal has spent its life in these conditions, the gift of its  nourishment for humans is often used poorly, with much of its possible value  gone to waste� This is, of course, to concentrate on the food industry and not  focus on the many animals that humans have killed for pleasure, or for one  small piece of their anatomy to be used in the fashion industry or for some  other commodity. This is in stark contrast to the wolf, who eats every bit of  its prey, with “virtually nothing” remaining, other than a few bits of hair and  a few bits of bone with smaller prey, or perhaps the skull, jaw bone, a little  hide, and long bones with larger prey (Busch, 95–96; Mech, 186). Wolves are  very frightened of human beings, and this is a common feeling among animals  (Dutcher and Dutcher, 32). They seem able to sense how we can kill them or  even other humans, performing large scale massacres with little sense of how  we are violating the web of life. It is also a myth that wolves enter into some  sort of killing frenzy (Mech, 97). They seem restrained in the hunt, and do not  rampage, but set about eating the animal they have hunted down. Humans,  however, have been known to rampage in killing many animals for no appar- ent reason�  In looking at human killing in a larger context, it is striking that “In fact,  the only animal that habitually preys upon prime, mature animals is man”  (Mech, 94). The wolf by contrast is noted to prey upon the sick, infirm, aged,  or incapacitated members of its prey. When carcasses of animals killed by  wolves are available to be studied, the findings are that the prey had hoof dis- ease or tuberculosis or tapeworm or botflies or other conditions that meant they  were enfeebled in some way (Mech, 260). This is why the Keewatin Eskimo  </page> <page sequence="20"> 88 glen mazis have the saying, “The caribou feeds the wolf, but it is the wolf who keeps the  caribou strong” (Busch, 93). Unlike the claims of many human hunters, who  have blamed wolves for the loss of the hunted, wolves help maintain the vital- ity of the herds they hunt by culling those members who are in poor condition  and would have to share the food resources, even if scarce. However, humans  do usually go after the prime specimens, if possible� Farley Mowat relates the  inland Eskimo tale of how the First Woman, borrowing from the power of  the God of the Sky, created the animals from a hole in the earth, and the last  one created was the caribou for the sustenance of the humans. However, the  humans killed so many caribou in their prime that only the sick and weak ones  were left. In response to the First Woman asking for help with this problem, the  God of the Sky created the wolf to keep the caribou healthy (Mowat, 124–25).  The wolf has fulfilled this function in the greater ecological balance of the  surround� It can be explained mechanically and causally: the prey are either  too fast or too strong to be taken down by the wolves except those that are  ailing in some way� Furthermore, the prey animals announce their poor condi- tion by subtleties of stance, peculiarity of gait, rankness of breath, wounds,  hair loss, visible infection, etc., that the wolves can recognize. They test their  perceptions by making several rushes at the herd and seeing if this member  does indeed lag, labor, or seem unable to escape. So, David Mech concludes,  “selection for young, old, and otherwise inferior individuals can be thought of  as a very mechanical process” (Mech, 262).  However, there is another way to see the wolves’ relation to the animals  they hunt that incorporates these facts and also suggests that, as we have im- plied in this essay, wolves may have an affective and lived sense of the animals  and beings of their surround. After the beginning of the hunt, when the wolves  stalk their prey, there comes a moment of confrontation after the wolves run  into their midst� Often, whether it is caribou or moose or deer, they stand there  watching the wolves. Then comes a very striking moment: when the wolves  see that the prey has noticed them, both stay still looking at each other—“for  one or two moments neither predators nor prey moved” (Mech, 200). Mech  complains that this pause is scientifically inexplicable (Mech, 201). Barry Lo- pez, however, has a profound interpretation of this moment: “Wolves and prey  remain absolutely still while staring at each other. . . . I think what transpires  in those moments of staring is an exchange of information between predator  and prey that either triggers a chase or defuses the hunt right there� I call this  exchange the conversation of death” (Lopez, 62). In the glance at one another,  Lopez believes there is a mutual recognition, that the wolf announces that it is  seeking prey to keep its vitality alive and the prey animal concedes that its life  is ebbing, and an agreement that this is a worthy death of both feeding the wolf  and protecting the rest of the herd. Certainly, there is much evidence in ethol- ogy of various animals sacrificing themselves for the sake of saving others of  </page> <page sequence="21"> tHe World of Wolves 89 their group� 17 Lopez imagines that in this silent interchange the prey animal  could be expressing something like the following: “I have lived a full life, says  the prey� I am ready to die� I am willing to die because clearly I will be dying  so that others in this small herd will go on living. I am ready to die because my  leg is broken or my lungs are impacted and my time is finished” (Lopez, 95).  After this silent exchange the prey begins to run and the wolves follow after it  to bring it down. Often the other members of the herd do not move.  It is plausible that there would be this silent recognition between animals�  As mentioned before, Merleau-Ponty suggested in his nature lectures that,  there is a “preculture” among animals that has a sacred or ceremonial sense in  the way certain behaviors take on a symbolic dimension in celebrating animal  vitality, belonging with others, and valuing that of which they are a part (Na- ture, 176)� This sense of animality resonates with Lopez’s interpretation of the  meaning of this silent “conversation of death”: “I call this exchange in which  animals appear to lock eyes and make a decision the conversation of death.  It is a ceremonial exchange, the flesh of the hunted in exchange for respect  for its spirit� In this way, both animals, not the predator alone, choose for the  encounter to end in death� There is, at least, a sacred order in this� There is no- bility” (Lopez, 94). This interpretation makes us look at the wolf’s hunting dif- ferently: the zest of the wolves is not a rapacity, but an attunement with other  animals that feels fitting, an implicit mutual respect and cooperation. Lopez feels that this is why wild wolves have a different bearing, a kind  of dignity and vitality that is lacking in captive wolves. There is almost a sa- credness in the hunt with other animals that is destroyed when the captives are  fed on the meat of slaughterhouses� Certainly there are many reasons why the  captive wolf seems crushed in its spirit—coercion of its activities and lack of  its far ranging territory, for example—but being ripped out of the context of a  noble recognition of life and death and cooperative survival with other animals  is also a possible reason. As part of my research for this paper, I visited a wolf  sanctuary. I will never forget, especially, the beauty and the power of the three  gray timber wolves that I sat and watched for some time. Yet they broke my  heart, as the pain of their captivity and the damage to their sense of vitality  and dignity was palpable. I felt as Charles Bergman did when after traveling to  Alaska to see wild wolves, he saw wolves by a trash dump:  These were not the wild wolves I had traveled so far to see. Though they were  wild, they seemed nearly tamed. I found in these wolves an example of one  way the Western mind accommodates all these disturbing impulses we find in  the wolf. . . . We control it, as we control the wolves of Alaska. Both the literal  17.

It was a sad image, an image of loss.18  The contemporary American human way of dealing with death, whether our  own or that of the animals that we kill to eat, is to hide from it and manufacture  it in an impersonal way. It lacks the respect for those who perish, the gratitude  for those who were part of the web of life and then pass, the acknowledgment  of sacrifice among species, and obscures the sacred dimension of the cycle  between life and death. So, rather than seeing the wolf as savage and evil in  its frank immersion in dealing the death-blow to its prey, I would suggest that  our way of dealing with the death of those we eat is more savage and perhaps,  evil. This brings me to my last point of this essay, hinted at by Bergman, and a  concern that seemed to haunt the pages of each writer cited in this essay: hu- mans have projected the most troubled aspects of our being onto our sense of  wolves. Farley Mowat starts his book with the lament and warning, “So-called  civilized man eventually succeeding in totally extirpating the real wolf from  his collective mind and substituting for it a contrived image, replete with evil  aspects that generated almost pathological fear and hatred” (Mowat, vi–vii).  If there is a kind of rapaciousness and an urge to destroy other species that  has been part of the human psyche, we must be careful not to project it onto  wolves and other animals, where we can no longer take appropriate responsi- bility for our own demons and work through them creatively and courageously,  and instead slaughter the supposed demons around us� That is why I feel an  agreement with Bekoff’s use of “anthropodenial” for describing the detached,  scientific attitude that sees animals as objects and feels that only rationalized,  quantitative data about animals reveal any truth about them. When we can  no longer feel our kinship as part of the flesh of the world and know in our  own embodiment the feelings that wolves feel of joy, affection, loyalty, at- tunement to other species and the natural surround, then we obscure their truth  and substitute a blank screen upon which we can project our worst fears and  unrecognized failings� This projection, in turn, allows us to commit speciocide  in the seemingly justifiable attempt to obliterate this “evil” that has been “ob- jectively” assessed. The study of wolves can teach us more about the ways of  human self-deception�  The wolf was seen by many Native American tribes as a teacher of the  spirit, especially among the Pawnees and Cheyenne and Marc Bekoff states  that a key principle of “deep ethology” is that “Animals are a way of know- ing” (Mech, 111; Bekoff, 9). If we take up the phenomenological perspective  of Merleau-Ponty and hearken to the reverberations of the wolves about us in  the surround within our own embodiment and its depth of perception in kin- esthesis, the affective sense of things, the material imaginary, the sensual, the  18� Charles Bergman, Wild Echoes: Encounters with the Most Endangered Animals in  North America (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2003), 41–42. </page> <page sequence="23"> tHe World of Wolves 91 proprioceptive, and other levels of the deeply felt, we can learn from wolves  about the loyalty to those with whom we feel kin, the playful belonging with  others and the natural world, the sense of wonder in vitality, movement, and  perceptual acuity, and an implicit sense of the mutuality and respectful dignity  in the mortality of all creatures who become food for the further nourishment  of all other living beings. </page> <page sequence="24"> 92 </page> </plain_text>
