<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Anglo-Saxon gospelbooks of Judith, countess of Flanders: their text, make-up and function PATRICK MCGURK AND JANE ROSENTHAL The subjects of this paper are four eleventh-century Anglo-Saxon gospel- books and their patron, Judith, countess of Flanders. Two of them, with their distinguished late Anglo-Saxon illuminations and their precious silver-gilt bindings, are among the more celebrated treasures of the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. The remaining two, which are now preserved at the Hessische Landesbibliothek in Fulda, and at the Archives of Monte Cassino, may no longer have jewelled covers, but are still luxury books of the highest quality. Judith, countess of Flanders, was probably the daughter of Baldwin IV of Flanders by his second marriage to a daughter of Richard II, duke of Normandy, in or after 1031, and was thus the half-sister of Baldwin V.1 By 1051 she was married to Tostig Godwineson, and moved to England in 1052 1 Judith's parentage is uncertain. The Life of King Edward the Confessor , ed. F. Barlow, 2nd ed. (Oxford, 1992), pp. 38-9 describes her as the sister of Baldwin IV of Flanders, though John of Worcester and Orderic Vitalis both describe her as his daughter: see the still useful survey of most of the evidence in E. A. Freeman, The History of the Norman Conquest of England, its Causes and Results , 5 vols. (Oxford, 1867-79) III, 656-8, and the succinct note in R.A. Svoboda, 'The Illustrations of the Life of St Omer (Saint-Omer, Bibliothèque Municipale 698' (unpubl. Ph.D. dissertation, Univ. of Minnesota, 1983), pp. 115-16, n. 275. William of Jumièges {Gesta Normannorum Ducum , ed. J. Marx (Paris, 1914), p. 88) says that Baldwin IV married Eleanor, daughter of Duke Richard II of Normandy, and Judith could have been the child of this marriage and therefore Baldwin V's half-sister. Baldwin IV's first wife, Otgiva, died in 1031. The date of Judith's birth is unknown. She married Tostig by 1051 and apparently bore him children ( Life of King Edward , ed. Barlow, pp. 82-3), and she was able to bear Weif IV two sons after her marriage in 1070 (or 1071). This makes less likely Decker- Hauff's suggestion that she was born before 1028 as the daughter of Richard III of Normandy (who died in 1027) and Adele of France (who married Baldwin V of Flanders in 1028). See H. Decker-Hauff, 'Zur älteren Geschichte der Weifen', Festschrift %ur 900-Jahr- Feier des Klosters, 1056-1956 , ed. G. Spahr (Weingarten, 1956), pp. 31-48. Decker-Hauff's hypothesis ignores (as Svoboda pointed out) the early evidence of the Life of King Edward and takes too literally German descriptions of Judith as queen of England. These erroneous descriptions could as easily have been caused by Judith being the sister-in-law of the future King Harold as by her supposed kinship to William the Conqueror (as Decker-Hauff argues) through her supposed father Richard III. 251</page><page sequence="2">Patrick McGurk and Jane Posenthal with the return of the Godwine family after its temporary exile in the previous year.2 Tostig was made earl of Northumbria in 1055, and Durham tradition certainly records Judith's presence in the North on at least one occasion.3 Edward the Confessor's Life, the early Vita JEdwardi , describes her pilgrimage to Rome (which is dated by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to 1061) in the company of her husband and others.4 The rebellion of the Northumbrians against Tostig's rule in 1065, and the failure of King Edward and Earl Harold to reinstate Tostig, forced him and his wife into exile in Flanders in that year.5 Judith was widowed on Tostig's death at the battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066, and she remained in Flanders until her second marriage to Weif IV in very late 1070 or in 1071. 6 She bore him two sons, Welf and Henry, and is 2 The celebrations of Tostig and Judith's wedding in Flanders (in or before 1051) are linked to the exile (after 8 September 1051) of Tostig's father, Godwine, to that country in the Life of King Edward , ed. Barlow, pp. 82-3. The Godwine family fled England in 1051 after an unsuccessful confrontation with King Edward the Confessor, though they were to return in triumph the following year. 3 The year of Tostig's appointment to Northumbria is given by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle 1055 DE: Two of the Saxon Chronicles Parallel , ed.

The Historia Dunelmensis Ecclesie , in Symeonis Monachi Opera Omnia , ed. T. Arnold, 2 vols., RS (London, 1882-5) I, 94-5, relates the story of Judith and Tostig's devotion and generosity to the see of -St Cuthbert, of the attempt by one of Judith's female servants to enter the church of St Cuthbert, and of Judith's subsequent reparation and gifts to Durham, including a crucifix 'of wonderful workman- ship'. The twelfth-century vita of St Oswine ( Miscellanea Biographica , ed. J. Raine, Surtees Soc. 8 (Oxford, 1838), 14-15 and 18-20) records Bishop .¿Ethel wine's gift to Judith in 1065 of some of the hair of St Oswine. It has been stated that the names of Tostig and Judith both appear in the Durham Liber uitae (London, BL Cotton Domitian A. vii). The names of Godwine and Tostig are distinguished by being entered in an eleventh-century hand in conspicuous gold capitals on 12v, and the name Judith appears twice (on 43 v and 44v), though it cannot be certain that the countess of Flanders was being commemorated in either case. For these, see the transcript in Liber Vitae Dunelmensis , ed. J. Stevenson, Surtees Soc. 13 (Oxford, 1841) and the facsimile (where the Godwine-Tostig entries are clearer than in the manuscript), Liber Vitae Dunelmensis , Surtees Soc. 136 (Oxford, 1923). On 43v, a 'Juthitta' is between 'Walöef, Simunď and 'David' and on 44v a 'Jutet' is between 'Betriz' and 'Gode'. 4 The Life of King Edward , ed. Barlow, pp. 52-3 and ASC 1061 D ( Two Chronicles , ed. Plummer I, 189 (text); Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , ed. Whitelock et al ., p. 73 (translation)) speak of the pilgrims being accompanied by Bishop Ealdred. The most recent editor of the life assigned its composition to 1065-7, but for the view that the only safe terminus ante quern is the death of Edith in 1075, see the review by R. R. Darlington in EHR 79 (1964), 147-8. However opaque and vague the life might be, its author seemed to know the Godwine family. 5 ASC 1065 C ( Two Chronicles , ed. Plummer 1, 192; Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , ed. Whitelock et al., p. 138). Both the chronicle and the Life of King Edward , ed.

Welf cast aside his second wife, Ethelinde, daughter of the outlawed Otto of Bavaria. This could have happened shortly after Otto's fall in 1070. Decker-Hauff has made the plausible guess that the wedding of Welf 252</page><page sequence="3">The Anglo-Saxon gospelbooks of Judith , countess of Y landers recorded making generous gifts to Weingarten, a monastery which had been established by the Welfs a few years earlier.7 One charter in her name and in those of her husband and sons, and dated 12 March 1094, lists, among bequests of land and many shrines, vestments and relics, the gift of four books, which are described as 'tria plenaria et uno textu euangelii'.8 At a very early date on the Continent Judith's wealth and the scale of her donations deeply impressed contemporaries.9 She died apparently on 5 March 1094.10 The gospelbooks which have been associated with Countess Judith are ( sigla used in this paper shown in brackets): Fulda, Hessische Landesbibliothek, Aa. 21 ( Siglum F) Monte Cassino, Archivio della Badia, 437 ( Siglum C) New York, Pierpont Morgan Library, M. 708 ( Siglum D) New York, Pierpont Morgan Library, M. 709 ( Siglum A) A first task is to consider their connections with Judith. All are written in eleventh-century English Caroline minuscule and, with the exception of C, they can be shown to have been in Weingarten. The charter just mentioned, which is on the last folio of F, and other twelfth-century matter with Weingarten connections on other leaves in the book, demonstrate the manuscript's presence at Weingarten by the twelfth century. D's presence in early medieval Weingarten is demonstrated by twelfth- and thirteenth-century matter on fly-leaves. There is no added Weingarten material in A, but since the eighteenth century it has had the same history as the second Morgan book, and this suggests that it too had been at Weingarten in the Middle Ages. Its binding, like that on D, allows it to be identified with a manuscript described and Judith took place at the Goslar Christmas assembly in 1070 ('Zur älteren Geschichte der Weifen', p. 41 and nn. 47 and 66) when Weif IV was made duke of Bavaria. The late twelfth- century Weingarten addition to the De inventione et translatione sanguinis Domini , MGH, SS 1 5.2 (Hannover, 1887), 923, says that the marriage was arranged through the offices of a kinsman of Welf, the archbishop of Trier. This archbishop (Uoto) died in 1078. 7 See C. Buhl, 'Weingarten- Altdorf ', and U.

The Weingarten Necrology (MGH Necrolo- gia Germaniae, 2 vols. (Berlin, 1888) I, 221-2) says she died on 5 March (the year 1094 in the manuscript is a later addition). The day is a week before the donation (12 March 1094), which is entered in the Fulda gospels. See the recent discussion by H.U.

This presumably saved it from the fate of the Morgan books and, like other Weingarten manuscripts, it has remained at the Hessische Landesbibliothek to which it had been taken after 1803. The fourth book, that at Monte Cassino, contains no internal evidence of its early history.13 The only English manuscript at that Benedic- tine house, it was first linked iconographically to the other Judith books in a stimulating paper by Meta Harssen in 1930. 14 Alan Bishop claimed that its scribe was found in the other Judith Books, and suggested that the four were 0 The inventory made in 1753 was first published by P. Lindner, Fünf Professbücher süddeutscher Benediktiner- Abteien. II: Weingarten (Kempten and Munich, 1909), pp. 117-20, and discussed by K. Löffler, Die Handschriften des Klosters Weingarten , Beihefte zum Zentralblatt für Bibliothekswissenschaft 41 (Leipzig, 1912), 147-9. Löffler was the first to try to identify the Treasury books with present surviving manuscripts. The pink skin used to strengthen the binding of A (as of D and other Weingarten manuscripts), possibly at the time of Abbot Berthold, could take A's association with Weingarten back to the thirteenth century. 12 For the history of the manuscripts before their sale to Thomas Coke, see Löffler, Handschriften des Klosters Weingarten , pp. 19-26 and W.

It is clear from the Fulda librarian Boehm's account (printed in Aus Fuldas Geistesleben. Festschrift sçum 1 50 jährigen Jubiläum der Landesbibliothek Fulda , ed. J. Thiele (Fulda, 1928), pp. 59-88, at 80-4) on which both Löffler and Irtenkauf are based, that Niboyet took the two Morgan books together with the two other Weingarten books which are also now in New York (the Berthold Missal and the Missal of Heinricus sacrista) from Boehm. Niboyet appears to have suggested that they had been handed over to the new Fulda commander General Baron Thiébault, but in the face of the latter's denials it is difficult to establish who stole them {ibid. pp. 80-1 and 84). Holkham Hall records, on some of which the account in L. Dorez, Les Manuscrits à peintures de la Bibliothèque de Lord Leicester à Holkham Hall, Norfolk (Paris, 1908), pp. 5-7 is based, indicate that the four manuscripts were offered to Coke via a Parisian dealer, Delahante, in 1818. Patrick McGurk is grateful to the Honorary Librarian of Holkham Hall, Mr D. Mortlock, for further information taken from letters found in vol. VIII of the Holkham Hall copy of the unpublished catalogue of Holkham Hall manuscripts. William Voelkle kindly informed Patrick McGurk that the Holkham Hall visitors' book records Pierpont Morgan's stay there on the night of 10 August 1926. 13 The earliest additions are possibly, the names added in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century hands at the bottom of p. 238 and the fourteenth-century addition on p. 240. 14 M.

How the manuscript reached Monte Cassino has never been explained in a satisfactory way, though the connections of the Welf family with Central Italy through Matilda, countess of Tuscany, provide a possible background for its migration.16 Whereas the connections of these four books with Judith, countess of Flanders, can only therefore be inferred, the evidence on which such an inference has to be based is persuasive. They could be an early surviving example of a group of books made for a single patron. Among early medieval patrons, a prince like Charles the Bald stands out prominently. He had books made at one centre, and others were presented to him.17 T.A. Heslop has recently argued that Cnut and Emma commissioned many luxury books, gospels and missals, in eleventh-century England.18 Later medieval patrons can be associated with a large number of beautiful books.19 The four gospelbooks of Judith are, however, unusual in many ways. They were made to order in one country, and were kept together for the six years of an enforced exile in another before the final bequest of at least three of them to Weingarten.20 They were apparently made to a particular specification, almost as though they were a 'job lot'.21 It shall be seen that the gospel text of three of them was curiously and almost inexplicably selective, and that this raises the question of their possible function.22 It might well be that many other examples of similar commissions have been lost through the accidents of fate. Their survival, whether through chance or otherwise, allows a particular commission to be examined and probed. They are sumptuous books and 15 T. A.M.

They are worth studying, however, not just because of their quality but because of the problems of patronage and of the execution of patrons' commissions they allow us to approach. Inevitably much about them must always remain uncertain, and any study must be based on speculation and unverifiable hypotheses. Such speculations and hypotheses will be presented in the following pages, but it is hoped that at all times fact will be distinguished from hypothesis, what is certain from what is not. THE PREFACES AND TEXT OF THE FOUR JUDITH GOSPELBOOKS Alone among surviving Latin gospelbooks, the four Judith books confine their introductory texts to the prefaces for Mark, Luke and John. 23 In this way they omit all the general accessory texts normally found by the ninth century at the opening and at the end of most gospels. At the opening they have neither the canon tables nor the general explanatory letters such as those of Jerome to Pope Damasus or of Eusebius to Carpianus; and at the end they omit the usual liturgical capitulary lists. Nor do they have the individual chapter lists for each book. The omission of these introductory and concluding accessory texts and of the preface to the gospel of Matthew must also have been intended. The books were meant to open directly with the gospel of Matthew and its portrait and initial pages. In two of the books, A and F, these pages were preceded by an illumination in which Judith herself appears. It should also be noted that chapter numbers and Eusebian sections are likewise omitted from the margins of the gospel text.24 Again this is a relatively unusual feature, and could make the books less easy to use. The only texts to be marked out in any way were the genealogies of Christ in Matthew and Luke, and the Passion texts. The genealogies were arranged in columns, the Passion texts were announced by headings in gold rustic capitals and marked out for reading.25 23 The table in McGurk, 'Text', p. 46 shows the contents of later Anglo-Saxon gospelbooks, where the four Judith books stand alone among this relatively small sample. As far as is known, contemporary or near-contemporary continental books do not restrict their accessory texts in the same way. Collation of the books shows that the omission was deliberate. In D two pages were left blank after the prefaces for Mark (25v-26r), for Luke (41 v-42r) and for John (65v-66r), but these could not have been enough to hold the omitted chapter-lists for these gospels. Thus the second scribe in D (who wrote all three prefaces) conformed to the restrictive plan for accessory texts of the other Judith gospels. His practice of opening a new quire with the gospel prologue, and of leaving the verso of the evangelist portrait page free of writing probably accounted for the pages which were left blank. 24 The marginal Eusebian numbers added on pp. 5 and 6 in C seem to be a later addition. 25 The interlineated sigla are 't' for the words of Christ, 's' for the discourse of others, and 'c' for the narrative. These are found in all the Passion texts with the exception of Luke and John in D. The Passion text is distinguished further in the following places: A, in Mark by a line left blank before ch. XIV with a line of rustics, and in Luke by another blank line and some rustics; D, in Matthew and Luke by a line of rustics, and in Mark by a line of uncials followed 256</page><page sequence="7">The Anglo-Saxon gospelhooks of Judith , countess of ¥ landers One scribe wrote the greater part of these four books. It was suggested in an earlier study on the 'York Gospels' in 1986 that the common scribe used a very similar text in all four.26 The cohesiveness of this text is confirmed by comparing it with the selected variants, recently published by Bonifatius Fischer, from a large number of pre-950 gospels.27 Figures follow of agreements between the Judith gospels in a selection from each of the four gospels.

Such close agreement, however, must be compared with the high proportion of agreements between some Carolingian gospels revealed in the by a line of rustics; C, in Mark by a heading in gold rustics 'passio Domini nostri lesu Christi secundum Marcurn', a line of rustics, and a cross before XV. 42, and in Luke by a line of rustics; and F, John XIX. 39 by a cross. 26 McGurk, 'Text', p. 52. 27 B.

It will never be possible to prove, in the absence of surviving evidence, that the main Judith scribe used a single exemplar, but his scribal habits and his consistency as a copyist can be scrutinized through a study of the gospel text in the four books. In later Anglo-Saxon England, two other scribes, Eadwig Basan and the scribe designated B by Alan Bishop, wrote more than one gospelbook. Eadwig Basan's two were very different from each other and used different exemplars.29 A mutilated opening of the book might account for one of these books, Hanover, Kestner Museum WM. XXI a. 36, beginning with the canon tables only where the second, London, British Library, Add. 34890, has all the accessory matter save the canon tables, but the Luke and John chapter lists in the two are quite different, and some sampling of the text suggests important differences between the two.30 Scribe B's books are much more closely textually comparable with each other. Two of them are London, BL Royal 1. D. IX and Loan 11, and the third, the most luxurious and finished of the three, is Cambridge, Trinity College B. 10. 4. All three open with the same quartet of general prefaces, and in the same order: first Jerome's letter to Pope Damasus, followed by the extract from Jerome's commentary on Matthew, beginning with the words 'Plures fuisse', Eusebius's epistle to Carpianus, and finally the preface opening 'Sciendum etiam' sometimes falsely attributed to Jerome. All three end with the same capitulary.31 The Royal manuscript does not have chapter lists, but this omission has been made good in the other two which have chapter lists from the same A family. The Royal and Trinity gospels were among a group of six books isolated by Glunz as being derived from a common ancestor at Winchester, and Glunz would have placed the Loan manuscript firmly in the same group if he had known of it.32 He found that the two gospels now known 28 B. Fischer, 'Der Text der Quedlinburger Evangeliars', Das Samuhel-Evangeliar aus dem Quedlinburger Dom (Passau, 1991), pp. 35-42.

The other four manuscripts were Eadwig Basan's already-mentioned gospels (BL Add. 34890); London, BL Harley 76; Cambridge, Pembroke College 301; and Cambridge, St John's College 73, which is, unlike the others, a post-Conquest manuscript. 258</page><page sequence="9">The Anglo-Saxon gospelbooks of Judith, countess of ¥ landers to have been the work of scribe B (Royal and Trinity) formed (with London, BL Harley 76 and the post-Conquest Cambridge, St John's College 73) a distinct sub-group of four within the six. It is not difficult to demonstrate that the three books by scribe B were very close to each other, and the possibility of a common exemplar must be faced. Frere found that the capitulary shared by Glunz's sub-group and by the Loan manuscript had a common lacuna in August and September, and that they were all derived from a common archetype, though they were not 'all immediate copies of the same original, nor yet copied any one from the other'.33 An examination of the text of the capitulary in the three manuscripts by scribe B shows that Trinity is the most correct and has the fullest gospel extracts, that Royal and Loan are very careless, and that it is theoretically possible to envisage a common exemplar behind all three.34 If such a theoretical possibility can be envisaged in the capitulary, it is almost certainly ruled out in the gospel text.35 Trinity seems to have different readings on many occasions which suggest a different exemplar. Some illustrative readings follow, the Trinity readings being given first, those in Royal and Loan second: Matt. XXVII. 31 crucifigeretur against crucifigerent {though the corrected Royal agrees with Trinity) Mark IV. 15, 16, 18 hii against hi Luke 1.34 et dixit against dixit John XII. 16 et haec against ut haec John XII. 28 clarifica against glorifico John XII. 29 audierat against audiebat Loan and Royal show far fewer differences if those clearly due to carelessness are discounted. It may be coincidence that both render 'publicanis' in Mark 11.16 as 'plicanis', but other shared readings suggest considerable affinity. There are a few readings in Loan (mostly in Mark) which seem to rule out a common exemplar for the two or at the least indicate that Loan was in contact with another exemplar at these points: 33 Frere, Roman Lectionary , p. 158. 34 It should be noted that while scribe B wrote all of Trinity, he may not have written the capitulary in the other two. In the lections in the capitulary, Royal and Loan frequently give the wrong evangelist or Eusebian reference, often taking one or the other incorrectly through eyeskip from the lection immediately above. On one occasion Loan compresses two lections by beginning with one and ending with the second, and Royal does this at least twice. The differences in the gospel extracts could be explained by independent and sometimes unconscious alterations of a common exemplar, these differences usually consisting of the omission of some words at the beginning or at the end of an extract. 35 Royal has been collated fully for a later comparison of scribe B's books, with the text of the Judith gospels, but only selected chapters from the Loan and Trinity manuscripts have been collated for this examination of the text of the gospels of scribe B. 259</page><page sequence="10">Patrick McGurk and Jane Posenthal Matt. XIV. 14 languores against languidos Mark XIV. 3 nardi spicati against nardi pistici Mark XIV. 21 si non esset natus against si natus non fuisset Mark XIV. 44 adimpleantur against impleantur Occasionally Royal and Trinity share corrections (made by scribe B) which could suggest that they were corrected as part of the same campaign. Thus Matt. III. 5 both insert regio between omnis and circa Matt. XIII. 23 both add verbum which both originally omitted Mark III. 26 both insert solis between nisi and sacerdotibus Mark III. 18 Alphei et Thaddeum et Simonem Cannaneum. Both give this text over an erasure Mark XIV. 27 both add in me after scandalizabimini Luke XXII. 30 both change noui to nouum The need for many of these shared corrections would have been obvious to a reader or corrector, but their appearance in both books is of interest. Royal's carelessness is most marked. There are mistakes on every page, sometimes one or two a line. A sample from two chapters in Matthew and Mark follows: Matt. XI. 1 cum summasset for čum consummasset Matt. XI. 5 evangelizatur for evangelizantur Matt. XI. 19 verax for vorax Matt. XI. 22 remissus for remissius Matt. XI. 26 sic fugit for sic fuit Mark 1.13 in derto for in deserto Mark 1.25 et exei for et exi Mark 1.34 ea ex ei for ex ei Mark 1.43 tagens for tangens Mark 1.45 diffame for diffamare Some of these errors were corrected, perhaps immediately after they had been made, but their number and their character are striking. They contrast with the text written by the same scribe in the other two books where such glaring mistakes were far fewer. Such a contrast in scribal practice must always be remembered when the possibility of common exemplars is considered. The many mistakes made persistently in Royal do not in themselves rule out a common exemplar for the three gospelbooks written by scribe B; other readings do. Trinity seems to have a significant few which indicate a different exemplar. Loan also, particularly in parts of Mark, seems to have access to a different recension, and the three books clearly form a distinctive sub-group within the family identified by Glunz. Three famous Greek sixth-century gospel manuscripts can be mentioned in passing at this point. They are the codices purpurei , the Rossanensis (Rossano, 260</page><page sequence="11">The Anglo-Saxon gospelbooks of Judith y countess of Flanders Cathedral Library, s.n.), the Petropolitanus (St Petersburg, Saltykov-Shchedrin Public Library, Gr. 537 + Patmos, St John 67 4- London, BL Cotton Titus C. xv 4- Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Vat. gr. 2305 4- Vienna, Nationalbib- liothek, Lambeck 2 + Athens, Lerma s.n.) and the fragmentary codex (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, Suppl. gr. 1286 4- Marioupol, Gymnasium s.n.) to which the siglum O has been assigned. They do not share the same scribe but they are of the highest luxury, being written in gold and silver on purple leaves. The text in all three is close, but many variants separate them. These variants have not been considered by scholars as an impediment to their hypothetical dependence on a single exemplar, such was the strength of their numerous shared readings and of their distinctive opulence.36 The gospel text written by the scribe common to all four Judith books was particularly close to the scribe B sub-group. The table of 160 readings from eight Anglo-Saxon Gospels, which was published in the introduction to the facsimile of the 'York Gospels', shows how close A is to Royal.37 It was also noted in the same introduction that in the gospel prefaces the Judith books (among the later Anglo-Saxon books) formed a distinctive group with the three scribe B books and with London, BL Harley 76. 38 The Judith books further agree almost invariably with the readings of the so-called 'Winchester' group published by Glunz, and in particular with Royal and Trinity.39 The closeness of the Judith and scribe B books can be seen in many readings. It might be worth noting two where alternatives caused confusion: * 36 H.S. Cronin, Codex Purpureus Petropolitanus (Cambridge, 1899), pp. xliii, liii and lxiii; J. Gribomont in the commentary volume to the facsimile of the Rossano gospels, Codex Purpureus Kossanensis , ed. G. Cavallo, J. Gribomont and W.C. Loerke, Codices Selecti 86 (Graz, 1987), 175-210, at 178-180, 191, 196-8 and 210. 37 McGurk, 'Text', pp. 56-63. The text used by the second scribe is different, being very close over long passages (e.g. Luke XVII.33-end; John XVII.l-end) to that of the ninth-century, possibly Breton, London, BL Egerton 609. In other chapters there is some agreement with other members of the 'Irish' family to which Egerton 609 belongs, though in John I.1-VI.59 there is no striking agreement with any particular family or known witness. D adds at -the end of the Luke genealogy the following sortes , not paralleled in any other witness: '(qui fuit Dei) et Filii et Spiritus sancti. Qua cum angelis et archangelis, throni, dominationes, principatus et potestates et .xxiiii. senioribus, qui non cessant clamare et dicere una voce dicentes: Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus, Dominus Deus Sabaoth a quo originum (!) atque initium omni generi humano, salutariam confitentium bonitatem et misericordiam credentium, quia exaltatum nomen suum in super omne quod est celestium et terrestrium et infernorum ipse regem regnantium recolere, cui virtus auxilium liberare credentium benedictum nominare.' 38 McGurk, 'Text', pp. 51-2, where a distinctive error in the Mark preface (not in Trinity) and an unnecessary reading in John are shown to be shared by this group. In Mark 'Deum' is substituted unintelligibly for 'quoniam' in the concluding phrase: 'quoniam qui plantat et qui rigat unum sunt, qui autem incrementum Deus est'. In John the phrase 'qui etsi post omnes evangelium scripsisse dicitur' is repeated by another 'tarnen post omnes evangelium scripsiť. 39 Glunz, History of the Vulgate in England , pp. 141-7. 261</page><page sequence="12">Patrick McGurk and Jane Rosenthal Mark XI V.43 cum gladiis et lignis. This correct reading is given by F and by a corrected A and by a corrected Royal. The reading in C and the original reading in A and Royal was cum gladiis et Unguis. John 1.36 Iesum ambulantem as in A. C reads Iesum venientem ambulantem, F gives ambulantem as an alternative to venientem, Royal reads Iesum ambulantem venientem. There is frequent contact between the variant readings among the Judith manuscripts and those in Royal (sometimes supported by the other two scribe B manuscripts), a contact strongly suggesting membership of a common recension with shared corrections and alternative readings. Two readings might illustrate this close contact, though here only A and F of the Judith quartet have the text: Matt. III. 18 Royal and AF omit through eyeskip Alphei et Thaddeum et Simonem Cananeum Luke VI. 42 AF have et quomodo potes dicere fratri tuo erunt (! for frater) sine eiciam festucam de oculo tuo. The source of the clearly nonsensical erunt for frater seems to be a reading like Royal's which has fratri tuo Fr. sine at the point where Judith has nonsense and with a Fr. which looks rather like Er. It might be noted that AF both insert a question mark after fratri tuo, thus dividing the question. The question should read', et quomodo potes dicere fratri tuo frater sine eiciam festucam de oculo tuo ipse in oculo tuo trabem non videns? AF place a question mark after fratri tuo and at the end after uidens. There are differences from Royal, though, which the Judith witnesses share and which can be illustrated by one example in each gospel (readings from Royal are given second): Matt. XVIII. 33 nonne ergo against non ergo Mark 11.21 non adsumendum ( only AF here) against nemo adsumet Luke 1.23 implerentur ( only ACF here) against impleti sunt John VII. 29 adds after scio eum the words et si dixero quia nescio eum ero similis vobis mendax et scio eum ( last three words not in C). The addition is not in Royal. It should be noted also that the striking dislocation in the Luke genealogy in the two Judith books (AF) with this text is not in Royal.40 A significant number of the variant readings among the Judith Gospels was caused by careless errors, though it will always be difficult to estimate the 40 Herbert Köllner kindly drew Patrick McGurk's attention to a dislocation in the Luke genealogy shared by both F and A. In these books it is arranged in three columns. The genealogy is clearly meant to be read down each column in turn and not across the page line by line, but even so there are serious breaks in the sequence of progenitors. Thus the correct order of ancestors 8-18, for instance, is Matthathiae, Amos, Naum, Esli, Naggae, Maath, Matthathie, Semei, losech, Ioda, and Iohanna. In F and A the order is Matthathiae, Naum, Naggae, Matthathie, losech and Iohanna, where every other ancestor is skipped, presumably 262</page><page sequence="13">The Anglo-Saxon gospe ¡books of Judith , countess of Flanders proportion due to different exemplars or to the inattenti veness of a scribe. Some distinctive errors, different in kind from the others, can be attributed to one Judith scribe. These are the many mistakes found in the pages of A written by a second inferior scribe.41 Other particular mistakes, which occur in only one of the Judith books, might also be blamed, though not with the same certainty, on the principal Judith scribe. A few such examples might be put forward here: Matthew VI. 26 F has respicite volatilia caeli quoniam non sumpserunt (for serunt) neque metunt . . . Matthew X.13 D has si autem non fuerit indigna (for digna) Matthew XIX. 14 D has facilius est camelum per foramen amicus (for acus) Matthew XXV. 27 A has oportuit ergo te miserere (for mittere) pecuniam Mark IV.48 C has cum gladiis et Unguis (for lignis) Mark XV. 6 F has per diem autem festům dimittere solebat illis unum extinctis (for ex vinctis) quemcumque petissent Luke 1.36 F has et hic messis (for mensis) est sextus illi quae vocatur sterilis Luke XXII. 53 C has cum cotidie vobiscum sum fuerim in templo (where sum is clearly an unintended addition) The many instances of verses or phrases omitted through eyeskip, which incidentally demonstrate that no one of the Judith books could have been copied from another, could be imputed to an occasionally unsteady scribal eye. Their frequency in parts of C, in much of John for instance, could be signs of an increasing pace just as a clustering of gross errors might suggest temporary negligence.42 Some readings seem to stand in the way of a single exemplar. The most visually obvious is the Mark initial page in C. This has two significant variants, but it is just conceivable that one of these, which is not known in any other because the scribe of the archetype or exemplar of both was reading down, and not across, a genealogy arranged in two columns. 41 Some examples should suffice: Matt. 11.13 perdendum meum for perdendum eum; 11.16 ab ime for a bimatu; n Aegypto for in Aegypto; 11.23 in vitate for in civitate; VI. 16 culum for in cubiculum; XX VI. 60 plum for in templům; Mark 1.1 1 vax for vox; II.4 tecum for tectum. This scribe's Latin was as poor as his script. 42 It is worth noting that C changes its layout in Luke and John from one where paragraphs correspond to Eusebian sections to one with fewer paragraphs with the Eusebian sections simply represented by gold initials within a solid block of text. This change could also represent increasing scribal haste. In the 4 York Gospels' (York, Chapter Library Add. 1 (PChrist Church, Canterbury, c. 1000)), for instance, the same change in layout certainly coincides with a more rapidly executed script. 263</page><page sequence="14">Patrick McGurk and Jane Posenthal gospelbook, arose spontaneously through verbal echoes.43 But there are other variant readings which must be considered:44 MATTHEW 1 III. 14 venies C venis ADF St 2 IV. 12 audisset (vidisset F) audisset AD St Iesus CF 3 VII. 11 dabit spiritum bonum F dabit bona A DC St 4 VIII. 30 pasceris AF pascens DC St 5 XI. 16 Cum AO Qui F Cui C2 St (-)ui D 6 XI. 17 dicunt caecinibus vobis CF dicunt cecinimus vobis AD St 7 XII. 4 panes propositiones DXC panes propositionis AD2CF St 8 XIII. 5 alii D alia ACF St 9 XIII. 7 alii D alia ACF St 10 XIII. 8 alii D alia ACF St 11 XV. 20 haec sunt coinquinant AD haec sunt quae coinquinant F St 12 XVII. 5 in quo mihi bene conplacui ADC in quo mihi bene conplacuit F St 13 XVIII. 7 Vae homini illi DF Vae homini AC St 14 XX. 23 mecum DC meum 2 A St 15 XXIII. 16 intraverit .4 iuraverit1 2 C St 16 XXIII. 18 intraverit AC iuraverit1 St 17 XXIII. 18 intraverit C iuraverit A St 18 XXVII. 52 qui dormierunt surrexerunt DCF qui dormierant surrexerunt A St 19 XXVIII. 7 dixi ADF praedixiC57 MARK 20 1.1 filii Dei vivi C filii Dei ADF St 21 VI. 15 quasi unum ex prophetis CF quasi unus ex prophetis A St 22 XIV. 7 habebitis A habetis 2 CF St 23 XIV. 32 venerunt A veniunt CF St 24 XIV.43 linguis AXC lingnis A2 lignis F St 25 XIV.48 linguis C lignis AF St 26 XIV.69 rursum autem AC rursus autem A St LUKE 21 1.30 apud Dominum AC apud Deum F St 28 III. 9 ad radičem amborum AXF ad radičem arborum A2 St 29 IV. 29 ad supercilicium montis A ad supercilium montis F St 30 V.7 ita ut poene (ponere A) ita ut mergerentur St mergerentur AF 31 VII. 19 misit ad Iesum (eum F) ACF misit ad Dominum St 43 The Mark initial page in C reads: Tnitium evangelii lesu Christi filii Dei vivi sicut scriptum est in Isaiam prophetam.'

But recalling scholars' opinions on the hypothetical common exemplar which may lurk behind the Greek codices purpurei mentioned above, it is therefore worth examining first the above list more closely. Eyeskip could account for some variants. In 5 the 'Qui' of F for 'Cui' could have been taken from the word at the beginning of the previous verse. The gibberish of 6's 'dicunt caecinibus vobis' (CF) for 'dicunt cecinimus vobis' could have been caused by the pull of two ablative plurals (in 'ibus') in the 265</page><page sequence="16">Patrick McGurk and Jane Posenthal previous verse. 'Panes propositiones comediť (7 D!C) for 'panes propositio- ns comediť is nonsensical, and the case ending of the second word could have been influenced by that of the first. In 34, 'volens dimittem Iesum' (C) for 'volens dimitiere Iesum' might just possibly be due to the eye skipping to 'dimittam' in verse 22 below, though only negligence could account for A's 'dimittentte'. It is possible that ADC's addition of 'Iudei' (46) to 'responder- unt ei' is understandable emphasis of 'ei' or due to eyeskip, just as D's substitution of 'ergo' for 'ei' could be caused by another skip of the eye since a verse not very far back opens 'responderunt ergo Iudei'. A similar emphasis would account for the addition of 'Iesus' to 'audisset (Iesus)' in 2, and of 'tu' in 62 to 'quam (tu) non vis'. Echoes or harmonization could account for other variants. 20's 'filii Dei vivi' (C) for 'filii Dei' has already been mentioned as a possible candidate. 5's 'Cum autem' (AC1) for 'Cui autem' is an understandable error as so many verses begin with these two words. (This is a case where Judith witnesses disagree on their errors, for it has just been suggested that F has a mistake here ('Qui' for 'Cui') probably caused by eyeskip.) 'Vae homini illi' (DF) for 'Vae homini' in 13 could be an echo of the parallel passage in Luke XVII.l 'Vae autem illi'. Both 19's 'dixi' (ADF) for 'praedixi', and 52's 'quid faciemus' (C) for 'quid facimus' are known variants, but both could be echoes, the first from another verse, the second from the parallel passage in Acts VI. 16. 29's 'ad supercilicium montis' (A) for 'ad supercilium montis' could be the reverbe- ration of a variant known to the scribe. In 31 AC's 'misit ad Iesum' and F's 'misit ad eum' for 'misit ad Dominum' are unremarkable. And C's 'adimplean- tur' for 'impleantur' (in 55) strikes further registers. Three errors could be due to misunderstood letters: thus 'pasceris' (4 AF) for 'pascens', 'amborum' (28 AT) for 'arborum' and 'permansiit' (32 C) for 'pertransiit'. Stuttgart Scribal correction of obvious error could explain other differ- ences. Sometimes the witnesses seem to react differently to an obviously wrong reading, and a progress through errors might be postulated. Thus it is reasonable to think that in 24 and 25 the nonsensical 'cum gladiis et Unguis' (found in C in both 24 and 25, but in A1 only in 24) for 'cum gladiis et lignis' may have been in the scribe's exemplar, a reading easy to correct (thus recte A1 in 24 and F in both 24 and 25). In 41 C's 'adorarent' and Fps 'adorent' for 'adorant' ( recte AF2) could be a repetition of their own readings in 40 (C 'adorarent', F 'adorent'). In 44 only F has the correct 'esset eum' but it is possible that D's 'essed eum' may have led to AC's 'esset Deum'. In 43 'signavit' is the correct reading: AC's 'significavit' might be their way of giving the right tense to F's 'significai'. The mistakes 'cultorem' (49 A) and 'cultore' (C) for the correct 'cultor est' (D) could be based ultimately on a 266</page><page sequence="17">The Anglo-Saxon gospelhooks of Judith , countess of Flanders misunderstood 'cultor e' where an 'e' with a suspension sign could have stood for 'est'. 54's erroneous alternatives 'abiebanť (A1 D) and 'habebanť (C) for 'abibanť (F) could be solutions to a faulty reading which F put right. 56's 'sicut dixit' (D and probably A) was sensibly corrected by C's 'sicut dixi' towards which the corrected A may have been veering. These examples suggest a struggle with error and a final correction. Others suggest the scribe reaching the right reading in one witness: this might explain 'haec sunt quae coinquinant' (11 F) for 'haec sunt coinquinant' (AD); 'in quo mihi bene conplacuit' (12 F) for 'in quo mihi bene conplacui' (ADC); 'qui dormierant surrexerunt' (18 A) for 'qui dormierunt surrexerunť (DCF); 'quasi unus ex prophetis' (21 A) for 'quasi unum ex prophetis' (CF); 'dicit eis Iesus impiété' (37 F) for 'dicit ei Iesus impiété' (AC); 'vocat sponsum' (38 A2F2) for 'vocat sponsus' (A^F1); 'dicebąnt temptantes eum' (45 D) for 'dicebant temptans eum' (ACF); 'natus es' (50 C) for 'natus est' (AD); 'cum invenisset eum' (51 C) for 'cum venisset eum' (AD); 'et locum et gentem' (53 A) for 'locum et gentem' (DC); 'pepererit' (57 A2C) for 'peperit' (A1); 'separatim' (60 A) for 'separatum' (CF); and 'dicit eis Iesus venite' (61 C) for 'dicit ei Iesus venite' (AF). C's 'lux sum mundi' (48) could be a necessary correction of AD's silly 'luxum mundi', in origin itself possibly due to an erratic wobble of the eye. It is always possible that two witnesses could have made the same wrong reading independently of each other. Such a reading need not reflect a postulated common exemplar, which could in fact be revealed by the one correct witness. The scribe could err in one of the witnesses. Thus 'alii' (8, 9 and 10 D) for 'alia' {recte ACF) could be an involuntary error in one verse which the scribe repeated in the other two. In 15, 16 and 17 'iuraverit' is the correct reading and 'intraverit' is wrong: the evidence could suggest that 'intraverit' was consis- tently the reading for 'iuraverit' on four of the five occasions it appears in these verses, and that the scribe was only intermittently successful in correcting it. F gets 'rursus autem' (26) right against AC's 'rursum autem'. 30 'ita ut poene mergerentur' is F's reading (which has some Old Latin support): A's rendering 'ita ut ponere mergerentur' is among the more incomprehensible of scribal misreadings. F's 'cum ducerent' (35) could be a correction of AC's 'cum inducerenť. C in 42 realizes that 'labores' is a noun and not a verb when it changes AF's 'vos non labores' to 'vos in labores'. A's 'claritate' (58) is a misreading presumably of C's correct 'claritatem'. The erroneous 'si scires domum Dei' (39 CF) is corrected in A's 'si scires donum Dei'. There are instances where readings differ without obvious explanation. Possibilities are: 1 C 'venies' against ADF 'venis'; 22 A 'habebitis' against CF 'habetis'; 23 A 'venerunt' against CF 'veniunt'; 27 AC 'apud Dominum' for F 'apud Deum' 33 A 'miratae' against C 'admiratae'; 36 A 'non scitis' against CF 267</page><page sequence="18">Patrick McGurk and Jane Posenthal 'nescitis'; 40 C 'adorarent' against AF 'adorent'; 47 C 'quis ex vobis argueť against AD 'quis ex vobis arguiť; 55 C 'adimpleantur' against AD 'implean- tur'; 59 C 'sicut me dilexi' against A 'sicut me dilexisti'. Some of these are probably errors. Others are possibly echoes of other tenses or cases. It will always be impossible to prove that a common exemplar lay behind the sections of the four Judith books written by the same scribe when that exemplar does not survive. In the face of the many differences between readings noted in the above list and in the very much longer catalogue of variants apparently caused by carelessness to be published later, it might seem that differences are being explained away unconvincingly. It would have seemed perhaps more prudent to postulate multiple exemplars even though these must admittedly have been close to each other. What little is known about the resources of scribes and scriptpria in the early Middle Ages suggests an abundance of gospelbooks at the bigger centres and a very rapid contamination of text through unconscious and deliberate change. These considerations notwithstanding, it is possible to postulate a common exem- plar for the text of the main Judith scribe. In each of the books the scribe was at times extremely careless. There are sections in each copy where gross error, if not deliberate change, must surely account for many of the variants. It has been shown that the Judith books form a distinctive sub-group within a recognized sub-section of late Anglo-Saxon gospel texts. A case has been made for suggesting that many of the variants in the list above might be accounted for in various ways, and that therefore a common exemplar might be suggested as a working hypothesis. It is hoped at the very least that most of the evidence on which judgement might be made has been presented. The restriction of the gospel accessory texts in the four Judith books to the prefaces of Mark, Luke and John indicates a deliberate choice. One scribe wrote the greater part of the four books, possibly using a single exemplar which belonged to a textual recension found in the books of scribe B, a recension with its own distinctive 'Judith' variants. The second scribe who contributed the larger part of D used a different exemplar, but he too, though responsible for all the accessory texts, confined them to the same three prefaces as his colleague did in the other three books. Even if the text of preface and gospel used by the common scribe does not depend on a single exemplar, and even if the books could not be associated with one patron, their contents suggest a single plan. THE FUNCTION OF THE BOOKS The gospel text in three of the books is not complete; manuscript A alone had the full text of the gospels. All four books give the Passion and Resurrection chapters, though the selective gospels do not all begin their Passion texts at 268</page><page sequence="19">The Anglo-Saxon gospelhooks of Judith, countess of Flanders precisely the same point. C gives all of Matthew and John, but provides only a few passages in Mark and Luke apart from the complete Passion and Resurrection chapters. F omits a central portion of each gospel, though the proportion omitted varies from 25 per cent in Matthew to almost 50 per cent in Luke and John. D is the most complete of the three 'selective' books, though it also has a surprising number of gaps. The omissions were not accidental. They are unlikely to represent defective exemplars, since the scribe would surely have made good those omissions which were sizeable and obvious. Every scribe would know that Luke was the longest gospel and Mark the shortest, and in C they are both of the same severely truncated length. Nor can any of the gaps in text save for possibly one in D be accounted for by the loss of leaves or of quires. A break in text is not signalled: the text simply resumes on a new paragraph if the resumption coincides with a new Eusebian section; after a normal punctuating space or mark if it does not; or after a blank line or an announcing line of gold capitals if it opens the Passion narrative.45 Nor were the gaps in the text noted by later users of the books.46 The only possible accidental loss occurs in the John gospel in D. In that manuscript the scribe common to all four Judith books wrote all Matthew, and the second scribe Mark and Luke and their prefaces.47 In John this second scribe wrote the John preface and began and ended the gospel text. The common scribe wrote fols. 73-80 and 80v ends with XIII. 35 ('si dilectionem habueritis ad inuicem') while 81 r (by the second scribe) opens with the fourth word of the Passion text of XVIII. 1 ('Et subleuatis Iesus oculis in celum') and, rather suspiciously, this is not announced by any distinctive feature. The missing text could have been contained in a quaternion and here at least missing leaves might account for a sizeable gap in the text. The short gaps in the Mark and Luke texts written by the second scribe in D range from one to roughly six columns of the Stuttgart text.48 These short omissions might have suggested a mutilated exemplar where one or two or three leaves were missing. This possibility must be rejected for two reasons: none of the verses before a gap end in mid-stream, and it is difficult to equate the gaps with a possible number of missing leaves in a putative defective exemplar. Although this scribe was using a different text from his colleague's, he seems to follow the latter's practice of omitting passages even though none of these are substantial. It is not easy to account for the gaps. What is included does not seem to 45 In these books as in many others the opening of Passion texts is distinguished in some way: see above, n. 25. 46 One exception is in D where verses 23-6 from John XIII have been added later by a twelfth- century German hand. Small corrections were made by the Anglo-Saxon scribes, probably as they were writing. 47 The scribes in D are reproduced here in pls. IV-V. 48 Riblia Sacra iuxta Vulgátám Vers ione m, ed. Weber et al. 269</page><page sequence="20">Patrick McGurk and Jane Posenthal correspond to known liturgical needs, though the inclusion of complete Passion and Resurrection texts does occur in other 'selective' books, like the gospels of St Margaret (Oxford, Bodleian Library, Lat. lit. F. 5 (England, s. ximed)) or the probably liturgical 'Hereford Gospels' (Cambridge, Pembroke College 302 (England, s. ximed)) even when all these chapters and verses are not required liturgically. There are obvious parallels in the selected passages from John attached to the early-ninth-century Sto we Missal (Dublin, Royal Irish Academy D. II. 3, fols. 1-1 1 (PTallaght, s. viii/ix)) or in the selections from the synoptic gospels in the tenth-century Book of Deer (Cambridge, University Library, Ii. 6. 32 (PScottish centre, s. x)) but the selections in both seem different in scope from those in the three Judith gospels.49 It is true that a detailed examination of other gospelbooks might reveal texts truncated in similar ways, but many pre-tenth-century books are well known and do not show such omissions, and gaps as substantial as those in Mark and Luke in Č would surely have been reported.50 There is at least a consistent pattern to the omissions in F where a sizeable central chunk in each gospel is skipped, but it is difficult to explain either its purpose or the variation (ranging, as has just been said, from 25 per cent in Matthew to 50 per cent in Luke and John) in the proportion of text omitted. Certainly F provides the Christmas and Easter passages in all four gospels, but so much else is given besides. It could be argued that for a bare narrative the gospel of Matthew made unnecessary much of Mark and Luke, but F is clearly not a gospel harmony, and much of what is omitted in Matthew is also missing from the other three gospels. The omissions in F remain unexplained. Those in D are also perplexing. With the exception of sizeable chunks in Matthew and John, they are relatively short. Whereas a lost quire could account for the chapters omitted from John, the big gap in Matthew from XXI. 15 to XXV. 46 cannot be similarly explained. It might be worth looking closely at what D omits here. Matt. XXI. 15-17 goes best with the previous verses dealing with the expulsion of the dealers from the Temple; verses XXI. 18-27 deal with the episode of the wasting of the fig tree and the questioning of Jesus's authority by the chief priests and elders of the Temple. Both occur in Mark and Luke though the story of the barren fig tree was to be omitted by the scribe of those gospels. The next verses XXI. 28-32 give the parable of the two sons which is not found in the other gospels. Whilst most of 49 The gospel attached to the Sto we Missal is made up of selected excerpts from John, whilst in the Book of Deer the gospel of John is the only complete text, Matthew probably, and Mark and Luke certainly, being deliberately left unfinished, their texts ending respectively at VII. 22, V.35 and IV. 1. For Deer, see K. Hughes, The Book of Deer', in her Celtic Britain in the Parly Middle Ages (Woodbridge, 1980), pp. 22-37. 50 It must be admitted, though, that the gaps in C had not hitherto been reported. 270</page><page sequence="21">The Anglo-Saxon gospelbooks of Judith, countess of ¥ landers ch. XXII is paralleled in both Mark and Luke, much of the next chapter (XXIII) dealing with the scribes and Pharisees is not reproduced elsewhere in the gospels. Much of ch. XXIV on the beginning of sorrows, the great tribulation of Jerusalem, the warning of the coming of the son of man and the parable of the conscientious steward is also found in Luke, though it should be noted that the passages paralleled with Mark are left out in that gospel. If the two parables at the opening of ch. XXV (verses 1-30) are found in Mark and Luke, the long passage on the Last Judgement (verses 31-46) is peculiar to Matthew. The large chunk of text omitted in Matthew cannot therefore be explained by its being adequately covered elsewhere in the manuscript. It is no easier to account for the other omissions in the same manuscript. Take first the three made by the common scribe. Matt. XIII.53-XIV.21 contain three separate items: Jesus's visit to Nazareth (XIII. 53-8), the beheading of John the Baptist (XIV. 1-12) and the first miracle of the loaves (XIV. 13-21). It is true that each episode is adequately covered in the other gospels: the first in Mark VI. 1-6, the second in Mark VI.4-29 and the third in each of the other three gospels (Mark VI. 30-44, Luke IX. 10-17 and John VI. 1-1 3); but this does not explain why the Matthew accounts were selected for omission, nor why three accounts of the miracle of the loaves were transcribed. Matt. XIII covers seven parables: the Judith scribe omits four of these (verses 24-43) in the middle, but their gap is not obvious or disturbing to sense as the chapter's opening and concluding words have not been lost. One of the omitted parables (verses 24-30, that of the darnel), however, is not found in any of the other gospels. The brief omission in John of four and a half verses (XIII. 23-7 ťintroiuit in ilium Satanas') or two Eusebian sections (123 and 124) again does not seriously affect the sense, though it disturbs the narrative as the omitted verses would have made more intelligible Jesus's words (immediately after the break in verse 27) asking Judas to act more quickly. Perhaps here the simplest explanation is that the scribe came to omit, whether deliberately or not, two Eusebian sections. Thus no clear reason can account for the big gap in Matthew and the much shorter ones in Matthew and John. It is as hard to account for the omissions by the second scribe in Mark and Luke. There are three in Mark and five in Luke. The first gap in Mark, of X. 29-32, is perplexing. Verses 29-31 are relatively self-contained and their omission does not affect the sense in the way that the dropping of verse 32 does (this is an essential introduction to Jesus's statement in verse 33). Three possible explanations might be put forward: the scribe was arbitrary or careless, a leaf in the exemplar was mutilated at this point, the scribe meant to start with the new Eusebian section at verse 32 but the words 'in Hierosloyma' shared by verses 32 and 33 made him inadvertently skip the intervening text. 271</page><page sequence="22">Patrick McGurk and Jane Posenthal The dropping of XI. 4-11 (or Eusebian sections 118-20) in the next gap in Mark (XI.4-13) is as unfortunate since it cuts an essential part of the episode of the tethered colt and the entry into Jerusalem. The omission here seems arbitrary. The last gap in Mark (XIII. 14- 37) is more substantial. It leaves out part of the same subjects also omitted in Matthew by the other scribe, and seems deliberate. The five sizeable omissions in Luke range from three verses (XXIII. 54-6) or two Eusebian sections (334-5) to fifty four (XII.41-XIV.1). With the exception of the gap formed by XIV. 12-1 6 ('At ipse dixit ei') which ends in mid- verse, they do not begin or end in midstream, and their omission does not seriously disturb the gospel narrative. Most of the passages or phrases left out are found in the other gospels (though none are found in precisely the same context) and it was noted that the parable of the barren fig tree, for instance, omitted from Luke was also cut from Matthew and Mark. The dropping of XXIII. 54-6, which describe the arrival of the women at the tomb and their preparation of spices and ointments, is a surprising gap in a Passion account. Taken together with the ten shorter gaps in Luke - an unusually large number - these five larger omissions suggest a careless and arbitrary scribe. The evidence from Bonifatius Fischer's selective collations of passages from over 450 gospels suggests that so many gaps in one codex were rare and that a high proportion of these were subsequently made good.51 The second scribe seems less concerned with reproducing a complete gospel text than in maintaining a sound calligraphic standard, and this attitude was shared in D by his colleague. Scribal whim or pressure of time could well account for the manuscript's textual deficiencies. Perhaps as remarkable as these imperfec- tions is the subsequent failure to remedy them. C is different.52 It cuts only two of the gospels, Mark and Luke. The full gospel texts of Matthew and John can be said to offer a striking contrast to each other. Matthew emphasizes the humanity, John the divinity, of Jesus, their differing emphases being announced at the outset, the former opening with Christ's human genealogy, the latter with the divine Logos: between them they provide a holistic account of Christ in his two natures. The passages from the other two gospels are relatively restricted, but they have not been selected arbitrarily. As has already been noted above, the inclusion of the full Passion and Resurrection texts is also followed in the two other late Anglo- Saxon 'selective' gospelbooks, the 'Gospels of St Margaret', and the probably 51 Omitted phrases and passages are relatively few in Fischer's apparatus. In contrast, in D in Luke the second scribe omits eleven phrases or verses (nine through eyeskip) in addition to the longer omissions noted above. 52 Jane Rosenthal is responsible for the following hypothesis on C's use. Note that the already- mentioned Book of Deer has the complete text of John but only incomplete versions of the other gospels. 272</page><page sequence="23">The Anglo-Saxon gospelhooks of Judith y countess of ¥ landers liturgical 'Hereford Gospels'. An examination of the other Mark and Luke excerpts in C suggests the passages were chosen for several reasons. Some record important episodes from the life of Christ omitted in the full texts of Matthew and John, the most obvious being the accounts exclusive to Luke (LI -II. 52) of the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity and Childhood of Christ. Others were chosen deliberately for their suitability for personal reading: those in Mark stress the ministry of Christ and his powers of healing (1.14-28, VI. 30-4 and VII.31-VIII.26); those in Luke, read in sequence, provide a guide to the teachings of Christ (VII.31-5, VII.36-50 and X.21-XI.28), including the last of his teachings before the Passion (XI.34-8). Particularly striking are the three sections devoted to women, which could be regarded as appropriate for a female patron: the long passage on the penitent woman (Luke VII.36-50), the three verses on the women following Jesus (Luke VIII. 1-3) and the account of Mary and Martha (Luke X. 38-42). 53 Finally, care was taken that the chosen passages followed each other easily and readably, providing a seamless, coherent narrative which bears no evidence of the divisions between passages or the gaps of several chapters or more which intervene in the original text. A strong case can therefore be made for regarding C as a book designed for the personal devotional use of its patron, Judith, in her meditations on the life of Christ.54 If there seems an explanation for the strange selections in C, there seems none comparably satisfactory for the inclusions and omissions in F or D. No precise liturgical principles can be discerned behind the selections. It might be suggested that F would have served for Christmas and Easter, but as has been already pointed out it gives so very much more in the first half of the gospels than the story of Christmas. The omissions in D by both scribes range from three or four verses to very many more. One, the big gap in John before the Passion text, might be due to a lost quire, though this like the comparable gap in Matthew might be caused by a sustained wish to cut texts immediately before the Passion to which both F and C seem to bear witness. A few might just be due to a defective archetype. Others, particularly those of a few verses, could be due to scribal carelessness or a relative indifference to sense or completeness. Any hypothesis explaining the selections in the Judith books must also face up to the books' purpose. It will be argued later that Judith ordered the books in Anglo-Saxon 53 The possible particular associations of Judith with Mary Magdalen will be further examined by Jane Rosenthal in her study of the Crucifixion illumination in A. 54 It might be noted that F. E. Warren, 'The Evangelistarium of St Margaret of Scotland', The Academy 800 (3 September 1887), 151, thought that the 'St Margaret Gospels' were intended 'not for public church use but for private devotion'. Jane Rosenthal hopes to publish a study in the near future on 'selective' gospelbooks in later Anglo-Saxon England. 273</page><page sequence="24">Patrick McGurk and Jane Posenthal England not all that long before her exile in 1065, and that she had one of them completed in Flanders before her marriage to Weif IV in 1070 or 1071. Three of the books, those now at New York and Fulda, were certainly at Weingarten in the Middle Ages, and it was assumed above (pp. 253-6) that they were probably bequeathed to that house in 1094, that is some twenty years after they had been commissioned. The reasons why they were made in England may no longer have applied after Judith's exile, and their function could well have changed after they had been given away. A manuscript could, for instance, have been intended for liturgical use by a benefactor, but its princely associations or precious metal covers could have caused it to be treated quite differently by a beneficiary. If they were originally meant as gifts to established houses or to Judith's friends, completeness of text or a clearly planned selection of gospel extracts would surely have been thought necessary. One possible purpose would have been use in a capella . This receives indirect support from the statement in Bernold of Constance's chronicle (which was completed shortly before his death in 1100, six years after Judith's death) that Judith gave her capella to Weingarten.55 On this view, A could have been the book meant for most use in the chapel, D could have been a back-up copy useful for most occasions, F the volume clearly useful for Christmas and Easter and C, slightly smaller than the other three, could have been intended for personal reading.56 At Weingarten by the later twelfth century, Judith was said to have given the relic of the Holy 55 Bernold, Chronicon , s.a. 1094, in MGH, SS 5 (Hannover, 1844), 457-8: 'Iuditha uxor ducis Welfonis Baioariae, iam diu infirmata, et ea castigatione non parum meliorata, diem clausit extremum .iiii. Nonas martii, et apud monasterium, quod maritus eius in honorem sancti Martini in proprio allodio construxit, a Gebehardo Constantiensi episcopo honorifice sepelitur; ad quod monasterium maritus eius dux capellam ipsius tradidit, quae in auro et argento et preciosissimis paramentis mille libras pene valuit, idemque monasterium in possessionibus centum pene mansis melioravit; sicque melioratum et de sua potestate emancipatum sancto Petro sub iure tributario contradidit, ut apostolicae sedi principaliter subiacerat, et sub eius defensione, ut alia libera monasteria, iure perpetuo polieret. ' The manuscript of this chronicle might be an autograph. 56 The books may have been intended for some liturgical use but misreadings in the John gospel for Good Friday might suggest that this text at least was not used: in XVIII. 3 ACF have 'arinis' for 'armis' and ACDF 'faucibus' for 'facibus'; in XIX. 12 C has 'nos es' for 'non es*; in XIX. 31 F has 'erant enim' for 'erat enim', XIX. 32 'cura' for 'crura'. In the Luke Passion week reading (XXII.1-XXIII.53) D has an eyeskip at XXIII. 39-40. Francis Newton's hypothesis (which will be mentioned below) associates the Monte Cassino book with the volume known to have been given by the Empress Agnes at the dedication of the new basilica of Monte Cassino, and this was recorded as being richly bound. See Leo Marsicanus, Chronicon , in MGH, SS 7 (Hannover, 1846), 722: 'evangelium cum tabula fusili de argento, opere anaglifo pulcherrime deaurato'. Even if it is true, it does not mean that the volume was bound before it left Judith's possession. For the evidence that F had a rich metal cover, see above, p. 254 and below, pp. 278 and 290. 274</page><page sequence="25">The Anglo-Saxon gospelbooks of Judith, countess of Flanders Blood of Christ to the monastery, and the two frontispieces in A and F could be regarded as particularly appropriate for a capella containing such a relic.57 As Judith apparently did not have the relic of the Holy Blood before 1067, the illustrations could have been designed to illustrate the capella! s dedication to Christ. It seems possible that these books were always meant to be bound as sumptuously as the two Morgan books are now and as F is known to have been so in the eighteenth century. Finally two possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive, can be mentioned. The books may have been made essentially for symbolic or ceremonial use for members of a household or capella , and therefore not intended for daily or weekly employment, and knowledge of this purpose may have led a careless scribe to cut and occasionally mangle his sacred text.58 Arthur Haseloff was the first to associate three of the books, the two now in New York, and the one in Fulda, with the bequest by Weif IV, Judith and their sons to Weingarten on 12 March 1094, which is entered on the last leaf of F.59 There four books are referred to: 'tria plenaria cum uno textu evangelii'. This would seem to describe one gospelbook and three liturgical books, since 'plenarium' usually describes a liturgical selection of readings from the epistles and the gospels. There would seem therefore to be difficulties in the way of identifying the 'plenaria' with any of the Judith gospelbooks. One solution has been to stretch its meaning at Weingarten to embrace the Judith books.60 There would seem to be at least four possible interpretations of the words. First, they refer to none of the Judith books. Second, they refer to three (now lost) liturgical 'plenaria' as well as to one of the Judith gospels, presumably the 57 The probably late-twelfth-century addition to the legend of the Holy Blood, De inventione et translatione Sanguinis Domini in MGH, SS 15 (Hannover, 1888), 921-3, with Judith at 923. See the recent discussion of the evolution of the legend by N. Kruse, 'Der Weg des Heiligen Bluts von Mantua nach Altdorf-Weingarten', and 'Die historischen Heilig-Blut-Schriften der Weingartner Klostertradition', Festschrift ^um Heilig-Blut- Jubiläum am 12 Marę 1994 , ed. Kruse and Rudolf I, 57-76 and 77-123. Note that Judith is said not to have acquired the relic of Holy Blood until the death of Baldwin V in 1067. 58 This hypothesis would require both scribes in D to have been occasionally deliberately negligent. 59 A. Haseloff, 'Aus der Weingartner Klosterbibliothek', Deutsche Literatur^eitung (1905), pp. 1998-2002. 60 This is implied in most of the literature, starting with Haseloff and Löffler, though it is not always made clear that the entry in the Judith donation, if, as seems likely, it refers to books, speaks of four and not three codices. Weingarten sources later than the 1094 donation transcribed in F associate Judith with the gift of 'plenariis': thus, the Weingarten necrology (MGH, Necrologia Germaniae I, 221-32) says 'Judita dux regina Anglie, hic sepulta, dédit preciosissimum thesaurům ecclesie, Sanguinem Domini, cum reliquiis sanctorum, palliis et plenariis'; the De inventione et translatione Sanguinis Domini , MGH, SS 15 (Berlin, 1888), 923, 'praecipuum et incomparabilem thesaurum in auro et argento . . . cum capella et ecclesiasticis ornamentis, palliis, scriniis, plenariis . . .' 275</page><page sequence="26">Patrick McGurk and Jane Posenthal complete A. Third, the interpretation of Weingarten usage of 'plenaria' is correct, and the entry records the grant of the four Judith Anglo-Saxon books; but as there is no evidence that C was ever at Weingarten, a fourth possibility could be that the three plenaria included D and F, and another Judith book, either one now lost or just possibly the incomplete Flemish gospelbook. (Stuttgart, Württembergische Landesbibliothek, Hb. II. 46 (Liège workshop, s. xii)) which is studied in Appendix B. The identification of at least D and F with two 'plenaria' has been made more plausible by two new observations. First, the two books are now seen to be selective, not complete, and thus could be (mis)taken for liturgical books. Second, eleventh- and twelfth-century German evidence outside Weingarten certainly mentions 'plenaria' apparently made up only of the gospels.61 Three instances could suffice: (i) 'tradidit . . . plenarium iiii ewangeliorum, epistolare i, librum sacramentam' (charter of 903). 62 (ii) Si domnus abba . . . praesens fuerit, . . . acerram ipsi deferì (sc. diaconus), incensum ut thuribulo imponat, postulatamque ab eo benedictionem reportât, et tunc sacerdos nihilominus plenarium desuper per signum crucis faciens incensai. Diaconus . . . finito evangelio dat librum subdiacono ( c . 1077- 9). 63 (iii) deinde quasi volumen evangelii plenum, quod dicimus plenarium competenter veneramur . . . (mid-twelfth century).64 What of C? It has no connections with Weingarten. The only internal evidence for its history are some German names added to p. 238, and some matter in a fourteenth-century Italian hand on p. 240.65 The Welf connection with central Italy through Matilda, countess of Tuscany provides a possible channel for the book, but there are no records of Welf book donations or bequests to Monte Cassino. The Empress Agnes, as Francis Newton has pointed out, gave a luxury gold-covered gospelbook to Monte Cassino on the 61 Patrick McGurk is grateful to Dr Peter Dinter of the Mittellateinisches Wörterbuch in Munich for generous help and for providing him with references, including those listed below. 62 He gave a plenarium of the four Gospels, one epistolary and a sacramentary : Urkundenbuch des Landes ob der Enns, herausgegeben von Verwaltungs-Auschluss des Museums Francisco-Carolinum %u Lin ç, 8 vols.

The abbot should put the incense in the censer, make the blessing asked for by him, and, as well as making the sign of the cross over the plenarium , he should wave incense over it.

If this was the Anglo- Saxon gospels, Judith could well have handed it over to the empress after her marriage to Weif IV in 1070-1. 66 Its association with Agnes could explain the names added at the end of the gospel of John, which might be those of her children.67 When the manuscript was rebound recently no record was made of earlier binding structures, but the probability in any case was that it had been rebound in the eighteenth century like so many other Monte Cassino books.68 If it was Agnes's gift, there is no means of telling whether the precious metal cover recorded had been added by Judith or Agnes. If, as was suggested above, the book was for Judith's private reading, then the metal cover need not have been added until Judith had parted, or was about to part, with the book. Having reached Monte Cassino, there is no internal evidence of its use, except as a German visitors' book. There is certainly no sign of the use of so impractical a book in the liturgy in a monastery which was in any case so well equipped. If Löffler's identifications are correct, the other three Judith Anglo-Saxon books were kept as treasury manuscripts in 1753, each with a precious metal cover.69 It must be assumed that the two Morgan books had their present metal covers when donated in 1094. These covers are probably of eleventh- century date, and art historians have suggested either Anglo-Saxon England or Flanders as their places of origin.70 Both manuscripts have had their boards covered with the pink skin which is used to repair the bindings of so many Weingarten manuscripts.71 This pink skin also covered the boards of the 66 The hypothesis was generously related to Patrick McGurk by Professor Newton, who gave him a copy of a talk he had given on the subject. 67 The names at the foot of p. 238 include 'Henricus, Adelaita, Henricus, Auta', and they could be those of Agnes's children who were alive at the time of the dedication of the basilica. These names are written in the lower margin of p. 238, which is the penultimate page of John, and where they are followed by other (mainly German) names (see description on p. 295 and pl. X). Newton suggested that these names were transferred to this page from a now lost fly- leaf which was used for visitors' signatures. 68 Patrick McGurk owes this information to Dom Faustino Avagliano, the archivist of Monte Cassino. 69 Löffler, Die Handschriften des Klosters Weingartens , pp. 147-8. The earliest reference to Judith's books being in the treasury is in Hess, Prodromus monumentorum Guelficorum seu catalogus abbatum imperialis monasterii W eingartensis (Kempten, 1781), pp. 64-5, where he speaks of Berthold's Missal 'in sacrario cum antiquioribus a Juditha Guelfi IV uxore oblatis etiamnum servatur'. 70 Some discussion in P.

Felix Heinzer has plausibly suggested that the recovering was carried out during the abbacy of Berthold.72 The books must have been treasured before and after his abbacy. Their function and use at Weingarten will be considered below. The evidence of the Fulda binding must first be discussed. It had a metal binding when it was at the treasury in 1753, but this must have been lost by the nineteenth century, perhaps by the time of the French visitation in 1806. At present its medieval boards are covered with brown leather bearing on the reverse Weingarten stamps of probably fifteenth- or sixteenth-century date.73 The holes on the front certainly testify to the metal plaques which caused Löffler to identify it with one of the Treasury manuscripts.74 If the date of these plaques is unrecoverable, the history of the book's binding was different from that of the other two. Its boards look later than those of the two Morgan books, and there are no traces of the pink skin repairs found in them. If its metal plaques were eleventh-century, then it could be that the binding survived until the later Middle Ages when it was rebound and later repaired. The bindings of all three needed repairing during the Middle Ages. This surely suggests that they were used at the very least in a limited way. So far as can be told bindings were not repaired unnecessarily in the Middle Ages in the way they quite often were when acquired by a private collector or private library later, and the evidence of the eighth-century binding of the admittedly small 'Stonyhurst Gospels' (London, BL Loan 74, on loan from the English Province of the Society of Jesus (Wearmouth-Jarrow, c. 698)) shows that bindings survive in a pristine condition if a book is hardly used. Since Haseloff art historians have suggested that the illumination of two of the Judith books influenced twelfth-century Weingarten illumination, and on this view one might assume at least that the books were very occasionally looked at by artists.75 All three books were the subject of extremely limited correction and repunctuation by twelfth-century German hands.

There are marks made by the pen or stylus in the margins of both F and A, but these show at the most a very limited liturgical use.77 The absence of Eusebian sections would in any case have made the location of particular passages more difficult since lections in capitularies are always given the appropriate Eusebian reference.78 The Passion narratives, which were more or less complete in them all, were marked out conventionally by the original hand(s) in nearly all instances for reading by various voices.79 On a blank leaf at the end of F the John gospel reading for Pentecost (which was among the omissions in the Anglo-Saxon portion) was elaborately laid out by an early-twelfth-century Weingarten hand, and this surely suggests its use on that feast. Copies of important documents were added at the opening and at the end of both F and D. In F two Judith-Welf bequests were added, one the already-mentioned Welf bequest entered in a late-twelfth-century hand, the other also in a late- twelfth-century hand on either side of the John Pentecost lesson; and on its first leaf was entered a brief and partly inaccurate account of Weingarten. D had copies of later documents: two dedications, one of the basilica in 1 183, and one of the Capella of St Leonard in 1124, and one notification by Abbot Berthold probably of 1207. It is interesting that the Judith documents are copied in F. The books were prized possessions, prized not merely because of 76 In D, the corrections and repunctuation are on 59r and are for Luke XIX. 2-10. This passage is the lection for Frere's Standard series 'natalis papae' In A they are on 141 v-148r and cover John XII.8-XVII.26. The missing words added in the margin are on 146v. In F they are on 86v and cover John XX. 19-31. This passage is included in the lection in Frere's Standard series 'pascha .vii.' 77 A list of the marked passages is found in the description of the two manuscripts; see below, pp. 290 and 300. The following marginal marks in A correspond to the lections shown: at Matt. XIII. 24, the opening of Frere's Standard 34 (fifth week after the Theophany, Surtday); at Luke V.12 and V.15, the opening and the end of Frere's Standard 22 (third week after Theophany, feria .vi.); at John VIII. 31 and VIII.47, the opening and the end of Frere's Standard 288 ('pro ordinationibus' or other alternatives). There are very few marks in F, all being made by the stylus, and only Matt. VII. 15 ('ebd. .iii. post natal, apostolorum') and Matt. X.37 (St Laurence) correspond to masses in Frere's Standard series, though some alternative ferias might possibly explain some others. It might be worth noting that in Matt. X.37, the passage marked by a stylus is defective since it almost immediately opens with a phrase omitted through eyeskip: 'et qui amat filium aut filiam super me non est me dignus'. 78 The clearly liturgical marks added in Tironian notes in the ninth century to the Italian sixth- century gospels, London, BL Harley 1775, for instance, sometimes only show the end of a lection. It is likely that the opening would have been easily identified by the marginal Eusebian references. 79 For marks for the reading of the Passion, see above, n. 25. 279</page><page sequence="30">Patrick McGurk and Jane Posenthal the connection with Judith, but also possibly because of a later association with a capella of the Holy Blood. Perhaps Judith had used these three books in her capella , and at Weingarten they came to be associated with the special relic of the Holy Blood. It might be supposed then that the three books functioned in this limited way, and were looked at very occasionally - their relatively fresh appearance might support such a view - but that this occasional use was sufficient to place a strain on bindings which had to support luxury metal covers. THE MAKING OF THE BOOKS In these luxury books, gold is used extensively in the text for the text capitals, for rubrics and for those first lines written in capitals, and in the illuminated pages. Two such illuminated pages open each gospel, one with an evangelist portrait, the second with an opening initial and with lines of display capitals. In addition, as was noted above, A and F each has a frontispiece to the whole book, showing respectively illuminations of the Crucifixion and of the presentation of a book to Christ, and it is curious that the first quire in these two books seems to have been written after the second quire. This section will consider first, the order in which script and illumination were applied and second, the problems raised by the first quires in A and in F. The gold initials in the text and the headings to the prefaces were added after the text has been laid out.80 Confirmation of this obvious point can be seen in the many initials which were missing, particularly in D, and the frequently absent headings and rubrics. It is also clear, where the evidence of guided compass point pricking permits, that the illuminated pages were done after the text had been written.81 These prickings were made by a compass point to guide the circles (whether of halos or medallions) on the illuminated pages, and sometimes they can be seen to go through script on the verso, and once or twice on the succeeding recto, thus demonstrating that the script on the verso of initial pages had been written before they were laid out for illumination by the artist and that the artist worked on a gathering which was already held together in some way, presumably by quire tacketing.82 On the initial pages, it is certain that the lines of display capitals were executed last after all the illumination had been finished: the way in which the awkward display capitals on the initial pages in A avoided decorated initials or 80 Gold initials mark the unnumbered Eusebian sections. The brown initials used intermit- tently by the second scribe in D never announce such sections. 81 On compass points, see the introduction, by M. Gullick, to A Iweljth-Century working Alphabet of Initial Letters from Tuscany (Hitchin, 1979), p. 8, nn. 1, 9 and 11. 82 'Quire-tacketing' is Michael Gullick's term, and is studied in his forthcoming paper in the Roger Powell memorial volume. 280</page><page sequence="31">III New York, the Pierpont Morgan Library, M. 709, 42v.

The display capitals in all four books seem to have been executed by the scribes: the poor scribe did A's, the common scribe C's, the Low Countries scribe F's, and the second scribe of D may have done D's.83 There was a difference in the layout of gospel text between the two scribes in D. The scribe common to all books laid out the text in paragraphs correspond- ing to Eusebian or chapter divisions. The second scribe wrote his text in a block, thus providing visual confirmation of his use of a different exemplar, which the textual evidence also suggests. The common scribe and the A and F scribes who wrote after him in those books likewise laid out their text in paragraphs. This common scribe could change his lay out. In C he switches to a more solid block-like appearance in Luke and John, a lay out which may not have been taken over from his exemplar, but which could indicate greater haste in writing. A different artist worked in each manuscript. The differences between the illumination in A and D are as striking as the contrasts between their frames and display capitals. The layout and style of the illuminated pages in C is different from both A and D. The continental script, display capitals, and illumination in F which completed the book are also found in the so-called Manasses Sacramentary (Paris, BN lat. 819): it is possible that here one Low Countries scribe-artist was responsible for both.84 The question whether the 83 This is on the likely assumption that the same person was responsible for the gold capitals in the text marking Eusebian sections and for the display capitals. One hand is responsible for the text capitals in C and F. These are well balanced and orderly, have relatively few serifs, and are notable for a slightly squashed and rounded E and C, and the display capitals in C (but not of course the continental ones in F) share the same features. In A the text capitals are sometimes weak and poorly balanced, and often have a straggling capital A, and these characteristics are shared by A's display capitals. In D the text capitals in both scribes' stints were unlike those in A, C and F, being rather heavy and serifed, with a distinctive A and an I with no serif on the top right or bottom left of the upright, and were probably the work of D's second scribe. D's display capitals are distinctive, and it is just possible that they were also his work. The gold minuscule script on the Matthew and John initial pages in C was certainly written by the scribe of that manuscript but it is doubtful whether the gold writing on the open books held by Matthew and John in A were the work of the poor scribe. For reproductions of the initial pages in ACD, see Anglo-Saxon Textual Illustrations. Photographs of Sixteen Manuscripts with Descriptions and Index , ed. T. H. Ohlgren, Medieval Institute Pubi., Western Michigan Univ. (Kalamazoo, MI, 1992) where A, 3r, 49r, 78r and 123r are found in pls. 11.4, 11.6, 11.8 and 11.10; C, pp. 3, 103, 127 and 167 are in pls. 13.2, 13.4, 13.6 and 13.8; and D, 3r, 27r, 43r and 67r are in pls. 12.3, 12.5, 12.7 and 12.9 respectively. 84 The identification of the illuminator in part of that sacramentary with that in F can be best approached via Khin-Meuse. Art et civilisation 800-1400 (Cologne and Brussels, 1972), pp. 229- 30 with bibliography. Herbert Köllner first suggested to Patrick McGurk that the first scribe of the Paris sacramentary also wrote in F. This scribe certainly wrote the gold script in F and was almost certainly responsible for the purple background on the first pages of Matthew in F. One scribe-artist was probably at work in both books. 281</page><page sequence="40">Patrick McGurk and Jane Kosenthai illumination of A, D and C was the work of the scribes of those manuscripts will be considered in a later publication. Of the four books, C, to judge by completed initials and inserted headings or titles, seems the most finished. Later Anglo-Saxon scribes seem to have been unusually negligent in this respect and, outside C, the Judith scribes are no exceptions. The two scribes in D could have been working simultaneously on the first three gospels since Matthew, the common scribe's contribution, was written on quite separate quires from Mark and Luke. In John, however, the two worked in sequence since the text of the common scribe's single quire of John (which is sandwiched between two quires of his colleague's) starts in mid-sentence. In F and A there were problems with the first quire which were not happily resolved, and are difficult today to understand. In both, the second quire seems to have been written before the first. Thus in F the last page of the first quire written by an Anglo-Saxon hand (lOv) ends with Matthew VI. 6 'Turn (!) autem cum orabis intra' and just under half the page is left blank. In A, the first quire is written by the inferior scribe (whose poor understanding of Latin and of the gospels has already been noted). This ends with Matthew VI. 15 'nec Pater vester dimittet peccata vestra' and one line blank. A possible explanation of this sequence might be that the contents of the first quire and of its illumination had not been worked out, and the scribe went ahead with the text of the second quire.85 The decision to have frontispiece illuminations illustrating Judith may not have been taken. The explanation is weak since illuminations could surely have been added on inserted leaves, but it must be borne in mind.86 In any case the problems of the order in which the first two quires were written are more complicated than has just been suggested. Take A first. The first quire was written by the second inferior scribe after the second quire had been completed. Its make-up is shown here: 1,2, 3, 4, 5, /6, 7, 8, -, 9 with the Crucifixion on lv, the Matthew picture on the verso of the singleton fol. 2, the Matthew initial page on 3r, and all the gospel text on 3v-9v written by the same poor scribe. This quire is not numbered on the final verso as the quires written by the main scribe were. That this second scribe wrote after the first seems confirmed by his second intervention in A. It occurs on the verso of 85 It should be noted that the second quire in A and F does not begin with the same text. This would not be surprising, since even if the same exemplar was being followed by both books the layout and the number of lines in the two were not identical. 86 In A the frontispiece illumination of the Crucifixion is an integral part of the quire where the Matthew portrait is on an inserted leaf. 282</page><page sequence="41">The Anglo-Saxon gospelbooks of Judith, countess of Y landers the Mark initial page which is a conjugate to a leaf in Matthew which he also wrote. The quire's make-up is as follows: 42, -, 43, 44, 45, / 46, 47, -, 48, 49 with the Matthew portrait on the verso of the singleton fol. 48, the Matthew initial page on 49r, and the gospel text on the conjugate fols. 42-9 written by the second scribe. Again the extra line of script added at the bottom of a leaf (in this case 42v, see pl. Ill) suggests that this folio was written after the subsequent page. Again there is (unusually) no quire number on the last leaf 49r (which is in the second scribe's hand). And again, oddly enough, the evangelist portrait page (that of Mark) is a singleton. It is likely therefore that the conjugate made up of fols. 42-9 was a replacement leaf for a cancelled bifolium almost certainly in the main scribe's hand. This makes it possible that the first quire was also a replacement for a quire originally also in the same scribe's hand, or at the least that it was a later addition made when a decision on the contents of the first gathering had been taken. And when the replacements were made it would seem likely that the main scribe was no longer available. Certainly the gold text capitals through- out the book as well as the display capitals were the work of the poor scribe. The position at the opening of F is more complicated. All the illumination in F is the work of an identifiable Low Countries artist. In Mark, Luke and John it is very likely that he worked after the text had been written on leaves which were in every case an integral part of the quire, though in the absence of guiding compass points for his illumination this is impossible to prove. His work at the opening of the book is on two bifolia: fols. 2 and 5, and 3 and 4. The contents of these leaves are as follows: 4v Judith presents a book to Christ 3r Framed decorated page with lions arranged in rows 3v Matthew evangelist and symbol page 4r Matthew initial page 4v Frame page with Matthew 1.1-5 in gold script on painted purple background 5r Framed page with Matthew 1.5-8 in gold script on painted purple background with the script more generously spread out than on 4v 5v Matthew 1.8-18 in continental Caroline minuscule (As the script of 4v and 5r, and 5v is that found in the so-called Manasses Sacramentary (Paris, BN lat. 819 (PLiège workshop, c. 1070)) where the artist of F also worked it is reasonable to assume that continental script and illumination were added at the same time.) At present fols. 2-5 are between a conjugate formed by fols. 1 and 6, of which fol. 1 is blank and fol. 6 has 283</page><page sequence="42">Patrick McGurk and Jane Posenthal Matthew 1. 18-11. 17 in the hand of the main Judith scribe. The make up of this present quire is as follows: 1,2, 3, /4, 5,6 Fols. 7-10, where the same scribe continues the Matthew text to Matt. VI. 6 (on lOv), are arranged as follows: 7, 8, 9, 1 10, -, - with 7 and 8 as two singletons. Three points should be noted about fols. 2-5. First, as Herbert Köllner kindly informed Patrick McGurk, Dr Roosen- Runge found that the gold of the text initials on 5v (by the continental scribe) was different from the gold in the main part of the book. Second, the ruling and prickings and measurements of the text block on fols. 2-5 are different from those in the rest of the manuscript. Third, fols. 1 and 6, and to a lesser extent fols. 7 and 8 have clearly marked folds which are not visible on fols. 2-5. This suggests that fols. 1 and 6 were kept apart from fols. 2-5 for some time. The condition of both fols. 1 and 6 could point to their being kept at different times on the outside of the book, perhaps when it was still unbound. It therefore follows that the codex was completed by a continental scribe and/or artist when the main scribe was no longer available. It is also likely that the unbound and unfinished gatherings of F may have been taken by Judith to Flanders in 1065 and completed there at her request. This still leaves unexplained the curious make-up of fols. 1,6 and 7-10, that is, a bifolium (fols. 1-6) with fol. 1 blank, two singletons (fols. 7 and 8) and a bifolium (fols. 9-10) which has almost half a page blank on lOv. Many unsatisfactory answers can be offered to this problem, but one which seems to meet the fewest objections hypothesizes the following original make-up of fols. 1-6 and 7-10: 6, 7, 8, 9, I 10, -, -, 1 That fol. 6 occupied this position at some stage is suggested by the already- mentioned folds: these are very marked and their imprint can be seen on fols. 7 and 8, but those on fol. 1 do not match in any way. The creasing and folds on fol. 1 could therefore have been caused when this folio took up its present position, but before the book was completed and bound, since they are not reproduced on fols. 2-5. It might be too that fol. 6 was meant to be preceded by at least two folios containing a Matthew picture and an initial page on the verso of which could have been accommodated the Matthew text which was eventually to be written by a continental hand. These putative folios would in turn have had conjugates. When lOv was reached, the scribe realized that he could not spread out the remaining text. It is certainly curious that he did not 284</page><page sequence="43">The Anglo-Saxon gospelbooks of Judith, countess of Flanders begin spacing out the Matthew text judiciously over fols. 6-10. One sign that these folios were written at a different stage from the writing of the rest of the book can be seen by their different pattern of punctuation. In these folios the mark used for a full pause (;) is sometimes placed after an extensive blank space at the end of a line. This full pause is itself used much more frequently in these pages than elsewhere in the book, but a more striking contrast is seen in the use of the lesser pause (.). This is used forty-seven times in these ten pages, but only three times in the next ten (1 lr-16v) and eight times in another randomly selected ten (41r-45v). It is just possible that fols. 6-10 were not merely written at a different time from the remainder of the book, but were begun originally for a different book, and came in the course of writing to be adapted for the present one. These folios may be a chance surviving example of lost botched attempts at book-making, of which the replacement folios at the beginning of Matthew and Mark in A may provide other signs. The openings of both F and A do suggest difficulties in the making of at least two of Judith's books. The gap on lOv and the unfinished state of F suggest that it was being made shortly before her enforced departure. The appearance of a very poor scribe in A (who executed all the gold verse capitals as well as the display capitals on the initial pages) could indicate both that the main scribe was no longer available and that the final stages of the making of the book were rushed. If this was the case, then the main scribe might well have left both A and F to be finished by others. The problems of the first quires in F and A may never be satisfactorily solved. There seem to be have been changes of plan with both. It has just been suggested that F was unfinished when Judith left England in 1065, which must have been the year when the book was made. It is likely that A was also made at roughly the same time. The evidence presented above for the other two Judith books also being part of the same single commission would also suggest that they too were made in or shortly before 1065. The Judith scripts are a more deliberate Caroline minuscule than that associated earlier in the eleventh century with the hand of Eadwig Basan, and can be assigned on palaeographical grounds to the last twenty or so years before 1066, a date which charters can confirm.87 It is more difficult to suggest a place of origin. The comparisons which have been drawn between the style 87 For Eadwig Basan, see Bishop, English Caroline Minuscule , pp. xv and 29 and pl. xxii, and D. N.

They are disposed on the page in all three books with balance and care, but A's are too feeble to be readily comparable, C's are without distinctive features, and the nearest parallels to D's are those in the earlier Edgar New Minster Charter (London, BL Cotton Vespasian A. viii, after 966) a Winchester product of probably a century earlier.89 The script is in a direct line of descent from that of scribe B, but this is no pointer to its localization. Nor do the English landed connections of Tostig suggest any particular monastery or scriptorium; and it is remarkable that Domesday Book does not record Judith holding any land.90 The supposed links between Thorney and Tostig and Judith do not exist: neither are even mentioned in the Thorney Liber uitae.91 The Judith gospels 88 Temple, Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts 900-1 066 , no. 79, pls. 259-60, illustrates both illumination and script. On p. 110 Temple compares the illumination of Douce 296 with that of D. 89 Many eleventh-century initial pages in luxury Anglo-Saxon books are unfinished or poorly planned. Examples include: London, BL Add. 34890, fol. 74 (Luke page) with a decorated initial but no text; Cambridge, Pembroke College 301, fol. 71 (Luke page: ibid. pl. 236) with much text missing; London, BL Arundel 155, fol. 53 (Ps. LI: ibid. pl. 217) with text in crowded rustics and lines left blank; Royal 1. D. IX (John page: ibid. pl. 222), where the heavily decorated frame dominates the illumination.

McGurk, 'The Golden Age of Anglo-Saxon Painting 966-1066', Miniatura 1 (1988), 163-6, at 163. The comparison between the display capitals in this charter and in D was made independently by R. Gameson, 'English Manuscript Art in the Mid-Eleventh Century: the Decorative Tradition', Antjli (1991), 64-122, at 77 and 84-5, and figs. 14-15, which appeared after this paper had been accepted for publication, and in which further interesting observations are made on the Judith books on pp. 77 and 88. 90 As well as being earl of Northumbria, Tostig was earl of Nottingham and earl of Northampton. On the evidence for this, see F. E. Harmer, Anglo-Saxon Writs (Manchester, 1952), pp. 418, 262-5 and 574; A. Williams, 'The King's Nephew: the Family and Career of Ralph, Earl of Hereford', Studies in Medieval History presented to R. Allen Brown , ed. C. Harper- Bill et al. (Woodbridge, 1989), pp. 327-43, at 333, n. 33 and 338-9. In a letter dated 15 May 1989, A. Williams kindly summarized for Patrick McGurk her findings for Tostig's Domesday Book holdings. He had substantial lands in the North, particularly in Amounder- ness; in the East Midlands, especially Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire; in the Isle of Wight and the adjacent mainland; and in his brother Harold's western earldom, Gloucester- shire and Oxfordshire. See now R. Fleming, Kings and Lords in Conquest England (Cambridge, 1991), pp. 46, 56, 70-1, 86-91 and 102, and P. A. Clarke, The English Nobility under Edward the Confessor (Oxford, 1994) pp. 24-5 and 191-4. Ann Williams kindly informed Patrick McGurk of the absence of evidence for Judith's landholdings in Domesday. 91 The Thorney Liber uitae is London, BL Add. 40000. It is discussed in J. Gerchow, Die Gedenküberlieferung der Angelsachsen mit einer Katalog der libri vitae und Necrologien , Arbeiten zur Frühmittelalterforschung 20 (Berlin and New York, 1988), 187-99. On his flight from England in 1051, Godwine embarked from Thorney (Anglo-Saxon Chronicle D, s.a.). This has sometimes been mistaken for the monastery of Thorney, but it is almost certainly Thorney 286</page><page sequence="45">The Anglo-Saxon gospelhooks of Judith y countess of Flanders are among many later Anglo-Saxon books which have not been localized, but it is worth considering again Alan Bishop's suggestion that they were made in her household. Only two textual exemplars may have been needed for gospels and prefaces, and it is possible to hypothesise that one model lay behind the evangelist and initial pages.92 One scribe wrote most of the four codices. In A his work was completed, perhaps in a hurry, by a very poor calligrapher. In D he worked with another scribe who was using a different textual exemplar. A, D and C were each illuminated by different hands, and so at the most six hands would have been needed to make the books in England. A patron of Judith's wealth, ambitions and connections would have been able to support six scribes and artists, their materials and equipment. These could have been itinerant professionals hired for a specific job, and if one or more scribes was also an artist fewer men would have been needed.93 Judith's household could itself have been itinerant, but she must have had a base during Tostig's tenure of the earldom of Northumbria. In fact the only evidence for her activities in England comes from the Vita Mdwardi and two Northern sources.94 One of these two sources, the Vita S. Oswini , mentions her putting a relic of Oswine's hair to an ordeal by fire in a chamber in York shortly before Tostig's expulsion from the North in 1065. 95 The chamber could have been in a royal building taken over by Tostig or it could have been his private dwelling; and York might very hesitantly be put forward as the place where the four gospelbooks were made during Judith's last few months in England. When she reached Flanders she could well have summoned the scribe-artist of the Manasses Sacramentary to complete F, which must have left England unbound. It is also possible that the other volumes, though bound, may not have been given by the time of Judith's exile in 1065 the metal covers they possessed in the Middle Ages, but the question of these bindings, their date and origin will be near Bosham in Sussex where Godwine had many estates. It is also just possible that another Countess Judith, Earl Waltheof 's wife, who held many lands near Thorney, may have been mistaken by Harrsen for the subject of this paper. Harrsen ('Countess Judith of Flanders and the Library of Weingarten Abbey', p. 4) claims that Tostig had helped the endowment of Thorney abbey. Note that 'Wltheth comes et uxor eius' are in the Thorney Tiber uitae . 92 The models for the Judith evangelist and initial pages will be considered in detail by Jane Rosenthal in a later publication. 93 Judith's collecting zeal is demonstrated by her bequest to Weingarten in which the 'plenaria cum uno textu evangelii' were only four among very many more religious objects. For the evidence of professional scribes and craftsmen in the Anglo-Saxon period, see C. R. Dodwell, Anglo-Saxon Art (Manchester, 1982), pp. 68-83, and for professional scribes at slightly later dates, see M.

The four books were certainly commissioned by Judith, possibly for use in her capella . The texts of three of them were curiously selective. In D the omissions of lengthy and shorter passages and the frequent short gaps due to eyeskip indicate an indifference to the text which contrasts with the high quality of script, illumination, display capitals and silver-gilt cover. Judith kept three of the four with her during her lifetime, possibly parting, quite soon after her marriage to Weif IV, with the more personal C. At Weingarten the end leaves of D and F were used to enter charters and donations, F had a liturgical lesson for Pentecost added on an end leaf, but A (the sole complete copy) shows little sign of use. They were presumably treasured for their precious covers and their illuminations, and they remained definitely treasury, not library, manuscripts. C was used occasionally as a German visitors' book at Monte Cassino, the only English manuscript in that richest of monastic libraries.96 96 Patrick McGurk has been responsible for this first part of a study on the Judith Gospels, though Jane Rosenthal contributed the hypothesis on the Monte Cassino book's function. A later publication will focus on the illumination and metal covers and will be largely the work of Jane Rosenthal. Throughout there has been a fruitful and extremely useful collaboration between the two. Patrick McGurk has incurred many obligations which he would gratefully like to record: to the British Academy, which made a grant for the first of two visits to Fulda and Monte Cassino; to the librarians of the Staatliche Bibliothek, Bamberg, the Hessische Landesbibliothek, Fulda, the Archivio della Badia, Monte Cassino, the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York, the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, and the Württembergische Landes- bibliothek, Stuttgart for allowing the repeated examination of precious codices; to the kindness and help of Dom Faustino Avagliano at Monte Cassino, of Eva-Marie Thole at Fulda, of Felix Heinzer at Stuttgart. He would like to thank Michael Gullick for his comments and guidance on quire tacketing, compass points and different ways of preparing and applying gold in manuscripts; Sandy Heslop for a useful discussion on the problems of the Judith gospels; Christopher Clarkson for reporting his observations of the bindings of the two Pierpont Morgan books; and John Mitchell for the photographs of the Monte Cassino codex. He very much regrets that Herbert Köllner did not live to see this article in print, as it would have been a small return for the assistance and advice he always generously and selflessly offered. Both Patrick McGurk and Jane Rosenthal would like to express their appreciation of William Voelkle's willingness to allow them to examine more than once the two valuable and fragile Judith codices which are among the jewels of the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. 288</page><page sequence="47">The Anglo-Saxon gospelbooks of Judith , countess of Flanders APPENDIX A The Four Judith Gospelbooks: Contents and Description FULDA, HESSISCHE LANDESBIBLIOTHEK AA.21 Description 90 leaves. 302 x 200. &lt;205 x 130&gt;. 26 long lines. Double bounding lines. Ruling before folding two bifolia at a time on hair side. Collation fol. Isinëlc; fols. II-III2; fols. 1-66; fols. 7-106"5'6; fols. 11-89 (two numbered 77)8; fol. 90 (lower fifth of page cut away, and originally 90v had been pasted down). Script There were two scribes: the Anglo-Saxon scribe common to the four Judith books, who wrote all the text from fol. 6 to the end (pls. VII-VIII); and a Low Countries scribe who wrote the text on 4v- 5v, and who is also the main scribe in the sacramentary, Paris, BN lat. 819 (PLiège workshop, s. xi2). The English scribe certainly executed the gold text capitals from 6r to the end of the codex: these are by one hand and are similar to those in C, which were also his work. The gold of the text capitals on 5v, however, was shown by Roosen-Runge (in a stereographic examin- ation on 27 April 1981) to be different from that on 6r onwards and must therefore be assumed to be the work of the continental hand. The English scribe left blank the pages designed to hold the portrait and initial pages of the last three gospels. The illuminations on these pages, as well as those at the opening of the book on 2v-4r, were the work of the main artist in the already- mentioned sacramentary at Paris, BN lat. 819. It is probable that the script before 6r as well as the illumination were the work of one scribe-artist. This Low Countries artist almost certainly illuminated the portrait and initial pages of Mark, Luke and John after the English scribe had copied these gospels: the pages were integral parts of their quires, and the artist here used existing double bounding lines to guide his frames. The position was different in the first quire of the codex. Fols. 2-5 have continental illumination and script, and form a ternion contained within a bifolium (fols. 1 and 6), of which fol. 1 was originally blank, and fol. 6 is in an Anglo- Saxon hand. Fols. 2-5 are ruled and pricked differently from fols. 1 and 6. They have 27 not 26 lines, and the pages which received illuminations or gold-framed text (2v- 5r) had single, not double, bounding lines, which, on 4v and 5r, were badly aligned and sloping. Fols. 2-5 were not therefore originally part of the same quire as fols. 1 and 6, and were probably prepared as part of a separate campaign. Two points should be noted about fols. 1 and 6: first, they could not have been the outside leaves of a normal quire as they are ruled on lv and 6r (which are both hair sides); second, there is marked creasing on 6r, which is reproduced (with decreasing effect) on 7r, 8r and 9r, but the creasing on lr is quite different. Possible implications of these features are discussed above (see pp. 284-5). On 2r there are a few offset letters which are visible ( nm . Ihm. / dicens / ameni). They 289</page><page sequence="48">Patrick McGurk and Jane Posenthal do not look Anglo-Saxon, and this suggests that the folio was placed at some stage before or after its illumination against a leaf in a continental hand. Of the other additions, the elaborate Pentecost reading was probably added first on 88v, the entries on 89v and 90r next and the other entries (on lr and lv, and 88r and 89r) last, all at dates from the early twelfth to the late twelfth century. The added Pentecost reading indicates some use. Other signs are the stylus marks in the margins, which are listed below here: 12v, Matt. VII. 15 'Adtendite a falsis prophetis . . .'; 15v, IX. 37 'Tunc dicit discipulis suis messis . . .', X.2 'Duodecim autem apostoli . . .'; 17r, X.37 'Qui amat patrem aut matrem . . .'; 17v, XI. 16 'Cui autem similem aestimabo . . .'; 18r, XI. 20 'Tunc coepit exprobrare . . .'; 23v, XV. 5 'et non honorificabit patrem suum aut matrem . . 7; 82v, John XVIII.4 'Iesus itaque sciens omnia quae venturus . . .' Marks for the Passion 'T' (Christ), 's' (the speeches of others) and 'c' (narrator) are interlineated in the Passion text in all four gospels. A + is interlineated on 85 v at John XIX. 39 'venit autem et Nichodemus', probably by the original scribe. Corrections and repunctuation There are some corrections and some repunctuation on 86 v and 87r by a thirteenth-century German hand as in A and D. All other corrections were made by the original scribe as, or immediately after, he wrote. Binding is of boards. 312 x 204 x 10 mm. Sewn on five bands (head, tail and three centre). All seem to be double cords. Straight grooves visible only on inside of the front cover, where the cords are held by wooden pegs. Two holes on the fore edge of the front cover indicate clasps. These boards were covered with brown leather which was tucked in on their inside. On the lower binding there were Weingarten stamps of the fifteenth to sixteenth centuries (reproduced Köllner, Die illuminierter Handschriften I, pls. 948 and 963, nos. 41-7). The upper cover bears the holes of metal plaques which were found at the very least at the four corners and at the centre. In time the brown leather was itself strengthened by more brown leather which protected the spine. This was tucked under the original leather on the upper cover, but over it on the lower. Inside the lower coyer there is a pasted down parchment leaf. Inside the front cover there are various labels, two with eighteenth-century writing: (i) Aa. 21; (ii) 'hie codex vetustissimus continet sancta evangelia cum picturis ad singulorum initium'. Of the three fly-leaves at the front of the book, fols. II and III are blank and form a bifolium, and fol. I contains the copy of a charter dated St Valentine's Day 1466 of Hanns Widmer to the parish of Ravensburg and witnessed by Burgomaster Claus Gaggern of Buchhorn. Conclusion: boards and sewing medieval; the binding was repaired at the end of the Middle Ages. Contents lr-v. Account of the history of Weingarten in a late-twelfth-century hand.

Script The book is written by one hand, almost certainly the hand common to the other Judith books. Bishop, who first identified this scribe, presumably based his judgement on the only published reproduction of the script in Palaeograßa artistica di Monte Cassino , ed. O. Piscicelli Taeggi, 7 parts (Monte Cassino, 1876-77), pl. xlii, a lithographie and not too faithful rendering. The script in this manuscript has one anomaly, the almost invariable addition in minuscule G of a hook to the left of the descender more or less at the point where it swings to the right. This hook is not known in any other script and would seem to be a perverse variation of the scribe. Otherwise the letters and ductus are those of the scribe common to the other Judith books (pls. IX-X). Marks for the Passion 'T' (for Christ's words), 's' (for those of others) and ťc' (for narrator) are interlineated in the four Passion texts though in John these peter out after a while. The following texts are introduced as shown: Mark, p. 110, XIV.l, by 'Passio Domini nostri lesu Christi secundum Marcum' in gold rustics, and a line of rustics; p. 120, XV. 42, a word in rustics; Luke, p. 149, XXII.l, a line of rustics. Sequence in illumination The flaking of some colours and the observation of the present outlines allows the following order to be recovered: outlines were first in sepia, followed by black where gold was to be painted, application of colours, sometimes some colour edging and highlighting, sepia outlines again over gold, and black outlines over other colours. 293</page><page sequence="52">Patrick McGurk and Jane Posenthal On the initial pages, it is likely that the capitals were executed last: this is suggested by the 'm' in Verbum' being over some red/pink foliage of the column; the spacing of the 'e' and 'm' in ťQuidem' on the Luke initial page indicates that the layout of the capitals was accommodated to the tail of the Q; in any case it is possible that the 'm' of 'quidem' was in fact placed over some planned, but never executed extended foliage of the initial Q. Though there are prickings which guided some of the circular patterns on the illuminations, and these can sometimes be seen on the other side of the picture, it is not easy to tell whether they in fact pierced some letters. The second 'n' of 'interrogaver- unť on p. 169 seems to be pierced by the pricking which guided the compass point for the eagle's halo on p. 167.

Script Two scribes (pls. V-VI). (1) 3v-24v (all of Matthew) and 73r-80v (John VI.59 ťvivet in aeternum' - XIII. 35 'habueritis ad invicem'). This scribe writes in all four Judith books. (2) 25r-72v (Mark preface and Gospel, Luke preface and Gospel, John preface and John 1. 1- VI.59 'qui manducet hune panem') and fols. 81-4 (John XVII. 2 'et sublevatis Iesus oculis' - end). The second scribe adopts a different lay-out from the first and does not divide his text into paragraphs corresponding to Eusebian sections, but arranges text in a more solid block. The text capitals are in gold and brown, the gold marking Eusebian sections. There are creases in fol. 1 which are also found with decreasing effect on fols. 2 and 3. These could have occurred when the book was unbound or when it was being bound. The illuminated pages for Mark, Luke and John and the Matthew evangelist page have folds which go across the page. These could conceivably have occurred when these pages were being held in place for the illuminator. One of the compass points used to draw arches on the Mark evangelist page (26v) pierces the letter / in divinae on the recto of the preceding leaf (25r7, Mark preface).

Corrections and repunctuation On 59r, Luke XIX. 2-10 has been repunctuated and one or two corrections have been made by a German hand of probably thirteenth-century date, which also appears in A and F. All other corrections were probably made by the original scribes as they were writing. Plain yellowish-green silk curtain pasted down at the top of the Matthew portrait page. Binding Compartmented oak boards. 295 x 200 x 5.5 mm. Sewn on four bands (head, tail and two centre). Head and tail bands double cords. Centre bands thongs. Bands terminate in straight bands on outside of the lower board. According to Christopher Clarkson, who examined the binding in 1*987, the boards might be Norman or Anglo-Norman c. 1050. Spine and lower board covered with pink skin typical of Weingarten bindings of the thirteenth century, which is tucked in over the inside of the back cover. In turn the pink skin on the spine and over part of the inside back cover is covered by brown leather (of eighteenth- or nineteenth-century date according to Clarkson). Fol. 87 is now pasted down on to the lower cover over both the brown leather and the pink skin. A piece of pink skin acted as a conjugate between the front cover and fol. 1, being stuck on to lr and on to the board below the larger skin. There are traces of glue on lr, suggesting that earlier it had been stuck on to the front cover. Front silver-gilt cover, with a majesty of Christ between two cherubim on the upper half, and a Crucifixion on the lower. A brass plaque (of sixteenth-century date according to Clarkson) on back cover. Tongues on tabs, their remains evident at ends. Remains of two clasps catching on pins on fore edge of lower back. The sequence of binding and repairs seems to be as follows: (i) The creases and folds on the first few folios probably go back to the time when the book was unbound. (ii) The boards were added at an early date presumably shortly before the silver-gilt front cover. (iii) Possibly after the addition on lv-2r of the account of the dedication of the basilica of Weingarten on 12 November 1183, lr was pasted down on to the front inside cover. (iv) Probably at the time of Abbot Berthold, the binding was repaired. As in A and the Stuttgart 'Judith' gospels, a pink skin covered the spine and back cover, being tucked in on the inside back cover. Fol. 1 was detached from the front (unless it had already pulled free), a narrow piece of skin was stuck down on lr and on the inside front board, on to which another larger piece of skin was pasted. (v) The binding needed further repairs in the eighteenth or nineteenth century, and 297</page><page sequence="56">Patrick McGurk and Jane Posenthal brown leather covered the spine, another strip being stuck over the inside lower board (over the pink skin) and over this fol. 87 was pasted down on the binding.

These leaves were written by a second very inferior scribe (pl. Ill), who formed his Caroline letters with difficulty and who had poor Latin. He wrote after the main scribe had written the succeeding leaves (that is the second quire of Matthew and fols. 43 and 50, the extra line on 42v and the line left blank on 9v showing this). The second scribe's fols. 9 and 48 were the last leaves of their quires, but they were not given the appropriate quire signatures (A and H). The Crucifixion page and the two singletons for the Matthew and Mark portrait pages do not appear to have been ruled. The prickings from compass points which guided halos or lobes on the illuminated pages can be traced through these pages and show that a quire was assembled and held together (presumably by tacketing) when the pages were prepared for illumination, and this is true of the single leaf for the Mark portrait. Thus the e of legis on 47vl3 is pierced by a prick made for a lobe in the portrait on the singleton on 48v. The guiding prickings on the Matthew initial page (3r) thrice pierce letters on the verso, 3vl3 e of autem , 3vl5 u of genui /, 3v24 g of genuit. The prickings only pierce leaves belonging to the same quire, which is not surprising. The capitals on the initial pages are awkwardly placed, not being guided by the ruled lines, and are of poor quality. Silk curtains protect the illuminations of Mark and Luke. The common pattern on them suggests that they were cut from one piece. Marks for the Passion The interlineated signs 't' (for Christ's words), V (for the discourse of others) and 'c' (for the narrator) are found. In Mark the opening of the Passion text is signalled by a blank line and a line of rustics (70v, XIV.l), and in Luke by a blank line and a few letters in rustics (118r, XXII.l) Corrections and repunctuation A thirteenth-century German hand has repunctuated and has made some corrections on 141v-148r. Six words omitted through eyeskip (John XVI. 7 ťet iterum modicum et videbis me') have been added by the same hand on 146v. Some words are transposed by interlineated letters. All other corrections were probably made by the original scribe either as or immediately after he wrote. Possible lection marks There are marginal crosses in ink at the following places: Matthew, 6v, IV. 9 'hic criminatur', 9v, VI. 5, ťet cum oratis', VI. 6 (?), '(redd)et tibi', 23v, XIV. 23, ťVespere autem facto', 33r, XXI. 33, 'crederetis ei'; Mark, 58r, VI. 34, 'et exiens', 58v, VI. 46, 'et cum', 63r, IX. 29, 'et inde', 63r, bottom of page, IX. 36, 'qui me misit'; Luke, 86v, V.12, 'et factum est', V.15, 'ab infirmitatibus suis'; John, 136r, VIII. 31, 'dicebant ergo lesu', 136v, VIII. 47, 'verbum Dei audit'. And there are marginal crosses made by a stylus at the points listed: Matthew, 7r, IV. 23, 'et circuibat Iesus', 18r, XII. 5, 'non legistis', XII. 6, 'dico enim vobis', 19r, XII. 33, 'aut facite arborem', 21 r, XIII. 34, 'aliam parabolani'; Mark, 59r, VII. 3, 'tenentes', VII. 8, 'facitis multa'; John, 132r, VI. 40, 'haec est enim', 142v, XII. 31, 'nunc iudicium est mundi', 143v, XIII. 13, 'vos vocatis', 144r, XIII.21, 'cum haec', 144r, XIII.21, 'quidem enim', 145r, XV. 1, 'ego sum vitae', 151r, XIX. 30, 'cum ergo Iesus'.

A large piece of pink skin goes a little way under the metal cover on the front board, covers the spine and the lower cover, and is tucked in on the inside of the lower cover. Another piece of pink skin is pasted down on to the first skin on the inside back cover. Here the stub of fol. 154 (a single and presumably added leaf) is also seen attached to that skin. On the inside of the front cover a parchment paste down with its stub visible on 1 r, but not attached to it. Both the pastedown leaf at the front and fol. 154 have the same dimensions and have enigmatic inscriptions in a Weingarten hand. The first is at the front upside down at the bottom edge: imaiestatem(?) cum iiii. animalibus'. The second is at the same position on 154v: 'passionem Domini nostri lesu Christi'. It is not clear what they refer to, but they were presumably written when the manuscript was rebound. The evidence of the binding suggests a first binding in the eleventh century before the book left England, and at the very least a second at Weingarten when the pink skin was added both around the book and as a lower pastedown and the two leaves with Weingarten writing were attached.

APPENDIX B A Possible Fifth Gospelbook Acquired by Judith of Flanders: Stuttgart, Württembergische Landesbibliothek, H. B. II. 46 Discussion The gospelbook H. B. II. 46 in the Stuttgart Württembergische Landesbibliothek has a long association with Weingarten. It has been identified with a manuscript in the Weingarten catalogue of 1781. 1 Its binding was covered with the characteristic pink skin which is found in other Weingarten books, including the two New York Pierpont Morgan Library Judith books.2 A bifolium containing splendid illumina- tions by the artist of the Berthold Missal was inserted at the opening of Matthew, presumably in the early thirteenth century.3 Hans Swarzenski argued that the decoration of at least one of its canon tables influenced twelfth-century Weingarten illumination.4 So it is likely that it was at Weingarten early in the Middle Ages. Whereas its presence at Weingarten is thus suggested from an early date, its connection with Judith can only be inferred from the manuscript's origin in the Low Countries. It has long been associated with a school or workshop with Liège connections.5 One of the artists and scribes of this workshop was responsible for the additions to the Fulda Judith gospels, and it has seemed reasonable therefore on these grounds to associate the manuscript with Judith. It was not selective like three of the Judith books, but it was incomplete and seems to have been a desultory production. It ends with Luke, which was itself completed in two stages, and though a blank page and a half was available, there is no sign of John's prefatory matter. It opens with a quire of Canon tables which were defective in two ways: their numbers had not been entered, and the frames were artistically unfinished. Apart from this Canon table quire (which itself may have been an addition to the book), it had no prefatory texts before Matthew. Two drawings of Matthew and Mark and their symbols were also added, and in Mark took up all the space which had been left by the scribe for the opening verses, and these were never written either there or in Matthew or Luke. The style of these drawings has caused the book to be associated with a Liège workshop which has proved difficult to localize. There has been no 1 Löffler, Die Handschriften des Klosters Weingarten , pp. 35 and 57.

But the inference which has been drawn from the book's origin in the Low Countries, and from its presence at Weingarten at an early date, is that it had been commissioned or acquired by Judith and given by her to that monastery. It was not merely incomplete, but it was relatively scruffy when compared with Judith's luxury Anglo-Saxon books and their extensive use of gold and high quality illumination. Yet it was this book which Berthold chose to embellish by the addition of a splendidly illuminated bifolium at the opening of Matthew. Perhaps he did so because it was unfinished and the inserted Matthew bifolium was a first step in an abortive plan to make an early gospelbook more usable. It is also very likely that its metal cover made it particularly suitable for embellishment. Although the manuscript was kept in the library and not in the Treasury in the eighteenth century, its binding shows the marks of a metal binding, possibly representing, it has been suggested, a Crucifixion. The boards and sewing of the book look very old, and it is likely that the binding needed repair when it was covered with the characteristic pink skin used for so many Weingarten manuscripts. The holes in this pink skin suggest that a metal cover was either put back or just possibly added during this recovering. At a later stage, presumably in the Middle Ages or in the early modern period, this pink skin itself had become worn, particularly at the spine, and had to be repaired by the addition of two separate pieces of a brighter pink skin. It would seem possible therefore that its lost metal cover gave the book a status denied by its utilitarian and incomplete contents, and that this was the chief reason for its embellishment by Berthold. A tentative history of the book might therefore be suggested. It was commissioned or acquired in the Low Countries by Judith of Flanders. She seemed happy to accept it even though it was clearly incomplete, though she saw to it that at the very least the gospel of Luke was completed. She had it embellished with a prestigious metal cover, and the book may have been kept in the treasury with Judith's bequest. In the early thirteenth century, the binding needed repair and Abbot Berthold repaired this binding as well as those of the two Pierpont Morgan Judith books, and embellished it with the illuminated bifolium. At some stage, whether in the later Middle Ages or in the early modern period, this binding needed further repair. It may be that at that time its metal cover was lost, and that the book was moved from the treasury to the library. At the time of this move, the five metal studs on the lower binding were added and the book began its existence as a book laid horizontally on a library shelf. Before the 1781 catalogue was made a label with a shelf mark was pasted on its spine and the book was then kept on the same library shelves.

In these leaves there are changes in letter forms. 131r-139v are the work of a second scribe who began on the last leaf of one quire (fols. 124-31), and then wrote on a second complete quire (fols. 132-9) which had been ruled like the earlier ones. A third scribe wrote fols. 140-51 (two quires, the first of eight, the second of four), and his quite different ruling (single bounding against double bounding lines) and changes of lines per page (22 on 140-7r, 27 on 147v, 148r, 149v and 150r, 28 on 150v, 29 on 148v and 149r (oddly the scribe has the same number of lines on facing pages), and 18 on the last page, 1 51 r) suggest that he completed Luke a little while after the first two scribes had finished. There is space on 151 for the opening of the John accessory texts. That they were never entered suggests either that this was always meant to be a book with the first three gospels, which is rather unlikely, or that the plan to include John was abandoned. The first scribe uses orange spaced-out script for first lines of chapters, for incipits and explicits, very occasionally using rustics rather than or as well as minuscule. He writes the Mark and Luke chapter lists in a smaller hand, which is a well established practice. He uses some mauve letters at the beginning of his stint, occasionally for text capitals (e.g. 15r 'E' or 41 r T') or in an alternating sequence with orange (e.g. 13r 'Christi autem generado sic era &lt; t &gt; ' or 43r 'Multi'). He adds daubs of two different kinds of orange in text initials. The other two scribes do not differentiate first lines of capitals in this way and arrange the gospel text much more in a block. The scribe left a varying number of lines blank for the text missing at the opening of the three gospels, at least a full page in Matthew and Mark, and eight lines in Luke. In Mark the full page illustration of the evangelist and symbol left no space for the missing text. In Luke the scribe had clearly envisaged a much lower-key introduction to the gospel and the artist did not produce a drawing. The splendid bifolium added in the early thirteenth century by the artist of the Berthold Missal at the opening of Matthew may have been a first attempt at making good the gaps at the opening of the gospels. The drawings of Matthew and Mark are enclosed in double frames outlined in brown. These either followed the ruling of the outer bounding lines or relied on apparently freely drawn plumb lines. The evangelists and their symbols are outlined in brown with lighter brown shading and have a light pinkish-red wash for flesh and faces. In Mark the same wash is used to shade the outlines of the dress and to fill in the bottom of the cloak. As with so much else in this manuscript the drawings seem unfinished. The canon tables are on a separate quire which has a range of colours not found elsewhere, that is, a dull brick brown, pale green, mauve and two shades of blue (pale and darker). The arcades and patterns on opposing pages do not match exactly and the decorative patterns in the main arch are the only features to consistently correspond. Nor is the decoration and colouring complete. On 7r the leaves on which the animals in the spandrels stand are not coloured, unlike those on the opposite page (6v). There are no decorations of any kind on the sides of the arcades on 7v-9r, and 7v-8r lack the colour washes which usually fill in the smaller arches immediately above the columns. There is no means of telling whether the canon table quire (which has no numbers) 305</page><page sequence="64">Patrick McGurk and Jane Rosenthal belonged to the original codex. It has been part of this book for some time. The quire has no signs of ruling or pricking. Binding Boards. 280 x 175 x 10-12. Sewn on five double cords (head, tail and three centre bands). Blue headbands survive. A pink skin was wrapped round the covers and tucked on their inside rather like the similar skin in the two Pierpont Morgan Judith books. This pink skin in turn was repaired by two other pieces of pink skin, particularly round the spine. In the front cover the original presence of a metal cover is indicated by the large number of holes, disposed in such a way as to suggest a Crucifixion. The lower cover has five studs. Traces of glue suggest that the iņsides of the covers may have had pastedowns, but these have been lost. "The canon table quire is attached to the front cover by a narrow parchment strip, which is pasted down on to the front cover and to the outside of the quire, 9v. The rest of the book is firmly attached to the cords. It is possible that the boards and stitching are original but the pink skin round the covers suggests a repair, possibly at the time the thirteenth- century painted bifolium was added and when presumably the metal cover still survived. The further repairs to the spine and boards may have occurred in the later Middle Ages. A label in an eighteenth century hand on the inside front cover reads: 'Biblia IV Evangeliorum'. On one label on the spine can be discerned the letter 'A' with space below for more letters or numbers. Presumably this was the label affixed at the time of the catalogue of 1781 . The book was identified by Löffler ( Die Handschriften des Klosters Weingarten , p. 57) as that catalogue's 'A. 34 fol.'. Perhaps by that time the metal cover had been lost and the studs were added to what had become a library book. Contents I-9r. Canon Tables. Decorated arcades without any numbers. Scrolls in arch.
