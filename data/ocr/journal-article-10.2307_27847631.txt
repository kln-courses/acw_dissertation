<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vistas in Physical Reality: Festschrift for Henry Margenau. Ervin Laszlo and Emily B. Sellon, eds. 228 pp. Plenum, 1976. $30. Henry Margenau is one of those rare thinkers who has made significant con tributions in both science and philosophy. Ostensibly the book contains contributed papers under three headings: vistas in physics, vistas in philosophy, and vistas in education. In fact, all the papers raise interesting philosophical questions in volving the sciences, especially physics. In various ways many of the articles focus on the nature and objectivity of scientific theories. Adolf Gr?nbaum argues against an anthropomorphic conception of clas sical statistical mechanics; H?kan T?r nebohm argues against an instrumental istic view of the special theory of relativ ity; and James Park disputes a subjecti vist interpretation of quantum physics. On the other hand, Ervin Laszlo empha sizes many of the nonempirical criteria which are involved in assessment of sci entific theories, and Peter Caws points out that there is an essential, but not self-defeating, circularity in our knowl edge of the physical world since the knower is part of that world. There is also some very interesting discussion by Lee Thayer and others about some of the dangers of complex social institutions like modern science. With increased special ization there comes a point at which a scientist's incompetencies exceed his competencies, and the difficulties in communicating with other scientists, let alone laymen, become immense. A pro vocative article by Wolfgang Yourgrau questions whether a unified philosophy of science is ever possible. The book is a worthwhile collection of papers, with something in it to interest any philosopher of science or any philo sophically oriented scientist. It will be of particular interest to those who are fa miliar with Henry Margenau's philoso phy, for a number of the works have the stamp of his influence?perhaps the most important tribute to his fine intellect.?
