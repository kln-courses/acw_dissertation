<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTRODUCTION The Legacy of Marija Gimbutas Carol P. Christ A lovingly and carefully conceived year-long exhibition titled "Neolithic Culture in Greece," under the direction of eminent archaeologist George A. Papathanassopoulos, opened in March 1995 at the N. P. Goulandris Mu seum of Cycladic Art in Athens. The Neolithic period (in Greece, ca. 6800 3200 B.C.E.) was the time when agriculture, pottery making, and weaving were invented. The Neolithic "revolution" allowed gatherers and hunters to settle down in one place, thus dramatically changing the conditions of life for humans and other species. It is widely "conceded"' in the scholarly literature that women, who had been the primary gatherers of seed plants, were the likely inventors of plant cultivation; of the new methods of food preparation that followed; of pottery for cooking and food storage; and of spinning and weaving for clothing, carpets, and bed covers. Moreover, women were perhaps the first to domesticate the young of wild animals.2 It is increasingly recognized that women did most of the agricultural work in early agricultural societies and had high status in them.3 But the museum catalog and the descriptions for the "Neolithic Culture in Greece" exhibition used the male generic term (o anthropos in Greek, man in English), making 1 Unfortunately, Ruby Rohrlich's ironic use of this word in her 1977 essay "Women in Transition: Crete and Sumer," in Renate Bridenthal and Claudia Koonz, eds., Becoming Visible: Women in European History (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1977), 36-39, still accu rately describes many scholarly works published in the last two decades. 2 See Margaret Ehrenberg, Women in Prehistory (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1989). Also see Joan M. Gero and Margaret Conkey, eds., Engendering Archaeol ogy: Women and Prehistory (Cambridge, MA: Blackwell, 1991), especially the essay by Patty Jo Watson and Mary C. Kennedy, "The Development of Horticulture in the Eastern Woodlands of North America: Women's Role," 255-76. Watson and Kennedy dispute archaeologists' assumption that women's discovery of the agricultural process was a passive and therefore unremarkable process. 3 See Peggy Reeves Sanday, Female Power and Male Dominance: On the Origins of Sexual Inequality (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981).</page><page sequence="2">32 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion no reference to women as the probable prime movers in the Neolithic revo lution.4 The Neolithic was a time, many scholars believe, when the Goddess was the primary religious symbol, reflecting not only the creative powers of the female body and the human connection to nature but also the important roles of women in the Neolithic revolution. In The Language of the Goddess and The Civilization of the Goddess, archaeologist Marija Gimbutas presents a detailed study of the meaning of Goddess symbolism in Neolithic Europe. Nevertheless, although the "Neolithic Culture in Greece" exhibition in cluded more than forty clearly female figurines-possibly the largest collec tion of original anthropomorphic, mainly female figurines ever displayed in one place (some of which were excavated by Marija Gimbutas)-they were not identified as Goddesses. Nor did the exhibit call attention to the roles of women and of female symbolism in Neolithic religion. Indeed, the English version of the catalog entry titled "Figurines and Models," written by a woman, begins with the following sentence: "Neolithic figurines and models represent mans animate and inanimate world, and, of course, man himself." It concludes, "Present research tends to interpret figurines and models as being associated with magic [and] initiation including the transmission of lore and play. ... it is only natural that the everyday activities of Neolithic man were expressed together with his customs and ritual practices."5 Though the work of Marija Gimbutas is frequently cited in the catalog, her theories about Goddess symbolism in Neolithic religion are nowhere seriously discussed. In the exhibit and its catalog, the only indication of women's important roles in the Neolithic revolution was given by black-and-white photographs of traditional Greek agricultural life. These show women actively partici pating in all of the agricultural tasks depicted. Pictures show two women winnowing wheat with wooden pitchforks; two women pounding pulses (beans) with weights attached to long poles; a man and a woman herding a large flock of sheep; a woman furrowing with a wooden plow drawn by two oxen, while a man hoes; a woman grinding with a stone hand mill; two women and two men shearing sheep; and a young woman and two girls spinning wool.6 Not noted was the fact that these photographs showed women engaged in tasks not normally associated by anthropologists or ar chaeologists with the female role, namely plowing and herding, as well as undertaking the traditionally female tasks of spinning and grinding. 4 George A.

If the scholars involved in the exhibit could not even speculate in words about the material contributions of women to Neolithic culture, how could they be expected to discuss the meaning of the pervasive female symbols in Neolithic religion? The very ideas that women may have been primary actors in cultural history and that God once may have been a woman are apparently too threatening to long-standing cultural habits and prejudice to be considered. A similar situation exists in the field of religious studies. The work of Marija Gimbutas has the potential to bring about a paradigm shift in the way we study religion: it pushes the time of cultural and religious origins far back before the Sumerians, the Hebrews, or the Greeks, and challenges us to rethink the roles of women and of female symbolism in religion.7 But to date, the implications of Gimbutas's theories are only beginning to be recognized. Joan Marler's essay in this special section sets Marija Gimbutas's work in the context of her remarkable, courageous, and often difficult life, in Lithuania under Polish and Nazi occupation and as a postwar refugee in the United States. One of the most important insights that Marler presents concerns the influence of Gimbutas's experience of folk practice and ritual in her native Lithuania on her theories about Neolithic religion. Gimbutas grew up in a world where the spirits of nature and female protective powers were still very much alive. Her extensive study of folk traditions provided Gimbutas with an invaluable resource when she began to interpret the symbolic legacy of Old Europe. Given that the work of Marija Gimbutas has been largely dismissed or ignored in the fields of archaeology and religious studies, it is not surprising that the majority of contributors to this collection focus on the challenge her work presents to traditional scholarship. This challenge is summed up in Marija Gimbutas's succinct statement "I reject the assumption that civili zation refers only to androcratic warrior societies."8 As the essays by Carol 7 See my "Toward a Paradigm Shift in the Academy and Religious Studies," in The Impact of Feminist Research in the Academy, ed. Christie Farnham (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1987), 314-25; and my "Mircea Eliade and the Feminist Paradigm Shift," Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion 7 (Fall 1991): 75-94.

Goldenberg, Mara Keller, and Charlene Spretnak dem onstrate, this challenge strikes to the heart of conscious and unconscious assumptions about the nature and origin of civilization and religion. Among these assumptions are the preeminence and priority of male gods; the neces sity of war; the inevitability of male dominance, class stratification, and hu man domination of nature; and, perhaps most significant of all, the notion of "cultural progress," which posits that so-called higher stages of civilization naturally supersede so-called lower stages. By unmasking the ideological prejudices and value commitments of Gimbutas's critics, these essays shed new light on the controversy surrounding her work. The essays in this collec tion suggest that unless and until a paradigm shift occurs with respect to these assumptions, the work of Marija Gimbutas cannot be understood. The fruitfulness of Gimbutas's theories for both archaeology and the history of religion is borne out in Frances Stahl Bernstein's essay on Roman religion. Using Gimbutas's theory of "the language of the Goddess" as a key, Stahl Bernstein finds that the symbolism associated with Aphrodite in the garden fresco of a house in Pompeii is Old European. This discovery, rooted, like the work of Gimbutas and of her predecessor Jane Harrison, in the interpretation of art, provides an important counterweight to the literary record, which presents Aphrodite as an ardent supporter of the Roman state.9 Stahl Bernstein's work validates in microcosm Gimbutas's contention that though "the Indo-European religion [became] official, the Old Euro pean Goddess religion was carried on."'1 Stahl Bernstein's groundbreaking work is certain to be followed by other studies of diverse cultural contexts. Though the focus of Gimbutas's work was on Europe (with occasional comparisons to Anatoliall), her theories provide provocative hypotheses for the study of Neolithic religion and its later transformations in other parts of the world. If women were primary actors in the agricultural revolution wher ever it occurred, then it makes sense to look for evidence of the high status of women and for symbolism connecting women, nature, and female divini ties in Neolithic cultures outside Europe. Indeed, anthropologist Daniel McCall has suggested that West African religions may have followed a pat tern of transformation similar to that hypothesized for Old Europe by Gim butas. As McCall writes: "The various Earth Mother cults among the Akan, 9 See Jane Ellen Harrison, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion (1903; reprint, London: Merlin Press, 1980). Also see Margaret Miles, Image as Insight: Visual Under standing in Western Christianity and Secular Culture (Boston: Beacon Press, 1985), who argues in a different context for the importance of understanding the artistic record. 10 Gimbutas, 401. l Gimbutas's inclusion of Anatolia in Europe has been called Eurocentric. It does coin cide, however, with the cultural aspirations of Turkish nationalists, including Kemal Ata turk and Tansu (iller.</page><page sequence="5">Introduction: The Legacy of Marija Gimbutas 35 Yoruba, and Ibo (and other West African peoples) are remnants of the Neo lithic religion, truncated and modified by later influences .... [I]t was only later, after the 'urban revolution,' that as male rulers and priests become powerful, 'the status of the goddess in all her manifestations' was low ered. . . . [Before that,] the basic social institution was the matriclan, and the 'land would generally have descended in the female line.'"12 Other schol ars suspect that the pre-Indo-European stratum of the Indus Valley civiliza tion may have shared many characteristics with Neolithic Old Europe.13 The familiar Hindu goddesses of Vedic mythology would then, like the classical Greek goddesses, be understood as patriarchally modified versions of earlier Neolithic goddesses. Similar patterns might be found in the Near East, East Asia, the Americas, and elsewhere. Marija Gimbutas was a scholar equivalent in stature to her better-known eastern European colleague Mircea Eliade. Like Eliade's, Gimbutas's work is not without flaws. But if androcentric cultural bias can be cleared away, Gimbutas's work could revolutionize the way we study religion and could become as foundational as that of Eliade. 12 Daniel McCall, "Mother Earth: The Great Goddess of West Africa," in Mother Wor ship: Theme and Variations, ed.
