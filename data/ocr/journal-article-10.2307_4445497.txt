<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EARTH MANUAL, by Malcolm Margolin. 1975. Distributed by Houghton Mifflin Co. (2 Park St., Boston 02107). 184 p. $10.00 hard- back, $5.95 softback. The Earth Manual is essentially a "how to do it" guide for would-be con- servationists. According to the author, most of the book is based on his experi- ence in managing the conservation pro- gram for the Redwood Regional Park in the hills above Oakland, Calif. The author gives a number of excel- lent detailed instructions on how to help control water erosion, fell trees, trans- plant native shrubs and trees, collect, treat, and disperse wildflower seeds, treat injured trees, prune trees, build nature trails and ponds, construct hedgerows to encourage the proliferation of birds and small mam- mals, and, in general encourage the maintenance of wildlife in wilderness areas. Margolin should have been content with writing a practical how-to-do-it guide for distribution through book- stores. Instead, his book is laced with personal opinions about how "kids" behave, with his ideas on how "kids" should be taught, and is replete with anthropomorphic statements of the wildest sort. He uses the term "kids" repeatedly when referring to students ranging from fifth graders to high school seniors. The reader is left con- fused as to the age of the students even though the author talks of recruiting high school students, Cub Scouts, and Boy Scouts to aid in his work. The following quotations should help to clarify my objections. For example: "There are animal droppings-a sure winner with kids since they combine two of their favorite obsessions: animals and turds. " "The litter of half-eaten nuts teaches us that animals are enor- mously sloppy, inefficient feeders-a fact that small children are always glad to hear.' ".'C'mon' I'd yell. 'Let's go out and see how the plants make babies."' "'You mean a stick is going to grow?' a kid once asked me. 'It's not a stick,' I replied. 'It's a magic wand."' "Kids' work is bound to be sloppy and half done. That is the nature of kids." "One of the nicest things about using plants is that plants want to fight ero- sion. In fact, they want to fight erosion even more than you do, and what's more, they know how to do it." One classical example of a combina- tion of teaching technique and anthro- pomorphism: "I would assemble the kids and give them what must have been the craziest speech they ever heard. 'Be quiet, please. You've got to be quiet. It's lunchtime. The trees are eating. Sh-sh-sh! The trees in the forest are always eating. It's always lunchtime. No wonder the trees are so fat. Just look at the bellies on them. They eat all day long, all night long, every day of the year. Eat, eat, eat. Millions of mouths, always eating. No wonder trees don't move and run around and jump. They don't have time. All they have time to do is eat. The earth is like a huge ban- quet table, and all their lives they sit at the table, eating, eating, growing, grow- ing, swelling, swelling."' Margolin goes on to explain to his "kids" that trees breathe in and out through millions of noses. I submit that Margolin's approach to teaching, his tendency to catorgorize student likes and dislikes regardless of age, and his unnecessary use of anthro- pomorphism, are not consistent with good teaching practice. I find it impos- sible to state for whom the book is written- "kids," or "teachers." Norman A braham Interaction Science Curriculum Project Chico, Calif.</page></plain_text>
