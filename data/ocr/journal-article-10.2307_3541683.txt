The dialogue shared the dominant teleological approach to cosmology with Aristotelianism, but by making the cosmos the product of God's creation it was more readily assimilated to Christian doctrine. Those same virtues later came to appear vices. Even the dialogue's emphasis on the mathematical (which one might have praised as anticipating the mathematization of the natural sciences) has to many seemed no more than Pythagorean mumbo-jumbo. In addition, scholars have struggled to make sense of the dialogue within Plato's authorship. What are Plato's intentions in writing natural science? Doesn't the Phaedo tell us that the physical world is inherently a place of contradictions? Doesn't the Republic proscribe empirical astronomy in favour of abstract geometrical studies? Isn't the Timaeus, then, at best a playful side-show to the real business of philosophy, the study of transcendental forms? Andrew Gregory's Plato's Philosophy of Science is one of a series of recent attempts to explain and raise the profile of this dialogue. The book is presented as an apologia of Plato on the two central charges of being overly teleological and anti-empirical. Gregory's strategies are (a) to show that teleology was a reasonable explanatory model to adopt given the alternative options available to Plato at the time; (b) to deny that Plato was anti-empirical, and (c), perhaps most importantly to Gregory, to demonstrate that Plato's project makes best sense if we take it as concerned with laying the foundations for 'scientific realism'. Gregory's Plato qua philosopher of science, if not qua scientist, is still relevant today. The defence is conducted over ten chapters. Chapter 1 investigates Plato's reasons for subscribing to cosmic teleology. The author makes the familiar point that mechanistic accounts of the cosmos favoured by certain Presocratics appear inadequate as explanations of natural order (one sense of 'kosmos' C British Society for the Philosophy of Science 2003</page><page sequence="2">618 Review in Greek), a point that perhaps particularly applies to complex living beings. Teleology is the preferred account of order on the grounds of both ontological parsimony and epistemological adequacy (contrast, for example the idea that there are many worlds and this one simply happens to be ordered). Chapter 2 considers the evidence from the central books of the Republic that Plato is hostile to empirical astronomy. Gregory argues that the famous images of the cave and the line should be read not just in terms of an onto- logical distinction between changing particulars and eternal 'forms' (the so- called 'Two Worlds' or 'TW' ontology) but should also be seen as plotting a dynamic process of enquiry leading from one to the other. In other words, the study of sensible particulars would be a necessary and integral first step in the discovery of forms. The famous dismissal of the 'things in the sky' Gregory takes to apply only to the particular teaching envisaged for the future philo- sopher rulers, but not to the study of astronomy in general. The chapter concludes by reinterpreting Timaeus 68b-d, often taken to express Plato's general rejection of experimentation, as expressing scepticism limited to our ability to manipulate microscopic entities such as the geometrical particles which make up colours and other perceptible phenomena. The next chapter argues that Plato's teleology should be seen as an attempt to solve the problem (which Gregory sees him as sharing with modern scientific realism) of the underdetermination of theory by data. Gregory finds this problem reflected in the famous paradox of enquiry in the Meno; that is, the problem that enquiry seems possible only if we know what we are looking for (otherwise how else would we recognise it when we came across it?), but if we already know what we are looking for, enquiry is redundant. Reference to good order allows Plato to choose between the different theories compatible with the empirical data. Chapter 4 purports to show that the motions of the heavenly bodies are entirely regular in the Timaeus and that the visible cosmos is, therefore, answerable to precise mathematical analysis, where the Republic allowed this solely for what is invisible and accessible to reason only. Gregory understands this difference in terms of a development in Plato's thought (from the so-called 'middle-period', e.g. Republic, Phaedo, to late writings, e.g. Timaeus, Philebus, and Laws). Chapter 5 assesses Plato's contribution to the development of Greek astronomy. Overall, Gregory's verdict is that while Plato's astronomy marks a progress in terms of bringing together the two hitherto separate traditions of observational astronomy and philosophical cosmology, it con- tained important weaknesses, particularly in the accounts of retrogradation, eclipses (which on Plato's theory would occur too frequently), and the lengths of the seasons, which later astronomers attempted to solve by strategies such as the postulation of epicycles. Chapter 6 does a similar job on Plato and the development of Greek cosmology. Gregory answers the criticism that Plato's description of the planets as animate and intelligent gods marks a return to</page><page sequence="3">The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 619 a pre-scientific and anthropomorphic mode of thought by arguing that these gods are depersonalised and predictable, as opposed to the fickle gods of Greek mythology. He further sees Plato as using intelligence in order to explain how natural order is produced and sustained because there was no concept of physical law in Greek thought. Chapter 7 promotes Plato's geo- metrical atomism as a viable alternative to other historically held versions of atomism. For Plato, physical change is the result of the continual separation and combination of microscopic triangular figures out of which macroscopic bodies are composed. Gregory argues that since the geometrical atoms are not themselves subject to flux, Plato's atomism allows the physical world a large measure of stability (in contrast to the Heraclitean total flux imagined in Plato's Theaetetus, which scholars have sometimes identified as Plato's own position in Timaeus). Chapter 8 turns to the so-called 'receptacle' in which Plato imagines physical transformations to take place. The receptacle has been variously interpreted by scholars as space, or Aristotelian-style matter, or both. Gregory interprets Plato as holding to both descriptions in a manner that ultimately renders the receptacle 'inexplicable and non- explanatory'. However, he explains the move in the dialogue from material to spatial descriptions of the receptacle (e.g. as gold) to spatial metaphors for the receptacle (e.g. as a winnowing basket) with reference to the introduction of geometrical atomism. That is, once change is understood in terms of the motions of microscopic geometrical figures which are themselves changeless, there is no need to postulate matter as a further substratum for these primary triangles. (He quotes Crombie: 'If we are tempted to ask "triangles of what?" we must resist the question. They are simply triangles.'). In Chapter 9, Gregory turns to epistemology, arguing that there is a 'blatant contradiction' within Timaeus between the optimistic claim (37a ff.) that human beings can gain understanding of the cosmos by training their intellects on the regular motions of the planets and the more pessimistic TW theory (27c-29d) accord- ing to which the physical world as subject to continuous change escapes true and stable beliefs. Gregory infers, somewhat surprisingly (given his earlier plea that Timaeus should be considered as a serious work of cosmology), that the dialogue does not contain Plato's doctrines but is merely a 'prototype' of a cosmology. (It wasn't clear to this reader why internal inconsistencies should be any less problematic in a prototype than in a doctrine). In his concluding chapter, Gregory again emphasises that the view of Plato as anti-empirical is unfounded, that he had genuine grounds for espousing teleology, primarily the need 'to meet the demands of his proto-realism in the absence of theories of gravitation, force and physical law', and that his teleology stayed well clear of animism or supernaturalism. In briefly assessing Gregory's contribution, I shall focus on two general claims that structure his study (rather than any of the number of specific</page><page sequence="4">620 Review interpretative points with which one might take issue). These are the claim that Plato is concerned with the foundations of scientific realism, and the claim that there is an important development in Plato's cosmological thought from the middle to the late period. Gregory takes the central point of scientific realism to be whether theories about the physical world can be considered true or not. He acknowledges that the TW theory makes the ascription of such realism to Plato's cosmology problematic since there is a sense in which truth is reserved for statements concerning the eternal forms. He suggests, as we have seen, that this is less of a problem for Timaeus, yet there remain key passages (not only 27c-29d but also 51d-52c) that seem to reiterate TW theory. One possible reply which Gregory could have explored is that, for Plato, theories about the natural world are true to the extent that they represent the natural world as an image of the eternal forms. However, behind Gregory's argument there hides the larger question of whether there was any alternative to realism in ancient philosophy. It has been argued that realism was a mostly unspoken assump- tion by Greek philosophers (cf. M. F. Burnyeat [1982]: 'Idealism and Greek Philosophy: What Descartes saw and Berkeley missed', The Philosophical Review, 91, p. 20, who speaks of an 'inbuilt assumption of realism' in Plato). Gregory might therefore be right to say that Plato was a scientific realist but Plato may have held this position by default in a manner that does not encourage us to think that he was struggling with its foundations in a way that led him to espouse teleology. Another more plausible avenue to teleology, I think, is the one that Gregory mentions only to put to one side: that Plato was motivated by ethical considerations to show how this cosmos represents good order in a way that provides us with guidelines as to right and wrong. The relevance of Meno's paradox (touted in Ch. 3) is only tenuous in that (a) the paradox applies to any kind of enquiry, empirical or otherwise, and (b) the paradox would apply equally to a situation in which there was only one possible theorisation of the empirical data (how would you find this theory if it wasn't already known to you?). Furthermore, Gregory needs to say much more about just how teleology solves the problem of underdetermination: how do we decide according to Plato which of the several mathematical models compatible with empirical data is the best? If the answer is simplicity, more needs to be said about how such simplicity is mathematically represented. On the question of Plato's development, Gregory's efforts to rescue the Republic from charges of anti-empiricism seem ultimately quixotic given his view that an anti-empirical TW theory re-emerges in certain passages of Timaeus. Whilst Gregory rightly points out the importance of the regularity of the planetary motions, part of the problem (from the point of view of consistence within Timaeus) may be that he overstates the case when he says that the motions are entirely regular. The regular motions that Timaeus attributes to the planets are primarily those of the world soul. It is a further</page><page sequence="5">The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 621 question whether these motions translate into entirely regular planetary motions. There is reason to think that even if (as Gregory emphasises) the heavenly bodies are fused through special inseparable bonds, they will still, as bodily, be subject to the residual swaying that the cosmos undergoes. Since the aim of astronomy is not to identify with the motions of the visible planets but with the revolutions of the world soul, any irregularity that we might observe in the visible planets is quite compatible with Timaeus' overall view as to the ends of astronomy. Another omission is that Gregory does not consider whether perception is sufficiently rich to deliver the conceptual inputs of astronomical knowledge. Timaeus seems consistent with understanding per- ception as merely causally (i.e. not also epistemically) related to astronomical knowledge in a manner that might make the dialogue more consistent with the TW epistemology of the middle period. There are, then, shortcomings in Gregory's arguments for his central claims. Yet this book remains an engaging and imaginative defence of Plato, the natural philosopher, which surely succeeds in its primary aim of demonstrating the interest that Plato should hold to historically-minded philosophers of science.</page></plain_text>
