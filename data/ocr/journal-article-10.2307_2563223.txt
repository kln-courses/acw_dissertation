This paper assesses critically both the strong theoretical claims and the empirical work of a number of structural marxists in analyzing the geography of advanced societies. Such work offers a holistic mode of explanation that has important philosophical affinities with Hegelian idealism. In explanation, reified entities such as capital are treated as the formal cause while people are regarded as the efficient cause, the mere carriers of a structural logic. This perspective raises a number of serious theoretical problems that are not resolved, including the status of individuals as a creative force in shaping events, the ontological status of structures, the relationship between consciousness and struc- ture, and the tendency to functionalism and teleology in explanation. These shortcomings have severe consequences for empirical study. The fundamentally economic nature of the central categories provide at best a partial analysis and not a general comprehension of society as a whole. If applied literally, key categories, such as the dichotomous class system, fit poorly with empirical events. However, if adjusted to match historical events, they depart markedly from the form of the theoretical structure. The result is a confused interplay between theory and empirical study, and a tendency toward the mystification of causal processes and the denigration of empirical study in order to sustain the integrity of the theoretical argument. Key Words: structuralism, functionalism, holism, reification, capital, class, agency, empirical study. Anotable theoretical development in human geography and related fields in sociology and planning over the past decade has been the emergence of an ambitious radical tradition derived from structural marxism. Aside from some skirmishes in the literature, a critical as- sessment of this tradition has not yet been made in geography, an oversight that is the more sur- prising in light of the extravagant claims that have often been advanced for the position (see, however, Claval 1977 and Saey 1978). David Harvey, perhaps the most widely read marxist geographer, argues that "the only method capable of uniting disciplines in such a fashion that they can grapple with issues such as urbanization, economic development and the environment, is that founded in a properly con- stituted version of dialectical materialism as it operates within a structured totality in the sense that Marx conceived of it" (Harvey 1973, p. 302, emphasis added). Later, he adds, "I re- gard the channels through which surplus value circulates as the arteries through which course all the relationships and interactions which define the totality of society" (Harvey 1973, p. 312, emphasis added). So too, Richard Peet optimis- tically identified a radical science that "strips away diversions, exposes existing explanations to criticism, provides alternative explanations which trace the 'relationship' between 'social problems' at the surface and deep societal causes, and encourages people to engage in their own theory construction" (Peet 1977a). To this ambitious manifesto is added the intoxicat- ing promise of "a radical political program for restructuring society," around which "develops a culture which reflects the experience and the wishes of a re-awakened people" (Peet 1 977a). Such confident and sweeping claims to meth- 30</page><page sequence="2">Structural Marxism and Human Geography 31 odological, theoretical, and practical com- pleteness invite a critical response; indeed, we might go further and state that any claim to uni- versalism, if it is to be taken seriously at all, re- quires the most searching and challenging examination. But to undertake such a critique is daunting, not least for the range of what cur- rently passes for marxist analysis: a wide spec- trum of published work that makes the marxian designation imprecise, if not self-contradictory (Hook 1980). Beneath this broad canopy there are, however, two major traditions, which Gouldner (1980) has recently referred to as the two marxisms. His distinction of scientific and critical marxism has been widely recognized in social theory, though a varying terminology has served to accentuate different aspects of the dualism: for recent authors, the descriptive couplets have also contrasted theoretical as op- posed to historical marxism, and structuralism as opposed to humanism (Thompson 1978b; Johnson 1978). The distinction is frequently that of a theoretical treatment of political economy vis-d-vis concrete historiographic study. For rea- sons that need further clarification (though some answers are suggested below), human geogra- phy has with surprisingly few exceptions appro- priated the political economy tradition, which is conventionally presented as the orthodox reading of Marx. In light of its dominance in human geography, it will be the target of much of our critique, though some attention will also be given to the historiographic work as a heterodoxy that adds its own challenges to the structural tradition. Some might see this paper as an ungracious response to Peet's invitation "to see radical ge- ography systematically evaluated for what it has to offer" (Peet 1978). The paper presents a critique rather than an appreciation, for two major reasons: firstly, the literature under discus- sion already makes its own case enthusiastically (but uncritically), and secondly, a final judgment would require far more space than is available here. It is our expectation that critical analysis permits more satisfactory scholarship to be at- tained. Moreover, scepticism need not imply outright rejection, and we would certainly sym- pathize with some of the moral force of Marx's condemnation of social relations in market societies. So, too, it is through self-consciously marxian analysis in geography that discussions of power have been introduced, challenging the politically inert categories of neoclassical economics-though to suggest thot questions of power necessarily imply a marxist perspective would be to ignore a range of alternative posi- tions in social theory. Marxion analysis has helped to demystify the categories used to ex- amine market economies, revealing the social interests and social relations of domination im- plied by talken-for-granted economic categories. However, as we shall show, marxian theory in geography is inclined to its own forms of mystifi- cation and conceptual and theoretical stasis. Urban geographers seeking to understand the industrial city have been commended to aban- don Robert Parlk's interpretation of Chicago, for the earlier analysis of Manchester by Engels (Harvey 1973, pp. 131 -34). But in the preface to The Condition of the Working Class in En- gland, the youthful Engels observed that "it is essential to have an adequate knowledge of the way of life of the proletariat if one is to form a sound judgement on the merits of socialist theories.... Our German theorists have far too little knowledge of the world as it actually exists . . . [they] held preconceived views about the proletariat, which are as ludicrous as they are absurd" (Engels 1958, pp. 3-4). It is ironic (as we shall argue) that much marxist worlk in ge- ography has foundered upon exactly the some shortcoming of conceptual and theoretical fore- closure that Engels criticized among his contem- poraries. The relations among theory, concept, and geographical circumstances emerge as highly problematic. This impasse is tied in part to the abstract realms of Hegelian philosophy and its holistic argument, where such terms as totality and essence square uncomfortably with empiri- cal analysis. It is precisely this philosophy of structure and holism that Harvey, Peet, and others adhere to (as illustrated in the quotations above) which frustrates the empirical examina- tion of advanced societies by marxist geog- raphers. The problematic relations between philosophical holism and geographic reality will provide the focus of our critique. Marxism as Holistic Philosophy Holistic and Individualistic Explanation Explanation in social science is often divided into those explanations that are holistic and those that are nonholistic or individualistic, al- though the latter can be a misleading term</page><page sequence="3">32 Duncan and Ley (Phillips 1976 Lukes 1973; O'Neill 1973; Ryan 1973). These are very broad categories, and there are important differences of opinion among the proponents of both forms of expla- nation. In general, social scientists who adopt the nonholist position believe that large-scale social events such as war, culture, or capitalism are the products of the interaction and interrela- tions among the individuals who participate in these events, and that their explanation can in principle, although not necessarily in practice, be reduced to statements about the actions of the participating individuals. Holists, on the other hand, believe that such a reduction is theoreti- cally impossible, holding that large-scale social events are emergent and unrelated to the con- scious actions of the individuals who participate in them. Typically, a supra-individual entity sui generis, with a "logic" or properties funda- mentally its own, is portrayed as the active causal variable, while individuals are viewed as passive agents of this larger entity. There is an essential ontological difference between these two positions. It is not merely a matter of how much freedom particular people may have in the face of their sociohistorical context, which of course is an empirical question; nor is it a ques- tion of the scale at which one chooses to view a particular social phenomenon. Although in this paper we will argue against a holistic form of explanation that can be found in the writing of many structural marxist geog- raphers, this is not to endorse a position that is individualistic or idealistic in the-sense that direct reference only to ideas, reasons, or intentions is likely to be adequate for any given explana- tion. Quite to the contrary, in many areas of research the focus of attention is properly on macrostructures, whereas individual action can- not be fully explained without reference to the contexts under which individuals act. Reasons need not be synonymous with causes; much of social life is a result of the unintended conse- quences of the cumulative actions of large numbers of past and present actors. The relations among the many actors may become pat- terned or structured; they may become in- stitutionalized and taken for granted. Individuals may be unaware of all the causes of their be- havior, and intentions may form only a portion of the explanation of action. However, we suggest that macroscale social structures should be precisely defined, that they do not have au- tonomy or an existence that is not ultimately re- ducible to cumulative human actions and in- teractions, and that the processes linking struc- ture or context and individual or social action need to be carefully specified. Although any given individual may be rela- tively powerless in the face of a historic context, these conditions are not active, transcendental forces beyond human activity. They have no telos, no inner logic, and no active causal prop- erties of their own. Though individuals may not be free to transcend their social context, neither are they passive agents of a larger force such as "culture," the "logic of capitalism," or the "mode of production." Many of the marxists in geography draw freely on a structural-holistic branch of marxism. Not all marxists are holists, however; Marx himself at- tempted to reject the dualism between the indi- vidual and society and the ensuing need for a transcendental object. In some writings, how- ever, he tended to lapse into a holistic interpre- tation of economic structures. This tension be- tween individualistic and holistic explanations was inherited by Lenin, who was never able to resolve it. Althusser, and many marxists since Marx, have resolved it in favor of holism. Of the different varieties of holism, the one that principally concerns us here is known as or- ganicism, and contains the major claims of most holists in social science.1 The five basic claims of organicism are as follows: (1) The analytic approach proves inadequate when applied to society or to reality as a whole. (2) The whole is more than the sum of the parts. From a knowledge of the parts alone, the emergent properties of the whole cannot be predicted. After knowledge of the whole has somehow been obtained, this cannot be re- duced to the properties and summation of the parts. (3) The whole determines the nature of the parts. (4) The parts cannot be understood in isola- tion from the whole. (5) The parts are dynamically interrelated and interdependent (Phillips 1976, p. 6). Organicism is very different from the claim that it is sometimes useful to refer to entities such as institutions rather than naming all of the indi- viduals that compose the institution. It is also different from the claim that although institutions have an ontological status they are humanly created and maintained and have no self- determination (Phillips 1976, p. 6). As we shall</page><page sequence="4">Structural Marxism and Human Geography 33 see, the position of many marxists in geography is much closer to what we have identified as organicism. It is understandable that it should be so, given the Hegelian background out of which marxism arose. The Holism of Hegel It has been argued that Hegel's idealist notion of Geist, or world spirit, has served as a pro- totype for Durkheim's "collective consciousness" and Kroeber's superorganic concept of culture (Duncan 1980). Hegel's concept of Geist has also greatly influenced marxists and through them marxist geographers, and therefore it will repay us to examine his ideas more closely. For Hegel, true knowledge lies in understanding Geist and its relationship to the world. Hegel considered Geist to be all-comprehensive and active, a force that, in the course of its develop- ment, has divided itself into a realm of spirit and a realm of nature. He argued, however, that this division of Geist into natural and spiritual spheres is only temporary and that eventually it will be aufgehoben, that is, it will transcend itself and become one. Geist is not something apart from nature, for nature is a part of Geist. Hegel did not deny the ontological status of objects in the world; he merely claimed that Geist is act- ing in and through these objects. In order to un- derstand Geist, then, "we must understand its concrete working in the 'material' of the world" (Bernstein 1971, p. 30). Geist must actualize itself, which it does by objectifying itself in the world. All objects in the world, although they may appear as nothing other than brute objects to the ignorant, are in fact Geist. The implica- tions of this are immense, for this means that Geist is both mountains and institutions, oceans and men's passions-it is all things. Of all the objects in the world, however, it is man who plays the central role in the development of Geist. It is man, according to Hegel, who is the agent of Geist and through whom Geist ex- presses itself in history. Hegel relied on the aris- totelian distinction between efficient and formal causes; Geist is the formal cause and man is the efficient cause through which Geist functions. From the notion that Geist, which also can be translated as Reason, guides the world, it is but a short step to the position that the world is ra- tional. Hegel claimed that if, rather than looking at the world from the viewpoint of the indi- vidual, one takes a world historical perspective, then one can see that there is "an inner logos to the seemingly chaotic multiplicity of events" (Bernstein 1971, p. 18). Although the history of the world may appear to be the antithesis of rationality, Hegel argued that this apparent confusion is merely "the cunning of Reason," which, through conflict, drives Geist toward its own rational ends. Hegel placed great stress upon viewing the world holistically, for its es- sence is Geist, which pervades everything. Geist is the driving force behind specific peoples and civilizations, evolving dialectically through conflict and tension between opposing forces (Hegel 1953, p. 89). It is this dialectic of con- flicting forces that accounts for movement in history; it is, to use the colorful phrase favored by some holists, "the motor of history." In short, Hegel viewed human beings as es- sentially passive, as incapable of shaping the world. It is Geist that is the subject and men, women, and the objects of the world that are the predicate. Hegel did not view Geist as sep- arate and isolated from the world of human beings and objects but as internally related with it, as different sides of the same thing, that is, he saw them dialectically. Each needs the other to affirm itself, each is a facet of the other, moving toward the other, toward unity, oneness. From Hegel to Marx Marx came under the sway of Hegelian philosophy early in his career, and although he subsequently broke violently with Hegelianism, he did not totally escape its influence. Hegel's impact upon Marx is common knowledge; in fact, according to Dupr6 (1974, p. 703), "If there is anything that characterizes present day Marxist scholarship in the West, it is its concern with the relationship of the ideas of the great German idealist to those of Marx."2 The perva- sive infiltration of Hegelian influences in Marx's writing has been noted by critics like Kolakowski (1978), revisionists like Althusser (1969) (who regard them as pollutants to be expunged), and by more sympathetic authors such as Bernstein (1971) and Oilman (1971). Ollman's (1971) discussion is particularly relevant, for it has provided an important source for radical geographers (see, for example, Harvey 1973, pp. 287-89). He develops at some length the logical continuities between Hegel and Marx:</page><page sequence="5">34 Duncan and Ley Hegel constructed the framework described here in order to treat ideas, characterizing what I have called the "whole" as "Absolute Idea" or "Reason." Marx's criticism is always directed against how Hegel chose to apply this framework and his preferred subject matter, and never against the relational quality of his units or the fact of system which this entails (Ollman 1971, p. 34). Marx broke with Hegel over the issue of ide- alism. To Marx it was not Geist that needed to objectify itself, it was people who had this need. Marx arrived at this position through his reading of Feuerbach's critique of Hegel. In his book, The Essence of Christianity, Feuerbach (1957) in effect turned Hegel's philosophy "upside down." He did this by subjecting Hegel's philosophy to what he called transformational criticism, which simply consists of inverting the subject and the predicate. Geist is no longer the subject, the formal cause, which expresses itself through in- dividuals, the efficient cause. For Feuerbach, people are the subject, the formal cause, and Geist is simply a human product, a product of alienation. Marx clearly showed the influence of Feuerbach's ideas in his early as well as his later work, although he was critical of Feuerbach for not going far enough in eliminating idealism from his concept of human beings (Marx 1 967b, pp. 316-17; Marx 1967a, Vol. 1, p. 19; Marx 1972, p. 107; Schrag 1975, p. 25). However, despite Marx's opposition to idealism, he in places lapsed into a transcendental idealist mode of thinking himself, seemingly endowing such entities as "capital" with an inexorable and mysterious power over men and women. Thompson argues this point and claims that "capital has become an idea which unfolds itself in history." He continues: In the Grundrisse-and not once or twice, but in the whole mode of presentation-we have exam- ples of unreconstructed Hegelianism. Capital posits conditions "in accordance with its immanent essence." . . . Capital posits this and that, creates this and that, and if we are to conceive of capitalism ("the inner construction of modern soci- ety") it can only be as "capital in the totality of its relations" (Thompson 1978b, p. 253).3 Although Marx's transformation of Hegel re- moved the concept of Geist, the transformation retained much of the basic structure of the Hegelian argument. The world spirit was re- placed in Marx by a world system, the system of capitalism (Hamilton 1974, p. 90). He also re- tained a teleological perspective on history. Rather than the Hegelian view of Geist gradu- ally transforming itself as it moves toward a higher and higher plane on its quest for the in- evitable perfection of world unity, Marx's trans- formation yielded a view of human beings gradually transforming themselves as they move inexorably upward from stage to stage until they reach social perfection in communist society. Similarly, Marx followed Hegel in view- ing the process by which history unfolds as the dialectical process of conflict between opposing forces which yields a new synthesis which is in turn contradicted, and so on, onward and up- ward. Again, it has been argued that Marx, like Hegel, subscribed to a philosophy of internal re- lations (Oilman 1971, p. 37). In this view all things are internally related to each other. "The full truth about any one thing includes (because of internal relations) the truth about everything" (Oilman 1971, p. 38). The whole is not simply conceived of as the sum of the parts, for the whole is an element of each part. Knowledge of a part therefore presupposes a knowledge of the whole. A Structural Marxist Tradition Many marxist geographers have apparently been influenced by such writers as Althusser, Castells, and the French School of structural marx- ism as well as by Marx himself. Althusser and the French structural marxists have taken the Hegelian idealist elements from Marx and de- veloped them to an extreme form. This is de- spite the fact that they claim to despise Hegelian marxism, by which they refer to the work of certain marxists who emphasize the social- psychological concept of alienation also derived from Hegel. Althusser believes that Marx even- tually rejected Hegelian idealism in part be- cause Geist, the "Idea," is replaced by struc- tures. However, Althusser himself states that he has retained the priority of the totality over the elements, the dialectic, contradictions, and also the belief that human beings are merely "bear- ers" or agents of structures (Althusser 1972, p. 183).4 One could argue that structures, because they are above and beyond the empirical, con- crete world, are equally as transcendental as Geist; the mode of reasoning, therefore, is pure</page><page sequence="6">Structural Marxism and Human Geography 35 idealism. Other examples of the Hegelion overtones of Althusser's writings include his indif- ference to an empirical verification of theories and his comparison of true knowledge to math- ematics whose truth is internal to its logic, not dependent upon external reality (Althusser and Balibar 1970, p. 59). In fact, as E. P. Thompson, a marxist who rejects holism, has declared: If there is a "marxism" of the contemporary world which Marx or Engels would have recognized in- stantly as an idealism, Althusserian structuralism is this. The category has attained a primacy over its material referent; the conceptual structure hangs above and dominates social being (Thompson 1978b, p. 205). Contemporary structural marxism can be subjected to Marx's own critique of reification, by which he objected to "seeing relations between men as relations between things" and to analyses that distort social reality by "obscuring the latter's character as an ongoing human pro- duction, viewing it instead in thing-like categories appropriate only to the world of na- ture (Marx 1 967b, p. 425; Berger and Luckman 1967, p. 61; Israel 1971). The critique can also be applied to Marx's own work in places, as has been pointed out earlier. While we do not mean to imply that marxist geographers are all to be associated with Althus- ser's extreme version of structuralism, although some clearly are, we intend to show that their work represents a continuity with this structural tradition and not a radical break from it (Peet and Lyons 1981).5 The Holist Claims of Marxist Geography Many of the marxist geographers explicitly support the holistic claims of structural marxism, and as such they are linked to the idealist Hegel- ian background that we have developed above.6 Capitalism, Society, or other hypos- tatized abstractions are substituted for Hegel's Geist. One can see that the language in the following quotations from the work of geog- raphers represents Hegelian ontology in which parts are "internally related manifestations" or "moments" in the development of the whole. David Harvey, perhaps the most influential of the marxists in geography, draws heavily on im- portant elements of Oilman's interpretation of Marx. In the final chapter of Social Justice and the City, he lays out an ontology, which is that of internal relations (Harvey 1973, p. 288). He ar- gues, following Oilman, that society must be understood as a "totality of internally related parts with inner laws of transformation" (Harvey 1973, p. 296). Anderson (1973, p. 3) writes that "a port . .. must be . .. situated within the totality that gives it its specific significance," while in order to understand facts one must under- stand their "relations to their own past develop- ment and inherent potentialities for the future." Santos (1977, p. 4) claims that one must grasp "the particular as a scission of the whole, a mo- ment of the whole as well as the whole repro- duced in one of its fractions." So too Walker (1978, p. 168) states that: Capitalist urbanization partakes of the contradictions and movements of capitalist development. Urbani- zation is not, of course, a mere reflection of an or- ganic totality, but rather an internal relation of the whole of capitalism. Elsewhere we find that the socioeconomic for- mation, in typically Hegelian fashion, "expresses the unity and the totality of the diverse spheres-economic, social, political, cultural" (Santos 1977, p. 4). Harvey refers frequently to a "totality" being "structured by the elaboration of relationships within it" and a totality such as capitalism that "seeks to shape the parts so that each part functions to preserve the existence and general structure of the whole." He con- tinues, "transformations" of labor power, surplus, or other "reflections of all social relationships within a given mode of production" occur through contradictions, thus restructuring the whole. Thus, "the evolution of society as a total- ity must therefore be interpreted as the result of contradictions established both within and be- tween structures" (Harvey 1973, pp. 288-89, 293). Furthermore, the meaning of a society "can be grasped only on the level of the totality" (Santos 1977, p. 7). Marxism as Reified Theory The Geographers' Use of Reified Entities Holism usually involves reification, which is a fallacy by which mental constructions or abstrac-</page><page sequence="7">36 Duncan and Ley tions are seen as having substance and causal efficacy (Berger and Pullberg 1964-65; Israel 1971; Keat and Urry 1975). These abstractions are usually portrayed as organismic or machine- like entities having self-direction and power over women and men. Examples of such reified supra-individual entities, found in the writings of the marxist geographers, include: capitalism, capital, labor, social formation, capitalist mode of production, contradictions, the state, class, society, and the market. Despite the fact that in various programmatic statements structures are said to be dialectically related to individuals, it is supra-individual wholes that are invariably the active subjects in the marxist geographers' anal- ysis while individuals, the parts, are the objects acted upon. Castells and Harvey in the following two statements assert that the terms class and capitalism are not just summary descriptions for capitalists, so that one cannot interpret words such as capital as simply shorthand terms mean- ing groups of capitalists. For example, Castells (1977, p. 320) writes: "But if the representatives of a social class do not always know how to rec- ognize themselves, the class itself knows its own interests, in the sense that its unconscious logic tends to sweep away whatever does not serve its interests."7 Here class is presented as an entity that acts in spite of the inaction of members of the class, who are passive agents swept along by its "unconscious logic." Harvey (1975b, p. 20) writes that capitalism "opens up fresh pastures for the bourgeoisie to accomplish its historic mission." Here, capitalism works in the interest of the bourgeoisie but clearly is distinguishable from members of the bourgeoisie. Often the reifica- tions take on an organismic quality, for exam- ple, capital "needing" to increase and multiply, capitalism maturing, and imperialism maturing (Santos 1975, p. 347; Blaut 1975, pp. 6, 13). Or again, there are such phrases as the mode of production makes demands, capitalism devises solutions, capital throws its weight, social forma- tions and modes of production write history, the market mechanism is the culprit, and history vic- timizes people (Walker 1978, pp. 168-69; Harvey 1978a, p. 14; Santos 1977, p. 5; Har- vey 1972, p. 10; Harvey 1975d, p. 54). Santos speaks of the socioeconomic formation as an organism, society as a "coherent social or- ganism" that evolves according to "systematic laws," and the mode of production as a "genus," the social formation as a "species." He refers to rising productive forces as "mutations" that "gather speed" (Santos 1977, pp. 4-5; Santos 1975, pp. 353-54). Peet, following Al- thusser, writes: "Each instance of the social for- mation moves through time with its own rhythm, unevenly developing relative to other instances, with which it nevertheless is interrelated into an organic whole" (Peet and Lyons 1981, p. 194). Blaut (1975, pp. 3, 6) also seems to favor the use of organic terminology, speaking of nations as hybrid organisms, and capitalism as an evolving organism with survival strategies. Marx- ist geographers have not been alone in using organic analogies. Most holists, from Hegel on- ward, have believed that supra-individual wholes are greater than the sums of their indi- vidual parts and that the biological organism is a prime example of a whole that is greater than its parts.8 However, few biologists today would subscribe to that theory, and, furthermore, the processes being compared are fundamentally different.9 Evolutionary terminology has in the post been common in several of the social sci- ences, including cultural geography and anthropology. Such language is usually indica- tive of teleological or functional reasoning. Phenomena evolve in particular ways because these are useful or essential to their survival. As we will explain below, such statements tend to be tautological and empirically untestable, therefore useless as forms of explanation. Some of the other reifications commonly used in this literature evoke mechanistic and physical metaphors. Examples include: the mode of production drives the social formation through time, contradictions fly off and become em- bedded, contradictions erupt and propel capitalism, contradictions force their way to the surface, and imperialism is the engine which powers the system of capitalism (Peet 1979, p. 167; Peet 1977b; Walker 1978, p. 169; Blaut 1975, p. 13). One wonders just what could pos- sibly be meant by such highly reified and anthropomorphic statements as the following: As class relations move over space, they pick up qualities from the regions of a social formation, that is, from the history of the local interaction between a mode of production and environmental space, and at a wider scale from the histories of other social formations. Class relations become infused with the direct and indirect effects of the contents of regions and environments, previous and "future" moments in the history of a mode of production (which have become temporarily frozen in space) ... (Peet 1979, p. 167).</page><page sequence="8">Structural Marxism and Human Geography 37 The subjects of these sentences are so abstracted from reality that the sentences become procti- colly meaningless. Some of the statements listed above may be metaphorical; however, al- though they may be intended to be evocative or polemical, they nevertheless must be crit- icized as irresponsible. One does not always know which metaphors are to be taken seriously as explanations and which are not. There is a fundamental mystification concerning process. We do not know what "capital throwing its weight" means; statements such as this do not constitute scientific analysis. However, we do know that capital is used here in a reified sense and that whatever processes are at work are being obscured. Other statements, however, are perhaps meant to be taken seriously. Statements such as "capitalism devises solutions" or "the mode of production drives the social formation through time" seem to be offered as analytic statements. Again, however, because capitalism or mode of production are not "things" that can seek or intend, the true under- lying processes at work are mystified. Reification, which has sometimes been re- ferred to as the fallacy of misplaced concrete- ness, is an empirical rather than a logical error. It involves attributing substance, power, activity, and sometimes intentionality to abstract con- cepts. One common claim of holism, that the whole determines the nature of the parts, is found in the writing of the marxist geographers in the form of capital or some other reified entity causing men to act in certain ways regardless of their reasons, intentions, or desires. This type of analysis obscures the true underlying processes by which the actions of individuals produce the structural conditions under which they act and through which these conditions may later be- come constraining or coercive (Agnew and Duncan 1981; Lukes 1977). Although the broad social and economic context within which indi- viduals act may not be directly traceable to specifiable actors, to suggest that it must, then, be determined by forces above and beyond men and women is a mystification. Unintended consequences of action may at times be in di- rect contradiction to the intentions of individuals who act. However, although suprahuman forces such as capitalism appear autonomous, it may simply be because the multitude of actions both historical and contemporary that produce capitalist structures appear anonymous. Fur- thermore, and most importantly, one could say that to the extent that marxist geographers be- lieve capitalism to be a determining force, other types of explanation are believed unnecessary, and many important explanatory factors are precluded from the analysis. The Logic of Wholes The reified categories of the marxists are not only granted a life of their own, but they also have a purpose, or a telos: they move toward some historically determined end. Clearly these wholes are not guided by the will of people (the parts) for, as we shall discover, this is ruled out. How, then, are the wholes guided down "the path of history?" The answer is that the wholes are thought to have a set of internal laws, an inner logic. Santos (1977, p. 4) expresses this belief when he writes: "Stages along a process" . . socioeconomic for- mations can be understood only within the framework of a totalizing movement, all of whose elements are variables interacting and evolving to- gether, governed by the law of the whole. Society evolves systematically, as "a coherent social or- ganism whose systematic laws .. . were the su- preme laws, and standard measures for all the other, more specific regularities." This claim is of course in line with the holist view that structures must be analyzed at their own level, that they are not reducible to a lower level. But we are reminded to sift carefully through the vast number of events that make up the world in order to discern this logic. Some facts are critical to "the logic" while others are merely "noise." In this regard: "Special factors" also arise in relation to foreign trade which can confuse, conceal and distort mat- ters. The significance of such factors to actual histori- cal situations is not denied . . . they are just not re- garded as crucial for understanding the inner logic of the capitalist mode of production (Harvey 1975b, p. 14). Upon reading this quotation, one is immediately reminded of Hegel's views on an inner logic. Hegel also believed that there is an "inner logic" at work "driving history" inexorably forward to its preordained end. Hegel, like marxist geog- raphers, believed that this inner logic is difficult to discern, that one has to sift through a "seemingly chaotic multiplicity of events" in order to grasp it.</page><page sequence="9">38 Duncan and Ley It is held that some observers may occasionally catch glimpses of this logic, sufficient at least to allow them to move forward to a higher level of awareness, that is, to move history. Marxists, in contrast, are held to be better equipped to de- tect this logic: We will usually be able to identify the underlying logic dictated by capital accumulation at work. But the underlying logic does not, and indeed cannot uniquely determine outcomes. The latter have to be understood in terms of the balance of forces ... economic, social, political, ideological, competi- tive, legal, military, and the like . .. through which interest groups and classes become conscious of the contradictory underlying logic and seek by their ac- tions to "fight it out" to some sort of resolution (Har- vey 1975b, p. 18). This is an interesting statement in part because it is so Hegelian. Just as Hegel tells us that when people become conscious of the underlying logic of the world, when they realize that Geist is everything, then they will arrive at the resolu- tion of history; so we are told here that a resolu- tion of sorts is to be achieved when people become conscious of the underlying logic. Fur- thermore, this statement raises the issue of what this internal logic or low is; presumably it refers to the manner in which some process operates. Harvey claims that marxists can understand this process, that they can decipher the logic. How- ever, on the some page we are told that the task for geographers is "to specify how the 'inner logic' of the capitalist mode of production, abstractly conceived, relates to the concrete realities, the phenomenal forms of the historical process" (Harvey 1975b, p. 18, emphasis added). In other words, geographers under- stand the logic only in the abstract but not as it relates to real circumstances. This is a very real problem if one hopes to translate the insight into practical action in the everyday world. Further- more, there is the statement that the underlying logic of capital accumulation does not itself de- termine outcomes, that we must understand it in terms of a balance of forces, "economic, social, political, ideological, competitive, legal, mili- tary, and the like." This merely raises a new set of problems. First of all, we are told that the logic applies to capital accumulation and this must be balanced against other "forces." Do these forces each have their own logic? Presumably they do, although nowhere is this spelled out. More troubling than this is the issue of what exactly these forces are. Because these forces collec- tively determine "outcomes" it is an issue of no small importance. What, for example, is the difference between "economic" and "competi- tive" forces, between "political," "ideological," and "legal" forces, and how are they all distinct from what are identified as "social" forces? And what might the category labeled "and the like" contain? If our understanding of the logic entails an understanding of these "forces" as Harvey describes them, then our understanding will in- deed remain abstract. If we are told that out- comes are a product of a hidden logic plus everything else, then for from providing a pro- found insight, one has not left the prescientific realms of tautology and nominalism. People as Agents of Wholes We have seen that structural marxists reify en- tities such as capital and the mode of production and endow them with a power to do things. It is these reified wholes which shape the course of history. The "guide" or "pattern" that determines the direction of these wholes is the "internal laws" or the "logic" of the whole. It is this which shapes the course of these wholes as they move toward their ultimate goal-communism. The question arises, how do these wholes actually get translated into the concrete contents of the world? How, for example, does capital manage to do things, how does it conduct its "historic mis- sion?" The answer is that it accomplishes its tasks through women and men who are conceived of as its agents. Here as in Hegel we find the aris- totelian distinction between formal and efficient cause. The reified entity, capital, for example, is the formal, i.e., true, cause and human beings are simply the efficient cause. In other words, people are not really a true cause at all, they are simply the means of implementing the goals of the formal cause. This distinction is a favorite device of those who wish to posit a supra-individual entity while at the some time somehow account for the fact that people do in fact appear to do things that produce results. Hegel used this device to explain how men and women were simply the agents of Geist, while Durkheim used it to show that they were the agents of "social facts," and cultural anthropolo- gists and cultural geographers used it to show</page><page sequence="10">Structural Marxism and Human Geography 39 how individuals were the agents of a superor- ganic culture (Duncan 1980). Among the structural marxists, Althusser is most explicit on this subject (Aithusser and Balibar 1970, p. 180). However, Preteceille (1976) also speaks of the "different social agents" of the State. People are merely agents of capitalism, dupes for whom, to quote Anderson (1973, p. 2), "capitalism necessarily appears ... as something other than it really is." People are not conditionally naive but are portrayed as neces- sarily so, for if the reified entities are to be truly active, then individuals must be conceived of as passive and ignorant. Harvey adopts a similar stance when he speaks of "a faction of capital seeking the appropriation of rent either directly (as landlords, property companies, and so on) or indirectly (as financial intermediaries) Here again we find individuals as the agents of the formal cause, landlords and other minions constantly ready to carry out the tasks assigned to them by capital. But capital has other agents as well. It usually "intervenes" in the built envi- ronment "through the agency of state power" (Harvey 1978a, pp. 9, 14). The state also has its agents, which suggests that even the concept of human agents as the efficient cause retreats farther into the background. In fact, at times human agency seems to disappear altogether and we are left with sets of interlocking abstrac- tions, a world seen as a set of abstract categories filled by roles. An example of this is Harvey's (1 978a, p. 12) statement that "capital will likely flow into landlordism." One is reminded here of a comment made by E. P. Thompson (1 978b, p. 267) about the degree of reification in the work of the structural functionalist sociologists, who are, as we shall see later, intellectual bed- fellows of the marxist geographers. "Systems and subsystems," he writes, "elements and structures, are drilled up and down the pages pretending to be people." The Relationship between Consciousness and Structure There is a great deal of confusion in this litera- ture surrounding the relationship between con- sciousness and structures. In much of the writing, the position appears to be that consciousness is of no consequence in explanation. Thus Blaut (1974, p. 39) speaks of the movement of Third World people to Americon ghettos: "I prefer 'tronslocotion' to 'migration' because individual choice has no theoretical relevance here. (The 'decision to migrate,' in this case, is rather like the decision to run from a burning building. So much for migration theory.)" And so much for the perceptions and decision making of people in the Third World! Though Blaut rightly criticizes the individualism of migration theory for positing an individual who makes decisions "all alone" outside any social context, to offer in its stead the holist alternative, the structural model where the individual is reduced to a "nondecisionmaker" is equally one sided. The literature is rife with sim- ilar examples of the rejection of reasons in favor of the "Reason" inherent in a transcendental system. Piclkvance (1976a, p. 65), for example, points out that Preteceille, in his study of the grands ensembles, deliberately eschews questions such as whether the residents are "satisfied," . . . Similarly, the concep- tion of buildings as an expression of the architect's intentions, or the more "sociological" conception which sees them as the outcome of the strategies of various "actors," are both rejected. Such concep- tions give priorities to the actor(s) rather than to the conditions under which they act. The conditions under which people act are the real causes, according to these theorists. Appar- ently none can escape the power of this system, not even the most powerful government offi- cials, for "what is involved is the compulsion of a system in a rapidly advancing state of con- tradiction. In such a situation the 'good inten- tions' of this or that president count for very little" (Peet 1 977b). Not even the will of the capitalist seems to make any difference. Harvey (1 975b, p. 9) is quite blunt about this when he writes with reference to Marx's view of accumulation as a need of capitalism: "Yet this historical mission does not stem from the inherent greed of the capitalist; it arises, rather, out of forces entirely independent of the capitalist's individual will" (emphasis added). It is inconsistent, however, to describe these forces as "entirely independent," for earlier we have seen that the author accepts the notion of internal relations, the whole point of which is that there is no such thing as an entity that is "entirely independent" of any other. Again we do not take issue with the notion that the structural conditions under which people</page><page sequence="11">40 Duncan and Ley act are critical to understanding action. How- ever, to suggest that these conditions are so to- tally separate from people's beliefs, intentions, and strategies that one may ignore conscious- ness is to engage in overstatement. Fortunately, one can retain a concept of people's being af- fected by and in turn affecting structures without positing "forces entirely independent of ... [people's] wills." In short, it is not the presence of constraint that is at fault, but the reification of structures and the resultant truncated model of human beings in this work. Accounts of the process by which the "compul- sion of the system" actually forces individuals to carry out the system's will are very sketchy and unsatisfactory. Harvey (1978a, p. 22), discussing how the system translates its needs into behavior and consciousness, writes, "the new economic order also required that [individuals] . . . had to be made obedient to the cash stimulus and obedient in such a way as to react precisely to the stimuli provided." Perhaps here we are be- ginning to get at some of the mechanisms in- volved. Peet (1975, pp. 567-68) suggests further that marxist geographers should engage in micro-scale analysis that deals with the "com- plex of forces, both stimuli and frictions, which immediately shape the course of a person's life." The mechanisms being suggested here are described in terms of a stimulus-response model, whereby behavior is explained in terms of positive stimuli such as cash and negative stimuli or frictions. A stimulus-response model. is particularly well suited to theorists who posit a transcendental entity that causes behavior be- cause the entity is conceived of as the subject (stimulus) and individuals as objects that re- spond. The model is attractive to holists because it "black boxes" mind and hence no discussion of individual consciousness or intersubjectivity is necessary beyond establishing that people re- spond to the stimuli. The stimulus-response model is usually com- bined with a model of habituation, whereby people become conditioned to a stimulus and automatically, unthinkingly, respond to it. The term most often used when referring to habitua- tion is "ideology." The structure, it is held, instills in individuals a particular habitual way of think- ing in order that they might carry out the will of the structure. Each class is given a type of con- sciousness or ideology which individuals appear to internalize en masse. In this regard, there is "the drive on the part of capitol to inculcate the working class with the 'work ethic' and 'bourgeois values"' (Harvey 1978a, p. 22). Is one to assume that it is not the capitalists who are knowingly trying to instill these values in the working class but, rather, it is the system that is doing it? Gray (1976, pp. 40-41 ) sums up the structural marxist view on this issue as follows: Now each of these classes, in order to continue the existence of the social formation, must be repro- duced and given a set of ideas, beliefs and as- sumptions fitting their position in society. In other words, each class according to its position in the divi- sion of labor must be socialized and receive a different ideology suitable to its class position and destiny. Here we can clearly see the imperatives of the system, that each class is given a set of ideas tai- lored to its position in the whole. And who or what does the giving? It would seem to be some supra-individual entity, which is trying to repro- duce itself by giving people ideas that are useful to its survival. Anderson (1973, pp. 2, 3), who appears to subscribe to this view, writes: "The division of knowledge is useful to the rulers as a control mechanism." One might think from this statement that the "rulers" are consciously trying to manipulate knowledge in order to control people. But this turns out not to be so, for Anderson tells us that ideology is not to be seen in an "idealist" sense as a conspiracy. Again, it apparently is the system that is the subject, working toward its own functional ends through people who are its unconscious agents. In a sim- ilar vein Short (1976, p. 80) argues that: To understand the impact of ideology it is necessary to look at its function in capitalism. Its main function is to suggest to people that their actions spring from their own free will rather than as an adaptation to the economic system. This ideology "does not give individuals a true knowledge of the social structure but inserts them into their practical activities supporting this structure" (Short 1976, pp. 80-81 ). On reading these lines, one is struck by a sense of dojf vu, for was it not Hegel who argued that people in their ignorance believed that they had free will and that they failed to see that man simply "re- flects the development of Geist and is the agent through which Geist expresses itself in history" (Bernstein 1971, pp. 21-22). The words have changed, of course, for structural marxists reject</page><page sequence="12">Structural Marxism and Human Geography 41 the idea that action is directed by a reified supra-individual entity termed a world spirit. Ac- tion for them is directed by "capitalism" or the "social formation." But, whereas the terms may be different, the type of explanation is the same, for in both cases we find a supra- individual entity supposedly directing action. Marxist geographers appear to support what Dennis Wrong (1961) has termed an over- socialized view of man. Each class internalizes the views and patterns of conduct imposed upon it by the reified entity in order for that entity to fulfill its "historic mission." People are there- fore viewed as varying only according to their assignment in a social class, and behaving and thinking in a standardized, habitual fashion within the class. There seems to be no need for a social psychology when one's view of human beings is that they are caught in structures with- out human intentions or purposes. Where people are portrayed as having everything from their consciousness to their material conditions dominated by the place in the structure that they were born into, all that is necessary is some no- tion of Fate. As Kovel (1976, p. 223) states: Man is homo laborans, defined by his situation in the labor process; his psychology is defined then by such traits as would make him want to work, pro- ductively to transform nature, or to exploit those who do work. Depending upon the objective situation, one or another side of these propensities will come to the fore, giving to Man his place in the class strug- gle. To this-which of course corresponds to the term "vulgar Marxism"-all other attributes are mere incidentals, residual categories at best, or positive mystifications. To such an eye, man is a passive creature whose consciousness is simply de- termined by the impingement of material forces. A major difficulty with a diminished or absent concept of consciousness is that it leads to mys- tification in any discussion requiring reference to cognitive processes. The following quotation serves to illustrate this tendency. "Labor seeks its own meanings, partly derived from a rapidly fading memory of artisan and peasant life, but also from the ineluctable imperative to learn what it is to be human" (Harvey 1 978a, p. 34). The mysterious forces here are the notion of a "collective memory" that labor as a class is sup- posed to have and some notion of a "collective drive" or "need." What is this collective memory and what are the processes involved in its oper- ation? What is this need to learn what it is to be human, and how have both of these collective characteristics survived the crushing determinism of the transcendental structures? We are not told. There is here an unwillingness to deal with the admittedly difficult questions of the empirical reality of relations between consciousness and structure. All of these problems stem from the ontological status attributed to structures. Functionalism and Teleology Functionalism has a long and controversial history in social science. Modern functionalism may be traced back to the work of such nineteenth-century theorists as Darwin, Marx, and Durkheim, and in the twentieth century it is best known as the theoretical underpinning of both British social anthropology, as exemplified by the work of Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown, and of the American structural functionalism of Parsons and Merton. More recently, functional explanation has enjoyed a renaissance in the work of the structural marxists, Althusser, Castells, and Poulantzas (Burawoy 1978). The links be- tween the functionalism of the structural marxists and that of the structural functionalists are quite close, although their views are strongly opposed on certain issues. In this regard, it is interesting to note the debt that Poulantzas ( 1979) acknowl- edges to Parsons. Similarly, Harvey (1978b, p. 108) writes in discussing a diagram of the circu- lation of capital: "The diagram looks very 'structuralist-functionalist' because of the method of presentation. I can conceive of no other way to communicate clearly the various dimensions of capital flow."10 Functionalism is a type of holistic explanation. Its basic premise is that wholes, whether they be living organisms or societies, are composed of parts that both form the whole and contribute to its maintenance and development. In order to do this, functionalists try to "grasp the fullness of the interconnected, living, mutually adjusting nature of a social system" (Skidmore 1979, p. 1 1 6). For the functionalist, both in anthropology and in sociology, the function of any given ac- tion is the effect which that action has. Usually, functional theory is an attempt to account for regularities in behavior that do not appear to re- sult from the conscious desires of individuals (Ryan 1970). Explanation is framed in terms of the</page><page sequence="13">42 Duncan and Ley properties of a social whole, whose purposes are served by the actions of individuals. Func- tionalists emphasize the concept of system, for it captures the interrelatedness of wholes. It pro- vides a context in which one can trace the func- tional effects of action. Santos (1977, p. 4) rep- resents this view among the structural marxists when he argues that "society evolves system- atically" and "socioeconomic formations can be understood only within the framework of a total- izing movement, all of whose elements are variables interacting and evolving together, governed by the law of the whole." Castells also makes extensive use of systems terminology and complex flow diagrams in his abstract dis- cussion of contemporary urbanism. Where does the justification of his abstract system lie? Ironical- ly, he turns to the same device as conventional systems theorists like Jay Forrester: "The technique of experimental verification that seems most adequate is that of a simulation model" (Castells 1977, p. 274). Entities such as "society," "capitalism," and "the social formation" are viewed as systems, which are integrated with their own "logic" and set of functional prerequisites or "conditions of re- production," whereby they reproduce themselves: The totality seeks to shape the parts so that each part functions to preserve the existence and general structure of the whole. Capitalism, for example, seeks to shape the elements and relationships within itself in such a way that capitalism is repro- duced as an ongoing system. Consequently, we can interpret the relationships within the totality ac- cording to the way in which they function to pre- serve and reproduce it (Harvey 1973, p. 289). There is further reference to the minimum re- quirements of capitalism in order that it survive the functional working out of the components of capitalism, and the need of social formations to recreate themselves (Piclkvance 1976a, p. 59; Harvey 1972, p. 10; Harvey 1976, pp. 81, 88; Harvey 1978a, p. 14; Walker 1978, p. 168; Peet 1975, p. 564; Gray 1976, p. 39; Wisner 1978, p. 90). In addition to these general func- tional relationships within the system, the fol- lowing phenomena are held to be functional to capitalism or to the social formation: housing, education, urbanization, the physical land- scape, and geography (Gray 1976, pp. 38, 42; Walker 1978, pp. 168-69; Harvey 1978a, p. 9; Peet 1979, p. 165). We are further told that inequality is functional to the system, that the system needs to produce an industrial reserve army, that the function of welfare is to permit unemployment, and that the function of ideol- ogy is to make people think that they have free will (Peet 1975, p. 564; Blaut 1974, p. 40; Short 1 976, p. 80). Again, we must stress that this is not functional for individuals per se but for the needs of the system. The system through the mechanism of ideology, which as we saw above is functional to it, takes individuals and simply "inserts them into their practical activities supporting this structure" (Short 1976, pp. 80-81). Functional theorists have traditionally pro- posed an equilibrium model whereby a system is thought to evolve toward equilibrium. It is ar- gued that the system contains mechanisms that protect its integrity as a system and maintain stasis. The marxist version of functionalism, on the other hand, rejects equilibrium theory at one level and suggests that systems are nonequilib- rioting. This disequilibrium in the system is achieved by the inescapable presence of con- tradictions. It is held that the clashes between the contradictions in the functional needs of the ,capitalist system prevent it from achieving equi- librium and thus push the system forward on its "historic mission"-to a higher level equilibrium (Preteceille 1976, p. 73; Blaut 1975, pp. 1, 6; Peet 1975, p. 566; Peet 1977a, p. 257; Harvey 1975b, pp. 13, 17; Walker 1978, p. 169). Functional explanation has usually been crit- icized for being tautological. Functional theorists assume that a functional model explains the nature of a system. In other words, they believe that things exist in order to fill the needs of a system. And how does one know that some- thing fills the needs of the system? Because it exists. A function exists, therefore, because it is functional, and we know that it is functional be- cause it persists. This tautology, then, does not constitute an empirical proposition or an explanation-it is a definition. Armed with the notion of functionalism, the theorist's research program consists of trying to show how every- thing from "the physical landscape," to "in- equality," to "geography" is functional. Tradi- tional functionalists have usually encountered great difficulty demonstrating that everything is functional, for there are certain elements in a system that appear to be dysfunctional to its continuation. Marxists who subscribe to a func- tional perspective have no such trouble because</page><page sequence="14">Structural Marxism and Human Geography 43 those elements which are dysfunctional to the stability of the system are defined as "contradic- tions," and are seen as being functional to a brooder goal, for they move history to a higher plane. In short, they have gathered in some of the loose ends of functionalism and rendered the tautology logically tighter. By making dys- functional elements functional simply by changing their context, they have removed any possibility of challenging the theory on empirical grounds. Everything is by definition either func- tional to the system or a contradiction that is functional to the dialectical evolution of the sys- tem. Such a theory is perfectly logical but utti- mately vacuous for there is no way of knowing whether or not it is correct. It also raises the issue of teleology, the purpose behind the system. In places, Marx seems to have believed that he had uncovered a logic or telos to history, and this belief remains one of the central tenets of marxism (Burawoy 1978, p. 60). History, it is ar- gued, has a purpose, an end to which it is mov- ing. Just as there is a mission to history, so given the functionalist mode of explanation, classes have a mission to act out the functional needs of society at any given stage in its historic devel- opment. The bourgeoisie, we are told, must ac- complish its "historical mission," the accumula- tion of capital. The capitalist's participation in this "historical mission" does not stem from his own will, but from the need of capitalism (Harvey 1975b, pp. 9, 20). Clearly then, this historical mission has nothing to do with people's con- sciously trying to "shape history." The movement of these systems through history is conceived of as evolutionary change. Capitalist social forma- tions evolve, and the elements of systems evolve, often at different rates (Harvey 1975b, p. 14; Gray 1976, p. 42; Blaut 1975, pp. 5, 12; Santos 1977, p. 6). Quite clearly we can see the reliance here upon an organic analogy; social organisms can be thought to evolve in the same manner that natural organisms do. This evolutionary process, according to the marxists, takes place in stages: "All societies will pass through a definite set of historical stages." At work here are a set of "historically determined laws" that create an "historically determined so- ciety(Blaut 1975, p. 10; Santos 1977, pp. 3, 5). Just as "nature" is guided by a set of laws, the laws of evolution, so is society. The organic ter- minology pervades the discussion of the stages of history. Capitalism "matures" and enters its "final stage." "Consequences at one stage be- come preconditions at the next." Or the process may be described in botanical terms: "The petty commodity mode of production held within it- self the seeds of its own transformation to indus- trial capitalism, and as it unfolded . . ." (Blaut 1975, p. 6; Harvey 1976, p. 88; Blaut 1975, p. 2; Harvey 1975b, p. 14; Walker 1978, pp. 173-74). This evolutionary process is typically characterized by conflict: "Capitalism is a system propelled through time by the eruption of its in- herent contradictions" and, "we have entered a dynamic propelled by the mass force of colliding material events" (Peet 1977b; Peet 1977a, p. 260). These contradictions of dysfunctional ele- ments within a system cause the system to go out of equilibrium and thereby move it forward down its "historically determined course." After the "mechanism of history" has been identified, disequilibriating events are simply explained. The mass student demonstrations in the United States during the 1960's, for example, "resulted from the maturing state of contradiction into which capitalism was moving," while Piclkvance tells us that "state intervention, in Preteceille's felicitous phrase, 'is not a response to the con- tradiction as such but a contradictory response to the terms of the contradiction' " (Peet 1977a, p. 241; Piclkvance 1976a, pp. 62-63). All of this contradiction finally makes capitalism fall into "a state of ultimate contradiction" and history moves on to its next stage (Peet 1977a, p. 261). This teleological explanation implies that there is some Rationality which is guiding events in the world to some preordained goal. This is not the rationality of individuals but of the total- ity. We are arguing, of course, that the position of these structural marxists is highly idealist. Perhaps this can best be illustrated by quoting from Hegel (1953, p. 89) on how the purpose- ful movement of history is accounted for by the dialectic of conflicting forces: The Spirit, devouring its worldly envelope, not only passes into another envelope, not only arises re- juvenated from the ashes to its embodiment, but it emerges from them exalted, transfigured, a purer Spirit. It is true that it acts against itself, devours its own existence. But in doing so it elaborates upon this existence; its embodiment becomes material for its work to elevate itself to a new embodiment. In Hegel's account of the process of history we can see concepts similar to those the structural</page><page sequence="15">44 Duncan and Ley marxists have used: that history has a purpose, that it evolves from stage to stage and that the seeds of the future stage are contained in the former, that the process is fueled by contradic- tions arising within each stage, and that there is an underlying rationality or functionalism to this whole process that keeps it on course. Hegel's philosophy is profoundly compatible with that of the structural marxists, only the words have changed. But perhaps the philosophy of struc- tural marxism is just that, a mere verbal trans- formation of Hegel's claim that the Idea guides the course of history. Marxism as Social Science If Hegel represented an apparent counter- point to Marx's philosophy, then British political economy provided the seeming counterpoint to his social science. Even in his early writings, a major objective was "a careful critical study of political economy" (Marx 1964, p. 63). Main- taining the distinction within the marxian tradi- tion raised earlier between political economy and social history, it is the former genre which usually embodies philosophical holism and its attendant weaknesses concerning a passive model of man, the problematic relations be- tween consciousness and structure, and func- tionalism and teleology as properties of the internal logic of systems. As a result, within marx- ian political economy one commonly finds the displacement of the errors of an undergirding holistic philosophy. As it is the political economy tradition that dominates marxist social science in geography, this section will chart the transmis- sion of structural affirmations into empirical work and indicate the unresolved quandary that has resulted. The Reproduction of Economic Categories The embeddedness of marxist geography in political economy has two consequences we shall now elaborate: firstly, the break with con- ventional social science is less complete than is commonly asserted, and secondly, the claim to a universal set of insights across "the totality of society" is invalid, and may be made only at the cost of a reductionism that sees the world only in economic categories-which is to commit the methodological error of economism. It is a telling coincidence that some of the leading protagonists of a marxist perspective in geography were equally confident in their es- pousal of positivist science in the 1960's, a science that Harvey (1973, esp. Chap. 4) has correctly associated with the interests of rational, techni- cal, and (in his terms) bourgeois control.11 The leading sector of positivist application in human geography was spatial analysis, and the under- pinning of spatial analysis has been neoclassical economics. Neoclassical training has proven particularly fertile for the development of struc- tural marxism, for the shift in emphasis is not as extreme as might be expected. The reversal by structuralists of the categories of neoclassical economics does not lead to their transcen- dence, for both share a fundamentally eco- nomic and narrowly rational view of the world. When Harvey produced his answer to the ghetto problem, it was an answer that remained within the conceptual realm of land economics; as one critic suggested, to make the von Thonen or Alonso model not true, as Harvey wanted, is not to escape their categories and view of the world (Harvey 1973, p. 137; Olsson 1972). Elsewhere, there is the acknowledgment that in the United States the process of the competitive bidding for urban land "is, in most respects, identical to that assumed in neoclassical models of land-use de- termination" (Harvey 1978a). The grounds for Peet's earlier sympathy for the von Thunen model, which has been widely adopted by neo- classical economists, bears striking resemblance to his contemporary structuralist stance. In 1969 he promoted the von Thunen model, as "it al- lows a logically connected system of forces to be advanced as the economic structure underlying the events portrayed" (Peet 1969). The allu- sions to the logic of system, impersonal forces, and deep economic structures lying beneath surface manifestations are equally central to his apparently reformulated structuralist position. It is not difficult to duplicate examples that show how conventional and marxian econ- omists often share the same conceptual do- main, even if their interpretations are reversed. The treatment by radicals of business cycles and urban development (Walker 1978) re- vives much earlier studies by such bastions of establishment economics as Homer Hoyt (1933)</page><page sequence="16">Structural Marxism and Human Geography 45 and Paul Samuelson (1942). In rejecting much of contemporary urban sociology, Castells (1977, p. 123) finds himself most sympathetic to human ecology as occupying a conceptual realm not incompatible with his own. But human ecology is surely the least social branch of sociology. Park's alternative term for the sub- field was biological economics, a label that in- timates both its essentially Darwinian focus upon impersonal, biotic forces and its allegiance to neoclassical economics. Moreover there is a con- sistent root to human ecology: "To a large ex- tent the model may be seen as one of eco- nomic determinism" (Timms 1971). As we will see, the issue of economism continues to be an abiding source of confusion in marxian theory also. The overdependence on economic cate- gories, in his case derived in large part from British political economy, has been criticized in Marx's own work. The French theorist Baudrillard has attacked historical materialism as "too con- servative, too rooted in the assumptions of po- litical economy, too dependent on the system of ideas it seeks to overthrow . .. the difference between Marx and political economy is not as great as their agreement" (Poster 1 975b, pp. 2, 5). So too, Thompson (1978b, pp. 251 -52) sees in Marx's encounters with political economy something that is "obsessive. .. what we have at the end, is not the overthrow of 'Political Economy' but another 'Political Economy.'" The dominantly economic conceptualization of the world becomes problematic when it is overextended and treated as more than a par- tial perspective, for "a capitalist mode of pro- duction is not capitalism" (Thompson 1 978b, p. 346). To collapse the range of social experience to the outworking of deep economic structures is to present an impoverished view of the social, cultural, and political realms of life. Thus capitalism is regarded not as an economic sys- tem but as broadly "as a mode of existence"; urbanism is diminished to "a product of the cir- culation of surplus value"; while the city is iden- tified as merely "a residual unit of labour power" (Peet 1978; Harvey 1973, p. 312; Castells 1976). Social problems in the city are treated as "simply the surface manifestations of a structural process of change which can be understood only at the level of the mode of production" (Lee 1979). One is reminded of Adorno's complaint that to conceptualize problems only in the categories of political economy is to make over the whole world into a giant workhouse. It is particularly in the realms of cultural rela- tions and everyday experience that one finds "the real silences of Marx," and these silences are shared both by land economists and their marxist critics (Thompson 1978b, p. 357). In Alonso's (1 965, pp. 1, 17) neoclassical land-use theory, personality enters the scene only as "a pallid skeleton. . . reduced to that uninteresting individual, economic man." More complex sociocultural models of man and the perceived environment "are undoubtedly important, but no way has been found to incorporate them into the type of theory that will be presented" (Alonso 1965, p. 17). So too, the human ecologists rejected any consideration of cultural values in their discussion of land-use patterns, though "not because they are unimportant, but because the assumptions and point of view of human ecology are not adapted to their treat- ment" (Quinn 1940). Implicit in these state- ments is an anti-humanism that is based on an internal epistemological shortcoming, as the logic of mechanism is conceptually unable to accommodate the social psychology of lived experience. In structural marxism these epis- temological limitations of economic categories are either justified or rationalized theoretically. For example, the theoretical importance of the moral order of lived experience is repressed in favor of the logic of economic structure; percep- tions and preferences are discussed as "purely epiphenomenal"; the notion of urban subcul- tures that exercise real effects is rejected as "a myth rather than a specific social process" (Har- vey 1973, p. 131; Roweis and Scott 1978; Castells 1977, p. 95). Even institutions are re- duced to impotence: "Individual institutions are simply agents of the underlying economic pro- cess. They may modify particular aspects of that process but as agents they cannot change it or be held responsible for it" (Lee 1979). Before the transcendental object, people assume an essentially passive form, and cultural relations, if they appear at all, are granted a predictably derivative status, as they dwindle beneath "the phantom of production" (Baudrillard 1975, p. 17). It is not apparent how such views differ sub- stantially from Althusserian structuralism where, as we saw earlier, men and women become passive carriers of a structural logic they cannot resist: "The true subjects. . . are not . . I'concrete</page><page sequence="17">46 Duncan and Ley individuals'-'real men'-but ... the relations of production (and political and ideological social relations)" (Althusser and Balibar 1970, p. 180). The theoretical requirement for the reduction of human choice and culture identifies structural marxism as a mirror image of the equally ex- treme neoclassical concept of consumer sovereignty. Having dismissed the role of con- sumer choice in the creation of urban land val- ues, Roweis and Scott (1978) turn to "the system of production," the "deep structure" of capitalism. So too, inner-city gentrification is re- garded as being independent of consumer demand; rather it functionally follows "the needs of capitalism." From this perspective, 'gentrification is a back to the city movement all right, but of capital rather than people." It is capital not consumers which generates demand surfaces; people are merely puppets "taking advantage of this returning capital" (Smith 1 979b). A theoretical reversal in the positions of supply and demand has occurred; marxist analysis has its affinities with supply-side economics. These structuralist arguments are misleading for two principal reasons. Firstly, the rejection of individual and social demand factors and the elevation of the reified power of capital do not square with the geographical evidence. "Capi- tal" is for more conservative than the structuralists imagine, and inner-city reinvestment, for example, has been perceived as too risky for entrepreneurs until the power of market de- mand has established itself. Indeed the record shows that rather than expediting gentrification, institutional gatekeepers have raised persistent obstacles during the early critical phases: finan- cial redlining, developer scepticism, and dys- functional by-laws have all been impediments that nonetheless have not thwarted would-be gentrifiers. In some cases of revitalization (nota- bly Society Hill in Philadelphia) the state has been an active source of investment from the beginning, but this need not imply the theoreti- cal primacy of "capital," unless the state is itself treated as simply an expression of "capital." Moreover, even this contingency (were it true) would not require a structural explanation, for it could be accommodated equally within con- ventional elite theory. There is a second weak- ness in the structuralist argument. To propose that "capital" operates as a formal cause in gentrification is to ignore the realities of areal differentiation; like the isotropic plain, capital then abolishes geography. If capital can create landscapes at will, why does it systematically select certain sites rather than others? Why are only certain neighborhoods (with a central loca- tion and high levels of architectural and environ- mental amenity) and certain cities (major cities with growing downtown quaternary employ- ment) chosen? The answer is that capital cannot create landscapes at will; its deployment is heavily constrained by local geographies and the spatially biased patterns of existing and anticipated demand. A necessary corollary of an impoverished view of market demand, cultural relations, lived ex- perience, and human volition is an overly de- termined view of economic categories. As some writers favorably disposed to marxism acknowl- edge, economism has been and continues to be an abiding defect in marxian analysis. Thompson (1 978b, pp. 359-60) rejects a per- sistent economism which has reduced history to "a conceptual meccano set"; Hirst (1 977) notes how economism has been "the dominant basic form of Marxist theory"; Poster (1 975a, p. 43) comments how "Marxism had a tendency to become distorted in this specific direction, a ten- dency that has yet to be explained ade- quately"; Johnson (1978) observes that such models of mechanism "are astonishingly persis- tent, not least within Marxism"; while Clarke (1979) sees marxism as "still dominated theoretically and politically by an economism that seeks to deny the creative and imaginative powers of the working class." Before the weight of such sympathetic critics it is not enough to allude to a few of Engels's final letters to divert the charge of economism, as if these fifteen pages of private correspondence carried some superior authority to the published life work of him and Marx (Gouldner 1980, esp. Chaps. 8, 10). A more accurate representation of the im- passe is offered by Stedman Jones (1979), a marxist historian influenced by structuralist ex- planation: Economism is not some arbitrary deviation from Marxism, introduced by Kautsky, Stalin, or whoever else on whom one may wish "to pin the convict's badge." It is there from the very start, from the German Ideology onwards. From 1848, Marx and Engels were aware of the problem, like so many Marxists since. But it is a vain endeavour to imagine that they overcame the problem, that the solution is there, if only you read the text in the correct way.</page><page sequence="18">Structural Marxism and Human Geography 47 They did not resolve the problem, any more than we have. Geographers and urbanists in this tradition have been no more successful in transcending economism. For not only are there such un- equivocal assertions as "the material economic base of society determines the superstructure of social, legal and political institutions" or, "when we attempt to view society as a totality, then ultimately everything has to be related to the structures in the economic basis of society" (Piclkvance 1976b, p. 1; Harvey 1973, p. 292). 12 More pervasively, there is the attempt to cast explanation continually and everywhere in terms of economic imperatives, leading as we shall see to a crisis in empirical exposition. The dependence on economic categories in analysis has an ironic outcome. "By presuppos- ing the axiom of the economic, the Marxist critique perhaps deciphers the functioning of the system of political economy; but at the same time it reproduces it as a model" (Baud- rillard 1975, p. 66). Structuralists in geography have reproduced many of the categories and the shortcomings of spatial analysis; their rationalism, formalism, abstraction, and partic- ularly their preoccupation with economic categories are reminiscent of the workings of the bourgeois mind. 13 The Problem of Marxian Categories: Social Class The preeminence of a priori theoretical categories is a feature of structuralist method; moreover, these categories are not treated as arbitrary but as necessary, demanded by the logic of explanation and therefore, one as- sumes, implicit (if not explicit) in actual cir- cumstances. But in the theoretical distillation away from empirical events, concepts undergo stasis, an ossification that may leave them stunted with the passing of the circumstances for which they may have been relevant. As a result the fit often seems awkward or forced when they are applied in an analysis of actual societies. The interlocking is by no means as satisfactory as theory would suggest. Con- sequently, categories are either imposed un- compromisingly onto events, or else their defini- tions become imprecise, and it is through this purely linguistic device that the argument is carried. Class is a concept whose definition "is central to the whole Marxian theory of society" (Homil- ton 1974, p. 22). But it is a term that is well defined only at the level of theory in terms of functional positions relative to the mode of pro- duction. The theoretical analysis in Capital rep- resents, as Marx acknowleged, a "pure form" of capitalism. Like the physicist, he is looking at phenomena "in their most typical form and most free from disturbing influence" (Giddens 1973, p. 33). But if the theory represents an "ideal average" of capitalism, what then is the ontological status of such concepts as social class (Tristram 1975)? Hall considers that Marx's des- ignated classes are "personifications" without a consistent empirical equivalent; their status is functional rather than empirical (Hall 1977). But then to identify whole classes empirically from a functionalist derivation about the mode of pro- duction becomes "an untenable proposition" (Hall 1977). Marx's own historical studies indi- cate the problematic ontology of his category. In Louis Bonaparte's France, instead of the dichotomous or tripartite class structure required by theory, half a dozen class interests were iden- tified (Marx 1954, pp. 17, 28). Even in England, which Marx considered the "classic ground" of capitalism, classes were not ranked as theory required (Giddens 1973, p. 33). In the un- finished fragment offering a definition of class at the end of the third volume of Capital, there is the observation that in England "the stratification of classes does not appear in its pure form. Mid- dle and intermediate strata even here obliter- ate lines of demarcation everywhere (although incomparably less in rural districts than in the cities)" (Marx 1967a, Vol. 3, p. 885). What is remarkable about this fragment is that it was precisely in the British industrial cities that Engels claimed to identify so unequivocally the polarized presence of the two classes, which he read off in Manchester from the map of residen- tial segregation in a passage much cited by geographers. "In these towns," he noted, "there are only rich and poor, because the lower mid- dle classes are fast disappearing. At one time this section of the middle classes was the most stable social group, but now it has become the least stable" (Engels 1958, pp. 28-29). But it seems as if, despite the cautions of his Preface against uncritical theoretical foreclosure, Engels's own theory had outpaced his fieldwork. David Ward (1976; 1980), for example, has chal- lenged the dichotomous scheme of class segre-</page><page sequence="19">48 Duncan and Ley gation that Engels perceived in Manchester, noting that although there were concentrations of the elite and the destitute in the British indus- trial city, "far larger areas housed a mixture of lesser professionals, petty proprietors, master craftsmen, journeymen, laborers, and domestic outworkers. " More significant than the residential map, however, was the social structure, and here there is little evidence of the exclusive class divi- sions Engels was looking for. Forty-five years after his research in Manchester he lamented that rather than class divisions becoming more polarized as he had predicted, they had be- come far more confused (Ward 1975). The working class was characterized by innumerable gradations and subcultures. The lower middle class, rather than fading away, has made a powerful resurgence with the mushrooming of government and the tertiary sector. 14 The treat- ment of the middle class by Engels is equally unsatisfactory. Neither shopkeepers nor profes- sional groups appear in Engels's Manchester.15 His monolithic grouping of the middle class is unconvincing and, even to a sympathetic critic, the vilification of them is too complete and un- qualified (Marcus 1974, esp. pp. 238-39). The irrationality of this conceptualization of the mid- dle class is clarified in one illuminating footnote: "I have not had time to differentiate between the different sections of the bourgeoisie or the various middle-class political parties. This subdivi- sion of the middle class is only of historical and theoretical significance" (Engels 1958, p. 331, emphasis added). But if both history and theory are inconsequential then what remains? A political ideology? But if the whole concep- tualization is ideologically determined, then any talk of science is a charade. The fracturing of any dichotomous class system about the mode of production in the advanced societies has become more nearly complete in the twentieth century. The dissolution of owner- ship in joint-stock companies, the awesome power of life insurance and pension funds, the growth of public-sector and nonprofit occupa- tions in the economy, the increase in automa- tion and technology, the expansion of the white-collar sector, and the decreasing role of unskilled labor, are some of the historical trends that are intractable problems for a dichotomous class model. In particular, the emergence of a new middle class "has always escaped ade- quate analysis in Marxist terms" (Giddens 1973, p. 101). The new middle class has been as- signed by different authors alternatively to cap- ital and to labor, culminating in the suggestion that functionally they belong to both (Parkin 1979). Class boundaries have therefore been drawn above the middle class, below it, and through it, a highly unsatisfactory treatment of the largest single grouping in the advanced economies. Moreover, and this can only be mentioned here in passing, there are other lines of stratification, following ethnicity, sex, religion, and divisions according to consumption styles, which frequently act as the basis of perceived interests and group action (Parkin 1979; Saun- ders 1978). In light of the major limitations to the exten- sion of a simple theoretical model of class to empirical conditions, it is disappointing to note precisely this literalism in many geographical studies. Harvey (1 978b) extends to capitalist so- ciety the dichotomous class system found under the pure form of capitalism: "The class character of capitalist society means the domination of labour by capital." Elsewhere we read that "conflicts in the living place are, we can con- clude, mere reflections of the underlying tension between capital and labor" (Harvey 1978a; also Cox 1981). Harloe (1977) is on firm ground when in a review essay he identifies the dichotomous class model derived from produc- tion relationships to be "the fundamental re- lationship" in a radical political economy of space. As we will see, such literalism in the adoption of categories leads to major confusion in empirical research. There is a second solution to the problem of categories. It has often been noted that there is considerable looseness and inconsistency in Marx's own use of class, as his theoretical work impinged upon historical events. 16 Rather than a literal extrapolation from theory to the evi- dence, a looser definition permits a more diffuse identification of social groups with classes, as the criteria for class membership are varied accord- ing to the context. But this raises two further dif- ficulties. The first is terminological vagueness. Consider the definition of social classes as "com- binations of the contradictory places defined in the ensemble of the instances of the social structure" (Castells 1977, p. 243). This is a phrase so imprecise that it will obligingly bend in any direction the theorist may choose. A second issue is also at stake. To follow the evidence more closely and develop a more plural and</page><page sequence="20">Structural Marxism and Human Geography 49 elastic concept of class may not require refer- ence to the theoretical structure at all. This ten- dency is marked in Massey and Catalano's (1978) study of land ownership in Britain, where a theoretical discussion of rent and class "frac- tions" from a structural perspective appears un- necessary to the ensuing empirical material on land ownership and conflict between plural elite groups. The same observation holds in Castells's more recent work, where he repudiates his ear- lier "codification of history according to Marxist schemata" (i.e., conceptual stasis). Instead, he favors "studies where the recognition of a new historical perspective is more important than a formalist theoretical orientation" (Castells 1978, p. 12). In these terms, class structure is now de- fined by income and status categories, and the ability to gain access to key private and public gatekeepers (Castells 1978, pp. 21-24). But this is to replicate Weber's stratification trilogy of class, status, and power, rather than to require reference to deep structures or a set of produc- tion relations. The suspension of a literalism in following the theoretical category of class is re- placed by a heterodoxy in which structural theory is either largely redundant or else a con- trived addition to empirical exposition. These weaknesses in analysis using the marxist category of class are an instance of a more gen- eral problem, the unresolved tension between structural theory and empirical investigation. The Tension between Theory and Empirical Study The friction between abstract theorizing and empirical study has recently come to the fore in a series of interchanges in British social history.17 In part this has been a quarrel over spheres of influence on the margins of history and sociol- ogy; but, more significantly, debate has re- volved around the relative status of theoretical and empirical research in historical explanation. Sociologists have asserted methodological sophistication, rigor, and theoretical refinement; historians have claimed clearer contextual un- derstanding, more respect for the facts, and less assurance of the appropriateness of elaborate theory. Charges of abstraction are met by countercharges of empiricism; the tension is that "of the universal versus the concrete" (Spencer 1977). In geography the limitations of idiosyn- cratic local studies have been effectively pub- licized over the past twenty years; now it is nec- essary to emphasize also the shortcomings of highly theoretical inclinations, where the theoretician "tends to impose his theoretical categories on historical reality, that is, he loses his openness to the historical phenomenon-in-itself, and he uses the historical reality to illustrate his theory, thus reversing the desirable relationship of these terms" (Spencer 1977). These errors, which we shall document below, give rise to two further problems. Firstly, the shortcomings be- come critical whenever theory makes the claim of practical or political efficacy. Secondly, they present an idealism, where the ideas, the a priori categories, of the researcher are granted a privileged status over empirical circumstances (Ley 1978). In structural marxism the idea of capital has succeeded Hegel's world spirit; "cap- ital has become Idea, which unfolds itself in his- tory" (Thompson 1978b, p. 253). The tension between theoretical formulations and geographical circumstances is a common feature in the structuralist analysis of advanced societies. So too is conceptual stasis, the imposi- tion of predetermined categories upon empiri- cal circumstances, and also the instrumental use of facts as illustrative devices rather than as a means for formally testing or confirming theory. Harvey, in particular, is aware of the difficulties in forging the link between theory and history. In his discussion of Marx's theory of capitalist ac- cumulation, he notes that it applies "in a 'pure' state without reference to any particular histori- cal situation." To extend the theory empirically is then not easy: "We have to force an intersection between the theoretical abstractions, on the one hand, and the materialist investigations of actual historical configurations on the other." Moreover in this task Marx himself provides little precedent, for "we have to accomplish also that transformation from the general to the concrete which comprised the central thrust of Marx's un- finished work" (Harvey 1975b). Notable in these extracts are the methodological sequence from the general to the particular, the substan- tial problems involved in forging this union, and the implication that to date these connections have not been made successfully. We shall now examine in more detail the full measure of these difficulties, noting how the literal attempt to transpose theoretical categories onto geo- graphic circumstances is awkward and rarely convincing, while too close an attention to the facts invites the charge of heterodoxy in its de-</page><page sequence="21">50 Duncan and Ley parture from the theoretical mold. This is one aspect of the contemporary "crisis of Marxism," a crisis that is largely concealed in the optimistic pronouncements of marxist geographers (Gouldner 1980, esp. pp. 26-29). Empirical Confusion: Literalism The shortcomings in the substantive studies by structuralists may be considered in more detail in the work of Harvey and Castells, perhaps the two most influential marxian commentators on the city in advanced societies. Harvey's more re- cent research and Castells's earlier work (now largely repudiated by Castells himself) usefully indicate the difficulties of a literalist position (Ley 1979). Harvey's discussion of residential segregation begins with his familiar acknowledgment to Marx's system and a symptomatic declaration of the fundamental nature of a dichotomous class division. Within this system, residential differ- entiation has "an integral mediating influence in the process whereby class relationships and so- cial differentiations are produced and sustained" (Harvey 1975a). The argument is highly functionalist, as it proceeds by positing that segregated working-class neighborhoods serve to perpetuate occupational skills for the needs of future generations of employers, and that, as these spatially constrained households establish community, so they forge common tastes and preferences for the convenience of producers, while also limiting aspirations for upward mobil- ity by shaping a class norm. Thus capital appears as a single clairvoyant (the omniscient world spirit?), which simultaneously provides itself with a present and future labor force, a pliant group of consumers, and a subordinate and passive underclass, all aided by its manipulation of spa- tial pattern. Capital, it seems, cannot err, for if residential dispersion rather than segregation is encouraged, by opening up the suburbs to dis- advantaged groups, then this too is functional to its interests for it will serve to dissipate latent class consciousness (Harvey 1978b). Moreover, the suburbs themselves represent no more than "a Faustian bargain" to labor, an assessment at variance with objective and subjective indicators that reveal a high level of residential satisfaction among suburban dwellers (e.g., Gans 1967; Zehner 1977). But the logic of system requires that their satisfaction be illusory, and it is dis- missed with the assertion that the suburbs can- not meet "the real human requirements of la- bor" (Harvey 1978a).18 What are these human needs? How may they be recognized? By which processes may they be satisfied? And who is "labor" anyway? The explanation of land-use conflict is no more convincing (Harvey 1978a). Again the exposition begins, "for purposes of analytic con- venience," by assuming the clear division of labor and capital, rather than demonstrating it empirically. This theoretical primacy asserts what should be demonstrated: "If we derive our con- cept from a prior theoretical model of a struc- tural totality . . . we will suppose that class is instantaneously present (derivative, like a geo- metric projection, from productive relations) and that hence classes struggle" (Thompson 1 978a). The status of historical reality then becomes merely illustrative, as Spencer (1977) suggested is normal in such cases of theoretical overelab- oration. In the text, real events are introduced only as illustrative allusions to bolster the theoretical framework. However, although the stated objective is to illuminate conflicts under contemporary advanced capitalism, the theoretical argument rarely intersects with pres- ent geographical conditions. Instead, specific il- lustrations (which are few in number) are biased toward early rather than advanced capitalism, drawn from "early industrialists": the introduction of Henry Ford's eight-hour day in 1914, the Pullman strike of 1894, the plight of the Lowell mill girls in the 1.820's. In addition, members of the worlkforce are repeatedly represented as factory employees, though all blue collar work- ers now account for only 30 to 35 percent of the labor force in North America. Indeed, by using the strict definition of class set out by one influen- tial structural marxist (Poulantzas), fewer than 20 percent of the present-day American labor force would qualify as members of the working class, while over 70 percent would consist of the new petty bourgeoisie (Wright 1976). The theoretical prerequisites of structuralism have drawn Har- vey's argument away from advanced capitalism and toward a time and a place where it may apparently be sustained more easily. In contrast, less theoretically determined analyses of con- temporary land-use conflict emphasize the criss-crossing alliances representing the complex form of modern social stratification (Elliott and McCrone 1979). Agitation may cut across con- ventional class lines as in the case of urban re-</page><page sequence="22">Structural Marxism and Human Geography 51 newal, where blue-collar unions often support the proposals of financiers and the development industry, to be opposed by minorities and liberal members of the middle class, with the different levels of government fluctuating from one side to another according to local and national cir- cumstances. These novel alignments point to a separate articulation of interests than that predi- cated on theories of production; the new al- legiances commonly spring from distinctive atti- tudes toward consumption (Ley and Mercer 1980). In a third paper that attempts to link capital accumulation with urban growth cycles, the same tendency is found toward conceptual stasis and an overly determining theoretical structure (Harvey 1 978b). There is not space to treat the substance of the argument here, but we may note the awkward meshing of theory and history that runs through it and the persistent tendencies to instrumentalism. The paper begins by outlin- ing Marx's laws of accumulation-set out in Capi- tal, a theoretical thesis of a "pure form" of capitalism. The "acid test" of such a theoretical formulation, it is acknowledged, is the successful explanation of real events, but such verification is suspended in favor of the use of illustrative sketches that are "not incompatible with the broad outlines of the theory we have sketched in." A genuine testing of the theory is deferred as "an extraordinarily difficult task for beyond the scope of a short paper." In conclusion the author comments on the profound limitations in his empirical analysis: I have been forced to blur distinctions, make enor- mous assumptions, cut corners, jump from the theoretical to the historical in seemingly arbitrary fashion, and commit all manner of sins which will doubtless arouse ire and reproach as well as a good deal of opportunity for misunderstanding. But as we have argued repeatedly, the source of these severe weaknesses lies not in the size of the manuscript but in its literalism in extrapolat- ing a pure structural theory to empirical cir- cumstances. The privileged status of preexisting theoretical categories imposes a high degree of closure upon the argument, and places an im- possible constraint on the historical situation. Manuel Castells (1977) was not able to re- solve this conflict in his text of nearly 500 pages in The Urban Question. For Castells the status of empirical study is even more problematic. His major theoretical source is Althusser's reading of Marx, a structuralism that is characterized by an extreme scepticism toward empirical work. It is "a philosophy of the concept," where "theory is about a theoretical object, and this latter is al- ready at several removes from empirical reality" (Poster 1975a, p. 345; Glucksmann 1974, p. 115). Castells shares Althusser's disdain for em- piricism, preferring the development of "theoretical tools." In a separate paper he has outlined his position more clearly. "Empiricism is not only an epistemological weapon, but also an ideological weapon . . ."; theory must therefore have primary status, as "a means of production of scientific facts" (Castells and Ipola 1976). What then is to become of the status of the historical situation in The Urban Question? The response is disquieting: "I prefer to take the risk of a certain empirical margin of error in order to clarify the ideas in the perspective I have outlined" (Castells 1977, p. 200, em- phasis added). So to what does the argument become accountable? If not to historical cir- cumstances, then, it seems, to the internal logic of "the ideas in the perspective." It is the theoretical idea, the logic, that must be de- fended against historical facts, so that despite the aspirations to theoretical purity in the struc- tural system, the ontological primacy granted to theory and the concept inevitably draws the ar- gument toward idealism. The result in The Urban Question is an un- happy disjuncture between theoretical abstrac- tion and geographical circumstances. For example, there is the claim that the emergence of the metropolitan region "is the problematic of the organization of space in the advanced capitalist societies" (Castells 1977, p. 29). But two pages earlier, a demographic table has shown no important difference in metropolitan growth between capitalist and noncopitalist na- tions. Indeed of the twenty-five world cities in- cluded in the table, the metropolitan area with the highest percentage growth over the most recent decade listed is Peking! Conclusions are sometimes no more than assertions at odds with the evidence. In the case of urban renewal in Paris there is the assertion that renewal areas are primarily those where housing has deteriorated and immigrant and unskilled workers are pres- ent while higher income groups are absent (Castells 1977, p. 308). But the table on the some page from which these conclusions are reached roundly contradicts them. For while housing quality is associated with renewal, social composition takes an inverse form to that</page><page sequence="23">52 Duncan and Ley specified, with a negative association against foreigners and unskilled workers and a positive association against upper management and professional workers and Algerians! If this is not bad enough, a correlation is then performed on the size of renewal projects against a list of so- cioeconomic variables. On the basis of these correlations hypotheses are stated and generali- zations made; but unmentioned is the fact that none of the eleven correlations is statistically sig- nificant. Such empirical nonchalance contrasts strongly with the seeming intricacy of the theoretical structure. The structuralists have committed the very er- rors that Harvey in his preradical writing correctly perceived as inherent liabilities in functionalist holism: "The danger that we must here avoid at all costs is that mortal inferential sin of erecting an a priori functional model into full theory with- out knowing it and without the necessary con- firmatory evidence" (Harvey 1969, p. 446). Empirical Confusion: Heterodoxy The second empirical conundrum, the issue of heterodoxy, concerns marxian study that shows more sensitivity to the empirical situation. The problem here is that the course of explanation may require little or no reference to the logic of the theoretical structure. The research then squares equally well with alternative theoretical traditions (often of a broadly Weberian form), a circumstance that brings charges of heterodoxy from structural purists. An appropriate starting point is Harvey's semi- nal study of the Baltimore housing market, which was one of the first empirical studies in geography to claim a radical perspective (Har- vey 1-975c). It showed effectively how spatially discriminatory practices by various institutions in the financial and property sectors and in gov- ernment had real effects on the residential areas of the city. This precedent encouraged a range of associated studies examining the role of key institutions as gatekeepers in urban devel- opment. 19 But these studies opened the door to theoretical heresy. The discovery of institutional subcultures that exercise real effects make links with Weber's theses on bureaucracy. The recog- nition of key institutions involved in the allocation of housing and other services also suggested fruitful connections with an emphasis on con- sumption and the liberal theory of elites. These linkages were made explicit by Pahl's (1976) research on urban managers, which identified the some relationships, and which grew out of a Weberian perspective. The notion of state offi- cials as managers again favored Weber in sug- gesting a growing distinction between political allocation and economic forces. Worse still from a structuralist perspective, empirical analysis of public and private gatekeepers showed they could be and often were sensitized to client or demand pressures. Rather than consistently act- ing in the monopoly manner of a ruling class, their actions could also be reactive to shifts in popular opinion and unanticipated market trends. "Tastes and preferences" were theoreti- cally efficacious after all. Consequently, to structuralists the institutional studies were theoretically tainted. Roweis and Scott (1978) refer Harvey's Baltimore research to a manipulated city perspective, i.e., a Webe- rian position that emphasizes the role of elites, interests, and power, with recourse to constraint rather than to structural imperatives. Harloe, in his favorable review of structural marxism, simi- larly cautions Harvey and Castells for their em- phasis on consumption, which distances them from the theoretically central realm of produc- tion and of productive rather than finance capi- tal. This tendency "bears comparison, in some respects, with previous urban sociology and with the Weberian urban sociology" (Harloe 1977, p. 21 ). Attempts have been made to restore or- thodoxy to the theoretical deviations of the in- stitutional research. Observing of Harvey's hous- ing research that "its theoretical insights remain obscure" (i.e., impure), Smith (1979a) has in- verted the roles of production and consumption in his own work on gentrification in a valiant at- tempt to reestablish the primacy of production relationships. Other critics have challenged the concept of managerialism more directly, claiming that the independent-action of man- agers has been exaggerated.20 But what does this imply? Surely there is no suggestion that the managers exercise no control, for the fact of control has been amply demonstrated in the lit- erature. In an increasingly complex and man- aged society, the role of public and private gatekeepers in the allocation of scarce resources cannot be ignored (Pahl 1979). But if the crit- icism suggests, as it must, only that there are constraints upon the actions of managers, this does not discredit a Weberian approach, which does not advocate unconstrained voluntarism. Weber's explanatory schema incorporated</page><page sequence="24">Structural Marxism and Human Geography 53 criteria of "causal adequacy" as well as "mean- ing adequacy": "Structure sets the conditions and limits, but within that wide field ideas gain an affinity with the interests of a social group, and may thus serve to alter the structural condi- tions, so as to lead to a new framework of action and meaning" (Hamilton 1974, p. 89). Thus the demonstration of constraints upon managers (or mediating institutions) need not carry the discussion to a structuralist framework. A British study of housing markets in inner Birming- ham reaches the Weberian conclusion that "housing opportunities, whether for mobility or improvement, were bureaucratically defined" (Lambert, Paris, and Blackaby 1978, p. 148). The authors then go on to show that the options open to local managers were themselves lim- ited by higher-order political and economic con- straints. At this point there is an ideological rup- ture in the argument, as the authors adopt from Castells a theoretical ruling-class model of the state (a model that Castells (1978, p. 181 ) has since rejected as an expression of "mechanistic Leninism"). But only with this implausible break from the empirical analysis have the imperatives of orthodoxy in structural marxism been achieved. At first sight it may seem incongruous that the work of a single author (such as Harvey) might be subject to the criticisms both of literalism and of heterodoxy. But the distinction that is drawn parallels the distinction between his theoretical and empirical writing, for if the former may be described as theoretically overloaded, the latter makes few essential links with the theoret- ical structure. This is most clear in the un- characteristic essay on "Myth and Monument," a description of the Paris Commune and an interpretation of the subsequent construction of the Basilica of Sacr&amp;-Coeur as an ideological statement of hegemony by conservative groups (Harvey 1979). The essay is historiographic, a narrative that the author repeatedly refers to as "our story." What is notable about the account is its emphasis on context: the fortunes of the mili- tary campaign with Prussia, the power of the state, the diversity of social classes and interest groups who flit across the historical scene, and the range of motivations they express (piety, fear, patriotism, etc.). The accuracy of the in- terpretation as ideology critique must be judged by historians. A separate issue is at stake here. Beneath the general context there is the imma- nence of particular events and personalities im- plicating a contingent and dynamic unfolding of history where few outcomes are certain. Both in its context and in its contingency, what is so con- spicuously missing is the logic of a theoretical system and the imperatives of a mode of pro- duction. These theoretical bases do not appear as necessary (nor are they systematically intro- duced) in the empirical exposition. The some observation has been made of Marx's own historiographic account of The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, whose style resembles Harvey's essay. Gouldner (1980, pp. 299, 304) refers to this work as an anomaly, indeed "the classical site of the anomaly problem in Marxism . . . [where] ... Reality has dealt theory a dizzying blow." In short, a separation (not a synthesis) between theoretical literalism and empirical heterodoxy is a feature of Marx's own work. It remains only to be noted that social historians who draw their cues from historiographic work like The Eighteenth Brumaire are constantly challenged by theorists as to the authenticity of their marxist credentials. Stedman Jones (1979) chides the work of many British social historians who claim a marxian identity: "To call this Marxism demands a real effort of imagination." Thompson himself, the sharp critic of the structuralists, has frequently been imputed with such heterodoxy (Johnson 1978; Hirst 1979; Nield 1980). This criticism has recently been repeated from within geography (Gregory 1981). Gregory finds Thompson's schema unduly removed from structural effects, while at the some time he is properly cautious of the weaknesses of structural theoreticism. This leaves his argument on un- certain ground, and he turns in a general way to the precedent of Vidal de la Blache and Gid- dens's conceptual framework of structuration (Giddens 1979). The French School shared a neo-Kantian tradition with Weber, while the structuration thesis as presented by Gregory in- corporates a language of actors, interaction, routines, interpretive schemes, norms, symbol systems, domination, and legitimation-which is to rehearse a thoroughly Weberian vocabulary. There is, in short, often a strongly Weberian component to apparently marxist analyses that treat empirical studies more seriously than as ammunition for illustrating theory. Parkin's (1979, p. 75) provocative comment that "in- side every neo-Marxist there seems to be a Weberian struggling to get out" is worthy of the most careful examination.</page><page sequence="25">54 Duncan and Ley For present purposes it is unnecessary to press the convergence with broadly Weberian streams of analysis; what is of central importance is how dispensable structural theory around the mode of production has become, and how with this a distinctively marxist identity to empirical study has been severely challenged. Validation and the Ideological Imperative Like the positivist tradition that preceded it in geography, structural marxism is eloquent in its self-proclamation as objective science, "a truly scientific social science" (Peet 1 977a). But this is a suspiciously repetitive claim, which Kolakowski (1978, Vol. 3, p. 486) observes is not a habit of real scientists. We have com- mented frequently on the discordance between theoretical orthodoxy and empirical cir- cumstances and the necessity for the gap to be bridged by unsupported assertion and conjec- ture, and such linguistic practices as nominalism and obfuscation in the discussion of process. Why is it necessary that our credulity be so strained to defend the orthodoxy of structuralism? The answer is that structural marxism does not always engage in conventional validation pro- cedures. When Engels presented his portrait of the English working class, his posture was not that of the objective, detached investigator; in a letter to Marx he described himself instead as the prosecutor of the English middle class (Engels 1958, p. xxi). Pronouncements of objectivity obscure the fact that theories may be subject to political not scientific validation, positing a spe- cific class interest for judgment. "It is irrelevant," writes Harvey (1973, p. 298), "to ask whether concepts, categories and relationships are 'true' or'false.' "Theirjustification, rather, rests with the fact that they are "revolutionary theories which are productive of change." Ultimately, the facts may become irrelevant, a methodological idiosyncrasy expressed by Lukdcs, who (quoting Fichte) rejected the role of empirical refutation with the phrase "so much the worse for the facts" (Kolakowski 1978, Vol. 3, p. 265). Knowledge and social interests are then self-consciously con- flated, as an arbitrary vantage point claims the status of universal scientific knowledge. But it is precisely such "pure theory, wanting to derive everything from itself, that succumbs to unac- knowledged external conditions and becomes ideological" (Habermas 1971, p. 314).21 Conclusion In this essay we have suggested that the inter- section of human geography with structural marxism has led to a passive model of man that is conservative and results in an obfuscation of the processes by which human beings can and do change the world. Furthermore, philosophi- cal holism is extremely difficult to apply in em- pirical research, the result being that in some cases the explanations are totally inadequate, with causal power attributed to abstract mental constructions, while in other cases theoretical structures are almost completely divorced from the empirical analysis. In the former instance, the ontological fallacy leads, as we have shown, to the neglect of many types of variables, espe- cially social psychological factors. The Mode of Production or the Logic of Capitalism are mystifi- cations replacing a detailed examination of the relation between the actions of human beings and the economic and political structures within which they act. In the latter case, the theoretical structure is scarcely brought to bear on the em- pirical work. Also, in this latter case, the identifi- cation of historical tendencies rather than the specification of theoretical laws weakens sub- stantially the domain of theoretical surety, and dismisses any claims for universalism. Which factors are more important in a given situation, and which less so, and how (with a structuralism sceptical of surface appearances) are we to know the difference? What are we to make of an historical situation in nineteenth-century Bri- tain, the "most typical form" of capitalist society, when as critical a theoretical proposition as the dichotomous class structure cannot be located? No wonder a strongly empirical radical analysis invites charges of theoretical heresy where there is "little left to distinguish Marxism from a vacuous pluralism devoid of any predictive power" (Sayer 1975). The status of borrowed theory is not as firm as geographers have implied. There are many "marxisms," and the issues that separate them are both complex and controversial. As we have tried to show by the range of our citations, in- cluding E. P. Thompson, a marxist historian who has a fuller grasp of the complexity of the theoretical arguments and the negative verdict of history on much marxist praxis, the debate is both internal as well as external to the marxist traditions. The state of marxist theory refutes the universalism and confidence that has been dis-</page><page sequence="26">Structural Marxism and Human Geography 55 played in the geographic literature, and dis- counts the claim for an established, unitary methodology or corpus of theory. As we saw, the holistic theoretical perspective, which the marxist geographers have drawn from the Hegelian tradition, not only hinders empirical analysis, but is also open to criticism as a purely theoretical formulation. Not only is an ontological fallacy committed by reification and the attribution of causal primacy to abstractions, but also these reifications, being derived from nineteenth-century Hegelian idealism, have a clear teleological character. Furthermore, as we have shown, the form of the explanations is both tautological and empirically untestable. The result is a mystification in explanation of how real processes operate. There is a final point to be made, though at this stage it is an argument that should be ad- vanced tentatively, for its intricacies need further exploration. At several points we have noted theoretical parallels between structural marxism and other holistic schools such as Durkheim's sociology and Kroeber's anthropology. In each instance, the posing of a theoretical structure was accompanied by a passive view of human beings and the reification of structure. It is perti- nent to heed the warning that "a purely struc- tural sociology is endemically in danger of reify- ing social phenomena. Even if it begins by modestly assigning to its constructs merely heuristic status, it all too frequently ends by con- fusing its own conceptualizations with the laws of the universe" (Berger and Luckman 1967, p. 186). This much we have already demonstrated. But for Durkheim and Kroeber, the specifica- tion of an essential or superorganic structure had a practical as well as a theoretical purpose. Both followed Comte in ascribing to each discipline a distinctive set of phenomena to be studied. Both were concerned to protect the identity of their own discipline and its associated set of problems and explanations from reduction to another sci- ence, notably psychology. This practical objec- tive consistently invited the risk of theoretical clo- sure, of overly determined argument, and of a certain mystification in explanation as causal power was assigned to a superorganic structure while independent human action was di- minished as it fell outside the terms of reference of the social science in question. In other words, mystification in the discussion of process was a result of a partial disciplinary perspective; but this partial perspective was required to defend the integrity of the discipline. This is a matter not un- familiar to geographers, for the nineteenth- century paradigm identifying a distinctive set of relations between people and the physical en- vironment could also claim a distinctive disci- plinary niche, but at the continual danger of overspecifying the potency of the physical envi- ronment while minimizing the role of human action and a discussion of process. There was, in short, a purely practical and internal necessity for incomplete explanation in order to sustain the identity of the discipline; there was, as A. F. Mar- tin (1951 ) lucidly put it for human geography, a practical necessity for determinism. The some tendencies are present in structural marxism. We noted earlier how economism has been "the dominant basic form of Marxist theory," how a persistent marxian bias toward economism is "a tendency that has yet to be explained adequately" (Hirst 1977; Poster 1975a; Johnson 1978; Clarlke 1979; Thompson 1978b). The integrity of structural marxism is similarly predicated on theoretical overspecifi- cation, on a potent abstract structure which, it is held, propels the course of history. The holistic argument is characterized by determinacy and closure. But this thesis may be sustained only by a certain mystification in the discussion of process and by either an underdevelopment of or a demeaning neglect for empirical study. Too much attention to historical or geographical cir- cumstances transcends the terms of reference of the theoretical structure and may lead to unac- ceptable conclusions that challenge its integrity. The practical intent behind these tendencies in structural marxism needs to be exposed, for the primary (if unrecognized) objective is less the explanation of the real world than the preserva- tion of an abstract model of mechanism that is essentially intellectual. Paradoxically, the fun- damental objective then becomes idealistic, the defense of the mental categories of the author. These categories, which are projected onto the real world and given a life of their own, must be demystified and referred back to the practical intent of the consciousness that created them. In short, for structural marxists, ideology critique should be directed inward as well as outward. In a letter sent to Marx in 1844, while he was worlking on The Condition of the Working Class in England, Engels wrote: "We must start out from empiricism and materialism, if our thoughts and in particular our 'man' are to be something real. We must deduce the general</page><page sequence="27">56 Duncan and Ley from the particular and not from itself or out of thin air d la Hegel" (cited in Stedman Jones 1977). Engels soon revised this assessment, and the history of structural marxism has also been one of continuous resistance to such a proposi- tion. Instead, the marxian authors have de- clared (not demonstrated) their own authority; by the stroke of a pen the subject has pro- claimed itself aufgehoben. Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to John Agnew, Nancy Dun- can, David Evans, John Lowman, Geraldine Pratt, and Gretchen Zdorkowski for their comments on an earlier draft of this paper. Notes 1. This organicism often emerges in social science in the form of systems theory. 2. Some of the better known commentaries on Marx's links to Hegel include Bernstein (1971), Avineri (1971), Ollman (1971), Hook (1962). 3. The quotations from Marx are drawn from Marx (1973), pp. 459 and 276. 4. It should be noted that Althusser much more con- sistently devalues human activity than does Marx. 5. Smith (1980) argues against Althusser's separa- tion of natural and social science, and the separa- tion of the "real object" from the "object of knowledge." He does not, however, focus on Alt- husser's use of reified wholes as we do here. 6. Idealism, in its philosophical sense, is the view that mind and ideas are simply not reducible to mate- rial things and processes. It is also opposed to the commonsense view that material things exist in- dependently of their being perceived. Transcen- dental idealism such as Hegel's is the view that there is a transcendent totality of which material entities including man are manifestations. These, in very brief and simplified form, are the standard definitions used in philosophy. However, social scientists, the marxist geographers included, sometimes use the term idealism to refer to a view that overemphasizes the ideas and inten- tions of individuals, and that sometimes leads to what is termed "conspiracy theory" in political analysis. In this paper we use the term in its philosophical sense. Marxist geographers are guilty of philosophical idealism generally and transcen- dental idealism especially, because they give on- tological status and causal primacy to transcen- dental, supra-individual entities, while accusing anyone who sees individual reasons as possible causes of events of idealism. 7. Although Castells is an urban sociologist, he is in- cluded here because his work has an important spatial component and because he has influ- enced a number of geographers. 8. Marxist geographers have clearly been influ- enced by Marx in their organicism. In Grundrisse as in Capital and elsewhere, Marx speaks of soci- ety as an organic system that subordinates all elements of society to itself and creates out of itself the organs that it laclks. See Marx (1973), p. 278. Also relevant is Marx's great respect for Dar- win's evolutionary theory. Kropotlkin, although not a marxist himself, has influenced marxist geog- raphers and also had an organicist view of society. See Galois (1979). 9. Among the prominent organismic biologists or vitalists, as they were called, were S. Haldane and Hans Driesch. More recently, Paul Weiss and L. Von Bertalanffy have argued for a holistic in- terpretation of biology. However, since the late nineteenth century this interpretation has never held an appeal for mainline biologists. See Phillips (1976) for a critique of organismic biology. Also see Beclkner (1967). 10. For an exposition and defense of Marxist structural-functionalism, see Cohen (1978). 11. See also Gregory (1979) and Kennedy (1979). It is significant also to note Harvey's earlier sympathy for functionalism and systems analysis as positivist models of explanation. Here as elsewhere there is continuity rather than innovation in his radical formulations (Harvey 1969, Chaps. 22-23). 12. Again there is continuity with positivist forms of geography in the 1960's, with their passive model of man and their underpinning in neoclas- sical economics. Compare Burton's (1963) obser- vation that a "mechanistic flavour is present in much of the recent worlk by the 'quantifiers'.... The quantitative revolution is talking us baclk much closer to environmental determinism." 13. For this view from other perspectives, see Gould- ner (1979) and Parlkin (1980). 14. See, for example, Bechhofer and Elliott (1976). 15. Although there were ten shopkeepers on Man- chester's first town council in 1838 (Briggs 1965, p. 105). 16. "Marx's terminology is careless" (Giddens 1973, pp. 27, 28). Ollman is more severe: "With all due allowance made for loose word usage, however, Marx cannot escape the more serious accusation of having a litter of standards for class member- ship and of changing them without prior warning" (Ollman 1968). 17. See, for example, Moorehouse (1978); Stedman Jones (1976); the debate running through His- tory Workshop in 1978-79; and, in particular, Thompson's (1 978b) defense of historical method and assault on structural theoreticism. 18. For a historical analysis offering different conclu- sions, see Holdsworth (1980). 19. For a bibliography of the earlier studies, see Johnston (1977). 20. For a review of this debate, see Williams (1978); a broader view of the politics of consumption ap- pears in Cawson (1977). 21. Of course, historical and political praxes do not validate the theoretical prospectus either, so that structural marxism is deeply flowed even on its own grounds for validation. Indeed, "the greatest ideal obstacle has been the caricature of socialism</page><page sequence="28">Structural Marxism and Human Geography 57 presented by the fact of socialist states" (Thompson 1978b, p. 169).
