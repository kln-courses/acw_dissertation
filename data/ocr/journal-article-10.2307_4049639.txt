<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cyril Ehrlich. Harmonious Alliance: A History of the Performing Right Society. New York: Oxford University Press. 1989. Pp. xii, 183. $30.00. Those of us who in universities these days spend most of our time sending memos and papers to the Powers That Be get frustrated enough at having to write them in the first place and even more downhearted when they are ignored. I have just cleared out a year's accumulation of such files and was tempted to throw the whole lot away as wasted effort. Then I thought of Ehrlich and realized that he manages to make a compelling story even out of the things that never happened. His historian's touch should give us all heart. He wears that touch lightly - maybe I was wrong to review his previous book, The Music Profession in Britain Since the Eighteenth Century: A Social History, as "a bit dry," or perhaps he has livened up in the interim - and (un?)wittingly pays a tribute to himself when</page><page sequence="2">Reviews ofBooks 353 he quotes a comment from the New Statesman to the effect that "the documentation [for one of the PRS battles] would make even the most copious historian blanch" (p. 144). He never appears to blanch, and in his account has gone some considerable way towards repairing the damage done to British cultural history by Asa Briggs when he took a potentially fascinating subject, broadcasting in the United Kingdom, and wrote an official four-volume history of it that was unreadable. He also makes us realize how rare an animal the true historian of music is, possessing a formidable range of intellectual equipment not least of which is the ability, and willingness, to see music in the round, popular and serious under one roof. In the twentieth century that roof is economic rather than aesthetic, and this is what makes the subject of performing rights a perfect one for Ehrlich's economic and social historian's appetite. Money makes the whole thing hang together- and we conclude that that can be no bad thing when we look at the photo of Lennon and McCartney opposite one of Arthur Bliss and A. P. Herbert, or at Andrew Lloyd Webber next to John Gardner, and Vivian Ellis, glass in hand, next to William Walton (why isn't he drinking?). They all have something to celebrate: a fair financial cut of the overall use of their music, be it over the air, in pubs, in cinemas or concert halls, or on juke boxes. The book is the story of the long struggle to develop that royalty arrangement in Britain, from the society's founding in 1914 (late in the day compared with most other European countries) to its 75th anniversary. The process is one of astounding growth, from a total gross income of ?4,000 in 1915 to one of ?85,283,000 in 1986; however, it is not this but the pattern of change, of the decay and complete extinction of some types of music and its dissemination (hence of some ways of earning a living) and the unexpected mushrooming of others, that occasions the lucid and trenchant mapping of frontiers at which Ehrlich excels. Take the early 1960s: "Cheaply imported transistor sets transformed the use of radio. Family listening was no longer determined by the single, immobile, wireless, and young people were liberated from the tastes of their elders. As television took over the living room, radios and record players retreated to the adolescent bedroom. Sounds became increasingly a pre- occupation of youth" (p. 127). In other words, the Japanese made pop possible. Obvious, but it needed saying, just as it now needs saying that travel has become increasingly a preoccupation of the elderly (and what changes to our culture will that bring about?). This is by definition an Anglocentric study, though Ehrlich, as indeed the PRS has always had to, gives ample reference to practices and markets elsewhere. For those whose primary interest is British music it offers limitless insights and statistics, from the one-man oppositio- nal tendencies of Vaughan Williams to the posthumous income of Hoist (sufficient to raise eyebrows -anyone learning to write commercial music for television or whatever should clearly study The Planets as a set text). Both Leslie and William Boosey emerge as unsung giants in the history of music. Ketelby's In a Persian Market emerges as "probably more frequently played, at home and abroad, than any other work in the history of English music, with the possible exception of the national anthem" (p. 87). The BBC emerges, as ever, as the great anthropomorphic imponderable. Ehrlich divides the narrative up into admirably partitioned episodes, covering for example the (temporary) secession of popular publishers in 1919, the licensing of cinema music, the infamous "Tuppenny Bill" of 1929, the Ullswater Report and subsequent rounds of nego- tiations with the BBC whenever developments in the media shifted the economic goalposts, war work, attempts to stem the tide of American popular music after the war, the British pop revolution after 1963, and so on. Practically the only criticism is that he never quite tabulates, in simple, idiot-proof form, how the whole operation works in terms of who pays what to</page><page sequence="3">354 Albion whom for what. But one pieces it all together through reading the narrative, and that is a pleasure. University of Keele STEPHEN BANFmELD</page></plain_text>
