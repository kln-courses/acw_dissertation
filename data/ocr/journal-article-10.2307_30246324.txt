SOUTHON Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Livermore, CA 94551-9900 ABSTRACT This article presents radiocarbon dates for painted motifs at Red Cliffs, west of Sedona in the northeastern comer of Yavapai County, Arizona. All rock painting shields at the Red Cliffs sites have usually been attributed to the Sinagua. Black pigment from one shield motif and an overlying white dot on another motifyielded uncalibrated radiocarbon dates of 1080 and 550 years B.P., respectively. The black pigment sample dates to a time when the region was extensively used. Assuming that the two shields were painted contemporaneously, the age of the white dot sample suggests that a later cultural group altered Sinagua paintings at Red Cliffs after the Sinagua abandoned the region. RESUMEN Este articulo presenta fechas del radiocarbono en adornos pintados en Red Cliffs, situadado al oeste del Sedona en la esquina del noreste del condado de Yavapai, Arizona. Todas los escudos pintados de la roca en sitios Red Cliffs se han asignados generalmente al groupo cultural de Sinagua. Pigmento negro de un adorno de escudo, y un punto blanco sobre puesto en otro adorno, rendido las fechas sin calibrar del radiocarbono de 1080 y 550 aios antepresente, respectivamente. La edad de la muestra de pigmenta negra se conforma con una dpoca en que habia uso extenso de la regidn. La edad de la muestra delpunto blanco sugiere que un groupo cultural altero a las pinturas de preexistencia en red cliffs despues del sinagua abandaron la regidn, si se asume que los escudosfuero pintados contemporaneamente. Until about a decade ago, rock art images were left out of mainstream ar- chaeological investigations because only indirect methods could be used to date them, but with the development of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) for ra- diocarbon analysis, dating rock art became feasible because AMS requires smaller</page><page sequence="2">254 ARMITAGE AND OTHERS samples than conventional radiocarbon dating (Finkel and Suter 1993). Van der Merwe et al. (1987) were the first scholars to use AMS to date charcoal pigments from a rock painting, and they were followed by others who dated charcoal pig- ments from Angola (Ilger et al. 1995); Australia (Armitage et al. 1998; McDonald et al. 1990); France (Clottes 1994; Clottes et al. 1992a, 1992b, 1997; Ilger et al. 1994; Valladas et al. 1990, 1992); and the United States (Armitage et al. 1997; Chaffee et al. 1994a, 1994b; Farrell and Burton 1992; Geib and Fairley 1992; Hyman and Rowe 1997). In this paper, we use our plasma-chemical extraction technique for AMS ra- diocarbon dating (Hyman and Rowe 1997) to date two rock painting samples from Red Cliffs, Arizona: a black (charcoal) pigment from a circular motif, and an overlying white dot added to a second black rounded-square motif. In 1993, dur- ing the Red Cliffs rock art recording project, Loendorf (1994) recorded rock art at two sites, AR-03-04-06-284 and AR-03-04-06-287 (Coconino National Forest). He noticed painted fragments on partially detached sandstone eroding from the wall of AR-03-04-06-287 and recommended that some of these be radiocarbon dated; three samples were subsequently removed from one of these circular mo- tifs for AMS radiocarbon analysis. SITE LOCATIONS The Red Cliffs rock art sites are west of Sedona, Arizona, in the northeastern corner of Yavapai County (Figure 1). They are located in Red Canyon, whose walls rise 50 to 75 m above its floor. Although six rock art sites in Red Canyon have been assigned site numbers, the rock art from only two sites, AR-03-04-06- 286 and AR-03-04-06-287, will be discussed in this paper. Few sites in the Red Cliffs area have been systematically investigated, but discoveries of Paleoindian and Archaic projectile points attest to an early human presence. A relative rock art chronology for the region has been devised by Pilles (1994), and both stylistic and chronometric analyses suggest that the rock art studied in this paper postdates the Paleoindian and Archaic periods. Instead, the images were probably created sometime after the advent of intensive agriculture and vil- lages in the region. During this period, between ca. A.D. 700 and A.D. 1300, Red Cliffs was in an area occupied by the Southern Sinagua. This area bordered the territories of other cultural groups, including the Hohokam to the south, the Northern Sinagua to the north, and the Salado to the east. The area around Red Cliffs is frequently associated with the Sinagua. Palatki, a Sinagua site in Red Canyon, was extensively used between about A.D. 1100 and 1300. Honanki, another major Sinagua site a few kilometers from Red Canyon, yielded tree-ring dates of 888p-983vv and 1197p-1271rB (Bannis- ter et al. 1966:4,5,17). The tree-ring cutting date of A.D. 1271rB is the most reli- able, but it does not indicate a temporal range for the use of the site; the 983vv</page><page sequence="3">Dated Rock Paintings at Red Cliffs, Arizona 255 Coconino Country Yavapai County SINAGUA Palatki* Honanki 9 - Red Cliff# SSedona .

These sites appear to represent the prime occupation immediately south of the Mogollon Rim, between about A.D. 1100 and 1300. After about A.D. 1300, Yavapais appeared in the Verde Valley; after 1425 or so, they appear to have been the sole occupants of the valley (Pilles 1981). Pilles (1981) believes that Yavapais are descended from the southern Sinagua, and that they survived in the region after the decline of the Sinagua by changing their subsistence pattern from farming to hunting and gathering. Be- cause Sinagua sites like Honanki and Palatki were still occupied in the A.D. 1200s, it is unlikely that any Yavapais intensively used the Red Canyon area until after 1300. Rock art at the six Red Cliffs sites was probably created by all of the cul- tural groups discussed previously, except Paleoindians (Loendorf 1994). RED CLIFFS ROCK ART Although Loendorf (1994) has identified several Red Cliffs rock art motifs as "shields," they could also represent the sun, spider webs, medicine wheels, or simply circular geometric forms. Indeed, Copeland and Rogers (1996) label simi- lar images "Big Round Things" in order to avoid interpretative complications. However, we think these forms represent shields, because very similar circular forms appear to depict human bodies hidden behind circular forms, suggesting that a human is concealed behind a shield. These human figures, labeled "shield- bearing warriors" or "shield anthropomorphs," are found at rock art sites from Alberta to Texas, though the latter are almost certainly historic (Gebhard 1966; Hirschmann and Thybony 1975; Wellmann 1979; Wormington 1955). Shield fig- ures are especially prominent in the rock art of Montana and Wyoming, where Mulloy (1958) dubbed them "shield-bearing warriors" and suggested that they represented pedestrian warriors who used large shields in combat to cover their bodies. Pedestrian warriors carrying large shields and battles where large shields were used are also described for the Plains (Bowers 1965:351; Hammond and Rey 1953:841; Tyrrell 1916:329). In addition, there are rock art scenes of pedes- trian warriors hiding behind large shields to defend themselves against mounted warriors carrying small shields (Conner and Conner 1971; Keyser 1977; Magne and Klassen 1991). Ewers (1955:203) concluded that shields were reduced in size by at least half their diameter when they were used by mounted warriors. Similar rock art figures of individuals behind large shields are found through- out the Southwest (Schaafsma 1980), including the Galisteo Basin of New Mexico (Schaafsma 1992:104, Fig. 147), the Dry Creek area of northern Utah (Schaafsma 1971:15), the Colorado Plateau, and the Four Corners region (Cole 1990; McCreery 1994:56). Perhaps the most notable shield figure in the latter area is the All Ameri- can Man, radiocarbon dated by Chaffee et al. (1994b) to 675.50 B.P. (uncalibrated).</page><page sequence="5">Dated Rock Paintings at Red Cliffs, Arizona 257 In all of these places, circular motifs occur with and without depictions of humans; often, both kinds of circular motifs are pictured at the same site, allowing researchers to compare manufacturing techniques and designs on those appearing to conceal human bodies with those that do not. It is on this basis that we suggest the circular figures at the Red Cliffs sites represent shields. We must note that all of the foregoing examples, however, are from the Plains or Anasazi areas. Such associations do not occur in the Mogollon-Sinagua-Salado area of Arizona. Thus, a term other than shield may be equally valid. PAINTED SHIELDS AT RED CLIFFS Shield 1 (Element 3 on Panel 25), AR-03-04-06-287, is a prominent black, rounded square with white painted dots near its center and an open, unpainted or stenciled dot pattern in its upper left quadrant (Figure 2). We ascertained that the rock surface had not been prepared prior to painting. This painting, which is 72 cm high and 84 cm wide, uses a raised ledge on the canyon wall's surface as its upper boundary. Eight red anthropomorphic figures are found along the top of the square. The black square is superimposed on a white figure, and though it is diffi- cult to see through the black overpainting, the figure appears to be one of the small white anthropomorphs associated with Sinagua use of this site (Loendorf 1994). To the right of the upper group of red anthropomorphs there is a small red handprint. We selected one of the white dots for AMS radiocarbon analysis; a black charcoal sample was also taken from this shield, but it did not contain enough charcoal to produce a radiocarbon date. Shields 2 and 3 (Figure 3), AR-03-04-06-287, are side by side on Panel 27. Shield 2 (Element 7, Panel 27) is more eroded than its neighbor and measures 81 cm in maximum diameter. Its circular motif is divided into quadrants by two sets of parallel lines that intersect near its center; the outer circumference is adorned with short, alternating black and white fringe lines. The figure is superimposed on a very faded and difficult to interpret anthropomorph. Two finely incised snake forms are also under the shield, but neither is visible in Figure 3. Pilles (1994) identifies these incised snakes as Archaic forms. The small snake has fine cross- hatching on its back, suggesting a diamondback rattlesnake. Other elongated, par- allel line forms are found near.this snake, but they do not display the fine cross- hatching designs. Shield 2 was also selected to sample black pigment for radio- carbon analysis. Shield 3 (Elements 15 and 26), AR-02-04-06-287, is shown in Figure 3. Ele- ment 15 is white, and Element 26 is a charcoal outline. This motif, near Shield 2, is a circular form 64 cm high by 68 cm wide. A small circle near its center is connected to sets of parallel lines extending to the edge of the circle and creating quadrants inside the shield. Short fringe lines are found around the exterior rim. The main circle is white; the fringes and the lines crossing the shield alternate</page><page sequence="6">258 ARMITAGE AND OTHERS 0 5 10 cm Figure 2. Shield 1, AR-03-04-06-287.

This shield is superimposed on a horizontal set of red zigzag lines and a vertical set of black zigzag lines painted on a white background. No sample was taken from Shield 3. Peter Pilles (personal communication, 1999) believes that the charcoal portion of Shield 3 is a later Yavapai addition to the white Sinagua circular motif. Shields 4 and 5 (Elements 9 and 10, Panel 34), AR-03-04-06-287, are shown in Figure 4. The dominant figure on Panel 34 is a red anthropomorph. This tall, armless figure with square shoulders, from whose head extend lines or rays, mea- sures 98 cm high and 23 cm wide. Shields 4 and 5, which are white and black and have maximum diameters of 41 cm and 47 cm, are superimposed on the red anthropomorph. Although both are fringed, only one is divided into quadrants by crossing zigzag lines. The black lines used to make the zigzags appear to have been made by using a charred stick, rather than with liquid paint. No samples were taken from Shields 4 and 5. RADIOCARBON DATING METHODS AND RESULTS A black charcoal pigment sample from Shield 2 was dated using our plasma- chemical extraction procedure (Chaffee et al. 1994a, 1994b; Hyman and Rowe 1997) and AMS (Finkel and Suter 1993). The sample consisted of several small, 2- to 4-mm flakes of paint that had partially detached from the wall. Because this figure is painted over a faded anthropomorph, the sample could include both the paint of the shield and that of the underlying faded anthropomorph. Thus, owing to possible mixing, this sample was not an ideal candidate for dating. The sample from Shield 2 appeared black on the rock painting, but after it was collected it looked grayish white, which is common when samples of charcoal pigment, un- derlying rock, and mineral accretion are mixed. The powder was examined with an optical microscope; several fibers (one of fabric and many others of plant material) were removed. The powder was dried overnight at -10080 C. After cleaning the empty plasma chamber with repeated oxygen plasmas until the residual carbon was less than 0.5 mg, the sample was loaded into the chamber. Argon plasmas were run to desorb carbon dioxide from the sample and chamber surfaces; absorbed carbon dioxide would result in an erroneously young age for the sample. The final of two argon plasmas yielded less than 0.5 mg carbon from surface carbon dioxide contamination. Past work with this technique has shown that &lt;1 mg carbon contamination causes no significant additional error in the final radiocarbon date. The sample chamber was again determined to be free of leaks after a 2.5-hour vacuum integrity check, yielding &lt;0.03 mg carbon. The organic material in the paint sample was then oxidized to carbon dioxide using a low-temperature (-15080 C), low-pressure (1 torr), oxy- gen plasma. The carbon dioxide generated during the plasma process was col- lected in a liquid nitrogen-cooled glass tube. Reaction with the plasma yielded 95</page><page sequence="9">Dated Rock Paintings at Red Cliffs, Arizona 261 0 5 10 cm Figure 4. Shields 4 and 5, AR-03-04-06-287. The dominant figure on the panel is a tall, anthropomorphic figure painted in red. The armless figure with a rounded head, from which rays extend, is 98 cm tall.

Radiocarbon analysis was carried out at the Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (CAMS-19407). This black pigment yielded a radiocarbon age of 1080.100 years B.P. (uncalibrated); calibration yielded the calendar age range A.D. 700 (960) 1210 at 2o (Stuiver and Reimer 1993, Method A). We also sampled one of the white dots on Shield 1. In the laboratory, it ap- peared moist and possibly hydroscopic, so it was dried overnight at -10080 C before being loaded into the plasma system. Chamber and sample surfaces were cleaned with oxygen and argon plasmas until less than 0.5 mg carbon was ob- tained. A two-hour vacuum integrity check of the plasma chamber showed no significant leaks, yielding &lt;0.005 mg carbon. The sample was then oxidized using a low-temperature, low-pressure (1 torr) oxygen plasma. The 140 mg of carbon produced was sealed into a glass tube and sent for radiocarbon analysis (CAMS- 19496). The age of the white dot is 550.100 years B.P. (uncalibrated); calibrated to A.D. 1280 (1410) 1620 at 2o (Stuiver and Reimer 1993; Method A). A third sample, containing black pigment, was taken from the body of Shield 1. It yielded only 40 mg of carbon, however, too little to provide a reliable ra- diocarbon date, and it was therefore not sent for radiocarbon analysis. CONCLUSIONS At the completion of the Red Cliffs rock art recording project, Loendorf (1994) proposed an Athapaskan affiliation for some of the shields. This was based on their designs and their similarity to other circular shield figures in Arizona that were suggested to be Apache (Schaafsma 1980:337). The idea that the Red Cliffs figures might be Athapaskan is also supported by Fewkes's description of rock art at Palatki (Fewkes 1898:556). However, because Fewkes did not specify which Apache group he was referring to, he may have meant Yavapais, who have often been erroneously called Apaches. Based on our current understanding of Athapaskan migration patterns, Shield 2 was probably created before there was an Athapaskan presence in the Verde Valley. Additional research is needed before identifying any of the Red Cliff shield paintings as Athapaskan, since dates alone cannot indicate cultural affiliation. Furthermore, because shields occur at other sites in the Sedona area, such as Honanki, they may be neither Apache nor Yavapai. Indeed, Pilles (1994) views them as a typical Sinagua manifestation. The most conspicuous rock painting on the cliff above Ruin I of Palatki is a circular white figure at a height far above the reach of a person standing on any of the ruin's walls. Its general character leads one of us (LLL) to believe that it was made by Apaches and not by the builders of Palatki. However, Shield 2 dates to a time when Palatki is believed to have been intensively used by the Sinagua. This suggests that the Sinagua painted rock art shields like those found at Anasazi and Fremont sites.</page><page sequence="11">Dated Rock Paintings at Red Cliffs, Arizona 263 Because rock art dating methods are still experimental, an age determination that conforms to the expected time frame supports, but certainly does not prove, that our technique is valid. The 983vv tree-ring date is noncutting, and thus it offers no support to our date range for Shield 2 of calibrated A.D. 700 (990) 1210. The only cutting date, 1271rB, postdates the 14C range by -60+ years and again offers no support for the date obtained, except that the charcoal pigment may represent "old wood." However, the radiocarbon date at least appears reasonable, and the age of the rock painting conforms to a time when there was extensive use of the region. The age determination for the white dots on Shield 1 is also of interest. Ap- parently, a later cultural group altered a previously drawn shield design after the Sinagua had abandoned the region. This is assuming that the two shield figures were contemporaneous, which seems more likely than that they were separated in time by some 500 years. We have no chronometric evidence that the shield is earlier than the dots. Since Shield 1 is not a truly circular geometric form, its interpretation as a shield may be questionable and weakens our assumption, based on stylistic grounds, that the date from Shield 1 may be similar to that of Shield 2. Nonetheless, all of the shields at the Red Cliffs sites have usually been assigned to the Sinagua. Through this research we suggest that other shields were created at Red Cliffs, or that dots were added to shield-like motifs after the Sinagua aban- doned the area. Acknowledgments.
