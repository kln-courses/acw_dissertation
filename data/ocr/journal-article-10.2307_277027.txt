<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY appreciation and support (or denial) of the several functional-developmental or evolutionary schemes post- ulated in recent years for the prehistoric culture se- quences of the Andean region, but Willey barely relates either his data or interpretations, if at all, to those schemes. On the other hand, this kind of criticism is only indicative of the great value of the work in presenting a large body of data of a new kind in Peruvian archae- ology, which opens the possibilities of a much more penetrating understanding of cultural institutions and processes in the Andean area. Willey pleads that the study is experimental, and it is perhaps with that cau- tion in mind that he has refrained from extensive infer- ence or speculation in this first work of its kind. The final chapter, "The Viru Valley in Peruvian Pre- history," places the settlement pattern data in Virui in relation to the rest of the country. The chapter amounts to a summary of the present knowledge of Peruvian prehistoric architecture, very valuable in itself, and serves not least to point up that the present work is unique in the advancement of knowledge of this phase of Peruvian archaeology. The work is excellently organized, with careful cross- referencing, summaries and recapitulations at all stages of presentation, and a wealth of site and valley maps. A series of plates, indifferently reproduced, illustrates the major architectural types in the valley. ROBERT STIGLER Columbia University New York, N.Y. The Civilization of the Maya. J. ERIC S. THOMPSON. Chicago Naturar History Museum, Popular Series, An- thropology, No. 25, 5th edition, Chicago, 1953. 96 pp. $.75. This is the fifth edition of a well-known handbook, first published in 1927. In accord with Museum policy the text has been revised for the most part, rather than entirely rewritten. I have compared this edition with the second edition, published in 1932. The general appearance of the handbook has been considerably improved, and the use of calendered paper has allowed the illustrations to be included in the body of the text. Changes and additions to the illustrations have provided a well-chosen coverage. The apportioning of space by subject matter has been scarcely changed; the greater part of the handbook is based on docu- mentary and ethnographic material. Archaeological dis- coveries have necessitated a rewriting of the historical account (12 pp.), Thompson's recent work on Maya hieroglyphics (Maya Hieroglyphic Writing: Introduction, Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1950) must have suggested the rewriting of his chapter on religion (11 pp.). The other sections of the book show minor changes and additions which give evidence of careful and complete revision. The text is up to date. The author cannot be fairly criticized for faults in relative emphasis of subject material in a text which has not been completely rewritten for 26 years. In general the text seems to me long on mythological and episodic account, short on culture history, settlement patterning, economy, and on material culture in general. There has also been little effort to dissect historical develop- ments from the intricate mass of religious myth and ritual which characterized the conquest period. That these materials represent the results of Mexican main- land influence on the Classic-stage Maya is unques- tioned, and Thompson has long held a leading position in efforts to unravel this tangle. The Civilization of the Mayas can be recommended as a good first reading on the subject. Thompson's recent volume on the Maya (The Rise and Fall of the Maya Civilization, University of Oklahoma Press), gives a clearer view of his present interests and ap- proach. GEORGE W.

Long surviving Portuguese conquest and missionary contact, the Tapaj6 Indians of the middle Amazon region maintained their pottery art unchanged to the 18th century. In a brief text accompanying an extensive set of illustrations of pottery vessels and ceramic designs from Santarem (cf. Bull. Univ. Mus. 6-2, Philadelphia 1935), Barata discusses the ware from a stylistic or aesthetic point of view, taking up in particular 5 animals which are frequently represented and which inspired the geometrical designs-snake, frog, owl, turtle, and wildcat; anthropomorphic figures are also treated. ERIK K. REED National Park Service Santa Fe, N.M. Revista Colombiana de Antropologia, Segunda Epoca. Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia, Bogoti. Government-supported anthropology in Colombia was reorganized in September, 1952, with the creation of the Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia to replace the older Instituto Etnologico Nacional and the Servicio Arqueologico Nacional. The new Institute initiated a program of publications in June, 1953, with the appear- ance of Vol. I, No. 1, of the Revista Colombiana de Antropologia, replacing the earlier Revista del Instituto Etnol6gico Nacional (4 vols., 1945-1950) and the Boletin de Arqueologia (3 vols., 1945-1951). The continuity between the old and new series is suggested by the phrase "segunda 6poca" added to the numbering of the 300 [ XX, 3, 1955</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS new Revista, the older journals being regarded as, in a sense, an earlier series. The first volume of the new Revista (Vol. I, No. 1, 1953) contains no archaeological articles, but the second (Vol. II, No. 2, 1954) has 2 important ones. Julio C6sar Cubillos and Victor A.

The quality of Colombian ar- chaeological work is commendably high at present, and other important contributions may be expected to ap- pear in this series. JOHN HOWLAND ROWE University of California Berkeley, Calif. The Conquest and Colonization of Honduras, 1502-1550. ROBERT S. CHAMBERLAIN. Carnegie Institution of Washington, Publication 598, Washington, 1953. vi +254 pp., 4 pls., map. $3.50 paper, $4.00 cloth. This work is a companion study to the author's The Conquest and Colonization of Yucatan, 1527-1550 (Pub- lication 582, 1948). Both works deal with activities of Francisco de Montejo, in whose career Chamberlain is particularly interested. The emphasis throughout is on Spanish politics and military affairs, the Indians being very much in the background except during the general revolt of 1537-39. There is no discussion of archaeology. The book will, however, be a valuable reference for anyone working in Honduran archaeology or historical ethnology since it gives a good account of the chron- ology and nature of the Spanish conquest. JOHN HOWLAND ROWE University of California Berkeley, Calif. Palenque, Una Ciudad Maya. LAURETTE SfJOURNE. Fondo de Cultura Econ6mica, Mexico, 1952. (Trans- lated from the original French.) 89 pp., illustrated. The author of this small but handsome book assisted Alberto Ruz in his work at Palenque in 1951 and thus has been involved to some extent in the exciting dis- coveries that have been made there during the last 5 years. She is not reporting on these discoveries in any systematic way, but is rather communicating her impres- sions of Palenque as a ruin and as one of the most beautiful and provocative of Maya sites. The book is really a verbal and pictorial essay on Palenque and on Maya civilization as a whole with various comments on the history of the Maya, on the sculptures, and on the nature of Maya society. The book is intended primarily for the general reader and can have only limited interest for the specialist. Of most value for the latter are photographs of some of the recently found sculptures of Palenque and certain views of the ruins and the surroundings not available else- where. GORDON F.

In the Southwest, and in most other archaeological areas of the New World, detailed textile analysis has not kept up with the number of specimens recovered in recent years; there is also a wealth of unstudied material in museums which has been collected over many years. This situation is due, in part, to the unwillingness of many archaeologists to learn the superficially complex terminology and methods of textile analysis, and to the limited time of the consultants who are already skilled in this field. In the Southwest, there have been surprisingly few detailed textile analyses published, in spite of the large amount of material available. Some of the notable examples of such studies will be found in the works of E. W. Haury, Lila O'Neale, C. L. Tanner, and Kate Peck Kent, who is now completing research on museum collections of Southwestern textiles. Some studies of ethnological collections, such as those by Charles Amsden and H. P. Mera, are often important for clarification of both textile techniques and archae- ological problems. There are also important studies of archaeological material for the Andean area by Lila O'Neale and Junius Bird, and a few others. Generally speaking, European studies of archaeological textiles seem in advance of ours. In recent years important aids to textile analysis have been derived from the textile industry; for example, use of the terms "S-twist" and "Z-twist," rather than the perennially confusing "left" and "right" or "clockwise" and "counterclockwise," establishment of descriptive terms for degree of twist of yarns, and standardization of terminology for the various kinds of weaves (see publications of the American Society for Testing Mate- rials). Recently many advances have been made in special aspects of textile analysis by borrowing tech- niques from fields such as physics, chemistry, and botany. However, little has been published concerning meth- ods of textile preparation and analysis specifically ori- ented toward archaeological materials. A new series of publications (begun in 1950) which will prove to be of considerable importance to archaeologists is reviewed here. At the present time, 8 numbers have been pub- lished. These include: No. 1, "Cleaning and Mounting Procedures for Wool Textiles," by F. S. Greene; No. 4, 301</page></plain_text>
