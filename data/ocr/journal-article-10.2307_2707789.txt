<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW * BAIRD'S ISHMAEL This is a distinguished book. Its distinction lies not so much in its array of marshalled facts (though there too it is impressive), as in the fulness and clearness with which it expresses a characteristic twentieth-century state of mind. For though Baird denies that his book is " in any sense to be regarded as apologetic or polemical" (p. 4), it is perfectly clear that the author too is an Ishmael, and that secretly, behind the objective discussions of his book, we can see him in search of answers to problems which he him- self has felt with passionate intensity. This assertion is not meant as a re- proach. It goes without saying that the value of a critical essay lies in the commitment of the author to his subject as well as in the accuracy and depth of his analyses. Baird has himself, like the writers he discusses, made his journey to the Orient. He has taught in Japan and at the University of Hawaii, and he served at the close of the Second World War in a Naval detachment charged with the civil administration of the Marshall and the East Caroline Islands. He thus has wide first-hand knowledge of the Orient and Oceania. But there is nothing of overt autobiography in his book. Rather, Baird's own experience is used implicitly as a test of the authenticity or inauthenticity of the relation to the Orient of the writers he discusses. Instead of autobiography, Ishmael presents a coherent set of distinctions leading to a full definition of what Baird calls the " authentic primitivism " of a group of writers flourishing from approximately 1850 to the present. This definition is then used to analyze in detail the work of these writers. By far the largest part of the book is concerned with Melville, for Baird the center of modern primitivism. The coherent system of evaluations which this book develops springs from what may seem a strange amalgamation of Jung and Susanne Langer. Its aesthetics is born of Philosophy in a New Key, and its concept of primi- tivism derives from Jung, especially from The Integration of the Personal- ity. The originality of Baird's method is his merger of these two sources, and, one may say, his avoidance of the more vulnerable parts of both. The fundamental premise of Baird's book is the idea that " primary " art is like religion in that both are concerned with the relation between man and transcendent being. The function of both is to provide sacramental symbols through which in " corporateness the individual is made one with his fellows in communion with the deity " (p. 56). Art which does not provide such symbols is not primary. The purpose of Baird's book is to describe a new " system " of primary art which has arisen in the past hundred years in re- sponse to the cultural failure of Occidental civilization based on Christianity. Taking a cue from T. S. Eliot, Baird defines a "multiple system of litera- ture " as an " organic whole" "demonstrating through forms of symbolic expression, which are singularly developed, a uniform allegiance to a subject idea " (p. x). Within such a system criticism can proceed by comparison, *Baird, James, Ishmael (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1956. Pp. xxviii, 445. $5.50). 555</page><page sequence="2">556 J. HILLIS MILLER the juxtaposition of texts so that they mutually illuminate and define one another. The "subject idea" of moder primitivism is the search in the Orient and in Oceania for symbolic forms to replace the dead symbols of Christianity. This transference of allegiance represents one of the rare modulations in the idiom of Western art. The idea of feeling and the notion of an opposition between feeling and intellect appear again and again in Baird's book, and may be said to be fundamental to its thought. Following a tradition by now ancient and honorable in aesthetics, Baird connects authentic art with feeling and in- authentic art with arid and schematic reason. This may seem to be a mere re-affirmation of Susanne Langer's definition of art as "the creation of forms symbolic of human feeling." But Baird avoids the chief weakness of Mrs. Langer's system. For her, the symbol, though abstracted from sen- sible forms, is oriented inward. It is the form of a human feeling, and has as its function the embodiment of that feeling. But this theory raises a set of problems which Mrs. Langer, it seems to me, never satisfactorily answers. Can feelings exist separately from their forms, and, if so, in what form? If they exist separately outside of consciousness, how can we speak of them at all, or know that they exist? If they exist only as contents of consciousness, are they not already formed; that is to say, do not feelings always exist as inextricably merged with the conceptual or perceptual forms which are their bodies? And, if this is the case, how can we accept a theory which seems to presuppose the antecedent existence of naked, unembodied feelings and the search by the artist for a form which will exactly symbolize them? Baird by-passes all these vexing problems. For him, the emotive con- tent of authentic art is simply evidence that the artist was deeply engaged in the situation which his symbol expresses. The " feeling " is a sign of the embrace of objective reality by the imagining mind. On the one hand there is the artist of externalities, who coldly arranges his materials in technically admirable patterns. On the other hand, there is the "existential" artist, face to face with an objective reality which is " sensuously known and emo- tively felt" (p. 119), and through which he seeks to come to " the vision of man's original center, where the meaning of human existence is expressed in God-consciousness" (p. 67). The true artist's symbols embody this vision of the center. For Baird, then, the feeling in authentic art always coexists with knowledge, knowledge first of the material world through sensation and perception, and then of the divine behind and through that. This use of the concept of feeling is at least logical. It permits Baird, for example, to dis- tinguish with perfect clarity between what he calls "existential primi- tivism" and "exoticism," which revels without affective engagement in images of the far East. The drama of recent history for Baird is the cultural failure of Western civilization and the genesis of primitivism. For him, "cultural failure means the loss of a regnant and commanding authority in religious symbol- ism, since religion is here understood as the ultimately effective symbolic authority in the total culture of a race " (p. 16). Baird gathers an impres-</page><page sequence="3">BAIRD'S ISHMAEL 557 sive body of evidence, from Schweitzer, Spengler, Nietzsche, Bourget and others, to reconstruct the familiar picture of the bankruptcy of Christianity in the modern world. But Baird's analysis has an unusual twist which puts a certain characteristic of Protestantism at the root of the evil. For him, following here both Langer and Jung, the act of symbolization is essential to man: "The spiritual essence of man's existence must be represented not through reason qua reason but through the authority of vital symbols com- manding the subservience of the individual, existentially sceptical will" (p. 22). The history of Protestantism has been the history of the demoli- tion of the great structure of symbolic forms created by medieval Catholi- cism. This has eventually left man without mediation, face to face with God, in an intolerably direct I-You relationship. Protestantism, then, is the villain. But, in another sense, Protestantism is the hero, for, in Baird's view, those recent artists who have remained within Catholicism have merely perpetuated moribund symbols, pallid, inert forms which are dying of inani- tion. The very decadence of Protestantism has enabled man, in Jung's phrase, to " rediscover the gods as psychic factors " (quoted p. 62): " In the realm of art, something has been going on in the last century which is wholly unlike any other development in the aesthetic history of the Chris- tian era. Artistic expression originating in the Protestant or "Protes- tantly " derived mind has been laboring with the construction of symbols to compensate for a lost sacramentalism. In this act, art has become, in the strictest possible sense, religion " (p. 58). This art which is religion is given its master symbol, for Baird, in Melville's description of the "white sailor- savages " aboard the Pequod, in the middle of the vast Pacific, each carving, in wood or ivory, his own idiosyncratic image of the whale as God-symbol. Each man worships alone, but his private symbol of the divine, mixing what he remembers of lost Christian symbols with his new allegiance to Non- Christian (Oriental) experience, "suggests the possibility of a new sacra- mental corporateness " (p. 60). The process of the formation of new artistic symbols to replace the lost Christian ones is, in Baird's analysis, a series of interlocking steps, each leading to the next. First there must be a painful awareness of cultural failure and loss of faith in the symbols of Christianity. This throws the potential primitivist into atavism, "reversion, thoroughly dependent upon feeling, to the past in a search for a prototypic culture" (p. 18). This atavism liberates from the unconscious of the artist the universal archetypes which have been lost or distorted in the over-intellectualized systems of Christianity. Baird depends here on Jung, but in the last and all-important step in his account of the development of genuine primitivistic art he goes beyond Jung. And in going beyond Jung he evades the Jungian tendency to identify art with the dreams of the collective unconscious. For the true symbol to come into being the collective archetype of atavistic reversion must be merged with an autotype. This autotype is a " facsimile of singular experience" (p. 18). Baird's true primitivists must, in other words, have actually traveled in the Orient and have " derived from direct physical ex-</page><page sequence="4">558 J. HILLIS MILLER perience a medium of feeling to inform the symbols which their art pre- sents" (p. 6). Thus Melville's voyages in Oceania were absolutely neces- sary to his creation of a new religious art, and only those artists who show all the steps in this process are labeled by Baird as genuine primitivists. Other artists showing some of the elements are used for comparison. Mel- ville is "the symbolistic center" (p. 122) of Oceanic reference in moder primitivism, and at varying degrees of distance from that center are Charles Warren Stoddard, Mark Twain, George Louis Becke, Pierre Loti, Henry Adams, Gauguin, Victor Segalen, Ernest Fenollosa, Lafcadio Heam, and others. Stevenson and Conrad represent, for Baird, artists who had direct experience of the Orient but who refused to make the leap of rejecting the Occident and its values, while Leconte de Lisle, Ducasse (Lautreamont), Rimbaud, and Verhaeren are each " potentially Ishmael, or Ishmael in fact, without the Oceanic or Oriental journey" (p. 161). But how do the Oceanic or Oriental symbols of Melville's art and the art of those who follow him cohere to form a unique reading of the meaning of human existence? In the third and fourth parts of his book (" Avatars: Symbols of Reincarnation from the Orient" and " Images from the Urwelt: The World before Civilization ") Baird discusses the specific symbolic con- tent of the work of Melville and the other "primitivists." The details of these interpretations cannot be repeated here, though Melville specialists will find challenging readings of crucial passages. But it is possible to show how the meanings of the various symbols Baird finds come together to dis- play a particular religious vision opposed to that of traditional Christianity. It is important to recognize that Baird's primitivists are inspired not only by the landscape and by the fauna of Oceania and the Orient, but by the vi- sion of a certain culture which inhabits these regions. This culture may be in part determined by its surroundings, and behind the cultural forms may be the " Urwelt," the world before civilization, but the culture which is in 1vital contact with this Urwelt is of primary importance in forming the auto- types of primitivistic art. In place of Western Christian civilization, which has become more and more completely the urban, mechanized culture of death-in-life, these Ishmael voyagers found embodied in Oceanic and Ori- ental cultures a sense of " deep time." These cultures had not lost contact with the mythical time of origin, conceived either as a primeval time or as an ever-present eternal time underlying the present. Making contact with this deep time and with the cultures embodying it, Melville and his brother primitivists created symbols for a new ethos and for a new concept of God. In place of the Christian-tragic ethos in which self-destructive reason pits itself face to face with the mystery of life and demands to know the secrets of God (Ahab), they put the " Polynesian ethos," whose highest wisdom is acquiescence in the inscrutable mystery of God (Queequeg). In place of the Western cult of individual personality they put Queequeg's indifference to death. For the Christian antinomies of good and evil and the dogma of the fall of man, they substituted the " eternal innocence " of the Oceanic native and the sailor-savage (Billy Budd), the concept of " tayo " or fraternal love,</page><page sequence="5">BAIRD'S ISHMAEL 559 and the equable acceptance of eros and the shadowy side of life. Against the dead nature of the scientific West they put a nature animistically alive in every part. And in place of the anthropomorphic God of Christianity they put the impersonal " God beyond theism " whose master-symbol is the white whale. This primitivist God is better symbolized by the monster of the deep than by any human form, for he is the vital, pre-human energy of all generation surging up from the fecund sea. And the whale is white, the color containing all hues, for the primitivist God is beyond good and evil, contains them both without contradiction, and can be reached equally well by a thousand different roads: " Of Moby Dick all things are true, accord- ing as the mind of the Almighty sees itself, not as the mind of man aspires to order it to conformity. Ishmael as Taji of Mardi has said of the great Oro only that he indubitably is. It must then follow that the timelessness of God, named in the chronology of human culture with a thousand dif- ferent names and through a thousand different formal theologies, is but the being of Oro, or the being of his parent Taaroa, or the being of the father of all Oriental gods, the Hindu Brahma " (p. 323). To this outline of the ethos and the theology of existential primitivism only one further element must be added: Since the primitivists are disillu- sioned white men and not Polynesian "savages," they tend to make the symbols of their religious art amalgamations of Oceanic or Oriental " auto- types " and the remembered forms of their Christian inheritance. Moby Dick is thus the Leviathan of Job and Jonah's whale as well as the Chinese or Indian Dragon of the Great Deep. But these amalgamations tend not to reaffirm traditional Christianity, but to reaffirm the Christian symbols at a point prior to the formation of dogmatic Christianity. Thus Billy Budd is Christ as well as the innocent sailor-savage, but he is the Christ of inno- cence and brotherly love rather than the Christ of dogma who, in Pro- methean suffering, took upon himself the sins of the world. We may agree that the cultural situation of the West is as Baird de- scribes it. The central experience of modern man is the experience of dis- tance-distance from nature, from society, from God, and from himself. And what he is distant from, and sees coldly across this gap, is put in ques- tion by the mere fact that he beholds it so-at arm's length. When they have been put in question, nature, society, God and self become brittle, thin; they begin to appear as illusory fabrications of the spectator's own conscious- ness. Finally they disintegrate altogether, and consciousness is left abso- lutely alone with the sensation of falling endlessly into its own void. The central need of modern thought has been the re-establishment of contact with being, and the founding of a vivifying relation to this being. As Jean Wahl puts it: " Distance et communion, tel est l'homme " (Traite de Meta- physique, p. 561). And we may agree with Baird that this communion can only take place through mediation, through the transformation into symbol of something concretely experienced. But one may question whether Baird has been " primitive" enough in his analysis of this situation. His book as a whole implies that, as he says explicitly on p. 423, the world is now faced with a choice between the cul-</page><page sequence="6">560 J. HILLIS MILLER tures of the West and the East. This would seem to affirm Baird's belief in the absolute validity of the symbols of the Orient as they are reinterpreted in primitivism, since it is clear that, for him, the symbols of orthodox Chris- tianity are dead. But on the same page he makes a significant admission, an admission which seems to contradict what he has just said and to throw a strange light backwards over all his book: " it must be said that the Orient will probably never again assume the symbolic meaning which it is seen ideally to possess in the symbols of Ishmael " (p. 423). In other words, the choice of the Orient is no longer a possible option. Two causes may be ad- duced for this: Western culture is invading and destroying Oriental cultures. The innocent Polynesian savages no longer exist. They now drink Coca Cola and listen to the radio. Moreover, "the contemporary Orient now emerges from the unknown to the known" (p. 424), and this knowledge, anthropological or whatever, destroys the Orient as a source of the feeling of " ideality" (p. 424) necessary for the formation of the vital symbols of art. "The question of the present," then, as Baird puts it, " becomes the interesting one of genesis for the symbols of feeling that are to be " (p. 424). To put it another way, contemporary man must start again from the beginning, without the symbols of any culture, Oriental or Occidental, and even without the archetypes of Jung. One suspects these archetypes. They do not seem to be primitive at all, but to be heavy with the long history of civilization, and we are free of history and civilization. Each of us, in Wal- lace Stevens' phrase, is the " latest freed man," and confronts the world in a situation more primitive than that of any of Baird's " primitivists." The elements of this situation are more primitive, and, one might say, more gen- eral, than those with which Baird deals: consciousness at grips with objects of sensation, objects not yet possessing meaning or value, any objects, just those objects which happen to be there, inhabiting time and space. Man today is no longer in the world, or not yet in the world. And it is from this extreme situation that he must move forward to find a meaning for his life, and to reintegrate himself into the world. The last pages of Ishmael seem to recognize this as our present situation. But the chief error of the book, in spite of the great light it casts on Melville and the other writers discussed, is not to recognize that this situation has been the essential one of Western man for at least one hundred and fifty years. This error leads Baird to put a movement which is in some degree peripheral at the center of recent cultural history, and to undervalue all those writers who, without direct allegiance to orthodox Christianity and without the Orient either, have in one way or another started again from the beginning. The latter tradition is perhaps the central one, the tradition of the French, English, and German romantics, the tradition of Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarme, and Wallace Stevens, the tradition of the contemporary French " romans blancs." To say this is not to denigrate Baird's admirable analyses, but only to assert that he claims more centrality for his Oriental primitivists than they in fact possess. The Johns Hopkins University. J.
