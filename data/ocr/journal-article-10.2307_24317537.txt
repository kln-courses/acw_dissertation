Aside from a certain architectural complexes some especially outstanding examples plastic equilibrium what contributes to the beauty of this of this peculiar plastic integration, beginning with the most monument, despite the partial destruction it has suffered, is striking one, the famous Staircase of the Hieroglyphics. It is the delicate treatment of the different planes of the reliefs, so called because the vertical faces of each of its steps are a delicacy which can only be fully appreciated in some of covered with rows of glyphs which constitute the longest the better preserved areas such as, for example, the fine small known Maya inscription. This staircase is decorated with great masks which together with other complex ornaments adorn three-dimensional sculptures set into its central axis which in the belt and the breechclout of the priest who is facing east. their majority represent royal personages.

In the Staircase of the Jaguars, sculptures which parallel to the execution of those monoliths for example, there is a dramatic contrast between the severe covered enormous interior and exterior surfaces of almost all volumes of the building and the vigorous relief carving of two the buildings which were built here during the city's period erect jaguars which flank the main staircase and whose effect of splendor. is happily balanced at the top by an enormous mask of a divinity. In the small Spectators' Stand the rows of seats ter minate at the top in two great prostrate figures who shake rattles and whose monkey masks are decorated with snakes. In addition to these impressive guardian figures there are many other elements which subtly balance the whole, the large mask which juts out of the center of the top step, the footing of glyphs which decorate this same step whose bottom parts seem to flow down onto the next step. On the level of the upper platform there are those immense carved stone seashells reinforced by the powerful impact of the great niches which ornament the pyramidal base like doorways with their effect of chiaroscuro. Lastly we can mention Temple 22 which retains its enormous masks at its corners and whose entrance doorway simulates the open jaws of a serpent, a feature more frequently found in the styles of the Yucatán peninsula. Its frieze has been demolished but from its wreck age have been rescued those busts of young men who seem to be singing with graceful gestures. But even more striking for its plastic strength is the interior of this building dominated by two stout caryatids standing on skulls who support the rest of the composition in which writhe fantastic mythological beings and playful elves. This brief view of the art of the Rio Motagua region would be incomplete if we did not devote a few lines to Quiriguá which lies in Guatemala. Although in many aspects the cul tural development of this site was stimulated by Copán, Qui riguá exceeded its teachers in the size of its monoliths as well as to a lesser extent in the fantasy of certain crations. The stelae erected here after 751 A.D. range between five and ten meters in height and the personage portrayed on one or two faces generally stands on the large mask of a divinity.But save for examples of special ornamental richness or a happy combination of lines the human figure here does not acquire life in spite of the fact that the artist generally cuts away the stone deeply around the head which in reality only accentuates the rigidity of the design. The so called "zoomorphs" which for a space of twenty years replaced stelae at Quiriguá are remarkable for their size and plastic conception. They are carved on immense mon olitic blocks up to four meters long and suggest strange crouching animals covered with a complex ornamentation in which the hieroglyphic texts are entwined in a delirious "tropical fantasy". 91</page><page sequence="3">WIS ^ lF ^ Jonuta, Chiapas, Lapida: Clasico Tardio.
