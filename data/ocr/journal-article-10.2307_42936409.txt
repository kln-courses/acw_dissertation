<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeological Excavations M. K. Dhavalikar Indian archaeology has made rapid strides since indepen- dence. Although the partition dealt a severe blow to archaeology by depriving it of all the then known sites of the Indus civilization, the loss has been made good by the discovery of Harappan settle- ments within the country. The advent of independence also witnessed the end of the British hegemony in Indian Archaeology; Sir Mortimer Wheeler, the last British Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India, left in 1943, but by then he had trained a whole new generation of Indian archaeologists who were well versed in the latest archaeological techniques. The Wheeler in era marks the ushering in of problem-oriented archaeology in India. It put a stop to all haphazard digging which was more in the nature of treasure hunting. As a result, several new aspects of our ancient past have been brought to light. The present paper is a review of the results obtained by planned archaeological excavations and explorations in the country during the past twenty five years. A casual glance at the back-numbers of Indian Archaelogy-A Reveiew will show that Indian archaeologists have been extremely active during the last twenty five years and many of them belonged to different universities and research institutions. It is neither desirable to enumerate all the excavations conducted in the post-independence period it is impossible to compress the entire plethora of evidence within the short span of the present paper. In the following pages, therefore, an attempt has been made to give an account of the principal excavations and their significance in the understand- ing of the various stages of the growth of Indian civilization. The principal sites have been described first, followed by those of lesser importance, more particularly those which only repeat the culture- sequence. Moreover, the sites have been described according to region and also according to their importance culturally. The main aim is to narrate a continuous story of Indian civilization in all its glory. B...-4</page><page sequence="2">42 M. K. Dhavalikar Indus Civilization The planned explorations by Ghosh ( 1952 ) in the Rajasthan desert brought to light a number of Harappan settlements of which Kalibangan was excavated on a large scale by the Archaeological Survey of India. The evidence shows that it was the provincial capital of the sprawling Indus empire. But the site was first occupied by a pre-Harappan people whose culturéis characterised by a ceramic industry which has been classified by Thapar (1973) into six different fabrics. However, the Harappans soon appear at the site and completely dominate their predecessors, so much so that their forebearers totally disappear in course of time. The Harappan settlement at Kalibangan consists of the twin areas, the citadel and the lower city; the former was well fortified with defence-walls and towers. Stratigraphical evidence shows that the citadel was first built by the pre-Harappans. There is no- thing special about the structures inside the citadel, but the fire altars found in it are indeed interesting. They are oval on plan and have a clay disc in the centre. There were four such altars in a row. They are undoubtedly related with the religion of the inhabitants. The lower city was situated to the east of the citadel. It has as usual, well laid out streets which were provided with fending posts at corners. A number of burials were excavated in the ceme- tary; they consisted of extended inhumations and urn burials, in well- cut pits and furnished with a number of pottery vessels. But of great interest are the symbolic burials which consisted of urns in pits but withont any skeletal remains in them. This mode of burial constitutes a new feature of the Harappan culture at Kali- bangan. A series of C-14 dates shows that the Harappan culture can now be dated to 2350 B. C.- 1750 B. C. (Agrawal 1971). The remains of the Harappan culture have also been unear- thed at Rupar ( Dist. Ambala, Punjab ) ( Sharma 1955-56 ) and Alamgirpur, Dist Meerut, U. P. ( I AR 1958-59). The latter is by far the easternmost Harappan outpost in the heart of Madhyadesa. At both the sites, the Harappans appear to have deserted the site which was later occupied after a lapse of a thousand years by the Painted Grey Ware users. At Alamgirpur, the cultural break is</page><page sequence="3">Archaeological Excavations 43 stratigraphically represented by a sterile layer, whitish in colour, which suggests a drastic change in the climate which possibly became more arid. It therefore appears that devastating famines probably led to the extinction of the Harappan culture in Rajasthan and western U. P. Rivers Saraswati and Drishadvati, which figure so prominently in the Vedic lore, began to dry up around 1800 B. C., for we find the settlements of the P. G. W. people right in the dried up bed of the Sarasvati a thousand years later. The pollen analysis of the Rajathan lake sediments also shows a dry phase around 1800 B. C. (Gurdiep Singh 1971). The extension of the mature Harappan culture has been traced in the Saurashtra peninsula as evidence from a number of sites would show. Here Lothal, about 40 miles from Ahmedabad, appears to be the provincial centre of the Indus civilization. The site has been extensively excavated by Rao (1973) who has divided the occupation into two cultural periods and five sub-periods based on the evidence of structures. Lothal conforms to the Harappan pattern of town-planning with citadel and lower city, but the most noteworthy feature of the city was the dockyard ( 120 x 71 m. ) built of bricks and provided with an inlet channel and spillway. It was a high-tide port and the principal outlet for Harappan trade with West Asia, more particularly the Persian Gulf region, for the button seals of the Persian Gulf type have been found at Lothal. Baveru of the Jataka stories may not be Babylon but Baherin, and Vārvrī appears to be its Vedic form. Another important Harappan site, Roj adi ( Dist. Rajkot, Gujarat), located on the river, Bhadarhas yielded a threefold sequ- ence of cultures of which the earliest is protohistoric. It is further divided into two sub-phases A and B; in the former typical Harappan forms suchas the perforated jar, the dish-on-stand, the stud handled bowl etc. occur whereas in Phase B a white painted black-and-red ware is introduced ( IAR 1958-59 ). Desalpur (Dist. Kutch, Gujarat) was a fortified Harappan settlement (IAR. 1963-64 ). The fort wall was built of bricks with stone veneer and had bastions. The houses were built against the fort wall. Harappan occupation at the site has been divided into two sub-phases on the basis of the evidence of pottery. Period II is characterised by the black painted cream and red-slipped pottery and structures in the construction of which y</page><page sequence="4">44 M. K. Dhavalikar stones rifled from the fortification wall of the earlier period were used. Thus it is clear that the fortification wall fell into disuse during Period II. Excavations at Rangpur (Dist. Surendranagar, Gujarat ) have proved to be of great importance in-as-much as they tell us the later history of the Harappans. ( Rao 1962-63 ). In the lowest levels ( Period I. G. 2000 B. G. ) are found microlithic tools without the association of pottery. Period II ( Circa 2000-1000 B. C. ) is Harappan and is divided into three sub-phases A, B, and C. The typical Harappan pottery and artefacts such as the terracotta cakes occur in all the phases. Besides, a black and red pottery also occurs as at Lothal. On the basis of the evidence of pottery, the excavator has designated Period II-A as Harappan, II-B as decadent Harappan and II-C as the degenerate Harappan. Period III ( Circa 1000-800 B. C. ) is characterised by a painted ceramic which has been labelled as the Lustrous Red Ware which appears to have been evolved out of the Harappan. According to the excavator, the Harappans at Rangpur were the citizens of Lothal who had to desert the city because of floods. Late Harappan Culture has also been found at Malwan ( Dist. Surat)-( Joshi 1972 ). A new chalcolithic culture has been discovered at Somnath or Prabhas Patan ( Dist. Junagadh, Gujarat ) which is a sacred place for the Hindus because of the Jyotirling there. The site was formerly dug by the Gujarat Government and the M. S. University of Baroda ( Mehta et. al. 1971 ) and recently by the Deccan College, Poona, in collaboration with the Gujarat Govern- ment ( I AR. 1971-72 ). The site was occupied first around 2000 B. C. by a people whose culture is characterised by a red sliped ware, black and red ware and incised grey ware. These people had contacts with the Harappans in Saurashtra and their culture comes to an end around 1800 B. C. possibly because of the devastating floods in the river Hiran, but the site was soon occu- pied by the people who used the Prabhas ware which appears to have been derived from or greatly influenced by the Harappan pottery. The Prabhas culture ( Period II, Circa 1800-1500 B. C.) continues to survive in Period III ( Circa 1500-1200 B. C. )</page><page sequence="5">Archaeological Excavations 45 which is distinguished by the occurrence of the Lustrous red ware. A large structure of this period was found; it consists of a number of units of two rooms, one large and the other small, the former having a small platform built of four large flat-topped stones. It is built of miliolite limestone set in mud masonry. A unique find of this period is a steatite seal-amulet carved with five stylized deer on one side and seven similar ones on the other. A solitary obsidian flake, which has been found for the first time in the country shows that the people had trading contacts with West Asia, more particularly with south-eastern Turkey. The site was deserted in Circa 1200 B. C. for reasons yet unknown to us. Amra ( Dist. Halar, Gujarat ) yielded typical Harappan pottery from the levels of Period I along with the black and red ware. Here the culture-sequence is almost the same as at Lakkhabaval which is quite close to it (IAR 1955-56). Sur Kotada ( Dist. Kutch, Gujarat ) is situated on the fringe of the Rann of Kutch. Large scale excavations by J. P. Joshi ( 1972 ) have revealed characteristic Harappan planning with a citadel and a lower city. The citadel is a massive structure built of mud and mud-brick with a stone veneer and provided with bastions and guard rooms. The occupation is entirely Harappan ' and is divided into three sub-phases. In phase I A a few polychrome sherds have been found along with the Harappan pottery. The reserve-slip-ware also occurs in this phase. In phase IB a coarse red ware is associated with the Harappan pottery whereas in phase IG the prédominent ceramic is a red ware of granulated texture; the Harappan ware of course continues to occur, but the white painted black and red ware is also introduced. Among the animal bones, the most noteworthy are those of Onager ( Equtis onager indikus) and the domesticated horse ( Equus cabalus Linn.). A series of radio-carbon determinations show that the Harappan settlement here flourished during 2100-1700 B. C. The explorations in Kutch by J. P. Joshi have brought to light a number of Harappan settlements. Their existence shows that the Harappans also used the land route and came to Kutch and then also reached north Gujarat and Saurashtra; for the pur- poses of trade they might have used the sea route also ( Joshi 1972 ).</page><page sequence="6">46 M. K. Dhavalikar Copper Hoards and the 0. C. P. A number of copper hoards comprising harpoons, bracelets, large anthropomorphic figures etc. have been reported during the last seventy years from several sites in the Ganga valley. They have almost always been found accidentally and consequently they remained an enigma. They were variously ascribed to the Aryans (Heine-Geldern 1936) the Harappan refugees ( Piggott 1950 ) and to the autochthons (Lai 1951 ). But in the recent excavations at Saipai ( Dist. Etawah, U. P. ) a copper spearhead and a harpoon were found in association with the O. C. P. (Lai 1972). The O. C. P., which too is an enigma, is a black on red painted ware, which occurs at most of the copper hoard sites. On the basis of the thermoluminiscence dates, Lai has assigned it to the first half of second millenium B.C. (Lai 1972). This consequently enables us to date the copper hoards to the same period. The stratigraphical position of the O. C. P. became clear at Atranji Khera ( Dist. Aligarh, U. P. ) where the ware occurs in the earliest levels (Gaur 1972). But there is a break in occupation between the O. C. P. and the succeeding black and red ware cul- ture which in its turn is overlain by the P. G. W. deposit for which a C-14 date is 1025 ± 100 B. C. This, according to Lai ( 1972 ), also supports the dating of the O. C. P. and the copper hoards. The O. C. P. sherds from Ambkheri exacavations ( I AR 1963- 64 ) have the slip intact but are devoid of any painted decoration. The excavator regards this pottery as a degenerate Harappan ceramic. The remains of a brick kiln were also found at the site. The P. G. W. The Painted Grey Ware is the prédominent protohistoric ceramic of North India, more especially the western U. P. and eastern Rajasthan. The excavations at Atranji Khera, however, show that the black and red ware preceded it. The single C-14 date for the P. G.W. at Atranji Khera of 1025 B. C. is by far the earliest, although a series of the radio carbon dates lead us to conclude that the ware should be assigned to Circa 800-500 B. C. The ware was first identified at Ahichchhatra (Dist. Bareilly, U. P. ) but its stratigraphical position became clear at Hastinapur</page><page sequence="7">Archaeological Excavations 47 (Lai 1955). It was initially thought to bea copper age culture, but several excavations in the Central Ganga basin yielded iron objects pointing to the knowledge of iron technology. (Lai 1955) ascribed this ware to the Aryans of the Mahabharata as the ware has been found at many of the sites associated with the story of the epic. Hastinapur was the capital of the Pandavas, the heroes of the epic and it was according to the Puranic tradition, later abandoned by Nichaksu, a descendent of the Pandavas, because of floods in the Ganga. Consequently the capital was shifted to Kausambi. This flood, according to the excavator, has been strati- graphically represented at Hastinapur. Kausambi, where the capital of the Pandavas was shifted, has also been excavated. ( Sharma 1960 &amp; 1969). Extensive remains of an ancient habitation at Kosam ( Dist. Allahabad, U. P. ) represent the ancient city of Kausambi. Although it came to prominence only in the early historical period, the first occupa- tion at the site goes back to about 1200 B. C. The first cultural period dated to Circa 1165-885 B. C. is characterised by a sturdy red ware which according to Sharma, has affinities with the Harappan and the chalcolithic pottery from Central India. The most noteworthy structure of the period is the impressive eastern rampart, repaired with a brick revetment. It recalls to the mind the massive defence wall at Harappa. It was repaired several times, and bastions, guard rooms etc. were added to it. The second cultural period ( 885-605 B. C. ) is distinguished by a decadent grey ware with paintings in black. It also occurs at Sravasti ( Dist. Baharaish, U. P. ) and Sohagaura (Dist. Gorakh- pur, U. P. ). At Kausambi the N. B. P. occurs in Period III. At Sravasti (Dist. Baharaish, U. P.). a few sherds of N. B. P. have been found in the early levels alongwith some pottery which technologically represents a stage preceding the fullblooded N. B. P. This is followed by N. B. P. some of which is painted in buff or cream. The motifs are reminiscent of those on the P. G. W. (Sinha 1967). Sravasti therefore possibly represents a stage between the P. G. W. and the N. B. P.</page><page sequence="8">48 M . K. Dhavalikar The Neolithic Problem Neolithic polished and ground stone tools were collected in large numbers from time to time from many sites in southern Deccan, but their stratigraphical position in South India was first established by Wheeler's excavations at Brahmagiri in 1947 (Wheeler 1947-48). Since then some very important neolithic sites such as Piklihal, Utnur, Tekkalkota, Sangankal, Maski, Hallur etc. have been excavated during the last 25 years and they thorw a flood of light on the beginning of settled life in the southern Deccan. The Brahmagiri evidence recurs at Maski ( Dist. Raichur, Mysore ) and Thapar (1957), following Wheeler, dated the neolithic habi- tations (Period I) to the first half of first millenium B. C. But the antiquity of the southern neolithic was stretched back to the latter half of the third millemium B. C. by the excavations at Piklihal and Utnur (Allchin 1960 &amp; 1961). The ash mounds at Utnur and Kupgal represent the cattle-pens of the neolithic farmers. At all these neolithic sites polished stone tools such as axes and microliths of chert were found in association with a thick coarse grey ware and black-on-red painted ware. The excavations at Sangankal (Dist. Bellary, Mysore) have revealed the existence of the pre-neolithic blade flake industry which may ultimately prove to be the precurser of the neolithic (Sankalia 1969). Such a transitional phase is also suggested by the Brahmagiri Pre-I microlithic phase (Seshadri 1956). A crude blade industry is also reported from the earlier levels of Utnur and Piklihal. However, the transition from the food-gathering to the food-producing stage is nowhere clearly established. What we have at most of the southern neolithic sites is full-fledged farming communities living on granite hill tops or levelled terraces on hill sides. At Tekkalkota ( Dist. Bellary, Mysore ) the first farmers of the southern Deccan were living in round huts which are strikingly similar to those of the tribal Boyas in that region (Nagaraja Rao 1965). The excavation of ash mounds at Kupgal and Utnur have shown that they represented the neolithic cattle-pens (Allchin 1963, Mujumdar &amp; Rajaguru 1966). The southern neolithic culture is characterised by a thick, coarse grey ware which is hand-made or fashioned on tournette; it</page><page sequence="9">Archaeolgical Excavations 49 is sometimes decorated with red ochre, usually on the rims of vessels. The people used ground polished stone tools such as axes, chisels etc. and also had a flake-blade industry. They had domesticated cattle, sheep and goat and practised agriculture. Among the crops, the most important seems to be Ragi ( Eleucine coracana) and it is interesting to note that the wild species of Ragi (. Eleucine Indica ) is also available in south India. The discovery of Ragi and headrests at Hallur has led Nagaraja Rao to postulate contacts between India and Egypt (Nagaraja Rao 1971). A series of C-14 dates shows that the beginnings of the neolithic settlements in the southern Deccan go back to the middle of the third millenium B. G. (Paddaya 1971). Allchins (1968) have outlined three phases of the neolithic in South India. Of these the earliest is characterised by a ground stone-axe industry, a rudimentary blade-flake tradition and the hand-made grey ware. The people had domesticated cattle, sheep and goats. This phase is represented at Utnur, Lower Neolithic at Piklihal, Maski I and partly Brahmagiri I and is dated to Circa 2300-1800 B. C. In the second phase (Circa 1800-1500 B. C.) there is a marked increase in the blade industry and bronze and copper objects also appear. This phase is represented at Piklihal, (Upper Neolithic), Brahmagiri IA and IB, Sangankal I, Tekkalkota I, Hallur II. The third phase (*1400-1050 B. C.) is marked by the increase of copper tools, although the stone-axe and blade industries also continue. A black on red painted pottery akin to the Jorwe ware occurs in this phase. This phase is represented at Hallur (layers 8-9), Tekkalkota II and Paiyampalli. The grey ware from the neolithic sites, accor- ding to Allchin, is similar to that from Hissar and Shah Tepe in north-eastern Iran. He is therefore inclined to derive the southern Neolithic from West Asia (Allchin 1963). Recent excavations in Bihar have revealed the existence of a rich neolithic culture in that area. The excavations at Sonepur (Dist. Gaya) and Uriup (Dist. Bhagalpur) had yielded a mixed assemblage which indicates the possibility of a full fledged neolithic in Bihar. It is further confirmed by the excavations at Chirand (Dist. Saran) (Narain 1970). Although excavations have not been carried out on a large scale, the remains of a few houses,</page><page sequence="10">50 M . K. Dhavalikar circular on plan and admeasuring 2 m. in diameter have been uncovered. They had well plastered floors and the walls were wattle and daub constructions. The thatched roof above was conical. A few pit-dwellings have also been found. A cluster of ovens have also been discovered. For subsistence the earliest colonizers of Bihar depended on farming and hunting. They cultivated rice, wheat and mung. The grain was stored in silos. But hunting possibly supplied a major part of their diet. A large variety of stone and bone tools have been found in the excavations. The stone-tool-outfit consists of blades of chert and chalcedony but the bone tools constitute the distinguishing feature of the Bihar neolithic (Verma 1971). Among these are picks, chisels, hammers, daggers, bar celts, shaft straigh- tners, scrapers, needles, bodkins and drills, and arrow-heads both tanged and socketed. This certainly is a most impressive repertoire of bone tools and it is therefore necessary to search for their origins in the Chhota Nagpur region. The pottery, grey, black and the black-and-red is mostly handmade or fashioned on a tournette. Many pots are treated with red ochre and interesting applique designs. The forms such as the lipped and spouted bowls recall those from the southern Neolithic. Clay figures of birds and animals have been found. But the most interesting are the Naga figurines which are strikingly similar to those from the early historical levels of several sites in Bihar. The origins of the naga cult in Bihar may therefore go back to the neolithic times. The radio carbon dates show that the culture can be dated to the first half of second millenium B. C. Kashmir The interesting discoveries made at Burzahom (Dist. Srinagar) are of far-reaching importance and have added a new culture zone to the Indian Neolithic. The site was subjected to a small- scale excavation in the late thirties by de Terra and Paterson and was again excavated from 1960 by Khajanchi (Pande 1970). The excavations have brought to light four cultural periods of which the first two are neolithic. The first inhabitants of the Neolithic (Period IA) lived in dwellings either circular or rectangular on plan.</page><page sequence="11">Archaeological Excavations 51 The circular pits dug into the hard compact loess, were narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. The largest among these was 2 -78 m. at the top and 4-57 m at the bottom in diameter. Some of them were used as storage pits. The walls of the dwelling pits were plastered with mud. Steps were also cut into the soil for getting into the pit. Two pits were found to have been joined by means of an arched corridor. On the periphery of the pits were noticed post-holes supporting the roof which possibly was of birch, the remains of which have been found in some of the pits. The square dwelling-pits were shallower than the circular ones. They had drains on all the four sides and had, in the center, ovens made of stones. Such ovens were found around the top of the circular pits. This suggests that cooking was done outside also. The neolithic pottery of Burzahom is handmade and was built by the coil method, and usually has mat impressions on the base. The people used a large variety of stone and bone tools. Among the former, there are polished stone axes, harvesters, polishers, pounders, chisels and mace-heads etc. The bone tools are beautifully fashioned; they comprise of knives, points, needles, barbed harpoons etc. The bone industry is extremely rich and has no parallel elsewhere in the country except in Bihar. Mud structures and mud and rubble structures occur in the levels of Phase II. A rectangular structure of stone slabs was found to be filled in with sand ; on one of the slabs was carved a unique hunting scene which portrayed a couple hunting a stag with bow and arrow (Pande 1972). The stone and the bone tools of this phase are similar to those of the preceding phase. The pottery too is similar but is highly burnished. The human and animal burials constitute the distinguishing feature of this phase. Human burials are both primary and secon- dary. In the former the entire skeleton with head towards northeast or southeast was placed in a pit the sides of which were plastered with chunam. Grave-goods was conspicuously absent except in a solitary case where carnelian beads were found. In the secondary burials bones, mostly long ones which were collected later, were treated with red ochre and placed in a pit. All the burials both primary and secondary, were found within the habitation area (Sharma 1967).</page><page sequence="12">52 M. K. Dhavalïkar The animal burials contained the remains of wild dogs, wolves, barasingha and the Himalayan ibex both articulated and incomplete skeletons. The third phase is characterised by megalithic burials which are of the menhir type. It is noteworthy that there is an overlap between the neolithic and megalithic at Burzahom. The final phase of occupation is dated to 3rd-4th cent. A. D. ' Chalcolithic Cultures The discovery of the chalcolithic phase in the prehistory of central and western India was indeed epoch making. The first chalcolithic site was discovered at Jorwe ( Dist. Ahmednagar, Maharashtra ) in 1947 and since then chalcolithic cultures have been brought to light in central and western India which flou- rished during the second millennium. B. C. Kayatha Chronologically the Kayatha culture is the earliest among the chalcolithic cultures of central and western India. Kayatha ( Dist. Ujjain, M. P. ) is an extremely important site inasmuch as it takes back the antiquity of settled life in central India to the beginning of the second millennium B. C. (Ansari &amp; Dhavalikar 1971 and Dhavalikar 1970 ). It can be identified as the ancient Kāpitthaka which was the birth-place of the celebrated astronomer of antiquity, Varahamihira. The cultural debris is divisible into five occupational periods starting from Circa 2000 B. C. and con- tinuing till 5th cent. A. D. with occasional gaps. Of these, the first three periods are chalcolithic in character. Period I ( Circa 2000-1800 B. C.) represents what has been termed as the Kayatha culture which is characterised by distinct ceramic industries such as the Kayatha ware, the red painted buff ware and the combed ware. The Kayatha ware is a chocolate or brown slipped pottery bearing paintings in purple. The red painted buff ware is repre- sented by the typical Indian lota and it is not unlikely that the ceramic may prove to be the source from which the Malwa ware was developed. The combed ware recalls thè incised pottery from Kalibangan A levels, but the latter bears incised patterns on the interior while the former has it on the exterior. Some</page><page sequence="13">Archaeological Excavations 53 pottery forms such as the bowls etc. point to the relationship with the Pre-Harappan people of Kalibangan. A number of copper bangles, two cast copper axes, two necklaces of beads of semi-pre- cious stones and thousands of micro-beads of steatite attest to the prosperity of the people. On the basis of the C-14 dates the culture can be dated to Circa 2000-1800 B. C. After the people of the Kayatha culture deserted the site, it remained unoccupied for a short while as the sterile layer would show. It was reoccupied by the people of the Ahar culture (Period II-Circa 1700-1500 B. Q. ). Besides their usual cultural equipment, the most intersting objects are a number of terracotta bull figurines, both naturalistic and highly stylized which are indicative of the ' bull cult '. Such bull figurines also occur in the succeeding Malwa period (Period III-Circa 1500-1200 B. C. ). The Ahar Culture In Rajasthan, the Indus civillization flourished in the region which is now a desert. However, it appears that climatic changes did not affect the south-eastern part of Rajastan which was quite fertile. This was the area where the Ahar culture flourished. Two important sites of this culture have been excavated viz. Ahar and Gilund both of which have been situated on the Banas river and hence the culture is also sometimes referred to as the Banasian. Of these, Ahar ( Dist. Udaipur ) was subjected to a large scale excavation by Sankalia and his colleagues ( Sankalia et al 1969 ) although it was first excavated by Agrawal ( I AR 1954-55). The most characteristic feature of this culture is the white painted black and red ware which occurs in all the three sub-phases of Period I at Ahar. Period I A also yielded the buff ware and the cream slipped ware while the stone ware continues in IB. In IG the stone ware is absent, but the black and red ware bowls develop a sharp carination at the shoulder. Large stone-and-mud houses (30 X 15 ft.) were unearthed at Ahar. Some of the spindle whorls decorated with incised patterns bear a close resemblance to those from Troy. Although a few copper tools were found stone tools were conspicuously absent and the culture has therefore been rightly classified as a copper age culture.</page><page sequence="14">54 M. K. Dhavalikar The white painted black and red ware also occurs in profusion at Gilund ( Dist. Udaipur). The cream slipped ware which appears in the lowest levels at Navda Toli, is reported from the upper levels of Gilund establishing the precedence of the Ahar culture over the Malwa culture. It should be noted that a few microlithic tools were found at Gilund ( I AR 1959-60). Gilund is the only post-Harappan chalcolithic site where the use of kiln-burnt brick has been reported. A very complex structure ( 100 X 80 ft. ) consisting of parallel walls filled in with sand was found; it has not so far been identified. Both at Ahar and Gilund large chulas probably for community cooking have been discovered. The nuclear region of the Ahar culture was south-east Rajasthan, but its peripharal arc extends into parts of Malwa as is evident from the excavations at Kayatha. The Ahar culture has been assigned on the basis of radio carbon dates, to Circa 2000- 1200 B. C. According to Agrawal ( 1966 ) the authors of the Ahar culture were the Aryans. Malwa Culture The region of Malwa has been famous throughout its chequered history for its rich fertile black soil tracts. The first farmers were possibly attracted towards this region only because of its fertile lands and abundant natural wealth. The painted pottery culture which flourished here has been labelled as the Malwa culture. The richest site of the culture is Navda Toli (Dist. West Nimar, M.P.) which is located on the southern bank of the Narmada. The chalcolithic occupation at the site has been divided into four sub-phases (Sankalia et al 1971). The characteristic black or purple on red or cream ware occurs in all the phases. Phase I yielded a white-slipped ware painted in black or vermillion and the white painted black and red ware. The latter disappears in Phase II while the black on red Jorwe ware occurs in Phase III and con- tinues in the last phase. Some of the pottery forms in the Malwa ware such as the channel-spouted bowls and footed goblets which occur in the earliest levels bear close resemblance with those from Iranian sites more particularly Sialk, and is indicative of some cul- tural contact between the two peoples. This, according to Sankalia represents the Aryan immigration from Iran into India.</page><page sequence="15">Archaeological Excavations 55 Remains of the chalcolithic cultrue have also been discovered at Maheshwar on the opposite bank (Sankalia et al 1958). Other important sites of the Malwa culture which have been excavated are Nagda (Dist. Ujjain, M. P.) (IAR 1955-56), Sagar (Dist. Sagar, M. P.), Awra (Dist. Mandasaur, M. P.) (IAR 1959-60) and Manoti (Dist. Mandasaur, M. P.) (IAR 1959-60). At Nagda mud brick houses of the Malwa culture have been found. One of the structures has been identified by the excavator as part of a bastion which shows that the habitation was fortified. At Eran too, the chalcolithic settlement was enclosed by a wide mud rampart and a moat except on the riverside (Singh 1967). The characteristic Malwa ware occurs at all these sites. The radio carbon dates, however, show that the Malwa culture (G. 1600-1200 B. C.) continued at Eran till the beginning of first millennium B. C. Jorwe Culture The Jorwe culture was first identified at Jorwe (Dist. Ahmednagar, Maharashtra), a site which was discovered by S. A. Sali and was excavated by Sankalia (Sankalia and Deo 1955). But the stratigraphical and the chronological position of the culture became clear from the excavation at Nasik (Sankalia &amp; Deo 1955). The culture is characterised by a painted black-on-red pottery represented by carina ted bowls and spouted jars associated with a coarse handmade grey ware. Explorations during the last 25 years have shown that the culture was spread all over the present state of Maharashtra except the Konkan and parts of Vidarbha. The C-14 dates indicate that it should be dated to Circa 1300-1000 B. C. In order to study the Jorwe culture in greater detail exca- vations were carried out at Nevasa (Dist. Ahmednagar Maharashtra). These early farmers of Maharashtra lived in mud houses, used the characteristic painted pottery and their tool outfit comprised a blade-flake industry of silicious material such as chalcedony. They also used copper but on a restricted scale. They buried the dead within the houses; adults were interred in an extended posi- tion within a pit while children were accommodated in two urns of grey ware placed mouth to mouth horizontally in the pit. One of the burials at Nevasa yielded a necklace of copper beads strung in a silk string. This is perhaps the earliest evidence of silk in ancient India (Sankalia et al 1960)</page><page sequence="16">56 M. K. Dhavalikar Excavations at Bahal (Dist. Dhulia, Maharashtra), situated on Girna, a tributary of the Tapi, revealed five periods of which the first is chalcolithic (IAR 1956-57). It is sub-divided into two distinct phases A and B. Of these, the former is characterised by the Malwa ware, while the latter is represented by the Jorwe culture. It is noteworthy that here the dead were not buried in the habitation area, but in a cemetary which was located on the opposite bank of the river at Tekwada. But the usual twin urn burials were conspicuously absent here ; instead the children were buried in large handmade storage jars, kept vertically in a pit. They contained black and red ware bowls, alongwith the skeletal remains. The extended skeletons here appear to belong to an earlier phase (Dhavalikar 1968-69). The excavations at Daimabad ( Dist . Ahmednagar, Maha- rashtra ) on the Pravara, stretched back the antiquity of the begi- nnings of settled life in Maharashtra to the opening of the second millennium. ( Dhavalikar 1969-70 ). It is an extensive site which was occupied only during the chalcolithic period and is therefore ideally suited for a horizontal excavation. Here, the chalcolithic strata are divisible into three different phases viz. the neolithic, the Malwa and the Jorwe. The evidence shows that the pioneering colonizers in Maharashtra were the neolithic farmers who came from the southern Deccan around 2000 B. C. They were dominated by the Malwa people around 1600 B. C. and finally the Jorwe culture flourished here from 1300-1000 B. C. A unique feature of the settlement was an earthern embankment which was built by the Jorwe people around 1300 B. G. to protect the settle- ment from river floods. The sequence at Daimabad is almost repeated at Songaon ( Dist. Poona, Maharashatra ) ( Deo 1969 ). At Chandoli ( Dist. Poona, Maharashtra ) the Jorwe culture is well represented. Noteworthy among the objects are a squarish lamp on a tall stand and an antenae hilted dagger of copper ( Deo &amp; Ansari 1965 ). It appears that the Malwa people began to infiltrate in Maharashtra long before the middle of the second millennium. This is established by the evidence from Prakash ( Dist. Dhulia, Maha- rashtra ) on Tapi where the occupation begins with the Malwa culture around 1600 B. C. and hence the chalcolithic period here</page><page sequence="17">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="18">INDIA MAP SHOWING EXCAVATED SITES 1947-1972</page><page sequence="19">Archaeological Excavations 57 is divided into two sub-phases A and B. Of these, the former is repre- sented by the Malwa culture and the latter by the Jorwe culture with an appreciable overlap in between. The occurrence of Harappan pottery in the I A levels at Prakash is indicative of the contact with the late Harappans in Saurashtra. In perioed IB is witnessed the Jorwe culture in all its glory but the ubiquitous buri- als, either extended or the urn, are conspicuously absent. It is not unlikely that as at Tekwada the cemetary was located on the other bank of river at Korat where black-and-red pottery possibly of megalithic association, has been found. The chalcoli- thic settlement at Prakash was destroyed about 1000 B. C. by a flood which is stratigraphically represented by a thick layer of sand over- lying the chalcolithic deposit. Excavation at Savalda and Bahurupa ( Dist. Dhulia, Mahara- shtra ) have yielded a distinct ceramic ware which is different in fabric, form and painted motifs from the Jorwe ware ( I AR 1959-60 ) It is characterised by a light brown to pink or buff slip which is paint, ed with stylized motifs such as peacocks, arrows, arrow-heads, flying birds etc. and therefore Sali ( 1968 ) has labelled it as the Savalda culture. At Theur ( Dist. Poona ) the chalcolithic houses of Jorwe period were enclosed within a stone circle, ( IAR 1969-70 ). The chalcolithic habitation at most of the sites in Maharashtra comes to an abrupt end around 1000 B. G. but the evidence from Inamgaon ( Dist. Poona ) shows that the Jorwe culture survived there in a poorer form till about 700 B. G. ( Sankalia et al 1972 ). The first settlers at the site were the people of the Malwa culture ( Period I-Circa 1600-1300 B. C. ) who lived in large rectangular houses of dwarf mud walls and reed screens plastered with mud. Pit-dwellings have also been found to exist side by side. The people stored the grain in pit silos lined with lime. Period II has been divided into two phases viz. Early and Late Jorwe ; the former ( Circa 1300-1000 B. C. ) was the most prosperous settlement at the site as is evident from large rectangular houses, the rich repertoire of arte- facts such as pottery, copper tools and ornaments. An embankment of rubble masonry was constructed during this period to protect the settlement from river floods ; the water thus diverted was also probably used for irrigating fields nearby. A pottery kiln of this period is a most important discovery of its kind. It looks like a B- 5</page><page sequence="20">58 M. K. Dhavalikar cauldron of clay built in situ and fired ; it was provided with a fire chamber over which were placed clay cushions with holes for the hot gas which later was channeled through the flues at the base of the kiln. The Late Jorwe phase ( Circa 1000-700 B. C. ) marks the decline of the Jorwe culture, possibly because of famine conditions ( Dhavalikar 1973 ). The poverty is attested by small circular huts, coarse painted pottery etc. Burials of all the periods have been found ; the dead were buried within the house floor. Adults were buried in pits while children were accommodated in twin urns placed mouth to mouth horizontally within the burial pit. In the Malwa levels only child-burials have been noticed ; they are betoken of the influence of the neolithic people of the southern Deccan. The site was deserted by the Late Jorwe people around 700 B. C. the cause of which cannot be ascertained. Eastern Chalcolithic Remains of chalcolithic cultures have also been found in eastern India. The excavations at Pandu Rajar Dhibi ( Dist. Burdwan, Bengal ) takes back the antiquity of Bengal to the proto- historic period. Four seasons' ( 1962-66 ) work at the site has yiel- ded a culture sequence of four periods of which the first two are chalcolithic. The earliest settlement was destroyed by floods in the Ajoy river while the second settlement was destroyed by the Iron age people of the thrid cultural period. The earliest culture is characterised by three ceramic industries viz. the hand-made grey ware with impressions of paddy husk ; a wheelmade sandy ware and the black and red ware. Also noteworthy is a fractional burial which was encountered in the lower levels of Period I. Period II is characterised by a plain and painted black and red ware, a shiny red ware painted with designs in black and a chocolate or buffish ware painted with creamish designs. The shapes include bowls, basins, channel-spouted cups, tulip shaped vases, lids, dishes, bowls on stand etc. The people of period I and II both used tools of copper and stone. Polished stone axes have also been found in the levels belonging to Period III. We have one C-14 date for a sample from period I which is dated to 1012-120 B. C. ( Dasgupta 1964).</page><page sequence="21">Archaeological Excavations 59 Excavations at Mahisdal ( Dist. Birbhum ) revealed two cul- tural periods without any break of occupation. Period I is characterised by black and red ware, plain or painted in white as well as in black, and a black painted red ware. As elsewhere, the chalcolithic people here too used copper or stone tools. The succeeding period marks the beginning of the Iron Age ( IAR, 1963-64). The Megalith Builders The neolithic culture in the South was succeeded by the megalithic which ushered in the full fledged 'iron age'. Although hundreds of megali thic burials have been found in south India nothing is known about their authors. This is, in the main, due to the relative paucity of the habitation sites of the megalith builders. Mega- , lihtic burials have been found in different parts of the country but their area of concentration is south India. Wheeler's excavations at Brahmagiri ( Dist. Chitradurg, Mysore ) in 1948 provided for the first time a firm chronological datum for megaliths (Wheeler 1947-48). They are usually frac- tional burials, except pit burials which contain extended skeletons as at Maski ( Thapar 1957 ). Megalithic monuments are of several types but there is a remarkabale uniformity so far as their contents such as pottery, and iron implements are concerned. The charac- teristic megalithic pottery is the burnished black and red ware, a red ware as also a black ware. The shapes include a variety of bowls, dishes, pedestalled cups, tulip shaped lids and conoids and pottery ring-stands. Among the iron objects are blades, daggers, knives, chisels, swords, sickles, spades, axes etc. Carnelian beads etched in white patterns are also commonly found in megalithic burials. A special mention should be made of the horse furniture such as bits, snaffles etc. All these artefacts are commonly found in south Indian megaliths. A large number of megalithic sites have so far been excavated. ( Ramachandran 1971 ). The megalithic culture of south India penetrated northward into Central India where a number of megaliths have been found around Nagpur and those at Junapani ( IAR 1961-62 ), Khapa ( Deo 1970 ) Mahurjhari ( Deo 1973 and ) Kaundinyapur ( 1968 ) have been excavated. Culturally they belong to the south Indian</page><page sequence="22">60 M. K. Dhavalikar tradition. But those in the Vindhyas ( eg. Hathinia, Dist. Varanasi U. P. ) are culturally and typologically different. They have yielded a black and red ware and microliths but iron is completely absent and as such they may be of an earlier period. The Kashmir megaliths, however, belong to the iron age. In spite of the excavations of a large number of megalithic burials, the identity of megalithic burials is still controversial. Various theories have been propounded about their origin and author- ship, but the picture is far from clear ( Banerjee 1961 ). Nonetheless, it is not unlikely that the megalithic folk of south India were possibly a Dravidian speaking people. Growth of Urbanisation The rise of cities in 6th cent. B. C. in India, more especially in the Ganga valley, can better be described as the second urbaniza- tion as the Harappan cities have precedence over them. Among the proto-historic cultures of the sub-continent all except the Indus were village cultures. It is extremely difficult to identify the causes that ultimately led to this second urbanization. Buddhist literature records the existence of 16 Mahajanapadas in 6th cent. B. C. Although many of these early city sites have been excavated, only a few have been excavated horizontally and consequently we only know the culture-sequence and not the factors that led to urbanization. North India Of the first cities in the Ganga valley, the only site which has been excavated on a fairly large scale is that of Kausambi, the capital of Vatsa. It figures quite frequently in ancient Indian literature. The site is now represented by very extensive ruins at Kosam on Yamuna, 52 miles southwest of Allahabad. It was excavated earlier by the Archaeological Survey of India but was subjected to large scale excavation by Allahabad University ( Sharma 1960, 1969). Here iron appears from the earliest period which is dated to 1165 B. C.-885 B. C. Period II ends at 605 B. G. The third occupation period marks the introduction of N. B. P. ( 605-45 B. C. ) some of which painted but curiously enough the earlier coarse P. G. W. also continues in the levels of this period. The massive rampart</page><page sequence="23">Archaeological Excavations 61 which was constructed in Period I was successively repaired and added to in Period III and IV ( 45 B. C.-580 A. D. ). It was raised and guard rooms, bastions etc. were added to it. Another subsidiary rampart was also constructed outside the first one. In the third stage of construction, a human sacrifice is belived to have been per- formed just outside the eastern gate of the rampart. The altar for the sacrifice is said to have been in the form of an eagle which was built as described in the ' Šatapatha Brāhmaņa.' According to the excavator the sacrifice was performed by the founder of the Mitra dynasty whose coins have been found at the site in large numbers. Another noteworthy discovery at Kausambi is the palace which is situated in the southwest corner of the site. It is a huge structure (315-150 m. ) built of stone set in lime mortar. It consists of a number of rooms, flanking halls and connected by a true arch. According to Sharma, it was probably built by king Udayna, a contemporary of Buddha. Technologically the structure is unique inasmuch as it shows that ashlar masonry and the true arch were known to Indians long before the advent of the Greeks and Muslims who are respectively credited with their introduction, for the palace belongs to the pre-N. B. P. levels. The discovery of the Ghoshitārāma's monastery is also equally important as it confirms that Buddhist tradition according to which the monastery was said to have been built by Ghoshita, a merchant, for Buddha. This is further confirmed by inscriptional evidence. Another site excavated on a large scale is that of Rajghat ( IAR 1957-58 onwards ) which is situated within the city of Varanasi and may therefore represent the capital of the Kashi mahãjanapada. But in spite of intensive digging we do not know much about the plan of the city and the excavation has only enabled to build a culture sequence of six periods starting from 800 B. C. to the mediaeval period. Ahichchhatra has again been excavated by Banerjee ( 1970 ), but on a small scale, and the evidence only confirms the occurrence of iron in association with P. G. W. In Bihar some important city sites have been excavated. Among them Rajgir, ancient Rajgriha, was perhaps the earliest capital of Magadha. Although it was excavated earlier, the recent work has ( IAR 1953-54 ) brought to light a mud rampart of ' New</page><page sequence="24">62 M. K. Dhavalikar Rajgriha ' which is supposed to have been built by Ajātashatru ( 491-459 B. C. ) outside the valley in which is located Old Rajgriha. Ajātashatru's successor Udayan ( 459-443 B. C. ) later shifted the capital to Pataliputra ( modern Patna ) which enjoyed the status of the Imperial capital for a long time. It is an immense site which was excavated earlier and was recently again dug by Altekar and Mishra (1959) whose work was concentrated on Kumrahar, a suburb of Patna. They have established a sequence of five cultural periods of which the first four are dated to 600 B. C.-600 A. D. after which there is a break in the occupation. The last period is assigned to the mediaeval epoch. The first Period ( 600 B. G.-150 B. C. ) is characterised by the N. B. P. while the succeeding periods roughly coincide with the Sunga ( 150 B. C.-100 A. D. ), Kushan ( 100-300 A. D. ), Gupta ( 300-600 A. D. ) and the Mughal. This culture- sequence more or less holds good for entire Bihar as the excavations at Vaishali bear out ( Deva and Mishra 1950 ). The place is associated with Mahavira who was born there. It was also sacred to the Buddhists as the Second Council was held there. It was excavated earlier but was later dug by the Archaeological Survey, by Altekar and still later by Sinha and Roy ( 1962 ) on behalf of the K. P. Jayaswal Institute. Here the culture-sequence found at Patna is repeated, but the excavations also revealed the defences which were first built about 500 B. C. and repaired later under the Sungas and the Kushans and while a moat was added to it under the Guptas. Yet the most important discovery is that of a mud stupa which has been identified with the one constructed by the Lichchhavis who, according to Buddhist texts, built it to enshrine the relics of the Buddha. In Punjab the only historical site excavated on a large scale is that of Rupar (Dist. Ambala) . It was dug solely from the point of view of exposing the Harappan and the P. G. W. levels. The historical period begins, ( Period III ) about 600 B. C. as elsewhere and ends around 200 B. C. thus covering the pre-Mauryan and the Mauryan period. Period IV covers a large span of seven centuries ( 220 B. C.-500 A. D. ) representing the Sunga, Kushan and the Gupta periods. This ¡was a formative period in Indian history and it is therefore desirable that we should be able to distinguish between the different dynastic periods culturally. Unfortunately</page><page sequence="25">Archaeological Excavations 63 this has not so far received the attention of scholars with the solitary exception of Thapar and Joshi who have attempted a rather detailed periodization of the early historical period in their excavations ' at Purana Qila, Delhi which is traditionally believed to represent the site of ancient Indraprastha ( Thapar 1972 ). At Jagatgram ( Dist. Dehra Dun, U. P. ) was found a brick built altar in the form of a garuda bird, with a large number of inscri- bed bricks which show that this was the scene of the fourth Ašvamedha sacrifice performed by a king named Šīlavarman ( Ramachandran 1953 ). Eastern India A majority of the sites excavated in Eastern India belong to the early historical period. Of these, Sisupalrgarh near Bhubane- shwar in Orissa has been identified with ancient Tosali of the Ašokan edicts and with Kalinganagara of Kharavela. The evidence from excavations shows that it was a remarkable fortified settlement, the beginning of which goes back to 4th century B. C. The fortifications were square on plan, each side a km. in length, and provided with two huge gateways at regular intervals. The settlement was planned on the chess pattern, a characteristic feature of the Greek and Roman cities. Jaugada ( Dist. Ganjam ) has also yielded evidence of forti- fication ( I AR 1956-57 ). Tamluk, Bangarh and Ghandraketugarh, all in Bengal, are historical sites but at Tamluk ( Dist. Midnapur ) there is some evi- dence to show that it was occupied even earlier in the neolithic times. ( I AR 1954-55 ) Chandraketugarh ( Dist. 24 Parganas ) was occupied in the pre-Mauryan times ( I AR 1956-57 ) while at Bangarh ( Dist. Dinajpur ) the occupation starts with the Mauryan period ( Circa 300 B. C. ). At all these sites the habitation continues upto the Pala period and horizontal excavations can therefore be expected to throw light on the town-planning and other aspects of the life of the people of eastern India. All the sites have yielded beautiful terracotta figurines in large numbers belonging to different periods. Most noteworthy among them are the Gupta terracottas from Tamluk (ancient port of Tāmralipti ). Also interesting is a unique lotus shaped tank of the Pala period at Bangarh which was originally</page><page sequence="26">64 M. K. Dhavalikar covered with a pillared canopy. A polygonal temple of the Sarva- tobhadra plan and two votive stupas, both belonging to the Gupta period have been laid bare at Chandraketugarh. In Assam, excavations at Ambari, a suburb of Gauhati, brought to light some interesting brick structures datable to 8th- 10th cent. A. D. The discovery of some lingas leads one to identify the structures as the temples of the Devas referred to by Yuan Chwang. Deep digging was difficult here because of the subsoil water, but the find of a Kushan lid shows that the beginning of the habitation may go back to the early centuries of the Christian era. ( Ansari and Dhavalikar 1971a). Central India In Central India Ujjain has been the most important city in the ancient past. Here the beginning of occupation goes back to 750 B. C. Period I ( Circa 750-500 B. C. ) is characterised by black and red ware, a solitary P. G. W. sherd and red wares associated with iron from the earliest levels. The habitation was protected by a massive mud rampart of which the extant width was 75 m and height 13 m; it was in the shape of a parallelogram. It had a moat ( 24 m wide ) around it except on the river side where it was strengthed with a caging provided with a gate-way on the north-west. Period II ( Circa 500-200 B. C. ) yielded the earlier Black and Red ware and the N. B. P. as well. Noteworthy are a number of bone arrow-heads among which one was stained with the blood of a bird, and a large tank (10-8 m. ) and a canal which was traced upto a length of 56 m. A workshop for manufacturing beads was also discovered. The third period covers a span of 1400 years (Crica 200 B. C.-1200 A. D.) during which Ujjain was a flourishing city {I AR 1955-56-57 &amp; 1964-65). Another early historical site in Central India is Maheshwar ( Dist. Nimar ) which is traditionally identified with ancient Mahismati which, according to the Puranas, was founded by king Muchukunda and was once the capital of Avanti. The habitation in the historical period here begins from 400 B. C. Period IV (Circa 400-100 B. C. ) is characterised by black and red ware as at Ujjain and the occurrence of the N. B. P. and iron. On the opposite bank</page><page sequence="27">Archaeological Excavations 65 of the river at Navda Toli, a Buddhist stupa was exposed ; some of its bricks were inscribed with characters of third century B. C. and it can therefore be assigned to Period IV of Maheshwar. Period V ( 100 B. C.-100 A. D. ) yielded some red and tan ware and Period VI is distinguished by the occurrence of the Red Polished Ware. Period VII is dated to mediaeval times. Nagda ( Dist. Ujjain ) is one site which was not deserted by the Chalcolithic people and where the habitation is continuous. Period II ( Circa 1000-700 B. C. ) is more or less a continuation of Period I and it was marked by the disappearance of the black and cream ware and structures of mud and brick. Iron objects have also been found in the levels of Period II. Period III is characterised by the N. B. P. and the sequence that follows is similar to that at other sites in M. P. Eran ( Dist. Sagar, M. P. ) identified, with ancient Airikiņa was first occupied by chalcolithic people ( Singh 1967 ). Period II, which roughly represents the Maurya and the Sunga periods, yielded the plain black and red ware and a single sherd of the N. B. P. associated with beads of semi-precious stones and a few punch- marked and tribal coins. Period III, dated to first four centuries A. D., is characterised by R. P. W. Among the coins, the most important are the coins of Ramagupta, both lion and Garuda types which are found for the first time. These together with the recently discovered images bearing inscriptions, prove the historicity of Ramagupta. An interesting seal from the levels of this period is carved with the figure of Gaja-Lakshmi and mentions the name of the town, Airikiņa. The last cultural period ( IV ) is assigned to the mediaeval times ( 1600-1800 A. D. ). Tripuri was first excavated by Dikshit ( 1952 ) and later by Sankalia and Bajpai (I AR 1965-66). According to Dikshit the first habitation at the site goes back to the chalcolithic times, but later excavations revealed a fourfold sequence ranging in date from Circa 4th century B. C. to A. D. 400. Of unusual interest is the discovery of a brass spearhead having denticulated ribs on its socket. The use of brass at such an early period ( C irca 400 A. D. ) and the denticulation are indeed rare features.</page><page sequence="28">66 M. K. Dhavalikar Western India In Gujarat, the occupation during the historical period begins around 4th century B. C. At Somnath ( Dist. Junagadh ) a massive citadel of dressed stones was built during Period ( 4th Cent. B. C.- lst cent. B. C. ) when iron also comes into use ( Mehta et al 1971 ). Period III represents the Kshatrapa-Gupta rule in Gujarat. At Nagra, however, the first occupation commenced at 7th century B. C. and continued till the mediaeval times ( Mehta 1968 ). Exca- vations at Dwaraka show that the first occupation began around the beginnings of the Christian era ( Ansari &amp; Mate 1963 ). In Maharashtra, the occupation during the historical period starts around 6th century B. C. as at Prakash ( Thapar 1964-65 ). Here the extensive remains show that it must have been a large town in the early historical period. When iron and black and red ware come into use (Period II) . Period III (200 B. C.-400 A. D. ) covers the Satavahana and the Western Kshatrapa domination over this region. The principal ceramic industry is a coarse plain red ware and in the upper levels of this period, the R. P. W. begins to occur. Period IV is dated to 400-1000 A. D. These three cultural periods are also represented at Bahal ( Dist Dhulia ) where, however, the last habitation flourished during the Mughal-Maratha period ( 1300-1600 A. D. ) ( IAR 1956-57 ). Nasik which figures in the ancient literature, was abandoned by the chalcolithic settlers around 1000 B. C.; it was occupied again in Circa 400 B. C. Period II (Circa 400 B. C.-50 A. D.) is charac- terised by the black and red ware ( Sankalia &amp; Deo 1955 ). It has been sub-divided into two sub-phases A ( 400-200 B. C. ) and B ( 200 B. C.-50 A. D. ). Of these the latter is distinguished by the occurrence of the Russet Coated ware ( Andhra ware ) and uninscribed cast coins. In period III ( 50-200 A. D. ) the R. P. W. appears. The houses uncovered in the levels of Period II had mud walls and were provided with soakage pits lined with bricks or rings while burnt bricks were used in the construction of houses of Period III. Period IV represents the occupation during the Mughal- Maratha rule. The only site which was excavated on a large scale in Maharashtra is Nevasa, (Dist. Ahmednagar), ancient Nidhivāsa.</page><page sequence="29">Archaeological Excavations 67 It has revealed more or less the same sequence of cultures as at Nasik, the only difference being that here the site was also occupied during the early historical period ( IV ) from 200 B. C. The pottery indu- stries are the same as those at Nasik. The houses had boulder foundations and burnt brick walls. Period V, styled as the Indo- Roman period ( 50 B. C.-300 A. D. ) on account of the find of the Roman amphorae, ushered in an era of prosperity at the site. The site was deserted around 300 A. D. only to be occupied in the Mughal- Maratha times. ( Sankalia et al 1960). Paunar ( Dist. Wardha ) came to be occupied during the Iron Age ( Deo &amp; Dhavalikar 1967 ). Monumental Remains Some of the sites excavated during the last 25 years have yielded remains of monuments. The most remarkable among these is the Nagarjunakonda (Dist. Guntur, Andhra Pradesh), ancient city of Vijayapuri, the captial of the Ikshvaku. ( I AR 1954-55 onwards ) . The site is an archaeologist's dream, for it was the habitat of man from early stone age to the mediaeval times. Most of the structural remains belong to the Ikshvaku period in third century A. D. Most important among them are the Buddhist stupas and vikāras, a Brahmanical temple of Pushpabhadrasvāmin, an arena for wrestling bouts or elephant fights. The site has also yielded numerous sculptures in the Amaravati style of third century A. D. The structures have now been lifted bodily and reconstructed on the hillock or else they would have been submerged under the waters of the dam on Krishna. Important relics belonging to the same complex have also been found on the other bank at Yelleshwarm ( Wahid Khan 1963 ). The stupa complex at Devni Mori ( Mehta 1966 ) was embelli- shed with terracotta statuary which betrays the lingering influence of the Gandhara art. The Buddhist establishment at Ratngiri ( Dist. Cuttack, Orissa ) have yielded a large number of exquisite sculptures of 9th-10th cent. A. D. ( Mitra 1960 ). Buddhist shrines were also discovered at Sirpur (Dist. Raipur, M. P.) ( JAR , 1953-54). The German excavations at Sonkh ( Dist. Mathura, U. P. ) have indeed been significant inasmuch as they have brought to light a number of images and art objects of the Kushan period ( Härtel 1973 ).</page><page sequence="30">68 M. K. Dhavalikar In Maharashtra a huge brick stupa was excavated at Pauni ( Dist. Bhandara ) . The original stupa was encased in subsequent times. It also had a pradakshina-patha and an elaborate stone railing with gateways in the cardinal directions. The stupa appears to have remained in worship from early third century B. C. to third century A. D. A number of beautiful stone sculptures belonging to the stupa complex were also recovered. ( Deo &amp; Joshi 1972 ). At Ter ( Dist. Osmanabad ), ancient Tagara, has been found a brick stupa ( IAR 1967-68 ), 26 m. in dia. and resembling a chakra on plan ; it had circular ribs of brick with eight spokes and four ayaka platforms and a pradakshiņā patha. On the basis of inscriptional evidence, the stupa can be dated to the first half of the first century A. D. A structural tempļe of the same period and apsidal on plan was also uncovered. A similar temple was discovered at Vidisha in M. P. ( Khare 1967 ). Epilogue The foregoing account of the evidence from excavations con- ducted during the post-independence era brings into sharp focus the achievements of Indian archaeologists. The devoted band of archaeologists trained by Sir Mortimer Wheeler and their pupils have amply shown what planned exploration can achieve in spite of the paucity of resources. The antecedents of the Harappa culture are now gradually becoming known ; we now have a fairly good idea of the decline and the end of the Indus civilization in its different metropolitan areas (Pande &amp; Ramachandran 1971). The Dark Age - the period between the end of the Indus civilization and the Early Historical period - is no more dark but is being illumined by the discovery of the chalcolithic cultures in different parts of the country, more especially in Central and Western India during the second millennium. Many aspects of the material culture of the early historical period too are coming to light. But the new dis- coveries are also creating new problems. The origins of the Indus civilization are still not clear, nor are its various stages of develop- ment. It is hard to believe that a culture remained static through several centuries and over a vast stretch of territory, and its end too needs more satisfactory documentation. The Aryans are proving as elusive as ever. The origins of the chalcolithic cultures of the second millennium are shrouded in mystery and their end too is equally</page><page sequence="31">Archaeological Excavations 69 obscure. The evidence from excavations shows a clear break in the occupation after their desertion by the chalcolithic folk at several sites in Central and Western India. This is clearly represented stratigraphically by a weathered layer at Nevasa. The chemical analysis of this layer shows arid conditions ( Mujumdar &amp; Rajaguru 1965 ). This would lead us to infer that a large scale famine may have been the cause of the desertion of the Jorwe culture sites ( Dhavalikar 1973 ). This, however, has to be confirmed by scientific analysis of weathered layers from other sites. The beginnings of the Iron Age need more careful observa- tion. Iron appears to have been introduced both in the North and South around 1000 B. C. This can in no way be taken to imply that the full fledged Iron Age had ushered in by that date. The advent of the Iron Age and the second urbanization have been usually believed to have synchronised, and the beginnings of both have been placed in 6th cent. B. C. which marks the commencement of the early historic period. But there is every possibility of the ushering in of the Iron Age at a still earlier date whereas the second urbaniza- tion, as the recent penetrating study of Ghosh ( 1973 ) shows, takes place much later even in north India and later still in other parts of the country. His masterly analysis shows that " the Harappan urbanization could not have even remotely produced or inspired the historical urbanizm, for the simple reason that there is no percep- tible link between the Harappan and later Indian cultures " ( Ghosh 1973 : 85 ). He further observes : " Any motivating foreign influence can be easily ruled out as it could not have come from any quarter. In building their cities in the early historical period the people were writing on a clean slate, with no Harappan nor any other mark on it." (Ghosh 1973 : 89). At most of the sites in north India, the most formative period which covers a span of nearly eight centuries is usually lumped together and labelled as the ' Sunga-Kushan-Gupta ' period. This is, in the main due, to the fact that the archaeologists have so far concentrated their attention on the cultures of the pre-N. B. P. period. Now that we have a clear culture sequence for north from O. C. P. onwards, it is high time that archaeologists devote their attention also to the historical period and try to define the cultural characteristics of the Sunga, Kushan and the Gupta period. Even</page><page sequence="32">70 M. K. Dhavalikar in Central and Western India and in the Deccan, archaeology of the historical period has not received the attention it merits. Planning for Future Our excavations during the last 25 years have now enabled us to build up a cultural sequence for each region of the country as a result of vertical excavations. The crying need of the hour now is large scale horizontal excavations, more especially at single culture sites not only of the protohistoric period but also of the historical period. Our horizontal excavations at Inamgaon have brought to light many new aspects of the chalcolithic habitation and we are sure that any such carefully planned and meticulously executed work elsewhere is bound to be rewarding. This is all the more necessary for the O. C. P. and the P. G. W. sites in north. Even a city like Ahichchhatra deserves a large scale excavation in order to understand the origin and growth of urbanization. For mediaeval city sites, Dr R. N. Mehta has now shown how fruitfully it can be done within restricted amount of time and money by his clearance operations at Chapaner in Gujarat ( IAR 1970-71 &amp; 1971-72 ). The country is inordinately rich in sites of every description ; they await the spade of the thoughtful archaeologist. With proper planning, close collaboration not only between universities and other research institutions, but also with governmental agencies, we can present a much clearer picture of the glorious past of the country in all its kalaedioscopic variety at the time of the golden jubilee of our Independence, for " Archaeology in India, " in the words of Sir Mortimer Wheeler " is blest with a wealth and variety of material unsurpassed elsewhere in the world."
