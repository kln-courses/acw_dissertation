If you want a better understanding of the Gulf War and Operation Desert Storm, read the nineteen papers in Betty Glad's excellent collection. The book is not about the Gulf War, however; it was published before the event. The papers prepared for this volume were intended to explore in general the interaction between political and psychological factors bearing upon war-making policy decisions. The authors bring us up-to-date on empirical research about the many nonrational and irrational aspects of behavior associated with warfare and, in so doing, happen to provide us with insights into how it went in the Gulf and how it goes in wars generally. Since the president is, in contemporary practice, the principal decision maker about U.S. entry into war, this is a book for him and his staff. In fact, the conduct of Desert</page><page sequence="2">414 I PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY Storm suggests that a great deal of the behavioral knowledge in Glad's collection may already have been applied by the president and the Pentagon's principals The cumulative effect of the papers is to add balance to inquiry in this field. Without trying to give rationality a bad name (Would that people making war policies were more rational!), the Glad volume, because its behavioral concepts, data, and assessments are well-grounded, demonstrates that we need to continue to look closely at the irrational and nonrational in behavior related to wars between states, for example, the cognitive processes, the ego-defensive characteristics, and the emo tions of those who make policy as well as those who fight the battles. The quest for knowledge about how people feel, think, and decide war matters has been mainly in the hands of philosophers, political scientists, and military strate gists, whose assumptions, intuitions, and visions have often been influential far beyond their empirical merit. This is particularly true of their prevailing assumption of rationality in war-making decisions. There are the rationalists (who prefer to be called realists): the Hans J. Morgenthaus and Henry Kissingers who assume that the state (an anthropomorphism) acts rationally in its self-interest and makes war ratio nally to maintain balances-of-power. In recent decades, military strategists, usually fascinated by the rationality and controllability assumed in the theory of games of strategy, have enthusiastically applied game theory to the design of military strategies. Political psychologists have now begun to take a greater part in this inquiry. They do so with substantial skill in hypothesis testing, theory building, and data collection. Betty Glad's contributors tell us about that literature and report their own findings as well. The papers are organized into three groups: factors that play into the psycholog ical causes of war; behavior found in the processes of conventional war; and psycholog ical considerations with respect to nuclear war. Glad's concluding chapter is an assessment of how socio-psychological findings may contribute to the limiting of wars in the future; Glad considers a world entirely without major war as a realistic dream. Part I examines the biological, cultural, and related psychological motives that predispose human beings to go to war with each other. Among its generalizations is one that dismisses, for lack of evidence, the hypothesis that there exists a human instinct for aggression. Instead, there appears to be a latent disposition to attack in reaction to adverse stimuli, and this is a disposition that can be modified and masked by learning. Another author describes the human fascination with apocalypses and the widely held belief that destruction, as caused by wars, is a positive force for cleansing and renewal. Another line of inquiry demonstrates how human beings need outside groups and enemies against which to define themselves and enhance the cohesion of their own group. This section includes a particularly fascinating analysis of the psychological assumptions and consequences of the use of the domino theory in explaining the policy decisions of the Vietnam War. Regarding the proximate causes of war, this set of papers describes the difficulties that decision makers have in making rational choices and managing crises. Anatol Rapoport's paper shows how the rationality made accessible to decision makers by</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS | 415 game theory may be negated by the necessity to apply ethical norms and subjective factors in making real-world choices. Another author indicates how the emotional stress on national leaders in moments of high crisis may limit their ability to make rational calculations, with particular risk that they will screen out relevant informa tion. Also treated are some of the idiosyncratic personality characteristics that influ ence leaders' decisions to go to war; the comparison made is between Kaiser Wilhelm and Adoph Hitler. Part II deals with several processes common to conventional wars, for example, the impact of combat on leaders, fighters, and civilians, the problems of maintaining political and military control during limited wars, and the kinds of learning on the part of policy makers that may take place from one war to the next. Contemporary limited wars present a profound dilemma: the need to limit the weapons used and the kinds of targets struck on the one hand and, on the other hand, the tendency for certain battlefield and domestic political pressures to reinforce leaders' psychological incentives to escalate the fighting. In the midst of a war, even a losing one, as cognitive dissonance theory explains, decision makers are apt to want to keep the war going out of a need to justify their earlier decisions. One of the papers de scribes how men have to be trained and psychologically reinforced in order to fight and possibly die on the battlefield. The different, and sometimes surprising, conse quences of aerial bombardment on enemy morale is surveyed, as are the psychological shifts necessary when leaders at war with each other must face the negotiation of a settlement. Part III focuses on the special case of strategies for nuclear wars. Deterrence theory, as the basis for the principal American strategy, has been rife with untestable assumptions about readiness for destruction of self as well as the enemy, about perceptions and misperceptions of the thinking of the adversary party, about the moral issues involved, and about the ability to control a nuclear war. The psycholog ical aspects of each of these assumptions are thoroughly clarified. Betty Glad's look into the future is realistic and cautiously hopeful. The realistic part: "Decisions to go to war ... are not simply rooted in competing national interests and/or the existence of competing ideologies. Because these choices are more deeply rooted in human organizational forms and psychological proclivities, one cannot simply assume that with changes in technology and the disappearance of certain ideological differences a whole new era will be attained." The hopeful part: Mikhail Gorbachev's intuitive adoption of GRIT (gradual reduction of international tension) and tit-for-tat policies. In the early 1960s, psychol ogist Charles Osgood first proposed the GRIT strategy whereby one party unilaterally and repeatedly reduces arms and retreats from aggressive postures in order to induce a relationship of trust with the adversary. President Kennedy gave GRIT a tentative trial, but Gorbachev pursued it relentlessly, until American policy makers began to take him at his word. Growing trust was reinforced by Gorbachev's many concessions to American positions during specific negotiations, an application of the tit-for-tat approach developed by such students of bargaining psychology as Robert Axelrod. Add to the good news the many recent Soviet-American collaborations in interna tional confidence building measures, rule making for future competition in world</page><page sequence="4">416 I PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY affair, and concern for screening out "madmen" from positions of war-making power. The sum points to a positive role for political psychology in future efforts to reduce the dimensions of war. Ralph M.
