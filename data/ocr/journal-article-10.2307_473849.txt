<plain_text><page sequence="1">MYTH IN QUEVEDO: THE SERIOUS AND THE BURLESQUE IN THE APOLLO AND DAPHNE POEMS' N his poems about Apollo and Daphne, Francisco de Quevedo evokes two contradictory scenes, the cosmic and the comic, the serious love story and the slapstick fable. While in a poem in quintillas he gives us the celestial world of a grave courtier, in two sonnets he creates a stage for his linguistic extravagances and savage burlesque. In this use of the serious and the comic, Quevedo reveals the topos of spoudogeloion, the mixture of jest and earnest, which goes back as far as Homer where humor enters the epic genre. Homer treats the ancient gods majestically and, moments later, mocks their scandalous adventures as when He- phaestus surprises his wife Aphrodite in the arms of Ares. Sim- ilarly, Quevedo portrays a serious Apollo and Daphne in the quin- tillas while in the sonnets these figures become objects of ridicule. In both treatments, Quevedo introduces elements of the grotesque, a literary mode which appears frequently in his work. In the quin- tillas, the grotesque is one more aspect in a picture of cosmic convulsion; in the sonnets, it is used as the chief means of derision. As for his focus, Quevedo often treats the same topic in both earnest and jest. The solemn ascetic and worshiper of ideal beauty can also be playful or attack with all the verbal wizardry of con- ceptismo, bringing out an amusing, if often sinister, armory of linguistic and imagistic monsters, vulgarisms and flashy germania. 'In order to conform to space requirements of this review, I have eliminated my discussion of Quevedo's second version of the Daphne sonnet, shortened several sections and done away with most of the notes. These will appear in my forthcoming book, Love, Agon and the Grotesque in Apollo and Daphne. Six Treatments of a Myth. 499</page><page sequence="2">500 Mary E. Barnard HR, 52 (1984) Thus, in dealing with religion, myth, love, Quevedo strikes a double posture. At one moment he praises; the next he darts around the table to write satire and burlesque (often with models in Greek Anthology lampoons and Latin satire), or simply to indulge in pure wit and fun. So his writing of lofty religious tracts does not prevent him from dealing irreverently with the sacred, his serious ballads on traditional themes have their comic counterparts in bantering romances like the "Pavura de los Condes de Carrion," and his glorious sonnets of idealized love to Lisi are matched by vicious verses mocking women and love. We see the double mask, for instance, in the corrosive "Rostro de blanca nieve, fondo en grajo," where repulsive scatology mingles with and debases the courtly commonplaces which in serious moments Quevedo delights in. Quevedo's humorous use of myth is both a parody of a tradition (which in the Golden Age reveals every kind of mythological con- trivance) and a means of playing with the gods for comic effect as Ovid and Lucian had done before him. Since Quevedo mocks the tradition in which he indulges, the very story he elsewhere treats seriously, his comic excursions into myth emerge as self- parody. A revealing example of such parody-with a large dose of play-are his sonnets on Apollo and Daphne. The myth of Apollo and Daphne is one of the most popular in the mythological tradition in Spain. Along with other ancient tales of love-Hero and Leander, Pyramus and Thisbe, Venus and Adonis-the story of the fugitive nymph and the scorned Olympian holds a special fascination for Golden Age poets, especially for petrarquistas, who use the myth as an eloquent statement of the longing for unattainable love and the suffering of the rejected lover. As is the case with other mythical personages in the Golden Age, Apollo and Daphne are not quite restored to their ancient form after their Christian eclipse in the Middle Ages. Rather, Golden Age authors make them conform to their own poetic idiom, dressing them in contemporary garb paralleling, as it were, the practice of many painters of the age, whose iconography of the gods betrays the taste of their times: resplendent Venuses in Re- naissance finery and gallant Marses in courtly armor; naked, dis- torted Mannerist Daphnes or frightened, dynamic Baroque nymphs. Seventeenth-century painters treated the gods seriously and often ridiculed them as in Velazquez' portraits of Mars as an unheroic weakling and of Bacchus as a drunkard. So too in Quevedo-who</page><page sequence="3">Myth in Quevedo 501 goes much further than Velazquez' mild ridicule-the serious mythological lovers of the quintillas give way in the sonnets to lowly figures, a god apicarado and a prostitute. The Christian read- ing of myth does not disappear with the coming of the Golden Age and, as will be seen later, even Quevedo makes use of it. Quevedo's serious version of Apollo and Daphne is one of his early poems, published by Pedro Espinosa in the Flores de poetas ilustres (Valladolid, 1605).2 The tale comes from Ovid's Metamor- phoses (I, 452-567), but Quevedo keeps only the barest outline of the Ovidian story and focuses on the chase and the transformation, endowing both with new form and meaning. Ovid himself was not a mere recorder of myths but an urbane poet who manipulated mythological material with a freedom of invention and imagination emulated, in turn, by Quevedo and many of his fellow poets. Ovid's Apollo and Daphne is a seriocomic tale of unrequited love in which an overly anxious lover is duped by an excessively modest virgin, who escapes through transformation. Ovid depicts Daphne seri- ously, but his treatment of Apollo is one of ironic detachment and subtle mockery. The Latin poet degrades the arrogant Olympian converting him into a human, fatuous lover. The chase is the high point in his humorous treatment. We have a vision of a silly god wooing his elusive lady on the run, a picture of gallantry mixed with foolishness, pomposity with self-pity (11. 504-24). Ovid's Apollo carries the stamp of the erotic persona of his love poems, of that suffering creature with touches of the ludicrous, which has given the Augustan the dubious title of debaser of elegiac erotic con- ventions. In like manner, Quevedo, also a love poet, creates an Apollo who resembles the lover of his amorous verses. So the Ovidian foolishness is cast out in favor of exquisite self-pity, in- flated and tinged with pathos, making Phoebus-Apollo a figure fully at home in his courtly setting. (In the sonnets, as will be seen later, it is precisely this foolishness which is retained and exaggerated in making a burlesque of the god.) In the serious version of the quintillas, the rejected, despondent suitor is teamed with his counterpart, the cruel, disdainful lady of perfect beauty and chastity, and both carry out their own conventional roles in an atmosphere of pagan animism and Neoplatonic undercurrents. 2 In Jose Manuel Blecua's edition, Obra poetica (Madrid, 1969), I, 409-12. All quotes from Quevedo's poetry will come from this anthology; Vol. II was published in 1970 and Vol. III in 1971.</page><page sequence="4">502 Mary E. Barnard HR, 52 (1984) The poem starts in medias res with the sun-god Apollo chasing Daphne, beautiful as the dawn: Delante del Sol venia corriendo Dafne, doncella de extremada gallardia, y en ir delante tan bella nueva aurora parecia. (ll. 1-5) Quevedo refers to Apollo as Sol, which is the key to the elaboration of solar and stellar imagery central to the poem. Quevedo also establishes the atmosphere of animistic reality which prevails throughout the poem by presenting the pursuit along the lines of a solar myth, of the Sun chasing Dawn. Quevedo removes Apollo and Daphne from the ground-the nymph metaphorically-and sets the celestial tone for his cosmological explorations. In her radiance Daphne is a star-"corre la estrella" (1. 27)- and, because of her resplendent beauty, the courtly Sol, in typical overpraise of his courtly beloved, calls her the sun and its light: Si el Sol y luz aborreces, huye tu misma de ti (11. 44-45) Again an element of solar myth appears as Daphne is linked to the night running away from the sun: si no fueras tan hermosa, por la Noche te tuviera. (11. 49-50) Only her beauty, shining in courtly splendor, saves her from ac- tually becoming the night. These associations of Daphne with sun, star, and night place her metaphorically in a celestial landscape which is discordant because of the central, disruptive figure of the lover Sol who, like all traditional lovers, burning and teary, ex- periences love as a living death (1. 43), his heart typically imprisoned in the beloved (1. 64). The notion of Sol causing havoc rests on a familiar cosmological theory current in Quevedo's time. Ptolemaic and Neoplatonic, this traditional world picture is based on a fixed system of hierarchies revealing the interdependence and unity of all creation. The uni- verse is an enormous sphere with Earth at its center and the Primum Mobile at its outer rim. In the middle is the region of the four elements-earth, water, air, and fire-which make up man and everything inhabiting the Earth. Surrounding this sub-</page><page sequence="5">Myth in Quevedo 503 lunar realm are the celestial spheres of the seven planets-the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn-and the fixed stars. And beyond the created universe is the Empyrean, the abode of God and the blessed. Central to this cosmological vision is a ladder of creation stretching from God to the lowest inanimate things. It traverses the spiritual world of the angels, the celestial spheres of the planets and the region of the four elements, to man, animals and the inanimate. In this world picture, human affairs are intimately linked with the doings in the cosmos: human transgressions or heavenly disorder bring about chaos in the whole of creation. Quevedo not only makes his poem fit into a current cosmological scheme but also manages to create his own mythological imagery, bringing originality to a theme elaborated again and again and often as a hackneyed convention. By an anthropomorphic act, the planet Sol, which illumines the universal sphere (11. 48, 85), becomes the lover and descends to the sublunar world of the elements. But instead of fitting into the established order of Nature, he becomes a man ruled by earthly passion. Order collapses. The havoc of desire leads to chaos. Like the evil planets in Ulysses' famous speech on degrees in Shake- speare's Troilus and Cressida (Act I, scene iii), Quevedo's Sol to "disorder wander[s]" and, as in that well-known speech, "raging" and "commotion" ensue. We see how air and water are disturbed and join Sol in cosmic convulsion: El Sol corre por seguilla; por huir corre la estrella; corre el ilanto por no vella; corre el aire por oilla, y el rio por socorrella. (11. 26-30) The chaos brought about by the god-turned-lover extends to the beloved as she disappears through metamorphosis into the laurel, a violation of nature which yields a grotesque. Jupiter brings about the conversion to save her from Sol, but her salvation, as in Ovid, is ambiguous, for her virginity is safeguarded at the expense of her body: Sus plantas en sola una de lauro se convirtieron; los dos brazos le crecieron, quejindose a la Fortuna con el riiido que hicieron.</page><page sequence="6">504 Mary E. Barnard HR, 52 (1984) Escondi6se en la corteza la nieve del pecho helado, y la flor de su belleza dej6 en la flor un traslado que al lauro presta riqueza. (11. 71-80) Quevedo contrives a transformation which contains a faint echo of Ovid's version, as Daphne's beauty lingers on and becomes part of the newly born laurel. Otherwise it is different from Ovid's smooth conversion, which gives the nymph a protective citadel for her virginity: . . . torpor gravis occupat artus, mollia cinguntur tenui praecordia libro, in frondem crines, in ramos bracchia crescunt, pes modo tam velox pigris radicibus haeret, ora cacumen habet: remanet nitor unus in illa. (11. 548-52)3 The grotesque in this scene emerges (in Wolfgang Kayser's familiar terms) as the uncanny and alien erupt and subvert the familiar world: the incongruous, gradual dissolution of the human body by the emerging laurel.4 In its estrangement from the normal order, the transformation arouses a sense of dislocation and disquiet. The hybrid clash and the distortion of the human by the plant in Ovid are aspects which are also found in Quevedo's grotesque. But in Quevedo there is a heightening of the sense of abnormality and alienation from order which are ideally suited to the theme of universal chaos and the collapse of a world developed in the quin- tillas. In Ovid the notion of metempsychosis provides a background mitigating the ominous grotesquerie of dehumanization: the reader knows that the metamorphosis is the means by which the nymph acquires a new form and so preserves her identity as a virgin. In Quevedo, the absence of the ancient notion of the transmigration of souls intensifies the grotesque effect. Furthermore, unlike Ovid's smooth rendition, the quintillas contain an element of violence: as the maiden's arms become branches of laurel, there is an explosion of sound and a lamenting cry to Fortune as if in protest to the 3 Metamorphoses, ed. M. Haupt et al., revised by M. von Albrecht (Ziirich and Dublin, 1966), p. 63. 4 For further details on the grotesque of Daphne's transformation in Ovid as well as in Garcilaso, who provided the most remarkable of Golden Age transfor- mations of the nymph and the most copied, see my article, "The Grotesque and the Courtly in Garcilaso's Apollo and Daphne," RR, 72 (1981), 253-73.</page><page sequence="7">Myth in Quevedo 505 violation. The presence of Fortune fits perfectly into this world in which the "center cannot hold," for in her fickle and restless guise, this figure is traditionally identified with "chance." Reigning over the domain of haphazard and capricious forces, she brings about adversity and disorder. Sol, the perpetrator of this disorder, is himself its victim. For after Daphne disappears through metamorphosis into the laurel, the god is transformed in elemental subversion as his rays of light and fire become fountains of water: los rayos de luz y fuego desat6 en amargas fuentes. (11. 89-90) This fire-water image, like the un-Ovidian rain of tears of Gar- cilaso's Apollo in Sonnet xIII, is emblematic of the god's pain and lament for his loss. Fire turning to water also points to the total downfall of Sol as lover. In a clever play of images, Quevedo uses the heat and fire of Sol (his physical attributes as an astral body) as signs of his passion (encendido querer, 1. 57; abrazos ardientes, 1. 86)-that conventional motif of the fire of love which Quevedo uses repeatedly in his poetry. And so, when Sol's fire is extinguished, the lover also dissolves. Daphne as the tree remains recalcitrant as she was in her human form-an Ovidian motif-and air and water reappear to serve as a teary, lamenting chorus to the poet's eulogy of the woman who gave up her body to preserve her chastity. Sol is left behind and not mentioned in the last three quintillas. As if tainted by his appetite, he has been ostracized. Note that there is no open condemnation of the god here; he simply fades away. This is perhaps a concession by the courtly Quevedo who is, like Sol, an excluded lover and, in this sense, identifies with the god. The silence of Sol, the carrier of passion, permits Quevedo a Christian resolution to the poem. And if the courtly poet appro- priately fails to openly condemn the lover in his passion, now the Christian moralist has nothing but praise for the beloved in her virtue. In Ovid, Daphne flees from the lover to keep her identity as a virgin huntress, to be like Diana, the chaste goddess of the hunt, whose father had bestowed upon her perpetual virginity. In Quevedo, pagan maidenhood becomes Christian purity; the Que- vedian nymph runs to safeguard her honestidad. So at the end of the poem Daphne, like Dante's Beatrice, evolves from an object</page><page sequence="8">506 Mary E. Barnard HR, 52 (1984) of sensual love to something of a saint as the river kisses the "foot" of the tree characterized as divino y santo (1. 105). By using the term pie for the tree's roots, the gesture is not only an act of homage but points to the tree as a monument, an arboreal statue of Daphne, which recalls Petrarch's idol sculpted in living laurel in the Canzoniere (xxx, 27). This is an expression of Petrarch's quasi-religious reverence for Laura who, as the anti-type of Daphne, is not only a woman of perfect beauty but also of perfect chastity. There is a stronger reminiscence here, however. The use of the epithets divine and saintly in praise of the virginal tree puts the poem in the tradition of Christian allegory of ancient myth, which found moral and theological teachings beneath the "veil" of the classical fables. The Church Fathers had placed Daphne among the purest of virgins-a notion which is developed by Ovid's me- dieval commentators, who make the laurel a symbol of chastity worn by virgins in heaven as a reward for their virtue and even identify it as an emblem of the Virgin Mary herself. As we know, the Golden Age welcomes this reconciliation of Greco-Roman my- thology (the fingimientos de los poetas) with Christian values and exploits it to the fullest. The fusion of the pagan and the Christian is, of course, dear to the young Quevedo, a disciple of the Flemish Neostoic Justus Lipsius, whose Christian exegesis of pagan texts influenced our poet as evidenced in his Anacreon castellano and in his translation of the pseudo-Phocylides. Both works were dedicated to the Duke of Osuna in 1609. Later in the Marco Bruto (1644), Quevedo allegorizes the myth of Apollo and Daphne including the typical explanation of the laurel as a reward for honestidad. The last lines of the poem restore a kind of order as Daphne/ tree becomes part of the natural world. Nature goes out of her way to protect her: Y viendo caso tan tierno, digno de renombre eterno, la reservo, en aquel liano, de sus rayos el verano, y de su yelo el invierno. (11. 106-10) In this passage rayos may refer both to the scorching rays of the sun and to lightning. The notions that the laurel will not be harmed by lightning (Pliny, Natural History, xv.xl.135) and that it will always retain its evergreen freshness go back to ancient lore. Later elaborated by medieval writers, these notions pass on into Re-</page><page sequence="9">Myth in Quevedo 507 naissance mythography. In Ovid, it is Apollo himself who, in his paean to Daphne, promises the maiden the eternal evergreen youth of the laurel. Here, however, Quevedo reserves the final apotheosis for Nature since it would not seem fitting that Apollo, who had disrupted its order, be assigned to restore it. In a final act of redemption, Nature singles out for a special reward one whose quest for purity had led to a violation of her natural integrity. Combining pagan ideas of Nature and Christian hope, Quevedo saves Daphne, her life and chastity, as a saintly tree. In the sublunar world of the four elements, Daphne represents elemental earth, for, in becoming the tree, the nymph is not only forever encased in eternal Mother Earth but, in a sense, she is part of that Earth. In human form Daphne is identified meta- phorically with fire and water in celebration of her beauty: Sol converts her golden hair into fiery rays (11. 81-85), and her white breasts are like snow (1. 77), which is a sign of her fairness and also of her cold, passionless posture. But in becoming the laurel, the nymph joins the earth-in ancient myth her mother was Gaia, the Earth-and leaves her body behind, which had brought her into the realms of water and fire. In her transformation, she ex- cludes the other elements forever, those in herself and those ex- ternal to her, especially Sol, who is associated with fire, with wa- ter-his tears-and with air as he becomes all movement and competes with the wind while running after the maiden: con el viento que las lleva quiso parejas correr. (11. 19-20) In this war of the elements-of Daphne earth against fire, air, and water-the maiden shuns those elements above the earth and remains silent and triumphant in her leafy fortress. As the laurel, even Sol cannot touch her since summer shields her from his rays in a final exclusion. Daphne descends in triumph from dawn (as she is pictured at the beginning) to earth and from the flesh to the tree in what seems a paradoxical victory. For Sol, eminent among the planets, king of the celestial sphere and, according to a common notion, the source of fire-noblest among the elements-is defeated by the lowest element in the ladder of creation, earth. But the Chris- tian ending resolves the paradox. The planet Sol, which in its great light had even been made to stand for the glory and omnipotence</page><page sequence="10">508 Mary E. Barnard HR, 52 (1984) of the Creator, a religious topos based on pagan solar cults, tumbles anthropomorphically to the material world below the moon and defeat as appetite overtakes him. In inverse movement, Daphne, as lowly earth, is sanctified by virtue and the saintly tree is, as it were, among the blessed. The structure of Quevedo's poem is on three planes of opposites: the courtly (the typical amorosa batalla between the cruel fiera and the faithful, yet scorned lover; the fire of passion vs. the ice of the distant beloved); the cosmological (Sun vs. night; elemental fire vs. elemental earth); and the Christian (vice vs. virtue; passion vs. chastity). The warring opposites show as dramatic images of a huge, convulsive, topsy-turvy battle in which the elements are thrown into disarray, Daphne turns into a laurel, and Sol's fire becomes water. This structure of dialectical, disparate forces gen- erating discord would be regarded simply as an artifice, a construct to bring newness to a tired theme, if it were not for the fact that Quevedo's persistent elaboration of the topic of a chaotic world- of a world-upside-down-corresponds not only to an esthetic im- pulse but to a metaphysical posture as well. So the poem-a blend of ancient myth and contemporary cosmological and Christian thought-points beyond itself to what Quevedo believed existence to be: constant strife, the turbio rio of his moral poems. In a much quoted letter, Quevedo speaks of life as universal discord in words which perfectly define the turmoil in the quintillas and in much of his work, a brew of clashing polarities: Nadie jamas fue tan obedecida del mundo como la discordia: perpetuamente reina en los elementos, sin que pueda tener tregua su guerra; no consiente un instante de paz a nuestros humores; si crees a los astrologos, todo el cielo es una discordia resplandeciente: no hay estrella que no se oponga a otra, y todas militan con aspectos contrarios; con ella vivimos, della somos compuestos, a ella estamos sujetos por naturaleza.5 But there is more, for we find definite intimations of order in Quevedo's agonistic metaphysics, and one turns up in the mys- terious workings of divine Providence. In the letter, Quevedo speaks of providential order amidst the chaos: "Mucho tiene de providencia esta disensi6n, que compone, sustenta y vivifica." In the quintillas, order occurs in typical Quevedian fashion: our poet devotes little time to it and, when order comes, it is providential. It is thrust 5Epistolario completo, ed. Luis Astrana Marin (Madrid, 1946), p. 423.</page><page sequence="11">Myth in Quevedo 509 abruptly at the poem's end and it seems almost as an afterthought. This order is provided by Nature, which acts as an agent of Prov- idence, playing the role assigned to it by Quevedo in one of his Sentencias: "Nos sirve la naturaleza para nuestra conservacion de madre, como de angel custodio . . en lo temporal."6 In an age in which myth is largely regarded as a literary con- vention, myth in Quevedo curiously and ironically fulfills something of its original function: to explain the mysteries of existence. In this case, Quevedo depicts life as constant chaos in which order comes, at the last moment, in an act of Providence. II But if the courtly and Christian poet sees myth with perfect seriousness, the insolent debaser subjects it to devastating bur- lesque, that familiar irreverence with which Quevedo treats most things sacred or profane. The mythological burlesque is a popular mode which in Spain appears as the mythological tradition reaches its peak at the end of the sixteenth century. Even though old practices continue to be repeated and re-elaborated in infinite vari- ations-and at times with happy strokes of originality as in Que- vedo's serious Apollo and Daphne-more and more writers turn to parody, bringing with it new, unexpected scenes to the world of mythology. It is a commonplace to speak of the mythological burlesque simply as an attack against the abuses of the tradition, a debunking by those who were growing tired of it. But the myth- ological burlesque, with its clever, nimble humor, is less a revolt against old formulas than a means of holding on to these for- mulas-at times "stretching" them, at times negating them-to create novel effects. Furthermore, the fact that many of the poets who treat myth seriously also poke fun at it-Quevedo, G6ngora, Faria e Sousa-speaks eloquently for these self-conscious artists who can detach themselves from their material not only ridiculing the fables but using them as a springboard for their esthetic games. And so the mythological burlesque, with its distortions of shapes and contortions of language, provides an ideal workshop for the ingenious tricks of the conceptist writer. This is the case with Quevedo for whom the parody of myth is a welcome opportunity 6 Sentencia 733 in Obras en prosa, ed. Luis Astrana Marin (Madrid, 1932), p. 810.</page><page sequence="12">510 Mary E. Barnard HR, 52 (1984) not only to degrade the gods with caustic, deforming humor but to display his amazing wit. In his humorous treatment of myth, Quevedo is in good com- pany. Antiquity did not always treat its gods with respect, for it subjected these hallowed figures to merciless comedy. Myth, seen with serious philosophical piety by Aeschylus, Pindar or Virgil, did not fare so well in the critical minds and skeptical urbanity of Aristophanes, Ovid or Lucian. Homer's frequent mockery of the Olympians plants the seed for future comedy, a fact which did not make it any easier for his apologists to defend him against attacks of impiety and immorality. The burlesque of myths in vase paint- ings show how widespread this practice was in ancient Greece; Aristophanes, as we know, had a field day with the gods. In the Roman world, Ovid provides the best "comedy of the gods" in his Metamorphoses, where the Olympians are subjected to his subtle wit and detached irony. Ovid's stories become a storehouse of myth for sixteenth- and seventeenth-century writers eager for material to display their classical erudition. But when these writers choose to humor the ancient tales, their comic treatment is more Ra- belaisian than Ovidian. In Quevedo, as in so many of his coun- terparts in continental and English travesties, ironic subtlety gives way to crassness, the mock-heroic to low burlesque. Quevedo mocks mythical characters often, and the planetary gods-especially Jupiter and Apollo-bear the brunt of his crude and perverse humor. These are the best known and mightiest gods, and Quevedo, a skillful marksman, knows that in comedy as in tragedy the higher they rise, the greater the fall. The planetary divinities become lowly players in a jdcara ("Mojagon, preso, ce- lebra la hermosura de su Iza," III, 334-35); Apollo and Jupiter are ready targets in a romance on love and jealousy ("Efectos del amor y los celos," III, 75); Jupiter's metamorphoses, the god's clever ploys in his sexual adventures-which Ovid had treated with malicious but mild humor-are now reduced to a "iHucho-ho!" and "ave- chucho," the laughable animalizations of an over-developed libido ("Encarece la hermosura de una moza .. .," II, 247). The burlesque of the gods, however, culminates in La hora de todos, a parody reminiscent of Lucian's Dialogues of the Gods. But Lucian's light- hearted mockery of the Olympians is worlds apart from Quevedo's vulgar farce of ruffianesque and foul-mouthed buffoons belonging to a smelly underworld. Phoebus-Apollo appears here in a ridic-</page><page sequence="13">Myth in Quevedo 511 ulously gruesome costume. He is a brass-faced, tinsel-bearded mu- sician, a death bringing planet and a comically inefficient lover, as Fortune reminds him of his failure with Daphne: "ya te he visto yo. . . correr tras una mozuela que, siendo sol, te dej6 a escuras."7 Quevedo details their adventure in the burlesque sonnets which are our concern here. Quevedo subverts Ovid's tale doubly: in his early poem in quin- tillas, he exaggerates the sentimental aspects of Apollo and yields to courtly seriousness; in his comic sonnets, he exaggerates the playful, and the result is degrading caricature. The Ovidian half- fool becomes not only a total fool but a clown as well. And not even Daphne, who had been spared Ovid's ironic barbs, escapes Quevedo's barbarous digs. The grotesque, which in the quintillas appears as a function of universal disorder, is used in the sonnets as a tool of the burlesque, as a dehumanizing, deforming device to demean and to ridicule. There is also an element of play in Quevedo's comic grotesque. The master of language and gratuitous wit cannot hide for long behind the mask of the parodist; Quevedo's distortions dazzle by their sheer visual and linguistic ingenuity, calling attention to themselves as esthetic play. So in the sonnets, the grotesque emerges both as an instrument of parody and as a literary game, an occasion for elaborating clever details-a familiar combination in Quevedo also found in his non-grotesque schemes. The salient feature in Quevedo's comic grotesque is the clash of incongruous elements, the mingling of the human and the non- human, which is also the case in the grotesque of the quintillas. But unlike the quintillas, where the disquiet of the grotesque occurs without amusement, the sonnets contain ready laughter, a reductive humor which mingles with feelings of revulsion and disgust. In Quevedo's sonnets of Apollo and Daphne, the real target of the parody is not the Ovidian tale per se (even though the Latin poet is the original model and must be taken as a reference) but the serious versions which, from Garcilaso on, convert the ancient characters into courtly figures in courtly landscapes. And so in the sonnets, the anti-mythological and the anti-Petrarchan merge, as in the many burlesques of ancient tales of love. Quevedo's poem I La hora de todos, ed.

Barnard HR, 52 (1984) in quintillas, one of many serious courtly versions, breeds its parodic counterpart in the obvious self-mockery of the sonnets: Bermejazo platero de las cumbres, a cuya luz se espulga la canalla, la ninfa Dafne, que se afufa y calla, si la quieres gozar, paga y no alumbres. Si quieres ahorrar de pesadumbres, ojo del cielo, trata de compralla: en confites gast6 Marte la malla, y la espada en pasteles y en azumbres. Volvi6se en bolsa J6piter severo; levant6se las faldas la doncella por recogerle en lluvia de dinero. Astucia fue de alguna duefia estrella, que de estrella sin duefia no lo infiero: Febo, pues eres sol, sirvete de ella. (II, 18) Quevedo deforms and belittles the ancient figures imagistically through caricature and linguistically through a taunting, concep- tual language sprinkled with germanismos. His stage of fools is the low world of hustlers and prostitutes, where love is a matter of money and cunning. The poet assumes the role of a teacher of love, providing Apollo with a wicked message on the art of se- duction-pay if you want to love, an advice which rests on one of Quevedo's satirical commonplaces: to women, love and money are synonymous. The topic of dinero and dinerismo (the total supremacy of money) plays a dominant role in Quevedo, whose unmasking of the evils of money ranges from the mildly satirical, as in his early letrilla "Poderoso caballero es Don Dinero," to the darkly ominous, as in his Suenio de la Muerte, where Dinero appears as a demonic monster. But in the Apollo sonnet (and later in the Daphne), Que- vedo the moralist, concerned with exposing the folly and vice of a depraved society, is pushed into the background, leaving the way open to the outrageous humorist of time-honored literary tradi- tions. Quevedo places the god and the nymph in a corrupt under- world and then invents a shameless voice to toy perversely with them. The Apollo sonnet starts off with light images springing from the central figure of the sun-god, as in the quintillas. But this first address to the deity as bermejazo platero de las cumbres-the rubi- cundo Apolo of nobler contexts-immediately suggests that we are</page><page sequence="15">Myth in Quevedo 513 far from the splendor of courtly idealism. In this line, Quevedo dresses Apollo for comedy since bermejazo, an allusion to the color and size of the astral body and the red-gold hair of the youthful god in anthropomorphic get-up, carries a moral slur. In popular superstition, used extensively in Golden Age letters, red or blond hair is a sign of treachery and deceit. In Quevedo, Judas is always bermejo. The courtly wooer has become a crafty seducer but, as it turns out, not a very resourceful one. In its derogatory function, the superlative adjective deflates not only Sol but also the nominal phrase platero de las cumbres, which describes the god's luminosity as he shines from imperious heights. The lofty words, which might find an equally lofty place in any gongorist poem, are here ridic- ulous, particularly because of their preciosity, which jars harshly with the degrading adjective. In the second line, Sol's degradation continues by implication, for the mighty planet does not shine on worthy things but on the dregs of society. This last scene spills over into the realm of the grotesque, for Quevedo not only makes Sol reveal the canalla scornfully in all the sordid aspects of its fallen state but animalizes it since he is punning on the word, finding a dog in its first syllable can. The human merges with the animal, yielding a humorously disgusting image: dog-like, the dirty rabble picks its fleas in the sunlight. The comic distortion of the canalla, in nasty, inflated caricature, sets the tone for the perverted world of the sonnet. Damaso Alonso calls the scene "fondo goyesco, dos siglos antes que Goya, capricho dibujado en once silabas."s And yet, even if the grotesque disposes of its victim (the proper function of all successful satiric and parodic grotesques), we cannot but respond with fascination to Quevedo's fanciful contortions, to the lines that destroy but also draw ad- miration for their wild ingenuity. This is the "play-urge" in Que- vedo, here and in his best grotesques, such as the bat-like Daphne and the predatory, mechanized Apollo, both of whom we will meet later on. Daphne, like Apollo, emerges as a lowly presence. The nymph is introduced in the third line immediately after the canalla, and the reader feels that she participates in the canalla's degradation and grotesquerie. This association is brought about in a subtle way. We know that Daphne is herself part of the rabble, for the term ninfa, a reference which in ancient times defined her maid- 8 Poesia espahola (Madrid, 1971), p. 530.</page><page sequence="16">514 Mary E. Barnard HR, 52 (1984) enhood, is a germanismo meaning prostitute, and so as we read the lines "a cuya luz se espulga la canalla,/la ninfa Dafne que se afufa y calla," the fallen virgin becomes one with the flea-picking canalla. And, curiously, these lines are also connected by the in- ternal rhyme of se espulga and se afufa, which in their humorous mockery reinforce the link between the canalla and Daphne, this time phonetically. Daphne is a figure fit for one of Quevedo's jdcaras. While she silently escapes-an Ovidian reminiscence-two ger- manismos denote her low station: afufarse (to escape) and the above-mentioned ninfa (prostitute). The two terms are linked not only as part of a common jargon but by the pejorative sounds fu-fa which, linked to the afof Dafne, further degrade the woman. This repetition of ugly sounds to demean is a typical Quevedian technique, especially in his excremental poems. (Like the combi- nation fu-fa, the rhyme -alla/-ella throughout the sonnet is ir- reverent and belittling, for it parodies a prevalent rhyme in the quintillas, bringing with it an implicit mockery.) A play on words in the fourth line carries Quevedo's message to Apollo the astral seducer: paga y no alumbres. One would have expected apaga y no alumbres. By saying paga, Quevedo suggests lewdly that money is the answer, deal with the woman on her own ground, in the dark. The second quatrain conveys the message by playing on the antithetical economic terms ahorrar-comprar, which go back to pagar as the only means of catching the elusive, if easy, prey. In line six, Quevedo returns to the sky imagery of the beginning, this time degrading Phoebus by association in a take-off on the well- known scatological frase hecha by maliciously calling the giver of light who sees all, ojo del cielo-asshole of the sky. In this quick lexical parody, the poet gathers all his impatience and contempt for the god who should know better. This obscene debunking of the god is especially irreverent since Quevedo uses the heavens, Apollo's domain, in the abusive phrase. In the next lines, the argument continues, now backed by ancient authority, by Ovid, the skilled teacher of love, and by his gods, whose erotic adventures the witty sensualist tells in his Meta- morphoses and uses as exempla in the Ars Amatoria. Quevedo, no less informed than Ovid in the classical art of persuasion, intro- duces two cunning and successful lovers, Mars and Jupiter, plan- etary divinities like Phoebus, as models to copy in the sun-god's attempts at seduction. By selling his war-god accoutrements, Mars</page><page sequence="17">Myth in Quevedo 515 buys Venus confites, pasteles, and azumbres to bribe and seduce her. This recalls La hora de todos, where Quevedo has the love goddess, portrayed as a boor and a glutton, gorging herself on cakes and candy probably given her by Mars: "estaba sepultando debajo de la nariz a pufiados rosquillas y confites" (p. 224). The second model, Jupiter, supreme among the gods and obviously a lover of greater means, becomes a shower of money, which Danae quickly gathers in her skirts. (The gold of the original myth has been substituted by money, stressing the buying of the woman.) The once innocent maiden here raises her skirts in a clever image of both female greed and indelicate immodesty as she exposes herself to Jove. In this tercet, Quevedo downgrades not only Danae but Jupiter as well, for the reference to the solemn deity trans- formed into a bolsa subtly ridicules him. The sonnet ends in a clever, complex epigrammatic turn, a play on duenia and estrella to convince Phoebus that cunning is the only answer. The duplicity which Quevedo wants Apollo to assume is fittingly expressed in duplicitous language. In a note to this tercet in his edition of Quevedo's poetry, Florencio Janer observes that in Golden Age poetry and theater it is common to give the name Dueita Estrella to widows who supervised unmarried girls.' If we accept this connection between the two words, Quevedo's meaning is clear: cunning is the high mark (estrella) of a duenia and, since due~ia and estrella are inseparable (at least in literature), Phoebus as the sun, the king of the stars, must not be without a duenia. So he must buy the duenia (and her cunning) in order to get his hands on the maiden Daphne. The poem to Apollo just examined is the first of a two-part sequence in which the second part is the sonnet to Daphne. Both poems should be read together, for they constitute a unit: Quevedo's apostrophe to Apollo is counsel on how to catch the elusive Daphne; the apostrophe to Daphne is a warning on Apollo's intentions and his defeat: "Tras vos, un alquimista va corriendo, Dafne, que llaman Sol, iy vos, tan cruda? Vos os volveis murciegalo sin duda, pues vais del Sol y de la luz huyendo. 9 Vol. LXIX in the BAE (Madrid, 1953), 132.</page><page sequence="18">516 Mary E. Barnard HR, 52 (1984) "El os quiere gozar, a lo que entiendo, si os coge en esta selva tosca y ruda: su aljaba suena, esta su bolsa muda; el perro, pues no ladra, estai muriendo. "Buhonero de signos y planetas, viene haciendo ademanes y figuras, cargado de bochornos y cometas." Esto la dije; y en cortezas duras de laurel se ingirio contra sus tretas, y, en escabeche, el Sol se qued6 a escuras. (11, 19) The light imagery is again used to degrade. The god becomes an alchemist, the sun whose light turns things to "gold." The king of the celestial sphere "produces" the king of metals, "the sum of all metallic virtues" and alchemically a mixture of the elements in perfect proportion.10 But alchemy, a pseudo-science popular dur- ing Quevedo's times, had become a butt of jokes and, in Quevedo's works, a frequent target of satire. The treacherous platero yields to the ludicrous alchemist. Daphne, cruda in her recalcitrant escape, flees from Sol and his light. This image, which produced an encomium in the quintillas, is here a cruel, cynical put-down. The night imagery gives way to a creature of the night: Daphne is a bat, an animal given to comic treatment and popular in the grotesque. The fantastic atmosphere of the ancient tale permits the construction of this clever, ugly distortion in which the human takes on animal qualities-comical and nightmarish-bringing the poem both into the realm of the grotesque and that of black humor as well. Here Quevedo is in- dulging in a device used frequently in mythological burlesque, a creation of a ridiculous transformation where no transformation existed in the original myth. Quevedo's contemporaries in England often use this same trick. In Thomas Nashe's burlesque of Hero and Leander in his Prayse of the Red Herring (1599), for instance, the lovers are transformed into a fish called "ling" and a "Cad- wallader Herring." We may remember Quevedo's own reference to the swimmer of the Hellespont in his "Hero y Leandro en patios menores" as "aprendiz de rana" and "pescado." The second quatrain makes Apollo's less than honorable in- tentions clear, stressed by the verb coger, with its obvious sexual connotations. Apollo had not heeded Quevedo's advice, and now, 10 E. M. W. Tillyard, The Elizabethan World Picture (New York, n.d.), p. 65.</page><page sequence="19">Myth in Quevedo 517 spitefully, the poet reveals to Daphne the god's plans for her in the rugged landscape of Thessaly. Quevedo tells the girl of Apollo's threatening "sounding quiver," with its veiled phallic implications, a reference both to the sound of the god of archery as he runs with his accoutrements and to his sexual excitement. But Quevedo tells Daphne more-something which will keep the nymph running for sure: the god's money pouch is silent, no money is forthcoming. The antithesis of the "ring" of sex and the "silence" of money is a combination which in Quevedo speaks of instant failure. The notion that Apollo is not paying is reiterated in the dog image: "el perro, pues no ladra, esta muriendo." The animal imagery of Apollo as a dog is from Ovid. The Augustan uses the image to humor the god's urgencies as a victim of furor, the elegiac erotic topos of the madness of passion, which makes a frenzied Apollo run like a Gallic hound after the virgin, who is pictured as a hare. Like Ovid, Quevedo uses this animalization to degrade Phoebus in his sexual rapacity. But here there is an added meaning. In Golden Age texts, references to a dead dog frequently allude to not paying a prostitute for her services, as in Tirso's El burlador de Sevilla (II, 206) and Quevedo's "Que no me quieren bien todas, confieso."" In our sonnet, this clever animal image not only defines Apollo's stinginess but brings into focus the basic conflict of the god and the nymph in their amusing, dislocated relationship. The battle of virtue and vice in the quintillas becomes here a battle of vices: the lusty god who is not paying and the prostitute who will not relent unless she is paid. If Daphne's reasons for running are known only by implication, they are made explicit in the romance "Encarece la hermosura de una moza," where the god is again a miser and the maiden is called caranton'a, another one of Quevedo's "ninfas de daca y toma": Si la luz trujo arrastrando, como otros suelen la soga, tras Dafne el Sol, cuadrillero con mas saetas que joyas; si la corrio como liebre, y se corrio como zorra de que la dijese: "Aguarda," y no la dijese: "Toma." (11, 246) 1 See R. M. Price, "A Note on Three Satirical Sonnets of Quevedo," BHS, 40 (1963), 81-82.</page><page sequence="20">518 Mary E. Barnard HR, 52 (1984) These transparent creatures, flat in their single-mindedness, are characteristic creations of Quevedo's satirical and burlesque machinery. Like so many of Quevedo's comic characters-such as Pablos in the Buscon and the many figures that inhabit the Sueitos-they are drawn in quick strokes, exaggerated gestures and physical details which, if successful in conveying their foibles, fail to give them real substance and psychological complexity. But far from being a weakness, this two-dimensionality points to Quevedo's remarkable virtuosity as a caricaturist. And Apollo and Daphne are two of his happiest creations, belonging, as they do, to his repertoire of types. Daphne enters his gallery of dehuman- ized, filthy, greedy women-doncellas in name only. And Apollo, in his urgent chase and later in his farcical dance of the first tercet, emerges as a Quevedian lecher: that frenetic fantoche who, in the words of Amede Mas, has surrendered himself to the demon of the flesh.12 The comic distortion of the once sentimental lover of the quintillas, converting him into a sexual predator, follows a common practice in anti-Petrarchan literature. In the mockery of the traditional Petrarchan wooer, sensual love, which had coexisted in uneasy tension with idealized emotions and sublimated passion, gives way to uncontrollable lust and sexual perversion. And so it is in Quevedo's own jeering of love and the lover. In the Poema heroico de las necedades y locuras de Orlando, for instance, Quevedo gives us Ferragut-another one of his lusty lovers-in terms sim- ilar to those in which he portrays Apollo. Ferragut runs after Angelica in a mad, comic pursuit which, like Phoebus chasing Daphne, combines both frenzy and canine animalization: Tales cosas corriendo por los cerros, iba gritando, y de uno en otro prado; tras el, en varias tropas, corren perros: iba de todas suertes emperrado. (III, 448) The association of Apollo-king of the stars-with a dog recalls an image from Greek and Roman letters which Quevedo, the os- tentatious classicist, may have had in mind. Sirius, the dog-star (Sirius in Greek means the scorcher), is the brightest and "hottest" star in the heavens; in classical texts it is a source of turmoil and causes people to flee. As we know, turmoil and escape characterize the relation between Apollo and Daphne. 12 La Caricature de lafemme, du mariage et de l'amour dans l'oeuvre de Quevedo (Paris, 1957), p. 140.</page><page sequence="21">Myth in Quevedo 519 The first tercet presents that burst of convulsive energy alluded to above and which is so often used by Quevedo for comic effect. The solar god appears in slapstick as a clownish street vendor peddling his celestial wares of signs and planets, perhaps in an effort to impress Daphne: "buhonero de signos y planetas/viene haciendo ademanes y figuras." (Ovid's Apollo had, on the other hand, spoken of his noble birth and lofty position as a deity.) The god's strange, mechanical contortions render him grotesque. He appears as a lifeless doll put into motion by a cruel puppeteer. (Apollo's puppet-like character will be discussed below.) The image also makes fun of Phoebus in his connection with astrology, which, like alchemy, was a frequent target of Quevedo's satire. But this gesticulating buffoon-whose fumbling run is mimicked in the awkward repetition of the conjunction "y"-bears the marks of his "trade" as a depraved seducer, for he carries bochornos y co- metas. The word bochornos not only points to the god's moral de- pravity but also refers to the sultry heat which Apollo, as the sun, creates; so it is a tie to the theme of the dog-star and the god's turmoil. Cometas also has a double meaning: it suggests a link to Apollo as astral deity, but in germania it means arrow, carrying us back to the quiver image and its sexual connotations. (The juxtaposition of bochornos and cometas is a mingling of the abstract and the concrete which, as Leo Spitzer has noted, is so characteristic of Quevedo's humor.) In this grotesque portrayal of a clown, Que- vedo has totally pulled the rug from under Apollo. All that is left for him is his fall, which is not long in coming. As Quevedo ends his speech to Daphne, the girl tricks the miserly trickster by "introducing" herself in coarse bark as in a safe fortress, out of the god's reach: "en cortezas duras/de laurel se ingiri6 contra sus tretas." The jilted god stays behind comically, but fittingly, as part of an escabeche, for laurel leaves are an in- gredient used in this culinary sauce. In these disorderly vignettes, which are Quevedo's sonnets, Apollo and Daphne are drawn with quite different brushes, harsh as each may be. The nymph is held up to ridicule touched by a repulsive animality; we see the fallen virgin associated with the dog-like rabble scratching itself, and we see her fleeing with bat wings. Quevedo's grotesque of Daphne belongs to a long line of grotesques so popular in medieval times and so masterfully con- ceived in works such as Bosch's phantasmagorias, where the mix- ture of human and animal is a graphic portrayal of man's ignoble</page><page sequence="22">520 Mary E. Barnard HR, 52 (1984) place in the chaotic world of sin. And, if Daphne is endowed with a monstrous, fantastic air, Apollo, on the other hand, is presented to us wearing a dunce cap. And it is upon this fool that our attention is focused, for Daphne is chiefly a foil against which the god's comicity is revealed. The mockery of the astral seducer rests largely on two popular traits in Quevedo's many caricaturas de tontos: inadequacy and puppetry. Apollo is a fool because he cannot per- form. In the underworld of the poem, Phoebus is a failed picaro. He bungles his erotic caper because he is an artless rogue: he lacks the deftness of the successful picaro, where rapacity and cunning exist in delicate balance, constantly reinforcing each other. The god is a trickster with no tricks in his bag, and so we see him only as the clumsy lover. Apollo also emerges as a puppet, possessed by that mechanized rigidity which Bergson finds at the root of the comic and which is so characteristic of Quevedo's burlesque characters, those hollow figures moving under the impulse of their own blind, petty concerns. There is a touch of this automatism in Ovid's Apollo. Driven by love as a malady which destroys the reason and overrides the will, the god becomes laughable in the chase and after the transfor- mation, when he embraces the tree and kisses it as if it were Daphne. But Ovid's Apollo-not the total fool like Quevedo's- "awakens" from his erotic madness and becomes the god again and, somewhat awkwardly, tries to regain his solemnity through his paean to Daphne. Quevedo's Apollo, in a similarly undignified Dionysiac frenzy, is caught in a whirl of lust but, in the hands of a less benevolent master, falls right "in the soup," perhaps drown- ing, and if not in a foul pool of urine like Rabelais' Parisians, at least in tasty escabeche. This is farce at its best. Ovid's half-fool is given a half-solution at the end of the story: by consecrating the laurel, Apollo at least has the sacred wreath as a consolation for his loss as he leaves the "stage." Ovid, the storyteller, keeps his hero alive for another day. Quevedo's total fool, by contrast, suffers total defeat, symbolized by darkness. The light of the beginning, as the radiant Sol, in hopeful, predatory pursuit, follows Daphne, contrasts markedly with this darkness. By means of the popular chiaroscuro of Baroque art and letters, Quevedo dramatizes the comically sad predicament of the solar deity: there is no shred of hope for the god. Quevedo "turns the light off," and all is over.</page><page sequence="23">Myth in Quevedo 521 In the sonnets, Apollo and Daphne are figures placed in a back- ground of silence-actors without voices moving comically on a silent stage (except perhaps for the faint sound of the god's quiver). This silence permits Quevedo to shape his characters at will, to present them in the most ridiculous light possible: the ancient figures appear not only helpless in their comicity but a bit stupid as well. And contrasting with this silence is the sound of the poet's voice in the foreground, advising and cautioning, sure and mas- terful, like that of a perverse Pantocrator. And though the foolish Apollo escapes his advice, Daphne pays close attention and, in her transformation, ultimately serves as his weapon of revenge against the god who would not listen. In Quevedo's handling of the mythological poem, one of the most derivative of genres, we find a masterful combination of convention and originality, of rhetorical commonplaces and striking invention. Quevedo treats the myth of Apollo and Daphne as a poetic fiction as Ovid his model had done before him. The Augustan couches the legend in the erotic conventions of Roman elegy, cre- ating a tale of jilted love, both serious and playful. In similar fashion, Quevedo, appropriating few but significant details from Ovid, uses the love traditions of his day for his story. But, unlike Ovid, Quevedo, a poet of double masks, separates the earnest from the jest by writing a turbulent serious version in quintillas, which contrasts sharply with his burlesque treatment in the sonnets. Following in Garcilaso's footsteps, he encases his tale in a courtly frame, pitting the idealized beloved against the sentimental, teary lover. But his imaginative vision carries him beyond the erotic into the realms of the cosmological and the Christian, and the discordant clashes in these realms ultimately mirror his meta- physical broodings. The theme of convulsion and the world-upside- down in the quintillas extends to the burlesque, when the ancient characters are projected in insolent, deformed inversion. But here parody and wit carry the day in a comedy of erotic frenzy and madness: a splendid virginal nymph turns into a dirty, animalized whore, and Apollo-robbed of his solemnity and seriousness, traits due him by virtue of his cult-is a lusting Dionysian and a fool. The elements of humor in Ovid's mock-heroic treatment of the god become in Quevedo a vaudeville burlesque, in which all his verbal flair and grotesque imagination produce these two unworthy figures. Of course, lurking behind the grotesque, behind the fallen,</page><page sequence="24">522 Mary E.
