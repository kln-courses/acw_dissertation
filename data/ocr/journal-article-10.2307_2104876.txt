<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION THE STRUCTURE OF METAPHYSICS: A CRITICISM OF LAZEROWITZ'S THEORY In recent decades the fate of "metaphysics" has been debated among philosophers with an intensity and subtlety which cannot fail to impress even those who, like myself, find in the ancient subject more solidity than the currently fashionable attitudes attribute to it. We now have a rela- tively systematic and admirably lucid document summing up certain alleged results of this debate.1 I wish to discuss a few of these results, in part constructively. I not only agree, to some extent, with the author but I think the practice of metaphysics can be substantially improved if his views are taken to heart - provided they are also taken with quali- fications, as views generally need to be taken. I shall emphasize the quali- fications, which may appear to contradict the "constructiveness" just promised. I hope that this will not be the impression. The book is well worth reading and pondering. This essay can do little justice to its wealth of clever analyses. One feels too that the author is struggling to find the truth, and not merely to make a case. (That the struggle is unprejudiced is too much to claim. Nor is there any evidence that the author has paid serious attention to the writers whom some of us would regard as the best representatives of modern metaphysics.) Professor Lazerowitz points out that we may consider metaphysical propositions as (1) empirical, or (2) a priori true or false, or (3) as verbal, or (4) as linguistic innovations.2 Only the last is accepted. I wish to argue that metaphysical propositions may well be both a priori true or false and (to some extent) linguistic innovations. Lazerowitz also holds that there are three layers in metaphysics, "an illusion of a theory about the world. . ., a non-verbal sentence which embodies an alteration of language. . ., and a belief..., which satisfies a wish and counters a fear in the substratum of our minds." 3 I wish to amend this as follows: bad or unsuccessful meta- physics, metaphysics which fails of its highest aim, does involve illusions of the kind in question, and these occur at least partly for the sort of unconscious reason suggested; however, successful or true metaphysics expresses not any illusion but a necessary or a priori truth, not in par- 1 Morris Lazerowitz, The Structure of Metaphysics.

Humanities Press, New York. 2 Ibid., p. 26. 3 Ibid., p. 67. 226</page><page sequence="2">THE STRUCTURE OF METAPHYSICS 227 ticular about "the world," but about reality as such, about any and all possibilities or conceivabilities for a world, or true state of affairs; and the belief in this necessary truth does not satisfy any particular wish, nor does it counter any particular fear, but rather it expresses the com- mon element in all possible wishes, and in all possible remedies for fear, against no matter what. The critical question, of course, concerns the possibility of distinguish- ing, on any reasonable grounds, between bad and good metaphysics. The nature of the contrast is at least crudely indicated by such commonsense expressions as "one-sided," or 'unbalanced," versus "well-balanced;;" "exaggerated," versus "properly qualified;" "extreme," as against "the golden mean." More technically the truth is the "higher synthesis" or, as Hegel put it, "the unity of contraries." I dislike and distrust much of Hegel's execution of the program, but this phrase, while needing careful interpretation, is acceptable. Now it is remarkable how frequently Lazero- witz, like so many of his contemporaries, takes as examples of meta- physics such obviously one-sided doctrines as, "substance is completely unknowable," 4 "things are but appearances" 5 (thus quite knowable indeed); "nothing exists," 6 "we cannot perceive negative facts;" 7 "everything changes," 8 "nothing changes" or "time is unreal." 9 I believe he also mentions, but does not discuss, "all relations are internal" or "all are external." Of course these contrary extremes cancel out, the one side being as defensible or indefensible as the other. But for that very reason both are valuable, since their common absurdity helps us to find the gol- den mean or higher synthesis. By what magic does our author miss this point? Does he have an unconscious wish to miss it, and thereby to miss the point of metaphysics itself? Possibly Lazerowitz's idea is that the higher synthesis would be simply ordinary good sense, and in no way a contribution, or anything exciting. But I cannot agree. The synthesis would indeed be harmonious with sound common sense, but on a different level of conscious explicitness. Let us see this in a particular case. We are told that "nothing changes" obviously cannot be meant to apply to phenomena, since the metaphysician knows as well as anyone that phenomena exhibit change in the plainest fashion. Nor, for a similar though perhaps less obvious reason, can "everything changes" be meant to apply to the experienced world of fact. All well and good: but take, "Everything changes (at least eventually) except..." 4 Ibid., p. 145. 5 Ibid., pp. 1, 32ff., 199. 6 Ibid., pp. 181f., 189ff. 7 Ibid., p. 193. 8 Ibid., pp. 27f., 42, 46, 58, 63. 9 Ibid., pp. 1, l1ff., 13, 19-22, 27, 29, 36f., 43f., 46, 58-79, 163-180.</page><page sequence="3">228 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH where the "proper" characterization of whatever it is that is absolutely and necessarily immutable is supposed to be furnished. That this state- ment does not apply to phenomena is less manifest; indeed, I hold that in a sense it does apply to them. If by "reality" or "the world" one means whatever happens to exist, taken in its contingent aspects alone, then our statement says nothing about the world. But the question is, What is true of all the kinds of things that might conceivably exist (better, all the kinds of events that might conceivably occur, or again ,"all possible worlds" - an expression easily misunderstood)? For example, would there, in any world, be causes producing effects according to some sort of laws, some order, and if so, would this order in all cases be of the deter- ministic sort (excluding randomness entirely), or would it in all cases be partly indeterministic; or finally, would it in some possible worlds be deterministic, and in others not? Lazerowitz would perhaps hold that the very possibility of speaking of deterministic and indeterministic laws (statistical, approximative, probabilistic) implies that both are logically possible. It does imply that there are deterministic and indeterministic aspects of conceivable laws, but whether either aspect would or could altogether exclude the other in any conceivable state of affairs is another question. Every competent person who has tried to carry through the analysis of a deterministic law, even on Newtonian presuppositions, has been impressed by the difficulties of avoiding absurdity. Thus Reichen- bach concludes a careful discussion by saying that, though determinism is logically compatible with classical physics," it is an "empty," "redun- dant" addition to it, "which can very well be dispensed with." 10 The "com- patiblity" itself is empty, unless classical physics could be literally true of some conceivable world. With Bergson, Peirce, and others, I view that physics, taken literally, as incompatible with the meaning of "process," "event," or "time." But it is also highly doubtful if the notion of a com- pletely lawless or random state of affairs has a consistent meaning. Hence the partly indeterministic, or "intelligible chance," conception of law may the sole truly conceivable view, valid for any universe what- ever. It is then a piece of good metaphysics. However, this paragraph does not exhaust what could be said on the subject. Of course, the foregoing metaphysical statement about law commun- icates no "fact," if by that is meant something in nature that might con- ceivably not have been as it is. But it does not follow that nothing has been affirmed about "reality." The real is that to which true affirmations refer. Metaphysical affirmations seek to put into conscious conceptual form whatever is common to, or true of, all conceivable occurrences. Is this common element of all possibility a mere matter of words or 10 H. Reichenbach, The Direction of Time. (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1956), p. 95.</page><page sequence="4">THE STRUCTURE OF METAPHYSICS 229 meanings in human discourse? This type of anthropomorphism is not self-evidently correct. Is it only our thinking which makes things possible, even "logically possible"? I hold that there would be actualities and possibilities (both "real" and "logical") were there no human thought, and that these would have a universally common element which by definition would be the necessary. Metaphysics is the attempt to charac- terize this element. It is of course no "fact," for this word is best used for that which contingent true assertions affirm. But if reality is the object of correct affirmations (that which measures their truth), then the neces- sary can also be real. It is neither a fact, nor something merely "behind," or additional, to all facts; but rather, something in them all. Is it "super- sensible"? It is an element or aspect of the sensible, but not as such sen- sible; for it is experienced only in universal union with the sensible, from which it can be distinguished only by operations of thought. Metaphysical statements are not descriptions of particular things, but without them no description of anything is complete or fully explicit. Metaphysics without God outdoes Hamlet without Hamlet. Like so many, Lazerowitz thinks that a "transcendently perfect Being" (a phrase in which I find a dangerous ambiguity) can be affirmed to exist, if at all, only as something entirely factual or contingent. This is a typical piece of bad metaphysics. The opposite extreme, also bad metaphysics, is that God can only be conceived as exclusively necessary, entirely without factual or contingent qualities, the "necessary being" and nothing else. The synthe- sis is that God is the subject of both factual and a priori or necessary existential propositions, according to a principle deducible from the mean- ing of "divine perfection." Anselm saw one side of this, and neatly missed the other, and this is one reason for his failure to convince. It can, I think, be shown that what even the plain man means by "God," as "Creator of all," entails that such a being could not just happen to exist, or happen to fail to exist. Contingency-of-existence is part of the meaning of "crea- ture," and is excluded by the meaning of "creator of all," or of "supreme- ly perfect." Contingency entails imperfection. We all have "existential" awareness of this. To be capable of nonexistence is to be imperfect, even though existent. Which critic of Anselm even discusses this point ? "Divine perfection exists" - if "existence" is meant in the factual sense - is quite as absurd, according to Anselm (in his reply to Gaunilon) as, "Divine perfection does not exist." 12 Either we have here a necessary truth or a necessary falsehood (absurdity), but in no genuinely conceiv- able case a mere fact, positive or negative. Nevertheless, granting for the moment that the divine existence is necessary (we shall later see another 11 Lazerowitz, op. cit., pp. 27 f. 12 See Hartshorne and Reese, Philosophers Speak of God, (Chicago, 1953), pp. 97, 102 (? 79).</page><page sequence="5">230 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH reason why it cannot be contingent), there must also be factual truths about God; and that which in God "makes" them true can only be con- tingent. Thus, "God knows that elephants exist" cannot be necessary, since it entails "elephants exist," which is not necessary. Hence God's knowledge of the existence of elephants can only be something non-neces- sary, a contingent or factual qualification of the divine. Here theology (with some honorable exceptions) for nearly two thousand years stub- bornly adhered to a contradiction. It refused to admit anything contin- gent in God, yet asserted his knowledge of the contingent world. Why this stubborn persistence in what seems the plainest contradiction? Here I believe something like the author's psychological explanation must be the answer. The seeming paradox of an individual whose existence (not whose entire reality) is knowable a priori can be mitigated by adding a point which is relatively new in metaphysics. "Existential statements are contingent" - logicians are agreed upon this doctrine. But, like so many others, the statement turns out to require further distinction, refinement, or qualification. The refinement I suggest is that existential statements on the lower logical levels, those mentioning definite particulars, or special qualities of particulars, are all contingent. However, existential statements not mentioning definite particulars, and entirely tolerant as between any or all special or particular existential statements, are a priori. For instance, "there are particulars" affirms nothing definitely particular or special, as "there are secrets" divulges none. Again, as will be explained presently, by "God" is intended an individual whose existence exhibits complete tolerance toward all special or particular existential statements. I hold, therefore, that it is a category-mistake, a mistake as to logical level, to take the existential statement, "An ideally powerful and wise being exists" as the affirmation of a contingent truth or a contingent falsehood - in short a fact, actual or conceivable. It may seem strange to say that, though God is an individual, his existence is not anything particular. However, we must distinguish be- tween things or persons, and events - only the latter being necessarily, and in all cases, particular. One of the pieces of unfinished business in current logic is the casualness with which things and events are lumped together as the values for the existential operator. (Our author does not, so far as I can find, face this topic in these essays.) The logic of the theistic question can scarcely be discussed profitably unless one disting- uishes systematically between the level of actual occurrences, including human experiences, and the level of enduring things or persons. The latter is a different level, logically and metaphysically. Only occurrences are fully concrete, only they fully illustrate the law of excluded middle as to predicates. They are the ultimate contingencies, and the contingency of</page><page sequence="6">THE STRUCTURE OF METAPHYSICS 231 (ordinary) individuals is a logical function of their contingency. In the case of deity, it is part of the meaning of individuality on that exalted level that any particular event or state of the universe would have as its correlate an appropriate particular state of the divine individual (as creator and infallible knower of that universe); hence the contingency of everything particular, even in God, does not mean the contingency of the divine existence or individuality. If our author were correct that metaphysical problems are simple and not especially subtle, I could have made all this clear in a paragraph! But as I am about to explain, I do not think that he is correct in this contention. The essays before us argue that the a priori view cannot enable us to understand the endless, seemingly incurable, disputes among metaphy- sicians. For, says the author, metaphysical demonstrations are neither more complex nor more subtle than those of mathematics. 13 He does not argue this point. He perhaps thinks his examples of metaphysical propo- sitions show how simple and unsubtle they are. To some extent this is correct, for he has in general chosen relatively simple and sometimes extraordinarily crude examples. They are practically all examples of bad metaphysics, one-sided extremes of a sort which few major speculative philosophers during the last century and a half have wished to defend. True, Bradley took a position of this sort, but as William James said, he was a brilliant man spoiled by "perversity," by an emotional bias making careful examination of issues impossible. James was on the whole less one-sided, and so was Royce (on the opposite side). Some others were less unbalanced than either of these, Peirce being one. Another is too obvious to .mention. But our author ignores what I take to be the main stream of recent metaphysics. Is metaphysics as simple as mathematics? In the first place, I suspect that metaphysics includes pure mathematics, for it includes all that is entirely a priori, free of essential empirical elements. In the second place, the simplest aspects of mathematics (and derivatively the complex aspects) are capable of a degree of clarity that other a priori knowledge cannot attain; and it is just this possibility of clarity that (among other considerations) causes the mathematician to select the topics he does select as parts of his subject. The secret of mathematical clarity seems to be the Peirce-Wittgenstein principle of structure exhibited in symbolic form, or as Peirce put it, the " observation of diagrams," symbolic arrays operated upon according to rules. In this way, e.g., the addition of units to make two, three, and so on can be made as simple and obvious as any a priori conception could be, and as capable of clarity. But the discern- ment of what is invariant in all logically possible change; or of that which 13 Lazerowitz, op. cit., p. 39.</page><page sequence="7">232 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH makes it possible for there to be permanent truths about events which, because of their remote pastness, seem now to be as nothing; or the dis- cernment of the common element in all conceivable causal laws; or of what can intelligibly be meant by "God" - how can these be made simple and crudely obvious? In my opinion, the large majority of the greatest minds that have considered these topics have fallen into more or less confusion about nearly all of them. Lazerowitz urges that this confusion - - as shown by the inability to agree - can only be explained by supposing that unconscious drives have been motivating the procedures. 14 I accept much that he says about this. But does it invalidate the view that meta- physics is the search for a priori truths which really obtain, and might, to a greater or lesser extent, be known by human beings? I see no either- or here, but a both-and. The one-sided errors which mark the failures of metaphysicians are indeed, in one sense, all too evidently successes, namely emotional ones. If what you fear is change, how comforting to deny its reality! Or, more subtly, make change itself (verbally) the one permanent thing, and in this way attain a sense of immunity to particular changes. Or perhaps, if fixity bores you, exult in the notion that even the hills are not everlasting. Of, if you dislike the irksome restraints of material limitations, deny the reality of physical things. Please note, however, that anything which can be said concerning the appeal to the unconscious of one-sided or bad metaphysics is quite compatible with the view that there could be a balanced or correct metaphysics. Indeed, the fact that metaphysical one- sidedness has emotional values strengthens considerably the case which La- zerowitz cavalierly rejects - the case for the view that a priori metaphy- sical truth is neither an illusion nor at all easy to find and keep in sight. It is not easy, partly for intellectual reasons of subtlety and complexity, to which our author does much injustice, and partly for the very reasons of emotional temptation which he so well elucidates. What inconsistency is there in thus combining these two points? Furthermore, it is impossible to do justice to metaphysics unless one realizes that, as there is a distinction between contingent fact and neces- sary truth, so there is between ordinary first-level wishes or emotions - contingent demands or preferences which can be renounced for good and sufficient reasons, whether of non-possibility of fulfillment, or of prior claims - and whatever may be common to all possible wishes or de- mands, so that to renounce it would mean to deny life itself. (Even the suicide does not really do this, for his deliberate attack upon his own life is a positive act, whose value he in effect affirms.) Now my proposal is this, sound metaphysics resists the temptation to bolster any contingent 14 Ibid., especially pp. 67-79.</page><page sequence="8">THE STRUCTURE OF METAPHYSICS 233 values by a priori pronouncements; but the effort to find a theoretical formulation for the non-contingent "demand" which is inherent in life as such is a legimatite endeavor, and not a yielding to temptation at all. For what it affirms is what everyone affirms, merely by living and acting; the only difference is as to the degree and clarity with which one formu- lates the affirmation in concepts. The feeling that one does not want to die, or to change, or to admit the reality of death or of change, is a contingent demand, which can and should be renounced! But the insistence that neither death nor change can mean that the universe ultimately might in no way be enriched by one's having existed and thus that all one's efforts to serve a long-run good might be totally defeated - this insistence is not contingent, and is in effect accepted merely by living. Indeed its denial is nonsensical, for as Santayana notes - without full realization, I think, of what is involved - it must always remain true that one has lived as one has, more or less happily, and with more or less benefit to others; moreover, the notion that this permanence of truth carries no implications for the permanence of any other values is due, I should argue, to faulty analysis, or lack of analysis. Some sort of "immortality" is already accepted by those who admit that truth is indestructible, and this may be the only immortality we need for any essential purpose of giving life a "meaning." But more may be involved in the immortality of truth than non-metaphysicians, and perhaps most metaphysicians, quite ap- preciate. "Truth" is but a word - what "makes" statements true for all the future? It is easy to say that life need not have any permanent value-result; but I am not aware by what mode of action it would be possible to show that this affirmation has more than verbal status. With Schweitzer, I take it as a verbal gesture, contradicted by itself and by any and all gestures taken as expressive of life. Life includes faith and trust in the future, beyond any time limit that can be set; not necessarily in a self-regarding future - I am not talking about rewards in heaven - but in a future to which our living will have made its contribution, if only by having really taken place, a contribution which we can will to make when we reflect upon it consciously. What shall we say about our author's fourth hypothesis concerning metaphysics (it coincides with the middle of the three layers in the meta- physical cake) - the hypothesis that metaphysical statements are propo- sals for linguistic change? 15 My suggestion is that, with suitable qualifi- cations, this too is acceptable. But here again we must allow for a distinc- tion between good and bad, or balanced and unbalanced, metaphysics. It is rather bad metaphysics to say, "There are no things or persons, 15 Ibid., pp. 67, 104, 168, 197f., 225, 247, 276.</page><page sequence="9">234 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH but only events." For who can really restrict himself to the language of events? But it may be good metaphysics to argue that a full analysis of things and persons must be in the language of events - occurrences, or acts - a language which needs to be carefully developed, not that it may displace ordinary language, but that it may supplement it for philosophical and scientific purposes. Ordinary language is then viewed as perfectly proper and invaluable shorthand, adequate save for certain ultimate purposes, i.e., purposes of understanding the subtler contingent aspects of the world, or the eternal and necessary aspects. Ordinary language is not "self-contradictory," as ordinarily used, but it becomes self-contradictory when pressed too hard for analytic purposes, scientific or metaphysical. There are, however, certain points where common sense (or what some might call that) and everyday speech do encroach upon metaphysical issues. These are particularly in religious matters, or where some aspect of infinity or perfection is involved. "God" and "immortality," for exam- ple, are not literally and correctly expressible in the same terms as most other subjects, unless by the exercise of more care than the plain man has to bestow upon them. So one finds language which is vague or ambi- guous and is saved from absurdity only by a sensitive feeling for context - and not entirely even in that way. Thus if a pious man is unfortunate, he may wonder "why God has done this to him;" but if he feels that he has sinned, he does not attribute his sin to God, but to his own choice; and yet the misfortune which he has attributed to God can very well be due to the choice of another man, and this he may well know. To avoid this type of absurdity, careful explication of terms is required. Perhaps, and I hope so, some of this care will eventually effect an improvement in everyday speech, but so far it seems not to have done so. The reason, however, may very well be due to this, that technical theology itself has not hitherto been adequately conscious, for the most part, of the gulf between ordinary secular speech and even ordinary religious speech. I am not taking sides with those who draw the conclusion that religious language is necessarily symbolic; I think it can have very important elements of literalness - but only at the price of great care to find the balance between tempting extremes, a better balance than most theologi- ans have succeeded in attaining. Lazerowitz begins one of his chapters (X) by mentioning what I regard as a piece of fairly good metaphysics, proceeds to comment briefly though eloquently upon it, and then devotes the bulk of the chapter to bad met- aphysics (the assertion that physical objects are unreal). Why does he do this? Could it be because his method is adequate only if all metaphysics is bad? The "good" metaphysics is an assertion, quoted from Bradley, that reality is composed throughout of feelings, or the "psychical." The</page><page sequence="10">THE STRUCTURE OF METAPHYSICS 235 analyst then suggests that this assertion "cannot be maintained in the face of fact." 16 But I do not know what facts contravene (or could con- travene) the meaning which a number of philosophers would give to the assertion - taking it in a sense which makes it independent of certain other features in Bradley's system. The assertion does not forbid such usual judgments as, "Rocks (or trees) do not feel (or are insentient)." What is excluded is a type of statement which might indeed carelessly be supposed equivalent: "There are no feelings in (or necessary to) rocks or trees." Or again, "Rocks and trees are in no manner composed essential- ly of feelings." This latter mode of statement goes infinitely beyond the first, and I believe, and a good many others have believed, that it over- shoots the mark and falls into meaninglessness or self-contradiction. First, let us see how it goes beyond the harmless, "certain things are insentient." There are at least two senses in which feeling may be in or necessary to something which is not itself sentient. An army is not a sentient individual, but there are no armies without soldiers, which are sentient. Again, a finger does not feel, but there is no normal finger save as part of an organism which does feel. (Also, a finger is a sort of army of cells. It cannot be obvious that cells do not feel.) Similarly, rocks do not feel, but to deny that feeling is essential to them, is to assert both of the following disjunctions: (a) either rocks have no individual constituents (even invisibly small ones), or these constituents need not be sentient; and (b) either it is not necessary to rocks to be constituents of any larger whole (such as the universe) or this whole need not be sentient. Now I submit that ordinary ways of thinking cannot reasonably be burdened with far-flung negative speculations of this sort. Ordinary perceptions obviously cannot tell us with any definiteness what imperceptibly small constituents or imperceptibly large wholes are like; yet until we know something about these we know nothing as to the validity of Bradley's statement. Beginning with Leibniz there have been philosophers, a small minority, who have thought more or less clearly about the problem of constituents; and beginning with Fechner there have been those who have called our attention to the problem of larger wholes. The most universally competent scientific mind I have known, Sewall Wright, the geneticist, is convinced that physical reality consists entirely of sentient creatures.17 He is not a man given to saying anything more nor less than he means. He does not intend to impugn (and he does not impugn) essen- tial modes of speech; he is not a "metaphysician" in Lazerowitz's sense. But he is a man who can keep track of the difference between ordinary 16 Ibid., p. 199; cf. also p. 51, where, however, the author is expounding positivism, not necessarily his own view. 17 See the closing paragraphs of his article on "Evolution, Organic" in the Ency- clopaedia Britannica (Chicago, Toronto, London, 1948).</page><page sequence="11">236 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH macroscopic things and radically smaller, or larger, things. Some of my fellow philosophers cannot, more's the pity. But, you may ask, is not the foregoing a discussion of a factual question? Of course, "rocks" and "trees" are empirical, factual entities; in so far, we have been discussing a factual matter. But there is an a priori or met- aphysical aspect. The conceivable alternatives to rocks and trees would also be things with or without constituents, and they would or would not require membership in larger wholes, and these constituents and wholes would, or would not, be perceivable or conceivable as without sentience. To decide what is possible here, one must have some notion of what forms perception and conception might conceivably take. We cannot do justice to these topics; but I shall mention one aspect. In a chapter dealing with "Negative Terms," Lazerowitz takes the pro- blem to be set, either by those who declare that "nothing exists," or by those who deny that negative facts can be perceived.18 He explains that this last is a way, not literally correct, of emphasizing the correct point that not-red is no color among others, and not-cheese is no physical entity, along with cheese and apples. But the exciting question at issue here is not, can negative facts be perceived, but can purely or exclusively negative facts be perceived (or conceived)? Here is the good metaphysical question. It is rather cleanly missed. When we perceive that a thing is "not red," we do it by perceiving it as having some color, or other positive property, which it could not have and yet be red. Blank nothing is not a datum, as the author correctly notes, but it follows that every verified privation of a property is the observed presence of an incompatible pro- perty. If this principle is valid a priori - a piece of good metaphysics - then sweeping consequences can be established by applying it to various topics. For example, "something exists" becomes a priori, since it has no positive alternative. Again, "there is no divine being" asserts a pri- vation, the non-existence of "divinity"; what then is the presence, the incompatible property, which excludes divinity from existence? (For, to repeat, either there can be purely negative facts, or all non-existence is exclusion by something incompatible.) Some would say the existence of evil excludes divinity. I have argued elsewhere (as have other philosophers) that this involves an interpretation of "divine power" which is either self-contradictory or meaningless, and that, as some of us define or explicate "divinity" or "divine perfection," power in this absurd sense is not entailed. If there is no property whose instantiation excludes divinity (and I know of none), then either purely negative facts are pos- sible, or the non-existence of deity is impossible. This does not suffice to prove theism; for one must still refute the positivistic contention that 18 Ibid., pp. 181, 193.</page><page sequence="12">THE STRUCTURE OF METAPHYSICS 237 neither the existence nor the non-existence of deity is conceivable, since the idea itself is confused or self-contradictory. But it does suffice to prove that the central theistic question is not factual, but a priori. The game of "refuting" Anselm has been played long enough - why not give heed at last to what he discovered? (Not "existence" in the ordinary contingent sense, but "necessary existence," the status of "pervading all possibility," is the predicate included in perfection.) Now let us return to the question of physical things and "feeling." Either there can be purely negative facts, or else the absence of feeling means the presence of some incompatible property. What property? Extendedness? To accept this is to imply that feelings are either nowhere, or are each at a point only; neither view is defensible, so far as I can see. Feelings are somewhere and not in mere points; hence they are in regions. But is this not what "extended" means? Besides, the most positive ex- planation of extension is due to those philosophers, Peirce being one, who show that feelings have a social structure which is their extended- ness. "My neighbor is he with whom I intimately react;" feelings are always more or less consciously social, concerned with neighbors in some broad sense. Moreover, since the different modes of feeling are social or extended in diverse ways, the whole breadth of the concept of extension can, for all anyone has shown, be dealt with in terms of them. The only properties which do exclude feelings are extremes of disunity, or of monotonous sameness and repetitiveness. For both reasons rocks, and probably trees, do not feel. But there are no facts showing that either reason applies to the minute constituents of these things, or to the universe as a whole, of which they are essentially members. Moreover, it can be argued that this situation would obtain in any possible universe. Non- feeling could, it may be suspected, be no more than a matter of level in the part-whole relationship. This is connected with the point we considered in the fourth paragraph of this essay, that any reality must be ordered, but yet with an element of randomness. A musicologist has said, "Order is the vast expanse between the deadly extremes of chaos and mechani- zation." 19 But any conceivable state of reality will furnish such a mean. This does not entail that any world will be ideally right, but only that evil, or failure to achieve harmonious, vivid feelings, will be but relative, and thus feeling will be universally applicable (to all individuals, though not to all their aggregates, or all arbitrarily distinguished parts). The thread- bare query, Are there physical (spatially extended) objects? has distracted attention from the profounder question, Are there (could there be) merely physical objects? Lazerowitz holds that the self-contradictory can give rise to no appear- 19 Curt Sachs, Rhythm and Tempo (New York, 1953), 20.</page><page sequence="13">238 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH ance or illusion. Thus if change even seems to occur, it is not inconceiv- able. I agree, as to change, but because change is presupposed in the idea of its correlative term, fixity or permanence. The one is as clear as the other, for both express the same contrast. But in the idea of "mere matter, devoid of feeling," we have no such clarity; nor does the use of "feeling," or of "sentient," depend upon any contrast to matter, so conceived. It depends rather upon more specific contrasts between wholes or parts not as such sentient, and those which are; also between feelings negligible in intensity, and those of usual or unusual vividness. In such vague negative concepts as "mere matter," contradiction may very well be concealed; and if perception seems to illustrate the supposed notion, this might not unnaturally be termed an illusion. In his final chapter, Lazerowitz attempts to refute the view (which I have been defending) that a priori or logically necessary propositions express what every possible, or as he puts it, theoretical, universe has in common with every other. Is it not significant that he gives as examples, "Every buttercup is in one place only at any one time," "blue is a colour," "a flea is an insect." 20 Surely buttercups, blue, and fleas are not items in every possible universe! These seem to me illustrations of a kind of indirect empirical truth. In every a priori sentence there is at least one empirical element, the fact that certain words happen to have a certain meaning. In some so-called "a priori" sentences there is an additional empirical element, in that the things for which the words stand are themselves merely empirical or contingent. In "All fleas are insects" what is purely a priori is, of course, only the logical truism that members of a subclass of a class C must be members of C. If in any conceivable state of affairs there must (at least for omniscience) be classifiable items, then this truism is metaphysical. But "blue is a color," for example, is not, since one can, so far at least as I can see, very well conceive of a total reality lacking any such quality as "blue" stands for. Not even "not-blue" (or its verbal equivalent) must have meaning in any possible world, for the question of blue does not arise at all except under special conditions, and all special conditions are contingent. The consideration that such a sentence as "fleas cannot fail to be insects" might be vacuous- ly true, and that indeed there might have been neither fleas nor 'fleas' should not mislead us into supposing that all terms and their referents must similarly be contingent. It turns out, for example, to involve con- tradiction to treat "deity exists" in this way. The phrase, to be sure, is contingent; but not what it is defined to mean. Here the linguistic factor is the only contingent one. There are alternatives to "the existence of God" but not to the existence of God (assuming 'God' has a consistent 20 Lazerowitz, op. cit., pp. 265, 264, 270.</page><page sequence="14">THE STRUCTURE OF METAPHYSICS 239 meaning). Nor, I think, is there any alternative to the existence of "some world," some positive state of reality or other. Our author casts delicate ridicule upon the notion that a logical neces- sity has any analogy to a real or causal necessity, a sort of inflexibility in things which cannot be overcome. But there are many degrees and sorts of analogy, as linguistic analysts know when it comes to language, and often forget when it comes to anything else. The metaphysical or purely a priori necessity refers, indeed, to the ultimate invariant of reality, present throughout all changes, past or to be anticipated. It is, however, rather an infinite flexibility than a rigid inflexibility. It is really an infinite creative and cognitive power, and comprises an unimaginably vast range of possibilities, rather than this or that special impossibility. It forbids nothing, and is the alternative to nothing, save nonsense, or what appears to be something but is not, such as unthinkable confusion or unthinkable monotony. We appear, perhaps, to be able to think of a disintegrated reality, a mere chaos, or - at the opposite extreme - of a "perfectly ordered" reality. Or again, we appear to be able to think of a world of things ordered, though not by any divine orderer. We can also say the words, "mere matter." However, is human language and thought so shot through with distinctness that there is no danger of self-deception here? I think there is danger, plenty of it.21 Clearly these matters are not easy; and Lazerowitz's psychological-linguistic explanation of metaphysical disputes, while I accept it as more or less true, need not be anything like the whole story. One needs a certain ability, and perhaps above all a certain disinterestedness, to explore such questions with the sort of perspicacity and freedom which their clarification requires. Such disin- terestedness seems rare (and I rather fancy that even the ability is not so common as some suppose). Non-theists generally are not very willing to explore the possible formulations of theism in order to find whether or not there is one which makes sense (as some assuredly do not); theists generally are reluctant to explore, not only forms of atheism, but even the possible formulations, other than their own, of theism. On the con- trary, a theist usually becomes attached to one form early in his career, and adheres to it through every turn in his thought, caricaturing alter- natives rather than investigating them. There are many reasons for this narrow-minded stubbornness, but how can it prove that there is no truth to discover in such matters? Until we overcome these bad ways of think- ing to a greater extent than we yet have, we shall not be in a position to judge! And the fine logicians of our time for the most part only play at thinking about essential philosophical questions; they do not seriously attend to them in an objective, systematic way. We have centuries of 21 We are told that "all of us are able to recognize propositions... true by logical necessity" (p. 254). The obvious and trite ones yes, but all? I disagree.</page><page sequence="15">240 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH speculation behind us, but possibly (if we escape self-destruction) hundreds of millions ahead of us. Metaphysics is not old; it is very young, on such a scale! One important cause of disagreement among metaphysicians is religious dogma and clerical intolerance. Even today, it is difficult for a Roman Catholic philosopher and many members of other churches to enter into philosophical discussions without powerful inhibitions or reservations. And, partly by natural reaction, anti-clericals and skeptics are possibly just as unfree. We face all the temptations Lazerowitz sees, plus those to which he himself appears to have yielded, and doubtless many more besides. This subject is assuredly in several senses more difficult than arithmetic. My conclusion, which must be highly inconclusive, since this is but an article, is that our author has given us a helpful but truncated analysis of metaphysics, an analysis which is one-sided because it deals chiefly with one-sided or crude examples (never with the subtlest and best balanced ones!), thus giving the incorrect impression that metaphysics, intellectually, can only be one-sided or crude, a perverse tour de force. So it sometimes is. It is greatly to be hoped that such books as this will stimulate an im- provement in our methods of seeking a priori knowledge of the strictly necessary aspects of existence - those common to all conceivable states of reality, though not to all those which, to casual consideration, appear to be conceivable.
