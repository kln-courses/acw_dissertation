<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BUSINESS FIRM AS A POLITICAL COALITION' JAMES G. MARCH Carnegie Institute of Technology T HE MODERN BUSINESS FrRm is an organization for making and implementing decisions within a market economy. In most major industries of well-developed economies, most firms are large, complex organizations. These organizations render a set of key decisions for the economy. They establish prices, determine outputs, make investments, and allocate resources. These decisions and the consequences ensuing from them are the focus for the economic study of the firm. The economic theory of the firm attempts (1) to specify the decisions that business firms will make (as a basis for more aggregate predictions of the economy) and (2) to prescribe appropriate decision rules for a rational firm operating in a market economy. Except as it enters as a participant in the general political arena, the business firm has not been a focus of study for political scientists. Political scientists have generally defined their field in a relatively modest way, limiting their attention to phenomena that occur in, or in close conjunction with, explicitly governmental institutions. Except for a few attempts to define the field in terms of the study of power (or its variants), the major criterion for delimiting the field has been descriptive rather than analytic. By any reasonable descriptive definition of political science, the business firm is outside the domain. Similarly, economists have largely ignored political systems except as they impinge on the market. Although it is con- ventional for economists to identify their field in terms of an analyt- ic definition (e.g., the study of the allocation of scarce resources), the vast bulk of economic research is linked to a descriptive defi- nition of the field. For practical purposes, economics is the study of [ 662 1 1This paper is based on a paper presented at the annual meetings of the American Political Science Association in St. Louis, September 7, 1961.

The main attention to politics comes as a side issue in the area of economic policy. At the risk of offending both economists and political scientists, I will assert that this division of labor is dysfunctional. It con- tributes to our inability as students to understand and predict the firm; it contributes to our inability as public policy makers to control and direct the firm. More specifically, I will argue that the business organization is properly viewed as a political system and that view- ing the firm as such a system both clarifies conventional economic theories of the firm and (in conjunction with recent developments in theoretical languages) suggests some ways of dealing with classi- cal problems in the theory of political systems generally. The argu- ment depends on a general statement of the theoretical problem in- volved in decision models of complex systems, an evaluation of two major alternative approaches to that problem, and an examination of the implications of some recent attempts to develop a revised theory of the firm on the basis of a few key political concepts. CONFLICT SYSTEMS Consider a general class of purposive systems characterized by two attributes: 1. There are consistent basic units. Each elementary unit in the system can be described as having a consistent preference ordering defined over the possible states of the system. By a consistent preference ordering is meant an ordering such that for any realizable subset of possible states of the system there exists at least one state as good as any other state in the subset. Thus we require that the elementary units be able to make a choice among alternatives states of the system (al- lowing for a chance decision rule for the special case in which there is more than one state at least as good as all other states). 2. There is conflict. The preference orderings of the elementary units are mutually inconsistent relative to the resources of the system. Conflict, in this sense, arises when the most preferred states of all elementary units cannot be simultane- ously realized. In order for conflict (in this sense) to exist it must be true that there is no allocative decision such that</page><page sequence="3">664 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [VOL. 24 no one of the elementary units would prefer an alternative state of the system. These two simple postulated attributes underlie a wide variety of theories about conflict resolution, choice, or the allocation of scarce resources. Whether we are talking about the behavior of individuals in a simple learning experiment, the internal dynamics of a small group solving a problem, the interaction of parties and pressure groups in a legislative setting, or the pricing of commodities in a market system, we frequently make these two postulates. For con- venience, let us call them the postulates of conflict. Any system satisfying the postulates we can call a conflict system. One feature of studies of conflict systems that is puzzling from the point of view of the postulates of conflict is the extent to which the elementary units in one study are the conflict systems of an- other. The individual is treated as the system in some cases (e.g., in learning) and as the elementary unit in other (e.g., studies of small groups). Similarly, small groups are treated both as systems and as elementary units (e.g., in studies of organizations). Since the first postulate of conflict is essentially that the basic units them- selves not be conflict systems, it seems awkward to be able to view a single system as either an elementary unit or a conflict system de- pending on the level of aggregation involved. In fact, most systems studied in the social sciences are apparently conflict systems of con- flict systems. The assumption of consistent basic units is justified by assert- ing either of two other characteristics of the macro-system involved. We may assert that the preference ordering of the subsystem (which we wish to identify as the elementary unit) is causally antecedent, and independent of, the decisions of the larger system. In such a case, we treat the preference ordering of the subsystem as given without considering the way in which that ordering is derived. Alternatively, we may assert that variation in system behavior due to conflict within the subsystem is trivial because of scale differences between the conflict within the subsystem on the one hand and con- flict among subsystems on the other. In such a case, we take the preference ordering of the subsystem as subject to some minor error without attempting to eliminate the error entirely. Such assertions are not simple technicalities. Consider, for ex- ample, either labor-management bargaining or bargaining among</page><page sequence="4">1962] BUSINESS FnTM AS POLITICAL COALITION 665 nations. Most of the literature and models of these phenomena accept the postulates of conflict. Since it is clear that (at the least) labor unions and nation states are themselves conflict systems, the theories are required to make some assertions that will allow the postulates of conflict to be made. A casual reading of this literature would suggest that either the assumption of causal antecedence or the assumption of scale difference is typically made. A casual read- ing of the literature also suggests, however, that the assumptions are suspect. In fact, one of the major recent developments in the study of these particular conflict systems has been a consideration of the complexities of interaction between the resolution of conflict within the subsystems and the resolution of conflict within the larger system. Despite such observations on the difficulties of satisfying the first postulate of conflict, most theories of conflict resolution essen- tially accept it as a reasonable approximation. If we restrict our attention to more or less well-defined theories susceptible to tech- nical manipulation, virtually all theories use the postulate. Political theory deals primarily with conflict systems as thus defined; and a rather large proportion of studies of the political process are concerned with discovering how conflict is resolved within a system revolving around some explicitly political institu- tions. Similarly, economic theory and economic studies focus to a large extent on conflict systems identified with explicitly economic institutions. In recent years a modest resurgence of political economy as a field of study has led to some important applications of eco- nomic concepts to the analysis of political conflict systems. This is particularly conspicuous in the work of Downs,2 Davis and Whin- ston,3 and Buchanan and Tullock.4 In these attempts, allocation problems in politics have been studied from the point of view of concepts developed for economic systems. In some cases (e.g., Downs), this has meant the translation of a standard form of eco- nomic analysis into political terms. In other cases (e.g., Davis and Whinston), the general approach is clearly economic but the detailed form of analysis is relatively new for economics as well as politics. At the same time, some recent work in organization theory seems 2A. Downs, An Economic Theory of Democracy (New York, 1957). 'O. A. Davis and A. B.

In many resepcts, March and Simon,5 Thompson,6 and Cyert and March7 view the business organization as a socio-political conflict system subject to economic constraints. THEORIES OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION Given that we wish to describe a system as satisfying the postu- lates of conflict, and given that we wish to describe this system as "acting," "behaving," "choosing," or "deciding," we are required to introduce some mode of conflict resolution. By saying that the sys- tem does in fact "act," we accept the proposition that the system in some sense prefers some state of the world to other possible states of the world. By describing the system as a conflict system, we assert that the system does not have a preference ordering in the usual sense of that term. The devices used to move from conflict to conflict resolution comprise the core of a theory of a conflict system. In general, extant theories take one of two directions for resolving conflict. Either they impute a superordinate goal in terms of which the conflict can be mediated, or they describe a process by which decisions are reached without explicit comparison of utilities. The latter approach is typical of theories of political coalitions; the form- er is typical of theories of business firms. The imputation of a superordinate goal. Any conflict system that can be observed and that can be de- scribed as "behaving" is susceptible to description in terms of a superordinate goal. Given a sequence of behaviors, we impute a superordinate goal by accepting two simple assumptions: First, we assume there exists a joint preference ordering for the system at any particular point in time. Second, we assume the system always chooses the alternative behavior that is most preferred. Consider, for example, the familiar example of a conspicuous conflict system -a tree.8 Is it reasonable to say that a tree seeks to maximize its 'J. G. March and H. A.

If, in fact, the behavior of the tree is such as to resolve conflict over a scarce resource (sunlight) so as to maximize total exposure, there is no reason why we cannot impute such a goal to a tree. Moreover, there may be many reasons why we would want to do so. The usual objection to the imputation of a superordinate goal to conflict systems other than the human organism (or perhaps animals generally) is a curious one. Any such effort bears the onus of anthropomorphism. Yet insofar as a goal is simply an inferred rule for allocating resources, it is no more unique to anthropoids than is change of state. In the tree example, in fact, it can be argued that the concept of a goal is (under the assumed conditions) a more powerful tool for studying trees than it is for studying hu- man beings. It permits us to make predictions about a variety of important phenomena (e.g., the location and movement of leaves and branches). The tree example suggests two necessary conditions for effective use of an imputed superordinate goal in the construction of a theory. First, the goal must be stable (or at least change in a predictable way). Second, the goal must be meaningful. If the goal is not meaningful, it cannot be used for predictive purposes and simply becomes a restatement of the axiom that the system always chooses the most preferred alternative. A goal of maximizing subjective utility can, for example, be imputed to any system; but the imputa- tion is largely useless unless operational meaning that is independ- ent of the choices studied can be given to subjective utility. If the goal is not stable, the axioms underlying the importance of a super- ordinate goal are largely futile since the theory can only be applied a posteriori. The description of a conflict resolution process. Just as any system that "behaves" can be described as having a superordinate goal, it can also be described as having a conflict resolving process. If we adopt the process approach to a conflict system, we do not attempt to identify a joint preference ordering with respect to the ultimate decision. We replace the axioms of superordinate goals with two different assumptions. First, we assume that the ultimate decision results from a series of elementary deci-</page><page sequence="7">668 ITE JOURNAL OF POLIrCS [VOL. 24 sions. Second, we assume that some sort of joint preference order- ing exists for the elementary decisions. If we consider the case of the tree again, it is clear that we can describe the tree in terms of a conflict resolution process. In fact, this is apparently the more common theoretical tool. We might, for example, stipulate a series of elementary decisions by individual leaves that, taken together, allocate sunshine to the various parts of the tree. Furthermore, we might be able to demonstrate the con- sistency of the process and a particular superordinate goal. This would be true, for example, if we could demonstrate that the ele- mentary leaf decisions necessarily resulted in an ultimate allocation that maximized total exposure for the tree. The botanical invisible hand as it were. The usual objection to a process description of a conflict system is its tendency to become analytically grotesque. A large elm tree has more than a million leaves on it. Even if we had a theory of leaf decision making and could (conceptually) link leaf decisions to an aggregate exposure allocation, it is not easy to see how we analyze such a system. Thus, two necessary conditions for effective use of a process description in the development of a theory for conflict systems are (1) that the elementary decision processes be susceptible to treat- ment as consistent basic units, and (2) that analytic procedures be available with which to explore the properties of the model. The first is required to make the theory well-defined; the second is re- quired to permit the theory to make meaningful predictions. Studies of the firm as an economic conflict system. Economic treatment of the firm as a conflict system is heavily influenced by the fact that the firm in economic theory is more commonly treated as the basic unit of a larger conflict system (in- dustry, market, economic system) than as a conflict system itself. As a result, the economic theory of the firm is almost invariably constructed by explicitly imputing a superordinate goal to the con- flict system represented by a business firm. In its classic form the theory asserts that the objective of the firm is to maximize long-run expected profits. The objective is accomplished by determining an output to be produced given a production function, a cost function, and a price. Given a set of factor prices, the firm determines the</page><page sequence="8">1962] BUSINESS FIRM AS POLITICAL COALITION 669 minimum cost factor mix and the optimum output. Theories of imperfect competition are primarily modifications of this basic struc- ture and do not change the basic approach. In the main, they modify the market structure faced by the firm or introduce new decision variables (e.g., price). Thus, the economic theory of the firm assumes a joint preference ordering for the firm. In the standard form, that joint preference ordering is defined by profit maximization. Such a characterization of business firm objectives has been subject to more or less continu- ous minority attack. Part of that attack we can ignore for present purposes. It stems from some misgivings about the social welfare implications of profit maximization as a goal. The other source of the attack is more critical, however. It suggests that a theory as- suming a profit maximization goal is a poor predictive theory. Con- sequently, in some attempts at revision, profit maximization is re- placed by a more general utility function9 or by an alternative goal (e.g., revenue maximization).10 In some revisions the preference ordering is a partial rather than complete ordering." For the most part, the theory suppresses as outside its domain the process by which an organization composed of a rather complex mixture of people with considerable heterogeneity of individual goals generates a single preference ordering. It is assumed that conflict is resolved by the employment contract, or-more generally-by the factor prices and that the result is a joint preference ordering of some sort or other. This implicit assumption that the firm represents a conflict sys- tem susceptible to useful description in terms of a superordinate goal (whether profit maximization or some other) is shared by most economists. It is apparently convenient for the construction of theories of macro-economic systems. Most economic theories build upon it (although not all necessarily depend upon it). It is relative- ly amenable to theoretical manipulation. It lends itself to the geometry and calculus familiar to economic thought. Nevertheless, the assumption is almost certainly wrong as a micro-description of a business firm. It was proved extremely dif- A. Papandreau, "Some Basic Problems in the Theory of the Firm," in B. F.

Simon, The New Science of Management Decision (New York, 1961).</page><page sequence="9">670 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [VOL. 24 ficult to define a superordinate goal for a business firm that meets the two technical requirements of stability and meaningfulness as well as the empirical requirement of validity. Generally speaking, profit maximization can be made perfectly meaningful (with some qualifications); but when mwade meaningful, it usually turns out to be invalid as a description of firm behavior. To achieve validity, we can substitute utility maximization; but this turns out to be either not stable or not meaningful. Thus, Machlup, who set out to save the profit maximization assumption be generalizing it to utility maximization, ended by reducing it largely to a definition12 insofar as a micro theory is concerned. With few exceptions, modern ob- servers of actual firm behavior report persistent and significant con- tradictions between firm behavior and the classical assumptions.'3 Despite their inadequacies, the assumptions have persisted. They have persisted for a simple but compelling reason. The alter- native mode of theory-the process description of a conflict system -also has generally failed to satisfy its technical requirements. Until quite recently, case descriptions of the decision process in a business firm had approximately the same impact on a theorist of economic behavior as experiments on ESP had on a theorist of hu- man perception. They were horror stories. They tended to demon- strate that there existed some unexplained variance in received theories. They did not provide us devices for reducing the variance. No matter how much we might think we knew about the decision process within the firm, we had no analytical apparatus for deal- ing with a process model. Such a disability means that few of the implications of the process could be determined except by direct observation and that a revised theory of the firm could not satisfac- torily be grafted to existing economic theory. For most economists, such difficulties have seemed of decisive importance. Studies of political conflict systems. Whatever the reason may be, analytical disabilities appear to have had less impact on the development of political science than 12F.

There is no political theory in the sense in which there is economic theory; and with only a few exceptions, little effort has been made to develop analytically tractable theories of political conflict systems. Generally speaking, there has been little pressure for simplification comparable to the pressure for simplifica- tion in the theory of the firm imposed by the needs of aggregation. The major exception (and only a partial one) is the study of inter- national relations. In some treatments of bargaining among nation states, attempts have been made to characterize the behavior of the individual states in terms of simple models analogous in a loose way to the marginalist assumptions of economic theory.14 Most conspicuous by its absence in most of the modern litera- ture on political conflict resolution is the imputation of a super- ordinate goal to political organizations. Except for some students of international relations, most modern observers have viewed con- cepts of the "general will," "national interest," or the "common interest" as unsatisfactory concepts in the development of a theory of how political systems behave. "Public interest" as a theoretical tool suffers from the standard problems of superordinate goals. It is almost impossible to make it simultaneously meaningful, stable, and valid. Because of such difficulties and because the existence of unresolved conflict is conspicuous in political systems, students of such systems have moved heavily toward process descriptive case studies of specific political organizations or decisions. By and large, these case studies have not yielded a set of theoretical propositions on which there is general agreement. The richness of specific case detail has tended to emphasize the uniqueness of the cases rather than contribute to theoretical model building. Nevertheless, the basic outline of a process-oriented political theory of conflict resolution can be detected.'5 The theory assumes that there exist various interest groups in the system and that these groups make various demands. It further assumes that decisions within the system on the allocation of resources (i.e., in response to demands) are made by coalitions of interest groups and that each potential coalition has a certain potential control over the system. The process postulated is one in which a broker-the politician- 14A. Rapoport, "Lewis Richard's Mathematical Theory of War," Journal of Conflict Resolution, 1 (1957), 249-299. "For, example, see D.

Lindblom, Politics, Economics, and Welfare (New York, 1953).</page><page sequence="11">672 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [VOL. 24 attempts to organize a coalition of interests that is viable (that is, one in which the demands are less than or equal to the resources available to the coalition). The theory ordinarily highlights phe- nomena such as bargaining, compromise, negotiation, inconsistency, and more or less continual conflict. In the descriptions of political systems there is an emphasis of power, internal struggle, and expedi- ency; a de-emphasis of order, cooperation, and problem solving. Insofar as the interest group theory of political decision making is a theory, it is a theory with modest analytic pretensions but rather impressive generality as a framework for observation. Most recent students of political organizations accept it in one form or another despite the obvious fact that the theory neither is particu- larly well-defined nor has a particularly powerful language. Thus, where the economic theory of the firm has moved to the imputation of a superordinate goal in order to gain analytic simplicity, the political theory of decision making has moved to process descrip- tion in order to gain empirical validity. THE FRMM AS A POLITICAL COALITION The choice between an analytically elegant but empirically sterile theory on the one hand and an empirically fecund but analyt- ically crude theory on the other is hardly a happy choice. Nor, I think, any longer a necessary one. To illustrate, let me outline a revised theory of the business firm and particularly a revised theory of the goals of a business firm. It is a theory that in some respects is more pristinely classic than many currently conventional economic conceptions of the firm, but it also bears a rather close relationship to current conceptions of political conflict systems. It is a theory that R. M. Cyert and I have used in developing some behavioral models of business firm decision making.16 Basically, we assume that a business firm is a political coalition and that the executive in the firm is a political broker. The com- position of the firm is not given; it is negotiated. The goals of the firm are not given; they are bargained. We assume that there is a set of potential participants in the firm. At least initially, we think of such classes of potential partici- pants as investors (stockholders), suppliers, customers, governmental agents, and various types of employees. More realistically, we 16Cyert and March, op. cit.</page><page sequence="12">1962] BUSINESs FnIM AS POLITICAL COALITION 673 might supplement such a list with such actual or potential partici- pants as investment analysts, trade associations, political parties, and labor unions. Each potential participant makes demands on the system. These demands are essentially the price required for participation in the coalition. The demands are partly in the form of payments commonly assumed in economic theories (e.g., money) but they also are partly in the form of demands for policy commit- ments, personal treatment, etc. Thus, each set of demands can be characterized as having some degree of consistency with each com- bination of other demands. Some pairs of demands may be strictly inconsistent (under no circumstances can they both be satisfied). Some pairs of demands may be more or less consistent depending on external conditions (e.g., so long as the resources available to the coalition are substantial they may be consistent). Some pairs of demands may be completely complementary (e.g., if one demand is satisfied so also is the other one necessarily and without additional resource expenditure). As a result of this complementarity, we can describe the marginal "cost" of any participant to any given coal- ition. At the same time, we assume that the demands of the potential participants are subject to two important dynamic properties. First, the level of demands shifts in response to experience (both actual and vicarious). Second, attention to demands-the extent to which they are seen as relevant to action-shifts in response to the percep- tion of problems. We also assume that each possible coalition of participants has a certain "value" with respect to the environment involved. It can gain a certain return from that environment. Thus, an over-simple model of a governmental coalition in a parliamentary democracy might assume that any coalition including more than 50%0 of the voters would be able to do anything permissible within the system (thus would have maximum power) and that any coalition including less than 50%o of the voters would be able to do nothing (thus would have minimum power). In a similar way, alternative business coalitions can gain different returns from the economic system in which they operate; and we can (at least approximately) specify the marginal value of a particular given participant to a particular given coalition. One way (not the only one) of describing the theory is from the point of view of the executive. Assume that the executive wishes</page><page sequence="13">674 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [VOL. 24 to use the organization to maximize his own utility. His problem then is (insofar as he is able) to select a coalition so as to maximize the difference between the demands of his coalition members and the potential return from the environment of the coalition. The executive-political broker problem is twofold. On the one hand, he must select a coalition that has relatively low "costs" of maintenance and relatively high returns from the environment. On the other hand, he must so structure the payments made to coalition members as to make the shifts in demands conducive to increasing the differ- ence between total demands and total resources. The theory to this point becomes well-defined when we can specify the dimensions of participant demands, some measure of their complementarity, the functions by which they change over time, and the short run internal constraints on the bargaining process by which goals are formed. The terms "marginal cost" and "marginal value" suggest the sense in which this theory of business coalitions is close to classic economic views. Why do we describe the coalition involved as a political coalition? There are four critical ways in which the theory deviates from conventional economic views in the direction of a more "political" treatment. First, the focus of attention shifts from the owners (and their objectives) to the actual, operating organizers of the coalition- whoever they may be. In general, we view stockholders much as a theory of political systems might view citizens. Their demands form loose constraints on the more active members of the coalition. Their initiative in policy formation and in determining the nature of the coalitions is small. Second, the theory emphasizes the non-uniqueness of short run solutions to the coalition problem. At any point in time, there are a number of possible coalitions that are viable (that is, their total value exceeds their total cost of maintenance). As in the case of most political theories, some of the more interesting features of the theory depend on short run deviations from a long run position of equilibrium. Third, the theory does not solve the problem of conflict by sim- ple payments to participants and agreement on a superordinate goal. Rather it emphasizes the importance of policy demands and pay- ments and of sequential rather than simultaneous mediation of demands. Fourth, the theory emphasizes the importance of institutional</page><page sequence="14">1962] BUSINESS Fnm AS POLITICAL COALITION 675 constraints on the solution of the coalition problem. Most conspic- uously there are constraints imposed (1) by the institutionalization of commitments through the organizational structure, precedents, and budgetary agreements, (2) by the reification of attachments through identification and indoctrination, and (3) by the limitations in co- ordination and control imposed on an executive. A theory of the business firm as a political coalition has both face validity and a certain amount of empirical support. In partic- ular, such a theory seems more consistent than other available theories with the following widely observed attributes of business decision making: 1. Organization goals seem to be a series of more or less inde- pendent constraints. 2. Business firms seem to tolerate a rather large amount of ap- parent inconsistency in goals and decisions, both over time and from one part of the organization to another. 3. Goals and decisions tend to be paired and decentralized with loose cross connections. 4. The extent to which decisions within the firm involve exten- sive conflict and "marginal" decisions varies with the munifi- cence of the environment. 5. The goals and commitments of business firms shift slowly over time in response to shifts in the coalition represented in the firm. The fact (if it is one) that a description of a business firm as a political coalition is a more valid description than the classic eco- nomic description of the firm as an entrepreneur does not, however, solve the theoretical dilemma posed by the classic problems of anal- ysis. For many years, economists as well as others have belabored the point that firms are organizations rather than entrepreneurs; only in the last few years have such strictures had any impact on the theory of the firm. Those students who were prepared to accept the evidence had no choice but to abandon not only the theory but also the field, since few of them were sympathetic intellectually with the journalist role implicit in the proliferation of case studies. In recent years, the introduction of the computer and the com- puter program model to the repertoire of the theorist has changed dramatically the theoretical potential of process description models of conflict systems. Complex process description models of organ-</page><page sequence="15">676 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [VOL. 24 izational behavior permit the development of a micro-economic theory of the firm. To illustrate, let me mention briefly three specific models: First, a model of discretionary pricing and ordering decisions in a large department store. Cyert, March, and Moore have been able to simulate quite well three kinds of pricing decisions: regular pricing, scheduled sale pricing, and markdown pricing. In addition, they have been able to predict the amount and timing of orders (both original orders and reorders) with (as nearly as can be deter- mined) reasonable accuracy.'7 Second, a model of output determination in a duopoly, the American Can industry. On the basis of a few theoretical assump- tions about differences between American and Continental Can Companies, Cyert, Feigenbaum, and March have been able to de- velop a model of decision-making within the industry. This model predicts quite well both the profit ratio of the two firms and their share of market over the 1913-1956 period.'8 Third, a general model of price and output determination. As a framework for other specific models and as a basis for investigation of the macro-economic implications of a behavioral theory of the firm (including the assumption that the firm is a political coalition), Cohen, Cyert, March, and Soelberg have developed a general model of price and output determination in a modern oligopoly. The model has not been fully analyzed, but preliminary results seem to indicate a general correspondence between the output of the model and em- pirical data.'9 Each of these models is written in the language of a computer program. All of them are process description models. Other com- parable models of organizational behavior built on assumptions that differ in detail but are generally process descriptive, are in various stages of development. Balderston and Hoggatt have developed a model of the wholesale lumber market.20 Howard has developed a model of another wholesale market.2' Clarkson has developed a 7Ibid. 1"Ibid. "'Ibid. '0F. E.

Process-descriptive, com- puter models are a natural form of theory in this area. As a result, theoretically oriented students of the firm can afford to take serious- ly the detailed case studies of conflict systems both economic and political. For example, the recent work on a behavioral theory of the firm described briefly above has drawn rather heavily on politi- cal concepts. Within these models, it has been possible to introduce such "political" features as unmediated conflict, multi-dimensional goals, and sequential attention to sub-unit pressures. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STUDY OF POLITICAL CONFLICT SYSTEMS With a few exceptions, studies of political conflict systems have been largely atheoretical or quasi-theoretical in the past. Lacking an adequate theoretical language, we have had to work within the confines of simple verbal formulations. Nevertheless, some of these formulations seem to contribute to an understanding of the oper- ation of the business firm, particularly when they are introduced into computer models of organizational decision making. In the context of such models, I think it is quite likely that we will be able to expose both the theory of the firm as a coalition and the theory of political coalitions in general to new analytic attention. Thus, we can identify three major implications for political science of recent research on the business firm as a decision making coalition: (1) Recent experience indicates that the business firm can plausibly be conceived as a political conflict system; indeed the firm provides a useful test of the extent to which political phenomena are modified by a non-governmental setting. (2) Successes with computer program models in the analysis of political systems within business firms support the view that computer programs provide 2"G. P. E.

(3) The apparent theoretical similarity between the political coalition in business and the political coalition in governmental or- ganizations suggests that the substantive features of recent behav- ioral models of the firm may be useful as a basis for comparable models of governmental decision making. Finally, we should identify the major theoretical job that remains to be done. Although they are adaptive in many respects, the models of firm decision making discussed above have not gone beyond the static implications of the fact that firms are political coalitions. Essentially they assert that certain phenomena occur in the firm because of its character as a coalition. They do not attempt to reflect shifts in coalitions per se. The latter task-leading to a more general theory of coalition development-has hardly been touched except conceptually. The significance of such a theory to a theory of the business firm and its growth is obvious. Even more obvious, however, is the significance of such a theory to the develop- ment of a theory of politics.</page></plain_text>
