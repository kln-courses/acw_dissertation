<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ARTICLES Kenosis and Action: A Review Article Sallie B. King Southern Illinois University Masao Abe's important essay, "Kenotic God and Dynamic Sunyata," forms the core of The Emptying God: A Buddhist-Jewish-Christian Conversation. ' Abe's essay first offers a radical interpretation of the nature of God and the nature of Sunyata, and then on that basis considers a host of related ethical issues includ- ing free will, the problem of evil, and the Holocaust. Seven eminent Christian and Jewish theologians-Thomas J. J. Altizer, Eugene Borowitz, John B. Cobb, Jr., Catherine Keller, Jurgen Moltmann, Schubert M. Ogden, and David Tracy-individually respond to Abe's essay. The inclusion of a feminist and a Jewish voice in the list of respondents significantly widens the scope of the con- versation. The book closes with Abe's rejoinder to the respondents. Supporting materials include separate introductory statements by the book's two editors and a bibliography of Masao Abe's works. Christopher Ives' "Intro- duction" is especially useful in providing a brief but fascinating intellectual and spiritual biography of Abe. Abe himself emphasizes that he brings his own existential background into the dialogue along with his intellectual heritage and skills, and many of the respondents comment on the importance of this fact for the exchange. Given this context, it would have been appropriate as well as helpful to the readers if the editors had also included brief biographical statements for the respondents in the volume, including at least an account of their major religious and intellectual commitments and scholarly accomplish- ments. Perhaps this can become standard in future volumes in the Orbis "Faith Meets Faith" series. Since the book does record a conversation, albeit one involving significant time lapses, I shall review it as such and focus on the two main dialogical themes rather than on the separate contributions of the authors. I. KENOTIC CHRIST AND KENOTIC GOD This theme constitutes the heart of Abe's outreach to Christianity from his Buddhist perspective. On the basis of Philippians 2, Abe emphasizes an under- standing of Christ in which God's incarnation as Christ is manifest in his com- Buddhist-Christian Studies 12 (1992). ? by University of Hawaii Press.

The self-emptying or kenosis is itself what makes him Christ. Abe puts this understanding of Christ in a form characteristic of Buddhist logic: The Son of God is not the Son of God (for he is essentially and fundamen- tally self-emptying): precisely because he is not the Son of God he is truly the Son of God (for he originally and always works as Christ, the Messiah, in his salvational function of self-emptying). (p. 1 1) Abe argues that Christ's kenosis originates in God "the Father," in the will of God and the love of God, and thus not only Christ, but God also, is kenotic or self-emptying. Kenosis is the fundamental nature of God; God's self-emptying also is absolute: "God is God, not because God had the Son of God take a human form and be sacrificed while God remained God, but because God is a suffering God, a self-sacrificial God through total kenosis" (p. 16). And: God is not God (for God is love and completely self-emptying); precisely because God is not a self-affirmative God, God is truly a God of love. . . . (p. 16) All the Christian respondents, of course, respond at some length to Abe's kenotic God concept (except John Cobb, who limits himself here to remarks regarding Buddhism). Of the respondents, Altizer approves most unreservedly of Abe's suggestion that the solution to the challenge of irreligion-for Altizer, the modern world in which God is dead-is the ultimate conceived as absolute nothingness. For him, since God conceived as "transcendent transcendence" is no longer possible, perhaps such a conception can be replaced by God con- ceived as ubiquitous "immanent transcendence" reached by "an opening to absolute emptiness itself, an emptiness that is the very center of what the radi- cal modern Christian has known as the Crucifixion of God" (p. 77). Keller, on the other hand, is more concerned about fundamentalism than about the death of God. In her mind, "Abe's proposal would . . . appear to the normal Chris- tian to be nothing but a thinly disguised atheism" (p. 104). Ogden is the respondent who most strongly rejects Abe's vision of the nature of God as a possibility for Christianity. In Ogden's view, Abe is guilty of impos- ing Buddhism upon Christianity and of producing a concept of God that "is not only not necessarily implied by Christian faith but also necessarily pre- cluded by it" insofar as Christian faith is faith in God's unconditional love, and this, in turn, requires both deep relatedness and duality (pp. 129-130). Moltmann and Tracy both accept more of Abe's proposal than Ogden but less than Altizer. Both find something of critical importance in the kenotic God idea but stress the importance, in Christianity, of going beyond language of kenosis to language of relationship, manifestation, and Trinity. Moltmann</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW ARTICLES 257 affirms that for him the kenosis passage is "the most impressive and touching passage in the Bible" (p. 118). However, he criticizes Abe's understanding of the Trinity and endorses instead his own "social doctrine of Trinity": The Son does not exist in himself, but by virtue of his unselfish love entirely in the Father. The Father does not exist in himself, but by virtue of his unselfish love entirely in the Son. The Holy Spirit does not exist in itself, but entirely in the Father and the Son. So the three persons are by virtue of the essential surrendering different and yet entirely one. . . . It is the divine being of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit to surrender entirely to the other person and in this way to achieve self-realization only in the other persons. (p. 119) Clearly, there is kenosis at the heart of this conception, but more stress upon interpersonal relationship or community than in Abe's view. Tracy questions the appropriateness for Christianity of Abe's construal of the One God (the Godhead) as "the great zero." While Abe identifies the nature of this zero as the Nichts or Ungrund of Meister Eckhart and Jakob Bohme, Tracy compares Eckhart to Ruuysbroec and finds the language of the latter more adequate for Christianity. In the Christian construal, the most radical negations of the cloud of unknowing and the acknowledgment of nothingness must, through its own power of awareness, yield to the self-manifestation . . . of the Divine Reality. . . . (p. 150) Thus Christian spirituality moves through negation to manifestation, and Ruuysbroec expresses this best. "Insofar as Christians experience Godself as Source, Logos, and Spirit they find their central insight into God's own reality as always self-manifesting" (p. 150). Abe responds to this analysis with enthusiasm: Neither my understanding of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity nor my interpretation of the Buddhist notion of dynamic Suinyata is as clearly dialectical as Ruuysbroec's standpoint. Buddhists will be able to learn many things from Tracy's dialectical interpretation of the Christian Trinity. (p. 164) Abe does not mention the Buddhist notion of the Thusness or Suchness (tathat2) that becomes manifest on the other side of realization of empiness, though it seems a natural parallel to Tracy's image of nothingness yielding to self-manifestation "through its own power of awareness." Likewise, when Tracy challenges Abe to clarify how dynamic Sunyata "discloses itself as wisdom and as compassion" (p. 149), Abe mentions the Buddhist Trikaya, or three-bodies, notion. Another obvious possibility here, and one in fact that must be consid-</page><page sequence="4">258 REVIEW ARTICLES ered, is the notion of Buddha nature, a true self which is "no self' and yet spontaneously manifests in acts of wisdom and compassion. II. SUNYATA AND ETHICS Abe attempts to make Buddhist Suinyata more ethically relevant by articulating a notion of "dynamic Suinyata," which is the "pure activity of emptying" of the "true self" realized in the present moment (p. 28). It is not an end or goal but "the ground or the point of departure from which Buddhist life amd activ- ity can properly begin" (p. 33). Abe outlines the positive, soteriological char- acter of Suinyata so conceived, and carefully considers in this context Christian and Western criticisms of Buddhist accounts of human reason, free will, and the problem of evil. This discussion climaxes in Abe's proposal of a Buddhist "ultimate criterion of value judgment": "This judgment is to be made in terms of whether or not a thing or action in question does accord with the vow and act to make one's self and all others awakened" (p. 58). In his rejoiner, Abe acknowledges "my treatment of Suinyata received a more negative response than my treatment of the 'kenotic God' " (p. 173). Readers of the volume should be aware, however, of the really great significance for Buddhist philosophy of Abe's development of Buddhist ethical thought. As Cobb ironically notes, "the attachment of Buddhists to nondiscrimination" is a deep problem in Buddhism (p. 101), especially for the Zen school which Abe represents. In particular, Zen Buddhists are averse to discrimination between good and evil. In this context, for Abe to propose an actual criterion of value judgment in a rational formulation is radical indeed. As Cobb remarks, the rationalization of Buddhist ethics is extremely important for the modernization of Buddhism and the development of its potential to contribute to the resolu- tion of our various modern crises. Generally speaking, most of the respondents welcomed Abe's ethical reflec- tions but urged him to deepen and extend his analysis. Some expressed much greater dissimilarity of vision. Borowitz expressed the greatest incommensura- bility of all the respondents between his tradition, Judaism, and Abe's Bud- dhism. There are two main points here. First, Borowitz sees Abe's Buddhism as emphasizing wisdom or knowledge whereas his own Judaism emphasizes living the holy/good life. While they agree with Fackenheim that the Holocaust is for Jews "a radical rupture in history," Abe takes this as a radical rupture of thought, whereas Borowitz takes it as a radical rupture in "the Jewish people's very Convenant with God and the way of life it authorizes" (p. 80). The goal is Tikkun, the mending of human history, to be "attained by how one (everyone) lives, not primarily by what understanding they achieve" (p. 81). The second point follows from the first. "ForJudaism, the primary human task is creating holiness through righteous living." But for Abe, Borowitz notes, this "is only the second level of the three dimensions of his thought" (p. 82), the third and ultimate level being the "transhuman fundamental</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW ARTICLES 259 dimension represented by religious faith or awakening" (Abe, p. 46). "By con- trast," says Borowitz, in the classic Jewish understanding, . . . God is holy-and that means, most closely, that God is good. There is nothing more ultimate. And because God is holy/good, Jews are to be holy/good, which means to do holy/good deeds and create a holy/good human order. . .." (p. 82) Abe responds, "I admire such faith and hope, but my personal existential experience does not allow me to accept this sort of faith and hope as realistic" (p. 188). This seems to be a dead end. More constructively, Abe and Borowitz have an absorbing exchange regard- ing whether the evil of the Holocaust is "absolute." While Borowitz rejects Abe's account on the ground that it relativizes that evil too much, Abe points out that his refusal to "absolutize" the Holocaust is an attempt to "solve the problem of the Holocaust without falling into an endless dilemma of hatred and counter-hatred" (p. 187). Perhaps there is room for further discussion here. Cobb endorses the direction of Abe's ethical thought, but urges him to go further in the confidence that "Buddhism is quite capable of taking further steps that would meet" his criticisms (p. 92). He argues that Abe's ethics pays insufficient attention to the particular, that while interconnection is universally true, Buddhists should overcome their "unwillingness to consider what particu- lar things and events are of primary importance in the dependent arising of a particular moment" (p. 95). Regarding Abe's analysis of free will, Cobb criti- cizes the Buddhist tendency to value negatively all acts of decision and urges that they develop a Buddhist parallel to the Christian ideal of deciding "in accordance with the promptings of the Spirit." For Buddhists, this might be a "spontaneous form of decision in which the decision conforms effortlessly to the primal vow in its concrete meaning for the present situation" (p. 98). Regarding human reason, Buddhist insight into interconnectedness should be extended by serious examination of "what differentiates one entity from another, and the differentiated patterns of relations among them" (p. 101). This would make possible important Buddhist contributions to ethics and the natural and social sciences (p. 100). Like Borowitz, Keller's response to Abe's work comes from a direction he had unanticipated. He acknowledges in a friendly way her criticism that he had "not even the faintest feminist concern" in her essay (p. 102). However, between Keller and Abe there is not the incommensurability that there was between Borowitz and Abe. Keller makes some trenchant criticisms of Abe's work but also lists specific ways in which Buddhist-Christian dialogue, and Abe's work in particular, enhances the feminist project. Keller, alone among the respondents, raises an important concern regarding the social and psychological effects of Abe's stress on kenosis.</page><page sequence="6">260 REVIEW ARTICLES When he highlights the self-sacrificial, self-humbling, and obedient aspects of agape, he continues a strong heritage of Christian herme- neutics. . . . But unfortunately it is with just this aspect of the tradition that feminist theologians have had their longest-running quarrel.... The call to agapic self-sacrifice may indeed provide the proper corrective to the hypertrophic masculine ego. . . . But women sin in the opposite and complementary direction: that of the underdevelopment of the self. (p. 105) Of course, as Nietzsche pointed out, it is not women alone for whom the emphasis on selflessness (in Buddhism as well as in Christianity) is a problem. Abe heeds Keller's criticism, stating that "it is urgently necessary for us to erad- icate this negative effect of the teaching of selflessness" but wants to avoid hav- ing this "lead to an undermining of the ideal of selflessness" (p. 196). How it might be possible to prevent the familiar social-political consequences of this spiritual ideal Abe does not say, though he does, at Keller's instigation, develop a quite fascinating discussion of the relationship between the goods of no self, self-development, and self-sacrifice. In my view, this is a crucial issue persistently raised by feminists, and urgently calling for more input, like Abe's, from the Buddhist side. Much of what Buddhism offers feminism is, for Keller, of simultaneously positive and negative value. Keller stresses the significance for feminists of the Buddhist metaphysic of interconnectedness, a perspective which feminists share. Feminists' inclination to appropriate Buddhist insight is limited, how- ever, since "for Buddhism this interdependency . . . functions as a radically deconstructive analysis, [whereas] for feminism it functions as our most radi- cally constructive vision" (p. 108). Keller, like Cobb, offers Abe a reading of Buddhism which might enhance Abe's project, arguing that it is "precisely because of our interpermeation that ethical considerations matter" and sug- gesting that we conceive evil to be "the effect upon the network of relation- ships of an individual or systemic denial of interrelatedness itself" (p. 110). Straightforwardly positive contributions of Buddhism and of Abe to the fem- inist project cited by Keller include the following. (1) Abe's emphasis on keno- sis empties "deity of its anthropomorphic (andromorphic) projections" and "relieves christology at once of its exclusivism and of its triumphalism" (p. 111). (2) Feminists affirm eros, body, and emotion, but in the past this affirma- tion has tended to be too uncritical. Surprisingly, perhaps, Keller believes Bud- dhist analysis of and practice with emotion can help feminists to look more deeply at these matters. (3) Keller urges social activists to ground their activism in some kind of meditative praxis, and specifically endorses Buddhist mindful- ness practice as appropriate. In this she echoes Thich Nhat Hanh and, signifi- cantly, shows that in Buddhist-Christian dialogue, learning on ethics is not uni- directional. There is no space even to mention the many other significant points and per-</page><page sequence="7">REVIEW ARTICLES 261 spectives raised by the contributors to this volume. I hope that I have said enough to convey a sense of the richness of this book, the importance of its con- cerns, and the quality of its exchange. It is certainly essential reading for anyone interested in Buddhist-Christian dialogue. I will conclude simply by applaud- ing the dialogical tone exemplified by Masao Abe and his respondents in this book. NOTE 1. The Emptying God: A Buddhist-Jewish-Christian Conversation, ed. John B.
