<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reminiscences of an Aloe Enthusiast By G. W. REYNOLDS Photographs bv the Author Conclusion ON hotel one after occasion dark, I arrived and booked at a certain in. I had small the roadside worst hotel after dark, and booked in. I had the worst possible dirty old torn jacket and slouch hat on, and being too impatient to wait until morning to try to find where A . humilis grew, I walked out of the hotel with a torch, sack, and small pick in my hands. I returned near midnight, having found what I sought, and slept soundly, leaving early next morning. It was not until I revisited the place a few months later that I was informed that the proprietor and his wife had spent a most anxious evening. They considered I could be up to no good with a pick, torch, and sack late at night, and concluded I must be a typical Johannesburg criminal, so their wardrobe had been pushed up against the interleading door, and the old man had kept a shot gun handy all night. They had been relieved to see the last of me after break- fast. When I explained the real purpose of my previous visit, they looked at me with incredulous eyes. Being an amateur, and not a professional botanist, has its advantages, and I have been able to approach the subject unfettered by prejudices. Not having been born with a silver spoon in my mouth, and having to earn my living - whether I like it or not - has involved having to do two whole-time jobs at once, by working faster and cutting down sleep. It has meant that speed was of paramount importance. Obstacles had to be ruthlessly brushed aside. There was no time for illnesses. So much depends on one's state of mind and mental attitude. As far as one's body is concerned I firmly believe that the best thing to do is to feed it, clothe it, wash it - and forget it. Trips to secure data and photographs had to be planned to occupy the least possible time, and the car was frequently pushed to the limit of its capacity. As an example, on one occasion, in order to secure material for a colour plate of A. thraskii , I left Johannesburg at 8 a.m., and arrived at Isipingo Beach, south of Durban (420 miles) at 6 p.m. Next morning I photographed A. thraskii and left at 9 a.m. for home, arriving at 7 p.m. Many trips had to be organised at speed, since I could not leave my optical business for long. One of the memorable trips was a round-the-Union dash in July, 1948. On that occasion I had the good fortune to have a true lover of South Africa and its flora, Dr. N. R. Smuts, as my companion, and we travelled hard and fast. Westwards we sped to Upington, Keimoes (where magnificent flowering specimens of A. dichotoma occur) Springbok and Port Nolloth, a thousand miles away, on the Atlantic. From Port Nolloth northwards to Grootderm and Hells Kloof we continued, and at long last I secured colour plates of rare Aloes in those regions which had been missed on previous journeys. We returned ALOE MUTABILIS on sheer rock face at Witpoortje Falls, near Krugersdorp, Transvaal 34</page><page sequence="2">to Port Nolloth, and drove southwards to Kleinsee to photograph A. arenicola , and thereby hangs a tale. Only one plant of A. arenicola, with flowers, was found growing amidst dried brushwood. I instructed our "boy" to be extra careful not to damage the flowers when clearing the twigs away, but when I looked up after unpacking the cameras, lo and behold the flower spike had been broken in two. It was exasperating after having travelled so far. I must have said something suitable to the occasion, since I noticed Dr. Smuts walking discreetly away with his fingers pressed to his ears. However, with the aid of a match, the peduncle was "repaired" and remained erect just long enough for me to get a colour shot of it. Proceeding via breath-taking Spektakel Pass to Springbok, we continued southward to Khamieskroon for A. khamiesensis , and on to Cape Town in the hopes of getting A. succotrina. Three previous visits had been fruitless, but on this occasion plants were flowering well at the very summit of the Karbonkelberg, near Hout Bay, and I secured a grand colour shot in clear sunlight. At long last the Aloes book would contain a colour plate of A. succotrina in its natural home - so I thought. We hurried over to Paarl and Du Toi≈•s Kloof, where I spotted a lovely early- flowering specimen of the unique "Fan Aloe" A. plicatilis. This was duly photographed with the One Shot camera, but when I tried to replace one of the slides, I found to my horror that I had inadvertently pulled out the back slide, and not the front one, and by doing so had ruined the lovely shot of A. succotrina. So we turned back and slept at Hout Bay. It rained all night, and not withstanding heavy rain in the morning, way up to the summit of Karbonkelberg we went again, the fifth time for me. The rain continued and when, after some hours of waiting in the rain, there was no hope of the weather clearing, I had to abandon it. And that is the reason why no colour plate of this classical species, so swathed in history, is included in the book. From Cape Town, Dr. Smuts and I journeyed to Worcester, Swellendam, Mossel Bay, Willowmore, Somerset East, Grahamstown, Umtata, Kokstad and Pietermaritzburg to Greytown and Muden, where countless thousands of A. mudenensis put up a glorious display of massed colours in July. From Muden we travelled to Dundee, Vryheid and Louwsburg, then home to Johannesburg. The trip of 4,000 miles was completed in 20 days, and was responsible for about 30 of the colour plates now included in the book. It was a "now or never" trip, but for once the weather was perfect throughout - except for Karbonkelberg and A . succotrina - and various species were flowering well. I made up for previous failures by securing all but one of the colour plates I had hoped for, plus two I never expected. Every one of the 77 colour plates in the book has its story, but one cannot recount them all here. I have collected and photographed plants on a large number of farms throughout South Africa, and have always asked permission whenever a farmhouse was in sight. I have received the utmost help from farmers, in fact, a more kindly, lovable, and warm-hearted person than the average Afrikaner "backvelder" would be difficult to meet. ^ LISBON FALLS - an Aloe locality six miles north of Graskop, Eastern Transvaal 35</page><page sequence="3">So, after many years of toil, after much burning of midnight oil, and often burning the candle at both ends, the "Aloes of South Africa" has at last seen the light of day. I am grateful to all who have helped in the task, and perhaps most of all to my wife who never complained, when left to care for herself and the children alone while I was away. She has been an unfailing source of encouragement and inspiration, and I am grateful. I am also grateful to the "Cape Times Ltd." for producing the book so well. Their excellent printing and superb colour reproductions leave nothing to be desired and equal anything which can be produced overseas. I had the privilege of visiting their modernly equipped 9-acre factory at Parow, near Cape Town; it was an education, and an inspiration for the future. The "Fishes" book, now the "Aloes" book, the forthcoming "Mammals" book, and "The Wild Flowers of the Cape of Good Hope" will testify to the modern printing facilities now fortunately available to science in South Africa. It is no longer necessary to consider going overseas for the ultimate in modern printing and colour work. I have been asked whether I will now "rest on my laurels". The answer is: no so-called laurel is worth resting on. An anthropomorphic halo is a pretty useless thing, it has only to drop a few inches to become a noose. Besides (as my wife reminds me) only dead wood drifts down stream, and there is much more to do. Any plans for the future ? Yes, at the moment I am toying with the idea of producing a book of Transvaal Wild Flowers, in which as many Transvaal flowering plants as possible will be illustrated in natural colours as they grow wild. Such lovely things at Streptocarpus, Dierama, Water Lilies, Barberton Daisies, Watsonias, Crinums, Brunsvegias, Ammocharis, Bauchinia, Erythrinas, not forgetting a few Aloes, lend themselves admirably to colour plate making. The wonderful wild flowers of the Cape have been abundantly popularised ; the time is opportune for similar treatment of the Transvaal's floral gems. The Aloes of South Africa are also in need of attention, but that gigantic task is in the lap of the gods.
