<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH REALIZED HY THE CZECHOSLOVAK EXPEDITION TO EGYPT IX 1981 During I lie 13th expedition of the Czechoslovak Egyp tological Institute of the Charles I uiversity in Prague, uncarlhig further objects in the so-called "southern field" in Ahusir near Cairo 1 processed the anthropological mate rials collected from the same site during the 1976, 1978 and 1980/1981 digging seasons. They include in the first place the human skeletal remains for which these burial objects were built in the period of the Fifth-Dynasty. They have been preserved only in the mastaba (tomb) of Princess Chekeretnebti, the daughter of the last but one king of the 5th Dynasty Dje karé Isési (about the year 2450 B.C.). Beside the proprietor of the mastaba, a 30—35 years old woman of extremely gracile stature, a tomb attached to the mastaba served as 187</page><page sequence="2">the burial place for Tisethor a 16 years old girl. Her skeletal remains had been smashed and scattered in the tomb and it was necessary to reconstruct them. Our study was focused on comparing the skeletal remains of the two individuals, namely their metric, descriptive and epigenetic characters, and the blood group to which they belong will be added later. The purpose of the study is lo prove or to dismiss possible relationship between these two historical perso nalities. Around the mastaba of Princess Chekeretnebti and around the adjoining mastabas, namely in the overlying strata containing material from the destroyed endowment temple of Queen Chentkawes, a Targe number of secondary burials from the post-Fifth Dynasty period have been unearthed. The deads were buried in most cases in simple anthropomorphic wooden coffins, llieir heads oriented mostly to the west and containing only amulets and modest personal belongings, especially ornaments. They were not mummified, some of them were wrapped in bandages and have been preserved in skeletized state. They belonged without any doubt to the popular layers from the nearby farming village. Most of these burials have been dated according to the coffins to the Late Period (26th — 30th Dynasties) and to the begining of the Greek Rule. They contain the remains of 64 individuals, namely of 30 adult males, 22 females and 12 children. Further 6 individuals (3 males and 3 females) come from burials dated to the end of the New Empire (12th and early 11th century B. C.) and 2 individuals (both males) were buried in the Roman Period (30 B. C.—395 A. D.). Besides recording the usual anthropometric, descriptive and epigenetic characteristics special attention was paid to the detection of pathological changes. Among a series of diagnoses we found further cases of osteolythic foci inside the cranial vault. They lack uni form ethiology; in one case, however it is undoubtedly the result of malignant tumours, either of carcinomatous mé tastasé, or of myeloma multiplex. Eugen Strouhal</page></plain_text>
