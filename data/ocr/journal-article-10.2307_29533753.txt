Lawrence, Fantasia of the Unconscious "If in the present work I have dwelt at length on trees..." -Sir James Frazer, The Golden Bough "There wants a man about the place." -D. H. Lawrence, The Fox As any cumulative index of articles and citations on Lawrence's work suggests, no short fiction by him has received as much sustained consideration by critics through the years as The Fox. This voluminous criticism encompasses a wide variety of subject material and methodology, including a range of opinion concerning such topics as the open-ended conclusion of the novella, the relevance of the purported models for the major characters, and the success of the work as fictional art.l Surprisingly little attention has centered on the subtle reiteration and development in imagery and motivation that inform the characterizations of March, Banford, and Henry. This relative disregard of thematic pattern and stylistic repetition explains the perplexity and discomfort of many commentators over the uncertain ending of the work, as March and Henry nervously contemplate their decision to leave England and travel across the Atlantic. There exists no in-depth and linear study of The Fox that attempts to analyze organized patterns of Lawrence's techniques and doctrines Studies in the Novel, Volume 38, number 2 (Summer 2006).

Perhaps the most significant area of neglect involves the lack of relevant biographical and intertextual material on Lawrence's personal and aesthetic preoccupations as he moves from the unambiguous and tightly resolved tale to the more ambitious novella.3 When Lawrence began redrafting The Fox in the late fall of 1921, he had just completed final revisions on Fantasia of the Unconscious. That often dyspeptic and exhortatory volume of "pollyanalytics" {Fantasia 65) offers an elaboration of Lawrence's theories about such topics as sexuality, parenting, education, marriage, and the unconscious; the work is integrated by Lawrence's pervasive interest in the struggle between emotion and intellect that has preoccupied Western culture for centuries. At the center of his argument is a highly charged and cranky attack on Freudian theory. Lawrence asserts, in effect, that Freud dangerously rationalized erotic life and thus seriously underestimated the visionary and religious stimulus in human beings, a primal motivation that Lawrence insists must function irrationally, erotically and above ail-preeminently over the intellect. Philip Rieff eloquently described the oppositional stakes forty years ago: "Lawrence knew intuitively, if not historically, that reason defends mainly against impulse, and against what he considered the legitimate and undeniable power of love" (iii). Because of Lawrence's outspoken emphasis on instinct and on the existential primacy of the five senses, it is no surprise that he held Frazer's The Golden Bough in high esteem, given that monumental work's unpsychoanalytical inquiry into primitive habits, beliefs, and rituals, all part of a broad and impressive scholarship by Frazer that involved him in a complex and detailed outline of myths, symbols, and taboos enacted in a variety of pre-industrial societies.4 Lawrence maintains that "knowledge must be symbolical, mythical, dynamic," and that "symbols must be true from top to bottom" {Fantasia 113). He first read The Golden Bough in the fall and winter of 1915-16, and he referred to it in the newly added Foreword to Fantasia of the Unconscious (62) as a major influence on his own visionary perspective. As he began sustained work on revisions of The Fox, he recently had read his friend Barbara Low's be ok on Freudian theory, and her study did little to modify his contempt for psychoanalytical doctrine. Lawrence's adaptation of elements in Frazer's study of magic, taboo, and superstition often is recognizable in the novella, and ? regard it as a serious oversight by critics that Frazer's direct influence on Lawrence's work has not been acknowledged sufficiently in studies of "The Fox."5 Yet the undisguised antagonism to Freud evident in Fantasia of the</page><page sequence="3">D.H.LAWRENCE / 213 Unconscious provides the special dividend of enabling readers of The Fox to witness the operative universality of Freud's theories about the unconscious playing itself out against the dogmatically un-Freudian intention of Lawrence, for the novelist sounds convinced that the symbologies in his fiction primarily reflect his familiarity with the research of such archetypal primitivists as Frazer, Blavatsky, and Jung. Thus when salient aspects of Lawrence's life and marriage are engraved on a foundation of Lawrencian doctrine that for him is consciously supported by Frazer and unconsciously illuminated by Freud, the result is a kind of palimpsestic fiction, as the various inscriptions of influence on Lawrence compete for priority in this dense and revealing work. (See also Gay 528.) The evidence for these strands of influence emerges at different points in the novella, and their visibility is particularly prominent in the two dream sequences experienced by March, when Freud, Frazer, and Fantasia complicate and enhance the multi-textured resonance of Lawrence's art. The opening pages of The Fox quickly emphasize the unnatural and decreative results of the farming that is so earnestly and awkwardly managed by March and Banford. Through a combination of bad luck, inexperience, and incompetence, the young women encounter a series of unfortunate events that undermine the fertility of their land and livestock and thereby harm the prospects for their economic survival. The sudden death of the grandfather, the untamable wildness of the heifer, the chickens' obstinate refusal to lay eggs all seems out of rhythm and recourse even before we learn much about these landowners who attempt an independent life in a difficult and traditionally masculine domain in the male-decimated countryside of England at the end of the war. Lawrence stresses the gender inversion and sexual displacement early in the work, as if somehow the women's ill fortune is related to their presumption of unorthodox roles. March pointedly is described as "the man about the place" and Banford "did not look as if she would marry" (7). Yet for all the unconventionality of their household arrangement, Lawrence employs his familiar imagery of procreative blackness to suggest March's potential for the instinctual, creative depths that he praises in Fantasia of the Unconscious as the "fathomless blackness" (101) of the eye. He reiteratively mentions that March's "eyes were big and wide and dark" (8), leading to his more directive comment about her unfulfilled passion and repressed needs, that "there was something odd and unexplained about her" (8). For Lawrence, such qualities of inexplicability, strangeness, and unknowability remain the signature of the creative soul: "To know is to lose. When I have a finished mental concept of a beloved, then the love and friendship is dead... .To know is to die" {Fantasia 108).6 The farm stands isolated on "the edge of the wood" (9), and from inside the dark and deep border often emerges a fox that is described as a "demon" and "serpent" (9) for the vicious and stealthy manner it attacks the fowl that</page><page sequence="4">214 / B ALBERT comprise the working economy of the farm. This picture of the adjoining forest as metaphoric domain as well as literal sanctuary reflects the engrained primitivism of the novella that is influenced by Lawrence's reading of Frazer and articulated in Fantasia of the Unconscious as his unqualified belief in the "subjective science" that was "taught esoterically in all countries of the globe" and then "remembered as ritual, gesture, and myth story" (62-63). In this context of demonism and magic, Frazer refers in The Golden Bough to the Druidical custom in ancient England of burning foxes in seasonal festivals of exorcism, and among the British Celts the burning is an attempt "to break the power of witchcraft" and thus "greater would be the fertility of the land" (761-62). Frazer further explains that the foxes and other wild animals were consigned to the flames because "they were believed to be witches who had taken the shape of animals for their nefarious purposes" (762). March and Banford do not require archetypal justification to seek out the marauding fox, but the mythic implications of serpent and forest alert the reader that rational explanations will not be sufficient to explain the mystical grip of instinct and emotion that informs key moments of the novella. This sense of the fox as a devilish and demonic presence in their lives is created by the inexperienced and hysterical perspective of March and Banford, who feel the animal's underworld ambience more than they calmly understand the situational normalcy of its predatory behavior. One of the major themes in the novella will be whether March can distance herself from the range of typological associations related to the fox, and (as a later contingency) whether she can separate Henry from that persistent identification with the fox that informs her preoccupations with this boy-man. It is here that elements of Freudian symbology begin to emerge in the multi-layered texture of the fiction, as the unconscious signposts merge with Lawrence's appropriations of regional and totemic primitivism. From the first time that March sees the fox, her awareness appears sublimatingly sexual and-more precisely-projectively phallic, with her mesmerized awareness of the white tip of its brush, with her intense concern with its ruddy, snake-like shadow in the deep grass, and with her awkward and mannish use of a long rifle that predictably proves impotent when she uses it in the hunt for the fox. Lawrence's imaginative use of Frazer's detailed research establishes an additional meaning for the fox that is relevant to March's psychology and emotional development. The fox resembles what Frazer describes throughout The Golden Bough as the corn-spirit-that is, the fox as the symbolic incarnation of successful germination and of a bountiful agricultural season. But the fox must die for the harvest to be complete (Frazer 518). The psychosexual theories of Freud retain viability beyond the documented influence of Lawrencian doctrine and Frazer's primitivism. Here the emphasis on the tail ("brush") of the fox in March's thoughts recalls the totemic terms of Frazer's analysis of a ritual in Bourgogne while it also illustrates the rites of manhood practiced by an entire village: "The last sheaf [of corn] represented the fox. Beside it</page><page sequence="5">D.H.LAWRENCE / 215 a score of ears was left standing to form the tail, and each reaper, going back some paces, threw his sickle at it. He who succeeded in severing it, 'cut off the fox's tail' and a cry of 'you cou cou' was raised in his honor" (Frazer 518). As an elusive and natural spirit of procreation that March both respects and reviles, it is difficult to avoid the sexual significance of the presence of the fox in her isolated and frustrated life. When she looks at him, "he was not daunted" (10), for he embodies the Lawerencian "otherness" that as yet March cannot accept, the unknowable passion she cannot engage. She is hypnotically drawn to a part of the fox's body that in its length and bushy prominence seems most male in its full extension: "She saw his brush held smooth like a feather, and saw his white buttocks twinkle" (10). March's attraction to the fox (and soon to Henry) is played off numerous times against the persistent and whining sounds of Banford's voice beckoning her to return: "At last she became aware that Banford was calling her" (10). March is torn constantly between the urgent, choric calls of Banford and the magnetism of the fox or of Henry-as-fox. The desperation in Banford's call will increase proportionally as March becomes more entrenched in the otherness represented first by the animal, then by the man-as-animal, and then by Henry-as-man. From the moment Henry enters the cloistered world of these women, two integrated factors are reiterated by Lawrence as structural and ideological principles of organization early in the work: Banford insists on seeing Henry as boyish and inconsequential, and March-through a transparent process of displacement and repression-identifies him with the fox. But the Freudian patterns here are no more essential than Frazer's research, for Frazer is precisely relevant about the history of the procreative and phallic potential implicit in the unexpected appearance of Henry, whether he is perceived as fox or corn spirit: The identification of the corn-spirit with an animal is analogous to the identification of him with a passing stranger. As the sudden appearance of a stranger near the harvest field or threshing floor is, to the primitive mind, enough to identify him as the spirit of the corn escaping from the cut or threshed corn, so the sudden appearance of an animal issuing from the cut corn is enough to identify it with the corn-spirit escaping from his ruined home. The two identifications are so analogous that they can hardly be disassociated in any attempt to explain them. (537-38) The Fox reveals Lawrence's palimpsestic effort to fictionalize the process of association and identification described by Frazer, as the novelist embroiders the primitive elements with intentional intrusions of his own doctrine, and with unconscious patterns of motivation and meaning that emerge regardless of his intent. Although Freud was not uninterested in the historic importance of Frazer's expository work, he was more eager to speculate in depth on the</page><page sequence="6">216 / B ALBERT psychosexual reasons for the rituals outlined in The Golden Bough. Freud's theoretical assertions about the structure and significance of dreams often prove illuminating in the specific case; here they offer a special applicability in terms of an "identification" that March obsessively ponders in her dream? like state: "Wild beasts are as a rule employed by the dream-work to represent passionate impulses of which the dreamer is afraid, whether they are his own or those of other people" {Interpretation of Dreams 445). Freud further and famously insists-with open acknowledgement of Frazer's contribution-that such symbolism amounts to "a form of representation recalling totemism. It might be said that the wild beasts are used to represent the libido, a force dreaded by the ego and combated by means of repression" (445).7 But soon March's repressions will take her from an obsession with the fox to a mesmerized belief in the representation of Henry-as-fox, and this transition also has credible basis in dream theory: "It often happens, too, that the dreamer separates off his neurosis, his 'sick personality,' from himself and depicts it as an independent person" (445). Despite Henry's social inexperience and sexual immaturity, he impresses his female hosts (and the reader) with his skills at detailed observation. His first extended contemplation of March's demeanor is more curious than erotic, as he ponders quizzically the repressed look she conveys with her tight knot of dark hair, man-like clothes, and receptive eyes-an odd combination of elements capped off with the unwieldy rifle in her hand. March's perspective on him is unequivocal, as she confirms the syndrome of projection and repression defined by Freud: "But to March he was the fox... .The boy was to her the fox, and she could not see him otherwise" (14). His rootlessness and independence are summarized in his military enlistment after he ran away from his grandfather. Such deracination and pluckiness early in his life have provided him with a talent for grasping opportunity and for valuing the virtue of hard work. March perceives little about these qualities during their first encounter. Her immediate sense that he resembles the fox permits her to relax and to repress the human sexual threat and allure he embodies for her. By reductively signifying him as the fox, she avoids (for a time) the full implications of his presence as a man, as Lawrence typically conveys the sensual significance of his appearance for March by means of shadow imagery and of the "lapsing-out" that signals the presence of sexual desire: "There in the shadow of her corner she gave herself up to a warm, relaxed peace, almost like sleep, accepting the spell that was on her... .Hidden in the shadow of her corner.. .she could at last lapse into the odour of the fox" (18). In Freudian terms, March's daydreams "benefit by a certain degree of relaxation of censorship" permitted by the dreamer in a process of "secondary revision" {Interpretation 530). Her lapse "into the odour of the fox" illustrates Freud's view that "the wishful purpose that is at work" in the production remains the common but deceptive "phantasy" (529) adapted from childhood memories of passion without disruption or consequence. For</page><page sequence="7">D.H.LAWRENCE / 217 March this phantasy is, in effect, of the bodily rescue and courtship of an adult woman without the undertaking of risk and disruption that real marriage requires. There also exists a more primitive reason for the use of shadows as the metaphor that leads March into intimations of her sexual desire. As Frazer evocatively describes the habits and beliefs of earlier civilizations, he explains how "some people believe a man's soul to be in his shadow," and-as we recall how Henry's view of the fox's shadow will be crucial in his killing the animal "a warrior's strength waxed and waned with the depth of his shadow" (222). In The Fox the crucial and cathartic meetings between March and Henry occur within the shadows produced by encroaching evening. It is during the deeper darkness of March's sleep that Lawrence begins to chart the full implications of her needs and cautions. March's first dream resonates as a fusion of material from Frazer and Freud, and it also bears the imprint of Lawrence's central notions about the demands of the organic self. In it she responds for once not to the beckoning calls of Banford but to what she believes are the tempting, inscrutable sounds of the fox ("singing outside, which she could not understand" 20), an animal shaped in the long and lean design of phallic imagery, and with the color and kind of Frazer's famous and totemic subject ("he was very yellow and bright, like corn" 20). She tries to touch him and he responds with a swipe of the "brush across her face" (20). Lawrence deploys the phoenix-like metaphor of flame that throughout his work indicates the painful but necessary forging of the new soul: "And it seemed his brush was on fire, for it seared and burned her mouth with great pain" (2).8 The dream-work insists on what March's receptive unconscious senses and what Lawrence's vision always mandates: there will be strong consequences in her instinctual attraction to the fox, consequences that Freud believes are reflected during the dreams of women in which so often "the female genital orifice is [represented] by the mouth" with the tail often functioning as phallic "while the fur stands for the pubic hair" {Interpretation 394, 118). When March first sees the fox not only does she note "his brush held smooth like a feather," but she also "saw his white buttocks twinkle" (10). That the fox's brush is both phallic in shape and positioned on the buttocks of the animal, and that March palpably experiences the fox's assault on her mouth in the dream-such a configuration of shape, organ, and sensation is fully explicable in terms of meaningful transpositions that often occur in dreams: One instance of a transposition of this kind is the replacement of the genitals by the face in the symbolism of unconscious thinking. Linguistic usage follows the same line in recognizing the buttocks ['Hinterbacken,' literally back-cheeks'] as homologous to the cheeks, and by drawing a parallel between the 'labia' and the lips which frame the aperture of the mouth. {Interpretation 422)</page><page sequence="8">218 / B ALBERT Although March "awoke with the pain" of this dream encounter, in the morning "she only remembered it as a distant memory" (20). This lack of retention so soon after a disruptive dream is indicative of the intensity of March's resistance to its repressed significance, and it also reflects Lawrence's defiant and stubborn stance that "most dreams are purely insignificant, and it is a sign of a weak and paltry nature to pay any attention to them whatever" {Fantasia 178). Much of Lawrence's extensive discussion of dreams in Fantasia of the Unconscious relies on a reductive and mechanically "digestive" theory of dream-prompting, as he unpersuasively emphasizes that what the dreamer ate for dinner and how his organs interacted in the body hold major clues to the source and substance of respective dreams. Freud does not dismiss the occasional relevance of physical initiators of the unconscious, but he is famously dogmatic on the issue of interpretability, maintaining without exception that "every dream reveals itself as a psychical structure which has a meaning and can be inserted at an assignable point in the mental activities of waking life" {Interpretation 35). While Lawrence demonstrates his own resistance to this seminal notion of psychoanalysis, it is likely that some willed disingenuousness on his part explains the adamance of his position. For instance, just a few weeks before Lawrence composes March's dream for the first version of The Fox in 1918 (it is virtually unchanged in the 1921 novella), he describes his own luminous dream to an important benefactor, Lady Cynthia Asquith: I dreamed, also, such a funny dream. When I had been to some big, crowded fair somewhere-where things were to sell, on booths and on the floor-as I was coming back down an open road, I heard such a strange crying overhead, in front, and looking up, I saw, not very high in the air above me, but higher than I could throw, two pale spotted dogs, crouching in the air, and mauling a bird that was crying loudly. I ran fast forwards and clapped my hands and the dogs started back. The bird came falling down to earth. It was a young peacock, blue all over like a peacock's neck, very lovely. It still kept crying. But it was not much hurt. A woman came running out of a cottage not far off, and took the bird, saying it would be all right. So I went my way. That dream is in some oblique way or other connected with your aura-but I can't interpret it. {Letters III 247-8) Surely Lawrence protests too much, given the accessible nature of what Freud calls the dream-work, "the process by which the latent dream thoughts were transformed into the manifest dream" {New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis 17). The young and sensitive Lawrence, praised and supported extravagantly by his doting mother for his blue eyes and special gifts, here embodied as a proud but vulnerable peacock under assault by the dogs of England, rescued by a mother-substitute who cannot stay with him-the whole vignette, in effect, textured so that Lawrence the artist is both participant (as the peacock) and observer (as the artist). His assertion of ignorance becomes</page><page sequence="9">D.H.LAWRENCE / 219 all the more transparent when he sends off the cathartic letter to a titled woman who often has intervened in his life to protect him from the maulings by antagonistic friends, publishers, and government bureaucrats. Filled with energy and confidence about his role on the farm, Henry uses his insights about the natural landscape and his skill at hunting to shoot a wild duck that the proud male brings to the women "as a great addition to the empty larder" (21). After this demonstration of his practical value to the ineffective farmers, he brings up his concerns about finding lodging in the village. March appears flexible to Banford's suggestion that he remain with them at the farm, and she accepts the prospect of his residence only by reducing him again to the totem of the fox as she recalls the sensual and "forging" aspects of her dream: "March felt the same sly, taunting, knowing spark leap out of his eyes as he turned his head aside, and fall into her soul, as it had fallen from the dark eyes of the fox. She pursed her mouth as if in pain, as if asleep too" (21). Banford remains acquiescent to this temporary arrangement only by ignoring, through displacement, the sexual threat he presents to her relationship with March. She continues to diminish his manhood by pretending that his presence is inconsequential, that the innocence of his youth makes him tolerably gender neutral: "It's no bother if you like to stay. It's like having my own brother here for a few days. He's a boy like you are....No, of course you're no trouble. I tell you, it's a pleasure to have somebody in the house besides ourselves" (22). Henry now concentrates his attention on March, feeling sexually drawn to her but in the subtle ways that his timidity cannot acknowledge as erotic: "Her dark eyes made something rise in his soul, with a curious elate-excitement, when he looked into them, an excitement he was afraid to let be seen, it was so keen and secret" (23). It is at this point that he realizes how much he loves the farm, and then (sequence is crucial here) he thinks of marrying her as an available practical strategy, of tracking her down in the relentless manner that a capable hunter employs instinct and skill to capture his prey. Henry understandably relies on the language of the huntsman to organize the energy of his love-life, but what remains more significant is his relative lack of conscious awareness of any sexual dimension in his connection to March. He emanates a calm virginity in his temperament and demeanor even as he functions as a practiced killer with a gun. Such paradoxical qualities of inexperience and power inform the logic and metaphor he uses to justify his initial motivation for marriage. "And it was as a young hunter that he would bring down March as his quarry, to make her his wife" (24). When Henry asks March to marry him, she responds negatively at first, with precisely the "tomfoolery" phrase he predicted when he contemplated her likely denial of his proposal. When she continues to object to the awkward and precipitous nature of his offer, he touches March for the first time, "with his mouth and chin" on her neck, and she is described as "killed" (26). This</page><page sequence="10">220 / BALBERT moment is crucial for initiating a new movement toward recognition in her that will develop slowly through a series of meetings between March and Henry. What is killed amounts to her unbroken identification of him as the fox, her reliance on a reverse anthropomorphism that has served to camouflage her awareness of the normative sexual presence he can provide in her life. The choric "calling" by Banford then intervenes again, and they both carry logs into the house in obedience to her insistent voice. The unspoken tensions mount while the three characters read quietly, and March begins to lapse-out as she hears the fox singing in the house. Unconsciously aware of the attention Henry directs to her, she represses her consciousness of Henry-as-man by entering further into the instinctual drowse and blurting aloud the identification of Henry-as-fox. March utters the exact words of identity-"'There he isV she cried involuntarily, as if terribly startled" (31), in a virtual dream-state during which she has condensed the salient facts of her dream of the corn-fox with the visual identification of Henry-as-fox, a process exacerbated by the previous touch from him that resembles the touch in the dream. March's dual experience of what Freud denotes as displacement (Henry-as-fox) and condensation (the dream reduced to verbal utterance) is discussed in The Interpretation of Dreams in terms that also suggests how the vividness of her "picture" of Henry "under the edge of the lamplight" (30) becomes the immediate stimulus of March's abrupt exclamation. Finally March can use her dream-thought to state out loud, concretely, the association that bedevils her {Interpretation 375). During his second meeting with March, Henry insists that she grant him an answer to his marriage proposal. Again, he kisses her neck and cheek, and again "Banford's voice was heard calling" (33). Then Henry, as if he begins to sense the power of Banford to interfere with his plans, enacts the movements and drama in March's dream with eerie correspondence: "He kissed her on the mouth with a quick brushing kiss" (33). The forging process continues as she gives her "yes" to the proposal while the kiss-in the fashion of Lawrence's phoenix metaphor-"seemed to burn through her every fiber" (33). Henry recognizes March's wavering under Banford's influence. With his manhood thus assaulted, he takes the long gun, his one reliable instrument of self-definition, and he stalks out to kill the fox. His intention here is not only to kill the animal: in the act of killing the fox, he realizes that he can obliterate March's persistent identification of him as the fox. This important first recognition by Henry of what needs to be done (the second will be the killing of Banford) is followed by credible evidence of his own increasing maturity. Lawrence asserts Henry's growth in telltale phrases of alienation and discontent that sound suspiciously similar to the writer's own perspective in the bitter days during and shortly after the war. The passage also recapitulates some of the images and tone of the dream-letter to Lady Asquith: As he stood under the oaks of the wood-edge he heard the dogs from the neighboring cottage, up the hill, yelling suddenly and startlingly, and the</page><page sequence="11">D.H.LAWRENCE / 221 wakened dogs from the farms around barking the answer. And suddenly it seemed to him England was little and tight, he felt the landscape was constricted even in the dark, and that there were too many dogs in the night, making a noise like a fence of sound, like the network of English hedges netting in the view. (39) Henry's talent as a hunter should not be underestimated, for he has predicted every move of the fox, an anticipatory precision in him that is part of the iroay of his actual resemblance to the fox with respect to both his vulpine features and in his sly manner of perception. When he shoots the fox he holds it lengthwise by its long brush as he shows the appendage to his fianc?e. It is this scene of trophy-display (except for a brief moment later when Henry leaves by train) that concludes March's Henry-as-fox correspondence. The fox is dead and so is the imposition by March of a false identity for Henry. Recall Frazer's emphasis on the symbolism of holding up the fox's tail as the community's signature of victory over the animal and the forces it represents, for in that primal gesture "the greater would be the fertility of the land" (762). March and Henry move closer to the consummation of their very human and fertile passion, and the clearest signal of March's progress resides in another graphic dream. In this morbid second dream, March does not encounter the fox, but she does deal with the death of Banford, who is pictured in her coffin because March comprehends, with a heavy dose of guilt, that the end of the fox Henry identification also signifies the end of her relationship to Banford. The sequence of the dream-work leads to a relevant interpretation in which Freud's metaphors of the unconscious enhance the evidence of Lawrencian doctrine. March places a fox skin over the body of Banford and the brush of the fox directly under her head. (See Kinkead-Weekes 689.) "And the coffin was the rough wood-box in which the bits of chopped wood were kept in the kitchen, by the fire" (40); on the symbology of placing a cover on Banford that is surrounded by the remnants of shattered wood, there are Freud's assertions that in dreams an overcoat, of any kind, "can very often be interpreted with certainty as a genital organ, and, moreover as a man's" and that "wood seems, from its imagistic connections, to stand in general for female material" {Interpretation 391; see also New Introductory Lectures 23-24). The solemn interment of Banford in March's dream, amid remnants of wood and the coverlet as male organ, becomes a displaced gesture of antagonism that March's conscious self cannot face; that is, the apparent solicitude of honoring a corpse (in the gesture of covering it), scarcely conceals the latent meaning of March's repressed anger about her womanly liaison with Banford, a relationship now in pieces and overwhelmed by the dominant presence of male genitalia, embodied behind Banford by the brush and above her by the covering skin. Unlike the first dream, when "she only remembered it as a distant memory" (20), March</page><page sequence="12">222 / BALBERT is upset when she awakens after her sense of anger and loss experienced in the coffin-dream. Her more intense reactions following this second dream make sense in the context of Freud's view that when a dreamer imagines the death of a beloved "and is at the same time painfully affected.. .the meaning of such dreams as the content indicates, is a wish that the person in question may die" {Interpretation 282). Even Lawrence finds agreement with Freud on the urgency of dreams that reveal "something [that] threatens us from the world of death," for he also acknowledges that "a dream may become so vivid that it arouses the actual soul. And when a dream is so intense that it arouses the soul-then we must attend to it" {Fantasia 194). March will now attend to her aroused soul by feeling the fox's body in an intense interlude of Lawrencian communion. With Henry-as-fox virtually dead to March, and with Banford's influence on her temporarily diminished, March can now touch the fox's brush and feel not Henry but the profound "otherness" of another creature: "White and soft as snow his belly: white and soft as snow. She passed her hand softly down it. And his wonderful black-glinted brush was full and frictional, wonderful. She passed her hand down this also, and quivered" (41).9 The dramatic extent of her wonder in this scene seems to justify Henry's rumination that "partly she was so shy and virgin" (41-42), and such virginity may suggest-despite the nearly unanimous assumption by critics of the presence of active lesbianism the limits of her relationship with Banford. (See also Lessing, Kinkead-Weekes 691, and Harris 167.) March's sensual excitement over the lingering "soft" but "frictional" touch indicates her awareness that "the fox was a strange beast to her, incomprehensible, out of her range" (41) but also conveys the possibility of her sexual awakening and the impulse for a passionate connection to Henry. But Banford undercuts his stature by revealing his lack of sufficient preparation for the forthcoming marriage. Watching her trudge up the hill with an obsequious March too willing to carry the heavier groceries, Henry begins to understand the extent to which she remains a problem for the implementation of his wedding plans. But later he overhears March, for the first time, respond effectively to Banford's cynicism and feels "again irresistibly drawn to her,... a secret thread between him and her" (47). His rumination remains one of the most interesting passages of psychosexual revelation in all of Lawrence's fiction: He hoped he could touch her soft, creamy cheek, her strange frightened face. He hoped he could look in to her dilated, frightened dark eyes, quite near. He hoped he might even put his hand on her bosom and feel her soft breasts under her tunic. His heart beat deep and powerful as he thought of that. He wanted to make sure of her soft woman's breasts under her tunic....It seems to him...that they were so much softer, tenderer, more lovely and lovable, shut up in that tunic, than were Banford's breasts, under her soft blouse and</page><page sequence="13">D.H.LAWRENCE / 223 chiffon dresses. The Banford would have little iron breasts he said to himself. For all her frailty and fretfulness, she could have tiny iron breasts. (47-48) The superb mimicry of the refracted narration, with its repetitive simplicity and elemental language, captures the exact texture of Henry's uninformed contemplation of sexual proximity. Yes, there is intimate interest in March here, but the tone of desire is more of an adolescent's masturbatory view of a woman's body, almost childlike in its pre-phallic and prurient curiosity, with voyeurism and melodramatic fantasy replacing mature lust and passionate attraction. The rating system Henry uses to compare the bodily assets of March and Banford bespeaks his general unfamiliarity with women's breasts, and the adjectives employed in the comparison might easily apply to the various delectability of food in two competing restaurants. Yet Henry conveys accurate insight about the potential excitement of unleashing March's repressed heterosexuality and about the inherent danger posed by Banford. When a confident Henry enters the room, he senses that March is aligned again with him after her angry disagreement with Banford. In the alternating symmetries and repetition-with-variation of this novella, Henry must perceive March's otherness in the way that she earlier experienced this element of transcendence in the fox: "She was another human being" (49), and with that essential knowledge, so entrenched in Lawrence's doctrine of the "unknown" and Freud's notion of mature love, comes the awesome realization to this boy-man that soon he must make love to March and take charge of the direction of their marriage. The recognition comes with a heavy price: "and strangely, suddenly he felt a man, no longer a youth. He felt a man, with all a man's grave weight of responsibility. A curious quietness and gravity came over his soul. He felt a man, quiet, with a little of the heaviness of male destiny upon him. She was soft and accessible in her dress. The thought went home in him like an everlasting responsibility" (49). The prospect of her accessibility, and of the phallic testing to come, frightens him with its importance and inevitability. But Henry at least feels buoyed by his recognition that he has reached the edge of manhood. When Banford again asks March to do her bidding, Henry confidently asks March to deny the favor. He makes the request to March with "so much tenderness and proud authority" (51)-in effect, with that elusive combination of sensitivity and strength that confirms his developing maturity. As Banford begins to cry, a concerned March wishes to intervene, for she has just "thought of Banford in the wood-box for a coffin" (49). Henry patiently explains to March that it is appropriate to let Banford cry. When he picks up a rug (recall the coverlet in the second dream) and asks March to wrap herself in it, the psychoanalytical implications of March's dream have encompassed Lawrence's artistic intuition: a man has offered March the man's symbol of the overcoat, and "she obeyed" (54). Now in the third scene in the cycle, March can feel the otherness not of the fox, not of Henry-as-fox,</page><page sequence="14">224 / BALBERT but of Henry. She recognizes the intrinsic ability in him to help remove her from the choric call of Banford that rings throughout the novella. She can now respond to that different sound from the transcendent unknown: "And then she felt the deep, heavy, powerful stroke of his heart, terrible, like something from beyond. It was like something from beyond, something awful from outside, signaling to her. And the signal paralyzed her. It beat upon her very soul, and made her helpless. She forgot Jill [Banford]" (52). Henry's "saving" presence in her life must end for a while when he joins his regiment. March senses her immediate susceptibility to the will of Banford, and as the train moves slowly away Henry seems to metamorphose (in March's eyes and on the page) into the figure of the fox: "Only his face was fixed in her mind: the full, ruddy, unchanging cheeks, and the straight snout of a nose, and the two eyes staring above" (57). This relapse in March's perspective is later confirmed in the rejection letter she sends him. In it she reveals an inability to understand the galvanizing nature of his otherness-not realizing the very terms of her complaint amount to words of praise in Lawrence's visionary lexicon, which so privileges the unknowability of the soul: "You are an absolute stranger to me, and it seems to me you will always be one" (57). The rejection of Henry initiates in him the next step in his recognition of Banford's danger: he now knows that not only is she the problem, it is clear that she must be eliminated. Unlike the more indecisive and over-deliberate youth sketched earlier in the work, he goes straight to his officer and impressively wins approval for a leave. The frenetic bicycle trip that he completes is a major undertaking in the rustic countryside, covering sixty miles in four hours. He is aided in the effort by an adrenalin-rush of anger stimulated by March's demeaning letter and by his awareness that Banford must not prevail. In Fantasia of the Unconscious Lawrence devotes several pages to a metaphor that describes the human body as a bicycle, "and our individual and incomprehensible self as the rider thereof (97). It is the rider's essential responsibility to listen to the driving force of his soul and move in the direction of "his true dynamic psychic activity," which is "true to the individual himself, to his own peculiar soul-nature" (98). Henry stays true to his soul from the moment he sits on the bicycle, and all through the strenuous trip and the episode of Banford's death. Just before Henry chops down the tree, Lawrence describes him as "perfectly still," for "in his heart he had decided her death. A terrible force seemed in him, and a power that was just his" (64-65). Both this eerie stillness and Henry's emotional resolve are justified by Lawrence in Fantasia as he writes of the pregnant pause in the soul before the "whole self speaks," a moment when the soul "collects itself into pure silence and isolation...the mind suspends its knowledge and waits. The psyche becomes strangely still" (155). As Henry chops down the tree with all the power, precision, and will that mandates its felling, he reaches his most impressive stature in the novella,</page><page sequence="15">D.H.LAWRENCE / 225 as "his form seemed to flash up enormously tall and fearful" (65). At this point he embodies all his potential attributes of strength and imagination; "the world seemed to stand still" (65) as he emerges from youth into manhood. He becomes for Lawrence, if only in this one scene, the graphic illustration of his doctrine that "only at his maximum does an individual surpass all his derivative elements and become purely himself {Fantasia 76). It is an effective and justified hatred that Henry brings to the killing of Banford, and in Lawrence's prescriptive psychology, he is broadly acting on the just dictates of his soul: "The only rule is do what you really impulsively wish to do. But always act on your own responsibility, sincerely. And have the courage of your own strong emotion" {Fantasia 92). Amid the impulsive fury of his act also exists the poised shrewdness evident when he asks Banford to move away from the area of the tree's possible fall. He knows she will not listen to him, and his futile request protects him from any alleged malicious motive or act of negligence. Henry's killing of Banford embodies a more abrupt, brutal, and equally efficient stalking of prey than his tracking of the fox over the several minutes he requires to implement his single-minded shooting of the animal. Part of what makes Banford's death so shocking is that it reflects how successfully Henry has compressed all his instinctual power and hunter's knowledge into a murderous objective that is carried through in a matter of seconds, a span of time sufficient for him to attain the "maximum self described in Fantasia. In the stark reality of the novella, Henry already has primed himself for the kill during the controlled passion of his bicycle trip, and it only remains for him to encounter the fortuitous but strangely inevitable circumstances of the nearly fallen tree. There is a further irony in the scene that confirms Lawrence's enthusiastic reading of Frazer, who outlines the ancient belief in the animate life of trees; such a credo is similar to the vitalism displayed by Lawrence in his entire chapter about the souls of trees in Fantasia of the Unconscious, a work Lawrence proudly calls his "tree book" (86). Frazer writes: "Trees are endowed with shades or souls, and whoever fells one of them must die on the spot, or at least live an invalid for the rest of his days" (129). Frazer also quotes another scholar who uncovers the old belief that a tree may give a "kind of shriek.. .or groan.. .that may be heard a mile off when it is felled (130). In Lawrence's fictionalized appropriation of these taboos, it is the human embodiment of anti-life energy that is killed on the spot rather than the destroyer of the tree; the shriek emerges not from the tree-which was dead before it was felled-but from Banford's beloved March, who "gave a wild shriek that went far, far down the afternoon" (65), as she witnesses a death that resolves her own doubts about commitment with terrifying finality. Not all her doubts, to be sure. Henry wins and marries her, but "he had not yet got her" (66). As the novella's coda insists, instead of March accepting the principles in Fantasia of the Unconscious that "waiting and following" the lead of her man "is inevitable, that it must be so" (199), she has elected to</page><page sequence="16">226 / BALBERT strive for what Lawrence in The Fox regards (with unqualified sexism) as the willful dead-end for any relationship: an attempt by the woman to energetically seek "happiness for herself and the whole world" (69). Lawrence's narration, reproducing the perspective of March, claims that a fatigued March "would never strain for love and happiness any more" and that "she would leave her destiny to the boy-But then the boy" (69). The reiterative and dismissive noun of "boy" is the same term Banford used to diminish his stature. It makes understandable sense that March cannot fully yield to him, that she cannot "give herself without defenses and become submerged in him," for March commits Lawrence's version of the unpardonable sin, and Henry is not man enough to combat it: "She wanted to see, to know, to understand' (69). As Lawrence asserts so essentially with characteristic chauvinism, he wants the wife to follow the husband, who is described as "the pioneer who goes on ahead, beyond her" {Fantasia 199). March compromises the simplicity of such a priority with her own more equitable desire "to be alone: with him at her side" (69). After her intense entanglement with Banford, she is tempted to let her own convictions lapse with Henry and thus yield to his notions of precedence ("there was such rest in the boy," 70), but in the end he remains for her more boy than man. March correctly senses that he lacks the force and maturity that might make her accede to the Lawrencian concept of marriage: "she would have the reins of her own life between her own hands. She would be an independent woman to the last" (70). As Henry and March arrive at this impasse, the narration-clearly refracted now through Lawrence's doctrine rather than Henry's conviction-regretfully adds that "she would not sleep: no never" (70). Henry hopes to solve their stalemate by moving them across the ocean: "He waits to go west. He was aching almost in torment to leave England, to go west, to take March away" (70). Henry momentarily resembles the pioneering male in Fantasia of the Unconscious who "wants to break away through the old world into the new" (198). He also sounds a lot like the angry Lawrence of 1921, who carries a similar antagonism about his own country: "I do so want to get out-out of England-really out of Europe....I feel caged somehow-" {Letters HI 312-13) March may follow him west, but not with confidence in their relocation or pride in her husband's ability to control their fate. Henry has not established what Lawrence requires as the basic requirement for the man in any marriage: "Make her know she's got to believe in you again, and in the deep purpose you stand for. But before you can do that, you've got to stand for some deep purpose" {Fantasia 198). This work concludes so tentatively because its ending directly reflects both the lack of purposeful direction in Henry, and the lingering regrets and guilt felt by March over the death of Banford. Recall that Lawrence revised the 1918 story of "The Fox" into the novella just days after finishing revisions ofFantasia of the Unconscious, with its final pages focusing on the extreme importance of the male's "deep purpose." A lingering question</page><page sequence="17">D.H.LAWRENCE / 227 remains: why would Lawrence write a substantial fiction that concludes with such discomforting stasis, with such an unefficacious assertion by Henry of doctrines so central to Lawrence's vision? Any consideration of that issue requires some investigation of Lawrence's life and marriage during the years between 1917 and 1921. In October of 1917 the Lawrences suffered a brutal indignity when British authorities, who suspected them of espionage, searched their cottage in Cornwall; the next day, on the flimsiest of circumstantial evidence, they were expelled from the region. In the months before this unsettling eviction, an already preoccupied Frieda experienced bouts of anger, depression, and jealousy during interludes of loneliness while Lawrence spent extensive time working in the fields with his close friend, William Henry Hocking, and often visiting with a young American, Esther Andrews. Biographers have speculated about a possible affair during these months between Frieda and Cecil Gray, a music critic and composer as well as a devout admirer of Lawrence's wife; such a liaison seems likely in light of the vulnerability of Frieda's position in 1917, the ease of opportunity for such intimacy given Lawrence's frequent absence, and the evidence of numerous disagreements between Lawrence and Gray after the alleged intimacy. (See Kinkead-Weekes 404-05 and Meyers 206-07.) Frieda was temperamentally unguarded with Lawrence about her extra-marital conquests (e.g., a proud confession about Hobson in 1912), and perhaps Lawrence's later affair with Rosalind Baynes in the summer of 1920 reflects, in part, a declaration by him of the freedom to respond in-kind to his knowledge of Frieda's infidelity. When the Armistice was signed in 1918, Frieda's concerns about the welfare of her children, mother, and Germany were exacerbated by the public celebrations over her home country's defeat and by the strained relations with Lawrence during the previous eighteen months. To Lawrence's considerable displeasure, Frieda did not accompany him in late November on another trip to London, preferring to remain at the Hermitage. By December 10, Lawrence returned to Mountain Cottage alone, where he finished the first version of The Fox\ a later draft of this short tale (compressed even further) would be published in Huchinson's Story Magazine in 1920. (See also Ruderman "Tracking Lawrence's Fox") Mark Kinkead-Weekes persuasively argues that this 1918 short version of the The Fox was directly influenced by Lawrence's disputes with and separation from Frieda (484). Kinkead-Weekes regards this first version of The Fox, composed by Lawrence amid considerable personal and marital turmoil, as "far less aggressive" than the later novella (484), for neither Banford nor the fox is killed, and Banford even helps to facilitate the planning for the wedding of March and Henry. But Lawrence's capable biographer ignores the most important sense in which this tale is more aggressive than the longer 1921 work. In 1918 a betrayed and angrily</page><page sequence="18">228 / BALBERT motivated Lawrence felt no doubt that his character, Henry, can prevail. It was as if Lawrence's accumulated discontent with Frieda, combined with his own changing vision about male-female relations, is crystallized in a short fictional work that in its very brevity still contains all the assertive and unequivocal language about Henry's demeanor and decisiveness that are lacking in the more ambitious novella three years later. The strength and confidence evident in the voice of Henry and the narrator stand out in their unambiguous authority in this 1918 version: "March felt the same knowing, domineering spark leap out of his eyes..." (43); "He knew he could make her obey his will" (45); "Without knowing, she obeyed him" (47); "But she did what he wanted" (47); "Both women were at his mercy" (47); "The women were at his mercy" (47). Kinkead-Weekes remains correct, however, about the important direction of the tale, in which Lawrence stresses the need of "powerful malehood to make its counterpart fully female....'The Fox' privately rebukes, in imagined assertion of maleness and its value, the woman who breaks orbit" (484-485). The Henry Grenfel of the novella lacks the confidence in his "maleness" that Lawrence had assigned to him in 1918. Three years later, when the Lawrences returned to Italy and Fontana Vecchia in the fall of 1921, he was greeted with a litany of bad news. There were changes demanded by publishers for references in Women In Love because of Heseltine's continued threat of legal action, rejection notices on Lawrence's manuscript of Aaron's Rod, excerpts from Sea and Sardinia published without his knowledge or permission, and disappointing reviews of Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious. By mid-October Lawrence's understandably embattled mood was informing his work in terms of his writing's doctrinal emphasis and narrative tone. He finished revising Fantasia of the Unconscious, adding a petulant Foreword that is often witty but pervasively belittling of his readers, and in which the typing of the gender roles of male-leader and female-follower becomes even more emphatic in revision. After he finished the major changes to The Fox during the next few weeks (by November 5th), he favorably received the invitation from Mabel Dodge to go west and visit Taos, New Mexico. By November 16th he finished revising the short tale into the novella, but that productive few weeks may have been affected by Lawrence's discovery of still another of Frieda's affairs. This most recent speculation (dating to 1990) on Frieda's sex life involves rumors about intimacy between her and a young man of twenty-four, Peppino D'Allura, which relevant evidence and circumstance suggest might have taken place between October 21 and December 15-corresponding precisely to the period of Lawrence's creation of the tentatively-concluding novella of The Fox immediately after the ideologically unequivocal revisions of Fantasia of the Unconscious. (See Kinkead-Weekes 653-64.) Might not the uncertainty and fatigue at the end of the novella reflect Lawrence's fictionalized expression of persistent failure-now bitterly corroborated by Frieda's latest betrayal-to</page><page sequence="19">D.H.LAWRENCE / 229 convince his wife of her need to support him loyally and without any threat to the "passionate purpose" of his work? Might it not also reflect his growing intimations, spurred by his chronic chest congestion and near-fatal flu in 1919, of his own inability to satisfy Frieda in bed? There exists compelling evidence that Lawrence's total impotence dates from an illness in Mexico in 1925, but might not a weakened Lawrence have faced periodic intimations of this problem in earlier years?10 And finally, might not the anger and frustration of his relationship with Frieda in the fall of 1921 inform the portrait of Henry Grenfel's fearful contemplation of sex with robust March? Or perhaps the intimations are even more dramatic. The tepid passions at the end of The Fox might also reveal, in the inevitable manner of the Freudian unconscious, and in the context of his increasing attention after the war to themes of male leadership and Blutbruderschaft, over-fond recollections of his friendship with William Henry Hocking enacted not far from the setting of The Fox. It is interesting that when Henry is first aware of the sexual configuration of March's body, its appeal to him is phrased in an unfeminine metaphor that recalls expressions of admiration by Lawrence of the youthful demeanor and physicality of Hocking: "her figure, like a graceful young man's, piqued him" (23).n Speculation has persisted for years over whether any sexual episode actually occurred between Lawrence and Hocking, and I tend to agree with Kinkead-Weekes's judicious and fair-minded discussion that such a consummated connection was unlikely. But few critics dispute the strong homosexual elements in Lawrence's inclinations, and such an affinity in him returns this essay to where it began: to a concept of dream interpretation that must take precedence over Lawrence's asserted disbelief in such a probing process. In a letter to Katherine Mansfield in 1919 (between the first and second versions of The Fox), Lawrence writes: Frieda said you were cross with me, that I repulsed you. I'm sure I didn't. The complication of getting Jack and you and F. and me in a square seems great-especially Jack. But you I am sure of-I was ever since Cornwall, save for Jack-and if you must go his way, and if he will never really come our way-well! But things will resolve themselves. I dreamed such a vivid dream of you last night. I dreamed you came to Cromford, and stayed there.... It was night, and very starry. We looked at the stars and they were different. All the constellations were different, and I, who was looking for Orion, to show you, because he is rising now, was very puzzled by these thick, close brilliant new constellations. Then suddenly we saw one planet, so beautiful, a large, fearful, strong star, that we were both pierced by it, possessed for a second. Then I said, "That's Jupiter"-but I felt that it wasn't Jupiter-at least not the everyday Jupiter. Ask Jung or Freud about it? Never! It was a star that blazed for a second on one's soul. I wish it was spring for us all. {Letters HI 343)</page><page sequence="20">230 / BALBERT Lawrence's disapproval of psychoanalytic methodology once again remains unconvincing in light of the accessible clues in the dream. What must emerge from the dream is the announcement of his frustrating failure to convince Katherine and Jack Murry of the viability of the close male friendship that Lawrence depicts in Women in Love and several other fictions, a theme he will develop more fully in the leadership novels of the 1920s. That "beautiful, large, fearful, strong star" that "pierces" and "possesses" both Katherine and Lawrence sounds very much like the coded expression of a sexual fantasy about the male third party mentioned elsewhere in the letter. Later still, "Ask Jung or Freud about? Never!" There is no reason to ask them anything, but not for the reason Lawrence asserts. Like the palimpsestic texture of The Fox, the evidence of influence, doctrine, and desire remains inscribed no matter how many erasures, revisions, or protestations Lawrence makes on the rich text of his life and art. TRINITY UNIVERSITY NOTES 1 For an excellent summary of various perspectives on this novella by a wide range of critics, see the balanced discussion by Harris 163, 284-85. Among the most persuasive and admiring discussions of The Fox are Leavis 256-65, Hough 176-77, Moynahan 196-209, and Ruderman, D. H. Lawrence 48-70. For the critical opinion that variously regards the work as incoherent, mean-spirited, or unconvincing, see Gregor 10-21, Harris 163-70, Ford 101-02, Draper 186-98, Rossi 265-78, Davis 565-71, and Wolkenfeld 345-52. Simpson 70-73, Davis, and Millett 265 provide what I feel to be reductive readings of the work as an unqualified attack against women. In addition, while Harris properly acknowledges Gurko 178-82, Moynahan, and Allen 109 as specifically emphasizing mythic dimensions in The Fox, the approaches of these critics do not deal with the pervasive influence of Frazer on the work, or with the totemic patterns of primitive belief that inform much of Lawrence's organization of the story. There exists no psychoanalytical treatment of the work except for a short essay by Bergler, and his criticism is exclusively concerned with establishing (too simply, in my view) a formulaic reading of what he regards as a prototypical lesbian relationship between March and Banford. 2 Among the critics who consider the important ambivalence of the ending, see Brayfield 41-51, Fulmer 75-82, and Ruderman, "Lawrence's 'The Fox' and Verga's 'The She Wolf" 53 65. 3 For an intelligent and focused discussion of the "nightmarish" aspects of these years for Lawrence, see Delany 265-380 and Squires and Talbot 173-249. But the most sustained and brilliant achievement in integrating Lawrence's life and work is unquestionably by Kinkead Weekes in the relevant section (346-673) of his comprehensive volume of biography. Although I take occasional issue in this essay with some of his conclusions, my admiration for his brilliant and thoroughly professional scholarship is unqualified; I trust it is evident in my own analysis of The Fox how much I have benefited by the many rich areas for investigation that his research stimulated me to undertake. 4 For a more extensive consideration of Lawrence's views on the instinctual imperative and on his notions of "otherness" and "the unknown," see Balbert, "Lady Chatterley's Lover to The Deer Park" and "Pan and the Appleyness of Landscape." See also Letters II470. 5 Impressive exceptions here are Vickery, "Myth and Ritual" 79-82 and Ruderman, D. H. Lawrence 52. See also Vickery's Literary Impact (322).</page><page sequence="21">D.H.LAWRENCE / 231 6 On this issue of Lawrence's frequent use of blackness leading to transcendence, and its relation to his style and ideology, see Balbert, "Scorched Ego," "Ten Men," and D. H. Lawrence (chapters two and five). See also Lawrence's "Morality and the Novel" 193-98. 7 Freud and Lawrence are in surprising agreement about the totemic and erotic terror that is often embodied in dreams of wild animals. Lawrence discusses a nightmare about horses in Fantasia, and concludes The Rainbow with a vignette of Ursula's dream-like experience with the horses. He describes a male's relevant dream as evidence that "the great sensual male activity is the greatest menace" (Fantasia 9) for the dreamer, and it is reasonable to see March's dream of the fox as a female variant of that pattern. 8 See Daleski's still unsurpassed study of Lawrence's use of the flame metaphor. I discuss the Lawrencian concept of "forging" in chapter one of D. H. Lawrence. In relation to Lawrence's graphic imagery of the elongated brush and its position near the anus, I am not unaware of the ample evidence of Lawrence's fascination both with anal eroticism, especially in The Rainbow and Women in Love, and with the resonant symbology of the "signifying" buttocks, memorably employed in his essay, "Adolph," a short work that also emphasizes the prominent brush of an animal. But against the conceivable argument that I have psychoanalyzed March's dream as if she were a real person rather than a fictional character, I call attention to the significant extent to which Lawrence's characteristically prophetic and "intrusive" art militates against such a methodological danger; that is, Lawrence's visionary beliefs often graphically intrude on the individuality of his characters, permitting excellent critics of his work (such as Kinkead-Weekes, Ruderman, and Vickery) the galvanizing liberty of the kind of dream analysis I undertake in this essay. Since an orthodox psychoanalytical approach to images in March's dreams sheds at least as much light on the obsessions of the novelist as on the fictional character, such interpretive "doubling" remains a welcome byproduct of any well-integrated, psychobiographical speculation on Lawrence's life and art. 9 This passage offers striking resemblance in its tone, phrasing, and meaning to the awed and intimate awareness of Connie Chatterley of the "otherness" of Mellors and of the frictive beauty of his phallus. 10 This issue of Lawrence's sexual difficulties is examined more fully in Balbert, "Scorched Ego," 399-401, Kinkead-Weekes 577, Meyers 204-07, 331-32, and Spilka 70-95. There is a compelling fact in Henry's recent history that contributes to his palpable immaturity, and it is engrained in a pathetic aspect of England's involvement in the war. He mentions that he just came "from Salonika really" (15), and as noted in the admirably meticulous "Explanatory Notes" apparatus of the novella, this Greek port "was the scene of a rather futile Allied expedition in October 1915. Between 1916 and the end of the war, 600,000 men, 200,000 of them British," were interned at Salonika by a Bulgarian army that, other than enforcing this internment, had no other significant participation in the war (239). Henry also mentions that he "hadn't heard for three or four years" anything about his grandfather, a period of time that corresponds to the internment at Salonika (14). Thus the young man's role in the war was static, limited, and conspicuously lacking in combat or travel experience, and thus provided little opportunity to develop any confidence in the masculine authority that is often the byproduct of the varied challenges accumulated as a solider. It is as if time has stood still for him at a critical point in his post-adolescent maturation, and it is then that he encounters March and Banford. 11 For more detailed accounts, speculative as well as factual, of Lawrence's relationship with William Henry Hocking, see Kinkead-Weekes 379-81, Meyers 213-14, and Delany 309-15.
