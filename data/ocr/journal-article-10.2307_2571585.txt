<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ROLE OF THE BABY IN THE PLACEMENT PROCESS. Philadelphia: Pennsylvania School of Social Work of the University of Pennsylvania, 1946. 113 pp. $0.85. Paper. So limited is our knowledge of infant psychology, and so hesitant some of the case work with babies, that any contribution to either field is welcome. Precisely because of the wide gaps in our present information these problems should be approached with caution and due regard for proving and test- ing all deductions. It is at this point that the collection of articles is disappointing. Dr. Jessie Taft sounds not only the keynote but the whole tone of the booklet in two statements, one made in her concluding, and the other in her introductory essay: "The material in this pam- phlet is functionally based as to practice, and rests on a conception of psychological growth and of the nature of professional helping that, for the Penn- sylvania School, had its final theoretical formula- tion in the psychology of Otto Rank." And, "To the uninitiated, these records of baby placement may seem like fairy tales invented to make a traumatic situation less painful, and the observa- tions of the workers may seem nothing but pure projection, not unlike the anthropomorphic projections of the unscientific animal lover, but to trained case workers who have learned to accept child placement as a legitimate service and who have lived through its detail unflinchingly, these articles will make a contribution to practice." The reader who does not happen to accept the psychology of Otto Rank as "final" will find little that is satisfying in the book. Many who do start with the Rankian hypotheses will have grave questions about the tendency of these writers to attribute their own ideas, not to say fancies, to young babies. The first of the three articles, written by Miss Mary Frances Smith, describes the reorganization of a child caring agency to bring it in accord with functional social work theories. While the final result is not strikingly different from numerous other such agencies which have evolved with less self-consciousness, this analysis of structure is excellent, and will be helpful to those interested in such problems. The last two essays, one by Miss Louise Leather- land and another by Miss Florence M. Pyle, depict in vivid detail the actions and reactions of two case workers and some dozen or more babies receiving temporary foster care or facing permanent adoptive placement. Social work has needed this step by step delineation of its procedures, and is indebted to the authors for emphasizing that phase of their activities. The debt would be considerably greater if the interpretation of the situations pre- sented did not strain credulity, without presenting anything worthy of the name of proof. That even new born infants are aware of changed surroundings, and may be sensitive to the tensions of adults who care for them, is accepted by all who work with babies. But to attribute to a baby too young to talk or walk ability to understand the significance of meeting new parents, willingness to undergo the pain of parting with old associations, and conscious desire to accept the hazard of the coming experience and thereby participate ac- tively, requires more convincing evidence than these case workers have provided. The reader may revert to Dr. Taft's introductory remarks and, in spite of much experience in placing children in</page><page sequence="2">LIBRARY AND WORKSHOP 239 foster homes, he may share the reactions of "the uninitiated."
