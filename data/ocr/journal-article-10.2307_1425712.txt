<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHAEL SILVER Soft Cartography: Furnishing Yale University the Post-Proportional Body Point clouds are typically produced by 3D scanning devices that measure the reflection of laser light, bouncing off an object or body. Some technologies utilize an automated sensor or haptic probe to gen- erate "clouds," whereas others use flat, optically projected grids whose distortions across a nonregu- lar surface are used to digitally interpolate three- dimensional shapes. Given the capacity and speed of today's com- puters, an extremely dense collection of measured points can be stored, manipulated, and displayed. These "soft" cartographic technologies accommo- date irregular forms that cannot be conventionally described by ideal geometries, linear perspective, flat photographs, or paper maps. By abandoning the tendency to generalize reality, digital cartographic technologies cast into doubt the way ergonomic surveys determine the measurement and representation of organic bodies. These new techniques of space mapping challenge two seemingly fundamental assumptions about the relationship between the body and architecture. The first is that a building's proportions must by neces- sity base itself on standardized dimensions culled from the survey of a limited human population. The second assumption maintains the belief that these measurements should be organized for aesthetic reasons according to the logic of a preestablished algorithm. By linking proportional harmonies like the golden section with attempts to standardize anthro- pomorphic measurement, a system such as Le Cor- busier's Modular perpetuates the formation of a normative order while in the same turn reinforcing our tendency to search for relationships that con- form to an abstract mathematical rigor. The modular was therefore based on a twofold prejudice: that perfect bodies conform to an aver- age set of dimensions and that these measurements should be organized according to an a priori mathe- matical order. Although our current preferences for size, shape, and weight may have changed, our dependence on standards has not. On the other hand, a "post-proportional" body exists without a specified mass, regularity, or standardized appear- ance. It is not an average body; it is everybody. Non-ideal systems of measurement based on soft cartographic technologies allow us to recon- sider the long-standing practice of organizing the world according to a precalculated framework of dimensions inherited from narrow surveys of military personnel, ergonomic charts, and industrial stan- dards. The so-called imperfections, which distin- guish good forms from bad, and the differences that do not follow preestablished standards can be imaged and robotically materialized in ways that were unthinkable only a decade ago. In this scenario, the idea of deviance disap- pears along with preconceptions about what consti- tutes the normal body. Here, notions of physical health (properly the subject of medicine) are detached from bodily images circulated in the media and supported by historically narrow aesthetic crite- ria. A person can be overweight and in risk of a heart attack while in the same turn perceived as physically desirable, just as runway models are con- sidered attractive even though they appear anorexic. Portrait Chairs: Project Description To depart from design strategies based on the direct application of anthropomorphic data obtained from the average of a limited sample population is to challenge the relevance that statistical surveys play in the production of form. Chair designs built from molds cast directly from the human form are certainly nothing new. These designs however, rely on modes of production heavily invested in techniques of manual labor. The construction of these works adheres to a practice of craft, which limit their number and ease of produc- tion, making them difficult to produce in large quantities. With new techniques of digital mapping and fabrication, the same benefits of customized tailoring can be mechanized, allowing for the robotic production of a large differential series. For the Portrait Chair project, a 3D optical scanner was used to design furniture that precisely fits the contours of a single user. From the scanner, the data was fed into a large CNC mill, which pro- duced the final chair. In this way, we were able to demonstrate an efficient method for mass- customizing marketable products from digitally acquired, site-specific spatial data. No standard of average ergonomic data is put forward as the driv- ing geometry for the chair. Journal of Architectural Education, pp. 44-47 ? 2002 ACSA, Inc.
