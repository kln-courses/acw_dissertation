<plain_text><page sequence="1">LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 77 THE COAL TIT AS A CAREFUL SHOPPER The interrelation between economics and biological sciences has perhaps been less obvious in recent years than it was in the days of Malthus, Darwin, and Wallace. Still, structural similarities between the two fields do exist, and the recent interest in ecology has led a great many economists to become concerned with biological problems and biologists to become con- cerned with economic problems (Hardin 1968; Tullock 1970). The par- ticular interrelation between economics and biology discussed in this article is not a direct result of concern about pollution, but it may be that I-an economist-read Lack (1966) as an indirect consequence of concern with the problems of pollution and population. Regardless of the reasons, it is true that I was reading Lack's book, and in it I came across a summary of the work of J. Gibb on the consumption of the eucosmid moth Ernarmonia conicolana by coal tits which contains a figure (reproduced here) which looks surprisingly like a standard economic demand and supply diagram (p. 396). A little examination indicated that it was not a true demand and supply curve, but nevertheless that economic principles do apply quite readily. Indeed, it can be said that the coal tits are maximizing the return to their labor in searching out food supplies. We need not, of course, argue that the coal tits have thought the matter out in the same way that human beings would. Presumably, they have inherited an efficient pattern of behavior resulting from natural selection which would eliminate inefficient heritable behavior patterns. Before discussing this matter, however, it would be best to explain very briefly the data assembled by Gibb (1958, 1962). In the winter, the coat tit eats the larvae of E. conicolacna dormant in small cavities just under the surface of pine cones. The coal tit finds them by tapping the outside of the cone. Fortunately, from the standpoint of the ecologist, it is possible to tell by looking at the pine cone in the spring whether any individual larva was eaten by the coal tit, destroyed by some other cause, or survived and became a moth. By examining the pine cones in various portions of the forest, Gibb first determined how many larvae had been in the pine cones the preceding fall. The result, arranged in order of density from left to right, is shown as the upper line in figure 1. The gently curving lines-A, B, and C-drawn in on the figure are my contribution, and were not on Gibb 's original diagram. The shaded area shows the number of E. conicolana larvae who survived predation by coal tits in each area. The space between the shaded area and the upper line is the number of grubs of E. conicolana consumed by the coal tits. The pattern of consumption is said by Lack to be "density de- pendent," and Gibb offers as an explanation a concept called "hunting by expectation." It seems to me, however, that a much simpler explanation exists. The birds are behaving much like a careful housewife; that is, they</page><page sequence="2">78 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST 0 o 60 0 0 z -j 0 A 0 2 40 0 0 2 Z 20 L.L 0 a: DIFFERENT LOCALITIES FIG. 1.-Numbers of Ernarmonia conicolana larvae per 100 cones in 21 localities, arranged in descending order of initial intensity of larvae. Upper (hollow) "skyline" graph gives initial number of larvae, lower (shaded) graph the number after predation by tits in the winter of 1955-66. The two curves A and B, are eyefit curves approximating the two skyline graphs. Curve C is a hypothesized intermediate stage during the predation season. (Modified from figure 3 in Gibb [1958].) are shopping in the cheapest market. This human analogy may seem bizarre, but I hope to prove it is not misleading. The amount of energy put into seeking out each E. conicolana larva is, in a way, a "price" which the bird must pay to consume the larva. It is clear that any animal, in order to remain alive, must be economical in its use of energy to obtain food. An inherited behavior pattern which led to such economy would have survival value, not only in consumption of E. conicolana but in many other types of food as well. This presents us with a rather simple economic problem. First, note that the amount of pine cone tapping which would be necessary to find an un- consumed larva would be inversely proportional to the density of these larvae in any given area. In other words, the "price" which the coal tit must pay for each larva it consumes is the reciprocal of the density at any given time. Just as a careful housewife will buy at a cheaper shop, one should anticipate that the coal tit would seek its grubs in those areas where the energy cost would be lowest. There is, however, an important difference between the housewife and the bird, in that the housewife can discover the prices in different shops</page><page sequence="3">LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 79 without affecting the stock-in-trade held by the shops; she notes the price, but does not buy if it is high. The bird, however, would fly from place to place and explore the density of grubs by tapping a number of pine cones. Even in low-density areas (such as those at the right of the distribution in the figure), this would lead to some consumption of grubs. Hence, one would anticipate that there would be at least some reduction in the number of larvae by coal tit predation in all areas. This is the coal tit equivalent of comparison shopping. Basically, however, the bulk of the predation would occur in those areas in which the grubs were commonest. Note that as the winter went on, and grubs were eaten in the areas where they were densest, the density there would fall, and a switch of effort to other areas would become desirable. We would anticipate that at any time during the winter the general structure of the surviving larvae population would follow roughly the conformation of the dotted line. There would be an approximately flat plateau on the left and, on the right, a line which more or less followed the original density but was lower. The search process would probably lead to the plateau actually slanting somewhat to the right, and that portion of the line to the right of the inflection point gradually approaching the original density to the right. By spring, a line similar to that which was found in Gibb's empirical investigation would be expected. Note that this hypothesis is empirically testable. It predicts that the dis- tribution of surviving larvae in pine plantations from month to month during the winter should follow a series of progressively lower lines, each characterized by a plateau on the left and a curving structure on the right. If this does not turn up empirically, the theory would be falsified. So far, however, I have simply argued by analogy to the housewife 's behavior. It is not immediately obvious that bird behavior patterns would duplicate human behavior. If we assume, however, that the bird has in- herited reasonably efficient patterns of behavior, then we can obtain the same result. Assume that the bird, like any other food-consuming animal, explores a number of different food sources, and then settles on the one which provides the most food with the least energy expended. Since it would tend to exhaust the food supplies in that particular area, it should be "programmed"2 in such a way that it periodically investigates different areas. If I may put it in anthropomorphic terms, the animal should be hungry, lazy, and curious. We need not assume that the bird has feelings which are close to these human emotions, but a behavior pattern which leads to a similar output would be relatively easy to conceive of. Its survival value is, I take it, obvious. A bird that did not inherit behavior patterns which led it to economize on the energy investment in obtaining its food would presumably not survive very long. It may surprise biologists and certainly will surprise economists to learn that it is possible to use segments of economic theory to explain biological phenomena. Nevertheless, it seems to me that the problems of biologists are difficult enough so that they should seek help wherever it seems to them that their particular competence may be of value.

The fact that the link is not one of major importance is unfortunate, but such interconnections seem worthwhile even if they are on a small scale. LITERATURE CITED Gibb, J. 1958.
