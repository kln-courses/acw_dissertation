April 29, 2010 A regular meeting of the council of the AAHM being called to order in the Historical Suite of the Plummer Building, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, at 1:00 p.m. with President W. Bruce Fye presiding, the coun- cil welcomed the following new councilors (class of 2012): Carla Keirns, Gerald Oppenheimer, Heather Prescott, and Sarah Tracy. The council reviewed and approved the minutes of the 2009 council meeting from the Bulletin of the History of Medicine 83(3), 2009: 561-95. The council reviewed and approved the minutes of the AAHM council telephone conference held December 16, 2009, which were distributed to council. The council then discussed and accepted the following reports of the secretary and treasurer, received and reviewed the following reports from the association's standing and ad hoc committees, and took the follow- ing actions. Report of the Secretary (Christopher Crenner) Over the twelve months since the last annual meeting, the association has completed a number of important projects and turned aside at least one potential hazard. We had an expertly run meeting in Cleveland, which returned a balance of over $10,000 to the association. We now stand ready to launch the meeting in Rochester, Minnesota, with a record number of new research papers on the agenda. We have successfully transferred the archives of the AAHM to the National Library of Medicine. In addition, the close affiliation with the Bulletin of the History of Medicine has gained new visibility with the inclusion of councilors and officers on the publica- tion masthead. We also have ready now a major revision and updating of the Blue Book, supervised by Pat Gerstner, who played a key role in the Cleveland meeting. Finally, the AAHM won release from an agreement to hold the annual meeting in Galveston in 2013, which was judged to be a risky undertaking for the association. From the view in the secretary's office, there are two important chal- lenges in the immediate future. The association needs first to resolve the status of a pending capital campaign. Second, the association needs to move to address vigorously the attrition in its membership roles. Infor- mation relevant to both issues appears on the agenda for the council meeting.</page><page sequence="22">488 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE In the remaining portions of this report I would like to provide detail in three areas of responsibility for the Secretary's office: administration, publications, and budget. Administration. Thanks to Jim Edmonson, who is the association's representative member in Ohio, for his assistance in coordinating the renewal of the AAHM Foundation's nonprofit status through the Ohio state system. Among committees that had changes during the year the most notable was the Ad Hoc Committee on Student Affairs, for which Jacob Steere- Williams has accepted the position of chair on short notice. The figures on growth in new memberships for the prior ten years are as follows: 2009 123 2008 146 2007 116 2006 151 2005 118 2004 112 2003 211 2002 85 2001 68 2000 115 1999 88 There was a decline in membership from last year. Looking at the most recent numbers reported from the Johns Hopkins University Press, there were 1,016 paid members registered in early April 2010. At the same point in April 2009 there were 1,106 paid members. The overall decline in mem- bership was about 8 percent. Interestingly, this decline was greatest among regular, U.S. members, with a loss of 12 percent. The farther from regular membership one looks, the more faithful-appearing the group. Among the smaller number of members outside the United States, the decline was only 8 percent; while among members outside of North America and among our student members the relative declines were 1 percent and 1.5 percent. Is it possible that those closest to the organization tend to take membership for granted? I would like to acknowledge the loss of a following long-time member: Dr. Charles (Chuck) Gordon Roland, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada Publications. Transition to a digital version of the Membership Directory has been made this year. Recall that the Directory is published by this office</page><page sequence="23">Report of the Eighty-Third Annual Meeting 489 every two years. In its most recent, previous form, the printed directory was mailed out to all members every two years at a cost of over $14,000. At the direction of council, we distributed to all members a link to the digital version and invited requests from those who also wanted a printed version mailed out. We received three requests. There were a number of remaining paper copies from the small printing. We have been distribut- ing these to the chairs of the committees to assist with their work. Budget. For 2010 we will budget for total expenses of $81,530. The exercise of setting a proposed yearly budget began in 2009. Last year we projected a total budget for 2009 and presented it to the 2009 council meeting (Council Book, 2009, p. 12). We estimated expenses of $97,960 for the year. The actual expenses for 2009, detailed in the accountant's report, were $80,777. There was a favorable variance of $17,183. The largest difference between the projected and actual expenses came from the unanticipated decline in membership. The cost to the association for subscriptions to the Bulletin and membership services were $18,447 less than projected, accounting for all of the favorable variance. As you know, I have indicated my desire to step down from the secre- tary's post in 2011. Planning for the transition has already begun under the leadership of Janet Golden, who is heading an ad hoc committee to examine the question. It seems premature to be offering an exit speech. But I will repeat what an honor it is to serve in this capacity on behalf of an organization that is so vital and dear to me. Report of the Treasurer on Financial Status of the AAHM (Margaret Marsh) Introduction. 2009 was a less tumultuous year financially for the AAHM than the prior year. In 2008 we experienced the fallout from the financial meltdown, and the value of our investments lessened considerably. Even though 2009 brought significant recovery in our investments, the finan- cial markets remained somewhat tenuous, and they are likely to remain so in 2010. In response to the new investment realities of the period, the Finance Committee (Gerald Grob, Hughes Evans, and James Bono, chair) and the treasurer recommended to the officers of the AAHM that we move to a conservative investment strategy for AAHM funds and a moderate investment strategy for the History of Medicine Endowment Funds. Both of these changes were approved and implemented.</page><page sequence="24">490 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE Summary of the Financial Status of the Association. This report to council customarily covers the three major sections of our fiscal accounts in three different formats that are appropriate to the accounts. I. The annual report of our accountant on finances of the association as managed through our accounts at Merrill Lynch. A. The review and financial statement from our accountants show that the association's finances recovered substantially from the losses of 2008. Unrestricted assets of the association rose from $317,575 to $386,921. [Financial Statement, p. 505]. Our net gain on marketable securities was $56,727. Investment income was down from $7,300 to $6,640. [Financial Statement, p. 505] Membership dues collected in the year were down for another year, from $81,723 to $68,397. B. Notable changes reflected on the balance sheet on page 505 between 2008 and 2009: 1 . Investment income reflects the return of interest and divi- dends on the association's investment accounts. There was a decrease in this amount, from $7,300 to $6,640. The net gain on marketable securities reflects the increase in the value of the equities held through mutual funds. 2. Revenue listed under awards is money paid by the History of Medicine Foundation (HMF) to support the annual prizes given at the banquet by the association. Publications expenses in 2008 increased. (We publish the Membership Directory in odd-numbered years.) 3. Administrative expenses in 2008 increased because the treasurer and the secretary now both receive funding to support their administrative activities - $5,000 was paid for support to the secretary and $3,000 for support to the treasurer. Accounting fees also rose $2,000. 4. The 2009 annual meeting was very successful financially as well as in other ways, providing $12,071 in profit to the AAHM. II. The year-end fiscal statements by Merrill Lynch on the portfolio of the association's endowment management accounts (EMA). The holdings in the investment accounts of the association are invested according to the policy approved by the council in 1999 at the New Brunswick meeting of the association. In November 2008 the Finance Committee reviewed and reaffirmed this policy. Working within those guidelines, the Finance Committee and treasurer, with approval from the officers, made important changes to our</page><page sequence="25">Report of the Eighty-Third Annual Meeting 491 overall investment strategy, which resulted in a more conservatively invested portfolio. III. Report of the holdings and status of the major investment accounts of the separate entity, The History of Medicine Foundation (HMF), which follow. In order to simplify our investments, as a part of our reallocation strategy the HMF merged its three general purpose endowment accounts into one account. As a result, the HMF now has five separate accounts instead of seven. Their year-end balances for December 2009 are: A. Prize Endowment Account: annual prize, not-otherwise sup- ported, $300,616 (Up from $261,509 as of 12/31/08) B. Pressman Account: annual Pressman Burroughs-Wellcome award, $62,433 (Up from $55,028 as of 12/31/08) C. Estes Fund Account: annual Estes Prize, $14,772 (Up from $13,269 as of 12/31/08) D. Rosen Account: to provide when mature for annual Rosen prize, $25,142. This includes a new gift of $2,000 in 2009. (On 12/31/08, this fund was worth $21,886.) E. General HMF Account, labeled "Executive Director Fund": This fund incorporates the three general HMF accounts (General, Executive Director 1, and Executive Director 2) and includes a $100,000 gift from the Mabel Reeder Founda- tion: $399,686. The total amount in Endowment Funds as of 12/31/09 was $801,649. This includes the gifts to the general endowment and the Rosen Fund of $102,000. (On 12/31/08, the total amount was $604,558.) Total assets of AAHM and the HMF Foundation. As of 12/31/2009, the total assets of the AAHM and the HMF combined grew from $922,133 to $1,188,570, including the gifts noted in item E, above.

Council approved subject to funding a motion to establish a first book prize selected yearly by a committee of the AAHM that would poten- tially carry a donor's name and tasked John Parascandola to pursue this opportunity. Council approved the motion made by the chair of the 2010 Pressman Burroughs-Wellcome Career Development Award Committee, Conevery Bolton Valenčius, to change the wording of the prize announcement to indicate that it is for work in the history of medicine "and biomedical sci- ences," in order to clarify the intention of the award. Council approved a motion brought by Carla Cairns and revised by the acceptance of several friendly amendments to increase annual dues effec- tive for the AAHM for 2011 according to the following schedule: $100 regular membership $125 family membership $50 for individuals with income &lt;$30k Student membership, constituent society membership, and lifetime membership to remain the same. The council moved by general acclaim to offer thanks to Jacob Steere- Williams for stepping in to lead the Ad Hoc Committee on Student Affairs with its successful work in support of the 2010 annual meeting. Standing Committee Reports Osier Medal Committee. The Osier Medal Committee (Douglas R. Bacon, chair; Ronald Batt, Sandra Moss, Jock Murray, and Hector Ventura) is pleased to announce the winner of this year's Osier Medal competition, Elliott Weiss, for his essay, "Avoiding the Controversial: United States Phy- sicians' Response to the Eugenic Social Policies, 1910-1940." The committee recommends two honorable mentions: Sarah Dolgo- nos, for her essay, "Group Dynamics, Nameless Pursuits: Group-Without- A-Name International Psychiatric Research Society, 1958-1978"; and Michael Winstead, for his essay, "Diagnosis of Inclusion: Making Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in the Twentieth Century." Seventeen papers were submitted to the contest this year, and nine were ranked by committee members. There was no clear-cut, unanimous winner. It is a tribute to the scholarship of medical students that so many high-quality papers were placed in competition.</page><page sequence="27">Report of the Eighty-Third Annual Meeting 493 Shryock Medal Committee. The Shryock Medal Award Committee (Sally Romano, chair ; Jeremy Greene, Michael Sappol, Jason Szabo, and Dominique Tobbell) received and reviewed twenty submissions for the 2010 Shryock Medal Award. The winner of the 2010 medal is Carin Berkowi tz for her paper, "The Aesthetics of Anatomy: Visual Displays and Surgical Education in Early Nineteenth-Century London." Welch Medal Committee. The Welch Medal Committee (Caroline Han- naway, chair; Susan Jones, Susan Lawrence, David Rosner, and George Weisz) is pleased to announce that the Welch Medal winner is Warwick Anderson for his book The Collectors of Lost Souls : Turning Kuru Scientists into Whitemen (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008). Committee members were struck by the originality of the book, by the extensive research over many years that went into its writing, and by the fascinating and compel- ling account of the interaction of Western scientists with the Fore people of New Guinea. Prospective committee members should know that work on this com- mittee requires a lot of reading. The committee reviewed nearly fifty books published in the years 2004-2008 for the award. Some books were nominated by authors, some by publishers, and some by individuals. The chair would like to thank committee members for all their hard work. She would also like to recommend that the AAHM Council give thought to setting up another book prize for the association, perhaps for first books, as there is a wealth of scholarship in the history of medicine field that deserves recognition. This might be something that an indi- vidual who wants to give to the AAHM would like to endow. Lifetime Achievement Award Committee. The committee was com- posed of Ann Carmichael, Ronald Numbers, and Todd Savitt (chair). We communicated via e-mail. Members proposed several names, but the unanimous first choice was Charles Rosenberg. He has contributed over many years to the scholarship of our field and to the AAHM. We are pleased to nominate him to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award this year. Estes Prize Committee. The Estes Prize Committee (Mike Flannery, Alain Touwaide, and Sylvia Pamboukian) considered six essays: Monica H. Green, "Gendering Women's Healthcare," Gender &amp; Hist. 20(3), 2008: 487-518. Jeremy A. Greene and Scott H. Podolsky, "Keeping Modern in Medi- cine: Pharmaceutical Promotion and Physician Education in Postwar America," Bull. Hist.

After considerable discussion, the majority of the committee elected Patrick Wallis 's essay as the best. This essay provides an interesting exami- nation into material conditions affecting pharmaceutical sales in the con- text of overall practices of consumption, and it elaborates on an important dynamic of pharmacology in a well-researched and thoroughly readable presentation.

The committee (Conevery Bolton Valenčius, chair; Keith Wailoo, and Erika Dyck) received ten applications, from a range of schools, geographies, and areas of focus. The selection procedure was essentially the same as in previous years. The committee is very pleased to award the 2010 Pressman-Burroughs Wellcome Award to Matthew Smith for his project Food for Thought : Hyper- activity , Food Additives and the Feingold Diet. Dr. Smith earned his Ph.D. in 2009 at the Centre for Medical History, University of Exeter. He is currently a Wellcome Trust Post-Doctoral Fel- low at the Centre for Medical History, University of Exeter. Food for Thought merges elements of environmental, food, childhood and medical history and promises to offer an in-depth cultural history of this epidemic childhood disorder in a manner that embraces current historiographical trends. Matthew Smith is crafting a history that will be of use both to those in the midst of active debates about hyperactivity in children and to those interested in writing careful histories of medicine, medical science, and healthcare. This promises to be an original, syn- thetic, and broadly appealing book that we on the committee are most eager to read.

The committee (James Connor, Mary Fisseli, Steven Peitzman, Scott Podolsky, and Arlene Tuchman) reviewed the desired attributes for the lecturer as described in the AAHM bylaws, and in addition agreed that effectiveness as a lecturer would also be a consideration, along with the expected level of scholarship. We chose to propose that Martin Pernick be invited to present the lecture for 2011. The decision was unanimous. The chair shall confidentially pass along to the next Garrison Com- mittee chairperson the names of the worthy individuals also strongly considered. Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee of the Ameri- can Association for the History of Medicine (Allan M. Brandt, chair; Joel Howell, and Ann LaBerge) nominates the following members for the positions of: President: John M. Eyler (two-year term) Vice President: Nancy Tomes (two-year term) Council Member: David Barnes, David Jones, Susan Jones, Wendy Kline (three-year terms beginning 201 1 ) Local Arrangements Committee. The Cleveland contingent (James Edmonson, chair; Patsy Gerstner, Jennifer Nieves, Laura Travis, Mark Eddy, and Jonathan Sadowsky) was successful in seeking funds to defray the cost of meeting expenses, thus keeping down the cost of registration to individuals attending the 2009 AAHM meeting. Gifts and donations to the Local Arrangements Committee (LAC) amounted to $41,500. Pro- jected meeting expenses proved in excess of charges incurred and monies spent. As a result, after all expenses and obligations were met, we ended with a net surplus of $23,979.68, which was returned to the AAHM. This sum represents the AAHM start-up fund of $4,000, as well as the remain- ing account balance of $19,979.68. For the successful hosting of this meeting the chair benefited from an exceptional team on the LAC. Planning and logistics went back yet another year before that. The great success of the event, remarked upon by so many who attended the meeting, came about through super collab- orative efforts by Dittrick staff and colleagues across the College of Arts and Sciences of Case Western Reserve University. Patsy Gerstner (Dittrick emerita) took point on hotel logistics and planning, while the chair con- ducted necessary fundraising. Jennifer Nieves (Dittrick registrar and archi- vist) handled registration, transportation, and many other aspects of local arrangements, while Laura Travis (Dittrick assistant curator) did program brochure layout and printing, and many other graphics. Mark Eddy (Kel- vin Smith Library) did yeoman's work directing the always popular rare</page><page sequence="30">496 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE book dealers and university press display. Jonathan Sadowsky (History) became liaison to the program committee, and read abstracts and helped craft the final selection of papers. Volunteers and students who helped make the event successful included: Dianne O'Malia, Nora Blackman, Lynne Graziano, Richard Cartabuke, Jeannette DeGuire, Elizabeth Salem, Katherine Schaub, Kathryn Goldberg, and Gretchen Hallerberg. The board of the CMLA graciously hosted the Garrison Lecture in our Ford Auditorium, and Dzwinka Holian (Allen Memorial Medical Library) made sure the catering went well, as always. Some 350 persons crowded into the second floor reading rooms for the reception, and it was a pretty amazing sight. We found ourselves in close quarters indeed, but the food and drink were just great and a spirit of conviviality ruled the day. [A full copy of this extensive report may be found online at: www.histmed.org/documents/ 1 0_lac.pdf] Program Committee. The committee (Howard Markel, chair; Rob- ert Aronowitz, Jeffrey Baker, Harold Cook, Jonathan Sadowsky, Jole Shackelford, Alexandra Stern, and Heinrich Von Staden) received 168 submissions, including 164 digital submissions and 4 electronic mailed submissions. The Oxford Abstracts online submission program provided a mechanism for collecting abstracts in a standard, digital format. Using a prearranged scoring system, the committee independently evaluated and ranked the submissions. It was an excellent program for our purposes. The committee accepted 105 abstracts to be presented as papers at the annual meeting (this figure includes four lunch sessions). Thirty-eight of the remaining sixty-three abstracts that were rejected were placed on a waitlist. Early on, (in February), the presenter of one of the papers originally accepted reported he was unable to attend the meeting. Con- sequently, one paper from the waitlist was accepted to replace this paper. Two other presenters cancelled a few weeks before the meeting, in late March, but there was not enough time to reactivate the waiting list at this time. The schedule followed by this year's program committee was as follows: Deadline for submission of abstracts: September 15 Committee ranks abstracts: completed November 1 Sessions organized by chair: late November and early December Invitations to presenters: December 5 Deadline for presenters to acknowledge they would attend: December 20</page><page sequence="31">Report of the Eighty-Third Annual Meeting 497 Invitations to session chairs: December 27 Submission of program copy to LAC: January 15 Rejections and waitlist: January 23 Instructions to chairs and presenters: February 24 The Plenary Session will include Jonathan Cohn, senior editor of The New Republic , and Daniel M. Fox, President Emeritus of the Milbank Memorial Fund. Dr. Fox and Mr. Cohn will appear in the Plenary Session for the meet- ing as arranged for by the chair of the Program Committee, with the advice and consent of the committee members. The funds to subsidize Mr. Cohn's travel expenses (since he is not an AAHM member and does not routinely attend our meetings) were generously provided by the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine. There will be thirty-five sessions for the 105 accepted papers presented over the three days of the meeting. Four lunch sessions, on Friday and Saturday, and the annual Garrison Lecture given by Katharine Park will round out the program. Publications Committee. (John Harley Warner (chair) , Gregory Higby, Janet Golden). The editors of the Bulletin of the History of Medicine have chosen the following four AAHM members to join the Bulletin's Advisory Editorial Board in 2011, and all have agreed to serve: Harold J. Cook Alice Dreger Richard Keller Heather Munro Prescott Committee on Education and Outreach. The current status of this committee (Mindy A. Schwartz, chair; Lisa Pruitt, Lisa Boult, Gwen Kay, and Jonathan Erlen) is one of slow progress and commitment toward growth and expansion. CME credit. Over the past several years, steady progress has occurred with regard to Continuing Medical Education credit for the organizations' physician staff. These credits are one of several ongoing requirements for maintenance of medical licensure. Acquiring these CME credits have been an important accomplishment. The persistent efforts of Jackie Duffin for the Montreal and Halifax meetings were greatly appreciated. Likewise, CME was coordinated by the University of Rochester and has continued in the recent Cleveland and the upcoming Mayo meetings. Long term, it is hoped that this has the potential to entice more interested clinicians to these meetings. The committee gratefully acknowledges the hard work of many members towards this important goal.</page><page sequence="32">498 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE Formalization of the committee. In order to build a sustainable committee within a national organization, an infrastructure is essential. To begin with, the AAHM is a busy meeting with competing scholarly sessions, engaging lunch sessions, as well as many various specialized breakfast sessions. To plan for the subsequent years, this committee will designate a standing time for the committee to meet at 8 a.m. on the last day of themeeting (the Sunday a.m. spot.) While having an ongoing meeting time is important, it will be equally critical to have closer coordination and interval contact will be initiated this year to achieve meaningful goals. Obtaining new members and retaining members. In previous years, many professional organizations offered their scholarly journals as benefits of formal membership. In the recent past with the online availability of an amazing array of electronic journals, this benefit is no longer an impor- tant perk. The last several years have generated many lively discussions on how the AAHM could increase the number of new members, attract younger members, increase the number of practicing physicians, and identify graduate students whose academic interests would find a home in the organization's multidisciplinary membership. As the lifeblood to maintaining a viable and sustainable organization, new approaches are critically needed. The committee has suggested innovative ideas such as reduced rates for new members, partnering with other national organizations - in his- tory, the humanities, across institutions, and even with national medical student associations. This remains our vital mission. Our goal will be to increase our membership by 5 percent over the next five years. By reach- ing out to uninvolved graduate and medical students and local medical history organizations, we hope to continue to expand our reach. Our primary goal will be to attract new members. Our secondary goal will be to increase the participation and attendance at the next two upcoming meetings (given both the popularity and significance of the locations) . We encourage all members of the organization with innovative ideas to contact the committee through the chair, Mindy Schwartz (mschwart@ medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu) . Other Reports NezvsLetter Editors. During the past year the editors of the AAHM News- Letter (Jodi Koste and Joan Klein) continued planning for the transition to an electronic-only publication as directed by the AAHM council. The planning entailed reviewing the existing print newsletter, selecting useful and popular sections for inclusion in the next-generation publication,</page><page sequence="33">Report of the Eighty-Third Annual Meeting 499 and adding enhancements to the PDF newsletter files currently hosted on the AAHM Web site. The editors submit to the council for its consideration the following plan for the next-generation newsletter: The editors will work with the secretary and webmaster to develop a mechanism for members/institutions who must have a print copy of the newsletter to opt-out of the electronic distribution plan. (May-June 2010) The July issue of the AAHM NewsLetter will be the last regular paper- based newsletter in the current format. Notification of the opt-out plan will be outlined in the July issue. (July 2010) The October issue of the AAHM NewsLetterwill be issued in its existing format but only distributed electronically except to those who registered their interest in opting out. (October 2010) The editors will work with the secretary, webmaster, the Membership Committee, and any others council recommends to develop a "brand" for the AAHM. (May-October 2010) This brand may be use in future Web redesigns and will form the basis of the new design for the electronic newsletter. The editors recommend the publication of one print copy of the news- letter per year. The print newsletter will serve as a marketing piece for the association and may also help promote the annual meeting. (Febru- ary 2011) This new print newsletter, limited to eight to twelve pages, will be issued in color and include more substantive articles. The editors will solicit short articles on the following topics for this special print issue: history of medicine in the locality of the annual meeting, significant new digital resources in the history of medicine, teaching the history of medi- cine, and other public history topics related to the history of medicine. The editors propose working closely with the Publications Committee to ensure that quality content is secured for the print issue. Beginning in July 2011 the newsletter will be issued electronically in the new format with the exception of the special February print issue. The editors remain open to other suggestions or plans issued by the AAHM Publications Committee or Council. The move to an electronic publica- tion presents many opportunities to add images, color, and a modern design to the AAHM NewsLetter. We look forward to working with council, the Publications Committee, the secretary, and webmaster to make this happen. Travel Grants Committee (ad hoc). The 2009-10 Travel Grants Com- mittee (Julia Rodriguez, chair; Margaret Humphreys, and Anthony Kovac) is pleased to announce the results of this year's travel disbursements. We</page><page sequence="34">500 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE had seventeen applicants, including thirteen graduate students and four independent scholars. Three of the applicants are coming from overseas, thirteen from the United States, and one from Canada. All proposed to fly; none of the applicants submitted for ground travel costs alone, which are gener- ally cheaper (this is relevant only insofar as all domestic travelers have roughly the same projected travel expenses and could then be grouped in one category) . We divide the group into these two categories: domestic (including Canada) travel, and overseas travel. We thus recommend that the disbursement (total $5,000) for this year's group be as follows: * people from overseas receive $425 each ($3 x $425 = $1,275) * people from US/Canada receive $265 each ($14 x $265 = $3,710 ) Subtotal: $4,985 [* the remaining $15 will be added to the one Canadian applicant's award, bringing that award to $280; thus all funds will be spent.] If you have any questions, feel free to e-mailjuliar@unh.edu. Ad Hoc Committee for Student Affairs. The committee consists of Jacob Steere-Williams (chair through 2012 meeting) and Walt Schalick, Faculty Representative (term ends 2010). The previous chair needed to withdraw, leaving the committee to be reconstituted in preparation for the meeting in Rochester, Minnesota. Jacob Steere-Williams, a doctoral candidate at the University of Minnesota, stepped into the role and ably coordinated the activities for the Rochester meeting. With the support of the former chair of the committee, Kris ten Ehrenberger, the graduate student lunch and the arrangements for the room sharing and buddy- system were quickly and effectively established. Ad Hoc Committee on the Impact of HIPAA The committee convened several meetings via conference call to discuss the following issues: Inconsistent legal interpretations of the current HIPAA PHvacy Rule at covered entities. The major impediment to research confronting AAHM member- ship is that legal counsel for many covered entities do not recognize that the HIPAA Privacy Rule allows historical research of identifiable health information of living individuals as well as decedents. Although attor- neys for some covered entities may rule that historical research would be allowable, the administration has not implemented the HIPAA-compliant guidelines and procedures that HHS requires for adjudication of requests for waivers to conduct research.</page><page sequence="35">Report of the Eighty-Third Annual Meeting 501 The need to inform AAHM membership about HHS requirements for obtain- ing authorizations and waivers of authorization to conduct research of identifi- able health information and authońzations for publication of identifiable health information. Plans for developing a page for the AAHM Website did not progress after learning about impending changes to the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The HITECH Act (February 2009) included revisions to strengthen enforcement of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. HHS has not yet issued final regulations on these changes. Development of a luncheon workshop for the 2010 AAHM Meeting. The AAHM Program Committee accepted this committee's proposal for a workshop titled "Privacy Law in a Wired World: Implications for Teach- ing, Research, and Publication." Our plan is to post summaries of the workshop presentations on the Web for the benefit of AAHM members unable to participate in the workshop. The chair of this committee finds that one of most difficult issues in leading discussions of health privacy law with AAHM members is that AAHM does not have a code of ethics with guiding principles on protect- ing the privacy of health information. AAHM members who are clini- cians and clinical investigators as well as historians usually have strong backgrounds in the ethics of health privacy. Other members without clinical backgrounds are less well informed about the ethics health pri- vacy. Is there any chance that AAHM leadership would consider adopt- ing a position on the ethical use and dissemination of identifiable health information? Delegate to International Society for the History of Medicine. The International Society for the History of Medicine met for the Forty-Second International Congress in Cypress, September 2009. The Forty-Third Con- gress will be held in Cairo on October 10-13, 2010. The main theme of this meeting will be "The Knowledge and Practice of Medicine in the Nile Valley from the 3rd Millennium B.C. to the 3rd Millennium A.D." Other themes are medical instruments, hospitals, the development of prosthet- ics, medicine and the arts, the development of socialized medicine, and many others, covering the whole field of the history of medicine. For information concerning this congress, visit http:/ /www.bium.univparis5. fr/ishm/ eng/ acc_calend.htm. As always, presentations will be given from scholars of the history of medicine from many countries and an exciting program of social and sightseeing events will be offered.

The 2009 Annual Meeting of the American Council of Learned Societies took place at the Sheraton</page><page sequence="36">502 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE Society Hill Hotel in Philadelphia on May 7-9. In attendance were mem- bers of the ACLS Board of Directors, delegates of the constituent societies, members of the Conference of Administrative Officers, presidents of the constituent societies, representatives of affiliate organizations, represen- tatives of college and university associate institutions, ACLS Fellowship recipients, committee members, foundation representatives, and other invited participants. The first evening William E. Davis, executive director of the American Anthropological Association, moderated an informal session titled "Open Access and Journals Finance: Results of an Eight Society Study." The council met on May 8. At the council meeting, Nancy J. Vickers, treasurer of the ACLS board of directors, and Herb Mann, chair of the investment committee, reported on ACLS finances. Voting members (delegates of the member societies and members of the board of direc- tors) approved the ACLS budget for FY10 and elections to the board. New board members were Kwame Appiah (Princeton, chair); Jonathan Culler (Cornell), and Teofilo Ruiz. In her annual report Pauline Yu, president, discussed the challenges presented by the economic meltdown and the progress of ACLS in spite of these impediments. She called special attention to the difficulties faced by younger scholars seeking to establish their careers at this uncertain moment. In later months the ACLS launched a special postdoctoral fel- lowship program to help such scholars find temporary positions at col- laborating universities. After hearing presentations from recent fellows, the delegates heard a report from Nicole Stahlmann, director of fellowship programs. Following the delegates meeting, a report on the recent activities of the National Humanities Alliance was presented byjessica Jones Irons, executive direc- tor. Don M. Randel, president of The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, spoke at luncheon. The topic of this year's program session was peer review and other means by which the scholarly community judges its own progress. The panelists were Michael Brintnall, executive director, American Political Science Association; Charlotte Kuh, member, ACLS board of directors and deputy executive director, Policy and Global Affairs Division, and direc- tor, NRC Assessment of Research Doctorate Programs, National Research Council; Peter Struck, associate professor and undergraduate chair of classical studies, University of Pennsylvania; and Scott Waugh, executive vice chancellor and provost, University of California, Los Angeles. The session was moderated by Carol Greenhouse, Princeton University, and chair, Executive Committee of the Delegates and member, ex officio ACLS Board of Directors, and included questions from the floor.</page><page sequence="37">Report of the Eighty-Third Annual Meeting 503 In honor of Charles Homer Haskins (1870-1937) , the first chair of the ACLS, each year a distinguished scholar is invited to address the topic "A Life of Learning."

Bruce Fye in the Kahler Hotel, Heritage Hall I, at 5:00 p.m. on May 1, 2010. He declared a quorum present. The minutes of the 2009 annual meeting were approved as published in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine, 83, no. 3, (2009): 561-95. The secretary's report was delivered in brief by Christopher Crenner. For the full content, see the report to Council on p. 487. The combined treasurer's report and Finance Committee report was presented by Christopher Crenner for Margaret Marsh. The annual finan- cial report for FY 2009 was distributed and summarized. The endowment investments have rebounded. The treasurer and the Finance Committee had acted with the approval of council to institute a new, more conserva- tive investment posture for the endowment funds, which was described briefly. The treasurer reported that the association's financial condition continues to remain good. The association's accountant, Michael Collins of Collins, Asbell, Ward, and Greene of Greenville, North Carolina, com- pleted the AAHM's tax returns for both the association and the HMF and the annual financial statement for the association for fiscal year 2009.
