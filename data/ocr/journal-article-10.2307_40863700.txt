<plain_text><page sequence="1">Expanding the Ghurid Architectural Corpus East of the Indus: The Jãgesvara Temple at Sãdadi, Rajasthan1 ALKA PATEL University of California, Irvine Introduction investigators of South Asia's visual history, we have all experienced the stuff of our discipline call- ing to us in unexpected ways. We may find, for ex- ample, a brief but curiously compelling reference to a textile, a temple, or a tomb in a historical text or a bilin- gual inscription, which leads us on a dogged and some- times obsessive journey to engage with this object or structure - an engagement which can yield surprising results. It was just such a journey that brought me to a small structure in the remote town of Sãdadi (Figs, i, 2), in Pali District of southern Rajasthan, the region often referred to as Marwar (Fig. 3J.2 Sometime in 19 10 the eminent epigraphist D. R. Bhandarkar came upon the structure at Sãdadi, then as now worshipped as a temple dedicated to the Saiva deity Jãgesvara. Bhandarkar was spurred on by what Fig. i.

Ground plan (not to scale). would be an inverse motivation in art-historical terms: in his unrelenting search for Sanskrit and Prakrit in- scriptions relevant to the Cãhamãna dynasty and its various lineages (ca. 750-ca. 1390 ce3), he meticulously examined Rajasthan's temples, chhatris (stone or brick pavilions), and other buildings, not for their stylistic or iconographie characteristics, but rather for all the his- torical graffiti and inscriptional fragments he could find. At Sãdadi Bhandarkar discovered four inscriptions on three separate pillars. Due to erosion he could date only two of the epigraphs to Vikrama samvat (VS) 1147 (109 1 ce) and VS 1251 (1194 ce). The epigraphist tantalizingly observed that the inscriptions were "en- graved on (pillars) in the temple . . . but as all the mate- rials of this temple are said to have been brought from ruins elsewhere, it is clear that the inscription(s) did not originally belong to Sãdadi."4 Following this observa- tion, scholars have recently proposed that at least the two dated inscriptions (if not all four) were carved for a Laksmanaswãmi temple in the historically prominent town of Nãdol. One work has suggested that these in- scribed pillars, along with some other materials from the Laksmanaswãmi temple, were brought to Sãdadi in the late 1500s and used in the construction of the pres- ent "hall temple" of Jagesvara.5 Fig. 3.

Indeed, if the Sãdadi structure had been a temple during the sixteenth century, as it has been since 19 12, then it would constitute the first known temple rather than mosque to be constructed entirely of recycled ma- terials. If such evidence could be corroborated, then the practice of complete and large-scale architectural dis- mantling and reuse could no longer be associated exclu- sively with Islamic buildings; it would have to be taken into consideration in studies of temple architecture as well. The conclusion that the Sãdadi structure was a tem- ple erected of recycled materials in the sixteenth century certainly has its merits. Close examination of the extant physical, epigraphic, and textual evidence leads me to believe, however, that this so-called Jãgesvara Temple had a different trajectory through time and space, ex- tending well before the late 1500s, possibly as far back as the end of the twelfth century. I propose that this structure was originally a mosque constructed about Fig. 5. Plain bottom shaft of column. Sadadi. 400 years earlier, in the last decade of the twelfth cen- tury, under Ghurid patronage. Both architectural analy- sis and historical circumstance seem to support this alternative proposal. The town of Sãdadi falls within the heartland of the late twelfth-century campaigns of the Shansabanï sul- tans (ca. 1010-ca. 1210 ce6), commonly known as the Ghurids after their geographical base in mountainous Ghur, southeast of Herat, Afghanistan. Also, the struc- ture's construction by means of the eminently pragmatic and often politicized practice of reusing components from one or more previously standing buildings - a characteristic feature of the majority of Ghurid founda- tions east of the Indus - indicates that it belongs within the extant Ghurid architectural corpus. Moreover, there are other complexes that have changed in ritual function over the centuries, as various religious communities ap- propriated them for differing purposes.7 In the same vein one can argue that the Sãdadi building lived its life</page><page sequence="4">36 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Fig. 6. Decorated upper shaft of column. Sadadi. as a small mosque serving both religious and political functions, and that it was only after the waning of Ghurid presence in the area in the early thirteenth cen- tury, and sometime before Bhandarkar's fateful visit in 19 1 o, that the mosque was reconsecrated and ritually used in its present incarnation of a Jãgesvara temple. At least twenty-seven Cãhamãna-period Sanskrit epigraphs rewarded Bhandarkar's search in Marwar, an area still thickly dotted with towns of ancient and later origins such as Bhinmãl, Nãdol, Nãrlai, Sanchor, Sevãdi, and of course Sãdadi, along with the city of Jãlor (ancient Jãvãlipura) and many small villages (Fig. 3J.8 Bhandarkar's epigraphic discoveries, which he edited and partially translated, date between VS 1147 (109 1 ce) and VS 1444 (1387 ce). These records are in- valuable for the twenty-first-century scholar of twelfth- through fourteenth-century India: they provide impor- tant clues to the constantly shifting hierarchies among the Cãhamãna lineages of Marwar and their changing ties of fealty to the powerful Caulukyãs of Gujarat (ca. 950-1303/4 ce).9 In addition to enriching our views of northwestern India's ruling elites during this period, the Marwari inscriptions also offer new details and clarifi- cations regarding the territorial conquests and consoli- dation that the Ghurid military forces undertook in northern India in the second half of the twelfth century. South Asian art-historical discourse has only lately begun to move away from a narrative of the eleventh- thirteenth centuries gleaned almost exclusively from Persian and Arabic court chronicles, which frequently Fig. 7.

Sadadi. describe Islamic conquest as suddenly and uniformly enveloping new lands.10 The epigraphic evidence in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and some bilingual inscriptions, along with the architectural remains themselves, collectively elucidate the intricacies of this historical change, indicat- ing that Islamic political ascendancy was a sporadically successful process, and that it was far from unidirec- tional. The epigraphs document the Ghurids' gains as well as their losses throughout northern Gujarat, Rajas- than, Delhi and the vicinity, signalling that the cam- paigns often resulted in only tenuous occupations even of key locales. Moreover, these records shed light on royal, mercantile, and lay patronage of the architectural foundations that were an integral part of the socio- cultural landscape of South Asia both before and after long-term Islamic political presence in the northern In- dian plains. The historical value of Bhandarkar's epi- graphical discoveries, then - and the scores of inscrip- tions in Sanskrit and other Indie languages analyzed by other epigraphists - cannot be overestimated.</page><page sequence="6">38 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Fig. io.

The Sadadi Structure Today The extant structure at Sãdadi (Figs. 1, 2) consists of four bays and nine columns, forming a small covered area measuring approximately 22 feet along each side. The northwestern bay (bay 2 on the diagram [Fig. 2]), is now semienclosed by a wooden fence, serving as the sanctum and housing the Jãgesvara image under wor- ship. Although the large and most immediately visible components seem stylistically unified, their overall unity vanishes upon closer examination. For example, each of the columns in the structure (Fig. 4) actually consists of two distinct pillar fragments, stacked vertically on a separate base. All of these columns follow the pattern of unadorned, multi-faceted shafts on the bottom (Fig. 5), topped by exquisitely carved upper portions and brackets (Fig. 6). Even though virtually all of the top- most carvings represent the well-known ghatapallava, the carved upper portions seem to have come not only from different structures, but also from different time periods. Nevertheless, all the column shafts and capitals can be dated to the tenth through twelfth centuries. The ceilings of the four surviving bays vary some- what (Figs. 7-1 o), but are also assignable to the late tenth through twelfth centuries. It is noteworthy that, at least in the structure's present state, there is some indication that the building was originally larger by at least two bays. Whereas three out of the four bays (Figs. 8-10) - namely bays 2 (Fig. 8), 3 (Fig. 9), and 4 (Fig. 10) on plan (Fig. 2) - have flat, panelled ceilings with figurai friezes and a circular central medallion (sa- matãla vitãna), the ceiling over bay 1 (Fig. j) is of the concentric, receding type (ksipta vitãna).11 Upon first glance, the arrangement of the ceilings appears unbal- anced and even skewed, emphasizing by contrast the southern corner of the structure. The logic behind such an arrangement becomes much clearer if we consider the possibility that the orig- inal structure - whenever it was erected with these re- cycled components, whether in the twelfth century or</page><page sequence="8">40 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Fig. 13. Qutb Minar at the Qutbi Complex. Delhi. Founded 1199. the sixteenth - was larger by two more bays on either the western or the southern sides (Figs. 11 A, 11B), and that these proposed southern or western bays were also capped with the flat, panelled ceilings of bays 2-4 (Figs. 8-10). If we accept this hypothesis of two more flat- panelled bays as part of the original plan, then the single concentric, receding ceiling in bay 1 (Fig. y) still would have crowned the central bay of either the west or the south side of the structure. This unique ceiling over this bay would have served to distinguish it as the entrance or as some other focal point. Shansabanï Sultans and Cãhamãna Rãjãs The Shansabãnls were a clan probably of Tajik origin, settled 200 miles southeast of Herat, Afghanistan, in the mountainous province of Ghur - whence their nisba Ghuri, the dynastic name they hold in much modern scholarship. By 1146, the clan was associated with Firuzküh on the banks of the Hari Rud in western Ghur. A certain Qutb al-Dïn Muhammad Shansabanï fortified the site and made it the base of military opera- tions against other fortresses. It was during this period that the family rose to extra-local prominence, securing the fealty of the region's other tribal chieftains through treaty or coercion.12 The clan's ascendancy was mete- oric, as already by the 1150s they were in confronta- tion with both the Ghaznavids of central Afghanistan, as well as the Khwãrazm-shãhs of Khurasan. By the 1 1 70s, the Shansabanïs and their forces expanded their dominion throughout the northwest frontiers and the Panj ab, appropriating the territories of the Ghaznavids and pressing farther east.13 During the process of consolidation of their western territories, Ghurid forces had also tried their luck east of the Indus. Scholars agree that the Kirãdu Sanskrit stone inscription of VS 1235 (1178 ce) points to a Ghurid campaign into northern Caulukyã territories via western- most Rajasthan - a failed attempt at conquest, which nonetheless did result in the breaking of the image of Somesvara at the Kirãdu temple complex. This in- cursion fell during the reign of the Caulukyã ruler Mu- larãja II (VS 1233-1235 [1176-1178 ce]) according to his vamsavalis (family lineages), and was beaten back possibly with the aid of Kirtipãla, founder of the Cãhamãnas' Jãvãlipura (present-day Jalor) branch.14 The Ghurid forces' primary adversaries in their campaigns east of the Indus, the Rajput Cãhamãnas, had their senior and most powerful branch at Sãkamb- hari and nearby Ajmer (possibly founded ca. 1103- 112515). At their zenith during the mid-twelfth century, the Sãkambhari-Ajmer Cãhamãnas extended their pres- ence into the Panjab, confronting the ongoing Ghazna- vid raids from Lahore. Also by this time, they held Delhi and its vicinity through their feudatories the Tomaras.16 Subordinate offshoots of the Ajmer clan ruled at Dhol- pur, Ranthambore (both in southeastern Rajasthan), and Pratapgarh in south-central Rajasthan, all under the aegis of their patriarchs at Sãkambhari-Ajmer. Quasi-independent offshoots of the clan ruled in south- western Rajasthan, farther away from the Sãkambhari- Ajmer region. Among these were the Cãhamãnas of Jalor and Sanchor in the same area. Also present here were the Cãhamãnas of Nãdol, who counted the town of Sãdadi among their holdings (Fig. 3).17 Unfortunately, these southwestern Cãhamãna terri- tories also constituted the boundary area between two great imperial powers, namely their senior clansmen the Cãhamãnas of Sãkambhari-Ajmer to the east, and to the south the formidable Caulukyãs of Gujarat. To the west, these minor clans were somewhat protected by</page><page sequence="9">ALKA PATEL · Expanding the Ghurid Architectural Corpus East of the Indus 41 Fig. 14.

The late eleventh and early twelfth centuries were marked by several violent confronta- tions between Cãhamãna and Caulukyã forces until the Caulukyã ruler Jayasimha Siddharãja (r. 1094-1144 ce) finally emerged victorious. Thereafter, the Nãdol, Jalor, and Sanchor Cãhamãna branches were left to their own fate, and to the convenience of the Caulukyãs. Indeed, we noted above that Mu'ïzz al-Dïn Muhammad ibn Sam's 1178 campaign into western Rajasthan was repelled by the Caulukyã ruler Mularãja II (r. 1176- 1178). The Sãkambhari-Ajmer Cãhamãnas were notice- ably absent from this counter-attack, even though the Ghurids came painfully close to Cãhamãna lands.18 Despite ties of lineage, then, the senior clan members were willing to sacrifice their western cousins in order to safeguard their own territories. In the end the Ghurid commanders learned from their defeat and changed their approach in the 1191 and 1192 cam- paigns, adopting the strategy of their Ghaznavid prede- cessors and directly confronting the senior Cahamanas of Sãkambhari-Ajmer. Ghurid Architecture East of the Indus Upon successful occupation of pockets of territory in the northern Indian plains, the Ghurid deputies commis- sioned open prayer areas and mosques. It is well known that, by this time prosperous and important Muslim communities had long been settled in northern India and had already constructed many places of worship and commemoration.19 The locations, scales, and con- struction materials of Ghurid-patronzied buildings dis- tinguished them from their architectural predecessors. Not only were these later foundations larger than their forebears, they were located in areas where Islamic ritual buildings had probably not been constructed before - at least according to the surviving architectural and inscriptional evidence.20 These later structures</page><page sequence="10">42 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Fig. 15. Congregational Mosque, Bayana ("Ukha Mandir"). Interior, prayer area. varied most notably from the earlier foundations in hav- ing been erected using an abundance of reused material, a fact that has figured prominently in both the historical texts of the time and in later historiography. It can be argued that all of these changes together imbued the Ghurid-patronized buildings with a unique significance for the twelfth-century northern Indian landscape, serving as symbols of the establishment of an Islamic politico-religious order on a state level. The earliest surviving foundation of Ghurid patron- age east of the Indus is the old congregational mosque of Delhi (popularly known as the Quwwat al-Islam), founded in 119 2-1 193 by one of the military leaders of the Ghurid campaigns, Qutb al-Dïn Aibeg.21 The mosque measured approximately 214 by 180 feet, and its construction largely from reused materais set a prece- dent for later Ghurid-patronized buildings (Fig 12). Although the Qutb Minar (Fig. 13) is closely associated with the mosque, Aibeg did not begin the structure until 1 199, and finished only the first story to a height of about 95 feet.22 Another Ghurid military deputy, Bahã' al-Dïn Tughril, was campaigning simultaneously with Aibeg in contiguous areas of present-day Rajasthan. In recogni- tion of his successes the Ghurid sultans granted Tughril the governorship of the Bayana territory in southeastern Rajasthan, which he held between 1196 and 1210.23 Here Tughril founded the city of Sultankot, and in it a congregational mosque now known as the Ukha Man- dir (Fig 14). Overall, it was smaller in scale than Aibeg's mosque, measuring 11 1 by 51 feet. But here too, in its interior aisles are many reused columns (Fig. 15).24 The town of Kaman was within the administrative purview of Bayana-Sultankot, and an inscription asso- ciated with a mosque (Fig. 16) adjacent to the town cen- ter ascribes it to ah 600 (1 203-1 204 ce), or the time of Tughril's governorship.25 The block-like entrance of the Bayana-Sultankot mosque is present here as well, and the buildings have comparable dimensions, being ap- proximately no by 73 feet. As we may by now expect of Ghurid-patronized mosques, the Kaman building, in- cluding both columns and ceilings, was also constructed of older architectural components (Fig. 17 A). Here also, detailed examination of the mosque's reused components reveals significant patterns in their arrangement within the building. First, the columns of the líwãn (covered prayer area) are noticeably more ornate than their counterparts in the surrounding aisles, thereby emphasizing this ritually important part of the mosque. Moreover, the arrangement of the liwan's ceil- ings creates an axial emphasis on the central mihrãb (Fig. 17B): the lïwân' s ceiling soffits are generally plain, save for those of the central aisle perpendicular to the qibla wall, which are more ornately carved. These latter soffits are stylistically datable to the eighth through eleventh centuries,26 thus preceding the building's foun- dation date of 1 203 -1 204 ce. It appears, then, that the older and more intricately decorated elements not only emphasized the focal area of the building, but therein also guided the viewer's/worshipper's attention to the central mihrãb. The congregational mosque of Ajmer, dated by in- scription to 1198-1199, is another large foundation at- tributed to Qutb al-Dïn Aibeg. In scale this almost square complex was more imposing than Aibeg's Delhi mosque, measuring about 250 feet on each side and sur- passing Tughril's buildings as well. The interior (Fig. 18 A) is replete with older materials.27 It is noteworthy that the mosque's columns (Fig. 18B) consist of at least three different shafts stacked one atop the other, with the lower shafts tending to be less ornate than the</page><page sequence="11">ALKA PATEL · Expanding the Ghurid Architectural Corpus East of the Indus 43 Fig. 16. Mosque. Kaman, Bharatpur district, Rajasthan. Exterior, eastern entrance. Ca. 1204. upper. In general, the eye-level shafts are stylistically datable to the late twelfth or early thirteenth century, close to the foundation date of the complex (ah 595 [1198-1199 ce]), whereas the upper shafts are older, reused elements, as revealed both by style and by the figurai iconography which has been subjected to token erasure. Clearly, the Islamic proscription of figuration, particularly in places of worship, explains this method of combining new and old components: the iconically carved elements are higher and out of the line of vision, while the plain new shafts are on the ground surround- ing worshippers and visitors. Finally, a small mosque in the village of Khatu, about twenty-five miles east of Nagaur, bears an associ- ated inscription of ah 599 (1202-1203 ce), though stylistically it may date from the last decade of the twelfth century.28 The building, square in plan like Aibeg's Ajmer foundation, measures 75 feet on each side. But unlike the Ghurid-patronized mosques we have seen thus far, this one has an unusual, two-story entrance (Fig. 19), whose short flight of steps emerges into the courtyard. The mosque further differs from the other Ghurid foundations in its comparatively sparse use of recycled materials (Fig. 20 A). The column shafts are predominantly uniform, with stylized ghatapallava elements. These components are datable to the end of the twelfth century and outnumber the reused fragments of an earlier date. In addition to its relatively meager use of recycled materials, the Khatu mosque is notable for the absence of permanent mihrãbs in its side bays. Whereas the cen- tral bay of the Ifwãn is graced with an intricately carved marble mihrãb (Fig. 20B), the flanking bays have no carved niche at all. Instead, in each of these bays the qibla is punctuated with two ornate columns, effectively marking a central void where a mihrãb ought to be. In- deed, this mosque is not alone in its single, permanent mihrãb and plain flanking bays; the Ajmer, Bayana, and Kaman lïwâns also have carved mihrãbs exclusively in their central bays, with plain spaces framed by two col- umns in their flanking bays. As suggested for earlier mid-twelfth-century mosques in Gujarat,29 it is possible</page><page sequence="12">44 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Fig. 17A. Mosque, Kaman. Interior. Fig. 17B. Mosque, Kaman. Ceilings. that mihrabs of perishable materials, such as wood or brick, were installed in the flanking bays of the lïwâns of these larger Ghurid-patronized mosques. The Ghurids' confrontations with the various Cãha- mãna lineages, and the social and geographical hierar- chy of the clan, along with the politico-military rivalry between Qutb al-Dln Aibeg and Bahã' al-Dïn Tughril, together explain the nature and intensity of their archi- tectural patronage. Within less than a decade of cam- paigning in the region, these two military commanders between them commissioned at least six major founda- tions, all of which exceeded in scale the Islamic ritual and commemorative buildings constructed by Muslim communities already settled east of the Indus for several centuries. As discussed above, after at least two campaigns</page><page sequence="13">ALKA PATEL · Expanding the Ghurid Architectural Corpus East of the Indus 45 Fig. ι 8 A. Congregational Mosque, Ajmer. Interior. Founded 1198-1199. into northern India, in the 1170s and early 1190s, Ghurid forces led by Qutb al-Dïn Aibeg finally emerged victorious against the Sãkambhari-Ajmer Cãhamãnas in 1 192. Aibeg permitted the defeated Cãhamãna ruler to retain his throne in his capital of Ajmer, but as a tribu- tary of the Ghurid sultans.30 Aibeg and his troops in- stead occupied Indraprastha, a locality abutting Delhi. This city and its hinterlands were not the Cãhamãna capital, but a tributary holding under the Tomaras.31 Aibeg's foundation there of the impressive Qutbi Mosque (1192-1193) (Fig. 12) nonetheless was an im- portant statement: it commemorated the Ghurids' first long-term foothold in Hindustan, and at the same time it aggrandized Aibeg's own role in the long-awaited vic- tory. Moreover, reused materials expedited its construc- tion, and simultaneously provided Aibeg the basis for a specifically Islamic cultural legitimacy as a devout Mus- lim warrior, a scourge of infidels and military champion of Islam (ghâzï).32 The qibla area was actually left open, not screened with the well-known façade (Figs. 12, 21) until some years later.33 The rival commander Bahã' al-Dïn Tughril, granted the governorship of Bahana-Sultankot, lost no time in erecting there, about 1196, an imposing congregational mosque (Figs. 14, 15J, known as the Ukha Mandir. It's construction was also facilitated by recycling compo- nents from older buildings. And as with Aibeg, it also afforded Tughril the basis for a reputation in his own right as orthodox warrior of Islam. Prior to Ghurid presence, Bayana and nearby Ka- man had likely been within the territorial domains of the Sãkambhari-Ajmer Cãhamãnas (Fig. 3). Tughril's ambition and rivalry with Aibeg raised Bayana from a secondary city with limited administrative functions during Cãhamãna times, to the center of his political ambitions as Sultankot.34 The chronicler Minhãj al-Dïn Sïraj Juzjanï (1193-ca. 1265) notes that Tughril radi- cally improved commercial links with his territory and brought it great prosperity.35 Besides his economic improvements, his monumental buildings at Bayana- Sultankot and Kaman may also have augmented the prominence of his governorship and his territory. Aibeg's further additions to the Qutbï mosque at about the same time as Tughril's activities can be placed within this context of political rivalry. For exam- ple, the famous façade in front of the qibla area (Figs. i29 21), ornately carved with the intertwining foliage iconography of the Water Cosmology, is dated by in- scription to 1198.36 Furthermore, an inscription of 1 199 indicates that construction began on the renowned Qutb Minar (Fig. 13). It can be argued that, considering the nature of these later additions and their dates, Aibeg's improvement program at Delhi was likely a competitive dialogue with Tughril's undertakings in Sultankot and Kaman (Figs. 15, 16). Tellingly, Aibeg's qibla façade at Delhi, though differently situated in the overall complex, bears similarity in its broad conception to Tughril's façades. Furthermore, the Qutb Minar's (Fig. 13) acknowledged typological and formal relation- ship with the Ghazna (1098-1115 and 1117-1149) and Fïruzkuh (1 174- 1 175) minarets37 may indicate that Aibeg took the bold step of placing himself in the league of his overlords the Ghurid sultans. In the end, both military commanders declared them- selves independent rulers only after the death of the Sultan Mu'ïzz al-Dïn Muhammad ibn Sãm in 1206.38 It would seem, however, that Aibeg emerged victorious once again in his short but intense rivalry with Tughril. Aibeg's direct occupation of the Cãhamãna capital of Ajmer in about 119639 assured his strategic and sym- bolic supremacy. Moreover, his Ajmer mosque (Fig.</page><page sequence="14">46 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Fig. 18B. Congregational Mosque, Ajmer.

Ca. 1203. 18) exceeded Tughril's foundations and even his own previously founded mosque at Delhi (Fig. 12) in sheer size and monumentality. Rivalry among the Cãhamãna lineages had been fundamental to the creation of a geographical hierarchy in the region, with some areas and their ruling families commanding more power and resources than others. The Sãkambhari-Ajmer lineage remained the most senior throughout the twelfth century, their standing reinforced by direct engagement with the Ghurid forces in 1 191 and 1192. In turn, the military and architec- tural activities of the two principal Ghurid commanders, Qutb al-Dïn Aibeg and Bahã' al-Dïn Tughril, altered this geography: although Delhi, Ajmer, Bayana-Sultankot, and some associated holdings had been occupied in the names of the Ghurid sultans at Firüzküh and Ghazna, eventually the region came to reflect the military commanders' competition for individual supremacy east of the Indus. The structure at Sãdadi was an inte- gral part of this changing landscape. Sadadi in Context As discussed above, current scholarly opinion holds that the Sãdadi structure dates from the latter half of the sixteenth century, having been constructed as a "hall temple." According to this opinion, the building was a reconstitution of materials from the Laksmanaswãmi Temple at nearby Nãdol, the regional seat of power of the western Cãhamãnas. But a brief comparison of the Sãdadi structure with a temple of the late fifteenth cen- tury furnishes little to support this interpretation. The Mahavïra Temple at Ghanerao, about fifteen miles west of Sãdadi, provides a useful comparative ex- ample (Fig. 22). Based on stylistic and epigraphic analy- sis, the temple is datable to the mid-tenth century. Its prominent northern rangamandapa (open hall), however, dates from the late fifteenth century, when the overall complex underwent major additions.40 This rangaman- dapa is germane to our purposes in chronology as well as typology: it is a late fifteenth-century open hall com-</page><page sequence="16">48 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Fig. 20A. Mosque, Khatu. Interior. ponent of a temple complex, very similar to the pur- ported "hall temple" of Sãdadi. Aside from this typological overlap, a closer com- parison of the two architectural elements reveals telling variations between the two. The Sãdadi structure (Figs. i, 2, 23) is composed of several bays, each upheld by four columns (two shared with the adjacent bay) and all of approximately equal size. The Ghanerao rangamandapa (Fig. 22J, however, consists of a single large concentric ceiling about twelve feet in diameter and upheld on eight columns. If the Sãdadi building had been designed out of reused materials as a "hall temple" in the sixteenth cen- tury, its builders would likely have chosen a single large ceiling and various column shafts as their materials of construction. A foundation such as NãdoPs Laksma- naswãmi Temple, prominent due to its connection with the principal western lineage of the Cãhamãnas, would have furnished the necessary elements. Indeed, other Fig. 20B. Mosque, Khatu. Qibla wall with mihrabs. buildings constructed with recycled materials (Fig. 18) demonstrate that such large ceilings were available and even plentiful in temples dating from the tenth through twelfth centuries.41 Furthermore, during the fifteenth through sixteenth centuries the interiors and covered spaces of ritual buildings tended to be lofty and unified wholes, as seen in other north Indian temple complexes such as those at Ranakpur (Fig. 24), and also Orchha and Vrindavan.42 By contrast, Sadadi's relatively low, multi-bay covered space (Fig. 1) hearkens to a different formal and functional ethos. A familiarity with the acceptably dated Ghurid- patronized mosques east of the Indus (described above) makes it more plausible that the structure at Sãdadi should count among them rather than among fifteenth- and sixteenth-century temples. Although the Sãdadi building is considerably smaller in scale than the other surviving Ghurid foundations, several of its characteris- tics liken it to this corpus. It was noted above that the Sãdadi structure près-</page><page sequence="17">ALK A PATEL · Expanding the Ghurid Architectural Corpus East of the Indus 49 Fig. 21. Mosque of Qutb al-Din Aibeg ("Quwwat al-Islam"). Detail of qibla screen. Ca. 1198. ently consists of nine columns upholding four bays, and that it possibly counted two more bays on the south or the west when originally erected. The latter possibility was suggested by the curious choice in and placement of the ceilings of each of the bays: three out of the four ceilings, namely those capping bays 2-4 (Figs. 2, 8-10) were of the flat, panelled variety (samatãla vitãna)^ while bay 1 (Figs. 2, j) in the southwestern corner was capped with a receding, concentric ceiling (utksipta vitãna). This arrangement created a hierarchy among the bays, with bay 1 likely serving as some type of focal point within the building. This focal point is especially apparent when seen as part of an original six-bay struc- ture, with two more bays either on the south or the west as part of the original plan (Figs. 11A-B). The columns upholding the Sãdadi building's bays also followed a discernible pattern, being plain on the bottom and intricately carved on the top (Figs. 5, 6). Fig. 22. Mahavira Temple. Ghanerao, Rajasthan. Founded 10th c. Rangamandapa, 15th c. This consistent division was easily achieved by using at least two different shafts for the overall column. Whereas columns in most temples tended to be replete with heavy carving and figurai imagery from the base through the capital (Fig. 24), those of Ghurid-patron- ized mosques such as Ajmer (Fig. 18B) tended to plain lower shafts and ornate upper shafts, capitals, and brackets. The general Islamic eschewal of iconism, par- ticularly in ritual spaces, explains this arrangement of new and reused shafts in the fashioning of Ghurid mosque columns. The strict adherence to the same pat- tern at Sãdadi supports the suggestion that this building was created to form a mosque rather than a temple. Moreover, the symbolic deconsecration of remaining anthropomorphic elements in the recycled components, most notably the ceilings (Figs. 8-10), further bolsters this proposal. The arrangement of the panelled and concentric</page><page sequence="18">50 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Fig. 23. Sãdadi. Interior. ceilings within the Sãdadi structure, and the consequent creation of a hierarchy and emphasis among the bays (Figs. 2, y-10), is also in keeping with the mosque foun- dations patronized by the Ghurid military commanders Aibeg and Tughril. In order to render this emphasis at Sãdadi symmetrical, two more bays, with ceilings simi- lar to bays 2-4, would have been necessary. The sole concentric ceiling over bay 1, making it the focal point of the buildings (Figs. 2, y), leads me to suggest that the hypothetical additional two bays of the original con- struction were on the south rather than the west side of the present four bays. These two southern bays would have been capped with the flat, panelled ceilings (samatãla vitãna) of bays 2-4, making the concentric, receding ceiling of bay 1 the prominent ceiling and bay, as would be appropriate for the focal point. With bay 1 and the whole western portion of the structure thus ori- ented west-southwest, the Sãdadi building would follow the general orientation of South Asian mosques toward Mecca. Comparison of the hypothetically reconstructed Sãdadi structure with Bahã al-Dïn Tughril's early thirteenth-century mosque at Kaman lends evidence in favor of two more bays to the south. We recall that the Kaman mosque was also constructed of reused mate- rials, apparent upon a glance at the double-aisled lïwân (Fig. 1 y A). What is particularly useful for our examina- tion is the purposeful deployment throughout the build- ing of these older materials as axial markers and other architectural devices. The ceilings of the prayer area, for example, are predominantly plain and fitted in the quadrangles among the forest of columns. This plain- ness contrasts with the central aisle perpendicular to the qibla (Fig. iyB), where the more ornate and gen- erally older ceilings were fitted. This ornamentation culminates above the main mihrãb, which is canopied by a deeply carved concentric ceiling receding into the roof. This ceiling is likely of an end tenth-century date, and thus older than the building by about 200 years. At both Kaman and Sãdadi, then, the more ornately</page><page sequence="19">ALK A PATEL · Expanding the Ghurid Architectural Corpus East of the Indus 51 Fig. 24. Adinatha Temple, Ranakpur, Rajasthan. Interior. Mid-i5th c. carved, recycled components were used to mark the rit- ually important area of the mosque, the central mihrãb, distinguishing it from the remainder of the structure. So was there once an actual mihrãb at Sãdadi? The columns delineating the various bays and upholding their ceilings do not support walls in between. Even if the building was oriented correctly, and the space for a central mihrãb was implicitly indicated by the receding, concentric ceiling above bay 1, there is no physical rem- nant of a niche or niches. Of course, neither a con- structed mosque nor a mihrãb is liturgically necessary for individual or congregational Islamic worship.43 It would nonetheless strengthen the argument that the Sãdadi building was a late twelfth-century mosque, rather than a sixteenth-century temple, if there were some indication of a mihrãb. Clues to how Sadadi's mihrãb(s) may have been fashioned are provided by the other Ghurid-patronized mosques of the region. We saw at the late twelfth- century Khatu mosque (Fig. 20) that only the central mihrãb was permanently carved into the qibla wall. This was the case also at the other Ghurid-built mosques of Bayana and Kaman, and even at the monumental mosque of Ajmer. In all of these mosques each of the flanking bays was simply marked with two columns, suggesting that a mihrãb of material such as wood or brick could have been suspended between them. A simi- lar device could have been employed at Sãdadi. The col- umns demarcating the bays could have served as sup- ports for suspension of a wood, brick, or textile mihrãb between them - possibly more than one. If that were the case, the Sãdadi structure would be consistent with the late twelfth-century mosques sponsored by the Ghurid military commanders east of the Indus. Finally, if we accept the idea that the Sãdadi struc- ture, upon its erection with recycled materials, was intended to be a mosque rather than a temple, a more exact date for its construction still remains to be deter- mined. The inscriptions mentioned above, found by Bhandarkar at the beginning of the twentieth century, are helpful in this endeavor. The epigraphical evidence, when combined with other historical references, leads to an approximate but plausible date of foundation for the Sãdadi structure during the last decade of the twelfth century. Its location near the town of Nãdol may lend credibility to that date. Bhandarkar discovered four inscriptions on three pillars of the Sãdadi structure. Two of these epigraphs were eroded and described only in passing; the other two offered fuller information, including dates of VS 1 147 (109 1 ce) and VS 125 1 (1194 ce). According to the epigraphist, and echoed by later scholars, these pillars were apparently brought for the construction of this structure from Nãdol, about twenty miles north. Although now a village, it is well known that in the eleventh through thirteenth centuries Nãdol had been the seat of one of most enduring Cãhamãna lineages. These Cãhamãna clansmen had been engaged in ongo- ing conflicts with the Caulukyãs of Gujarat on their southern borders, and at least twice confronted Ghurid forces. I propose that the Sãdadi structure was erected sometime after 1194, the date of the latest decipherable inscription within the building, and probably in 1196- 1197, during Aibeg's incursion into western Marwar on his way to Gujarat, discussed below. As already described, during the decade following the unsuccessful campaign of 1178, the Ghurid sultans consolidated their bases in the Indus Valley and directly confronted the Sãkambhari- Ajmer Cãhamãnas in 1191. But the territories of the skirmishing Cãhamãnas did not</page><page sequence="20">52 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART prove easily penetrable, and the Ghurid-deputed forces again faced defeat at the first battle at Tara'in. In 1192, the perseverance of the Afghani military commanders was at last rewarded by success at the second battle at Tara'in. This victory opened the way to Delhi, which fell within the purview of feudatories of the Sãkambhari-Ajmer Cãhamãnas, the Tomaras (discussed above). Though the Sãdadi inscription of VS 1147 (1091 ce) names a certain Jojaladeva as maharaja of the Nãdol branch of the Cãhamãnas, the latter inscription of VS 1 25 1 (1194 ce) is more germane to our purposes. By mentioning a certain Jayantisimha as mahãrãjadhirãja of Nãdol, the 1194 epigraph provides information re- garding the Nãdol Cãhamãnas a century later:44 the Nãdol branch survived internecine skirmishes as well as the ebb and flow of their fortunes against the Caulukyãs of Gujarat, continuing in power through at least the end of the twelfth century. Most importantly, the inscrip- tion's reference to Jayantasimha as mahãrãjadhirãja in 1 194 indicates that the Nãdol Cãhamãnas were inde- pendent rulers at this time, and also that they had held off the Ghurid campaigns of 11 78, 1191, and 1192, even when their senior patriarchs at Sãkambhari-Ajmer had been reduced to the status of tributaries to the Ghurid deputies and their overlords the Shansabanï sultans at Fïruzkuh and Ghazna. Qutb al-Dïn Aibeg's ambition was, however, un- flagging. After his conquest of Ajmer the military com- mander placed the city under the tributary adminis- tration of Govindarãja, the son of his erstwhile foe Prithvirãja III (r. 1179-1192 ce). Aibeg himself, along with a garrison, eventually took up quarters in the vicin- ity of Delhi, founding the Qutbï complex and exercising vigilance over his recent hard-won territory from a close distance. According to Juzjanï, Aibeg again undertook a military campaign in ah 593 (1197 ce): he marched against Anahillavãda-pattana, the capital of the Cau- lukyãs of Gujarat "and took vengeance upon that tribe ... for the Sultãn-i Ghãzl," referring to Mu'ïzz al-Dïn ibn Sam's defeat by the Caulukyã and western Cãhamãna forces in 1178.45 With southwestern Rajasthan lying directly in his path, it seems that Aibeg took advantage of the occa- sion to wrest the area from the recalcitrant Cãhamãnas of Nãdol as well. According to Nïzamï, this was an easy victory, as the inhabitants of the town - including the ruler and his military forces - had fled the town already upon hearing of the Ghurid forces' approach.46 It is plausible that during this brief occupation of the Nãdol Cãhamãnas' capital, Aibeg commissioned the mosque at Sãdadi. By the mid- 1190s the Ghurid commanders Aibeg and Tughril had established a pattern of building places of Islamic worship out of reused materials near recently occupied strongholds. The Qutbï complex at Delhi (1192-1193) was already constructed and under wor- ship, as was Tughril's mosque of Bayana-Sultankot (ca. 1 196). Moreover, we can understand the foundation of a mosque at Sãdadi, rather than at Nãdol itself, in light of Aibeg's decision to build his mosque at Delhi after his victory in 1192 against the senior Sãkambhari-Ajmer Cãhamãnas. That city, where Aibeg had architecturally proclaimed the establishment of a new Islamic politico- religious order, along with his own prominence, was not the capital of his defeated adversaries but a tributary holding. Furthermore, the capital city Ajmer (along with Delhi) had been left under the governorship of the rãjas' descendants, thereby continuing a political and economic infrastructure that was already in place. It is probable, then, that the same pattern was implemented at Nãdol and Sãdadi for effective administration of Marwar. The Ghurids' hold over western Rajasthan did not endure beyond a few years. We saw that even after sev- eral Ghurid campaigns in the region, the Nãdol branch returned to their domains in the early thirteenth cen- tury, albeit in varying capacities. When in the 1220s they lost control to another imperial power, it was to the Caulukyas of Gujarat rather than to the Ghurid ghulãms or the Delhi mãliks.47 Any brief presence the Ghurids secured in southwestern Rajasthan in the late 1 1 90s, or any designs they formed of long-term control of the area, were perforce based at a satellite town like Sãdadi rather than the actual seat of the Cãhamãnas at Nãdol. The Jãgesvara temple of Sãdadi in its previous in- carnation, then, was likely a Ghurid-sponsored mosque much like the other, more prominent Ghurid founda- tions of eastern Rajasthan and Delhi. Like these build- ings, the Sãdadi mosque also served as a marker of the Ghurid attempt to secure a power base in the area. These attempts were fruitful and enduring in central and eastern Rajasthan at Kaman, Bayana, Khatu, and Ajmer, as well as Delhi - all strongholds from which their control could and did radiate in multiple direc- tions. But in southwestern Rajasthan the same success eluded them. In a convenient architectural analogy, the small size of the Sãdadi mosque in comparison with its larger Ghurid cousins, and its radically altered form and function during the following centuries, all seem to echo the extremely fraught and tenuous presence Ghurid forces were able to secure in this strategically important region.</page><page sequence="21">ALKA PATEL · Expanding the Ghurid Architectural Corpus East of the Indus 53 Notes 1.

Anne Hardgrove has described the geographical, re- ligious and caste-based ambiguities in the terms "Marwar" and "Marwari," concluding that the terms' définitions shift according to usage; see Anne Hardgrove, Community and Public Culture: The Marwaris in Calcutta, ca. i8c&gt;y- 1997 (New York: Columbia University Press, 2002), esp. Introduction. Hardgrove's work ultimately applies the ethnic term to the various Jaina and Hindu trading castes ("Marwaris") who linked their homelands of Shekhawati and central Rajasthan ("Marwar") to their diaspora of Kolkata. Here, I adhere to a geographical usage denoting central and south-central Rajasthan, in the vein of the epigraphist D. R. Bhandarkar (see n. 3). 3. These dates are inclusive of the varying life spans of the Cãhamãna lineages in Rajasthan and northern Gujarat: The localized clans' fortunes were often cyclical, temporarily declining in the face of Shansabanï/Ghurid or Caulukya politico-military successes and then rebounding as the aggressors diverted their efforts to other fronts.

A combination of factors effectively extinguished Shansabanï dynastic claims during the second decade of the thirteenth century, both in India and Afghanistan: Qutb al-Din Aibeg {infra in main text), the military deputy of the Shansabanï sultans Ghiyãth al-Dln Muhammad ibn Sãm (d. 1202) and Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad ibn Sãm (d. 1206) held their northern Indian holdings in allegiance with his overlords. His successor Iletmish (r. 1 210-123 6), however, increasingly took territories in his own authority. Moreover, the absence of Shansabanï heirs, coupled with the victories of the Khwãrazm-shãhs and the Mongols in Afghanistan, brought the Shansabanï dynasty to an end by about 1210; see C. E.

The only near-con- temporaneous account of those years is found in Tãj al- Dln Hasan Nïzamï's (d. ah 617 [121 7 ce]) Tãj al-Ma'athtr, trans. Bhagwat Saroop (Delhi: Saud Ahmad Dehlavi, 1998), pp. 65-71. See also Jackson, Delhi Sultanate, pp. 10, 19. 31. The Rajput Tomaras had been settled around the Delhi area since the early 9th c. ce, and had been in con- flict with the expanding power of the Sãkambhari-Ajmer Cãhamãnas throughout the late nth and 12th c. These conflicts culminated ca. n 64, when Cãhamãna forces pre- vailed and occupied Delhi. Similar to the practice continued by the Ghurids, the Cãhamãnas left the reigning Tomara prince in charge of the city, but with tributary status; see Kielhorn, "Delhi Siwalik Pillar Inscription"; Nïzamï, Tãj al-Ma'athtr, pp. 69-71; Ray, Dynastic History, vol. II, pp. 1145-46; Jackson, Delhi Sultanate, p. 10 32. See Jackson, Delhi Sultanate, esp. pp. 19-20, 21- 22, for a discussion of this religio-literary "status." See also Kumar, Emergence, p. 98, for the possible presence of "infidels" in the military forces leading these campaigns. 33. An inscription dated ah 592 (1197 ce) on the western central arch of the arched screen indicates it was likely erected in 1197-1198, about five years after the mosque's ah 587 (1192 ce) foundation; see Horovitz, "In- scriptions," pp. 13, 15. 34. Based on the similarity between early i2th-c. gold coinage series and Ghurid-issued Laxmi-type gold coins, it has been suggested that Bayana was a mint site prior to Ghurid conquest. The Ghurid forces likely took over the mint and issued gold coinage from there, which was circu- lated throughout Afghanistan as far west as Herat and Mazar-i Sharif; see John Deyell, Eiving without Silver: The Monetary History of Early Medieval North India (Delhi and New York: Oxford University Press, 1990), pp. 99-100; Kumar, Emergence, pp. 101-2. Although the town had been a mint location prior to Ghurid occupation, possibly its commercial activity and direct geographical connections strengthened after Tughril's takeover and ef- fective administration. 35.

The Ghazna minarets are ascribed to the reigns of the sultans Mas'üd III (r. 1099-1115) and Bahrãm Shäh (r. 1117-ca. 1 1 57).

See Jackson, Delhi Sultanate, p. 10; Kumar [Emer- gence, p. 51) gives a date of 1195 for Aibeg's direct occu- pation of Ajmer. Although the congregational mosque's dedicatory inscription of ah 595 (1198 ce) may indicate an even later date of occupation, as the foundation of a mosque was necessary immediately upon occupation of a territory, particularly in the gradually transforming Dãr al-Harb of Hindustan (Horovitz, "Inscriptions," p. 15). 40.

This campaign resulted in only temporary occupa- tion of Anahillavãda-pattana; Aibeg apparently lacked de- signs of permanent annexation of the area, perhaps seeing the incursion more as redemption of his master's honor, as</page><page sequence="24">56 ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART Juzjani suggested.
