<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robert S. C. Gordon "How Much Home Does a Person Need?" Primo Levi and the Ethics of Home 1. Ordinary Virtues Primo Levi's work, in testimony and beyond, draws a map of an ethical universe, a universe of ethical enquiry which asks questions not only of the radical evil of the Holocaust but also of the ordinary, practical moralities of everyday living: ordinary virtues and ordinary vices, we might say.1 Furthermore, his writing style and his narrative technique enact in their very texture that ethical questioning of uncommon and common experience, and the interaction between the two, so that we can say that his work operates literarily speaking in both ethical and meta ethical fields hand-in-hand.2 Indeed, this quality of framing and looking at the Holocaust through the lens of ordinary values (and vice versa), watching those values stumble and almost disintegrate without ever quite abandoning them, is perhaps the single most significant and characteristic contribution that Levi has made in his memoirs and narrative to both literature and testimonial writing. What is more, the specific nature of the values in question, their capacity to be both eccentrically Levi's and also to contain echoes of larger traditions and cultures, makes it possible for his work to resonate historically as a locus of confrontation ' For the notions of ordinary vices and ordinary virtues, see Shklar, who takes the former phrase from Montaigne ("fautes ordinaires"), a writer with whom Levi has many affinities; Todorov 40-46, See also Gordon, Virtues, the project out of which the present essay has grown. All references to Levi's works are to the volume and page number of his Opere. 3 This capacity to forge a writing and a narrative style that enacts in its very texture the careful ethical enquiry undertaken by Levi is what brings him closest to recent work on literature and ethics by figures such as Martha Nussbaum and Wayne C. Booth (see also Newton; Rorty). As the former states pellucidly, "My claim is that only the style of a certain sort of narrative artist (and not for example the style associated with the abstract theoretical treatise) can adequately state important truths about the world, embodying them in its shape and setting up in the reader the activities that are appropriate for grasping them" (Nussbaum 6). And although the field of literature and ethics has not on the whole been interested in the historical-ethical questions thrown up by the Holocaust (although, via Levinas. it is indirectly linked to Holocaust-related work such as Bauman's), its insights are if anything enhanced by an encounter with Levi, where a careful, humane, and intelligent "narrative ethics" (Newton) is pitted against its possible annihilation.

Gordon between two faces of Europe's past: its rationalist, bourgeois, post-Enlightenment, progressive face and its dark, violent, totalitarian face (two faces which many have argued, ffom Adorno and Horkheimer onwards, are in reality one and the same). It also allows us to understand the peculiarly antiquated aura that often emanates ffom Levi's writing, evident in his fréquent réservations concerning what we might loosely call "modernist" projects in literature (e.g. Celan, Kafka), psychoanalysis (e.g. Freud, Bettelheim), and philosophy (e.g. Améry).3 Levi seems to bring another, pre-modernist set of values to bear on the event of modernity, and the effect of this disjunction is to open up a fascinating diachronic dimension to his work. Thus to tap into Levi's ethics, to the virtues he uses to read his experience and the world around him, is no small exercise. It is both autobiographical or literary criticai and cultural historical in the largest sense. A detailed mapping of Levi's ordinary virtues lies beyond the scope of the présent essay. What follows instead is a preliminary case study of one of the founding motifs of the ordinary in his work and in his self-conception, since the primacy of the ordinary is in itself fundamental for our positioning and understanding of his ethics. To establish this primacy in his writing as a working hypothesis, we can take two moments of explicit self-positioning made almost forty years apart. In 1986, in the preface to his collection of miscellany, Racconti e saggi, rejecting the aura of authority, even sanctity that naturally accrues to the survivor, he déclarés: "[...] sono un uomo normale di buona memoria che è incappato in un vortice" (II, 859; "I am a ordinary man with a good memory who ran into a whirlwind"); and in this, he echoes one of his very earliest statements of intent about his Holocaust writing, a first draff of the preface to Se questo è un uomo (1947) where he explains: "[...] ho cercato di mantenere l'attenzione sui molti, sulla norma, sull'uomo qualsiasi" (1, 1384; "1 tried to keep focusing on the many, on the norm, on the ordinary man"). This emphasis links Levi to a key feature of early modem European conceptions of moral value, a link best illustrated through Charles Taylor's magisterial account of the genesis of selfhood and its relation to moral good, Sources of the Self. Taylor offers three overarching, conflicting, historical "frontiers" within modem identity: very roughly they can be labelled classica! or theistic (Augustine to Montaigne), early modem (Reformation and Enlightenment) and modem (Romanticism and after). It is the middle of the three that interests here. For Taylor the fundamental Strands of our présent identity and moral orientation which evolved in that middle, early-modern period include 3 For instances of Levi's réservations about these figures, see II, 679-81 (Celan); II, 939 41, 1208-10 (Kafka); II, 1007 (Freud); Levi, Voice 233-4 (Bettelheim); II, 1091-1108 (Améry). Levi's anti-modernism is of a particular kind, however: it does not prevent his integration of science and writing, nor on occasion a liberal scepticism (Cheyette), nor his clinical analysis of the disintegration ofthe self, all ofwhich are in their way quintessentially modernist.</page><page sequence="3">Primo Levi and the Ethics of Home 217 "freedom, benevolence [...] the demand for universal justice and beneficence [...] equality [...] the avoidance of death and suffering" (495). Ail ofthese reach a sort of apotheosis in the Enlightenment, and are recognisable in the distinctly neo-enlightened secular culture of Levi's formation.4 But the most distinctive shift of the Protestant Reformation for Taylor, and the most suggestive feature of his account for our reading of Levi's ethics, is the move away from the "heroism" of classical notions of the "good life" as the ideal end of moral enquiry towards what he calls the "affirmation of ordinary life" (Taylor 13-16, 209-302). In this account, ordinary life — the life of marriage, family, and home, of work and production — rather than being the banal backdrop against which the self struggled to a higher ideal, became for the first time the proper centre of moral life, of notions of dignity and integrity. Ordinary life displaced the heroic or saintly ideal of the good life as the sphere of moral action. And with this shift a new taxonomy of perfections, and a new vocabulary for talking about them, was needed. This is precisely the sense in which Levi parades his ordinariness in his writing about the Holocaust and elsewhere: he makes ordinariness the anchor for his moral sense in the "whirlwind" of extreme experience. It is precisely the sense in which he understood the significance of the violence and victimhood of the Final Solution as destroying the code of value and valour derived from established conceptions of war, struggle, soldierliness, as Todorov argued (11-36). This ordinariness stands both on the side of vice and of virtue with respect to the Holocaust, so that Levi's investment in the ordinary is in some sense in dialogue with Arendt's interprétation of the Final Solution as an apotheosis of the banal: as Giorgio Agamben has put it recently, "una delle lezioni di Auschwitz è, appunto, che capire la mente di un uomo comune è infinitamente più arduo che comprendere la mente di Spinoza o di Dante" (9). One of the key loci of the morality of the ordinary in Taylor's history of the moral good, literally the space in which the ordinary begins historically to make sense as a centre of moral life, and also necessarily the first space to be denied to Jews hounded into ghettos, hiding in basements, deported to concentration camps, is also the motif in Levi's work that we will now set out to follow: the space in question in that of "the home." The home is constantly re-evoked in imagery, in geography and in memory throughout Levi's oeuvre, often in explicit and anxious contrast with the more familiar motif of déportation and Jewish suffering, that of diasporic exile.5 Although little noted in criticai work on him, it is crucial to an understanding of the 4 On Levi's formation in Turin's early-twentieth-century post-Enlightenment, positivist, socialist-leaning culture, see "Il mondo invisibile" (on his father, L'altrui mestiere, II, 800-01); and more generally, Bobbio; D'Orsi; Levra and Tranfaglia.

C. Gordon particular quality of the dialectical movement between Auschwitz and the "here and-now" which is the prime source of ethical energy in his writing. 1t acts as a locus of profound ethical and narrative value in his work, as a powerful ordinary (normal and normative) counterweight to the antiethical, valueless, alien "other place" or "no-place" of the Lager.6 In order to locate "the home" within Levi's ethical universe we will in turn replay elements of his autobiographical writing, revisit in this new light the extraordinary dialogue fforn afar between Levi and the Austrian-born survivor Jean Améry, and finally probe the oeuvre for its textured usage of imagery of the home as both a remembered (that is, a lost) place and a real (that is, a refound) place, and so as a synecdochic fragment of Levi's larger humane, communal and sensitively intelligent ethics. 2. Corso Re Umberto One of the few commentators to have picked up on the central importance of the home for Levi — perhaps because he actually visited him in situ in corso Re Umberto in Turin over a number of days — was Philip Roth, in his remarkable 1986 interview for the New York Times Book Review. Early on in the piece Roth writes: In a large apartment house built a few years before he was born - and where he was born, for formerly this was the home of his parents - Levi lives with his wife, Lucia; except for his year in Auschwitz and the adventurous months immediately after his libération, he has lived in the same apartment ail his life. [...] I don't personally know of another contemporary writer who has voluntarily remained, over so many décades, intimately entangled and in such direct, unbroken contact with his immediate family, his birthplace, his région, the world of his forebears, and, particularly, with his local working environment [...]. Of ali the intellectually gifted artists of this Century [...] he may well be the most thoroughly adapted to the totality of the life around him. Perhaps in the case of Primo Levi, a life of communal interconnectedness, along with his masterpiece Survival in Auschwitz, constitutes his profoundly civilized and spirited response to those who did ail they could to sever his every sustaining connection and tear him and his kind out of history. (Roth 14-15; cf. Levi, Voice 137) Roth pinpoints carefully the signifìcance of the home for Levi as a place but also as an anchor for value, as a token of community and rootedness and therefore of a 6 On the terms "other place" (or heterotopia) and "no place" (or utopia), see Foucault and cf. Bürde» (7-8). In the context of the ordinary, home-based origin of Levi's ethics, it would be instructive also to read him through the Freudian notion of the "uncanny" or unheimlich, where. precisely, the site of value and security of the bourgeois home is undermined from within by fear and absence. This is the working hypothesis of Cesaretti (whose work on the dimora in Italian fiction I have only been able to read in summary).</page><page sequence="5">Primo Levi and the Ethics of Home 219 rapport with memory and history, of successful adaptation to his environment (a Darwinian vocabulary which Levi himself drew on, frequently and ironically, to connote ethical value). He also rightly takes the bare biographical fact of Levi's sedentary life as emblematic of his résistance to the moment of exile, alien hostility and disconnectedness represented by Auschwitz. This contrapuntai quality to Levi's ethics of home is what prevents it from becoming settled, conservative and static as an ethics. Levi himself had published a remarkable piece on his home in the year preceding Roth's interview, entitled "La mia casa," which he tellingly placed as the first essay in his rich collection of occasionai journalism, L'altrui mestiere (II, 633 36).7 "La mia casa" is primarily an affectionate tribute to his home, written with warmth and humour; but as so often with Levi, an apparently light and unelaborate piece such as this conceals important interpretative threads for his work. Three threads in particular are interesting. First, Levi explores in severa! différent ways the instinctive, "natural" bond between self and home using a characteristic mix of anthropomorphic and ethological vocabulary:8 Abito da sempre (con involontarie interruzioni) nella casa in cui sono nato. [...] Credo che il mio sia un caso estremo di sedentarietà, paragonabile a quello di certi molluschi, ad esempio le patelle, che dopo un breve stadio larvale in cui nuotano liberamente, si fissano ad uno scoglio, secernono un guscio e non si muovono più per tutta la vita. (II, 633) [...] durante l'ultimo conflitto, [la casa] ha sopportato tutti i bombardamenti cavandosela con qualche danno ai serramenti, e qualche screpolatura che porta tuttora con l'orgoglio con cui un veterano porta le cicatrici. (II, 633) Con questa casa, e con l'alloggio in cui abito, ho un rapporto inavvertito ma profondo, come si ha con le persone con cui si è convissuto a lungo. (I, 634) Non mi è facile parlare del rapporto che ho con lei [la casa]: forse è di natura gattesca, come i gatti amo gli agi ma posso anche fame a meno, e mi sarei adattato abbanstanza bene anche ad un alloggiamento disagiato, come varie volte mi è successo [...]. (Il, 636) Abito a casa mia come abito all'interno della mia pelle [...]. (Il, 636) In this mix of imagery, Levi locates the origin of the "communal interconnectedness" noted by Roth quite literally in his physical rapport with his 7 "La mia casa" is one of the few pieces in L 'altrui mestiere not to have been published as journalism previously. According to Belpoliti, editor of Levi's Opere, it was probably written in the early 1980s (II, 1557). 8 On Levi's extensive use of animai imagery and behaviour. see Belpoliti "Animali." Two poems extend the analogy between home and nature, "Cuore di legno" (II, 554 about his "neighbour", a horse chestnut tree); and "La chiocciola" (II, 573).</page><page sequence="6">220 Robert S. C. Gordon house and home. Intimate, interpersonal, instinctive, ordinary (he writes more than once of the building's unexceptional, even bland soiidity), arbitrary in that he was born there by chance and could have lived elsewhere, but also somehow of intense defìning value for him, the home is here both a physical place and a quality of existence and this cruciai duality will run throughout his deployment of the motif in his work. The second thread to "La mia casa" connects the home to one of the fundamental axes of Levi's work and indeed of any work bound up with testimony and the représentation of history: that is, the axis of memory. Levi recalls fforn his reading that the spaces of homes were for a long time used as sites in mnemonic techniques, whereby rooms or places within the home were imagined as filled with the items or images to be remembered, such that an imaginary walk through the home from room to room could swiftly recali each item or image to mind. This is the home as "memory palace" (Belpoliti 1998, 116-20; Spence; Yates). At once, the rooting of memory in the home sets the latter once again in antithetical contrast to the oblivion of the Holocaust, which Levi defined in I sommersi e i salvati as "a war against memory" (II, 1013). But there is a further step in Levi's évocation of his home as a place of memory, which makes that antithetical positioning against the other- or no-place of the camps even more characteristic: he points out that, in fact, his home could not function as an artificial spatial mnemonic for him, since every corner, nook, and cranny is already laden with his own memories, his family's stories and historiés, their objects, and also by extension that of the road, the quartiere and the city of Turin around them.9 In the paragraphs at the heart of the essay, Levi traces the historiés (or trasfigurazioni, II, 635) of one or other corner, such as the small room that has been in turn a drawing-room, a maid's bedroom, an office, a temporary dormitory (during the War), a children's room and now a sort of lab, for developing photos, Sewing and making toys. These paragraphs have something of the object- and space-obsessed quality of the writing of Georges Perec, a writer with whom Levi had many affinities, from their scientific and taxonomic mindset, to their penchant for word play and formai experiment, to their différent but intense encounters with the death and loss caused by the Holocaust (Beilos 51-63, 398-403; Cavaglion, "Asimmetrie" 228). For Levi, the binding up of home and memory with the intimate private history of the self and the public history of change in the city around him adds a further résonance to the domestic. The honte is both a token of memory, of the possibility of re-encountering the past in a general sense, of the border between memory and larger historiés and a storehouse of the particularities of each of us, and the configurations that memory takes on as a resuit. In this sense "La mia casa" displays strong links with the first chapter of II sistema periodico, "Argon" (I, 741 - 56), which attempts to salvage the peculiar language, humour and gossipy communal texture of the Piedmontese-Jewish subculture within which Levi's ' See also "II fondaco del nonno" (II, 827-30) and "II mondo invisibile" (II, 800-04).</page><page sequence="7">Primo Levi and the Ethics of Home 221 family had its origins (Cavaglion, "Argon"). Finally, it is worth pointing to Levi's disingenuous, even contradictory attempts in "La mia casa" to relate (or not to relate) his home to his writing. Towards the end of the essay, he suggests that his environment has not had any real effect on his writing at ali, although shortly before, and more than once earlier, he points out that his relationship with his house is so natural and long-standing that he cannot step outside of it and analyse it with objectivity. What is more, at the start of the essay he had suggested a direct link between his sedentary, mollusc-like existence in Corso Re Umberto and a yearning for the opposite, for travel, which pervades his narrative: "Forse debbo a questo destino statico l'amore mal soddisfatto che nutro per i viaggi, e la frequenza con cui il viaggio appare come topos in molti dei miei libri" (II, 633). The confusion is interesting here, because it suggests something about the relationship between biographical reality and the slightly displaced configuration of home and travel which characterizes Levi's written work, where journeys, déportation, other places, imagined worlds — imagined or experienced, within the "whirlwind" of the Holocaust and beyond — pulì at and test out the anchor of the home, and the baggage of associations, values, and sites that come with it. As so often with Levi, the Strands of "La mia casa" (the naturai bond of self and home; the rapport between home, memory and history; the impact of home on writing) are best brought together through reference to his intense fascination with language and etymology. In a later piece ffom L'altrui mestiere, entitled "Le parole fossili" (II, 819-22), Levi offers a gamut of instances where digging into the etymology of rare dialect terms has provided him with an intense, purely amateur pleasure ("il diletto incontaminato dei dilettanti," II, 820). On this basis he makes one of his key déclarations of tempérament and (implicitly ethical) principle, allying himself with the eccentric and the oblique, with a preference for surreptitious détails rather than sweeping panoramas, "single tiles rather than whole mosaics" (11, 820). But before this larger statement of principle, the first page of the essay is taken up with an extended example of the art of excavating a word, its history and value. The word in questions is "baita," which Levi first found many years previously in a book by Mario Rigoni Stern (Il sergente della neve 29), recognized ffom his locai Piedmontese dialects, which he used in his own work in due course ("Piombo", Il sistema periodico I, 813) and finally linked to a word in Hebrew, "bait." When he confirms the Paleo-European connections between the shared terms and thus between threads of his own identity — his Judaism, his Piedmontese roots, and his war experience which ally him strongly to his friend Rigoni Stern — he is moved, imagining the word as an emblem of a "golden age," before conflict, war, failed communication, before Babel. The word "baita" means, of course, shelter, safe-haven, or more commonly "home." 3. Améry, Levi, and "die Heimat" Levi's fascinating, troubled, and strangely instructive dialogue from afar with the</page><page sequence="8">222 Robert S. C. Gordon Austrian-born Auschwitz survivor Jean Améry has been charted more than once before (Molino Signorini, Segre, Stille, Wood). For the most part, the dialogue and commentaries on it concentrated on a small number of intensely diffìcult questions: the définition and role of the intellectual in Auschwitz; the response to Nazi violence (Améry theorized notions of "returning the blow" and "resentment" as necessary positions for the maintenance of even a minimum of dignity; Levi's more pacifie response earned him the epithet of "forgiver" from Améry);10 the nature and meaning of suicide (first Améry's in 1978 and then Levi's own, nine years later); the role of national identity in governing the experience of déportation to Auschwitz. Without replaying their dialogue step by step, it is worth revisiting the last of these points of encounter and reconsidering it in the light of Levi's particular attachment to a place and notion of home and its possible relation to an ethical mode of thinking and writing in his work. In his essay "L'intellettuale ad Auschwitz" (II, 1091-108), drawing on both Améry and on his own earlier work, Levi draws a distinction at the level of language. Alongside the terrible physical suffering of the Lager, figures such as Améry suffered a profoundly disturbing and alienating loss of their Germanie identity in cultural héritage and language, as the latter was barbarized and turned into the instrument of their torture and death. Levi and other Italians, by contrast, suffered another, more immediately dangerous predicament of aliénation, in that they did not for the most part speak any German at ali, nor even Yiddish, and thus were set apart fforn both guards and the mass of other prisoners in the most basic way. This distinction stands for a larger one between those like himself and those like Améry, which Levi summarizes neatly: "L'uno era deportato, l'altro uno straniero in patria" (II, 1097). Améry talks at greatest length about these questions of national identity, language, and its loss not in the title essay fforn his At The Mind's Limits, which Levi discusses at greatest length in I sommersi e i salvati, but in another less noted piece entitled in German "Wieviel Heimat braucht der Mensch?" (Jenseits 71-100), in Levi's italian rendering, "Di quanta patria ha bisogno l'uomo?" (I, 1249)," and in its English translation, "How Much Home Does a Person Need?" (Mind's Limit 41-61). The slight discrepancy in translation is understandable and signifìcant, of course. It is well known that the German word Heimat marks out a potent semantic spectrum, tapped into throughout the modem évolution of the myth of German nationhood, which Stretches from an image of the hearth, the locai, folkloristic, intimate space of home, to the local région, and ali the way to a grand Romantic 10 Améry used the epithet in a letter exchanged with Levi via a third party (/ sommersi e i salvati, II, 1098). See also Levi, Voice 111-12, 186. " This quotation is taken front Levi's tribute to Améry in La stampa on the latter's death in December 1978. Améry's Jenseits was translated into Italian only in 1987, under the title L 'intellettuale ad Auschwitz, deliberately chosen to underline his connection to Levi.</page><page sequence="9">Primo Levi and the Ethics of Home 223 sense of nation, even race (Applegate; Boa).12 And Améry in his essay draws on the full spectrum of meanings of his chosen term, well aware of the risk he is running, since to talk in positive terms of Heimat is almost to déclaré oneself as a reactionary, a nostalgie nationalist: "The temper of the epoch is not favourable to the idea of homeland, that is obvious. Whoever hears talk of it immediately thinks of narrow nationalism, of territorial claims by associations of expellees, of things of the past" (Mind's Limit 54). In part, the aim of his essay is to reclaim the term fforn its reactionary associations, since he is convinced that, for ali the apparent buzz of modernity associated with exile or citizenship of the world, we are lesser beings without the rootedness of home: "[...] it is not good to have no home," as the essay concludes (61). And he does so by probing the term and his memory of his own exile from Austria in Belgium, by salvaging the localized, intimate, and subjective qualities of Heimat in ways that chime interestingly with Levi's use of the motif. Besides the association of home with language, and the loss of both, which Améry discusses at length in his essay and Levi analyses with consistent concentration throughout his oeuvre, two elements of "How Much Home Does a Person Need?" help us fili out our understanding of the home as a marker of identity and ethics, as something more than a patria narrowly understood, and thus provide a basis for rereading Levi in this light. The first element strongly echoes "La mia casa": for Améry too, the home is bound up with subjectivities, with objects, places, stories, and historiés, and therefore with memory: What we cali home still gives access to a reality that for us consists of perception through the senses. Unlike the physicist [...], we are dépendent on seeing, hearing, touching. Perhaps I am not speaking only for my already declining generation of those around fifty when 1 say that we are accustomed to living with things that tell us stories. We need a house of which we know who lived in it before us, a piece of furniture in whose small irregularities we recognize the craftsman who worked on it. We need a city whose features stir at least faint memories of the old copperplate engraving in the muséum. [...] Remembering. That is the eue [...]. (57) 12 The term can also mean animal habitat, recalling Levi's propensity for ethological vocabulary noted earlier (note 8). Some of the same ambiguity attaches to the word il paese (country and home village) in Italian, which Levi exploits in Se non ora, quando? (see below). It is also worth noting that Levi was not averse to using the category of national character to understand actions and events. Germans and Germanie character in particular seemed to represent key test-cases for analyzing the Holocaust. For example, his slight mistrust of Steinlauf, the Austrian in the camp who teaches him always to keep clean, however absurd it might seem, dérivés from a mistrust of Germanie absolutes; in / sommersi e i salvati, he associâtes Germans and the Final Solution with a certain "mancanza di misura" or "Masslosigkeit" (II, 1104); and in La tregua he contrasts German and Russian character more than once (I, 250. 263, 268).</page><page sequence="10">224 Robert S. C. Gordon It is worth noting that, in their shared conjoining of home, memories of objects and cities, and storytelling, each to différent degrees bound up with the trauma of the experience and the storytelling of exile, déportation, and the loss of home, Améry and Levi are also echoing a paragraph of Benjamin's famous essay: [...] people imagine the storyteller as someone who has come from afar. But they enjoy no less listening to the man who has stayed at home, making an honest living, and who knows the local taies and traditions. If one wants to picture these two groups [of storytellers] through their archaic représentatives, one is embodied in the resident tiller of the soil, and the other in the trading seaman. (84-85)13 These two basic archétypes of storytellers found a level of interpénétration for Benjamin in the medieval artisan class, where the "resident master craftsman and the travelling journeymen worked together in the same rooms" (85). Thus "was combined the lore of faraway places, such as a much-travelled man brings home, with the lore of the past, as it best reveals itself to natives of a place" (85). In Benjamin's mix of home and journeying, of craftsmen, artisans, and sea-farers, and ali their stories, there is a bundle of archétypes and character types which pervade Levi's work, not only as elements of narrative, but also as motifs of ethical enquiry.14 And in particular the reclaiming of home ("But they enjoy no less [...]"), and the broad interpénétration of the two pôles of home and afar that Benjamin evokes, befit Levi's writing in particular, given its dual anchoring in the ordinary and the sedentary and in the uncommon, alien world of the camps. The second element to pick out of Améry's essay emerges from his association of home with security, and it introduces an interpersonal and cognitive dimension into the category of home which is crucial in establishing its ethical dimension in Levi. Two extracts make the point: Home is security, I say. At home we are in full command of the dialectics of knowledge and récognition, of trust and confidence. [...] The entire field of the related words loyal, familiar, confidence, to trust, to entrust, trusting belongs in the broader psychological area of feeling secure. (47) I was a person who could no longer say "we" and who therefore said "I" merely out of habit, but not with the feeling of full possession of my self. [...] I was no longer I and did not live 13 For connections between Benjamin and Levi, see Bodrato; Bertone 193-98; Giglioli; Gordon, Virtues (chapter 11 ). 14 A list of such characters in Levi's work would be a long one. from Faussone in La chiave a stella to several of the characters encountered in // sistema periodico (in "Piombo", "Mercurio", "Oro") to the "mirror-maker" of Racconti e saggi to Tischler, whom Levi met in the camps (Lilìt). See Conclusion below.</page><page sequence="11">Primo Levi and the Ethics of Home 225 within a We. I had no passport, and no past, and no money, and no history. There was only a line of ancestors, but it consisted of sad landless knights, stricken by an anathema. (44) Levi too builds sortie of the soundest foundations of his ethics in a Cluster of values that includes knowledge, community, ffiendship, récognition of the other, and trust — and so the possibility of saying "we" (Gordon, "Friendship"). Améry's essay allows these elements to be bound up with a reworked notion of die Heimat, and thus to indicate that Levi's use of the imagery of la casa might be less commonplace and uninteresting, less purely bound up with tempérament and biographical accident, than might at first appear. 4. "Vous n'êtes pas à la maison" Quietly but forcefully, the motif of the home emerges at some of the most intense, climactic points of Levi's oeuvre, a marker of identity and value in the face oftheir dissolution. This is true frorn the very outset of his work, in the poem (written in January 1946 and later published with the title "Shemà") that stands as the epigraph to Se questo è un uomo (I, 3). If most attention in the poem is given over to the awful "mock" définition of man and woman, and their destruction ("Considerate se questo è un uomo [...] una donna"), and to the imperative to memory ("Vi commando queste parole. / Scolpitele nel vostro cuore [...]"), the image of the home appears twice, in the framing stanzas of the poem, as if acting as a control over those centrai concerns: Voi che vivete sicuri Nelle vostre case, Voi che trovate tornando a sera Il cibo caldo e visi amici: Considerate [...] 0 vi si sfaccia la casa. La malattia vi impedisca, 1 vostri nati torcano il viso da voi. (emphases added)15 The apostrophic nature of the poem, its angry interpellation of us, the readers, is at its strongest in these lines, since the image of the home, of security, of friends, of 15 Like much of the poem, the image is a reworking of the "Shema" prayer, from Deuteronomy: "And thou shalt teil them to thy children, and thou shalt meditate upon them sitting in thy house, and Walking on thy journey, sleeping, and rising" (6, vii). This text also connects Levi's ethics of home to founding dynamics of attentiveness and respect in his ethics as a whole, dynamics of looking ("I vostri nati torcano il viso da voi") and listening ("Shemà").</page><page sequence="12">226 Robert S. C. Gordon the tastes of warm food, of family (many of which Améry had also evoked) are the strengest tokens of a normality and a morality that Levi is threatening with annihilation if we do not heed the lesson of Auschwitz. The same sense of dissolution of the home is contained within the poem-epigraph to La tregua (also written in January 1946 and later entitled "Alzarsi"), transposed into an évocation of return: Ora abbiamo ritrovato la casa. Il nostro ventre è sazio. Abbiamo finito di raccontare. E tempo. Presto udremo ancora 11 comando straniero: "Wstawac" (I, 203; emphasis added) Famously, the theme of this poem is reworked in prose in the final page of La tregua, where Levi has returned to Turin, but suffers freni a recurring nightmare, that this return might turn out to be the dream, and that he will awake to the reality that Auschwitz is always and everywhere the only reality he has: [...] ed ecco, io so che cosa questo significa, ed anche so di averlo sempre saputo: sono di nuovo in Lager, e nulla era vero all'infuori del Lager. Il resto era breve vacanza, o inganno dei sensi, sogno: la famiglia, la natura in fiore, la casa. (1, 395) The Polish order "Wstawac" and the themes of the dream and return, bound up with imagery of telling stories and eating ("Tornare; mangiare; raccontare," I, 203), first emerge in the chapter of Se questo è un uomo entitled "Le nostre notti," where Levi recounts the two dreams he and every other Lager inmate suffered from, a dream of returning and not being listened to and a dream of food that could not be eaten (1, 54-5; and again I, 64). Both are also dreams of home, of course; pathological dreams dictated by a bodily "homing" instinct, which in fact only renders the waking reality even worse. A few pages earlier, Levi had captured this pathology, this "home-sickness," using the German term which Améry later uses also in his essay: "La baracca di legno, stipata di umanità dolente, è piena di parole, di ricordi e di un altro dolore. 'Heimweh' si chiama in tedesco questo dolore: è una bella parola, vuol dire 'dolore della casa'" (I, 49). And he had reflected on the realization that struck him in the relative cairn of the camp hospital, that the greatest danger of the camp system was not so much death as the shaming destruction of humanity. Once again, the imagery of home is centrai to this realization: "Se dall'interno del Lager un messaggio avesse potuto trapelare agli uomini liberi, sarebbe stato questo: fate di non subire nelle vostre case ciò che a noi viene inflitto qui" (1,49). If this Cluster of moments in Levi's work sets up the home as a powerful and</page><page sequence="13">Primo Levi and the Ethics of Home 227 persistent counterpoint to the worst offences of the "univers concentrationnaire," a number of other moments in Se questo è un uomo contribute to building up our sense of the home as a touchstone for a sériés of ethical values growing out of that counterpoint. In "Il canto di Ulisse" (I, 105-11), for example, Levi and Jean il Pikolo strike up their conversation by sharing memories of home, in which local landscape or family stories are less important for their personal specificity than for the sharing itself: home here is a quality of being to be exchanged communally, forging a sort of temporary friendship which acts as a shelter or home fforn home. This quality is a particular form of Améry's définition of home as security, as a place of protection and trust. And similar associations emerge fforn imagery found in Se questo è un uomo which in part is already familiar from our discussion of "La mia casa," the animal imagery of the shell or the nest, and the Darwinian association of home with proper adaptation to an environment: La facoltà umana di scavarsi una nicchia, di secernere un guscio, di erigersi intorno una tenue barriera di difesa, anche in circostanze apparentemente disperate, è stupefacente, e meriterebbe uno studio approfondito. Si tratta di un prezioso lavoro di adattamento, in parte passivo e inconscio, e in parte attivo: di piantare un chiodo sopra la cuccetta per appendervi le scarpe di notte; di stipulare taciti patti di non aggressione coi vicini; di intuire e accettare le consuetudini e le leggi del singolo Kommando e del singolo Block. In virtù di questo lavoro, dopo qualche settimana si riesce a raggiungere un certo equilibrio, un certo grado di sicurezza di fronte agli imprevisti, ci si è fatto un nido, il trauma del travasamento è superato. (1, 50) The activities of adaptation are a form of home-building; they entail creating an intimate, private space (even in the naked, ungiving space of the camp), establishing recognisable pacts for dealing with neighbours (even in the inevitably selfish compétition for food in the camp), learning the rules (even in the incompréhensible Babel of the camp), so that some degree of predictability is attained (even in the arbitrary violence of the camp). Ali these elements — privacy, récognition, community, knowledge, and intelligent predictability — are forms of ordinary virtue with their origin in home-building, as an (animal) instinct but also an elected (humane, ethical) act. The loss of the habits of home at the outset of Levi's account of déportation sets the former into particular relief in the early parts of Se questo è un uomo. One of the most moving moments in his entire oeuvre cornes in the book's first chapter, on the night before his déportation fforn the prison camp in Fossoli towards Auschwitz. It is built on precisely the poignant contrast between the everyday family habits of the home and its children (recalling the link between house and children in "Shemà") and their desperate new meaning when performed at such a time and in such a place: [...] le madri vegliarono a preparare con dolce cura il cibo per il viaggio, e lavarono i</page><page sequence="14">228 Robert S. C. Gordon bambini, e fecero i bagagli, [...] e non dimenticarono le fasce, e i giocattoli, e i cuscini, e le cento piccole cose che esse ben sanno, e di cui i bambini hanno in ogni caso bisogno. Non fareste anche voi altrettanto? Se dovessero uccidervi domani col vostro bambino, voi non gli dareste oggi da mangiare? (1,9) The intensity of the scene dérivés front its apparent ordinariness, and front the clutter of things that recalls the sense, in both "How Much Home Does a Person Need?" and "La mia casa," of the home as a storehouse of familiar objects. The insight implicit in this rhetorical appeal is developed further as Levi describes the first impact of arrivai in the Lager, in the chapter "Sul fondo," where the everyday habits, the objects that make us at home, are the pivotal site for our identity and its loss, and also the centre of our moral compass: [...] consideri ognuno, quanto valore, quanto significato è racchiuso anche nelle più piccole nostre abitudini quotidiane, nei cento oggetti nostri che il più umile mendicante possiede: un fazzoletto, una vecchia lettera, la fotografia di una persona cara. Queste cose sono parte di noi, quasi come membra del nostro corpo; [...]. Si immagini ora un uomo a cui, insieme con le persone amate, vengano tolti la sua casa, le sue abitudini, i suoi abiti, tutto infine, letteralmente tutto quanto possiede: sarà un uomo vuoto, ridotto a sofferenza e bisogno, dimentico di dignità e discernimento, poiché accade facilmente a chi ha perso tutto, di perdere se stesso; [...]. (1,21) The epithets "dignità" and "discernimento" are telling here, as if to have those everyday habits, a home, clothes (rather like the shell of the mollusc, and unlike the enforced nudity of the camps), loved ones, and the like is also to have human dignity and the capacity to judge, to make reasoned, rooted, ethical choices. The pages of Se questo è un uomo suggest that the loss of any such capacity was a defining characteristic of the so-called Muselmänner, those who were so weakened and drained as to have lost ali will, simply waiting to die (Agamben 37 80). Levi never quite reaches that state: as an earlier quotation suggests, he continues to follow a home-building instinct even using nails and ill-fitting shoes. A similar implicit ethical optimism allowed Levi to hold onto a notion of friendship even in a world of fleeting contacts and distrust such as that of the camp (Gordon, "Friendship" 190-91). This belief in the possibility, the usefulness of what Améry calls "ersatz" homes (44-45), sets Levi apart from Améry, echoing the degree to which his actual return home after Auschwitz set him apart from Améry, the permanent exile. These différences were not unproblematic for Levi, however; and in the course of his work after Se questo è un uomo, he explored along parallel tracks the two distinct archetypal (perhaps archetypically Jewish) expériences he and Améry might be said to stand for: exile and return home.</page><page sequence="15">Primo Levi and the Ethics of Home 229 5. Exile and Return The myth of the Jewish diaspora is one of wandering and exile but it is also a myth which dreams of return. Both Améry in "How Much Home Does a Person Need?" (44) and Levi in his poem "Pasqua" (11, 564) draw on the Passover prayer which promises, or yearns for, "next year in Jerusalem." And both also rework the prayer: Améry characteristically detaching it from its literal realization and thus holding on to the tragic state of exile ("it wasn't at ail a matter of really getting to the Holy Land," 44); Levi characteristically universalizing it, making return a dream of justice — "l'anno venturo in virtù e giustizia." In two narrative works, published over twenty-years apart but with powerful formai and thematic parallels between thern,'6 Levi pursues a dialogue between exile and return which not only binds him to his Jewishness more than the rest of his work, but also allows him to work through the thematics of home beyond its emergence in Se questo è un uomo. The two works are La tregua and Se non ora, quando?. La tregua is the story of a journey home. Se non ora, quando? is the fiction of a journey (across large swathes of the same geographical space as La tregua traced out in the overlapping maps with itineraries that preface both books)17 towards the unknown, towards a new life (in Palestine), and away from home, a home which in any case has been utterly destroyed. Between these simultaneously parallel and opposite trajectories, fantasies of home work their way to the very core of what the two books are about. In La tregua, it is self evident that Levi's struggle to get back to Turin and the often lengthy, inexplicable or rocambolesque delays in doing so define the book in its structure and its theme. At the end, the narrator pauses to look back over his journey into exile and then home again as a sort of summa of all he has experienced: Avevamo resistito, dopo tutto: avevamo vinto. Dopo l'anno di Lager, di pena e di pazienza; dopo l'ondata di morte seguita alla liberazione; dopo il gelo e la fame e il disprezzo e la fiera compagnia del greco; dopo le malattie e la miseria di Katowice; dopo i trasferimenti insensati, per cui c'eravamo sentiti dannati a gravitare in eterno attraverso gli spazi russi, come inutili astri spenti; dopo l'ozio e la nostalgia acerba di Starye Doroghi, eravamo in risalita, dunque, in viaggio all'in su, in cammino verso casa. (1, 370) More telegraphically, the emotional force of the book explodes in the cries at an announcement that the journey towards Italy is to begin, cries which could almost stand as the battlecry of the whole narrative: "A casa! a casa!" (I, 296). 16 Besides the geographica! and cartographical links noted below. La tregua and Se non ora, quando? share more or less overlapping chronologies, cultural milieux (a mix of Russian, Yiddish, Ukrainian, Greek, and German elements), endpoints (Northern Italy as safety), humour, and tempérament. 17 On maps, see Levi, Voice 136; Belpoliti, Levi 114-15.</page><page sequence="16">230 Robert S. C. Gordon Indeed, part of the strength of the book as narrative lies in the fact that it is not just Levi who is drawn towards home, but also the variegated group of former deportees in his same situation, and the whole maelstrom of différent individuals and groups all pushing for home across the chaos of post-war Europe. Cesare, Levi's closest companion, abandons the groups near the end of the journey in order to fulfil his grand pledge, to reach home by air (Levi tells the story of his return in Lilìt II, 54-8); the straggling convoys of the Russian army heading for home pass through Starye Doroghi, on foot, horse, cart, motorbike, tank, tractor, even bus, a running spectacle of vitality and exhaustion (I, 342-4). Even when Levi reaches Germany, his questioning of how the Germans he sees could possibly live with a clean conscience is filtered through the imagery of return: "Sapevano, 'loro', di Auschwitz, della strage silenziosa e quotidiana, a un passo dalle loro porte? Se sì, come potevano andare per via, tornare a casa e guardare i loro figli [...]?" (II, 392; with echoes of'Shemà"). Finally, one moment in La tregua reminds us of the baggage of values that the home brings with it in Levi, its marking of an ethical position as well as an object of affective nostalgia, here indicated by the association of home with a vision of utopia. At one of the early wrong turnings in his journey, Levi reflects that the search for home, or even for a surrogate of home ("un surrogato accettabile delle nostre case," I, 229) was part of a larger search for "un mondo diritto e giusto, miracolosamente ristabilito sulle sue naturali fondamenta dopo una eternità di stravolgimenti, di errori e di stragi" (I, 229; with echoes of "Pasqua"). The journey to his real home, for Levi, is then in part a series of disappointments, a puncturing of utopian hopes; but it is also a reconciliation, a reacquisition of the less grand values and virtues that his real, ordinary world and "its naturai foundations" are built on. Hence, the renaissance of friendship, humour, and play, wit and inventiveness, shrewd intelligence, shared endeavour, self-sufficiency, and ali the other vital "ordinary virtues" that characterize Levi's adventures in La tregua are readable as part of the journey home, of the sloughing off of both dystopia (Auschwitz) and illusory utopia (the just world) along the way. The motif of home and its irretrievable loss emerges in Se non ora, quando? largely through the memories of its protagonist Mendel, which represent the terrible homelessness of the group of Jewish partisans he joins and by extension of the canvas of Eastern European Jewry in so far as it survived at ali. Mendel is haunted by the destruction of his home village Strelka and the death of his wife. The very first words of the novel set us along this path of nostalgia and trauma: "Al mio paese, di orologi ce n'erano pochi [...]" (II, 211). And the first chapter continues to evoke images of Strelka, an ordinary, even banal village of ducks and goats, a church and a synagogue ("si chiama Strelka, come chissà quanti altri paesi," II, 212), which now in its very ordinariness seems like the "Garden of Eden" to Mendel (II, 212): "questa Strelka non c'è più. Metà dei paesani si sono sparsi per la campagna e per il bosco, e l'altra metà stanno in una fossa" (II,</page><page sequence="17">Primo Levi and the Ethics of Home 231 212). Throughout the chapter and the hook, the poignant paradoxes of fighting for and remembering a home that is no longer there reappear, complicating questions of responsibility, posing problems of private and public identity, and morality: "Ne uccideresti uno [pilota] se l'aereo volasse? Se ti portasse a casa?" "Quale casa?", disse Mendel: Leonid non rispose. (Il, 225) "Fai l'eroe, ma anche tu vuoi quello che voglio io, una casa, un letto, una donna, una vita che abbia un senso, una famiglia, un paese che sia il tuo paese." (Il, 242) Si faceva sentire il rimpianto della casa, pesante per tutti, straziante per il gruppo degli ebrei. Per i russi, la speranza della casa era una speranza non irragionevole, anzi probabile: un desiderio di ritorno, un richiamo. Per gli ebrei, il rimpianto delle loro case non era una speranza ma una disperazione, sepolta fino allora sotto dolori più urgenti e gravi, ma latente. Le loro case non c'erano più: erano state spazzate via, incendiate dalla guerra o dalla strage, insanguinate dalle squadre dei cacciatori-uomini; case-tomba, a cui era meglio non pensare, case di cenere. Perché vivere ancora, perché combattere? Per quale casa, per quale patria, per quale avvenire? (II, 319; emphasis added; and compare II, 504-05) "[...] andremo in Palestina, e cercheremo di costruirci la casa che abbiamo perduta." (II, 390) Dov'è la mia casa? È in nessun luogo. [...] Uno entra in una casa e appende gli abiti e i ricordi; dove appendi i tuoi ricordi, Mendel figlio di Nachman? (II, 441; echoes ofthe nail on which to hang one's shoes. Se questo è un uomo I, 50) What is clear from this medley of concordant notes is that the home, in its loss, continues to sustain a set of values, to be the origin of an ethical voice and position: the home is, as we have seen above, a space of memory (and mémorial), of intimacy and shared identity, or normaley, of a cohérence on which to found right action (such as fighting Nazism) and a vision of a possible future. From such a space, action, memory, and language are open to the ethical, to the working through of the choices and dilemmas of how to live; without such a space, without even a notion of home left intact, the ethical is, like the homes, swept away, unthinkable. 6. Conclusion: Ulysses The home in Levi brings together several différent shapes and catégories. It is part narrative archetype, as Benjamin suggested, a site for and source for stories, in conjunction with the sites and sources of journeys and places far from home. It is part affect, memory, privacy, and personal intimacy, which becomes the</page><page sequence="18">232 Robert S. C. Gordon excruciating Heimweh for Levi and Améry when it is stripped away. It is, in small part, a vessel of a certain bourgeois, provincial and/or patriotic set of values (like many of Levi's ethical catégories, it grows out of a certain liberal bourgeois cultural héritage that he acquired in Turin, but is radically recast in the face of Auschwitz). Finally, however, it acts as a sort of gatekeeper to the ethical, opening up catégories of knowledge and acknowledgement, reasoned, felt choice, clarity and attentiveness as the ordinary virtues of the lived life, of what we might cali the "domestic" life. And as if to underline that these catégories of the ethical are "domestic" qualities not bound to one person's home or another's throughout his work, Levi préserves a privileged place for the archetypal Wanderers who carry with them, snail-like, their home-forged wisdom, their craft on their backs. Faussone, in La chiave a stella, is an affectionately mocked version of the wanderer-craftsman, but the epitome of the archetype for Levi is the seafarer: not so much, however, the demented, transgressive, heroic seafarer such as the Ancient Mariner, Melville's Ahab, Dante's Ulisse (all crucial models for Levi in certain ways), but rather the practised, knowledgeable, crafty seafarers of Conrad, Vercel or Homer's Odyssey. It is Homer's Ulysses that Levi brings to mind in one of his most ethically alert and illuminating encounters, with the crew of the submarine "Castoro 6," written up in the essay "Trenta ore sul Castoro seT (II, 704-10): nelle loro parole, frenate, educate, precise e prive di enfasi, ho riconosciuto l'eco della voce di un altro navigatore e raccontatore le cui avventure remote sono oggi poesia eterna: quello che aveva navigato per dieci anni per mari strani, e le cui virtù prime, più assai del coraggio che pure non gli mancava, furono la pazienza e l'ingegno molteplice. (11,710) It is not as paradoxical as it may seem for literature's greatest journeyer to embody Levi's domestic ethics, since it is surely no coincidence that, where Dante's Ulisse heads towards the open sea, the unknown world, and death, Homer's Ulysses, like Levi in La tregua, wearily and after many trials, heads for home.
