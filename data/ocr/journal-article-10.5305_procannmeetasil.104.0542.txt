<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 542 ASIL Proceedings, 2010 K. Russell LaMotte Thank you, Dan, and thank you for summarizing 15 years of climate negotiating history in 15 minutes. Kudos for that. So we have an excellent description of the Gordian knot that negotiators faced walking into Copenhagen. Let’s turn it over to Jeff to tell us about what happened and what the de ́nouement was. Remarks by Jeffrey M. Klein* Dan gave a good summary of the background of where we were. In my presentation, I’ll try to give you a picture of what happened at Copenhagen, what’s happening now, and where the negotiations are likely to go over the next year. But first I’d like to key off some of the comments that Dan made and talk a little bit about why Copenhagen was so difficult, perhaps from a U.S. perspective. There was very little progress up until Copenhagen, despite the fact that theoretically there had been two years of negotiations. The most palpable reasons for the deadlock were substantive disputes over mitigation (what countries were willing to do to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions), and financing (how much developed countries were willing to put forward in terms of money to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change). From a U.S. perspective, it was critical that, first, any deal must contain legal symmetry, meaning that it had to have actions from the major developing countries like China and India. Not only was this a domestic political imperative, but you simply can’t solve the climate change problem without having all major emitters make significant efforts to control their emissions. The science suggests that even if every single developed country were to drop its emissions to zero, without significant developing-country action, atmospheric concentrations of carbon would rise to catastrophic levels. So that was essential. Second, it was critical that any deal must include processes for review, so that countries would be standing behind what they had agreed to do. And third, financing would need to align with reality and our domestic political limitations, recognizing that the bulk of financing was going to come ultimately from private and market-based mechanisms. These negotiating imperatives, which were shared by most developed countries, were in direct conflict with the positions of developing countries like China. China and similar countries did not want to have any domestically financed actions incorporated in a deal or reviewed, and they were arguing that developed countries had caused the problem and they had to be the ones to solve it. Moreover, many developing countries were demanding levels of financing that to us were outside the realm of possibility. So despite intense diplomatic efforts, by a fewweeks before Copenhagen, it had become clear that developed and developing countries were simply too far apart realistically to bridge the gap in Copenhagen and find a path to a treaty. So world leaders began thinking about Copenhagen as either a weigh station on the path to a future treaty, or as a meeting designed to reach a series of political commitments, or as some combination of both. But despite this dialing back of expectations, the Copenhagen negotiations themselves were wildly contentious. They began with procedural wrangling and gamesmanship. They devolved into periods of complete and utter chaos, at least on mitigation, and we did little * Of the U.S. Department of State. </page> <page sequence="2"> The Road Forward from Copenhagen: Climate Change Policy in the 21st Century 543 but spin in circles for almost two weeks. This chaos was compounded by the enormous complexity of the negotiations, arguably the largest negotiations ever—upwards of 30,000 people were in attendance, with over 22,000 observers and media, and often up to 10 separate and interlinked negotiations all running in parallel at the same time—so you’re running from room to room to room, often deep into the night, night after night, and not much progress was being made. In part, this was because there was a core group of about five countries that came to the negotiations with the apparent objective of scuttling any deal. To give an example, in one negotiation, we had moved very far in a text by day four of the negotiations, and it looked like with a few tinkers, we would have a final text that night. And then Bolivia and Saudi Arabia showed up. Bolivia insisted it could no longer live with a phrase that had been agreed to by all countries, including Bolivia, for the last two years, and their negotiators refused to explain why. Then Saudi Arabia joined in and said that they had to replace all the paragraphs with slight variations in each paragraph. So, six days of negotiation later, not one issue had been resolved. In another group, not to pick on Bolivia, but they had insisted that all parties agree to grant specific rights to ‘‘Mother Earth,’’ and this left many delegations befuddled as we attempted to figure out whether it was possible even to grant rights to an anthropomorphic abstraction and what that would mean for other anthropomorphic abstractions like, say, Father Time. [Laughter] There were lots of these very curious moments in the negotiations. I don’t want to single out Bolivia, even though it seemed like at the time they deserved to be singled out, but the fact is that progress wasn’t being made because country positions simply had not evolved significantly in the two years since they had agreed on their mandate in Bali. We were simply very far apart on almost all issues, and we weren’t finding any overlap in our positions that could be the basis of a deal. I don’t think people realize this, but by a few days before the end of Copenhagen, the negotiations had virtually collapsed. With the exception of perhaps the Forestry and Technol- ogy groups, every other group had come to a complete standstill. There was bickering everywhere. Negotiators weren’t even meeting. We were just standing around in the corridors. There wasn’t going to be a deal on anything, nothing. Internally we were describing Copenha- gen as the possible ‘‘Ishtar’’ of international negotiations. [Laughter] Things weren’t helped when the heads of state finally arrived—117 heads of state were supposed to be there—and instead of shaking hands, they were yelling at each other in the back rooms. The host Danes assembled a group of about 28 of the key leaders to try to nail together a high-level deal, but even among that group, not much progress was being made, and China was being intransigent. This was a situation that the President walked into when he arrived: no text, no deal, no path to a deal. ‘‘Nopenhagen,’’ they were calling it. But the President’s arrival did change the dynamics of the high-level negotiation, and his personal effort salvaged something that I thought was pretty useful from the wreckage. In the high-level room, the 28 heads of state did something virtually unheard of in the modern era, as Dan referred to. They personally negotiated, word by word, the text of a highly technical deal. And when the President walked out of the high-level deal a day later, he had </page> <page sequence="3"> 544 ASIL Proceedings, 2010 been instrumental in bringing about an important first step—not only the outlines of a so- called ‘‘Copenhagen Accord,’’ but an accord that incorporated the actions of major developing countries for the first time. So no longer was the world suddenly facing what appeared to be a complete collapse (or so it seemed, because a deal was worked out by 28 heads of state, but there were 194 countries attending the conference). When the Accord came back to the big room, a small number of countries—Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Tuvalu and Venezu- ela—dissented, and much of the rest of the world voiced support for the Accord, but pretty soon we were in the midst of 18 hours of all-night negotiation agony, dozens of points of order everywhere, and no bathroom breaks. At one key moment, the negotiations got so disordered that the United Kingdom called for an adjournment, and everyone flooded out of their seats and proceeded to argue individually with each other, with hundreds of individual arguments across the floor. It was Vietnam arguing with Ecuador, and Nauru with Swaziland. I’ve never seen anything like it. It was a scene out of ‘‘The Tower of Babel’’ and a very fitting end to the conference. But the practical result was that the parties ultimately agreed to ‘‘take note of the Accord,’’ whatever that means, and the meeting dissolved. So what were the major results of Copenhagen? First is the Copenhagen Accord, which is an ‘‘operational political understanding’’ that was negotiated in a small room among 28 key heads of state that represented about three-quarters of the world’s emissions and had representatives frommost everymajor country constituency. Second, there were two decisions to continue to work toward further results under the Convention and Kyoto Protocol tracks. What’s in the Accord? First, it contains an overall goal which recognizes the need to keep global temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius, and to see a peak in global and national emissions ‘‘as soon as possible.’’ Second, it contains a framework for mitigation commitments. Developed countries are to ‘‘commit to implement economy-wide emissions targets’’ that will be later submitted—at this point, they have been submitted—and implemen- tation of those targets, and financing would be internationallymeasured, reported, and verified, and the accounting would be rigorous and transparent. Developing countries will implement mitigation actions that would also be later submitted, and those actions that were supported by international finance would be internationally measured, reported, and verified. Domestically financed actions would be domestically mea- sured, reported, and verified, but be subject to international consultations and analysis. All this reporting and verification seems technical, but it’s actually a lot of the core of the deal because it’s whether or not you’re actually agreeing to something that anyone can look at and say this is a real agreement and you’re actually standing behind it. The third element of the Accord was the establishment of forestry and technology mecha- nisms, and presumably those are along the lines of what was negotiated in the low-level groups. Fourth, there was an acknowledgement of the need for market-based mechanisms to reduce costs. Fifth, there was a commitment to financing by developed countries to the tune of about $10 billion a year over the next three years and a commitment to aim to mobilize $100 billion a year from all sources by 2020, and it also established a climate fund and a high-level panel to assess financing. Sixth, the final thing that the Accord included was a review in 2015 which would be evaluating the goal of whether we should move from 2 degrees Celsius to 1.5 degrees Celsius. That’s a brief outline of what’s in the Accord, but the question is what happens now. So we have this Accord. It’s been taken note of. What does it mean? Right now there’s already been a lot of activity happening. One hundred and fifteen countries have associated themselves </page> <page sequence="4"> The Road Forward from Copenhagen: Climate Change Policy in the 21st Century 545 with the Accord; 74 of them have listed actions that they intend to take pursuant to the Accord. The UN Secretary-General has set up a high-level panel on financing to forward the Accord’s financial provisions. The French held ameeting designed to forward international activity on forests, and the first meeting of the next round of negotiations will take place in two weeks. Some countries will see the Accord as the outline for a treaty or at least an expanded political deal in Mexico, which is the next major meeting later this year. So we’re going to see lots of diplomatic activity and negotiations continuing throughout the year. The question is: What can the convention reasonably accomplish this year? A series of decisions implementing the key elements of the Accord seems probably the most plausible thing; a treaty, much less so. I think this year we can expect the international community to attempt to elaborate some of the elements of the Accord. We can expect also continued dissension, not just from the states that I had mentioned which were being difficult, but also on issues like the continued viability of the Kyoto Protocol and the level of symmetry of obligations between developing and developed countries. Moreover, I think, as Dan mentioned, the United States is going to continue to be pressed on what actions it can really take in the absence of a comprehensive climate law. All of this should culminate in Mexico late this year, but already some countries are showing signs that their real goal is to achieve progress at the next meeting, in South Africa, by 2011. So I guess the best I can say is here we go again. K. Russell LaMotte Thank you, Jeff, for those war stories from the front, which I think raise some questions for all of us about the viability and efficacy of consensus-based, multilateral diplomacy under the UN system. Maybe we can talk about alternative paths that might be available for dealing with some of these issues. But before we do that (or maybe Annie can pick up on that issue during her remarks), let’s shift now to an assessment of where we are and whether Copenhagen was a helpful start, or a hiccup, or something else altogether. Remarks by Ann Petsonk* Thank you, Russ. You asked whether it was a diving catch. I’m going to try to patch something together here, and I may get it wrong, but based on what Dan and Jeff said, I think that President Obama came to Copenhagen and snagged the basketball after there had been a big floor fight over the ball, and he managed to land a shot after a rebound and get a 2-pointer, but that’s only at the half. [Laughter] One of the interesting things about being in the NGO world for me and not being in government any more as I used to be in my career, and not being in the UN Secretariat, which I also was at a certain point—actually, I’ve been working on climate change issues since before the UN Framework Convention, so a long time, almost as long as Dan Bodansky, but not quite—is that I get to hear from different countries their views and concerns in a way that is much more direct and not clouded by the niceties of diplomacy, because when * Of the Environmental Defense Fund. </page> </plain_text>
