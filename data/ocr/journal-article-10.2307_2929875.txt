<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philippe Hamon Rhetorical Status of the Descriptive* We are not claiming to write the exhaustive history of the status of description or of the evolution of the idea of the descriptive in theoretical discourse about literature. We would like simply to point to certain markers and to underline several constant, major principles that can be located by reading the central classical and post-classical works on rhetoric. It is known that Western rhetorical discourse, from the sixteenth to the twentieth century, is characterized by, among other things, its polarization on a certain number of crucial points, weak spots (or strong, as you will), or even blind spots, that have been evaded systematically, or on the contrary that have given rise to wild controversies: the quarrel over catachresis (metaphor, or not?), the synecdoche-metonymy distinction, the status of irony, etc.... one could add the status of description and of the descriptive. It is also known that rhetorical discourse is a) pragmatic, insofar as it aims at direct social effect, from the pulpit, the rostrum or at a meeting; b) pedagogic, because it teaches to acquire the competence needed to speak in public or to communicate in general; c) taxonomic, since it classifies, distinguishes, enumerates, draws up lists of tropes and figures-lists that, it is suggested, are finite; d) normative, insofar as it hierarchizes the procedures registered along a scale of values, according to a series of prescriptions and modulated proscription. Moreover, the domain of rhetorical discourse has not ceased, from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, to restrict itself to tropes, even to some privileged tropes, which would tend to eliminate from its area of concern the pragmatic and illocutionary parameters of Enunciation (memoria, actio are already no longer alive areas of interest in the seventeenth century); and likewise for a *This article is part of a forthcoming book to be published in France: Introduction a l'analyse du texte descriptif, (Hachette, 1980).</page><page sequence="2">Yale French Studies study of the "figures of thought"or of "figures in several words" of the Enonce'. Like a story, for example (the narratio is but a mandatory, precisely located moment of all discourse and not an autonomous entity), like irony or allegory (other examples of extended figures, poorly locatable and poorly definable ones, which have been confused since Quintilian), a description has no genuine status. Though used for definition and qualification, it seems itself to be undefinable. First of all it seems so because it is difficult to attribute to description a semantic status. Unlike tropes a description does not "deviate" from a proper meaning toward a figurative one, from a primary meaning to a secondary one; it does not change normal order into artistic order, nor does it affect [travaille] the signified or the signifier, or even the affective level at the expense of the intellectual level. Bally, for instance (and to cite only him) finds description awkward to handle. "There are expressions that one calls picturesque, without one's being able to say really what the picturesque is.... These expressions do not allow for easy analysis. One often calls them "descriptive." . . . One doesn't know what to say.... One doesn't know what definition to give them. ' In general description is considered but a means among many, notably with etymology, of amplificatio, a general qualitative and quantitative concept that covers all means of "gaining text," of "making text." This term in other theoretical areas (think, for example, of the function of description in the "Nouveau Roman" of the 50's) could have introduced interesting thoughts on the descrip- tive's generative ability, towards a study of "descriptive competence", or of the descriptive as semiologic combinative, as textual expansion, or organizing certain specific linguistic "possibles" (Valery). But this term, amplificatio, in rhetorical discourse, remains a particularly vague concept that even ends up coinciding with the entirety of rhetorical procedures. We can borrow from the great eighteenth century Encyclopidie this "classical" definition of description (from the article entitled "Description" written by Marmontel): IBally, Traiti de stylistique franpaise, (Geneve et Paris, 1951), 3rd ed., vol. I, pp. 183-4. 2</page><page sequence="3">Philippe Hamon Description is a figure of thought by development which, instead of simply indi- cating an object, makes it somehow visible, by the lively and animated exposition of its most interesting properties and circumstances. At best, most treatises are satisfied, on the basis of vague criteria about "contents," with distinguishing types of description according to the characteristics of the described referent: chronography (descrip- tion of time), topography (description of landscapes and places), prosopography (description of the exterior appearance of a character), ethopoeia (moral description of a character), prosopopoeia (descrip- tion of an imaginary or allegorical being), portrait (physical and moral description of a character), parallel (combination of two descriptions, by resemblance or antithesis, of objects or characters), tableau or hypotyposis ("lively and animated" description of actions, passions, physical or moral events). Certain authors, in the chapter on loci, sometimes add the definition and the enumeration of parts, while most of them do not quite know in which chapter to deal with them. Certainly, in Antiquity and up to the Middle Ages, it seems that description, (ekphrasis, descriptio) is part principally of the epideictic genre that requires systematic description, especially in the form of praise of certain individuals, places, times of the year, socially privileged monuments of objects. Description, then, origin- ally, would be closely bound to the Institution, and would always be linked to praise, thanks and acts of grace; it would be therefore a sort of semiological "gift-in-return" [contre-don] in the shape of a text, owed by the community which delegates the descriptor to make it, and returned to some donor of good (King, Nature, God, etc.). Description, in other words, would never be "free"; and we will see in fact that even in the positivistic nineteenth century, there will remain often something of that "praise" or "act of grace" aspect. Certain success-oriented literary genres (idyllic, bucolic. . .) have surely contributed to the tradition of epideictic praise or of the Periegesis 'a la Pausanias, to making stereotypes and to spreading a good number of descriptive topoi, such as the monument, or the locus amoenus, the idyllic location, for instance, whose great perenniality through the Middle Ages and well thereafter was shown by E. R. 3</page><page sequence="4">Yale French Studies Curtius.2 But description seems rather, in general, neither to belong to a particular "genre," not to constitute a neatly definable "figure," nor to be localisable with any certainty at a fixed position in discourse, or at a fixed function: an inconvenience for the Rhetori- cians. It can belong just as well to the judicial genre as to the epideictic genre, to the historian's discourse as to the philosopher's or dramatist's: the requirement of total unity particular to each "style" simply demands global conformity to the "subject" (there is an epic description that is not a bucolic description, a "humilis" style landscape not to be confused with a landscape described in "gravis" style, etc.). The word "description" is often used, as early as the sixteenth century, (but not exclusively) to indicate works that describe certain important cities for architects as well as for tourists, idlers or business people. The chronological and the topographical, as with Pausanias then, meet and mesh in the descriptions of the principal monuments and "antiques" of the area. Like the "monument" it comments upon, description is a memory-storehouse (officina, Tresor), a stock of learning to be reactualized. From Gilles Corrozet (les Antiquite's chroniques et singularite's de Paris, 1561) and Jacques Du Breul (Le The'atre des antiquitc's de Paris, 1612) to the recent Michelin guides, including Germain Brice (Description nouvelle de ce qu'il y a de plus remarquable dans la vile de Paris, 1684), Piganiol de la Force (Description de curiositds des e'glises de Paris, 1759), and the numerous "descriptions de Versailles" of the seventeenth century, description remains secondary to economic ends (guides), to military ends (the geographic description of sites and landscapes is that of potential military fields), to history ("antiques"), to encyclopedic matters, and finally to a number of inter-semiological re-writings; a description is in fact nothing more than the marginal commentary upon an architectural drawing, upon an allegorical print that requires explanation (cf. the illustrated frontispieces of the great didactic pieces of the eighteenth century), upon a map (where the description 2E.

Foucault points out, the separation of observation, of Document and Fable, is not in effect.3 It is always more or less an auxiliary discourse, a place where the inter-semiological gears between two texts, two images, a text and an image are shifted. It must either constitute a painting ("tableau") of itself, or its unique interest must be in enabling a painter (or another artist) to take it as a model to create a painting ("tableau"). H. Blair notes that descrip- tions by great poets "are such that a painter or a sculptor could use them and work with them as models, and this is the true touchstone of real merit of a description. "I Finally, description, in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, is often erotic (blazon of woman's body) or comic (portrait of "villains" in Chretien de Troyes, portrait of Quaresmeprenant in Rabelais) or ludic (picture-poems or riddles); or else it presents itself ostensibly in the line of archaic, homeric catalogues whose distant parody it is-all facts which contribute equally as strongly to marginalize description in the official hierarchy of genres and literary procedures. Catalogue of vessels (Homer), genealogies (nordic sagas), parodic enumeration (in Rabelais, the list of the books in Saint-Victor's library)-all "lists", which appear to us to be more or less foreign bodies; not assimilable; a sort of radically different textual cyst. Philology usually makes of them a questionable area, an area of interpolation (posterior addition, or more archaic element), an area of re-use (borrowing from another text), therefore a variable area intrinsically (a list is interchangeable with other prior or contemporary texts). Double scandle and double stroke, therefore, of the stability of the "enonce". As for the promotion of "view", in its functions of "credibiliza- tion" and homogenization of the text, if it becomes effective as early as the Renaissance, at the heart of a pictorial culture where the work of art becomes scenography, illusionistic mise en scene, perspective, effet de reel, etc. . . ., it does seem that this particular meaning did not receive in texts, in literature nor in normative discourse on 3Michel Foucault, Les Mots et les choses, (Paris, Gallimard, 1967), p. 141. 4H.

According to Lucien Febvre: In the sixteenth century the H6tel Bellevue [-vue: -view] was not born. Neither was H6tel Beausite. They were only to appear during the time of the Romantics.5 To describe is never to describe a reality, but to prove one's rhetorical know-how, to prove one's book-learning, where the "officinae," the "florilegia," the "polyantheae" have already sorted out the first lists of the descriptive, selected works taken from the best authors of Antiquity, and this to pedagogic ends. To describe, then, is a "to describe for"; it is a textual praxis, both coded and aimed, opening onto concrete, practical activities (peda- gogical, military; drawing up lists, taking inventory of a stock, archives); or else it is a working between texts (re-writing, rhetorical models, the description of paintings or figurative works of art); or else it is to work in the realm of the verifiable (a description certified from the witness stand; or the traveler's description); and not in the realm of the probable-credible [vraisemblable] of a fiction-it is therefore not to do literature. Inversely, to do literature will be to avoid, or to detour, or to divide the descriptive. Classical discourse (seventeenth, eighteenth century) on litera- ture, beyond the theological and ideological differences that animate it successively, is constantly suspicious of description and of the descriptive in general. Yet description first appears to polarize most of the concepts and fundamental assumptions which are those of the reigning rhetorical theory: the concept of mimesis, of ornamentation of discourse, of the tonal and structural unity of a work, of topos, of stylistic individuation, the ut pictura poesis, etc., are certainly indispensable, a priori, to think through description and to make of it a privileged area of practice and theory. H. Blair in his 33rd lesson of rhetoric and Belles Lettres writes: 5Lucien Febvre, Le Probkme de l'incroyance au XVIe sikcle; la religion de Rabelais, (Paris, Albin Michel, 1968), p. 403. 6</page><page sequence="7">Philippe Hamon Description is the touchstone of the poet's imagination, and makes it easy to distinguish a genius from a copyist.6 But paradoxically, it is this very over-determination which often seems to hamper and trouble rhetoricians. Besides the traveler's ethnographic discourse, there is one place where description (means of introducing facts that are already proofs and non-ends of discourse) plays its role as expected: that is, in legal discourse. Different treatises either attempt to divide description into its conative functions and into this type of discourse; or they transport into other discourses (theatrical, pedagogical, for example) this same and unique utility function of being means and not end. Still reading various treatises, description seems to be considered in a contradictory manner, either as a negation of literature (it must be left for traveler's writing or for science), or as a sort of figure's hyperbole, discourse ornament's ornament, a sort of superlative process whose excess must be controlled carefully. Wherefrom the mistrust, the number of requirements, not to forget the occasional unabashed condemnations, and the inscription very early on (La Harpe) of eighteenth-century descriptive poetry as among the favorite targets of literary critics (the other target being the Grands Rhetoriqueurs), as a model of everything that should be avoided in matters of Belles Lettres. And it would be interesting to explore this persistent association with the negative: do the Grands Rhetoriqueurs and the descriptive school of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century have something in common, structurally and ideologically, to elicit such resistance? The first gesture of theoreticians, in their treatises, is often to distinguish between description (textual unit or figure among others) and the descriptive, descriptive genre, in order to concentrate their attacks on the second. The article entitled Descriptif, written by Marmontel in the Encyclopidie is interesting on this point. Mar- montel allows for description in the Epic: ("In telling a story, it is natural that the poet describe the location, the time, and the 6Blair, op. cit., vol. IV, p. 14. 7</page><page sequence="8">Yale French Studies circumstances that accompany the action; and the accidents that are mixed in are as much subjects for descriptions."); in the didactic poem: ("the precepts or the advice run on objects that must be exposed"); even in the dramatic poem and in "all the genres analogous to these three primitive genres, in the Elegy, the Ode, the Idyll, the Epistle even [where] the description can find a place." Marmontel, however, severely condemns the uses of description in the realm of the "poetic": That a poem without object, without design be a series of descriptions which brings nothing; that the poet, looking around him, describe everything for the sole pleasure of describing it, if he doesn't get bored himself, he can be assured of boring his readers before long. The pleasure of describing, therefore, is not legitimate in literature. And, in his need to condemn, Marmontel also refers to the absence of auctores, in literary history: What we call today, in Poetry, the descriptive genre was not known by the Ancients. It is a modem invention, of which, it seems to me, neither reason nor taste approves." In Littre's dictionary too, the article entitled Descriptif is, more than the article entitled Description, the place where normalcy is recorded: This word is most often understood pejoratively, because Description is an ornament of discourse and must not be the foundation of a work. One finds same biases in P. Larousse, who hasn't a sufficient amount of disparaging terms to characterize the descriptive poets of the eighteenth century; who also distinguishes between description and the descriptive, the latter being "the monotonous and tiring abuse" of the former; and who holds that descriptive inflation should remain characteristic of non-literary genres, and especially of travel books.7 These judgements, which are repeated from Blair to P. Larousse and well beyond, are already set at the end of the seventeenth century. Boileau's verses on description, in his Art Poitique (1674) are well-known. He too tolerates descriptions; as did Homer in 7Cf. the articles "Descriptif" and "Description" of the Grand Dictionnaire Universel du XIXe sikcle, vol. 6. 8</page><page sequence="9">Philippe Hamon the epic, where description can and must play its decorative and ornamental role to its fullest. Sometimes an Author, fond of his own Thought, Pursues his object till it's over-wrought: If he describes a House he shews the Face, And after walks you round from place to place; Here is Vista, there the Doors unfold, Balcone's here are ballustered with Gold. Then counts the Rounds and Ovals in the Halls, 'The Festoons the Freizes and the Astragals.' Tir'd with his tedious Pomp, away I run, And skip'd over twenty Pages to be gone. Of such Descriptions the vain Folly flee, And shun their barren superfluity. All that is needless ["detail inutile"] carefully avoid.8 Elsewhere than in the epic, this descriptive "pomp" must be prescribed: Be your Narrations lively, short and smart; In your Descriptions show your noblest Art: There it is your Poetry may be employed.9 So description is the center of a triple danger: 1) It might introduce into the text "foreign" vocabularies, namely the specialized terminology of various professions which work on the described object; therefore it might introduce the trace of work into the literary text (here, in Boileau's verses, the lexicon of the work of an architect: baluster, festoon, astragal. . .). Wherefrom, in addition, a problem of readability. 2) Becoming an end and no longer a means, description, by its very inflation, runs the risk of compromising the effectiveness of its proof (if we get into the legal genre-or into all highly "conative" genres), or of compromising the global unity of the work, if we set this description into literary enonces. The term "piece" [morceau] that recurs so often in the writings of the rhetoricians, and the term "detail" (with its necessary qualifier "useless"-causing quasi-redundancy) always carries a negative 8Art Poetique, III, 1. 257-259; [Eng. tr. by Sir William Soames, London, 1710.] 9Ibid., I, 1. 49-60. 9</page><page sequence="10">Yale French Studies charge. Description must always remain "auxiliary" (P. Larousse). 3) The uncontrollable freedom of the descriptive (its emblematic sign could be that of the infinite, "etc.") can work hand in hand with the impossibility of controlling the reader's reactions. Excessive "free- dom," which is symmetrical with the author's amplification licence, runs the risk of being turned over to the reader who then has the choice of absenting himself from the text, of "skipping" it and who will no longer feel ruled and programmed by the very act of reading. Communication then becomes unsure. From Boileau to Valery, there is remarkable continuity on this point. Valery writes: The invasion of Literature by description was parallel to that of painting by landscape. A description is composed of sentences whose order one can generally reverse: I can describe this room by a series of clauses whose order is not impor- tant. A gaze roams as it wishes. Nothing more natural, nothing more true, than this vagrancy; for . . truth is chance. But, if this latitude, and the habit of facility which goes with it, become the dominating factor, it gradually dissuades writers from employing their ability for abstraction, just as it reduces to nothing the slightest necessity for concentration on the reader's part, in order to win him over with immediate effects, rhetorical shock tactics.... This mode of creating, legitimate in principle, and to which we owe so many beautiful things, leads, like the abuse of landscape, to the diminution of the intellectual part of art. '0 And Valery will come back often to this condemnation, to affirm that description "introduces into the execution [of the work] a sort of chance." 1 1 All of classical discourse on description, depending slightly on the epoch, goes through a focusing of the gamut of rules and precepts destined to plot these three dangers. This normativity is assumed, one can see, by a conception of communication (which must be efficient, oriented and controlled); and by a conception of language (transparent and neutralized medium that must exclude the too- specialized ideolects of the vocabulary of work). In addition, there is also the conception of human beings (that is "characters") that must remain the center of the work.

II, p. 1324. 10</page><page sequence="11">Philippe Hamon Now, a comment. The theoretical discussions a propos of the descriptive often evolve around this notion of the "detail." "Hyper- trophy of the real detail" (Zola's expression) can be, nonetheless, momentarily, and in polemic contexts, brought up in the works of certain nineteenth-century novelists (Balzac, Stendhal, Zola . . .) as a theoretical, anti-idealist demand, flag-concept and very basis of the promotion of the new realisms. 12 The "detail"-this is perhaps the only definition one could risk for such a vague notion-is that which over-determines meaning and significance. It is what stops, blocks and suspends the momentum of reading. But it also requests a "translation" as to its meaning, its function in the work; it calls upon and interrogates the reader whom it transforms into an interpreter; it is simultaneously asyndeton and anaphora; in the work of a Spitzer, the "come and go," borrowed from the "philological circle," which moves from the "details" of the work to its "vital center," makes possible the foundation, on a methodological level, of a stylistics and the suggestion of global explanations of the nature of the work. 13 The stylistician, then, does not move from detail to detail, but rather from the particular to the general, and from the general to the particular; which, finally, is perhaps little different than the theoretical rationali- zation of what constitutes on one hand the very movement of any descriptive "enonce" that must maintain the temporality of the description, the semantic function and the declension of a list of words endowed with partial semantic contents and functions (the "parts" of the described "whole"), and on the other hand a rationalization of what constitutes the specific "paranoia" of every realistic "enonce," its hermeneutic obsession of interpreting the signs, the symptoms, the indices of the world (cf. the various physiognomies and semiologies of the nineteenth century). 14 Now, classical theoreticians seem to have seen in description only a risky "drift"' from detail to detail-a process which, above all else, threatens the homogeneity, the cohesion and the dignity of the work.

Naomi Schor, Zola's Crowds, (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1978), pp. 58-59. 11</page><page sequence="12">Yale French Studies For most classical theoreticians, the "detail" first must be reduced, done away with, and then, it must be homogenized, integrated into a series of "equivalent" details-which suspends and annuls its very status of "relief" element. Wherefrom the systematic undertaking to homogenize all of the components of the work, in the classical- "lisible"-descriptive work. For the detail can have the same nasty effect as a "citation"; it is always felt, more or less, as an autonomous or foreign element: an "hors-d'oeuvre" or something imported from an extra-text. From Boileau to Abalat to Lukacs, warnings as regards the "detail" (a concept which is paradoxically never defined) are unanimous; either description, in itself, is considered a "detail" that threatens the integrity of the whole, or it is itself threatened as a functional unity by the "details" which swarm around at its very heart. An internal and external homogeneity is then prescribed for a description. One can therefore predict that, in the classical aesthetic of the descriptive, the "detail," out-of-correlation-with-text-element (and only does effective correlation make sense, give meaning to a unit), will have to be neutralized by a systematic correlation, not only be its insertion into a diachronic system of prospective and retrospec- tive correlations (indices, anticipations, symptoms), but also by its insertion into a synchronic apparatus, or an a-chronic logic; all rhetorical treatises insist on this point: parallelisms and antitheses will absolutely have to come to regulate and diversify simultaneously the fragmentation of the lists and accumulations of the descriptive, whether portraits or landscapes. Wherefrom the "like," "same as," "more than," "less than" which hold up so many classical descrip- tions of the following type: The coastlines of Lake Biena are more wild and romantic than those of Lake Geneva, because the rocks and the woods there line the water from closer; but they are no less smiling. If there are fewer cultivations of land and vineyards, fewer cities and houses, there are also more prairies, shadowy bocages, of more frequent contrasts and of closer chance happenings.... The beautiful basin ... encloses in its center two small islands, one inhabited and cultivated . ., the other smaller, deserted and fallow."'IS '5J. J. Rousseau, "Cinquieme promenade," Les Reveries du promeneur solitaire. Our italics. 12</page><page sequence="13">Philippe Hamon This rhetorical logic, in "scientific" discourse (as that of a Buffon), will become "relationship" ["rapport"]. Descriptions, "embellishments destined to retain one's attention" (Description article of the Encyclopjdie), in the normative discourse of classical rhetoric, should never constitute the aim of discourse, but must remain a "subordinate means" (the expression is Lukacs' in "Raconter et decrire," a text which is surprisingly close to Mar- montel's in many ways). Let this subordination be at the service of instances external to the discourse (any practical aim, an auditor to convince, a scholarly text to constitute), or of instances internal to the discourse (a coherence, a hierarchy, an anaphoric chain, a "logic," a narrative lisibilit! to insure). In short, description must not be digression, "hors-d'oeuvre." The term "frame" (as opposed to the subject of the work) that often metaphorically designates description, within the larger general metaphor ut pictura poesis, signifies these decorative, and accessory functions that theory assigns to description. And, particularly, description must (as all other components of discourse) remain subordinate to the highest hierarchical instances of discourse, to the narration [Recit] on one hand, and on the other to the highest existing subject, the Subject, the human being. Description, in the logical and philosophical foundation the rhetoricians attribute to it (this is then a sort of Definition), as well as in the poetic functions they assigned it, is a discourse that caters to individuality, to personality. One can easily understand then that it be more or less explicitly at stake in debates, in exclusions, and in haughty prescrip- tions. The Abbe Mallet writes, for the Encyclopidie's article Descrip- tion: "Description principally serves to introduce individuals and singulars." An ethics here underlies an aesthetics; the Rhetorics are usually more wordy when they enumerate the "circumstances of persons" than when they enumerate the "circumstances of things." It wouldn't therefore be so much at the service of a semiological construction (a recit, a narrative structure) that a description must be; rather it must cater to an ideological given, a person, an individual. Linguistic characterization and character must be interdependent. Rhetorical discourse, from the seventeenth to the twentieth century, is remarkably constant and homogeneous on this point. More 13</page><page sequence="14">Yale French Studies precisely, in reading the prescriptions of the treatises, one notices that the subordination of the descriptive to the "human" passes through triple instructions and operates on several levels: a) A description must reflect a "passion" (the Encyclopidie), an artist's personality, who has a particular "design" or an "ideal" (Brunetiere) -a "design" that must strike the reader. Thus the choice and the distribution of details must be manifest in the description. b) A description must be taken on, on the text's very stage, by a character, be "brought on" (Marmontel's "amenee") by a narration, and be "animated" by a character participating in the story. c) A description must serve the composition, the "lisibiliti" of a "character," there- fore also the global "lisibilite" of the cast of characters of the work, that is the coherence of the work. The various rhetorical schools, classical, neo-classical or romantic, will insist on one or the other of these points. Saint-Lambert, in the "Discours prdiminaire" to his Saisons, writes: One must match episodes to landscapes. There is an analogy between our situations, the state of our soul, and the sites, phenomena, the states of Nature. Place a poor person in a landscape spiked with rocks, in dark forests, near waterfalls, etc....; these horrors will create an impression that will mix with one of pity. Place two young lovers beneath a smiling cradle.... There are other analogies, but they will be obvious to everyone, and it is sufficient to indicate this hidden source of new beauty. One can see here the sketching of the coordination of character/back- ground/reader; description becoming a sort of tonal operator (posi- tive or negative, very or not at all euphorizing), orienting the consumption of the text by the reader, amidst a global aesthetics of homogeneity (this characteristic of the work threatens precisely the irregular "details"), and of "lisibilite." In most theoretical texts, the terms "animation" and "dramatiza- tion" of a description recur most frequently: Animation . . . is an essential condition of all somewhat extended descriptions. One makes a tableau interesting if one introduces into it beings and characters that give it something of their movement and life. 16 '6Ch. Leroy, Etudes sur la narration, ou traits de littirature a I'usage des ekves d'Humanite's et des classes de franfais (Paris, Berlin, 4th ed., 1847, p. 168). 14</page><page sequence="15">Philippe Hamon So writes Charles Leroy in the nineteenth century. His contemporary, A. Baron, also insists greatly on the necessity of "good descrip- tions": The last quality [of descriptions I, the most important, is the art of dramatizing, of impassioning the description. It corresponds to the interest of narration. In order to obtain this, the writer must attach descriptions to the hero of the poem, of the play, novel or discourse by the harmony that he establishes between external nature and the emotions that animate them; or to the reader, putting the action in the reader by awakening the human emotions (to make the reader share or at least understand them), by making a normal element penetrate into the physical objects. Without [this] . . ., descriptive poetry, however brilliant it may be, becomes a permanently plastic work. 17 The fact that the ut pictura poesis doctrine, although mishandled by Lessing in Laokoon (1766), continues to be reiterated in classical and post-classical discourse, is not in contradiction with the suspicion in which description is locked, or with the well-defined functions that we assign to it in narration: a necessary reference point, painting itself remains dominated, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by certain "great" genres, religious painting, historical painting, allegorical painting, all highly narrative, pictorial genres (a painting narrates itself as well in Poussin's practice as in the descriptions of a tableau of Diderot's) and all highly focused on anthropomorphic bases of representation (the hero; the Saint; the prince). Paintings without characters, a country-side (Valenciennes) or a still life (Chardin) have long remained minor genres, or confidential ones: travel notes that stay in the painter's diary, workshop sketches, studies anticipating some great masterpiece, decorative paintings- all are always subordinate to a highly anthropocentric aesthetics, not to speak of a ritualized technique (students doing the background while the professor takes care of painting the characters). Finally, let us note that, when Description is not dependent upon other levels or units inside the text, and when it is compared (rather than contrasted) to other textual procedures, it is always to its disadvantage. Here again, we find the implicit division and hier- archization of genres and discourses. When description is compared '7A.

Therefore it is doubly penalized and blamable: first of all as imperfect and owing with respect to a perfect model; and secondly, as the intrusion in the literary text of a procedure belonging to a foreign and non-literary discourse, that of science, philosophy or logic. Let us look again at the article Description in l'Encyclopidie: An imperfect and imprecise definition in which one tries to communicate one thing by a few particular characteristics and circumstances, sufficient to give an idea of it and to distinguish it from others, but which develops neither its nature nor its essence. Grammarians are satisfied with Descriptions, philosophers want definitions. . . . A description, at first glance, resembles a definition; it is convertible with the described thing; but it does not allow one to know it fully, because it does not enclose, nor does it exhibit the essential attributes.... Genius, taste, passion guide a paintbrush for a description; reason alone and thought decide the lines which must enter in a definition. Beauzee, who participated in the composition of both articles, Description and Dc'finition writes in the latter one: abridged and precise exposition of the system of our knowledge relative to a defined object [which must be] ... the reasoned result of combined depositions of experience. Then he opposes the orator's description to the rhetorician's defini- tion. Marmontel, in taking up Beauzee's article, opposes to the variability of procedures for description, the "invariance" and the independence of real definition with regard to the particular and the instantaneous. We know that the status of a unit or a concept, whatever it may be, in a discourse on literature, is inseparable from the institutional- ized modes of reference to a corpus of earlier texts, the auctores, the authors of classics. The modification of the corpus of models and the modification of theoretical status always go hand in hand. As far as the description is concerned, one notes that the prescriptions are often centered around a privileged and prestigious model: Homer. For most theoreticians of description, the only "good" description is Homeric-and the principle is repeated to a point of saturation from Ronsard to Albalat. Certainly, for many, this reference to Homer is 16</page><page sequence="17">Philippe Hamon little more than a ritualistic reference to the great ancestor, to the model of models in literature. But for some, those more attentive to the stylistic specificity of texts, Homeric description possesses traits that are characteristic of itself. According to the fine analysis given of it by Lessing in Laokoon, it is a "dramatized" description, a narration-description, where the simultaneous givens of the real or the elements accumulated from a nomenclatural travel, take place on the text's stage, with a movement of characters, that takes charge of them in a "natural" successivity of a motivated prescription. This con- sists for example in the fact that, instead of listing immediately the dif- ferent parts of a warrior's armament, the author introduces us to this warrior as he gathers his equipment before leaving to fight-thereby successively putting on the different parts of his armament, that is dressing himself in the "natural" order (the shoulder belt for example would come after the breast-plate). Thus the technical nomenclature is "naturalized" according to a verisimilitude: the "average" manner of dressing oneself-with which any average reader is familiar; as such the ornamental aspect of the descriptive is integrated into the finality of the narration; thus the paradigmatic aspect of the list becomes one with the syntagmatic aspect of the narration, the derivational into the transformational. When neutralized, description is integrated into the very movement of the reading time and the time of the adventure. It seems that description begins to reach a "normal" literary status at the turning point of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This is certainly somewhat delayed, with respect to the importance taken by description in certain different areas of knowledge born in the eighteenth century (natural history, for example). It would be interesting, for that matter, to study the influence of rhetorical precepts dealing with description, with their necessary topical para- meters (location, time, opposites, similarities, etc.) on scientific description at the time, and its "feedback" on romantic and pre- romantic descriptive literature. Someone like Buffon, a man of style and a man of science, who will become, thanks to his descriptions, a great source of selected "pieces" [morceaux choisis] of the nineteenth century, is perhaps at the intersection of these reciprocal influences. 17</page><page sequence="18">Yale French Studies Thus, when Buffon defines description, the textual procedure which is at once the means and the end of his discipline, he deliberately sets the (hi)story as dependent upon description, inverting in that way a hierarchy which had authority; still he conserves the same prejudice for small detail and the global anthropomorphic dependence on description: The exact description and the faithful history of each thing is, as we have said, the sole aim we must have first. In description, one must let form, greatness, weight, colors, situations of rest and movement, positions of parts, their relations, their faces, their actions and all the exterior funcions enter; if one can add to all that the exposition of the interior parts, the description will be more complete for it; only one must be careful not to fall into too many small details or to linger excessively on some unimportant part of the description and to treat too lightly the essential or principal things. This history must follow the description and must call on the relationships that natural things have among themselves and with us.'8 M. Foucault, in the chapter entitled "Classer" of Les Mots et les Choses summarizes the classical "taxonomic" epistime of the seven- teenth century in the following manner: The organization of a certain visible existence as a domain of knowledge, the definition of the four variables of description, the constitution of an area of adjacencies in which any individual being whatever can find its place. Natural history in the Classical Age is not merely the discovery of a new object of curiosity; it covers a series of complex operations that introduce the possibility of a constant order into a totality of representations. It constitutes a whole domain of empiricity at the same time describable and orderable. "'9 This epistime', according to M. Foucault, manipulates four major descriptive types (mostly in the sciences of Nature): This object is the extension of which all natural beings are constituted-an extension that may be affected by four variables. And by four variables only: the form of the elements, the quantity of those elements, the manner in which they are distributed in space in relation to each other, and the relative magnitude of each element. 20 '8Buffon, Histoire Naturelle, first discourse, cited by E.

The critical thought of a Lessing on the presuppositions of the ut pictura poesis; the "excesses" and "abuses," but also the innovating textual experience, of the descriptive genre (Delille); the making of the novel as the great, serious, realist prose genre (Auerbach); the emergence of literature as a specific absolute value; the apparition of the prose poem and a conception of poetry as other than rhymed; the acceptance of the "place," the "detail," the "thing seen" (Hugo) as a self-sufficient work of literature; the increase in trips and the creation of "sites" (listed and ranked in tourist guides, cultural objects to visit, Baedeker in hand)-all this has no doubt contributed, since the end of the eighteenth century, to the modification of certain theoretical attributes or habits with respect to description. Theoreticians and critics, very timidly, correct and adjust their positions, especially after the appearance of important writers. A. Baron notes, in De la rhitorique, ou de la composition oratoire et littiraire, which we quoted earlier: Most of the Rhetorics do not insist enough upon description; that's a mistake. Description almost inevitably comes into any work. Allegory, comparison, metaphors even, and most figures are only descriptions, more or less extended.2' F. Wey before him, in Remarques sur la langue franpaise, 22 borrows H. Blair's formula-the "touchstone" of the writer's genius-and allocates to this study long pages entitled "On the Search for Details," "On Descriptions," "On Displaced Digressions," "On 2'Baron, op. cit., p. 180. 22F.

Hugo, Gautier, Balzac, Chateau- briand are often cited with praise and Francis Wey is rather strict when it comes to the principal stylistic characteristics of classical description, (necessary epithets, periphrases, etc.), which he doesn't hesitate to condemn even in the most respected classical authors (Racine, Voltaire . . .) thereby displacing the normative cut within the descriptive, instead of globally excluding the latter: this is so even if, sometimes, the recuperation of the descriptive must be accompanied by a certain extension or dissolution of the descriptive -elevated to the level of universal figure: Nearly all figures are disguised descriptions; all allegory, metaphors even, is a brief description; he who knows not how to describe cannot write ["d&amp;rire"/ &amp;crire"]. The poetic imagination manifests itself by the multiplicity of images; to describe is to paint and to paint is to form images.24 But these readjustments of the attitudes of some critics and rhetoricians, rather timid readjustments, are perhaps mostly due to two factors that modify the total ideological camp of the nineteenth century, especially in its second half. First of all, due to certain modifications that affect the area of education: the fact that descrip- tion is par excellence a relatively autonomous "piece," and an easily detachable one at that, makes of it a privileged element for the pedagogical practice of "explication de texte"-a practice that was organized at the time of the spread of public instruction. This promotion of description as a "selected piece" is no doubt due to the fact that it makes up a textual unity that is easily recordable, stockable in anthologies, readily usable for an exam question; in short it is a privileged sample for the learning of homogenous layers of "vocabulary." To a certain extent, description as detachable morceau choisi replaces the exemplum, narrative morceau choisi that was also easily detachable and ready for study. On the other hand, new values (notably that of the work [travail] of the writer on language) are reaching a particularly privileged status in literary 23Ibid., p. 374 if., 391-440, 489 if., 624 if. 24Ibid., p. 404. 20</page><page sequence="21">Philippe Hamon theory. The "pomp" of description, which Boileau categorized in the epic, or the descriptive "luxury" so strongly condemned by a certain Lamy for moral reasons, become stylistic know-how and total artistic value. Better yet: a particular "work" on description becomes a proper means of neutralizing the prosaic quality and the always-a- bit material-not to say "vulgar"-side of the referential function. We know that this reproach has been addressed particularly to "realist" authors like Balzac and Zola who were reproached by official criticism precisely for their "lack of style." According to Lanson, work on the materiality of the signifier "devulgarizes" the very prosaicness of description. In this way, description can con- tribute to its own repentance and not fall back into the "excesses" of "the imitative harmony," also a textual practice, severely controlled by the normative discourse on literature. We know that someone like Flaubert, who is rapidly becoming a classic at this time, contributed quite a bit to the promotion of this eminently bourgeois value to the rank of ultimate, sacred aesthetic value. Now, description is the place in the text where the work manifests itself triply: 1) manifestation of the lexicon of a work, of a profession (the architect's lexicon in the description of a house, for instance); 2) manifestation of work on the lexicon (ostentation of a certain linguistic know-how, rare objectives, descriptive metaphors, etc.); 3) place of reminder of general work on the world, knowledge, classification, Mathesis. Wherefrom the importance of a Buffon, once again, as a privileged author for morceaux choisis, since he seems to synthesize in an exemplary manner a certain number of those values (style, knowledge, taxonomic undertaking, pedagogic clarity, work); and the privileged fixation of critics and manuscripts of descriptions-the description often being the place in the text where the "work" of the author is most visibly manifest. Nevertheless, even in the nineteenth century, one notices that feelings as regards description remain very strong. The articles Description and Descriptif of the Grand Dictionnaire (Pierre Larousse) are not fundamentally different, as we've seen, from the articles of the Encyclope'die of the eighteenth century. Flaubert, for example, manages sometimes to put the descriptive, or at least a certain 21</page><page sequence="22">Yale French Studies descriptive, at a slight ironic distance. Thus of Emma: "She studied, in Eugene Sue, descriptions of furniture." Moreover des- cription, if it is beginning to be accepted by prose writers, seems still to be condemned in "poetry," and to be in absolute and radical discordance with poetic qualities and spirit in general. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the conception of the work [oeuvre], as a) closed entity (description threatened its coherence); b) a hierarchy (description had to be at the narration's and hero's ser- vice); and c) a general theory of genres (difficulty in situating a descrip- tive genre in poetry; conception of description as "imperfect definition"; categorizing of description in non-literary genres) this conception of the work was a special justification of the severity towards description. In the nineteenth century, discussions are often oriented by the will or the refusal to reconcile on one hand a conception of the work which stays classic in large part (notions of coherence and global organization remain privileged; hierarchically, the character must surpass description-description must remain at the service of the character) and on the other hand, the influence of non-literary theories (sociological, biological, anthropological, etc.) that affirm that the individual is subject to dependence on its environment. Someone like Zola, for instance, will try perpetually to synthesize these two sets of theoretical presuppositions, the two modes of causality, one aesthetic, the other anthropological. In an article dated 1880 and entitled De la description, Zola sketches a brief historical study of the descriptive genre, and especially justifies himself for having made "scientific use," as does a "scientist," of description, after the "descriptive orgies" of Romanticism. One can note here in passing the use of an aggressive vocabulary that one must restore to the anti-idealist polemics of the time. It is no longer Homer who becomes the obligatory reference, but Flaubert ("it is in Gustave Flaubert that I suggest one study description"); and the references to music, an "abstract" art, is available to supplant references to painting, as we can notice from Zola's defense of the five descriptions (perhaps initiated by "means too stiff and too symmetrical") of his novel Une page d'amour: In what we name our fury of description, we never yield to the sole need 22</page><page sequence="23">Philippe Hamon of describing; this is complicated within us by symphonic and human in- tentions.25 Incidentally, reading Zola's instructions to himself while preparing the "Ebauches" and the "Plans" of his novels, one notices that Zola, perpetually and in vain, tries not to succumb to the descriptive "sin" (it's the closing word of his 1880 article)-which shows the culpabili- zation linked by classical theoretical discourse on description to that textual practice. In the nineteenth century, it is always the "charac- ter" who stays at the center of discussion, as part of three problematics: the problematic of the internal semiotics of the work (it's the unfinished novel as collection of "documents" on the milieu which suggests the plot and the idea of the novelist's novel personnel; symmetrically, in the finished work, it is the personnel which will return the document), the anthropological-sociological problematic (the individual is determined by the environment), and the aesthetico- ideological problematic (the description of the milieu is at the service of the character) overdetermining each other inextricably. When the official criticism did not accuse realist and naturalist authors of displaying misplaced foreign and second-hand erudition in their descriptions, it is always on the focal question of the character, in his relationship to the descriptive, that most critical topoi are concen- trated-description's inflation not being able to occur only at the expense of the character. But description, whether attacked or defended, will always be defined referentially by what it describes, notably as the description of "physical" objects as opposed to "actions" or "feelings" of "living" characters; that is, always as a materialism as opposed to a moral. Hence the systematic effort of a Stendhal "to elude the official descriptive report" to the benefit of the study of the "moral" qualities of his characters;26 hence, also, Brunetiere's violent attacks against the absence of "psychology," against "simplification," the "schematism" of the characters in Zola; the scruples of Flaubert who asks himself, in a letter to Sainte-Beuve (December 1862), about Salammbo if: "the pedestal [i.e.: the 25Zola, "De la description", O.C. vol. x, p. 1298. 26G. Blin, Stendhal et le probleme du roman, (Paris, Corti, 1954), p. 48. 23</page><page sequence="24">Yale French Studies description] [is not] too big for the statue [i.e.: the character].27 And let's remember that the great pictorial battles, at the middle and the end of the century, since the "Manet affair," centered on the reproach, made to the "impressionist," then to "neo-impressionist" painters, that the character is dissolved into the backgrounds of the painting or that the character is assimilated, as a purely "decorative" motif, to the painted surface. The term "decorative," a term of that era, is interesting because of its ambivalence in critical discourse where it is sometimes positive ("decorative" unity, "decorative" motif, are functional elements of a coherent, global system, freed from the anecdote or story), and sometimes negative (it is then synonymous with "pretty" or with accompanying art of an everyday object or of a dwelling). The passage of description from the status of "frame," of "decor" (subordinated to more important textual features) to a "decorative" status, in the positive sense, is perhaps the first condition for description to be recognized as a specific textual technique. A certain type of nouveau roman will speak specifically for this, especially between 1950-1960 when it fights polemically for its own identity: description becomes a decorative system, a motor for generating text, and the means of eliminating certain values which we judge to be outdated. As Robbe-Grillet writes: To limit oneself to description is of course to take exception to all other ways of approaching an object: sympathy as unreal, tragedy as alienating, compre- hension as stemming from the sole area of science. . . The whole interest of these descriptive pages-that is the place of man in these pages-is then not the thing described, but in the very movement of the description.28 Once again, this quick survey of certain manuals and critical discourses did not try to lead an exhaustive study of the concept of the descriptive over the centuries. Such a study would require other 27Letter published in Anthologie des Prefaces de romans franpais du XIXe sikcle, (Paris, Julliard, 1944), p. 205 ff. 28A. Robbe-Grillet, Pour un nouveau roman, (Paris, Gallimard, collection "IdWes", 1964), pp. 78-79. 24</page><page sequence="25">Philippe Hamon dimensions, other types of research and other competences than ours. Nor have we aimed to read these texts normatively, to show their crumbling, archaic or naive side and to prepare some definition to the descriptive which would fill in the empty (or badly filled) slots among the taxonomic slots of rhetoric. We do not think it is very interesting simply to rearrange the grids of rhetoric. It is with points of theoretical and ideological fixation found in the classical discourse on the descriptive that we have dealt: (the notion of "detail," the anthropocentric notion of description, description as "imperfect" definition, etc. We have also wanted to record certain constants, the most important of which seems to us to be this "mistrust" of a "unit(y)" (the description) or of a project (the descriptive)- constants that, paradoxically, critical theory has not investigated precisely. And it is remarkable to see that, even when the concepts of work, of language, of human beings and of literary communication change, the same arguments persist in buttressing this mistrust. One pleasure of the descriptive, the pleasure of producing it and the pleasure of consuming it, seems excluded by normative discourses on description. Description, as usual, appears as a threatening area: the "useless detail" (Boileau), the variable and the chancy (Valery), the excess of "luxury" (Lamy), the infinite proliferation and the amplifi- cation of lexical material, the "skipping" of the reader, the reader's boredom, aesthetic heterogeneity, the excesses of erudition, the intrusion of work, etc. All contribute to the fact that description might be that place in the text where the generative power of language might show itself most clearly and as quite unmanageable. Which might explain why the descriptive,-whether as goal or category (in persuading-conative discourses), expelled from the realm of the poetic (and reserved for the didactic realm) or marginalized (blazon of a body, Rabelaisian catalogue), subordin- ated to the "important" anthropomorphic instances of the narration, or reserved for "boring" discourses (the discourse of knowledge, of science)-why the descriptive seems to be only partially accepted in the realm of discourse on literature. To map out a theory of the descriptive would be therefore to avoid localising it as an anterior practice (the "documents" collected 25</page><page sequence="26">Yale French Studies before writing) or reducing it to its transitivity by labelling it in such a way as to put it perpetually at the service of hierarchically superior instances of narration. All this perhaps while taking into account more "exotic" modes of literature ("hai-ku"; tanka; epic catalogues, for example), or more contemporary literature (Ponge; a certain nouveau roman; prose poetry) where the descriptive is no longer thought of as in the realm of and at the service of a larger, "englobing" narrative. translated by Patricia Baudoin 26</page></plain_text>
