<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Concept of Method. By GERHARD K. LOMER. New York, Teachers College, Columbia University, Contributions to Education, No. 34, I9IO. -PP. 99. This study is distinguished from the numerous discussions of special problems in education by its surprising breadth of theme: it is an attempt to analyze the process of experience as a whole by the aid of typical historical analyses as well as by systematic investigation, also in the course of the metaphysical inquiry to develop a philosophical definition of education. Although occa- sionally suggestive, the work is not scholarly, either in form or substance. In the first place, it lacks mechanical accuracy: there are typographical errors in spelling on pp. 65, 76, 83; in punctuation on p. 5; and the punctuation is erratic in several places. Some sentences are badly constructed, many are vague. Also the connections between sentence and sentence, paragraph and paragraph, chapter and chapter, are sometimes not sufficiently explicit. Turning to the more conscious method of the thesis, one observes an entire absence of references to authorities. There is at times a conspicuous inade- quacy of treatment, e. g., when Kant's theories of epistemology, ethics, and education are outlined in less than six pages (pp. 4I-47). It is true that in a work of such scope the omission of detail is permissible, but scarcely vagueness and inaccuracy. There is little value, for instance, in a historical account which comes to this: 'The problem of Bacon and of Descartes had been the examination of experience and the discovery of knowledge' (p. 4I). One philosophical system is said to be implicit in or to resemble another on the basis of a very general similarity. If, as the author says, Plato's conception of the world 'implicitly underlies the later investigations of Bacon' (p. i9), the resemblance is not inevitable or even striking, and Comenius is related to many beside Bacon in the 'universality of his aim' (p. 40). The systematic half of the thesis contains three chapters entitled respectively, The Idea of Develop- ment, The Interpretation of Experience, and The Function of Method. In the first the author defines evolution as universal experience, or causation in</page><page sequence="2">566 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXII. activity; it is the whole of reality moving toward the fulfilment of a purpose. Perhaps this attempt to explain a universal standpoint which has no par- ticular bearings may account for the confusion of the reader. The second is more intelligible. The experience both of the individual and of society is analyzed into three phases,-existence, potentiality, and activity. In the passage from phase to phase problems arise, and for the solution of these we need standards, or principles of activity. The conscious demand for standards implies a recognition of ideals; but the true end of existence can be understood only from a 'cosmic point of view' (p. 77). Apparently the only alternative in the author's mind for a crude anthropomorphism is an entire abandonment of any human point of view; he does not acknowledge, it would seem, the adequacy of a teleology at once relative to human purposes and objectively determined. In the last chapter the author very properly insists upon the organic relationship of theory and practice; of genesis and end; of the real and ideal. All partial views are combined in the 'functional point of view.' Education is the interaction of the reality-the child, seeking idealization, and social ideals seeking realization.
