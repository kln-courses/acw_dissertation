ROBERT J. O'CONNELL, S.J. ST. AUGUSTINE'S EARLY THEORY OF MAN, A.D. 386-391 During the period before his ordination to the priesthood, Augustine developed a perception of Christianity based on the notion of man as a "fallen soul." Father O'Connell demon- strates that Augustine found the most comprehensive framework for this concept in the Enneads, and that Plotinian Neoplato- nism influenced all his early writings. A Belknap Press Book. $10.00 ST. AUGUSTINE'S CONFESSIONS The Odyssey of Soul In this study, the author contends that a Plotinian world-view unifies the three sections of the Confessions. The episodes Augustine includes, his language, his reflections-all these ele- ments help portray St. Augustine's own life as a mirror in which the reader can recognize his own identity as a fallen soul.

In this biography he extends our understanding of the personality and work of the man he has characterized as "essentially a reformer whose ideal was the pure church." Since 1915, the date of the last similar study of Hus, a great deal of new information has become available, especially in the Czech language. Professor Spinka has based his study on these new materials and on critical works about Hus. He has also abstracted Hus' writings, in Latin and in Czech, thereby clari- fying what Hus taught. $12.50 Princeton University Press Princeton, New Jersey 08540 .?.?;:?????:?:?:?:c?~;?:~.:~I?.'??;;?:r? 1~2;~;~?~:?.:6.t"c.:~i~i~i ~i "? ~52~: ~ ~i~i~i ~: :I ":~it~c:~: ..? ii:: ~ii~~-t:; ''~j:~i~?~''?:i!~.j::~::: ?:?~:~:?:?:?:~:???:?:j~;:;I:?~?:?: ~ ~i~ :I~~ 8;~ ~ic~iii~ " ~~t:~ Cornell University Press Studies in Religious Philosophy and Mysticism By ALEXANDER ALTMANN This selection of essays brings together in a single volume the writings of an eminent historian of religious philosophy.

Rather than offering a manual or a history of ancient Christian iconography, he cites the most characteristic examples, dwelling on their nature, form, and content. The limits of original- ity in such art, the profound influence of figurative art and the whole climate of culture in the Roman Empire, and the distinction that must be made between informative images and expressive images, are subjects of the author's chief concern. Andre Grabar, professor of art in the Sorbonne, is the author of many works on early Christian, Byzantine, and Slavic art. The A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts.

In the light of contemporary experience and knowledge, Royce reinterpreted three ideas basic to Christianity: those of "community," of sin, and of "atonement." Philosophi- cally, the work is important for its use of Peirce's theory of signs and interpreta- tion for recasting Christian ideas. Theologically, it is revolutionary in its treatment of the Holy Spirit. 1968 LC:68-16716 412 pages, $10.00 A Manual of Style Revised Edition For Authors, Editors, and Copywriters Prepared by the Editorial Staff of The University of Chicago Press For more than sixty years the Manual of Style has been the standard tool of au- thors, editors, advertisers, typographers, printers, and proofreaders for preparing and editing copy.
