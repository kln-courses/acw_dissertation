Childhood Exposure to Ionizing Radiation to the Head and Risk of Schizophrenia. Radiât Res. 176, 670-677 (2011). While the association between exposure to ionizing radiation and cancer is well established, its association with schizophrenia is unclear. The aim of our study was to assess risk of schizophrenia after childhood exposure to ionizing radiation to the head (mean dose: 1.5 Gy). The study population included an exposed group of 10,834 individuals irradiated during childhood for treatment of tinea capi tis in the 1950s and two unexposed comparison groups of 5392 siblings and 10,834 subjects derived from the National Population Registry individually matched to the exposed group by age, sex (when possible), country of birth, and year of immigration to Israel. These groups were followed for a median 46 years for diagnosis of schizophre- nia updated to December 2002. The Cox proportional hazards model stratified by matched sets was used to compare the risk of schizophrenia between the groups. Based on 1,217,531 person-years of follow-up, 451 cases were identified. No statistically significant association was found between radiation exposure and schizophrenia for the total group (hazard ratio per 1 Gy to the brain: 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.93-1.18) or within subgroups of sex, dose categories or latent period. When comparing a subgroup of subjects irradiated under 5 years of age with the matched unexposed group, the estimated hazard ratio reached 1.18 (95% confidence interval: 0.96-1.44; P = 0.1). The results of our analysis do not support an association between exposure to ionizing radiation and risk of schizophrenia.

While family history of the disease is the most established risk factor (3), the population attributable risk for a history of schizophrenia in a parent or sibling has been reported to be only 5.5% (5). Many researchers hypothesize that schizophrenia may be related to an insult to the developing and maturing brain, a process that spans from early fetal stages through the first two decades of life. Environmental factors such as migration (associated with stress caused by an unfamiliar social environment, social fragmentation, discrimination and marginalization) (6), being born or raised in an urban environment, prenatal malnutrition, and maternal infection during pregnancy have been shown to be associated with risk of this disorder (1-3). Over the past 50 years, the role of ionizing radiation in the development of cancer has been well established (7-77), but its effects on other types of morbidity have not been demonstrated consistently (72). An important research question that has arisen concerns the possible effects of radiation on brain tissue, which may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Inconclusive results on the risk of schizophrenia associ- ated with exposure to radiation were reported in studies of subjects exposed prenatally to atomic bomb radiation (13), radiotherapy for childhood cancer (14), and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident (75). A biological mechanism that has been proposed for this possible association is left 670</page><page sequence="2">IONIZING RADIATION AND RISK OF SCHIZOPHRENIA 671 frontotemporal limbic dysfunction caused by the radiation (15). An opportunity to further explore the effects of ionizing radiation on brain tissue arose in Israel, where approximately 20,000 children were treated with radiotherapy to the area of the head for tinea capitis (a benign fungal disease of the scalp) in the 1950s. In 1968, a comprehensive follow-up of a cohort comprising irradiated individuals and two comparison groups (the tinea capitis cohort) was initiated to determine possible delayed radiation effects (76). One early study on this cohort, updated to 1973, that assessed the effects of radiation on mental function concluded that irradiation of the immature brain may cause damage to the nervous system (17). In light of the increasing exposure to radiation that occurs today during diagnostic imaging procedures using moderate levels of radiation (especially computed tomography), information about the relationship of radiation dose and schizophrenia may have practical implications. Because the impact of schizophrenia on public health is considered to be substantial, due to the great social and financial burdens, as well as immense pain and suffering on the individual level (18), investigation of the risk factors for this disease could contribute to its prevention. The aim of the present study was to assess the possible association between childhood exposure of the head to ionizing radiation and risk of schizophrenia based on the median follow-up period of 46 years of the tinea capitis cohort. Investigation of the roles of age at time of exposure, sex, dose and latent period, in the association was included in the analysis. METHODS AND MATERIALS Study Population The tinea capitis cohort included 10,834 Jewish subjects irradiated for tinea capitis in Israel, 10,834 nonirradiated subjects derived from the National Population Registry and individually matched to the exposed subjects by age (±2 years), sex, country of birth, and year of immigration to Israel and 5392 nonirradiated siblings of the irradiated subjects matched to the exposed group for sex (when possible), age, country of birth, and year of immigration. Tinea capitis is an infectious and contagious disease, and several family members often developed it and were treated with radiotherapy. Therefore, unexposed siblings were found for only about 50% of the irradiated subjects, and broader age categories (±5 years) were defined for matching. Furthermore, for 36% of the exposed subjects with siblings, matching for sex could not be achieved. Additional information on the study population can be found in previous publications about this cohort (10, 16, 19). Information available for all cohort members included demographic variables (date of birth, sex, country of origin, date of immigration), date of first irradiation, center where irradiation was performed, number of irradiations, individual dose per anatomical site, vital status and date of death, when relevant. Exposure Assessment The treatment involved application of the Adamson-Kienbock technique, which included shaving of the hair and removal of remaining hair using a waxing procedure. The scalp area was then divided into five fields, each treated on one of 5 consecutive days. Irradiation was performed with a 75-100 kV superficial therapy X-ray machine. The air exposure at a focused skin distance of 25-30 cm ranged between 350-400 R per field according to age. The majority of patients received one course of therapy; approximately 9% underwent two or more courses. In the 1960s, dosimetry was estimated retrospectively using one of the original X-ray machines and a specially designed head phantom of a skull of a 7-year-old child over which a layer of tissue-equivalent material was molded under conditions identical to those during treatment. Doses absorbed by the brain were measured with the aid of ionization chambers. The results were presented as doses absorbed at several grid points inside the phantom head in two horizontal layers 2.5 cm apart (20). In the 1980s, doses to the brain for individual patients were calculated. These estimations were based on measure- ments made on an anthropomorphic phantom, the prescribed medical center-specific exposure technique, the number of treatment courses, and age at the time of treatment (19, 21). The median average dose to the brain for all irradiated individuals was 1.4 Gy. Ascertainment of Schizophrenia Cases In Israel, reporting of psychiatric hospitalizations by all mental health facilities in the country, including day hospitals and psychiatric units in general medical centers, is required by a "Treatment of Mentally 111" Law, which was established in 1955 and updated in 1991 (22). The National Psychiatric Hospitalization Case Registry includes the International Classification of Disease (ICD)-IO diagnoses assigned by a board-certified psychiatrist at each facility. Diagnoses recorded in earlier ICD codes are routinely upgraded by the registry. The reports include demographic data and admission and discharge diagnoses. Because of the universal health insurance in Israel, the population has equal access to inpatient psychiatric services, and approximately 90% of schizophrenia patients are hospitalized at some point (23). The tinea capitis cohort file was linked with this registry to ascertain cases discharged with the ICD- 10 F20 code for schizophrenia through December 31, 2002. For each individual, dates of admission and discharge for each hospitalization were obtained. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University, New York. Statistical Analysis The period of observation for the irradiated subjects began on the date of irradiation and for nonirradiated subjects on the date of exposure of their matched pair. The end of follow-up was defined as the date of first psychiatric admission (considered a proxy of clinical onset of schizophrenia), death or the end of December 2002, whichever occurred first. Crude incidence rates of schizophrenia per 104 person years (PY) were calculated among the irradiated group and each of the two nonexposed groups. Since only half of the exposed cohort had a nonexposed sibling, incidence rates of schizophrenia were also calculated for irradiated subjects who had a nonexposed sibling and for those without a nonexposed sibling. Crude rates were compared using the x2 test- In addition, we combined the two unexposed comparison groups (population and sibling) because the observed numbers of cases of schizophrenia in the sibling and population comparison groups did not differ significantly from the expected numbers estimated under the assumption of the equality of incidence of schizophrenia (83 and 179 compared to 86.9 and 175.1, respectively, P = 0.6, assuming a Poisson distribution). To estimate and compare the risks of schizophrenia in the irradiated group and unexposed population and sibling groups combined, the Cox proportional hazards model stratified by matched sets, using the</page><page sequence="3">672 SADETZKI ET AL. Efron method, was used. This method generates estimates based on within-pair comparisons and is preferable when time to an event is of interest rather than just whether an event occurred (24). Analyses were performed in the total group as well as within subgroups defined by sex, age at irradiation (categorized as nonexposed comparison group, &lt;5 years, 5-9 years and 10+ years) and latent period (&lt;10 years, 10-19 years, 20-29 years and &gt;30 years). Hazard ratios (HR) associated with 1 Gy to the brain and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from a model specifying a linear dependence of risk on dose (see below). Contrasts, used to test differences in the hazard ratios for categories of specific variables, were conducted on the different categories of age at irradiation. For testing the assumption about linear dependence of the risk on dose (úf), we compared goodness of fit of the linear model Г0(Х) • (1 + ß • d) with the linear-quadratic model Г0(Х) (1 + ß,- d + ß2 • d2) using the partial-likelihood ratio test. Analysis using the splines method was also conducted and compared with the linear model. RESULTS Among the 10,834 irradiated subjects, equal proportions of males and females were noted, and the majority were of North African origin (Table 1). About half of the subjects were aged 5-9 years at the time of irradiation (mean 7.1 ± 3.1). The median length of follow-up of 46 years, ranging from 1-54 years for the exposed group, was identical for the sibling and population comparison groups as well. At the end of follow-up, median ages of 53 years (range: 1-72) and 53 years (range: 3-68) were observed for the sibling and population comparison groups, respectively. This analysis was based on 1,217,531 PY, in which 451 cases of schizophrenia (189 exposed, 83 unexposed siblings, and 179 unexposed general population group) were identified up to December 2002. Figure 1 presents the cumulative incidence of schizo- phrenia by age and study group, showing similar findings among the three study groups (P = 0.6). The mean age at first hospital admission for all 45 1 subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia was 26 years, and the mean number of psychiatric hospitalizations was 6. About 60% of the study subjects who developed schizophrenia were diagnosed up to 20 years from the time of irradiation. No statistically significant differences were observed between the study groups with respect to these variables. In the irradiated group, no differences in mean age at first admission by age at irradiation were noticed (Table 2). Irradiated subjects exhibited a nonstatistically significant higher rate of schizophrenia per 104 PY compared with both the sibling and population unexposed groups (3.89 compared to 3.58 for all unexposed subjects, P = 0.4) (Table 3). The higher rates in the irradiated group were more pronounced in males (4.36 compared to 3.81; P = 0.30), those under the age of 5 at the time of irradiation (4.56 compared to 3.51; P = 0.17), and those exposed to the highest tertile of radiation dose (4.67 compared to 3.60; P - 0.11). Of all comparisons presented in the table, only the differences in rates of schizophrenia among irradiated subjects compared to their unexposed siblings for the categories of age at irradiation &lt;5 years and dose &gt;1.5 Gy approached borderline statistical significance (4.56 com- pared to 2.63; P = 0.07, and 4.67 compared to 3.23; P = 0.13, respectively). Irrespective of radiation status, rates of schizophrenia among males were consistently higher than those of females in all of the study groups (4.36 and 3.44 among male and female irradiated subjects, respectively; P = 0.1 and 3.81 compared to 3.35 for the total unexposed subjects; P = 0.3). Compared to the linear dose model, the linear-quadratic dose-response model did not significantly improve good- ness of fit for schizophrenia (partial-likelihood ratio test, P = 0.9). An additional analysis using the splines method was conducted and compared to the linear model. Although a slight improvement in likelihood ratio was observed, the difference was not statistically significant. Therefore, we proceeded with a linear model. Table 4 presents HRs for risk of schizophrenia associated with exposure of 1 Gy to the brain by sex, age at irradiation, and latent period. Overall, no association was observed between irradiation and schizophrenia in any of the comparisons. The HR for schizophrenia reached 1.18 (P = TABLE 1 Selected Characteristics of the Exposed Study Subjects Total 10,834 % Sex: Male 48.9 Female 51.1 Ethnic origin: Asia 19.7 North Africa 58.8 Israel 21.5 Age (years) at irradiation: 0-4 23.2 5-9 53.9 10+ 22.9 Courses of irradiation:0 1 90.6 2 8.4 3 1.0 4 0.1 Dose to brain (Gy), mean (range): Back and front of lower plane 1.1 (0.7^.3) Front of upper plane 1 .8 (1.2-7.1) Average dose to the brain 1.5 (1.0-6.0) Follow-up period (years): Median 46 Range 1-54 Age (years) at end of follow-up: &lt;50 24.0 50-54 41.8 55-59 26.5 60+ 7.7 Median 52 Range 0-68 a One course: 5 consecutive days of treatment.</page><page sequence="4">IONIZING RADIATION AND RISK OF SCHIZOPHRENIA 673 5-1 4 - 3- --P 2- n-l| ; ■ -~**-^** ( ( ^ ( ^ ( 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Age (years) Irradiated _ _ Siblings Population FIG. 1.

Contrasts, conducted on different levels of the variables sex, age at irradiation, and latent period, showed no statistically significant differences. DISCUSSION In a 46-year follow-up based on 1,217,531 PY, no evidence of an association between exposure of the brains of children &lt;15 years old to a mean radiation dose of 1.5 Gy and development of schizophrenia was observed. A comparison of subjects irradiated under the age of 5 years with the matched unexposed group yielded an HR of 1.18 (95% CI: 0.96-1.44, P = 0.1). Analyses by sex, individual doses and latent period did not reveal significant associations between radiation exposure and risk of schizophrenia. Age at diagnosis of schizophrenia was similar in all the study groups. To the best of our knowledge, only three studies (13-15) that assessed exposure to ionizing radiation and risk of schizophrenia have been published. These studies vary greatly with respect to age of the populations studied and the dose of radiation to which the populations were exposed. The study populations included individuals prenatally exposed to the atomic bomb (13), adults aged 30-59 exposed in the framework of the Chernobyl accident (75), and childhood survivors of cancer exposed to high- dose radiation between infancy and 19 years of age (14). Doses of radiation also varied among the studies. Exposure in the atomic bomb study was defined by trimester of pregnancy and distance from the hypocenter (short distance: &lt;2 km, long distance: 2-10 km, or not in the city) at the time of the bombing (13). While radiation doses were not mentioned in this study, weighted colon doses in the atomic bomb studies have been reported to range from 0.005 to 3.0 Gy (8). Effective radiation doses to which Exclusion Zone personnel were exposed in the clean- up after the Chernobyl accident ranged from &lt;0.05 Sv to &gt;1 Sv (75) (no mean dose is available). It should be noted that in the context of the Chernobyl accident, 1 Sv has been described as approximating 1 Gy. In contrast, among childhood brain tumor patients who underwent radiotherapy and later developed schizophrenia, total doses of 42-71 Gy to the brain were reported (14). The results of these studies are also inconsistent. In the atomic bomb study, an HR of 5.04 (95% CI: 1.11-22.77; P = 0.04) was shown for prevalence of schizophrenia when exposure occurred during the second compared to the third trimester of pregnancy.

A 12-year follow-up of the Exclusion Zone personnel in the Chernobyl accident reported a significant increase in the incidence of schizophrenia among these workers compared to the general population in the Ukraine, with rates of 5.4 per 10,000 and 1.1 per 10,000, respectively. Although the radiation doses to which the workers were exposed were lower than those of the tinea capitis cohort, more than half of them were exposed for 5 or more years, while in our study, exposure was limited to '~^ courses. The study of survivors of childhood cancers reported a statistically significant increase in the standard- ized hospitalization ratio (SHR) for schizophrenia and related disorders for survivors of all cancers (1.6; 95% CI: 1.1-2.3) and for brain tumor survivors specifically (2.4; 95% CI: 1.2^.4). Among brain tumor survivors, having undergone radiotherapy was associated with a SHR of 3.8 (95% CI: 1.4-8.2), while a statistically nonsignificant SHR was observed for those who had not undergone radiotherapy (SHR: 1.7; 95% CI: 0.6-4.0). Although the difference in SHRs was not statistically significant (P = 0.15 for the difference in the ratios), the investigators suggested that these results support the notion that radiation by itself may increase the risk of schizophrenia (14).

Each of the three studies described above has limitations. In the atomic bomb study, the dose-response relationship was based on an indirect measure of exposure. In the Chernobyl study, no independent verification of the clinical assessments and diagnoses was considered, and potential confounders such as alcoholism were not accounted for (25). In addition, the Chernobyl study may not be relevant to the present study, because it focused on adult rather than childhood exposure. However, considering the paucity of data on this topic, it is of interest. The authors of the study on childhood cancer survivors mentioned that caution is needed in interpretation of hospitalization ratios for single psychiatric disorders, because psychoses of somatic, cerebral causes or psychiatric disorders in somatic diseases could be misclassified as schizophrenia, limiting the possibility of isolating the effect of radiation (14). Since each of the exposures mentioned above occurred in the context of a traumatic experience, it is difficult to differentiate between stress-induced outcomes and those which may be attributable to delayed effects of radiation. Such residual confounding may exist in our study, because treatment given for tinea capitis was accompanied by trauma (a painful wax procedure, followed by alopecia, that necessitated covering the head), which may have resulted in a poor self image and social stigma (77, 26). Moreover, since all of the members of the tinea capitis cohort were immigrants or children of immigrants, they may have been affected by social stress, which is often associated with immigration. The investigators of the Chernobyl accident suggested three potential etiological factors to explain the appearance of mental disorders, including psychological trauma and stress related to either the disaster itself or to the post-Soviet changes in the society, and radiation effects (75). As mentioned above, the study of Ross et al. on childhood cancer survivors contributes to the dilemma of whether the development of schizophrenia was triggered by trauma or biological factors (i.e. radiation) by showing that the highest SHR for schizophrenia among brain tumor patients was shown in the group treated with radiotherapy (14). It is interesting to note that an early assessment of mental function based on the same cohort described here (7 7) found that those exposed to radiation had a slightly increased risk of total mental hospital admissions that was significant only for those irradiated below the age of 6 years in comparison with the unexposed population group (relative risk 1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.8). A 12-15-year follow-up of another tinea capitis cohort including 1908 irradiated and 1801 nonirradiated subjects treated in 1940-1958 in New York showed a greater frequency of mental illness, including psychosis, personal- ity disorders and psychoneurosis, in the irradiated group than among nonirradiated subjects (P &lt; 0.01) (27). In a 20- year follow-up of this cohort, an excess risk of 1 .4 (P &lt; 0.05) for psychiatric disorders among whites who were irradiated compared to nonirradiated white subjects was noted. Life-table analysis of white subjects showed that the excess risk continued to increase up to 30 years after radiotherapy. This finding was interpreted as indicating a long-term effect of radiotherapy rather than short-term psychiatric crises in response to the trauma of the treatment (28). Our study was based on a relatively large population whose exposure was well validated and quantified. Uncertainties concerning dose estimations were assessed in an analysis by Schafer et al, who concluded that measurement error in dosimetry of the thyroid has a negligible effect on dose-response estimation, inference and the modifying effect of age at exposure (29). Another strength of our study is the low rate of loss to follow-up (1.7%). In addition, the registry used as the source for identification of schizophrenia cases was a complete listing of all psychiatric hospitalizations in the country; only 10% of schizophrenia patients are not hospitalized. Therefore, it is unlikely that relevant cases were missed. Furthermore, the stability of diagnosis of schizophrenia in the psychiatric registry (from the first admission to the last discharge) has been shown to be high (&gt;70%) (30). Among the limitations of the study was the availability of unexposed siblings for only half of the irradiated subjects, due primarily to the contagious nature of the disease, which led to infection of several family members, who subse- quently underwent radiotherapy. Another limitation is that</page><page sequence="7">676 SADETZKI ET AL. other psychiatric or psychological disorders that may be associated with exposure to ionizing radiation were not investigated. Although radiotherapy for treatment of tinea capitis has long been replaced with oral and topical medication, exposure to medical radiation remains a contemporary concern due to the frequent use of procedures such as computed tomography for diagnostic purposes. The ques- tion of whether the diagnostic benefits of this technology, especially in children, outweigh safety concerns, such as increased risk of cancer, is currently being debated (31-35). In conclusion, our findings do not provide evidence of an association between exposure to ionizing radiation and risk of schizophrenia. Considering the positive associations between radiation and various cognitive outcomes, reported by some investigators (77, 36, 37), we suggest that more research on the possible effects of early exposure to radiation on schizophrenia specifically, and brain tissue in general, is needed.
