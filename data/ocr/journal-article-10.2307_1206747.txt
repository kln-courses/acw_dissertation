<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Personhood of Sarihkara's Para Brahman Bradley Malkovsky / University of Notre Dame All Vedantic schools attempt to clarify and summarize the teaching of the Upanisads,' to give harmony and unity to scriptural testimony regarding ontology and soteriology. In their questioning and analysis of sacred texts, the Vedantic bhdsyakdras (commentators) give special consideration to the nature of braman, who is the Absolute revealed in the Upanisads, and to the relation of this brahman to the phenomenal world. This preoc- cupation with ontology does not arise merely out of a desire to satisfy the demands of a correct philosophical understanding of God and world but, more important, is grounded in the awareness that any given doctrine of God has practical implications for the path one must follow if liberation from suffering is to be attained. Thus, ontology and soteriology go to- gether in the commentators' struggle to come to a right understanding of what Sruti (revealed scripture) intends. The theologian-monk2 Sarikara, who flourished around 700 c.E., is one such bhdsyakdra. As the greatest exponent of the Advaita, or nondualist school of Vedanta, he is not only the best-known and most influential thinker of his particular brand of Upanisad interpretation but is also the most famous figure in the entire history of Hindu reflective thought. He is, in addition, one who is largely indebted to the Vedantic tradition that preceded him and that bequeathed to him the supreme truth revealed in the Sruti. In his writings Samikara therefore appears to follow tradition as closely as possible, trying not to diverge from it if at all possible.3 Not 541 The composition of the principal Upanisads is roughly 900-300 B.C.E. 2 Though Samiakara argues at times philosophically, his overall method is theological. Y. Masih, Shankara's Universal Philosophy of Religion (New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1987), remarks, "On the whole, however, the enterprise of Shankara is theological since reasoning remains subordinate to the scripture and is used for elucidating and defending the scrip- tural statements. .... Shankara clearly states that Brahman is not to be known through rea- soning alone" (p. 92).

And because he is a commentator who is closely bound to sacred texts of great author- ity, texts that generally lack a systematic approach to ontology, Sarhkara's utterances on a given issue are often widely dispersed throughout his corpus, mirroring the topical inconstancy of the primacy texts on which he reflects. At times his remarks emerge incomplete, requiring of the reader much effort to piece together the Advaitin's authentic-and, one hopes-unified view. While his individual arguments against the views of his opponents are often enough brilliant in their logic, Sarhkara is too often cryptic and difficult to understand when presenting in piecemeal fashion aspects of his own particular doctrines. This is as true of his teach- ing on the proper ontological link between brahman and the world as it is on the relation between brahman and fovara (the "Lord"). No less an au- thority than Paul Hacker spoke almost half a century ago of Sarhkara's "terminological inexactness" (terminologische Ungenauigkeit) and names a "general characteristic" (allgemeine Eigentiimlichkeit) of his thought "an aversion to definitions and an aloof unconcern for conceptual systematic thought."4 When all the texts have been examined, it is hard to deny that this exceptional logician, commentator, and mystic remains an enigmatic and elusive thinker. In this essay I concern myself primarily with the nature of the Absolute or the para brahman in the teaching of Sarikara, in particular with the question of the possible personhood of this Absolute, a query that has far-reaching implications for the interreligious encounter. Questions about the world's ontological status will accordingly be treated in a subsid- iary fashion, inasmuch as they facilitate discussion about brahman. In treating the question of brahman's personhood it would be helpful to know which other religious and philosophical movements besides Advaita Vedanta may have influenced Sarhkara's understanding of deity; further it would be useful to discern whether there was any development in Sarhkara's thought away from or toward an advaitic theism. At the present juncture of Sarhkara interpretation, the latter question regarding a pos- sible doctrinal development is difficult. Traditional biographies assert that Sarhkara was an advaitin from an early age, having learned its prin- ciples from his first, and perhaps only, teacher, Govinda.5 Hacker, how- ever, believes that Sarihkara was first a Patafijala yogin, who only later 542 "4 Eine Abneigung gegen Definitionen und eine souverine Sorglosigkeit gegeniiber be- grifflicher Systematik" (my translation). See Paul Hacker: Kleine Schriften, ed. Lambert Schmithausen (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1978), p. 108. 5 Tradition states that Govinda formally initiated Samikara into the monastic life (sarny- dsa) when the latter was a boy of perhaps only eight years.</page><page sequence="3">Sarikara's Para Brahman turned to the teaching of Advaita.6 A number of other authors take still a different view, holding that Sarhkara converted to Advaita from a bheddbheda tradition,7 perhaps under the influence of the Gaudapddfya- Karikd.8 In addition, Sarikara exhibits a strong theistic interest, making it reasonable to think that one or another devotional sect influenced his thinking.9 It is not impossible to assume, as R. N. Dandekar has pointed out, that all of these traditions had an effect on Sarikara's thought.'0 In other words, Patarijala Yoga, bheddbheda Veddnta, and some form of theism may all have influenced Sarhkara's particular interpretation of Advaita. While there is uncertainty in regard to an actual development of Sarhk- ara's thought, recent scholarship, indebted in part to a seminal essay by Hacker entitled "Relations of Early Advaitins to Vaisnavism,i" has pro- vided a greater certitude in determining which devotional sect influenced Sarikara's thinking. Here evidence has converged on Vaisnavism rather than on Saivism as the major source of Sarikara's theistic interest. Samk- ara shows a predilection for Vaisnavite terms, symbols, and practices in the Brahma Sutra Bhasya (BrSfiBh) and elsewhere,'2 but he treats the Saivite theology of his time with contempt.'3 Hacker, however, did not believe that Samkara's preference for Vaisnav- ism over Saivism went so far as to influence what he called Sarhkara's "philosophy." Though Sarhkara may have hailed from a Vaisnavite back- ground, his Advaitic vision appears to be free of specifically Vaisnavite teachings."4 Other scholars have challenged this last point. They offer the opinion that Vaisnavism had a greater impact on Sarikara's philosophy (or theology) than Hacker concedes. One of these, Hajime Nakamura, 543 6 Paul Hacker, "Safikara der Yogin und Safikara der Advaitin," in Kleine Schriften, pp. 213-41. 7 See Hajime Nakamura, A History of Early Veddnta Philosophy: Part I (Delhi: Motilal Banar- sidass, 1983), p. 459. 8 Ingalls, pp. 12-13. 9 The first scholars to suggest that more attention be given to Sarikara's theistic passages were G.

Hacker has also noted Sarikara's reference to "the superimposition of the spiritual vision on idols (pratimd)" (BrSfBh 111.3.9, IV.1.3, IV. 1.5). The dcarya's approval of Vaisnavism is also evidenced in his commentaries on Tait- tiriya Upanisad (TaiUp) 1.6.1, 1.8.1; Mundaka Upanisad (MuUp) II.1.4; Pragna Upanisad (PrUp) V.2; Brhadaranyaka Upanisad (BrUp) I.1.1, V.1.1.; Chandagya Upanisad (ChUp) VI.16.3, VII.1.4, VIII.1.1; Gaud.apadiyakarikas (GK) IV. 1.

It is probable that the Visnupurdna exercised some influ- ence upon formation of Sankara's thought since he quotes it in his works."'5 W. G. Neevel has, in addition, located a passage in Sarikara's BhGBh in which Sarikara appears deliberately to use the "characteristically Pd~rcar- dtrika enumeration" of the six gunas that describe the Lord Visnu, also called Narayana, who becomes the avatar Krsna.'6 The terms jidna (knowledge), aislvarya (lordliness), sakti (power), bala (strength), vfrya (im- mutability) and tejas (splendor), which Sarhkara lists in his introduction to his BhGBh as descriptive of Visnu, are also to be found in Visnu Purmna VI.5.79, but in a different sequence.'7 Neevel concludes that Sarhkara had a quite favorable view of Pd&amp;icardtra, although he was certainly him- self not a Pdrcardtrin. In any case, Sarhkara's deliberate use of a certain number and collection of divine attributes does reveal his deep acquain- tance with and sympathy to Vaisnavism. More recently, in a sterling essay on the place of devotionalism in Sarhk- ara's thought, Jacqueline Hirst has offered solid evidence for the great effect that Visnu religion had on Sarhkara and concludes that, "for Sarik- ara, Narayana is evocative of the furthest reaches to which personalistic religious language can penetrate."'8 In my own study of the role that di- vine grace plays in Sarhkara's soteriology, I noted the many occasions in which Sarhkara introduces the notion of grace where the text on which he is commenting does not even remotely allude to it. Further, certain elements of Sarimkara's doctrine of grace exhibit features characteristic of Vaisnavism.'9 Sengaku Mayeda, who is indebted to Hacker in his use of method, states succinctly of Sarhkara, "It can be ascertained from his works that he had some faith in, or was favorable to, Vaisnavism."20 In the remainder 544 15 Nakamura, pp. 340-41. 16 W.

The brahman acknowledged by Sarikara as the supreme reality and the object of this investigation is properly and more precisely the para brah- man, the "higher brahman," as distinct from the "lower," or apara brahman. This distinction between a higher and lower brahman is one of the hall- marks of Sarhkara's advaita-vada. To speak of the latter first: the "lower brahman" has many meanings in Sarhkara's works, and one must therefore pay close attention each time to the context in which Samkara uses the term, but it is certainly true that the apara brahman lacks the complete transcendence of the para brahman. The lower brahman is rather the Abso- lute that is either conceived (1) as possessing innumerable auspicious qualities (sa-guna) not yet purified of their limiting content by negation and analogy; (2) as having relations with the phenomenal world that might be mistaken as defining its nature or essence, for example, Lord, cause, illuminer; or (3) as receiving deliberate attribution of mundane qualities and forms by aspirants to liberation for the purpose of pious meditation (updsand), for example, "With a beard bright as gold."2' While the third way of conceiving brahman is the one most easily recognized by philosophical theologians as exhibiting inadequate language about the divine, it nonetheless serves a useful purpose in leading the mind "up- ward" to a greater appreciation of the divine nature, however preliminary and rudimentary this understanding may be. The para brahman, by contrast, is the supreme reality itself, utterly sim- ple and undivided (akhanda), devoid of complexifying gunas and de- limiting relations, beyond the imagination, and therefore totally tran- scendent to all notion and representation. It is that which must be known, if bondage to ignorance, desire, and delusion are to be overcome. The realization of brahman as one's very Self (dtman) constitutes the highest human goal (BrSfBh I. 1.1). The para brahman is the center around which the whole of Sarhkara's thought revolves, the polestar to which he orients all his philosophical and religious endeavor. As the original and eternal reality, brahman is the transcendental ground of the phenomenal world, both changeless and limitless, nameless and ineffable, completely tran- scending human thought and speech. Though words are incapable of defining it ("neti neti," "not this, not this"), their secondary or analogical meanings can indirectly indicate its essence as Reality itself, plenitude of Being (sat), pure Consciousness (cit), and unalloyed Bliss (ananda). By vir- tue of its simplicity and fullness, it is unlike any being of the phenomenal 545 21 ChUp 1.6.6. See Saihkara's commentary on this and BrSfBh 1.1.20.</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Religion order, yet is both hidden and pervasive and present to all beings. It can- not be known through reason left to itself but requires the authoritative testimony of the revelation given in the Upanisads for its proper under- standing. Having said this much about the para brahman, I return to the original question to which this essay is dedicated: Is Sarhkara's Absolute personal or impersonal? This is a deceptively complex question and not as easily answered as the modern secondary literature might make it appear to be. The conclusion reached today by the great majority of Sarhkara's inter- preters, whether they be his followers or his critics, whether nondualists by conviction or theists, is that Samrkara's para brahman is anything but personal. We shall see the reasons for this in what follows. But at any rate, for now let it be noted that most of Sarikara's summarizers characterize his para brahman as "impersonal" or "nonpersonal." Of these expositors, a great many-mostly Advaitins, followers of Sarhkara-go on to main- tain that this brahman is in no wise the "God" worshiped by the theist, whether that bhakta (worshiper) be Hindu or an adherent of some other religion. This makes the issue of brahman's personhood a controversial one, for by implication the God worshiped by the devotee is relegated by contemporary Advaitins to a status inferior to that of the para brahman. The bhaktas, in turn, could never accept the subordination of their per- sonal God to an alleged impersonal Absolute. One example must suffice here: in a well-known rebuke of the Advaita position in 1904,22 Georges Thibaut reacted sharply against what he felt to be Sarhkara's elimination of the personal God of grace, charging both Sarikara and his followers with insensitivity toward the religion of the Indian masses and "the wants of the human heart." Thibaut much preferred Ramanuja's conception of the Absolute, whose gracious care of the devotee he saw as real and permanent. Thibaut concluded that Sarhkara's para brahman was "inacces- sible to all human wants and sympathies," and even though Sarhkara did speak of a personal Lord, his fsvara, in contrast to the 1-vara of Ramanuja, was ultimately an ontological illusion, a "shadowy Lord," neither able nor willing "to lend a gracious ear to the supplication of the worshipper." The final truth espoused by nondualists, he wrote, centered on "a universal non-personal essence" and amounted to the annihilation of the human person.23 But there are other interpreters of Samkara, it is true, a small number of scholars in recent decades who see no incongruity in designating 546 22 Georges Thibaut, ed. and introduction to Vedanta-S&amp;tras with the Commentary by Sankard- carya, vol. 34 of Sacred Books of the East (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1988), esp. pp. xxx, cxxvii-cxxvi11. 23 Ibid., pp. cxxvii-cxxviii.</page><page sequence="7">Sarihkara's Para Brahman Sarhkara's para brahman "personal." They come to this conclusion usually by one of two paths: either on the basis of a philosophical consideration of what it means to be "person," or else via an examination of Sarihkara's use of certain key terms, especially of the term "k'vara" (Lord) or its syn- onym "paramesvara" (supreme Lord). Though these scholars represent a minority position in Sarhkara interpretation, their arguments are formi- dable and tend to suggest that the post-Samkara Advaita tradition di- verges from the great dcdrya (teacher) on a few not insignificant points. In what follows, I will summarize the main arguments and assumptions of modern authors who deny personhood of Sarhkara's para brahman, and I hope thereby to show the strength and logic of this position. In addi- tion, I will provide reasons for an alternative interpretation of Sarhkara, employing both philosophical and exegetical arguments in favor of the view that the para brahman can legitimately be regarded as the supreme Person. My intention is to clear away misconceptions that prevent a deeper theological exchange between followers of very different spiritual paths, in particular between Hindus and Christians. It will be seen that the scholarly achievements of two men, Paul Hacker (1913-79) and Rich- ard De Smet (1916-97) are of particular importance for this study, the former because of his exegetical work on Sarikara's use of the term fivara, the latter because of his more philosophical reflections on Sarikara's on- tology and use of language and also because of his analysis of the notion of "person" in the context of Advaita-Christian dialogue. But first one additional point must be made: nowhere in his writings does Sarikara himself take up directly the issue of brahman's per- sonhood-no exact Sanskrit equivalent of the Western word "person" was available to him by which he could do this-and so it was left to posterity to decide whether such a predication would be compatible with his conception of a perfect and transcendent deity. It is only since the nineteenth century, in the encounter of India and the West, that language about personhood creeps into the scholarly discussion about brahman. ARGUMENTS AGAINST PERSONHOOD A great number of cogent reasons have been advanced in support of the claim that the para brahman completely transcends the category of the personal. These arguments frequently, but not exclusively, focus on the many ways in which Sarhkara distinguishes "higher" from "lower" in epis- temology and ontology. Some of these distinctions and the way they are used to deny personhood of the para brahman are included in what follows: 1. Ontology.-This first argument does not directly involve a distinction of "higher" and "lower," but it is the presupposition of many of the con- 547</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion trasts that Salmkara makes. Ontologically, Salmkara's understanding of re- ality is usually described as monistic. A-dvaita, literally "non-duality," is taken to mean acosmic illusionism, the denial that anything exists but brahman. The world of beings may appear to exist, but in reality only brahman is. It is through avidyd (ignorance) that there is an appearance of contingent reality, but in fact the eternal brahman is the sole reality. If this is so, there cannot be-on the level of reality, rather than of mere appearance-a Lord in relation to creatures and the world, for there is in actual fact nothing to which brahman could relate as Lord. 2. Higher and Lower Knowledge.--Despite the truth of monism, people are ensnared by ignorance and take the world to be real. But enlighten- ment holds out the possibility that this lower-level way of knowing and experiencing can be sublated or canceled out. Thus scripture, in particu- lar MuUp 1.1.4-6, and Samrkara distinguish between higher knowledge (pard vidyd) and lower knowledge (apard vidyd). The higher knowledge of nonduality corresponds to a higher point of view (paramartha-avasthd) that replaces the everyday consciousness (vyavahara-avasthd) character- ized by the subject-object distinction. This means that the perception of a personal Lord distinct from the devotee is a relative truth only. This is true even of mystical states, so long as the subject-object distinction per- dures; thus, even if a theistic mystic were to have an experience of "God," the Advaitin would insist on the relativity of that knowledge. What awaits the aspirant to truth is a final experience of deity that completely shatters all personalistic categories, indeed even the distinction of devotee and Lord. 3. Two Definitions of Brahman.--We saw above that the para brahman is limitless and devoid of relation but that to everyday consciousness there is a God related to the world. Accordingly, Sarikara offers relational and nonrelational definitions of brahman. Though he does not employ the terms tatastha-laksana (accidental definition) and svarfpa-laksana (essential definition)24--the terms are from Padmapada-he does uphold the dis- tinction for all practical purposes. The tatastha-laksana, or relational defi- nition, is brahman conceived in reference to something else, that is, the world. Here brahman is regarded as cause, goal, Lord, illuminer, and so forth. But these are only true of brahman if the world exists. Thus, from the standpoint of higher truth, from the paramartha-avasthd, it is the svar- ftpa-laksana, or brahman regarded in itself, that yields the superior defini- tion. For Sarhkara, the question of brahman's essential definition is the question whether relationality belongs to the Absolute. His answer is that 548 24 A solid introduction to these two types of laksana is provided by T. R. V. Murti, "The Two Definitions of Brahman in the Advaita," in Studies in Indian Thought, ed. Harold Coward (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1983), pp. 72-87.</page><page sequence="9">Sarhkara's Para Brahman it does not. Sarikara's teaching on the complete transcendence and pleni- tude of divine being rules out all attribution of relation. To ascribe rela- tionality or other-directedness to brahman would amount to a denial of its sovereignty, independence, self-sufficiency, and fullness. It is precisely divine transcendence that appears to be threatened by relationality. And that the Absolute might itself be pure relation is unattested by any writing of Samkara. The para brahman is in its self-sufficient plenitude and sim- plicity utterly devoid of relation, both "outward" toward the world as well as "inward" toward itself. It does not require the existence of the world, to which it might relate, for it to be itself. Sarikara's sure foundation is iruti, whose most well known essential definition of brahman is given in TaiUp II.1: brahman is "Reality, Knowledge, Infinite" (satyamjicmdnam anan- tam brahma). By contrast, a personal, relational Lord corresponds rather to the lower tatastha-laksana. 4. Brahman Does Not Create.--All that has been said so far clearly ex- cludes the possibility that the para brahman is the creator of the world, for Sarimkara's ontology nullifies the world's reality. How could anything or anyone coexist with that One (tad ekam) who is by nature the plenitude of being? The bhaktas, of course, maintain that the personal God who is the object of their worship is the world's source and goal. But from the stand- point of the pard vidyd, Advaitins argue, all causation talk is meaningless when applied to the Absolute. On the level of the vyavahdra-avasthd, to be sure, Advaitins recognize the necessity of a world cause, who is identified as fivara or saguna brahman rather than the higher brahman. But in the absence of a doctrine of creatio ex nihilo the manifestation of the universe must logically entail a transformation of brahman. The notion that the effect is the modification or transformation of the cause is labeled the parindma-vdda. The parinama-vada explains well the observable transfor- mations that occur in the ordinary world of experience (gold into jewelry, clay into pots), but the question must be raised whether such a view of causation can meaningfully apply to the partless, changeless, and purely spiritual brahman. Advaitins answer that it cannot. Thus from the higher level of insight, causation itself must be illusory, which insight gives rise to the vivarta-vada, that is, the teaching that creation is only apparent. In reality brahman brings nothing into existence. And since creation is illu- sory, the personal creator God must share that same status. 5. livara is the Saguna Brahman.-We have seen that the saguna brah- man-that is, brahman with qualities or attributes-does not correspond to the supreme brahman, which cannot be properly expressed. The lower saguna brahman is therefore a conceptual abstraction,25 and from the 549 25 P. T. Raju, Structural Depths of Indian Thought (New Delhi: South Asian Publishers, 1985), remarks, "God is only a thought-product" (p. 395).</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion standpoint of the highest level of awareness it is ontologically unreal. "Kyv- ara," Sarikara's nonsectarian designation for "Lord,"26 is customarily re- garded by Advaitins as the saguna brahman in its most personalized form. "The qualified Brahman, if personified, becomes the God or livara of Advaita."27 What makes iivara personal is its possession of consciousness and freedom but, even more important, its governing relatedness to the world. It is this character of being essentially related to the universe that makes Tsvara the lower or inferior brahman, that which Advaitins often translate as "God." P. T. Raju remarks that "God" is "Brahman with refer- ence to the world" and adds, "The idea of God is valid only so long as the world lasts. Sub specie aeternitatis God has no reality; but sub specie temporis he is as real as the world."28 For Advaitins it is axiomatic that Mvara is brahman associated with maya, an inexplicable power or cause or original matter, which, like ignorance (avidyd) is the principle behind the false appearance of the real.29 Through the combined causation of maya and avidya, the "impersonal" Absolute appears as the "personal" isvara. Ac- cording to Eliot Deutsch, "Whenever we transform the impersonal into the personal, that is when we make Brahman something or someone who cares, we bring about an association of the impersonal with mdyd."'30 Kvara is an appearance only, but it is the highest appearance of any being on the plane of mdyd.31 To summarize the position of the "impersonalists": Advaita does not banish all talk of a personal God in favor of an exclusive focus on the impersonal nirguna brahman. Indeed, many Advaitins maintain that the normal path to enlightenment does not circumvent the practice of bhakti and the prayer for divine grace. The path to the impersonal, in most instances, leads first through the personal.32 Yet, while Mvara is the high- est manifestation of the personal, the God worshiped and prayed to by the bhakta, it is also true that ivara's status is mirage-like; being but a mere anthropomorphized saguna brahman, its being is provisional and ul- timately subject to the same sublation to which all vyavahdlra existence is prone. When all distinctions are dissolved in the bliss of enlightenment, 550 26 See Jan Gonda, "The lIvara Idea," in his Change and Continuity in Indian Religion (New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1985), p. 158; and Hirst, p. 129. 27 M.

Nothing exists that could take away from the perfec- tion and fullness of the Advaitic Absolute. The para brahman is the sole re- ality. ARGUMENTS FOR PERSONHOOD What I have sketched so far as Sarhkara's indirect arguments against a supreme personal brahman would doubtless appear to many to carry the last word in the debate. Judged on the merits of the presuppositions of an acosmic ontology and a strict identification of a personal God with the illusory and saguna-bound is'vara, these arguments appear irrefutable and obvious. But now I would like to raise an issue that does not so much call into question the logic of this reasoning as it does the ascription of these teachings and arguments to Salmkara himself. I would like to contest, as scholars have occasionally done since G. A. Jacob's preface in 1894 to the Veddntasdra of Sadananda,33 and especially and with greater frequency since Hacker's celebrated essay from 1950, "Eigentiimlichkeiten der Le- hre und Terminologie Safikaras: Avidya, Namarfipa, Maya, Isvara,"34 the more or less strict identification of the teachings of Samkara with those of the post-Samkara Advaitic tradition. The issue most commonly raised against this identification of Samkara with later authors is the relation of is'vara to brahman. Hacker pointed out conclusively in a painstaking analy- sis of Samrkara's most important text, the commentary (bhdsya) on the Brahma-Sutra (BrSuBh), that Samkara makes ifvara practically inter- changeable with the para brahman in the great majority of cases in which the terms appear. In other words, 1fvara is not simply equated with the saguna brahman (although in a few places the two are synonymous, ac- cording to Hacker) and made subordinate to the higher brahman. Rather, isvara, parameivara, paramdtman (supreme Self), and para brahman are all terms Samikara uses to designate the supreme reality.

Foremost among these has been, for several decades, Richard De Smet.36 In a creative interpretation of Sarmkara's teaching on causation and in light of careful attention to what he perceives to be Samkara's three levels of language, he concludes that an acosmic interpretation mis- represents Samkara and distorts the subtlety of his thought.37 These, then, according to some recent scholars, are the two major in- stances of disagreement between Samkara and his followers: ontology and the 1fvara-brahman relation. Both of these have implications for the five arguments against personhood I have sketched above. That is to say, it could be argued that these five points are to varying degrees more char- acteristic of the post-Samkara Advaita tradition than they are of the great dcdrya himself. This is not to deny that Samkara more or less abides by the distinctions nirgunfa and saguna brahman, para and apara, paramdrtha- avasthd and vyavahdra-avastha, svarftpa-laksana and tatastha-laksana. I would only like to suggest that there is an alternative way of reading these distinctions. Thus, in the following section of this essay I enlist the aid of some of those exegetes who question the simple identification of Sarhkara and post-Sarhkara Advaita,38 so that I may put forward my basic thesis: that to ascribe personhood to Sarhkara's para brahman not only is legitimate 552 15 See Hacker, "Eigen.," pp. 91-99. 36 Among Richard De Smet's voluminous writings, see, in particular, "Maya or Ajfiana?"

Clooney, who, in contrast to De Smet, Hacker, and myself, stresses the continuity of the tradition of Advaita and who feels that a proper understanding of Sarikara is best made by reading Sarikara in light of later Indian commentaries on his work. While not simply identifying the teachings of Sarikara with those of post-Sarikara Advaita, Clooney does regard the later tradition as a full flowering of what came before. See Francis X. Clooney, Theology after Vedanta (Albany, N.Y.: SUNY Press, 1993), pp. 21-22. Hacker, by contrast, in his Untersu- chungen iiber Texte desfriihen Advaitavdda (Mainz: Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Li- teratur, 1951), p. 1933, n. 1, published a year after "Eigen.," remarked that he was not aware of any commentary on Sarhkara's BrSfiBh from within the Advaita tradition that reflected well Sarhikara's thought: "Ubrigens sind alle mir zugainglichen Kommentare zum SBh [Sarhkara's Brahma Satra Bhasya] keine guten Erlaiuterungsschriften. Der beste ist in dieser Beziehung noch Vacaspatis Bhamati, doch bentitzt dieser zur Erklirung von Lehren des Bhasya manchmal Lehren anderer Advaitins, und vieles lisst er unerkliart.

After completing the exegetical summary I return to the "higher"- "lower" distinctions discussed above and reinterpret them in light of a more realist interpretation of Sarhkara's ontology. Following this, I briefly review some compelling philosophical reasons favoring designating Sarikara's para brahman personal. And, finally, I suggest some implications of this conclusion for the encounter of Advaita Vedanta and Christian theology. To turn now to arguments in favor of a personal para brahman: 1. A revised isvara-para brahman relation.--Sarihkara does not relegate zsvara or paramesvara, the relational deity, to an inferior ontological status. To show this, I shall bypass the remarks of Jacob and proceed directly to Hacker who offers a more thorough and extensive analysis of the im- portant texts.39 Samkara clearly accords to Ksvara a greater importance than does the tradition after him-this, on the evidence of two observations. First, he uses the term much more frequently than does later Advaita, more even than his own immediate disciples.40 Second, it can be seen from the con- text in which the terms 1-vara, paramesvara, para brahman, and paramdtman are used, as well as from the common attributes Sarikara uses to describe them, that I-vara-parames$vara is usually synonymous with and equivalent to the higher brahman. That is to say, despite Sarmkara's formal distinction between the nirguna and saguna brahman, in practice he does not shy away from ascribing features to the supposed attributeless nirguna brahman. These same characteristics he also frequently assigns to isyvara.41 Both are conscious, sinless, omnipresent, eternally complete, pure, and free (cf. BrSfiBh 11.1.14 with I.1.1). Like the higher brahman and the supreme dtman, /vara is a non-agent (111.4.8), nonexperiencer (1.2.8), lacks noth- ing, is eternally changeless (1.3.19), and is known only through revela- tion. It is -vara who is the inner Self (11.3.47), just as is the para brahman. The inner Self is in fact a state (avastha) of the paramesvara (1.2.24). The cause of the world, too, is sometimes given by Samkara to be 8vara, but at other times he names paramdtman (111.3.16) or para brahman (II.1.1). In BrSfiBh IV.1.3, Sarihkara explains that maha-vakya (Great Saying) aham brahmasmi (I am Brahman) to mean that it is fSvara who is the supreme Self, an equation that is strictly forbidden in later Advaita. The examples Hacker gives for the interchangeability of 1Wvara with brahman-dtman are so numerous that I will forgo an attempt to continue to list them. 553 39 See Hacker, "Eigen.," pp. 99-109. 40 Ibid., p. 108. 41 Ibid., pp. 99-100, 109.</page><page sequence="14">The Journal of Religion isvara and the para brahman are not interchangeable in all cases, writes Hacker. Whenever there is a clear division of ruler and ruled on the vya- vahdra plane (see 111.2.38) or when the lordship (I-varatva) of 1Wvara is declared illusory (11.1.14), then Sarikara will not employ the terms para brahman or paramdtman as synonymous with 1(vara.42 Hacker notes, too, that 1-vara is named much more frequently as an object of meditation (updsand) than is the saguna brahman. Here isvara can be regarded as paramdtman qualified by attributes. This, of course, is quite in keeping with modern Advaita. But are these attributes illusory? Else- where Sarimkara does teach that the higher brahman can be meditated on with attributes because "the attributes apply." (I.2.2)43 Unfortunately, Samkara offers no definitions which would sufficiently clarify the relation of 1-vara to brahman.44 Hacker suggests that Samrkara might have inherited his loose and untroubled language for the Absolute from his Vedantic predecessors45-this by contrast with the teaching of later Advaita on theplace of Ivara.46 Hacker sums up Samikara's position on the 1-vara-brahman relation as follows: lsvara is for S. a concept which hovers curiously between Param and Aparam Brahma. Most of the time it is the former, rarely the latter, and in some cases one does not hazard a judgement: Here fervent theism has combined with reflective monism to enter an illogical but all the more vibrant union. How far S. goes in this identification is made especially clear by the fact that even with the Paramesv- ara (IV, 4, 19 K 978, 8) he distinguishes two forms (rnpa), the one saguna, the other nirguna-exactly as with Brahman (I, 1, 11 K 213, 7 and IV, 3, 14 K 964, 12-13).47 554 42 Ibid., p. 104. BrSfBh II1.1.14 constitutes the strongest evidence in favor of regarding isvara as illusory. Yet Sarhkara's intention is not obvious. Does he mean that fs'vara is ulti- mately an illusion, or is his intent to declare that brahman's lordship in no way complexifies its essence? See, on this passage, R. De Smet, "Radhakrishnan's Interpretation of Safikara," in Radhakrishnan Centenary Volume, ed. G. Parthasarathi and D. P Chattopadhyaya (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1989), pp. 62-63. 43 Hacker, "Eigen.," p. 107. 44 Ibid., p. 108. 45 Ibid. 46 Ibid. Here Hacker notes that in post-Sarhkara Advaita f.vara becomes brahman associ- ated with maya. 47 Ibid., 109: "I|vara ist bei S. ein Begriff, der merkwtirdig in der Schwebe steht zwischen Param und Aparam Brahma. Meist ist er das erstere, selten das letztere, und in manchen Fallen (s. o. S. 285) wagt man keine Entscheidung: da ist der gefuihlsmassige Theismus mit dem gedanklichen Monismus eine unlogische, daftir aber um so lebendigere Vereinigung eingegangen. Wie weit bei S. die Identifizierung mit dem Param Brahma geht, erhellt be- sonders deutlich daraus, dass er auch beim Parameivara (IV, 4, 19 K 978, 8) zwei Gestalten (rapa) unterscheidet, die eine saguna, die andere nirguna-ganz wie beim Brahman (I, 1, 11 K 213, 7 und IV, 3, 14 K 964, 12-13)" (my translation; "K" is Kashi Sanskrit Series no. 71 [Benares, 1931], the edition of Sarhkara's Brahma Sfitra Bhasya used by Hacker. The first number after "K" is the page number, the second refers to the line). Raimundo Panik-</page><page sequence="15">Samkara's Para Brahman We may note here that even while Hacker holds Samkara to teach illu- sionism, a creation-denying monism, he does not see Sairkara canceling out the reality of vara or simply relegating Tsvara to the vyavahdra plane of existence. Rather, the personal fivara is one of Samikara's preferred terms for the Absolute, as is the para brahman. In addition to Hacker's findings, it is worth noting that in BrSfBh 1.2.13 and 111.2.6 Sarhkara makes the referent of the mahd-vdkya "That thou art" (tat tvam asi) not brahman-dtman but, rather, fzivara or parameiv- ara.48 In some of his other authentic writings, too, Samkara equates brahman-dtman with i~svara-parames'vara, for example, in Brhadaranyaka Upanisad Bhisya (BrUpBh) III. 7.3, IV.4.15; ChUpBh 1.1.1, V.18.1; Kena Upanisad Bhisya (KeUpBh) 111.1-2; Katha Upanisad Bhasya (KaUpBh) 11.2.13; and BhGBh XI. 36. Occasionally, he makes Visnu- Ndrdyana synonymous with the supreme reality, as in BrUpBh 111.7.3; KaUpBh 11.3.13; BhGBh VII.16-17, and so on.49 Thus, an exegetical analysis of Samrkara's use of terms for the divine has revealed at least this much in regard to the question initially posed in this essay: a proper understanding of the Absolute need not exclude the possibility that this reality might in some sense be personal. That the para brahman might be personal cannot be automatically ruled out on the grounds of a supposed clear separation between a higher "impersonal" brahman and a lower "personal" God or Lord. But what are we to make, then, of Samkara's many distinctions between "higher" and "lower"? To answer this, we must first reevaluate his ontology. 2. A realist ontology.--A-dvaita, literally "non-duality," affirms the unity, plenitude, and transcendence of brahman, besides which no other being can exist in a like manner. Whether given a realist or monistic interpreta- tion, Advaita always denotes a denial of dualism, but need not entail a total monistic rejection of contingent being. Advaita means that brahman and the world cannot be added up as parallel entities; indeed there can be no being that is exterior to brahman's reality. One of the strongest af- firmations of "realism" in Samhkara's thought has been propounded by D. M. Datta, who rejected the normal interpretation of Advaita given by 555 kar, The Unknown Christ of Hinduism, rev. ed. (Maryknoll: Orbis, 1981), sums up well later Advaita's teaching on fs'vara. He states that Sarimkara's "followers were so keen to preserve the absolute purity and transcendence of Brahman and its total uncontamination by the World, that they placed Isvara in the realm of mayd, since it is he who is concerned with the creation of the World and hence gets involved in cosmic play. ... The livara of the Sanikara school is in fact almost completely turned towards the phenomenal order. He can still be called God, but is no longer identifiable with the Absolute, with Brahman.... The diver- gence between Brahman and Isvara is overstressed in order to save the absolute purity of the former" (pp. 151, 158-59). 48 See Malkovsky (n. 19 above), pp. 212-15, 291-92. 49 Ibid., pp. 442-43.</page><page sequence="16">The Journal of Religion monists: "We often hear of the world vanishing altogether after Sdksat- kdra. Nothing is farther from the intention of Sarhkara than such an inter- pretation. ... The Jagat, or the differentiated world of ordinary experi- ence [stands] transfigured, as the manifestation of Brahman, when atten- tion is diverted from multiplicity to the unity of the whole universe and the ordinary judgment is revised in the light of the new experience of intuition of the one. So the negation of the world, as conceived by Sarik- ara, is more a transformation, re-organisation and revaluation than wholesale annihilation."50 Thus, according to Datta, in the state of nondual awareness the world is not negated but rather perceived to be in brahman.5' This is not a mere theoretical knowing, but a higher-level intuition. And when one misses the essential nature of brahman and the world, it is because one is bound by a false lower knowledge (apard vidya), which must finally give way to the true insight (pard vidyd) of a-dvaita. Realists and monists seem to be agreed on this point at least: In sdksdt-kdra the old perception of the world is gone. But they do not agree as to whether the "disappearance" of the old world is to be understood in the sense that a new perception of the world replaces the old one or rather that the world, which is an illusion, disappears altogether, once and for all. On what textual grounds and by what method might one opt for seeing Sarhkara as a realist rather than as an illusionist? According to De Smet, who takes a realist approach, we must properly understand the dacrya's use of language. Since Sarikara's point of reference in speaking about finite existents is the infinite brahman, it is clear that his language, which is implicitly comparative and value-oriented, will frequently employ negation in describing the universe and everything in it. Sarmkara is, then, "a radical valuationist who measures everything to the absolute Value, the Brahman, and declares its unequality to it rather than the degree of its participation of it. This manner of thinking and speaking is legitimate but it has misled many into acosmic interpretations of his doctrine."52 De Smet reads three levels of language in Samikara, which, rightly un- 556 50 D. M. Datta, "Some Realistic Aspects of the Philosophy of Sarhkara," in Recent Indian Philosophy, ed. Kalidas Bhattacarya (Calcutta: Progressive Publishers, 1963), 1:344-45. 5~ Karl Potter, Advaita Veddnta up to Samikara and His Pupils (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1981), refers to a similar realist interpretation of Sarhkara by Saccidanandendra Sarasvati: "On Sarasvati's showing Sarhkara is a realist. True knowledge does not remove the objects of the world but rather removes our false awareness of them" (pp. 79-80). 52 De Smet, "Origin" (n. 36 above), p. 275. Klaus Klostermaier, A Survey of Hinduism (Al- bany, N.Y.: SUNY Press, 1994), remarks similarly: "To understand Safikara's statements one must always see them in the frame of reference in which they are made: all his assertions are explicit or implicit comparisons with absolute reality, which alone is of interest to him" (p. 415).</page><page sequence="17">Sarihkara's Para Brahman derstood, free the acatrya's ontology from a monistic rendering. He calls these three levels "ordinary," "Upanisadic," and "commentatorial."53 "Or- dinary" language provides the foundation for the other two types. It com- prises the normal meanings of everyday speech. "Upanisadic" language, by contrast, absolutizes ordinary meanings and makes them signify the supreme reality, for example, as Being, Consciousness, Self, and then de- notes all lesser existents through the negation of these same terms: beings are non-Being, non-Self, and so forth. That is, worldly entities do not enjoy the same degree of reality as does the Absolute.54 They are contin- gent and pervaded by their Source. In the third level of language, "com- mentatorial," Samrkara explains the proper application of terms for the Absolute via the process of (1) superimposition (adhydsa) or attempted predication of the Absolute using ordinary meanings of words, followed by (2) negation (apavdda) or elimination of the finite meanings of these terms, culminating in (3) a proper supreme indication (paramartha- laksana) of brahman.55 Let us see how this theory of language applies concretely to the being of the Absolute and the very different being of creatures, keeping in mind that the original Sanskrit knows no distinction between capital and lower- case letters. De Smet writes: Shankara uses the terms "being" and "non-being" on different levels which we may clarify with a judicious use of capital and small letters. On the level of ordi- nary language, creaturely effects and their Cause are beings (sat), are imbued with existence (sattd) .... Yet, Brahman transcends so immensely its effects that compared to them it must be said to be non-being (a-sat). This consideration is the root of apophatism. But Brahman is not absolute Non-being (atyanta Asat) for it is non-being simply because it is absolute Being (atyanta Sat), i.e. Being in the supreme sense of the term (paramdrthatah. Sat). And now we have to say that com- pared to it creatures are non-Being (a-Sat) although they are not absolute Non- being (Asat). They are, he says, Sad-Asad-vilakshana, unable to be denoted by ei- ther Sat (Being) or Asat (Non-being) if these terms are taken in their supreme sense. This is the level of language on which Shankara's teaching moves generally because his centre of reference is the Absolute rather than the relative existent.56 557 53 De Smet, "Forward Steps" (n. 36 above), pp. 44-45. 54 Ibid., p. 54. For other uses of the word "unreal," see Richard Brooks, "The Meaning of 'Real' in Advaita Vedfnta," Philosophy East and West 19 (1969): 392. 55 De Smet, "Forward Steps," p. 45. 56 De Smet, "Origin," pp. 274-75. In a review of Hacker's Kleine Schriften (n. 4 above), De Smet lauds that scholar's many contributions to Samkara studies but regrets that Hacker "never really entered into a perspective which I consider fundamental to Safikara's under- taking. I mean Safikara's perception that the theological language of the Upanisads is radi- cally analogical." The review is in the Boletin de la Asociacion Espaniola de Orientalistas 16 (1980): 267-73, esp. 273. Presumably, such an understanding of language might have prevented Hacker from embracing an illusionistic interpretation of Sarinkara's ontology.</page><page sequence="18">The Journal of Religion Such an argument underscores the possibility of giving a realist inter- pretation to Samkara's ontology, for Sarhkara will sometimes use the word "unreal" or "non-being" of something that might, in fact, be regarded as relatively real. In the realist view it is not the world that disappears but false perception. In BrSOBh 111.2.21 Sarikara declares as much when he states that, if the world were truly annihilated through the knowledge of brahman, it would have been destroyed by the first person to have at- tained liberation. On the basis of ontological realism, it would seem that the way might be paved for the recognition of a relational Absolute. But is Sarhkara's Absolute relational? Has not the para brahman been defined as devoid of relation? And did not Sarikara's two definitions of brahman necessitate the ontological separation of a relational Lord from the nonrelational brahman? 3. The definitions of brahman in a realist ontology.--It may now be seen that, if the essential definition (svarftpa-laksana) of brahman is to be distin- guished from the relational definition (tatastha-laksana) the distinction need no longer be made on the basis of a monistic and illusionistic ontol- ogy, for our new point of departure is realism. And we must remind our- selves that the two definitions of brahman in itself and of brahman in rela- tion to the world do not yet imply any particular ontology. They are applicable to both illusionism and to realism, but in different ways. What they have in common is this: in both systems brahman-in-itself is regarded as the higher definition because a nonrelational conception most clearly indicates the independence and plenitude of the Absolute. But is then the subject of the relational definition an illusory Lord? In a realist view of the world this cannot be. In De Smet's words, Sarihkara "does not deny the universal causality, lordship, etc. of brahman-for they are logically entailed by the true fact of the world's ontological depen- dence upon it-but only that they affect the simplicity of its essence."''5 Thus brahman is truly and logically the cause and Lord of the universe, but these relations do not subject the divine essence to any change, nor are they ontologically additive to the divine reality.5" The relations of brah- man to the world as cause, Lord, and so forth, "cannot be ontological but logical only. They are not intrinsic attributes (visesana) but extrinsic denominators (upddhi)."59 Because brahman is absolutely simple and pleni- tude of being, its perfection is unaltered by the fact of creation. By con- trast, the creature's very being is constituted by its relation or dependence on its source. Thus, summarizes De Smet-and here his debt to Aquinas 558 57 De Smet, "Radhakrishnan's Interpretation" (n. 42 above), p. 62. 58 Ibid. 59 De Smet, "Forward Steps," p. 39.</page><page sequence="19">Sarhkara's Para Brahman is manifest-the relation "is real on the side of the creature but merely logical on the side of the Creator."60 The relation of brahman to the world in no way defines the ontological status of the Absolute. This is what Sarmkara appears to mean when he states, "Names and forms (i.e. the world's multiplicity) in all their states have their dtman in brahman alone, but brahman has not its dtman in them."'' The upshot of this discussion is that brahman's relation to the world, far from being illusory, is a "real" one (using the language of everyday talk), though it has no ontological effect on brahman. This raises further ques- tions concerning the nature of the creative Cause. Since the world is not self-existent but requires the creative intentional power of brahman for it to be,62 we are led to ask whether in fact such a brahman ought not to be conceived as personal. Since Sarikara himself does not explicitly answer this question, the next step is to proceed to a few brief philosophical re- flections on personhood, always keeping Sarhkara's texts as the object of our investigation. Here, again, De Smet will prove to be a capable guide. 4. Philosophy of person.-I shall basically restrict myself to two essays by De Smet that discuss the problematic of a personal Absolute and a per- sonalist anthropology in Samkara's thought. They are, "Is the Concept of 'Person' Congenial to Samikara Vedanta?"63 and "Towards an Indian View of the Person."64 De Smet's reasons for writing these articles was to coun- teract the tendency of Western Sanskritists and Indian thinkers since the nineteenth century to render nirguna as "impersonal" and saguna as "per- sonal," a propensity due in part to the philosophical reduction of the con- 559 60 De Smet, "Love versus Identity" (n. 36 above), p. 522. Panikkar (n. 47 above), points out that this understanding of relation, which is common to both Christian and Vedantic scholastic philosophy, presupposes that "divine causality is precisely of a unique type that results in a dependence which is only one-sided" (p. 145). As a solution that attempts to safeguard both the transcendence and fullness of God as well as the reality of the creature, it is "the least vulnerable philosophical attempt," a theory that "transcends dualism" (p. 145). 61 Taittiriya Upanisad Bhasya (TaiUpBh) II. 6.1. See also BrSfBh II.1.9: "Brahman is the atman of the universe, but the universe is not the atman of brahman." 62 See, for example, BrSfBh 1.1.5, where Samrikara makes Ts'vara synonymous with the higher or "primary" (mukhyam) brahman, which is declared to be the cause of the world's existence. The importance of this sitra for the brahman-ts'vara discussion has been stressed by V. H. Date, Vedanta Explained (Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1973): "One has merely to open the commentary of Sarikara on 1, 1, 5 and be convinced for himself, even if it be against great authorities, about two points, viz., that the cause of the world, as repeatedly told by Sarikara is the nirupadhika Brahman alone and that the word 'Nivara' has been put unambiguously as a substitute for Brahman. .... Sarikara appears to have deliberately used the word 'mukhyam' (chief) to qualify the word 'Brahman', so that there should be no possibility of assuming any Saguna aspect of Brahman as the cause of the world" (2:512). 63 Richard De Smet, "Is the Concept of 'Person' Congenial to Safikara Vedanta?"

Given this new limited application, it was clear that attributing personhood to the divine was tantamount to making God anthropomor- phic.65 The result has been inhibiting for the Advaita-Christian encoun- ter. "Today it is practically impossible to convince the Hindus that the personal God of Christianity is really the Absolute and as a rule the non- dualists among them consider that the Christians have inherited only an anthropomorphic conception of the Deity."66 This tendency has been helped along, as we have seen, by the Advaitic tradition's identification of Msvara, the personal Lord, with the lower saguna brahman, who is fre- quently an anthropomorphized version of deity.67 De Smet, then, sees the necessity of expounding a more traditional Western conception of per- sonhood, showing its suitability to both the human and the divine, not so as to establish a greater ontological status for fsyvara, as Hacker had done on exegetical grounds, but rather to show how the Advaitic nirguna brah- man and the deus simplex of Christian scholastic thought can both be re- garded as eminently personal.68 In what follows I will basically limit my- self to De Smet's remarks on the divine and refer only when necessary to his observations on anthropology. The person is "the ultimate subject of... attribution of all predicates implying intellectual agency,"69 a definition that is applicable to both hu- man and divine and that implies, among other things, freedom and intel- lectual consciousness: "It ... is immaterial whether the personal agent is in itself simple, partless, absolute spiritual substance without accidents, and thus pure Consciousness, or whether it is a complex subsistent, com- prising parts and functions, spiritual and also corporeal. What matters is that its integrality be predominantly spiritual, i.e. intellectually conscious. This, indeed, is required to make it subject of attribution, ultimate, freely responsible and an end-in-itself."70 The terms used to characterize personal being, of course, cannot be used univocally of both the divine and the human but must be applied 560 65 Ibid., pp. 53-54. 66 Ibid., p. 54. Reviewing his years of dialogue with Hindu thinkers, De Smet observes elsewhere, "How often has a Hindu told me, 'What a pity that you believe in a personal God."' See Richard De Smet, "Interphilosophical and Religious Dialogue In My Life," in Pilgrims of Dialogue, Fr. Albert Nambiaparambil festschrift, ed. A. Pushparajan (Ernakulam: Sangam Dialogue Centre, 1991), p. 6. 67 De Smet, "Indian View," remarks that it is therefore "understandable that modern Indian thinkers have hardly been attracted by the person as a topic for reflection or have perceived its interest only on the level of the human individual as treated in the various brands of modern humanism" (p. 54). 68 Ibid. 69 Ibid., p. 53. 70 De Smet, "Concept," p. 200.</page><page sequence="21">Sarikara's Para Brahman analogically to the Absolute, if anthropomorphic conceptions are to be transcended.

Thus, the question as to whether the para or nirguna brahman is personal must be disengaged from the objection that the higher brahman transcends all anthropomor- phisms. Yet even here the divine mystery is not fully penetrated; an analo- gous and elevated understanding of personhood succeeds in only prop- erly indicating that the divine is in some eminent sense personal, but it does not fully express the manner of divine personhood.7' It is perhaps for this reason that Julius Lipner adds elsewhere: "The Advaitic absolute is trans-personal rather than impersonal. Indeed, when he is constrained to describe Brahman-Atman in positive (analogical) terms, Samkara pre- fers to use such 'person-predicates' as 'consciousness' and 'bliss.'"72 Brah- man, then, transcends the ordinary human mode of personhood, but is surely not less than personal. When conceived in this analogical sense, writes De Smet, "there will be no doubt that we may and must say that Brahman even considered in the strict advaita perspective of Sarhkara's Vedanta is most properly and eminently personal, indeed the Super-person. How could the supreme Atman whose integrality is pure Consciousness and whose freedom is ab- solute not be supremely personal? Its very nirgunatva and akhandatva are the marks of its perfection and fullness as person. The term 'person' is therefore perfectly suitable as an appellation of the absolute Brahman of Advaita Vedanta."73 It is worth pointing out that De Smet's characterization of the person includes its capacity to "initiate the kind of bi-polar relationships which we call interpersonal,"74 relations that, as we have seen above, do not re- sult in any change or added perfection to the divine being and that are therefore merely logical rather than ontological. Further, the supreme Person does not relate to the world through necessity, but freely, a truth that underscores the divine independence and sovereignty. In the context of dialogue with Advaitic thought, De Smet does not go so far as to dis- cuss the possibility that the Divine might in itself be pure relatedness, independent of the world's existence. His purpose in such dialogue is to seek points of convergence between Christian and Advaitic views of the Absolute; he is therefore able to suspend discussion of Trinitarian rela- tions since Trinity is a specifically Christian doctrine.75 561 " See ibid., p. 201. 72Julius Lipner, "Sarhkara on Metaphor," Indian Philosophy of Religion, ed.

T. M. P. Mahadevan, for example, one of the leading authorities on Advaita in the twentieth century, is re- ported to have declared at a seminar in India on the concept of person that, "if the Brahman of Safikara is anything, it is surely not impersonal."76 That this came from an acosmic interpreter of Sarihkara is surely of sig- nificance. It marked, in the words of De Smet, "an important linguistic change."77 Since he was a mayd-vddin, however, it is unlikely that Mahade- van's understanding of person included any property of relation. The concept of relation, though now popular in Western theological circles as a predication of God, remains liable to misunderstanding in the Indian context. For Advaitins generally, the affirmation of a being's relationality amounts to a denial of its transcendence. CONCLUSION My reflections on divine personhood are purely introductory, attempting to sketch a foundational correlation between Samkara's para brahman, who is Consciousness itself, Freedom, and Reality, and the God of Christian theology, who is Spirit, Creator, and Lord of history. But to ascertain com- mon features in Advaitic and Christian doctrines of the Absolute does not even begin to exhaust the most important teachings which Samkara and much of Christian tradition have made about the nature of the Supreme Reality and its relation to the world, nor does it sufficiently indicate the enormous differences between Advaitic and Christian language about God. Sarikara, for example, is more disposed than are Christian thinkers to link reflection about the divine to language about the immanent Self (dtman), whereas Christianity cannot dispense with talk about God's love for the world, "for God is love" (1 John 4:8). But it is my hope that such exegesis and comparative philosophical theology will nonetheless be rec- ognized for their importance in laying a bridge between "God-talk" in two very different traditions and in eliminating much misunderstanding. 562 relations required here, due to constraint of time.
