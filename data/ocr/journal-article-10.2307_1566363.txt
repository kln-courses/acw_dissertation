<plain_text><page sequence="1">READYMADES, MONOCHROMES, ETC. NOMINALISM AND THE PARADOX OF MODERNISM J. M. BERNSTEIN If Schopenhauer's thesis of art as an image of the world once over bears a kernel of truth, then it does so only insofar as this second world is composed out of elements that have been transposed out of the empirical world in accord with Jewish descriptions of the messianic order as an order just like the habitual order but changed in the slightest degree. -T. W. Adorno, Aesthetic Theory Adorno's philosophy as a whole, and his aesthetic theory in particular, is irrevocably bound to the tradition and achievements of high modernism. Although Adorno himself did not recognize American Abstract Expression as the apotheosis of high modernism in painting, that judgment now hardly seems contentious.' And that raises a problem: it is the problem of R. Mutt, again, the problem of the porcelain urinal called Fountain, which was refused admittance to the Society of Independent Artists' Exhibition in April 1917 in spite of the Society's proclaimed democratic slogan "No jury, no prizes"-the work whose life or after-life begins with the beautiful photograph of it by Stieglitz set against the background of Marsden Hartley's The Warriors and that appeared shortly thereafter in the new avant-garde journal The Blind Man. Whatever the immediate repercussions of Fountain, there can be little doubt that much of what is most vital in art in the second half of this century is unthinkable without it; Duchamp's readymade offers an exemplary alternative to the tradition of high modernist painting that has continued to be generative. For a modernist like Adorno, for whom authentic art is that which best rises to the demands and necessities of artistic materials, for whom internal consistency and rigor would appear to be everything, for whom, finally, aesthetic form is the "objective organization within each artwork of what appears as bindingly eloquent" [AT 143; emphasis mine], Duchamp's gesture of simply naming or claiming artistic status for an ordinary bathroom fixture must be anathema. In this respect, Adorno's aesthetic theory would seem to be in the same predicament as Clement Greenberg's modernism: inextricably bound to a tradition that history has left behind. And while the option of refuting the claim of Fountain is certainly possible, and should not be too quickly suppressed (there is something in the claim that will forever be skeptically self-defeating), nonetheless there does appear to be an exemplariness to Fountain that exceeds the narrow provocation of Duchamp's nominalist gesture; something in the readymade, in fact, seems (art historically? aesthetically? conceptually?) irresistible. If so, then modernist 1.

After laying out the bold outlines of Adorno's formalism, the remainder of this essay will seek to uncover an account of the readymade in the context of what I will eventually call "the paradox of modernism" in order to locate in what way the readymade can be accommodated to a defense of Adorno's late modernism. For the purposes of this argument, I am going to assume that the best overall defense of Duchamp's gesture, which makes it foundational for the understanding of modern art, is that offered by Thierry de Duve in his Kant after Duchamp. My elaboration of Adorno's late modernism will hence proceed, in part, through a charting of some of the fault lines in de Duve's Duchamp. My contention shall be that the generativity of Fountain as readymade not only belongs within modernism, but is only intelligible within a wholly modernist and formalist frame of reference. Adorno's Formalism and the Material Motive Adorno opens the section of Aesthetic Theory entitled "Coherence and Meaning" with the drastic sounding thesis that "Although artworks are neither conceptual nor judgmental, they are logical" [AT 136]. He continues: In them nothing would be enigmatic if their immanent logicality did not accommodate discursive thought, which criteria they nevertheless regularly disappoint. They most resemble the form of a syllogism and its prototype in empirical thought. That in the temporal arts one moment is said tofollowfrom another is hardly metaphorical; that one event is said to be caused by another at the very least allows the empirical causal relation to shimmer through. It is not only in the temporal arts that one moment is to issue from another; the visual arts have no less a need of logical consistency. [AT 136] Artworks "gain objectivation" for themselves by virtue of the way in which their components are bound together. In the temporal arts this binding occurs when we feel that a second moment had to follow from a previous moment, that the movement from a to b was somehow right or necessary or inevitable. And this sense of rigor can be like an inference drawn from a premise, or like one event causally necessitating a later event. In the visual arts the demand for logical consistency is channeled through the traditional requirement that works be "self-alike," that is, that component parts of a whole belong intrinsically and not accidentally to the whole of which they are parts. But it is just this self-alikeness that underwrites a work's objectivity, since it entails that works lodge their claims on the spectator only indirectly; it is the internal relation of parts to whole, a work's immanent necessity which makes it "an interior" [AT 136] that is its claim to attention. What would directly appeal to the spectator, by being immediately affecting, for example, would make a work a machine for producing effects which would be worthless thereby-the machine either works or does not, and no judgment beyond that is possible. Good machines and good artworks are different animals. All this is correct but for the hyperbole. Art's logicality is not that of the syllogism since it is made without concept or judgment; and whatever causal nexus links events in a temporal artwork it is not a matter of lawlike necessity. Further, although everything appears in an artwork as if "it must be as it is and could not be otherwise" [AT 136], this is not literally the case. As in dreams, a feeling of coercive consistency is bound up with an equal sense of contingency. There is a sense, then, in which authentic artworks must 84</page><page sequence="3">be capable of sustaining the judgment that their parts do logically hang together while acknowledging that had different choices been made a different but equally binding work could have appeared-an event that is not unusual, at least in painting where the series is employed to establish a new logicality. But for Adomo this fact is meant to be expressive of a feature of art unique to it: in artworks the logical (quasi-conceptual) and the causal are not finally distinguishable-". .. in art the archaic undifferentiatedness of logic and causality hibernates" [AT 137]. For Adorno it is the historical separation of logic and causality that underpins the disenchantment and rationalization of modern social formations. Logic apart from causality is rationalized reason that exists apart from and independently of its objects and material presuppositions; hence, autonomous logic is the logic of exchange value apart from use value, bureaucratic rationalization apart from local practices, the laws of natural science as explanatory of the items falling under them, the laws of inference apart from the statements connected. It is the totality of these separations that generates what Adorno entitles, somewhat misleadingly, instrumental reason. In its naive celebration, it is said that autonomous logic is the "space of reasons" in which human conceptuality operates without causal or material constraint; hence the space of reasons is the space of freedom. Conversely, then, once experience is systematically deprived of its own "logicality," then all that is left are raw causal episodes, meaningless in themselves. In proposing that artworks are logical, consistent, internally coherent, and simultaneously causal, Adorno is contending that central to what makes artworks worthy of attention is that they transform the very forms of empirical experience, the reified duality of logic and cause, in a direction that deprives those forms of their external coerciveness. If art had nothing to do with causality and logicality, the very bonds connecting things in a disenchanted world, then, by that very fact, it would lose contact with empirical experience; alternatively, if in art causality and logicality were unchanged, then art would succumb to the "spell" of disenchantment: "The autonomous law of form of artworks protests against logicality even though logicality defines form as a principle. ... [O]nly by its double character, which provokes permanent conflict, does art succeed at escaping the spell by even the slightest degree" [AT 138]. Adorno's commitment to formalism is rooted in his understanding of art's logicality. Art's connection to the routine objects of knowledge is a result of its "implicit critique of nature-dominating ratio, whose rigid determinations art sets in movement by modifying them" [AT 139]. In art empirical form-space, time, and causality-and logical form are given a "refracted appearance" [AT 137] that enables them to relate to their material constituents otherwise. The consequence of refraction is that in works linkages are not conclusions or distinct events; rather, what aesthetic consistency generates is a "communication between objects" that preserves "the affinity of elements that remain unidentified" [AT 138]. "Communication" and "affinity" are among the terms Adorno employs in order to insinuate a potentiality for objects unidentified by standard, reified concepts to mean apart from their empirical meaning. They reveal this meaning otherwise by standing in relation to one another in works in ways that are both compelling and not capable of being captured by conceptual means. Above all, then, affinity and communication insinuate the idea of material form, of form as emergent from or implicit in art's material substratum [AT 142]. Artworks are illusory acts of an anthropomorphic hylomorphism. Adorno will go so far as to say that artworks "move toward the idea of a language of things..,. through the organization of their disparate elements" [AT 140]. In his elaboration of art's logicality, Adorno has been approaching the problem of aesthetic form sideways. The reason for his indirect approach is evident: Adorno is in no doubt that art simply is "identical with form" [AT 140]; but form traditionally is what orders a content or a material. In order to break from this notion of form while remaining 86</page><page sequence="4">formalist, Adorno locates the domain of form apart from traditional forms themselves in the transformation that empirical logicality and causality undergo when they operate within works. Form is the bearer of the different and manifold modes in which logicality and causality are intermeshed in works as their principle of order. ... aesthetic form is the objective organization within each artwork of what appears as bindingly eloquent. It is the nonviolent synthesis of the diffuse that nevertheless preserves it as what it is in its divergences and contradictions, and for this reason form is actually an unfolding of truth. A posited unity, it constantly suspends itself as such. Essential to it is that it interrupts itselfthrough its other just as the essence of its coherence is that it does not cohere. In its relation to its other-whose foreignness it mollifies and yet maintains-form is what is anti-barbaric in art; through form art participates in the civilization that it criticizes by its very existence. [AT 143] The full ramifications of this dense passage cannot be unpacked all at once; nor, it is worth adding, are its lines of argument accessible as here presented. Its full exposition is all but synonymous with what I want to say in this paper as a whole. But a small beginning needs to be made. Binding eloquence is the aesthetic corollary of (the unity of) valid inference and causal connection. Whatever in a work, proportions of space and surface or color contrast, provides compelling order is thereby form. Hence form in modernist works need not be, and at their most rigorous is not, different from what is so ordered: a field of color divided by a vertical line of a different color generates form. But the form so generated is nothing but the organization of the content. And if, as in this case, the form is so minimal, then acknowledgment of the form is had at the same time as acknowledgment of the "foreignness" of what is formed-the colors themselves and their vertical tearing. For Adorno, for reasons that will become clearer below, modernist works display their inherence in their materials by letting those materials--colors, paint on canvas, the rough brushstroke, the drip of paint-appear in their own right. To put it another way, the kind of form modernist works possess is in part dictated by what I will call art's "material motive." Traditional works of art arefor the sake of ideas and ideals that were presumed to exist independently of the material formed. Modernist works, Adorno contends, enact a reversal in which form is for the sake of what is formed. It is because of this reversal that modernist works must interrupt themselves: although artworks appear to demonstrate, through their forms, a binding eloquence of their material substratum, this appearance of consistency is just that-appearance and semblance, something that can occur only within the refuge of art, with its dispensation from practical purposiveness. Because the binding eloquence is semblance, and yet for the sake of what is being made eloquent, artworks can carry out their task of critically opposing empirical logic and causality only by suspending their own accomplishment. To suspend their own accomplishment is thus both to acknowledge the relative autonomy of the materials and, by this very fact, enact the reversal whereby form operates for their sake. Adorno's insistent formalism is utterly bound to the material motive. The material motive, like the formal motive of entrenching painting in its own area of competence, is not to be thought of as what this or that artist intended, but as a tendency or tropism in modernist practice that is visible only in its waning.2 Or better, only now in the case of painting is the material motive being appropriately recognized in relation to the otherwise 2. The case may be different in music. Adorno certainly attributes to both Schoenberg and Berg a clarity about the material motive that would be hard to cash out for paintings done during the same period. diacritics / spring 2002 87</page><page sequence="5">impeccable formalist analysis of modernist practice. So, for example, in reviewing the Museum of Modern Art's large Jackson Pollock exhibition (1998), Thomas Crow felt compelled to urge against both the Museum's own conception of Pollock and by extension the optical interpretation promoted by Greenberg and Michael Fried, an account that underlined the "literal concreteness, the obdurate materiality" of the canvases: The dissonant disabling of a represented nature made Pollock's canvases function themselves as the equivalent of nature, where the powers of the artist to impose form are strictly limited, where final effects are instead a matter of inducement and invitation, with the brute fact of the painting having the last word. [95]3 Crow's nuanced statement of the "dissonant disabling" of represented nature on the one hand and on the other the restriction of Pollock's power to impose form, hence "inducement and invitation," recapitulate Adomo's notion of a coherence that does not cohere as the release of the material motive. Gaining clarity about the material motive in Pollock's work remains urgent, since, in the setting of Abstract Expressionism, his work increasingly looks like an apotheosis, a last emphatic exploration of the systematic possibilities of modernist painting. After Pollock and Rothko and de Kooning and Newman, after Abstract Expressionism, if painting continues, as it does, say, in the works of Gerhard Richter and Robert Ryman, for reasons we shall come to it no longer does so as part of a larger systematic undertaking. The latter works can appear almost memorial, an ascetic exercise in remembrance of painting rather than the thing itself.4 It is the exhaustion of painting that after a delay of thirty years or more made the exemplar of Fountain appear, once again, promising. Abnormal Painting De Duve contends that Duchamp's own self-understanding invites the idea that the readymade "is a sort of abnormal painting" [KD 162].5 What is at issue in this claim is the idea that we must consider the readymade as a certain, paradoxical continuation of modernist painting, as a response to the exhaustion of painting, and hence as a way of sustaining the stakes of painting in the absence of painting. This thought is not too shocking if we keep in mind that the minimalist works of Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Carl Andre, and Dan Flavin were explicitly, if inconsistently, intended as responses to 3. Appearing in the same issue as Crow's article, a review by Michael Fried, "Optical Allu- sions," concedes that his own optical analysis was somewhat overstated in relation to the resil- ient and unavoidable materiality of the canvases. 4. This is perhaps not the best way to state the achievement of these artists. In arguing for Ryman as the last modernist painter, Yve-Alain Bois states his practice as the attempt "to paint that he paints that he paints; that he has always wanted, by means of an excess of reflexivity, to outflank the tautological reflexiveness [painting about painting] in which modernism has been locked. Further, his success is due ... to the fact that every failure of his audacious attempt removes him further from his object, driving him to produce objects that are increasingly enig- matic and indeterminable" [224-25]. 5. De Duve's exact reasoning at this juncture is wholly unpersuasive, depending on two thoughts: "choice is the main thing, even in normal painting" [KD 163, quoting Duchamp], and the tube of paint, as opposed to making colors oneself is a readymade. But even de Duve con- ceives of the notion of choice here as equivocal, and, however significant the tube of paint in re- forming the practice ofpainting, it does not thereby make paintings aided readymades or have the same impact on painting as photography [KD 176]. 88</page><page sequence="6">the impasse of painting and a continuation of trends in it (in the paintings of Frank Stella and Barnett Newman).6 What should be puzzling, in the first instance, is not that certain three-dimensional works, readymades and minimalist ones, are conceived in relation to painting, but that painting should be so privileged in this story that the legitimacy and meaning of readymades and minimalist works remain parasitic on it.' Summarizing horribly, de Duve offers a three-stage account of the unfolding of modem art [KD 377-81]. In stage one, in both premodern times and even in modem autonomous art up to the middle of the nineteenth century, "practitioners of a given discipline ... knew beforehand what technical and aesthetic constraints their productions had to meet in order to be conceptually identified as paintings" [KD 378]. There were technical and aesthetic rules of the trade that constituted what it was for something to be a painting and even what made something a good painting (although both technique and standards developed and changed); these rules were an implicit contract with the public. With the onset of modernism, de Duve argues, things changed. Painters began to challenge the taken-for-granted character of the previous rules: What conventions can a painting dispense with and still be a painting? What conventions can a painting dispense with and still be aesthetically worthy? Once painting becomes reflexive, an interrogation of what painting is, the unitary set that had integrally harmonized something being a painting and something being beautiful fell apart. Once, then, painting is no longer founded on traditional authority, painting stops being a (complex) unified concept and becomes "a word void of a priori knowledge about the minimum rules and conventions its practice must obey; it is no longer a concept; instead it has become a proper name with which I baptize the things that I judge deserved to be so called" [KD 378-79]. Stage three: What is the best way to articulate what is going on when artists break the old rules and propose new ones for something to be a painting? At one level, the correct answer must be of the kind: renegotiating their social contract with the public. But if this is correct, then it follows that all modernist artistic practice is best construed as presenting works of art in order that they be judged as such, that is, modernist art is shown to the public for "no other purpose than begging approval and/or provoking disapproval" [KD 380]. In exhibiting Fountain, a work from which all trace of craft and "every conventional alibi" that might allow one to identify it as a painting or a sculpture have been withdrawn, Duchamp insisted that it be "appreciated for its quality as a work of art, period," that the judgment as to the quality of the work "bear on the very fact of having to judge whether status [as art] equals quality" [KD 379]. De Duve's double gesture here is intriguing: on the one hand he sees Duchamp as opening the nominalist floodgates (confusedly thought under the idea of art being a proper name8)-since no 6. In my "Aporia of the Sensible: Art, Objecthood and Anthropomorphism," I investigate one small moment in this story: Michael Fried's attempt to categorially separate the achievement of Frank Stella from minimalism. 7. Needless to say, not everyone would agree to this conjoining of modernist painting and the readymade; indeed, most historians treat Duchamp as the author of a tradition that becomes postmodernism and is thus in direct competition with (a completed? exhausted?) modernism. De Duve recruits Duchamp for modernism; or rather; makes Fountain something like the apotheosis of modernism, what reveals its true idea. Whatever else one might want to say about Dada or Surrealism, de Duve makes a compelling historical case for considering Fountain in relation to the history of modernist painting. For the most part, I will be here simply assuming the validity of his historical account. 8. As several reviewers have pointed out, de Duve confuses the plausible Kantian idea that art, like a judgment of beauty, does not possess a set of defining conceptual characteristics with the idea of a logically proper name which is rigidly tied to the single object named (e.g., Aristotle) apart from any defining descriptive characterization. Even the extension of this idea with respect to nouns will not help since there the thesis is everything that is the same as "this" item is, say, diacritics / spring 2002 89</page><page sequence="7">conventions are essential to something being a work of art anything can be-only, on the other hand, to try to half-close the gates again (against the institutional theory of art and Joseph Kosuth's idea of conceptual art) by insisting on the ineliminability of judgment. The aporia in this double gesture is evident; once anything can be proposed as a work of art, on what basis are we supposed to judge? How is judgment to gain a foothold? What could conceivably guide or govern our judging? Comparison with the works of the past won't do since, by the example of modernist painting itself, we know some past judgments were premised on fully disposable conventions. And to say that time will decide whether artist and public were right or wrong moves in an empty circle. On de Duve's account the role of painting is fundamental only in that the dynamic of modernism whereby new works transgressively attempt to inherit the mantle of "painting" is generalized by Duchamp from painting to art, hence dissociating art from the conventions that might be instituted with respect to a particular practice (painting, sculpture, etc.). But this, I want to argue, atrociously flattens painting, since the key idea is one of a practice developing through transgression; and any such practice would of course require a moment of judgment, since the new rule is won, if it is, through appeal to the new radical case. This is an important and worthy idea; but how does it relate to art? To the model of painting? How did this flattening of painting occur? In fact, there are a number of stories kicking around here, none of which add up to the actual generalization from painting to art that de Duve operates. One story concerns Duchamp's own dawning perception that painting was no longer possible. Duchamp's feeling that painting is impossible is the subjective accompaniment to the "awareness of its objective uselessness in a society where the production of images has been mechanized and from which painting has withdrawn, like a relic from an obsolete artisanal past" [KD 171]. One response to this dilemma would be to opt for photography or film as Walter Benjamin urged in "The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility." But de Duve contends that Duchamp's gesture is for the sake of painting; Duchamp stops painting in order that painting can survive as an unactualized possibility [KD 171-72]. This is not implausible in itself; on the contrary, I suppose that modernist painting itself is like this: it paints the impossibility of painting in order to hold open the possibility of painting. Nothing here, however, will enable me to say that as yet. And even if it could be said, it leaves wholly undetermined why Duchamp, or anyone, might be nonetheless invested in painting in a manner that was not blatantly nostalgic for the artisanal past. The next story is owed to Greenberg. As late as 1958, Greenberg could open his essay on "'American-Type' Painting" full of optimism about its future. Only painting of all the arts was still a viable avant-garde project. In all the arts the movement of modernism is to isolate and expend those conventions not essential to it. Said this way, Greenberg's thought is that modernist practice advances by distinguishing the merely conventional from the intrinsically conventional; the latter being just those conventions beyond which a practice cannot go and still be recognizable as a continuation of its negated past. Conventions are overhauled "not for revolutionary effect, but in order to maintain the irreplaceability and renew the vitality of art in the face of a society bent in principle on rationalizing everything" [ATP 208]. Literature and music, Greenberg avers, have already located those conventions essential to them or have nearly done so. Things are otherwise in painting; it has "turned out to have a greater number of expendable conventions" embedded in it, and hence "has a relatively long way to go before being reduced to its viable essence" [ATP 208-09]. In "Modernist Painting," Greenberg goes so far as to suggest that modemrnism's "limiting conditions," emphatically for him a painting's flatness, gold or water But sameness is the last thing one wants for art. For a lucid discussion, see Jason Gaiger's review, "Art after Beauty: Retrieving Aesthetic Judgement." 90</page><page sequence="8">"can be pushed back indefinitely before a picture stops being a picture and turns into an arbitrary object" [8, emphasis mine]. It is worth noting that Greenberg fully endorses the thought that the vitality of an avant-garde practice is dependent upon its remaining progressive, transforming itself by more fully exploring its conventional constitution, risking more in reducing itself to its essential features, which conversely have to be more explicitly observed, more rigorously adhered to, the further the limits are pushed back. Literature and music have passed the point of dynamic progress. They are exhausted as forms of resistance to rationalized society. That painting could suffer the same fate is conceded by analogy with the cases of literature and music. As de Duve narrates the tale, correctly I think, the progressive analysis of art unraveled rather rapidly in the face of the 1959 exhibition of Frank Stella's black-stripe paintings. These paintings, in their adherence to the picture plane, look as if they were designed to illustrate Greenberg's conception of flatness; yet Greenberg did not care for them. I imagine him thinking the same of these as he did of Mondrian, that they were "almost too disciplined," too traditional in their "subservience to the frame" [MP 8]. It is as if, with these paintings of Stella, painting had all of a sudden broached its limiting conditions as such, as if it no longer had conventions it could expend, as if the energy of negation had been depleted at one go. What is surprising is Greenberg's surprise. Imagine a room with three large canvases: a late Clifford Still, all black with just a few barklike crevices of red, a Newman, and a Rothko. Seeing these together one's astonishment would have the form of near disbelief that these painters had avoided the monochrome; thought together and in retrospect, their art appears to be an abandonment to the claims of the monochrome while nonetheless avoiding it, just the slightest inflection-crevice, zip, soaking paint into the canvas-separating their pictures from the zero point of the monochrome (with the blank canvas forever lurking behind the monochrome). But we did not have to wait till this point to appreciate that somewhere down the road of the history of negations that comprise the advance of modernist painting there stood the iron gate of the monochrome, since almost simultaneous with the birth of abstract painting we have the examples of Malevich's Black Square and Rodchenko's red, yellow, and blue triptych. Is there anything in music or literature like the monochrome in being so identifiable an end (it is, after all, the telos of the process of negations) and exhausted limit (no further negation is left)? Certainly it is not implausible to regard minimalism as a continuation of Newman's and Stella's asceticism punched through "from the fictive depths ... through the surface of the canvas to emerge on the other side" [Greenberg, TNL 44]-in the form of a three- dimensional object. Nor is it implausible to believe that Duchamp spied this fate early on and employed the readymade as his way of escaping the threatening sterility of the monochrome. While this narrative has the correct shape, a central element is still missing. On this account painting is pivotal de facto only; the privilege of painting is only that it was an art practice whose modernist dynamic sustained the avant-garde till the moment it became exhausted in the monochrome, at which point there was no way to go on other than by crashing through into the three-dimensionality of the minimalist work and readymade. To be sure, once the breakthrough occurs there is a shift from painting (specific practice) to art in the generic. And this is what leads de Duve to exclaim that what was at stake in these struggles "was the name art" [KD 81]. But by itself that sounds remarkably hollow and tautological. What one wants to say is that minimalism and the readymade inherit the stakes of art, not its name but what is at stake in the name.9 What is missing in all this, I want to urge, is, again, the material motive. 9. Of course, de Duve does think that struggles for the name of art are struggles for its stakes, but his nominalism forces him to keep the issue of what those stakes might be indetermi- diacritics / spring 2002 91</page><page sequence="9">Nonart and Antiart Adorno imagines that once upon a time, in the age of myth, sign and image were one. With the "clean separation of science and poetry," there developed a division of intellectual labor that extended into the heart of language: "For science the word is a sign: as sound, image, and word proper it is distributed among the different arts, and is not permitted to reconstitute itself by their addition .. ." [Horkheimer and Adorno 17]. The arts, in the plural (music, painting and sculpture, literature), are for Adorno a repository of the elements of particular, sensuous, embodied experience that were found idle once the abstract sign-first the Platonic universal, later the mathematical sign- became legislative for empirical knowledge and practical reasoning. When the arts finally become autonomous (from magic, religion, metaphysics, politics), when they begin to articulate those conventions and limiting conditions, that logicality unique to them, they are thus to be understood, in their blasted fragmentariness, as articulating the binding rationality of what belongs uniquely to particular, sensuous, embodied experience. Almost. Very nearly. Not quite. If one understands the arts as having developed under the pressure of a rationality that wished to dispose of what was intrinsically particular, sensuous, and embodied, then they owe their very existence to a historical calamity, the diremption of the symbol into sign and image, or, returning to our starting point, the rupture of material inference into logic and cause, or: "the untruth attacked by art is not rationality but rationality's rigid opposition to the particular" [AT 98]. The arts for Adorno are a broken-off limb of rational experience that is broken, fragmented itself, each art inheriting the restricted experience of an amputated organ--eye or ear or linguistic sensorium-to preserve it in a space apart, as if in a bottle or box or glass jar. Hence the condition of the arts developing their austere late logics is their excision from everyday life and practice, their being sequestered in a domain without point or purpose apart from rehearsing, to death, these claims of sensuous particularity that have no place within practical experience. But this is to admit that their logicality has about it something riven and abject, not yet logical at all but a quivering-Adorno will say "suffering"-in its absence. Said all at once and so directly, this is not, I concede, an obvious way to consider the arts, although the deep peculiarity of pure painting directed to the eye (no matter how embodied that eye) and pure music directed to the ear is too little commented upon. Yet, if we hold it in place as a background hypothesis, a theoretical heuristic, some of the difficulties in the preceding analysis might be resolved. To be more precise, if we disentangle the various strands of the argument here, we are left with a singular feature of the story that neither de Duve nor Greenberg explains, namely, why is it the case that the very dynamic process of progress through negation that underwrites the vitality, rationality, and social significance ofavant-garde art is progress toward art's extinction? Isn't this the enigma of the monochrome, that it is both end as goal and end as death at the same time? If anything deserves to be called the paradox of modernism it is this. Let me begin with the issue of nonart and antiart. On Greenberg's analysis, and de Duve follows him in this, nonart belongs to the dialectic of modernism in being that moment in the appearing of a work when, in virtue of its particular disposal of heretofore assumed conventions, the question of whether what is confronting us really is a painting is demanded. If modernist works intend to make claims on the basis of their own internal logic alone and not on the ground of agreed convention, then they can assert their claims nate and open. Even more strangely, the final chapter of Kant after Duchamp can be read as a working out of the stakes; but now these appear as a radicalized version of Kant's moral philoso- phy-and hence very farfrom painting. diacritics / spring 2002 93</page><page sequence="10">only by emerging transgressively, appearing as transgressive. Nonart is the look of the new, and hence a continuing sign, for as long as it lasts, of avant-garde vitality. For Adorno, four elements, at least, are absent from this analysis. First, it is the issue of particularity. If what is at stake in art is sensuous particularity as such, then conventional understanding itself, of whatever sort, threatens the integrity of artworks. Once we can fully comprehend a work of art apart from sensuous engagement with it, once our understanding is capable of exhausting the work, or at least finding nothing in the experience of engaging with it that remains resistant to us, excessive and yet demanding, then the situation is no different from rational experience outside art. The particular disappears in its understanding or sheer familiarity. But this is equivalent to saying that in order for artworks to stand as unique sensuous particulars they must assert themselves as unique and particular, as an emphatic "this," as though they could stand all by themselves. Without sensuous particularity belonging to the stakes of art, there would be no need for judgment to be a permanent feature of art. Secondly, artworks are not unique particulars. They are images or semblances of unique particulars, sensuous particulars whose viability depends on their being framed, jarred, boxed. Modernist works signal this ambiguity in themselves through containing a moment or mode of appearing that is intended to collide with their logical appearing. Drawing on his musical background, Adorno conceives of this as dissonance. Dissonance is the crumbling of form, its dissolution; it is that moment in which the elements composed in a work return to their elementality, their abject separateness. So far as I can see, neither Greenberg nor de Duve acknowledges the inner disintegration of modernist works, their insistent undoing of themselves as a condition of their appearing. Dissonance, Adorno states, is the truth about harmony. If the ideal of harmony is taken strictly, it proves to be unreachable according to its own concept. Its desiderata are satisfied only when such unreachableness appears as essence, which is how it appears in the late style of important artists. ... The rebellion against semblance, art's dissatisfaction with itself has been an intermittent element of its claim to truth from time immemorial. Art, whatever, its material, has always desired dissonance.... [AT 110] Harmony is unreachable because if the elements composing a work could be truly integrated without remainder the work would be not semblance, but real, a worldly thing. Harmony is only ever the illusion of wholeness. Dissonance, say the obdurate materiality of a Pollock, dissolves the illusion in its very appearing. Hence, the momentary nonart appearing of a new work, its transgressive appearing, is underwritten, as it were, by a nonart moment in the work. To be sure, even dissonance can be "neutralized" through habituation and familiarity, and hence can stop feeling like a disruption or collapse of the work-all too easily if dissonance is conflated with the original nonart appearance of an avant-garde work. Thirdly, this intrinsic nonart moment in modernist works is meant to signal "art's dissatisfaction with itself." To state the thought directly: the claim of sensuous particularity will always be betrayed so long as it can only be registered in a consistent and systematic way in art. If art is the refuge of sensuous particularity, it is equally its prison cell. This inflects art's dissonant moment into something more radical: antiart. The idea of antiart "implies nothing less than art must go beyond its own concept in order to remain faithful to that concept. The idea of its abolition does it homage by honoring its claim to truth" [AT 29]. Adorno hears, sees in dissonance a rebellion against art as such, a rebellion that, with great optimism and nai'vet6, various avant-garde movements in this century 94</page><page sequence="11">have attempted to put into practice. But this is to concede that such avant-garde movements did understand something about modernism, which goes missing altogether when the dissonant moment in high modernist works is suppressed. As things turn out, only the aesthetic rigor of dissonant modernism is competent to honor art's antiart moment-not praxis. Such vindication of high modernism is, however, nothing to cheer about. Fourthly, then, collecting together the previous points, however dynamic the unfolding of modernist art appears, overhanging the whole process is something static and immobile. If art desires nonart, call it concretion, then each new thing in art, each new painting or composition or sculpture or poem is only a placeholder for that absent thing, the sensuous particular itself: "The new is the longing for the new, not the new itself: That is what everything new suffers from. What takes itself to be utopia remains the negation of what exists and is obedient to it" [AT 32]. By "new" Adorno tends to mean something quite categorial, namely, an item that is not reducible to antecedent conceptual elaborations, since, a fortiori, if an item were graspable by an existing conceptuality it would be something "old," already known, hence not new. In this respect, the new in Adorno is synonymous with sensuous particularity. Art is never more than critique; its novelty is never anything more than replacing one placeholder for the absent new with another placeholder. In continuation of this claim, Adorno states: Art is no more able than theory to concretize utopia, not even negatively. A cryptogram of the new is the image of collapse; only by virtue of the absolute negativity of collapse does art enunciate the unspeakable: utopia. In this image of collapse all the stigmata of the repulsive and loathsome in modem art gather Through the irreconcilable renunciation of the semblance of reconciliation, art holds fast to the promise of reconciliation in the midst of the unreconciled. [AT 32-33] Utopia is the condition in which the new could be new, hence the condition in which there could be actual sensuous particulars known as such. Art does not enable this condition to be imaged, even negatively. It can signal its absence by an exacerbation of dissonance: an imaging of what is broken in its utter destitution. Nothing I have yet said explains the paradox of modernism (or makes much headway on the readymade). But the whole completion/exhaustion issue must now look very different. Adorno's thought that there is nothing actually new in art is equivalent to saying that art's exhaustion or immobility is there from the outset, there as soon as sensuous particularity is placed in a practice apart from empirical, worldly, purposive practices. To put the same thought more exorbitantly, the elements upon which art works, its materials, are dead stuff. Art does not enliven that dead stuff; that is exactly what it cannot do, what it remains impotent before; rather, at best, art preserves and transmits its material in its destitute state.'0 Consider Jackson Pollock's Full Fathom Five. Seen very close up it contains "nails of various sizes, a disintegrating cigarette, tops off paint tubes, a button, thumbtacks, matches, a key, pushpins, pennies. The debris of everyday life" [Clark 300]. Now step back to normal viewing distance, and all that disappears "into the slow swirl of water and weed" [Clark 300]. Does the step back enliven the cigarette or button? No more than it enlivens the paint out of which the picture is made. The obdurate materiality of the paint, Pollock is exclaiming, is the translation of the button, cigarette, thumbtacks, key, and pennies; or more exactly, paint stuff is the 10. I have learned this thought, in full, from Gregg Horowitz. For its full elaboration and defense, see his Sustaining Loss: Art and Mournful Life. diacritics / spring 2002 95</page><page sequence="12">generalized equivalent of those things, what they are transmuted into in being reduced to the two-dimensional world of the canvas. Painting is the exchange value which renders buttons and thumbtacks two-dimensional. But unlike money, it is also like the key or the pennies, material stuff. Which is why, finally, painting can rid itself of representation and remain painting: the paint stuff stands in for objects by being one of them. Reading the equivalence in the other direction reveals that the fashioning of the paint material into the watery swirl of that familiar painting no more makes the paint stuff alive than it does the debris. But then we should not be shocked, since it is a condition of possibility of there being anything like painting that visual experience, its depth and demandingness, be excised, removed, hollowed out of everyday experience and become something almost purely optical. The draining of visual experience of its habitation in a three-dimensional world into the refined precincts, finally, of easel painting is the price paid for having a domain in which the material logic of perception is preserved. Autonomous art enlivens its materials the way embalming fluid enlivens a corpse. And this, I want to insist, is art's glory. When I said earlier that modernist painting is always about the impossibility of painting, that the progress of painting is the sustaining or keeping alive of the idea of painting, its actuality, by rehearsing or discovering over and over again its impossibility, it is this idea of art's a priori deadness I had in mind. Nominalism and Destitute Things Modernist painting is not quite the exploration of the logic of sensuous particularity, because in art there are no real sensuous particulars. Nor is modernist painting even an exploration of visual experience, since ordinary visual experience occurs in three dimensions. Rather, modernist painting is the sustaining of the idea and claim of such a logic through the wholly conventional medium of easel painting. As de Duve rightly underlines, easel painting is a concrete social and historical product: "Not until the Renaissance, when a painting began to be seen as an illusionistic window, did it detach itself from the wall, distinguish itself from the mural, gain mobility and autonomy from architecture and become 'a plane one or two inches in front of another plane, the wall, and parallel to it,' as Judd said" [KD 251]. Easel painting-with its load of historical specificity, including the idea of producing visual works that, in virtue of their new detached mobility, can be bought, sold, heaved about from one place to another like other commodities-is the bearer of optical experience. What enables easel painting to accomplish that end is precisely what modernist painting reveals. The austere logicality of modernist works is the logic of optical vision that easel painting permits. We can explore the possibility, in principle, of a material logic of vision only within the constraints set by the nonetheless conventional stretched canvas to which pigment is applied. Because from the outset this visual experience has been reduced to the possibilities of paint on canvas--denatured, then, from the outset-it is not visual experience itself but its after- image, echo, disembodied idea that we are engaging. And since that engaging has no other constraints or conditions than those provided by stretched canvas and the placement of pigment on it, then from the outset the project was doomed. Progress through negation was potent because, as it step by step revealed a disillusioned rigor within painting's visuality, it stayed one step ahead of the exhaustion that lay in wait for it. But because painting could neither break through and enliven its materials nor rid itself of the conventionality of its specific easel-bound, two-dimensional world, it could not avoid eventually meeting its conventional condition head on: monochrome and blank canvas. And what radiates from that condition is necessarily art's a priori deadness. This, I presume, explains the paradox of modemrnism. 96</page><page sequence="13">Nominalism is a condition for modernism and a threat. The nominalist bent of all modernist art is its railing against existent universals, the old conventions that attempt to constitute the meaning of works independently of the works themselves. Modernist works live off their power to negate existing meaning, the old universals, while nonetheless claiming meaning for themselves. In this respect nominalism is but another expression for modernism's idea of progress through negativity. But nominalism could not be that without at the same time possessing an integral idea of its own: that we be done with detached universals forever. Under the idea of "musical nominalism," Adorno urges this thesis in "Vers une musique informelle." A work conceived under the flag of nominalism must be "completely free of anything irreducibly alien to itself' or "superimposed"; nevertheless, it should "constitute itself in an objectively compelling way" [272]. And, inevitably, objectivity and being compelling will require universals. If informal music dispenses with "the musically bad universal forms of internal compositional categories-then these universal forms will surface again in the innermost recesses of the particular event and set them alight" [273]. Adorno instances the music of Webern, and contends that there was a missed opportunity for an extension of this radicalism around 1910. Whatever the case in music, the premise of my argument here is that the project of a painterly nominalism was in fact achieved in Abstract Expressionism, and that its enduring and doleful weight over art in the past half-century is due to that fact. More precisely, the dual requirement of satisfying the demand for objectivity while enabling the universal forms intrinsic to the practice to surface in the innermost recesses of the work turns out to be an exhausting demand: either the universal forms become external again through their exemplification in nominalist works, or, in the search for purity and in opposition to arbitrariness, the limit of the monochrome looms. Integral nominalism is nothing but the idea of rationally compelling sensuous particularity without external conceptuality. And this, I now want to claim, is the generative idea in the readymade, an idea implied but not satisfied by Fountain. Part of the permanent difficulty in dealing with Fountain is that it is truly an indeterminate case, instantiating with equal insistence a skeptical and an integral nominalist conception of art, and doing so because both forms of nominalism are effectively operative in the art history producing it. Fountain can be indeterminate between skeptical and integral nominalism because Duchamp's original insight is indifferent to the two possibilities. That insight is one I have already broached more than once, above all in my account of Full Fathom Five, namely, that painting is the reduction and preservation of the claim of sensuous particularity to the two-dimensional world of the stretched canvas to which pigment is applied. Modernist painting thus embeds three inescapable ideas: (1) painting is a complex exploration and preservation of visual rationality; (2) painting is pursued for the sake of empirical sensuous particularity; (3) painting rests on the, finally, arbitrary convention of stretched canvas to which pigment (or its equivalent) is applied. Fountain actualizes all three ideas. The complex art historical gesture called Fountain is exactly the same gesture as the thumbtacks and pennies and cigarette without paint or canvas; but still, the very same gesture and thought. The readymade is truly abnormal painting. Fountain is able to release (1) and (2) only by underlining (3). And while (3) is perfectly true, when underlined, made emphatic, it tendentially collapses integral nominalism into its skeptical shadow. Instead of the "slow swirl of water and weed," Duchamp simply issues the claim of art. What that claim signals, I am suggesting, is that although the logic of art is austere and indeed a logic, the historical calamity that fragmented the claims of the sensuous particular object into the differentiated practices of painting, sculpture, music, et al., entails that each practice has at its base an irrational premise, an arbitrary convention that permits its logicality to occur. Duchamp's gesture diacritics / spring 2002 97</page><page sequence="14">is the recalling and repetition otherwise of that arbitrariness. But art will appear to be wholly or only a matter of arbitrary conventions only if (3) is cut off from (1) and (2). So, more precisely now, Duchamp's gesture is the revelation of (2) by means of (3). But without (1) or an analogue of (1), we have the claim of art without anything that might support it. Or rather, Duchamp offers only a minimum of conventionality to signal "art": the urinal's being turned 90 degrees onto its back and placed on a black pedestal. But that level of conventionality invites exactly the wrong thought, namely, that any object can be perceived "aesthetically," as if the difference between art and utility were just a matter of perceptual attitude." That wrong thought, however, sequesters the better one that appears as the epigraph to this paper: art is a second world "composed out of elements that have been transposed out of the empirical world in accord with Jewish descriptions of messianic order as an order just like the habitual order but changed in the slightest degree" [AT 138]. In the readymade the obdurate materiality out of which artworks are composed reappears as the lost sensuous particular itself-thumbtacks, keys, pushpins. All the difficulty and the claim of the readymade hence turns on how they are "changed in the slightest degree." Duchamp's lesson is certainly that the "slightest degree" is going to be an arbitrary convention that recapitulates the historical calamity that makes art necessary. Adorno's addition to that thought, which remains equivocal in Fountain,'2 is that the inaugurating convention must be generative, that is, it must be capable of supplying conditions and limits that enable an alternative material logic to appear. Will not, say, a box with a glass front or a cell of wire mesh do? The boxes of Joseph Cornell and the Cells Louise Bourgeois has produced in the course of this decade I would count as amongst the uncontestable works in which the promise of Duchamp's readymade is realized. Even a minimal account of either would be immensely complex. In the case of Cornell's boxes it would have to include his relation to French poetry, his aestheticism, his attachment to theatre and dance, the ambivalence between nostalgic symbolism and modernism in his early works, the recurrence of images related to childhood. In the case of Bourgeois the big interpretative issue would be the relation of the Cells to her sculpture. Nonetheless, I want to suggest that both artists carry through the promise of the readymade without, finally, concession to either Dada or surrealism.'3 In both cases a frame, box or cell, offers an inaugurating convention, the sign of "art," that makes art a refuge and a trap: boxing preserves and kills, just as cells are prisons and the lowest level of life. And in both cases what is chosen to appear in the frame are remnants and ruins, debris; for Cornell the ruins are those of culture itself. For Bourgeois the accumulation of objects is more complex; sometimes the objects are themselves made, as in Cell (Three White Marble Spheres), sometimes they are routine objects like beds, chairs, chains, perfume bottles, mirrors. In either case the scene is one of past violence, sometimes an anonymous one in the lives of women, sometimes explicitly of dismemberment. In short the ruins of a Bourgeois Cell are those of the female body. But, and this is what I want to insist upon, whatever the symbolic load a box or a Cell contains, symbolic articulation is always curtailed and 11. For a strong aesthetic reading of Fountain, see Camfield. 12. 1 am here ignoring the question as to whether or not this extra thought is equivocal in Duchamp's work as a whole. Depending on how one locates Fountain within his output, one will come up with different answers to the question. 13. 1 am painfully aware that the set of unsupported claims that follow are to a certain degree at odds with the critical literature on both artists. My intention, however is not to flatten the complexity of their works, but rather to suggest, at admittedly a very high level of abstraction, what kind of complexity it is. 98</page><page sequence="15">then reignited by the forms of adjacency, contiguity, and juxtaposition that the inaugurating condition generates. Boxes and Cells provide each artist in turn with sets of conventional constraints that make the objects in those environments communicate with one another in accordance with a logic specific to that environment. By the nature of their relatively small size each box recalls the childlike fascination with the miniature: smallness as chance for controlling what in fact, in reality, one cannot control at all; the miniature as the wish for meaning in the overwhelmingly terrifying-protecting what one cannot be protected from. Because these boxes are not those of a child, they recall rather than instantiate that wishfulness; their work of preservation is memorial rather than imaginary. In the case of Cornell's late and more austere boxes in particular, in which more mundane objects are used, adjacency, contiguity, juxtaposition generate an affinity amongst the objects that is perspicuously in excess to their literal and symbolic significance.'4 Indeed, the very point of a Cornell box is that it possesses this form of excess, that it sets off a communication of its objects that invites interpretation while making any discursive accounting impossible. Life in the box, so to speak, is the lost life of each object on its own. Life in the box holds open the unspeakable promise of each object as forever broken. The way in which the different kinds of objects communicate in the different Cells is even more remarkable, since by means of adjacency, contiguity, and juxtaposition each Cell speaks of a different region of human pain, a strange history of pain almost.'5 The large size and construction of the Cells, wire mesh and glass, immediately bespeak rooms and homes; their contents always make the association with home turn into or recall the human body. I think of the cells as working in a direction almost exactly opposite to a Cornell box; instead of recalling a chance missed, Bourgeois gives to each object its precise weight as sedimenting a history of violence, either violence committed or violence suffered. And, what is worst of all, as we walk around and investigate the scene, become immersed in it, our complicity, in enjoyment and fascination, with this violence is announced. Indeed both boxes and Cells, by positioning the spectator with glass panes and wire mesh as outside looking in, transform art-looking into voyeurism: an impeccable rebuttal to the belief that art enables us to take up an aesthetic attitude. In placing us as voyeurs, boxes and Cells as the inheritance of the stretched canvas underline the detachment of art from life, art's being a priori dead. Yet in virtue of box and Cell, their character as inaugurating conventions, what appears in them becomes bindingly eloquent. I said earlier, and provocatively, that autonomous art enlivens its materials the way embalming fluid enlivens a corpse. Well, does not that description fit the abnormal painting of a Cornell box or a Bourgeois Cell? Doubtless neither boxes nor Cells are as fecund or constraining as the stretched canvas to which pigment is applied. And perhaps it does follow from this that the eloquence they enable is less binding. But that is only to concede that we are here in the vicinity of abnormal painting whose inaugurating conventions are somehow more arbitrary than painting itself. 14. For a nice statement of this see Ades 16. 15. Bourgeois has stated: "The Cells represent different types of pain: the physical, the emotional and the psychological. .... Each Cell deals with fear Fear is pain. ... Each Cell deals with the pleasure of the voyeur the thrill of looking and being looked at" [qtd. in Bernadac 121]. diacritics / spring 2002 99</page><page sequence="16">WORKS CITED Ades, Dawn.
