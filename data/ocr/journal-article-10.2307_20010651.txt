<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHAEL E. LEVIN FORCING AND THE INDETERMINACY OF TRANSLATION Quine has argued1 that the indeterminacy of translation is a more general phenomenon than the inscrutability of reference, the latter being but one pillar that supports the former. What Quine has in mind is clearly this. The thesis of inscrutability of reference is the claim that a referring term t can, faithfully to all data about the occasions of its use, be set equivalen to two referring terms t' and t" that are not codesignative. All three terms may belong to the same language; but it is heuristically effective to think of t' and t" as translations off. The indeterminacy of translation holds that there can be two translations S' and S" of a sentence S, both faithful to all data about the occasions of use of S, such that 5" is obviously inequivalent to S". (In some cases, of course, S' will be materially equivalent to S'f.) Again, all three sentences may belong to the same language, but it is helpful to think of S' and S" as competing translations of S into another language. The two theses, then, are not synonymous. It is clear that inscrutability entails indeterminacy. To see this, suppose a translation were determinate in respect of everything but terms. Thus if S(t) is a sentence in which a term t occurs, let it be assumed that there is only one possible translation of the open sentence S(...): call it S'(...). Still, S(t) can be translated as either S'(t') or S'(t"), which by the second part of our supposition will in general be inequivalent in any sense of equivalence stronger than agreement in truth value. ("In general," because this may not go through for all choices of S(...). For example, suppose S(...) is translated as 2 + 2 = 4 v = . Clearly (2 + 2 = 4 v t' = /') = (2 + 2 = 4 v t" = t") = 2 + 2 = 4, so here S'(t') is strongly equivalent to S'(t"). To guard against such cases, we may suppose S'(...) to be an atomic observation predicate.) What one would like to see, per Quine's claim, is a convincing case of translational indeterminacy that does not depend on inscrutability in this way - preferably a case of translational indeterminacy which does not explicitly involve the interpretation of terms at all, and throughout which the interpretation of terms can be held constant. This need is especially pressing if one has doubts about the Erkenntnis 14 (1979) 25-31. 0165-0106/79/0141-0025 $00.70 Copyright ? 1979 by D.

LEVIN "argument from above" for indeterminacy, which relies only on the underdetermination of theory by data.2 The rest of this note attempts to construct a perspicuous example of indeterminacy without inscrutability using the notion of forcing, the method by which P. Cohen established the celebrated independence results in set theory.3 Forcing is a relation that holds between finite consistent sets of sentences called conditions and sentences of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. In par? ticular, each member of a condition c is of the form "n e A" or "n $ A", where n is a natural number and A is a set with certain important proper? ties irrelevant here. We will not need the full recursive definition of "c forces/?" for every sentence/? of ZF. Three typical clauses - the basis clause and two recursion clauses - are given below, and these will be sufficient for our philosophical purposes: (1) If p is n e A, c forces p iff "? e A" e c. (2) If/? is ?q,c forces p iff no extension of c forces q (where c' is an extension of c if c' is a condition and c ^ c'). (3) If p is q V r, c forces p iff c forces q or c forces r. By the technique of G?del coding a sentence p of ZF can be construed as a set in (the standard model of) ZF, and a condition c, being a set of sentences of ZF, can likewise be construed as a set. Therefore, the forcing relation is actually definable by a two-place predicate F(c, /?) of ZF itself. It will prove convenient, however, to introduce "ZFF" to denote the system which results from adding the predicate F as a new primitive to the vocabulary of ZF, and the definition of forcing as a class of axioms. Note, furthermore, that since the only primitive expression of ZF is e, ZFF has only two primitive expressions, e and F. Therefore, any translation of the ordered pair &lt;e, F&gt; determines a translation of every sentence of ZFF (via the recursive formation rules for wffs of ZF), and in particular of every sentence of ZFF in which F appears. When one talks of a translation of ZFF, one must specify a language for ZFF to be translated, or mapped, into. This language must be reasonably rich, since it must obviously contain the full resources of ZF. Suppose, then, that to ZF itself we add the modal logic M4. Call this conglomerate system "ZFM".4 ZFM is rich enough to receive a translational mapping</page><page sequence="3">THE INDETERMINACY OF TRANSLATION 27 from ZFF; in fact, it turns out to be rich enough to receive two inequivalent translational mappings, and therein will lie our example of the indeter? minacy of translation. One final piece of apparatus may be helpful. I've talked so far of translat? ing ZFF into ZFM. Usually, however, translation is a mapping from one language into another, whereas ZFF and ZFM are theories. ZFF has as axioms the ZF axioms and the defining clauses of forcing, and ZFM has as axioms the axioms of ZF and M4. To make talk of translation here yet more precarious, what sort of data about use must our projected transla? tions be faithful to ? To clarify these matters, imagine a ZFF speaker who assents to precisely those sentences that are provable in ZFF, and a ZFM speaker who assents to all and only theorems of ZFM. Both may be re? garded as insensitive to events in the physical world (but see below). Imagine, finally, that we are trying to translate the talk of the ZFF speaker into the talk of the ZFM speaker. In fact, let's allow Mr. ZFM to wonder in his off hours how to translate Mr. ZFF's language into his own. Mr. ZFM wants to know what sentence he assents to means the same as - is the best translation of- some given sentence Mr. ZFF assents to. Since there are no empirical conditions of assent for either, the only constraints on translation are that theorems of ZFF must be matched with theorems of ZFM, and logical relations between sentences of ZFF must be matched by parallel relations among their translational images in ZFM. (This situation can be made to conform more obviously to Quine's idea that indeterminacy obtains even under translations that preserve stimulus synonymy. We could allow the theorems of ZFF to have stimulus meaning for Mr. ZFF. In particular, for each theorem B of ZFF there is some class 2(i?) of stimuli under which he would assent to B; and the negative stimu? lus meaning of B for Mr. ZFF is always 0. One could even require that, for all B, if ZFF h B, then I*(B) is the set of all possible stimuli. In either case, if B is not a theorem of ZFF, the stimulus meaning of B for Mr. ZFF is always &lt;0, 0&gt;.5) The reader who finds the anthropomorphic apparatus obtrusive can reflect that it is only a fanciful representation of the logician's idea of a recursive interpretation of a theory T in a theory T. One begins with a mapping t from the primitive expressions of T to the vocabulary of T'\ and one then extends r to a mapping of all the wffs of T into the wffs of</page><page sequence="4">28 MICHAEL E. LEVIN T' via a natural induction on the formation rules for wffs of T. The result (also called t) is an interpretation of T in T if (*) for any wff A of T, if A is provable in T then r (A) is provable inr. When there is no danger of ambiguity, the ordered pair &lt;r, T'y is also called an interpretation of T. The recursiveness requirement is important, since it is always and trivially possible to find some mapping from the theorems of a theory T into the theorems of another theory T'. In these terms, then, the indeterminacy of translation from ZFF to ZFM amounts to the existence of two recursive interpretations t and r' of ZFF in ZFM such that for any ("some" would do) wff A of ZFF, r(A) ^ r'(A).. As already noted in several ways, both t and t' can be specified simply by specifying what each does to Fand e. We can make matters even simpler by attending to their effect on just that fragment of ZFF which consists of sentences of the form F(c, /?), i.e. just those statements which assert that a given condition forces a given sentence. Our two translations are the following. The standard translation r maps e onto itself (e in ZFM, of course), and maps F to the relation of weak entailment, which is defined in ZFM precisely by the clauses of the forcing definition but for replacing the predicate F by the phrase "weakly entails". In other words, a set of premises weakly entails a conclusion when the set of premises and the con? clusion jointly satisfy some clause of the forcing definition - and this is what the standard translation maps forcing to. The modal translation r maps F to first-order entailment, and maps e to necessary membership; that is, r'("xey") = "D* ej&gt;". In terms of our heuristic device, t and t' are two analytical hypotheses Mr. ZFM can entertain about what Mr. ZFF means by his two primitives e and F. The relation F could be what Mr. ZFM means by weak entailment (if by "e" Mr. ZFF means standard membership); or it could be what Mr. ZFM means by entailment (if by "e" Mr. ZFF means necessary membership). It turns out that under either analytical hypothesis, all the provable statements of the form F(c,p) get mapped to theorems of ZFM. This is obvious, for example, in the disjunctive case. Suppose F(c, q v r) is a theorem of ZFF. Under r, this becomes "either c weakly entails q or c weakly entails r", which holds by the definition of weak entailment. Under t', this becomes "either c entails r\q) or c entails T'(r)'\ It is an easy result</page><page sequence="5">THE INDETERMINACY OF TRANSLATION 29 of modal logic that a disjunction is provable just in case at least one disjunct is. Since F(c, q V r) holds in ZFF just in case either F(c, q) is a theorem of ZFForF(c, r) is a theorem of ZFF, it follows by an obvious induc? tion that t'(F(c, q V r)) is a theorem of ZFM. A rigorous proof that r is an interpretation of ZFF cannot be undertaken here, and the reader will have to accept on faith that this is a standard result in the literature of this subject.6 What it means is that Mr. ZFM can make sense of Mr. ZFF's discourse in two different and incompatible ways. He can identify Mr. ZFF's discourse with a nonmodal part of his own language at the cost of introducing the unusual relation of weak entailment but with the advantage of sharing a univocal e with Mr. ZFF. Or, he can identify Mr. ZFF's dis? course with a modal part of his own discourse (a disadvantage, given the odd construction he must put on e) while construing Mr. ZFF's relation of forcing as good old entailment. Moreover, nothing Mr. ZFF can say can possibly favor one hypothesis over the other. All Mr. ZFF can do is assent to more theorems of ZFF. But this is something Mr. ZFM already knows, just as he knows that there are two classes of theorems of his own theory each with internal relations congruent to those of the theorems of ZFF. (This last point, incidentally, meets Bennett's recent objection to the in? determinacy thesis. Bennett argues that, in addition to preserving all data about the use of sentence S, an adequate translation S' of S must play the same inferential role in its language as S does in the language of S. But Bennett holds that "by any reasonable standard... two sentences [that play the same inferential role as well as preserve data about use] are syn? onymous, and so the indeterminacy thesis is false".7 But the inferential role played by r{F{c,p)) in ZFM is structurally indistinguishable from that played by r'(F(c,p)) in ZFM; and these two sentences are hardly synonymous.) Here is a shining example of translational indeterminacy, and what is more, translational indeterminacy which relies nowhere on the inscruta? bility of reference. The common domain of r and r are the predicates "e" and "F", and, by recursive extension, eventually the wffs of ZFF, and in particular those of the form F(c,p). Moreover - and this is the crucial point - r and r agree in the ontology they attribute to ZFF. Both agree on the range of the variables of ZFF. Both agree that the variables of ZFF range over sets of the standard model, and both agree on the reference of such singular terms as ZFF admits (i.e. set abstracts). What makes r and</page><page sequence="6">30 MICHAEL E. LEVIN t' collide is simply and solely their variant readings of F and e. Since the very mark of the inscrutability thesis is the availability of two faithful translations which ?foagree about the range of the variables they are con? struing, t and t taken jointly do provide a case of indeterminacy without inscrutability. A sophisticate might object that interpreting Fand e is after all a matter of interpreting terms, because both the forcing relation and membership can be construed as objects: the forcing relation is the set of ordered pairs that satisfy the forcing definition, and membership is the set of ordered pairs (x, y y such that x is a member of y. Even waiving the reply that these collections may be proper classes, this objection simply amounts to a resolve to take all expressions as terms, and thus quite trivializes the claim that the indeterminacy of translation is no more general than the in? scrutability of reference. This objection becomes especially pernicious when it makes one overlook the point, made a paragraph ago, about the ontological agreement of t and t'. Even if, qua term, Fis assigned different sets by r and r', the sorts of objects composing these sets will be the same - sets of the standard model. Both r and r map the predicate F to a set of ordered pairs: expanded into primitive notation, the logical form of the denotation assigned to F by both r and r is {x : (3y)(3z)(- y z Sex = (y, z?}. The mappings r and r differ about the matrix, but they agree in their interpretation of the bound variables y and z. This situation remains fundamentally different from that in which there is a pair of mappings, one of which interprets variables as ranging (say) over 4-dimen sional objects, the other of which interprets variables as ranging over momentary time-slices thereof. The subsequent fate of the two interpretations of forcing in working metamathematics lends support to one of Quine's ancillary doctrines. Quine holds that part of the reason for "failure to perceive" the indeter? minacy of translation is the fact that there usually is one translation with certain practical advantages, and we mistake this utility for a chimerical correctness. Something quite similar happens to r in set theory. What I have called the standard interpretation of forcing is the one used when forcing is deployed to establish metamathematical facts about ZF.8 This has tended to suggest that forcing really is a weakened form of entailment rather than simply being construable as a weakened form of entailment. Thus Cohen: "Although 'forcing' will be related to the notion of 'implica</page><page sequence="7">THE INDETERMINACY OF TRANSLATION 31 tion' it will differ from it..." (ibid., p. Ill); and he cautions again on p. 118 that "forcing does not obey some simple rules of the propositional calculus". The explanation for this is just the sort of pragmatic affair that Quine is calling attention to. Any interpretation which, like r, maps e to itself is called a standard interpretation. Set theorists are very partial to standard interpretations because one of the little conveniences of meta theory is the availability of a number of metatheorems of the form: if/is a standard (and transitive) interpretation of ZF, then / satisfies ZF axiom such-and-such. Thus, by restricting himself to standard interpretations, the metatheorist will be dealing with interpretations that automatically satisfy most of the ZF axioms, and his proofs gain enormously in elegance and clarity. This is why the interpretation of forcing which maps e to itself, and which necessitates the construal of F as weak entailment by way of compensating adjustment, so naturally suggests itself as correct. Propo? nents of the generalized indeterminacy thesis can take this as typical of the debunkings that can always be found for the illusion that one interpreta? tion, primus inter pares, is correct.9 The City College, New York NOTES 1 W. v.
