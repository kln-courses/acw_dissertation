Nelson I Bawling Green State University I and I Louis F&gt; Weschler I Arizona State University I COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY AS A DIMENSION OF ADMINISTRATIVE ETHICS Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis, 18(1): 13-26, 1996. INTRODUCTION This essay explores the ethical role of public administrators in fostering a high quality of life in communities. Fostering a high quality of life requires administrators to broaden their actions to include concern for improving natural conditions as well as socio-political and economic conditions. Successful implementation of public policy should enrich the community in all its dimensions. An expanded conception of environmental ethics, which differs from much of that body of thought, is needed to guide administrators. We offer a conceptualization of environmental ethics which places democratic, community, and sustainability values as top priorities. Using the literature of environmental ethics and environmental management, the conceptualization of the role of managers as conservators is expanded here to include the tasks of preserving established communities and facilitating new communities. Environmental ethics now draws from a range of perspectives from conservation and preservation to deep ecology and ecofeminism. Traditional models of environmental thought do not properly guide the administrator in sorting out contending values and seeking shared values. The idea of sustainability binds the goals of economic and environmental well-being together and seeks patterns of resource use that minimize the impact of economic activity on human and ecological health. International development ideas for sustainability demand that local people affected by policy should be included in the decision process (Kraft, 1996; Switzer, 1994; Wells, 1996). The idea of sustainability, in its broadest sense of fostering quality of person, community, and environment, may well serve as the foundation for administration action. The concept of the political community as a compact, self-standing social system in which democracy can lead to the fulfillment of social and individual purpose needs both refinement and expansion to serve as the unit of action. Few if any communities have such control over their own destiny. This is particularly clear when one considers environmental problems such as spillover effects, where pollution generated in one community moves to another via wind or water. Constrained community autonomy is also a given in the current American federal system. Communities, whether they be geographic, interest, or policy-specific, must first detect, then understand and build cooperation with the other communities that affect or are affected by each others' needs and goals. At times this will be a horizontal relationship, as between neighbors, while at other times there will be vertical and even diagonal relationships, such as when regulatory and natural resource agencies from the state or national level become important players in a local community's ability to set a course for itself. The ethical administrator, managing for sustainability, is called on to assemble and present the best available information and most important issues regarding the community's environment, and to facilitate community discussion and planning. The goal is to sustain the community, its resources, and its natural amenities. Sustainability of a community's natural environment is to be pursued for its inherent worth and also for what it contributes to larger scale ecosystems, biodiversity, and community life. The public administrator's role is to be a bridge-builder between the community and the other communities that in the long run share or affect its ecosystems and resources. In the rest of this essay we review the parameters of combining democratic and environmental values and the range of ideas found in environmentalism, environmental ethics and environmental management to illustrate the 13</page><page sequence="2">dimensions of this agenda for public administration. We consider the issues of community definition, expertise, and what is needed to manage for environmental sustainability. Community definition is an important consideration for initiating the types of discourse needed for sustainability. Expertise and the consumability of expert knowledge and opinion are always issues for citizen administrators, and one that has become a major point of contention for environmental issues. A practical view of sustainability can provide a beacon for citizen administrators confronting wicked environmental problems. COMBINING DEMOCRATIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES The combination of democratic and environmental values as ethical criteria for public administrators contains tension. Environmental values include concerns about opportunities and risks to present and future generations. Perhaps most problematic, environmental values often involve aesthetic perceptions which are neither easily measured nor uniformly present among the members of the community. Objective certainty about the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action or inaction unravels as variables are given different weights by different members of the community. Pursuing environmental values is politically risky for the many land use planners and administrators governed by bodies responsive to the representatives of the local land development interests (Logan &amp; Molotch, 1987, pp. 32 37). Leaders who deviate from policies and practices favorable to land developers often are dealt with harshly (pp. 230-236). Public administrators often find themselves facing conflicting values and problems that require interjurisdictional effort. Environmental problems are, as are most political issues are, wicked rather than tame. They lack neat solutions and even the criteria to tell when a solution has been found (see Harmon &amp; Mayer, 1986; Rittel &amp; Webber, 1973). Protection and sustainability issues are never truly "solved." Regulatory and natural resource management agencies are given the mission of putting boundaries around intractable problems, such as spillovers and the protection of common pool resources. The postmodern conditions described by Fox and Miller (1995) have added layer upon layer of symbols and rhetoric used to describe or deny environmental problems and ascribe blame. The issues are quickly cast and recast by position proponents and opponents in so many layers that it becomes an enormous burden to search for reliable information. Declining biodiversity, water and air quality, and waste disposal problems often require local actions for distant or aggregate and diffuse results. Despite this uncertainty, there are some threats that are too serious to ignore either for reasons of public health or because of the irreplaceability of certain resources or natural features. Democratic governance can be an obstacle to adequate and timely action. There is frequent disagreement over whether that threshold of seriousness is at hand, especially when such a determination is in conflict with immediate economic interests, and when public purposes served by the revenues generated from allowing economic interests to prevail are at stake. Fair consideration of the short-term and long-term interests of community members is a challenging problem for the idea of sustainability. The problem needs to be re-cast as one of generating common goals and agreeing to work toward them. Environmental protection has been primarily a top down institutional enterprise, with federal agencies developing and enforcing regulations and making decisions about what activities to permit on public lands. Lane (1994) argues that a high quality of life cannot be sustained without concern for human development and that many public policies fail because they neglect the capabilities of the people involved (p. 245). Among the most basic capabilities of democratic citizens is the capacity for self-expression and self-governance. Liberal, laissez-faire democracy, however, produces policies of self-development inadequate to the task of promoting individual self-expression and community governance at the same time. Schwarzenbach contends that "the thinness of Liberal community" lies in its tendency to look away from shared moral ends and to dwell on those values in conflict (1991, p. 561). Shared, moral ends are one of the hallmarks of a healthy community. A communitarian approach suggests that an administrator should manage systems of common resources such as ecosystems and watersheds in such a manner as to enhance the quality of people, the quality of community and ultimately, the quality of life. This requires attention to fostering shared values and to improving the capacity of communities to govern themselves (Adams, Bowerman, Dolbreare, &amp; Stivers, 1990, pp. 227-230; Warren, Rosentraub, &amp; Weschler, 1992, pp. 403-404). The situation of the federal public land manager provides a useful illustration of the dilemmas involved in striving for democratic community and environmental sustainability. Federal public land managers must strive 14</page><page sequence="3">to build communities of interest to pursue mandates of resource preservation (in National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges) or multiple use (in National Forests and the public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management). Federal agencies affect and are affected by nearby local communities, state environmental and natural resource policies and agencies, crosscutting federal policies, and a multitude of business, special interest, and public interest groups and individuals. These communities overlap in the federal system. Federal land managers are residents and community members (and sometimes leaders!) of the towns and/or counties they do business with. This makes them citizens of the communities as well as implementers of national policy. Likewise, elected and appointed local community leaders are themselves national citizens with a legitimate voice in that level of policy, as well as proponents of local values and interests. Rounding out this picture, ordinary citizens have a voice in all of these dimensions of local, regional, state, national, and world communities. Therefore, the values and ethics of community, administration require all the actors to deal with each of these roles simultaneously. Every agency at each level of government has a public involvement process for rulemaking, planning, and decision making; a mandate which by itself does not and perhaps cannot provide democratic problem-solving. This regulatory approach is, at best, piece meal and, at worst, draws administration away from a holistic view of the environment (Shrivastava &amp; Hall, 1994, pp. 613 618). Administrators conducting these public involvement processes must go beyond the rules, truly listen, and set up situations where citizens are encouraged to listen to each other (Stivers, 1994, p. 368). Meaningful planning for sustainability in any region that includes federal land must integrate the public involvement processes of numerous jurisdictions. Virtuous public administrators must find ethically informed ways to bridge the mandates they receive from the communities to which they are formally affiliated (federal, state, or local) with those of the communities with which they interact. ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS: FROM CONSERVATION TO ECOFEMINISM Environmentalism and environmental ethics express several different conflicting values and dimensions about the proper relationship between humans and the natural environment. A brief summary of some of the major contributions and distinctions between conservation, preservation, the link between economic development and environmental protection in developing countries, deep ecology, ecofeminism, and bioregionalism follows. Elements of these ideas demonstrate the mix of contending and often conflicting values confronting the administrator who strives for community sustainability. Conservation The conservation movement, part of the Progressive movement that swept government and policymaking at the turn of the century, sought to slow down the exploitation of the nation's mineral, timber, and rangeland resources and introduce scientific management in a manner that would lead to a continuous available supply for the American people. Gifford Pinchot, Teddy Roosevelt's adviser, was the most successful leader and spokesperson of this perspective. Conservation was institutionalized in the Forest Service by Pinchot. The Taylor Grazing Act initiated conservation of rangeland resources. The Grazing Service became part of the Bureau of Land Management through Executive Order during the 1940s, and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 strengthened that agency's conservation mandate. State Game and Fish agencies have worked to conserve and increase the number of game animals and sport fish in their jurisdictions since they were established. Current interpretations of the conservation movement are mixed. At times conservation is associated with the natural resource agencies, mediating between user groups and preservation groups. Cawley (1993) has shown how preservation activists successfully captured the conservation mantle during the 1960s to extend its meaning to the preservation of natural areas and wildlife. User groups and the Wise Use Movement have recently tried to redefine conservation again, to maintain or recapture the pre-1960s public land management pattern. Preservation The preservation perspective in environmentalism has its roots in the nature-appreciation writing and activism of Henry David Thoreau and John Muir. Muir in particular, through his founding of the Sierra Club to encourage people to learn to appreciate the wild landscapes of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and through his leadership in the effort to prevent one of the Yosemite Park valleys (Hetch Hetchy) from being 15</page><page sequence="4">flooded for a reservoir for San Francisco, brought national attention to the wonders to be observed in unmodified dramatic landscapes. Many authors have documented the reasons for the birth and growth of the environmental movement in the 1960s (Costain &amp; Lester, 1995; Gottlieb, 1993; Taylor, 1992). Urban congestion and pollution, promotion of and increased access to the National Parks and National Forests, and photographs of the Earth from space each contributed to the sense that the greatest country in the world was trashing itself. The environmental movement has burgeoned since the 1960s into a dozen powerful national organizations and hundreds of local grassroots groups. Among these groups there are a range of positions from preservation to conservation. The larger groups tend to accept some resource and land development, but fight to preserve what remains of the undeveloped American landscape and the habitats of endangered species. They also fight for the enforcement of the environmental components of conservation laws. The 1980s and 90s have witnessed the development of radical preservationism, illustrated by the activities of Greenpeace, Earth First!, and the Animal Liberation Front. In addition, many spontaneous short-term local groups organize against threats to their communities. The environmental justice movement has the support of the large national groups in calling attention to and trying to correct the disproportionate burden of pollution on low income and minority communities. This is similar in some respects to international efforts to unite and balance economic development with environmental protection. Economic Development and Environmental Protection in Developing Countries The relative blame and burden of global environmental problems has internationalized the environmental movement. Resource consumption in the United States and other developed countries is very disproportionate to population, compared to the developing world. Efforts of western groups to slow deforestation in developing countries and encourage sustainability have encountered resentment and opposition from leaders of those countries. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund have been severely criticized for contributing much to environmental problems and little to economic development by subsidizing inappropriately large and/or high technology development projects. The movement in international development to replace these large projects with more appropriate or intermediate technologies (advocated eloquently by E.F. Schumacher, 1974) was followed closely by U.S. environmentalists. Appropriate or intermediate technologies could also conserve resources and reduce pollution in developed countries. Efforts to protect tropical rainforests raised the question of assessing U.S. accomplishments in forest management. Some environmentalists felt morally obliged to assure themselves that U.S. practices were ecologically sound before making demands upon other countries. This led to increased scrutiny of multiple use management by the Forest Service and BLM. Similarly, discoveries of cancer-curing substances in the tropics suggested that there might be similar resources hidden in what remained of U.S. wild areas. Deep Ecology, Bioregionalism, and Ecofeminism Many of these diverse observations were brought together in the literature of deep ecology, bioregionalism, and eco-feminism. Deep ecology suggested that the many problems of pollution and over consumption of resources were symptoms of a deeper philosophical problem, which was the widespread acceptance in the developed nations of the notion of human dominance over nature. Deep ecology calls for a reorientation in human self-conception to one in which humans seek to harmonize their activities with the natural world rather than take or destroy it (Dobson, 1991, pp. 242-247; Taylor, 1992, pp. 95-103). Bioregionalism was originally developed as a positive alternative to the nuclear state and is now seen as a corollary to deep ecology. Bioregionalism combines the idea of appropriate technology with an appropriate geography: human communities would be organized around natural features such as watersheds, and would derive their economies and cultures from what was naturally available and what could be sustainably maintained. Bioregionalists criticize the "global monoculture" for inappropriately wrestling diverse landscapes and cultures into sorry replicas of itself. Ecofeminism suggests that western society's dominance of nature parallels the unjust domination of men over women. Ecofeminists link the correction of one problem to that of the other. Like deep ecology and bioregionalism, ecofeminism views modern industrialization and the accompanying mindset of commercialism and materialism as illnesses imposed on 16</page><page sequence="5">the Earth and its communities (see Dobson, 1991, for an introduction to a variety of these perspectives; also see Dodge, 1981). All three of these radical perspectives are dissatisfied with the environmental and community results of current political and policymaking systems. They seek change in basic attitudes about the relationships between people and between people and the Earth. While the question of political systems is secondary to environmental concerns, these radical perspectives prefer a communitarian-style of regime. In that respect, they are potential allies of administrators seeking sincere community discussion of sustainability. Administrators are caught in volatile cross-currents, many of which are based on ideological and conflicting ethical concerns. Sustainability may not go far enough as a goal for some of the writers from these perspectives, but they would probably welcome policy and management that would give as much regard to environmental quality as economic activity. Pragmatically, administrators must balance out these contending norms in their attempts to find guidance for developing sustainable strategies with different scales of communities, perspectives that vary from immediate use to absolute preservation, and the limits of both top-down and bottom-up policymaking. To cope with these wicked problems, administrators have to put a boundary around the definition of community, a boundary around expertise, and a boundary around sustainability, and try to make these various boundaries cohere. COMMUNITY DEFINITION The problem of locating boundaries is an obstacle to community-based environmental planning and management. Political jurisdiction boundary lines often divide important natural features. An ecosystem "is a biotic community plus its abiotic environment" (Noss &amp; Cooperrider, 1994, p. 9). Ecosystems, watersheds, airsheds, and other naturally-defined areas are rarely under the decision-making control of one public or private entity. However, coming up with more environmentally appropriate boundary lines is scientifically as well as politically problematic. Choosing among "natural" boundaries, one finds that different criteria lead to different results, and that drawing a new set of areal boundaries is a mixed achievement at best. One returns with some relief (but also with more knowledge) from that puzzle to the self-identified political jurisdictions to see what can be done within and among overlapping and adjacent communities on the matter of environmental sustainability. Affected and interested communities can serve as the starting point, even if they do not replicate natural boundaries. Public administrators are well-positioned to increase community and regional awareness of the relevant ecosystems, watersheds, and other natural features. Many administrators have a spatially-defined community to whom they are responsible. Incorporated local government jurisdictions and special districts have clear boundaries. Specialist administrators that work for state or national agencies have larger publics, but also specified responsibilities and jurisdictions with identifiable communities of interest, such as air quality, endangered species, or occupational safety and health. For the purposes of this essay, these primary jurisdictions will be called "nominal communities" to differentiate them from the communities that develop in order to collaborate on shared problems. The proposal is somewhat similar to McCollough's (1991) differentiation between primary and inclusive communities, but with two differences. First, McCollough's primary community is that of "face-to face" relations, home, and nativity. In contrast, nominal communities also include the organization and stakeholders of regional, state, federal, or international environmental or natural resource agencies, or agencies that affect the sustainability of other communities. Second, McCollough's idea of the inclusive community is an ethical and value stance toward all life, even the planet itself. While we do not dismiss this ethical stance, we are concerned with the mid-range bridges that need to be built between interdependent communities to foster sustainable practices. Nominal communities often assess their administrators' success in terms of self-interest rather than in terms of the broader interests of the region, state, nation or the world. Nominal communities often judge success by how well the administrator fights intergovernmental regulations, gains grant dollars, enforces nominal community regulations, and solves nominal community problems. Nominal communities often need to be educated about the extent to which they are interdependent with neighboring communities and their international, federal, regional and state partners,and to how that interdependency translates into the responsibilities of their administrators. Just as citizens need to learn how their self-interest rightly understood is served by the well-being of the larger 17</page><page sequence="6">community, so nominal communities have a self-interest that can be rightly understood (see Cooper's discussion, 1991, p. 154). Nominal communities are often divided internally on environmental or natural resource issues. Development groups are challenged by preservationists, definitions of risk are disputed, and the distribution of benefits and penalties are contested. Cooper suggests that administrators look to their communities for their authority as well as to elected officials (Cooper, 1991, p. 140). We extend that argument to say that administrators must proactively work to help that nominal community develop a unified voice to enable the multi-community collaboration needed to work toward sustainability. This task can be approached through long-range planning exercises, negotiation of regulations, alternative dispute resolution, and other available tools. Developing community voice in the nominal community is essential for determining which broader communities of interdependency are most relevant to the goal of sustainability. For example, a community experiencing seasonal water quality problems related to agricultural runoff may seek collaboration with agricultural groups or agencies to improve the situation. In turn, information about the nature of the larger context and related trends inform the nominal community of where it fits and what opportunities and threats are most important. The nominal community might discover its own contribution to water quality problems and work on improved practices, or help find financial support for changed agricultural practices. The articulated voice of one nominal community helps the larger community of interdependency understand itself better. The administrator's role is to build the bridges between the communities (For a related example, see John, 1994, pp. 85-123). The ethical identity of the public administrator then, should be that of the citizen who is employed as one of us to work for us; a kind of professional citizen ordained to do that work which we in a complex large scale political community are unable to undertake ourselves [emphasis in original] (Cooper, 1991, p. 139). The "us" in this ethical agenda needs help with the process of agreeing what work needs to be done. Cooper further argues that this resocialization process is never finished (p. 142). The virtuous administrator's "most fundamental responsibility is to encourage and support existing communities, and to give priority to policies, programs, rules, procedures and methods that will be conducive to the emergence of new communities" (p. 161). Intergovernmental relations over environmental and natural resource issues has become a major area of difference between the national and state and community levels. Administrators are hard-pressed to manage the competing policy and community claims and follow the guidelines for virtue outlined above. An example of how this ethical criteria creates a dilemma for public administrators is clearly provided by the widespread conflict in the western United States over the allowed uses of the National Forests and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands. In the late 1970s, the "national community" represented by Congress passed the National Forest Management Act and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act for the Forest Service and BLM respectively, initiating planning processes that extended the scope of interests which might be represented in local management decisions. Traditional user-groups, such as mining companies, ranchers, and timber companies, responded by seeking to transfer control of these lands from the national to the state government level. This movement became known as the Sagebrush Rebellion (Cawley, 1993). The Rebellion seemed to die down during the late 1980s, but many of the same policy goals have been revived in the 1990s. This time activists are working at the county level, and targeting the specific actions of individual federal managers and workers rather than seeking title to the lands. Financed at least in part by resource-based corporations, this anti-federal government campaign emphasizes the rights of communities, development-related jobs, and personal freedom against national environmental policies and federal agency implementation. The Sagebrush Rebellion reacted against the new laws; the new movement is combatting the "street-level" implementation of those laws, demonizing those federal employees who carry them out. Counties are passing ordinances prohibiting federal employees from limiting the activities of county residents, and in some cases bombs and other physical threats and actions are being directed toward federal employees and their families. Observers disagree over the extent of support for the anti-federal rhetoric, but it does seem to reflect something awry in the negotiation of community agreement in the eleven states that have large tracts of federal land. 18</page><page sequence="7">National Parks and Monuments and National Wildlife Refuges contain a land ethic within their missions. For their administrators, the increasing challenge is to persuade adjacent settlements and landowners to adopt outlooks and land ethics that provide buffers to protect the preserved lands from incompatible uses and spillovers. Preservation priorities limit local community members from some uses, but also create opportunities for recreation-oriented businesses and visibility for other community tourism resources. Federal managers are well aware that a united voice from the region endorsing preservation goals will go far to persuade elected officials at the state and national level to serve those values through policy decisions. An enormous variety of external threats challenge the successful mission of the Parks and Refuges, and some are so diffuse that the physical and policy communities encompassed may be hard to pull together for planning and agreement. Freemuth has documented this problem with several case studies (Freemuth, 1991). Criticism of federal policy is also rampant in the area of pollution control. Bitter complaints over federal unfunded mandates for safe drinking water, wastewater treatment, solid waste disposal, and urban air quality nicely illustrate the dilemma of community definition. During the government shutdowns of late 1995, environmental regulation was determined to be a nonessential function. Sometimes the problem of environmental mandates is framed as the need for federal dollars (the big community covering the little community's expenses), sometimes it is framed as federal ignorance or disregard of local conditions (testing for pineapple pesticides in Ohio drinking water), and sometimes it is framed as a federal takeover of a state or local function. State policies are not immune from criticism, either. The Not-In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) phenomena is often a protest against a state-level decision to locate an undesirable facility such as a hazardous waste disposal site. NIMBY groups are often characterized by outsiders as selfish, but they see themselves as exercising their right of self-determination. DeWitt John, in Civic Environmentalism (1994), notes that many federal regulations were developed in a period where state and local government capacities were relatively weak. He argues that state and local communities are now able to innovate and manage their resource and pollution issues very well. It is noteworthy that he also finds that the federal structure of environmental laws (national standards, etc.) should be maintained as the framework within which state and local governments can innovate. The United States EPA has become much more flexible in its accommodation of local efforts in the last ten years. The sort of accommodation and community-building innovations described by John are examples of the "some talk" of policy networks or "energy fields" found by Fox and Miller to be appropriate to the postmodern condition (1995). Their call for a decision-making mode based on discourse and their warrants for participating in such discourse are important for the sort of community and intercommunity discussions needed for addressing sustainability. In the high-conflict areas of federal land management and intergovernmental environmental regulation, the rhetoric of many participants often violates these warrants. The warrants could provide welcome relief from the fatigue of the conflict. The literature of environmentalism and environmental ethics also struggles with the issue of community. Scherer (1990) connects our mistreatment of the environment to the modern loss of agrarian-based (Jeffersonian) community. The anonymous individual is no longer linked to reciprocal, quid pro quo relationships, but lives in a transformed society. Individual actions have reduced significance. There are enormous upstream/downstream effects, temporally (affecting future generations) as well as spatially. One of the major issues that the literature of environmental ethics has raised is that our civilization, our government, and our policies have historically placed humans at the center or top of creation rather than as "a member and plain citizen." Aldo Leopold (1949) hoped that the natural evolution of human ethical thought would lead to a framework in which lifeforms and landscapes would be accorded respect for their inherent qualities rather than only for their potential to serve an instrumental human purpose. The implication for the citizen administrator is that human communities need to get to know the non-human communities with whom they share land and other environmental features. Some nominal communities are more prepared than others to integrate landscape and environmental quality into their self-identities. The natural environment and its features cannot speak for themselves in community planning and are not afforded the same rights. Environmentalists have put forth the claim that humans have an ethical responsibility to the nonhuman world. Some environmental administrators have suggested that this means constraining short-term human treatment of land when needed to ensure long-term preservation (Thomas, 1993). 19</page><page sequence="8">Communities can become more aware of those factors that contribute to or threaten their sustainability. Conventionally, communities have concentrated on money: tax revenues and their sources, and budget appropriations and the necessary political support. The environmental movement has called attention to the importance of environmental quality for community survival and prosperity, and the value of locally unique resources. Public administrators can call attention to the connections between the concerns of their nominal communities and those communities that have interdependent concerns. They can also facilitate the use of expert knowledge in informing communities of their risks and opportunities. EXPERTISE Ultimately the resolution of these conflicting norms, paths, and boundaries is going to depend to some degree on the knowledge and wisdom of the administrators. Local communities on their own can only handle concrete local problems. Environmental problems are usually crosscutting, without well-defined boundaries, and almost never only local. Under these wicked problem conditions, administrators need to bring a certain amount of prudence and restrained expertise to bear. Two distinct strands of expertise are intertwined in the public administrator's responsibility to communities and the environment. One strand is the conventional general * purpose expertise of managing and delivering public programs, with the ethical dimension of doing so in a way that draws on community self-determinations. The other strand is the development and use of the scientific expertise pertinent to the community's environment. Administrators will not be masters of all the relevant scientific fields that may come to bear on a community's environmental issues. Therefore, administrators need to make informed judgements about what kinds of statements, evidence, sources, and choices will be meaningful to the community and its values. Subsequently and reiteratively, administrators need to draw on the expertise of the community's members. Hird (1994) suggests that given the low risk that experts assign to Superfund sites, the money and prioritization process should be turned over to communities so that they can weigh the alternatives for local environmental improvement themselves. Landy and his colleagues also state the case for yoking expertise to the deeper responsibility of "promoting the constitutional democracy of which they are the agents" (Landy, Roberts, &amp; Thomas, 1990, p. 3). Government's responsibility for civic education includes informing citizens of the technical merits of environmental issues and encouraging citizens to take responsibility for collective problems. By focusing on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), these authors wrestle with the remoteness of the public from the concentric circles that move out from the "innermost ring.xomposed of the relevant specialists in lead agencies and legislative committees" (Landy, et al, p. 8). We argue that the large number of administrators in general-purpose governments and regional environmental administrators from federal, state, and local agencies are critically important to the project of civic education. Responsibility for different scales of environmental problems is broadly shared. Durant (1995) reviews recent experiences wrestling with politics and expertise at EPA as an example of how the current terms for dialogue and discussion are seriously distorted. There are many causes for the wide gap between citizens and experts on risk assessment. Statistically significant risk factors are difficult to identify, and there are many uncertainties in the methodologies. Yet the public, politicians, and the media demand cause and effect statements, which scientists are reluctant to make. Durant reports that 110 different Congressional committees and subcommittees have jurisdiction over EPA. Funding cuts have weakened the agency's abilities to produce and deliver the expert knowledge needed to support regulation. Durant sees a downward spiral. Funds for research at EPA have dropped steadily over the last several years, meaning that the agency is forced to develop regulations that are based on "science at the margins of our knowledge" (Durant, 1995, p. 37). This leads to court action from opponents and proponents of the regulations, which then leads to a more defensive posture at the agency, slowing action further. The gap has been partly filled by industry and interest-group sponsored research on risk, but these groups have not waited for independent peer review to announce their conflicting results. The media contributes to this problem by not adequately framing the sponsored nature of these studies when it reports the results. At the state and local level, it is difficult to sort out the rationale and validity of the regulations from the criticism received from both industry and environmental groups. Advanced policy analysts do suggest that many states and localities have the capacity to conduct comparative risk assessments within their jurisdictions, yet between mandated expenditures from the federal 20</page><page sequence="9">level and different degrees of support from the nominal community, there may not be adequate resources to do such a job right (Durant, 1995, p. 36). Durant proposes a "tutelary democracy" to deal with the rain of misinformation about all sorts of issues that is currently falling on citizens. He calls for a passionate assault on "those incentives, actors, and institutions who ~ intentionally or unintentionally ? debase our public discourse" (Durant, 1995, p. 42). Politicians, interest groups, and technocrats have a tendency to use language that is so complex as to exclude the average citizen, and so the primary goal is to demystify that language. We need dialogue that generates new ways of thinking about risk and other problems. He provides examples of successful deliberative processes as well as some that have run into problems. Providing a long list of helpful reforms, Durant concludes that their success would rely on a public awakened to the difference between "lean government and lame government" (p. 46). Durant's criticism of the conventional myths of democracy is close to Fox and Miller's critique of the orthodox model of the democratic system, in which it is assumed that the people are sovereign and that policy reflects their wishes. They provide several observations of current affairs to reveal that "the loop leaks at every joint" (Fox &amp; Miller, 1995, pp. 15-17). One of the issues of expertise therefore is that the public is relying on the high quality of the (expert) Constitutional system to run itself on behalf of the public, when in fact many different sorts of actors have learned to run it for themselves. This is not the same as blaming the public for apathy or lack of participation; both authors assert the right of the citizen not to participate. It is a severe criticism of those who violate the warrants for discourse, and a loud encouragement for citizens who care about an issue to find out the facts for themselves and become participants. The warrants for discourse are: sincerity, situation-regarding intentionality, willing attention, and substantive contribution (Fox &amp; Miller, 1995, pp. 120 128). Many public administrators have expertise in one of the relevant sciences or are environmental professionals for whom the issue becomes one of creating the settings in which relevant information can be made available to the community in as interactive a manner as possible. As Cooper puts it, "The administrator has the responsibility of upholding the shared values of the community, not through force, coercion, or administrative fiat, but through reasoning with his or her fellow citizens about the common good" (Cooper, 1991, p. 163). Professional natural resource managers are still trained in the Progressive style of Gifford Pinchot to see themselves first as experts responsible for the natural resource, and then as responsible to the public (Dorney, 1989). Some authors leave out the public. Taback (1995) states that the primary responsibility of the environmental professional is to protect public health and safety. He says that environmental professionals are also responsible to their employers or clients, to their families and themselves, and to the environment. The danger of the bureaucratic planning process itself running over local communities is still very real (Tauxe, 1995). Yaffee (1994), in a thorough treatise of the spotted owl controversy in the Pacific Northwest, calls for agency reforms involving new mechanisms to bridge the agency-nonagency boundary, updated approaches to organization management and leadership (in particular to be more cognizant of scientific uncertainties), to expand the agency's role as provider of information to the public, and to allow more creativity and risk-taking at the field level. The literature of environmental management suggests that the definition of environmental and natural resource management expertise is itself changing to include political and interorganizational skills. This is seen as an adaptation to the circumstance of needing shared information and multi-jurisdictional interdependency in order to accomplish agency mandates (Cortner &amp; Moote, 1994; Born &amp; Sonzogni, 1995). Stakeholders are recognized, but this implies a more instrumental view of non-governmental participants than does citizenry. However, both these sets of authors are skeptical whether the movement for greater openness in agency decision making has been thoroughly accomplished. Many examples have been collected on the experiences of interagency/public involvement efforts to plan the protection of natural areas and wildlife habitat. These are presented partly as success stories, but also as lessons in the limitations and difficulties of such collaborative efforts (Porter &amp; Salvesen, 1995). Jack Ward Thomas (1993) has pointed out that the policy goal of ecosystem management articulated by the Forest Service and the BLM are not likely to be a response to new technical information, but are rather a response to public and professional demands. Within and among the agencies, teams have increasingly experienced conflict between the anthropocentric and biocentric views of their professional members. Thomas reminds his readers that no course of action is painless, and it is important to articulate what is being traded off for what. Overcoming the focus on resource development is often 21</page><page sequence="10">a challenge to the administrator who was professionally trained to do that, yet Thomas finds there is broad public demand for a broadening of management interests. Cooper clearly sees the tension between democratic processes and administrative efficiency. The virtue of public spiritedness calls for the administrator to have "an inclination or predisposition to behave in ways that value and respect the rights and obligations of the citizenry (whether or not it complicates the administrative task, creates inefficiencies, or suits the preferences of the administrator)" (Cooper, 1991, p. 163). Much of our collective knowledge about environmental issues (problem detection, data management, the equipment necessary to control problems) is technical. The technical side of environmental issues creates a problem for informed citizen participation. The language of health risks, engineering, and design and planning are beyond the scope of the average citizen's comfort-level. The menu of public finance options is also difficult to read. Cooper says "It also follows that the public administrator should be held ethically responsible for encouraging participation of the citizenry in the process of planning and providing public goods and services ... [the public administrator is obligated to] inform the citizenry, provide the best expertise in conducting participation opportunities, and take what is produced seriously ..." (Cooper, 1991, p. 141). MANAGING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Cooper calls on public administrators to have the virtue of substantive rationality, that is, reasoning about ends and values (Cooper, 1991, pp. 166-168). This means seeking personal clarity about the values and ethical dimensions of administrative action, but also seeking deliberation among citizens and upholding the sovereignty of the people while making available techniques and knowledge. The problem of sustainability has been set aside by some environmental ethicists in favor of exploration of the issues of anthropomorphism versus biocentrism (Scherer, 1990). In part this is explained as a crisis that failed to materialize (at least in the developed world). Since the early seventies, the United States seems to have avoided the doomsayers' predictions of the effects of uncontrolled energy dependency, pollution, and waste problems. However, sustainability in economic development activities has become a very important consideration in global environmentalism, and has returned to the United States as a path out of the jobs vs. environment conflict in single-industry communities in the western United States. The President's Council on Sustainable Development (1995) has drafted principles joining ecological integrity, economic prosperity, and social equity. The different streams of environmentalism have very different conceptions of sustainability. Conservation seeks a sustained yield or harvest of renewable resources for society, and a careful measuring out of nonrenewable resources. Preservation looks closely at the price of resource development in terms of direct losses (of landscape features, alternative land uses, etc.) and in terms of indirect losses, such as whether proposed ski or oil developments would disrupt the path of migratory wildlife, or have a negative impact on another part of the environment. The international movement for sustainability rests philosophically on the recognition that humans are not masters but members of the Earth family (Kothari, 1990). Arne Naess (1990), a well-known deep ecologist, connects the search for sustainability with the values of cultural diversity, social justice, and a global perspective. He writes: Today there are few or no communities, societies, or cultures which show clear long-range sustainability, which I define as long range ecological sustainability combined with a satisfactory life quality. A development or general pattern of change within and among communities, societies, or cultures is ecologically sustainable if it is compatible with restoring and maintaining the richness and diversity of planetary life (in the broadest sense). What is "satisfactory" we scarcely need quarrel about as long as we agree that hundreds of millions of children live at an unsatisfactory level (pp. 95-96). Naess shares the communtarian concern for cultivating and protecting a dignified way of life (Glendon, 1995, pp. 27-36). Human dignity, a basic right in democratic societies, rests in some measure on the opportunity to enjoy high quality of conditions. Although Lane argues 22</page><page sequence="11">that a high quality of conditions does not have intrinsic value, an ethic of sustainability makes high quality of conditions a necessary part of government responsibility (Lane, 1994, p. 220). Governance that contributes to better quality of conditions may, in turn, lay the foundation for a better collective experience and, therefore, dignified way of life. Environmentalists have brought to the forefront the dilemma between long-term quality of life issues and short-term economic gains, whether measured as corporate profit or job retention in extraction industries. Bioregionalists in particular envision regional political economies that are based on the renewable resources found within the region. Such societies would be self sustaining through the avoidance of relying on imported goods or nonrenewable resources. Ecofeminists support this vision, and extend it to the restructuring of male and female roles in households. Judith Plant writes that "home is the theatre of our human ecology" (Dobson, 1991, pp. 100-103). Taylor (1992) finds that several critics have expressed concern that much of the currently popular writing on the environment and environmental ethics has a weak connection to thinking about social and political life. Taylor contrasts this weakness to the writings of Thoreau and Pinchot. Thoreau used nature as a foil to industrializing society, and Pinchot saw the proper management of nature and its resources as necessary for a just and democratic society. Recent environmentalist thought makes environmentalism an organizing principle for politics and community, even for a world view. Taylor finds that some authors are willing to override democracy if necessary. On the other hand, continuation of current trends may be a threat to democracy. Some environmentalists have argued that society's dependency on large private corporations and government institutions for the supply of resources such as nuclear power creates the potential for a very undemocratic centralization of political authority (Lovins, 1977). Environmental primacy is also criticized as irrelevant to solving real threats and problems and only somewhat committed to reason and science (Taylor, 1992, pp. xv xvii). Some radical environmental voices do criticize relying on reason and science to determine community decisions. As the earlier discussion of expertise shows, we may be at a point where the fruits of reason and science are being avoided by the affected publics or communities. Administrators are going to be more concerned with the ability to solve real threats and problems and to help their communities become more wise than with the philosophies or theories chosen. While the ideological aspect of environmental thinking is certainly a powerful force, it does not need to dominate a commitment to democratic values. Natural resource management authors have recently contributed some valuable recommendations for building sustainability that are applicable to other public administration communities as well. Yaffee (1995) shows how environmental conflicts such as that surrounding the spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest often become a catch-all for other regional issues. His study suggests that administrators need to create and contribute to regional planning mechanisms, that they should be cross-trained [from biology] to be skilled in negotiation, public finance, and economic development, and that they should be educating the public on the linkage between environmental and economic sustainability. The case for this interdependency is most strongly made by "the historic boom-and-bust cycles of many communities dependent on resource extraction" (pp. 56-57). He recommends that administrators scan the values and interests outside the agency, diversify their workforces, create decision-making processes that clarify value differences, inform and involve outside interests, get their staffs to support society's diversity, and do good science, watching for value-laden assumptions and explaining the results to decision-makers and the public (pp. 68-70). Kraft points out that state and local governments can promote sustainability through effective land use planning, and that there are a number of policies at each level of government that influence key elements of sustainable practice: energy consumption, population rates, patterns of economic development and ecosystems. Many of these policies are not directed at sustainability but influence private decisions that do have an impact (Kraft, 1996, pp. 193-194). Cooperation among communities is a key component of building sustainability. Beverly Cigler (1994) has contributed some important findings on the pre conditions for multicommunity collaboration among rural communities. Collaboration increases the complexity of purpose for participant organizations, and requires that actors and organizations possess the requisite collaborative skills. Other pre-conditions include a political constituency for cooperation and "a clear demonstration that cooperation has advantages for the participating governments," support from elected officials, supportive programs provided by external agents, the emergence of a policy entrepreneur or entrepreneurs, and an early focus on visible, effective strategies (p. 45). Cigler also finds that a disaster 23</page><page sequence="12">occurrence and community fiscal stress are pre conditions to multicommunity collaboration among rural local governments. She recommends innovative capacity building assistance to prepare communities for partnerships and the associated organizational change (p. 54-55). Some possible examples of capacity-building assistance include: more flexibility in use of local tax revenues for economic development; state matching grants for local self-help programs; networks including electronic networks to provide local decision-makers with information about opportunities, benefits, costs and limitations of inter-local and inter-sectoral partnerships; and state or regional funding for hiring professional coordinators for multicommunity and inter-sector organizations. Raising the subject of sustainability and doing the necessary support work to help communities make meaningful choices adds another layer to the administrator's task, and makes it more difficult. Each community and its resources needs to be sustained, and each community has to be involved in the process. The ethical agenda for public administration requires the discipline to face the dilemmas of adequately involving and representing the members of multiple communities. COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE ETHICS Communities face a challenging set of tasks in reaching for sustainability. They must consider the interaction of their various ecological, economic, and formal institutional boundaries, skillfully use administrative and environmental expertise, and sort through the varieties of perspectives regarding the appropriate relationship between human activity and the natural environment. Community sustainability is a concept that has the potential to bridge many normative conflicts. It is in everyone's self-interest for the community to be able to sustain itself. As communities pursue strategies that enhance sustainability, they discover their mutual interdependence. Interdependence is the foundation of community. Administrators have an ethical responsibility to nurture opportunities for their communities to learn and talk about sustainability in all its dimensions. Ideally, communities will come to agree that sustainability can serve as a lens for planning and for choosing among alternative courses of action. Environmental and resource management issues are inescapably wicked. The nature of particular resources, shifting external policy directives, intergovernmental texture, and conflicting perspectives confound self-governance and agency missions. Administrators seldom, if ever, have sufficient tools to actually reach most of their mandated policy goals. Administrators dealing with these concerns often find themselves at odds with environmentalists, anti environmentalists, and status quo groups. Individuals and communities sometimes resist the recognition of mutually beneficial interactions. Depending on the balance among these interests, sustainability as a value may make life even more difficult for administrators. Facilitating democratic discussions is similarly inconvenient in some contexts, yet it is clear that to do so is an obligation for the virtuous citizen-administrator (Catron &amp; Hammond, 1990). Administrators need to help people realize the present and future implications of their long-range interdependencies. Caring, prudent administrators who can hear local values and help translate these values into interlocal, interjurisdictional and inter-group strategies for promotion of community will serve the localities, agencies, polities, nation and the world well. Enlightened governance can be promoted by administrators who hold to and who practice the best virtues of democratic leadership.
