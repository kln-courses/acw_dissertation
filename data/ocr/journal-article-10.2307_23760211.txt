Gillespie, Ponciano Ortíz C., and Michael Hay ton The magnificent stone monuments found at Early and Middle Formati ve period sites on Mexico's Gulf coast are the out standing hallmark of the Olmec archaeological culture. Over one hundred and seventy such monuments are known today within a relatively restricted 14,000 sq. km. région of southem Veracruz and western Tabasco. The distribution of those carvings helps to define the actual Olmec domain.

The cleft head has a very blocky shape and is completely encircled by a broad "headband" directly above the eye area. The facial features are damaged and weathered, but are dominated by a heavy down turned upper lip, a projecting bulbous "nose", and a large protruding "tongue". The eyes are not clearly defined, and the squared earpieces are broken off. With the exception of the missing eyes and the protruding tongue, the head's character istics and size (56 cm. in height, 43 cm. wide and 40 cm. deep) are remarkably similar to La Venta Monument 64 (de la Fuente 1973:111 ) and to the head of San Lorenzo Monument 10 (Coe andDiehl 1980:Fig. 434; de laFuente 1973:190-192; Stirling 1955:P1. 15b). Fig. 6: La Isla statue head "B" (La Isla Monument 1 b). Scale drawing based on measurements taken in the field. Because Head B and the torso from La Isla each resemble sections of San Lorenzo Monument 10, an obvious question remained to be investigated. Are those two pièces parts of the same monument? Although today the fragments are in two différent locations, Gillespie carefully studied them both, comparing their measurements, the shape of the décapitation areas, and the patterns of natural imperfections running through the basait. Her study indicates that the two La Isla fragments match exactly and belong together. We propose to designate them collectively as La Isla Monument 1 (la:torso; lb:head). La Isla Head "A" would then be designated as La Isla Monu ment 2. Comments Nearly 80% of the known Olmec monuments occur at just three sites: La Venta, San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan, and Laguna de los Cerros. The remaining monuments occur in small Fig. 6: La Isla statue head "B" (La Isla Monument 1 b). Scale drawing based on measurements taken in the field. quantities at approximately 15-20 sites or localities in the hinterland régions around those larger centers. Although the use of monument quantity as a criterion for estimating the political importance of individual Olmec sites has countless weaknesses, the concentration of monuments at La Venta, San Lorenzo, and Laguna de los Cerros is in large part responsible for their classification today as major Olmec centers. There is reason to believe that monument production and distribution were elicited and controlled by the rulers of the major Olmec centers. Those rulers may have solidified their support from client (sub-regional) chiefs through gifts which sometimes included monuments. It is therefore possible that the presence of one or several monuments at smaller Olmec sites may indicate that they had been sub-regional (secondary) centers at some time in their history. Sub-regional centers, in turn, may have administered numerous villages and hamlets, Settlements which would not have received monumental art. The fact that during the Middle Formative period La Isla was important enough to warrant at least two monuments suggests it might have been a secondary center of Laguna de los Cerros. Sites with single monuments such as Las Choapas, Cruz del Milagro, and Cuauhtotolapan Viejo (de la Fuente 1973:127 130,161-162) may also have been second level Settlements within the hinterlands of La Venta, San Lorenzo, and Laguna de los Cerros respectively. Not all Olmec monuments occur in association with Olmec Settlements. Some were erected in isolated locations. The San Martin Pajapan monument (Medellin 1968; de la Fuente 1973:242-244), for example, had been placed in what must have been a sacred, revered location, the summit of a volcano. However, understanding the placement of the Loma de la Piedra and El Cardonal monuments is more difficult, for their locations are not geographically distinctive or unique. We presently suspect that those latter monuments may have served as some form of boundary marker, perhaps delimiting either sacred or political space. We will continue to investígate that hypothesis in our future research. Notes 1. Grove, Ortíz, and Gillespie began exploratory research and project préparation in 1989. Ortíz was unable to particípate in the 1991 fieldwork, but served as consultant and assisted in the laboratory analyses. Michael Hayton participated in 1991 as assistant cartographer and archaeologist. Investigations and mapping at La Isla were carried out with grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Geographie Society. Gillespie's research at Llano del Jícaro was supported by the Wenner-Gren Foundation. We thank INAH for permission to conduct this research and for their invaluable help, and thank the people of the municipio of Hueyapan de Ocampo for their friendship and assistance. 2. Medellín (1960:92) reported four "monoliths" at the site, and numbered them collectively with the monuments from Laguna de los Cerros. The only Llano del Jícaro monument published by Medellín is "Laguna de los Cerros Monument 8", a large unfinished statue of a seated anthropomorphic figure which Medellín transponed to Xalapa ( 1960:92-93, Lam. 21,22). According to Ortíz, a large unfinished altar at Llano del Jícaro had also been investigated by Medellín, and Gillespie's excavations at that carving found evidence of Medellin's earlier explorations. It is unclear which, if any, of the other unfinished carvings at the site are those mentioned by Medellín. 3. The results of the Llano del Jícaro and La Isla fieldwork will appear in other publications. 4. Hueyapan de Ocampo should not be confused with the hacienda, village, or arroyo Hueyapan which were frequently mentioned by Matthew Stirling in his writings on Tres Zapotes. 5. The two monuments are listed in the records of the Xalapa Museum of Anthropology as from Hueyapan de Ocampo rather than La Isla (Winfield Capitane 1987:Plano 024, 027).</page><page sequence="5">References cited Bove, Frederick J. 1978 Laguna de los Cerros: An Olmec Central Place.

ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Fünf olmekische Skulpturen aus der Region von Laguna de los Cerros: Während archäologischer Untersuchungen im Gebiet dieses olmekischen Zentrums, machten im Jahr 1991 ortsansässige Informanten auf bisher unbekannte Skulpturen in Loma de la Piedra, El Cardonal und La Isla aufmerksam. Zwei der zum Teil stark zerstörten Skulpturen wurden auf Anhöhen gefunden, ohne direkten Bezug zu olmekischen Ansiedlungen, und die Autoren vermuten dahinter eine Art von Grenzmarkierung. RESUMEN : Cinco esculturas olmecas de la región de Laguna de los Cerros: Durante unas exploraciones arqueológicas en la zona de ese centro olmeca, en el año 1991, informantes vecinos del lugar llamaron la atención sobre la presencia de esculturas hasta ese entonces desconocidos en Loma de la Piedra, El Cardonal y La Isla. Dos de las esculturas, en parte deterioradas, fueron descubiertas en elevaciones, sin estar aparentemente relacionadas en forma directa con poblaciones olmecas. Los autores suponen que servían a modo de demarcación fronteriza.</page></plain_text>
