<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chimpanzees: A Laboratory Colony. By ROBERT M. YERKES. New Haven, Yale University Press, 1943. Pp. xv, 321. Thanks to the author and his collaborators our knowledge of chimpan- zees has grown considerably since The Great Apes appeared some fifteen years ago. This is quite apparent when Chimpanzees is compared with the earlier volume. Both treatments are of about equal length, but the earlier one had little research behind it. To a very great extent, it was a bringing together of the opinions of 'authorities.' The small amount of research ma- terial available at that time had been done by Kohts, K6hler and Yerkes. The latter had then contributed but one research on the behavior of chim- panzees. The present volume refers, although at times only incidentally, to about one hundred researches, mostly done by the author and his twenty- three associates.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 125 Although an epitome of the studies of Yerkes and his associates might well have been undertaken, this book uses research data largely as a point of departure for various observations on personality among chimpanzees and on human life. The expressed purpose is to present "a portrait of chimpanzee personality done in terms of behavior" and to address the general reader interested in animal life rather than the professional psy- chologist. The latter may nevertheless enjoy the author's inferences, his interesting annecdotes, and his sympathetic and, at times, anthropomorphic interpretations. Every reader will appreciate the profusion of excellent anthropoid portraits by Helmle and the many pictures of experimental situations and apparatus. Some of the latter, incidentally, are inserted with- out comment or description of any kind. A good example of the author's generous interpretation of data comes from his discussion of male-female relations in the competitive food-situa- tion. The observations show reversal of dominance when the female is in the stage of maximal genital swelling. At this time she takes all or nearly all of the food inserted into the cage through a chute. This reversal "surely does not depend upon change in the dominance drive. Rather the behavior of each mate seems to change in correlation with their sexual relations, and the female comes to claim as if it were her right what previously she had allowed the male to take, while he, as if in recognition of or in exchange for sexual accommodation during the mating period, defers to her and unprotestingly permits her to control the food-getting situation." Sometimes, as in the discussion of handedness, the author uses his facts as a point of departure for a general discourse on the shortcomings of human society. A graph, based on a research which is not described, shows that right-handedness, left-handedness and ambidexterity are about equally prevalent in chimpanzees. Using this as a basis, the author says that "although conformity to pattern assures social convenience, it seems entirely legitimate to enquire whether society in this matter gains enough by regi- mentation of the individual to compensate for the loss in effort and initia- tive, extra labor, and possibly also the interference with neuro-muscular development which the individual suffers." The chimpanzee is represented as "free to act according to its natural characteristics and immediate matura- tional and other functional influences, while we humans, by contrast, are slaves to convention, having surrendered our boasted freedom of individual choice, decision and direction of effort by accepting a form of limitation which at best is inconvenient to a considerable portion of us and at worst interferes more or less seriously with our psychobiological development." There is, in this connection, no mention of possible hemispheric dominance in man and there is no presentation of evidence in support of the suggestion</page><page sequence="3">126 BOOK REVIEWS that "culturally determined" right-handedness interferes with psychobiologi- cal development. The book might well have begun with the epilogue, The story of an idea. This tells very interestingly and with all modesty how the author got the idea of starting a chimpanzee colony, how he worked toward the ac- complishment of his aim, and how, with the help of several friends, he finally, in 1925, began the Primate Laboratory at Yale. Five years later the Orange Park Laboratory, recently re-named the Yerkes Laboratory (al- though the author does not so speak of it), was established. This epilogue gives a brief epitome of what, in general, had been accomplished when the author stepped down and Lashley took his place. The prologue, which might have followed the epilogue, speaks of the chimpanzee as a potential "servant of science." Its advantages for research, psychological and otherwise, are indicated. Heavy stress is laid on what one may accomplish with chimpanzees, perhaps the animals closest to man, which could not be accomplished with man himself. One may well ask, therefore, "What has been accomplished with the chimpanzee that could not have been accomplished with man?" The answer, derived from reading the rest of the book, is "Very little so far, but the future holds great promise, especially if enough chimpanzees can be gathered to make operative pro- cedures like those used with rats and monkeys feasible." Such work would be impossible without the years of preliminary experimentation and the great amount of information on the care and handling of chimpanzees- treated in four chapters-that has accumulated in the Yale and Orange Park Laboratories during the last twenty years. Five chapters describe various aspects of temperament, consider social behavior, outline aspects of the life-cycle, and discuss various aspects of male and female relations. Outstanding topics in these discussions deal with capture and purchase, manifestations of emotion, parent-child rela- tions, socialization of the young, grooming, coaperative behavior, the sexual cycle, maturity, sex differences, and dominance and submissiveness. The part of the book not yet mentioned is by far the most valuable as pointing out what has so far been accomplished in research on intelligence in the chimpanzee. It comprises five chapters on 'mentality.' The first chapter of this section presents information on receptive and perceptual processes. We see quite clearly that chimpanzees and men are not unlike in receptivity. When we get to perceptual processes, however, the gap appears wide. Chimpanzees often seem stupid, ignoring cues which would be quite evident even to a young child. The reason, according to the author, is that a chimpanzee's perception is governed by biological ex-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 127 pediency. "Biological significance would seem to be the best single clue to the nature of an individual's world of awareness. ... What is most signifi- cant biologically and most meaningful for one organism may be relatively unimportant for the other. The attentional value of stimuli and of per- ceptual experiences are known to differ extremely among individuals of the same species, but the evidences which are accumulating indicate more and more clearly that these differences are much greater when ape and man are compared." The chapter "Looking toward intelligence" is concerned chiefly with the "workings of brawn and brains, instinct and intelligence, in the animal's action system." Certain needs are outlined and the activities which express and tend to satisfy them are considered. Asking whether the chimpanzee is "more instinctive than man," the author answers that "initially the acts of both ape and man are primarily hereditary. Neither can properly be thought of as more instinctive than the other. But in maturity the immense difference in the status and functional importance of intelligence creates an illusion of contrast which causes us to underestimate human instinct and likewise chimpanzee intelligence." An outstanding point in the chapter upon "Experience the teacher," con- cerns the speed with which learning occurs. The curve of improvement of response in certain of the experiments may seem to indicate that learning occurs gradually. "Perhaps this is true. But it seems more probable from the evidence at hand that instead of slowly learning to discriminate and choose correctly, the subject is instead engaged in learning to learn. How can it be expected to solve the problem unless it is calm enough to notice and attend to the stimulus objects, to perceive their essential difference in brightness, to associate that difference with the response of touching the brighter object, and that in turn with the reward of food? . . . I have long suspected that in many of our experimental studies of habit formation our chimpanzees really do not perceive the essential aspect or aspects of the problem for a long time, and that they may not rightly be said to have begun to profit from experience until this perceptual process occurs." The following classification of learning processes in chimpanzees is suggested; (1) modification of motor expression in correspondence with maturation and exercise, (2) conditioning, (3) trial-and-error or goal- directed learning, (4) directed learning, involving suggestion, imitation, or tuition as a condition, and (5) ideational learning. "Memory, foresight and insight" describes delayed reaction and problem- learning. Emphasis is on learning by insight and the author's criteria of insight are presented in some detail.</page><page sequence="5">128 BOOK REVIEWS Quoting Spence's opposition to his ideas on insight, Yerkes observes that "the basic difference in our points of view is that Spence has accepted the hypothesis that chimpanzee learning results from trial and error and is to be explained by the principles of reinforcement and inhibition, whereas I have accepted, as working hypothesis, the assumption that at some level in mammalian evolution, represented by certain primates and possibly also some other mammals, a new type of neural process appears. This emergent neural process supplements trial-and-error pro- cedure by making possible forms of behavioral adaptation which strikingly resemble those which in us are known to depend upon perception of relation, ideation, insight, or understanding." The final chapter on chimpanzee mentality concerns language and sym- bolism. Studies on token-reward, delayed reaction, and cooiperative prob- lem-solving are stressed. Nobody has ever taught a chimpanzee to speak or write, nevertheless there is a large mass of evidence on the existence of symbolic processes in this animal and on its ability to communicate with others. The chimpanzee is contrasted with the monkey, on the one hand, and with man, on the other, in these respects. Chimpanzees are definitely ahead of the monkeys and "it seems as misleading to assert that chimpanzees are not more intelligent than monkeys as to say that they are as intelligent as men!" After finishing Chimpanzees, the reader discovers that he has a more intimate acquaintance with these animals than could be gained from any- thing short of living with them over the years as the author has done. The research so far achieved has greatly enlarged our knowledge of this primate. An intimate understanding of any animal, and especially one so much like ourselves, is a real accomplishment. Moreover, in learning about the chimpanzee we are viewing the steps which may have closely preceded our own psychological development. Thus the work which under- lies this book is of significance. for phylogenetic study. Although the chimpanzee is presented as a scientific tool, enabling in- vestigation of fundamental human problems which could not be investi- gated with human beings, there is little research so far done with this animal that could not have been done just as well, or even better, with hominid children. Without a knowledge of psychological processes in the chimpanzee, however, and without the information which makes it possible to breed and rear this animal in large numbers, researches on underlying neural and glandular functions and genetics would be impossible. As the author says in closing, "I have completed my part of the story. It is not the end, for essential preparatory work can now give place largely to fundamental research."
