<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sun-Disc in Akhenaten's Program: Its Worship and Antecedents, II* Donald B. Redford Survival of Traditional Iconography at Thebes While the many-armed sun-disc is an admit- tedly dramatic, if rather sterile, symbol, it did not, during the period Akhenaten remained at Thebes, entirely supplant the more traditional iconography. During this third stage in the devel- opment of the new cult, for example, after the anthropomorphic representation of the sun-god had been given up, the falcon and hybrid forms based upon it remained fairly common in the wall decoration at Karnak. The statue type in which the standing figure of the king wearing a bag wig is protected by a large falcon behind him is depicted at least once in the talatat (pl. VH:8); the falcon-headed icon surmounting a collar and wearing a sun-disc is also present (pl. VIII: 1). A falcon surmounts a large sistrum (pl. VIII:3). Jars used in the cult may have lids shaped like a fal- con's head (pl. V1II:5), and a hawk-headed sphinx, watching protectingly over the car- touches of the Disc, squats on top of a pylon [ATP I, pl. 87:5). Also reminiscent of the traditional symbolism connected with Reha- rakhte and the sun-cult are the recumbent sphinxes with serekhs of the king on their heads (pl. VIII [bottom]; 4:2). These appear as presen- tations145 made to the king, or carried before him by priests (pl. IX: 1). In the decoration of the jambs of the window of appearance, both the fal- con with wings out-stretched protecting the car- touches and the motif of the trampling sphinx are shown, in contrast to the more austere repertoire of the Amarna window.146 The king may still be called "Horus",147 and the phrase "on the Horus throne" still occurs (pl. X:2). Much of the polytheistic flavor of the Karnak talatat stems directly from the ^-festival theme which is the artists' subject on most of the blocks from Gm,'t(w)-p;-itn. Thus the bull-, "placenta"-, jackal-, and falcon-standards shown borne on the shoulders of bald, bare-chested individuals, some- times identified as hm-ntr, find their place in the reliefs simply because they were deemed an indispensable part of the ceremony {ATP I, pl. 41; this article: pls. IX:3; 1 top; XIL1-3). The same may be the reason for the presence of the group of falcon, bull, mrt-Hgure, Souls of Buto and Nekhen, and the Smsw-Hr standards (cf. ATP I, pl. 77).148 In the talatat this aggregation seems to be a decorative motif which is used to deco- rate the sides of a dais on which the king is shown standing. In one scene two columns of text, paralleled by a caption accompanying the same standards at Bubastis,149 identify the group as "the gods who are upon their standards" (ntrw tpyw tet-sri).150 Elsewhere, the king is shown in a kneeling pos- ture heading a row of three jackal-headed "Souls of Nekhen", all squatting on their haunches per- forming hy-hnw}51 Behind them are two baboons adoring, the second at a lower level than the first. The reason for this is a diagonal line which slopes to the right above their heads. On the basis of a similar arrangement of elements in the tomb of Parennefer, the whole would seem to constitute the decoration on the side of a large altar, approached by a ramp, whereon the king was 21</page><page sequence="2">22 JARCE XVII (1980) depicted standing.152 Possibly to be joined to this scene are those blocks showing the sloping edge of such a ramp, decorated with recumbent figures of the king and squatting baboons, all with hands raised in adoration.153 The text beneath the diag- onal line seems to identify the Souls and action they perform: "doing hnw by the Souls of Pe to Reharakhte-He-Who-Rejoices-in-the-Horizon-in- his-Name-of-Sunlight-which-is-in-the-Disc". Other blocks, on which are shown cult objects unknown at Amarna, likewise place us in the context of the ^/-festival. Men are shown carry- ing the door-hinge and the scorpion sign (ATP I, pl. 42),154 others bear a small, portable pr-wr shrine on carrying poles (ATP I, pl. 79:2).155 Priests of Selkit march in procession;156 the pelt of the iwn-mwt-f is several times attested (ATP I, pl. 41; our pl. VIII:7) and the enigmatic HtPHt Dp(?) has a piece to say.157 As noted above, in the discussion of the ear- liest phase of Akhenaten's innovations, other gods are mentioned alongside the Disc. More rarely in the final stage in the development of the new iconography are other deities ailued to. Allu- sions to the "Eternal Lord" and Geb, if indeed the texts in question have been correctly read and dated,158 might be put down to the exigen- cies of the ^-festival. But references to "the gods" in passages which are not ostensibly connected with the festival (pl. XH:5) must signify a linger- ing acceptance of more than one god, even though the context is clearly intended to indicate the uniqueness of the Disc.159 Of special interest are the sporadic references to Amun on the talatat. Unfortunately the fact that many blocks, especially those now at Luxor, but also some from Karnak, were reused and redecorated in later times, renders final judgment on the date of those talatat with the name Amun precarious indeed. Nevertheless, sources outside Thebes attest to an on-going Amun-cult well into the reign. A high priest of Amun, one May, is attested as late as the 4th year, engaging in quar- rying activity in the Wadi Hammamat.160 Whether the "Image of the Lord," for which the blocks May quarried were needed, was to be set up at Karnak or Amarna is not altogether clear, although it may well be that by the 4th year plans for the new city were far enough advanced to justify such an expedition. Scarabs from very early in Akhenaten's reign describe him as "Neferkheprure whom Amunre selected from millions."161 The three occurrences of the name "Amun", which the present writer feels may date from Akhenaten's time (pl. VI: 1, 2, 5),162 unfor- tunately contain little else than the name itself. The problem as to what extent the cults of Amun and other deities were maintained during the first five years of Akhenaten's reign might have been resolved by offering lists with caiendri- cal notations. Unfortunately, these are scarce. One fragment,163 which reads "given at the festi- vals of the first of the seasons ... on the day of each psdntiw-feast when it falls . . .," is unfortu- nately a redecorated talatat from Ramesside times. Another preserves part of a date: "[. . .] ;ht r17] (?)" (pl. VH:3).164 If this is not part of a regnal year date, it may designate the day and month of a particular feast. Two dates suggest themselves, viz. i /fe, 17, the occasion of the Wag- feast,165 or iii iht, 17, the day of the Amun feast following the feast of Opet.166 Fortunately there is no doubt about the continuation of offerings on New Year's Day, apparently to Re, early in the reign: the new offering list from the Ninth Pylon167 contains an entry "offering of the Lord on New Year's Day." One problem related to the perpetuation of the traditional cultus under Akhenaten has to do with the extent to which the old temple of Amun was used, either by the old priesthood or the new cult. If, as now appears likely, Akhenaten did not build his temples exclusively on ground removed from the precinct of Amun, but followed the practice of his predecessors by building in and around the standing temples,168 it is probable that the Amun temple was used to some extent. One very rare designation of the Disc locates it hry-ib wsht, "residing in the broad hall."169 This hall might have been part of some structure reared by Akhenaten himself, as the wsht is known from Amarna.170 On the other hand, it might equally well be a hall already standing in the temple of Amun, which was pressed into the</page><page sequence="3">THE SUN-DISC IN AKHENATEN'S PROGRAM: ITS WORSHIP AND ANTECEDENTS, II 23 service of the Disc.171 Another qualification of the Disc, which has been recovered on only one (unmatched) blocks is hry-ib ih[. . .].172 One naturally thinks of ih-mnw, but confirmation must await further matching or the discovery of additional examples. Outside Thebes during the first five or six years of Akhenaten's reign, concentration on the Disc to the exclusion of all other gods is not as marked as at Karnak. If other cults had in fact been interdicted, the decree had not yet taken effect. The stela of the overseer of works Aya from Zernik,173 in which the king's nomen is writ- ten "Amenophis," shows the owner adoring Nekhbit, and also mentions the early name of the Disc. A stela in Florence which addresses the "Disc when [he] shifnes . . .] in order to illumine the Two Lands for (his) son, (his) beloved, lord of the Two Lands . . ." implores him to "protect the son of Re, Amenophis, the divine ruler of Wese, the long-lived one." The owner's name is still compounded with the divine name Amun, viz. Amenemope, the overseer of peasants.174 From Nefrusy, on the doorstep as it were of the future residence, come statues of the mayor Iuny and his wife Mutnofret, dated clearly by the royal name Wc-n-r\ in which a prayer is addressed to "the lord of Eternity . . . the great god, lord of the West (i.e. Osiris)" for "good burial after old age."175 Mutnofret, who was a singer of Khnum, lord of Hr-wr,176 also invokes "Osiris, the great god, lord of Eternity" to grant food offerings; while her son Mahu similarly calls upon Khnum and Thoth and asks that "my voice be m/ in the land . . . and my limbs sound." A sun hymn on the stela of Nakht-min, similarly dated by the royal names W'-n-r' and Nefertity (the former called "the mighty king, lord of the lands"), has the tenor of pre-Amarna hymns:177 "Hail to thee Re, lord of Maat, Atum in his beautiful setting! Thou shinest resplendent upon the back of thy mother .... Thou traversest heaven with happy heart, the sea of fire is calm when Re fares with good wind." Anubis is shown at the top of the stela,178 and the cartouches of the Disc contain the early name.179 Abusir was apparently the pro- venience of a whip-handle, inscribed with the prenomen of Akhenaten and the epithet "beloved of Great-of-Magic, lady of heaven."180 In the letter of the Memphite steward Apy, dated in the 5th year, Ptah is called the king's father,181 and reference is made to "all the gods and god- desses who are [in Memphis]."182 It would seem, then, that exaltation of the sun- disc, to the exclusion of other gods and symbols, depended to a large extent on the presence of the monarch. It was his revolution, a personal one in many respects, and its visible effects diminished the farther removed one found oneself from the place where he was in residence. The Attributes of the Disc These few scattered allusions to the old gods should not mislead one into ascribing more importance to them than they deserve; for they pale into insignificance beside the ubiquity of the Disc and the fewer, though nonetheless impor- tant, references to Re. There is hope that conti- nued matching, especially of blocks which con- tain non-formulaic texts, may shed interesting new light on the rationale behind the inception of Akhenaten's program.183 Even in the present, fragmented state of the evidence, we can draw the following conclusions concerning the direc- tion of Akhenaten's thinking. From the outset of his reign, it seems, the idea of uplifting or exalt- ing the Disc dominated his mind. His nbty- name, wts rn n Hn, "uplifting the Disc's name,"184 conveys this predisposition, and the same verb is found on the talatat (unfortunately out of con- text, cf. pl. VIL6, 7; X:2), and in the name of the temple of the Disc at Heliopolis, "Uplifting the Disc in Heliopolis."185 The attributes of this exalted deity are not so clearly set forth on the talatat at Karnak as they were later to be in the Amarna hymns; nevertheless, we sense a marked similarity. The texts at Karnak dwell heavily on the sunbeams which come from the Disc: they "shine" (TS 8793% 3:w), "flour- ish" (1767:3:fig. 3:x), "quell thine enemies" (pl. IX:1),186 and "brighten the Two Lands" (pl. X:4:fig. 4:y). The Disc is "he who decrees life, the lord of Sunbeams1, maker of brightness" (TS</page><page sequence="4">24 JARCE XVII (1980) 8800:fig. 4:z), and is instrumental(?) in "causing the plebs to live" (pl. XH:5:fig. 4:AA). He is the "living Disc who causes everyone(?) [to live(?)]; people are not sated with seeing him . . ." (TS58793=fig. 4:BB); and "[when] every eye [sejes [him(?), they] rejoice" (121:9=fig. l:c). At Amarna, the major part of our knowledge about the character and attributes of the Disc come from the great hymn inscribed in the tomb of Ay, probably the creation of the king himself.187 After Akhenaten's aversion to mytho- logy and its symbolism had obliged him to expunge from the genre of hymns all such allu- sions, all that remained to be predicated of the deity were the concepts of universalism, depend- ence of life on the sun, transcendence, creativity, cosmic regularity, and absolute power. None of this is new, and the originality of Akhenaten's poetic expression should not cloud one's mind on this score.188 The Disc is the creator and sustain- er of the whole earth: "Thou createdst the earth when thou wert afar, namely men, cattle, all flocks, and everything on earth which moves with legs, or which is up above flying with wings. The foreign countries of Syria and Kush, and the land of Egypt, thou placest every man in his place, and makest their food. Everyone has his food, and his lifetime is reckoned; and similarly their languages are wholly separate in form. Their colors are different, for thou hast made foreign peoples different."189 And again, "the world came forth from thy hand, inasmuch as thou madest them."190 Even time is the creation of the Disc: "(thou)creator of months and maker of days, and reckoner of hours!"191 His transcen- dence and power is extolled in the following: "Thou shinest on the eastern horizon and fillest the whole earth with the beauty; thou art beauti- ful, great, dazzling, exalted above every land . . . and while thou art afar off thy beams are on earth, and thou art in every face!192 Thou hast made heaven afar off to shine in, in order to see everything that thou hast made from afar, shin- ing in thy form of living Disc, arisen, resplendent, far-off!"193 All life depends on the Disc: "when thou shinest, they live; when thou settest they die; thou thyself art lifetime, and in thee do they live. (All) eyes see thy beauty until thou settest, in order that work may be accomplished."194 "His sunbeams mean sight for all that he has created. One says, (there is) life (in) seeing him, but they die at not seeing him!" 195 "Infinite life is in thee to quicken them, and the breath of life for (their) nostrils. Thy beams appear, and all nour- ishing plants grow in the soil, caused to grow by thy rays!"196 Reharakhte is "he who bestows his beauty on all mankind that they may live when he gives his beams; the land brightens at thy daily birth, in order to cause what he has created to live."197 As creator and sustainer, the Disc has absolute power over his creation: "the living Disc, lord of what was created and what exists!"198 like an earthly king, his coming enlivens his subjects: "thy beams have bright- ened the earth in its entirety, every heart is happy at sight of thee, for thou art risen as their lord." 199 In all this poetry, there is a deep-seated wonder at the beauty of the sun and its power in nature, and a firm reluctance to elaborate upon it in terms of myth. But the new concept of deity that Akhenaten produces is rather cold. His Disc created the cosmos (how we are not told; it seems not to have been of importance to the king) and keeps it going; but he seems to show no compas- sion to his creatures. He provides them with life and sustenance, but in a rather perfunctory way. No text tells us he hears the cry of the poor man, or has compassion on the sick, or forgives the sin- ner.200 The reason for this, as for all other conspicuous absences in the new cult, is simply that a compassionate god did not serve Akhenaten's purpose. For, to Akhenaten, the heavenly luminary was a hypostasis of divine kingship, projected into the heavens.201 At Karnak, the monarchial aspects of the Disc are almost full-blown. What was former- ly the unwieldy epithet of the god is now reduced in size and squeezed into two cartouches which dominate every scene in which the Disc appears.202 His name is followed by the phrase di cnh dt nhhy as a king's would be; certainly by the time of the move to Amarna, a full titulary of sorts had been fashioned for him.203 Actions normally predicated of the king in his aspect of</page><page sequence="5">THE SUN-DISC IN AKHENATEN'S PROGRAM: ITS WORSHIP AND ANTECEDENTS, II 25 world ruler are now found attributed to the Disc.204 In keeping with his absolute majesty as well as that of his earthly counterpart, mortal and animal creation must bow and adore. In the immediate entrourage of the king, courtiers, ser- vants, soldiers, visitors, in fact almost everyone of non-royal blood, go about in a perpetual stoop, kiss the earth, or stretch themselves flat upon their bellies (cf. pl. V top; VIII:5; IX: 1, 3; ATP I, pl. 36-37, 41-42). Decorative motifs conform to the same theme: rhyt-hir&amp;s adore with raised hands while squatting on their plates (pl. XI, top); snake-headed uraei are provided with human hands which they raise in adoration (pl. VI top); baboons lift paws in worship, and recumbent figures, inspired by the prototype of the king, look upwards towards the sun as they lie one behind the other on the slopes of a ramp [ATP I, pl. 78-80).205 The first ^-festival,206 for which most of the Kaniak structures seem to have been built, and in anticipation of which the radical changes in cult iconography were execut- ed, was not only the jubilee of the king, but of the Disc as well. The Disc was "he who is in jubilee", and such festivals could be termed "jubilees of Re". In one rather obscure passage, the king's "documents of ftf-festiva^?)" are in some way likened to the "[Disc(?)] himself and his docu- ments".207 Even so the connection between the Disc and the ^/-festival is not stressed in the tala- tat, the major part of the references having to do with the king as celebrant.208 The Position of the King in Relation to the Disc Nothing shows the true monarchial motivation behind the innovations better than the position Akhenaten assigned himself in the new scheme of things. To a degree far greater than any of his immediate predecessors, the king set about to affirm the paternity of the sun, the unity of sun and pharaoh, and the uniqueness of the god. The king in the talatat is often represented as the son of the Disc (pl. XH:5), and the latter is called his father (pl. XIIL1, 2=fig. 1:J).209 Once, in anticipation of the favorite Amarna phrase, the king is called "beautiful child of the [Disc]."210 The Disc is said to be the one that "created (kd) his beauty (pl. XH:4, 6). The king loves his father (pl. XIL4) and occupies his throne (pl. XH:4= fig. 2:K, XH:7=fig. 2:L; XIH:3=fig. 2:M). He has been granted the kingship by his father Re (pl. XIH:4=fig. 2:N). Heaven and earth have been bequeathed to him;211 his boundaries have been extended to the limit of heaven; and all lands including Syria and Kush are beneath his feet (pl. X:l).212 The very close spiritual relation- ship between the king and the Disc, later a strong tenet at Amarna, is hinted at in various broken phrases: the Disc is the one that motivates the king, and leads the king (pl. IX:2=fig. 2:Q; cf. fig. 3:R); the king is the "first offspring(?) of the Disc."213 Thus, already in the Theban period of Akhena- ten's reign, the doctrines known so well from the Amarna texts had already been adumbrated, although later emphasis seems to have shifted slightly. At Amarna, the king is everywhere the son of Re214 and the beautiful child of the Disc,215 often with an added phrase denoting his unique physical sonship.216 At Amarna, the simi- larity of the monarch's birth to the daily birth of the Disc in insisted upon217 and is embellished by the colorful metaphor of the sunlight as the source of the king's being.218 In a graphic word- picture of the typical offering scene, the king is said to be shone on by the sunlight which ema- nates from his father.219 Only the king truly knows his father and is familiar with the Disc's intentions;220 in return, the Disc obeys his son's desires.221 The Disc has made his son king on earth as he is king (scil. in heaven);222 in fact, the earthly office of kingship belongs to the Disc,223 and is occupied by his son at the Disc's behest.224 The king never identifies himself with the Disc, although in keeping with the practice that obtained from the New Kingdom to Ptolemaic times, he can identify with Re.225 He is like his father;226 his body is like his father's sunbeams;227 he is his father's image;228 his beauty is that of his father;229 his hi can be invoked in juxtaposition to the Disc;230 but the ul- timate step of identification was apparently not taken. On the face of it, this seems a trifle</page><page sequence="6">26 JARCE XVII (1980) strange, inasmuch as Akhenaten's forebears had not shrunk from such identification, even though it had not been a common metaphor and had been tempered by the distinction which con- tinued to be made between the king and the sun, and in a more general way by the concept of the king as earthly image of the transcendental sun- god.231 These earlier identifications of monarch and Disc, however, as we have pointed out above, were part of the world view. The identifi- cation was a metaphor, a hollow figure of speech which simply described the physical form of the Pharaoh outfitted in his regalia as world ruler. Akhenaten, it seems, endeavored to change the metaphor into the basis of a serious doctrine, much as Aurelian tried to translate the concept of Sol Invictus or Julian that of Helios.232 But in so doing he lacked, as the Roman emperors also lacked, a solid base in time-honored cult: his new ideas had no "grass roots" currency. Hence, he was obliged to force men to consider his teach- ing, and this could only be done by (1) annihilat- ing the cults and beliefs which diverted attention from himself and (2) exalting his new god to a degree where no one could fail to note his pres- ence. Akhenaten himself, as king of Egypt, resi- dent in one place, was particular and parochial, but the Disc in the sky was universal. Hence, it was expedient, in the interests of the universalism of the monarchic ideal he hoped to promulgate, to stress the distinction between himself and the Disc. He was the son of the Disc, and very much like him, but the Disc was transcendent and over all, Akhenaten immanent and over all. By maintaining a distinction between himself and his father, Akhenaten also heightened aware- ness of his own uniqueness. To aver that one is deity is an ultimate and impossible step: there is nothing left to imagine, the door is closed to speculation. It places the embodiment of the ideal before men's eyes, where its imperfections are plain to see. It is essentially a doctrine which would result in the passivity of the god: he has nothing to do, all men must actively serve him. But, if one maintains that one is ua little lower than the angels", so to speak, then the possibility presents itself of stressing one's uniqueness in an active sense. Akhenaten is the unique son of the Disc; the only one who knows him; the only one who can interpret him to men; the only one who can offer certain sacrifices; the only one who rules the earth. In a word, the distinction gives Akhe- naten a freedom of action that absolute identifi- cation would render impossible. There is a further consideration which may have a bearing on why Akhenaten refrained from complete identification with the Disc, and that has to do with the person of his father, Ameno- phis III. There can be no doubt that this flamboy- ant monarch cut a spectacular figure in the world of his time. There can also be no doubt that, as we have seen, Akhenaten was neither Amenophis Ill's eldest nor favorite offspring. Yet the "Dazzl- ing Sun-Disc" which Amenophis III claimed to be, and with which, at death, he would have become wholly assimilated, later turns up as the absolute deity of his son! Notwithstanding the fact that Akhenaten's Disc is in large measure a projection of himself, one cannot help but won- der whether one of the subconcious factors mo- tivating the young man was a fixation with a father-image. The Absolutism of the Disc As Akhenaten could brook no rivals upon earth, so the Disc in the supernal realm must be not only supreme, but absolutely unique. This did not mean that the Disc could be conceived of as a "king of the gods" as Akhenaten was the king of men; the nice bifurcation which had subtly developed for the past two or three centu- ries between terrestrial and celestial was precisely what Akhenaten objected to. He and the Disc were alone and supreme in the universe, over all men: there were no other gods. He was "the liv- ing Disc -there is none other than him!"233 To the writer, this is monotheism in the simple definition of the term which emerges from its ety- mology. The acrimonious debate as to whether the word is applicable misses the point, as the debaters usually presuppose theological consis- tency and logic as a prerequisite for use. But, we today apply it to religions as extreme in their</page><page sequence="7">THE SUN-DISC IN AKHENATEN'S PROGRAM: ITS WORSHIP AND ANTECEDENTS, II 27 philosophical approach as Islam, and as lax in their willingness to accept inconsistency as some forms of Catholicism. Denying that Akhenaten was a monotheist because of the occasional occurrence of other divine names in his texts is about as meaningful as calling Milton a pagan because of the depotentized gods in Paradise Lost. Nor is it possible at this distance in time to interpret correctly the erasures of names and motifs undesirable to the new cult. This program of defacement, which was mounted on so vast a scale that either a small army of hatchet men was required to go throughout the realm, or, as is more likely, a party of inspectors to see that local officials were thorough in their work, must have been begun after the court had decided to move to Amarna. The terminus a quo would seem to be the king's decision to change his name from Amenophis to Akhenaten. The fact that the decoration of the new temples was all but com- plete at Karnak when the name was changed234 proves that it was one of the final acts at the old city, perpetrated on the eve of the "hegira." How long after the name Amun235 and certain objects sacred to him236 were expunged at Thebes is not altogether clear; but, in all probability, it was a concomitant of the modification of the name. This form of persecution, then, and with it the imposition of a rigorous monotheism, would have begun in about the 5th year of the reign, and the thoroughness with which it was effected at Karnak suggests the continued presence of the watchful eye of Pharaoh.237 In keeping with this monotheistic tendency, the hieroglyphic group for "gods" was sometimes effaced, too.238 Subsequently, there is discernible at Amarna an avoidance of ntr nfr in favor of hh nfr as an appellative of the king,239 and on one occasion htp-ntr is replaced by htp-itn.240 A similar anathema was pronounced upon Osi- ris and his cycle,241 and while mortuary practices might be retained, they had to undergo reinter- pretation. Thus, while it continued to be felt necessary to provide canopic boxes with figures at the corners, the usual goddesses are replaced by figures of Reharakhte.242 Ushabtis must be retained, but in place of the usual chapter of the Book of the Dead, only the name of the deceased is written on them.243 Heart scarabs continue to occur, but only with a simple offering formula to the Disc.244 Titles peculiar to Osiris turn up occa- sionally, but now appropriated by Reharakhte.245 Some motifs commonly associated with an Osir- ian milieu are conspicuous by their absence. References to the Underworld are very few, and then simply identify the place from which the deceased comes in the morning to view the sun.246 The image of the nocturnal sun bringing light to the denizens of the Underworld (Osiris' bailiwick) is "conspicuously neglected" at Amarna.247 Other significant omissions include the Ennead and Apophis,248 and the cultic for- mula common heretofore ktp hr m^t, which is replaced by the apparently less objectionable hr hr rn?H.249 Purification of the script and decora- tive art extends to replacing objectionable ideo- grams with words written purely phonetically,2^0 and to the discarding of such motifs as the trampling sphinx. Mortuary wishes are also refined. On her ushabti, the concubine Pya251 prays for "sweet breath of the north wind which comes forth from heaven through the agency of the living Disc, her limbs protected, her heart contented. No sickness shall afflict her body which is whole without dis- ease. May she serve the Disc when he rises in the morning to take his form(?) in life; water for her heart, bread for her belly, clothing to cover her body . . .." In his htp-di-nsw formula, Hatiay252 prays for "an offering which the king gives to the living Disc who lights the earth, that he may give a long life and the receiving of his hi . . . ." Apy, chief of works at Hatnub,253 requests "an offering which the king gives to the living Disc who brightens every land with his beauty, that he may give the sweet breath of the north wind, tasting of offerings, consumption of provisions, (granting) that I receive what is poured out for me, viz. cool water, wine, and milk upon the altar of my tomb, that there be sprinkled for me reju- venating water each New Year's day . . .." Maya254 asks for a htp-di-nsw "that the (the Disc) may let me see his beauty through his rays spread upon my breast . . . that he may grant a</page><page sequence="8">28 JARCE XVII (1980) good burial at his hfs behest in the district of Akhenaten . . . and that he may allow entry into and exit from the king's house, bearing the favors of the good god, until the good, revered state comes." As the last request shows, a pale exist- ence in the Beyond is to be coupled with a con- tinuation of the deceased's status vis-a-vis the earthly king; and in a similar vein Mahu prays,255 "may I hear the king's voice as he performs that which his father the Disc favors". The concept of the bai is retained, but now it is Akhenaten and the Disc that confer upon it the privilege of future existence.256 In sum, we may say that the tendencies here reflected encompass the following: (1) denial of the plurality of deity, (2) denial of the mythology of the Afterlife, (3) avoidance of anthropo- morphic representation. It may be argued that in none of these was Akhenaten completely tho- roughgoing; but that need be only a reflection on his ability to persevere, not on his sincerity. The Priesthood and the Cult The priestly organization centering upon the worship of the Disc during Akhenaten's reign is only imperfectly known. Priests are ubiquitous in the talatat reliefs, especially those dealing with the ^-festival, and the grades hm-ntr, w'b, and it- ntr are mentioned fairly frequently.257 One cannot help but wonder whether this crowd of clean-shaven clerics is not essentially the same priesthood functioning at Karnak up to that point in time, viz. the so-called priesthood of Amun itself. Certainly the popular view of a priestly group singled out and defrocked by the young king is really only an inference: why could they not be masquerading as the celebrants of the jubilee in the talatat scenes?257a As the king was central to the newly-promul- gated "teaching," so was he the focal point in the organization of the cult. like Amun, and possibly in imitation of his organization, the Disc was served by a "First Prophet"; but this earthly representative was no mere mortal, but his son and image, the king.258 He was the chief cele- brant, and the right to offer was his alone: "I it is that am to [offer] myself [to my] father [the sun- disc] in the House of the Disc in Akhetaten; he is not to be offered to while [. . .]";259 and again, the king is "one true-hearted in offering to him who made him, propitiating him with what pleases his Aa."260 Even in cult iconography the king was the central worshiper. On the diagonal slopes of the Reharakhte altars lie recumbent figures of the king in bag- wig, adoring the sun in the company of baboons. In the decorative design on the sides of the same altar it is Akhenaten who performs hy-hnw under the arms of the sun (above, p. ). But as well as a "First Prophet", the Disc also enjoyed the services of a "Chief Seer of Reha- rakhte ... in the House of the Disc in Southern Heliopolis,"261 a title clearly derived from the Heliopolis in the north (where Akhenaten had instituted a similar office).262 Later at Amarna there was to be a "Chief Seer of the Disc in the House of the Disc in Akhetaten," and one incum- bant, Meryre, is known.263 It would seem that in this office we are to see the managing head of the solar cult of Akhenaten, but it must be admitted that throughout the Karnak talatat his role is ancillary to that of the king. He is shown accom- panying the king in the three temples of Grri't(w)-p;-itn, Rwd-mnw, and Tni-mnw, though most frequently in the first, thanks to the exigen- cies of the jubilee. He wears a simple kilt and, occasionally, a head-tassel, and carries a censer or Arjfr-scepter and a libation vase. At the jubilee he precedes the king in the processional, backing down the stairs or with head turned, the while "censing before His Majesty."264 When the king goes about from shrine to shrine in the great sd- festival court, the Chief Seer heads the little party of priests and hands His Majesty the libation vase.265 Two other priests, the "Chamberlain and First Prophet of Neferkheprure Waenre" and the "Chief Lector-priest," also appear in the Karnak talatat in subordinate, if not menial, roles. The fact that the first of the two named was paralleled by a "Second Prophet of the lord of the Two Lands . . ,"266 suggests an organized priesthood of the king, rather than an ad hoc designation; and to find both relatively early in the reign calls into</page><page sequence="9">THE SUN-DISC IN AKHENATEN'S PROGRAM: ITS WORSHIP AND ANTECEDENTS, II 29 question our common practice of labeling such titles as "mortuary."267 As a god the king was ipso facto an object of worship; and the title is not turned into a mortuary one simply because most of that worship was directed towards him after his death. In fact, in the talatat the high-priest of the king functions more after the manner of a personal servant: he always follows the king in the procession from shrine to shrine at the ^-fes- tival, holding a tressel in one hand and the king's sandals on a stick in the other.268 In Rwd-mnw and Tni-mnw269 he is present in the same capa- city. The Chief Lector is clad in cap, shirt and kilt, and carries his book-roll. He plies his trade in Gm-t(w)-p;-itn only, accompanying the royal party from shrine to shrine and following along behind the Chief Seer; but he is never shown actually reading from his book,270 an interesting omission that might possibly indicate that his presence was more for show than in fulfilment of a real function. After all, the hit from which he would have read would have been replete with the imagery and purposes of an anathematized form of worship, and the heretical king could scarcely have tolerated readings from such a document.271 Of the other priests and their functions we know very little. The God's-fathers and vdb- priests are shown carrying bouquets and other paraphernalia and probably had a hand in carry- ing and arranging offerings. At Amarna we hear of the "First Servant of the Disc in the Mansion of the Disc in Akhetaten,"272 but what precise function, if any, the title involved is unknown. The actual cult in which the king and his priests performed has been drastically reduced by the time the sculptors depict it on the talatat, occasioning perhaps a lack of tasks for the clergy. The one expression in the talatat which approaches most closely our notion of "perform- ing the cult" is irt hrrt nbt it% "doing everything that pleases the Disc. The service in the main consists of food offerings,273 with a slight nod in the direction of solar symbolism. As an example of the latter, the morning offering of m/t may be cited: "they all together offer to his kay to the Disc shining on the horizon at dawn, while his son of- fers m/t to his beautiful face."274 This symbolic act has been construed as a formal means of assuring the deity that right and the divine order have not been impaired.275 At Thebes during the first five years of the reign, the symbol used for m/t was still the seated goddess on the plate (pl. 11), a device later discarded at Amarna. The food-offering is the single most important type of scene in the talatat and shows such varie- ty that justice cannot be done to the subject here. In the earlier reliefs, before the final triumph of the new style, an older terminology was tolerat- ed. Caption texts speak of "giving all herbs" (rdit rnpt nbt)276, "circulating around him [four times],"277 and htp-ntr is not yet deemed objec- tionable.278 But with the introduction of the new style and the celebration of the jubilee, by far the most common term for offering becomes sm/ c?bt, "to make the great offering." A text, apparently accompanying a scene of large size in which the king performs this rite, makes explicit in a well-known succession of expressions just what the "great offering" consists of: "Offering up the divine propitiations, the great offering [of oxen], short-horns, wine, incense, [all things] fine and pure, and all vegetables [. . . to] thy ka, O thou living Disc!"279 And the driving, throwing, and slaughtering of cattle is a scene which often occurs in Gm-t(w)-p;-itn in a long band along the bottom of jubilee reliefs showing the king offer- ing in various shrines.280 Among the other types of offering shown mention may be made of the dbh-htp offering (pl. IX:5), the proffering of fore- legs and bulls' heads, and the libations and cens- ing of court officials, in a body, each uttering an appropriate benedictory phrase.281 In all such scenes one theme is stressed: the bounty of the king and of his father the sun. The plenty of the land of Egypt depends upon them alone. The king is "the Nile which fills the entire land";282 he is addressed as "the light ($w\ I live through sight of thee, I am strenghtened at the sound of thy voice!"283 The world of nature slips easily into the world of the ethical in the Egyp- tian's mind, and the corollary to the divine pair's omnipotence was not lost on ancients. The king is "one who gives to whom he loves, who ordains</page><page sequence="10">30 JARCE XVII (1980) burial for one who puts him in his heart."284 And from this premise follows that classic piece of advice from the mouth of the god's father Ay, wherein we hear echoes of the same strain that resounds from Ptahhotpe or Sehtepibre-onkh to Anii: "Ho all living upon earth, and those who shall be young men someday! I shall tell you the way of life . . . Offer praises to the living Disc and you shall have a prosperous life; say to him 'Grant the ruler health exceedingly!'285 then he shall double favors for you . . . Adore the king who is unique like the Disc, for there is none other beside him! Then he will grant you a life- time in happiness of heart, with the sustenance he is wont to give!"286 The kingship is central, one, indivisible and unique. It is on earth and in heav- en, solar in origin and manifestation. No one can escape its power, claims or obligation.

VIII :6 where the text reads "appearance [in] the palace by [the king] upon the throne in order to perform the ritual (irrw) in the days of the Red Crown" (fig. 3:U), clear implication, it would seem, that the rites involving the two crowns occupied a considerable period of time. 156 Smith-Redford, op. tit., lOOf. 157 PL X:3=fig. 3:V.

Pawah, the high-priest of the sun-disc in the House of Re, also mentions this first jubilee, although apparently in retrospect: Berlin 20375 (Aegyptische Inschriften, II, 126). For a bibliography of additional reliefs from Europe and Meda- mud which depict the same festival, see J. J. Clere, RdE 20 (1968), 51 f. 207 Akhenaten Temple Project I, pl. 77 (our fig. 1:D).

In an unfortunately broken passage, ad-dressed to someone of importance, an interesting remark about the effect of the ^/-festival seems to be made: "[. . .] them in thy(?) face [. . .], beloved of the Disc.

In many cases the original car- touche was merely plastered over and re-cut, with the result that with the subsequent loss of the secondary surface, both the original name and traces of its modification appear to- gether in a curious conflation. In some cases, however, e.g. the large limestone block west of the north wing of the second pylon, the original name has been shaved off the stone with such care that the eye may be deceived: cf. Saad, Traunecker, op. cit., 173 fig. 5. 235 A fortiori the persecution of Amun was contemporary with the name change (pace R. Hari, CdE 51 [1976], 259); on the defacement in general, see Bonnet, Reallexikon, 62 f. 236 E.g. the ram hieroglyph: Urk. IV, 701:7. 237 A study of some interest would concern itself with those instances of the name *Imn at Karnak which were not erased, and yet which antedated Akhenaten's reign. If, as seems most probable, failure to efface means that that part of the text in question was concealed by walls or other con- structions now gone, careful plotting of the names that were missed might prove useful in reconstructing the plan of the temple as it was just prior to the move to Amarna. 238 E.g. in the tomb of Kheruef: Fakhry, ASAE 42 (1943), 462. 239 Cf.

The line which mentions the defeat of the monster is omitted altoge- ther: Stewart, he. cit. 249 Anthes, Maat des Echnaton, 14. 250 See the glossary of words appearing in the Karnak talatat compiled by Mr. Edmund Meltzer and shortly to appear in The Akhenaten Temple Project, vol. 2. 251 Legrain, ASAE 10 (1909), 108; a Turin shawabty in- cludes the traditional spell, but this may well belong to the close of the Amarna period: H. Schlogl, Oriens Antiquus 14 (1975), 145f. 252 Frankfort, Pendlebury, The City of Akhenaten, II, pl. 23:4. 253 Legrain, ASAE 10, be. cit. 254 Sandman, Akhenaten Texts, 62 f. 255 Ibid., 52:151 256 L.

Tawfik, in Smith, Redford, The Akhenaten Temple Project, I, p. 95 ff. 25 7a In one documented case, an official of the Amun temple later turns up among the personnel of the estate of the Sun-disc: in a Leiden stela (V 26) there is mention of an "overseer of the cattle of Amun" who in a Vienna stela (53) has become the "overseer of the cattle of the House of the Disc": J. H. Breasted, ZAS 40 (1901), 140. As in the case of the jubilees of Amenophis III, it is quite probable that those who participated in Akhenaten's jubilee of years 2-3 proudly displayed their jubilee roles in their titles: this may be the reason for Ay's adoption of the title it-ntr (cf. Smith, Redford, The Akhenaten Temple Project, I, 79 f. and n. 27), and it undoubtedly accounts for Thutmose, the viceroy's, assump- tion of hrp nsty (cf. D. Dunham, The Barkal Temples [Boston, 1970], 28 n. 10, 31, fig. 25; pl. 28a, b). There is no reason therefore to deny the title to Merimose, as is done by Miiller, in Agypten and Kusch (Berlin, 1977), 325ff. 258 «First prophet of Reharakhte . . ., King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands, (Akhenaten)," ASAE 7 (1907), 228 f.; cf.

Naville, The Temple of Deir el Bahari (London, 1894-1908), IV, pl. WQJEA 24, pl. 5; S. Sauneron, BIFAO 69 (1971), pl. 57; W. M. F.

But he also puts in an appearance and is shown reading in the same fashion, at the festivals of the gods: the Min festival (Cham- pollion, Monuments, II, pl. 150; H. H. Nelson, Medinet Habu IV. Festival Scenes of Ramses III (Chicago, 1940), pl. 200, 203, 205), and at the rite of "recitation of 'jubilation'", i.e. the reading of the list of ancestors at the offering ceremony: cf. the scene accompanying the Abydos "King list", Porter, Moss, Topographical Bibliography, VI, 25. 271 Hbt can mean "ritual book" (G. Lefebvre, ASAE 22 [1922], 34; Wb. El, 61:1-2; Gardiner, Ancient Egyptian Ono- mastica, I [Oxford, 1947], 55*; P. Posener-Krieger, J. L. de Cenival, Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum. 5th.-Series. The Abusir Papyri [London, 1968], pl. 19), but also apparently "sacred inventory": cf. H. Gauthier, La grande Inscription dedi- catoire d'Abydos (Cairo, 1912), 72. 272 Davies, Amarna II, pl. 4ff. (Paynehsi); IV, pl. 2-3 (Pentu). 273 Cf. Cooney's comment {Amarna Reliefs from Hermopolis in American Collections [Brooklyn, 1965], 18) "that he did not discard the idea of food-offerings shows that he was not as spiritual in part of his thinking as some have supposed." I fear there is a non-sequitur lurking here. 274 Sandman, Akhenaten Texts, 59:17-18 (May). 275 Cf.
