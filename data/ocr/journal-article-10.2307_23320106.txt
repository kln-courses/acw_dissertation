<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eamonn P. Kelly investigates the possible supernatural purpose of a mysterious cache of objects Not long after I joined the staff of the National Museum of Ireland, a telephone caller reported the discovery of a 'cave' found while digging foundations outside Wicklow Town. Thinking that the report related to the discovery of a souterrain in an area not noted for souterrains, Dr Joseph Raftery, Keeper of Irish Antiquities, instructed me to investigate, on what was my first-ever fieldwork for the National Museum. I did so on 25 April 1976. The telephoned report was not a first hand account and proved to be somewhat misleading. What had been found was not a souterrain but an oven that had been blocked up together with an adjoining fireplace, apparently during the early twentieth century. The oven appeared to be an original feature of Coolbeg House, which is shown on Above: Child's hobnail boot found in the thatch of a house, Moneystown, Co. Wicklow (© Chris Corlett). Right: Small wooden cross found in the thatch of a house, Kilbeg, Co. Wicklow (© Chris Corlett). the first-edition Ordnance Survey 6in. map, surveyed in 1838 (sheet 31, Co. Wicklow, ITM 727407 690783). The oven was discovered when part of the south gable wall was removed to facilitate the construction of a new fireplace. The residents, Mr Oliver Byrne and his family, were not aware of the existence of the oven and its discovery came as a surprise. According to members of the Byrne family, Coolbeg House came into their possession during the 1860s. Family tradition also holds that a family named Sharpe lived in the house prior to the Byrnes, while a family named Watson was believed to have been in residence at an earlier date. It was also believed that Coolbeg House was once an 'agent's house' belonging to the Kilmacurragh estate, formerly owned by the Acton family. The oven was located to the right-hand side of the original fireplace, which was completely obscured at the time of my visit. The oven chamber was built of red bricks that were mortar-bound. A flue connected it to the fireplace. Roofed with a stone slab, one end of which rested on a stone upright, the flue had been blocked with a sheet of corrugated iron, behind which had been packed numerous fist sized stones. The interior of the flue and the oven chamber were fire-blackened. The oven was subcircular with a straight section that lay parallel to the gable wall. This section may originally have contained a door that would have allowed access to the oven from the room, although this could not be stated with certainty owing to recent damage to the structure. The oven chamber was about lm in diameter and it had a domed roof. 16 Archaeology Ireland Autumn 2012 V , Eamonn P. Kelly Above: Child's hobnail boot found in the thatch of a house, Moneystown, Co.

When the chamber was breached by the builders it was found to contain a cache of objects, which were removed at the time of discovery. I brought back to the museum all the objects I was shown, but it is not certain whether this was the sum total of what had been found. Included were metal objects such as an iron candle-snuffer, an iron bar of square cross-section, a bolt, a cramp and a broken oval hoop. A fragment of a pewter spoon was also present. A narrow metal strip that is shown in a photograph of the Coolbeg metal objects is not referred to in the filed report. It was assumed that all of the metal objects were of nineteenth/early twentieth century date, but a recent examination of a photograph of the pewter spoon by British expert Simon Moore has produced the surprising conclusion that the spoon dates from around the year 1600. Presumably the decision to place an object of some antiquity into the oven was intended to increase the magical effectiveness of the deposit. Ceramics found included the base and part of the wall of a bowl decorated internally and externally with a floral design; a rim sherd and two base sherds of a plain dish; base, rim and body sherds of an eggcup decorated below the rim with three gold lines; a rim sherd of a mug or jug with bands of grey decoration below the rim; the handle of a delft vessel, possibly a milk jug; and two rim sherds of a plate decorated with a band of impressed hoops around the rim. Regrettably, only the metal and ceramic objects were photographed or described in any detail, so the precise form of the remaining finds is uncertain. The photograph of the ceramics was examined recently by Audrey Whitty, National Museum of Ireland, who suggested early twentieth-century parallels for some of the material. The remains of four glass bottles were found, three of green glass and one of a light blue colour. Other finds included two clay pipe bowls and an irregular fragment of leather which had a small leather strip machine-stitched to one edge, with five awl holes along another edge. This may have been part of a shoe or boot that was selected deliberately for symbolic reasons. Among the bones present were a number from a large bird, of the size of a goose or turkey, together with cattle and pig bones, some of which bore saw marks. Some featureless fragments of wood and large Archaeology Ireland Autumn 2012 lumps of charcoal were also present, as was an hourglass-shaped wooden object. It appeared that the objects had been deposited deliberately when the oven was bricked up, but an explanation as to why this should have been done was not forthcoming. I consulted the Irish Folklife Division of the National Museum of Ireland but my colleagues there could throw no light on the matter. Nor did they wish to acquire the finds, which were offered to them. Regrettably, at the direction of Dr Raftery, the objects were later discarded. From time to time over the years I wondered about the mysterious cache of objects hidden in the bricked-up oven in Coolbeg House. It was only in January 2012, when I fulfilled a speaking engagement at the annual conference of the Society for Historical Archaeology in Baltimore, USA, that the mystery was solved. Among the sessions that I attended was one on the archaeology of folk magic, which featured lectures by American, Australian and British experts on various types of 'spiritual middens' found in their home countries. It quickly became apparent to me that the objects concealed in the Coolbeg House oven represented an Irish example of the same phenomenon. The 'spiritual midden' tradition in America and Australia was introduced by settlers from England, where from the late medieval period onward there was fear of the harm that malevolent witches could inflict on unsuspecting households. It was believed that a witch could enter a house through doorways, windows or the open chimney, which was thought to be particularly vulnerable. One way to protect the chimney was to create a 'spiritual midden', whereby familiar objects were placed in a void around the fireplace or chimney. On occasion, purpose-built cavities were located behind the hearth into which items could be deposited from above. 17 Plan and section of oven, Coolbeg House, Co.

Perhaps the most common form of protection was that of placing concealed shoes inside the fabric of the building. The idea was that the human scent would attract the witch into the shoe, where she would become trapped as witches are unable to move in reverse. Footwear is usually found concealed in chimneys, either on a ledge a little way up the chimney or in a void behind the hearth. Also favoured are spaces within walls, under floorboards, in window frames, roof-spaces and staircases. Nearly all of the shoes discovered in this context in Britain are well worn, half of those found belonged to children and only very rarely are pairs found. Coincidentally, the only Irish example of footwear concealed in a roof-space that I am aware of is a child's tiny hobnail boot from the thatch of a house at Moneystown, near Roundwood, Co. Wicklow. Another object found in thatch that may have been placed there to protect the house from entry by evil spirits is a small wooden cross, 28cm high, from Kilbeg, near Lacken, Co. Wicklow. I am grateful to Chris Corlett, National Monuments Service, for details and images of these two finds. The witch-bottle was a smaller version of a witch trap than that represented by the Coolbeg oven, and many of the earliest bottles found in England have been found upside down, buried beneath doorways and hearths. The most common contents of a witch-bottle are bent pins and urine, although a range of other objects were also used. It was thought that the bending of the pins 'killed' them in a ritual sense, which meant that they then existed in the 'otherworld' where the witch travelled. The urine attracted the witch into the bottle, where she became trapped on the sharp pins. Glass bottles were used to make witch bottles but also popular were salt-glazed ceramic 'Greybeard' vessels, so called because they bore the image of a bearded old man. These vessels came to be associated with Cardinal Roberto Bellarmino, one of the most important figures in the Counter Reformation, and are often referred to as (I " O Jil Bellarmine vessels. It may have been believed that the severe countenance of the bearded figure would scare off witches. The opposite may have been the intention, however, with the human image acting as a lure to attract the witch into the bottle. It is possible that the hourglass-shaped wooden object from Coolbeg was perceived of as having anthropomorphic characteristics and may therefore have been placed in the oven with a similar intention. The broken nature of the objects placed in the Coolbeg oven may likewise have been intended to transport them into the otherworld realm. Any witch attempting to enter via the chimney of Coolbeg House would be attracted into the bricked-up oven by the familiar personal objects stashed there and would have become trapped upon the sharp fragments of glass, ceramic, metal and bone. As noted above, most of the metal objects in the cache were of iron, which was considered to be the most powerful of the apotropaic materials to counteract witches. The presence of clay pipes in the Coolbeg deposit is paralleled in English 'spiritual middens'. The Coolbeg iron candle-snuffer is an interesting inclusion that may have had symbolic associations. In England candle smoke was used to fashion apotropaic symbols on ceilings, often in bedrooms or hallways near bedrooms. In the UK and Australia dried cats have been found in various locations within buildings, including voids near the foundations and in roof cavities. It was believed that cats had associations with witches. The dried cats would have served to decoy evil spirits away from the residents of the house and would have destroyed spirit vermin. Examples are known of mummified cats being posed with mummified prey such as a bird, mouse or rat. Less commonly the bodies of chickens were used as apotropaic objects. Horses, like cats, have been credited with the ability to see ghosts and other evil spirits, and this may account for the practice of placing a horse skull or skulls beneath a flagstone next to the hearth. Looked at in the wider context, it seems likely that the animal and bird bones found in the Coolbeg oven may have been deposited deliberately as apotropaic objects. 'Spiritual middens' found in England, Australia and the USA have generated an extensive literature that can be accessed via the internet. Little work appears to have been done in Ireland, however, with the exception of an excellent report on Irish examples of mummified cats published by John Sheehan ('A seventeenth-century dried cat from Ennis Friary, Co. Clare', North Munster Antiquarian Journal 32 (1990), 64-9) and an article by Sean O Suilleabhain relating to the deposition of horse skulls ('Foundation sacrifices', Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland 75 (1945), 45-52). It is hoped that this article will alert persons engaged in renovating old buildings to the possibility of such deposits and to ensure that finds are reported to the National Museum of Ireland. Insufficient data are available to determine how widespread the 'spiritual midden' tradition may have been in Ireland and whether it was an introduction from Britain rather than a parallel tradition. Before surveys were carried out in Australia the existence of the tradition there was largely unknown, and I suspect that if similar surveys were conducted in Ireland they would uncover a rich trove of information. Perhaps some postgraduate student looking for a research topic might be encouraged in that direction? ■ 18 Archaeology Ireland Autumn 2012 Right: Metal objects from a 'spiritual midden' in a blocked-up oven, Coolbeg House, Co.
