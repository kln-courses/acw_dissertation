<plain_text><page sequence="1">revaluations translator's note: Dominique Aury (1907-1998) was the general secretary of Nouvelle Revue Franfaise from 1953 until her death in April 1998 and an influential figure in postwar French publishing. She was also a distinguished translator from English into French. During the Occupation, she was a member of the "intellectual resistance" and distributed clandestine publications. Her critical essays—whose subjects range from Chretien de Troyes to Albert Camus—were collected in Lecture pour tous (1958), which won the Grand Prix de la Critique, and in Lecture pour tous, 2 (1999). A television interview conducted by Nicole Grenier in 1988 and broadcast posthumously was published as Vocation: clandestine (1999). Under the pseudonym Pauline Reage, she is the author of Histoire d'O (1954). The following essay originally appeared as "Une Autre Ressemblance" in Nouvelle Revue Franfaise 25 (January 1955) shortly after Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu edited by Pierre Clarac and Andre Ferre was published in the Bibliotheque de la Pleiade (Editions Gallimard, Paris 1954). It was reprinted as "Proust: Une Autre Ressemblance" in Lecture pour tous © Editions Gallimard, Paris 1958. Dominique Aury refers to the edition by Clarac and Ferre as "probably definitive." It was, however, superseded in 1987-1989 by a new edition directed by Yves Tadie, the version currently published in the Bibliotheque de la Pleiade. The essay is presented here in translation by permission of Editions Gallimard. Dominique Aury Proust: Another Likeness T JL he text, probably definitive, of A la recherche du temps perdu runs to three thousand pages. It took six years (of what labor!) for Pierre Clarac and Andre Ferre to arrive at their text by comparing the original printed version with the proofs corrected by Marcel Proust (to the extent that he corrected them), the handwritten manuscripts, the typed manuscripts that Proust annotated, the additions he made in notebooks, margins, or on the famous scrolls pasted onto the manuscript and proofs by Celeste [Proust's housekeeper]. All told, taking into account corrections of misreadings, paragraphing, and punctuation along with deletions, additions, and variants, there were thirty thousand corrections. A summary of the narrative, in each of the three volumes, with page references for each episode, a scrupulous critical apparatus with notes explaining the choice of the reading adopted and citing the variants, and, at the end of the third volume, an index of characters and places, make this edition a monument to bibliographic and textual scholarship. On another front, Bernard de Fallois, who had the patience to reconstruct a version of Jean Santeuil in three NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">volumes from an incomplete set of notebooks and loose sheets, many of them torn, discovered in a trunk, has published—also assembled from several versions—a critical work by Proust, Contre Sainte-Beuve, preceded and followed by texts that are either the first versions of famous passages in La recherche: the lilacs of Combray, the sun on the balcony, the mystery of names, the red-headed girl in pink at the train stop; or else essays on writers, Balzac (the Balzac of M. de Guermantes), Baudelaire, Nerval, or on painters, Watteau, Chardin, Rembrandt. Finally, aside from the work and what direcdy relates to it, a number of Marcel Proust's letters have been published since the end of the war: letters to Prince Bibesco, to Madame C, to his mother, and recendy to various friends including Bernard Grasset. Let me say at the outset that while these letters, whatever they may be, even those addressed to his mother, are of considerable interest because they were written by Proust, this interest is merely documentary. You can hardly believe your eyes. Where is Proust the writer in this affected and worldly jumble that any neurotic maniac, any tender son, any bourgeois attached to his furniture, any author concerned with his success would have been able to write? It is true, now and again, that a few pages, a few lines, stand out; they are always and only the pages, the passages, that are about the work in progress—always taken up again, the work, because there is just one, "the book," he says, "into which I have put the best of my thinking and even of my very life." His life? Which one? Apparendy the most reliable account, on a day-to-day basis—offered by Proust himself—of his everyday life, breathless and harrowing (in the letters to his mother, for example), looks dull and dead next to the work, as perfectly useless as Benjamin Constant's public and secret Journal is useless for learning the truth about Benjamin Constant by comparison to Adolphe. This sort of surface accuracy is almost deceptive, just as deceptive as the portraits on the dust jackets that offer as a mask for genius the barren and insipid handsomeness of a dandy, circa 1900. All the same, he really looked like that, really led that life. The same could be said of the contrast between what belongs to the man and what belongs to the writer; it would not be worth mentioning, if it did not in fact confirm, by the example of Proust himself, his fundamental argument against Sainte-Beuve and Sainte-Beuve's method: that it is false, it is criminal to go, as Sainte-Beuve did, from the man to the work. Marcel Proust pushes this point of view with a passion so justified but so violent that you can hardly avoid thinking that, pleading against Sainte-Beuve, he is pleading for himself, like someone guilty, someone who knows he's guilty but nevertheless innocent and cries out that no one has the right to judge him by this appearance, which will fade away, by the vanity of this life, which will be effaced, by these temporary features, who knows that the truth lies somewhere else, in another life, another likeness. It is thoroughly evident that he is right, and that the true Marcel escaped death in a double about whose appearance we know nothing—neither what color his eyes are, nor if his hair is blond or brown, someone whose face and voice we do not know: the narrator of A la recherche du temps perdu. In order to give that double his breath, his heart, his suffering, the secret of his happiness, Marcel Proust did not regard his whole life as too high a price to pay; a life for a life, the most fantastic of exchanges. You can say that La recherche is enough to bear this out, and that the additions, Dominique Aury 157</page><page sequence="3">the variants, the fragments, and the revisions provide nothing that La recherche had not already provided. Perhaps so, but just as he was passionate about repairing what in Jean Santeuil constituted the first approximations to La recherche, he is passionate about following in La recherche itself the alterations to the text, which are tracked in the notes and which the notes allow us to spot (reading the book back to front, beginning with the notes), and to discover, moreover, in the critical texts, the almost systematic elucidation of a certitude and a vocation. As for the revisions, their nature has just that curious element that renders each of them, properly speaking, not a revision at all but rather only one account, among others, of a favorite subject whose obstinate reworking sufficiently marks its importance. Each form is a new trap to seize, in its fleeting appearance, a single truth, to bring back in a net with more or less wide mesh, the same phantom or the same monster, sometimes a being that proves the existence of the entire species, sometimes a law that proves the reality of laws. Hence the theme of trees in flower, lilacs, hawthorns, pear trees, whose constant illustration is anthropomorphic: girls, young women, first communicants; the theme of odors in closed up rooms that come out again as eager indulgence: puff pastry; the theme of love that grows by stratification, adding new dimensions to the loved one each day, by which it appends to itself, or one appends to it, space and time; the theme of involuntary memory, revisited so many times and under so many forms; the theme of the desire impossible to conceive and nevertheless true—innumerable themes, but each one in its successive states can serve as an example. Sometimes the only thing that remains from one state to another is the absolute similarity of a material detail: in what used to be Albertine disparue and which becomes again, following the title originally used by Proust, La fugitive, Madame Sazerat is stupefied before Madame de Villeparisis, who, formerly Duchesse d'Havre and as beautiful as an angel, had ruined and abandoned her father: she is now a frightful little red-faced hunchback. Red-faced, frightful, too, is the bus driver for whom, in an unpublished variant given as a note to Sodome et Gomorrhe, M. de Charlus neglects the love of the Princesse de Guermantes—and Marcel, hidden in the shadows, watches in astonishment. Sometimes the variant appears like a sketch of what will later be expanded into a finished picture: the first meeting with Morel, who is called Santois, in a note to A I'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs, an expansion in which a pianist in white furs and an old organist will disappear, but where the famous lock of hair of the young violinist already makes its appearance, "curved and light, round like a lock of hair in a locket." Sometimes the equivalence is almost perfect and the change bears only on the place where the event is set: the lapidary figure, not of a woman but of a boy in the eyes of M. de Charlus, is inserted for the first time in Sodome et Gomorrhe, at the moment of the meeting with the sons of Madame de Surgis. Sometimes, finally, the difference is a suppression. In proportion to the way each volume as originally conceived by Proust proliferated, giving rise to one or several additional volumes, most of his corrections on the textual level aim at consolidation without in the least foregoing the constant repetitions. The comparison of the splendid valets at the duchesses' doors with packs of greyhounds, the grandiose apostrophe like a funeral oration on the accursed race, an unpublished version of which we find in Contre Sainte-Beuve—why would they occur just once? NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page><page sequence="4">Fisher of men and collector of fates, how could Proust help himself when men and fates are inexhaustible? It is not true, moreover, that he searches to recover lost time—rather he searches to recover it in order to annihilate it. Time brings unhappiness, and no other work of literature more passionately has acknowledged that it is a search for happiness. That's where this battle constantly lost and won comes from, this unremitting pursuit that translates, among other things, into the abundance of variants. The latest version of what he wants to say always seems to him to be the best; he crosses out what he replaces, but each formulation in turn has had for him the same power (which it retains for the reader) and brings this unstable happiness closer—a happiness that never follows the order of sensation: it is an intellectual happiness, the discovery of a link between circumstances and situations, like a law discovered by a scientist, and without comparison to such a law or to anything if not love, it is a happiness scarcely expressible that Proust is doubtless unique among all the mystics ever to have communicated: the ecstasy of the being pulled out of the self because one has escaped from time in the fleeting instant in which past and present become one, the instant in which one no longer grasps particular things but their essence, and a cleared space in eternity comes into being. It is here, by a strange reconciliation, that Proust's critical work is so valuable. We find in it confirmation that the immense so-called subjective novel that rests on the immediate givens of consciousness rests at the same time and in a contradictory fashion on the certitude of a preestablished truth by which each thing or each creature or each circumstance exists solely because it is the image and likeness of that truth. And what truth is that? Nobody knows. Proust himself does not know. Nothing is more moving than the respect and feverish intensity with which Proust speaks of this truth that every being in existence possesses and which nevertheless remains unknown to them—the way one speaks of the sacred as both present and unknown. It is the truth, he says, that in the poet is poetry, in the artist, genius, as if Lamartine, Vigny, Hugo, Nerval, Baudelaire were only different incarnations of the same poet, the flowering at the level of a given time of the essence of poetry that lives eternally behind the wall of appearances—and Watteau, Chardin, Rembrandt, in turn the incarnations of the painter, so that the author is himself Balzac after all, and Balzac is he. This preexisting truth everyone must nevertheless create out of scattered pieces: its language is clear but still must be translated; it is pure light, yet it blinds us. We do not know what it consists of, where it comes from, or what it means. Proust never defines it, never explains it. Is it anything other than a marvelous and inexhaustible consent to life, an absolute abandonment to the world we encounter every day—the opposite of revolt, a sublime acquiescence to the reality of our experience? In any case, it's a secret about which his lips are sealed, a secret that remains secret and whose power is overwhelming. It astonishes us to such an extent that we see nothing else. Because it illuminates everything, we enter Proust's work as if we are entering a radiant sea that turns over and over endlessly. For that very reason, one can start reading La recherche anywhere, leave off anywhere: go back to it, let the book fall open to a page at random, let it nourish you over a period of years, play with it, even interrogate the fates with it, as Dominique Aury</page><page sequence="5">people do with the Bible or with Shakespeare. Whatever is added to it at one time or another is immediately absorbed by the stream, and one can probably add every last one of the unpublished fragments, ten versions of Combray and its black slates, ten versions of the unequal paving stones in Venice. Neither the rigor of the composition nor the power of its working out would be damaged; quite the contrary. Quite the contrary, because from the interconnections of so many destinies, from the fantastic and necessary tangle of so many characters with places and times, what emerges at last more especially as abundance augments it, if not this light which we can no longer do without, if not these glowing embers, palpitating and burning? Is it faith? Is it love? Just imagine: thirty-two years ago a prophet died on the rue Hamelin and nobody realized it. —translated from the French by Francis-Noel Thomas ■ . 160 NEW ENGLAND REVIEW</page></plain_text>
