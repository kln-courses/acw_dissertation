<plain_text><page sequence="1">Transformational Narratives: Hearing/Reading Selected Senegalese Folktales by Young Women OMAR SOUGOU Universit? Gaston Berger, Saint-Louis, Senegal ABSTRACT The culture of a people is usually reflected in its folklore. As important con stituents of folklore, folktales are consequently expressive of the worldview of a society at some point in time; they convey indicators of the prevailing ideology in a society. Thus, they are suitable sources for an inquiry into gen der relations at work in a given social formation, especially when folktales by women are considered. This essay embarks on a listening/reading of such folktales in search of transformational trends in gender relations. Folktales are a significant part of African orature, hence of the verbal art of women. A study carried out by Aissata Sidikou shows the scope of women's verbal art based on performances and rituals whereby African women con struct their own space, which enables them to find and adapt opportunities for growth and renewal: The ritual space is a visual and aural environment where women demand to be seen and heard. It is a space that mirrors truth and untruth, reality and fantasy, thus challenging traditional knowledge and power that has constructed their existing feminine condition [...]. Oftentimes, the space not only reveals a femi nine condition but a human condition [. . .]. West African women rely on their verbal art and rituals because these events provide a site for presenting the daily internal struggles aimed at subverting the authority that oppresses them as girls, sisters, wives, and mothers, and mothers-in-law. (171) Sidikou's interest is mainly in songs, poems, and epics, but her study applies to folktales even though they are not her main concern. In folktales women construct the same space within the story. Like those forms, the folktale is an experience where the teller asserts her voice and authority. She becomes a central figure in the ?

She controls her narrative and alters it within the conventional limits of storytelling. The community of listeners is alert to changes in popular tales, which they may condone depending on the status and skill of the storyteller. Isidore Okpewho, observing the dynamics of the relationship between the storyteller and his/her audience in a community, remarks: "[T]he success of a performance is judged fundamentally by the degree to which the artist mirrors the outlook and expectations of this society; and the audience of the performance seems obliged primarily to aid the artist in this task of mirroring" ("The Oral Performer" 161). Not all stories are traditional, however, nor are they retold verbatim; the storyteller can create a folktale out of any event, as Amsata Dieye, a storyteller of the Baol province in Senegal, says he often does. He adds that "women can tell tales, but many people feel uneasy in front of an audience, they are afraid to speak. To tell stories one has to be fearless" (Copans and Couty 35-36, my trans.). This is a male storyteller's view, but women practice the art of tale-telling at home as well under the palaver tree or other public spaces. Harold Scheub's work provides ample evidence of this (see Story and The Poem in the Story). Women sing ceremo nial songs and recite other forms of narratives, like the epics. And indeed, Sidikou contests the view of the epic as a male genre in a chapter significantly headed by this proverbial epigraph drawn from Songhay-Zarma lores: "It is the knowledge of the stupid woman that equals that of the smart man" (131). Women have the power to seize the word and tell stories, be they legends, epics, myth, or folktales. Yet, Sidikou writes: [S]ometimes women's texts perpetuate notions of enslavement and dependency from which those who recount their verbal art cannot free themselves [...] But above all, the language used by women artists can help them to transcend and transform their world. This language can also subvert the dominant society by lowering it to the level of the comic that tends to objectify women by bringing them back with their strength and weaknesses. (23-24) By analogy, the same relation among language, power, and gender is noted in India through Gloria Goodwin Raheja's edited work with the suggestive title Songs, Stories, Lives: Gendered Dialogues and Cultural Critique. As she posits, a study of the social dynamics in the songs and folktales reveals that men speak not just as men, from impermeably gendered masculine subjec tivities, but from their own particular positionalities, sometimes silencing or overpowering women's speech to be sure, but sometimes seeking to create mutuality or to understand the hardships of a woman's life [. . .]. Elucidating these paradoxes of disjunction and community is an ethnographic as well as a theoretical problem, since it is usually only in the micropolitics of daily life that such complex and contextually shifting subjectivities might become evident, and their traces discerned in everyday talk and in the performance of oral traditions. (15) In the collection of folktales to be considered here we shall be concerned with the means of women's empowerment and any mutuality operating in social interaction, and shall concentrate our gaze on ways in which an empowering lan guage is constructed within an androcentric discursive practice and its strategies</page><page sequence="3">28 # RESEARCH IN AFRICAN LITERATURES VOLUME 39 NUMBER 3 of accommodation and subversion. As Rayna Green observes, "[W]hile scholar ship cannot claim to empower or dignify anyone, it can reveal the ways in which empowerment and authorization take place" (5). The tales were collected from young women originating from the rural area of the region of Fatick who work seasonally as housemaids in the city. They were recorded over three nights in November 2004 while they were being performed in front of a small audience, mainly composed by friends. These young women hold such sessions to entertain themselves, reconnect with their home culture after a day's work in the city, and recreate the missed homey village evenings. On the whole, the stories primarily feature female characters. Some protago nists act and alter the course of things, or are agents in the transformation of the status quo, while others abide by the generally accepted norms. A number of tales bear resemblances to existing ones, such as "Kumba the Orphan" and "Ngoor and the Beans," but occasionally there are some unfamiliar ones. The familiar narra tives deserve to be dwelt on and read together with those they seem to retell or transform. There are changes due to circumstances inherent in the historical or situational paradigms that exist in a given society. As Carole Boyce Davies puts it: "[T]he oral tradition not only provides an important bridge to the study of nar rative strategies in written form, but it is elemental in the definition of a group's aesthetic and psycho-social dynamics" (166). As a result, a critical perspective on the tales allows the identification of behavioral patterns and beliefs that govern the gender structuring of a community. Similarly, it makes possible an analysis of the manner in which structuring prin ciples are deferred to or defied. From this perspective, the transformational trends, namely, the ideas and practices that present women in positive roles and grant them a comfortable space in the social formation, will be traced in each story. This study will be attentive to how marginality affects or does not affect the women represented in the folktales. Thus, it will consider how marginality "lends women the capacity to remain detached from the status quo. Their peripheral position may also reference an incompatibility with established norms, leading to innovation, especially in expressive domains" (Young and Turner 17). The approach to the stories examined herein considers the coding strate gies used in them to deal with power and marginality In this respect, Joan N. Radner and Susan S. Lanser suggest that "coded messages may ultimately help to empower a community and hence to effect change" (4). As feminist readers, they believe that coding may allow women to communicate feminist messages to other women of their community; to refuse, subvert, or transform conventional expectations; and to criticize male dominance in the face of male power. At the same time, because ambiguity is a necessary feature of every coded act, any instance of coding risks reinforcing the ideology it is designed to critique. (23) Thus, we shall be searching for an alternative subterranean discourse within the story. As we shall see, some stories overtly empower women on their own, others relate such empowerment to men's support, while others call upon divine, super natural intervention. In the process of collecting the folktales on which this essay is grounded, it became apparent that most of the stories were not really tales in the way this genre</page><page sequence="4">OMARSOUGOU 29 is generally understood. They were rather entertaining stories, akin to jokes; some of them are pithy, lewd, and/or humorous. This type can be classified as maye, meaning "giving" in Wolof, certainly to "give a story," or simply to tell. What is of note is that people nowadays hardly make a distinction between leeb, a tale, and that type akin to the tall tale. According to Senegalese collective memory, a tale must not be told in daylight, while a maye may be told any time of day. The com plexity of the matter appears even more while re-reading Contes du Baol. Many of the tales would qualify as maye in that they are tall stories, bawdy, and humorous. A tale would be regarded as more serious than a tall story, however entertaining or fabulous it may be. Tales are means of expression, entertainment, and teaching. On this issue, Taban Lo Liyong writes in his introduction to Women in Folktales and Short Stories of Africa: Creative works, whether folktales or short stories, by their very nature as teach ers of morality do not concentrate only on well-lived lives. Folktales and short stories are created, in part, to censure failure, rule-breaking, and all manner of reprehensible acts with a view to correcting them. [...]. Good men and women go to heaven; bad men and women, because of their deeds, remain in the folk tales and short stories serving as negative examples to be avoided, (iv) Thus, a gender-informed reading or hearing of such stories grounded on the assumptions in them helps to retrieve the prevailing ideological views in the communities they issue from and to see the attitudes they foster. The voices of the young female storytellers can be heard in and outside of the stories. Accordingly, this analysis will attend to both the characters' voices and to the tale-tellers' han dling of the stories. As mediums and interested parties, do the storytellers endorse the values conveyed in the stories by telling them as they have been passed down? Do they distort the formulaic pattern and retell the stories, or simply create new tales? For the purposes of this paper, I have selected five stories out of fifteen as grounds for interrogating conceptual and structural mechanisms that govern women's and girls' subject positionality in Senegal. The first tale, "Maimouna," is about the eponymous heroine's life as an orphan in a polygamous household after her mother's death. "Maimouna" presents the stereotyped figure of the wicked stepmother bent on removing her stepdaughter from the family economy. In contrast to the stepmother's hostility, the female hero's relationship with her half-sister is reversed into a friendly and complicit one, so the victimized, motherless girl finds solace in the love and care of her half sister. Their sibling bonding questions the archetypal rivalry and jealousy between and among co-wives' children. Maimouna's half-sister constantly redresses the unfair treatment her own mother inflicts on her sibling. This daughter confronts her mother when she realizes her foiled attempt to kill Maimouna, and reports her to their father. There follows the punishment of the wicked stepmother. Her husband banishes her from the village "so that in Alamar people stop saying a stepchild is not like one's own child." Besides indicating tensions in polygamous households, this tale deconstructs the proverbial phrase that closes it: doomi jiitle du doom, that is, "a stepchild is not like one's own," a piece of popular wisdom usually attributed to Kocc Barma, a mythical figure to whom a number of sayings in Wolof society are credited (Gam ble 19,101, 139). The signification of this proverb is encoded in the second tuft of</page><page sequence="5">30 ? RESEARCH IN AFRICAN LITERATURES ? VOLUME 39 NUMBER 3 hair on Kocc's son's head. Kocc is reported to have shaved the head of his son in an unusual fashion, leaving on it four tufts of hair. Asked about the meaning of this strange haircut, he explains that each of them denotes one truth that only he and his wife know. The first, buur du mbokk, means a king is no kin (he may turn against you any time). The third, jigeen soppal te bu woolu, is a piece of advice to a man to love his girlfriend or wife, but never trust her blindly. The fourth, magg matna ba cib d?kk, signifies that it is good to have wise elders in a community. A version of Kocc's story is found in the lead story of Lo Liyong's Women in African Folktales and Short Stories titled "The Four Truths." Two of the sayings refer to wives, stepmothers, and siblings. As with Kocc, a man asked his wife to arrange her hair in four parts, to each of which he gave a meaning, and defied anyone to find the key to this riddle that only he and his wife had. His wife let the secret slip and nearly sent the man to his death. These four truths are: "a wife is a stranger," "a half-brother from a stepmother is a stranger," "a dog is a loyal friend," and finally "a mother's brother is a loyal friend" (1). Although the tale "Maimouna" challenges the view of stepchildren held in collective consciousness and upholds bonding and solidarity between half-sisters, it disempowers the mother as a woman victimizer of a girl. Sayings sometimes inspire folktales; indeed, some of the tales in our collection, like this one and the last to be read in this paper, are founded on proverbs they either use as titles or morals to close them. Tale number two, Njangum Jigeen, "Education for Girls," takes place in Togolo. Like the first tale, it involves three young female protagonists: an unnamed eldest sister; Awa, the middle one; and Fatma, the youngest. The setting is defined as a Muslim space, and the three girls are shown protesting at the beginning of the story against their being sent out to fetch water, a gendered chore, while their brothers are studying at the daara (Qu'ranic school). The girls are eager to recite the suurah they have been learning in order to be on par with the others. The narra tive contrives an accident: they fall into a well and sustain severe injuries, as does their first rescuer, an elderly man who jumps into the well to hoist them up. Once they are finally rescued and taken to the hospital, the villagers call a meeting in which it is decided that "boys and girls alike will go to school or the daara." The king implements the ensuing decision: "From now on, strong men will go to the far bore-holes or wells to draw water for sale in the village. Any woman sending her daughter to fetch water will be banished from the village." This story voices protest against discriminatory practices based on gender in a place where religious and secular modes of acquiring knowledge coexist. In the distribution of speech in the story, dissidence and willfulness are typically expressed in the voice of the youngest sister. Conversely, the eldest sister is prone to compromising: "[W]e all want to go to school, but we have to help our mother," she replies to the younger ones. For many girls in modern times, this quan dary results quite often in large numbers of female dropouts from primary and secondary school. The outcome of the story calls for communal awareness and action, one safe avenue to achieve any lasting solution in this social environment. The tale resembles more an imagined narrative than a retelling, and is apparently a newly created one that highlights a discourse of resistance and calls for radical transfor mation. Such a change will bring an end to victimization and inequity. The decree</page><page sequence="6">OMARSOUGOU M 31 makes a clear point about this. The reversal of roles in having able-bodied men take over the girls' domestic water-fetching chore in faraway Sahelian places is noteworthy. It marks the tale's challenge of the dominant ideology that privileges schooling males over females. The story thus evokes an advocacy that tallies with the present-day campaign for education for all, especially for girls. The presence of a school and a hospital delineates the temporal location of the story, showing that the storytellers make use of their new environment in creating their narratives. Finally, this tale features among those that are created for a purpose. It lays down a narrative of girls' curtailed opportunities. Oddly enough, it targets women found guilty of continuing the proscribed gendered practice. Just as in the first tale, it is women who thwart their own kind or are likely to break liberating laws such as this one in pursuance of conventional roles. This suggests that by making women endure such constraints, the texts remain in the worldview of the collective memory, despite a pronounced intent to revolutionize. Or does this mean that this generation of women?the mothers?must be compelled to change? The following tale goes on emphasizing the weight of customs. Maye ku begul, or "marrying someone against her will," the third tale in the list, tackles the issue of arranged marriages. The narrator starts by stating the hegemony of men in these words, "[I]n that village, [Gawaan] only men are entitled to make decisions. Women are not asked their opinions about anything." With this backdrop, the tale revisits sister and brother relationships as they are determined by social praxis. An uncle decides to marry his niece to his son, whom the girl has never seen. His sister yields to his demand, thus complying with the normative behavior: "[Y]ou are my elder brother and I don't want to disobey you," she says. The mother grapples with two loads weighing on her, the gender ascrip tion and the rule of seniority, whereas the daughter uncompromisingly rejects her uncle's plan, and threatens to commit suicide, which she eventually does in protest against the deal. As in the previous story, but more seriously, disaster induces changes that do not happen through female agency but because of the devastating consequences of gendered prescriptions. Helplessness turns into release once calamity occurs. Tragedy then brings about awareness of the wrong and causes communal penance. The narrator concludes the story in this suggestive manner: "[S]ince that day in Gawaan, men have stopped making decisions without consulting women first, especially in matters of marriage." The rebellion forcefully expressed in the sui cide of a girl is voiced in this moralizing way. The story again seems to be created by a younger generation of women as part of their own narratives that challenge the traditional discourse. Folktale four uses Kocc Barma's third maxim referred to above as a title: Jigeen soppal te bul woolu, which means women must be loved, but not trusted. While tale one invalidates Kocc's pronouncement about the stepchild, this story reasserts rather than questions Kocc's view of women. As the title heralds, the tale reinscribes the dominant ideology's assumptions, albeit told by a woman. Three discourses intersect within it: the proverb that serves as a title and a frame for the story and two known folktales based on popular sayings, one of which pertains to the animal tale. The latter tale becomes, in the new blend, an inverted version of the original that involves a speaking lion and a young man for whom a young woman is substituted.</page><page sequence="7">32 M RESEARCH IN AFRICAN LITERATURES VOLUME 39 NUMBER 3 In Jiggeen the narrator produces a tale in which Salimata, the female protago nist, starts a friendly relationship with an anthropomorphic lion and behaves like the young man in the original by offending the lion in exactly the same way. As the story goes on, Salimata, the family breadwinner, earns a living by her younger brother's sale of the firewood she collects in the wild. One day a hunting lion spares her life out of pity and befriends her, even offering to help in her wood collecting, provided she promises to keep their friendship secret. However, at a women's meeting Salimata discloses their secret, adding that the lion has very bad breath, just as the young man does in the original story. The beast overhears this and chides Salimata for indecency and backbiting; he then bids her to strike him on the face with a machete. Days later the lion, now completely healed, meets Sali mata to remind her of another proverb, "physical injury mends but moral wounds take time to heal, if they ever do; foul words are never forgotten." Furthermore, the story bears intertextual connections with another well known story, "Ngor Niebe," in other words, Ngor and Beans. This tale, collected in Birago Diop's Les contes d'Amadou Koumba, popularizes the assumption that women cannot keep secrets (41-45). Requesting a token of love, a young woman talks her fianc? into promising her to eat beans, which he has vowed never to put into his mouth. At the insistent request of his sweetheart, the man relents, pleading with her for secrecy; she must never reveal that he has eaten beans. But she confides in her bosom friend that Ngor is going to eat beans, then that friend confides in her best friend, the latter in her best one, and so on. Jiggeen appropriates both tales and the titular proverb in a narration by a female voice to produce a story that at first glance does little to challenge the ste reotypical views on women. But upon closer examination this conflation of the three texts may be assimilated to a form of coding similar to Radner and Lanser's concept of "appropriation": By this term we designate coding strategies that involve adapting to feminist purposes, forms or materials normally associated with male culture or with androcentric images of women. What we are calling appropriation encompasses some aspects of Barbara Babock's notion of symbolic inversion, and Luce Irigaray's concept of ironic mimicry in which a patriarchally designated feminine position is repeated with exaggeration in order to expose it. (11) By the same token, Salimata's dealing with the lion, as we shall see, could compare to what Maya Angelou terms "the reverse principle" in Why the Caged Bird Sings, that is, "the turning of a negative stereotype against the stereoptyper-another aspect of appropriation" (Radner and Lanser, 13). Reading the tale otherwise may result in assuming that it signifies that male-centered ideology has been homog enized to a point of making women and girls accept social ascriptions. Clearly, the storyteller speaks from a subject position that is both gendered and under social regulation, and consequently she negotiates her message. In the light of this, although there may be no significant evidence of resistance on the surface, there exist coded undercurrents of dissent. Examining Salimata's compliance and acknowledgment of deceit in the face of the lion's grilling, it becomes clear that she admits to the "truth" of the male construction of women under duress and tries to resort to another coding strategy, that of "distraction," in the Radner and Lanser typology (15). That she replies to</page><page sequence="8">OMARSOUGOU M. 33 the beast "I was only joking" is a way of softening, diminishing the wrong as it were; a retreating ploy frequently resorted in recanting, or seeking apology for misdemeanor by "hedging," as Radner and Lanser would put it (17). These figu rative discursive modes allow covert ways of expressing forbidden discourses by substitution and "equivocating" through the use of "ellipses, litotes, passive constructions, euphemism, qualifiers" ((Radner and Lanser, 19). A pragmatics of Salimata's utterances shows that she resorts to multiple forms of verbal guile to get out of her scrape, "wax ba geen ci," as the Wolof phrase goes, she "talks her way out." A case in point is her seeming blame of women in this elliptic sentence: "As you know, women are ..." The most telling instance of a mock appropriation of dominant ideology is without doubt the manner in which the heroine dodges issues and impeaches women by use of the titular proverb that warns against trust in women. Her mouthing of the proverb expressive of the prevailing figuration of femininity as a qualifier of her own position in the face of the mighty lion, an impersonation of masculinity, is not a testament to a subscrip tion to this ideology but rather appears as an escape route, an implementation of Angelou's "reverse principle." Even though she is denied a reprieve, since she is killed and devoured by the lion, her dissenting voice states agency and social responsibility as the breadwinner of her siblings: "If you kill me, who will feed my brothers and sisters?" On the whole, this composite tale does not altogether endorse the prevailing discourse on manners, even though it presents the female subject as untrustworthy according to a prejudiced view sanctioned by the age-old proverb. This position is imposed, and accepted out of helplessness. The female narrator deploys a double voiced discourse in order to secure credibility for her story in the social framework in which she operates. The tale abides by the traditional code of conduct founded on honor, which the narrator endorses to the point of sentencing the heroine to the deadly fangs of the lion. Nonetheless, the text emphasizes female agency in the family in the same way as it magnifies female bonding, although a women's gathering is the place where Salimata breaches her covenant with the lion. The narrator's negotiation of a space in the discursive realm continues in "Aida," the fifth tale, which immediately follows. It features Aida; naming the story after her indicates her centrality in the events as a female figure. The setting is identified as Takoroko, a place where any baby girl that is born is killed together with her mother. Except for the murder of the mother, the tale is partly remi niscent of the pre-Islamic practice in Arab society; it appears also as an obverse appropriation of the biblical story of Moses. The Takoroko femicide policy is not given any clear justification until the end of the tale. The hearer is simply informed about the custom at the beginning of the story that initially elides the motives for it and foregrounds the ghastly deed by focusing on the fact itself rather than explaining it. Herein the stratagem differs from the tactics described above as part of the female art of dealing with power relations. The narrative voice engages the matter with a distinct commitment as a speaking subject who considerably reduces the distance between herself and her tale. She stands close to Famata and her newborn baby girl. Famata flees the village and hides in the hollow trunk of a huge baobab tree. She dies, undiscovered, by the time Aida has grown into a "long-haired, very polite and beautiful sixteen year girl." Aida decides to come out of the tree, and like a priestess, whenever</page><page sequence="9">34 M RESEARCH IN AFRICAN LITERATURES - VOLUME 39 NUMBER 3 there are rain clouds in the sky, she prays for the rain to fall everywhere except on Takoroko. By her entreaties to God she obtains justice at once in retaliation against the people of this land, inflicting droughts on them. The ensuing ecological dearth is metonymical of the suppression of life and creation that women ensure in the world; removing them from the land results in no renewal, no reproduction of the human species. Takoroko endures the shortage of rainfall, and hence a scarcity in production because it prevents reproduction by murdering mothers and female babies. Women's central role in and control over production and reproduction is foregrounded in this folktale. In fact, the recognition of this power dates back to precolonial Africa, as Achola O. Pala shows in a study of Kenya that partly uses folktales; the following remark of hers bears on the point made earlier: [L]es croyances concernant l'aptitude des femmes ? faire prosp?rer ou p?ricli ter les r?coltes, ou ? rendre les enfants malades et m?me les faire mourir, bien qu'elles aient un aspect n?gatif, expriment en fait l'importance capitale des fem mes dans la production alimentaire et dans la reproduction de la soci?t?. (67) [B]eliefs regarding women's supernatural capacity to cause prosperous harvests or to ruin them, to make children ill and even die, despite their negative aspect, assert in fact the paramount importance of women in food production and in social reproduction, (my trans.) In* Amadiume's reconstruction of traditional women's organizations in Igbo soci ety furthermore emphasizes the "privilege of ritual autonomy" they enjoyed, and she argues that "these institutions mirrored African matriarchy, from which we have inherited goddess religions and mother-focused myths, legends and folktales" (164). In "Aida" the mystic device rooted in traditional beliefs functions like what Harold Scheub in The Poem in the Story terms the "curvature" of the story (xi). Sch eub, in the face of the functionalist reading or hearing of stories, insists on the need to heed the poetic in them, and thus to allow their beauty to flourish. He remarks that "they are moral, but they are not morals [...]. Too often, when we think of story, we want to convert the story to what we think is history; we want to flatten it out, to see only its linear surface, and we miss the curvature of the story" (xi). While Scheub may be right in maintaining that dissecting the story in an all-out linear approach may destroy it by the end of the operation, still some attention must be paid to its ideological underpinnings. And he is aware of this fact, as he concedes that "stories are much more complex, more vital. Lessons, morals, and meanings are deeply entwined in human emotions, which is where meaning can be found, as well as wisdom and catharsis" (xi). Besides, Scheub sees in the story the ancient past forming, shaping, commenting upon our real life experiences. Story is a contextualization of our lives into the wider world and into the past. When we tell stories, we are always living the present by reliving the past: that is the way we make sense of the world. The experience of storytelling is that juncture of present and past, when the two come into emotional union. That does not mean that the experience, the story, of the present is thereby assuaged, life wiped clean. Rather storytelling provides context, not closure, (xi-xii)</page><page sequence="10">OMARSOUGOU * 35 Attending to the curvature in the story means for us not only looking for its artistic poetic core, but also unraveling the codes wrought in the story. The curvature is the place where the female storyteller's pursuit can be lodged. "Aida" mingles a number of folktale topos such as magic, danger, and lack. The latter is one of Vladimir Propp's narratemes that is overtly present in the story. But lack-drought?is caused by the Takoroko customs that are wont to eradicate one pole of the creation structure on discriminatory grounds. There is no hero dispatched in a quest to fill this lack. A heroine imposes the lack, instead, like the villain in the Russian tales; and only she can provide remedy She is both hero and villain. This combination of traits strengthens her, empowers her, just as magic buttresses her stand subsequent to the response she receives from heavens. Aida conjures a drought and nature fulfills her wishes, empowering her against those who have reduced her to a fugitive quarry and willed the extinction of women. Takoroko is deprived of rain, whereas the area around is lush and green. In appropriating these features of the priestess and medium, the text invokes the traditional role of the African priestesses also known as conjuring or obeah women in the black diaspora of the Caribbean and America (Davies and Fido 16, Pryse 2-3). Nina Simone's lyrics in "Obeah Woman" supplement the representation of this supernaturally gifted woman that tallies with Aida's might: I'm the obeah woman from beneath the sea To get to satan you gotta pass through me 'cause I know the angels name by name I can eat thunder and drink the rain Been through enough [...] There ain't nothing that I can't do If I choose to, if you let me [.] Ha I'm the obeah woman, above pain I kiss the moon and hug the sun You people from the islands Know about the obeah woman. Aida's mystical rise to a position of power sharply contrasts with the function of the man who chances to discover and spy on her, then reports to the king that the daughter of Famata is alive and well: "It is she who raises her hands to the sky saying: 'God, may rain fall everywhere except on Takoroko for they ill-treat women and girls, they kill baby girls and their mothers.'" Challenge, resistance, and threats to keep on wreaking doom on the community assert Aida's relentless response to violence against women. The power struggle in the tale assumes a significant outcome through the way in which the king reacts. He avoids conflict by inviting and indulging Aida, acting in conformity with a traditional view, summarized by Catherine Coquery Vidrovitch: Men have often worshipped female figures, for indeed, they have feared a power that they needed but could not control: the ability to give life, to obtain good</page><page sequence="11">36 * RESEARCH IN AFRICAN LITERATURES VOLUME 39 NUMBER 3 harvests for the community through fertility rituals, to intervene as mediators in complex marriage strategies and social relations among neighboring groups and villages, to diffuse quarrels, and to heal. It was generally women who were felt to be endowed with religious powers as healers. (46) Similarly, Aida builds for herself an image that questions the concept of the witch figure. In fact, the text preempts such a view; no one utters anything related to witchcraft when the heroine mysteriously reappears with occult powers. It is also worth noting that she is a teenager, whereas this kind of power is ordinarily held by mature or elderly women. Her character merges the dual representation of her mother and herself in one potent figure intent on eradicating prejudice against women and making justice prevail. Aida's might as a woman manifests itself in her securing a voice in front of the symbol of ruling authority, the king. Spurning court rules and protocol, she opens the discussion by addressing the matter squarely asking the ruler: "Why do you murder women and girls? Why do you cast women out of Takoroko?" The people reply: "Because they are consumers, they do not generate any income, whereas boys are producers and are easy to feed since they can hunt and fish." To this popular prejudice, the female hero opposes the work women do, insisting on the agency and self-reliance she herself has acquired. She does the same things as men to live: she goes hunting, fishing, and tills the earth in conformity to the ecology of the place in which the tale is set. The king's quick concurrence seals change; his verdict, like his counterpart's in the tale about girls' education, bans the practice adverse to women and girls, ordering respect and care for them. The story ends in a matter-of-fact manner, different from the usual formulaic ending "wishing heaven to the first one who breathes it." The storyteller wraps up her tale with this statement: "Since that day women in Takoroko are very respected and well treated. They are asked their opinion before any decision is made." The advocacy of gender equality in the heroine's own voice is strengthened by her last words: "It is in your interest to let girls live their lives as well as boys." This strong message calling for equity makes this tale one of persuasion and struggle. It debunks social attitudes and urges change by whatever means avail able; the one used here amounts to seizing the word, imagining transformation. This tale, in the tradition of the genre, conveys meanings in the juxtaposition and fusion of the real and the supernatural worlds. As Okepwho maintains: No storyteller can hope to succeed in his [her] performance of a fantastic tale unless he [she] brings it into conversation with contemporary reality; put dif ferently, no story, however extraordinary the details of its contents, can success fully avoid contact with the world to which it is addressed. The great tales of tradition continue to appeal to us not only because, at a larger symbolic level, they project values that continue to define our existence but also because, at a more immediate level, the narrator acknowledges the physical presence of his audience and the very environment that frames the activity that unites him [her] with them. ("The Art" 14). Here is a story that inscribes violence against the gendered subjects of society in its crudest form, the murder of women and girls, and erases it. It imagines the fate of</page><page sequence="12">OMARSOUGOU 37 women in society as a virtual state of death and marginalization, and dismantles this plight by combining traditional ingredients of the tale and relations of power. The tale encapsulates the figurative language and concerns expressed in the four other tales examined. Helplessness is resolved by spiritual power, but the will to change social attitudes and the metaphorical construction the tale achieves are important to note. The story holds an outstanding statement on women's issues. It voices advocacy, urges people to enact social transformation, to eradicate vio lence against women, physical or moral, and demands women's and girls' full participation in the decision-making process. The coded messages in the housemaids' tales are close to the rhetoric of the Millenium Development Goals, especially the first three goals: to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve universal primary education, promote gen der equality and empower women.1 Considering the politics of representation in the stories, the narrator is either aware of these issues, or expresses the natural need for self-development and recognition women feel when faced with gender discrimination. The protagonists acquire a space of enunciation (Bhabha 37) beyond the limits imposed on women in the social formation in which the stories are set; this space is attained in the center. Women and girls move from marginal locations to central subject positions. This is possible because the storyteller carves out such a realm by her mastery over her texts which she conveys through a well chosen language. Such stories will in turn be told to and by generations of youth that are bound to transform them at will. On the whole, the last tale subsumes the concerns highlighted in the others; it is one which consistently locates itself in a clear-cut counter-discursive field that it constructs. It wages a war early in the beginning of the story and pursues the battle throughout the text. No wavering or accommodation to the dominant discourse is perceptible in it. It stands at odds with a callous world which it vanquishes. ACKNOWLEDGMENT I wish to acknowledge the Fulbright New Century Program that made the production of this article possible.
