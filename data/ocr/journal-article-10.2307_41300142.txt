Cohen argued that no epigraphical rabbi could be identified with any known Rabbi despite the fact that there was considerable chronological overlap, especially at Bet Shearim and Joppa. Second, there was no positive connection to the clas- sical rabbinic tradition. In fact, some epigraphical rabbis were commemo- rated in ways that were unexpected of literary Rabbis: some epitaphs in Greek alone and, in the case of Bet Shearim Catacomb 20, burial in sar- cophagi with zoomorphic figures in the same general location as imported marble sarcophagi with anthropomorphic art and Greek mythological or religious themes.2 Furthermore, Cohen argued, rabbis - whether or not Thanks to: Ron Borzekowski, Shaye Cohen, Andrew Cosgrove, Maxine L.

It is very common, especially in Israeli scholarship for instance, to assert that Judah the Patriarch is buried in Catacomb 14 of Bet Shearim, and that in general Bet Shearim is the burial place of Rabbis. Recent work by Lee Levine posits that the epi- graphical rabbis at Bet Shearim are specifically in the circle of the Patri- archs but not "talmudic rabbis,'' although earlier of his work treated the interred in Catacombs 20 and 14 among "the rabbinic class."5 Rajak accepts that rabbis are Rabbis but doubts their significance.6 Few have provided serious criticism of Cohen's treatment, with the important ex- ception of Stuart Miller, whose recent work has challenged Cohen's view, precisely because this allows him to insist on a more extensive rabbinic role in Palestinian Jewish society. Most recently Ben-Zion Rosenfeld has addressed this material, arguing that the title rabbi was a formal one in both literary and epigraphic contexts.7 How can all these views be sustained? And is it possible to introduce some methodological rigor and coherence in deciding between them? In 3. Cohen, "Epigraphical Rabbis," 13-16. 4. See also Jonathan J.

I will argue that even an interpretation that identifies epigraphical rabbis with adherents of the rabbinic movement has to acknowledge the limited num- ber and scope of those rabbis. In many respects, my conclusions generally concur with Cohen's, and especially with his empirical minimalism. How- ever, the suggestion that the rabbinic use of rabbi as a title (i.e., designat- ing someone Rabbi X) continues Second Temple- period practice is not supported by the epigraphical evidence.8 Indeed, the great bulk of the inscriptions appears to date from the fourth century and later, and this appears to include the inscriptions from Bet Shearim. However we date the Bet Shearim inscriptions, the literary basis upon which a specifically rabbinic or even patriarchal interpretation of the burials is founded is rather weak. At the same time, there is limited epigraphical evidence that does imply a connection with the rabbinic movement. This evidence is rather later than the classical period explicitly covered by Palestinian rab- binic texts and points to incipient "rabbinization" in the fourth through the sixth centuries. NUMBERS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS In all, Cohen based his discussion on fifty rabbis attested in Palestine and another seven from Diaspora incriptions. Since then, additional examples from inscriptions (broadened to include magical texts and one papyrus letter) has expanded that number somewhat.9 At the same time, a number of the Palestinian epigraphical rabbis discussed by Cohen should proba- bly be excluded now (see below). Two inscriptions, one not included by Cohen, use the term "rabbi'' as a noun rather than a title: "Lord, help the Rabbi'' (Cyrenaica, 10); "two apostles and two rabbis'' {duo apojtuli et duo rebbitej, Venosa 8-9, Cohen, nos. 4-5). These are significant and I return to them below, but they do not, properly speaking, identify men bearing the title "Rabbi. 'I0 I cannot claim completeness, but a revised collection 8.

We will return to these questions presently, but let us for the moment accept the view that these are people with at least some measure of engagement with classical rabbinic tradition and its teachings. On present evidence (and acknowl- edging the gaps of knowledge about the Sasanian context), the phenome- non appears to be overwhelmingly a Palestinian one. Using older collections for convenience (and praying for the speedy publication of the inscriptions from Palestine), we can make the following approximations. Frey 's Corpus Inscriptionum Iudaicarum included 328 inscriptions from Pal- estine excluding Jerusalem (where the inscriptions are presumably dis- proportionately earlier). The twenty inscriptions naming rabbis make up about 6 percent of the corpus. By my rough count based on the indices of the official publication, epigraphical rabbis account for some one out of fifteen named men at Bet Shearim (6.7 percent). Of the inscriptions from Joppa in CIJ} five out of sixty-nine have rabbis (7.2 percent). Based on Naveh's collection of Hebrew and Aramaic synagogue inscriptions, nine mention rabbis out of a total of 110, about 8 percent.12 At most, the title appears once among Greek synagogue inscriptions (a plaque from Bet Shearim from the synagogue area) out of thirty-six inscriptions col- lected by Roth-Gershon, or 2.7 percent.13 Combining all the synagogue inscriptions gives us about 6.8 percent, more or less the percentage we have seen elsewhere. This number is exceedingly unreliable. On the one hand, the number of inscriptions bundles women into the total for com- parison. Although women are underrepresented in inscriptions, this prac- tice still underestimates the proportion of rabbis among men. On the other hand, the use of patronymics and the fact that occasionally more than one individual may be mentioned in an inscription means that taking a proportion of inscriptions excludes many individuals (mostly men) who 1 1 .

I exclude iii, Cohen, "Epigraphical Rabbis," nos. 12-13, since the inscrip- tion is based on a medieval report and cannot be corroborated.

My impression is that 7 percent is an overesti- mate of the proportion of rabbis. The synagogue inscriptions indicate a strong correlation between the title rabbi and the use of Hebrew or Aramaic. This appears to be true at Bet Shearim as well, especially in Catacomb 20. This correlation is inter- esting but not self-explanatory. Did rabbis (whatever the term meant) prefer Hebrew and Aramaic commemorations, or did families that com- memorated in Aramaic prefer the title rabbi' ? Without further information the question cannot be answered. The figure of 7 percent, if we take it as a rough measure of magnitude, is a bit easier to contextualize if not precisely interpret. To begin with, even if correct, it is a proportion within the subset of all adult Jewish men14 likely to have been commemorated as donors in synagogues or to have epitaphs inscribed in stone or to have been buried in inscribed sarcophagi - not restricted to the very wealthiest, perhaps, but certainly not the whole population. We have no idea what size that sector was, but assuming conservatively that it represents the wealthiest one quarter to one half of the adult male population, people bearing the title rabbi would have amounted to between 1.75 and 3.5 percent of the adult male Jewish population, and, extrapolating, between 0.5 and 1 percent of the total Jewish population.15 This is a very small proportion of the total popula- tion of Jews (and, again, perhaps an overestimation), although it repre- sents a larger number than the classical rabbinic texts give us to believe circles of Rabbis constituted. Still, less than 1 percent of the population is not so large as to change the basic picture of the scale of the rabbinic movement one might get from those literary sources: numerically small, although large enough to be visible as a social grouping, and perhaps to be influential among others if and when acting in concert and if geograph- ically concentrated or well organized.16 But if epigraphical rabbis should be understood as Rabbis, there is, as Cohen noted, surprisingly little that identifies them with what we know 14. But cf. 45, a seventeen-year old. 15. These numbers are offered as a way of concretizing scale. I assume that adult males are roughly 30 percent of the total population: Roger S. Bagnall and Bruce W. Frier, The Demography of Roman Egypt (Cambridge, 1994), 104, table 5.4. 16. A population of 200,000-300,000 Jews would give 1,000-3,000 "rabbis." By comparison, note Josephus's guess at the number of the Pharisees (6,000), Josephus, Ant. 17.42, and Essenes (4,000), Ant. 18.20 (so also Philo, Every Good Man Ij Free, 75) although first-century Judaea presumably had a larger popula- tion of Jews.</page><page sequence="6">316 JQR 101.3 (2011) of Rabbis from rabbinic literature.17 We should explore other possibilities. The proportion is probably too high to represent formal office-holders, unless, perhaps, it is a generic title for a variety of offices or one that continued to be used after the incumbent had left office. However, noth- ing in the inscriptions links the title to offices.18 The absence of clear indications of "rabbinic" knowledge or activity or of office-holding also makes it possible that the title is merely an honorary title favored by some people or families. Possibly, even probably, we need to consider some combination of these. How we understand these inscriptions ultimately turns on the question of whether the epigraphical rabbis can be grouped with the Rabbis of the literary texts. The argument for identifying epigraphical rabbis as mem- bers of the rabbinic movement requires one of two kinds of assertions: (1) that a particular epigraphical rabbi may be identified with an individ- ual Rabbi from the texts; or (2) that an inscription using rabbi demon- strates a connection with the rabbinic movement on other grounds. I would apply the following criteria. For identifications of particular named individuals, we need some basis beyond coincidence of names on which to make the case. For this reason, B. Z. Rosenfeld's proposed identifica- tion of several individuals in Catacomb 20 at Bet Shearim with members of the family of Joshua b. Levi is by far the most persuasive. Here there is at least a clear family relationship, with multiple generations and, in Miyyasha, a fairly rare name, and a reasoned if debatable chronology for burials in the burial hall in question.19 Still, there are problems. The 17. The only real exception is the inscription from Dabura mentioning the study house of R. Eliezer ha-qappar (12, Cohen, "Epigraphical Rabbis," no. 8; Naveh, ed., Mosaic and Stone , no. 6). See also 63-64, Cohen, "Epigraphical Rab- bis," nos. 55-56; Naveh, ed., Mosaic and Stone , no. 75, which conceivably (although far from certainly) reflects "rabbinic" piety, but the occasion is a father's donation in honor of his son's wedding, rather than "rabbinic" activity. 18.

Levi and his Wife Kyra Mega: Interpretation of Inscriptions from Beth-Shea'rim" (Hebrew), Cathedra 1 14 (2004): 29-32, 34-36. Unfortunately for this proposal, Miyasha is reconstructed (42, Avigad, BS III 22 and fig. 121; no photo of the inscription is presented), influenced, one imagines, by the knowledge that Miyasha was the name of a grandson of the literary Joshua b. Levi. In addition, the family relationship between the epigraphical Miyasha and Joshua b. Levi is not explicit in the inscriptions from Catacomb 20. Nonetheless, following the same procedure as for the three individuals from Catacomb 14 (below n. 58), the likelihood of one R. Joshua b. Levi and one R. Judah b. R. Miyasha from among fifty is quite low. As it happens, an epigraphical R. Joshua b. Levi was found near Sepphoris, 22.</page><page sequence="7">EPIGRAPHICAL RABBIS RECONSIDERED -LAPIN 317 argument has to rely on the special role of the Patriarchs at Bet Shearim (see below) and the reading Miyyasha is reconstructed by the excavators with no photo of the inscription in the publication. The second assertion requires specific reasons to view the named individual as a member of a rabbinic movement. The only truly strong case is the inscription naming the " bet midrcwh of Rabbi Eliezer ha-kappar."20 Here, the use of the title is linked to an institutional setting that is a regular element of rabbinic self-description, although a simple identification with the late tanna, Eleazar ha-kappar, fails on literary and chronological grounds.21 One thing we should not do in trying to address the question is to simply transfer the specific rabbinic meaning of rabbi or one of its variants onto epigraphic occurrences.22 Inscriptions are historically significant precisely because they reflect different social settings and relationships from those of our literary texts, and we should resist the urge to harmo- nize the two bodies of data.23 The title berabbi is a case in point. Of the fifty-eight epigraphical rabbis collected by Cohen, five came from Joppa.24 Four use a form of berabbi , out of the eight or nine inscriptions collected by Cohen using this expression; the fifth is fragmentary but may have this reading as well.25 The working assumption that the title reflects local preference or chronological development is both safer and more persuasive than imputing to the Joppa necropolis a disproportionately high number of exceptional sages.26 20.

Archaeological: Ben David, "Settlement," 178 dates the monumental building implied by the inscription to the end of the Roman or to the Byzantine period; see also 231, table 10, which assigns the founding of the site to the period 300-350. The epithet ha-kappar , or kappara is not sufficient to link the inscription to the rabbinic Eliezer or Eleazar: the recently discovered inscription bearing a R. Joshua b. Levi (22) also gives him the epithet kapparah. 22. Here is the fundamental methodological point of difference with Miller, Rosenfeld, and Millar. 23. The hold of rabbinic texts and terminology on scholars arguably accounts for the preliminary readings "Binyamin b. Yitshaq Rabban Torah," vii (not found by later scholars; a misreading?) or "Rabbenu Batenayah," xiv (rejected in the official publication). 24. 53-57, Cohen, "Epigraphical Rabbis," nos. 43-47, drawing on CI J II 892, 893, 895, 900, 951. 25.

This made it possible to view the title rabbi as predating rab- binic usage and to view both the rabbinic and the nonrabbinic use of the title as continuations of Second Temple- period practice, a significant point in favor of his general conclusions.27 Since Cohen's initial publica- tion, a number of additional epigraphical rabbis have emerged. From Pal- estine: R. Abun, R. Tanhum, and Abba Rabbi from Qasrin in the Golan; R. Ula from near Tiberias; R. Joshua b. Levi, R. Hesychios, and R. Yasa from Sepphoris or the vicinity, as well as a recently discovered epitaph (not yet fully published) of R. Ta[nhum] and R. Simeon; R. Simeon berabbi from Zoar; and a Ya'akov berabbi from H. Rimmon. Diaspora Rab- bis have been expanded by a fourth- to fifth-century epitaph from Italy mentioning Rebbi Abba Maris, and another from fourth-century Nawa in Syria commemorating "Arbiades, the Rabbi."28 At least two rabbis appear as clients in magical texts, one from Palestine and another from Borsippa in Mesopotamia, and one in a letter from perhaps the sixth century.29 Rahmani's date for Ya'akob berabbi in the second or third century would, if correct, make this in all likelihood the earliest of the inscriptions not included by Cohen. The others appear to date to the fourth century or later.30 Meanwhile, the seemingly early examples themselves now appear Synagogues of Archaeology and the Synagogues of the Sages One and the Same?," JQR 94.1 (2004): 45, n. 69. 27.

Misgav has suggested that Rab Hana in CI J II 1218 (xi, Cohen no. 49) should be read as a single proper name, Tah/hana. Two apparently early epigraphical uses of rabbi (xii, xiii, Cohen nos. 50, 51) are not really examples of the title (the term functions as a proper name or nickname), and one of these is a modern forgery.31 The two instances from the vicinity of Jerusalem were correctly treated by Cohen as uncer- tain in date (60- 61, Cohen nos. 52- 53). 32 Finally, another presumably early epigraphical rabbi, noted but not counted by Cohen (xiv), has dis- appeared: Rabbenu Batnayyah b. Missah cited from a Bar Kokhba letter. The official publication in P. Yadin II 56.9 is entirely different at this point, and the commentary makes no mention of this earlier proposed reading.33 If all this is correct, it is difficult to view the use of the title rabbi in rabbinic literature or in inscriptions as the continuation of Second Temple- period practices. The address rabbi or rabbo(u)ni is, of course, attested in the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and John, giving us late first-century, or in the case of evidence for habitation from the fourth century and later. Ben David revises the view of Zvi Uri Ma'oz, Ramat ha-goian ba-'et ha-'atika (Qasrin, 1986); Zvi Uri Ma'oz, "[Golan:] Hellenistic Period to the Middle Ages," in New Encyclopaedia of Archeobgical Excavations in the Holy Land, 5 vols. (Jerusalem, 1999), 1: 439-545, that there was no new settlement in the "Jewish" Golan from the late first to the fourth centuries. A third-century date cannot be excluded for the Qasrin inscriptions, therefore, but a fourth-century or later date is more likely. Report- edly, Mordechai Aviam and Aharoni Amitai dated 67, 68, from Sepphoris to the third or fourth centuries (Tessler, "Silent Sepphoris"), but it is not clear on what basis. 31 .

In general, however, in the fourth gospel, rabbi designates Jesus as a prominent, powerful personage rather than as a teacher as such. The very contexts of the two glossed references - John the Baptist's identification of Jesus as the Lamb of God; the post-resurrection appearance of the risen Lord - suggest this as well, despite the glosses.35 More promisingly, Matthew's discourse of chapter 23 specifically rejects the term rabbi for leaders among the addressees (Matt 23.8). I have long harbored the suspicion that the tradition invoked here origi- nally had rabbi in the literal sense of "my master" or "my lord" (with teacher, kathegeted, appearing two verses later), but in its present form and context the Gospel of Matthew clearly understands the address rabbi to be appropriate to a teacher, and to be claimed by Pharisees.36 Precisely because the passage is polemical, the association with Pharisees has to have enough to it to stick, but it cannot be taken as evidence that the form of address was exclusively "owned" by Pharisees. In any case, this passage and the Gospels more generally fail to give positive evidence of when, whether, and which men were known with the title Rabbi X. At the other end of the chronological range, Cohen noted that several of the synagogue inscriptions postdated the fourth century (14, 52, 58, 62; Cohen, nos. 1 1, 42, 48, 54). If recent work by Jodi Magness on syna- gogues is correct, synagogues as purpose-built buildings with recogniz- able architectures begin in the late fourth century at the earliest, and by implication none of the epigraphic rabbis from synagogues should be assumed to be any earlier than the late fourth century.37 Of the remaining 34.

Manuscript differences between didcuikabu and kathegeted serve as indirect support for this thesis and suggest that the correction may be later than the author of Matthew. 37.

In part, they relied on what they thought was the end of the village of Bet Shearim as well, but the village seems to have continued to func- tion considerably later.41 It is striking, too, that Catacomb 20, with its cluster of epigraphical rabbis, is the one catacomb with substantial evi- dence for later use, even according to Avigad's chronology. If we follow Ze'ev Weiss for the date of Mokim, the patriarch of a family with a num- ber of epigraphical rabbis, most of the rabbis in Catacomb 1 will have dated to the very end of the third or to the fourth century.42 Finally, if the two inscriptions bearing rabbis from the synagogue area are from the synagogue itself, these inscriptions too should be dated to no earlier than the late fourth century, although one of the epigraphical rabbis is the grandfather of the honoree.43 If these observations are correct, two inscriptions may still predate the Reconsidered," in Religion, Ethnicity , and Identity in Ancient Galilee: A Region in Tran- sition, ed.

As a consequence, one pillar of Cohen's argument has fallen away. Since evidence for literary Rabbis in Palestine falls off in the second half of the fourth century, while epigraph- ical rabbis now generally seem no earlier than the fourth century, there is little expectation that there be overlap between the two bodies of evi- dence. The inability to securely identify any epigraphical rabbi with a Rabbi known from literary sources would thus have little bearing on whether the epigraphical rabbis were, or would have been considered by their contemporaries to be, part of the rabbinic movement. The other pieces of Cohen's argument have merit, although I wonder how problem- atic figurative art on sarcophagi would have been for literary Rabbis of the fourth century and their successors.44 The question of how we under- stand the title rabbi in inscriptions is thus more complicated than Cohen left it in 1981, and any answer will turn on whether the title could either have more general application - a general address of respect - or other specific applications, such as for office holders or honorees. BET SHEARIM Turning now to Bet Shearim, where the greatest number of epigraphi- cally attested rabbis are located, the first thing to notice about the men with the title rabbi at Bet Shearim is that they appear clustered in specific halls of a few catacombs: Catacomb 1 (Hall G), Catacomb 14 (Hall A), and Catacomb 20.45 This strongly suggests family connections in the use of the title, and indeed in some cases this can be reconstructed.46 In 44. Avigad, BS III 164- 71, provides only summary find-spot information for fragments of marble sarcophagi (because they were in secondary locations), but if some of the explicitly mythological or religious themes originated in Rooms XV and XXII (where the rabbi inscriptions are) one might have to rethink the puta- tive piety of the "rabbis" in Catacomb 20 and their families. Note that the sar- cophagi of Rabbi Gamaliel (sarcophagus no. 117) and the daughter of Rabbi Joshua (no. 103) had zoomorphic figures on them (Avigad, BS III 103, [p. 144], 117 [pp. 143-44]; Rosenfeld, "Joshua b. Levi," 19 and nn. 21-22; Cohen, "Epi- graphical Rabbis," 12), but I am not sure that this warrants either Cohen's sur- prise or Rosenfeld 's exculpation.

Of course we cannot exclude other kinds of associations to account for the clustering. Arguably, the "priests" commemorated in Catacomb 1, Hall G, Room IV, arcosolium 1 are an association linked by their common priesthood rather than by their family connection to each other.47 It is, thus, possible to imagine epigraphical rabbis buried together because of their participation in a confraternity of rabbis. However, ties of filiation and marriage are more common, and to posit nonfamilial ties where rabbi is attested is to prejudge the meaning of the title. That epigraphical rabbis buried in proximity to one another are most likely to belong to the same families becomes significant in light of the arguments made about the epigraphical rabbis in Catacomb 14. In Hall A of Catacomb 14, there are three people commemorated by inscriptions: R. Gamaliel, R. Simeon, and R. Anina. The proposal made by Avigad and frequently echoed is that this is the catacomb in which Judah the Patriarch was buried, based on talmudic stories and the fact that Judah had sons named Gamaliel and Simeon. There are in fact two questions at issue, which should be kept separate. First, were the rabbis buried there also members of the rabbinic movement? Second, can they be identified with members of the patriarchal house or anyone else known from rab- binic literature? I deal with the second of these first. The evidence, such as it is, is very slight. To begin with, traditions connecting Judah the Patriarch and Bet Shearim are stronger in the Babylonian Talmud than they are in any Palestinian sources, closer both in time and geography to the functioning catacombs. It is in the Bavli that we are told that one should "follow Rabbi to Bet Shearim" or that he lived there as an adult before retiring to Sepphoris.48 The Palestinian Talmud can report that Bet Shearim is the locus of a case that Judah ruled on, and that he was buried there.49 The case in the Yerushalmi bears no implication that Judah lived in Bet Shearim.50 Separated from the Babylonian traditions and from the elabo- rate tissue of modern assumptions that has turned Bet Shearim and its burial grounds into a Patriarchal monopoly,51 the Palestinian traditions 47.

How- ever, the presence of at least one non-Gamalielide Gamaliel in Josephus, a few more in rabbinic literature, and the presence of at least two Gama- liels in Catacomb 20 undermine that basis significantly.53 Typically, iden- tification of those buried in Catacomb 14 with Judah the Patriarch and members of his circle relies on the tradition in the Babylonian Talmud about Judah s "testament/' a narrative that reflects an institutionalized view of rabbinic academies that may in fact be from the from the latest ph ase of the Bavli. Here, Rabbi designates Simeon and Gamaliel his sons and Hanina b. Hama as rabbinic functionaries after his death. The Pales- tinian Talmud provides no parallel for the relevant details.54 The absence of Judah himself in Catacomb 14, and the presence of Hanina, who is not known to be a family member of the Gamalielides, and with an epithet by which Hanina b. Hama is not known in rabbinic literature, are obvi- ous weaknesses, and Avigad can only explain these features by assuming the social significance both of Judah and of rabbinic burial.55 Ultimately, Avigad reasons from probability: 52.

Cohen, "Patriarchs and Scholarchs," PAAJR 48 (1981): 57-85, discusses the text and the phenomenon. Arguably, the Bavli here incorporates some version of the traditions at yTa'an 4.2 (68a) about the appointment of Hama b. Hanina (so Leiden MS, but in the sequel Hanina, which makes better chronological sense) after Judah's death.

Judah the Patriarch needed no inscription; these were in any case provided after the fact to aid "visitors praying at the graves of the Sages" (pp. 63-64).

Lifshitz in Schwabe and Lifshitz, BS II p. 148, n. 6, questioned the identification.</page><page sequence="15">EPIGRAPHICAL RABBIS RECONSIDERED- LAPIN 325 Can it be mere coincidence that three people called Shim'on, Gamaliel, and Anina ( = Hanina) were buried in one catacomb at Beth Shearim? Does it not seem more likely that . . . the logical conclusion must be that the people interred here are the very ones mentioned in the sources?56 Given the gaps in our evidence, that question from probability cannot be definitively answered, but we do have enough data to make some esti- mates, and, statistically, it may indeed be mere coincidence. From the frequency of the names of Jewish men, it is possible to calculate the probability of randomly selecting a single name or a group of names. We do not, however, want to know the probability of finding a R. Gamaliel, a R. Simeon, and a R. Hanina in a single cave.57 Our question is, rather, how likely it is that the rabbis Gamaliel, Simeon, and Hanina buried in Catacomb 14 - who may have been buried in any order over the entire century and a half (or more!) that Catacomb 14 was in operation - are the particular bearers of that name known from talmudic stories. First, how likely is it that a catacomb with as many burials as Catacomb 14 would have three men with precisely these names titled rabbP. (In the absence of hard evidence, I will assume the number of burials to be fifty.) That probability is exceedingly small. Second, what is the total number of Jewish men within the catchment of Bet Shearim during the entire period of active use? That number is very large. (I assume it to be 350,000.) Multiplied, these two figures would give us the number of times we could expect to select fifty men and find precisely one Hanina, one Gamaliel, and one Simeon, within this population.58 If the distribution 56. Avigad, BS III, p. 63. 57. Because there were many names in use distributed across the male popula- tion, the probability of finding any one is fairly low, and the probability of finding a cluster of three, further reduced by the probability of their bearing the title rabb', is inevitably tiny. Thus, the probability of finding an Eleazar, a Joseph, and a Judah (the three most common male names in Ilan, Names, 56, Table 9) is about 0.07 percent. If we factor in the likelihood of each bearing the title rabbi the probability is effectively zero. 58. The procedure is thus: (1) Calculation of the multinomial probability using the probabilities for the individual names given by their frequency, in fifty trials. (2) Multiply the resulting probability by the total population of men who could have been buried Bet Shearim. The result is to the number of times we could expect the same result over the entire population. Total population of all males over the century and a half is taken to be 350,000. (A Jewish population of about 250,000 in northern Palestine would imply an adult male population of about 75,000. Assuming, an annual death rate of 2.5/thousand, made up by sufficient new males to keep population steady, yields 356,250. Assuming a larger popula-</page><page sequence="16">326 JQR 101.3 (2011) of names in volume 1 of Tal Ilan's Lexicon of Jewish Named is roughly representative, this could have occurred about 130 times.69 The implica- tion is that there is fairly little likelihood (a one in 130 chance) that the epigraphical rabbis are identical with the Gamaliel, Hanina, and Simeon of the Bavli's story. By that measure, the similarity in names in Catacomb 14 to those in a rabbinic story is thus very possibly accidental. If not identical with the literary Rabbis in question, were Hanina, Simeon, and Gamaliel, together with other epigraphical rabbis, literary Rabbis nonetheless? The honest answer must be that we do not know. If we cannot securely identify them with known Rabbis, then, as Cohen argued in his treatment, we have little positive basis for associating the epigraphical rabbis with the rabbinic movement.60 Three names in Cata- comb 14 give us almost nothing to work with. The modestly larger group in Catacomb 20 seems to represent families that have a marked prefer- ence for Hebrew and the title rabbi, and it includes a few pious formulae not known elsewhere at Bet Shearim, one of which is based on Scripture: zekher Uadik ( im) Li-vrakha ; 'amida[tan "un ha - Uadikim ?] Inscriptions in Greek in the entry corridor call the interred holy fathers ( bodioi patereJ) and wish good luck upon resurrection, but neither of these expressions is completely unexpected here.62 I had initially thought that the names used tion, say 300,000 Jews and 100,000 adult males, yields 475,000 over the extended period and increases the likelihood that the result is accidental.) 59. The number is appropriately small. By comparison, following the same procedure but for the three most common men's names in Ilan's collection (above, n. 57), the number of possible clusters is close to 4,000. Herewith, the requisite qualifications and caveats to the discussion in the body of the article. The conclusion is only as good as the data. Ilan, Names, vol. 1, draws on a very large pool of names from different kinds of sources, so that selection errors should cancel each other out, but its chronological range only partially overlaps with Bet Shearim. Volume 2, when published, will offer a better basis. For comparison, I have also calculated the number of possible clusters based on the names of tannaim in the Mishnah (Hanoch Albeck, Introduction to the MLihna [Hebrew; Jerusalem, 1959], 222-33), yielding 637 clusters; Palestinian amoraim (Albeck, Introduction, Talmud, index), yielding 67.9, and the inscriptions from Bet Shearim (indexes to Schwabe and Lifshitz, BS II; Avigad, BS III), yield- ing 7.87. Problematically for the argument made here, if the distribution of names at Bet Shearim is representative of the wider population, Avigad 's argument from probability is rather stronger. 60.

Of the eleven names attested in Catacomb 20, some would be on any list of prominent Jewish male names (Judah, Joshua, Eleazar, Jonathan), while some of the names that are most prominent in the Mishnah and Yerushalmi (e.g., Simeon, Joseph/ Yose, in the Mishnah; or Abba, Isaac, Jacob, Samuel, or Hiyya in the Yerushalmi) are absent at Catacomb 20. If not Rabbis, then what? An alternative possibility is that the title rabbi that appears in inscriptions was conferred for certain functions or tasks or as a communal title separate from the rabbinic movement. For this, too, there is no positive evidence at Bet Shearim, but it is worth exploring briefly because it is one area where the Yerushalmi may imply the existence of nonrabbinic rabbis. One of the few social preferments for which Rabbis are described as competing is "appointment," minui. In Palestinian rabbinic literature, appointment, when further specified, may be as an "elder" or "sage" (whatever that means) or to perform specific ritual functions (releasing of vows, setting the calendar, evaluating men- strual stains). To a great extent - but not exclusively - the Yerushalmi treats "appointment" as a prerogative of the nasi, the Patriarch. But who- ever is doing the appointing, Yerushalmi Bikurim 3.3, 65 d, has some Rab- bis of the late third and fourth centuries complaining about ilui de- mit martin bi-khsaf, "those appointed for money."63 A reasonable interpre- tation of the statement of (A)shiyyan, "One who is appointed for money, one does not rise before him, one does not call him rabbi, and his cloak (i talit ) is like the saddle-blanket of an ass," is that among other things, there is a class of people appointed to functions or tasks who insist on the title (or at least the greeting) rabbi , to the displeasure of Rabbis. This discussion is relevant in light of the pattern of names in Catacomb 20, where we have seen a certain cultural "conservatism" appropriate to ritual and other "Jewish" functions. In addition, a cluster of seemingly "Patriarchal" names appears in Catacomb 20: three Judahs, three Gama- liels, and two Hillels out of a total of eighteen males. If this is not acciden- tal - Judah is the second most common name at Bet Shearim; Hillel and Gamaliel are rarer, but even in rabbinic literature Gamaliel and Hillel are not exclusively restricted to Gamalielides - it arguably associates the 63.

Shiyyan (fifth generation) is later than the other figures mentioned in this passage.</page><page sequence="18">328 JQR 101.3 (2011) interred not with Rabbis but with the Patriarchal house.64 If these are not members of the Gamalielide family themselves - a claim that would go well beyond any evidence we have - it might reflect onomastic assimila- tion to Patriarchal names, a phenomenon that might make more sense in the period of the ascendancy of the Patriarchate in the fourth century rather than in the third. The preference for Hebrew or Aramaic and the pious epitaphs among elite families make these precisely the kinds of peo- ple who might have sought "Jewish" functions and preferments within a late antique context in which non-"Jewish" avenues of advancement were still open.65 Putting these pieces together, we might view these inscriptions as the product of families that have successfully claimed "appointments," perhaps with some Patriarchal connections, and that style their men rabbi. This hypothesis is beyond proof. Its significance is primarily to illustrate that literary sources too allow of a nonrabbinic interpretation of the phenomenon of epigraphical rabbis. But does the epigraphical title rabbi necessarily refer to a function or a formal standing, whether rabbinic or nonrabbinic? Precisely the presence of the title rabbi for nearly every commemorated male in Catacomb 20, 64. See Levine, "Bet She'arim in its Patriarchal Context," 197-225, especially 209-10. Levine assimilates Catacombs 14 and 20 (should we assume two cata- combs for one family?) and posits that the interred were members of the Patriar- chal house. As for the question of probability, Judah is also the third most common name in Ilan, Named, 50, Table 7; the sixth most common tannaitic name in the Mish- nah; and the most common name among Palestinian amoraim. Following the same procedure as for Catacomb 14 above (but extending the pool of people in recognition of the size of Catacomb 20 and that the names appear in two rooms in the catacomb), the probability of randomly finding precisely three Judahs, two Hillels, and three Gamaliels who also bore the title rabbi among 1 00 dead is effec- tively zero. But this is not our question. A closer approximation to what we want to know is the likelihood that at leajt thu many Judahs, Hillels, and Gamaliels might be found in a pool of 100. This ranges from nearly 3 percent (based on Ilan, Named ), yielding nearly 10,000 such clusters across the population, to 6.7 percent (based on the distribution at Bet Shearim itself), yielding approximately 23,400 clusters. 65. The apodtoloi like Joseph and others surrounding the Patriarch mentioned in Epiphanius, Panarion, 30.4.2; ed. Karl Holl, GCS 25, 338 (whatever the histo- ricity of this account) probably fit this social type and at a time when, by most current scholarly accounts, Rabbis and Patriarchs had largely moved in different directions (e.g., Levine, "Bet She'arim in its Patriarchal Context," 214-15; Sacha Stern, "Rabbi and the Origins of the Patriarchate," JJS 54 [2003]: 214; Ben- Zion Rosenfeld, "The Crisis of the Patriarchate in Eretz Israel in the Fourth Century" [Hebrew], Zion 53 [1988]: 239-57).</page><page sequence="19">EPIGRAPHICAL RABBIS RECONSIDERED- LAPIN 329 including for a seventeen-year-old,66 together with the designation kyra , "lady,'' for three out of five deceased adult women whose names are pre- served suggests that we are dealing with a title preferred by families, rather than a rank conferred upon or claimed by learned masters. Simi- larly, rabbi does not seem to imply office-holding unless we also assume that families claimed the offices and titles for their members. I concede that Catacomb 20, in its cultural "conservatism'' - Hebrew, the title rabbi , biblical and other pietisms - may make the interred in that catacomb peo- ple from whom the rabbinic movement will have wanted to recruit mem- bers and support. This does not, however, appear to apply to Catacomb 1, Hall G.67 And as with synagogue inscriptions where Hebrew or Ara- maic also correlated with use of the title, it is impossible to decide whether families who preferred Hebrew or Aramaic also preferred the title rabbi, or people known as rabbi shared a common stance in regard to language and other forms of piety. Ultimately, my conclusion from a review of the evidence from Bet Shearim supports Cohen's: rabbi at Bet Shearim does not clearly refer to members of the rabbinic movement. It cannot be shown to reflect a spe- cific communal function or rank. What limited evidence there is suggests that the title runs in families and may reflect nothing more than family preference and self-perceived rank.68 This argument is weaker than when Cohen first made it, particularly in light of the disappearance of the early epigraphical rabbis. If Rabbis are not extending or appropriating a nomenclature that predates the movement, then a significant practice of using the title rabbi outside of rabbinic circles can only be posited but not proven. EPIGRAPHY AND RABBI NIZ ATI ON The implication of the above argument is that evidence for the role of Rabbis and the rabbinic movement outside of rabbinic texts, where they necessarily loom large, is largely absent. Much the same is true of most of the remaining epitaphs, from Joppa and elsewhere, and of the synagogue inscriptions. One inscription, not predating the fifth century, mentions "Rabbi Yohanan the priest, the scribe, berabbit" but even this implies only 66. Most of the males commemorated, and nearly all of those who are named, have the title (see above, n. 45). Exceptions are Avigad, BS III 13, read as a man's name ( Ahiyah) not "her brother"); 21 (three unnamed sons sharing a sarcophagus, presumably children?); 27 (fragmentary). 67. See, already, Levine, Rabbinic Cltuij, 49, n. 32. 68. Note, however, the possibility that Rabbis, too, used the title as hereditary: Gedaliah Alon, "The Sons of the Sages" (Hebrew), in Studies 2:58-73.</page><page sequence="20">330 JQR 101.3 (2011) that Yohanan was a scribe, not that he was learned in rabbinic Torah.69 A stronger case, datable to around 450 C.E., identifies the deceased as rabbi . . . be-rabbi , and concludes "may the sage ( hakham ) rest in peace."70 Here, and in an undated letter addressed to a "rabbi" by someone who designates himself "disciple,"71 the terminology and relationships of liter- ary Rabbis and epigraphical rabbis begin to overlap. A very few epigraphic texts do unmistakably point to the rabbinic movement. The first has already been mentioned: the "bet midrcuh of Rabbi Eliezer ha-Qappar" (12, Cohen no. 8), but so has its probable date: the fourth century or later. The collocation of the title rabbi with an institutional setting otherwise unattested in inscriptions, but closely identified with Rabbis themselves, makes a rabbinic interpretation likely. At the very least, then, the inscription would attest to the spread of the rabbinic movement and its institutions outside of the urban hothouse in which it flourished, and into at least one village in the Golan. This is significant in and of itself. What should we make of the named rabbi, however? He may be an otherwise unknown Rabbi who happens to share a name and epithet with a known Rabbi (or two) from more than a cen- tury earlier, and an epithet with another epigraphical rabbi from Seppho- ris. However, another possibility may be entertained: that late antique rabbinic circles created meeting places and invented histories for them that linked them to earlier antecedents. That, if it were true, would give us some measure of the institutionalization of the rabbinic movement. The second is the puzzling inscription from Rehov in the Bet Shean valley, and the still unpublished fragments of inscribed wall plaster from the same building.72 The mosaic floor (and the version on plaster) pro- vides the first exemplar of any rabbinic text and constitutes the only unquestionable archaeological evidence of the rabbinic movement.

Again, one significant feature of the Rehov inscription is that it attests clearly to the spread of Rabbis and rabbinic texts to a village in the territoriiun of Bet Shean by the sixth century, the approximate date of the inscription. Beyond this, three inscriptions, all from Diaspora contexts (8-11), seem plausibly - although not certainly - to refer to the rabbinic move- ment. These are interesting because they use a form of rabbi as a noun to classify a person, rather than as a title. Schwartz has already discussed the duo apOtituli et duo rebbiteo (8, 9, "two apostles and two rabbis") who offered dirges for the daughter of a local Jewish dignitary in Venosa.73 The names of the officiants are absent: they are known only as "apostles" and "rabbis." Less satisfactorily, because the context and syntax make interpretation difficult, an inscribed invocation on a column from Cyrene, "Lord, help the Rabbi" (10), similarly identifies the object of the appeal for divine aid as simply "the Rabbi." Palestinian rabbinic Aramaic came to designate the members of the rabbinic movement as "Rabbis."74 The usage ho rabbi or duo rebbitej echoes that usage, and it may be that the classification of some Jewish men as rabbi* was exported along with the title and the Palestinian men bearing it. Of course, if rabbi was also used for ritual functionaries of various kinds, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Venosa inscription (8-9), or Arbiades the Rabbi commemorated in Syria (11), refer to non- rabbinic rabbis. However, in light of the limited evidence we have for the expansion of the rabbinic movement beyond its circumscribed horizons precisely during the period of the late fourth to the sixth centuries, it seems reasonable to view these inscriptions too as reflecting an expanding rabbinic orbit of activity. CONCLUSIONS On balance, Cohen's minimalist position is safest, even if chronology and distribution have undermined it considerably since it was first articulated. On this interpretation, rabbinic texts and inscriptions and related docu- mentary evidence use the same honorific terminology but do not refer to the same set of social facts. Only one epigraphical rabbi can be strongly connected with rabbinic institutions, Rabbi Eliezer ha-kappar and his bet 73.

See the usages collected in Michael Sokoloff, A Dictionary of JewLih Palestin- ian Aramaic of the Byzantine Period (2nd ed.; Ramat-Gan, 1990), s.v. rah II, 2, p. 512. 15, from the Golan, is perhaps an example of this usage from Palestine as well.</page><page sequence="22">332 JQR 101.3 (2011) m 'idrcuh (12). Aside from problems of chronology, that one example con- nects Rabbi Eliezer ha-qappar with the rabbinic movement and its insti- tutions, but because the lintel stone is not in its original constructed location, we have little way of gauging the place of the study house within village life beyond the bare, but significant, fact of its presence. If we could be reasonably certain that the family of the epigraphical Rabbi Joshua b. Levi in Catacomb 20 of Bet Shearim was identical with the family of literary Rabbis, we could speculate about the interred at least in that particular room in Catacomb 20 and perhaps more broadly. For the present, Rabbis remain only minimally visible in the epigraphic and archaeological record among other late antique Palestinian Jewish men who may have shared broadly similar conventions of nomenclature and of commemoration and benefaction. Nevertheless, since at least one epigraphical rabbi may have been a member of the rabbinic movement, we must entertain the possibility that the representation of Rabbis among the inscriptions is broader than char- acterized above. Certainly, too, the Rehov inscription reflects the exis- tence and literary tradition of the rabbinic movement, as may other inscriptions. For those inclined to give the epigraphical use of rabbi a specifically "rabbinic" interpretation, another implication follows from the review here. As with evidence from Church writers and Roman legal texts, the limited epigraphic evidence points to the fourth century and later as the period where Rabbis became "visible" beyond the immediate confines of rabbinic texts. This would in turn suggest that the recent trend of viewing Rabbis as in decline from the mid-fourth-century onward, and replaced in social importance by priests, runs counter to the evidence on late antique rabbis.75 If inscriptions attest to Rabbis, they also attest to a period of increased rabbinic visibility in the inscribed envi- ronment. 75.
