Prince- ton: University Press (London: Ox- ford University Press), 1950. Cloth, ?,II. 15s. net. THE publication in so careful and splendid a form of the Roman and Hellenistic material on a site which offered such tempting possi- bilities in the earlier levels is a fine instance of the conscientious care typical of the exca- vator, Dr. Goldman. Dr. Goldman herself describes the buildings and habitation levels, which she divides into Early Hellenistic, Late Hellenistic, Early Roman, Middle Roman, and Late Roman Units, the circuit wall (mainly Roman), and the cemetery (third and fourth centuries A.D.). Miss Dorothy Cox gives a detailed account of the coins including a very interesting series struck at Tarsus both under the Hellenistic Princes and in Roman times when Tarsus was an autonomous city. The Islamic coins are left for a later publication. The lamps are discussed by Dr. Goldman and Miss Frances Jones and correlated with those of Corinth. Thus Tarsus Group I = Corinth VII; T. II = C.

T. VIII is a local group of the second and early first century B.c.; T. IX = C. XVIII; T. X = C. XX; T. XI = C. XXI; T. XII = C. XXII; T. XIII = C. XXIII; T. XIV = C. XXIV; T. XV is a local melon-shaped group; T. XVI is a local disk lamp corresponding to Loeschcke's type VIII; T. XVII = C. XXVII; T. XVIII = Waage's 44, 46, and 48 at Antioch; T. XIX = C. XXVIII; T. XX = C. XXX; T. XXI is a group of anthropomorphic lamps; T. XXII resembles a porringer and may not be a lamp at all; T. XXIII is a miscellaneous group. A num- ber of lamp moulds, all in plaster, were dis- covered but, with the exception of No. 466 from the Late Roman Unit, all belonged to the Factory Deposit which contained chiefly lamps of types XVI and XVII. Stamped amphora-handles are treated by Miss Vir- ginia Grace. Of the Iox examples found in these excavations 83, or perhaps 84, were Rhodian, and the Antioch material (unpub- lished but accessible to Miss Grace) shows an even higher proportion. Most of the Tarsian handles date between 300 B.C. and the early first century A.D., and a good proportion of the Rhodian ones were made before 223 B.C. Miss Frances Jones discusses the pottery. Most of it is 'unprepossessing, the ordinary everyday ware of poor and middle class households, but for that reason it is a sensitive and genuine indicator of ceramic evolution.' During the period from 6oo to 300 B.C. G6zlii Kule was outside the city, but sherds from this period are shown on Fig. I 19 in- cluding fragments of Little Master Cups. The next ten or a dozen figures illustrate Middle Hellenistic pottery (third and early second century B.C.), compared by the writer with Hellenistic wares from Cyprus; it also reminds me strongly of some unpublished Hellenistic material from a cistern at Cnossus. A fine series of Hellenistic Pergamene ware provides some profiles identical with those of Gaulish Samian but others unknown in the West. The Tarsus material is abundant and should provide many points for dis- cussion by Samian and Pergamene specialists. Some forms (Nos. 126 following) seem to be Tarsian in the strict sense, others (Nos. 133 following) can only be termed East Mediter- ranean. Tarsian Megarian bowls resemble those of Antioch and Samaria rather than those of Athens. No moulds were found at Tarsus. Egyptian contacts include some frag- ments of an Egyptian faience bowl and some sherds decorated in the Hadra manner; Unguentaria of the Hellenistic fusiform variety occur in Early Imperial deposits along with the bottle-shaped type more generally associated with that period. The Middle Imperial period shows a decline, but the evidence is largely from secondary deposits. The fine pottery of this period is mainly 'Roman Pergamene'. The kitchen ware is distinguished from that of earlier periods by its more rounded contours and by being ridged while on the wheel. Late Imperial remains (third to seventh century A.D.) are representative but scanty since they were swamped by the succeeding Islamic strata. The late Roman Red wares classified by Waage at Antioch appear also at Tarsus, chiefly in the form of late Red Ware C, suggesting that they were not im- ported to Tarsus much before the end of the fourth century A.D. Dr. Goldman herself reviews the terra- cottas, which the Tarsians must have manu- factured in large quantities. After a few remarks on the earlier treasure-hunting of Barta and Langlois she discusses the technical processes. Terra-cottas of the classical period are regularly crude horse-and-rider groups like those of Cyprus. Not till the third century do we find the purely Greek terra- cottas of Tanagra type with the plain cir- cular head-dress for children and young girls, later supplanted by the ivy-leaf head- dress which already appears at Tarsus in the second century B.c. The Hellenic heads often have heavy lids and half-open eyes, a dreamy type common enough in post- Praxitelean sculpture. In general the Tarsus terra-cottas are an interesting individual series, nearer to those of Egypt than to those of Tanagra or Myrina but lacking the most peculiarly Egyptian subjects. The Tarsus figures are realistic in a general way but avoid the caricature of individual idiots, criminals, and diseased persons, to which Hellenistic art is sometimes addicted in its more morbid moments. The catalogue of terra-cottas is grouped by subjects: I. Deities and Mythological Characters; II. Ritual Figures and Votive Objects; III. Theatrical Figures; IV. Realistic Plaques; VI. Miscel- laneous Female Figures; VII. Miscellaneous Male Figures; XIII. Children; IX. Archi- tectural Monuments; X. Animals; XI. Miscellaneous Human Figures; XII. Plaster Moulds. Dr. A. E. Raubitschek discusses the in- scriptions, all very fragmentary but including an interesting piece now in Newton Center, Massachusetts, and supposed to come from Tarsus, referring probably to the destruction in A.D. 308 of Musonius, a Vicar of Asia, with all his staff.
