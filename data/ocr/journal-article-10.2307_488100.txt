<plain_text><page sequence="1">Richard Wolin 135 The French Heidegger Debate by Richard Wolin Few events in recent memory have shaken the world of French letters as much as the appearance last fall of Victor Farias's book, Heidegger et le Nazisme (Trans. Myriam Benarroch and Jean-Baptiste Grasset [Paris: Editions Verdier, 1987]). Through an extremely thorough and pains- taking (and for French Heideggerians, clearly painful) labor of docu- mentation, Farias has single-handedly given the lie to four decades of inventive rationalizations concocted by Heideggerians - as well as by Heidegger himself on several occasions - trivializing the Master's alacritous participation in the "National Awakening" of 1933. It is no secret that since the collapse of the previous two dominant intellectual paradigms of the post-war era - existentialism and structuralism - Heideggerianism, as a philosophy of "difference," has enjoyed un- questionable pride of place. It is no small irony that Farias's book, while far from a theoretical tour de force, may well have paved the way for a new epistemological break in the volatile Parisian cultural world. Given the enormity of the debate his expose has unleashed, a signifi- cant intellectual shift would seem to be in the offing. Yet, there is one definitive outcome of the tumultuous events sur- rounding Farias's book that may already be discerned: from now on, French intellectuals in all walks of life will never be able to relate to Heidegger's philosophy "naively," that is, without taking into consid- eration the philosopher's odious political allegiances. In this respect, the debate spawned by Heidegger et le Nazisme is destined to become an inescapable reference point for all future discussions of Heideggerianism and its merits. If the relationship between the philosopher and his poli- tics were not integral, if one could make a neat separation between the</page><page sequence="2">136 The French Heidegger Debate philosophical oeuvre and the political engagement, then this outcome would be prejudicial. Everyone - great thinkers included - is capa- ble of errors of political judgment, even egregious ones. However, the more one learns about the Heidegger/National Socialism nexus, the more one is ineluctably driven to conclude that the philosopher him- self perceived his Nazi involvements not as a random course of action, but as a logical outgrowth of his philosophical doctrines. A careful cor- relation of the early philosophy with the political speeches of the 1930s leaves no doubt that Heidegger himself viewed his National Socialist activities as a concrete exemplification of eigentliches Dasein or authentic existence.' Heidegger himself makes a great effort to justify his partici- pation in the Nazi Movement in terms of categories carefully culled from his magnum opus of 1927, Sein und Zeit. Why Heidegger? Why in France? Why now? Have the true intellec- tual stakes of the debate been exaggerated beyond reason by an unpre- cedented degree of media hype (in newspapers, journals, and highly publicized television debates)? Or is it true that beneath the layers of publicity surrounding the controversy, the Farias revelations have in- deed unleashed questions of major intellectual import? If the often quoted maxim, "Today, Heidegger lives in France" is true, Paris was the logical staging ground for such a debate. Without question, the major repercussions of the debate stand to be felt in Pari- sian intellectual circles, where Heideggerianism has been so dominant in the post-war years. Furthermore, the two major cultural and politi- cal evenements in France during the last few years have both been Holo- caust-related: Shoah, Claude Lanzmann's magisterial epic about the death-camps; and the trial of Klaus Barbie, which received intensive media coverage since his return to France in 1983. And, though there have been significant debates over Heidegger's Nazi past in France on at least two previous occasions, Farias's documentation2 incorporates 1. The most important of these speeches have been included in in this issue of New German Critique. 2. See the debate in the 1946-1947 issues of Les Temps Modernes which was spurred by the Karl L6with essay, "Les implications politique de la philosophie de l'existence chez Heidegger" (November 1946), reprinted in this issue of New German Critique. See also the further discussions of this theme by A. de Waelhens and E. Weil in theJuly 1947 issue of Les Temps Modernes. The second debate, which occurred in the Parisian journal Critique, was provoked by a review essay by Francois Fedier that attacked three books critical of Heidegger: Guido Schneeberger's Nachlese zu Heidegger (Bern: Printing Office, 1962), Adomo's Jargon der Eigentlichkeit (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1964), P. Huhnerfeld's In Sachen Heidegger (Hamburg: Hofmann und Campe, 1959). Fedier's essay, which appeared in</page><page sequence="3">Richard Wolin 137 the pathbreaking revelations of the Freiburg historian Hugo Ott.3 It is principally the additional revelations brought to light by Ott's archival work in Freiburg which have transformed quantity into quality. As a result of Ott's researches, the full extent of Heidegger's dedication to the National Socialist cause has attained the status of an undeniable fact; whereas previously, the incomplete documentation of the case, coupled with Heidegger's own disingenuous accounts of his activities, made it fairly easy for his devoted French supporters to parry any pos- sible blows to the Master's reputation.4 Thus, with the appearance of the Farias book,5 French perceptions re- garding Heidegger's political loyalties in the early 1930s have definitively changed: his involvement with the NSDAP, which could formerly be denied or trivialized, has now assumed the status of a permanent taint. The traditional contingent of French Heidegger defenders is at present scrambling to salvage what can be salvaged and his long-standing detrac- tors are basking, at least momentarily, in Schadenfreude, since what they have been suggesting all along now seems a proven fact. We shall return to Farias's study, as well as to the fascinating debate it has unleashed, after clarifying precisely what it was about Heideg- ger's activities as Rector that seems to have endangered his reputation as the greatest 20th-century philosopher in the continental tradition. One of the most reprehensible aspects of Heidegger's conduct is his the February 1967 number, was rebutted in articles by Robert Minder, Jean Pierre Faye, and Aime Patri, all of which appeared in Critique in July of same year. An overview of this debate can be found in B. Allemann, "Martin Heidegger und die Politik," in Martin Heidegger: Perspektiven zur Deutung seines Werks, O. P6ggeler, ed. (Co- logne: Kiepenhauer &amp; Witsch, 1969) 246-260. 3. Among Ott's researches, the most important are as follows: "Martin Heidegger als Rektor der Universitkt Freiburg," Zeitschnift fur die Geschichte des Oberrheins 132 (1984); "Martin Heidegger als Rektor der Universitit Freiburg i. Br. - die Zeit des Rektorats von M. Heidegger," Zeitschnift des Breisgau-Geschichtsverein 103 (1984); and "Martin Heidegger und die Universitit Freiburg nach 1945," Historisches Jahrbuch 1-5 (1985): 95-128. 4. Heidegger's own accounts of his Rectorship can be found in the famous Der Spiegel interview of May 1976: "Only a God Save Us," Graduate Faculty Philosophy Journal (1977): 5-27; and also in "The Rectorship 1933-34: Facts and Thoughts," K. Harries trans. Review of Metaphysics (1985): 481-502. 5. It is of more than passing interest to note that Farias first tried repeatedly to publish his manuscript in Germany - the country that has been his home for a num- ber of years now. He himself is a former Heidegger student and currently lives in Ber- lin where he teaches at the Free University - but met with rejection from all quarters. That the renewed debate over Heidegger's past has exploded in France has been no small source of embarrassment to German intellectuals, who are only now beginning to formulate their own interpretations of "Der Fall Heidegger."</page><page sequence="4">138 The French Heidegger Debate duplicitous effort to misrepresent the full extent of his past misdeeds. In his two published apologia,6 Heidegger consistently argues that he accepted the Rectorship not out of ideological loyalty to the National Socialist cause, but in order to preserve university autonomy in face of the threat of rampant politicization by Nazi extremists. In support of this claim, Heidegger cites the tide of his Rektoratsrede, "The Self-Affir- mation of the German University." But the facts of the case unearthed by Ott and others show that this explanation could not be further from the truth. Heidegger was a zeal- ous advocate of Gleichschaltung at the university level, and the university "reforms" carried out under his direction at Freiburg were among the earliest and most radical to occur in German universities during the months following Hitler's seizure of power. One of the most damning indictments of Heidegger's conduct was a personal telegram he sent to Hitler, dated May 20, 1933: "I faithfully request the postponement of the planned meeting of the executive committee of the German Uni- versity League until a time when the especially necessary Gleichschaltung of the leadership of the League is effectuated."7 Within a few months of his assumption of the rectorship, he assisted in the re-drafting of the university constitution, according to which the Rector would be ap- pointed by the state minister of culture - thus bypassing the normal democratic channels of the university senate, which had heretofore al- ways selected the rector by an open vote - and would assume the new tide of "Fiihrer" of the university. These events show Heidegger as an early and devoted apostle of the "Fiihrerprinzip." A closer look at Heidegger's infamous Rektoratsrede of May 27, 1933 reveals a vast discrepancy between the implied theme of the tide - an apparent plea for university autonomy at a time when "politische Wissenschaft" (politicized scholarship) was omnipresent - and its actu- al political message, which on many counts harmonized with Nazi rhetoric and objectives.8 The address is replete with references to the Fiihrerprinzip and a community of followers to be led. The "will to 6. See note 4. 7. As Ott explains, this telegram contributed significantly to a Freiburg University de-Nazification committee ruling in 1946 that stripped him both of his right to teach and "emeritus" status, by virtue of which he would still have been allowed to partici- pate in university activities. 8. The existing translation of the Rektoratsrede is woefully anodyne. I have therefore re-translated all references from the recent German re-edition, Die Selbstbehauptung der deutschen Universittit (Frankfurt: V. Klostermann, 1983).</page><page sequence="5">Richard Wolin 139 knowledge" which determines the essence of the university is defined as "the will to the historical-spiritual mission of the German Volk [which] arrives at self-knowledge in the state." "Science and German destiny must come to power simultaneously," Heidegger goes on to observe. In his crass glorification of "German destiny," Heidegger not only panders obsequiously to the reigning authorities, but also em- braces a fatalism that turns the very idea of intellectual autonomy into a travesty. Or, as he notes in a similar vein, "all knowledge about things remains delivered over in advance to the supremacy of fate." Such remarks are part and parcel of Heidegger's general polemic against the superficiality of "so-called academic freedom." In a philo- sophical work two years later, he lamented the fact that the "Sduberung" or "cleansing" of the German university - here, a transparent euphe- mism for Gleichschaltung - had not gone far enough.9 Similarly, in the Rektoratsrede of 1933, Heidegger insists that the realm of the intellect must not be reduced to the status of a free-floating "cultural super- structure." Instead, it draws its true strength from "erd- und bluthaften Krdfte," "the powers of earth and blood." "German students are on the march," observes Heidegger. "They seek leaders." He leaves no doubt that the march is military. Students must fulfill their obligation to the "Volksgemeinschaft" by giving service (Dienst): "labor service," "military service," and, trailing in third place, "service in knowledge." Extrapolating from the philosophical frame- work of Being and Time, Heidegger suggests that it is "The questioning of Being in general [that] compels the Volk to labor and struggle [Arbeit und Kampfl." Together, the German students and teachers form a Kampfgem- einschafi, a "fighting community." "All volitional and intellectual capaci- ties, all powers of the heart and capabilities of the body must be devel- oped through struggle, heightened in struggle, and preserved as strug- gle," Heidegger concludes. Such usage of the word "Kampf' in 1933, two months after passage of the Enabling Act allowing Hider to rule by decree, and one month after the nation-wide institution of the first anti- Jewish decrees, left very little to the imagination of the audience. Although the Rektoratsrede consists of an uneasy admixture of Nazi rhet- oric and Greek philosophical references, the latter seem carefully tailor- ed to suit the political exigencies of the day. To take just one example, 9. Cf. An Introduction to Metaphysics (New Haven: Yale UP, 1959) 48, where Heidegger observes that "The state of science since the turn of the century ... has re- mained unchanged despite a certain amount of Sduberung .. ."</page><page sequence="6">140 The French Heidegger Debate Heidegger concluded the address with an epigram from Plato's Republic (497d), which he chose to render as "Alles Grosse steht im Sturm." He cites this remark following the aforementioned celebration of the vir- tues of Kampf and a concluding appeal to "the historical mission of the German Volk." When one recalls that the initials "SA" stand for Sturm- abteilung (the SA was well represented at Heidegger's inaugural lec- ture, moreover) and that one of the most virulently anti-Semitic Nazi journals was called Der Stiirmer, it appears that Heidegger's choice of epigrams - including his tendentious rendering of the Greek "episphala" as "Sturm" - was far from accidental.'0 Rather than struggling to preserve the autonomy of the university from external political encroachment, Heidegger zealously delivered it to the Nazi movement. His university reforms in the province of Ba- den were widely considered model instances of political Gleichschaltung to be emulated by universities throughout the Reich. That the inaugural discourse of May 27, 1933 was hardly an excre- sence is evidenced by the fact that it was only one of many addresses agitating for the "National Awakening" delivered by Heidegger that year. As intellectual documents these speeches are fascinating, for they are a hybrid of existentialist categories drawn from Being and Time and National Socialist rhetoric of the basest sort. For example, in his May 26, 1933 speech honoring the National So- cialist hero Albert Leo Schlageter, who had been executed for acts of sabotage against French occupation troops ten years earlier, Heidegger celebrates Schlageter's death in terms reminiscent of one of the key categories of fundamental ontology: Sein-zum-Tode or Being-toward- Death. Schlageter, Heidegger tells us repeatedly, died "the cruelest and greatest death." But, as those familiar with Being and Time well know, to endure such a death is one of the hallmarks of authenticity. Heidegger played an especially vigorous role as a propagandist on behalf of Hitler's November 12, 1933 referendum on Germany's with- drawal from the League of Nations. In one early November speech en- titled "German Students!," Heidegger begins by claiming that "The National Socialist Revolution is bringing about a total transformation 10. The usual English rendering of the Greek (in both the Grube and Shorey trans- lations) is "Everything great is at risk" or "is precarious." Heidegger therefore has willfully distorted the Greek "episphala" - in order to give it an ideological twist - by translating it as "Sturm," thereby rendering it compatible with the militaristic tone of the speech and the times.</page><page sequence="7">Richard Wolin 141 of our German Dasein." He concludes by observing that "The Fiihrer himself is the present and future German reality and its law. .... Heil Hitler." Many of the speeches of this period emphasize the need for "decision" - Entscheidung - in a manner highly redolent of one of the most important categories of Being and Time, "Entschlossenheit." Heidegger leaves no doubt concerning the fact that a yes-vote in the plebiscite - a "decision" for the Fiihrer - is in truth a demonstration of the "authenticity" of the German Volk." Another disquieting aspect of Heidegger's tenure as Rektor- Fiihrer concerns his employment of political criteria to judge university ap- pointments and dismissals. In a letter to the Baden state ministry con- cerning an appointment in the field of church history, Heidegger sin- gles out "fulfillment of National Socialist educational goals" as one of his primary criteria for the position, adding that a "political evaluation of the candidates [is] of fundamental importance."'2 In another case, that of the future Nobel-prize winning chemist Hermann Staudinger, Heidegger voluntarily played the role of infor- mer by seizing on rumors that Staudinger had been a pacifist during World War I (i.e., some 15 years earlier!) and alerting the National So- cialist Ministerial Councilor, Eugen Fehrle, in Karlsruhe. Soon the Gestapo became involved in the investigations, and Heidegger, asked by the local authorities for his personal judgment of Staudinger's case, stated that the civil service reform measures, demanding the dismissal of undesirables, should definitely be applied in the case at hand. Staudinger was forced to submit a letter of resignation. After a series of humiliating obeissances, he was allowed to retain his position - no thanks to the efforts of the new Rector-Fiihrer.13 Finally, in the heat of a controversy about a "political (i.e., pro-Nazi) appointment" to the Deanship of the Division of Law and Social Sci- ence, Heidegger offered the following policy statement: "Since the first days of my acceptance of office, the defining principle and the authen- tic (if only gradually realizable) goal [of my rectorship] is the funda- mental transformation of scholarly education on the basis of the forces and demands of the National Socialist State. ... What will survive of 11. On this point, see the analysis of Heidegger's speech, "Deutsche Manner und Frauen!", in the Karl L6with's essay in this issue of New German Critique. 12.

The sole certainty is that only our unbending will toward the future gives meaning and support to the merest effort. The individual by himself counts for nothing. The fate of our Volk in its State counts for everything."14 II The book by Victor Farias is, of course, at the center of the recent French controversy. Farias deserves credit for having ignited a long overdue debate about the taboo theme of the political dimension of Heidegger's work. But his argument about Heidegger's Nazi ties is so brazenly tendentious that, ironically, he ends up undermining his own case. As one commentator has observed, the true title of Farias's book should have been Heidegger est le Nazisme. For Farias, there are no gray areas. The question of Heidegger and Nazism is an open and shut case. National Socialism was not a political credo that Heidegger adopted opportunistically and then abandoned when it proved a political liabil- ity. Instead, for Farias, Heidegger was born a Nazi and remained one until the end of his days. To be sure, Farias is able to muster an im- pressive amount of evidential support to show that Heidegger's con- servative-Catholic background in the German town of Messkirch pre- disposed him to a "national revolutionary" solution to the evils of mo- dernity; and that Heidegger's partisanship for Nazi themes continued long after the point when his enthusiasm for the historical movement itself had waned (at least into the early 1940s). But to accept the results of Farias's inquiry at face value would be to conclude that both Heidegger's life and his thought are so irredeemably colored by Nazi convictions that nothing "uncontaminated" remains worth salvaging. In this respect, the book is truly a "livre a these," and this is ultimately its undoing. It is so negatively disposed toward its subject that the out- come - a rousing condemnation of Heidegger qua dyed-in-the-wool Nazi - is a foregone conclusion. Various commentators have com- pared Farias's strategy of argumentation - which frequently consists of juxtaposing the pro-Nazi sentiments of Heideggerian intimates or associates with those of the Master himself - with the tactic of "guilt by association," by no means an unfair accusation. In this respect, Farias has done a great disservice to his own cause. There is really little 14. Ott, "Martin Heidegger als Rektor der UniversitAt Freiburg, 1933-1934," 356.</page><page sequence="9">Richard Wolin 143 objective need for exaggeration or hyperbole: the facts of the case are gruesome enough and speak for themselves. The strategy of unnuanc- ed, wholesale condemnation has left Farias extremely vulnerable to at- tacks from the Heideggerian faithful, who have been able to seize on the prejudicial character of his inquiry as a clever way of delegitimating his efforts and avoiding coming to grips with the manifold, troubling questions that have in fact arisen. The "these" of this "livre a these" is fairly simple: that Heidegger was not merely a Nazi, but a radical Nazi, by which Farias means a supporter of the Rohm faction or SA. As he comments in the opening pages of his introduction, "Martin Heidegger's adherence to the NSDAP in no way resulted from an improvisational opportunism or tactical considerations. ... Heidegger opted for the wing represented by Ernst ROhm and the SA and sought to place this variant of National Socialism on a proper philosophical footing, in open opposition to the biological and racial faction led by Alfred Rosenberg and Ernst Krieck" (16-17). Were Farias to make this argument stick, he would thereby also rather handily dispel some facts that might prove troubl- ing to a more simplistic attempt to equate Heidegger with National So- cialism, e.g., the fact that Heidegger was later the object of calumnious attacks by the ideologists Rosenberg and Krieck (the Nazi Rector-Fiuh- rer at Frankfurt University who was also a philosopher). Hence, by aligning Heidegger with the SA, Farias can plausibly explain his later difficulties with certain Nazi authorities such as Rosenberg and Krieck by claiming that such polemics were a result of Heidegger's former SA allegiances.'5 Farias tries to prove his case by showing that Heidegger, on numerous occasions, cultivated especially close ties with the various German Student Associations in the early 1930s, which were at this point "gleichgeschaltet" and closely allied with the SA. However, the evi- dence Farias offers on this score is largely circumstantial and far from 15. The disagreements fall into the category of unpleasant harassment rather than anything more serious. Krieck - with whom Heidegger made common cause in the spring of 1933 in the interest of the Gleichschaltung of the Association of German Universi- ty Rectors - published several public attacks on Heidegger's philosophy as being ultim- ately incompatible with National Socialist doctrines. Rosenberg seems to have been int- erested in suppressing the publication of Heidegger's essay, "Plato's Doctrine of Truth." The essay was eventually published, very likely owing to the intervention of Benito Mussolini (!), who was informed about the matter by the Italian philosopher Ernesto Grassi. For more on the Heidegger-Mussolini connection, see Heidegger et le Nazisme, 273- 282 ("Heidegger et il Duce"). See also the extremely informative interview with Emesto Grassi (now aged 86 and living in Munich) in Liberation, 2 March 1988: 40-41.</page><page sequence="10">144 The French Heidegger Debate convincing. As Hannah Arendt has shown in her contribution to the Festschrift for Heidegger's 80th birthday,'6 the philosopher always had a large student following dating back to his Marburg years in the early 1920s. Moreover, since he was apparently convinced of the retrograde character of the German university system (as is suggested by his pole- mics against "so-called academic freedom" in the early 1930s), it follows logically that he would look to the German youth of the period as a pos- sible source of revitalization. Of course, there is no side-stepping the fact that in 1933, it was a "Fascist youth" to whom Heidegger directed his not infrequent appeals on the subject of national rejuvenation. In any event, Farias's contention that Heidegger was a radical Nazi and Rohm adherent is far from convincing. However, an interesting sidelight on the Heidegger-SA theme is shed in a remark by Heidegger in the "The Rectorship, 1933-34, Facts and Thoughts,""7 in which he claims to have relinquished any and every illusion concerning the au- thenticity the National Socialist movement as of June 30, 1933, the "Night of the Long Knives." Heidegger's admission, however, can be interpreted in either of two ways: either the brutality of the Rbhm- purge was the event that finally enlightened him about the base real- ities of National Socialism; or else the destruction of the SA signaled the defeat of National Socialism in its radical, heroic strain to him. The fact that in 1935 Heidegger could still counterpose the "inner truth and greatness of the National Socialist movement" to the "works that are being peddled about nowadays as the philosophy of National So- cialism,"18 suggests that he himself continued to distinguish (as he would in the Spiegel interview some thirty years later) between the movement's original historical potential and its later bastardization, which subsequently accounted for Heidegger's own withdrawal of ac- tive support. Yet even if Heidegger's political sympathies indeed lay with the Rohm faction, the case for Heidegger as a hard-core SA ad- herent is one for which Farias has failed to provide adequate proof. A final illustration of the manner in which Farias undermines the credibility of his own argument (and one almost unanimously cited by his opponents) involves the monk Abraham a Sancta Clara (1644-1709), a native son of Heidegger's own Messkirch. A prolific writer who gained 16. "Heidegger at Eighty," reprinted in Heidegger and Modem Philsosophy, ed. M. Murray (New Haven: Yale UP, 1978) 293-303. 17. See note 5. above. 18.

It so happens that the first published writing of the young Heidegger in 1910 was composed on the occasion of a monument erected in honor of this local hero. Farias devotes an entire chapter (39-55) to this otherwise uninteresting bit of Heidegger-juvenalia. That Heidegger has no special words of praise for Abraham's anti-Semitism is to Farias a matter of indifference. How- ever, Farias pursues the tenuous connection between these two sons of Messkirch relentlessly, ending his book with a discussion of a 1964 speech delivered by Heidegger at Messkirch once again in honor of the prelate. In his speech, Heidegger quotes an observation by Abraham that "Our peace is as far from war as Sachsenhausen from Frankfurt" (Farias, 293). Of course, by invoking Sachsenhausen, Abraham is refer- ring to the district of Frankfurt. But Farias cannot let pass the opportu- nity for some ruminations on the workings of Heidegger's uncon- scious, by linking the Frankfurt quarter with the concentration camp of the same name outside of Berlin. Farias's amateur Freudianism sug- gests that Sachsenhausen is a metonymic trope for Auschwitz, the logi- cal historical outgrowth of Abraham's anti-Semitic mentality; and thus, that Heidegger's statement is a merely a sinister instance of parapraxis. But such feeble efforts at lay analysis fall short of producing the re- sounding indictment Farias has been seeking for some 300 pages. Finally, the Farias book is extremely weak from a philosophical standpoint. This would not be a damnable failing if the author had been content to stick primarily with biographical themes. But instead, he chooses to indict not only Heidegger the man - who, following the researches by Ott, has become an easy target - but also Heidegger the thinker. At this level of analysis, the questions at issue become de- cidedly more complex, and Farias lacks the intellectual wherewithal to broach these matters with the requisite degree of prudence and so- phistication. Because Heidegger as a man may have been rotten to the core does not mean one can, mutatis mutandis, make the same argu- ment about his philosophy. If the canon of great works were to be de- cided on the ad hominem grounds of the ethical character of the au- thors, we would conceivably left with little to read. On occasion, Farias will draw loose parallels between Heidegger's work and his politics, but these insights for the most part have the status of unsystematic af- terthoughts. Yet, when the stakes are so high, off-handed remarks will</page><page sequence="12">146 The French Heidegger Debate not do. Farias leaves us with the impression that there is a necessary link between Heidegger's thought and his Nazism; and that as a result, Heideggerianism as a philosophical enterprise is essentially flawed or invalid. While the relationship between thought and politics in Heid- egger's case may well turn out to be of paramount importance, Farias has not shown us what this linkage consists of, or the reason why it may be fatal to the Heideggerian project. The conclusions are sug- gested instead by insinuation and innuendo. Within days of its appearance in October 1987, Farias's book was the subject of full page essays in both Le Monde (by Roger Pol-Droit, October 14) and Liberation (Robert Maggiori, October 16). Both articles sent shock-waves throughout Parisian intellectual circles. The Liberation article seemed especially damning, and its full-page headline - "Heil Heideg- ger!" in two-inch, bold-face type - seemed to set the tone for the debate in its early stages. The conclusions drawn in both essays were strikingly similar. "How will we ever be able to read Heidegger/Dr. Jekyll again without surreptitiously thinking of Heidegger/Mr. Hyde?" inquires Droit. "It falls due to all those who are professional philosophers, and not for fun but out of concern for truth, to "think Heidegger" along with that which the inquiry of Farias has revealed," urges Maggiori. There followed the predictable attempts at "damage control" on the part of the Heideggerian faithful.'9 But at this point, the Farias revela- tions proved too extensive to refute. Several respondents - including Jacques Derrida in an interview published in Le Nouvel Observateur - attempted to downplay the importance of Farias's findings by claiming their essentials had been known for a long time.20 But this strategy of argumentation all but side-steps the truly provocative nature of Farias's contribution: even if many of the individual episodes had been known to Heidegger specialists, little of the evidence was publicly avail- able, especially in the non-German-speaking world. Hence, Farias's study was the first both to render the disturbing truths about Heideg- ger's hidden past accessible to public scrutiny and to attempt to account 19. See, for example, the epistolary responses to the original essay of October 14 in the October 30 issue of Le Monde. 20. For example, see the following remarks by Derrida: "As for the essentials of these 'facts,' I have found nothing in this inquiry that was not already known for quite some time by those who were seriously interested in Heidegger." The Derrida interview may be found in the November 6-12 issue of Nouvel Observateur. As a result of an unfortunate editorial decision, it was omitted from the "foreign edition" of this issue of Nouvel Observateur, and hence is unavailable in many North American libraries.</page><page sequence="13">Richard Wolin 147 for their systematic interconnection. In this respect, though his execu- tion may have been flawed, he has unquestionably opened up impor- tant new perspectives on the issues in question. To gainsay his work as "non-original" is simply to argue in bad faith. (Moreover, if knowledge of these "facts" was as widespread as Derrida et al. claim, then why were they not made available to the public at an earlier date? Were these troubling facts suppressed?). For certain French Heideggerians, the Farias book will forever be viewed as a small-minded and rancorous assault on a great philosophi- cal legacy.2' Or as Heidegger himself was fond of saying: "When they can't attack the philosophy, they attack the philosopher." The philoso- pher and Heidegger-translator Pierre Aubenque asks plaintively: What is the ethical status, as far as our traditional judgments about inquisition and censure are concerned, of a book that openly pres- ents itself as an enterprise of denunciation, and especially the de- nunciation of a thinker, above all, when this denunciation is in a large measure calumnious? FranCois Fedier attempts to explain the hue and cry over Heidegger's Nazi ties psychologically, as an instance of "ressentiment": it is reduci- ble to "the rage of mediocrities against Heidegger - I've seen it at work my entire life."22 Henri Cr'tella contends that there can be no in- tegral relation between Heidegger's thought and Nazism, since the lat- ter was predicated "on a refusal to think." He then seeks to turn the ta- bles on Farias by claiming that "there are two ways to declare a taboo on thinking: a vociferous, frenzied way, and another, gently anesthe- tizing way." Whereas the former mentality, which Cretella identifies as the "historical meaning" of Nazism, has been vainquished, the sec- ond, which is the "essential meaning" of Nazism, survives in inquiries such as that of Victor Farias.23 On the other hand, many commentators have been genuinely dis- turbed by the recent facts which have come to light about Heidegger's 21.

A common theme among those who have chosen to acknowledge the gravity of Farias's revelations re- lates to the philosopher's obstinate refusal to utter the barest word of contrition about his Nazi past or about the Holocaust in general.24 As Maurice Blanchot observes: Each time that he was asked to recognize his 'error,' he main- tained a rigid silence, or said something that aggravated the situa- tion. .... it is in Heidegger's silence about the Exterminations that his irreparable error lies. (Blanchot goes on to cite Heidegger's arrogant remark to the effect that Hitler had failed him by reneging on the original radical potential of National Socialism.)25 In a similar vein, the philosopher Emmanuel Levinas observes: Does not this silence, even in peace-time, about the gas chambers and the death camps - something beyond the realm of all 'bad excuses' - attest to a soul that is in its depths impervious to com- passion [sensibilite], is it not a tacit approval of the horrifying.26 Even Heidegger's most talented and original disciple, Hans-Georg Gadamer has freely admitted that in his political engagement, "Heidegger was not a pure and simple opportunist" - rather, "he 'believed' in Hitler."27 Equally fascinating have been a series of related discoveries which have surfaced as unintended outgrowths of the main debate itself. The most momentous of these "spillover" disclosures concerns the man who for 35 years was France's most stalwart Heidegger advocate, Jean 24. Paul Celan, in his poem "Todtnauberg," tells the story of his pilgrimage to the philosopher's Schwarzwald mountain ski hut, and of his disappointment over Heidegger's refusal to utter a single word upon being asked about the Holocaust. A similar tale has been recounted by the theologian Rudolph Bultmann, who upon sug- gesting after the war that Heidegger publicly recant his Nazi past, received only a cold, silent stare in return (cf., the article by Robert Maggiori in Liberation, 16 October 1987.) 25.

Beaufret, a Heidegger translator, intimate, and interlocutor - as well as a former Resistance-fighter - who published several vol- umes of his "Conversations with Heidegger" before his death in 1982, is perhaps best known to the English-speaking world as the addressee of Heidegger's important "Letter on Humanism" - a 50-page rejoinder to a series of questions posed by Beaufret in 1946 on the relationship between fundamental ontology and humanism. (Heidegger's response is also a pointed rebuttal of Jean-Paul Sartre's defense of the humanist tra- dition in "Existentialism is a Humanism"). Whenever questions had been raised in years past concerning Heidegger's unsavory political alle- giances, Beaufret had always been in the forefront of his defenders; and his credentials as an ex-member of the Resistance seemed to lend an aura of unimpeachable sanctity to his pro-Heideggerian proclamations. After all, when a Resistance-figure defends an alleged Nazi, his motives must certainly be beyond reproach. But not in this case. As it turns out, Beaufret seems to have had a hidden agenda: he was a covert supporter of Robert Faurisson, the French historian who denies the existence of the gas-chambers specifi- cally and the Holocaust in general.28 In two letters dated November 22, 1978 and January 18, 1979 (recently made available in the journal that has been chiefly responsible for disseminaing Faurisson's views, Annales d'histoire revisioniste), Beaufret expresses adamant support for Faurisson's "project" and sympathizes with him about the criticism he received from the press. At one point Beaufret observes: "I believe that for my part I have traveled approximately the same path as you and have been considered suspect for having expressed the same doubts [concerning the existence of the gas-chambers]. Fortunately for me, this was done orally."29 That the major French Heidegger interpreter of the post-war era was a closet-supporter of Faurisson's thesis con- cerning the non-existence of the Nazi death-camps casts serious doubts (to say the least) about his "objectivity" as an intrepid Heideg- ger champion. Another disturbing circumstance that has recently come to light 28. Faurisson's argument is largely based on the fact that he has personally never met a Jew who actually saw the gas-chambers. That Jews who did see the inside of the chambers were asphyxiated within three to four minutes might go far toward explain- ing the peculiar lack of eye-witness accounts Faurisson has encountered. (In any event, Faurisson discounts a priori allJewish testimony concerning the Holocaust as biased). 29.

Fischer was one of the principal architects of the Na- tional Socialist racial theory, and thus in essence laid the intellectual groundwork for the "Final Solution." Born in 1874, Fischer established his credentials in 1913 with a book on the "problem of the bastardization of the human species." This work drew important lessons from Ger- man colonial racial legislation in Southwest Africa, where, as of 1908, marriages between Europeans and natives were forbidden, and those that had already been contracted were declared null. However, the true solution to the problem of miscegenation envisioned by Fischer is the "disappearance" of those of mixed race through a sinister "process of natural selection." Fischer was active in the early years of Nazi rule, helping to promul- gate legislation aimed at "protection against the propagation of genetic abnormalities," on the basis of which over 60,000 forced sterilizations were performed in 1934 alone. His institute in Berlin was also the in- spiration behind the Nuremberg racial laws of 1935, forbidding inter- marriage (as well as sexual contact of any sort) between Jews and non- Jews. A leading theorist of eugenics and a forceful proponent of "a bi- ological politics of population," Fischer has been described as "one of the linchpins of the execution of the bureaucratic and ideological methods that facilitated [Nazi] genocide." Joseph Mengele was a "researcher" at Fischer's Institute. Relations between Heidegger and Fischer were loose, but none the less interesting for that reason. Both hailed from the same region in Baden. Both participated in a Leipzig congress in November 1933 to promote the cause of "German science." The two remained in contact for the duration of Heidegger's rectorship. And it may have been in no small measure due to Fischer's influence that the racial measures pro- moted by Heidegger during his tenure as rector (chronicled by Farias) - a questionnaire on racial origin distributed to all professors; an ob- ligatory lecture for all instructors on the importance of racial purity; the establishment of a "department of race" run by the SS at the Uni- versity - followed a model set forth by his fellow Schwarzw~i1der. In 1944, at the age of 55, Heidegger was drafted into the Volksturm, a reserve unit comprised of older German men. This was not uncommon for men his age during the war's later stages. Only a personal telegram sent to the Gauleiter of Salzburg spared Heidegger from service. The</page><page sequence="17">Richard Wolin 151 sender of the telegram was none other than Eugen Fischer. It read: "With all due respect for the imperatives of the hour and those of the Volksturm ... I am in favor of freeing from armed service Heidegger, an exceptional and irreplaceable thinker for the nation and the Party."30 That ties between the two remained cordial over the years is sug- gested by the fact that in 1960, Heidegger sent Fischer a copy of his book Hebel, der Hausfreund with the inscription, "For Eugen Fischer, with warm Christmas greetings and best wishes for the New Year" (Farias 79). It would certainly be unfair to judge Heidegger by the company he kept, no matter how sinister. Yet, the Heidegger-Fischer episode is of interest insofar as it suggests that, because of his ties with Fischer, the philosopher may well have been aware of the Nazi preparations for genocide (as well as other crimes) at a relatively early date - some- thing his supporters have always denied. Two of the leading French Heideggerians, Jacques Derrida and Phi- lippe Lacoue-Labarthe, have been in the forefront of the philosophical debate about the direction of Heideggerianism in the aftermath of the Farias controversy. Unlike the base Heidegger-apologists (Fedier, Aub- enque, Cretella), who have seized on the purportedly tendentious nature of Farias's study to avoid confronting the disturbing facts of the case in hopes of fostering a return to "business as usual" in the French Heidegger industry, Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida have been willing to confront these diabolical biographical themes head on (Derrida, for ex- ample, speaks of Heidegger's "terrifying silence" about the past in the February 9, 1988 issue of Le Monde). Their intention, however, (the methodological validity of which can hardly be denied) is to allow the vultures to feed on Heidegger the contingent, empirical individual (what is an author, anyway?), while saving the philosophical oeuvre itself - es- pecially Heidegger's work following "Die Kehre" (the "Turning"), at which point - so the argument runs - Heidegger freed himself from the vestigial anthropocentrism that is still so prominent in Being and Time. Ironically, both Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida published book-length 30. See Michel Tibon-Cornillot, "Heidegger et le chainon manquant," Liberation 17 February 17 1988: 41-42, for a comprehensive treatment of the relations between Heidegger and Fischer. In a follow-up letter the next day, Fischer would write: "The faculty defends [Heidegger] as a spiritual Fiuhrer and a thinker....We really do not have many great philosophers, let alone National Socialist philosophers." The fact that the papers of both Heidegger and Fischer are closed to public viewing represents a signifi- cant obstacle to a more detailed investigation of their relations.</page><page sequence="18">152 The French Heidegger Debate "responses" to Farias well before his manuscript ever appeared. They are respectively entitled La fiction du politique and Heidegger et la question (both appeared in 1987).31 Both Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida had heard tell of the troubling revelations from the other side of the Rhine (Ott's work being the major source) and decided to stake out a position on the philosophical implications of these findings in advance of the storm that would soon be unleashed. Since these two books con- tain the major prises de position on the question of Heidegger and poli- tics by the two leading representatives of Heideggerianism working in France today, they are worth discussing at some length. La fiction du politique is simultaneously an unflinching arraignment of Heidegger's Nazism and a bold endorsement of (post-"Kehre") Heideg- gerian orthodoxy. Unlike the tiresome apologists who would give any- thing to go back to "life before Farias," Lacoue-Labarthe pulls no punches when addressing the fatal interrelation between philosophy and politics that led to Heidegger's 1933 "enlistment." His approach is characterized by a refreshing willingness to weigh the continuities between Heidegger's early philosophical writings and his National So- cialist convictions in the early 1930s. His assertion that "contrary to what has been said here and there, Heidegger's engagement is abso- lutely coherent with his thought" (22, emphasis added), apparently leaves little room for equivocation. But what Lacoue-Labarthe gives with one hand, he takes away - cleverly - with the other: the insight just quoted pertains only to the pre-1935 Heidegger. The post-1935 Heideg- ger emerges virtually unscathed. Lacoue-Labarthe's argument, which parallels Derrida's in its essen- tials, proceeds as follows. The problem with the early Heidegger is that he suffers from a surfeit of metaphysical thinking. Even though he has gone to great lengths to distance himself from the tradition of Western metaphysics in Being and Time and other early works, insisting that this tradition must be subjected to the purifying powers of Destruktion, the break proves in the end to be insufficiently rigorous. Metaphysical resi- dues abound, most notably, in the Dasein-centered paradigm of Being and Time, where, when all is said and done, a human subject, albeit, a non-Cartesian, existentially-rooted subject, once again provides privi- leged access to ontological questions. Thus, in the last analysis, Being 31. Derrida has recently published yet another book on Heidegger, Psyche: Inven- tions de de l'autre (Paris: 1987).</page><page sequence="19">Richard Wolin 153 and Time, despite the profound insight with which the book opens (the question concerning "the Being of beings"), simply relapses into conventional onto-theological modes of thought; its anthropomorphic Ansatz is really little more than a warmed-over version of traditional metaphysical humanism. Now that Nietzsche's insight concerning the death of God has been acknowledged, the topographical locus of the metaphysical arche has merely shifted: a transcendent dwelling-place has merely been exchanged for an immanent one, and Dasein, in its "decisive resolve toward authentic Being-for-Self," has become the new focal point of metaphysical inquiry. The fact that the second vol- ume of Being and Time was never written can thus be explained by the fact that Heidegger, circa 1935, came to view the entire existential framework of his 1927 work as essentially flawed; i.e., as perilously be- holden to the paradigm of metaphysical humanism he had been at such pains to counteract. What, however, do such ethereal philosophical questions have to do with Heidegger's attachments to the base realities of Nazi politics? Everything in the world, according to Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida. Through a brilliant piece of hermeneutical chicanery, they intentional- ly seek (unlike the blatant apologists) to link-up the philosophy of the early Heidegger with his pro-Nazi phase in order to save him the bet- ter: the early Heidegger, whose thought is in any case overly saturated with superfluous metaphysical residues,32 can be safely jettisoned so that the post-humanist Heidegger, the Heidegger of the Nietzsche lec- tures and the "Letter on Humanism," can be redeemed unscathed. By an ingenious interpretive coup de maitre, the troubling "question" of Heidegger and politics can be neatly brushed aside, since the post- 1935 Heidegger abandoned the philosophical paradigm that led to his partisanship for Hitlerism in the first place. The defense proffered by Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida is certainly not without it merits. It therefore behooves us to examine it in a bit more detail before passing judgment on its worth. Above all, I would like to focus on what is perhaps the linchpin of the argument: the counter-intuitive claim that it was an excess of metaphysical thinking that led to Heidegger's Nazism. It is of interest to note the extent to which this reading of Heidegger conforms verbatim with the philoso- pher's own interpretation of his intellectual/political trajectory. It is a 32. Cf. Derrida's essay, "The Ends of Man," in Margins ofPhilsosophy (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1982).</page><page sequence="20">154 The French Heidegger Debate strikingly orthodox reading of Heidegger. The Lacoue-Labarthe/Derrida interpretation is of a piece with Heidegger's re-evaluation of his own philosophy in his Nietzsche lec- tures of 1936-39. Previously, Heidegger had accepted Nietzsche's work as Nietzsche had understood himself: as a great subverter of metaphy- sical humanist nostrums and a critic of that "nihilism" to which tradi- tional Western values inevitably led. It was fundamentally the debacle of Heidegger's Nazi experience that led him to reconceptualize his previous, uncritical relationship to Nietzsche. Just as Heidegger understood Nietzsche's efforts toward a "transvaluation of all values" as a philosophical answer to nihilism, he had greeted the National So- cialist Revolution as a political antidote to nihilism. In viewing the Nazi movement through a Nietzschean frame of reference, Heidegger endowed it with all the attributes of a salutory, world-historical chal- lenge to Western nihilism and to the "decadent" values that are its nec- essary historical accompaniment: liberalism, individualism, philoso- phical subjectivism, mass society, techni, value-relativism, etc.. In short, he perceived it as the panacea for the aporias of modernity allusively prophesied by Nietzsche's Zarathustra. The Nazi's were the heroic "new pagans" who would save the West from a seemingly irre- versible process of Spenglerian decline. In fact, Heidegger maintained this perspective until the end of his life. It was neither an accident nor an oversight that he never "re- nounced" the National Socialist experiment. Instead, if one examines "The Rectorship: 1933-34," the 1976 Spiegel interview, as well as An In- troduction to Metaphysics, it is clear that Heidegger continued throughout his life to distinguish between "the debased historical actuality" of Na- zism as against its "true historical potential." He originally developed this distinction in the last-named work where, as we have previously noted, he took pains to differentiate between "the inner truth and greatness of the National Socialist movement" and the inauthentic "works that are being peddled nowadays as the philosophy of National Socialism." He defines the former in terms of "the encounter between global technology and modern man;" i.e., the "inner truth and great- ness" of Nazism is to be found in its nature as a world historical alterna- tive to the technological-scientific nihilism bemoaned by Nietzsche and Spengler. What is shocking about the claim that "the inner truth and greatness of the movement [lies in] the encounter between global tech- nology and modern man" is that the second half of this sentence was</page><page sequence="21">Richard Wolin 155 added parenthetically to the text of the 1953 re-edition of these 1935 lectures. Thus, not only did Heidegger refuse to omit the original dis- tinction between the "historical" and "essential" forms of Nazism in the later edition, he re-emphasized the value of this distinction eight- een years later by adding a clarification (concerning the "encounter be- tween global technology and modern man") through which he sought to re-enforce the original distinction itself. His dogmatic non-repentance is further illustrated by his long- standing conviction that the National Socialist movement (and he per- sonally) had been "betrayed" by the Fiihrer himself. In Heidegger's view, it was Hitler who, owing to a failure of nerve, ultimately aban- doned the original "anti-nihilistic" thrust of the movement (which, again in Heidegger's view, was its raison d'etre) by curbing its more radical tendencies. Thus, according to the writer Ernst Jiinger, Heid- egger claimed after the war that Hitler would be resurrected and exon- erate Heidegger, since he (Hitler) was guilty of having misled him.33 It follows logically from this reasoning that Heidegger never made a pro- fession of guilt concerning his role in the "German catastrophe," since in the last analysis, the fault lay with the National Socialist movement itself, which had failed to live up to its true historical potential, rather than with him. This whole "strategy of denial" on Heidegger's part is fully consistent with the rather exalted mission he assigned to the Na- tional Socialist Fiihrer-Staat in his Rektoratsrede of 1933, where he de- picted it as a bellicose re-invention of the Greek polis. Since the Na- tional Socialist state failed to live up to the metaphysical goals Heidegger had set for it, it was the Nazis, not Heidegger, who were ul- timately at fault.34 To return to the Lacoue-Labarthe/Derrida contention that it was a "surplus of metaphysical thinking" which accounted for Heidegger's National Socialist leanings: on this argument, in the late 1930s, Heidegger finally came around to realizing that Nietzsche, instead of having delivered a death-blow to Western metaphysics, was in truth the last metaphysician. The post-Cartesian version of metaphysics largely consisted of an exaltation of human will and Nietzsche's thought, for all its criticisms of philosophical humanism, was ultimately of a piece with this tradition, since its central category, "the will to power," is likewise a glorification of will. It is precisely such an exaltation of "will" 33. Cited in Der Spiegel 18 August 1986: 167. 34. See the remarks by Jean-Michel Palmier cited in Der Spiegel 18 August 1986.</page><page sequence="22">156 The French Heidegger Debate that is, according to Heidegger, at the root of Western techne and the triumph of modern technology. This celebration of will is at the very heart of the modem cultural project of "human self-assertion" (Blumen- berg). Hence, National Socialism, which originally presented itself (in Heidegger's eyes) as a counter-movement to the nihilism of the Western "will to techni," and thus as a world-historical alternative to the "nihil- ism" so reviled by Nietzsche, in the end proved to be only a different historical manifestation of that same nihilism, in the same way that Nietzsche's strident critique of metaphysics itself ultimately rests on metaphysical foundations. The equation according to which Heidegger proceeds, therefore, is: National Socialism = Nietzscheanism = meta- physics. If it was an infatuation with Nietzsche (more specifically, with the latter's critique of nihilism) that led to Heidegger's embrace of Na- tional Socialism, then it was ultimately Western metaphysics that was at fault, since this was the intellectual framework which stood behind Nietzsche's thought. Heidegger had been misled and duped (first by Nietzsche, then by the Nazis), but he was not "responsible for," let alone "guilty of' any misdeeds. An similar interpretive "strategy of containment" is pursued by Derrida in De l'esprit. Derrida, unlike Lacoue-Labarthe, believes that he can succeed in partially getting the early Heidegger off the hook. The sticking point is the key-word in Derrida's title, "l'esprit" (or "Geist"). Derrida argues that the frequent positive allusions to "spirit" in the political speeches of 1933 indicate a sharp departure from Being and Time, where this category is systematically criticized. For a "metaphysics of spirit" was a Hegelian trope, a tell-tale metaphysical residuum that Heidegger the philosopher had long-since renounced. Therefore, the utilization of this outmoded philosophical rhetoric was by definition discontinuous with the philosophy of Being and Time, despite the fact that the latter remained partially beholden to prejudicial Cartesian nostrums (above all, in treating Dasein as the arche through which the "question of Being" could be unlocked). As Derrida himself explains the rationale behind his "spirited" defense of Heidegger: One must preserve the "possibilities of rupture" in a "variegated Heideggerian thought that will remain for a long time provocative, enigmatic, worth reading." In his rectoral address, Heidegger takes up again the word 'spirit,' which he had pre- viously avoided, he dispenses with the inverted commas with</page><page sequence="23">Richard Wolin 15 7 which he had surrounded it. He thus limits the movement of deconstruction that he had previously engaged in. He gives a vol- untaristic and metaphysical speech [whose terms] he would later treat with suspicion. To the extent that [Heidegger's discourse] cel- ebrates the freedom of spirit, its exaltation [of spirit] resembles other European discourses (spiritualist, religious, humanist) that in general are opposed to Nazism. [This is] a complex and unsta- ble skein that I try to unravel [in De l'esprit] by recognizing the threads in common between Nazism and anti-Nazism, the law of resemblance, the fatality of perversion. The mirror-effects are at times vertiginous.35 The far-fetched and illogical conclusion we are left to draw from the line of argument pursued by both Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida is that it was a surfeit of humanism (later abandoned) that drove Heidegger into the Nazi camp! But in the end, this interpretive tack amounts only to a more sophisticated strategy of denial. The entire specificity of the relationship between Heidegger's philosophy and National Socialism is theorized away, once the distinction between "humanism" and "anti-humanism" is so readily blurred. The "Volk" for which Heidegger became the spokesman in 1933 is an eminently particularistic entity, unlike the category of "mankind" with which one associates traditional humanism. In addition, any trace of personal or German national responsibility is conveniently effaced once the tri- umph of National Socialism is attributed to a nebulous, impersonal force such as "planetary technology," "metaphysical thinking," "nihil- ism," or the "will to will."36 Since Nazism proves in the last analysis to be merely a particular outgrowth of the rise "planetary technology," which itself is a mere "symptom" of the "forgetting of Being" which has victimized the history of the West since Plato, the historical specificity of the Hider years becomes, in the overall scheme of things, a minor episode. From this perspective, it would be presumptuous of Martin Heidegger, the lowly "shepherd of Being," to assume culpa- bility for a metaphysical process (the forgetting of Being) for which he can hardly be held responsible.

He's the one, after all, who, by distinguishing between the forms and the sensibles, kicked offthe entire onto-theological mud- dle in the first place. In fact, Heidegger deserves our ceaseless praise for attempting to reverse this odious process, albeit, within the limits of "Gelassenheit" or "releasement" (which substitutes for the overly "voluntaristic" category of "Entschlossenheit" in the later Heidegger), ac- cording to which matters can only be made worse if men and women assert their "wills" to try to change things. As Heidegger confesses inthe Spiegel interview (in a line that theologians have ever-since cited with glee), at this point in history, the domination of "will," "meta- physics," and "techne" has gone so far that "Only a god can save us!" That the "anti-humanist" philosophical framework of the later Heidegger can hardly be deemed the unqualified advance Lacoue- Labarthe and Derrida would have it, is indicated by a telling remark made by Heidegger in 1949 (well after his alleged Kehre): "Agriculture today is a motorized food industry, in essence the same as the manu- facture of corpses in gas chambers and extermination camps, the same as the blockade and starvation of countries, the same as the manufac- ture of atomic bombs.""37 This cynical avowal - by the man who has staked a claim to being the leading philosopher of our time - is by no means an unrigorous aside, but pertains to the very crux of Heid- egger's later philosophy as a critique of "techne." That the Freiburg sage can simply equate "the manufacture of corpses in gas chambers and extermination camps" with "mechanized agriculture" is not only a shockingly insensitive affront to the memory of the victims of the Nazi death camps - whose extermination in the remark just cited is treated as in essence no different from the production of higher-yield crops. It is not only a gruesome equation of incomparables. It serves once more to deny the specifically German responsibility for these crimes by attributing them to the dominance of an abstract, superven- ing, world-historical process. It suggests, moreover, that other Western (as well as non-Western) nations who engage in mechanized food pro- duction, "blockades," and the manufacture of nuclear weapons, are in essence no different than the SS lieutenants who herded Jews into the gas chambers. It illustrates an extreme myopia concerning the various uses to which technology can be put in the modern world, an incapacity 37.

It is in sum a simplistic demonization of technology. That the later Heid- egger's philosophy is to such a great extent predicated on a demon- ization of"technique" as exemplified by the 1949 observation just cited suggests a glaring flaw in his theoretical framework. Heidegger is a philosopher who is not at home in the modern world. Thus, it comes as little surprise that, when pressed by his interlocutors during the course of the Spiegel interview for a tidbit of philosophical wisdom about a possible solution to the dilemmas of the modern age, Heidegger can only answer emphatically in the negative: whatever the solution may be, "it is not democracy;" instead, "only a God can save us." His devaluation of the modern project of human autonomy is so extreme that he will only admit to a deus ex machina solution - in the most literal sense of the term. The powers of human intelligence and volition are so thoroughly downplayed, the modern ideal of self-fash- ioning subjectivity is so far devalued, that all we are left with is an ap- peal to myth that is abstract, irrational, and sadly impotent. It would be easy to attempt to dismiss the French Heidegger debate and its possible long-term intellectual ramifications on a variety of cir- cumstantial grounds: The entire affair was either an invention of the French media (this is Lyotard's strategy in a new, hastily conceived work, Heidegger et Les Juifs [Editions Galilee, 1988]). Or, given a pro- longed lull in French intellectual life - attributable to a natural-satia- tion with endless and aimless "deconstructions," which speak only to fellow deconstructors and seemingly lead to few positive or lasting achievements, a mood already detectable in French intellectual life in the early 1980s - the Heidegger debate provided some much needed (if artificial) stimulation in a period of almost stifling intellectual nor- malcy. Certainly, such conjunctural factors cannot be dismissed out of hand.38 While the long range effects of the Heidegger-Farias controversy will undoubtedly take several years to emerge, its most immediate practical consequence will likely be a prolonged period of intellectual flux, with the French Heideggerians placed on the defensive and no competing in- tellectual paradigms sufficiently mature to fill the (quasi) void.

But such familiar themes seem unlikely to capture the imagination of a new intellectual generation. In any event, virtually everyone, including the deconstructionists,4 already agrees with the fundamental political implications of their thought, a naive celebration of les droits de l'homme.41 Though there are many who wish that the uproar over a lamentable chapter in Heidegger's life would simply go away, the continuing in- terest in the controversy is unlikely to abate in the foreseeable future: as this essay goes to press, a recent issue of Le Monde lists four new or forthcoming books on the question of "Heidegger and politics,"42 in addition to four journal issues devoted to this theme. Nor does recent testimony seem to be buttressing the cause of the French Heideggerian faithful: especially damaging have been the recently published memoirs of Leopoldine Weizmann, a former student of Heidegger in the early 1930s who now resides in France.43 Her account once again raises the distressing question - long thought to have been settled in the philos- opher's favor - of Heidegger's anti-Semitism. Weizmann confirms a rumor that had been explicitly denied by Heidegger in the 1976 Spiegel interview, namely, that following the Nazi seizure of power, Heidegger refused Husserl access to the philosophy department library in Freiburg because he was a Jew.44 Moreover, he is alleged to have dashed the hopes of one of his own highly regarded Jewish doctoral 39.

Recently, Ferry and Renaut have published their own contribution to the Heidegger controversy: Heidegger et les modernes (Paris: B. Grasset, 1988), a lengthy ef- fort bent on demonstrating the inner connections between Heidegger's philosophy and politics, focusing specifically - and in polemical opposition to Derrida - on the disastrous intellectual and practical consequences of Heidegger's "anti-humanism." 42. Among those most deserving of attention is Pierre Bourdieu's L'ontologie politique de Martin Heidegger (Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1988), which was originally writ- ten in 1975. Bourdieu's book, an exemplary study in the sociology of knowledge, con- stitutes an impressive effort to situate Heidegger's thought in terms of the conservative-revolutionary mentalitye (Spengler, Jiinger, Schmitt, etc.) dominant in Germany during the inter-war period. 43.

The title of a May 1985 Die Zeit article accu- rately captures the mood of the current debate: "Heidegger, die Nazis, und kein Ende."45 45. By W. Hochkeppel in the issue of May 6, 1985. The repercussions of the French debate are just beginning to be felt in Germany. For an excellent volume which probes the possible philosophical bases of Heidegger's Nazism, see Heidegger und die praktische Philosphie, eds. A. Gethmann-Siefert and 0. Poggeler (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1988). The essays by P6ggeler, Franzen, Schwann, and C.F. Gethmann are especially noteworthy. The American attempt to reevaluate the Heideggerian legacy "after-Farias" has received an auspicious beginning with the comprehensive docu- mentation compiled by Thomas Sheehan in theJune 16, 1988 issue of The New York Re- view of Books ("Heidegger and the Nazis," 38-47). I can only emphatically second Sheehan's intelligent concluding remarks that "one would do well to read nothing of Heidegger's anymore without raising political questions. ... one must re-read his works - particularly but not exclusively those from 1933 on - with strict attention to the political movement with which Heidegger himself chose to link his ideas. To do less than that is, I believe, finally not to understand him at all" (47). Sheehan's conclu- sions may be read as a strident indictment of the French apologists, who would prefer to go on as if the researches of Farias and Ott never existed, naively pretending (as Richard Rorty has recently done in The New Republic ["Taking Philosophy Seriously" 11 April 1988) - in stark disregard for all the evidence that has been amassed to the con- trary - that there was no intrinsic connection between Heidegger's philosophical views and his political actions. This is not to suggest, however, that the hermeneutical task of sorting out the precise nature of those linkages will be an easy one.
