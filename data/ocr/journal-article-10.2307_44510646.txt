<plain_text><page sequence="1">Old English colour classification : where do matters stand? NIGEL F. BARLEY Various attempts have been made by Anglo-Saxonists to deal with the Old English colour vocabulary but the subject remains far from clear. In the present article I shall try to show some of the reasons why this is so and offer a re-interpretation of the Old English colour words as a system , treating the Anglo-Saxons simply as a standard ethnographic corpus of anthropological data and therefore amenable to the techniques applied to those present-day communities that are the concern of the anthropologist. The phenomenon of colour vision involves many fields of study, including physics, psychology and physiology. Anthropologists have long been concerned with colour classification as just one of the cognitive systems that mediate the social perception of reality.1 Such colour systems have become the standard example of the Complete relativist' approach to world views.2 Recently, however, this line has been questioned, specifically with reference to colour systems,3 and certain universal colour categories have been pro- posed. The involvement of so many disparate sciences and philosophical dogmas goes a long way to explaining the controversy that still surrounds this topic. Several points are, however, generally accepted and must be briefly reviewed before we consider the specifically Anglo-Saxon features of colour classification. For the ideali2ed standard colour receptor, the colour perceived depends on three variables - hue, saturation and brightness. Hue can be expressed in terms of the wavelength of the light, saturation in terms of the purity of hue, and brightness in terms of the amount of light transmitted. It is thus clear that hue is a qualitative dimension concerned with what sort of light is perceived, while saturation and brightness are quantitative , being concerned with the amount of light reaching the eye. This information is traditionally represented visually by means of the colour solid (see fig. 2). Since, however, this three-way opposition can be resolved into a simple binary one between 1 E.

This gives us a much more practical diagram (see fig. 3). Our own Modern English colour classification is firmly biased towards the differentiation of hues, so much so in fact that we even term extremely light surfaces ' white * and extremely dark surfaces 'black* and treat them as hues. The primacy of hues is shown, moreover, by the fact that we reserve the noun category for their designation and use 'pale* and 'dark* as qualifiers to express the brightness dimension. Hue names are thus the fixed points on which we hang our whole colour system. 16</page><page sequence="3">Old English colour classification Once we appreciate how lopsided and idiosyncratic is our own colour system, we shall not be surprised to find that the Anglo-Saxon approach to colour was quite different and that attempts to treat the latter as a hue- stressing system have resulted in a rare confusion. The main stress of the Old English system falls firstly, not upon hue, but upon brightness. This is far from a new insight and has been remarked upon by nineteenth-century writers1 and more recently by Lerner.2 For some reason, however, modern Anglo-Saxonists have not recognized the fundamental nature of the light- dark opposition in Anglo-Saxon culture. Nineteenth-century scholars were much more sensitive to the paradigmatic structural implications3 of this opposition and their insights have been neglected to the great detriment of the subject. Mead4 remarks that Old English poetry is a literature of light and dark, white and black. Even one whose interests are principally anthro- pological cannot but be struck by the fact that Beowulf is a poem of bright day and darkest night, light ale-hall and gloomy wasteland. That this has a symbolic load is evident. Let it be noted also that black is far and away the most common ' colour ' in Old English poetry. It finds expression in a rich vocabulary: blaec, deorcy dun , swear ty wann etc. Opposed to black we have the second most common 'colour' term, white, and here again we have a striking profusion of terms: blacy hwity beorbty leohty scir etc. It is thus apparent that there is an equation of brightness and whiteness, darkness and blackness, or, more accurately, an absence of the distinction that follows from our own hue-stressing system. Gummere5 argues that in 'Common Germanic' times, light and dark were associated with joy and sadness only - the extension to good and evil being the result of eastern influence via Christianity. We now know much more about such patterns of thought in primitive society and would be much less willing to accept this line of argument. However this may be (and Gummere's evidence is far from conclusive), by that part of the Anglo-Saxon period for which we have documentary evidence this association is firmly established. Christ and the angels are always scir , beorht etc., hell and the devils are always sweart , wann and so on. One of the neatest examples of this comes in the poem Daniel (448), as pointed out by Gummere: the Jews have just been saved from the flames - the dazzling fire having been described - but the angel who rescues them is 'se ļ?e hie of ]?am mirce generede' ('he who saved 1 W.

The contrast between light and dark is extended to cosmic proportions in the opposition between heaven and hell and reduced to anthropomorphic proportions in the opposition between joy and sadness. It is thus not without significance that glœd means both c joyful' and 'bright'. This binary opposition, then, serves as a basic structuring device ordering the fields of experience and ethics. We can sum it up diagramatically in terms of the light-dark axis (see fig. 4). The fact that the Anglo-Saxon colour system was not hue-stressing does not, of course, mean that hues were not distinguished. Let us now consider the hue axis. It is perhaps most easily compared with that of Modern English if presented in tabular form after the manner of Ardener1 (see fig. 5). Although excluded from the 'basic colour vocabulary', words indicating overlapping categories are of interest in any attempt to recreate the Old English system. Thus terms such as baewen-grene and brun-baso are valuable for the corroboration they can offer the ordering that we set up. More particularly, a glance at fig. 5 is sufficient to show how simple is the solution to that most perennial of old disputes in Anglo-Saxon - the use of read to describe gold. Recourse is often had to highly ingenious and learned explana- tions urging that gold in medieval times had a relatively high copper content and that it was consequently redder than modern gold. We are told that the adjective was used only for the alliteration or because it had become a set phrase. As elsewhere, such explanations lack an anthropological perspective and so fail to realize that Old English 'red' is not our red and that we cannot blandly equate the two categories. Even the new universalist approach to colour systems2 assumes that there will be substantial variation from culture to culture in the position of boundaries. That the solution to the 'red gold' problem lies in the lack of fit between two sets of categories and not in differences in the 'reality' described is clear from the use of 'red' cognates in other Germanic languages, such as ON raud mani , '"red" moon'. The basic material on the Anglo-Saxon use of colour words is contained 1 E.

It is a sad fact that many Anglo-Saxonists tend to study their people not as thinking members of a social community but as generators of scribal errors and manuscript traditions. Lerner is a rare exception.3 He takes a most promising line, denouncing previous approaches as bound by the classificatory prejudices and preconceptions of their authors. He suggests a fresh approach from an anthropological perspective to the vexed colour terms we have not yet treated, fealo, wann and brim. These words have long earned their Anglo-Saxon users much opprobrium. They are held to be vague, imprecise and - even by Lerner - € unscientific'. He suggests that 1 'Color in Old English Poetry*. 2 J. Willms, 'Der Gebrauch der Farbenbezeichnungen in der Poesie Altenglands', Inaugural Dissertation (Münster i. W., 1902). Since this article was completed, I have come across G. König, 'Die Bezeichnungen für Farbe, Glanz und Helligkeit im Altenglischen ', D.Phil, thesis (Mainz, 1957). This offers by far the most comprehensive and accessible collection of data on the subject so far available. Dr König is very much concerned with collocation restrictions and makes many useful points, partly in agreement with my own views. We differ chiefly in the treatment of the ' problem words ' (see below), where Dr König's atomistic approach is opposed to any attempt to set up wider correspondences between members of lexical sub-sets. It is my contention that only through the reconstruction of such sub-systems can we ever arrive at an understanding of the processes at work and at an appreciation of the logical consistency of the Old English colour system. 3 'Colour Words'. *9</page><page sequence="6">Nigel F. Barley they can be dealt with only by a third axis of 'brightness'. His use of this term seems itself somewhat vague, since he already has a light-dark axis in his model. Furthermore he seems to be thinking in terms of a scale of absolute, not relative, 'brightness', since he remarks that this quality 'being largely the product of circumstances, the word would apply to objects only in certain circumstances'. In view of what colour specialists have to say on adjustative mechanisms1 in colour perception this seems inherently unlikely. Lerner has made the mistake of not sorting out his basic colour terms from more elaborated sub-systems. It is unfortunate, moreover, that he has brought the data together only from the poetry, as this is exacdy where we should expect most deliberate flouting of the normal collocation restrictions and use of paradigmatic associations.2 The descriptions of 'brown' waves, 'wan' clouds and 'fallow' flames are a priori just as likely to be intended to achieve that shifting of normal apperception that constitutes part of the poetic experience as they are to serve the interests of accurate depiction. Thus, when we find the expression ' harrte stan ' (The Rain 43a), 'hoar (grey with age) stone ', it is important to know whether bar normally had an animate application (as is implied by the Bosworth and Toller Supplement, especially the substan- tivized meaning of Beowulf 2988a). In a poem on the transience of earthly things, the poignancy of this word could well be due to such paradigmatic associations. I shall be returning to this problem later.3 1 E.g. R. Evans, An Introduction to Color (New York, 1948). 2 See Ardener, Social Anthropology , esp. p. lxxvii. 3 If we wish to regard bar as limited to contexts marked 'animate', there is a problem in the BT Suppl. entry IIa, ' the word occurs often as epithet of stones and trees used as boundary markers '. The other uses, however, can be safely dismissed as late or consciously poetical. For example, 'of clife harum' in The Metres of Boetbius (5113a) is not in the prose version, and we would have to be extremely careful if we drew any conclusions from use in the riddles, since, as I show elsewhere (N. Barley, 'Structural Aspects of the Anglo-Saxon Riddle', Semiotica 10 (1974), 143-75), riddles manipulate just such restrictions to deceive or help the solver. Are we, then, to regard the use of bar with stones and trees as an example of a word already partly freed of collocation restrictions, pointing the way for the other colour terms in their drift towards more general applicability ? To adopt this view, it would be necessary to show that such occurrences are relatively late or colloquial. This may, indeed, be the case. The limitation of this phenomenon to boundary symbols suggests, however, another explanation and immediately warns the anthropologist that he is in danger of being misled. Boundary symbols, perhaps more than anything else, are likely to hold a special place in a people's world view. Modern works on classifications and taboos have noted the power of lines of demarcation; see, e.g., M. Douglas, Purity and Danger (London, 1966), and A. Van Gennep, Les Rites de Passage (Paris, 1909; trans, into English, London, i960). Elsewhere ('Anglo-Saxon Magico-Medicine', Jnl of the Anthropo- logical S oc. of Oxford 3 (1972), 67-77) * have shown that the Anglo-Saxon magico-medical system is based largely upon the manipulation and reaffirmation of boundaries. We see further concern with such matters in the concept of the outlaw, cast outside the social world and symbolically identified with the wolf. It is doubtless no coincidence that the charters that con- tain the bar stan phenomenon also indicate the presence of ' wolfshcad-trees' on the liminal areas between properties. (An interestingly late case is of a dispute between the abbots of St Albans and Westminster in 1437, recorded in the Annales Monasterii S . Albani. The latter abbot com- plained that the former had destroyed a gallows erected by immemorial custom in a place called 20</page><page sequence="7">Old English colour classification There is every reason to think that the three 'problem words', fealoy brun and wann, can be understood only when reintegrated into the sub-systems of classification of which they form a part. They then become of fundamental importance as part of the study of diachronic category shifts within the Germanic speech community. As far as the essential nature of these words is concerned, it should serve as a warning that there is no Old English word that can be regularly translated as 'colour'. There are several words, such as fœrpu , htw and bleo, that can be translated 'colour', but often a better rendering is 'appearance'.1 The Anglo-Saxons had neither colour charts nor a large range of dyes.2 For them, colours were attributes of objects and had not reached the level of abstraction that they have in our own society. There is good reason to believe that many colour words originate as com- parisons with concrete referents.3 Thus the word for 'red' will often be derived from a term meaning something like 'blood-coloured'. Gradually such words may detach themselves from this original referent, become etymologically obscure and take on a separate lexical existence. Some of them may even reach the basic colour vocabulary.* Hence we may expect to find words bound, to a greater or lesser degree, to concrete referents.5 Also I should like to emphasÍ2e that in adducing historical information I am by no means unaware of the distinction between the diachronic and syn- chronic planes. In the absence of informants, however, the Anglo-Saxonist of anthropological bent must fall back on secondary sources, including philological evidence from related dialects. If we look at fealo in its full Germanic context, it is clear that it formed part of a lexical sub-set originally restricted to horses. The existence of such a sub-set should not surprise us. An extensive cattle vocabulary amongst the Nuer has been well studied.6 Modern English still contains such a group, e.g. bay, roan, palamino etc. It seems that those areas in which there is greatest interest in developing a system for communicating fine distinctions Nomannesland in order to destroy his boundary marker.) Worship of such plants and trees is attested in the laws (II Cnut 5,1). This complex problem cannot be fully treated here, but per- haps enough has been said to show that this usage of bar may be explicable only by reference to other systems of belief that would remove certain stones and trees from the 'non-animal' cate- gory. Once more we see the impossibility of dealing with all colour words on a single level. 1 See A. Cameron, 'The Old English Nouns of Colour: a Semantic Study', unpub. B.Litt. thesis (Oxford, 1968). I am grateful to Dr Bruce Mitchell of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, for bringing this thesis to my attention. For a note on fserfu, see O.

Evans- Pritchard, The Nuer (Oxford, 1940). 21</page><page sequence="8">Nigel F. Barley will tend to evolve a specialized vocabulary.1 1 suggest that horses constituted such a field for the Germanic peoples. The extension of words from a favoured field into more general use is well attested historically and psycho- logically.2 For the anthropologist it is yet another example of that universal human tendency to caique one system of classification on another. Gmc *falwa -3 occurs as ON fçlr, OS falu , OHG falo and OE fea lo. It is used in Old Norse of the human complexion and is used of human hair and gold only in the Old High German glosses. By far the clearest cross-dialectal use is of the horse: (i) There is the Old Norse form quoted by de Vries,4 fçlski , 'rotes Pferd' (bay horse). (2) There are upper German, Rhenish Franconian forms such as falch, 'bay horse or cow'. (3) There is evidence of a continuing struggle between generalization and specialization of sense in Old High German and Middle High German cognates. Two forms from val and valwer finally parted company, ceasing to be in free variation, and Modern German falb has retained its purely equine reference. (4) There is preserved a document of Byzantine origin, Corpus Hippiatricorum Graecorum that correlates the colours and temperaments of horses. For once history has been kind to us. Whereas we hitherto had no evidence for a Gothic *fahva - cognate, this source proves that there was indeed one. The word, moreover, seems to have been applied specifically to horses and was pre- sumably introduced by Gothic troops in the employment of the Empire.5 The relevant Greek term is paXßas, which Schwyzer derives from the Gothic weak substantive form *fahva-. As elsewhere, the narrow meaning of the substantivized form is further evidence that the word was firmly bound to an equine context. None of this evidence is conclusive if taken piecemeal, but if considered as a whole it amounts to quite a strong case for assigning *falwa- to a lexical sub-set of horse words.6 That such a horse set did indeed exist can be easily demonstrated : Gmc *blanka- occurs as ON blakkr , OS blanc, OHG blanch and OE blanca . 1 A good study of such a specialized sub-system is C. Frake, ' The Diagnosis of Disease among the Subanum of Mindanao', Amer. Anthropologist 63 (1961), 113-32. 2 S. Ullmann, The Principles of Semantics (Oxford, 1959). 3 For what follows I draw heavily on the evidence in E. Schwentner, ' Eine sprachgeschichtliche Untersuchung über den Gebrauch und die Bedeutung der altgermanischen Farbenbezeich- nungen ', Inaugural Dissertation (Göttingen, 191 5), to which the reader is referred for more detail. This pioneering work brings together much of the available data on comparative Ger- manic colour studies. It is quite clear that Schwentner realized the existence of collocation restrictions on Germanic colour words but the absence of a structuralist approach prevented him from seeing these as anything but an arbitrary series of disjointed irregularities. 4 J. de Vries, Altnordisches etymologisches Wörterbuch (Leiden, 1961). s E. Schwyzer, 'Germanisches und ungedeutetes in byzantinischen Pferdenamen , ZDA 66 (1929), 93-9- 6 Unfortunately it would be misleading to use the evidence of Vulgar Latin forms as these are relatively late and the dangers of reciprocal borrowing and mutual influence are too great. 22</page><page sequence="9">Old English colour classification In all dialects it is used almost exclusively of horses, in Old High German as an adjective, in Old English and Old Norse as a noun. The postulated Germanic meaning is '*shining white (horse)'. It occurs as ßXayxa-s in the Corpus Hippiatricorum from Gothic *blagka -. Gmc * blasa- occurs as ON hlese ^ OS bias and ModE blasse. It refers in all dialects to a horse with a white patch on its forehead. In the Corpus Hippiatri- corum it appears as ßdXas. Gmc *dunna- occurs as OS dun (etymologically related are OS dosa and OHG tusin from which are derived MedLat do sinus and dosius 1 and OE dunn. All forms are firmly associated with horses, with some application to other animals. Gmc *grawa- occurs as ON grar, OS grao, OHG grao, OFris gre and OE graeg. Cross-dialectally it is restricted mainly to (i) human hair and animal fur and (2) iron. In the animal category it is applied chiefly to horses and wolves. It occurs in the Corpus Hippiatricorum as y piß as and is found again in Modern Greek with the meaning 'grey horse 'ģ It is my contention that Gmc *falwa- was part of this group of colour words, limited originally to horses. Gmc *bruna- occurs as OS, OFris and OE brun. It is common of animals, especially horses. Its other chief use is of metal. Structurally, then, its closest relation is Gmc *gran&gt;a-. Unlike *grawa -, however, it is not clearly recorded as applied to human hair. It occurs only rarely of the human complexion. Two factors argue against its inclusion in the horse words: it does not occur in the Corpus Hippiatricorum and it seems etymologically connected with Gmc *beron , 'bear'. But neither is conclusive. The absence of the word is not necessarily significant, while the use of the word with reference to the bear might be an early example of that extension of the term to all animals that we observe in the case of *grawa-. I would therefore include it in the horse words.2 If, as I have argued, fealo and brun were originally part of the horse set, how far was this still true in the Anglo-Saxon period ? This, of course, is difficult to answer. I have pointed to the problem caused by the fact that the majority of our material is from the poetic corpus. We are really asking how 1 E. Schwentner, 'Eine altgermanische Farbenbezeichnung Beiträge %ur Geschichte der deutseben Sprache und 'Literatur 49 (1925), 423-9. 2 This raises the question of other colour sub-groups in Common Germanic times. I believe we can detect another group in *erpay *blunda- and *baira-. Gmc. *erpa- occurs as ON jarpr , OHG erpf and OE earp. It remains fully active only in Old Norse, where it is almost totally restricted to human hair. Gmc. *blunda- is a vexed term that has, however, been traditionally accepted as a Germanic word borrowed early into Latin and referring to the hair of the typical Germanic warrior (see Ploss, 'Die Färberei '). Gmc. *baira- occurs as ON barrt OHG her and OE bar. It is applied to human hair and animal fur. Although the evidence for these terms is less con- vincing than that for the horse words, it is at least enough to suggest that Common Germanic contained a group of colour words limited to human hair. 23</page><page sequence="10">Nigel F. Farley far a word could be 'normally' applied to the waves etc. and how far such usage constituted a deliberate circumvention of standard collocation restric- tions. We are more likely to be able to give a clear answer to this problem if we relate these words to the third member of their set in Anglo-Saxon times. I should therefore like now to consider wann. This is a word without an obvious history and was apparently an Anglo- Saxon creation. We may, therefore, discount the possibility of its forming part of any Common Germanic colour sub-set. If it were a new formation, it would be reasonable to expect it to conform to the colour system at the time of its creation and to shed light on the underlying rationale of that system. In Old English it is homonymous with wan - expressing deprivation or negation. It is used of such things as the raven, dark waves and dark chain-mail. In other words, it is applied to things negatively specified for hue, dark things which arc glossy to the point of having highlights rippling across their surface. It is this quality of variegated surface-reflectivity, that takes in the whole external appearance, that Lerner was groping for under the term 'brightness Wann is a word of complex sense impression including information that we would not include under 'colour' at all. Turning to fealo , we find that the things to which it is applied have the same basic quality. It is applied to horses, glinting shield edges, the waves of the sea, flame etc. If we accept this view, the old bone of contention, the fealwe strœte of Beowulf 916b, ceases to trouble us, as the reference is to the gravel glinting or (see below) to the parched grass. The objects to which brun is applied - helmets, swords, waves, feathers - also have the same compo- nent. Dal1 has suggested that in brun we have two words that have coalesced. There seems no need to postulate this. The word has always had two com- ponents, one hue, the other surface reflectivity. Medieval French courtly verse took over only the latter sense, rediffiised it to the other countries of Europe and so made possible those references to 'brown' mirrors and diamonds that occur in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuriesē Given the presence of such marked formal patterns, I suggest that OE fealo , brun and wann, and also grœg, are terms generally applicable to glossy things. In other words the original horse terms have been extended and generalized to fit the restrictions on wann. Adapting the approach of Katz and Fodor,2 we can encode this as two changes in the semantic markers of the terms concerned: (1) (Colour) - (Animate) - (Non-human) - (Horse) -&gt; (Colour) - (Animate). (2) (Colour) - (Animate) -&gt; (Colour) - (Glossy). 1 I. Dal, 'German, brun als Epitheton von Waffen', Norsk Tidskrijt for Sprogvtdmskap 9 (1938), 219-30. * J. Katz and J. Fodor, 'The Structure of a Semantic Theory , Language 39 (1963), 170-210. 24</page><page sequence="11">Old English colour classification The attraction of this presentation is that it enables us to establish a sequence of transformations. Its chief disadvantage is that it fails to deal adequately with relations between elements in a sub-set.1 For example the above des- cription does not account for the frequent use of the term fealo to describe plant-life, where it is applied to brown leaves, dying vegetation. This is to be explained by the fact that fealo has entered here into opposition with grene. Fealo means the fallow land as opposed to the green fields, the winter aspect as opposed to the summer.2 It is to be expected that any Old English poet worth his salt would exploit these paradigmatic associations. Hence the frequent occurrence of 'fallow waves ' in the more elegiac parts of the poetic corpus that has so often been explained as merely 'there for the alliteration'. Another group of words collocationally distinct in the Old English period is what I would term the ' baso group'. Baso was apparently an Old English coinage. It is glossed purpureusy phoenicus, coccineusy i.e. 'crimson/purple'. It should be deleted from the basic colour vocabulary on the grounds that it is a secondary formation from basoy 'berry'. Ploss3 tells us that a favourite dye of the Germanic peoples was produced by crushing blackberries. The broad range of colour covered by this term thus represents a specialized dye-term. It is significant that it is only Old English, regularly applied only to fabrics and occurs as a substantive, meaning 'purple cloth'. Similar is OE n&gt;aedeny meaning 'purple/blue'. It is regularly applied only to fabrics, and, being etymologically related to woad, refers to dye from that plant. The various reflexes of Gmc * salwa- in the different dialects all have the dominant referent human clothing. Although applied to animals and birds in Old English, even here we find signs of collocation restrictions. A regular feature of its use is its combination with -pada-. Thus we have 'saluwigpadan, )&gt;one sweartan hraefn' ( The Battle of Brunanburh 61) and 'earn... / salowigpada' ( Judith 2IO-I ia). This compound, meaning something like 'sallow-coated', avoids violation of the limitation to clothing. I therefore suggest that the ' baso group' is a specialized sub-set limited to fabrics, dyes and clothing. 1 This is why it has to be supplemented by an approach that is structural in the sense of A. Grei- mas, Sémantique Structurale (Paris, 1966). One does not, however, have to adopt as extreme a view of the differences between these two models as does E. Coseriu, 'Zur Vorgeschichte der strukturellen Semantik: Heyses Analyse des Wortfeldes "Schall"', in To Honor Roman Jakobson (Paris, 1967), esp. p. 493 n. Symbolic systems being of a multi-level order, we must expect to find nesting. 2 For a further example of this see H. Conklin, 'Hanunoo Color Categories', Southwestern Jnl of Anthropology 11 (1964), 339-44. We should note a similar phenomenon in Modern English whereby wine is either 'red* or 'white* regardless of the fact that its actual colour may be purple, green or yellow. 3 ' Die Färberei ' 25</page><page sequence="12">Nigel F. Barley In fig. 6 I attempt to formalize, albeit tentatively, the collocation restric- tions on some of the principal Old English words.1 In fig. 7 I attempt to locate the 'problem words' on the hue axis and on the light-dark axis. We have come far since our first consideration of the Old English colour system, but this has at least made clear the grave danger of carrying our prejudices into a consideration of their categories. The Anglo-Saxon approach to colour was far different from our own biaxial, hue-stressing system. It was concerned chiefly with the differentiation of light and dark. It contained many words of specialized sub-sets that were collocationally restricted. It also had words of complex sense impression that were specified not only for hue but also for light and dark and general surface quality. If I have regretted that scholars have restricted themselves to the poetic use of colour words, this is not to plead merely for a full statistical treatment of the whole Old English corpus. One hopes that the current Old English dictionary project of Cameron and Ball will look at just this sort of problem. At the end of such a laborious undertaking, we should know a lot more about actual usage but would not be necessarily any the wiser concerning the underlying system. We shall have to weigh each occurrence in the light of a system, allowing for random historical omissions, deliberately 'poetic' usage and so on. Cameron2 argues specifically against such a generative approach, seeking to limit analyses to listing recorded occurrences. This is to condemn the subject to a false, stultifying sterility. It would be as pointless as to seek to describe the English language by a list of recorded utterances. It would, moreover, make it impossible to treat caiques of one symbolic system on another, such as we have mentioned with reference to the light-dark axis in Anglo- Saxon society. It is, therefore, not surprising that Cameron's own treatment of bleo and hiw is excellently structural and so, inevitably, tacitly a generative model without arrows. The collocation restrictions I have proposed for certain key Old English words are only tentative. They represent only a programme for research. A full investigation would include those colour words that I have not treated and investigate structural relationships between groups at all levels. Thus the study of the evolution of the colour system through time will 1 Lest it should be thought that collocationally restricted sub-systems are unusual, let us note that Modern English again offers a parallel - besides the horse words already mentioned - in its (female) hair sub-set: blonde, brunette, auburn etc. The similarity of this to the Gmc *crpa- group is striking. It should be observed that the Anglo-Saxons were primarily concerned with the light-dark opposition even here, giving the system: fair = English = beautiful = freeborn, opposed to dark = Celtic = ugly = slave. In this way we can build up a picture of the way in which the Anglo-Saxons calqued a number of cognitive systems on a single axis of the colour system. I have suggested elsewhere ('Anglo-Saxon Magico-Medicine') that the hue axis may be used as a frame on which to hang a classificatory system of disease. 2 'The Old English Nouns of Colour', introduction, passim. 26</page><page sequence="13">Old English colour classification Other Human Human Word Horses animals Birds Metal Fabrics hair skin Water Plants Stone fealo PG OE OE OE ME OE OE blanca PG OE OE mori- mori- bund bund dunn PG OE OE OE grzg PG OE baseP PG PG ?

This is not an attempt to tabulate every occurrence of these terms but seeks to outline the underlying system. PG = positively specified in Primitive Germanic; OE = positively specified in Old English; ME = positively specified in Middle English. Unless it is otherwise stated, positions tenable in Primitive Germanic remain so in Old English a The whole subject of OE grzg remains to be investigated. It seems to be the case, however, that where birds are concerned baso is the collocationally appropriate word. b The question of the various restrictions on OE words for 'black' has not been adequately investigated. Mead, ' Color in Old English Poetry has several suggestive remarks that would reward further study. Meanwhile sweart seems to be the collocationally appropriate word for horses. f baso j' bri tuba so ^ ^ read ^ ^ ' » ' bruii fealo 'gtolo } s J fbrunwaim I • / ¿rene T* • I ļ wann bziveu^ » x I N' 1 bwit grzg blzc fig. 7 Location of the 'problem words' on the hue axis and on the light-dark axis 27</page><page sequence="14">Nigel F. Farley become another part of the semiotic science that concerns itself with the processes by which all sorts of systems of classification are shattered, reinterpreted and restructured by a sort of popular etymological gloss.1 1 C. Lévi-Strauss, Ltf Pensée Sauvage { Paris, 1962). Proof in such matters is impossible, but it seems not unlikely that the breaking down of collocation restrictions in the Old English period was connected with the great enrichment of material culture experienced by the Anglo-Saxons, firstly as a result of their invasion of these Romanized islands and secondly through their con- tacts with Mediterranean Christianity. M. Mauss (The Gift (London, 1954)) made the point that the fewer material possessions a people have the greater is the symbolic load carried by each. The converse also applies. 28</page></plain_text>
