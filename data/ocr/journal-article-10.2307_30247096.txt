<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICRO-ECCENTRICS FROM THE FOUR CORNERS REGION OF THE SOUTHWEST JOHN W. GREER ABSTRACT Sixteen differing examples of a notched stone flake artifact type, termed a micro-eccentric, are described from the Southwest. The archaeological associations, and geographical and temporal distribu- tions of the specimens are summarized. Their function and cultural relationships are considered. My attention has recently been directed to a type of artifact very rarely reported from the Southwest. For convenience I have termed these specimens micro-eccentrics. As with most newly recognized artifact types, questions about recurrent forms, geo- graphical and temporal ranges, associated cultural materials, and possible uses need to be answered. Information has been gathered to answer these questions, and the sample, which finally totaled 16 specimens, enlarged. Ten of these are in the personal collection of A. H. Warren at the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe, three are in the collections of the Museum of New Mexico, and three are in the collections at Mesa Verde National Park. These micro-eccentrics are all very thin, notched flakes of a high-grade petrified wood, chalcedony, agate or obsidian (Fig. 1). Although the specific characteristics of the specimens are quite variable, most of them seem to be non-utilitarian (at least from their shapes), and contain many narrow notches, sometimes resembling deep serrations. The working of these specimens is often restricted to the immediate area of the notches so that most of one, or both faces may be free of secondary flake scars. The shape generally seems to be somewhat circular, but may be amorphous just as often. Three specimens are crescent-shaped, but have at least one notched edge. Two other small specimens without notches are grouped with these artifacts, as they were intentionally shaped into apparently non-functional outline, and seem to be of about the same age. The area of distribution of these specimens centers in the Gallup-Zufii-Lupton region south of the Four Corners, although there are specimens from Mesa Verde National Park, from south of Shiprock, and from near Nambe Pueblo, north of Santa Fe.

Numbers 1-9, 13 from the collection of A. H. Warren; Numbers 10-12 from the collections of the Museum of New Mexico; Numbers 14-16 from the Mesa Verde National Park Museum collections. temporal placement appears to be rather consistently within the Basketmaker III or Pueblo I periods, although most specimens are from surface collections making absolute dating uncertain. Number 1. A small specimen of pinkish-orange chalcedony in the Warren collection from the Teapot Site, four miles north of Lupton, Arizona. The specimen is oval in outline and has one deep notch at each end. Each lateral 252</page><page sequence="3">edge bears four shallow notches. It is 14 mm. long and 10 mm. wide. Also found at this site are pottery types probably attributable to Basketmaker III or Pueblo I (White Mound Black-on-white, Red Mesa Black-on-white, La Plata Black-on-white, Lino Gray and Woodruff Red). Number 2. This thin flake of very fine, translucent, orange chalcedony or petrified wood is also from the Teapot Site, but was found on a different hill than Number 1. This eccentric is circular with two deep, opposing notches and three additional notches on each edge. The eight paired notches form a symmetrical outline. This specimen is 15 mm. long and 14 mm. wide. It too probably dates to Basketmaker III-Pueblo I. Number 3. A small flake of reddish-brown jasper or non-translucent chert which was found on a hill about 200 yards north of Number 2 at the Teapot Site. It is a circular flake, 14 mm. in diameter, that bears 12 evenly spaced notches. Pottery types indicate a date within Basketmaker III-Pueblo I. Number 4. Specimens Number 4 and Number 5 are from the Cave Spring Site about one mile south of Lupton. The age of this site is unknown. Number 4 is a crescent-shaped artifact of fine-grained, blackish-brown petrified wood. The inside curve is nearly smooth, while the outside curve is serrated with eight small notches, the deepest of which is at the center. This specimen is 19 mm. long and 12 mm. wide. Number 5. This flake, also of fine-grained, blackish-brown petrified wood, was found on the same hill as Number 4. It is also crescent-shaped, and resembles an asymmetrical, highly serrated, unstemmed projectile point. The inside curve has four even serrations, the outside curve has five, and the base has three. The distal end is quite sharp and pointed. It is 25 mm. long and 10 mm. wide. Number 6. A small specimen of light, creamy tan chalcedony found on the surface of the southwestern slope of the White Mound ruins about eight miles northwest of Lupton. This flake is almost shaped like a stylized butterfly. It has one deep, wide notch on each end and a similar notch on each side, thus dividing the long, narrow trapezoid symmetrically into four parts or lobes. The lateral edges of the two largest lobes, those forming the base of the trapezoid, are finely serrated, each with four notches. At the corner of each lobe is a notch larger than the serrations, but smaller than the deep lateral notches. Excavations at White Mound indicated that the site was occupied from Basketmaker III times until early Pueblo I (A.D. 801), according to the tree-ring studies. The dominant pottery types were White Mound Black-on- white, Kiatuthlana Black-on-white, Kana-a Black-on-white, Tusayan Black-on- red, Abajo Red-on-orange, Lino Black-on-gray, Lino Gray, San Francisco Red, Alma Plain, polished redware and neck-banded grayware (Kana-a Gray) (Gladwin 1945:20). Number 7. This small flake of very fine-grained, dark brown petrified wood is from the Pottery Cliffs Site, approximately two miles northwest of Zufii The specimen was recovered, along with a heavy flint perforator (about 65 mm. long), a rectangular-stemmed, shouldered dart point and small Olivella shall beads (spire-lopped), from a burial which was eroding. Number 7 is slightly larger than most of the other specimens (24 mm. long, 24 mm. wide), and bears eight evenly spaced notches. A field examination of the pottery at the site suggests chronological placement in Basketmaker III-Pueblo I. A few sherds of a blackware with polished interior and exterior were reported from the site. Number 8. This small specimen of orange petrified wood was found on a hill at the White Cliff Site about seven miles northeast of Gallup, and one quarter mile west of the north fork of the Puerco River. It is the only specimen in the series that suggests an anthropomorphic figure. The neck is fairly long, but 253</page><page sequence="4">there is no enlargement for the head. The arms are short and flare out horizontally. The legs (one is broken) are straight and flare out slightly. The appearance is that of a "stick man" such as young children draw today. It is 25 mm. long and 16 mm. wide. Surface sherds at the site suggest a date of Basketmaker III-Pueblo I. Number 9. This specimen is also from the White Cliff Site, and was found on the same hill as Number 8 about 50 yards away from it. It is a circular flake of petrified wood, divided into three parts by three fairly deep and broad notches. The edges between these notches are very finely serrated, causing them to appear roughened rather than notched. The artifact is 19 mm. long and 16 mm. wide. A Basketmaker III or Pueblo I date is suggested from field observation of surface sherds. Number 10. This notched flake was found in a trench outside of Structure 2 at LA 4289 during excavations in the Navajo Reservoir district (field specimen number 4289-2-42). Eddy (1961:73, Fig. 56) describes the artifact as follows: "A small, serrated, oval flake. Complete bifacial chipping produced a symmetrical object with thin edges and a proportionately thicker body. The edges are deeply notched, giving a toothed effect. A pair of the deepest notches are on opposite sides, dividing the oval into symmetrical halves. Eight additional, shallower notches are distributed equally in opposing sets along the sides. May have been used as a pendant. Size: length, 0.7 inches; width, 0.4 inches; thickness, 0.1 inch." Number 11. This is a small, oval flake, broken at each end and unevenly notched along both lateral edges. Each lateral edge has five notches. This thin, fragmentary specimen of chalcedony is 25 mm. long and 16 mm. wide. It was found on the surface of site LA 8487 (field specimen number 8487-0-4) just south of Shiprock, New Mexico, during survey work by the Museum of New Mexico in 1964. Stewart Peckham (personal communication) reports that this site probably dates to about A.D. 500 to A.D. 700 (Basketmaker III), with some Archaic materials also in the assemblage. Peckham states, very understandably, that he would place this specimen in a "flake saw" category. Number 12. This small, triangular flake (field specimen number 7599-0-2) of chalcedony was found on the surface of site LA 7599, just south of Shiprock (survey report by Peckham and Wilson in preparation). The two serrated edges, each with four notches, join to form a point.. This thin, fragmentary artifact is 16 mm. long and 11 mm. wide. Peckham (personal communication) reports that this site was occupied from Pueblo I until early Pueblo II times. Number 13. This specimen of bluish, translucent obsidian is the only one yet known from the north-central section of New Mexico. It is from site LA 68 on the south bank of the Rio Tesuque about two miles east of Nambe Pueblo. Although a few areas of the site contain concentrations of Pueblo II (Kwahee Black-on-white, Borrego Black-on-white, and related mineral paint types) and Pueblo III (Santa Fe Black-on-white and related carbon paint types) pottery, most of the site is covered with fine stone work (largely corner- and side-notched projectile points) and older pottery types (Lino Gray and other crudely smoothed plainwares), which probably represent Basketmaker III-Pueblo I. This eccentric was found in a small area containing only Basketmaker pottery. The flake is 11 mm. long and 17 mm. wide, and is in the shape of a stylized bird. From one face, the head is to the left and is set off by notches. The long, narrow tail is to the right, and the back is serrated with four notches of varying depth. The legs are formed by an expanding section, the bottom of which has been bifurcated by a fairly deep notch. Three specimens from the area of Mesa Verde National Park were reported to me in 1964 by Jean M. Pinkley, Park Archaeologist 254</page><page sequence="5">(personal communication). These are described here from drawings. Number 14. This specimen of dark orange jasper was collected in the vicinity of the Yellow Jacket Ruin in the Montezuma Valley northwest of Cortez, Colorado. Pueblo II and Pueblo III sherds are represented on the site (the pottery ranges from Mancos Black-on-white through McElmo to Mesa Verde Black-on-white with many other types present, including Chaco Black-on- white). This cruciform-shaped artifact is 29 mm. in diameter. Each of the four slightly expanding arms of the cross bears three fairly deep, irregular notches. Number 15. This eccentric flint was picked up on the mesa top just east of Square Tower House on Chapin Mesa. It was a surface find with no associated pottery types. It is crudely crescent-shaped with a smooth inner curve and a deeply notched exterior edge (11 notches). It is approximately 25 mm. long and 12 mm. wide at the center. The material is white quartz. Number 16. This specimen is of unknown provenience. It was collected before there was a museum at the park, and no data were with the flint when cataloging was first instituted. Orienting the specimen with its short axis vertical, the shape is very much like a bird. It is much larger than the other artifact of similar shape, Number 13, and measures approximately 23 mm. long and 25 mm. wide. The specimen is somewhat rectangular in outline with deep notches at intervals to set off a rounded, triangular head. The feet are represented by a rectangular portion with a slightly concave base. One wing has a convex tip, and the other has two notches at its end. The specimen is very irregular, and is of a yellowish-white siltstone (?). Although eccentrics have been reported from other areas, I do not believe that they are related to the Southwestern specimens. They are generally much larger and thicker, and have much larger notches. These eccentrics have been found in Mayan assemblages from the Guatemalan highlands (Kidder 1947; Coe 1959), Archaic assemblages from central (Jackson 1937) and eastern Texas (Johnson 1962: Fig. 12), and Southern Cult sites in the southeastern United States (Moorehead 1932: 162, Fig. 103). Crescents of various forms have long been known in the Southwest from California (Tadlock 1966) to Texas and northern Mexico, but these also probably have no bearing on the small, notched flakes described here. Cruciforms from the western Texas and Chihuahua region have also received considerable attention. SUMMARY The shapes of the artifacts are quite variable. The distribution appears to be concentrated in the area of Gallup, Zufii and Lupton, with additional specimens from the Mesa Verde region. One specimen was found just north of Santa Fe near Nambe Pueblo. Searches through the archaeological literature failed to turn up any other specimens in this area. Dates for the 255</page><page sequence="6">micro-eccentrics seem to concentrate in the Basketmaker III- Pueblo I periods, ca. A.D. 500 to A.D. 900. A function for the artifacts is not suggested by the archaeological associations, although they possibly may have been used as a sort of clothing or body decoration. The occurrence of Number 7 in a burial with other ceremonial (?) objects might suggest a special use or significance. Because of the rather limited geographical and temporal range in the Four Corners region, I feel that there is a basis for suggesting a connection or diffusion of ideas between the peoples who made these small artifacts. Perhaps these eccentrics may be used as supplementary horizon markers for late Basketmaker III or early Pueblo I times for the area centered slightly west of Gallup or Zufi.
