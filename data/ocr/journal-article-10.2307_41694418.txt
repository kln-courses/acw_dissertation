<plain_text><page sequence="1">IDENTIFICATION OF THE RGVEDIC IMAGES OF INDRA* By Krishna Kumar The Ochre-Coloured Pottery (OCP) represents one of the earliest protohistoric cultures in Indo-Pak subcontinent.1 The discovery of Copper Hoard objects at a number of OCP sites in the GangS valley has fairly shown that the Copper Hoards and the OCP are the integral parts of one and the same protohistoric culture that flourished during the 2nd millennium B. C. in Northern India. Of the numerous Copper Hoard objects reported from different sites in Northern India, the so-called copper / bronze anthro- pomorphs are perhaps the most distinctive and enegmatic ones. Although many ingenious explanations about their function or utility have been offered by the eminent scholars in the past, their correct identification is perhaps still eluding us. In this paper an attempt has been made to offer a new identi- fication of the copper / bronze anthropomorphs on the basis of certain iconographie and literary evidence.9 Although a number of copper anthropomorphs have been discovered at different sites in Northern India ( -See Map- ), only 14 examples are well- known to the scholarly world. The remaining anthropomorphs are still unpublished. The well-known examples hail from Kiratpur, Bisauli ( Figure 1 ), Chandausi, Fatehgarh, Saipai and Sheorajpur ( Figures 2 &amp; 3 ), in Uttar Pradesh; Ambala in Haryana; and Lothal in Gujrat. A bronze anthro- pomorph has also been discovered at Kolabarti in Bihar ( Figure 4 ). The unpublished copper anthropomorphs are said to have been discovered at Bankot, Haldwani, Nurpur, Kannauj, Kanpur, etc. in Uttar Pradesh. All published and unpublished copper / bronze anthropomorphs are preserved in different museums and private collections in India and abroad. * This paper was originally presented in a briefer form at the 19th Annual Conference of the Indian Archaeological Society held at Sagar ( M. P. ) in December 1987. It was entitled : " The Copper Anthropomorphs : A New Identification ". 1 Krishna Kumar, " The Origin and Expansion of the Ochre Coloured Pottery : An Assessment ".

While the type-A coppcr antbropomorphs bear no sex- mark ( Figures 1, 2, &amp; 3 ), the solitary type-B bronze figure from Kolabarti in Bihar displays a phallus too ( Figure 4 ). The distributional pattern of the type-A copper anthropomorphs reveals that excepting the fragmentary exam- ples ; one each from Ambala3 and Lothal,4 they are confined in the Upper Gañgü valley, which was the centre of the late Rgvedic Aryan culture in Northern India. The type-A copper anthropomorphs have been variously indentified as a religious symbol or image,6 an all purpose tool,6 a figure in shape of a man,7 a missile or boomrang,8 a primitive object of magic or cult signi« ficance,9 a proto-type of the àrïvatsa- symbol,10 a precursor of the ritualistic thunder-bolt,11 a vajra used as a harpoon,12 an object of worship," a personi- fied deity,14 some kind of ritual figure," a cult-object associated with fertility 3 P.

Since the solitary type-B bronze anthropomorph ( Figure 4 ) from Kolabarti ( Bihar ) represents an evolved form of the type-A copper anthro- pomorphs from the Upper Gangã valley, we may reasonably conclude that the type-A copper anthropomorphs also represent male figures. The type-A copper anthropomorphs also bear certain signs of a super human ( mahS • purufa-laksana ), viz. the broad high head some time tapering into a point ; a thick regular ridge around the head ( prabhã-mandala ) ; the long incurved arms ( Bjãnu-bãhu ) ; the outstretched legs ( ãlidha - or pratyalidha-p&amp;da ); the lion-like wide chest ( purvãrdhakãya ) ; and extensive short gouges or dents on either surface simulating the bodily hair ( ekaikaroma ). The afore- said physical features suggest that the type-A copper anthropomorphs from the Upper Gangã valley undoubtedly represent images of a powerful god. An example of the type-A copper anthropomorph from Sheorajpur, now preserved in the State Museum Lucknow ( no. 0. 37 a ), bears a hori- zontal fish-symbol on its chest ( Figure 2 ) and a pair of indistinct cross-like remanents on its back. 30 The single fish engraved on the chest most probably represents an early stage in the development of a pair of fish ( mina-mithuna ) - a well-known auspicious motif ( astamaňgalika ) in Indian art. The two indistinct cross-like remanents on the back possibly represent an early form of the svastika - another auspicious symbol in Indian art. The two cross-like motifs may also symbolise the sun ( Sfirya ) and the moon ( Candra ) - the two most important planets, which remained under popular worship through the ages. It is too well-known that the sun and moon were shown as attri- butes in images of Vi§?u, šiva and Buddha during the early historic period. The portrayal of above motifs suggests that the type-A copper anthropo- morphs from the Upper Gangã valley represent images of an auspicious supreme god. 16 R. C.

As discu- ssed elsewhere, the late Rgvedic Aryans were the authors of the Copper Hoard / OCP culture.21 Did the Rgvedic Aryans practise idolatory ? Whereas the scholars, like F. Max Müller,23 H. H. Wilson,23 R. P. Chanda,24 etc. have completely ruled out the possibility of image-worship in the Rgvedic Aryan society, the orientalists, namely Bollensen,25 S. V. Venkateshwara,26 E. W.

In support of his thesis Venkateshwara38 has quoted the following Rgvedic verse, which refers to the sale and purchase of an Indra image : 21 Krishna Kumar, "Religion and Authorship of the Copper Hoard/ OCP Culture Mt Journal of the Ganganatha Jha Kendriys Sanskrit Vidyapitha , XLIII, 1987, pp. 61-66 ; " The Authorship of the Copper Hoard / OCP Culture in Northern India Panchãli , III. 1988, pp. 125-128 ; •• The Copper Hoard / OCP Culture in the Mid- Gaigä Valley : An Appraisal in the Light of New Discoveries " in C.

We do not sell you even at a large price ; O vajra-bearer ! not even for thousands or ten thousands of riches ; O possessor of many treasures ! not even in exchange of untold wealth. ' ) Venkateshwara42 further noticed a few distinct references pertaining to the art of image-making and praise for the artists, who manufactured images of lord Indra in the following Rgvedic hymns : Yüyam gãvo medayathã kršam cid ašríram cit krnuthã supratîkam / Bhadram grham kr nut ha bhadravãco brahd vo vaya ucyate sabhãsu //ISJ Suvlras te janitã manyata dyaur indrasya karts svapastamo bhüt / Ya im jajãna svaryam suvajram anapacyutam sadaso na bhúrna // 41 The expression • ašríram cit ' ( ugly mass ) in the first stanza possibly refers to a ' lump of copper ' or * copper ore ' used for making ' beautiful images ' ( supratîkam ).4B The other reference 'Indrasya kartä svapastamo bhüt ' in the next verse testifies that manufacturing images of Indra was a skilled profession, which commanded high respect in the Rgvedic society.46 Das4' noticed a few references pertaining to the images of lord Indra in the following Rgvedic verses : Arbhako na kumãrako ,dhi tifthan navam ratham / Sa pak$an mahisam mrgam pitre mãtre vibhukratum // 2 tv. suSipra dam pat e ratham tisthã hiranyayam / Adha dyukçam sacevahi sahasrapãdam arusam svastigãm anehasam // 4* The' epithet • arbhako na kumãrakah ' (like a small limbed boy) »• Çgveda, IV. 24. 10. 40 Hopkins, 1977, op. cit., p. 150. 41 Çgveda, VIII. 1.

In view of the large size of a chariot, a relatively small figure of Indra must have resembled ' a small- limbed boy '. As regards the Rgvedic hymn that refers to the sale and purchase of an Indra image Venkateshwara has pertinently observed : " permanent images of Indra were made and hired for what was in all probability an Indra festival, and there were apparently images of Vj-tra made for each occasion, whence plural ' vrtrãni * to be slain by Indra. " 52 Therefore, we may con- clude that in the Rgvedic verse referred to above the word ' vrtrãni ' most probably stood for temporary images of demon Vrtra, which were slain thro- ugh permanent images of lord Indra. Here, it is significant to note that the incurved arms of the type-A copper anthropomorphs from the Upper GangS valley are generally sharpened on the outer edges ( Figures 1, 2 &amp; 3 ) which could have easily slain the temporary images of demon Vrtra in the Rgvedic sacrificial rituals. Lord Indra was the first and foremost god in the Rgvedic pantheon* He protected his devotees from all possible dangers and miseries. This fact is amply reflected in the following Atharvavedic hymns : Yo adya senyo vadho jighãmsanna udì rate / Indrasya tatra bâhû samantam pari dadmafi 1 1 93 ( ' If a blow from a spear desiring to kill us starts off today, in that case we put on all sides around us Indra's arms.' ) Pari dadma Indrasya bâhû samantam trãtustrõyatam nah / Deva savitah soma rãjan sumansam ma kjnu svastaye 1 1 51 ( ' We put on all sides around us the arms of Indra, the protector t Let him protect us. ) Das, 1927, op. cit., pp. 145-147. 40 Ibid., pp. 145-147. 81 Venkateshwara, 1930, op. cit ., p. 24.

" Atharvaveda, VI. 99. 3.</page><page sequence="7">Kumar s Identification of the Rgvedic Images of Indra 229 The above two veises clearly express the desire of the Atharvavedic sages seeking protection from their enemies' attack through the arms of lord Indra. Here, it is important to observe that the arms of the type- A copper anthropomorphs from the Upper GaàgS valley are not only invariably long, but incurved also ( Figures 1, 2 &amp; 3 ), as if lord Indra has put bis arms on all sides around his devotees to protect them from the blows from spears of their enemies. As noticed above a type-A copper anthropomorph from Sheorajpur, now preserved in the State Museum, Lucknow, bears a horizontal fish-symbol on its chest. The fish symbolises water and Indra - the lord of earthly water - carries it in the form of rain-showers. In (he light of the foregoing observations we may reasonably conclude that the protohistoric copper/bronze anthropomorphs from Northern India represent the late Rgvedic images of lord Indra, and thus they mark the begin- ning of the Brahmanical iconography in the GaágS valley. If the new identification of the copper / bronze anthropomorphs as proposed above is correct, it also suggests that the authorship of the Copper Hoard / OCP cul* ture of Northern India may be attributed to the late Rgvedic Aryans,5* who were the indigenous people of the Saptasindhavah region in Indo-Pak sub- continent. Since idolatory was not prevalent during the early Çgvedic age, the protohistoric copper / bronze anthropomorphs evidently belong to the late Çgvedic age.
