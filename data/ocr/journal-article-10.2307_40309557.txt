<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art Supports New Plague Science To the Editor - It was with great interest that we examined the painting "The Piazza del Mercado in Naples during the Plague of 1656" by Carlo Coppola, which was featured on the 15 July 2008 cover of Clin- ical Infectious Diseases. The painting shows a vivid depiction of Naples during the rampant outbreak of Yersinia pestis infec- tion. The painting helps explain the ram- pant spread of "The Black Death" in me- dieval Europe. Careful inspection of the painting shows numerous partially naked plague victims, some apparently being stripped of their clothes by passersby. Other paint- ings have illustrated this behavior in even greater detail, such as Alexandre-Jean- Baptiste Hesse's painting of funerary honors given to Titian [1]. We submit that the rampant spread of pandemic plague through Europe is better ex- plained by louse- and/or human flea-in- fested clothes than the widely accepted dogma that the ubiquitous black rat and its anthropomorphic fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) were responsible. The human body louse has recently been shown to be an effective vector of plague in a rabbit model [2]. Infected hu- man fleas (Pulex irritans) and lice (Pedic- ulosis humanus corporis) have been col- lected from patients affected with plague [3]. Thus, pandemic plague as a result of human-to-human ectoparasite transmis- sion is scientifically plausible. Additional historical evidence further supports this explanation. Lice were ubiquitous, often exuberant, human ectoparasites in the Middle Ages that were vividly portrayed in the descrip- tion of the funeral of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was mur- dered on 29 December 1270. As the de- ceased's body grew cold, a chronicler re- corded the scene as follows: "The vermin boiled over like water in a simmering caul- dron, and the onlookers burst into alter- nate weeping and laughing" [4, p. 185]. Additionally, IJsbrand van Diemerbroeck, in 1665, reported transmission of plague by clothes infested with human body lice [3]. The famous Italian author Giovanni Boccaccio provided an eyewitness account of the plague and its impact on severely affected Florence as follows: "...but the mere touching of the clothes, or whatso- ever other thing had been touched or used of the sick appeared of itself to commu- nicate the malady to the toucher" [5, p. 79]. Most of the rampant plague epidem- ics occurred during winter months, when clothes would have been more likely to be reused shortly after the death of their owner. Finally, a number of outbreaks, in- cluding the one in Naples in 1656, are suggested to have arisen when a single in- fected human brought plague to a city. The success of local public health mea- sures that seemed to limit the plague's dev- astation in Nuremburg, Germany, and Milan, Italy, can be best explained by the disruption of human-to-human ectopar- asitic transmission. In Nuremburg, where the clothing and bedding of the dead were destroyed and their rooms fumigated, the death rate attributable to the black plague was only ~ 10% of the population, perhaps the lowest of any major city in the Western CORRESPONDENCE • CID 2009:48 (1 January) • 137</page><page sequence="2">world [6]. Municipal authorities in Milan, Italy, walled up houses in which plague victims were discovered, isolating them and their healthy housemates. This prac- tice could not have affected infection transmission via rats and rat fleas, but the Milan death rate was limited to only 15% of the population, the lowest in all of Italy [6]. In summary, the rampant spread of plague within cities and across Europe is not well explained by the traditional model of rats and rat fleas as the primary means of pandemic spread. Historical de- scriptions, including Coppola's painting, point to a more efficient means of trans- mission of pandemic plague. The scientific basis for human louse-borne plague has already been demonstrated. Future studies should evaluate the potential role of other arthropods in human-to-human trans- mission and should substantiate the role human fleas and lice play in plague trans- mission in infested populations. Through good science and a careful historical study, we will, hopefully, prevent a repeat of the plague's grim history.
