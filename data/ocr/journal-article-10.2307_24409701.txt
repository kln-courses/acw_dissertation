<plain_text><page sequence="1">BRITISH ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN the nineteenth CENTURY. By P. L. Payne. Lon don: Macmillan. 1974. 80 pp. £0-65. The relative decline in British economic superiority which eventually followed its initial rise to international pre-eminence during the first industrial revolution has inevitably conjured up the analogue of stages in human development. The anthropomorphic approach to economic history has reached its apotheosis in the study of the entrepreneur and in particular in the tendency to attribute to entrep reneurship an almost independent cycle of development similar to that of man himself—from infancy to senility. Perhaps it is because many students find it easier to identify with human elements than to grapple with such abstractions as business cycles and the terms of trade that seminar discussion of the entrepreneur is very popular, and for that reason alone this careful survey of the complexities in the debate over the performance of British entrepreneurs in the nineteenth century will be welcomed by teachers and students alike. Theoretical discussion and secondary level debate has dominated the topic and Payne stresses the paucity of research monographs on which any conclusions must depend. Nevertheless, his general conclusion can be summed up as follows: that the quality of British entrepreneur ship was probably inferior during the industrial revolution (and less critical to it) than has often been claimed, while in the forty years before 1914 performance has probably been underrated. The variables which explain the apparent change in quality are the lack of information on individual firms and entrepreneurial behaviour; an unbalanced pre-occupation in the literature, especially since</page><page sequence="2">130 REVIEWS AND SHORT NOTICES Schumpeter, with the entrepreneurial contribution to economic development; and a tendency to overlook the obvious fact that as British industrial pre-eminence before the 1870s was fortuitous, inasmuch that the set of conditions within which British entrepreneurs operated were conducive to business success, so the development of competitive economies from the mid-nineteenth century rendered conditions more difficult for entrepreneurs, and exposed those weaknesses which had always been present. Clapham would not have disagreed. Payne's contribution to this series sponsored by the Economic History Society maintains the high stan dards achieved by others and not least in value is his survey of areas for research in the future. There remains, however, a nagging dissatisfaction with his treatment of entrepreneurial performance over time without a general discussion of such basic influences on behaviour as factor costs, prices, and profitability, none of which appear in the index.
