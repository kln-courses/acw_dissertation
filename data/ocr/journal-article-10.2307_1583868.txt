<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROSOPON AND HYPOSTASIS IN BASIL OF CAESAREA'S AGAINST EUNOMIUS AND THE EPISTLES BY LUCIAN TURCESCU St. Basil of Caesarea's contribution to the shaping of trinitarian theol- ogy was paramount. Although he died onJanuary 1, 379, before the Second Ecumenical Council (Constantinople, 381), it can be claimed that this very council represented Basil's posthumous triumph over his doctrinal enemies because of the creed it sanctioned. Since the synod accepted Basil's mod- erate formula in regard to the divinity of the Holy Spirit, one can say that Basil even triumphed over his friend Gregory of Nazianzus and his brother Gregory of Nyssa who insisted on a more explicit affirmation of the divin- ity of the Spirit. It is, therefore, Basil's terminology that I want to deal with in this article; yet I shall focus on a pair of terms different from the pair usually examined by historians of dogma. When discussing Basil's trinitarian theology, scholars usually take into account the pair oaoia-ixtacr6aSt;, explaining how Basil distinguished between the two. So far very few have been interested in a systematic study of another pair to which Basil paid much heed, namely pip6o0rov-v'n6roatot;, which I propose to analyze in this article. To my knowledge, there are actually only three somewhat more systematic studies of the latter pair, but they, too, have their deficiencies or offer too brief a treatment of the topic.' The remainder of the scholarly studies of the two terms in the Cappadocians are only scattered chapters in articles or books whose main topics are more general; they either mention the Cappadocians very briefly in a larger context or confine themselves to one or two of their works and present them very briefly. Another category comprises the studies that deal A.

Consequently, a systematic evaluation of the meanings of the two terms in the thought of the Cappadocian Fathers (and not only in them) is badly needed. I confine this study to some writings of Basil, namely Against Eunomius and the relevant Epistles, in order to show the development Basil's thought knew in regard to the meanings of the two terms. This evaluation con- tributes to the understanding of the concept of person which in my view owes a lot to the fourth-century trinitarian disputes. Against Eunomius I start by analyzing the two terms in Basil of Caesarea's Against Eunomius 1-3 (CEun hereafter), because this is one of his earliest theological works, written in the 360s.2 Moreover, as I shall prove, a certain development in the use of bin6oxaoat can be detected in Basil's thought as early as CEun. Concerning the date of CEun, scholars agree that it should have been writ- ten at the beginning of Basil's theological activity, i.e., in the first half of the 360s. Nevertheless, the most prudent scholars place it between 360 and 366,3 while others between 363 and 365.4 In taking into account Basil's Ep. 223,5, addressed to his mentor of asceticism, Eustathius of Sebaste, B. Sesboiie and P. Fedwick date CEun before the fall of 364, when the Synod of Lampsacus took place.5 In Ep. 223,5, Basil reminds his mentor, bishop Eustathius of Sebaste, that at Eusinoe, he (i.e., Eustathius) and a large number of bishops were about to leave for the Synod of Lampsacus. 2 Greek text in Basil of Caesarea, Contre Eunome suivi de Eunome, "Apologie," introduc- tion, translation and notes by B.

Gribomont delays the dates of CEun and the Synod of Lampsacus to 365,7 although the date of this synod, fall 364, is well established.8 In his dating CEun to 360 or 361, T. Kopecek relies on the information contained in Ep. 20 rather than Ep. 223,5 and with Tillemont dates the former to 362.9 In Ep. 20.25 Basil tells a sophist named Leontius: "I sent you my writings against Eunomius."'l It is true that the reference to "arguments against the heresy" (Ep. 223,5) is not as explicit as "my writings against Eunomius" (Ep. 20.25). Yet, besides CEun, there is no other Basilian doctrinal writing of that period so impor- tant as to be ordered by bishops for use at a synod. In that period Basil wrote a lot, but his writings are either moral and ascetical, or homilies, or letters. It is very unlikely that the writing of any of these, except CEun, was assisted by a large number of bishops. Therefore, it seems to me that Ep. 223,5 alludes indeed to CEun, and consequently Ep. 20 should be dated sometime after the Synod of Lampsacus. In this case the date of comple- tion of CEun is 364. In CEun Basil does not use pooContov as a term with special connota- tions, nor does he dismiss it, as he would do later in the trinitarian dis- putes. Sometimes, tp6oocoov simply means "face" as in CEun 3,7.43 (669c): "we will be deemed worthy of a face-to-face contemplation" (q; npxo; cp6oo30ov ecopiag). This is also the meaning encountered in the Septuagint and the New Testament, and Basil even mentions texts such as Lam. 4:20 or Mt. 18:10. In most of the fourteen passages where it occurs in this par- ticular writing, np66oNoov can be rendered as "person" in the widest sense and it is applied without reservations to both human and divine persons. Yet it does not seem to be a strong term; therefore, perhaps, Basil does not attach a special significance to it. In one passage, Basil hints at the meaning of npooconov (person) as opposed to pa&amp;yua (thing). Thus, in a context in which he speaks against Eunomius, Basil says: "Having worn out his impiety apropos of things (xoit npip&amp;xaot), [and] before passing to the consideration of persons (zia ipoocna), [Eunomius] wants to appear as 6 Basil, Lettres, ed.

In another passage ipooo'ov is an anthropomorphism which the French translator renders by "mouth" (bouche): "the word of the mouth of God" (ic tpoooMino TOV Oeoi) (CEun 1,8.40; 528d). This is the only text in CEun where the expression tp6ooacov roOV Oeo occurs; to translate itp6oowov by "person" here could suggest the idea that there is only one person in the Godhead. Other texts where the phrase ?1c tpoatomou occurs (unaccompanied by the noun "God") can well be rendered as "attributed to the person of": "First, let us take from the Gospel the 'In the beginning was the Word' (Jn. 1:1), and from the Psalm this saying attributed to the person of the Father (EK tpooacxoi Txo Ilaxpop), 'From the womb I gave birth to you before the morning-star' (Ps. 109:3)." (CEun 2,17.24; 608a). Basil even mentions sayings "attributed to the person of the Lord" (Kic cpoodjcoiu TOV Kupiou-CEun 2,18.17; 609a) or "attributed to the person of the Wisdom" (?K npocTov ) tiV {o(pia;- CEun 2,20.17; 616b). Another meaning of irp6oonov is that of "character" in a play; Basil uses the word with the alpha-privative prefix in order to say that Eunomius' Apology is a "characterless (&amp;apoC6eonov) theatrical fiction" (CEun 1,2.36; 504b). He thinks this about the Apology, because, under the guise of this literary genre, Eunomius practises nothing but a captatio benev- olentiae of his audience. In other words, there is no accuser to justify the writing of this apology. Thomas Kopecek thinks that when stating this, Basil has in mind the council held at Constantinople in December 359 where the Homoeans had the majority of votes on their side." Concerning the term Uto6oxaog in CEun, the texts where it occurs cart be grouped under four main headings: substance, subsistence, substratum, and person. Thus, when quoting Heb. 1:3, Basil preserves the biblical meaning of "substance," although later both he and Gregory of Nyssa will give up this meaning in favor of that of "person."'2 At this point, 6t6oxatot; is still synonymous with oUXta, and Basil takes advantage of that in order to assert the consubstantiality of God the Father with his Son: "For it has been spoken of... the 'imprint of the substance' (XcapaKilp ri g iooxat&amp;oeS , Heb. 1:3), in order that we be taught the consubstantial (rb bOioolotov)" (CEun 1,20.11; 556c).'3 When making this statement, did Basil have in mind " T. Kopecek, A Histopy of Neo-Arianism, 2. 304-306. For the December 359 council, cf. also J.N.D. Kelly, Early Christian Creeds (New York: Longman, 31972) 292-3. 12 Cf. CEun 3,3.5 (661a) which will be discussed below. Cf. also Gregory of Nyssa, De df usiae et hyp. 6-8 (= "Basil's" Ep. 38, Courtonne 1.89-91). '3 Homoousios in regard to the Trinity is a hapax legomenon in CEun. Nevertheless, to affirm that the Son is divine Basil uses other expressions: "connaturality (auCupqi) with 377</page><page sequence="5">LUCIAN TURCESCU the Councils of Nicaea (325) and especially Serdica (343), which condemned those who would say that the Son is of another bxt6oacaoi or ovoia than the Father, thereby making the two terms synonymous? Probably yes, although in CEun Basil uses another meaning of Voxatoaatq, namely "per- son," that overtly invalidate this old synonymy. However, he does not even allude to these councils in CEun. Later in this article I shall present Basil's interpretation of the formulations of these councils in regard to in6oaotSq in his Ep. 125. Basil also uses ur6oaraot; to express "something that has subsistence" or simply the "subsistence." Eunomius tries to show that the ungeneratedness of God the Father is not a human concept but God's very substance; there- fore, the Son, being generated, is dissimilar (av6oiotov) from the Father according to the very substance. In so doing, Eunomius disparages the term 'concept' as having no reality or subsistence (Apol. 8,1-6) or in Basil's words: "[Eunomius] clings to the term 'concept' (itivota), as if it signified absolutely nothing and had no subsistence but in the act of its utterance (a&amp;X' ev ig6vp Rtj popopoa riv i6oOacnlov KEKTCmELvp)" (CEun 1,5.133-137; 52 la). To Basil, who plays the embarrassed because "constrained" to use Aristotelian language, God's ungeneratedness does not show what [God] is (i ke'tiv) but how he is (onro); eoaiv) (CEun 1,15; 545b). In this context, an interesting occurrence, although unique in CEun, is the phrase xpo67coS; Ti; inooxa&amp;oeo;, since it announces another famous phrase used by Basil, namely Tpo6no vTfi; bapeoS;. Basil says that the Tp67o;s Tfn; bioaToa&amp;eo; shows how God is, not what he is; therefore, the Tp6onos; i; inooxaore(a in the case of God does not indicate God's nature ((pqots), nor in the case of human beings their material substratum (rb iXutKcv bi)oKceiLvov) (CEun 1,15; 548a-b). The third meaning of bz6oxtacGt4 in CEun is that of "substratum." For example, in CEun 2,4 Basil refutes an assertion Eunomius made in his Apology 18,16-18 that "if names are different, substances are also different." He says: Whenever we hear "Peter," the name does not make us think of his sub- stance-by substance (oi6ua) I mean now the material substratum (r6 iXtIKOV the Father" (2,15.31) and "connaturality of the substance" (n6 o6Lop'uei rfiS ovotiaS in 2,28.34). Even if, according to Gribomont ("Intransigence and Irenicism in Saint Basil's 'De Spiritu Sancto,"' Word and Spirit 1 [1979] 116) who follows Simonetti, Basil first appeared in a group of "Neo-Nicenes" who were basically of sound faith but did not accept the homoousios because it was not biblical, the occurrence of this term in a work written before the council of Lampsacus confirms Basil's change of attitude toward the Vricaenum. 378</page><page sequence="6">PROSOPON AND HTPOSTASIS IN BASIL OF CAESAREA tlCOKEitlevov), which the name never indicates-, but the notion of properties considered in regard to him is imprinted in us.

Later on, Basil uses no6aracotS with this meaning several more times (e.g. 2,6.13 [581c]; 2,9.4 [588b]; 2,9.21 [588d]). The fourth and last meaning itno6xaot; has in this particular writing is that of "person." In CEun 3 Basil refers to the "three persons" in God, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. In interpreting Is. 6:3, he writes: "It is therefore, I think, that it was written in Isaiah that the Seraphims cry three times 'Holy!', because the holiness according to nature is contem- plated in the three persons (ev rptoui Ttai t'ooxarocotv)" (CEun 3,3.2-5; 661a). The trinitarian context imposes the translation by "persons" and it should be noted that the phrase Tpe;tS 'iooxra&amp;oe is a hapax legomenon in CEun. The Epistles In this section I shall analyze the meanings of the two terms in Basil's letters. Since not all of the letters where these terms occur are of significant interest for the scope of this article, I confine my study to only several of them. Moreover, the ones I have chosen are among those unanimously recognized today as authentic. One of the most important letters scholars used to refer to when dealing with lpo6aomov, ionT6azotg, and oatia is Ep. 38 of the Basilian corpus. Yet, scholarly studies such as those undertaken by Anders Cavallin,14 Reinhard Hiibner15 and Paul Fedwick16 have shown that in reality this letter belongs to St. Gregory of Nyssa, and most students 14 Anders Cavallin, Studien zu den Briefen des hl.

Neither do I take into account some other letters that are spurious such as: Ep. 8 (= Evagrius Ponticus), Ep. 10 and Ep. 189 (= Gregory of Nyssa).18 The letters I do consider in a chronological order are nos. 9, 52, 125, 210, 214 and 236.19 EPISTLE 9.20 Ep. 9 is addressed to the enigmatic Maximus the Philosopher who asked Basil for some copies of the works of the third-century bishop Dionysius of Alexandria and wanted to hear Basil's opinion about the latter. Ep. 9 is believed to have been written at the beginning of the 360s. Yet, whereas Pouchet and Fedwick place it in 360-362,21 Hauschild dates it to summer(?) of 364, that is, at the same time as CEun.22 In my opinion, due to the precise terminology used and the distinctions made in section 2, this letter could have been written at the same time as CEun 2 or even 3, when Basil had started clarifying his thoughts about the trinitarian terminology, i.e., in 364. I elaborate below. In Ep. 9, 2 Basil expounds his views about Dionysius of Alexandria's writings solicited by Maximus the Philosopher. In 263 Dionysius wrote a book entitled Refutation and Apology, addressed to his namesake, bishop Dionysius of Rome, in which he used the term homoousios.23 Therefore, both Basil and Maximus think that they can learn a lesson from Dionysius' use of the homoousios. Basil says that Dionysius of Alexandria attempted to combat Sabellius. Yet, "although it was quite enough for him to show that the Father and the Son are not the same according to the subject (oi0 TxOaixv 'Tp o ,cOKepLIvC)," Dionysius went so far as to affirm in regard to the Father and the Son "not only a distinction of the persons (eirepOnrla TxOV 17 Nonetheless W.-D. Hauschild does not accept this attribution in his German trans- lation of Basil's letters (see Basil, Briefe 1. (Stuttgart: A. Hiersemann, 1990) 182 ff., n. 181). Nor does Jiirgen Hammerstaedt, "Zur Echtheit von Basiliusbrief 38," Tesserae: Festschrift fir Josef Engemann. Jahrbuch fir Antike und Christentum 18 (1991) 416-419. 18 Cf. Fedwick, "Abbreviations: 1.

Pouchet, Basile 117 ff.; P. Fedwick, "Chronology" 7, n. 24.

Pouchet, Basile 118. 380</page><page sequence="8">PROSOPON AND HrPOSTASIS IN BASIL OF CAESAREA {Unooxa&amp;ocov), but also a difference in substance (oaiat 5tao(popav), a diminu- tion in power and a variation of glory" (Ep. 9,2.16-21). Therefore, he had an unconstant attitude vis-a-vis the homoousios. Basil's own position in regard to the homoousios is of extreme importance: it is in the third section of this letter that he seems to have decided between the use of "unchangeably like in substance" (&amp;acapa Xaiot r o1oto; KiaC' ovoatav) and "consubstantial" (xr ob1oovotov). He sees a danger in the use of the former, because, if sepa- rated from "unchangeably," the "like in substance" can diminish the glory of the Son, thus subordinating him (Ep. 9,3.11-14). The synod held at Constantinople in January 360, alluded to by Basil in Ep. 9,3.12-13, did even more than that: it subordinated the Son by using the olLoto; in regard to him and by banning the use of oioxia and ouaxTaotg; as non-biblical.24 Moreover, as R. Hiibner has rightly noted, in Ep. 9,2, as well as in Ep. 52,3.2, Basil regards the homoousios as a protec- tion against an identity of the persons in the Sabellian sense.25 Therefore, in the end, Basil opts for homoousios as being "less open to fraud" (Ep. 9,3.16-18). Not the same was the case in his Ep. 361 (if this is his!) to Apollinarius, dated to 362(?) by Hauschild, where Basil explicitly preferred "unchangeably like" (a&amp;apaU(x icto; boLoio)) to homoousios.26 The decision he made in Ep. 9 was really significant to Basil, since, let us remember, he first appeared in a group that did not accept the homoousios.27 Nevertheless, Basil does not intransigently reject the use of "unchangeably like in sub- stance," for he is mindful of his irenic mission among the various ecclesi- astical parties of that time. In addition, as Fedwick showed, Basil did not understand the unity of faith and proclamation of the Church in a nar- row sense.28 Ep. 9 depicts a Basil who is aware of the importance of maintaining the distinction of the persons in the Godhead, as well as of the importance of homoousios. In CEun, as shown, only in the end bioaxaat; came to mean "person." Here, he explicitly says against Sabelius that the divine persons should be distinguished. Therefore, I am reluctant to date Ep. 9 too early 24 Cf. J.N.D. Kelly, Early Christian Creeds 293 f. 25 Reinhard M.

It is strange, however, that Basil does not make any reference to CEun in this letter. EPISTLE 125.29 The next letter I analyze is a confession of faith dictated by Basil and signed by Eustathius of Sebaste. Ep. 125 was written in August 373, according to Fedwick and Hauschild, or maybe in June 373, accord- ing to Pouchet.30 Another epistle, Ep. 99,31 describes Basil's attempts to con- vince Eustathius of Sebaste to sign this confession of orthodox faith, since the latter was suspicious of Pneumatomachianism in the eyes of his suffragan bishop, Theodotus of Nicopolis.32 Basil, a close friend and former disciple of Eustathius of Sebaste, tried to clear this old ascetic of the charges of heresy brought against him and to reconcile him with Theodotus. Theodotus extended the suspicion of heresy over Basil, too. So, this confession of faith was also an opportunity for the latter to display his own orthodoxy. Eventually, as Ep. 99 shows, Eustathius signed the confession of faith pro- posed by Basil, despite Theodotus of Nicopolis' affirmation to the contrary. Nevertheless, Eustathius' inconstancy of faith and opportunism were well- known, so his adherence to Basil's confession of faith was ephemeral. Besides Eustathius' opportunism, Pouchet suggests two other reasons for his repu- diation of this confession of faith. They are the following: the appointment by Basil of the priest Poimenius of Caesarea to the episcopal see of Satala which was under the jurisdiction of Eustathius; the doctrinal radicalism of the members of Eustathius' entourage.33 Therefore, it would be no wonder if both Basil and Theodotus were right in their accounts, despite their being contradictory. In his De Spiritu Sancto, Hermann Dorries reconstructed the relations between Basil and Eustathius and showed also that the lat- ter indeed repudiated this confession of faith.34 Accordingly, Basil's attempt at reconciliation between Eustathius and Theodotus was not only unsuc- cessful, but led to a rupture between Basil himself and Eustathius. 29 Courtonne 2.30-34. 30 Fedwick, "Chronology" 16; Hauschild in Basil, Briefe 1.240; Pouchet, Basile 280. 31 Courtonne 1.214-18. 32 Cf. also Epp. 224,3.1-15; 244,2.13-21.

As in the previous letter analyzed, the other term of interest for this article, 7p6o0onxov, does not appear at all. This can indicate a certain low significance tp6ooowov has for trinitarian theology in Basil's opinion. Besides, Ep. 125 is paramount for Basil's own confes- sion of faith, because it shows his increasing attachment to the Nicene creed. The entire second section of this letter is occupied by the text of the Nicene creed. Ep. 125 opens by a reference to the creed drawn up by the "blessed Fathers" at Nicaea. Those who wish to be received into communion with the orthodox should be required to profess the Nicene creed as a sufficient proof of their new commitment. Nonetheless, Basil warns that even among those who profess this faith there are some who misinterpret certain words of the creed. He gives the examples of Marcellus of Ancyra and the fourth- century Sabellians who misinterpreted the homoousios and the Nicene anath- ema, "If anyone says that the Son is of another substance or bx6otaatc (e ix{Epaq oo{iatq 'i vtooxariaeo), the catholic and apostolic Church anathe- matizes him."35 Basil says that Marcellus, "in his impiety against the vitRoaaoy of the Lord (eiq rlv bxo6TTaoIv Txo Kupi{o)) and explaining him as a mere 'word'," alleged to have inferred this from the "consubstantial" (Ep. 125,1.22-25). The "Sabellians" whom Basil envisages in the same letter seem to be the Eustathians, partisans and followers of Eustathius of Antioch, whose slogan after Nicaea was "gia 'o6oxcaotS" of the Godhead.36 They understood, wrongly according to Basil, that "brcn6oaot; and substance are the same thing (t6sokxaotv Kcat ovoiav Txa-6v)" (Ep. 125,1.26-29). "For," con- tinues Basil, "it is not said therein [in the Nicene anathema quoted above] that substance and int6oOxcatt are the same" (Ep. 125,1.32). This makes him argue that, in fact, the Nicene Fathers understood Trn6omaot; as dis- tinct from oc(ia. Basil's argument is the following: If the words revealed one and the same meaning, what was the need of each separately? But it is evident that, since some denied that the Son is of the substance (o6oaia) of the Father, and others said that he was not of the sub- stance but of some other iT6ooxaat;, thus they condemned both positions as foreign to the opinion of the Church. For, when they came to revealing their opinion, they said that the Son was of the substance (o6o{ia) of the Father, 35 See Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils, ed. Norman P. Tanner, 1 (London: Shed &amp; Ward, 1990) 5. 36 Cf. R.P.C.

Thus the for- mer statement is laid down as a rejection of faulty opinion, while the latter contains the declaration of the doctrine of salvation. It is necessary, therefore, to confess the Son as of the same substance as the Father (6gjooaotov xOv Yiov Tx) Iaerpi), as it is written, and to confess the Father in his own proper per- son (ev i5ia vixooxraeit), and the Son in his own, and the Holy Spirit in his own, according as the Fathers themselves have clearly set forth. For sufficiently and clearly have they shown this when they said, "Light of Light," that the one is who begot and the other who was begotten. Yet Light and Light, so that the notion of the substance is one and the same. (Ep. 125,1.32-49)37 The interpretation of the Nicene use of {n76oxraat; provided by Basil is not easy to support, because the text of the anathema is rather ambiguous.38 First of all, Basil overlooks the fact that rb6oxaraot was considered by many as synonymous with ovotia at least until the synod held in 362 at Alexandria, and this synonymy caused endless trouble. For example, Alexander him- self, bishop of Alexandria, in whose time the synod of Nicaea took place in 325, preferred 'i6aoraoty or (potS often in contexts where owoia would have been possible.39 The synonymy was due to the meaning of xpeaToa- vat (= to lie under) which made ib6ooataoa an equivalent of "substratum" and consequently of ovtoia. Origen tried to distinguish these terms in Comjn 1,24.151-2; 11,10.75-76 and CCels VIII,12,40 but his opinion was not influential. Second, as I already pointed out, in CEun 1,20.11 Basil himself takes advantage of the synonymy of the two words in order to affirm the con- substantiality of God the Father with his Son. Third, Basil says that ootia 37 I used Deferrari's translation slightly altered (Saint Basil, The Letters 1 [London: Heinemann, 1926]). 38 H. Dorrie said that Nicaea condemned explicitly the Arian teaching of different "hypostases" in God (see his "'Y6oxTOrat;: Wort- und Bedeutungsgeschichte" in idem, Platonica Minora [Munchen: W. Fink, 1976] 55).

In his "Der trinitarische Gebrauch des Hypo- stasisbegriffs bei Origenes" (Jahrbuch fir Antike und Christentum 34 (1991) 12-20), Jurgen Hammerstaedt argues that the meaning of bin6oxtzao as used by Origen is different from the meaning imposed by the Cappadocians. I am inclined to disagree with Hammerstaedt. I do acknowledge that in numerous Origenian texts bin6oxaoy; is the exact equivalent of ovoiat; but this equivalence does not prevent the existence of the particular passages just indicated, in which Origen uses the two terms with different meanings. It is perhaps the scantiness of the latter that makes them more obvious. 384</page><page sequence="12">PROSOPON AND HYPOSTASIS IN BASIL OF CAESAREA is said about the Son's common substance with the Father, whereas i)W6oTaaou allegedly expresses the doctrine of salvation. In other words, the former refers to the theologia, whereas the latter to the oikonomia. Yet the context in which the Nicene Fathers anathematize whomever discriminates between the Son's and Father's ouoia and t6oxatota;, thus making the two words synonyms, is not an economic one as Basil insinuates. The Vzcaenum deals here with the Son's generation from the Father and his immutability, as well as with the saying "there was a time when he was not"; no mention of the Son's incarnation is made in this particular passage. Fourth, there was a certain tradition, however, that might have left room for the interpretation embraced by Basil. This tradition went back to Eusebius of Caesarea who, in writing to his diocese to justify his sub- scription to the Jicaenum, explained that the Son "is not from some other i6ocTxaotl or substance, but from the Father" (Ril ~ E ertpaqS tvb i booxra- oeo rS alt oo)tiaS, a&amp;X' ?K To caz;poS).41 This interpretation indeed allows for the conclusion that the Son is another person (or hypostasis) than the Father, "so that there are two, and indeed three, divine hypostases."42 Fifth, Basil might also have read the famous letter of Athanasius of Alexandria, known as the Tomus ad Antiochenos (the synodal letter of the council held in 362 in Alexandria),43 where a distinction is made between oictia and i6xcratag. Even if Basil's interpretation of the Nicene iom6oraota in this epistle is forced, the epistle itself brandishes two things: 1) that Basil views the Nicaenum as the canon of orthodoxy and 2) that he is deeply convinced that the distinctions among the divine persons (imooaoaetq) should be empha- sized. Moreover, in the third part of Ep. 125 Basil affirms categorically the divinity of the Holy Spirit. He says that all those should be anathematized who call the Holy Spirit a creature and those who will not confess that he is holy by nature, as the Father and the Son are holy by nature, but deprive him of his divine and blessed nature (Ep. 125,3.16-21).44 41 Greek text in Opitz, Urkunden zur Geschichte des arianischen Streites 22; apud Stead, Divine Substance 239. 42 Stead, Divine Substance 240. 43 For the text of the Tomus ad Antiochenos, see J.

Ep. 52 is quite similar in content and structure to Ep. 125: the first three sections explain the "consubstantial" along almost the same lines as the previous letter, whereas the fourth underscores the divinity of the Holy Spirit. Hence one can infer either that both were written around the same date or that Basil might have recalled the arguments of Ep. 125 when he wrote Ep. 52 one or two years later. In Ep. 52 Basil introduces a theoretical explanation of the term "con- substantial" which, in my view, seems to be more nuanced than the expla- nation given in the previous letter. He says: "For nothing is of the same substance (consubstantial) with itself, but one thing is [consubstantial] with another thing" (Ep. 52,3.3-4). Now one can more easily understand why Basil insists that the "consubstantial" presupposes at least two different things, or persons in the case of Nicaea, of which the consubstantiality should be predicated. To this he adds that the homoousios "sets aright the error of Sabellius; for it does away with the identity of xno6aotaq (avatpei yap thiv tauvro6T a Tq i)oTxadoeox) and introduces a perfect notion of the persons (reXiaav v xrv poo tOcov Miv evvolav) [in the Godhead],... because it marks out the property of the persons (xrDv ibTooxaTdoev Tilv i6torrla) and at the same time sets forth the indistinguishableness of their nature" (Ep. 52,3.1-6). Some clarifications are necessary at this point. When first using iO6oxataot in this passage, Basil thinks of the Sabellian notion of VO6oxTaot;: Sabellius understood God as one and the same iTicoonaot (substance) mani- festing itself at times under different npo6onca ("masks" or "faces"). Basil says that, by warranting that nothing can be consubstantial with itself, the term "consubstantial" does away with this Sabellian confusion. The second time, Basil uses nL6oOxaoYt with the usual meaning he attributes to it in this period, i.e., "divine person." The phrase "a perfect notion of the per- sons [in the Godhead]" is also worth analysis: the presence of the adjec- tive "perfect" (rXeXla) indicates that the term ntp6ootOov alone is not sufficient to designate the divine persons. To Basil, the term ip6ooC0nov is rather weak and definitely has Sabellian overtones; therefore, to it Basil prefers -bo6xraoa;. 45 Courtonne 1.133-37. 46 Fedwick, "Chronology" 17; Hauschild in Basil, Briefe 1.196; Pouchet, Basile 339. 386</page><page sequence="14">PROSOPON AND HrPOSTASIS IN BASIL OF CAESAREA In order for it to become fitting to express the divine persons, ptpo60oov should be undergirded by the adjective "perfect."47 EPISTLE 236.48 Basil addressed this letter to his favorite spiritual son, bishop Amphilochius of Iconium, as part of an aide-memoire meant to help the latter to cope with the attacks of the Eunomians. The five letters of the package known as the i'olIvxloviztK6 (Ep. 234 - Ep. 236) were sent to Amphilochius at the beginning of A.D. 376, according to Fedwick and Pouchet.49 Hauschild dates Ep. 232 and 236 to A.D. 375, whereas for the remainder he hesitates between the beginning of 375 and 376.50 In this epistle Basil answers various questions asked by Amphilochius: the issue raised by the Anomoeans that Jesus Christ does not know the day and the hour of the end, the issue raised by the Encratites of the foods that are good to eat, the issue of the human affairs being managed according to fate, etc. The entire sixth section is devoted to explaining the difference between ooi{a and i6oxaaoaq. Robert Pouchet says that, after the death of his brother Basil and inspired by Ep. 236,6, Gregory of Nyssa composed an ampler dissertation on the same topic, the famous Ep. 38 in the Basilian corpus.51 Before the sixth section of Ep. 236 the word ntp6oolnov occurs twice. It can be translated by "person" in the largest sense or by "individual," but Basil does not attach to it any other special significance, be it trinitarian or anthropological, since the context deals with the Anomoean accusation mentioned above. Ep. 236,1.18-20 reads: "The term 'no one' seems to be a universal expression, so that not even one person (n6Tli iv Xpo6oonov) is excluded by this word." The next occurrence refers to the person of the Lord, in a context where Basil compares two versions (Matthew's and Mark's) of the account where the Lord is said to know not the day and the hour of the end. The text reads: "Therefore, passing over his [Lord's] own person (o6 &amp;et)xo xp6ooTCov) in the reading from Matthew, taken for granted, as the Lord said that the angels were in ignorance, but that the Father alone knew, saying by his silence that the knowledge of the Father was also his own..."

The text reads: OuTiaO and {n6ooxataa have the distinction that the common has with refer- ence to the particular (6 Kcotvbv npOb TO Ia0' i'caorov); for example, just as "an animal" (4ipov) has with reference to "a particular human" (Seiva avOpoiwov). For this reason we confess one substance (ootria) for the Godhead, so as not to hand down variously the notion of the being; but we confess that the in6ooxaot; is particular, in order that our conception of Father and Son and Holy Spirit may be unconfused and plain. For unless we think of the char- acteristics that are sharply defined in the case of each, as for example father- hood and sonship and holiness (caxpo'tpTa, i6ornla Kcai ytaiao6v), but from the general notion of being confess God, it is impossible to hand down a sound definition of faith. Therefore, we must add what is particular to what is common and thus confess the faith; the Godhead is something common, the paternity something particular, and combining these we should say: "I believe in God the Father." And again in the confession of the Son we should do likewise-combine the particular with the common and say: "I believe in God the Son." Similarly too in the case of the Holy Spirit, we should frame on the same principle our utterance of the reference to him and say: "I believe also in the divine Holy Spirit,"52 so that throughout the whole, both unity is preserved in the confession of the one Godhead, and that which is peculiar to the persons (r6 x'(V cpoob7ixov ilaitov) is confessed in the distinction made in the characteristics attributed to each. (Ep. 236,6.1-22) This text shows more clearly than the previous letters that Basil has come to a solid understanding of the notions he uses. 'YTo6aotSaa is now under- stood as a particular way of existence. np6oo7oov, as used at the end of the passage, seems to be synonym with i'noaraotq. Nonetheless, in the very next paragraph (Ep. 236,6.22-28), which I have not quoted because of its length, Basil insists that ip6oormov is redolent of Sabellianism. Consequently, he avoids using it as a technical term to designate the divine persons. In Basil's view the phrase rxpeig icooxra&amp;et is)an excellent protection against Sabellianism (cf. Ep. 236,6.34). Ep. 236,6 constitutes a reference to the trinitarian formula that Basil, more than any other, has established and imposed: one substance, three persons. This text also displays Basil's aware- ness that the trinitarian dogma is paramount for the sound, orthodox faith. In his book Amphilochius von Ikonium, Karl Holl says that the examples Basil uses in Ep. 236,6 and CEun 2,4 indicate an underdevelopment of both terminology and conception, because the Aristotelian categories of the 52 Note Basil's reluctance to say "God the Holy Spirit." 388</page><page sequence="16">PROSOPON AND HYPOSTASIS IN BASIL OF CAESAREA "common" (or "generic") and the "particular" can be applied to things, but are not fully adequate to express something personal. Although quot- ing a text such as De Spiritu Sancto 17,41-43, Holl still remains unconvinced that Basil's arguments are satisfactory.53 In De Spiritu Sancto 17,41-43 Basil dismisses the idea that the distinction between the Godhead and the persons is that between an abstract essence, such as humanity, and its concrete manifestations, such as man, so that the Holy Spirit could be regarded as a sub-class within the Godhead. Because of this text in Basil and other similar texts in the two Gregorys, R.P.C. Hanson says that "it is dangerous to argue confidently" that any of the Cappadocian Fathers is the exponent of the so-called "generic" theory, that assumes a generic understanding of the divine substance in contradistinction to an individual understanding of the divine persons, since they themselves did not put too much trust in analogies.54 A supplementary proof in favor of Hanson's opinion is the fact that the analogy of the "generic" and the "particular" is not the only anal- ogy the Cappadocians use to argue for one substance and three persons in God. They use many other analogies in order to express the Holy Trinity but are well aware that none of them can fully communicate the ineffable divine mystery. Holl also detects a conflict in Basil's argumentation, and this time I tend to agree with him, although with the aforementioned provision about analo- gies: on the one hand, Basil tries to name what differentiates (yvopioCLaTxa) the divine persons from each other; on the other hand, names such as "fatherhood" and "sonship" are relational names in Basil's view, thus indi- cating the relation that exists between the persons, i.e., the icovoveia.55 Albeit Holl construes on Ep. 38 (attributed to Gregory of Nyssa today), his theory, I think, holds true for Basil's Ep. 236 as well. Holl thinks that this and other inconsistencies blur the sharp distinction Basil wanted to main- tain between ooaia and iL6ooxtao.56 EPISTLE 210.57 This letter is the third piece of the trilogy formed by epis- tles 204, 207 and 210, all of which were addressed to the Neocaesareans. 53 Karl Holl, Amphilochius von Ikonium in seinem Verhdltnis zu den groflen Kappadoziern (Tubingen: J.C.B.

It seems that at the suggestion of Olympius (cf. Ep. 211) and in response to the "calumnies" launched against him by the bishop of Neocaesarea, Atarbius, Basil decided, before the fall of 376, to re-establish relations with this Church somehow over its bishop's head.58 These letters bear testimony to Basil's adhesion to the Nicene faith. Fedwick, Pouchet and Hauschild agree to date Ep. 210 to the summer of A.D. 376.59 Ep. 207 ends up with some serious caveats addressed to the clergy of Neocaesarea: "Only let important things prevail, and silence innovations in faith. Do not reject the persons (inooxaoiae). Do not deny the name of Christ. Do not misinterpret the words of Gregory [Thaumaturgus]. Other- wise, as long as we breathe and can speak, we cannot be silent before so great a danger to souls (Ep. 207,4.37-42)."6 One can see that, among others, the issue of the three persons in the Godhead had become a touch- stone of orthodoxy for Basil. Basil suspected bishop Atarbius of Neocaesarea himself of Sabellianism. Ep. 210 is directed mostly against the latter's lar- val Sabellianism. In the third section of this letter Basil equates Sabellianism with Judaism (3.13), because both reduce the Father, Son and Holy Spirit to only one 6coorauto;, by not recognizing the peculiarity of the persons (xb ii&amp;6tov ci)v 7E'ooxacoeov). Like Judaism, Sabellianism denies the existence of the Son and of the Spirit: "For he who calls Father, Son, and Holy Spirit one thing under many faces ('v icp&amp;yLa nounoXmp6ooanov), and makes one nt6ooraaut out of three, what else does he do but deny the existence from the eternity of the Only-begotten?" (Ep. 210,3.15-18). At the other extreme are those who, albeit acknowledging three tbcooratoetS in God, do not confess their community of substance (T6 Koivov Tfi; okctiaS), thus falling into polytheism (Ep. 210,5.25-27). At that time all parties were trying to use various formulas, biblical or preserved by the Tradition of the Church, to buttress their own-many times contradictory-doctrines.6' This was the case with the baptismal for- mula that reads: "Teach you all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (Mt. 28:19). Because 58 Pouchet, Basile 344, 479. 59 Fedwick, "Chronology" 17; Pouchet, Basile 344; Hauschild in Basil, Briefe 1.244. 60 Courtonne 2.188. 61 Cf. Holl, Amphilochius von Ikonium 118, 125 f., 129 f.

The term tp6oowov was suspect of Sabellianism in Basil's view. In Ep. 210 he makes this opinion even more clear: Sabellius himself spoke of "persons" (1Lpooola) in God, but these "persons" did not constitute reali- ties, but mere fictions. Therefore, I think, one can safely translate the Sabellian xpooMonx by "masks" or "faces." Basil says: For it is not sufficient to enumerate the difference of the persons (6wacpopa&amp; 7tpootcov), but it is necessary to confess that each person exists in a true subsistence ('icaotov xp ov pooov v nooxTa t &amp;airOtvli i)napXov). For not even Sabellius rejected this non-subsistent representation of the persons (d&amp;vmc6oxa- xov xv gpoaooOC0v avaTcXaol6v), saying that the same God, though one in substance, is transformed on every occasion according to necessary circum- stances, and is spoken of now as Father, and now as Son, and now as Holy Spirit" (Ep. 210,5.34-41). It thus becomes intelligible that if one wants to call the Father, Son or Holy Spirit np6oocna, one has to add immediately the phrase "existing in true subsistences,"62 lest one falls into the error of Sabellius. Basil is using here an old meaning of i'6oxaaot;, that of "subsistence," since it seems to support his argument against Sabellius. EPISTLE 214.63 Although having a different addressee than the previous epistle, namely, Count Terentius, Ep. 214 is very similar to Ep. 210 inas- much as the doctrinal content is concerned. While Fedwick and Pouchet agree that it was written in late summer or early fall of A.D. 376, Hauschild places it in September/October 376.64 Around 375 Terentius had been appointed as interim count of the Orient, that is, auxiliary of the prefect Modestus for the civil diocese of the Orient. Yet there was a schism at that time in the capital of the Orient, Antioch. The city was divided among three Nicene parties: the majority led by the priest Flavian during the exile of his bishop Meletius, the minority conducted by the bishop Paulinus, and the small Appolinarian community led by Vitalis.65 Basil was in communion 62 Or one can add "perfect" (cf. Ep. 125,3.1-6 discussed above). 63 Courtonne 2.202-206. 64 Fedwick, "Chronology" 17; Pouchet, Basile 537; Hauschild in Basil, Briefe 3.281. 65 See A. de Halleux, "'Hypostase' et 'personne"' 316-17. For an overview of the 391</page><page sequence="19">LUCIAN TURCESCU with Meletius who had a Homoean past,66 whereas the Westerners with Paulinus. Once Terentius arrived in Antioch bishop Paulinus and his par- tisans tried to gain him over to their cause. But Basil considered that Paulinus was wrong in matters of faith.67 Accordingly, he decided to write to Terentius in order to persuade him of Paulinus' mistakes and at the same time to recommend bishop Meletius to him, as "the man of God" and the one who should be the legitimate bishop of Antioch. Ep. 214 is a brief exposition of the trinitarian controversy meant to convince Terentius that Paulinus was on the Sabellian side. In the third section of Ep. 214, Basil reports that the Arians (perhaps the Eunomians) accuse him of having said that the Son is "consubstantial according to the bi6orxaat;" (Ep. 214,3.7). He denies it, because, in his view, this would lead to the affirmation that there is only one bi6oaoTatg (meaning "person" this time) in the Godhead, that is to Sabellianism. It is precisely against Sabellianism that Basil fought so fiercely, as we have seen. His argument about Sabellianism is identical to that in Ep. 210,5.34- 41, quoted above; so, I do not repeat it. Basil also rejects as dangerous Paulinus' formula, one substratum ('v xo i)xoKEctgevp) and three perfect per- sons (rpia itp6ooxca t eita), because the term np6oaoov was used before by Sabellius (Ep. 214,3.29 if.). Nevertheless, as A. de Halleux has remarked,68 Basil is very cautious when accusing Paulinus, because he knows that Terentius would show his epistle to the latter. Accordingly, he uses two levels of the discourse indicated by the verbs "to say" and "to confess."69 Basil's complete text reads: If then, among us70 also, some say (XyovTe;) overtly that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one in substratum ('?v T ) bnocetik?Vp), while at the same time confessing (6joXoyoievxg) three perfect persons (rpia npooawna rXetao), how do they not appear to offer clear and incontestable proof that the things said of us are true? (Ep. 214,3.29-33). Since cpoacotov was used by Sabellius (Ep. 214,3.14 if.), the conclusion that Basil tries to foist on Terentius is that Paulinus' formula camouflages intricate relations between East and West in the period from 371 to 377, see Fedwick, Church and Charisma 107-113 and Hanson, Search 797-802. 66 Hanson, Search 652. 67 See Ep. 216 (Courtonne 2.207-8) for a good introduction to Ep. 214. 68 A. de Halleux, "'Hypostase' et 'personne"' 326-328. 69 Ibid., 327. 70 "Among us" suggests the idea that Basil accepts Paulinus on the same anti-Arian side with him. 392</page><page sequence="20">PROSOPON AND HnPOSTASIS IN BASIL OF CAESAREA Sabellianism. Yet Paulinus' formula contained the adjective "perfect," which was meant to prevent any accusation of Sabellianism. As I showed in the analysis of Ep. 52,3.2, Basil himself admitted the phrase "perfect persons" (npoamona TOecta) as quite properly expressing the divine persons, although he eventually preferred the term in6oxraaot instead of Inp6aomov. So, his argumentation against Paulinus seems to have certain political connota- tions also, especially since Basil wanted Meletius on the episcopal chair of Antioch. Yet it would be a mistake to reduce Ep. 214 to a mere political manoeuvre. After 372 Basil had become increasingly aware that the for- mula !l a o6cia, Tpeit; inCoaTa6ae was the best protection against both Arian- ism and Sabellianism, as well as against Pneumatomachianism. Therefore, he encouraged its use at the expense of other formulas which might cause misinterpretations. In the next section, Basil explains to Terentius the difference between oaoia and inLc6oaaaot. He repeats the analogy between "the common" (T6 Kotv6v) and "the particular" (T6 'itov) presented extensively in Ep. 236,6 to Amphilochius of Iconium. Yet what is interesting here is the new argu- ment Basil mentions: "the brethren of the West" themselves recognize that oiaia and t)n6oxarot are not the same thing. In doing so, they acknowl- edge the insufficience of the Latin and simply transliterate the Greek term as usia (Ep. 236,4.1-5), instead of using its Latin equivalent substantia. Basil explains to Terentius the distinction between oaoia and nx6oxaact in order to make him understand that Paulinus should use xTooraioeat to refer to the divine persons. Moreover, Basil contends that it is not sufficient for Paulinus and his followers to recognize that the persons are in a true subsistence (?v i)nooTa'jet a&amp;i)a evalt &amp;aXl0iv); they should also "count" (Kai apt0jeit?oaav) or express this belief in numbers, so that both the consub- stantial and the three divine, perfect and complete, persons be proclaimed (Ep. 214,4.16-22).71 It is the same insistence encountered in his previous letters concerning the importance of three i)oooaoast;. Paulinus did not want to use "three {mooxatdoet," because he had stuck to the Nicene for- mula according to which owaia and i)6onTaotq were synonyms. In fact, as I proved, Basil tried to interpret the two terms in the Nicene creed as if they were not synonyms; but his interpretation was forced. 71 In explaining this passage, K. Holl simply adheres to the theory of the Jungniziansmus as exposed by Th. Zahn which has been discredited today (see Holl, Amphilochius von Ikonium 144 ff., and esp. 145, n. 1). 393</page><page sequence="21">LUCIAN TURCESCU When requesting that Paulinus and his followers "count" the irooxa- ae?t, Basil has in mind what has been recently termed as the concept of "enumeration of hypostases." According to him (Ep. 210,5.31-36),72 unlike their common substance, persons (inooxaoetS) are enumerative entities. But Basil insists that the divine persons have to be "enumerated piously" (eoeap?c aptOiliv) not materially and adds that divinity is above number.73 An Italian scholar, Marina Troiano, traces the concept of "enumeration of hypostases" back to Aristotle's Met. A,8,31-38.74 Conclusions To sum up, one can say that in his earlier writings Basil was not overtly concerned with the meanings of the terms nCp6oogov and bnooTxaot; for the faith. Yet, as he became increasingly involved in the doctrinal fights against various heretics and especially after being appointed a bishop, Basil felt responsible for the cultivation and preservation of the orthodox faith. In his early years he used 3p6ot7cov with the sense of "face," "mouth," "char- acter in a play," or even "person" in the largest sense as opposed to "thing" (tp&amp;y[ua). Later, he became aware that pcp6aocov was a term compromised by Sabellius when the latter used it with the meaning of "mask" devoid of any subsistence in regard to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. So, when using npooornov, Basil asked for its qualification with "perfect" or "existing in a true subsistence." Nevertheless, despite these qualifications, he strongly discouraged the use of ip6oocnov as a technical term to refer to the divine persons. Concerning i6o6xaot;, a development in its use can also be noted. In CEun it could mean "substance" (synonymous with ouoia), "subsistence," "substratum," or even "person." Later, Basil began to distinguish it from "substance" so much so as to force the interpretation in this direction of the Nicene anathema that condemned those who would discriminate between i'Ooxraot and ovaoia. A little later (ca. 375-6), besides the Nicaeanum, the confession of three persons and one substance in God became a touch- 72 Courtonne 2.195-6.
