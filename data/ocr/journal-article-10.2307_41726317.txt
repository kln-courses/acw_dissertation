<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Early Agricultural Site of Selevac, Yugoslavia by Ruth Tringham, Dušan Krstič, Timothy Kaiser and Barbara Voytek In hectare site a vast in Serbia - area the largest - covering an international known more Neolithic than team 80 hectare - the largest known Neolithic site in Serbia - an international team of ar- chaeologists has unearthed an unexpected abun- dance of artifacts. At first glance, the 750,000 potsherds, seeds, stones and bones may not seem impressive, but the sheer volume of these every- day finds is providing a fuller picture of prehis- toric life in southeast Europe than ever known before. The site lies in the Lower Morava Valley, long recognized as a cultural crossroads where the pre- and protohistoric societies of the Danube basin and eastern Mediterranean interacted. This region was inhabited during the late fifth and fourth millennia b.c. by a Late Neolithic so- ciety called the Vinca culture, which is divided into two halves: Vinča-Tordoš and Vinča- Pločnik. Selevat was occupied from 4300 to 3700 b.c. Now in its fifth year, the Selevac Archaeological Proj- ect - a collaborative effort between the National Museum of Beograd and the University of Cali- fornia at Berkeley (and until 1978, the Peabody Museum of Harvard) - has begun to analyze the culture development of this influential center. Selevac is located in the heart of Serbia's Šumadija region. Although it is only 26 kilome- ters south of the Morava-Danube confluence, the site is not part of the Morava floodplain but lies in the immediately adjacent highground of the Šumadija hills to the west. The prehistoric in- habitants of Selevac were within easy reach of an extremely important river junction, and also had access to rich forest resources, fertile soil, mineral outcrops and metalliferous ores. During the Vinča-Pločnik I period (4000-3700 b.c.), the Selevac settlement was a central location in the Vrbica River Valley which feeds into the Morava-Danube area. It typified the pattern of centralized settlement in the lower Morava basin, a pattern which reached its climax during the Late Neolithic period. As a rule, one major settlement usually developed in each valley. Attention was first drawn to the Selevac area by the extremely rich collection of artifacts that lay scattered on the ground surface - ceramics, figurines, burned house rubble, stone tools as well as other artifacts. Radomir Galovič, then of the National Museum of Beograd, along with representatives from the Smederevska Palanka Museum, conducted excavations at the site dur- ing three short seasons from 1968 to 1970 and again in 1973. They excavated nine (five by five 24 Archaeology</page><page sequence="2">meter) trenches called sondas, the Yugoslav term for a trench or any other unit of excavation. The settlement sits on a southward facing hill that gently slopes down to the Vrbica River. Houses and debris from the Neolithic occupation were discovered in a thick cultural layer whose enormous size is both significant and puzzling. Was the entire site inhabited simultaneously throughout the total period of occupation, or was there a more limited area of settlement which shifted over the years? During the settlement's existence, occupation probably did move from the bottom of the valley up the slope toward the top of the hills between the Vrbica and Konjska River Valleys. Today, the site is intensively cul- tivated in fairly small plots, making multi- hectare excavations impractical. Instead, smaller blocks of sondas were excavated systematically uphill and downhill from the earlier test trenches in order to expose a partial transect through the entire site. The location of sondas was determined partly by a magnetometer survey. The mag- netometer showed areas of magnetic anomaly which are indicative of the presence of large baked clay deposits near the surface - these were the remains of burned, collapsed houses. After collecting artifacts from the surface of the survey area, a total of four (four by four) meter sondas were opened up in 1976 above the area of initial excavation. A year later, three (four by four meter) sondas were exposed 100 meters further downhill. Ceramic analysis has shown that the material found downslope came from a typologi- cally earlier period than the artifacts collected in the uphill excavation areas. At present there are only two radiocarbon dates available. They date the middle depths of the downhill Sondas 16 and 18 to 4130 and 4170 b.c., respectively. During the final 1978 season, the 1977 excavation area was expanded to an area of 216 square meters. This allowed us to reveal more house structures and their associated features in an effort to gain the maximum amount of information about pre- historic Selevac. In many respects, the Selevac excavation repre- sents a successful synthesis of European and American archaeological approaches. Following the traditional European emphasis on regional chronologies, the careful investigation of horizon- tal and vertical stratigraphy was linked to the March/ April 1980 25</page><page sequence="3">(Right) Profile afone excavation unit or soné* showing the changing nature of cultural deposits from inteneive eupertmpoeiiion of t&amp;n tCtUTUl floors tO 0 CQfftjplçêG QÒ80HC6 ùf overlapping house floors during the lotet occupation of the site. Separating f these two main phases of occupation i» a thick aimost sterik taper of clayey soil which may mpremM the construction of a terrum* study of ceramic types. Regional chronologies (as studied through ceramics) are constructed by es- tablishing the sequence of changes in pottery styles which are found in the ceramic as- semblages of various sites within a particular area. It was important then that the Selevac ceramic sequence be accurately related to the site's stratigraphy, since prior to the Selevac Project no well developed chronology existed for the Late Neolithic period of the lower Morava region. Therefore, each four by four meter sonda was excavated in units two meters square and ten centimeters deep. Generally speaking, the materials recovered - in this case, ceramics - were grouped by these arbitrary levels, but whenever possible they were grouped in relation to a natural soil change or a feature such as a pit, house structure or hearth. When studied after the excavation, clear changes in the pottery could be seen through time, as measured by these level-units. An important aspect of the resulting ceramic typology is that it can then be used to link levels which otherwise have only a horizon- tal relationship. The ceramics used in the con- struction of the typological sequence are referred to as "diagnostic" since they have typologically identifiable rims, bases or decoration. At the same time, in keeping with the Amer- ican approach, bulk samples of "non-diagnostic" data from all artifact categories were collected in order to determine how resources were exploited and exchanged, and how the land was used. Pat- terns of economic production and consumption, demography and social organization may also be determined by analyzing bulk samples of data collected by sifting all materials through one- centimeter screens, and then through even finer wet-screening and flotation analysis. In this lat- ter process, the smallest particles of organic ma- terial are separated from the earth in a fluid bath; floating to the top, they are captured. These techniques permitted the collection of flo- ral and micro-faunal data, as well as stone tool debitage, tiny fragments of copper ore and other evidence which would help describe the subsis- tence, economic and social activities at Selevac. All of the cultural deposits come from a layer which measures between 2.5 and three meters thick and is composed of grayish-brown earth lying over loessic subsoil. Some strata, post holes and pits were only perceptible as very subtle changes in soil texture or as gradations in color. 26 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="4">In several cases, deep concentrations of cultural debris were the only indications of pits. Other strata consisted of the rubble of burned houses whose walls had collapsed. These cultural layers stayed firmly in place; there is evidence that very little debris or soil slipped downhill. As each layer was meticulously peeled away, the charac- teristics of this settlement began to emerge. At Selevac there was a fundamental division in the way cultural deposits were formed. First noticed in 1976, there is a marked change in the sediments at a depth of about 1.5 meters below the surface. The deposits above this general level have a higher sand content and are more loosely packed with little visible layering. The deposits below 1.5 meters are comprised of more compact brown earth stratified in thin layers. Discrete building levels could be seen in both upper and lower deposits. In the upper deposits, building levels were all characterized by the presence of fired wattle- and-daub rubble. Similar compact masses of burned clay remains of houses are well known from other Late Neolithic sites in Yugoslavia, such as Di voštin and Vinca. Two horizontally discrete layers of burned rubble were found dur- ing the 1976 season. They were separated by a depth of one meter; the uppermost layer repre- sents the latest house structure at Selevac, Further downhilj, even larger areas of slightly older burned house rubble were unearthed in 1977 in the upper levels of two other sondas. In 1978, when the area was enlarged, two more houses and parts of a third became visible. The houses at Selevac are rectangular in plan and measure at least eight by six meters. Clearly marked post holes can be distinguished. The floors were made of packed clay, placed over a wooden subfloor. In one particular house, the remains of three superimposed floors were un- covered. Surprisingly little evidence for hearths exists within the houses at Selevac. At many Vinca sites, such as Banjica, better preserved houses contain one or more hearths and ovens. But only one clearly identifiable hearth was dis- covered in one of the later house structures at Selevac, and what may possibly have been a hearth was found in another house. Isolated hearths unassociated with any house have also been found elsewhere on the site. Among the lower deposits - those below 1.5 meters - no burned house rubble areas were found. Instead, the remains of floor levels or at least definite land surfaces are comprised of thin, compact clayey layers. Very few structural re- mains survive from this period, but the cultural material is extremely well preserved. The ear- liest house' structure, a roughly rectangular pat- tern of post holes, was found just beneath a layer of carbonized grain. The post holes measure 30 centimeters in diameter and 30 centimeters deep; they penetrate the sterile, unstratified subsoil at approximately three meters below the surface. The differences between the building levels and stratigraphy of the upper and lower deposits lead us to suggest that the change in the nature of the cultural deposit formation reflects a change in the patterns of settlement and house replacement. In the early pattern, new houses were built directly on top of old ones, using their foundations, so that the deposits built up inten- sively in a series of compact layers. Later, this pattern changed and new houses were built on entirely new foundations with a complete hori- zontal displacement which extended deposition over a much wider area. This change coincides with the ceramic and economic changes as- sociated with the transition from the Vinča- Tordoš to the Vinča-Pločnik period. The two radiocarbon dates place this shift at a few de- cades later than 4130 b.c. at Selevac. It was dur- ing the later period that the houses were in- explicably burned down to the ground. Why or under what conditions did this happen? What caused the settlement to be abandoned? One of the most intriguing features at Selevac consists of two bedding trenches, each two meters deep, which were dug so that a row of closely-spaced posts could be placed in each trench. The impressions left by the decayed posts are over 1.5 meters deep and 20 centimeters wide, forming a double row. This feature dates from the later extensive period of occupation. The remains of what must have been a very sub- stantial structure, these bedding trenches and post holes were first thought to be the remains of a palisade. Now we hypothesize that the feature is the result of an attempt at terracing the slope in preparation for building the structure(s) repre- sented by the post holes and house rubble of the upper levels. The pottery found at Selevac provides the best examples of the Vinca ceramic typology from the lower Morava region. Both "fine" black- burnished wares decorated with channeling and incised lines and "coarse" wares that have neither slip finish nor decoration were discovered in great quantity. Many different vessel forms were produced, and some ten different combina- tions of clay and temper, or fabrics, were used in pottery production. One of these tempers, a talc formation called steatite, has unusual thermal properties and is quite rare in the Late Neolithic of southeast Europe. Many of the pottery forms and decorative motifs are comparable with Vinca culture sites from the Danube-Sava region to the northwest and from the upper Morava area to the south. Clay figurines of animals and humans also abound at Selevac, but most are broken. An- thropomorphic figurines vary in size from three to 30 centimeters in height. Some have mask- like faces with incised details characteristic of the Vinca iconography. Other less stylized figurines are unique to Selevac. The beautifully executed "face" lids are a typ- ical trait of the early Vinča-Pločnik period. These black-burnished vessel coverings look like faces, anthropomorphic or feline, and are decorated with incised lines. The most spectacular find within a house at Selevac was a small clay figurine discovered with over 30 perforated sea March/ April 1980 27</page><page sequence="5">snail shells, and a miniature perforated marble figurine. The clay figurine had incised features and was baked reddish-orange in a house fire. While these associated finds may have had a ritual or cult significance, the economic aspect is equally interesting. The marble may have come from the Black Sea; the two species of sea snails are also native to the Black Sea. The presence of imported materials indicates that Selevac partic- ipated in a wide exchange network. The early use of copper in southeast Europe is also attested to at Selevac by the presence of over 140 pieces of copper or copper ore. Most pieces are fragments of manufacture or reworked waste, but several finished beads have also been recovered. It is possible that multiple sources of copper ore are represented in the Selevac collec- tion. One source is probably Rudna Glava, where Borislav Jo vano vie of the Archaeological Insti- tute of Beograd excavated a Vinca mining site in the mountains to the southeast. The stone artifacts found at Selevac reflect extensive exploitation of lithic resources. Many of the raw materials used are not local. Andesite, which was used for some of the grindstones, may come from sources 20 to 35 kilometers away or possibly even from Rudna Glava, about 100 kilometers to the southeast. The obsidian flakes and blades at Selevac probably come from sources in Hungary or Transylvania. The lithic collection includes chipped stone artifacts of chert, chalcedony and jasper as well as obsidian. Fine-grained, bedded cherts were used, along with coarser, more granular pebble flint. The lat- ter materials, which are not easily worked, were often heated to facilitate the manufacture of flakes and blades. Such a technique suggests that the manipulation of the raw materials was a carefully controlled process. Manufacturing de- bris as well as exhausted cores also provide in- formation about lithic tool production at Selevac. The large quantity of these remains reflects a high rate of production. This production was matched by immediate use and discard of the flakes and blades which show little evidence for maintenance or curation, for resharpening or reuse. Microscopic examina- tion of tool edges has been invaluable in provid- ing such data on tool use. This analysis also shows that composite tools were an important part of the Selevac industry. A composite tool is made from a single handle or haft into which a number of flakes or blades have been fitted. When one or more of the stone inserts becomes dull or broken, it is replaced by others, all simi- lar in dimensions. Perhaps the most notable composite tool at Selevac is the "sickle," repre- sented by the many blades having a polish or sheen along the working edge or edges. This polish is considered the result of the stone hav- ing been in contact with some type of silica- containing plant material. In addition to chipped stone implements, there are numerous polished stone implements including adzes, axes and chisels. The majority are made of limestone or silicified siltstone, the source of which is still un- known. Unlike the chipped stone industry where there is a high rate of discard and replacement of individual pieces, the polished stone implements show much resharpening and reuse. Grindstones, grinders, whetstones and hammerstones also provide data on lithic resource exploitation at Selevac. Like many Late Neolithic sites in southeast Europe, the inhabitants of Selevac also used a great variety of bone tools made from a range of bone and antler. Several hundred bone tools or pieces of worked bone were excavated, including awls, needles, flakers, burnishers, hooks, and more fanciful pieces. Red deer antler was an important raw material in the manufac- ture of handles and axes. Faunal and micro-faunal data are also very well preserved at the site. A.J. Legge of the Uni- versity of London has noted an overwhelming predominance of domesticated animals among the bones, especially cattle and pig, although some wild sheep and goat occur. There are large bones, presumably wild cattle and pigs, which are remarkably big even for the wild species. A number of wild animal bones, including red deer antler and a part of a bear's skull, were concen- trated in an area in which a large number of flakes and chert debitage had been found. The floral materials are being analyzed by Richard Hubbard and Frances McClaren of the Institute of Archaeology in London. They specu- late that the agricultural economy at Selevac was dominated by the cultivation of wheats - emmer wheat predominates slightly over ein- korn. The pulse or legume crops were compara- tively rare. Surprisingly, there is an almost com- plete absence of barley grains at the site, only two fragments having been identified so far. So- called wild plants were also found in the Selevac plant material, such as seeds of cornelian cherry, elderberry, gooseberry, apples and hazel nuts. But none of these is remarkable for the presum- ably mixed oak forest which surrounded Selevac. Although no palynological study of the Selevac site or region has yet been carried out, it is worth noting that almost all of the wood recovered at Selevac in carbonized or non- carbonized form is oak. Presumably oak was the main material used for construction. I^/ecent research into the earliest agricultural settlements in the Balkans does not upset the main theses of V. Gordon Childe, the first syn- thesizer of east European prehistory, who main- tained that the chief attributes of the Agricul- tural Revolution were not developed within Europe, but rather were introduced from the Near East. However, some archaeologists chal- lenge Childe's model of subsequent changes and innovation in Europe. His suggestion that the development of copper metallurgy and the grow- ing socioeconomic complexity were the results of a process of diffusion from the Near East is pres- ently being questioned. The Neolithic site of Selevac is pointing to evidence in favor of an al- ternate hypothesis, namely, that the changes made after the introduction of food production 28 Archaeology</page><page sequence="6">(Above) Face lid from Selevac, one of the finest examples of Vinta culture artistry.

Population growth and ex- pansion did not occur immediately and was not a steady, continuing product of the food-producing subsistence strategy. Rather, growth came in spurts. Numerous interrelated factors caused the population spurt in about 4000 b.c., including (a) increased communication all over Europe and be- tween Europe and the Near East, reflecting the institutionalization of regular exchanges of re- sources, commodities, services and ideas; (b) population growth, a result and cause of produc- tion intensification, both involving increased security of food resources and sedentism; (c) in- tensification of food and commodity production via a variety of strategies; and (d) competition, alienation and inequality in access to resources. These investigations of the rise and fall of proto- urban societies in southeast Europe form the theoretical background for the Selevac exca- vations. It has been argued that the entire 80- hectare area of the site was occupied simulta- neously and that Selevac was therefore a verita- ble urban settlement. Now, however, it appears that there was, in fact, considerable horizontal movement on the site throughout the course of its existence. During the Late Neolithic period, settlement became increasingly centralized, both at Selevac and throughout southeast Europe in general. Large, centralized settlements clearly necessitated the complex use and redistribution of resources as well as the intensification of food production. The evidence from Selevac shows that it was a central place in the Vrbica Valley when food-producing first became a successful and productive system, and the exploitation of resources began to expand. The inhabitants of Selevac were dynamic participants in a number of wide-ranging networks. In this way, diverse mineral resources such as copper, obsidian and cryptocrystalline rocks were exchanged; a wide variety of local resources was exploited; and in- formation and ideas flowed along with trade goods among settlements of the Vinca culture. Despite many similarities in the material cul- ture of Late Neolithic sites in southeast Europe, however, the pattern of settlement varies greatly. In eastern Yugoslavia, for example, dispersed 30 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="8">March/ April 1980 31</page><page sequence="9">(Top) Clay figurine in situ in the exterior of a burned house.

Height, approximately six centimeters. settlements - similar to late Selevac or Banjica where successive building levels barely overlap and cover extensive areas - coexisted with more intensive "tell" settlements such as Vinča and Gomolava. There, a more restricted habitation area is evidenced by the deep vertical stacking of building levels with little horizontal spread. Apparently, Selevac was unique in that both in- tensive and extensive patterns are found here, the former preceding the latter. This variation is clearly associated with economic and social factors*- the relationship between the main set- tlement area and the field or pasture lands; how houses were reconstructed after their collapse; the duration of the settlement; and the system of land tenure. However these factors balanced, most Vinča-Pločnik settlements were apparently stable systems during the fourth millennium b.c. Yet why was Selevac abandoned around 3700 b.c.? It will take time for the whole picture of prehistoric Europe to unfold as excavations con- tinue to discover the answers to specific ques- tions. The vast site of Selevac will no doubt be- come the key for understanding life in the Morava Valley during Neolithic times.
