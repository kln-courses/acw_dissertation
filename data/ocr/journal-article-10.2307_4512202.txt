More concern is thus expressed for photographing wildlife than for the well-being of the wildlife. Bert Harwell suggests, relative to the Pygmy Owl, that owls are supposed to conform to some anthropomorphic moral code in their struggle for life. "From a human viewpoint one of their methods of obtaining food is not strictly according to Hoyle, for on several occasions they have been seen to drag fledgling Downy Woodpeckers and Sapsuckers from their nesting cavities. Unfortunately it takes only one or two observations of nest robbing to create such descriptions as fiend, villain, rapacious, bloodthirsty, but actually this little owl usually follows accepted rules of hunting." There are some puzzling statements, e.g., " Courtship for most birds usually precedes the nesting season." The author apparently meant that the nesting season, and hence the courtship period, is restricted to a single season of the year. There are also erroneous statements. The picture caption for the Barn Owl on page 14 identifies a white-footed mouse in the beak of the owl as a meadow mouse. On pages 61 and 62 the author suggests that "polar bears, ptarmigan, fox and last but not least the Snowy Owl, are dedicated northerners completely disdaining a change from winter white." This is not true for the ptarmigan and arctic fox do undergo plumage and pelage changes to a more somber summer garb. On page 170, 13 skulls of Redpolls are reported coming "from the crop of a single Great Gray [Owl]". Although hawks possess a well defined crop it is lacking in owls. In page 231, the author uncertainly points out that the reversed sexual dimorphism found in most of the hawks and owls is found in all species, apparently unaware that Earhart and Johnson (Condor, 72: 251-264, 1970) had shown that the male Burrowing Owl is larger that the female. Lastly, on page 199 the author points out that the Short-eared Owl differs from most ground nesting birds in that it does not lay an excessive number of eggs, which leads to an expendable surplus of young. It is stated that since the average clutch size is " only five or six eggs" and they are presumably only single brooded "something about the bird or its manner of life sets it apart and makes it successful." That something is mobility and a flexible fecundity in response to food availability. Clutch sizes of up to 14 have been reported for this species. Mechanically the book is relatively free from errors. There are a few typo- graphical errors, and the page reference to an "accompanying photo series" of Burrowing Owls is made on page 247 (no page number cited) while the photos are on page 124, leaving the reader to search. Although there is much factual information presented in a readable way with many fine pictures I find a major shortcoming of this book is that it fails to put owls in their proper place ecologically speaking.-Richard J. Clark. 53. To Save a Bird in Peril. D. R. Zimmerman. 1975. New York, Coward, McCann &amp; Geoghegan. 286 p. $9.95.-The author presents a variety of current conservation programs for endangered birds. The book's concern is "clinical ornithology"-the crisis oriented intervention into the life cycle or environment of a threatened bird to enhance populations and prevent extinction. Interestingly, most of the therapeutic techniques are quite recent and very much experimental. The literary format of the book can be well described with brief comments on a few of the chapters, each of which considers one or more endangered species. In the pages on peregrines, Zimmerman reflects on "peregrine politics" and the conflicts of falconry with conservation. The report on the northeast Osprey program is presented as a personal success story for Paul Spitzer. Whooping Crane research at Patuxent reveals the struggles for results of scientists working in a "glass house" of publicity. In Hawaii, the Nene Goose causes discussion of the high costs of conservation programs-how much are we willing to spend on a decreasing species? The remaining chapters include the Cahow, Kirtland's Warbler, California Condor, Saddlebacks of New Zealand, and vultures and eagles of Europe. The author is a professional writer, whose literary style presents each con- servation effort in a dramatic tone. Often conservationists are portrayed as heros (with occasional villains). I know four main " actors" of the book and have heard some of their concern for this emphasis on personalities in the book. Zimmerman also criticizes professional ornithologists for their lack of interest</page><page sequence="2">94] Recent Literatqxre Bird-Banding or contributions in the endangered species dramas, although clearly more than one half of the conservationists he mentions have livelihoods in biology. As a non-ornithologist, the author has done fairly well in gathering the essential facts of each program and has carefully presented critical ideas (such as the importance of the "genetic pool") in an easily read text. Some readers will find his anecdotes distracting, but most will appreciate the honest presentation of real-world suc- cesses and bureaucratic failures. This layman's book is exciting and informative for anyone. An epilogue presents noteworthy late developments in the endangered species programs. Charles F. Leck. 54. Watching Birds. J. Fisher and J. Flegg. 1974. Berkhamsted (Eng- land), T. &amp; A. D. Poyser. 159 p. illus. Â£2.80. Jim Flegg has undertaken to revise the late James Fisher's"Watching Birds," which first appeared in 1940. The present book is an elementary introduction to bird watching English style; that is, serious bird watching. The opening chapters introduce the reader to the bird's external and internal anatomy, the classification of birds, and the tools of bird watching binoculars, cameras, books, field clothing, notebooks and so on. There follow chapters on migration, habitats, numbers of birds cryptic coloration and aggression, how birds recognize one another, a chapter including territoriality, courtship, and the breeding cycle, and a final chapter on "what you can do" (join a bird or conservation organization). Fisher and Flegg provide a readable and informative general introduction to the study of living birds. The book is nicely produced. The figures, including some drawings by James Fisher's son, Crispin, and photographs are useful and illustrative. There are few typographical errors. Perhaps the best chapter is "the number of birds." It certainly is the longest which reflects the authors' and the British bird watchers' interest in numbers- from world populations to the size of local breeding populations and more importantly population trends. Flegg presents some results from the Common Birds Census, organized by the British Trust for Ornithology around 1961. The examples may have been selected for effect rather than for being typical because species are either increasing or decreasing throughout the decade or they are fluctuating greatly from one year to the next. Armchair population ecologists should look at these data. Mostly, though, the discussion is too general. The chapter on migration dismisses navigation theories as "too complex to be discussed here," but surely mention could have been made that some ornithologists believe that birds use the sun, or stars, or even the magnetic field of the earth, and surely a brief de- scription of the techniques of studying migration and navigation could have been included, without getting into the difficulties of evaluating the results. Too much space (over five pages) is used in describing the territorial behavior of a pair of fictional "standard" birds, and not enough space is devoted to the diversity of territorial behavior as can be observed easily These errors of omission are of course, matters of Judgment and personal taste. Nevertheless, I think the beginner who can handle the material already included in this book can easily handle more sophisticated treatment. At least there are few errors of commission. I'll mention one dreadful example with the hope that a future printing will correct it. That is a comparison of species oc- cupying American, European, and British coniferous forests. The White-winged Crossbill but not the Red Crossbill is listed for American forests, whereas the ecological representative in Britain is the Scottish Crossbill ( a race of the Red) and representatives in Europe are the Continental Crossbill (another race of the Red) and Parrot Crossbill (often considered a race of the Red). The American representative of the British and European Golderest and Firecrest is the Kinglet. Our representative of the Continental Crested Tit and the Scottish Crested Tit is the Chickadee. The table continues with Wood Grouse, Siskins (sic), and Spotted Woodpeckers inhabiting American forests. Finally, considering the general treatment of topics in this introductory book, a bibliography directing the "turned-on" reader to other sources of in- formation would seem to be desirable But never mind the negative criticism if you are looking for a readable informative, general book surveying the biology of living birds to offer to be- ginners of almost any age. This is certainly a good one. Bertram G. Murray, Jr.</page></plain_text>
