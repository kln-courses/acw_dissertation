<plain_text><page sequence="1">If You Don't Mind My Saying So&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH I don't suppose many people today read that late eighteenth-century "must," Bishop William Paley's Natural Theology. I never expected to and I haven't really read it. But I did have occasion to take it down from a library shelf and discover that it begins with the once unanswerable "argument from design" and presents it on the very first page via the classic watch-and-watchmaker routine. A watch is too intricate and pur- poseful to have merely happened. But the world - especially the world of living things - is far more intricate and more elaborately adapted to its needs. If the presence of a watch implies a watchmaker, how much more inevitably does a world imply a world- maker? How the Bishop got from this to the thirty-nine articles or whether, indeed, he attempted to do so, I do not know. But the argument for some sort of theism must have seemed irrefutable and it is sufficient to ex- plain why few of even the hardiest skeptics then believed less than what Deism pro- claimed. Lucretius's chance meeting of atoms was simply too far-fetched even for those "who could believe anything provided only it was not in the Bible." Bishop Paley's contemporary, Lord Mon- boddo, was already insisting that the orang- utan was a close relative of man and an- other contemporary, Erasmus Darwin, was already proclaiming: "The Great Creator of All Things has infinitely developed the works of his hands, but has at the same time stamped a certain similitude on the features of nature that demonstrates to us, that the whole is one family of one parent." But although such hardy speculations might encourage certain doubts about the Garden of Eden they left untouched the argument for theism based on the watch and the watchmaker. The last of the eight lavishly endowed Bridgewater Treatises on "The Goodness of God as manifested in the Creation," ap- peared in 1840 or less than twenty years be- fore Charles Darwin was supposed to have knocked the props from under that and all similar enterprises, making "the argu- ment from design" as irrelevant as Ptolemaic astronomy. What Darwin was undertaking to prove was nothing less than simply this: A watch cannot make itself but, given time enough, organisms have performed a similar although far more astonishing feat. He made complete atheism seem for the first time a tenable creed. Add natural selection to Lucretius's chance en- counter of atoms and you had something that could, in a pinch at least, be believed. Although there were always a few, even within the ranks of official science who re- mained just outside the new orthodoxy (Alfred RÃ¼ssel Wallace himself was one), the overwhelming majority of competent scientific men merely shrugged them off as victims of an absurd residue of irrationality and took it as proved beyond dispute that the living world did indeed "just happen." Even the Deists' vague deity tended to vanish because there seemed no function left for him to perform and with him went the whole of the somewhat distantly related concept of Purpose. Evolution, so it was said, had a tendency toward greater elaboration. The fish tended to become the philosopher. But nothing m tended anything. 275</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR I have read a good deal of popular and semi popular natural history and biology and I think it clear that a certain vague dis- satisfaction with the complete and all-in- clusive explaining away of the wonders of the living watch is commoner in respectable quarters today than it was even a generation ago. The clear demonstration of what na- tural selection can do, apparently all by it- self, involves rather simple things like pro- tective coloration. It is a long way from them to any one of the hundreds of all but incredible organs, instincts and behavior patterns and there seems to be an increasing tendency to doubt modestly and in a largely negative fashion that the whole process really is understood. Those who share these modest doubts are often accused of mere wishful thinking, of merely wanting to find some hint of an es- cape from the blind, purposeless and mean- ingless universe of strict Darwinism. Per- haps I share that wish but I do not believe it is the only reason why I often find myself thinking of the problem or why that think- ing has led me to the conclusion that the whole phenomenon of evolution becomes easier to credit if the process is assumed to have involved certain forces the reality of which there is far more reason (on the basis of evidence) to believe in than to reject. These processes involve that concept of Purpose (or intention) which, so it seems to me, is so often rejected out of hand because it actually is not clearly defined. There is (to put it more modishly although not necessarily more clearly) a semantic con- fusion. To say that Purpose may have been involved in the process of evolution may be to say any one of at least three quite differ- ent things. The first, oldest and most common mean- ing of such a statement implies a transcen- dental power, usually personal, which is outside of and beyond everything else that exists and which directs the universe it created. This is quite precisely the watch- maker and the watch he made. A second possible meaning implies immanence rather than transcendence. The purpose assumed to exist is not outside of but inherent in the natural world; is indeed a natural, primor- dial part of it which has existed as long as anything has existed and is simply part of things as they are. In a sense the watch still makes itself but not so mechanically or so blindly as strict Darwinism implies. The first of these hypotheses is the one that or- thodox science most vehemently repudiates and it is only slightly more tolerant of the second which it is likely to regard as little more than a second line of defense desper- ately constructed by a rear guard attempt- ing to cover the rout of the superstitious before the advancing army of rationalism. There is, however, a third possible sense in which Purpose may have played a part in evolution and it is one that seems to me to have been largely overlooked despite the fact that even the most mechanical theories of evolution would seem to suggest it. That man himself is capable of purpose in the simplest sense of the word, that he can, that is to say, adopt a means toward an end, is certainly not doubted by anyone who is not - as most orthodox evolutionists are not - wholly committed to the narrowest possible interpretation of a kind of dialectic materi- alism. But if man, who is himself an animal, is capable of effective intentions, why should one suppose that this is something entirely new in the universe rather than that it has always been to some extent, however slight, characteristic of living things? Take the case of the tool that illustrates concretely the simplest form of purposeful- ness. It is true that there does not seem to be any exception to the oft-repeated statement that man is the only animal who makes tools. But other animals do use those that they find ready-made. Many of the primates use natural objects as instruments or weapons and tool-using is demonstrable much lower in the hierarchy, as in the two notable cases of the wasp that uses a pebble to tamp down the earth over the concealed opening of its nesting burrow and the comic pseudo- woodpecker (actually a finch) that digs in- sects from bark crevices with a twig just because, for some unknown reason, natural selection failed to provide him with the long slender bill characteristic of the true wood- peckers. 276</page><page sequence="3">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR One may readily grant that the step from tool-using to toolmaking is a very important one. But is there any reason for supposing that there is an absolute discontinuity be- tween the processes involved? In both cases a means to an end is adopted and there seems to be no reason for the categorical statement that purposefulness in the simple sense of an effective intention exists in the case of one and not in the other. Yes, reply the stubborn, there is a reason. Tool-using arose as the result of random mo- tions and the survival value of certain chance discoveries enabled natural selection to pick them out and to fix them as in- stincts. But again one must ask is there any compelling reason why this should be cate- gorically asserted? Mere trial and error plays a certain part even in the new inventions of the most advanced technology and no doubt played a larger one in the earliest stages of man's tool-making. Does not the whole con- cept of evolution incline one to the assump- tion that intention has played an increas- ingly important role rather than that it appeared suddenly in a world where every- thing else was evolving from simpler forms as the result of purely mechanical processes? The difference between the degree of inten- tion that existed in the wasp or the finch may be as great as the difference between their brain and the human brain. But the one was nevertheless evolved from the other. To me it seems exceedingly odd (and exceedingly inconsistent) that the more dog- matic the evolutionist the more strongly he insists upon the absolute uniqueness of man's mind while, at the same time, he in- dignantly rejects Alfred Wallace's stubborn insistence that this very uniqueness dis- proves the theory that the mind has been mechanically evolved from the mind of one of the lower animals. Only man, so ortho- dox evolution has often insisted, can reason in a sense utterly different from any mental process other animals are capable of; only he can have intentions. To attribute any of these things to any lower animal is to be guilty of "anthropomorphism." But if all higher things have evolved from simpler ones, then how on earth would man have evolved from these lower animals unless they were in some sense anthropomorphic? "Evolution" and "discontinuity" are anti- thetical notions and I cannot explain the passion with which they have been simul- taneously asserted except on the assumption that some "wishful thinking" is involved. A theory as revolutionary as Darwin's needs, if it is to be accepted, statement in the simplest and most absolute form possible. If the great role played by natural selection was to be recognized it had to be explained with the fewest possible complications. Admit Pur- pose at all and the need for any such theory as Darwin's would have been much less obvious. The watch and watchmaker theory would have been much less easy to rout. But the theory of evolution, in a very broad and very inclusive sense, is no longer in danger of rejection nor is anyone likely to doubt the importance of the role played by natural selection. On the other hand, many of the difficulties that still rise (in- creasingly, I believe) in the minds of thoughtful people vanish if one admits no more than the, to me, very reasonable sup- position that something, no more perhaps than the slight advantage bestowed by pur- posefulness in the simple sense of effective intention, be admitted, no matter to how slight a degree. Those who reject it categori- cally are not winning support for what is essential in the theory of evolution but raising doubts about it. If anything could revive the watch and watchmaker analogy it would be the belief that man is unique in possessing not merely reason but even the ability to intend. If he transcends all other animals then what can he be except a spe- cial creation? If intention is a discontinuous phenomenon then where does evolution come in? To reject it seems to me to put one right into the hands of the transcen- dentalist so far as man is concerned. Much has been made in recent years of abstruse mathematical calculations intended to prove that natural selection will, in the long run, perpetuate a variation that has even a very slight survival value. But surely an equally slight push by an intention would be even more effective and I simply cannot see why if enormous intelligence is 278</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR assumed in the case of man descended from the lower animal it is not reasonable rather than unreasonable to assume the possibility that such a push exists. Evi- dence against such an assumption is purely negative. "We cannot find it and don't know how we could demonstrate it," reply the mechanists; but that is a practical difficulty not a disproof and I suspect that the real reason for the dogmatic assertion that it does not exist is simply the result of a reluctance to admit that what would be hard to investigate may, nevertheless, be worth considering. T. H. Huxley himself once wrote: "The materialistic position ... is as utterly devoid of justification as the most baseless of theo- logical dogmas But with a view to the progress of science, the materialistic termi- nology is in every way preferable." For the time being he was certainly right. But unless you take the position that what is most fruitful pro tern is eternally true this is not conclusive. Newtonian physics was certainly fruitful but the time came when some parts of it had to be abandoned if further truths were to be established. No doubt the fact that some of the most re- markable examples of what seemed to our ancestors proof of "design" occur among plants and among the very primitive animal organisms where the push if it existed at all must have been very slight. But there is no conclusive argument against the assump- tion that it existed from the beginning and increased slowly as time went on rather than that it emerged discontinuously at the moment when a primate became a man. Two twentieth-century scientists of un- questioned technical competence - Lecomte du NoÃ¼y and Teilhard de Chardin - explicitly reject purely mechanistic inter- pretations of evolution. If you dismiss them as merely victims of a religious and mystical quirk in their otherwise first-rate scientific minds there are others more cautious who admit doubts or at least confessions of ig- norance. Jean Rostand, one of the greatest living French biologists, dismisses Lecomte du NoÃ¼y almost contemptuously but he nevertheless says flatly: "In my opinion we know practically nothing about the factors that determine the progressive diversifica- tion of living creatures." And that is a long way from the cocksureness of many neo- Darwinians. Sir Julian Huxley, as cautious a scientist as one could find, is orthodox enough when he writes that "natural selec- tion converts accidents into apparent de- sign." On the other hand, he admits in evo- lution a "desirable trend" toward "the higher" (not merely the more complex) and although he warns that "we have no right to regard this trend as embodying a cosmic purpose or a Divine Intention" he goes on to say that "If we take the monistic or unitary naturalistic view demanded by evo- lutionary logic, matter and mind cease to appear as separate entities; they are seen as two necessary attributes or aspects of the single universal world stuff." And to me, at least, this seems to suggest that mind might be operable on a very low level. Loren Eiseley goes further: "If 'dead' matter has reared up this curious landscape of fiddling crickets, song sparrows, and wondering men, it must be plain even to the most devoted materialist that the matter of which he speaks contains amazing, if not dreadful powers, and may not impossibly be, as Hardy has suggested, 'but one mask of many worn by the Great Face behind.' " In quoting from these eminent authorities I do not mean to suggest that they would necessarily be sympathetic to all, or perhaps to any, of the notions I have been trying to put into words. But they do, so it seems to me, suggest that not all competent scientists believe the last word has been said on the question. 280</page></plain_text>
