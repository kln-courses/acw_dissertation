<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS Greek Philosophy before Plato. By ROBERT SCOON. Princeton Princeton University Press, 1928.-pp. viii, 353. The work of Burnet in this field is so judicious, so penetrating, and so inclusive, that, on seeing a new "Greek Philosophy" issuing from an academic press, one's first question is, inevitably, What can possibly justify this publication? How can these three hundred and fifty-three pages be anything more than needless repetitions of work already done? To this question the author gives no direct reply. His preface merely refers to the approval of teachers and relatives, encouraging his expansion of a (doubtless excellent) doctoral dissertation. But an examination of the body of the work enables the critic to select and emphasize certain points which perhaps justify the encouragement which the author has received. An important possible standpoint is (comparatively) neglected by Burnet, a standpoint designated as "historical". If history is to be regarded as fundamentally continu- ous, the historian's task may consist largely in establishing the links and influences which underlie the different systems. The result of applying this method strictly is to change the whole appearance of what is traditionally presented as "Greek Philosophy". The indi- viduality and sharp outlines of Burnet's portraits disappear, and their place is taken by a kaleidoscopic texture of motifs which are only partially philosophical, and have an evolution only partially affected by the attempts of a Heraclitus or a Parmenides at carrying through a definitive synthesis of these motifs. Given a disposition towards synthesis, at projecting an imaginary world-picture on the basis of organized human experience, what are some of the chief motifs? First and foremost, we have the animistic projection which gives us anthropomorphic religion, the poetical creation of a Homer or a Hesiod, peopling the world with capricious, all-too-human divinities. Another motif is the social institution of law, which-when universalized in turn as an element in the synthe- sizing projection-proves inconsistent with divine caprice. The economic motif of intelligence as the only tolerable directive force, the rhetorician's technique of persuasion by means of interimplicative propositions divorced from correspondence with empirical facts, the 258</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 259 musician's technique of harmony, the mathematician's technique- all these furnish motifs which, according as one or the other dominates in the synthetic tissue, give rise to religion, politics, industry, art, science, or philosophy. All of these motifs are human and pragmatic, and all are so interwoven that to neglect any one or two of them is to fail to understand religion, or science, or philosophy. Philosophy has, in fact, no autonomous continuity, and its 'history' represents a succession of syntheses whose continuity is with the general texture of motifs, and cannot be explained by reference to logical considera- tions alone. Let us consider how that new thing, 'philosophy', originated. Greek social experience had developed the institution of law as a way of readjusting the social balance after a period of disorder. The extension of this concept to natural phenomena gave rise to science, and the resulting synthesis substituted this new field of law, i.e., the world studied by science, as an object of serious respect, in place of the capricious fictions of poetical theologians. Emotional contem- plation of starry orbits became substituted for the exciting dances of the popular Mysteries, as a means of soul-purification, and the new 'philosophy' was thus the substitution of a quasi-scientific for a merely poetical Weltanschauung, as a source of vital experiences. Against this background, the well-known figures of Greek philosophy assume unusual shapes. Parmenides as the incarnation of the rhetorician's technique, Pythagoras as a primitive cosmologist whose "one ", identified with "the original mass of fire ", is split up by successive inhalations of air or void, Empedocles as identifying his "sphere" with both Love and Cosmic Mind, Atomism as a primarily logical reaction to Eleaticism-these, and many other pictures drawn by our author, are novel, and would have seemed novel even to Aristotle. On the other hand, the Sophistic movement is treated in a way which would be considered, in spite of the neatness of the author's phrasings, conventional, and the significance of Socrates receives a coloring admittedly Burnettian. Like many writers on Greek philosophy, our author contends that we should read as few as possible of our modern -isms into the early writers, and should put ourselves into the position (say) of Plato. But (also like most other writers) our author finds himself, in practice, using words like 'idealism', 'humanism', 'pluralistic materialism', etc. etc., much the same as the rest of us. And as to "the position of Plato", if the author would kindly make definite just what he under- stands by this, we might be in a position to judge the value of his suggestion that we adopt some such position.</page><page sequence="3">260 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXVIII. One flat inconsistency springs out from the smooth phrasing. "Thought" (for Empedocles), "the meeting of likes" (p. 92), is identified with Love which elsewhere "mixes unlikes" (p. 87). That which mixes likes, and that which mixes unlikes, cannot possibly be identified, and with this impossibility falls the central prop of one of our author's most ingenious interpretations. There is also (as with most writers in this field) a little ex cathedra dogmatising. The author is not at his best when declaring that "in his opinion" the fragments attributed to Philolaus are "undoubtedly genuine ". The reader will find them, as translated in an appendix, providing, on the face of them, proof after proof of Erich Frank's contention-ignored by our author-that they are late (academic) theorisings published under a literary pseudonym in accordance with the prevailing literary fashion. The original elements in the new Greek Philosophy before Plato have been sufficiently indicated. There is undoubted plausibility in the position assumed by our author. It is, however, a position which, if it is to be convincing, requires greater thoroughness, greater vigor, and greater erudition, than our author appears to have at his command. As written, much of his book has the value which is usually attributed to the essay-form of composition: it is interesting, suggestive, frequently plausible. But in the present age of scholarly thoroughness, much of the book will be thought inadequate. It will be conceded without question that every page makes pleasant reading. But, when compared with the work of Burnet-it is unfortunate for our author that this comparison is inevitable-, it must be admitted without reserve that the new book is not so judicious, not so pene- trating, and not so inclusive.
