<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jacob Haberman. Maimonides andAquinas: A Contemporary Appraisal. New York: Ktav Publishing House, Inc., 1979. Pp. xx, 289. This is an unusual book. In small part, it is an analysis of some central views of Maimonides and Aquinas; its primary pur- pose, however, is to attack those views from the perspective of contemporary philosophy and to affirm the author's own religious posi- tion, which is a sort of enlightened fideism expressing itself in an atypical form of Or- thodox Judaism. Haberman displays impressive erudition in both medieval and modern philosophy as well as in Jewish studies generally, and his oc- casionally flippant style, for which he play- fully apologizes in the introduction, injects a lighter tone that enhances the book's read- ability. Organization is not one of Haber- man's strong points, and many of the jokes, anecdotes, and quotations (as well as foot- notes and appendices) are inappropriate by strict standards of relevance; only an ingrate, however, would object to being told about the sign at the Milan parade which read, "God bless the Holy Trinity," or about Ber- trand Russell's irreverent definition of tran- substantiation. ("The Roman Catholic Church holds that a priest can turn a piece of bread into the Body and Blood of Chirst by talking Latin to it.") Nevertheless, Haberman does not avoid all the pitfalls of such a tone, and his exaggerated protestations of humility ("If in my ignorance and stupidity I have pre- sumed. .. ." [p. xv, and cf. p. 220n. 46]) do not sit well with his vehement and sometimes nasty denunciations of both medieval and modern authorities. A short appendix, for example, is devoted to a vitriolic attack- with little substantive discussion-directed against Julius Guttmann, who hardly de- serves to be described as the possessor of an "effeminate, thin, and acidulous" mind. Even to one who is not in the vanguard of the feminist movement, "effeminate mind" is rather jarring. Fundamentally, the book is sharp, in- sightful, occasionally brilliant, but at crucial points the argument deteriorates and leaves the reader bewildered. Since Haberman plans to attack Maimonides' defense of creation ex nihilo in one of the book's major chapters, he recognizes the need to consider the position that the defense is insincere and that criticism of it is consequently misplaced. An early chapter on "the Maimonidean synthesis" is therefore devoted in large part to a discussion of Maimonidean esotericism, but Haber- man's treatment of the issue both here and later in the book is so problematic that this reader considered half-seriously the possibili- ty that he was emulating Maimonides' use of purposeful, obfuscatory contradiction. The chapter begins with a quotation from an early article by Wolfson asserting that</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 175 Maimonides was a "true medieval Aris- totelian" who used "the Jewish religion as an illustration of the Stagirite's metaphysical supremacy." In the text, Haberman rejects this view and argues on the basis of Maimonides' famous letter to Jonathan of Lunel that "philosophy was auxiliary to the Law in the synthesis that Maimonides at- tempted to achieve." In his note, however, Haberman indicates that Wolfson may have changed his mind in Philo and agreed in part that "Maimonides considered philosophy as ancillary ... to Scripture"; the note then goes on to criticize Wolfson for this view and to affirm the position attributed to Wolfson in the text. In short, the text critizes Wolfson for agreeing with the note, and the note criticizes him for agreeing with the text. What Haberman himself thinks remains obscure and is not clarified much by a brief appendix called "Rambam or Maimonides" which con- centrates specifically on the impact of Maimonides' philosophy on his halakhic views. Now to the issue of esotericism. Haberman rejects the view that Maimonides "was writing with tongue in cheek" and that he "set out deliberately to deceive"; one should give him "the benefit of the doubt" and assume his sincerity unless "the ordinary canons of literary criticism" require the assumption that he is dissembling for the purpose of streng- thening the belief of the masses in socially useful myths. The only example of such dissembling cited at this point is the Treatise on the Resurrection, which allegedly differs "so radically" from views expressed by Maimonides elsewhere that "it must be con- sidered in a class apart." It certainly does not appear from this discussion that Haberman would consider a stray contradiction as ade- quate evidence of insincerity; the human mind, he claims, is capable of accomodating inconsistent opinions and, in any case, it is difficult to picture Maimonides as a "crafty schemer." Within two pages, however, Haberman says that he considers Leo Strauss's the best analysis of Maimonides' thought, and at the beginning of Chapter five he gives explicit en- dorsement to Strauss's methodology of deal- ing with Maimonidean contradiction. Haber- man's denunciation of Maimonides' defense of creation ex nihilo in Chapter four strongly implies that he takes the Maimonidean posi- tion at face value; in the same chapter, how- ever, a footnote describes that defense as piously insincere (p. 197), and Chapter five cites approvingly Abraham Nuriel's argu- ment that Maimonides believed in the eterni- ty of matter (p. 42). (A note in Chapter four even cites without criticism the opinion that Maimonides' occasional criticism of Aristotle is "tongue in cheek" [p. 204n. 43], precisely the phrase which was denounced in Chapter two.) Haberman, in fact, proceeds to criticize Maimonides for unethical behavior in mis- leading his readers about his true beliefs con- cerning this and other matters. Thus, the "benefit of the doubt" granted in Chapter two turns out to be a dubious and ephemeral benefit. It means that Haberman will assume Maimonides' sincerity so that he can attack his argument and then assume his insincerity so that he can attack his ethics. It should also be noted briefly that the substance of Haberman's refutation of Maimonides' discussion of creation ex nihilo is certainly not sufficiently weighty to establish insincerity by the criteria of Chapter two. Haberman argues that the Maimoni- dean assertion that the present laws of nature may not have obtained at the moment of creation turns God into a cosmic magician who has deceived everybody by bringing about these changes in natural law. He then presents an entertaining paragraph defending the proposition that God created the world last Friday night and provided us with Sab- bath clothes and ready-made memories. The argument is not without force. At the same time, there is clearly a vast difference be- tween the deception involved in the ex nihilo creation of a world giving the impression of primeval existence and that practiced by a God who provides ready-made memories, and this reader has reservations about the ef- fectiveness of this argument even as a reduc- tio ad absurdum. A striking example of unfair criticism comes when Haberman attacks both Maimo- nides and Aquinas for utilizing a proof of the</page><page sequence="3">176 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES existence of God which is based upon the be- lief in the eternity of matter. Since both of them profess rejection of eternity despite their use of it in the proof, Haberman makes the inexplicable assumption that the proof is based on the simultaneous positing of an eternal and a non-eternal world. Yet, he says, you can prove anything if you begin with two contradictory premises. After denouncing both philosphers for this "grotesque method- ology" (p. 211n. 12), he finally points out that this is a legitimate use of what he calls disjunction, i.e., proving something first by one assumption (that the world is eternal) and then by the alternative assumption (that it is not). This (which is obviously and explic- itly what both Maimonides and Aquinas were doing) might be all right, he says, except that all you can try to prove by the assumption of eternity is the God of Aristotle and not of the Bible. This is a completely different (and commonplace) point, however, which Haber- man had made in a previous chapter (pp. 36-37), and yet he does not hesitate to revert to the two contradictory premises of inter- pretation in a later chapter (p. 85). Despite such peculiarities, the book makes many interesting and effective points about negative attributes, analogical predication, anthropomorphism, and other central issues in medieval philosophy. In a concluding chapter with a genuinely moving passage near the end, Haberman argues that the inability to prove religious assertions does not refute them, that indeed philosophical proof would undermine the faith experience. He does, however, maintain in an avowedly Mendels- sohnian vein that Judaism is a revealed law in which "the mind is given free rein in specula- tive matters; it is not trammeled or fettered in any way" (p. 92). This is extreme exaggera- tion. The belief in a benevolent God in the face of a Holocaust, the assertion of human freedom in the face of an omniscient God, the tension (described so sharply by Haber- man, himself) between a moral God and one who is neither anthropomorphic nor anthro- popathic-all these reflect affirmations of faith which declare certain conclusions inad- missible a priori despite what might plausibly be considered the demands of reason. Haberman, who describes himself as an Orthodox Jew, does confront one such issue directly by arguing for freedom in biblical (including Pentateuchal) criticism. He does not seem to succeed, however, in establishing the legitimacy of higher Pentateuchal criticism in any form of orthodoxy, medieval or modern (see pp. 94, 134-36). In particular, he lumps together the "dictation theory" of Scripture and the belief in the "factuality of the Sinaitic revelation as recorded in Exodus," and then asserts that belief in these propositions "is no longer shared even by 'religious' Jews" (p. 136), apparently in- cluding the Orthodox. This, however, is mis- leading. He can point to a small minority of Orthodox thinkers who have argued against a dogmatic insistence on an audible voice at Sinai, but even this is a far cry from a denial of "the factuality of the revelation as re- corded in Exodus." Haberman, who endorses Schechter's description of at least some higher critics as "higher anti-Semites" (p. 166), owes his readers an elaboration of his stand on these issues. This is a volume which resists neat sum- mary or unequivocal evaluation. It is a stimulating, exasperating, provocative, and problematical work which will surely arouse the interest of almost every reader. Assent, however, is another matter.
