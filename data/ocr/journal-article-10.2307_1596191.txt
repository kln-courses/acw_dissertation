<plain_text><page sequence="1">Studia Islamica, 2001 The A'lam al-hadith of al-Khattibi a commentary on al-Bukhiri's Sahih or a polemical treatise?* Vardit Tokatly 1. Introduction The numerous commentaries on al-Bukh-ri's Sahih have hardly attracted the attention of Western scholarship as an independent subject for research. ('). This is unfortunate, in view of the indispensability of the commentaries for any attempt to understand the important, very often problematic text of al-Bukhiri' s work. In the absence of sufficient up-to-date information regarding the early commentaries, most Islamicists refer time and again to the well-known, relati- vely late writings of al-Kirmini (d. 786/1384), al-'Asqalfini (d. 852/1448), * This essay is based on a chapter from a Ph. D. dissertation prepared under the supervision of Prof. Y. Friedmann and Prof. E. Kohlberg at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I wish to express my gratitude to my supervisors for their careful reading of this paper and for their invaluable suggestions. (1) Referring only to commentaries which have been preserved, Sezgin enumerates over 50 texts, dating from the 10* century until today (see GAS, pp. 118-126 ; cf. also p. 129, enumerating treatises focusing on the tardjim). Sezgin's list may be considerably enlarged by reference also to commentaries which have not survived (cf. the lists of commentaries and other relevant works in al-Qastalldni, Irshdd al-sdri, Biillq, 1304, vol. 1, pp. 41-44; .lijji Khalifa, Kashfal-punan, ed. Flilgel, Leipzig, 1835, vol. 2, pp. 521-541; Siddiq Htasan Khan al-Qannawji, al-Ilittafi al-sihah al-sitta, ed. 'Ali Hasan al-Halabi, Beirut, 1408/1987, pp. 321-346; al- Kandalawi, Muqaddima, p. 393 ff.; al-Hasani, Muhammad 'Iskm 'Arir, lthdfal-qari' bi-ma'rifat juhad wa- a'mdl al-'ulamd' 'ald Sahih al-Bukhdri, Beirut, 1407/1987; cf. also Madrasa, vol. 2, pp. 569-578 (focusing on Maghribi commentaries alone). The "lost" commentaries indeed deserve mention in view of the fact that they are often quoted at some length within the commentaries we possess (thus, for instance, one finds in the commentary by Ibn Battil al-Qurtubi (d. 449/1057; see GAS, vol. I, p. 118; Ithdf, pp. 197-198) numerous quotations from the lost work of his teacher, al-Muhallab b. Abi Sufra (d. 435/ 1043-4; see Ithaf, pp. 358- 359). The same Ibn Battal also quotes from the early commentaries (lost as well) by Abi Ja'far al-Dd'idi (d. 402/ 1011-2; see Ithdf, p. 98) and Abfi al-Zinad Siraj (d. 422/1031, See Ithdf, pp. 128-129). This vast literature has not yet been seriously studied by Western scholars. To the best of my knowledge there are no studies focusing on specific commentaries, nor attempts to describe the generic features of the commentaries as a whole. Moreover, the information regarding the commentaries in the basic reference lite- rature (i. e. GAL, GAS and the relevant articles in EP) is often out-of-date, deficient or even misleading. Generally speaking, the commentaries have received more attention from modem Muslim scholars publi- shing in Arabic. Several useful studies as well as editions of relevant texts have been published in Asia or Africa. Most of these contributions, however, are not recorded in the Western reference literature. 53</page><page sequence="2">VARDIT TOKATLY al-'Ayni (d. 855/1451) and al-Qastallani (d. 923/1517). At the same time, the earlier commentaries, which very much merit consideration, are almost totally neglected. Three of these early works are especially noteworthy: those written by al-Khattabi (d. 388/998 or 386/996), Ibn Battal (d. 449/1057) and al- Nawawi (d. 676/1278). () Here I will focus on the earliest of those. The A'lam al-hadith(') by Abu Sulayman Hamd b. Muhammad al- Khattabi al-Busti is known as the earliest commentary to have been written on al-Bukhari's Sahih. (') Al-Khattabi was a Sunni Shafi'i(') scholar, who wrote approximately thirty treatises on various subjects. (6) As far as com- mentaries on (what was to become) the canonical hadith literature are concerned al-Khattdbi may indeed be seen as a pioneer, writing the earliest ones both on Abui Da'uid's Sunan(') and on al-Bukhari's Sahih. (8) One might expect to find a resemblance between the A 'lkm and other com- mentaries on the Sahih, like the six mentioned above. (9) However, this is not (2) The commentaries by al-Khattabi and al-Nawawi are both available in published editions. Al- Khattibi's commentary has been published twice, under two different titles: 1. A 'Idm al-sunan, ed. Yfisuf al-Kattani, Rabat, 1408/1988. 2. A 'Idm al-hadith fi sharh Sahih al-Bukhdri, ed. Muhmmad b. Sa'd b. 'Abd al-Rahmin l Sa'ad, Mecca, 1409/1988 (unless otherwise stated, references are to this edition). Al-Nawawi's unfinished commentary was published in Shurah al-Bukhiri: Sharh al- 'alldma al-Nawawl wa-Irhdd al-sdrf li'l-Qastalldn wa- 'Awn al-bdrf li-Siddlq b. iHasan al-Qannawji, Cairo, n. d. (reprinted in Beirut, n. d.). The introduction alone was reissued under the title Md tamassu ilayhi hdjat al-qdri' li-Sahih al-imdm al-Bukhari, ed. 'Ali flasan 'Ali 'Abd al-Hamid, Beirut, n. d. (For a discussion of al-Nawawi's commentary see al-Hadddd, Ahmad 'Abd al-'Aziz Qdsim, al-lmdm al-Nawawi wa-atharuhufi al-hadith wa-'ulamihi, Beirut, 1413/1992, pp. 302-308).

Al-Khattabi's commentary is the first to be men- tioned in the earliest and most important list enumerating the commentaries on the Sahih, namely, the one included in al-Qastalldni's introduction to the Irshdd al-sdrf. It is also the first to be mentioned in later simi- lar lists, all based on al-Qastallani's, such as those by t.lijji Khalifa, Siddiq Hasan Khin and al-KUndalawi (for references see footnote 1 above).

The main purpose of this article is to show that the distinctive character of the A'Ildm stems from its polemical goal, which had a decisive influence on its contents. I hope to show that the A'lkdm, so far regarded merely as a commentary on the Sahih, is in fact a polemical treatise. As such, it bears a remarkable resemblance to several other treatises written for similar polemical purposes. 2. The major differences between the A'lam and other com- mentaries on al-Bukhirl's Sahih Commentators on al-Bukhari's Sahih usually discuss the entire work, from beginning to end, paying a great deal of attention to each of its components. Generally speaking, al-Bukhiri's work comprises two distinct elements: 1. It contains traditions, which are the building blocks of every collection of hadith. 2. It has a distinct skeleton, or framework, in which the traditions are arranged according to their subject-matter. (0) This framework is mainly made up of sophisticated, often long, tardjim (chapter headings), containing an abundance of material. The most conspicuous difference between al-Khattdibi and the other commentators is al-Khattabi's lack of interest in the framework of the Sahih, notwithstanding its great significance. In what follows I will try to elucidate this point. Being one of the "two Sahihs", as well as one of the "six books", al-Bukhiri's work is too often regarded by modem scholars as a mere collection of hadith, renowned for the supposed authenticity of the traditions which it contains. Howe- ver, such a description of the work is deficient, not to say misleading. As Gold- ziher's illuminating observations show,(") the Sahih is much more than a com- pilation. It is rather an original work, whose author, al-Bukhiri, attempts to mould the opinions of his readers towards his views on the practical applications of the traditions which he cites. He does so by his wise chapter headings, the tarcjim, which may thus be regarded as the most important characteristic of the Sahih. (12) (10) Cf. the detailed table of contents of al-Bukhkri's work in M. F. 'Abd al-BBqi, Taysir al-manfa'a bi-kit bay Miftah kunaz al-sunna wa'l-Mu jam al-mufahras li-alfY4 al-hadith al-nabawi, Cairo, 1353/1935, book 1. It should be noted that the framework as presented there corresponds to Krehl's edition alone (Leiden, 1862-1908). As is well known, there are substantial variations in the framework among the various archetypes (ummahat) of the Sahih and the diverse transmissions (riwdydt) derived from them (cf. Goldziher, Muslim Studies, vol. 2, pp. 220-221). These differences are clearly reflected in the published editions of the work. It should also be noted that 'Abd al-BWqi cites only the beginnings of the longer chapter headings. (11) See Goldziher, Muslim Studies, vol. 2, pp. 216-218 (cf. also pp. 226-227); idem, The Zahiris, pp. 97-100 (cf. also p. 44). (12) According to one theory, al-Bukhari first prepared the entire framework of his treatise and only then filled it out with relevant hadith data. Being unable to provide appropriate traditions for some of the tarajim he even- tually left them as they were, that is, as mere headings, not followed by traditions (ses Goldziher, Muslim Studies, vol. 2, p. 217; al-Kirmini, Sharh, part 2, pp. 2-3; Ibn Khaldfin, Muqaddima, part 2, p. 402). This theory aims to explain the peculiar fact that the Sahih contains a considerable number of "vacant" chapters, containing nothing but a heading. However this may be, it clearly shows how essential an element the tardjim are. 55</page><page sequence="4">VARDIT TOKATLY In discussing al-Bukhtiri's tarajim Goldziher laid stress mainly on their subjectivity. He illustrated this point by several examples, to which one can add many others.(13) Goldziher's citations also exemplify another characte- ristic of the tarajim: they are often quite long, containing an abundance of valuable material. (") In them al-Bukhiri not only records various judge- ments and assertions, both his own and those of other scholars, but he also refers (either by quotation or allusion) to numerous Qur'danic verses and tra- ditions, usually cited in the form of ta'liq. (15) While some of these traditions recur within the text itself (this time preceded by complete isnads), many of them do not. That is to say, al-Bukhdri refers in his tarajim to a great deal of hadith material which he did not see fit to include in the text itself. (6). Being well aware of the importance of the tarcjim, the commentators on the Sahih pay a great deal of attention to them. First, they examine each tarjama separately, trying to discern al-Bukhdiri's intention in it. Then, they take great pains to explain how the tarjama corresponds to each of the traditions cited under it. (") Their task, admittedly, is by no means an easy one. In many cases, neither the intention nor the correspondence (mu.tdbaqa / mundsaba) is easily discernible. ("8) Moreover, in a considerable number of instances, one simply fails to detect any correspondence between the tarcjim and the traditions. This problem of incoherence is related to several other difficulties involved with the tarajim, like that of the "vacant" chapters. ("9) The commentators discuss these problems at length, either with regard to specific instances or within general discussions in their introductions. (20) The importance of the tarajim as well as (13) See, for instance, the tarjama of bab 22 in K. al-Imdn (Sah.h, vol. 1, pp. 15-16), where al-Bukhiri guides his readers in the interpretation of the first tradition in the bdb. It should be noted that the literal meaning of the sta- tement which is attributed to the Prophet in this tradition does not tally with the orthodox views concerning the problem of takfir and the destiny of Muslims who commit grave sins. (14) See, for instance, the tardjim in K al-lmdn (2), bdb 1; K. al-'llm (3), bdb 6; bab 10; K. al-Wuda' (4), bab 34; K. al-fHay4d (6), bdb 24; K. al-Saldt (8), bdb 12; K. al-Nikdh (68), bdb 24; K al-Taldq (68), bab 11 (all refe- rences are to Krebl's edition). (15) I. e. without the indication of a complete isndd or with no isnad at all. For a detailed discussion of mu'allaq traditions cited by al-Bukhiri see Hady al-sari, pp. 14-17 (cf. Fadel, "Ibn Hajar's Hady", pp. 185-190). Ibn Hajar discusses the mu'allaq traditions also in his Taghllq al-ta 'lq (ed. Sa'id 'Abd al-Rahm5n Milsd al-Qazaqi, Amman, 1405/1985). See esp. vol. 2, p. 7 ff. (Ibn Hajar's introduction); vol. 1. p. 283 ff. (the editor's introduction). See also al-Nawawi, Sharh, p. 9, lines 5-7; p. 14, lines 17-29 (= Md tamassu, pp. 51; 91-92, respectively); F. Rosen- thal, "Ta'lik", EF, s. v. (esp. the last paragraph); Fadel, "Ibn Hajar's Hady", p. 197. (16) Ibn Hajar explicitly says that some mu'allaq traditions cited in the tardjim do not meet al-Bukhiri's cri- teria (md Id yaltahiq bi-shartihi). lie even defines some of these traditions as "weak" (da'j). See Hady al-sari, p. 14, lines 13-14; p. 14, line 28- p. 15, line 7; p. 15, line 25- p. 16, line 14; p. 16, line 24- p. 17, line 1. Cf. Fadel, "Ibn Hajar's Hady", pp. 164-165. (17) These issues are already frequently discussed in the comparatively early commentary by Ibn Battgl (for which see footnote 2 above). Ibn Batt.l's discussions are often based on earlier sources (like the commentary by his teacher, al-Muhallab b. Abi Sufra). See, for instance, Ibn Battl, Shar4h, part 2, fol. 138a; 148b; 170b; part 1, fol. 8a; part 4, fol. 132a. For later commentators see, e. g., al-'Ayni, 'Umdat al-qdri', [Cairo, 1348], vol. 1, p. 204, line 30; p. 213, line 19; p. 228, line 31; p. 232, line 20; p. 241, line 11 etc. (18) Cf. Ibn Khaldfin in Muqaddima, part 2, pp. 401-403 (= vol. 2, pp. 457-459 in Rosenthal's translation). (19) See footnote 12 above. (20) See al-Kirmf ni, Sharh, part 1, pp. 4-5; Hady al-sdri, pp. 6, 11-12 (cf. Fadel, "Ibn .lajar's Hady", pp. 164, 173-174). 56</page><page sequence="5">THE A 'AM AL-HADITH OF AL-KHATTABI their problematic nature led several scholars to go even further and to write monographs on the tardjim alone.(2') The distinctive character of the A 'ldm is indeed striking in light of the data just presented. Strictly speaking, the A'ldm is a commentary on tradi- tions drawn from the Sahifh and not a commentary on al-Bukhari's work as a whole. First, al-Khattabi does not comment on all the traditions cited by al- Bukhdri, but only on problematic ones that he picks out.(22) Altogether, he refers to roughly a quarter of the traditions cited within the text of the Sahih. (23) Second - and more important - al-Khattabi shows a fundamental lack of interest in the renowned framework of al-Bukhari's work. He usually comments on the traditions alone, without any reference to the tardjim under which they are cited or to the "books" (kutub) in which these tardjim are contained. (") He thus passes over a great deal of important material. (') Fur- thermore, he neglects al-Bukhiri's subjective judgements and "instructions" regarding what could or rather should be deduced from the various tradi- tions. Once al-Khattabi ignores the original element of al-Bukhari's work (i. e. the framework), he is left with only the unoriginal element (i. e. the col- lected traditions). In fact, al-Khattabi uses the Sahtih as a vessel from which to draw traditions. He decidedly does not treat it as a work requiring consi- deration and commentary in its entirety. This indeed is exceptional. It forms a striking contrast to the careful and respectful manner in which the other commentators discuss almost every word of al-Bukhari's. Al-Khattabi's disregard of the framework is surprising not merely because it is an essential element of the Sahih, but mainly because such an approach does not seem to be compatible with the deep reverence towards al-Bukhari's work which might he expected of a Sunni Muslim scholar. It is true that al-Khattabi praises the Sahtih in his introduc- tion to the A 'ldm. (2) However, the manner in which he uses it suggests that he does not hold it to be a most venerable, almost sacred book, as later scho- (21) See Hady al-sdri, p. 12; al-Kindalawi, Muqaddima, pp. 285-289; GAS, p. 129. It should be noted, though, that in most cases works about the tardjim are not enumerated separately, but are placed within more comprehensive lists of commentaries and other relevant works (cf. the references to al-Qastallani's list etc. in footnote 1 above). (22) In his introduction al-Khattbi uses certain restrictive expressions which make it clear that he intends to interpret only a definite portion of the Sahih (see pp. 78-79, 82 below). In addition, al-Khatttbi states that he does not intend to repeat himself and discuss at length traditions already treated in the Ma'dlim al-sunan - his commentary on Abu Di'id's Sunan (see A 'Idm, pp. 104-105). Cf. also A 'ldm, vol. 1, pp. 75-76; A '1dm (Rabat), vol. 1, p. 64; al-Batili, al-Imam al-Khattabi, pp. 236-237. (23) See the editor's remarks in A 'ldm, vol. 4, p. 2362; al-Bitili, al-lmdm al-Khattabi, pp. 238-239. (24) It should be noted that most tarajim and names of "books" found in the two published editions of the A 'ldm are not part of the original text but were added by the editors (see A'ldm (Rabat), vol. 1, pp. 60, 110, note 1; A 'ldm, vol. 1, p. 78). The fact that al-Khattibi does mention some tardjim and names of "books" indicates that they were not accidently lacking in the version of the Sahih to which he refers. That is, he does not neglect the tardjim unintentionally. (25) Ibn Hajar's illuminating discussion with respect to the first tarjama in K. al-Indn (see Fath al-bdrf, vol. 1. pp. 51-54) clearly shows how worthy of attention al-Bukhmri's tardjim are. Cf. also footnote 14 above. (26) See A'ldm, pp. 101-102. 57</page><page sequence="6">VARDIT TOKATLY lars normally do.(27) This notion is supported by some utterances of al- Khattabi's in the introduction to his commentary on Abfi Da'uid's Sunan. There he clearly shows that he prefers Abu Da'fid to both al-Bukhari and Muslim. Moreover, he presents the opposite view (namely, the opinion of those who prefer the two Sahihs) as a mere local tendency, characteristic of the inhabitants of Khurasan. (2") Al-Khattabi's words indicate that in his time al-Bukhari's work did not yet occupy the exceptional place which it later attained. One may therefore be tempted to go further and attribute the idiosyncratic character of the A 'ldm to this very fact. However, I do not believe that this should be done. The present study will try to show that al-Khattabi's evaluation of the Sahih is only a secondary explanation for the nature of his commentary. Admit- tedly, had al-Khattabi deeply venerated al-Bukhari's work he would proba- bly have refrained from handling it as he did. But he was motivated prima- rily by his polemical purpose, which may therefore be regarded as the main reason for the distinctive character of the A 'iam. Al-Khattabi's polemical purpose will soon be presented. But first, I would like to point out another characteristic of the A'lam, namely, its author's acute sensitivity to anthropomorphism. He pays a great deal of attention to anthropomorphic utterances, with which he deals in various ways.("') Certainly, other commentators too are aware of the problem of anthropomorphism. Yet they do not pay greater attention to it than they do to other problems. That is, they carefully discuss anthropomorphic utte- rances just as they carefully discuss almost every word in the Sahih. Al- Khattibi, on the other hand, comments only on chosen traditions and refers only to selected issues with regard to each tradition. This makes his sensiti- vity to anthropomorphism conspicuous. In other words, the fact that many traditions containing anthropomorphic utterances made their way into the part of the Sahih to which al-Khattabi refers suggests that he attached more importance to the problem of anthropomorphism than to any other issue. (27) For the veneration of the Sahih see Goldziher, Muslin Studies, vol. 2, pp. 234-235. Cf. also Madrasa, vol. 2, p. 541 ff. (28) See Ma'dlim, vol. 1, p. 6. Al-Khattabi's words, as quoted by al-Nawawi (Tahdhib al-asma', ed. F. Wuistenfeld, Gottingen, 1842-47, pp. 711-712) are discussed by Goldziher in Muslim Studies, vol. 2, pp. 235-236. (Note that al-Khattibi's most problematic comment is "censored" by al-Nawawi.) See also Gtin- ther, "Der 5ifi'itische Traditionalist", pp. 72-74. (29) Al-Khattibi's sensitivity to anthropomorphism is clearly exemplified in A 'Idm, vol. 4, pp. 2349- 2355, where he discusses at length a tradition describing Muhammad's ascension to the seven heavens. Dis- cussing the anthropomorphic utterances included in this tradition al-Khattabi does not refrain from using some sharp words. See, for instance, p. 2352, lines 5-7; p. 2352, lines 15-16; p. 2354, lines 12-13. Cf. also ibid, vol. 1, p. 531, lines 1-3; p. 702, lines 5-7. For a discussion of al-Khattdbi's position concerning the pro- blem of anthropomorphic attributes of God see Gimaret, Dieu, pp. 46-48. For a partial list of anthropomor- phic utterances discussed by al-KhattAbi see section 5. 2. 1. below. 58</page><page sequence="7">THE A 'LAM AL-HADITH OF AL-KHATTABI 3. Al-Khattibl's polemical goal as presented in his introduction to the A'Idm A careful reading of al-Khattabi's introduction(30) helps one to unders- tand the distinctive character of the A'lkdm. Al-Khattabi first relates that while he was staying in Balkh he was asked to comment on al-Bukhari's al- Jami' al-sahih, to interpret the problematic traditions in it (al-mushkil min ahadithihi) (31) and to elucidate their obscure meanings. He was asked to do this by some of his brethren to whom he had just finished dictating the Ma'dlim al-sunan - his commentary on Abi Da'uid's Sunan. (32) Al-Khattdbi confesses that at first he refrained from complying with the request, holding the task to be too difficult. He explains why it is more difficult to write a commentary on al-Bukhari's work than to write one on Abu Da'6id's, poin- ting out significant differences in the contents of the two collections.(33) He then describes the circumstances that urged him to change his mind: "... Then I reflected on the current state of affairs: the disappearance of knowledge and the appearance of ignorance, the predominance of the ahl al- bida' (= "people of the innovations"), (3) the turning of many young people towards their doctrines and away from the Book (= al-Qur' an) and the sunna and their relinquishing the search for their (= Qur'~n and sunna) meanings and their subtle sciences. I have seen how, as they abandoned this know- ledge and were deprived of their lot in it, they displayed enmity towards it and went far in defaming its people. They were as God to Whom belong might and majesty said: (35) 'And since they are not guided by it, certainly they will say, "This is an old calumny!". ' I found that they had clung to tra- ditions belonging to the mutashabih al-'ilm (= the ambiguous/ equivocal knowledge), (3") which the collector of this book (i.e. al-Bukh.ri, the author of the Sahih) had transmitted and authenticated by means of the sanad (= the chain of authorities) and the transmission; [such traditions whose] purport and meaning the common hadith transmitters scarcely know, and whose interpretation is known only to the distinguished persons among them who are 'firmly rooted in knowledge', well-versed in it (innamd ya'rifu ta'wilaha al-khawass minhum al-rdsikhun fi al-'ilm al-mutahaqqiqun bihi).

When they (= the opponents) find them (=the common ahl al-hadith etc.) unacquainted with them (=the traditions), unconversant with their meanings, they use them as a means to their end, namely, to defame and vilify the party of ahl al-hadith. Thereupon, they (=the opponents) accuse them (=the ahl al-hadith) of igno- rance and misunderstanding, asserting that they are muqallidun (="imitators", i. e., people who uncritically accept authority) (39) who transmit that which they do not comprehend and, when asked about it and about its meanings, are redu- ced to silence (yanqati'uina)(40). They call them, on this account, 'slanderer(s)' (hammanlat al-hatab)(41), 'pack camel(s) laden with books' (zdmil al-asfdr)(42), and other derogatory names and appellations similar to these..."(43) Al- Khattqbi adds that many ignorant and inexperienced young people forsake the sunan under the influence of the opponents, thereupon losing a great deal of religion. He expresses fear that the situation might become even worse in the future, in view of the scanty number of scholars in his time who seriously study .hadith. Seeing all that, al-KhattAbi concludes, he decided to comply with the request and interpret the problematic (mushkil) traditions of al-Bukhari's Sahih. He expresses a hope that his work will be "an enlightenment for the 'people of the truth' (ahl al-haqq) as well as a testimony against the 'people of falsehood and deviation' (ahl al-batil wa'l-zaygh)." Al-Khattabi's words, which conceal more than they reveal, merit careful analysis. Yet the following points emerge quite clearly: the A 'ldm is not an ordinary commentary, written simply in order to expound the difficult text of the Sahih. It is a polemical, or, rather, an apologetic treatise, written during a hard time for the ahl al-hadith. It is clear that al-Khattibi feels threatened by a certain anti-hadith movement presented as stemming from the predominance of the ahl al-bida' and the popularity of their doctrines among young people. The opponents reportedly misuse problematic tradi- tions from the Sahih in order to defame the entire party of ahl al-hadfth. Al- Khatt~bi's main purpose is to offer proper interpretations of these traditions so as to refute the opponents' claims. Who precisely are these opponents of the ahl al-hadith? Al-Khattabi is far from being precise on this point. He mentions of course the ahl al-bida'. (38) The text has wa 'l-rjl which is unclear. However, this might be a plural form (rujjal?/ rajl?) related to the well known meaning of the verb irtajala "to improvise, to speak impromptu or without premeditation". (See Tdj al-'ards, s.v. rjL Note that the expression kaldm rajil is explained by kaldm murtajal) If that is so, then al-Khatabi is refering to certain people among the ahl al-hadith who, when asked about problematic tra- ditions, simply answer off the top of their head. (39) See section 4 below. (40) Literally: they become cut off, i. e. they become short of words, unable to answer their advesaries. For inqita' as a technical term denoting defeat in a debate see G.

Being the antonym of ahl al-sunna it may refer either to all non-Sunnis as a whole or to any specific group among them. (") No other group is named in the introduction, nor any individual antagonist. (45) However, various hints which are dropped in it may lead one to identify the opponents more precisely. One of these hints will now be discussed. 4. Who were al-Khattibi's opponents? Al-Khattibi mentions that the opponents accuse the ahl al-hadlth of being muqallidin, i. e., of practising taqlid. Taqlid (= blind imitation or uncritical acceptance of authority)(") often occurs in theological and philo- sophical contexts as the antonym of nazar (= reflection, speculation) or its synonym bahth (= investigation, examination).('4) In matters of faith, the two opposites denote different ways of arriving at one's beliefs: uncritical submission to authority as against personal intellectual effort. In the pre- Ash'ari period of Sunni Islam both taqlld and nazar (or bahth) were usually associated with specific schools. The warmest advocates of nagar were the mutakallimfin, predominantly the Mu'tazilis. (48) The way of taqlid, on the other hand, was primarily identified with the sworn enemies of kaldm among the ahl al-hadith, namely, the Hanbalis.('4) However, already by al- Khattqibi's time (the second half of the 4/10 century, after al-Ash'ari's appearance) the situation had become far more complicated. This may be illustrated by the following example. The antagonism between nazar and taqlid is presented in a short treatise by al-Ash'ari (d. 324/935-6) entitled K. al-Hathth 'aki al-bahth ("Book of Exhortation to Investigation"). (50) As is well known, al-Ash'ari was at first an adherent of the Mu'tazili school, but then rejected its teachings in favour of the dogma of the ahl al-hadith. The latter, however, refused to accept him (44) See J. Robson, "Bid'a", EF, s. v. and the references there; G. H. A. Juynboll, "Sunna", EF, s. v.

Even his al-Ibdna 'an usl1 al-diyana - a treatise by which he hoped to prove his loyalty to their doctrines - was vehemently rejected by them, particularly by the Hanbalis. Having despaired of accep- tance al-Ash'ari wrote the K. al-Hathth 'ald al-bahth (5) which begins as fol- lows: (52) "In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Verily, a group of people have made ignorance their capital, as reflection (al-nazar) and inquiry regarding religion (al-bahth 'an al-din) were onerous to them. They have inclined to taqlid, and have spoken evil of whoever investigated the principles of religion (usal al-din), (53) accusing him of straying from the right way (.Ialdl). They have alleged that the discussion of (al-kalam ft)(5") bodies (al-jism), (55) accidents (al-'arad), (56) motion and rest (al-haraka wa'l-sukun), (57) colours (al-alwdn), (58) modes of being (akwan), (59) atoms (al-juz'), (6) the "leap" (al-tafra)(6") and God's attributes (sifdt Alldh)(62) is an innovation and a deviation from the right way..." This passage illustrates the antagonism between taqlid and nazar/ bahth. It also illuminates the close relation between nazar and kaldm. The people condemned by the supporters of taqlid are undoubtedly the mutakallimun. This is already implied in their description as people who investigate usul al- din(63) and in the astute way in which al-Ash'ari employs the verbal noun kaldm ft. (4). The list of issues alleged to be discussed by them leaves no room for doubts as to their identity: all these issues are well known techni- cal terms unmistakably identified with kaldm.

Does such a position tes- tify that al-Ash'ari did not cease to be a Mu'tazili? The answer depends on the point of view of the answerer. A Hanbali would probably have replied that it does, whereas al-Ash'ari and his followers would most likely have asserted that it does not. When al-Ash'ari converted to the doctrine of the ahl al-hadith he abandoned the dogmatic theses of the Mu'tazilis but not their methods of argumentation. Furthermore, the way in which he applied the rational arguments of kalam to the defense of the "orthodox" doctrine was acceptable to a large body of followers. The antagonism between taqlid and na;ar continued for many centuries after al-Ash'ari's death, as did the relation between nazar and kalam. However, as the term mutakallimu ahl al- hadith/ al-sunna (65) clearly indicates, nazar and kaldm ceased to be neces- sarily identified with the Mu'tazili school. Let us return to al-Khattabi's claim that the opponents of the ahl al-hadith condemn them for being muqallidin. Considering the antagonism between taqlid and nazar it seems most plausible that the opponents in question are the avowed enemies of taqlid, namely, the mutakallimuin. This assumption is further supported by a polemical work of al-Khattabi's entitled al-Ghunya 'an al-kaldm wa-ahlihi ("Freedom from need of kaldm and its people"). (66) Al-Ghunya dit not survive in its entirety. However, long passages from it were preserved within works by Isma'il b. Muhammad al-Taymi al-Isbahani (d. 535/1140), (67) Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328) (6) and al-Suyfti (d. 911/1505).(69) In certain respects al-Ghunya is a mirror image of al- Ash'ari's al-Hathth 'ald al-bahth. Both al-Ash'ari and al-Khatt~bi polemi- cally contrast nazar and taqlid.(70) In both texts nazar is identified with (65) This term is used, for instance, by 'Abd al-Qdhir al-Baghdadi (d. 429/1037; see K. Usal al-din, Istanbul, 1346/1928, vol. 1, pp. 307-310) and Abf al-Mu'in al-Nasafi (d. 508/1037; see Tabsiral al-adilla, ed. C. Salam6, Damascus, 1990, vol. 1, p. 28, line 18; p. 42, line 9; p. 146, line 2). Ibn 'Astkir (d. 571/1176) distinguishes between the kaldm of the ahl al-bida' and the kaldm of the ahl al-sunna wa'l-jamd'a (see Abra- hamov, Islamic Theology, p. 84, note 70 and the references there).

The quotation from al-Ghunya in al-Suytii's Sawn is longer than the quota- tion in the other sources which were mentioned above. Al-Suytii's words before and after the quotation may create the impression that he is citing the entire text of al-Ghunya. However, in Ibn Taymiyya's al-.Hama- wiyya al-kubra one finds a short passage concerning God's attributes which is not quoted by al-Suyipti, nor by the other authors.

(7) Yet, while al-Ash'ari warmly advocates nagar and kaldm al-Khattabi strives to prove their futility. (72) Al- Ghunya is relevant to the present discussion since it clears up some ambi- guities in the introduction to the A'ldm. Certain claims which are attributed to the opponents in the two treatises are remarkably similar. In both texts the opponents condemn taqlid. (73) In both they claim that the hadith transmitters do not understand the meanings of the traditions which they transmit. (74) However, while in the A 'dlm the identity of the opponents remains vague, in al-Ghunya they are explicitly named as the mutakallimun. This, as well as other indications which will be discussed later, suggests that the A 'ldm is directed mainly (75) against the mutakallimtin. Still, one may wonder what kind of mutakallimun al-Khattdbi has in mind. He does not name any specific school of kaldm in al-Ghunya, yet his words at the begin- ning of the treatise (6) suggest that he is mainly concerned about the increa- sing popularity of Ash'ari kaldm. (77) This assumption seems most plausible with respect to the A 'lam as well. 5. The similarity between the A 'lam and other treatises written for similar polemical purposes There is more than one way of establishing the thesis that the polemical goal of the A 'lim had a decisive influence on its contents as well as on its cha- racter. However, the assumption is best supported by the striking similarity between the A 'ldm and two other treatises written for similar polemical pur- poses, namely, the K. Ta'wil mukhtalif al-hadith by Ibn Qutayba (d. 276/889)(78) and the K. Mushkil al-hadith wa-baydnihi by Ibn Fiirak (d. 406/1015).(79) The similarity between the three is indeed remarkable, espe- cially in view of the substantial difference between the A 'ldm and the other commentaries on al-Bukhdri's Sahiih. Both the similarity and the difference indicate that although the A'lim is usually listed among the commentaries on al-Bukhlri's work it in fact belongs to a series of polemical treatises reflecting the continuous struggle between the ahl al-hadith and their opponents.

Watt, "Ibn FMirak", EP, s. v. 64</page><page sequence="13">THE A 'LAM AL-HADITH OF AL-KHATTABI The A 'lkm, Mukhtalif and Mushkil share two important features: 1. All three works were written with a declared polemical goal: to defend the hadith as well as the people who call themselves ahl / ashMb al-hadith ("people of the hadith") against their opponents. (80) 2. All three authors attempt to achieve that purpose by the same means: .hadith commentary. A comparative study of the A'ldm, Mukhtalifand Mushkil shows that they resemble one another in many other significant aspects. In fact, the simila- rity between them is so strong that one might even hold them to be three works of the same genre. A detailed discussion will follow. However, the similarity between the works should not lead one to overlook some notable divergences. It is these that will be referred to first. The differences between the A'ldm, Mukhtalif and Mushkil result from two facts: 1. Their authors belonged to different trends within the heterogeneous complex of tendencies, currents and groups eventually to become Sunni or orthodox Islam. 2. They were written under different historical circumstances. Ibn Qutayba wrote the Mukhtalifin the period following al-Mutawakkil's anti- Mu'tazili reaction. Lecomte, therefore, describes the Mukhtalif as a polemical treatise, intended to support the restoration of Sunni Islam. (S') But what kind of Sunni Islam? Concluding a discussion of this question, () Lecomte suggests that Ibn Qutayba was a Hanbali partisan, though an independent one, of the ahl al- sunna wa'l-jamni'a. (") In that discussion, as well as in his article on Ibn Qutayba in E12, () Lecomte refers inter alia to Ibn Qutayba's hostile attitude towards Shafi'I qiyais. This point is significant, in view of the fact that both al-KhaUtbi and Ibn Ffirak were Shafi'is. It is worth mentioning as well that Ibn Qutayba precedes not only these two authors, but also Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (d. 324/935-6). One should bear this in mind, since al-Ash'ari and the theological school that arose after him were indeed a tuming point in the development of Sunni Islam. Of the three treatises under discussion only Ibn Qutayba's was written in the pre-Ash'ari period of Sunni Islam. The two other belong to the post-Ash'ari period. As already mentioned, both al-Khattabi and Ibn Furak are normally classified as Shtfi'is. (85) However, the two authors apparently belonged to (80) In all three cases the polemical goal is stated in the introduction. See A'lm, vol. 1, pp. 102-104 (discus- sed in section 3 above); Mukhtalif, p. 1 ff. (cf. Lecomte, Le TraitS, pp. viii-xix, 1-97); Mushkil (Kobert), p. 9 ff. (cf. p. (3) ff. of the German translation; Gimaret, Dieu, pp. 49-51). (81) See Lecomte, Le TraitS, p. viii. For the exact date of composition cf. also Lecomte, lbn Qutyaba, p. 90. (82) See Lecomte, Le Traitd, pp. xxxix-xl. (83) That is to say: Lecomte does not label Ibn Qutyaba a full-fledged .Hanbali, nor does he define him as a disciple of Ibn Hanbal in the narrow sense of the word. Nevertheless, he finds a remarkable agreement between doctrines and ideas of Ibn Qutayba and those of the Hanbalis. (84) Vol. I (1971), p. 846.

(esp. p. 767). 65</page><page sequence="14">VARDIT TOKATLY opposite tendencies within Shafi'ism. (86) Al-Khattabi may be called a "tra- ditionalist" Shafi'i. He most likely belonged to those Shafi'i jurists who were hostile to the exercise of kaldm as such, including kaldm in its Ash'ari version.(87) Ibn Furak, in contrast, was a well-known Ash'ari mutakallim, and as such, he may be considered a prominent representative of the opposite tendency within Shafi'ism: that which espoused the exer- cise of kalam and therefore supported Ash'arism. ("8) Ibn Furak evidently believed that one may exercise kaldm and still consider himself a loyal partisan of the ashpb al-hadith. Moreover, he held the [Ash'ari] theolo- gians to be one of two fundamental elements constituting the party of ashdb al-hadith, in the widest sense of this term, the other being the body of hadith transmitters (ahl al-naql wa'l-riwaya). To make clear the mis- sion laid upon each of the two groups respectively, Ibn Firak speaks in similes: he compares the hadith transmitters to treasurers (khazana) of religion, and the theologians to leaders of the army (batariqa), who protect the treasuries from enemies. (89) In the previous paragraphs I referred to some differences between the authors of the A 'Idm, Mukhtalif and Mushkil. Keeping these differences in mind I will now re-define the "common factor" between the three treatises, adding some necessary reservations. The A'lam, Mukhtalif and Mushkil were all written in order to defend the party of ahl (/ashdb) al-hadith and hadith in general against their opponents. In all three cases hadith commen- tary is the means the authors use in order to achieve their end. However, each of the three interprets the term ahl (/as4hab) al-hadith in a different fashion. For Ibn Qutayba ahl al-hadith means roughly Sunni Islam in its pre- Ash'ari Hanbali version. For al-Khattabi it means Sunni Islam in its "tradi- tionalist" non-Ash'ari Shafi'i version. For Ibn Firak it means Sunni Islam in (86) For these tendencies see E. Chaumont, "al-Shafi'iyya", EP, s. v. (see esp. p. 189). (87) Al-Khattbi's anti- kaldm treatise al-Ghunya 'an al-kaldm wa-ahlihi is briefly discussed above (see pp. 63-64). I tend to believe that al-Ghunya was directed not only against kaldm in its Mu'tazili version, but also (perhaps mainly?) against kaldm in its Ash'ari version. The fact that the Hanbali Ibn Taymiyya cites long passages from al-Ghunya in several of his works is suggestive (for references see footnote 68 above). For al- Khattabi's relations with the Ash'ari school cf. also Audebert, al-Hattdbi, pp. 24, 30, 44-45. Still, some non-literal interpretations offered by al-Khattabi show that in actual fact his positions were not far removed from those of the mutakalliman. This point is discussed in detail by Gimaret, who says: "... et it semble bien que la d6claration de principes 6nonc~e dans la risdla cit6e plus haut [namely, al-Ghu- nya - V. TI, et oil est formellement rejetee l'explication de type metaphorique, doive 8tre consid&amp;rde comme une position extreme, peut-&amp;tre soutenue un temps par IJatttbi, mais non en accord avec sa pratique..." (see Dieu, p. 47) ;"... On voit donc qu'en d6pit de certaines declarations en sens contraire, Ijattibi est bien i sa place dans la s6rie des ex6ghtes antilitteralistes" (ibid, p. 48). (88) In fact, Chaumont mentions Ibn Ffirak in this very context, alongside the names of four other pro- minent Shbfi'i-Ash'ari scholars: AbOi Ishiq a-lIsfariyini, al-Juwayni, Fakhr al-Din al-RMzi and al-Amidi (see Chaumont, ibid). (89) See Mushkil (K6bert), p. 9, line 17- p. 10, line 7 (= Mushkil (H), pp. 3-4); Gimaret, Dieu, p. 49, note 5. Ibn FOrak here uses ashab al-hadith as a synonym for the terms ahl al-haqq wa'l-sunna and ahl al-haqq min ahl al-sunna wa'l-jam 'a min ahl al-hadith which appear later on (see Mushkil (Kobert), p. 22, 21, res- pectively). 66</page><page sequence="15">THE A 'LAM AL-HADITH OF AL-KHATTABI its Ash'ari-Shafi'i version. (90) Further, since the three treatises are directed against the opponents of the ahl ashab al-hadith, and since the definition of this term constantly changes, the definition of the opponents changes accor- dingly. Obviously, all three authors direct their treatises against some sworn enemies of Sunni Islam. (91). Nonetheless, each adds to this "agreed upon" body of opponents some others, according to his own interpretation of Sunni Islam. Ibn Qutayba, for instance, clearly excludes from Sunni Islam AbiW Hanifa and the ashdb al-ra'y as a whole. (92) So - I think - does al-Khattlibi with regard to the Ash'ari mutakallimifn. Despite such differences there is still a striking resemblance between the A 'ldm, Mukhtalif and Mushkil. The polemical background they reflect is so similar that it seems at times as if the three authors shared a common arse- nal from which they drew: I. the same polemical arguments (either directed against their opponents or ascribed to them); 2. the same controversial traditions; 3. the same technical terms and derogatory names (i. e. they use the same jargon); 4. the same names of opponents, both individuals and groups. In what follows I will use these four features as rough starting points for establishing the similarity between the A 'ldm, Mukhtalif and Mushkil. 5.1. Similarity in the polemical arguments found in the three treatises Some arguments and assertions found (93) in the three treatises are remar- kably alike. The similarity appears in claims which the authors, in the name of the ahl al-hadith direct against their opponents. It also appears in claims ascribed to the opponents, against which the authors try to defend them- selves. I will focus here on two claims of the latter kind: 5.1.1. The claim that the ahl al-hadith are guilty of transmit- ting anthropomorphic traditions Both Ibn Qutayba and Ibn Ffirak ascribe to their opponents the assertion that the ahl al-hadith are guilty of transmitting anthropomorphic tradi- tions. (9) This is not surprising, since anthropomorphic utterances in Qur'din (90) This particular case is a useful reminder of how cautious one should be when dealing with general terms like Sunni or othodox Islam, especially in the context of the first centuries of the Muslim era. (91) See section 5. 4. below. (92) See Mukhtalif, pp. 62-71 (cf. Lecomte, Le TraitW, pp. 56-65). (93) At times these arguments and assertions are explicitly expressed; at others, they are just implied. (94) See Mukhtalif, pp. 7-9 (cf. Lecomte, Le Traitd, pp. xiv, xxviii, 6-7); Mushkil (Kobert), p. 9, line 15- p. 11, line 19; p. 21, lines 7-12 (cf. Gimaret, Dieu, pp. 49-50). While Ibn Qutayba simply says ahadith al-tashbih, the more cautious Ibn Ffirak prefers to say: md ishtahara min al-ahiddith [...] mimmdi yihimu Zawdlhiruhd al-tashbih (= "well known traditions [...] the literal meanings of which instill a delusion of anthropomorphism"). For the term tashbih (roughly meaning anthropomorphism) see J. van Ess, "Tashbih wa-Tanzih",EP, s. v. The problem of how to translate this term is discussed by Gimaret, ibid, pp. 9-10. 67</page><page sequence="16">VARDIT TOKATLY and hadith were indeed a major bone of contention between the ahl al- hadith and their opponents. ("9) Both Ibn Qutayba and Ibn Furak endeavour to refute specific assertions of their opponents regarding such utterances. (96) However, the relative importance attached to the issue of anthropomorphism is not the same in the two treatises. In the Mukhtalif Ibn Qutyaba strives to refute various charges leveled against the ahl al-hadith. To this end he dis- cusses problematic traditions of various types; anthropomorphic traditions constitute just one of these types. (97) Ibn Ftirak, on the other hand, devotes his entire treatise to a discussion of anthropomorphic traditions. The desire to supply the appropriate interpretation for such traditions is, in fact, the rai- son d'8tre of the Mushkil. The term tashbfh is not mentioned in al-Khattabi's introduction in the passage dealing with the polemical background of his treatise. Yet, when he refers to the traditions misinterpreted by the opponents, he uses the term mutashabih. (98) This term, as will be shown, is closely associated with the problem of anthropomorphism. (99) Moreover, I tend to explain al-Khaqt4bi' s strong feelings about anthropomorphism("00) as a reaction to the charge that the ahl al-hadith are guilty of practising tashbih. In other words, I believe that this accusation is the polemical background reflected in al-Khattqbi's conspicuous sensitivity to anthropomorphism. 5.1.2. The assertion that the ahl al-sadfth do not understand the meanings of the traditions which they transmit As we have seen al-KhattAbi reports that the opponents of the ahl al- hadith accuse them of transmitting traditions without having any knowledge of their meanings. This charge is phrased as follows: innahum muqallidana yarwina md ld yadrana wa-idhd su'ili 'anhu wa-'an ma'dnihi yanqati'ina. (101) Later on in the text, the first part of the accusation is ascri- (95) For a most relevant discussion see Gimaret, ibid, pp. 26-58. See also Abrahamov, pp. 23-27; J. van Ess, art. cit. and the references there. The controversy over anthropomorphic utterances in Qur' n focuses on the question of how to interpret them. In hadith there is also the problem of authenticity. Some comments of Ibn Qutayba and Ibn Ffirak imply that traditions including anthropomorphic utterances are simply rejected by the opponents as fabrications. The defenders of hadith usually react by offering non- literal interpretations of such traditions. Nevertheless, even they reject some traditions as inauthentic (for a discussion of four cate- gories of anthropomorphic traditions, ranging from sound ones to those that are unanimously rejected see. Mushkil (Kobert), pp. 22-23; Gimaret, Dieu, p. 51; Cf. also p. 80, footnote 170 and pp. 86-87 below). (96) See, for instance, Mukhltalif pp. 263-284. I see no point in giving specific references to the Mush- kil, since the entire treatise focuses on anthropomorphic traditions (as will now be discussed). (97) Cf. Gimaret, Dieu, p. 40, note 2. The title of Ibn Qutayba's treatise implies that the author is mainly concerned with inconsistencies and contradictions found in traditions. (For the main types of such contra- dictions see Lecomte, Le TraitE, p. xx.) (98) See A'/4m, p. 103. (99) See section 5. 3. 1. and p. 84, footnote 197 below. (100) See p. 58 above.

Ibrahim al-Mawsili. (102) A very simi- lar charge is reflected in Ibn Filrak's introduction.('03) The context there seems to imply that yarwana md k1 yadrina is an allusion to an (alleged) ('") saying of the Prophet, which the opponents of the ahl al-hadith exploit for their polemical purposes: innakum tanqulina md la tadrana wa-tarwfna md lc tafhamana wa-'an al-kashf 'an ma'ndhu tamanna'fna (/tamna'ana?/ tumna 'ina?)('") (= "You (will)(('") transmit that which you do not compre- hend and relate that which you do not understand and you will refrain from revealing its meaning (as being forbidden) (/and you will forbid revealing its meaning?/ and you will be prevented from revealing its meaning?)"). (o7) According to al-Khattdbi, the opponents not only accuse the ahl al-hadith of ignorance but also call them by corresponding derogatory names. (o08) One of these is worthy of consideration. It is the appellation zamil al-asfcar, liter- rally "a pack camel carrying books". This appellation reminds one of the poetical metaphor zawdmil li'l-ash'cr ("pack camels laden with poems"), included in verses by Marwin al-Akbar b. Abi Hafsa (d. ca. 181/797), cited by Ibn Qutayba in a very similar context. (1") The relevant passage has been thoroughly discussed by Goldziher, who referred, inter alia, to the "correc- tion" zawdmil li'l-asfdcr in a marginal note in the Mukhtalif ms. that he consulted.('t0) Goldziher suggested that the (ignorant) "corrector", being unaware of the original meaning of the verses, "corrected" the text so as to make it agree with the Qur'anic simile (62: 5): ka-mathal al-himdr yahmilu (102) See A '1dm, pp. 219-220. For Ishiq b. Ibrihim al-Mawsili see section 5. 4. below. (103) See Mushkil (K6bert), p. 13. (104) Ibn Firak is rather reserved concerning the authenticity of the tradition under discussion. Howe- ver, he offers a "harmless" interpretation of it, just in case it is authentic (in sahha). (105) Unfortunately, I was unable to locate this tradition (it is not mentioned in Wensinck, Concordance, nor in Zaghlfil, Mawsa'a). Since the context of the saying is missing, one hesitates between three possible readings of the last verb: 1. tamanna'ana (5* form, active voice); 2. tamna'ana (1" form, active voice); 3. tumna 'ana (1" form, passive voice). For the meaning see footnote 107 below. (106) Again, it is hard to decide whether to translate the Arabic verbs in the muddri' in the future or the present tense. (107) As can be judged from the context in which Ibn Firak cites the saying (see Mushkil (Kobert), pp. 12-14; 22), its last part refers to the [Hanbali] belief that one should refrain from any attempt to reveal the mea- nings of the mutashdbih traditions. (This belief is clearly expressed in the famous saying which Ibn F&amp;irak ascribes to al-Awz&amp;'i: amirrahd kamdjd'at ("let them [=the mutashdbih traditions] pass as they came", i. e. transmit them as they are to succeeding generations, without trying to interpret them.) See ibid, p. 12, lines 2-6; p. 40, line 61- p. 41, line 2; Cf. Gimaret, Dieu p. 50.) However, this does not solve the problem of the three possible readings; while some utterances of Ibn Firak seem to support the reading tamanna'ana (see, for instance, Mushkil (Kobert), p. 14, lines 2-3, 11, 15, p. 22, line 3), others support the readings tamna 'ana or tumna'ana (see, for instance p. 12, line 8; p. 22, lines 3-6). For the term mutashdbih see sections 5. 3. - 5. 3. 1. below. (108) See A 'ldm, p. 103. (109) See Mukhtalif, pp. 11-12. (110) See Goldziher, Muslim Studies, vol. 2, pp. 131-132. It is noteworthy that Abfi 'Abd Allih al- Qurtfhbi, who quotes the verses in question with reference to Qur'in 62: 5, cites the version containing zawdmil li'l-asfar instead of zawamil li'l-ash'dr (see al-Jdmi' li-ahkdm al-Qur'dn, Beirut, 1415/1995, part 18, p. 85). Ibn MangGr, in contrast, quotes the version giving zawdmil li'l-ash'dr. Moreover, his source is Ibn Barri who clearly states that the verses ridicule certain reciters of poetry (see Lisdn al- Arab, s. v. zml). 69</page><page sequence="18">VARDIT TOKATLY asfaran ("like an ass carrying books"). This persuasive suggestion may be further substantiated by the presence of both the Qur'anic simile and the appellation zawdmil asfdr in the introduction to the K. al-Intisar li-ahl al- hadith by Abu al-Muzzafar al-Sam'ani (d. 489/1096). (11") Al-Sam'ani there mentions both the simile and the appellation under discussion while enume- rating insults and affronts directed against the ahl al-hadith. Hence, it seems most likely that the pejorative appellation zawamil li'l-ash'ar, originally associated with a specific poetical context, gradually metamorphosed, under the influence of Qur'an 62: 5, into zawdmil asfar. 5.2. Similarity in the traditions discussed by the three authors The corpus of traditions discussed by the three authors is remarkably similar. Generally speaking, many of the traditions resemble each other in essence, inasmuch as they all include anthropomorphic utterances which render them problematic. More specifically, one often finds the same tradi- tions recurring in the three("'2) treatises. It is however noteworthy, that in most cases the authors do not quote exactly the same traditions, but different versions of them. At times they quote fairly similar versions, at others consi- derably different ones. (113) The "recurring traditions" are all problematic, many of them on account of their anthropomorphic nature, the rest for other reasons. The list below contains examples of "recurring traditions" of both kinds. 5.2. 1.

(112) That is to say: the utterances discussed in the A 'ldm are also discussed either in the Mukhalif or in the Mushkil or in both. (113) Moreover, the versions differ from one another in the degree of authenticity ascribed to them. While most versions discussed in the A 'dm are regarded as authentic (in view of the source from which they are cited, namely, al-Bukhlri's Sahih), the authenticity of their parallels (cited in the Mukhtalifand the Mush- kil from various sources) is at times doubted. As far as the present study is concerned, differences between versions may be overlooked, as long as the same problematic utterance is discussed in the three treatises. (114) Needless to say, discussing the same traditions does not necessarily mean interpreting them in the same manner. (See, for instance, Mushkil (.H), pp. 13-14, where Ibn Ffirak explicitly criticizes the interpreta- tion which Ibn Qutayba offers for the first tradition referred to in the list.) 70</page><page sequence="19">THE A 'LAM AL-HADITH OF AL-KHATTABI 1. ...

Al-Khabttii reports that the ahl al-kaldm reject the tradition under discussion, arguing that "Had it been rea- sonably allowable that bewitchment may affect God's Prophet, or may influence him, then there would have been no guarantee that it [= bewitchment] would not affect that which is revealed to him, namely, matters of religion and law, and that would involve deviation of the community from the right way" (lawjdza an ya'malafi nabiyy Aldh al-sihr aw yakana lahufihi ta 'thir lam yu'man an yu'aththira dhalika flm yahda ilayhi min umar al-din wa '1- 72</page><page sequence="21">THE A 'LAM AL-HADITH OF AL-KHATTABI 2.

[According to another version: between two horns of a devil (bayna qarnay shayt.n)]; (136) sharl'a wa-yakanufi dhalika daldl al-umma). The ahl al-kaldm thus try to prove the untenability of the claim that bewitchment may affect the Prophet. Whoever holds it to be reasonably allowable, they assert, must also allow a situation in which the Prophet leads the community astray, instead of guiding it. Such a situation is intrinsically untenable: it contradicts the 'isma theory, which the Mu'tazilis based on the premise that "...prophecy was an act of kindness incumbent on God for the guidance of mankind and must be protected by Him..." (see W. Madelung, "'Isma", EF, s. v.). For an attempt to reconcile the tradition under discussion with the 'isma doctrine see al-Khafaji, Ahmad Shihbib al-Din, Nasim al-riyd~dfi sharh Shifd' al-Qddi 'Iydd Cairo, 1327, vol. 4, pp. 248-254. (133) See A 'Idm, vol. 3, pp. 1618-1620; Mukhtalif, pp. 25-26, 30-31. For this tradition see Gimaret-Monnot, Livre, p. 215, note 70. See also footnote 144 below. (134) See A 'dim, vol. 3, pp. 2141-2143; Mukhtalif, pp. 289-295 (see also ibid, p. 10 where this utterance is contained within a list of nonsensical utterances, allegedly transmitted by the ahl al-hadith). Cf. Wensinck, Concordance, I, p. 384, s. v. jandh; al-.dhi7, K al-Tarbi' wa'I-tadwir, ed. C. Pellet, Damascus, 1955, p. 142 of the Glossary, s. v. dhubdba. (135) See A'Idm, vol. 2, pp. 1475-1477. Unlike the other traditions in the above list this tradition is not inclu- ded in the Sahth. However, what seems to be an abridged version of it (due to similarity in both contents and isndd) did find its way into al-Bukh'ri's work (K. Bad' al-khalq, bab 4). In this abridged version the problematic word "thawranl" is omitted, and thus the tradition can be easily interpreted with reference to the Qur'inic verse 81: 1. Having discussed the abridged version al-Kha.tibi also refers to the more problematic version cited above. This version is discussed also by Ibn Qutayba (see Mukhtalif, pp. 121-123) as well as by Abfi Ja'far al-Tabiwi (d. 321/933) (see Mushkil al- athdr, Hyderabad, 1933, vol. 1, pp. 66-67; cf. also Ibn al-Athir, al-Nihdyaft gharlb al- hadith wa'l-athar, Cairo, 1311, vol. 4, p. 37; al-Albini, Silsilat al-ahadith al-sahiha, Damascus, 1399/1979, vol. 1, no. 124). What is the meaning of this tradition, or, more specifically, how should one interpret the puzzling combina- tion thawrani mukawwarani ("two bulls wound round/ wrapped up")? It may be explained one way or the other, with reference to the text as it is. However, I believe it to be a distorted version of the (much more reasonable) combination thawrdni 'aqirdni ("two castrated/ hamstrung bulls"), in which the adjective 'aqirdni stands for mukawwardni This combination appears in two similar traditions, one of them traced back to Anas and the other to Ka'b al-Abbir. (For the first tradition see AbFi Di'fid al-Tayilisi (d. 203/819 or 204/820!), Musnad, Hyderabad, 1321, p. 281 (no. 2103); Abi Ya'li al-Mawsili (d. 307/919), Musnad, ed.

I1 suggest that the later, distorted, version gradually replaced the original one under the influence of the Qur'nic verse 81: 1. This sug- gestion is supported by a version cited by al-Bazzar (d. 292/905), as quoted by Ibn Kathir (ibid). Al-Bazzir's ver- sion is very similar to the one cited by both al-Khattibi and Ibn Qutayba, but has 'aqirdni instead of mukawwardni. (Unfortunately, I was unable to verify the quotation in the 9 volumes of the Beirut edition of al-Bazzir's Musnad, 1409-1418/1988-1997.) (136) See A 'im, vol. 3, pp. 1508-1509; Mukhtalif, pp. 151-158. Cf.

A tradition according to which Musa slapped the Angel of Death (sakkahu/ latamahu) and rendered him blind of one eye (a'warahu); (139) 5.2.3. I attach great importance to the similarity in the corpus of traditions discussed by the three authors since I hold it to be a direct result of al- Khattlibi's polemical goal. Moreover, I believe that it would not have exis- ted had the A 'lam been an ordinary commentary on the Sahi.h and not a pole- mical treatise. This is because there is a fundamental difference between al-Khattibi on the one hand, and Ibn Qutayba and Ibn Firak on the other, regarding the corpus of traditions to the interpretation of which they commit themselves. Ibn Qutayba and Ibn Furak did not commit themselves (as al-Khattabi did) to writing a commentary on a specific collection of traditions. Their sole commitment was to their defined polemical goals. They were free to incorporate into their treatises every tradition which they found relevant to their purpose, regardless of its authenticity or the written sources in which it could be found. It may be asserted, therefore, that: a. Every tradition which is discussed in the Mukhtalif or the Mushkil is relevant to the (basically simi- lar) aims of these treatises, i. e., is relevant to the polemics between the ahl al-hadith and their opponents. b. Every discussion in the Mukhtalif or the Mushkil is polemically oriented. The situation is less clear in the A 'lam. In his introduction al-Khattabi defines not only a polemical goal but also a specific collection of traditions to be interpreted. Of this collection he selects some problematic traditions, which, numerically, constitute about a quarter of it. Should any commentary on any chosen quarter of the Sahih necessarily resemble the Mukhtalif and the Mushkil? Obviously not, unless the commentator who determines the quarter has in mind the same polemical goals as those of the Mukhtalif and the Mushkil... The similarity in the corpus of traditions discussed by the three authors is significant from yet another aspect: it turns the Mukhtalif and the Mushkil into useful aids for a better understanding ot the A'lam. In other words: a compari- son between al-Khatttbi's words and the corresponding discussions in the Mukhtalif and the Mushkil significantly illuminates the text of the A 'ldm. Such (137) See A 'ldm, vol. 2, pp. 934-935; Mukhtalif pp. 169-176. Cf. Wensinck, Concordance, V, p. 146, s. v. fdsiq; Lane, s. v. fasiq, hayawdn.

(40) However, al-Khattibi's polemical orientation is sometimes so clear that one can do without consulting the two other treatises. For example, while writing about some of the traditions listed above, he expl- citly states that they were denied ("') by such and such opponents. (142) In seve- ral of these discussions, as well as in others, the opponents' arguments are given in detail. (143) One of these cases illustrates the importance of compa- rison between the A'lam, Mukhtalif and Mushkil: an argument very similar to one vaguely ascribed by al-Khattdbi to "deniers" (munkirfn) is found in the Mukhtalif where it is ascribed to al-NazzLm. (44) 5. 2. 4. Most of the traditions in section 5. 2. 1. are discussed by Daniel Gimaret in his excellent monograph Dieu a l'image de l'homme : les anthro- pomorphismes de la sunna et leur interpritation par les thdologiens. Gima- ret's book and the present study, although carried out entirely indepen- dently, (145) remarkably support and complement each other. "Le propos de ce livre, comme son sous-titre l'indique express6ment, est limit6. Il s'agit de rapporter, dans un certain ordre, les anthropomorphismes de la sunna, et d'indiquer pour chacun, synth6tiquement, les interpr6tations qu'en ont propos6 les th6ologiens de l'6poque classique (jusqu'h Suyfti, m. 911/1505)." ('1) Faithful to this statement, Gimaret devotes most of his book to an exhaustive consideration of anthropomorphic utterances in traditions. In the discussion, as well as in the illuminating introduction which precedes it, he pays special attention to several Sunni authors who offered "anti-literal" interpreta- tions of such utterances. Among these authors are the three on which the present study focuses: al-Khattibi, Ibn Qutyaba and Ibn Ffirak. (47) For Ibn Qutayba and Ibn Fuirak Gimaret bases his discussion on the mate- rial found in the Mukhtalif and the Mushkil respectively. As regards (140) Moreover, the fact that a tradition which is discussed in the A 'ldm is also found in the Mukhtalifor in the Mushkil is significant in itself. As was pointed out earlier, its mere presence there indicates that it has to do with the polemics between the ahl al-hadith and their opponents. (141) In most cases al-Khattdbi uses the verb ankara and its derivative forms. At times he uses deriva- tive forms of the verb dafa'a which signifies "to rebut" or "to repel". (142) SeeA 'ldm, vol. 1, p. 639; vol. 2, p. 1500; vol. 3, p. 1618, 1907, 2141 (cf. also vol. 1, p. 523). (143) See, e. g., A'ldm, vol. 1, pp. 696-697; vol. 2, pp. 1476-1477. (144) See the references in footnote 133 above. The rationale underlying the arguments of those who deny the splitting of the moon reminds one of that underlying some common arguments of non-Shi'i authors who deny the theory of "explicit designation" (nassjall). See, for instance, Ibn Taymiyya, Minhdj al-sunna al-nabawiyya, ed. Muhammad Rashid Salim, n. p., 1406/1986, vol. 7, p. 439, line 4- p. 441, line 8; [al- Jurjini], Sharh mawdqif al-'Adud, BOilq, 1266, p. 610, lines 32-33. (145) Gimaret's monograph was published in 1997. However, I obtained a copy only in 1999, when my research on the A 'ldm had already been completed. (146) See Gimaret, Dieu, p. 11. (147) The other authors whose treatises are discussed in the same context are: Ibn Mahdi al-Tabari (d. between 371/981 and 379/989), Abfi Mansir al-Baghdidi (d. 429/1037), Abf Bakr al-Bayhaqi (d. 458/1065), Abi al-Faraj Ibn al-Jawzi (d. 597/1200), Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d. 606/1209) and Jall al-din al-Suyiiti (d. 911/1505). (See ibid, pp. 39-58). 75</page><page sequence="24">VARDIT TOKATLY al-Khattabi the discussion (148) is based on numerous quotations from that author adduced in the third part of al-Bayhaqi's K. al-Asmd' wa'l-sifdt. Gimaret poses the question as to which of al-Khattabi's treatises al-Bayhaqi is referring. Having said that it is impossible to tell, Gimaret tentatively sug- gests that the quotations might have been taken from a certain treatise of al- Khattabi focusing on the names of God, which is explicitly cited by al-Bay- haqi in the first part of the same K. al-Asmd'. (149) Gimaret concludes that in any case he sees no other work among the titles of al-Khatt'bi's treatises that might fit. The contents of the quotations were Gimaret's sole clue as to their source. Having examined these contents he observed the "common factor" between the unidentified work of al-Khattabi and the works of Ibn Qutayba, Ibn Fuirak and several others authors. It is not surprising, therefore, that on loo- king through the titles of al-Khattabi's writings Gimaret did not deem a commentary on the Sahih to be a plausible option. This, however, is preci- sely the case. A comparison between numerous quotations from al-Khattabi adduced in the third part of al-Bayhaqi's Asmd' and the corresponding dis- cussions in the A 'ldm leads to decisive results: it is evident that the A 'ldm is the source of the quotations in the Asmcd'.(5SO) Needless to say, the mere identification of the source from which al-Bay- haqi cites al-Khatttbi is not the main point here. In itself, this identification is no more than a small contribution to Gimaret's study. Yet, it is significant for the present discussion, since it supports my main thesis, the existence of a "common factor" shared by the A'ldm, Mukhtalif and Mushkil. Gimaret's monograph supports my study from yet another aspect. One of the main proofs for my thesis is the similarity in traditions between the A 'lam, Mukhtalif and Mushkil, which I have established by presenting a list of traditions recurring in the three treatises. Gimaret's study significantly enriches this list, by referring to several other treatises in which the same tra- ditions occur. It appears, then, that the A 'ldm is similar in contents not only (148) Ibid, pp. 45-48. (149) Gimaret, who knows the treatise in question only by the titles Tafsir asdmi al-rabb 'azza wa-jalla and Sharh al-asmd' al-husnd, says that it has not survived (see Gimaret, Les noms divins en Islam, Paris, 1988, pp. 18-19). However, the treatise is preserved, and has even been published (ed. Ahnmad Yisuf al- Daqqiq, Damascus, 1404/1984), under the title Sha'n al-du'd'. (For the various titles by which this treatise is known see al-Bitili, al-mndm, pp. 125-129. Cf. also Sha'n al-du'd', p. 45 of the editor's introduction; Gitn- ther, "Der S9fi'itische Traditionalist", p. 68, note 39). Moreover, a comparison between the Sha'n al-du'd' and the quotations from al-Khattibi adduced in the first part of the Asmd' reveals that the Sha 'n al-du 'd' is indeed the source from which al-Bayhaqi quotes al-Khattibi in the third part of his book. One finds in the Sha 'n al-du'd' passages matching all references to the Asmd' in Dieu, p. 46, note 2. (Compare, for instance, Asmd', p. 12, lines 6-7/ Sha'n al-du'd', p. 101, lines 9-10; Asmd', p. 12, lines 7-10 / Sha'n al-du'd', p. 96, lines 9-13; Asmd', p. 13, lines 16-18 / Sha'n al-du'd ', p. 88, lines 4-7; Asmd', p. 20, lines 12-15 / Sha'n al- du 'd', p. 80, lines 9-13).

Some of these (like those of Ibn al-Jawzi and al-Rizi) have a clear polemical orientation. 5.3. Similarity in the terms used by the authors to qualify the traditions they discuss: Some notes on the terms Mutash4bih al-hadith and Mushkil al-hadith In the previous section I have considered the similary in the traditions dis- cussed by the three authors as far as contents are concerned. In the present sec- tion I will deal with another aspect of similarity, namely, the fact that the authors qualify the tradidions by the same technical terms: mutashabih and mushkil. As far as their semantic evolution is concerned, mutashdbih (active parti- cipial noun of the verb tashabaha) and mushkil (act. part. n. of ashkala) are rather similar. The primary meaning of tashdbaha (in the dual form) was "they were like, or they resembled each other". The next step was "they resembled each other so that they became confounded, or confused, or dubious". And finally: tashdbaha (in the singular) signifying "it (a thing, or an affair) was, or became, ambiguous, dubious, or obscure". ('5") In like man- ner, ashkala primarily signified sdra dht shaklin, i. e., "it, or he, was, or became, such as had a likeness or resemblance". The meaning of resem- blance once again evolved into the meaning of confusion, namely, into the well known meaning of ashkala: "it was, or became, dubious, or confu- sed". (52) This basic semantic affinity between mutashdbih and mushkil is remarkable, since it explains why in several of their meanings the terms are occasionally used as synonyms. ("3) In this study I will deal with the term mutashdbih as it is used with refe- rence to hadith. It should be noted, though, that this term is normally dis- cussed with respect to its Qur'anic contexts. It is associated, above all, with the famous Qur'anic verse 3 :7, which distinguishes between dydt muhkamdt and aydt mutashdbihat. This verse, which raises various questions, has been the object of extensive discussions, by both medieval and modern scho- lars. ('4) These discussions are relevant to the present study since - as will (151) See Lane, s. v. tashdbahd and ishtabahd. For an illuminating discussion of the connection between the meanings "resemblance" and "ambiguity" in both mutashdbih and mushkil see Mafdath, pt. 7, p. 145, lines 19-26 (cf. also Asas, pp. 130-131). (152) See Lane, s. v. ashkala; mushkiL Cf. also Kashshdf vol. 2, p. 1551, where the obscurity of that which is named mushkil is explained by: li-dukhalihifl ashkdlihi ("because of its being confused with its likes"). (153) Here I have concentrated on the semantic affinity between the verbs tashabaha and askhala and their corresponding active participial nouns. It is worth mentioning that semantic affinity exists also among other forms derived from the roots sh. b. h and sh. k L This affinity is well illustrated in the classical Arabic dictionaries: in many cases forms derived from sh. b. h are defined by their synonyms derived from sh. k I and vice versa (see Ibn Manzlar, Lisdn al- 'Arab, s. v. sh. b. h and sh. k. L). (154) A useful study on this subjects is L. Kinberg's article "Muhkamdt and Mutashdbihat (Koran 3/7): Impli- cation of a Koranic Pair of Terms in Medieval Exegesis", Arabica, 35 (1988), pp. 143-172. See also B.

Rubin, Between Bible and Qur'dn.: The Children of Israel and the Islamic Self -image, Princeton, 1999, pp. 147-150. 77</page><page sequence="26">VARDIT TOKAIIY be seen - the concept of mutashabih al-hadith is closely related to that of mutasha-bih al-Qur'dn. Moreover, one may even hold the former to be a mere extension of the latter. Each of the terms mutashdbih and mushkil has various definitions as a technical term in the domain of hadith. Yet, one should distinguish between two different contexts in which the terms are used. In the first, mutashaibih and mushkil appear in discussions focusing on isnid and not on matn. Gene- rally speaking, here both terms refer to problematic names of hadith trans- mitters, which people tend to confuse with the names of other transmitters (due to graphic similarity between the names or for other reasons). Various definitions for both terms, illustrated by examples of specific names, may be found in treatises of the genre mustalah al-hadith. ("5) However, the authors of such treatises tend to neglect a totally different context in which both terms often appear. In this other context mutashabih and mushkil are used as qualifiers for traditions in which the matn (i. e. the contents) is problematic. It is this context with which the present study is concerned. In what follows I will present the major contexts in which the terms mutashcbih and mushkil occur in the relevant texts. 5.3.1. The term mutashabih The term mutashtbih apears in what may be considered - as far as we are concerned - the most important paragraph of al-Khattabi's introduction to the A 'ldcm. ("6) In this paragraph he describes the circumstances that urged him to comply with the request to write a commentary on the Sahih, despite his reluctance to do so. He reports that the opponents of the ahl al-hadith use problematic traditions from the Sahih as a means to their end, namely, as a means to defame the entire party of ahl al-hadith. Al-Khattibi qualifies these problematic traditions by the restrictive expression auhadith min mutashacbih al-'ilm (lit.: "traditions which belong to the ambiguous/ equivo- cal knowledge"). The interpretation of these traditions - he immediately goes on to state - is known only to certain distinguished persons among the hadith transmitters who are "firmly rooted in knowledge" ('innamd ya'rifu ta'wilaha al-khawdss minhum al-rcTsikhunafi al-'ilmi). This is a clear allu- sion to Q 3: 7, which says with regard to the mutashdbih part of the Qur'mn: "...wa-mc ya 'lamu ta'wilahu illa Allahu wa'l-rdsikhunafi al-'ilmi yaqulana dmannd bihi kullun min 'indi rabbind... ". As is well known, the vague syn- tactic structure of this verse allows for two significantly different interpreta- (155) For mutashdbih see al-Hakim al-Nisabairi, Ma 'rifat 'ulam al-hadith, Cairo, 1937, pp. 221-238; al- Nawawi, Yahyd b.

For the context see section 3 above. 78</page><page sequence="27">THE A 'LAM AL-HADITH OF AL-KHATTABI tions.(157) Al-Khattabi's statement regarding the mutashabih traditions seems to indicate that - at least in this case - he prefers the inerpretation according to which not only God but also the most erudite scholars may comprehend the meanings of the mutashabih verses. In other words, it seems that al-Khattabi here admits the possibility as well as the legitimacy of attempts to interpret the mutashcbih. ('8) In any case, this is not our main issue. Al-Khattabi's words establish a close connection between the term mutashdbih al-'ilm and the Qur'anic concept of cfyat mutashabihat. The idea of analogy between mutashabih al-Qur'dn and mutashabih al-sunna, which is only implied here, is explicitly expressed by other authors, as will be shown. ("59) Al-Khattdbi's ensuing remarks, both in the paragraph under dis- cussion and in the one following it, are most significant. It emerges from them that he wishes to refute the arguments of his opponents by offering proper interpretations for the mutashabih traditions. That is to say, the desire to supply appropriate interpretations for traditions qualified by the term mutashdbih is a main goal of his treatise. This point should be stressed, since elsewhere in the introduction the traditions which are his object of interpre- tation are characterized by another restrictive expression. Three times in the introduction, both before and after the aforementioned paragraph, al- Khattubi uses the phrase al-mushkil min ahadithihi/ min ahadith hadhM al- kitab ("that which is problematic of its traditions/ in the traditions of this book (i. e. al-Bukhlri's Sahih)").('60) It seems, therefore, that the traditions defined as belonging to mutashabih al-'ilm are either equivalent to those ter- med mushkil, or somehow included in them. In other words: either al- Khattfibi uses mutashctbih and mushkil interchangeably, or in his termino- logy mushkil is an inclusive term while mutashdbih is a more specific one. For reasons discussed below, ("61) I tend to prefer the second option. The discussion of various problems involved with the term mutashabih occupies a considerable part of Ibn Ffirak's introduction to the Mushkil. (162) Moreover, similar discussions occur (though more briefly) twice more in the treatise: a propos some statements of al-Sibghi in his K. al-Asmd' wa'l- (157) See Gimaret, Une lecture, pp. 167-168; Kinberg, "Muhkamdt", pp. 143-144. See also Kashshdf vol. 2, p. 1438a, line 15- p. 1440b, line 2. (158) However, one should also consider al-Khattdbi's comments in A 'l/m, vol. 3, pp. 1824-1826 (apro- pos an exegetical tradition on Q 3: 7). Generally speaking, these comments correspond much more closely to the conservative traditional position than do the statements in the introduction (mainly thanks to al-Khattibi's declaration that part of the mutashdbih is known only to God). It might even seem as if al-Khattdbi were contradicting himself. However, I tend to read a less conservative position between the lines of his comments. (See, for instance, the sentence wa'l-'ulamd' al-rdsikhana fi al-'ilm yaqalana dmannd bihi ittala'nd 'ald kunhi haqfqatihi 'am ld, which does not deny the possibility that the most erudite scholars may understand at least some of the mutashabih).

(") It is thus evident that Ibn Ffirak attached great importance to the elucidation of certain problems relating to the term mutashibih within a treatise mainly devoted to a discussion of anthropomorphic traditions. Ano- ther indication of the major role which the term mutashdbih plays in the trea- tise may be found in some of its titles. As Gimaret remarks, (65') the title K. Mushkil al-hadith wa-baydinihi is only one of many by which Ibn Ffirak's treatise is known. In most of these titles the term mushkil appears as a salient component, but in some of them the term mutashdbih either replaces mush- kil or appears beside it. (166) Ibn Firak's observations regarding the term mutasha-bih and the pro- blems it evokes are most interesting as a whole. However, in what follows I will refer only to points directly relevant to the present study. (167) Ibn Firak's discussion is based on the assumption that the Qur'ainic dis- tinction between muhkam and mutashdbih applies to the sunna as well. That is to say: just as the Qur'anic verses are divided into dyat muhkamat versus dyat mutashdbihat, so the traditions of the sunna are divided into akhbar muhkama versus akhbar mutashdbiha.('68) Ibn Firak characterizes the anthropomorphic traditions on which his treatise focuses as belonging to the mutashabih kind. That is to say, the same traditions described at first by the expression mimma yahimu .awdhiruhd al-tashbih('69) are later referred to as mutashtbih traditions. From the analogy between mutashdbih al-Qur'dn and mutashabih al- sunna Ibn Forak infers that - on the whole - whatever applies to the former applies to the latter, and vice versa.('") He accordingly asserts that the nul- lification of the sunna on account of its mutashabih (logically) leads one to (163) See Mushkil (1H), pp. 163-165. For al-Sibghi and his K. al-Asmd' see Gimaret, Dieu, p. 52, note 1. (164) See Mushkil (H.), pp. 201-204 (= Mushkil (K6bert), pp. 38-41). (165) See Gimaret, Dieu, p. 49, note 2.

(See GAS, I, pp. 610-611; Gimaret, ibid.) (167) Accordingly, I will not discuss Ibn Ffirak's (anti-Hanbali) comments regarding the question whe- ther it is permitted or not to interpret mutashabih al-Qur'dn and mutashdbih al-sunna (cf. Gimaret, Dieu, pp. 49-50). Nonetheless, I would like to observe that he seems to attach the greatest importance to this very ques- tion, dealing with it three times in the treatise (see Mushkil (K6bert) , pp. 12-14; Mushkil (Hl), pp. 164-165; Mushkil (Kobert), pp. 38-39 (= Mushkil (H), pp. 201-203). (168) See Mushkil (Kibert), p. 10, line 19- p. 11, line 3. Ibn FRrak focuses on the mutashdbih of both Qur'in and sunna. He binds both kinds of mutashdbih in expressions like hddhihi al-akhbdr wa'l-dy al- mutashdbiha (ibid, p. 21, line 10); md dhukira min al-mutashabih ft al-Kitdb wa'l-sunna (Mushkil (H.), p. 164, line 3); mutashdbih al-Qur'an wa'l-sunna (ibid, p. 165, line 8). (169) See footnote 94 above. (170) Nevertheless, Ibn Firak points out one aspect in which mutashdbih al-Qur'dn differs from mutashabih al-sunna: while the [accuracy of the] recited text of the Qur'~n is positively declared (alfd? al- tilawa maqta' bihd), the mutashabih traditions are of differing degrees of authenticity. (See Mushkil (Kobert), p. 13, lines 16-18. Cf. also p. 16, line 18- p. 17, line 9; p. 22, line 12- p. 25, line 14, where Ibn Fifrak dis- cusses different categories of traditions and degrees of knowledge attained through them.) 80</page><page sequence="29">THE A 'AM AL-HADITH OF AL-KHATTABI a nullification of the Qur'in (ibtal al-kitab), for the same reason. Similarly, admitting the possibility of interpreting the mutashdbih verses without fal- ling into either tashbih or ta'til("') (logically) reduces one to admit the pos- sibility of interpreting the mutashabih traditions accordingly. (172) The first of the two assertions just mentioned may seem a mere ilzdm. ('3) In other words, it may look as if Ibn Firak is trying to show that the prin- ciples of his opponents (namely: their denial of the sunna because of its mutashabih) can be logically reduced either to absurdity or to unbelief (through denial of the Qur'an). However, some further statements reveal that theoretical ilzdm is not what Ibn Furak is aiming at. According to these statements,("74) there is in fact an analogy between hd'uld'i al-mubtadi'a ("those innovators"), who deny the sunna because of its mutashabih tradi- tions, and al-multhida al-mu'attila ("the apostates/ heretics who divest [God of His attributes] (75)"), who deny the Qur'an on account of its mutashdbih verses. (176) In both cases the mutashibih is only a pretext: the opponents are in fact motivated by the evil thoughts which they harbour against the groups they are attacking (viz. the ashdab al-hadith and the Muslims altogether, res- pectively). Needless to say, this assertion reminds one of al-Khattabi's claim that his opponents use the mutashdbih traditions as a means to defame the entire party of ahl al-hadith. (177) Two other treatises mentioned by Gimaret are relevant to the present dis- cussion, the first simply because of its title. It is the K. Ta'wil mutashdbih al-akhbdr by Abi Mansfir al-Baghdadi (d. 429/1037). (17") Gimaret was not able to obtain a copy of the treatise; however, his assumption that it focuses on anthropomorphic traditions (and verses?) seems to be well-grounded. If this is true, it would serve as additional evidence for the close connection between the term mutashdbih and anthropomorphic traditions. (79) Yet better testimony to this connection may be found in Fakhr al-Din al- Rdzi's K. Asas al-taqdis. (') The second part of this treatise('81) focuses on (171) For the term ta'til (= divesting [God of his attributes]) and its negative connotation see J. van Ess, "Tashbib wa-Tanzib", EP, s. v. (see esp. p. 342). (172) See Mushkil (K6bert), p. 11, lines 11-15 (= Mushkil (H), p. 5, lines 9-15). Cf. also Mushkil (K6bert), p. 39, lines 13-16 (= Mushkil (Ht), p. 202, line 23- p. 203, line 4). (173) For this polemical method see M. Schwarz, "llja' in Mu'tazilite kalim", lOS, 2 (1972), p. 415, note 12. (174) See Mushkil (K6bert), p. 10, lines 16-18; p. 11, lines 16-19. I suggest reading dyatihi instead of ibanati on p. 10, line 18, as in the Hayderabad edition. (175) See W. Madelung, "Mulhid", EP, s. v.; Stroumsa, Freethinkers, p. 5. (176) Some arguments against the Qur'in on account of its mutashdbihdt are ascribed to al-mulhida in Mafdti?, pt. 7, pp. 148-149. See also Stroumsa, ibid, p. 200, note 33; Madelung, ibid. (177) See p. 78 above. (178) See Gimaret, Dieu, pp. 52-53. (179) Al-Baghdidi's words in his Tafsir asmd' Alldh al-husna (translated by Gimaret, ibid, p. 52, note 6) are worth mentioning in any case. Here al-Baghdadi clearly qualifies the anthrophomorphic verses and tra- ditions as mutashabiha. (180) See Gimaret, Dieu, pp. 56-57. The references below are to the Beirut 1993 edition.

It is entitled: al-Qism al-thani ft ta'wil al-mutashabihalt min al-akhbdr wa'l-dydt. Thus, anthropomorphic verses and traditions are once again ter- med mutashdbih. Further, like his predecessor Ibn Fuirak, al-Razi sees fit to elucidate various problems which are involved in the term mutashdbih, and discusses them at length in the two following parts of his treatise. (182) 5.3.2. The term mushkil Nowhere in his introduction to the A'lakm does al-Khattabi create the impression that he wishes to interpret all the traditions in the Sahih. On the contrary, right from the beginning he uses restrictive expressions which make it clear that it is only a definite portion of the work that he intends to interpret, the main restrictive expression being al-mushkil min ahaidithihi/ min ahaidith hddha al-kitab ("that which is problematic of its traditions/ of the traditions of this book"). As we have seen, the text is rather equivocal as far as the question of the exact relation between the terms mushkil and mutashabih is concerned. (183) So far, my observations have referred to al- Khattabi's introduction. Now I shall add some remarks on the treatise itself. The adjective mushkil and the (corresponding) verb yushkilu often occur in the A'lkdm with reference to problematic traditions of various types. (84) Many of these are not of a kind that one would readily qualify as mutashdibih, since they have nothing to do with anthropomorphism, nor with the other problems usually involved with this term. (85"') This seems to sup- port the assumption that al-Khattabi uses mushkil as a general term in which mutashabih is somehow included. However, since the evidence in the text is far from conclusive, and since mushkil and mutashabih may be used as syno- nyms, (16) I still find the other option, of their interchangability, plausible. Finally, it is noteworthy that the verb ashkala appears within the title of one of the manuscripts of the A 'ldm, the complete title being: al-A 'lam sharh ma ashkala ft al-Bukhdri 'ald al-afhtm. (187) The term mushkil recurs in many of the titles by which Ibn Ffirak's trea- tise is known. (88) In some of them mushkil is replaced by mutashabih, or appears alongside it, indeed implying similarity in the meanings of (182) Ibid, p. 127 ff. (183) See p. 79 above. (184) See A 'ldm, vol. 1, p. 205, line 7; p. 730, line 13; vol. 2, p. 848, lines 2, 16; p. 1403, line 11; p. 1440, line 14; p. 1479, line 13; vol. 3, p. 1851, line 8; vol. 4, p. 2352, line 17. (185) See, for instance, the first five traditions referred to in the above footnote. Nevertheless, the last tra- dition referred to (discussed inA 'ldm, vol. 4, pp. 2349-2355) is a typical mutashdbih tradition. For the various issues qualified as mutashabih see Ibn Khaldfin, Muqaddima, part 3, pp. 44-47 (cf. vol. 3, pp. 55-60 of Rosenthal's translation). See also Kinberg, "Muhkamat", pp. 156-157.

In describing the vague parts (i. e. those which correspond to the mutashabih) he uses the adjective mushkil, alongside the adjective khafi ("obscure") and the relative clause yahtdju ild baydn wa-tafsir min ghayrihi ("that which needs elucidation and explana- tion from [something] other than itself'). ('9) To sum up, Ibn Ffirak's trea- tise supplies further evidence for the similarity in the meanings of mushkil and mutashacbih. Moreover, one may even find in it evidence for the syno- nymity of the terms. (192) It is noteworthy that the term mushkil appears also in Ibn Qutayba' s intro- duction to the Mukhtalif. There Ibn Qutayba attacks the ahl al-kaldm for misinterpreting both Qur'an and hadith. "Had they referred the problematic parts of both of them (al-mushkil minhumd) to the people who have know- ledge of them", he asserts, "then the manifest road would have become apparent to them and the way of escape - wide open."('93) Finally it should be noted that mushkil appears within the title of Ibn Mahdi's treatise('94) (at least as reported by Ibn 'Asakir) as a qualifier for traditions concerning the divine attributes (K. Ta 'wil al-ahadith al-mushkildt al-weirida ft al-sifdt). (195) 5.3.3. The data presented above evidently support my argument regarding the similarity in the terms by which the authors under discussion qualify the traditions they treat. Furthermore, the same data may lead to some general conclusions whose importance goes beyond this specific issue. 1. The concept of mutashabih is usually associated with the domain of Qur' an, in which it originated. The data presented above show that the same concept exists also in the sunna, to which it was extended. That is to say: the concept of mutashdbih, originally limited to Qur'anic verses, was extended to the sunna, so as to embrace traditions as well. Expressions like mutashalbih al-Qur'dn wa'l-sunna show the Qur'anic origin of the concept mutashdbih al-sunna. Moreover, discussions of mutashcbih traditions by medieval Muslim scholars reveal that it was not merely the term mutashcbih (189) See footnote 166 above. (190) See Mushkil (Kibert), p. 10, line 19- p. 11, line 3. (191) As is well known, this is exactly how the mutashdbih verses are commonly defined. See Kinberg, "Muhkamdt", pp. 161-163 (cf. also ibid, p. 154, where al-muhkam - the antonym - is defined as alladhi Id yahtdju ild tafsir and as (that which) Id tatawaqqafu ma'rifatuhu 'aid al-baydn). (192) It is noteworthy that in Mushkil (H), p. 202, line 10, the expression mushkil al-Qur'dn clearly refers to mutashdbih al-Qur'dn. In the corresponding place in Kbbert's ed. (p. 39, line 2) one finds mutashdbih al- Qur'dn. (193) See Mukhtalif, p. 15, line 10- p. 16, line 5. (194) See above, footnote 147. (195) See Gimaret, Dieu, pp. 43-44. 83</page><page sequence="32">VARDIT TOKATLY that was adopted; it was the entire concept with all the problems it involved, including the one concerning the legitimacy of attempts to interpret the mutashabih. ("96) 2. The term mutashabih, in its widest sense, may characterize numerous verses and traditions having to do with various problematic issues such as the Day of Resurrection, inspiration, angels, demons, etc. However, in its narrower sense, mutashabih is associated above all with anthropomorphic verses and traditions. The close connection between the term mutashabih and the problem of anthropomorphism is clearly shown in the data presen- ted above. (197) 3. The data evidently indicate a similarity in the meanings of mutashibih and mushkil as qualifiers for problematic traditions. Still, the exact relation bet- ween the two terms is less clear. Strictly speaking, mutashabih is a more spe- cific and a more "loaded" term than mushkil. It is "loaded" because of the Qur'anic concept with which it is associated, and because of its close connec- tion to the problem of anthropomorphism. Mushkil, on the other hand, is a rather "neutral" term. Moreover, since mushkil is a more general term than mutashabih, it may be used to qualify any problematic tradition, regardless of its being mutashdbih or not. Thus, mushkil may qualify traditions which fall under the category of mukhtalif al-hadith (i. e. traditions which are not neces- sarily problematic in themselves, but have become so because of contradictions and inconsistencies between them and other texts). (198) The above distinction between mutashMbih and mushkil refers only to cases in which both'terms are used with precision. However, it seems that often this is not the case. In other words: it seems that writers tend to use them interchan- geably. Evidence for the interchangeability of mutashabih and mushkil was pre- sented above, especially with reference to Ibn Filrak's Mushkil. It is therefore noteworthy that in another treatise of his Ibn F-rak defines al-mutashdbih as "al- mushkil which requires thought and consideration". (99) Further evidence for the synonymity of mutasha4bih and mushkil may be found elsewhere. (00) (196) I have purposely based the discussion above on data found in the A 'dm, Mushkil, Mukhtalifand the trea- tises discussed by Gimaret It should be noted, however, that one may find data leading to the same conclusions in other sources as well. For the first conclusion see, for instance, the discussion in Ibn Khaldfin's Muqaddima refer- red to in footnote 185 above (see esp. p. 44, lines 1-2; p. 46, lines 9-11; p. 47, lines 13-14). (197) Further evidence may be adduced - in this case as well - from other sources. Al-Kirmini, for instance, systematically qualifies anthropomorphic utterances in traditions as belonging to al-mutashabihdt (see al-Kirmani, Sharh, part 5, p. 37; part 10, p. 73; part 18, p. 70; part 23, p. 60; part 25, p. 126). (198) It is not irrelevant to mention here that the literary genre mukhtalif al-hadith, to which Ibn Qutayba's treatise belongs, is occasionally called (especially by modem scholars) mushkil al-hadith. See, e. g., al-Kattni, Muhammad b. Ja'far, al-Risdla al-mustatrafa li-baydn mashhar kutub al-sunna al-musharrafa, ed. Sal.ih Muhammad 'Uwayda, Beirut, 1416/1995, p. 123.

Through the A 'ldm al-Khattabi wishes to refute his opponents' argu- ments regarding mutashabih traditions in al-Bukhari's work. b. The term mutashdbih is closely connected to the problem of anthro- pomorphism. These points, taken together, seem to explain a salient characteristic of the A'Idm: al-Khattabi's sensitivity to anthropomorphic utterances in the S ahih. 5.4. Similarity in the opponents named by the authors All three authors name some opponents of the ahl al-hadith (/al-sunna), both individuals and groups. However, only in Ibn Qutayba's introduction does one find a systematic presentation of the opponents.("') As already mentioned, al-Khattabi's opponents are not clearly defined in his introduc- tion.(22) Yet in the commentary itself he does occasionally name specific groups and individual antagonists. (203) In Ibn Forak's introduction the oppo- nents are repeatedly referred to as ahl al-bida' (/al-mubtadi'al al-mub- tadi 'tn). In one instance Ibn Furak makes it clear that the term refers to "... those who follow vicious caprices (ashab al-ahwd' al-fdnsida)(2') which deviate from the way of the Book (= al-Qur'an) and the sunna, like the Jah- miyya, the Mu'tazila, the Khawarij, the Rafida, the Jismiyya and whoever displays enmity to this party (= aschb al-hadith) among the rest of the people of false caprices (ahl al-ahwd' al-batila)..." .(25) In the following discussion I do not intend to enumerate all the opponents named by the authors, nor systematically compare the works with regad to this point. Instead, I would like to illustrate the similarity in opponents by the cases of two individual adversaries: 'Amr b. Bahr al-Jahiz (d. 255/868/9)('6) and Ishaq b. Ibrahim al-Mawsili (d. 235/850). (207) (201) See Mukhtalif, pp. 2-82. Cf. Lecomte, Le Traitd, pp. ix-xviii; 1-82. (202) See pp. 60-61 above.

Cf. also vol. 1, p. 221; vol. 3, pp. 1533-1534. (204) As is well known, the terms ahl/ ashab al-ahwd' and ahl/ashdb al-bida' are used interchangeably. See Gimaret, Livre, p. 13; J. Robson, "Bid'a", EP, s. v. (205) See Mushkil (Kobert), p. 10, lines 8-10; Gimaret, Dieu, p. 49.

The latter reportedly commenced his book about songs (kitidbuhu fi al-aghani) (29) by reproaching the ashadb al-hadith and inciting against them. He alleged there that the ashdb al-hadith do not understand the meanings of the traditions which they transmit and therefore misinter- pret them.(210) To illustrate this point he discussed the ikhtildf ummati rahma tradition. Later in the text of the A'laIm al-Mawsili is mentioned again in a very similar context, with reference of another tradition. This time al-Khattabi rejects an interpretation of al-Mawsili's for the Prophet's statement (allegedly directed to Fatima): "No grief shall be upon you father after this day" (laysa 'ald abiki karbun ba'da al-yawm). (211) Al- Khattabi does not name the work from which al-Mawsili is cited. Howe- ver, he describes it as a book in which the latter reproaches the ashab al- hadith, alleging that they do not understand the meaning of the statement in question. Al-JAhiz and al-Mawsili appear as opponents of hadith also in the Mukh- talif and the Mushkil respectively. Al-Jlihiz is presented at length, from a hostile point of view, in the heresiographical part of Ibn Qutayba's intro- duction. (212) Ibn Qutayba first points out the sophistic nature of al-JAhiz's reasoning and then accuses him of ridiculing .hadith. In this context he men- tions several traditions, allegedly made an object of mockery by al-J.1hiz. Al- Mawsili is mentioned, not by his name but as "the author of (sdhib) al- Aghanm', in the introduction to the Mushkil. (2") Ibn FiBrak refers to him apropos a discussion of four categories of anthropomorphic traditions. (4) Having alluded to several specific traditions which fall under the fourth cate- gory, namely, unsound traditions which the hadith specialists unanimously reject, Ibn Ffirak mentions that "the author of the Aghdni" criticized similar traditions in his book. Ibn Fiirak observes that there is no point in occupying (208) See A'ldm, vol. 1, pp. 219-220. This tradition is not included in al-Bukhari's Sahih. For the context in which al-Khattabi discusses it see Goldziher, The Zdhiris, pp. 90, 94-95 (Goldziher does not cite al- Khattdbi (whom he calls al-Khitibi) directly from the A 'ldm, but via al-Nawawi's commentary on Muslim's Sahth). Cf. also van Ess, Theologie, vol. 4, p. 659; Stroumsa, Freethinkers, p. 2, note 5; Y. Friedmann, "Dis- sension", Encyclopedia of the Qur'dn, s. v. (forthcoming).

For a discussion of this claim see section 5. 1. 2. above. (211) See A'lIdm, vol. 3, p. 1794. For the tradition cf. Wensinck, Concordance, s. v. karb; Zaghliil, Mawsa'a, vol. 6, p. 842.

Needless to say, there is a striking similarity in the contexts in which sdhib al-Aghdcn is mentioned in the Mushkil and the A'Idm. 5.5. Did al-KhattibI know Ibn Qutayba's Mukhtalif? The similarity between the A'lam and the Mukhtalif makes one wonder whether al-Khattabi knew Ibn Qutayba's work and was actually influenced by it. The relevant data are as follows: 1. Al-Khattabi does not mention the Mukhtalif in the A 'Idm. However, he cites Ibn Qutayba (whom he calls al-Qutaybi)(215) from an unknown source, with reference to a lexical problem. (216) 2. It is evident that al-Khattdbi was acquainted with some of Ibn Qutayba's works. He often mentions Ibn Qutayba's Gharib al-hadith in his own Gharib al-hadith. (217) He also refers there to Ibn Qutayba's Isldh al-ghalat. (218) 3. Audebert, having studied al-Khattabi's Baydn i'jaz al-Qur'an, found remarkable similarities between that treatise and Ibn Qutayba's Ta'wil mushkil al-Qur'an. (219) Here too al-Khattabi does not mention Ibn Qutayba' s treatise which seems to be his source of inspiration. Audebert suggests that al-Khattabi did so deliberately because, like other prominent Shafi'i scho- lars, he was hostile towards Ibn Qutayba. Another option discussed by Audebert is that it was not Ibn Qutayba's work which al-Khattabi used, but a certain treatise by Abui Bakr al-Anbari written against it. Still, Audebert does not rule out the possibility that al-Khattabi was not hostile to Ibn Qutayba, but was in fact favourably inclined towards him as a partisan of sunna and hadith. The resemblance between the case studied by Audebert and the one stu- died here is suggestive. In two independent instances there are good grounds for suspecting al-Khattabi of deliberately concealing his indebtedness to Ibn Qutayba. Considering all data presented above I tend to believe that al- Khattbi was acquainted with the Mukhtalif. He probably refrained from referring to it due to the enmity between Shafi'ism and Hanbalism. 6. The thesis that the polemical goal of the A 'ldm had a decisive influence on its contents appears to be borne out by two findings: first, the similarity between the works of al-Khattabi, Ibn Qutayba and Ibn Ffirak; second, the substantial difference between al-Khattabi's work and other commentaries (215) AI-Khattdbi refers to Ibn Qutayba by this nisba also in Gharib, vol. 1, p. 50 (note that on p. 48 he calls him Ibn Qutayba AbCl Muhammad 'Abd AllUb b. Muslim). Cf. also Lecomte, Le Trailt, p. 24. (216) See A'ldm, vol. 1, p. 322. I did not find the utterance attributed to Ibn Qutayba in his Gharib al- hadith (Beirut, 1408/1988) nor in the Mukhtalif. (217) See, for instance, Gharib, vol. 1, p. 48; p. 50; vol. 2, p. 81; p. 243; p. 536. (218) [bid, vol. 1, pp. 309, 314. For this treatise by Ibn Qutayba see GAL, S, 1, p. 186. (219) See Audebert, al-Hattabi, pp. 100-101. 87</page><page sequence="36">VARDIT TOKATLY on the Sahih. Although the A 'lm is commonly listed among the commen- taries on the Sahih it in fact belongs to a series of polemical reatises reflec- ting the continuous struggle between the ahl al-hadith and their opponents. Furthermore, the polemical goal of the A 'lam offers the best explanation for its characteristics. It seems to account for al-Khatttbi's lack of interest in the framework of the Sahih despite its great importance. Al-Khatttbi's main purpose was not to write a commentary on al-Bukhari's work, but to defend the hadith and the ahl al-hadith. He therefore used the Sahih as a vessel from which to draw problematic traditions and not as a work requiring considera- tion and commentary in its entirety. The polemical goal also seems to account for al-Khatttbi's sharp reaction to anthropomorphism. Generally speaking, this reaction may be explained by the fact that anthropomorphic utterances in both Qur'an and sunna were a major bone of contention bet- ween the ahl al-hadith and their opponents. More specifically, it sustains the assumption that al-Khattibi was aiming to refute the claims of the mutakal- limun, who were the severest critics of tashbih.
