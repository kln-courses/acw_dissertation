Supremely elusive, essentially omnipres ent, and universal, the subject is all the more fascinating for these qualities, and Alessandro Nova, as much through science and method as clarity and sensitivity, is able to confront it in this rich, subtle, and most exciting work, which has already been pub lished in Italian and in German. Wind and air challenge the mimetic function that art is credited with, since the winds are invisible bodies, according to the definition given by Lucretius: though physical, they are impal pable and transparent and perceptible only in their effects. This material invisibility ex plains why, in every culture, they have been given an intermediate position, serving as a hinge between the physical and the meta physical, why they have been perceived as cosmic principles, deities, or expressions of divinity, while remaining closely linked to the most tangible manifestations of nature, its fecundity, its vitality, and its dangers. This study develops in three parts, dedi cated to the iconography of the wind, to the relation between representation and meta phor, and to the wind as sign. It shows how, in Western culture, its reality has been ap prehended from four main standpoints: by naming the wind and representing it in an anthropomorphic or conventional fashion, by measuring and explaining it, and, espe cially, by trying to render it in its natural appearance, and by making use of it as sym bol, metaphor, and allegory. Nova's investi gation begins with this first approach and its iconographic expression through the two mythological characters that were widely used to lend the winds a body, a name, and a history in Greek and Roman art and liter ature. First of all was Boreas, who was often represented on Greek vases and reappears in painting from the sixteenth century on, always bearded, occasionally portrayed with snake-shaped legs. He was guilty of the rape of young Orithyia and was sometimes de picted by the Greeks as threatening Ulysses. Then comes his brother Zephyr, the young and beautiful lover who, together with Iris, draws the carriage of Venus, as can be seen on reliefs from Tarento, or chases Hyacinth, eventually causing his death, and transports Psyche through the air, according to the famous tale by Apuleius, and, most particu larly, is wedded to the nymph Chloris, who is then impregnated and metamorphosed into Flora, as masterfully interpreted by Sandro Botticelli after Ovid's Fasti. The au thor recalls the careful science of detail with which the Florentine painter, who was the first to really bring back to life the artistic interpretation of this mythological incarna tion of the winds, managed to translate the fertile breath of the wind heralding the springtime in the shape of beams issuing from the mouth of the blue-bodied aerial god to reach the nymph's mouth, whence immediately spring forth the first flowers that she will spread widely in her new state. This very same Zephyr can also be found on the left of The Birth of Venus, holding in his arms a young woman who is usually identi fied as Aura (on account of her wings and her breathing) and associated with roses and with the fertility of Chloris turned into Flora, but Nova rightly suggests she should be connected with Iris (in accordance with the above-mentioned reliefs), which induces us to imagine a fusion of these different characters. As early as the fifth century BCE, the winds were also represented in the shape of more abstract personifications, not rooted in a narrative, whether it be under the ap pearance of chubby blowing heads or as male characters fitted with wings and horns, sometimes associated with horses or charac terized by attributes that allow us to distin guish and identify them, as in the reliefs of the Tower of the Winds in Athens and, much later, in the frescoes of the Vatican Tower of the Winds. However, more anony mous heads or winged figures have pre vailed and been broadly disseminated in Christian art, and they are still often to be found in the Renaissance period, in Ra phael and Pellegrino Tibaldi's works, for instance. The winds were also denoted through symbolic images within cosmological pat terns. The most outstanding case is that of two thirteenth-century miniatures from the Liber divinoram operum that were intended to illustrate two of the visions of Hildegard von Bingen: a set of animal heads that symbolize the role of cosmic winds in the motion of celestial spheres and their influence on the earth and mankind. This alliance between meteorology and cosmology may pertain to the theory that winds originate in the zo diac, a theory rejected by Leonardo, among others. The latter provided us with a most innovative system of notation of the winds, in handwritten pages where he develops a set of conventional graphic signs to describe and analyze the motion of the winds in the shape of circles, spirals, or snakelike figures, with curved or parallel lines to indicate the various degrees of turbulence and transpar ency of the air. With Leonardo, we stand midway between a concern for the theorization of meteoro logical phenomena and an attempt to ob serve them at close range, which should have given birth to some chapters about the motion of the winds, as an introduction to his never written treatise on bird flight. The scientific study of winds, in fact, goes back to antiquity, to a disciple of Plato, and even more to Aristotle, who tried to explain their origin by making them dependent on ter- , restrial exhalations and their rising and fall ing movements. This theory was still in cur rent usage in Egnazio Danti's Anemographia in 1581 and was not called into question until the seventeenth century, by Francis Bacon and by Rene Descartes. Aristotle also paid particular attention to numbering the winds and arranging them according to their orientations on a compass rose that featured, according to various authors, be tween eight and twenty-four, possibly up to thirty radii; it would provide a basis for anemoscopes to give a precise indication of the directions of the winds and their identi fication. Such instruments already appeared in antiquity, in particular, at the top of the above-mentioned Tower of the Winds in Athens, and they commanded a keen scien tific interest at the end of the Renaissance, as the works and achievements of Danti am ply testily. Leonardo da Vinci made another major contribution that Nova closely examines: his interest in the phenomenal dimension of the problem—in other words, the mimetic representation and the painstaking descrip tion of atmospheric phenomena—which resulted in a set of about ten drawings of the Flood and its progression. We can relate this to pages written in 1515 where he de picts the fury of the winds and the terror that strikes humankind in such circum</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS: MOREL ON NOVA 459 stances. Even before Leonardo, there had been attempts to figure in the most lifelike and suggestive manner the movements of sails, of hair, of foliage, or even of clouds in the wind or in rapid motion. This can be seen particularly in the mythological favole of Botticelli, the Primavera, and still more in The Birth of Venus, with forerunners that could be traced back to earlier Flemish painting and its clouds, but it emerges even more conspicuously in the art theory of the time, first and foremost in a passage from Leon Battista Alberti's De pictura. With the fabric of clothes pressed against the limbs or shaken and blown up by the wind, hair flying, the wind is granted a truly aesthetic function, according to Nova, in that it con tributes to the animation, the variety, the plausibility of the storia, and the exaltation of art, by adding grace to the figures and motions and by displaying the talent of the artist who can represent the unrepresent able, as Pliny the Elder had said of Apelles. On the whole, this concern for the mimetic rendering of the effects of the wind progres sively came to prevail at the end of the Re naissance, to the detriment of the language of personifications, of which the above-men tioned decoration of the Vatican Tower of the Winds is one of the last striking in stances. As a distinguishing feature of this evolution, cloudy masses were substituted for the conventional chubby-cheeked faces of a then millenary tradition in the corners of a map of the earth by Abraham Ortelio. Moreover, as Nova points out, this demand for observation and plausibility seems to have encouraged the development of a met aphoric approach of the winds as early as the sixteenth century, and even more so in the next century. Another chapter of this study, the longest in the book, brings us the emblematic ex ploitation of the wind, or at least its sym bolic, metaphoric, and allegorical usage, which turns the wind into the figure of something else. This usage seems to be threefold, pertaining to a metaphysical sphere, to the field of politics, or to the moral and psychological sphere that has been the paramount concern of modern day artists. The first one is mainly confined to antiquity and Christianity in the Middle Ages. It comes within the sphere of a funer ary, perhaps even soteriological dimension; beyond the age-old belief in the power of the winds to carry away and scatter the soul at the time of death, they seem to have an overriding function as a psychopomp. Their representation in the shape of personifica tions on the corners of sarcophagi signals that they are meant to carry the soul away, up to heaven, as is precisely figured in the form of a consecratio or an imperial apotheo sis in an ivory relief from the fifth century. What emerges from this is a close relation ship between wind and soul, which is also present in the Judeo-Christian tradition, where the spirit of God is assimilated to a life-giving breath. But if the wind as breath can be linked to the soul, the spirit, and life, it is also the symbol and harbinger of a theophany, seeing that the winds and storms herald or provide a background for the divine visions of the prophets, particu larly those of Elijah and Ezekiel. Therefore, the winds personified become natural asso ciates of the angels, all the more so as they are also fitted with wings and can move with similar ease, as both Saint Paul and Pseudo Dionysius the Areopagite pointed out. Saint John thus subjects the winds to the power of the angels, and a medieval commentator on Saint John's Revelation identifies winds and angels fully, as is illustrated by two tenth century miniatures. It is within the same New Testament con text that the theme of the ship of God's Church first appeared and became wide spread. Imperiled by storms and devilish winds that symbolize heresies and schisms, the ship withstands such assaults with the help of Providence. From Giotto's Navicella to the wall decorations of the loggia in the Tower of the Winds, this very image has en dured, although the decorations executed in the Vatican under the guidance of Danti for Pope Gregory XIII place it in an alto gether different perspective. The measure ment of the winds by the anemoscope and their submission to Providence as seen in the paintings in the Tower of the Winds are here associated with the measurement of time intrinsic to the reform of the calendar and with the description of the Italian terri tory developed in the gallery of geographic maps—all of which is meant to celebrate the primacy and command of the Catholic Church over time and space. During the Renaissance, it is mainly on a metaphoric, moral, and psychological level that the wind turns into a figure of some thing else, within the framework of repre sentations that are nevertheless ever more lifelike and naturalistic, as we have already noted. Leaving aside a few precedents in Latin literature where nature is already a reflection of the feelings, this is really the time when the connection was made be tween the winds and the idea of fickleness and fortune, as is illustrated by many an al legorical personification and emblematic image, or when it is a reference to the hard ships of life, to violence and war. Three tell ing examples demonstrate these ideas. In the portrait of a couple by Lorenzo Lotto, a stormy and windy landscape in the back ground obviously hints at the difficulties these two characters may have encountered, but it is offset by an inscription and symbols that refer to the solidity of the bonds of marriage and to faithfulness. In the fore ground of another stormy landscape where a man and a woman are exposed to the bru tality of the elements, the portrait of a man by Altobello Melone may be less direcdy connected with the theme of war than with a famous passage from Inferno, commented on further in the study, where Dante envi sions the circle of the lecherous, guilty of carnal passion (particularly Paolo and Fran cesca), who are molested by raging winds. Facing the wind, his right hand resting on the handle of his sword, the man seems de termined to confront these torments. The rebirth of the lopped-off tree may be con strued as a sign of hope for a broken or thwarted passion. The message is less per sonal in an allegory by Giovanni Cariani where Fortune seems to stand between the contrary winds of war and peace, granting protection to the latter, to the benefit of Venice, which can be seen in the distance. This alliance between mimetic representa tion and the metaphor of feelings produced two masterpieces in the next century, quite justifiably highlighted by the author, who links them both to the drawings and writ ings of Leonardo. In the two pictures by Peter Paul Rubens illustrating the tragic story of Hero and Leander, some details of which indeed bring to mind the Tuscan art ist's drawings of the Flood, what captures, perplexes, and upsets the viewer is not so much the true-to-life description of the storm as the abolition of margins in the pic ture. Let us add to this observation that the painting is dedicated as much to the story of Leander's death and to the dramatic and impressive depiction of the storm as to the latter's metaphoric power to evoke the de spair of Hero, who can be seen throwing herself into the waves on the right of the picture. With the more or less similar tale of Pyramus and Thisbe, painted in 1651, Nico las Poussin supplemented Ovid's narrative with a storm that enabled him to display his skills in rendering atmospheric phenomena. The small-scale second version of the pic ture that he painted confirms, by the elimi nation of its protagonists, that his primary concern was the imitation of the effects of impetuous winds: to contend with Apelles, says Andre Felibien, and with Leonardo, Nova adds. To support his contention, Nova points to the history of the French edition of the Treatise on Painting, which was origi nated by the artist and the patron of Pyra mus and Thisbe, and, more precisely, to one of its illustrations, a figure fighting against the wind, designed by Poussin, which he used in both versions of the painting. For all that, he does not leave out the cry of Thisbe or the fear of the travelers and shep herds, of which the stormy sky, streaked with lightning, can be viewed as an amplifi cation. This metaphoric quality conferred on the raging elements does not disappear in the seascape, a pictorial genre free of all mytho logical and narrative references, which was so often treated by Dutch painters of the seventeenth century. Apart from a few iso lated precedents of storms in Italian paint</page><page sequence="3">maze found here, we can only look forward to the next step with the utmost curiosity. 460 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 3 ing—in particular, a picture by Palma il Vecchio and Paris Bordone, praised by Gian Paolo Lomazzo—it was indeed Flemish artists that opened up the way to sea scapes, particularly Pieter Brueghel and Joos de Momper the Younger, with their ships threatened by raging seas and, as a counterpoint, a promise of salvation on the horizon. These shambolic seascapes are thus fraught with dangers, anxieties, and hope, a psychological or meditative inflection still present in Dutch painting, even if it seems to pertain to a form of "rhetorical naturalism"—that is, to an ex ercise in style that implies variations on a theme and the intertextual presence of an cient and modern literary sources. These include, for the cultured viewer, a wealth of rhetorical, poetic, and philosophical images, together with underlying references to typi cal situations rather than specific events. The struggle against the maritime element was a permanent feature in the lives of Dutch tradesmen of the time. A blown-out lantern could symbolize the disappearance of points of reference, and ships in distress, viewed from the shore, might hark back to a topos drawn from Lucretius. The aesthet ics of the sublime that became widespread in the eighteenth century led to a renewal of this artistic genre, in which scenes of shipwreck lose all ethical, emblematic, or allegorical connotations. The peril is par tially alleviated through the example of shipwrecked people who have survived, and tragedy is thus aesthetically kept at a dis tance. Nature, on the whole, is turned into an immense or fearsome spectacle, which provokes contrasting feelings and depends on the privileged standpoint of the viewer and his subjectivity. In the next century, the representation of air and wind constituted, in J. M. W. Turn er's eyes, the toughest challenge for paint ers. The "phenomenal" dimension of the wind was apprehended in yet a different manner, since the artist, rather than repro ducing the appearances it generates, ex plored its transparent or diaphanous sub stance, at the border between visible and invisible, where the elements melt into a sort of primeval chaos. It was not the mix ing and merging of air, water, and light that John Constable sought to render in count less studies, but the ephemeral and change able character of atmospheric conditions, where the clouds play with the motions of the air and the variations in light. The reli gious dimension does not seem to be any less present in Constable's paintings, al though in a most subdued manner, while it found a new ground for more outspoken expression among American landscape art ists. Here, the spectacle of nature—which lent itself to a meditation on death and the destiny of humankind in German Romantic painting, specifically with Caspar David Friedrich—turns into the awe-inspiring ex pression of divine creation within a tran scendental vision of nature, to which is added the recurrent theme of the promised land. Only at the end of the century did this sacred and religious dimension of the "American sublime" yield to the expression of more despondent and mysterious states of mind. With twentieth-century art, the reflection thus developed refocuses more closely on the specific question of the wind, drifting away from the more general problem of landscape painting. Victor Sjostrom's film The Wind and the particularly insightful analysis that Nova gives us show that the symbolic and metaphoric dimension of the wind has made its way through the silent movies, and it can now be found in contem porary art, particularly in Bill Viola's works. Yet there is a sea change in the perspective that twentieth-century sculptors seem to have introduced, whether the wind sets the work in motion, in the case of Alexander Calder's mobiles or George Rickey's kinetic sculptures, or it belongs to the work as such and is materialized through various effects, especially acoustic, as in Eduardo Chillida's Peines del viento or in Walter de Maria's land scape installation Lightning Field. This book does not purport to be exhaus tive and does not constitute a catalog, since the author acknowledges it as the first stage of an even more ambitious project bearing on a virtually infinite material, which calls for subsequent research. Even before con sidering enlarging the study to other cul tural horizons, briefly mentioned in the conclusion, which would bring us back to the metaphysical and cosmic dimension of the wind, some topics, hardly touched on, could be more closely examined, such as the place of the wind in treatises on archi tecture, from Vitruvius to Vincenzo Scamozzi, and the grottoes or underground conduits in some villas of Tuscany and the Veneto. Other examples might broaden the scope of investigation, like the ephemeral apparati of princely feasts, the female figures of Pre-Raphaelite painter John William Wa terhouse, or Impressionist painting, where the wind combines with the light, while its metaphoric value is both subdued and re newed. Every reader will feel the urge to connect it to whatever is inspired by his chance encounters, the orientations of his intellectual pursuits: the exceptional rich ness and interest of this highly individual work, remarkably constructed and dealing with a fundamental question in the history of art, consist of developing, in a most fasci nating thematic field, a set of detailed and lucidly explained data and a body of reflec tions both subtle and thorough. It thus lays a solid and stimulating basis indispensable to a full-scale interdisciplinary, transhistori cal, and anthropological investigation.
