<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Anthropologist NEW SERIES VOL. 30 CCTOBER-DECEMBER, 1928 No. 4 SUMMARY REPORT OF FIELD WORK AT ACOMA BY LESLIE A. WHITE DATA for this report were secured at Acoma during the summer of 1926 and a portion of the summer following.' Limited time necessarily confines us to major points and general outlines of Acoma culture. Comparative references to other Keresan pueblos are based upon the published data for Laguna, Cochiti, and Zia, and upon my unpublished field notes for Santo Domingo, San Felipe, Sant' Ana, and Zia. Acoma is the westernmost of the Keresan pueblos, lying about eighty miles west of Albuquerque. Acoma, together with Laguna, occupies a position about midway between the Tewan and Keresan villages of the Rio Grande, and Zufii and the Hopi pueblos of the west. The western dialect of the Keres language, represented by Acoma and Laguna, may be understood only with some difficulty by the eastern section, comprising Santo Domingo, San Felipe, Sant' Ana, Cochiti, and Zia. Acoma is the only one of the southwestern pueblos that has not changed its site since the arrival of the Spaniards in 1539. Within the past fifty or sixty years, however, two summervillages, Acomita and McCartys, have been established in a valley about twelve miles to the north, where they have irrigated farms. Here the bulk of the population, which numbers between six and seven hundred, lives for the greater part of the year. All important ceremonies, however, take place at Old Acoma, and everyone goes there for these occasions. Some of the families spend the winter at Old Acoma; others do not. But every family maintains a house at Old Acoma and at either Acomita or McCartys. 1 This paper was read at the meeting of the American Anthropological Association at Andover, December 28, 1927. It has since been read by Dr. Elsie Clews Parsons, to whom the writer is deeply indebted for constant assistance, advice, and encourage- ment in his work in the Southwest. 559</page><page sequence="2">560 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 There has been comparatively little contact with the whites, with whom they are very unfriendly, and very few inter-pueblo intermarriages have occurred. With Laguna, their closest neighbor, there have been unfriendly relations for many years. Officers.-There are two classes of officers at Acoma. The first consists of the cacique, who is the chief par excellence, a war priest and two lieutenants, ten principales, ten "little chiefs," and three cooks, who serve the war priests. These officers constitute the real authority and control of the pueblo; they are the keepers of the esoteric lore and paraphernalia, guardians of the old customs and traditions, and administrators and executors of the social life of the tribe. The second group consists of a governor, two lieu- tenant governors, three Bickales (Fiscales), and a water boss. This group might be considered as a secular arm of the first, and is of post-Spanish origin. The duties of the governor and his men are: supervision of roads and ditches, representation of the pueblo in dealings with the United States government and with white organizations, such as traders and churchmen, preservation of peace and order, etc. The cacique serves until death, when he is succeeded by an Antelope man chosen by his clansmen. The cacique appoints all other officers who serve for one year, except the principales, who hold office for life. The medicine societies, however, exercise the right of veto, and may substitute a man of their own choice for the one selected by the cacique. Acoma custom at this point resembles closely the Keresan pattern. Acoma personnel differs from the eastern Keres, however, in the following respects: (1) At Acoma the cacique is always a member of the Antelope clan; this is not found in any other pueblo. (2) There are three war priests at Acoma; in the eastern villages there are only two, who represent the mythical war-god twins. (3) The three cooks who serve the Acoma war priests are not found at other Keresan villages. (4) The g'owatcani, who are the war priest's helpers on the Rio Grande, are not found at Acoma, although the ten "little chiefs" bear a rather close formal, but not functional, resemblance. (5) The group of capitani, who, on the Rio Grande, are the governor's helpers, are not found at Acoma. Thus one sees a number of formal divergences at Acoma, but</page><page sequence="3">WHITE] FIELD WORK AT ACOMA 561 on the whole the functions of the officers at Acoma resemble the eastern pueblos quite closely. The clan at Acoma is primarily an exogamous kinship group; very few ceremonial functions are associated with clan organiza- tion. The cacique is always a member of the Antelope clan, which is regarded as more important than the other clans. And the Corn clan has a masked ceremony, which is given every five years. Formerly the Parrot and the Pumpkin clans led the salt-collecting expeditions. But here clan function in ceremonialism ceases. There is no relationship between the curing societies and par- ticular clans, and all officers other than the cacique are selected without reference to clan affiliation. Clanspeople help each other atthousebuildings and at harvest. And at Old Acoma, the houses are grouped somewhat according to clan. The kachina cult.-Masked dances figure prominently at Acoma. There are about eighty katsina reported from this village, which is more than the number reported from any other Keresan pueblo, suggesting Zufii influence. About twenty percent of these katsina live at Acoma (or near there) rather than at the mythical home of these spirits, Wenimats, which indicates considerable local elaboration of the cult. A number of these masks are ob- viously rather recent importations from Zufii. There are five kivas at Acoma instead of the two which prevail on the Rio Grande, or the six at Zufii. (Bandelier reported six kivas at Acoma, but only five exist now.) With each kiva is associated a masked dancer group; all of the men and older boys in the pueblo belong to one or another of these kivas. A son joins the kiva of his father. There is a formal initiation of children, both boys and girls, at which time they are whipped by a katsina in the head estufa. In the Rio Grande villages there is no formal initiation--children are not whipped-and girls and women are kept in ignorance, theoretically, of the masked dancers. Acoma resembles the West, then, in the matter of initiation. The system followed by the kachina organization at Acoma differs somewhat from the plan followed by the Rio Grande villages. At Acoma there is one big summer dance for rain at which time two kiva groups participate, one dancing two days and the</page><page sequence="4">562 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST I(N. s., 30, 1928 other the two days following. The dance is not preceded by a retreat by one of the medicine societies, which is rather anomalous, since this is the practice at the eastern pueblos. Among the eastern villages, too, only one kiva dances after a retreat. But there are usually several dances held during the summer for rain. At Acoma there is a great ceremony held at the time of the winter solstice, when many katsina dance in the "mixed" dance, or G'aiya. At this time, also, the koBictaiya come. The koBictaiya are spirits to whom all of the Keresan peoples pray. But it is only Acoma that they are represented by masked dancers. Here also is to be found the most complete and detailed information concerning these spirits. At the eastern villages, informants in- variably assert that the terms k'atsina, shiwanna, and k'oBictafya are equivalent in meaning. In spite of this affirmation, however, a distinction is to be found in the use of these words. K'atsina and shiwanna are uged interchangeably for the masked dancers and for the spirits which they represent. But koBictaiya is never used in this connection. The medicine societies have some little anthropomorphic stone figures which they use in their curing ceremonies which are called koBictaiya, but never katsina or shiwanna. Although the origin of this concept is quite obscure, Acoma gives us by far the most tangible and complete data regarding the koBictaiya. At Acoma there are two masked ceremonies that are not found at any other Keresan village, but which resemble rather closely some Zufii ceremonies (the Kyanakwe ceremony). One is a ceremony called Gaiyabaitsani ("katsina are going to fight us") which re-enacts the mythical battle between the first pueblo people and the katsina. The other is a ceremony belonging to the Corn clan, which features a boy, wearing only a mask, who enters the pueblo, accompanied by other masked beings, and lights several fires from a glowing torch that he carries. He also bears with him a jug of water and a piece of charred wood, both of which are divided and. distributed among all the houses of the town. These dances are performed at intervals of five years. At Acoma, also, there are some masked personages called G'omaio- wish, which bear a very close resemblance to the K'oyemshi or</page><page sequence="5">WHITE] FIELD WORK AT ACOMA 563 mudheads of Zufii. They are called "scouts" and appear with the k'atsina. They are not found on the Rio Grande. The medicine cult.-There are three medicine societies at Acoma, the Flint, Fire, and kaBina. It is said that there used to be many more, such as Giant, Shiwanna, Ant, Shikameh, etc. In membership, theory of disease, ritual, and paraphernalia of curing, the Acoma curing societies resemble those of the other Keresan villages quite closely. Membership is open to both men and women and to children old enough to be entrusted with a secret. Members are recruited from patients who have been cured, although in recent years new members have frequently been impressed by "trespass." Disease is caused by witches (kanad- yaiya) who either inject such objects as sticks, thorns, stones, or even snakes into a person's body, or else steal his heart and make off with it. A witch is ari evil spirit that may assume almost any form-an owl, a donkey, a cat, a koshare, or a human being, even a member of one's own family. Cure consists in removing the objects fromr the patient's body, which the medicine-men ac- complish chiefly by sucking, although eagle wing-feathers are sometimes used. If the heart has been stolen, several medicine- men arm themselves and go out to wrest it from the witches. They nearly always have a severe struggle, in which doctors are not infrequently injured, but they always come back with the heart. The heart is a ball of rags, in the center of which is a ker- nel of corn-the patient's heart. If this is good, then the patient will recover; but if it is blemished, then the patient will die. The patient is given the heart to swallow in either case. The medicine societies own or rent houses for their ceremonies. Paraphernalia consist first in a corn-ear fetish (the milli of Zufii). This is an ear of corn covered with native cotton and strings of beads, and decked with parrot and eagle feathers. At Acoma it is called honani (which is the Hopi term for badger, an important medicine animal) but at other Keresan villages it is called iarriko. I cannot account for Acoma usage in this case. The honani, or iarriko, symbolizes the "mother of all the Indians," Iatiku, and is to be regarded as the badge par excellence of the medicine-man. Each doctor receives one at the time of his initiation; at death</page><page sequence="6">564 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 it is returned to the head-man of the society. Other items of paraphernalia are: medicine bowls made of pottery and decorated with cloud, rain, and lightning symbols, with bears, lions, and snakes; large flint knives, which are used by the doctors when they go out to fight witches; bear paws which are sometimes worn when a doctor massages a patient, and always worn by the doctors when they go out to fight witches; bear-claw necklaces and whistles of bear-bone are also worn; eagle wing-feathers are used to whip the disease away; a small quartz crystal is used in diagnosis; it gives a medicine man second sight and enables him to locate the injected objects in the patient's body or to locate a witch who might be lurking about; small stone figures of the ani- mal medicine-men-the bear, mountain lion, badger, etc.,-and of Masewi and Oyoyewi (the twin war gods) and of Paiyatyamo. Curing ritual consists of singing, praying, smoking, and dancing; mixing of herb medicine in the bowls; sprinkling of patient, altar, and paraphernalia, doctors, and spectators with medicine water, shaken from the eagle plumes; diagnosing the patient with the rock crystal; massaging the patient with hands rubbed with ashes (ashes are used as a prophylactic against witches); suck- ing out the disease objects; whipping the sickness away with eagle feathers; administering medicine either internally or externally or both. The medicine-men are always guarded by the war chiefs dur- ing curing ceremonies. A rather significant difference in paraphernalia appears from a comparison of Acoma with the eastern villages: Acoma uses wooden slat altars in curing ceremonies which are called yaBai- cini. Among the eastern Keres, a similar slat altar is used by the medicine societies at the solstice ceremonies and presumably during retreats, but they are not used in curing ceremonies. Moreover, they are called aitcin rather than yaBaicini. For cur- ing ceremonies, the eastern Keres have a meal painting, which they call yaBaicini, upon which are laid out figures of animals, of Masewi and Oyoyewi (the twin war gods) of Paiyatyamo, of koBictaiya, etc. The reason for this difference is far from clear. The following hypothesis seems rather plausible. The use of the</page><page sequence="7">WITE] FIELD WORK AT A COMA 565 slat altar by the Keresan medicine societies is a more recent acquisition than their other paraphernalia, otherwise it would be used in curing ceremonies, since treatment of disease is their first function. The slat altar might have been acquired, perhaps from Zufii, at about the time that the kachina cult spread, for we find these two traits associated on the Rio Grande. But, since Acoma does not precede their summer masked dance by a retreat of a medicine society, they have there assimilated the slat altar to their curing paraphernalia and have extended the older term, yaBaicini, to include this new feature. But this explanation is little better than a guess; more data are needed at this point. At Acoma, as at the other Keresan villages, there is a general curing ceremony, held in the late winter or early spring. At this time, every society holds an all-night meeting at the same time. Everyone in the village whether actually ill or potentially ill is cured, and "sickness" is whipped away from the houses. At Acoma the doctors cure the livestock, too, using their eagle wing-feathers to whip the disease away. Sometimes the medicine- men capture a witch which has human form, but not infre- quently turns into a rat or a dog. At Acoma the Fire society has rather elaborate ceremonies, held at the time of the initiation of a new member, in which the doctors play with fire and swallow swords. Acoma is especially conspicuous in this respect, again suggesting Zufii influence. A great many feats of magic, sleight-of-hand, and hypnotism are practiced by medicine societies at times of ceremonies. The Koshare (Kachale) society at Acoma is extinct, although there are two remaining members. It appears from the data, however, that they were closely affiliated with the O'pi or war- riors' society, and were characterised by clown functions. But they were not affiliated with the Flint society, as is the case at San Felipe, Cochiti, and Santo Domingo, at least so far as mem- bership was concerned. But the Kachale did use the house of the Flint society at the time of the scalp dance, indicating a certain degree of mutual intimacy. Among the Rio Grande pueblos the Quirena society is the complement of the Koshare, according to the moiety feature</page><page sequence="8">566 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 which prevails there. The term Quirena (Guiraina) is used at Acoma to designate all those men who have been initiated into the kachina organization, which is quite different from the well- defined group of the Rio Grande, where it is closely affiliated with the Shikameh curing society. In former times there was an O pi or warriors' society at Acoma as well as at other Keresan pueblos. But since members were recruited from persons who had killed an enemy in battle, this society has ceased to exist. They used to have a house where they kept some paraphernalia, chief among which were scalps of slain enemies. These were washed at intervals and displayed in the O -pi, or scalp dances. The last of the old O -pi at Acoma took all the scalps out to the hills and hid them as they did not feel that the younger men were quite qualified and competent to care for them. At Santo Domingo and at San Felipe, however, the scalps are still preserved, guarded constantly, and washed periodically. The O pi at Acoma figured prominently in the cere- mony of the fight with the katsina as well as in the scalp dances. Since the O0 pi have become extinct it has become necessary to impersonate them in these ceremonies. This is done by the Flint medicine-men. There was also a hunters' society, the Caiyaik, at Acoma in the old days. It was their duty to provide hunters with the proper medicines with which to take game. At communal rabbit hunts they themselves went out with their paraphernalia, the principal item being a small stone mountain lion, the most power- ful of all beasts of prey. They made a meal altar on the ground, built a little fire, and prayed to the sun for help and success. But the Caiyaik, too, have ceased to be at Acoma. The pantheon at Acoma, which includes latik, Ocatc the Sun, the Earth, the Moon, the Morning and Evening Stars, the k'ats'ina, Masewi and Oyoyewi, Paiyatyamo, the koBictaiya, etc., does not differ materially from the list of spirits at other pueblos. Likewise the general outlines of prayer ritual are similar: corn meal is sprinkled with prayers, food is offered at meal time, and prayer sticks are made and deposited on all important occasions. It has been quite impossible to secure complete data on prayer</page><page sequence="9">WHITE] FIELD WORK AT A COMA 567 sticks, however, even upon collections actually made, as one group is not familiar with the details of ritual of another. Little heaps of stones, or shrines, are common in the vicinity of Acoma as at other villages, and pictures of katsina are carved in the face of cliffs. Summary.-Notwithstanding many local differences, it has been possible to outline general principles of Keresan culture, to recognize a Keresan type, or pattern, to which all of the Kere- san pueblos conform in varying degree. In my judgment, Santo Domingo corresponds most closely to this pattern. This village is the largest of the Keresan pueblos and has preserved more of the old culture than her neighbors. San Felipe comes next, and then Cochiti and Zia. Sant' Ana diverges rather widely for reasons not yet known. It is not possible to get an entirely satisfactory estimate of Laguna, owing to its advanced stage of disintegration, but there is no doubt that it diverged more widely from the type than, say, Cochiti or Zia. Acoma is on the extreme western boundary of the Keresan area, greatly removed from its geographic center. Compared with Zufii or Isleta, however, Acoma is emphatically Keresan in type. Nevertheless, there are a number of rather marked divergences, some of them indicating strong Zufii influence. But this situation might well be expected, since Acoma lies about midway between the two areas; Acoma is closer to Zufii than to Santo Domingo. The moiety feature, so pronounced in the east, is lacking at Acoma. The number of kivas, initiation into the kachina organization, the presence of the Gomaiowish, and a number of special kachina features strongly suggest Zufii in- fluence, as well as the feats of jugglery of the curing societies. Then, too, there seem to be some local, typically Acoma, features, such as the three cooks of the war chiefs, the Antelope clan con- trol of the caciqueship, and the impersonation of the koBictaiya. This also is not surprising in view of their comparative isolation from other Keresan pueblos; they were compelled to develop, to some extent, upon their own resources. This is again manifest in the rather large number of local k'ats'ina, which in turn was</page><page sequence="10">568 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 made possible by their unequaled length of residence at their present site. I felt for a time, after becoming acquainted with Santo Domingo and San Felipe, that they had preserved more of the old culture than had Acoma, which was rather surprising, for the Acoma are second to none in surliness and secrecy. But this difference now appears to be more apparent than real. Acoma probably never had certain of the Rio Grande characteristics, such as the Quirena society, whose existence is there enforced by the moiety principle, which is basic. The eastern association of the Koshare with the Flint society, which is not found at Acoma, has also tended to preserve the Koshare along the Rio Grande while it has disappeared in the west. Then, too, ceremonialism has been preserved upon a higher level in the east due to the stimulation of nearby pueblos. Acoma, being more isolated, has not been spurred to exert herself in competitive exhibitions. The fiesta dances, which are open to the public, for example, are conducted with greater regard for correct costume and skilled execution in the east than at Acoma. One might summarize the cultural position of Acoma, then, as follows: Acoma occupies a position marginal both to the Rio Grande region and to Zufii, although it belongs very definitely to the Keresan pattern. Its conformity, however, is somewhat diluted because of its distance. Being close to Zufii it shows marked evidence of western influence. Its comparative isolation has facilitated local developments and has made it easier to avoid disintegrating influences of the whites. But, on the other hand, its remoteness from the Keresan area center has kept it from acquiring some prominent Keresan features. And its iso- lation has, through lack of invigorating competition, allowed some aspects of ceremonialism to degenerate. UNIVERSITY OF BUFFALO, BUFFALO MUSEUM OF SCIENCE, NEW YORK</page></plain_text>
