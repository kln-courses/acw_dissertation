<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vestiges of Bodhi in Indian Poetry John Theobald A word about the phrasing of the title. I had much difficulty in settling for the word bodhi and still, in some ways, prefer either vidya or vijnana —if only for the alliterative effect! The difficulty then would be, how ever, that vidya means less than vijnana for Hinduism, and more for Buddhism. The latter, in its Tantric form at least, has frequently employed vijnana to signify little more than ordi nary intelligence, the consciousness that jumps from object to object and is reborn in successive entities: a far cry, certainly, from the vijnanam of the Amrtabindu Upanishad, where it means pure Consciousness, the state of Atman or Brahman, and much more like what we are going to be looking for, but this equivo cation warned me away from the word. On the other hand, the connotations of vidya are pretty abstract-cognitive; knowledge without the prajna-wisdom, which, in its turn, I take to be primarily wisdom to live, rather than the visionary gleam that would most concern a poet as such. 1 am hoping, that, via the fussy rejections of philological terrorism, we may circle more meaningfully towards bodhi, a word which is not perfect for our purpose either, since it too has sustained some encroachment from Buddhist overtones. Bodhi means enlightenment; it has never really meant anything 5</page><page sequence="2">INDIAN LITERATURE else. Thus it is reasonably well suited to our quest for what remains of the supernal light-within-that-lighteth-every-man, as that light survives in the poetry, especially in Hindi, of this and the last generation, that is to say, the last fifty years. Bodhi, at its simplest and safest, will represent for us the transrational assurance of a transhuman spiritual Presence. Fur ther, it involves the renunciation of the I-Thou dualism of theo logy, and the intuition, or rather the visionary certainty of a Single Reality, which includes and invades all being, gazing out, so to speak, from the height of consciousness, without anything to gaze at, except the Ultimate Fact in which that consciousness lives and moves. It follows that the poetic expression of bodhi will necessarily impersonate the manifest vesture, rather than the inconceivable body; but the awareness out of which that expression arises will remain of the same order as the silence beyond words, with the advantage going to poetry, which suggests as against philosophy, which defines. The tension between the changelessness of eternity and the mobility of beauty1 may help to explain a certain enig matic smile on the face of the poetry of bodhi. How conceptual vehicles also (and bodhi is one) must suffer no less, perhaps more, than poetry from the handicap of having to try to knot the eternal in the temporal. Our problem is to isolate and focus a timeless strain in art's transaction with shif ting forms. But in fact this problem is more than one of the difference between art and philosophy; it is rather one of a cer tain mutual exclusion: for if conceptual language wavers, it makes for bad philosophy, whereas if, conversely, the poet puts a hard fix on the spirit of the forms and thus the death of poetry. At least, this is how we feel about poetry and philosophy in the west, where there may have been such "philosophical poets" as those which Santayana names for his exemplars, but never a good poem that performed satisfactorily as philosophy. In the East, however, there has never been a separation of powers and domains between philosophy, poetry, history, and religion—never, that is, until it came under the influence of the 6</page><page sequence="3">VESTIGES OF BODHI IN INDIAN POETRY West. When we speak of "the poetry of the Bible", we are attaching mainly an honorific metaphor to certain portions of the Bible, such as the Psalms, Job, th e Song of Songs, or, in the Gospels, "the Magnificant." But in India of old, the idea of Valmiki and Vyasa being categorized as either sages or poets, or as part of the time one and part of the time the other, would have been completely incomprehensible. The greatest sages were so by virtue of being the greatest poets and mutatis mutandum. The Ramayana was a scripture, and the Bhagavad Gita, as signi fied by its name, was a poem. The Upanishads were, in their entirety, passionate contemplations of ultimate truth, as befitted the greatest poetry, and they were chanted as such, like Homer, the Vedas, or the choruses of Greek tragedy. If you say, "How, then, will you distinguish between the Kathopanisad and, say, Sakoontala the answer would not be "One is prose and the other poetry" nor even, "One is sacred and the other secular" but simply that the elevated level of the sacred drama of death in the story of Nachiketas is more sus tained at that level than Kalidasa's dispassion of the various levels of love, all the way from something resembling the erotic in Ovid's Metamorphoses to the mystical absorption of the canti cles of St. John of the Cross. Now it would be my contention that, wide as this range is, in Kalidasa it never strays far from bod hi, which I shall not continue attempting to define (poetry hates definitions), but rather exemplify rapidly its ancient aspects, before seeking counterparts in what little of this bodhi is left in Indian poetry today—the hope being that the quality we are seeking will define itself sufficiently in the process. One of the most ancient of the Upanishads, the Taittiriya refers to "that bright space within the heart, in which a man resides, transcending death, with brilliancy innate." (Note: it does not reside in him, but he in it) "Self-kingship he attains, lordship of mind he wins, lord over speech, lord over sight, of hearing lord, lord of understanding. Then he becometh Brahm, whose body is bright space, whose self is truth. . .the pleasure 7</page><page sequence="4">INDIAN LITERATURE ground of life; in whom mind finds bliss, replete with peace, transcending death."2 This exalted utterance, already, perhaps long before the Buddha, bears many of the distinguishing marks of that further most frontier of the spirit where the automatic responses (vasa nas) that link us with our environment are surpassed, and the mind is awakened to its kinship and eventual identity with the timeless purusa, that absolute subject of consciousness which projects the multiple personnae. The sense of this Self beyond self, which led to the great formula, Tat Tvam Asi (That Art Thou) may well have origins even earlier than the Taittiriya; for what else could have enabled the high poetry of the pre-historic Rig Vedas, especially the often quoted X.129, to assume a position which undercuts the idea of the Creator God: Who can tell us whence and how arose this universe? The gods are later than its beginn ing: who knows, therefore, whence comes this creation? Only" that god who sees in highest heaven: He only knows whence comes this universe, and whether it was made or uncreated. He only knows, or p erhaps He knows not. Here the note struck is one of doubt beyond all facile certain ties. But when the mind has ascended far enough on the path whose five stages are so strikingly alike whether in Patanjali, Gautama, Sankara, Plato, Plotinus, Wordsworth, or Jung, it emerges in the "serene and blessed mood" where certainty knows no shadow of turning. Of such is the kingdom of bodhi. II We commenced by referring to the recent spread in the West of an intuitive understanding of the state denoted by bodhi, a state associated by existentialist orientalists like H.V. Guenther with the identity of the mind knowing and the object known. Until as recently as ten years ago, in order to find anyone at 8</page><page sequence="5">VESTIGES OF BODHI JN INDIAN POETRY home with any such position in the West, we would have to look to a sort of neo-Kantian epistemology, branded as solipsism by the Logical Positivists; now, however, owning largely to the influence of Vedanta, we are witness to a spate of wonderful writings, such as those of Renee Guenon and Hubert Benoit in France, Hugh I'Anson Fausset in England, Lama Govinda from Germany, Herbert Guenther in Canada, Robert de Ropp and Lawrence McCafferty in the U.S.A. for all of whom there is emergent "sense sublime" of a Consciousness that surpasses reason and contains within itself the twin domains of life and death. In some writers, this Enlightenment begins to be scientifically derived, especially in Robert de Ropp, for whom it become systematized as what he calls "Creative Psychology." Here the "stages" are seen to advance, from dreamless sleep, through dreams, then through the actually "asleep" condition of ordi nary, ostensible waking, to the discovery of the fourth stage, the Self beyond this "sleeping" self, and finally to the supremely bodhic Satcit-ananda (Being-consiousness-bliss) of Ultimate Union, which is the release of consciousness from association with bodily form the knowledge of Self as existing in subtle essence or even as pure Being, and the bliss of time-negating immersion in the existential intuition of things, not as things are not, but as they truly are: that is to say, not as the "no-thing ness" of the "snake" for which the "coiled rope" is mistaken, but as the rope itself.3 Now one thing that is readily observable in the poetic reflec tions of these stages is that absence, in poetry, of the sense of their discreteness, or isolation from each other. Certainly dis sociation from bodily form, pace Wordsworth, is not a condition one is apt to encounter in poetry, whether ancient or modern. But then it is necessary in any approach to the arts to distinguish between the forms as ends in themselves and as vehicle for the spirit, including even a transcendent condition of the spirit; and it is failure to make this basic distinction that has been respon sible for crass attitudes to Indian iconography especially at 9</page><page sequence="6">INDIAN LITERATURE Ajanta and Khajuraho, with resultant vulgarizations of the original glorious intent. In poetry too, Sanskrit literature reveals absence of any recorded sense of the discreteness of successive stages of spiritual awareness. Does life itself serve notice of gaps between body and soul? Modern Indian thought appears to have lost avowed interest in its spiritual heritage; but this would not imply that modern Indian poetry has lost its instinct for bodhi (except when their poets are hypnotized by trappings of T.S. Eliot), nor that this poetry may not be the last best hope of survival for bodhi, that pearl, richer than all his tribe: intriguing paradox indeed, if, each in their respective domains, in prose the West alone reached now towards what the east alone keeps burning in poetry's world without compartments! Certainly as we look back, we would search in vain the whole of Vidyakara's Treasury of Sanskrit poetry, so magnificently presented by Professor Daniel Ingalls, to find in the poetry itself the sort of signposts of sacred and profane with which the trans lator chose to guide and direct us. A great wealth of short poems or short busts of poetry, scattered throughout this marvelous volume, frequently provide us with swift, unselfconscious illumi nations, of great purity, straight from the sphere of bodhi. But, although I do not wish to lay it down as an opinionated surmise, I doubt if those old poets would have been concerned to feel a hard distinction between the bird's plumage in the Upanishad and the parrot's wing in Daksa's poem about the mountains. The scripture launches forth with the prayer that the Lord, who in the mystery of His vision and power transforms His white radiance into His many-coloured creation, from whom all things come and into whom they all return, may grant us the grace of pure vision. There follows a series of inclusive equation. That is to say, where the Hebrew scripture says, "The Lord created the sun, the moon, the stars, etc." the Sanskrit declares that He is the sun, the moon, the stars, in the sense that He includes them. The fire, the water, the wind are part of Him. Then it says: 10</page><page sequence="7">VESTIGES OF BODHI IN INDIAN POETRY Though art this old man who supports himself on a staff. Thou the God Who appears in forms infinite. Thou the blue bird and thou the green bird.. ."4 This is a psalm of bodhi, in a pure, direct sense. Daksa's poem reads: This is the country of the Vindhyas with its bamboo thickets green as parrot's wings and its trees broken by the tusks of elephants in play; where in bowers by the streams the wind dispels the drops of sweat that gather on the cheeks of mountain girls from exercise in love.5 Anything resembling those drops of sweat would be rigorously excluded from our conceptions of das halige; and for any of our poets to express such feelings would require a rarely occasional Blake ("Arise, ye little glancing wings!/For everything that lives is holy"), or Keats: When holy were the haunted forest boughs, Holy the air, the water, and fire. Yet even in these days so far retired From happy pieties, thy lucent fans. Fluttering among the faint Olympians, I see and sing. . .* There are many poems in Vidyakara's Treasury that sing of the gods, but they are no more impressed by the gods than by the heroes, and no more by the heroes than by the laws of life to which they must submit. "Why describe the deeds of Rama?" say Hanumannataka, "Paint, rather Destiny, whose universal might/has turned even Rama into dust."' And if a god it is, this is because the thunder is heard as his voice, which "breaks our ear-drums with its mighty roar." Siva "rises up as in the monsoon rains, / pouring with Ganges water from a thousand streams. . .noisy with the slapping of the wind. . ."8 It is really no different with Rainakirti, writing of the Buddha, "all conque ring Saviour of the World": "His face is bright with moonlight."9 But a more metaphysically apt model for the poetry of bodhi, 11</page><page sequence="8">INDIAN LITERATURE whose surviving vestiges we are coming upon, is one doubt fully attributed to Vakpatiraja: Here is heaven and here the sky with sun and moon, here earth, here Heades, here the mountains and the seas and all that lies between. Thus thought Brahma, shaking his head in wonder To see the universe the same both in and out of thim from our whose navel he had issued. . .J0 Here we see the vindication of poetic myth, the meeting of thought and rapture in plastic form, where conceptual termino logy could hardly hope to win. To trace in any detail how the sense of bodhi sustains a steady radiance in a great work like Kalidasa's Sakoontala is clearly beyond the scope of this paper. The play is well known. I would remind only that it commences throbbing (explicitly) with sexual desire, in a pastoral Arcady, reminiscent of Rosalind in the Forest of Arden; that it advances, through much patient suffer ing, to end, literally as well as metaphorically, in heaven. I would draw attention, however, to one element in this beautiful work which causes the entire conception to serve the end of enlightenment. This element is the king's oblivion. Sakoontala, it will be remembered, is placed under a curse by an irascible sage, whom she has unwittingly kept waiting too long to suit his vanity. The curse pronounces that King Dushyanta will for get that they have loved and that she has his child. The scene of rejection by the King, after she has taken the child to his palace, is one of the most enthralling, as well as most poig nant, in all drama. But what gives this development a special dimension is that the king's oblivion becomes a protracted analogue for the soul's forgetfulness of its divine origins, this being a favourite theme of Sanskrit myth, which abounds in tales of princes snatched away in infancy and brought up in ignorance of their own royalty, etc. The plot of Sakoontala is saying, we do not live. We move, besotted with shadows, whilst the Real World, once loved but lost, stands beckoning in despair. Throughout the play, 12</page><page sequence="9">VESTIGtS OF BODHI IN INDIAN POhtRY Dushyanta's amnesia and eventual restoration is a singularly effective device for having one order of being receive unrecog nized intimations from another. The play's extraordinary lyri cism, like Shelly's in Prometheus Unbound, is frequently the voice of these lapsed sanctions; and, like Shelley also, Kalidasa has a split stage, as it were, with human and divine enactments going on, pari passu. But in Kalidasa's play, more unmistakably, heaven stands for the transfiguration of the life of avidya (igno rance): ignorance of our true home, which is with "with infinity and only there"; for Dushyanta's mental black-out represents the cruel shadow of what we take to be reality, the samsaric life which derives whatever joy and authenticity it has from the world which it denies or ignores. Dushyanta is the blind partici pant, Sakoontala the silent watcher on the threshold. Always, as the upanisliad says: "there are two birds, two sweet friends, who dwell on the self-same tree. The one eats the fruit thereof, and the other looks on in silence. The first is the human soul who, resting on that tree, though active, feels and in his unwisdom. But on beholding the power and the glory of the higher Spirit, he becomes free from sorrow. . There can be no question of concerning the persistence, throughout Sanskrit literature, of this pre-occupation with what the Svetasvatara calls "the higher Spirit," or of the recurrent possession of the bodhi which derives from it. As the wide flowing Sanskrit source branches into all its later streams, the bodhi still persists, although such reflections of it in the structure of a poetic work as we see in Kalidasa's drama become rarer with advancing time, to fade out altogether in modern Indian literature, except for such a poetically misbegotten monstrosity as Aurobindo's Savitri, pretentious as it is. But the true witness in miniature has never died until this day, as we shall see. Alike in 14th century Chandidas and 18th century Ramprasad of Bengal in Tulsi Das and Kabir, Narasimha Mehta and Mira Bai in Hindi; in the early Marathi poets—Jnanaswari, Ekanath, Tukarama; belonging to the Five Rivers, Lai Dad, Guru Nanak 13</page><page sequence="10">INDIAN LITERATURE (not just the founder of a religion but a great poet too), and Ghalib, the greatest poet of modern Indian history, of whom more anon; in the south,—all the riches of early Tamil, the four thousand hymns of the Nalayina Divya Prabandum, the seventh century Thiruvembavai, not to speak of the epics as they are filtered through Kamban (12th century), Pampa in Kanada (Uth) and Villiputara, again in Tamil (11th). No, it never died. Nor should we'allow the apparently pro fane to delude us. Vidyapati is a burning Catullus, but if he says: "When I want to sleep, / Krishna makes love / The whole night though" and if the reader does not feel caught up in a deep double entendre, then the reader has missed the point. Ill In the entire period of the proliferation of India's fifteen language literature, the greatest poet by western standards is Mirza Asad Ulla Khan, known to posterity as Ghalib, who wrote partly in Persian but mostly in Urdu, and the centenary of whose death in Delhi in 1869 we have recently been celebra ting throughout the world. Our excitement over Ghalib has had very little to do with bodhi. We respond to him because he is a magnificent city poet and love poet of certainly not less than the size, intensity, and honesty of the greatest French poet, Charles Baudelaire, who died two years earlier. Are you having the temerity to advance Ghalib as a spiritual aspirant, an exponent of this bodhil Is there not distinctly a sardonic grin that plays above the very opening lines of a poem ("Even God's Paradise as chanted by fanatics / merely decorates the path for us connoisseurs of ecstacy") Yes. But look at the rest of the poem: just as there is another side to Baudelaire, expressed in poems like "Recueillement", "Le Couffre," and "Correspondances", so there is another side to Ghalib, constantly hinted at in lines like, "without a meaning to perceive, what is perception?"13 Even when Ghalib is most "modern" one is never 14</page><page sequence="11">VESTIGES OF BODHI IN INDIAN POETRY safe from immeorial echoes of bodhi. The lines selected by Hamid Ahmad Khan for the Spring 1970 issue of the Journal of the Asia Society are especially bountiful with transitions from the sensuous minutiae dear to the modern mind, straight to the purest flashes of bodhi: from "the scales of fish that mirror the spots of the moon" to: Mine is the chamber where the sages dwell— I Secluded and withdrawn and solitary / Here watching, have I sighted from afar / Bright Venus naked in her robe of glory", from which, in a pure access of metaphysical rapture, he proceeds to sing: "I am the string which binds the rosary / of pearls that roll across the firmament." There is no doubt that our idea to-day of the best poetry corresponds rather with the Ghalib that telescopes brilliant images as "The flask of wine is green along the stream of melody" than with that still wonder, pure Vedanta, surely, as Hamid Ahmad Khan has recognized, of such lines as: What we call Being is the essence of non-Being We still are dreaming, having woken up in a dream ♦ When nothing exists but Thee, O God, Then what is this commotion?. . . Where do the spreading green and roses come from? What is the flying cloud and what the breeze?13 These quotations bring us to the center of our announced subject, towards which there was nothing for it but to circle in this manner, through the great poetry of the past; else how would we know what we wished to convey by bodhi? Alas! what remains to-day of the "peak experience" emer ging in those lines of Ghalib is vestigial indeed. It is here that some might object, "Why? What of the massive poetic output of Aurobindo and Tagore?" It is here also that, with less right perhaps, I owe it to poetry to be as outspoken as my younger colleagues and fellow poets in India, who, however great these two figures may be as teacher, hero, father-figure, Nobel Prize recipient, idol, even sage, withhold all homage to the poetry of 15</page><page sequence="12">INlblAN LITERATURE them both. There is fascinating paradox contained in the fact that, of the two most celebrated poets of modern India, Rabindranath Tagore and Muhammad Iqbai, Iqbal's poetry in translation at least, should be so much stronger than Tagore's, whilst his ideas are so much weaker. I realize we are taking liberties with opinion in the teeth of established reputation. They would have to produce a poem of Tagore's that is not windy or watery as poetry. At the same time, his world polity is consistently noble, and his popularization of the best of Vedanta in his lectures, especially in the series published as The Religion of Man, can be inspired. Conversely, the voluminous poems of Iqbal, a Punjabi who later became a Pakistani, show a high degree of heat and force, whilst his counsels, both doctrinal and political, are darkened by nationalism, sectarianism, and personal pride. The same might be said of Aurobindo Ghose as on his fellow Bengali Tagore (of whom he seems to have been only less jealous than of Gandhi), except that Aurobindo's hand me-down Milton is much feebler than Tagore's hand-me-down Shelley, and his books on political science even finer than Tagore's. Tagore's Gitanjali comes closest to deserving its reputation when it is prayer, for then at least it is devoutly prayable, although the soul that achieves that union with the divine neces sitated by bodhi is unapt to feel the urge to offer petitionary prayers, since such prayer must imply a dualistic metaphysic (if any dualism can be said to allow of a genuine metaphysic, that is to say, a thinkable ontology and epistemology). Finally I come to a small group of poems which enshrine for me an unmistakable survival of the vestiges we are tracing and, principal among them, the poems of Agyeya, pen name of Sachchidananda Vatsyayan, a Hindi poet, born in 1911, who is perfectly articulate in English (he has been Visiting Professor at the University of California, Berkely), but who has strong con victions about writing only in Hindi. The thing I would draw attention to in The Revolving Rock is the intense effort to find an "objective correlative" for the emergence of something 16</page><page sequence="13">VESTIGES OP BODHI IN INDIAN POETRY out of nothing, or what dualistic systems think of as Creation— again, if thought it could then be called: the supreme Fact, which superstition turns into a parlour trick, and materialistic naivety simply takes for granted. Why is there something, rather than nothing (Heidegger's question)? To cope with such a question in a manner which belongs to real poetry, as distinct from poetic rhetoric, that is to say, in a manner which stabs the imagination wide awake, calls for poetic resources quite other than those in vogue today. The qualities currently prized are focussed to be exalted, in emulation of the reigning fashions, in M.V. Rajadhyaksha's account of contem porary Marathi verse, especially that of the poet P.S. Rege (b. 1910), of whom this critic remarks that Rege "captures the fleeting moments of private excitement in their warm detail." But what the old poets captured was neither fleeting, nor momentary, nor private; or, if it is fleeting, it is so as in Agyeya's The Revolving Rock, where the wind's song and the rustle of the deodars are flashed back by the snow-peaks. Certainly Agyeya lacks for no sense of the fleeting, but this sense is of the sort only conferred by a background of eternity. This is established in "Borrow in the Morning. . (Poem 6), where the wealth of the sun is commonly represented as "the Void". For whereas it is our instinct to confer from on the Absolute, in India they have always inclined to conceive the Divine ground as "Shapeless," as in the poem: the "Unseen Shapeless," from which issue all forms in their multifariousness including the gods—all of which, especially for Buddhism, are non-existent apart from the Subject-Object relation, itself having a merely dependent and hence provisional "reality". The wonder is that the powerful "Borrow in the Morning. . has been able at all to survive against the liberties taken by the trans lator with the American vernacular, sometimes inappropriately. The sense of the fleeting could get pretty depressing in a poem like "Kalewegdan" if the weapons of war and the ruined church-monastery of which it speaks were subject to one of our various Gods of Battle, whether ranged on Side A or Side B, 17</page><page sequence="14">INDIAN LlTERATÜRÉ instead of which, in this poem, the Lord of Life is seen as suffering helplessly along with life itself. Not the least memora ble element of this stunning little poem (stunning even in trans lation is the oblique question with which it closes: the dire possibility it leaves hanging that the broken church, equally with the "broken-nosed guns," is under suspicion as assassin of God. The secret of Agyeya's pre-eminence among contemporary poets writing in Hindi lies close to his thought about what is the function of a poet, whom he sees as "seer, discloser, explorer". He recognizes that this discloser in his disclosing, may and does "misconceive the truth," but that, in this regards, the poet differs from the poem, whose "dissembling" is "explicity in absolute difference."14 It is for him, the poet, to find the "tensions of silence," since All speaking is listening, voice merely stillness. Somewhere far below, , AH liberties are laws, All creations only Spreading your hem to receive.15 Before signing off, I can make mention of but two more poets in Bengali and three in Hindi, with an example of each in the Appendix. The first of the Bengalis, Ajit Dutta, was born at Dacca in 1907. The "moment" that he announces having sought in "The Question" (Poem 8) is rooted in bodhi. The poet's search for it may sound a bit circuitous and the intention nebulous, but it is obviously genuine, and the language clothed in sensuous beauty, whilst at the same time reaching beyond. Premendra Mitra, born in Bañaras in 1904, is more of a name. He stands in the forefront of modern Bengali authors, in both verse and prose. His poem, "The Rats," (Poem 9) reprinted in the Asia House publication, Green And Gold, strikes me as rather a wonderful sustained symbol of human darkness, un penetrated by the Light of bodhi. 18</page><page sequence="15">VESTIGES OF BODHI IN INDIAN POETRY Of the three Hindi poets, Nirala's real name is Suryakant Tripathi, who died a few years ago, after publishing ten volumes of verse: works somewhat uneven for our purpose. Sometimes in poems like "The Symphony of Clouds"16 he seems to try too hard and loads his lines with neo-Shelleyan eloquence (even once with an "O uncontrollable!" right out of "Ode to the West Wind"). His frontal assaults on bodhi drift into self-conscious abstractions ("Three worlds combine in you their separate laws: I Earth, Heaven, and the Middle Space / Are one vast solace and salve to your eyes. . .etc.). On the other hand, a poem like "To a Waterfall" (Poem 10) affects us as an exquisite image of what happens when the un-manifest takes on the hazards of manifestation. Here what appears is nothing, and what is nothing appears in a shimmering light. It is the purer for being philosophically absent-minded. "And the stone's heart knows and abides in the music you make." Navin is Balakrishna Sharma (Hindi authors seems to like pen names for some reason), 1897-1960, who was an active free dom fighter and still is largely unpublished. I advance "My House is Afire" (Poem 11) as a modern "Fire Sermon" of con siderable heat and light, where the seventh line pays explicit attention to the meaning of the word Buddha as "the Awakened one" and throughout relies on traditional images for the soul as a white swan and its adversaries as the fires of wrath and cra ving; at the same time the poem is certainly incadescent with its own excitement. And as in Nirala's "Waterfall," the poetry of bodhi is here more dynamically expressive than statically explicit. Finally, we have Maithiii Sharan Gupta, who died in 1964, who wrote one very long poem and many such miniatures as those here so effectively translated by L.E. Nathan: nothing in direct about the bodhi in these quatrains, which wield it like a two-edged sword (Poem 12) or rather, the reader himself, espe cially in IV, is armed to make war against the anthropomorphic anti-God and to launch out upon his own satcitananda. 19</page><page sequence="16">ÍNDÍAN LITERATURE NOTES 1.
