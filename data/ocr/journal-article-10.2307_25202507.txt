C. Harle Some twenty years ago, Professor J. N. Banerjea identified a statue on the north gopura of the Nataraja temple at Cidambaram (Fig. I),1 hitherto considered to represent Agni, as Yajnapurusa, a minor manifestation of Visnu.2 No other image of Yajnapurusa being known at the time, this was an important identification. It served, moreover, to call attention to the iconography of an ex tremely unusual figure as it possessed two heads (with their necks, rather than simply a pair of faces) and was directly derived, so Banerjea claimed, from a verse in the Rgveda. I propose to show (1) that the Cidambaram image represents Agni, and not Yajnapurusa; (2) that an image of Yajnapurusa (Fig. 2), in the Jambuke3vara temple on the island of Srirangam and so far unpublished, does exist; and (3) that images of this exceptional type represented, to some extent, both Agni and Yajnapurusa. These conclusions, which Professor Banerjea has generously endorsed,3 rest largely on archaeological evidence not previously used. I shall attempt also to establish that these images have the unique distinction, among later South Indian icons, of being directly derived from a passage in the Rgveda which, in turn, accounts both for their exceptional features and their dual identity. Both Krishna Sastri and Gopinatha Rao identified the Cidam baram image, without any question, as Agni.4 In doing so they ignored, or chose to ignore, many of the problems involved. Sastri reproduces a photograph of the Cidambaram image to which part 1 Govt. Epigraphist for India (Ootacamund) Ncg. No. 278, captioned : " Stone Image of Agni, east gopura." This photograph is reproduced in several of the standard works on Indian iconography. So far, no one has questioned the incorrect ascription to the east gopura. * J. N.

He also quotes Hemadri's description of a single-headed Agni, but since the only extant statue referred to or illustrated is the Cidam baram one, one naturally assumes that it represents the typical South Indian Agni image. One would not suspect, from reading Sastri, that single-headed Agnis are also mentioned in many in dubitably South Indian sdstras, that images of this type do exist in South India nor, most important of all, that the Cidambaram image, as far as Sastri probably knew, was the only one of its kind in existence. Rao mentions, besides the Cidambaram statue, one other Agni image, at Kancjiyur in Travancore, with three legs and two (goat) heads.1 Among the numerous accounts of Agni images which he includes from various iastras, however, not one refers to a two headed or three-legged Agni.2 At the same time, he includes a description of just such a figure under the heading of Yajiiapurusa 3 without apparent effect on his conviction that the Cidambaram statue represented Agni. Two distinct types of Agni images do in fact emerge clearly from the numerous descriptions of Agni images in the traditional litera ture.

Analesvara should be made provided with &amp; prabfidmandala, standing on a padmaj)t[ha, and wearing clothes made of dukula. The characteristic features of Type B are the two heads, three legs, and four horns. This form of Agni also has seven arms and implements or objects associated with the sacrifice figure largely among the objects held in the various hands. Another version depicts Agni as an old man (bearded ?). I have assumed that the figure described in the text just quoted has two heads, although the word used is vaktra. Vaktra means " face " or " mouth " (Monier Williams). It is the term used to describe deities like Brahma or Skanda (caturvaktra or -muklia, sahmukJia) who, in actual artistic practice, are invariably depicted as having four or six faces, not heads. So one would expect, from the KdSyapaSilpa description, a figure with two faces (Janus-like). Such a figure would, however, be as exceptional as one with two heads (i.e. each complete with its own neck) such as the one at Cidambaram and, for reasons which will appear later, I think it reasonable to assume that the use of vaktra here is purely conventional and that the image to which the description refers is two-headed. Descriptions of Agni images of Type A and Type B may be found as Agni-, Vahni-, or Anahlaksanas in the following sastras 3 : 1 A name of Agni. 1 I have assumed the emendation daksinetare for daksinottare. The translation of this and the next two lines is uncertain because of corruptions in the text. * The word sastra is used loosely here to include all works containing prescrip tions for the making of images.</page><page sequence="7">TWO IMAGES OF AGNI AND YAJflAPUKUSA IN SOUTH INDIA 5 Type A iSilparatna l Vaikhdnasdgama2 From Gopinatha Kao: &amp;ilparatna?" silparatnasarhyogite kasminscid granthe".3 Type B Kasyapa&amp;ilpa From Krishna Sastri: Mayamata 4 An unidentified sdstra This list does not claim to be exhaustive and I have examined only material definitely associated with South India.

Each type may be accompanied by one or a pair of wives. But whereas Type A is tlie usual kind of anthropomorphic Indian image, the bicephalous Type B is quite anomalous. To my know ledge no other South Indian image (except Agni/Yajnapurusa) has two heads.7 Nor are horns prescribed, as far as I know, for any other murti.6 Three-legged figures, on the other hand, exist although they are rare.9 1 Ed.

The only alternative was that it represented Yajnapurusa and a statue of Agni, even of an unfamiliar type, was far more likely than that of an obscure avatdra of Visnu of which no images were even known to exist. Both scholars, moreover, describe figures of the other dikpdlas placed around the bases of the Cidambaram gojmras. Here I will describe the Cidambaram image in some detail and comment on some of its features. Each head is crowned with an unmistakable jata-mukuta. An aureole of flames encircles both heads. A third eye is not discernible at present on either head. The rather crudely figured animal standing behind the figure (the usual way of portraying vehicles at Cidambaram) is distinctly a bull and not a he-goat or ram. The figure has three feet and legs and an odd number of arms, four on the right side (of the image and not the observer) and three on the left. Each holds a symbol or emblem. While all of these are intact, there is not one, except the padma in one of the right hands, which does not raise some problem of identification. Rear, right.

In spite of its exceptionally small size and the division of the bowl, with the consequent resemblance to a tiny trident, this is probably meant to represent a sruva, the small wooden ladle used in the sacrifice.

This featureless little stick would seem to aj&gt;proximate most nearly to a suci (needle); in view of the reduced scale of the sruc and sruva (above), it is just possible that it represents the tomara mentioned in the KaSyapasilpa. This statue is almost certainly not earlier than the sixteenth century and may well belong to the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries. There arc many other statues in the same rather debased style as Cidambaram, most of them in the North gopura. The incorrect scale of the emblems is a characteristic feature of late South Indian sculpture. The principal discrepancy between this statue and the descrip tions of a two-headed, three-legged Agni in the Sdstras is the animal figure which is a bull at Cidambaram instead of the hc-goat or ram iconographically associated with Agni. One detail seems particularly 1 H. Zimmer, The Art of Indian Asia, f, pi. Bl, e.</page><page sequence="10">8 two ima&lt;;i;s OF AC.NI AND YAJflAPUllUSA IN SOUTH INDIA significant: jatd-mukulas, as prescribed by the Kdsyajxisilpa, are worn by the heads of this image. Banerjea, identifying the Cidambaram image as Yajnapurusa, traced the source of its most striking iconographic features to the verses from the Rg Veda : catvari srnga trayo asya pada / dve sirse sapta hastaso asya ] tridha baddho vrsabho roravlti / maho deve martyaifi a vive&amp;i. ] Rg Veda, iv, 58, 3.

This passage once figured prominently in the controversy as to whether or not images existed in Vedic times. Those who believed that they did considered it to be a description of an image. Banerjea rejects this interpretation and, what is more, considers it to be merely an allegorical description, not of Agni, but of the Vedic Sacrifice.1 He cites Yaska's explanation that the four horns are the Vcdas, the three legs the three savanas, the two heads the istis9 the seven heads the sapta ehandas, and that the great god who has entered into men is Yajfia, or Sacrifice. No image is implied here ; nor even, in view of the unstable and shifting way in which attributes are assigned to the gods in the Vedic hymns, can it be considered as a description of a particular anthropomorphic or theriomorphic god. This passage, like so many others in the Rg Veda, occupies a characteristic position somewhere between riddle, prescription, and metaphor and would certainly not seem to be the stuff of which images are made. By the time of the Brahmanas, Banerjea has also pointed out, Visiju was equated with the sacrifice and " the several acts associated with it were later utilised by the sectarian worshippers of Vasudeva Visiiu for the representation of this god as Yajfia ".* In the Bhaga vata Purdiia, Yajiia is listed as one of the twenty-two incarnatory 1 J.

No other sculptures of Yajnesa arc known, according to Banerjea, but he cites the description of an image of Yajna purusa in the Vaiklidnasdgama to which Gopinatha Rao referred. The passage is as follows : nairrtyam pascimamukhastaptacamlkarabhaicatura ? srago dvisirsah saptahastah sankhacakrajyadarvi ? sruksruvajuhupadharastripado raktavastrah sarvabharana ? bhusito daksinavamayoh svahasvadhayukto yajiio yajnesarii sarvadevamayarh punyarh sarvakratuvaramiti Vaiklidnasdgama, Patala 18. Yajiia (should be placed) in the position associated with Nirrti (i.e. the south-west), facing west, looking like molten gold, with four horns, two heads, seven hands, holding Sankha, cakra, djya (liquid oblation), darvi (a ladle), sruc, sruva, and juhu, having three feet, wearing red garments, adorned with various ornaments, with Svaha and Svadha on his right and left. Yajnesa, the holy, compounded of all the gods, the best of all offerings. The presence of sankha and cakra, the emblems of Visnu, in two of the hands is particularly noteworthy; Yajiia is here treated as one of the avaraiya deities.1 So is the fact that Yajiia is to be placed in the south-west, occupying the position of Nirrti, the regent of that quarter, and not that of Agni, guardian of the south-east. Professor Banerjea's decision that the Cidambaram statue represented Yajnapurusa was, upon examination, rather surprising. Conch and discus are absent, yet they are prescribed in the Vaiklid nasdgama for Yajnapurusa and would be expected in any South Indian image depicting a manifestation of Visnu. So would kirita mukutas, and yet the crowns of the Cidambaram figure arc un mistakably jatd-mukutas. Perhaps the presence of a bidl as vehicle, instead of the hc-goat or ram associated with Agni, weighed heavily with Professor Banerjea. In the passage quoted above, the phrase vrsabho roraviti refers, in his interpretation, to Yajiia, the Sacrifice ; in my opinion, the hymnist here does not envisage Sacrifice as cither a bidl or as riding upon one, but simply as having certain characteristics of the bull. Vrsabha is used in the Veda, moreover, as an epithet for many gods, among them Indra whom one does not think of primarily 1 Gopinatha Rao, op. cit., T, i, p. 219,</page><page sequence="12">10 TWO 1MACKS OF AIJNI AND YAJSAPUKUSA IN SOUTH INDIA as a bull. Nor does he have a bull as a vehicle. The epithet vrsabho is also applied in the Veda to Agni. Finally, the stereotyped style of the group of images in the North gopura at Cidambaram to which the image in question belongs raises doubts as to whether the bull has any significance at all. The bull is one of the most commonly depicted animals in South Indian sculpture ; as diva's mount, he is the vehicle par excellence. As the repertory of subjects of many later South Indian sculptors became more limited and they lost all ability and incentive to enlarge it, one cannot help but suspect that, faced with the problem of carving a sheep or a ram, which are relatively rare in iconography, they simply carved a bull. Professor Banerjea was, in fact, mistaken in identifying the Cidambaram statue as Yajnapurusa, as he has generously admitted. Nonetheless, what I believe to have been the underlying reasons for his identification are of considerable importance and will be discussed when the intcrdepcndancc of Agni and Yajnapurusa images is considered. The Cidambaram statue is, indeed, Agni and not Yajnapurusa. This became apparent, beyond any doubt, from a detailed study which I made recently of the outer gopuras at Cidambaram and their iconography.1 Among the other statues placed in the upajfitha, or sub-base, niches of the North gopura are images of all seven other dikpdlas. This pre-supposes that Agni, the eighth guardian of the quarters, was also included in the group. No other image even remotely resembling Agni can be seen, nor are there any empty niches which might have held an image which has disappeared. This is strong evidence that the statue under consideration repre sents Agni. Furthermore, each of these dikpdla images is placed in the correct position in relation to the quarter of the compass with which it is associated.2 Agni/Yajnapurusa is no exception to this scheme, occupying a niche in the south-east corner of the building. Further, and even more definite proof of the identity of this image is supplied by the other Cidambaram gopuras. The icono graphy of these buildings is practically identical to that of the North 1 J. C. Harle, Temple Gateways in South India : the Architecture and Iconography of the Cidambaram Gopuras (in the press). * i.e. Varuna the regent of the West, in the middle of the facade which facos west, and so on. Since the gopuras are rectangular buildings, orientated to the cardinal points, the regents of the intermediary quarters cannot actually face their directions ; they are placed in niches near the appropriate corners.</page><page sequence="13">TWO ItfACJtiH OF A&lt;iNI AND YAJ&amp;A1MJIIUSA IN SOUTH INDIA 11 gopura; each one contained a full set of dikjmlas (a few arc now missing), correctly located with regard to the points of the com pass ; each of these included an Agni/Yajiiapurusa image. Any possible doubt remaining as to the true identity of this image is removed by the presence, on the West gopura, of a contemporary label in the form of an inscription above the image which reads " Agnidevan ". The Agni images in the other three gopuras (East, West, and South) arc all of the same two-headed three-legged type. The statue in the East gopura is the least damaged and, iconographically, nearly identical with the North gopura image. An unidentified object (perhaps a sacrificial implement), has been substituted for the padma in one of the hands and the image wears karanda-mukuias.1 The South gopura image appears to have been similar to that of the North gopura but the emblems of four of the hands arc either missing (arms broken) or indiscernible. The niche containing the West gopura Agni has been partially bricked up. The image appears to have had only four arms, the front pair being broken. A South Indian stone image which indisputably represents Yajnapurusa does exist (Fig. 2). Hitherto unnoticed, as far as I know, it stands in a sub-base niche of the so-called " Sundara Pandlya " gopura of the great Jambukcsvara temple near Tiruchira palli (formerly Trichinopoly).2 This gopura was probably built at the end of the thirteenth century and the group of sculpture to which this image belongs is probably of the same date.3 There is no doubt that this figure represents Yajnapurusa. The presence of the cakra and sahkha (of which only the outline remains) are conclusive proof. Nowhere are these emblems ever associated with Agni whereas they are the most characteristic symbols of Visnu and his manifestations. The heads of the statue, moreover, wear kinta.-mukutas9 which are always worn in South India by 1 The texture of tho stone is different and the detail coarser when compared with the other statues in this gopura and I suspect that this is a modern replace ment image. There are several in this gopura, faithful but coarse reproductions of late Cola images. * This is tho outermost eastern gopura of the temple, if one excepts the un finished base of a colossal eighteenth century gopura. Jouveau-Dubreuil, by error, located this gopura in the west side of the temple.

Harle, op. cit.</page><page sequence="14">12 TWO lMA(Ji;s OF AUNI AND YAjfiAPUllUgA IN SOUTH INDIA images of Visnu. The " four horns " of the Vedic passage referring to Yajiia are, moreover, clearly discernible in this image. They bear no resemblance, it should be noted, to the horns depicted on some Pallava figures. This image's vdhana, however, is unquestionably a ram, the vehicle of Agni. Nor is this the most important problem involved in its identification as Yajnapurusa. The " Sundara Panxjya " gopura is a seven-storey gopura of the same type as those at Cidam baram and with the same number of niches arranged in identical manner ; what is more, the deities whose images are placed in these niches are the same, with one or two exceptions, as those in the corresponding niches of the Cidambaram gopuras and among them is to be found, as at Cidambaram, a full set of dikpdlas. The image just identified as Yajnapurusa occupies the position of Agni in the other gopuras. This would seem to indicate that the Jambikesvara image repre sents Agni, after all, were it not for certain attributes, missing in the Agni figures, which unmistakably denote that the figure is Yajnapurusa. These contrary indications can only point, I believe, to one conclusion, namely that two-headed, three-legged images of this type could represent either Agni or Yajnapurusa. The archaeological evidence for this view is very strong. To recapitulate briefly : at Jambukesvara, probably at the end of the thirteenth century, an image was installed which, with its cakra, Sankha, and kiriia-mukutas clearly represents a form of Visriu.1 Yet this image also figures as the eighth, or Agni, member of a typical set of dikjxilas of the period and, what is more, has Agni's ram as its vehicle. At the same time, some of the Agni images at Cidam baram are depicted with the bull associated with Yajnapurusa and not with the ram. The religious texts and commentaries contain ample evidence to show that both Agni and Yajnapurusa could be represented by images of this type. And the texts reveal the reasons, which the archaeological evidence does not, for this unusual situation. First, however, it is necessary to prove, which I believe can be done beyond reasonable doubt, that these two-headed, three-legged images of both Agni and Yajnapurusa are literally and consciously derived 1 It is a matter for speculation whether this image emanated in some way or other from the great Vaisnava temple of Sri Rangam only a mile Or two away from Jambukesvara.</page><page sequence="15">TWO IMAGES OF AGNI AND YAJNAPURUSA IN SOUTH INDIA 13 from a particular verse in the Rgveda, that which commences " catvari rfrnga trayo asya pada .. .". (RV. 4, 58, 3). The connection between this verse of the Rgveda and one of the images in question was first noted by Professor Banerjea (see above) and it formed the basis of his identification of the Cidambaram North gopura image as Yajnapurusa. It has just been shown that this particular identification was not literally correct, as Professor Banerjea would doubtless have realized at the time had he pushed his investigations further. Yet he deserves great credit for making an essentially correct and at the same time extremely bold rapproche ment. No other instance, to my knowledge, was or is known of a South Indian image being literally derived from a verse in the Rgveda.1 Unfortunately, while Professor Banerjea was no doubt aware of the extent to which the relationship he had discovered runs counter to the prevailing process of development of Indian iconography, nowhere is this explicitly stated ; much less does he indicate that, to prove the existence of such an exceptional relation ship, it is not sufficient simply to point out the correspondences between text and image, striking though they may be. No mere similarity would suffice to establish a direct relation between a monument in Europe and another in the Americas, prior to Columbus, without arguments to show how such a relationship could have existed. In the case at hand, moreover, arguments are not lacking. Images with two heads, such as these of Agni/Yajiiapurusa, are, as far as I know, unique in Indian iconography. Nor is this distinguishing feature one of minor importance, for it represents a radical departure from one of the major and characteristic traditions of Indian art, that of representing multiple faces, and not heads. To this distinction corresponds an extremely significant difference between the numerous (and later) texts which deal specifically with iconography and the making of images and the Vedic passage. In 1 Two lotus-headed female figures from the Southern Deccan also stand apart from the general Indian iconographical tradition and in a somewhat similar way. They, however, are significant expressions of Vedic and early post-Vedic religious concepts whereas the Agni/Yajfiapurusa images arc simply mechanical renderings into stone of certain features in the text which lent themselves, in a different age. to such a transposition.

The two armless and legless figures of &amp;ri (" j?rlvatsa-?ti ") at present in the Government Museum, Madras, are probably of a nature similar to the lotus-headed goddesses.

XIX, 1 and 3.</page><page sequence="16">14 TWO IMAGES OF AGNI AND YAJNAPURUSA IN SOUTH INDIA the former, vaktra or mukki, " face, mouth," arc invariably used to refer to the face(s), whereas in RV. 4, 58, 3, the word used is slrsa, " head." Faced with an image differing radically from other Indian images in some major aspect such as this, it is logical to seek the origins of this image, since iconography knows no spontaneous creations, elsewhere than among the sources of the usual type of icon. Indian iconography, as we know it, cannot be traced back earlier than the second and third centuries B.C. The religious and intellectual climate in which it evolved is that of the Epics, the Puranas and the later literature. What other sources could there be for the exceptional iconography of the Agni/Yajiiapurusa images ? Foreign influences can be precluded and nothing suggests a tribal or village origin. Only one alternative would seem to remain : a Vedic source. Considering the important part which the Vedas have never ceased to play in the civilization of India and that Vedic ceremonies are occasionally performed even to this day, there is nothing in herently impossible about such an origin. It is exceedingly odd, no doubt, that as late as the thirteenth century images should derive important elements of their iconography directly from a verse in the Rgveda, but then so too are these images of Agni/Yajnapurusa very odd and, so far, nothing else that we know would seem to account for their exceptional characteristics. All this in addition to the fact that the Vedic passage does describe the image so closely as to all but eliminate the possibility of mere coincidence. If one accepts this direct derivation from the Vedic passage, then the exceptional features of these Agni/Yajnapurusa images are not surprising. One must then consider : 1. That they are literally derived, in an age of icons, with a long iconographic tradition behind it, from a " metaphor " or " riddle " belonging to an aniconic age. 2. That the subject of this " metaphor " or " riddle " was not an image or even a throughgoing anthropomoq&gt;hic or therio morphic concept of a deity. It is difficult to account for images, or parts of images, being derived in this way, so different from the gradual evolution under lying most Indian iconography and these Agni/Yajiiapurusa images must probably be considered as a kind of sport. They appear to be a very late creation, not merely because no images of this type are known earlier than the twelfth century but because it would seem</page><page sequence="17">TWO IMAGES OF AGNI AND YAJSa1?U11U$A IN SOUTH INDIA 15 difficult otherwise for them to have escaped the normalizing influence of centuries of development shared with other Indian images. Such literal adherence to a text also suggests a late date when Indian iconography had been completely codified and the existence of literal verbal equivalents was both taken for granted and expected. If the iconography of the two-headed, three-legged images of Agni/Yajnapurusa, or at least its most distinctive features, is directly derived from RV. 4, 58, 3, then it is natural to seek in the text itself and its meaning for the explanation of why these images came to represent both Agni and Yajnapurusa. First of all, who indeed is the divinity thus described or alluded to in the verse beginning : " catvari grftga . . ." ? Banerjea understood this deity to be Yajne&amp;i (not, in fact, Yajnapurusa), simply on the faith of Yaska's identification: mahodeva ityeSa hi mahdn dew yadyajho (Nirukta, xiii, 1, 7; but see below). Yet Banerjea considers the image derived from this verse to be Yajnapurusa and nowhere does he comment upon this apparent discrepancy nor does he seem aware that Yajnesa and Yajnapurusa are not the same even in the Vedic context. But he is well aware of the close relationship and even identity between Agni and Yajnapurusa.1 The interpretation of the passage " catvari srnga . . ." indeed presents a far more complicated problem than appears from Bancrjea's account. Since Vedic scholarship is not within my competence, I must rely here on the views of other scholars qualified in this extremely specialized field, and in particular upon those of Professor Louis Renou whose distinction in practically every branch of Sanskrit studies is only surpassed by his pre-eminence in con temporary Vedic scholarship. To Professor Renou, who was kind enough to review the whole problem for me and to give me the benefit of his conclusions I am especially indebted. I am also grateful for his permission to present these conclusions. According to Geldner, the entire hymn was addressed to ghrta, or clarified butter, although the anukramani lists the five deities Agni, Surya, Water, the cow or ghrta. As for the passage in question, Geldner, and before him Bergaignc, believed that it referred to Soma. It is to this interpretation that Renou inclines. The com mentators have variously proposed Yajiia (Ydska, vide supra, 1 " Yajnapurusa is really Agni in its background, for fire was the main factor and ingredient in the performance of sacrifices by Vedic priest* "?letter referred to above.</page><page sequence="18">16 TWO IMAGES OF AGNI AND YAJNAPURUSA IN SOUTH INDIA although the passage is actually apocryphal), Agni, Surya, and even human language, where the four horns are the four classes of words and so on. Renou, who suspects that the hymn is indeed addressed to ghrta, considers that this verse " est une enigme . . . ala maniere de celles qui comjmcnt Vhymne 1.164 tout entier ",l While it appears to be tributary (" tributaire ") to the context and that the hymnist is still praising ghrta, it would seem that he has in mind another substance " qui parte un nom secret", i.e. Soma. The last pada, according to Renou, seems to tip the scales in favour of Soma, which is but the concrete representation of Yajfia. At the same time, Renou does not consider this explanation mandatory. If the verse " catvdri srngd . . ." is taken to be a gloss on the words " catuh srngah gaurah " which immediately precede it, then it might well refer to Agni. Besides, Agni and Soma arc related (" connexe ") representations of the Sacrifice. Finally, it is just possible to find, in the anthropomorphism (or theriomorphism) of RV. 4, 58, 3: " une evocation de ce que le Livre X du Rgveda appelle le Purusaf VMre cosmique, qui est un veritable * Yajnapurusa, puisqu'il est immole dans le Sacrifice primordial" ; and, in last analysis, Renou believes that " Agni/Soma et (Yajna)purusa sont imbriques Vun dans Vautre dans la substance de cette strophe si suggestive ".2 Of equal and perhaps even greater significance is the fact that the commentators themselves, as Renou points out, have obviously been somewhat puzzled by this verse and have interpreted it variously as referring to either Agni or Yajnapurusa, as well as to Surya, Yajfia, etc. Of the pancadevatas of the anukramani, Sayana restricts himself to Agni and Surya. Agni is envisaged as yajndt makam (" whose essence is the sacrifice ") whereupon Sayana follows Yaska's sacrificial interpretation of the verse. The subject of the verse is consequently considered to be the Sacrifice : in describing the Sacrifice, it is describing Agni whose essence is the Sacrifice. The four horns are the four Vedas, the three legs the three savanas, the two heads the Brahmaudana and the pravargya, the seven hands the seven cliandas. Finally, Mahidhara 3 sees the verse as applying to Yajnapurusa, the Sacrificial Man, and, assigns the elements of the sacrifice somewhat differently among the numbers 4, 3, 2, 1 Letter dated 17th March, 1961. * Letter dated 15th June, 1961. * The author of a commentary of the Vajasaneyi SamhitA.</page><page sequence="19">TWO IMAGES OP AGNI AND YAJftAPUHUSA IN SOUTH INDIA 17 and 7 : the four horns are the four priests, the three legs the three Vedas, and so on. The reason that these two-headed, three-legged statues could represent either Agni or Yajnapurusa is thus shown to lie in the ambiguity inherent, at least for later ages, in the Rgveda verse from which they derive the most striking and distinctive features of their iconography; further, it is proved by the fact that com mentators have actually interpreted the verse as referring now to Agni, now to Yajnapurusa, and even to other divinities or abstrac tions. In conclusion, it is worth pointing out that certain among these stone images of Agni and Yajnapurusa based on RV. 4, 58, 3 are actually older than either the commentaries of Sayana, a southern Brahmin who lived in the fourteenth century, or of Mahldhara who belongs to the sixteenth. Since they already reflect, at a somewhat earlier date, the same divergences of interpretation later revealed in the commentaries, these statues deserve a small but definite place in the body of Vedic exegesis.
