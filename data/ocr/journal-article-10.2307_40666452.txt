<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lyric, History, and Genre Cohen founded New Literary History in 1969, inaugurating the first of a series of journals of literary theory that exercised a .powerful effect on criticism. Swiftly followed by diacritics (1970) , SubStance (1971), boundary 2 (1973), Semiotexte (1974), and Critical Inquiry (1974), New Literary History is the only one to have been led for forty years by its founder, and I take this opportunity to pay homage to Ralph Cohen for his remarkable record of continuing intellectual leadership, as he hands over the journal to his younger colleagues. Established with the goal of revitalizing literary history, which had fallen into disrepute or at least neglect in the years of the New Criticism, the journal did not initially succeed on that front, though it did give prominence to the aesthetics of reception, which seemed at the time the most promising candidate for renovating literary history.1 With a judicious sense of what was important, Ralph Cohen made New Literary History a major forum for the discussion and assimilation of European work in literary theory and for interdisciplinary or cross-disciplinary studies in the humanities. In its eighth year, the journal changed the description offered on the masthead to reflect what had become its central mission, welcoming "theoretical articles on literature . . . and articles from other disciplines that help interpret or define the problems of literary history or literary study." But Ralph Cohen remained in his own work faithful to the project of rethinking literary history. His scholarship on James Thomson's The Seasonsled to two monumental works, The Art of Discrimination: Thomson's "The Seasons" and the Language of Criticism, and The Unfolding of "The Seasons" which focused on problems of literary criticism by examining the critical reception of a poem that was reprinted an amazing number of times over the course of a century. Above all, he saw to it that from time to time scholars returned to the problem of genre. Periodically devoting special issues of the journal to this unpopular topic, he kept it before us as a crucial concept for literary history, perhaps even the major site of literary history, since if literature is more than a succession of individual works, it may be at the level of genre (the modifications of genres, the rise of new genres, and the eclipse of the old) , that literature has a history. But his claims New Literary History, 2009, 40: 879-899 Jonathan Culler</page><page sequence="2">880 NEW LITERARY HISTORY for genre and genre study are even broader: "Genre study is more than another approach to literature or to social institutions or scientific practices; it analyzes our procedures for acquiring and accumulating knowledge, including the changes that knowledge undergoes."2 In an article entitled "History and Genre," Cohen quotes Fredric Jameson's claim in The Political Unconscious that genre criticism has been "thoroughly discredited by modern literary theory and practice," and he sets about efficiently and systematically to consider reasons for the disparagement of the idea of genre and to elucidate a conception of genre that can be defended against common criticisms.3 Though skepti- cism about the idea of genre has remained powerful in literary studies, I believe there are signs of a growing recognition of the importance of generic categories. In 2007, PMLA devoted a special issue to "Remap- ping Genre"; the subject of the September 2009 meeting of The English Institute was simply "Genre"; and the so-called "new lyric studies" has sparked a lively debate about the validity and bearing of the notion of the lyric as a genre.4 It seems timely to take up the sort of argument of- fered by Ralph Cohen's discussion of the category of genre, its relation to history and importance to literary studies. Traditionally, theorists say there are two sorts of theories of genres, empirical and theoretical; the latter is based on some claim about el- ementary possibilities of thought, representation, or discourse. Aristotle distinguishes literary types according to the possible modes and objects of representation. Northrop Frye bases genre categories on "radicals [root forms] of presentation": "words may be acted in front of a spectator, they may be spoken in front of a listener, they may be sung or chanted, and they may be written for a reader" - fundamental possibilities, which for him yield drama, epic, lyric, and narrative fiction.5 Goethe spoke of the "drei echte Naturformen der Dichtung" (three pure natural forms of poetry) : epic, dramatic, and lyric, which he distinguished from the variety of Dichtarten, which one might translate as empirical genres: ballads, drama, epistles, fables, ode, novel, parody, romance, et cetera.6 The alternative to theories of genres based on logical divisions of a sphere of possibilities would be such empirical genres, groupings that are observed or practiced, based on principles other than theoretical. Empirical genres would be lists of whatever genres people believe exist, some based on form, others on content - classifications that do not seem very logical - like the categories we find in bookstores. Now these do seem to be two different conceptions of genre, which we could call theoretical and historical, but I believe that in separating the two conceptions one obscures fundamental aspects of genre and creates the sort of confusion that contributes to the tendency to dismiss genres.</page><page sequence="3">LYRIC, HISTORY, AND GENRE 881 On the one hand, theories of genre have indeed usually attempted to find a logical basis for taxonomies but use these to situate historically- attested genres. They do not derive categories that do not correspond to historically-attested forms of literary practice. The attempt to posit genres based on fundamental features of language or communication always draws on historically existing genres, as Gerard Genette argues in his fine little book about genre, Introduction à VArchitexte, even if, as in the case of the romantic division into subjective, objective, and mixed, theorists disagree about whether it is epic that is objective and drama mixed, or vice versa. Insofar as genres are literary categories, the pro- jection of naturalness onto them is fallacious, Genette argues: "in the classification of genres no position is essentially more natural or more ideal than any other."7 They are all historical categories. This is important because our historicist age has tended to be suspi- cious of generic categories that previous theorists have claimed to base on some fundamental aspect of language, communication, or representa- tion, as if these were eternal, atemporal categories, which of course they are not. If, on the other hand, genres are seen as merely contingent empirical groupings, categories that people have for various reasons found it convenient to use in dealing with literature, then it is easy to dismiss them as mere conveniences of classification - as in a bookstore or catalogue - with no critical purchase or function. But the notion of genres as merely empirical categories is very dubious - classification schemes are never without a theoretical or ideological basis of some sort, even the most heterogeneous, which might be based on marketing schemes and ideas about distinct target audiences. And a great many supposedly empirical generic categories do play a constitutive role in reading and writing, whether independently, when writers compose a detective story or readers consume a romance novel, or in combination, as when a writer deploys the conventions of one genre while ostensibly working in another. If one avoids the temptation to separate generic categories into the theoretical and the empirical but insists that genres are always historical yet based on some sort of theoretical rationale, they are more defensible as critical categories, essential to the understanding both of literature as a social institution and of the individual works that take on meaning through their relations to generic categories. Generic categories frame both reading and writing - writers write in relation to other texts and textual traditions, both consciously and un- consciously, imitating, misreading, and rejecting, and readers approach works differently according to how they conceive them, even if those expectations are going to be disappointed. It was crucial to the effect of the French nouveau roman, for example, that these texts were approached</page><page sequence="4">882 NEW LITERARY HISTORY as novels, with the framework of expectations governing plot, character, and meaning. The concept of the novel in its capaciousness has proved a very fruitful one for thinking about literature, perhaps especially for productions that seem to lie on its margins. In "History and Genre," Ralph Cohen critiques essentialist theories of genre, which presume that genres are defined by necessary features that all examples of the genre share, and describes genres as open sys- tems, defined in relation to one another. He summarizes his argument as follows: Classifications are empirical, not logical. They are historical assumptions con- structed by authors, audiences, and critics in order to serve communicative and aesthetic purposes. Such groupings are always in terms of distinctions and interrelations, and they form a system or community of genres. The purposes they serve are social and aesthetic. Groupings arise at particular historical mo- ments, and as they include more and more members, they are subject to repeated redefinitions or abandonment.8 And he concludes "History and Genre" with the splendid example of "The Excellent Ballad of George Barnwel," which began as a broadside ballad in the early seventeenth century, was transformed into a prose fiction chapbook in the late seventeenth century, then in 1731 was rewrit- ten as a tragedy, The London Merchant, and finally was incorporated as a ballad in Bishop Percy's Reliques of English Poetry in 1765 but was revised in accordance with the standards of decorum thought appropriate to a form newly promoted as literary. These generic transformations involve the negotiation of social meanings, drawing upon the social and cultural implications of genres, but also using popular material to enrich and modify existing genres, such as tragedy. The rewritings highlight differ- ent narrative elements and play up or play down the possible moral of the story. Asking what one can learn about history and genre from this briefly sketched example, Cohen concludes, "Most obviously, genres have popular and polite functions and statuses. Generic transformation can be a social act. Generic transformation reveals the social changes in audiences and the interpénétration of popular and polite literature. Within a common audience different genres complement or contrast with one another," and in general what he calls "a process theory of genre" - seeing genres as open-ended and in a constant process of his- torical transformation - "explains the constituents of texts that it seeks historically to explain" (216-17). In explicitly treating genres as historical rather than logical, Cohen sometimes appears to assume that genres are whatever critics of a par- ticular period say they are (genres "are groupings of texts by critics to</page><page sequence="5">LYRIC, HISTORY, AND GENRE 883 fulfill certain ends" [210]). But since, as he says in a passage I quoted earlier, genre study analyzes our procedures for acquiring and accu- mulating knowledge, it would be wrong merely to accept as empirical fact every ascription and description of genre. We need to evaluate such claims, and to do so, we need to reflect on what makes something count as a genre, posing the question of the relation of the groupings posited by later critics, including ourselves, to those posited by critics of an earlier era. And as soon as we take up this problem, genres are no longer merely empirical categories with no theoretical standing. Given the historicizing inclinations of criticism these days, it is important to stress that conceptions of genres are not just accounts of what people of a particular period thought; it is crucial to the notion of genre as model that people might have been wrong about them, unaware of affinities or ignoring continuities in favor of more striking novelties, or recognizing only an attenuated version of a larger tradition. Genre study cannot be just a matter, for instance, of looking at what Renaissance critics say about genres and using only those categories for thinking about Renaissance literature, though of course one should try them out, while keeping in mind the possibility that more capacious and historically informed categories may be essential to grasping the full import and deepest resources of literary productions. In my own work on the Western lyric tradition, for example, I find myself needing to say that poets and critics have had erroneous con- ceptions of the lyric, which are undermined by the functioning of the poems themselves, when they are viewed in the context of a longer or broader lyric tradition. This desire to correct, which drives much aca- demic research on subjects like this, presumes that lyric is more than a construction of the moment, that the weight of tradition helps make there be something to be right or wrong about, and in particular that a given historical construction of or notion of the lyric can neglect or obscure crucial aspects of the nature and function even of the poems to which the construction is supposed most directly to apply. The theory of a genre is an abstract model, an account of a set of norms or struc- tural possibilities that underlie and enable the production and recep- tion of literature: reading something as an epic or as a novel involves sets of conventions and expectations even when the text is contesting or undermining them. A claim about a generic model is not an asser- tion about some property that all works that might be attached to this genre possess. It is a claim about fundamental structures that may be at work even when not manifest, a claim which directs attention to certain aspects of a work, which mark a tradition and an evolution, that is to say, dimensions of transformation. The test of generic categories is how</page><page sequence="6">884 NEW LITERARY HISTORY far they help relate a work to others and activate aspects of works that make them rich, dynamic, and revealing, though it is crucial to stress that interpretation of individual works is not the goal of poetics, which seeks to understand how systems of literary discourse work. What about lyric, then, which constitutes a particularly interesting generic problem? Aristotle has little to say about it. Lyric was an impor- tant literary mode of his day but, perhaps because it is fundamentally nonmime tic, it is not taken up in the Poetics. Lyric was finally made one of three fundamental genres during the romantic period, when a more vigorous conception of the individual subject made it possible to conceive of lyric as mimetic: mimetic of the experience of the subject. Distinguished by its mode of enunciation, where the poet speaks in propria persona, lyric becomes the subjective form, with drama and epic as alternately the objective and the mixed, depending on the theorist. Hegel gives the fullest expression to the romantic theory of the lyric, whose distinguishing feature is the centrality of subjectivity coming to consciousness of itself through experience and reflection.9 The lyric poet absorbs into himself the external world and stamps it with inner con- sciousness, and the unity of the poem is provided by this subjectivity. This conception of the lyric no longer has great currency in the academic world. In a notorious article, "Genre Theory, the Lyric and Erlebnis," René Wellek concludes that the idea of lyric, at least in the conception inherited from the poetic theory of German romanticism as an expression of intense subjective experience, does not work. "These terms cannot take care of the enormous variety, in history and differ- ent literatures, of lyrical forms and constantly lead into an insoluble psychological cul de sac: the supposed intensity, inwardness and imme- diacy of an experience which can never be demonstrated as certain and can never be shown to be relevant to the quality of art. . . . The way out is obvious," he continues; "One must abandon attempts to define the general nature of the lyric or the lyrical. Nothing beyond generalities of the tri test kind can result from it."10 Wellek proposes that we focus instead on describing particular genres, such as the ode, elegy, and song, their conventions and traditions - a not very promising strategy for nineteenth- and twentieth-century poetry, certainly, where many of the most interesting lyrics do not seem to belong to those particular genres or subgenres. It would be a major theoretical and practical failure to ignore a vast group of poems, which in fact depend upon a conceptual frame for their effect. A more recent critique of "lyric" ends up with a surprisingly similar conclusion. What some have called "the new lyric studies" is best ob- served in Virginia Jackson's book, Dickinson's Misery and in a set of short</page><page sequence="7">LYRIC, HISTORY, AND GENRE 885 papers in PMLA of January 2008, of which the introduction by Jackson and Rei Terada's contribution are the most significant. In Dickinson's Misery, Jackson describes the process of lyricization or lyrical reading whereby the various kinds of writing in which Emily Dickinson engaged were made by editors and critics into lyric poems. She argues that it is criticism that has made Dickinson into a lyric poet, according to a par- ticular model of lyric, as expression of the attitudes of a lyric persona, whereas for her producing this verse was continuous with other mundane activities such as writing letters to friends, working in the garden, et cetera. Extending M. H. Abrams' argument in The Mirror and the Lamp concerning the lyric as poetic norm and Paul de Man's conception of "lyrical reading," Jackson explores the process whereby the lyric takes form during the nineteenth century "through the development of vari- ous reading practices . . . that eventually become the practice of literary criticism."11 In the process, as "poetic subgenres collapsed into the ex- pressive romantic lyric of the nineteenth century, the various modes of poetic circulation - scrolls, manuscript books, song cycles, miscellanies, broadsides, hornbooks, libretti, quartos, chapbooks, recitation manu- als, annuals, gift books, newspapers, anthologies - tended to disappear behind an idealized scene of reading progressively identified with an idealized mode of expression."12 Jackson argues for a critical history of this process of lyricization, a project I am happy to endorse. Where we disagree is that she seems to want to dissolve the category of lyric in order to return us to a variety of particular historical practices - though this is not entirely clear. She does not tell us how she thinks we should treat Dickinson's verse if we do not approach it as lyric; whereas I think that a critical history of lyricization should lead us to a more capacious understanding of the lyric tradition that is not restricted to either to the idea of the decontextualized expres- sion of subjectivity or what I take to be its successor, the model of the dramatic monologue with a speakers whose situation, attitude, and goals we should novelistically reconstruct. A process theory of genre, such as Ralph Cohen's, enables us to study historically the transformations of a genre, as the system of literary genres undergoes immense changes, while appreciating continuities. I would add that the historical construction of lyric is carried out by poets as well as critics, so we can study the struggle between William Wordsworth's move to constructing lyrical ballads, attaching lyric to the modest anecdote rather than taking the ode as paradigmatic for lyric, and John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley's exploitation of that latter strain in new and powerful ways. Observing particular shifts in the lyric does not, though, prevent one from maintaining a broad conception of</page><page sequence="8">886 NEW LITERARY HISTORY lyric as genre and its historical tradition. Conceiving of a broad range of possibilities for lyric in many periods and languages can help prevent a certain narrowing of the conception of lyric and a tendency, under- standable given the realities of literary education today, to treat lyric on the model of narrative, so that the dramatic monologue becomes the model of lyric.13 A broadly historical and, I would add, transnational conception of lyric enhances critical understanding. But let me narrow my inquiry to exploration of some historical continuities and discontinuities that make the concept of a lyric genre valuable. Northrop Frye, in arguing that the basis of genre distinctions is what he calls the radical of presentation, identifies an underlying structure of lyric: The lyric poet normally pretends to be talking to himself or to someone else: a spirit of nature, a muse, a personal friend, a lover, a god, a personified ab- straction, or a natural object. . . . The radical of presentation in the lyric is the hypothetical form of what in religion is called the T-Thou' relationship. The poet, so to speak, turns his back on his listeners, though he may speak for them and though they may repeat some of his words after him.14 One way in which lyrics may hyperbolically mark this combination of indirection and address is through the figure of apostrophe, a turning aside from supposedly real listeners to address to someone or something that is not an ordinary, empirical listener, such as a nightingale, an urn, or one's own poem. I have been interested in the neglect of this rather striking figure by most accounts of lyric, even discussions of the ode, where it is of course endemic, and have speculated that this absence of critical attention indicates that apostrophe represents what is most embarrassing in lyric: the pretension to vatic action that critics prefer to evade, as they discuss instead, for instance, the theme of the power of poetic imagination - a serious matter that ought not to be linked to an empty "o" of address: "O Wild West Wind . . ."15 Apostrophe works to constitute a poetic speaker taking up an active relationship to a world or element of the world constructed as addressee, an addressee which is often asked to respond in some way, as if the burden of this apostrophic event were make something happen, as in Shelley's address to the wild west wind, Be thou spirit fierce, my spirit, Be thou me, impetuous one... Be through my lips to unawakened earth The trumpet of a prophecy . . .16 The wind should respond, in the terms the verse suggests.</page><page sequence="9">LYRIC, HISTORY, AND GENRE 887 The fundamental characteristic of lyric, in this account, is not the description and interpretation of a past event but the performance of an event in the lyric present, a time of enunciation. What lyrics demand of the world is often something to be accomplished by the performativ- ity of lyric itself. With Charles Baudelaire's "Sois sage, o ma douleur," douleur is to be assuaged by this familiar address, which constructs it as a child through the familiar, chiding address, "sois sage!" Rainer Maria Rilke's lines from the ninth Duino Elegy address the earth: Erde, ist es nicht dies, was du willst, unsichtbar in uns erstehn? - Ist es dein Traum nicht, Einmal unsichtbar zu sein?17 [Earth, isn't this what you want, to arise invisible within us? Is it not your dream to be, one day, invisible?] The claim is that the things of the world, addressed as subjects, would desire, like all subjects, to transcend a purely material condition and become spirit. If earth can be addressed and have desires, it must want to be a spirit, to be invisible, and the speaker boldly agrees to help: Erde, unsichtbar! Was, wenn Verwandlung nicht, ist dein drängender Auftrag? Erde, du liebe, ich will. [Earth, invisible! What is your urgent command if not transformai ton. Earth, you darling, I will.] The speaker agrees to attempt this transformation willed by earth, which the poem hopes to accomplish, constructing Earth as addressee. In locating lyric value in a certain performativity, I have essentially treated it as an active form of naming, which performatively seeks to create what it names, and may fail or succeed in this extraordinarily arrogant ambition. Apostrophe, which in this account can be identified with the ambi- tions of lyric, is not just one trope among others but a troping on the circuit of communication or situation of address, a turning aside from whatever is taken to be the real or normal addressee (in forensic ora- tory, the judge) to some other entity which is not an ordinary, present addressee. Apostrophes foreground the act of address, lift it out of ordinary empirical contexts, and thus at some level identify the poetic act as ritualistic, hortatory, a special sort of linguistic event. So, William Blake's "The Sick Rose," addressing the rose, "O rose, thou art sick," constitutes it as addressee:</page><page sequence="10">888 NEW LITERARY HISTORY O rose, thou art sick; The invisible worm That flies in the night In the howling storm Has found out thy bed Of crimson joy, And his dark secret love Does thy life destroy.18 This is a poem that has provoked a good deal of critical discussion, especially because other texts of Blake's do not treat sexuality as a dark, destructive secret - except insofar as a perverted religious and social order constrains and represses it. Critics argue about this poem's take on beauty and human sexuality: is this a poem of beauty destroyed by evil, or a critique of the myth of female flight and male pursuit, or a representation of a puritanical, misogynistic male speaker who imputes sickness to any rose or woman whose bed is a site of sexual pleasure? We seem to have a scenario in which a phallic force has invaded the rose's bed. But Blake in one draft changed "his dark secret love" to "her dark secret love," making the invisible worm feminine, before changing it back again, suggesting that, for him at least, this is not a straightforward male-female scenario, with the rose as the woman and the worm as male sexuality.19 Blake himself seems to have been convinced that social and religious structures which keep fantasies from leading to action were a source of illness: "He who desires and acts not breeds pestilence," he wrote. And there is a highly relevant sequence in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night "She never told her love, / But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,/ feed on her damask cheek" (and, of course damask is a rose).20 But I am interested in the function of the address to the rose, which in this version of lyric works to constitute it as a sentient creature, a potential listener, or rather, such address presupposes an animate listener, as in Alphonse de Lamartine's apostrophic question, "Objets inanimés, avez vous donc une âme?"21 [You inanimate objects, have you a soul?] The difference between asking "Do inanimate objects have a soul" and asking them whether they have a soul is that the latter presupposes the animicity by the act of addressing the question to them and constitutes the first person speaker who is reciprocally implied by the you as a vi- sionary. The energy of poetic address creates a surprisingly strong sense of prophetic revelation and marks this speech act as poetic discourse. If one has trouble figuring out what the speaker is doing in saying "O Rose, thou art sick," it is because this statement does not correspond to any everyday speech act, and the simplest answer to what the speaker</page><page sequence="11">LYRIC, HISTORY, AND GENRE 889 is doing is something like "waxing poetical." Address to the rose, which personifies it as sentient creature with a life of its own, creating an I-thou relation between poetic subject and natural object, works to create the subject as bardic, visionary voice, and can be inscribed in the tradition of poetry that seeks to make things happen by acts of naming. Paradoxi- cally, the more such poetry addresses natural or inanimate objects, the more it proffers figures of voice, the more it reveals itself at another level as not spoken, but as writing that through its personification engenders an image of voice, for the readers to whom it presents itself again and again. By addressing the flower or other nonempirical listeners the poet works to constitute him- or herself as poet, in the tradition not just of epic, with its address to the muse, but of lyric. Whether we think of apostrophic poems as establishing an I-thou rela- tion with the universe, whose elements they constitute as addressees, or whether we see them as acts of radical solipsism, constituting a world with projections of the self, the apostrophic act works to constitute the poetic voice as vatic agent and thus to foreground the poetic act itself. Paul de Man, in a notoriously difficult paper, "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," analyzes Baudelaire's apostrophic poem "Obsession" - "Grands bois, vous m'effrayez comme des cathédrales!" - as a translation of the celebrated "Correspondances" into lyric intelligibility. De Man treats the lyric genre as a "defensive motion of the understanding," designed to make the world intelligible if oppressive (by contrast with what he sees as the ultimate unintelligibility of the pre-text that "Obses- sion" transforms, "Correspondances.")22 His analysis tempts readers to prefer the enumeration of the end of "Correspondances" (which he calls a "stutter") to the lyrical operation set in motion by apostrophic address, but his implicit disparagement of the lyric only strengthens my inclination to explore the generic tradition of the lyric and the relation of apostrophic address to it. The notion of the lyric as a genre which undergoes historical trans- formatons leads one to consider the historicity of this lyrical function of address, as an aspect of that generic history. So we might compare Blake's address to the rose with Edmund Waller's "Go, lovely Rose" of a century earlier.23 Go, lovely rose! Tell her that wastes her time and me That now she knows When I resemble her to thee, How sweet and fair she seems to be.</page><page sequence="12">890 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Tell her that's young, And shuns to have her graces spied, That hadst thou sprung In deserts where no men abide, Thou must have uncommended died. Small is the worth Of beauty from the light retired; Bid her come forth, Suffer herself to be desired, And not blush so to be admired. Then die, that she The common fate of all things rare May read in thee; How small a part of time they share, That are so wondrous sweet and fair!24 Addressing the rose and urging it to speak and then to die seems a dif- ferent sort of gesture here, for though it is certainly a distinctively poetic act it has a social dimension missing in the Blake: the rose is lovely like the lady, asked to serve as a concrete instantiation of the poetic act of comparison, but it is also the messenger, the go-between, a metonymical extension of the speaker. By invoking the rose, this speaker does not so much constitute himself as bardic voice as engage in social indirection. By apostrophizing the rose rather than addressing the beloved directly, and telling the rose what to say to the beloved, the speaker makes the argument about virginity more gracious, less aggressive and self-serving, than it would be if he directly told the imagined beloved, "suffer yourself to be desired." This apostrophic poem does indeed involve a turning away from a possible empirical listener, the lady, to another addressee, which is animated by this poetic address, but the animation is not an intensification or an instantiation of bardic power so much as gracious and witty indirection, a social gesture. Though there is a certain poetic extravagance in willing the rose to speak, giving it lines to utter, and directing it to die, the trope of apostrophe seems here to install us in a social situation rather than extract us from it, as so often happens in the apostrophic lyrics of the romantic period. Frye's model of lyric as address overheard (following John Stuart Mill's initial formulation) makes apostrophic address one possibility, but it also allows for others, such as poems explicitly addressed to no one or noth- ing, which are generally taken as meditative, as if we were overhearing the poet speaking to himself or herself, and poems addressed to persons,</page><page sequence="13">LYRIC, HISTORY, AND GENRE 891 living or dead, real or imaginary, which modern criticism has tended to treat as miniature dramas that we overhear. One modern theoretical model takes literary works as fictional imitations of real world speech acts - the novel as fictional history or fictional biography, for example - and in this account, the lyric is a fictional representation of a personal utterance. It is as if every poem began, "For example, I or someone might say. . . ."25 Confronted with a lyric, we interpret it by asking what is the situation of the speaker (not to be identified with the poet) and attempt to work out what would lead someone to speak thus and feel thus. I would argue that the dominant modern notion of the lyric - at least in Anglo-American criticism, and especially in textbooks for the study of poetry - is the dramatic monologue, in which we overhear a speaker responding to a situation. Criticism of the modern lyric, or modern criticism of the lyric in gen- eral, has challenged the romantic conception of lyric as the direct or sincere expression of emotion, but in so doing, it has allowed emphasis to fall on the importance of thinking of the speaker of lyric as a persona created by the poet rather than as the poet him- or herself. If the speaker is a persona, then interpretation of the poem is a characterization of the persona, as if he or she were a character in a novel, and of the situation in which the event of speech occurs. Though there is separation of the discourse of the lyric from the life of the poet as historical-biographical figure, emphasis falls on the lyric as a representation of consciousness, and ideally of a drama of consciousness.26 Some of the reasons for the dominance of this model are, very schematically, (1) the post-Enlighten- ment assumption of the priority of experience over reflection,27 (2) the increasing priority in literary education of the model of prose fiction, where narrators and point of view are central, (3) modernism's claim to objectivity, and the consequent stress on the poem as artifact rather than statement by the poet, and (4) the New Criticism's insistence that interpretation focus on the words on the page rather than the intentions of the author, so that it became a point of doctrine that the speaker of a lyric is to be treated as a persona, not the poet him- or herself. William Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks write in their history of criticism, "Once we have dissociated the speaker of the lyric from the personality of the poet, even the tiniest lyric reveals itself as drama."28 There are numerous reasons to resist this normative model of lyric as dramatic monologue: it pushes lyric in the direction of the novel by adopting a mimetic model and focusing on the speaker as character, and it neglects all those elements of lyric - including rhyme, meter, refrain - not drawn from ordinary speech acts. But an alternative model of lyric emerges from Greek and Roman literature, illustrating the importance</page><page sequence="14">892 NEW LITERARY HISTORY of treating lyric as a continuing genre that undergoes historical transfor- mations. In The Idea of the Lyric, Ralph Johnson writes, "Lyric as inherited from the Greeks was sung to an audience, so that there is a you as well as an /, 'a speaker, or a singer,' talking to, singing to, another person or persons."29 Modern conceptions of the lyric, he complains, have led us to imagine that the lyric in general is to be understood as the solipsistic meditation of an individual, expressing or working out personal feelings, if not the impersonal statement of someone unable to communicate, whereas in the classical model, "I" and "you," speaker and listener, are, according to Johnson, directly related to one another in a community. Now a lot could be said about the familiar move that opposes public to private, speech to writing, integrated to alienated, but Johnson's argu- ment at least alerts us to the potential importance of address, though it does lead us to ask whether the forms of address in the classical lyric do really indicate an integrated community. Though there are many second-person pronouns in Greek and Latin lyrics, they very rarely designate a community the poet could be said to address directly. Sap- pho's only complete poem is a complex invocation of Aphrodite where the discourse addressed to Aphrodite quotes how the Goddess herself on previous occasions invoked Sappho: "What is it now? Who, O Sap- pho is wronging you?"30 This configuration is very striking and unusual, giving concrete form to what for later poets could only be wished for: that the figures invoked would actually respond. And Sappho's most famous poem - "He seems to me equal to the Gods, that man who sits opposite you and listens close to your sweet speaking. . . ." - addresses the girl whose sweet speaking and laughing "puts the heart in my chest on wings." "When I look at you, even a moment, no speaking is left in me, no: my tongue breaks and thin fire races under the skin. . . ."31 Critics trying to imagine directness here have suggested that this might have been sung at a wedding celebration, praising the bridegroom as a god while describing a powerful erotic reaction to the bride, but this is a certainly a stretch (and of course the poem is incomplete) . What we have is both extremely powerful and hard to imagine spoken directly to the you as its audience. We find here a structure of trian giated address fundamental to lyric. If we look to Horace and Catullus for models of lyric, we find, first, that they do not address the Roman people, the most obvious possible community. Of eighty-seven poems in the first three books of Horace's Odes, only nine are addressed to no one and twenty-three to nonhuman addressees (including gods and goddesses) , but the address to human you % I argue, does not function in a radically different way from apos- trophic address. The pronouns do not designate the true audience for</page><page sequence="15">LYRIC, HISTORY, AND GENRE 893 the poems. Even the poems addressed to historical individuals seem designed to honor them (as a dedication would today) rather than to tell them something they need to know, but the real test case is the cor- pus of poems addressed to people regarded as fictional (many of them given Greek names) . How do these work? One of the most famous, the fifth ode of Book One, is addressed to Pyrrha. Quis multa gracilis te puer in rosa perfusus liquidis urget odoribus grato, Pyrrha, sub antro? cui fiavam religas comam, simplex munditiis? heu, quotiens fidem mutatosque deos flebit, et aspera nigris aequora venus emirabitur insolens, qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea; qui semper vacuam, semper amabilem sperat, nescius aurae fallacis! miseri, quibus intemptata nites! me tabula sacer votiva paries indicat uvida. suspendisse potenti... vestimenta maris deo. What slim youngster soaked in perfumes is hugging you now, Pyrrha, on a bed of roses deep in your lovely cave? For whom are you tying up your blonde hair? You're so elegant and simple. Many's the time he'll weep at your faithlessness and the changing gods, and be amazed at seas roughened by black winds, but now in all innocence he enjoys your golden beauty and imagines you always available, always loveable, not knowing about treacherous breezes - I pity poor devils who have no experience of you and are dazzled by your radiance. As for me, the tablet on the temple wall announces that I have dedicated my dripping clothes to the god who rules the sea.32 Classicists, influenced by modern critical practice, have now begun to treat this poem as a dramatic monologue. One writes that the speaker "is addressing Pyrrha and as we read we gradually come to understand their story and their characters."33 To understand the poem, then, would</page><page sequence="16">894 NEW LITERARY HISTORY be to read it as the fictional representation of a real world speech act of address and thus to try to reconstruct the situation of utterance, the relation of speaker and hearer to one another (with as much of their history as is relevant and inferable), and the aim or purpose of the speaker's utterance. To read the poem in this way certainly gives readers something to do, but it involves a great deal of speculation, and many simple questions are hard to answer. Where does this speech act take place, for instance? And why would the speaker say this to Pyrrha? Is the speaker supposed to have stumbled upon Pyrrha in a cave, being amo- rously pressed by a gracile youth unknown to him? Presumably not - we don't imagine he interrupts the love scene to put the question - but if we posit that he encounters Pyrrha elsewhere, in the street, for instance, it is hard to imagine the motivation for the question, "What slim youngster is pressing you now?" Or if we take this as a wittily hyperbolic version of "so who are you seeing these days?" then it is hard to imagine the circumstances or rationale for the comments that follow, which would be better addressed to a young man. This is especially true, given the order of the comments about this young lover: one might imagine someone saying, "I'm sure he is dazzled by your radiance now, not realizing that the future will bring storms," but the converse - "Many's the time that he will weep at your faithlessness. . . . though he is dazzled now" - seems much more like musing about the vicissitudes of love than an utterance to the woman on a specific occasion. If we try to imagine lines five to thirteen addressed to Pyrrha, it makes the poem obscure rather than clarifies it, whereas if we think of the poem as a disquisition on the vicissitudes of love directed at an imagined Pyrrha, apostrophized in the lyric present, the poem makes much more sense. And the final lines come to emphasize the speaker's position as worldly wise, not jealous of the youth who may have supplanted him (as the one might suppose he was if the poem were really spoken to Pyrrha) . The speaker announces that he is no longer engaged in such matters, which he can now view with wry amusement. Rather than a dramatic monologue representing a real world speech act addressed to Pyrrha, we have an addressee imagined for rhetorical purposes. Why not take the ode as an act of poetic address:, writing which imagines the addressee as it imagines the gracile youth, with his present excitement and his future disappointments, and whose act of addressing, precisely because it does not seem focused on the referent of the pronoun, is more likely to attain the reader? We could say, in fact, that the key question is, whom is the poem seeking to persuade? In ancient Greece, poetry was a form of epideictic discourse, a rhetorical transaction and instrument of ethical paideia.</page><page sequence="17">LYRIC, HISTORY, AND GENRE 895 The audience was expected to make observations ( theôros) , about what is praiseworthy, worthy of belief. In Plato's Protagoras, where the pro- tagonists discuss the arguments of a poem by Simonides in order to reach conclusions about the world, everyone takes it for granted that, as Protagoras says, the most important part of a man's paideia is to be capable concerning verses - capable of judging which sayings of poets are well-crafted and valuable and to give reasons when questioned. (Socrates argues, against the received view, that people ought to discuss dialectic rather than poetry).34 So, whom does this poem seek to persuade, and of what? Not Pyrrha - she is not addressed so as to be persuaded to act differently, for her behavior is compared to the natural changeableness of the sea. More plausibly, the gracile youth, or rather, since he is not addressed at all, but pitied, as one of many "Miseri," perhaps all those "poor devils" who don't anticipate the storms that will come. One could certainly argue that it is the audience of the poem that is to be persuaded to adopt the attitude that the speaking voice projects of knowledgeable wariness, accepting what comes. Pyrrha is elegant and not to be shunned; the youth should enjoy himself now, but not get too involved, for reversals will occur, suffering will follow. There is a time for everything, says the wise man, retiring from the amorous fray. Now there are a few of Horace's odes that should be read as dramatic monologues (such as Natis in usum, 1.27) - where to make sense of the poem we really do have to imagine a context of utterance and work out why in these circumstances someone would say just these words. But they are rare, whereas this sort of structure - address to a you in a situation better left indeterminate - is extremely common. The second person address functions above all to place the act of lyric speech in the lyric present and to accentuate the paradox of poetry, that evokes immediacy while adopting a temporality of deferral, as it repeats itself for readers in a future not even imagined, and articulates an attitude whose appropriateness future audiences of readers are to judge. In a strange article entitled "The View from Halicarnassus," Jeffrey Walker argues that Pindar's encomiastic verse provides the proper model for lyric - lyric is the original form of epideictic rhetoric - and that be- cause of a "brilliant mistake" by Aristotle, who failed to honor the Greek notion of lyric, criticism has ever since possessed only a model for minor poetry, what he calls the "apostrophic lyric," where lyric discourse is not public, argumentative discourse, but private ejaculation.35 It is ironic that Walker seeks to trivialize the modern lyric by calling it "apostrophic," since until recently critics universally treated apostrophe, when it occurs in modern lyrics, as a purely conventional element inherited from the</page><page sequence="18">896 NEW LITERARY HISTORY classical tradition. But Walker is right to emphasize that the classical model helps us towards a more capacious and apposite notion of lyric (Whether Pindar, as opposed to, say, Horace, is really a good model for the lyric tradition is a different question) . Only a broad concept of lyric, with its sweep across eras and languages, provides the scope to activate possibilities occluded by narrower conceptions, such as that of the ode or elegy, useful though they may be. In particular, the classical example reminds us that the model of the dramatic monologue - a speaker - character whose situation and aims need to be reconstructed novelistically - forecloses important traditional aspects and potentials of lyric - especially those features, from rhythm and sound patterning to performative address, by which it differentiates itself from narrative fiction and mimetic modes generally. In an afterword to the PMLA issue on genre, Bruce Robbins compares notions of genre to the norms in the socioeconomic realm that allow, for instance, transnational comparison of living standards and argues that the case of genre in a nutshell is that of historical comparison.36 Genre, he maintains, is a crucial instrument combatting the profes- sional inclination to focus on a literary period - which he calls "a sort of pseudo-anthropocentric norm that has been adopted for a long time out of laziness. It is one level of magnification among others, no less valid than any other but also no less arbitrary." Genre, he insists, offers us "versions of history that take us beyond the period-by-period agenda of our ordinary studies." Foregrounding the generic cateogry of lyric, for instance, helps promote the possibility of comparisons with other tradi- tions, and allows us, for example, to see that it is perhaps only because the greatest systematic philosopher of the west, Aristotle, wrote a treatise on mimetic literature and did not include lyric that lyric has not been seen as a foundational genre in Western culture until the romantic era., whereas it is in other cultures, whose literature did not originate in epic or tragedy.37 "Why," Robbins concludes, "would criticism voluntarily deprive itself of this additional scale of transperiodic vision and the aggregations it brings into view?"38 Whether or not notions of genre are what make possible a literary history, as Ralph Cohen's work suggests, they certainly can connect various narrower modes of reading and interpretation and enlarge our vision of historical discursive possibilities. A. R. Animons, in a posthumously published poem, "Aubade," evokes the "you" of poetic address and its history: that "you" has moved out of the woods and rocks and streams</page><page sequence="19">LYRIC, HISTORY, AND GENRE 897 and now is elusive, "nowhere to/be found or congratulated."39 When one writes "you," the poem suggests, "one lifts up one's voice to the/ lineations of singing." The "you" of lyric address "dwells in our heads now as a bit of/ yearning, maybe vestigial." Perhaps there is always a you in the lyric, whether expressed or not, whatever its variations, as lyrics strive to be an event in the special temporality of the lyric present. Often that you is expressed - the you of the beloved, or the wind, a flower, a yearning. But the lyric "you" is also a bit of language, a trope, and Animons concludes that this "nearly reachable presence" is also "some- thing/we can push aside as we get up to rustle up a/little breakfast." It is through preserving the notion of lyric as a genre, an open process of generic negotiation, that such historical variations in function and effect can be registered and analyzed.

C. Hosek and P. Parker (Ithaca, NY: Cornell Univ.

Thus the poem comes to be above all the representation of the experience of consciousness as it senses, investigates, recollects, and so on - not an idea distilled from past experience but the drama of consciousness as it engages some aspect of the human condition, and it offers the reader an experience rather than a truth. Langbaum goes on to describe an important nineteenth century form, the dramatic monologue, but does caution against the inclination to treat as dramatic monologue every poem where there seems to be a speaker other than the poet.

Epideictic rhetoric, which Walker argues derives from archaic lyric, includes panegyric, and unlike pragmatic rhetoric, which is directed towards decision, is directed to an audience that does not make decisions, kritês, but forms opinions in response to the discourse, which thus "shapes and cultivates the basic codes of value</page><page sequence="21">LYRIC, HISTORY, AND GENRE 899 and belief by which a society or culture lives." This holds, he argues, for the audience of Thucydides, Plato, and Sappho. And of course Horace aspires to revive the Greek lyric tradition of Sappho and Alcaeus. 35 Jeffrey Walker, "The View from Halicarnassus: Aristotelianism and the Rhetoric of Epideictic Song," in New Definitions of Lyric, ed.
