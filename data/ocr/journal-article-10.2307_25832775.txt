<plain_text><page sequence="1">German Studies 837 THE ROMANTIC ERA By Sheila Dickson, Lecturer in German, University of Strathclyde 1. General Studies Romantik-Brevier, ed. Hartwig Schultz, Stuttgart, Reclam, 283 pp., compiles an appealing selection of material for the browser. Brenner, Literaturgeschichte, 95-131, offers only a very superficial overview of the Romantic period. themes. Subjectivity and individualism are a main focus this year. Andrew J. Webber, The Doppelganger. Double Visions in German Literature, Oxford, Clarendon, xii + 379 pp., is a study of major importance which goes beyond a discussion of theory and practice of the motif to a searching analysis of subjective identity. There is an introductory chapter, and chapters on Jean Paul, E. T. A. Hoffmann, and Kleist, and W.'s subtle investigation of individual texts persuas ively elucidates his theoretical working model of the Doppelganger revealing epistemological, aesthetic and psychosexual patterns and structures. Rudiger Gorner, Grenzganger. Dichter und Denker im Da zwischen, Tubingen, Klopfer &amp; Meyer, 168 pp., has short chapters on Georg Forster, Holderlin, Chamisso and others, in which G. can only convey a brief impression of individualism, and does so in an appropriately idiosyncratic way. On the individualism of German Idealism, Remo Bodei, Dekompositionen. Formen des modernen Individuums, Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, Frommann-Holzboog, 400 pp., pays brief visits to Novalis and Holderlin and 'das unbekannte Ich'. Iris Denneler, Die Kehrseite der Vernunft. %ur Wider setzlichkeit der Literatur in Spataufklarung und Romantik, Munich, Fink, 361 pp., examines the contradictory interest in the non-rational and deviant in the former period and its reflection in works by Schiller, Kleist, Tieck, and E.T. A. Hoffmann. D. examines a broad range of rules and conven tions that are undermined and broken. Romanticism is thus inter preted almost exclusively as a reaction against the Aufkldrung. This is not so much an argument as a framework of interpretation, extending from social criticism to the role of the sexes to moral and aesthetic education. Edmund Brandl, Emanzipation gegen Anthropomorphismus: Der literarisch bedingte Wandel der goethzeitlichen Bildungsgeschichte (EH, 1, 1520), 1995, 886 pp., is a tremendously detailed examination of a progressive emancipation of the subject in a variety of aspects of life. The reader is swamped with details and diagrams, but the conclusions that emancipatory terms increase while anthropomorphic ones decrease, that Wilhelm Meister, Nachtwachen, Peter Schlemihl, and Prinzes sin Brambilla present the same conflicts in progressively radical terms,</page><page sequence="2">838 German Studies and that there is no question of a Classical/Romantic opposition here, are very flat. Also on the Romantic subject, Dirk von Petersdorff, Mysterienrede. %um Selbstverstdndnis romantischer Intellektueller (SDL, 139), x + 447 pp., examines antique and i8th-c. influences on early Romantic self-interpretation and the cult of genius. Romantic mythology and religion are discussed in detail, and in the context of a variety of early-Romantic writers. The result is a solid, well researched study, which contributes new ideas to the discussion in this area. On the Romantic individual Kuzniar, Goethe, has three essays, by M. B. Heifer on Lucinde, C. MacLeod on Winckelmann, Schlegel, and Kleist, and J. Pfeiffer on Kleist's letters. The first is an interesting textual interpretation, the second does not clearly distin guish between homosexual and androgynous, while the third goes no further than establishing the broad ambiguity of masculine feelings in this era. The cult of the individual is discussed further in Yvonne Patricia Alefeld, Gottliche Kinder. Die Kvndheitsideologie in der Romantik, Paderborn, Schoningh, 414 pp., which has a large amount of material on Novalis and a chapter on E. T. A. Hoffmann. Bernd Laroche, 'Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd schbn' Untersuchungen zur Struktur und Entwick lung der Bildnisbegegnung in der deutschen Literatur des 16.-19. Jahrhunderts (EH, 1, 1522), 1995, 371 pp., carefully reconstructs the role and significance of the portrait in Romantic literature with particular reference to Godwi and Die Elixiere des Teufels. The picture becomes removed from its relationship to reality and becomes a trigger for the observer's inner eye. The subjectivity and perspectivism of Romantic vision are illustrated by detailed textual reference, and therein lies the merit of the study. H. Eichner, 'Die deutsche Romantik ? Zeit des Umbruchs?', Akten (Vancouver), 1, 1-13, is more general, and considers Romanticism as a time of change in a descriptive summary of certain main ideas. On Romantic mythology, Walburga Losch, Der werdende Gott. Mythopoetische Theogonien in der romantischen Mythologie (BBNDL, 21), 274 pp., provides more background information than analysis of the specifics of the chosen subject. As a result it is a very general survey. Viktor Zirmunskij, Deutsche Romantik und moderne Mystik, St. Ingbert, Rohrig, 212 pp., is a reprint and a translation of a work which appeared in 1913, as a tribute to the author. Of related interest is P. Mayer, 'Reinventing the sacred: The Romantic myth of Jacob Bohme', GQ, 69:247-59. There are three essays on German literature in Romantic Geographies. Proceedings of the Glasgow Conference, September 1994, ed. Colin Smethurst, Glasgow, Univ. of Glasgow French and German Publications, xiv + 305 pp., by H.-W.

Herrmann, Volk, has essays on early igth-c. nationalism including Forster and Fichte. Paul Ridder, Gesund mit Goethe. Die Geburt derMedizin aus dem Geist der Poesie, Miinster, Lit, 386 pp., is disappointingly one-sided as the extremely technical medical discussion makes merely side-references to poets and poetry. genres. Winfried Freund, DeutscheMdrchen. Eine Einfuhrung (UTB, 1902), Munich, Fink, 198 pp., begins with a plea for a return to reading Mdrchen as 'poetische Botschaften der Hoffhung in diirftiger Zeit' instead of academic or psychoanalytical treatises (p. 14) but the individual readings do not offer convincing reasons. Pages 81-96 were missing from my copy. An Anthology of German Novellas, ed. Siegfried Weing, Columbia, SC, Camden House, xxii + 277 pp., includes several Romantic Novellen, and the text is annotated in English for undergraduate use. Detlev Kremer, Prosa der Romantik (SM, 298), vi + 221 pp., reviews major themes that motivate, and are reflected in, Romantic prose, such as imagination, love, the artist, and new mythology. The material and the argumentation can become very involved, and the study loses accessibility through its attempt at comprehensiveness. French, Women, has general chapters on gender, history, and genre, and a chapter on Caroline Schlegel-Schelling and Rahel Varnhagen, followed by a chapter on Bettine von Arnim's Goethes Briejwechsel mit einem Kinde and Die Gunderode. The former emphasizes the aesthetic form; letter-writing as an act of narration, the latter the highly personal form, affording Bettine the scope for ironic self-reflexivity. The role of Goethe's mother in the former work is examined and her importance emphasized. 2. Individual Authors arnim, bettine von. B. v. A., Tst Dir bange vor meiner Liebe?3 Briejwechsel mit Philipp Hbssli, ed. Kurt Wanner, Frankfurt-Leipzig, Insel, 244 pp., which includes letters and Hossli's diary, is a most interesting new source of material on B. and also more generally as a socio-historical document. There is a useful introduction to set the scene. Internationales Jahrbuch derB. v. A.-Gesellschaft, 6-7, 1994-95, nas essays by W. Schmitz, 'B. in Weimar' (109-42), which comments on</page><page sequence="4">840 German Studies cultural history and in particular Thomas Mann's sceptical comment ary in Lotte in Weimar on B.'s project of the 'gebildeter Kulturstaat'. I. Leitner and S. von Steinsdorff, 'Die vollkommenste Grammatik der Liebe, die jemals komponiert wurde' (143-57), discuss Goethe's Briejwechsel mit einem Kinde as a grammar, philosophy and theology of love, as poetic theory, and as the Bitdungsroman of the female artist, with B. eventually usurping Goethe as the personification of enthusi asm. The volume also contains an essay by I. Scheider, 'Griechenlyrik (1821-1828). Literatur zwischen Ideal und Realitat' (188-234), and publishes manuscripts by Helmina von Chezy, Gisela von Arnim, and Louise Otto-Peters. B. v. A., Lieder und Duette fiir Singstimme und Klavier. Handschriften, Drucke, Bearbeitungen, ed. Renate Moering, Kas sel, Furore, 88 pp., is an interesting new source of information for Germanists as well as musicians. In addition to the texts, Moering documents B.'s place in Romantic music and in Romantic art in general in a well-informed commentary. Also noted: B. Greiner, 'Echo-Rede und "Lesen" Ruths.

As Erzdhlwerk, Berne, Lang, 629 pp., examines semantic and narrative structures in a range of A.'s texts, arguing that each one, as a variation in theme, motif, and content, can only be understood in the context of the whole. He establishes an intertextuality of constants and variables in the areas of the erotic (love) and family, and professional, state-political and natural-cosmic orders. All levels either succeed, fail, or remain in an ambiguous state of suspension. Andermatt then discusses the charac teristics of A.'s narrative, which make interpretation difficult for the reader, links this fundamental ambivalence to Schlegel's concept of irony, then further contextualizes A.'s body of motifs into the Romantic discourse of analogy and polarity. This is a very ambitious project and is carried out carefully. The main value of the study is in its detail, as none of the conclusions are particularly new or surprising. Internationales Jb. der B. v. A.-Gesellschaft, 6-7, 1994^95, has two essays on Arnim, by R. Simon, 'Text und Bild. zu A. v. As Isabella von Aegyptert (168-87), wno examines allegorical levels of meaning and their 'fortschreitendes Verknupfen', and S. Nienhaus, A. v. As Aufhebung der Naturwissenschaften in der Poesie' (158-67), who examines A.'s final rejection of science in favour of art due to the latter's freedom of reference. R. Burwick, 'Physiology of perception: A. v. A.'s practical and historical aesthetics', Burwick, Imagination, 156-76, also emphasizes the importance of A.'s scientific studies and</page><page sequence="5">The Romantic Era 841 the polarity of science and art. This is supported by means of analogies between poetic reception and electric stimulation, between body and soul and the activity of electromagnetic forces. brentano, glemens. C. B., Sdmtliche Werke und Briefe, ed. Jurgen Behrens et al., vol. 32, Briefe. iv. 1808-1812, ed. Sabine Oehring, Stuttgart, Kohlhammer, 524 pp., continues this excellent edition, and covers an important period of correspondence in B.'s life. The texts are sensitively edited and hence accessible to the widest range of Romantic scholars. Requiem fiir eine romantische Frau. Die Geschichte von AugusteBufimann und C. B., ed. Hans Magnus Enzensberger (IT, 1778), 289 pp., is a new amended version of a 1988 publication, which now includes a capriccio, previously published in 1992. Susanne Scharnow ski, cEin wildes, gestaltloses Lied.' C. Bs Roman 'Godwi oder Das Steinere Bild der Mutter3, Wiirzburg, Konigshausen &amp; Neumann, 209 pp., is a most stimulating and convincing analysis of B.'s novel in the context of the letter novel, early Romantic thought, and, consequently, as a presentation of the themes of identity and communication as both epistemological and aesthetic questions. S.'s argument is firmly based on a convincing, and appealing, detailed analysis of the various components and levels of B.'s narrative. N. Saul, 'Clemens and the women. Gender, genre and madness in B.', PEGS, 64-65:161-81, examines B.'s games with gender identity which might suggest a progressive understanding of gender, but which are proved to be a reductive colonization of the female. Also noted: K. Klopschinski, 'tiber eine "wunderliche Begebenheit mit einem Kopf". Eine unbekannte Quelle zu C. Bs Geschichte vom braven Kasperl unddem schbnen AnncrV, DVLG, 70:600-09; G.

Weiss, 'Sudseetraume: Schlemihls Suche nach dem Gluck', Aurora, 56:111-26, interprets the importance of the South Pacific as a symbol of transcendence and a Utopian world, which even Schlemihl cannot reach in this life, neither through society with its master/slave hierarchy, nor through nature, which for Schlemihl is an object of observation, not a Rousseauian paradise. eichendorff, Joseph von.

Text und Varianten, ed. Harry Frohlich, Tubingen, Niemeyer, xiv 4- 642 pp., contains two published dramas and also E.'s sketches and fragmentary outlines of scenes. The editor leaves open the question of poetic quality and emphasizes the ideological and historical interest of these texts which document E.'s political</page><page sequence="6">842 German Studies views in the turbulent period 1804-54. The editorial policy of including earlier completed stages, but not immediate corrections or partial reworkings, in the main text, followed by the final version, is intended to retain the impression of 'work in progress' without making the reading of the text impossible. This work has been meticulously carried out to provide invaluable new sources for study of the author and the period. J. v. E., In freudenreichem Schalle. Eine Sammlung oberschlesischer Mdrchen, ed. Eckhard Grunewald, Wiirzburg, Bergstadt, 79 pp., is a new edition of these texts with critical commentary, helpful to the general reader, which puts the Mdrchen in context and details sources and motifs. Aurora, 56, has essays by A. Riemen on E.'s journey in the Harz in comparison with the travels of Goethe and Heine (1 ?16), W. Hentschel on general travelling experiences in the late 18th and early 19th c. (95-109), and A. Davidson, who uncovers traces of E. in Thomas Mann's Der Zauberberg (17-46). F. Heiduk provides information on the brothers E. as students in Breslau (127-32) and documents relating to the Jubelfeyer' of 1803 (133-48). I. Holtmeier continues her E. biblio graphy (149-54). Sabine Karl, Unendliche Frilhlingssehnsucht Die Jah reszeiten in Es Werk, Paderborn, Schoningh, 323 pp., examines the symbolism of each season individually, then links them with E.'s concepts of poetry, life and salvation. The textual analysis is persuasive, and the wider implications valuable. Johannes Kersten, E. und Stifter. Vom offenen zum geschlossenen Raum, Paderborn, Schoningh, 228 pp., compares the two authors' exploitation of spacial symbolism, with sections on such motifs as the forest, the mountains, and the garden. This is a descriptive study with careful attention to detail. Thomas Winkler, * Werkgenetische Untersuchung zu J. v. Es (Die J^auberei im Herbste3.

Heinz Rolleke, Stuttgart, Reclam, 1002 pp., is based on the Grimms' final edition, but includes all texts from earlier editions not reproduced in this. There is also a bibliography and an afterword. The volume is aimed at a non-scholarly audience. hauff, wilhelm. M. Thum, 'Re-visioning historical romance. Carnivalesque discourse in W.

H., Fantasy Pieces in CalloVs Manner, trans. Joseph M. Hayse, NY, Union College Press, xx 4- 327 pp., makes this collection in its entirety available to an English-speaking audience. It has useful explanatory notes on the text for non Germanists. This year's E. T. A. H.-Jb. has articles by C. Diedrichs (7-19) on H.'s Die Rduber and the games Hoffmann plays with his reader's expections and imagination, B. Reifenscheid (20-32) on H. as illustrator and the importance of the sketch and caricature as a stimulus for his literary work, and R. Heinritz and S. Mergenthal, Abgrunde des Schauerromans' (33-40), who compare motifs and techniques in H. and James Hogg, with Matthew Lewis as mutual source. The two former writers are shown to have transferred the religious to the psychological. R. Schmidt, 'Ein doppelter Kater?' (41-53), compares H.'s Kater Murr with Christa Wolf's Neue Lebensan sichten with reference to Bakhtin and Kristeva. (An English translation of this essay is published in Contemporary German Writers, their Aesthetics and their Language, ed. Arthur Williams, Berne, Lang, pp. 9-34.) Also in this volume of the Jahrbuch, H.-G. von Arburg, 'Der Physiogno miker als Detektiv und Schauspieldirektor: Johann Ludwig Christian Hakens Blicke aus meines Onkels Dachfenster in's Menschenherz (1802)' (54-68), and A. Obrich, 'Bibliographic der Sekundarliteratur uber E. T. A. H. 1981-1993, Teil 1, 1981-87'. Claudia Librand, Aporie des Kunstmythos. Die Texte E T. A. Hs (Litterae, 42), Freiburg, Rombach, 315 pp., traces a development from a negative aesthetic in Die Elixiere des Teufels and Der Sandmann to a positive aesthetic of mediation in Prinzessin Brambilla in which the two main characters can transcend the dualism of art and life. More minor works such as Meister Martin der Kufner and DerArtushqf are shown to trivialize or ignore the dualism, thus merely faking a synthesis. L.'s systematic approach offers an</page><page sequence="8">844 German Studies interesting avenue of interpretation. Johannes Wiele, Vergangenheit als innere Welt. Historisches Erzdhlen bei E. T. A. H. (EH, 1, 1554), 478 pp., establishes H.'s experience of history and politics and argues that historical narration enabled him to grapple with contemporary political issues, for example in Das Fraulein von Scuderi, and that H. thematized the problem of subjective mediation of the past by demonstrating it to be 'erzahlendes Neu-Interpretieren'. Doge und Dogaresse is discussed in particular detail, and the interpretation does yield interesting detail. Wulf Segebrecht, Heterogenitdt und Integration. Studien zu Leben, Werk und Wirkung E. T. A. Hs (Helicon, 20), Frankfurt, Lang, 231 pp., is a collection of S.'s publications over a period of almost 30 years. The material is not, therefore, new, and the less familiar essays were usually written for a quite specific context, such as an afterword in an edition or for a themed conference. Others offer biographical information on H. in Bamberg. Also on H. and Bamberg, two companion volumes by Rainer Lewandowski, director of the E. T. A. H. Theatre in Bamberg, make poetic and critical use of the theme in Sie sind auch kein Bamberger, wie ich hore, Bamberg, Frankischer Vlg, 1995, 137 pp., which is the text of a play, consisting in the main of H.'s writings and other contemporary sources, and Fiktion und Realitdt. E. T. A. H. und Bamberg, Bamberg, Frankischer Vlg, 1995, 251 pp., which is a lively, informative biographical investi gation, devolving in part from research for the play. There is much anecdotal information of interest on H.'s time in Bamberg, but L. also goes beyond this by considering his later works in the light of these experiences. Matias Martinez, Doppelte Welten. Struktur und Sinn zweideutigen Erzdhlens, Gottingen, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 227 pp., has a chapter on Der ^usammenhang derDinge in relation to purpose and chance in human action. He examines the role of vision and the relationship of life and art, two central themes in H.'s works, and presents an intelligent analysis of them. Also noted, S. Dickson, CE. T. A.

Internationale H.-Bibliographie (IHB) auf der Grundlage der JVeuerwerbungen des H.-Archivs des Wurttembergischen Landesbibliothek I993~I994- Quellen und Sekunddrliteratur, Rezeption und Rezensionen. 11. Materialband, ed. H.-Archiv, Werner Paul Sohnle, and Marianne Schutz, Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, Frommann-Holzboog, viii + 516 pp., is, like its predecessors, an invaluable source of information for H. scholars. F. H., ed. Heinz Ludwig Arnold and Andreas Dohler (TK, 7), 295 pp., has essays on H. as poet, writer, and thinker. H. Dittberner, 'Hs Stolz' (7-23) is a discursive introductory essay, while H.-J. Molles, 'Weltverzicht als Mannerwerk' (24-32), discusses</page><page sequence="9">The Romantic Era 845 H.'s earliest poetry as a statement on his struggles between theological duty and poetic desire. Also on poetry, R. Colombat analyses Abendphantasie' and 'Des Morgens' (79-90) as complementary perspectives on the possiblities of integrating the subject and the divine. W. Groddeck,' "Stutgard" oder "Die Herbstfeier"' (135-44), attempts to establish the authenticity of the edited versions of the text; M. Knaupp,'"... eine / Last von Scheitern ..."' (182-92), takes the same approach with 'Mnemosyne'. B. Boschenstein, 'Das Gut des Gesangs' (213-20), is another attempt at textual criticism, this time of 'Wie Meereskusten', to illustrate the paradox of a fragmentation which encompasses totality. M. Franz argues for 'Hs Gedicht "Andenken"' (195-212) to be understood as a monument to Susette Gontard after her death. On H.'s late poetry, C. Wingertszahn, '"Die Aussicht scheint Ermunterung." Hs spates Gedicht "Das frohliche Leben"' (223-36), demonstrates the highly sophisticated and artistic qualities of 'Das frohliche Leben' to prove the quality of this work, which is often only considered in the context of H.'s illness. The theme of this poem is shown to be a central motif in his last poems. H. Heissenbiittel, 'H. oder die Schwierigkeit, Poesie zu vertonen' (237-50), examines the relationship between language and music in general, and the lack of relationship between H.'s poetry and contemporary music in particular. On H.'s thought, J. Schmidt writes on 'Hs dichterische Rezeption der stoischen Ethik und Naturphilosophie' (33-50), followed by U. Gaier on 'H. und die Theorie der Organisation' (51-61), which examines the traditions (Herder in particular) on which H. drew. R. Gorner, 'Wanderungen zwischen den Extremen. Hs Sinngebung des Exzentrischen' (62-74), discusses the motif of the wanderer as an illustration of eccentric development. On history, K. Gratz, 'Der Ubergang vom Alten zum Neuen' (99-117), elucidates its increasing and changing importance in Der Tod des Empedokles. H. brings together two models of history, the Christian-eschatological and antique-cyclical, and demonstrates that the two can be compatible from the perspective of a single cycle. H. Bothe, 'Vom Versuch, ein deutscher Tyrtaus zu sein. Notizen zum Verhaltnis von Dichtung, politischer Tat und NationalbewuPtsein bei H.' (118-31), emphasizes the significance of reason in H.'s national ism and the links between poetry and politics. C. Anders (91-98) characterizes Hyperion as 'engagierte Literatur' and argues that the contemporary reader feels equally challenged. The volume also contains a 'Vita F. H.' (251-67) by H.-J. Malles and a selected bibliography by H.-J. Malles and Sarah Schmidt (268-92). Theresia Birkenhauer, Legende und Dichtung. Der Tod des Philosophen und Hs Empedokles, Berlin, Vorwerk, 607 pp., analyses the development of H.'s ideas on the Empedokles theme from his original project of Der</page><page sequence="10">846 German Studies Tod des Socrates. She argues persuasively that this parallels a develop ment in H.'s theory of tragedy which questions the autonomy of character by presenting extreme changes in states of consciousness in a character in conflict, thus dismantling the classical projection of Greek tragedy. Gisela Dischner, c... bald sind wir aber Gesang.' Zur H ~ Linie der Moderne, Bielefeld, Aisthesis, 250 pp., and Gert Hofmann, Dionysos Archemythos. Hs transzendentale Poiesis, Tubingen-Basle, Francke, xii + 264 pp., both review H.'s understanding of Dionysian concepts. The latter argues for Dionysos as representative of the aesthetic-creative state and a transcendental reflection of poetic activity, the former focuses on the creative process of the word in a world alienated from the gods and Dionysos as 'kommender Gott'. Both emphasize the importance of H.'s dialogue with his contempor aries, and D. uses this as a base to trace H.'s line of interpretation via Nietzsche (the first to understand it) to Rilke, George, Trakl, Benn, and Celan. Gedichte von F. H. Interpretationen, ed. Gerhard Kurz, Stuttgart, Reclam, 224 pp., presents interpretations of selected H. poems in some detail. The pitch is too high for the foreign learner, but there is reference material of interest for the Germanist. Also noted: R. Berbig, cEin Fest in den Hiitten der gastlichen Freundschaft: Zum Verhaltnis von Freundschaft und Heimat bei F. H.', MDU, B8:i57-75. kleist. Two volumes by Helmut Sembdner have been revised and reprinted, namely H. v. Ks Lebensspuren. Dokumente und Berichte der Zeitgenossen, Munich, Hanser, 542 pp., with new sources illuminating previously peripheral material, and H. v. KsNachruhm. Eine Wirkungsge schichte in Dokumenten, Munich, Hanser, 660 pp., with new material particularly on K.'s suicide. Kljb has the proceedings of a conference on 'Zeitgenossenschaften', with contributions on K.'s teacher Chris tian Ernst Wiinsch by C. Meiner (1 -32), which questions his influence on K.'s early works, and on Johann Daniel Falk by R. Wartusch (188-200), who rejects Helmut Sembdner's theory of mutual poetic influence. Another teacher, Heinrich August Kerndorffer, and the influence of contemporary theory of declamation, is investigated by M. Kohlhaufl (142-68). H.-J. Becker (35-49) presents Wilhelm Traugott Krug as a contrast to K. by means of their relationship with Wilhelmine von Zenge, and reviews Georg Christian Wedekind's career and political views as K.'s doctor in the intriguing period 1803-04. K. is put in a wider literary context byj. Knape (91-105), who compares early letters to their sisters by Goethe, Mozart, Brentano and K. as particularly intimate modes of communication, and by U. Japp, who writes on the contemporary comic theatre (108-20) to establish that K. was influenced by the widest possible range of sources, including contemporary theatre, and that evidence</page><page sequence="11">The Romantic Era 847 of the latter is present with respect to specific works rather than in general trends. K.'s own work is scrutinized by P. Michelsen (123-39), who considers the tragedy of Alkmene's recognition of the truth in Amphytrion, R. Gharbon (77-88), who analyses K.'s stance on race and racism in Die Verlobung, concluding that K.'s perspective is that of a white European, though not a racist, who undermines the whole concept of superiority of race, and S. Doering (171-86), who places K.'s Oriental references in the contemporary fashion for the Orient, but argues convincingly that K. was fundamentally interested in the mysteries of the human mind, which remain the same whatever the geography. The similarities and differences that characterize K.'s relationship to Romanticism are further emphasized by F. Strack (201-18), illustrated by K.'s critical exploitation of specific Romantic themes and motifs. A similar focus is evident in BKF which contains the proceedings of a conference 'K. and Brandenburg', as in this volume too contemporaries and predecessors figure far more strongly than K. himself. Gernot Muller, Man mufite auf dem Gemalde selbst stehen. K. und die bildende Kunst, Tubingen, Francke, 1995, viii + 336 pp., is a valuable investigation of K.'s dialogue with visual art in his ideas and works, which is placed in the context of his scepticism towards language and knowledge. M. identifies four phases and five forms of expression articulating the relationship between literature and visual art and examines each quite systematically. The final section on references to visual art in the Novellen is equally carefully written. Sean Allan, The Plays of H. v. K. Ideals and Illusions, CUP, xx + 315 pp., is an indispensable work of reference: it could make K.'s work more accessible to the English speaker by virtue of being written in English and providing translation of quotations and references to published English translations, and it will be a useful source for the general and specialist reader, documenting current research and controversies surrounding K. As an investigative study of ideals of perfection and transcendental metaphysics it contributes significantly to the Kleist debate. Bianca Theisen, Bogen-Schluss. Ks Formalisierung des Lesens, Freiburg, Rombach, 233 pp., examines the paradoxes of K.'s judge ments and conclusions in their implications for the reader, without radically changing our awareness of textual ambiguity. Johannes Endres, Das 'depotenzierte' Subjekt. Zu Geschichte und Funktion des Komischen bei H. v. K., Wurzburg, Konigshausen &amp; Neumann, viii + 222 pp., establishes a general context, from Lessing to Hegel, and projects forwards from Heine to Freud, before turning attention to K.'s comic strategy, by means of a careful reinterpretation of his reception of Schiller. The focus is thus wider than the title suggests, and E.'s survey shows evidence of careful research. Beatrice Martina Guenther, The Poetics of Death. The Short Prose of K. and Balzac, Albany,</page><page sequence="12">848 German Studies State Univ. of New York Press, x + 216 pp., locates the historical context of the authors' representations of death in their responses to Napoleon, but the chapters on K. analyse the stories in far more general terms as expressions of the awareness of the mortality of truth and knowledge which leads to a refusal to impose any single belief system, a subversion of the concept of 'Bildung' and a move from mimesis to self-referential narrative. In fact this study is very general and does not develop the investigation of the motif of death satisfactorily. Sabine Doering, H. v. K. (Literaturwissen fur Schule und Studium), Stuttgart, Reclam, 124 pp., 1S a useful and reliable introduction for undergraduate use. H.-J. Knobloch, cEin Traum in PreuPischblau', Aurora, 56:47-56, argues that Prinz Friedrich von Homburg encourages the regeneration of a new Prussian State, not that of the past, with an ideal, which is recognized as a Utopia, of community and humanity, but which justifies any aggression to defend it.

Kathariha von Hammerstein, 3 vols, DTV, 315, 305, 325 pp., collects the novels Das Blutenalter der Empfindung and Amanda und Eduard, poems and stories, such as Marie and Elise, and diaries and other prose. This is a useful body of material, and it is accompanied by helpful commentary and glosses. nachtwachen von bonaventura. Thomas Boning, Widersprii che. Zu den 'Nachtwachen von Bonaventuya' und zur Theoriedebatte, Freiburg, Rombach, 598 pp., takes Nietzsche and deconstruction as interpretat ive points of orientation to interpret the Nachtwachen as a modern if not postmodern text. The scope of the survey is extensive, and the reader is asked to cope with a large amount of material within a very loose framework. This detracts from the accessibility of the study, which offers, however, a significant new contribution to our under standing of the text. Also noted: Daniela Weiland, 'Wezel als Autor der N v.

There are interesting ideas and pertinent comments, but this is offset by a naive acceptance of such cliches as Sophie as 'uberirdisches Wesen' for N. (p. 52). N. features prominently in G. L. Schiewer, Cognitio symbolica (see p. 850 below). G. Rommel, 'Imagination in the transcendental poetics of N.', Burwick, Imagination, 95-122, stresses the need for an integrated approach to N.'s theoretical and poetic works. Knowledge is gained through a combination of poetry, reason and language. H. Uerlings, 'N. in Freiberg. Die Romantisierungdes Bergbaus',^rora, 56:57-77, takes an opposite position to T. Ziolkowski on Romantic institutions to argue for a split between professional and poetic activity, and the mine as symbol for an inward path with a necessary return to the surface. Neither is convincingly argued, and U. merely reiterates the importance of Freiberg and contemporary research for the development of this motif. Also noted: H. Hartmann, 'Die Poesie als Creator Spiritus: Klingsohrs Weinlied im Kontext des Heinrich von Ofterdingen\ MDU, 88:43-59. righter, jean paul. J.

Gotz Muller, Janina Knab, and Winfried Feifel, 2 vols, Weimar, Bohlau, xii 4- 936, x 4- 388 pp., is an invaluable source of material, in various stages of refinement, on J.P.'s thoughts, ideas, and personal experiences as building blocks for his literary production. The editorial apparatus is impressively comprehensive and systematic, without being overwhelming. Andreas Erb, Schreib Arbeit. J. Ps Erzdhlen als Inszenierung 'freier' Autorschaft, Wiesbaden, Deutsche Universitat, 266 pp., examines J.P.'s position as creative writer faced with the social and economic constraints of bourgeois society around 1800. His texts are shown to address the question of how genius can be achieved through a process of education. Heike Doll, Rollenspiel und Selbstinszenierung. %ur Modellfunktion des Theaters in J. Ps 'Titan' und cKomety (BSDL, 46), 255 pp., approaches the subject via chapters on Kate Hamburger, Lessing, and i8th-c. theory and practice, followed by J.P.'s theory of the novel and humorous theatre, and concludes that theatre is not just a model, but a sine qua non. The main focus of argument confirms the demand for and limits of individual autonomy in J.P.'s work. Stephen Fennell, Gleich und Gleich. Die Messianik bei J. P., Wiirzburg, Konigshausen &amp; Neumann, x 4- 237 pp., examines Messianic thought and its influence on J.P.'s narrative technique. A theoretical chapter is followed by chapters on individual works to ascertain relationships of identity in figurative language between author, hero, and God. The argument is interesting and F.'s line of approach is revealing. Elvira Steppacher, Kbrpersprache in J. Ps 'unsichtbarer Loge\ Wiirzburg, Konigshausen &amp; Neumann,</page><page sequence="14">85o German Studies 129 pp., examines the role of metaphor as mediator of body in language in expressing man's double nature as sensuous and spiritual being, then compares the narrator's 'suffering' with the Passion of Christ. This volume is in fact part of a longer dissertation, which may explain the disjointed and incomplete feel of the work. Rolf Vollmann, Das Tolte neben dem Schdnen, Frankfurt, Eichborn, 263 pp., assures the reader that 'keine Wissenschaft, sondern eher Scherz und Unterhal tung' will be found in this volume. Thus disarmed, the reader is likely to enjoy, and may learn much from this lively biography. Gesine Lenore Schiewer, Cognitio symbolica. Lamberts semiotische Wissenschaft und ihre Diskussion bei Herder, J. P. und Novalis (FN, 22), x 4- 283 pp., examines the influence of Johann Heinrich Lambert on Herder, and argues that both these thinkers influenced the theories of language and knowledge inJ.P.'s poetic conception and Novalis's philosophical work. The case is stronger with reference to J.P. and the study provides useful background material. schlegel, Dorothea. M. B. Heifer, 'Dorothea Veit-Schlegel's Florentin: Constructing a feminist Romantic aesthetic', GQ^ 69:144-60. schlegel, FRiEDRiGH. Claudia Brauers, Perspektiven des Unendlichen. F. Ss asthetische Vermittlungstheorie, Berlin, Schmidt, 368 pp., reinterprets the development of S.'s thought as a continuing process of restriction with his final position of Catholic Restoration as conclusion, rather than volte-face. This is an extremely careful, detailed study of S.'s writings between 1795 and 1818. Also noted: Albert Meier, '"Gute Dramen miissen drastisch sein": Zur asthet ischen Rettung von F.

Vol. v has useful appendices for reference. This is a high quality reproduction of an important source of information on the Romantic period. tieck, ludwig. William Crisman, The Crises of'Language and Dead Signs' in L.

The study builds on a solid appreciation of previous T. scholarship to develop an original and well-founded analysis of speech-acts, which suggest that T.'s enquiries prefigure 20th-c. language philosophy. Mara Nottelmann Feil, L. Ts Rezeption der Antike, Frankfurt, Lang, 270 pp., is a very useful survey of T.'s sources, and his changing attitude towards them. Wolfgang Rath, L. T: Das vergessene Genie. Studien zu seinem Erzdhlwerk, Paderborn, Schoningh, 548 pp., is an extremely solid piece of scholarship, illuminating T.'s life and life philosophy and their interaction with his work. The background material on Romanticism is valuable too. R. G. Pasler, 'Nachrichten von altdeutschen Gedichten. Anmerkungen zu L. Ts Handschriftenstudien in der Bibliotheca Vaticana', E. T. A. Hoffmann-Jb., 4:69-90, reconstructs T.'s work in the library and his textual editing of his sources. G. Opie, 'An indescribable terror: narrative strategies in Tieck's Der blonde Eckbert", Hunter, Short Story, 39-53, is a very basic expose of this text. wagkenroder. L. R. Furst, 'In other voices: W.'s Herzenser giefiungen and the creation of a Romantic mythology', Burwick, Imagination, 269-85, perceives this work as a fiction rather than a scholarly tract, and as an attempt to create an aesthetic religion based on the visionary rather than the visual. F. sees in this the Romantic idealization of the past and yearning for a Golden Age in the future.</page></plain_text>
