<plain_text><page sequence="1">Land Into Flesh: Images of Intimacy Susan J. Scarberry Native American poetry tends to be intimate in nature. The indigenous world views that it expresses hold kinship to be a fundamental fact of reality. Relationships between living beings and the land and the sky are experi- enced as cyclic and enduring, even as the world is con- tinuously being transformed. This interdependent char- acter of the cosmos creates a personalized reality where intimacy or a shared sense of closeness is made possible because the world is not objectified or abstracted; the world is connected through physical and spiritual com- prehension of relationships. Land and flesh are two expressions of the same reality. Before the turn of the century a young, pregnant Zuni woman, Lina Zuni, offered up a prayer for her husband who had been killed by whites. As she scattered corn meal at dawn she said to Sun Father and Mother Dawn: This from which we form our flesh, The white corn, Prayer meal, Shell, Corn pollen, I offer to you. 1 This reciprocal action of returning the substance of oneself-which has originally come from the earth-- back to the elements recognizes that blessings are possi- ble when one honors relationships. Pollination is both a symbolic and real way that plants and other creatures communicate and germinate growth. In southwestern Navajo/Apache and Pueblo cultures there are several powerful female deities who are associated with the sources of creation and cultivation. Grandmother Spider (Thought Woman) is the progen- itor of all life forms according to the Keres-speaking Pueblo. The Corn Mothers (Corn Woman) give life and protection to the Pueblo people. "The Pueblos thought ...that their bodies were basically composed of corn, and that as a result, both they and the grain shared a sim- ple corn-essence." 2 These sacred originators of plant life and agriculture, along with Changing Woman of Navajo and Apache cultures, can be considered deities of earth and vegetation, even though their powers go beyond the role of keeper of domestic plants. The Navajo Blessing- way story tells of Long-Life Boy and Happiness Girl -Changing Woman's parents-who were created from perfect ears of corn in First Man's medicine bundle.3 Talking God, father of Corn Girl, is said to have created some Navajo people from corn.4 In southeastern Indian tribes, too, there are creation stories that tell of Corn Mothers creating corn, and thus life for the people, out of their own bodies. Selu, Corn Woman of the Cherokee, was murdered by two boys who suspected her of being a Susan Scarberry is a doctoral candidate in comparative literature at the University of Colorado, Boulder where she has taught Native American literature and expository writing over the past five years. After receiving her B.A. from the University of California, Santa Barbara and her M.A. from the University of New Mexico, she undertook Ph.D. work at Colorado in Scandinavian and Native American literatures. Her dissertation, "Sources of Healing in House Made of Dawn" is concerned with transformative life-giving rituals in Jemez Pueblo and Navajo cultures. In addition to academic work, she hosts a weekly radio program of international ethnic music, "Crosswinds, " on the Boulder County public radio station. Scarberry recounts this personal experience pertaining to her article: "In October 19811 was travel- ing by train through eastern Idaho on my way to Boise to deliver a talk and slide presentation on images of land andflesh in contemporary Native American women's poetry. Sleeping on my stomach in a cramped roomette compartment, I awoke terrified. I had been dreaming that I was lying on the floor of a Los Angeles apartment during an earthquake. The tremors from the rails beneath me jostled my body into a visceral realization of the dynamic between land and flesh."

When she died, corn sprang up where her blood touched the earth, providing food for the people.5 Another example of a female deity as the seed/plant that nourished the world occurs in the Huron myth in which the slain Ataentsic's body yielded corn, beans, and squash.6 Food is the flesh of the land. The earth is a woman, sustaining her children with her body.This fundamental belief of tribal peoples recog- nizes the close physical and spiritual relationship between Mother Earth, as manifested in particular spirit persons such as Grandmother Spider, Changing Woman, and Corn Woman, and all living things. Land and human beings are one, bound together by the understanding that flesh takes many forms, that touch energizes the natural world. From birth to death, our bodies, as parts of nature, acquire new contours, reflecting our experience on earth. The earth nurtures us in our becoming. The land is essentially female, the mother of all, the nurturer, the provider, the sustainer. It is an ancient, fundamentally spiritual recognition that the land is Mother Earth's flesh and that the people are an extension of her. The original people were formed out of the land, even as we are. It is an everyday observation that the land and the people are reflections of one another: though not the same, not altogether different. As Paula Gunn Allen, a Laguna poet, says: "We are the land."7 This way of seeing, of knowing, recognizes an inter- dependency between all of the creatures on earth and the land herself. This way of seeing acknowledges a close- ness, a familiarity that we may feel if we recognize wind, trees, and rivers as relatives instead of external phenomena. This way of being acquires identity through the powers of touch and transformation. Through our flesh we experience a reciprocity with our environment as we receive and emit vibrations, impressions, and knowl- edge. Many contemporary Indian writers and thinkers from diverse tribal traditions express this connection be- tween humans and land in their writings. Indian women, in particular, have developed these "perceptions of being"' in their work as appropriate expressions of their life ex- periences. Images of land as woman and people as land- forms emerge, signifying that a special quality of being infuses both. These images, usually linked to a particular landscape, are more than anthropomorphic, more than metaphors or symbols for relationship; the images are a means of grasping and talking about real physical sensa- tion and traditional tribal knowledge, as reflected through an individual's angle of vision. This vision tends to be tribal and tends to be feminine but male Indian storytellers such as Simon Ortiz, Joseph Bruchac, and Lame Deer also possess this sensitivity, and they incorporate images of land and flesh into their own way of speaking. Other art forms, too, such as petro- glyphs of animals, plants, and humans may convey the immediacy of flesh emerging from the land. In oral and written literatures these images are often found in origin stories, portraits of children, lovers and old people, and in self-portraits. Origin stories of the people tell of this vital land/flesh connection and provide a literary model for contempor- ary writers who weave old tales into new forms. The oral tradition suffuses the written tradition with greater meaning, authority, and imagination. Thus poets like Leslie Marmon Silko and Paula Gunn Allen can draw upon their native Laguna Pueblo traditions and trans- form them. At Laguna the old stories tell of the people emerging through sipapu, a hole in the ground, into the present world. On one level this hole may be interpreted as a female womb representing fertility, sexuality, and procreation. Paula Gunn Allen has created poems focus- ing on Grandmother Spider, who brought the world out of her belly, and Corn Woman, who brought sustenance to the people, as important cultural figures in this tradi- tion. The closing words of Allen's "The Beautiful Woman Who Sings" are: beautiful. corn woman. woman like corn: ripe and full. sweet. self generating. tasseled. blowing in the wind. meeting. juicy. feeding. coming back every time. coming home. filling the fields with green. making the people dance. gathering. making the children laugh. making butterflies sing.8 The poet suggests here that Corn Woman is continually re-embodied in women of the tribe who grow to mirror Corn Woman's actions and sensuality. Not all Native American poets choose to model their poems on mythological figures whose bodies are associated with the land. Land/flesh images also may arise out of reflection about ordinary experience. Agnes Tso and Nia Francisco, however, do draw upon the rich complexity of Navajo mythological tradition that is available to them. The Navajo distinguish between types of rain. In a trilogy of rain poems, Agnes Tso writes of the cloud woman who moistens the earth to help people live. female rain she pregnant with rain child comes quite softly and gently in the night At dawn she gives birth to little droplets of rain and for days on end9 Nia Francisco's poem "Morning and Myself" reveals a knowledge of Changing Woman's rituals and chantway structure. i wake to see the morning from outside our home from within me</page><page sequence="3">26 FRONTIERS i walk at dusk to greet dawn boy his sister and their mother i say i am your grandchild and that i will meet you some day and as that i want to live of the flesh of earth of the flesh of water of the flesh of sky and I will always give the soles of my feet the water of my mouth the sweat beads of my skin the tears of my eyes the urine of myself the placenta of my babies and the cleansing water of our hair and bodies to earth to water and sky in peace i go now in peace we will walk and in beauty we walk10 Francisco's prayer is reminiscent of the land/flesh im- agery found in the sequences of body parts that are named and blessed in Blessingway and in Navajo healing chants. Also, Francisco's gift of the "waste products" of her body is reminiscent of Changing Woman's gift of her own flesh. Changing Woman created the ancestors of the Navajo by rubbing balls of epidermal waste, mixed with corn pollen, from her breast, back, and arms. Nia Fran- cisco speaks of sexuality and desire in "Tomorrow Noon," "Friday Noon Feelings," and in "Iridescent Child," a long poem of self-definition in which she boldly asserts her femininity. my body is curved and carefully carved at the touch of the wind sculptured like sexy mesas and sand stone cliffs11 Anita Endrezze-Danielson, a Yaqui, desires fertility and impregnation by a transformed bear-man in "Shaman/Bear." I dream of the season His spell will cause my belly to swell child-heavy my womb full as a Salmonberry moon.12 Simon Ortiz, an Acoma poet, describes the birth of his daughter Rainy Dawn in "To Insure Survival": You come forth the color of a stone cliff at dawn, changing colors, blue to red to all the colors of the earth.13 Joy Harjo (Creek) and Wendy Rose (Hopi) both have written a number of introspective poems in which they consider the nature of their relationship to land, sky, and sea. Harjo's "Fire" makes an impassioned statement about the fundamental inseparability of humans and the natural world. Breathing is a channel that allows inner and outer landscapes to communicate. a woman can't survive by her own breath alone she must know the voices of mountains she must recognize the foreverness of blue sky she must flow with the elusive bodies of night wind women who will take her into her own self look at me i am not a separate woman i am a continuance of blue sky i am the throat of the sandia mountains a night wind woman who burns with every breath she takes14 Rose, like Harjo, strives for wholeness and self- sufficiency, realizing that independence is compatible with close personal relationships. "The Parts of a Poet" appears in Wendy Rose's self-illustrated chapbook, Long Division: A Tribal History. Loving the pottery goodness of my body settled down on flowers, pulling pollen in great handfulls; full &amp; ready parts of me are pinned to earth, parts of me undermine song, parts of me spread on the water, parts of me form a rainbow bridge, parts of me follow the sandfish, parts of me are a woman who judges.15 Rose writes about "parts" or aspects of herself that are capable of endless transformation and identification with other forms of life. Her poetic ability to see connec- tions in the natural world and to name things properly gives her a fluid nature. As her own body extends into the land, Rose acquires womanly ripeness and vitality. Both Rose and Harjo end their poems with strong, self- assertive images that challenge the listener to contend with the power that the poets derive from the earth. Old people, too, possess long-term knowledge of ways</page><page sequence="4">Scarberry 27 of survival; for these gifts to the people, elders are to be respected. Simon Ortiz' poem "Curly Mustache, 101-Year-Old Navajo Man" describes a person who is so old that he is starting to recede into the landscape from which he has come: Motions with long hand, brown fingers shape the mountain ridge of his knuckles. Meadow wind flows in channels of his skin. The poem ends: Old man, he points with the old root, the compass of his hand knows the waterholes, watercourses, the life flow on earth places of his mind.16 His mind holds intimate knowledge of the land; he has become a part of the land. A traditional Swampy Cree story from eastern Canada, "Tree Old Woman," sug- gests, too, that land forms become internalized: She stood close to a tree and wrinkled her face, TIGHT, and this was her tree-bark face. It felt like bark, too, when you ran fingers over it.17 This woman's face is transformed to resemble creatures around her. One moment she changes to tree, then to frog, then to old man. Her adaptability suggests she possesses magical power. The identities of the tree and the woman nearly merge. Even the character of her skin tells a story about her life experiences and her relation- ships to others. Chickasaw poet Linda Hogan contemplates the cycle of seasons and of growing things in her poem "Woman Gardening." One passage reads: So gentle as if she were wearing a glove. Her hands reaching into the womb of earth to define a land by what it shapes. 18 The woman assists the earth in its impetus to take shape and support new life. Planting has usually been women's work, because women are accustomed to participating in the larger processes of life through giving birth and nur- turing children. According to an old story, Yellow Corn Girl of the Zuni said to the priests and the people: My flesh is your flesh. When you put my flesh in the ground it sprouts and does not die. It is like your bodies. When they are buried in the ground they do not die, our flesh is like your flesh.19 The theme of death and rebirth is articulated in a con- stellation of land/flesh images. Flesh nourishes flesh. The land/flesh connection is widespread in contem- porary Indian women's poetry, including writing by Roberta Hill, Anna Walters, and Ramona Wilson. Some poets such as Joy Harjo and Paula Gunn Allen expand this connection to include extensive sky/flesh imagery that revolves around the moon. These poets identify with the moon because it appears womanly in its phases and cycles, tactile in its radiance. Inquiry into the mysterious nature of the moon is an inquiry into self. Judith Ivaloo Volborth (Apache/Comanche) unites earth and sky in a quiet yet powerful poem called "In the Lodge." We gather to smoke prayers to pollinate the sky with human breath. Clouds blossom, fluid seedlings fall, our heart's eye grows fertile.20 The horizon where earth touches sky is a place of potency and sexual creativity. Here in this poem, earth energies of sensuality and fertility are drawn up into the sky through smoke and prayer, transforming space and bringing rain. A mystical sexuality pervades the sky. Volborth says that prayer resacralizes the cosmos and suggests that Indian women poets regenerate the earth's fertility through language and the work of their bodies. Seeing the world in terms of land/flesh images pro- vides a centering vision of relationship which helps human communities survive modern experiences of alienation. Native Americans see flesh as a sacred gift. In these images of land and flesh, the people are affirming and celebrating the essential mysteriousness of life as manifested through infinite transformations of relation- ships on earth. NOTES 1.
