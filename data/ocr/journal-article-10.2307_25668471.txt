Turpin ABSTRACT Red Linear rock art is one of three prehistoric styles defined in the Lower Pecos River Region of southwest Texas. This miniature, monochrome style, characterized by diminutive stick figures engaged in coherent group activities, has been identified at eight sites. Intangible aspects of culture reflected in the pictographs include ranking in social status, ritual and economic practices, warfare and hunting strategies, sex-specific division of society, sympathetic magic, and a selective perception of the environment. A description of the salient attributes, an estimate of Late Archaic age, and an interpretation of its possible function as ritual art are presented as a framework for future reference. The hypothesis that this style is intrusive is based on its divergence from classic Pecos River style art, the dominant regional form. The vulnerability of this miniature form to total destruction presents an impelling need for the recording of additional examples. INTRODUCTION The Red Linear style is one of three de fined prehistoric pictograph styles in the Lower Pecos River Region of southwest Texas. This area, surrounding the confluence of the Pecos and Devils rivers with the Rio Grande (Fig. 1), has long been famous for the monumental, polychrome Pecos River style parietal art (Jackson 1938; Kirkland 1937a, 1937b, 1938, 1939; Graham and Davis 1958; Gebhard 1960, 1965; Grieder 1965, 1966a, 1966b; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967), pre served within the numerous rock shelters of this near-desert region. The sheer quantity and size of this predominant style has often obscured the two minor prehistoric types ? the Red Monochrome, a late intrusive art, and the miniature Red Linear. The purpose of this paper is to present a description of the Red Linear style, to set forth the problems in in terpretation, to assess the art in terms of the presently known culture history of the region, and, above all, to draw the attention of pro fessional researchers and the interested public to a rapidly disappearing art form. Interpretation of prehistoric art at any level remains inference and is as likely to be a pro 181</page><page sequence="2">v. \ I *\^Val Verde County 1 S~*J -^"""^^ V &lt;T .

Red Linear is, however, a representative art style which often clearly reproduces the distinguishing characteristics of animals, weapons, and human figures. The sugges tions presented herein, while admittedly often speculative, are congruent with the model of Lower Pecos prehistory developed from more tangible archaeological remains. They are, however, also intended to stimulate interest and encourage additional research. The miniature monochrome Red Linear style is characterized by diminutive stick figures engaged in animated group activities (Fig. 2). Consistent motifs are sex differen tiation, phallacism, hand-held implements, companion animals, feather headdresses, dancing or marching groups, and the use of S-shaped human figures to convey the im pression of motion. Red Linear artists ex ploited natural rock formations and older paintings as a backdrop for their scenes and, by the sophisticated use of variations in size, emphasized mobility and directed the orien tation of their group activities. Flu idly abstract, yet visually cohesive, these small red figures stand in marked contrast to the static, some times somber, Pecos River style shamanic art for which this arid region is noted. Only eight sites containing Red Linear pic tographs have been recorded. Until recently, the distribution clustered around the mouth of the Pecos River and along the Rio Grande (Fig. 1), but this impression of a limited areal extent was apparently a function of the inten sity of survey in the region. All the previously located sites fall within the area subjected to concentrated study prior to the construction of Lake Amistad (Graham and Davis 1958; Gebhard 1960,1965; Parsons 1962; Grieder 1965, 1966a, 1966b; Dibble and Prewitt 1967). The recording of 41VV612, high on the Devils River, following information supplied by Lower Pecos residents in 1983, expanded the known range of the Red Linear style by over 35 km. The rarity of site recordings may also be attributed to the seeming preference of the Red Linear artists for secluding their drawings in small, obscure alcoves or high on the lateral ends of major rock art panels. THE SITES The first Red Linear site recorded, 41VV201, was copied in the 1930s by the noted portrayer of Texas rock art, Forrest Kirkland, but his artwork was not published until 1967 (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967: Plate 53), perhaps due to the delicacy of the subject matter for that time. The style was named by Gebhard (1960:53) who found ex amples in two other sites, 41W74 and 41VV78, during his analysis of rock art sites in the vicinity of Seminole Canyon (Gebhard 1965). Both are relatively close to the type site. Subsequent additions to the inventory of this style resulted from later intensive studies of Lower Pecos rock art (Grieder 1966; Par sons n.d.a; Turpin 1982) and individual re cording. Despite the increase in the known frequency of sites with this type of rock art, 41VV201, the Red Linear site, remains the epitome of the style. The two panels at the type site (Fig. 2) are high on a sheer canyon wall, sheltered only by a slight overhang and accessible only by climbing the steeply slanting wall to a narrow ledge of accumulated loose rocks. The highest segments are beyond reach and must have been painted from a support, perhaps boulders along the ledge (Gebhard 1965: 105). No occupational debris marks the site, 182</page><page sequence="3">No, I ?3 . . . ** * Hn.SL Fig. 2. 41VV201, the Red Linear site, as copied in water colors by Forrest Kirkland (reproduced courtesy of the Texas Memorial Museum). 183</page><page sequence="4">and the nearest inhabited shelter lies some 600 m upstream. The canyon is not easily entered at this point, and much of the narrow bottom is choked by limestone rubble and dense vegetation. The largest mural (Fig. 2.1) is the most complex, containing three groups ranging in size from 11 to 17 individuals. Males are shown with erect phalli. Females can be distinguished by a loop drawn in the pelvic area, as shown by the two flanking figures in the crouching trio of the group at lower right. The impression of orgiastic frenzy conveyed by this group prompted the interpretation of these pictographs as portrayals of ritual or sacred fertility acts (Gebhard 1960:65,1965: 33; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:94). New comb further suggests that, for the im aginative, the vertical line of male figures on the left may represent stages in the life cycle from childhood to adulthood; the surrounding figures are then the elders, shamans, and mythical beings who ushered these men through the critical stages (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:93-94). An alternative for the more prosaic is commemoration of a battle wherein the victors, on the left, hold orderly positions and the opponents, on the right, are in disorder or retreat. The apparent absurdity of tumbling dogs (Fig. 2.1) can then be seen more rationally as a symbol of chaos rather than as sheer whimsy. For licentious behavior to follow a successful combat is not limited to the ethnographic past but rather seems to be an enduring facet of the human condition (Brownmiller 1975). Given this interpretation, the linking of sexuality and aggression diminishes the role of fertility to secondary status, that of consequence rather than focus of an activity. Fertility, however, emerges as a central concept in other sites in the Red Linear inventory of themes. Whatever the pictographic intent of this artwork, the con sensus is that the Red Linear site is a por trayal of ritualized aggressive, sexual, and generative principles (Gebhard 1960:65, 1965:33; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:94). Minor themes and motifs illustrated at this site which characterize the style as a whole are stick figures engaged in energetic group activity; the use of size variation to illustrate processional or linear arrangements; sex dif ferentiation through the display of genital symbols; S-shaped posture as a method of conveying motion; headdresses; hand-held implements; accompanying animals, in this case dogs; striped or cross-hatched figures; and looped geometries. Two immense shelters, noted for outstand ing examples of the two major monumental prehistoric rock art styles of the Lower Pecos, also hold panels in the Red Linear style at the upstream end of their rear walls. Flooded Shelter (41VV78) is famous as the best pre served and largest extant mural in the Red Monochrome style, chronologically the latest prehistoric style defined in the region (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:86-89). Although both Red Linear and Red Monochrome art are, as the names imply, usually painted with reddish-hued hematite, the differences in size and content are vast. Red Monochrome panels are characterized by the depiction of life-size and lifelike full bodied humans armed with bows and arrows and accompanied by naturalistic animals of many species. Frontally posed figures are ar ranged in horizontal bands, with upstretched arms and outspread legs, an occasional display of male genitals, and a seeming preoccupation with fingers and feet. The Red Monochrome panel at 41VV78 stretches across the downstream half of the rear wall. At the upper end of the shelter, small groups of Red Linear figures lie amidst faded and deteriorated remnants of figures in the other major local style, the Pecos River style. Almost obliterated by natural rock decay, the Red Linear panels now consist largely of isolated elements. In one group, six pairs of dancers, or wrestlers, cavort in unison (Fig. 3). The distended bellies of the central pair perhaps indicate pregnancy. One line of seven ithyphallic figures, too dim to illustrate, strides along a crack in the wall, using this break as a road. Such use of natural features, or of previously painted rock art, as a back drop for the Red Linear marches is character istic. As deteriorated as the Red Linear figures are at 41VV78, enough remain to detect the stylistic and thematic conventions of processional and energetic group activity; phallacism and fertility; the use of perspec tive and natural features to accentuate the sense of procession; hand-held implements; and companion animals. Unfortunately, these now dispersed elements can no longer be in tegrated into a coherent pictograph in the true 184</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 3. 41VV78, Flooded Shelter, a group of six pairs of dancers. Note distended bellies of central pair. sense of the word. Fate Bell Shelter, 41VV74, is one of the largest occupied rock shelters in the South west and is notable for the depth of its deposits, the vandalism of those deposits, and the profusion of the Pecos River Style pic tographs. So high on the upstream end of the shelter that they must have been painted from ladders or scaffolding, a parade of Red Linear figures winds its way across a natural fault line into an older Pecos River style composi tion of horseshoe- and dagger-shaped elements (Fig. 4). All the pertinent attributes of Red Linear art are expressed in this panel, but more figures are discernably female. Two scenes portray pregnant women with out stretched arms (Fig. 5a, b). The latter contains a rare element in Red Linear art, two flower ing plant stalks. In a third vignette, a woman is apparently being threatened by two armed men while a third advances with upheld weapons (Fig. 4). Now almost obliterated by natural rock decay, four pairs of figures are composed of one long-haired person, pos sibly female, pursuing with outstretched arms a running lead figure. A commonality with the Red Linear site, 41VV201, is demonstrated by one S-shaped figure, similar to those of the orgiastic group (Fig. 2.1). Miniature animals are interspersed among the some 50 human or anthropomorphic individuals still visible today. Some figures have been lost in recent years, most lamentably, two which Gebhard (1965:Plate 29) drew with bows in hand. Despite this documented loss and more which assuredly has taken place since the pictographs were drawn, the major themes of Red Linear art?sexuality, fertility, ritual, and aggression?are all displayed in miniature. Two other Red Linear sites share with 41VV201 the quality of isolation that suggests secret, ritual, or socially selective portrayals. Both are in small, rimrock alcoves which lie laterally within 50 m of large, densely oc cupied shelters. The rock art at these two sites is heavily smoke-blackened or stained by manganese dioxide and is thus barely discernible. Decipherable elements conform to the Red Linear repertoire of themes and motifs. At 41VV324, two ithyphallic males, in tandem, are part of a composition largely unintelligible due to manganese staining of the wall (Fig. 6). This pictograph is important because it is one where the hand-held object is roughly curved in a reversed bow shape. Given the schematized nature of this linear art, this implement could easily be interpreted as a fending or rabbit stick. 41VV162A is a small cleft in the rock which yielded the skeletal remains of now-extinct Late Pleistocene fauna and radiocarbon dates ranging from 12,000 to 14,000 years ago (Valastro, Davis, and Varela 1977:309, 1979:257). The smoke of many fires has blackened the walls, in some places almost completely obscuring badly deteriorated Pecos River style pictographs and super 185</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 4. 41VV74, Fate Bell Shelter, led by a headdressed male, this group of four heads a procession which wends its way across the natural curve of the shelter wall ending on an earlier Pecos River style "dagger." This photograph was taken with special film, developed for high contrast, which emphasizes the clarity of the pictograph. imposed Red Linear scenes (Grieder 1966b). Most apparent are a herd of 17 animals, perhaps bison, in full flight above the entrance (Fig. 7), and a graded procession of 10 to 14 diminutive individuals, their leaders bearing a circular object of unknown function (Grieder 1966b:Fig. 3). Other discernible single figures are ithyphallic males with round heads sprouting what may be a feather, taller striped figures (Fig. 8) which strongly resemble some Pecos River style shamans (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:Plate 25), and a running dog. 41VV162A is unusual among the recorded Red Linear sites in the convention of circular heads, striped shamans, and herd animals but conforms to the style with the graded pro cessions, phallacism, and vivacity of the miniature humans and their accompanying animals. The secluded location of these two panels and the reiteration of sex distinction, proces sional arrangements of stick figures, posture of those figures, and other minor attributes places them well within the Red Linear style. One seemingly idiosyncratic touch, the head drawn as a circle atop the linear torso at 41VV162A, can also be seen at the Red Linear site (Fig. 2.2). Mystic Shelter, 41VV612, is an elaborate mixture of polychrome Pecos River and monochrome Red Linear styles lying beneath a moderate overhang near the mouth of a small tributary of the Devils River. Low in the canyon wall, the shelter has been scoured and washed until no habitational debris sur vives, if in fact it was ever deposited. This susceptability to flooding suggests that the site would not have offered optimal living con ditions, especially given the numerous other opportunities offered nearby by higher, dryer shelters. That severe washouts took place in prehistory can be seen in the aboriginal pic tographs that underlie a ledge which was once the shelter floor but now bisects the lower wall. The majority of the extant pic tographs were apparently executed from this ledge although the large Pecos River style panthers and shamans extend far above 186</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 5. 41VV74, Fate Bell Shelter, (a) Pregnant women with exaggerated breasts facing a zoomorphic creature, (b) Four dancers face the audience in front of a preg nant woman. reach, suggesting the use of an artificial sup port. Interspersed among the monumental figures of this predominant art form, on the downstream half of the shelter wall, are over 100 miniature red figures. The recording of this site in 1983 expanded both the known distribution of the Red Linear style and em phasized the role of hunting, previously seen at41VV162A (Fig. 7) and the Red Linear site (Fig. 2.2), as a concern reflected in this art form. At least three of the vignettes center around trapping or hunting of game animals. One scene, too large and heavily marred by calcite staining to illustrate, may depict a drive or roundup of deer. Several animals, running in different directions, swirl around the hunters who are armed with spears or clubs. One deer with spreading antlers is being chased into what appears to be a weighted rope net. This design may well represent a blind; such a function is ascribed to a rock wall erected across a game trail in Seminole Canyon (Turpin 1982:120). In a second picto / / 41VV324 Fig. 6. 41VV324, two males in tandem, the foremost carrying a reversed curved implement, are part of a larger composition obliterated by manganese staining. Note the similarity between the object held in the lead figure's left hand and that shown in Figure 10. graph, a large humped animal strongly resembling a bison is also being pursued, driven toward a geometric design in its path (Fig. 9). As netting bison is a somewhat inef fective mode of hunting, the geometric could, in this case, be a corral, barrier, or cliff face, or could be simply symbolic of capturing the animal. If these two geometric symbols do, in fact, represent some form of trap, this ex planation may extend to include the looped lines found at 41VV201 (Fig. 2.2), 41VV74, and here. A third hunting strategy may be shown by a hunter, holding a clublike imple ment, facing an onrushing pair of deer (Fig. 10a). This hand-held object is also shown at 41VV324 (frg. 6), but at that site no prey is apparent, and the handle of the tool is more sinuous. Stone or wood-headed clubs, or maces, have been recovered in archaeo logical deposits in this region (Martin 1933) and are ethnographically known in adjacent areas (Berlandier 1969). These weapons are, however, usually called war clubs. In the last scene, the artist has success fully integrated the Pecos River and Red Linear styles, presenting a difficult problem in detecting superimposition (Fig. 10). A large horned deer, finger-painted in deep red, is faced by the miniature hunter (Fig. 10a). Two tiny deer (Fig. 10b) spring from the breast of 187</page><page sequence="8">?

The distance from animals to spall has been reduced to permit a single illustration. the larger animal towards the human figure. A spear thrust into the body of the central Pecos River style deer crosses the main body of a small, pale red deer (Fig. 10c). If not viewed in the context of the entire group, this one deer would seem to prove that the Pecos River figure is later. The small animal, however, is stylistically different than the two in the foreground, and the majority of the composition follows the Red Linear tradition of incorporating existing pictographs into a new creation (see also Fig. 4). Not all the scenes at 41VV612 are con cerned with the hunt. The typical processions of stick figures meander across the wall in three separate areas. Some variety is seen in one line of six figures which are facing the viewer (see also Fig. 2.5). In two others, from 5 to 19 males are depicted in profile. The vivacity of Red Linear art is captured in an ithyphallic man, sitting with legs akimbo, brandishing his weapons at a partner whose gender is not detectable (Fig. 11). No female figures can be securely identified in any of the scenes at 41VV612. This unusual scene bears, for the imaginative, a strong resem blance to curing ritual if the seated figure is seen as the shaman, driving the harmful 41VV 162A Fig. 8.

In this case, the erect phallus would symbolize the entranced state of the practicing healer (Lommel 1967:99).

The spear protruding from the larger animal crosses the body of a miniature deer (c), giving the impression of superimposition. The vignette as a whole, however, suggests adroit utilization of a preexisting figure as the central character. underlying social tradition. In addition to the generalized themes, specific attributes exactly mirror those drawn at the previously recorded sites. The spreading deer antlers are to be seen at 41VV201 (Fig. 2.3), the looped lines at 41VV74 and 41VV201, the frontally posed group at 41VV201, and the hand-held club at 41VV324. Such attention to minor detail indicates that all these depictions represent items or ideas shared over the divide between the Devils and Pecos rivers. The seventh site, Hidden Shelter, 189</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 11. This small ithyphallic man at 41VV612 sits with legs akimbo, brandishing his weapons at a related figure. 41W408, can only be thematically classed as Red Linear; the stylistic vivacity that makes this miniature art form so visually attractive is sadly lacking. The badly deteriorated pic tographs consist of a parade of red stick men, extending across the natural curve of a fault in the rear wall, who are accompanied by animals, in this case apparently deer. The use of perspective suggests that the smaller lead figures are vanishing into a recess in the wall, perhaps symbolizing a mythological return to the earth. Qualities shared with classic Red Linear art are the parade of monochromatic, ithyphallic figures with outstretched arms, shown in profile, and accompanied by animals; the use of natural features and size gradation to emphasize the processional nature of the arrangement; and striped or cross-hatched zoomorphic or geometric at tendants. Lacking are the vivacity and energy conveyed by fine line drawings. The largest humans are 17 cm tall, over twice the size of the normal Red Linear renditions. The absence of some motifs can be attributed to heavy mineral accretion and spalling which have severely damaged the mural, but no natural process can be blamed for the crud ity of execution. Nevertheless, the rock art of Hidden Shelter conforms more closely to the thematics of Red Linear than to any of the other defined styles of the region. The secluded location of this site is also in accord with the Red Linear tradition. Hidden behind a giant rock fall high in the wall of a minor tributary, this shelter had lain con cealed from archaeologists who concentrated their study in the adjacent major drainway, Seminole Canyon, prior to the construction of Amistad Dam (Graham and Davis 1958; Geb hard 1965; Parsons 1962). Recorded in 1981 as part of an intensive study of rock art in the newly formed Seminole Canyon State Histor ical Park, this site was one of the rarest of Lower Pecos sites, an unvandalized rock shelter with deep midden deposits and picto graphs. This proved to be a fleeting oppor 190</page><page sequence="11">tunity to relate one form of rock art to occupa tional debris; within a few months after re cording, relic hunters dug in the most promising areas of the deposits. In an attempt to salvage information without further excava tion, charcoal from fire pits outlined in the potholes was submitted to the University of Texas Radiocarbon Laboratory for assay. The surface artifacts suggested an occupation ter minating in the Middle Archaic period, be tween 2800 and 4100 years ago (Turpin 1982: 101). Two samples of charcoal from the up per 20 cm of the deposits placed the aban donment of the shelter at 4000 B.P., the mid dle of the Middle Archaic in the Lower Pecos River region. TX4811 yielded an uncorrected date of 4030 ? 80 B.P.; TX4812 was slightly older at 4200 ? 70 B.P. Thus, if the assump tion that the pictographs are contem poraneous with the occupation of the site can be made, this mural is older than 4000 years. At present, this is the only rock art in the Lower Pecos which can be tentatively cor related with radiocarbon dates with any degree of confidence. Even that is open to criticism because of the possibility of later in truders painting the walls but leaving no other obvious material trace. All stylistic and con textual evidence supports a much later date for the classic Red Linear pictographs at the other recorded sites. The eighth recorded site, now lost, may have held the key to dating this style. Miniature deer with spreading antlers were the only figures discernible at 41VV282 when it was recorded (Dibble and Prewitt 1967: 18-19), but these animals were drawn in char coal. This site was documented (Grieder 1966a) before it sank beneath the waters of Lake Amistad, but the site was not then classified as linear. A review of the records suggests that the panel was, in fact, a black variation of the Red Linear style. As the technical capability to assay minute charcoal samples had not yet been developed, no samples were taken. Although this site is now inundated and undoubtedly dissolved, similar use of charcoal pigment may one day provide an absolute date for this or other pictograph styles. Until then, stylistic criteria offer the best means of narrowing the possible time frame. THE AGE OF THE RED LINEAR STYLE The age of the Red Linear style is still open to question. Absolute dates obtained from cultural material in the sites with Red Linear art range from terminal Pleistocene at 41VV162A (Valastro, Davis, and Varela 1977: 309,1979:257) through the whole range of the Archaic stage at adjabent 41VV162. Time diagnostic projectile point styles found in 41VV74 and 41VV162 extend the possible time frame through the Late Prehistoric until the time of European contact. The two dates from charcoal in the upper levels of 41VV408 indicate abandonment of the site 4000 years ago, but unfortunately the rock art is not clearly the fully developed Red Linear style. If the assumption that the occupants of this site were also the painters of the pictographs is made, the only proposition which can be securely set forth is that aspects of the theme and some stylistic attributes were part of the Lower Pecos iconographic repertoire by the Middle Archaic period, 2000 B.C. Attempts to place the Red Linear in a chronological perspective using stylistic at tributes has produced contradictory lines of evidence. Newcomb (1976:181; Kirklandand Newcomb 1967:94-95) saw parallels with the Archaic age Pecos River style in such details as the treatment of the miniature deer (Fig. 2.3) and the depiction of the atlatl rather than the later bow and arrow. The interpretation of some hand-held curved implements as bows (Gebhard 1965:33), which would imply a Late Prehistoric date, post-A.D. 600, can no longer be verified as those specific figures are now destroyed. This identification may have been incorrect as over 200 individual figures have since been examined and no bows are represented among their numerous hand held objects. The closest approximation is the recurved object held by one figure at 41VV324 (Fig. 6). Gebhard (1965:34) also drew comparisons with the Kokopelli, the hump-backed flute player of the late prehistoric and historic greater Southwest. The relationship between Red Linear art of the Lower Pecos and the Kokopelli of the Great Southwest, dated in that area between A.D. 700 and 1600 (Well man 1970:1678; Grant 1967:60), finds sup port in a long list of shared traits (Gebhard 1965:122-123), but two of the most salient 191</page><page sequence="12">characteristics of Kokopelli, the hump-back and the flute-playing, are missing in Red Linear pictographs. What appear from a distance to be hump-backed figures walking upstream at 41VV74 prove on high contrast photographs to be pregnant women walking downstream (Fig. 5). The origin of Kokopelli is unknown, but some authors suggest diffusion from the south (Wellman 1970:1682; Grant 1967:61). To avoid perpetuating bibliographic drift, it should be clearly stated that while the Lower Pecos is south (and east) of the heartland of Kokopolli, no direct line of descent is pres ently demonstrable. It may be that the stylistic similarities between these two spatially and chronologically diverse expressions of a basic theme, fertility, spring from a common root, but so little is known of any art forms in areas adjacent to the Lower Pecos that no such hypothesis can be seriously proposed. This possible relationship has implications beyond that of simple correlation of art styles. If a common origin can be traced, implying the diffusion of a shared myth, supporting evi dence should be found in other classes of ar chaeological remains, and the mode of trans mittal should be sought. The few similarities between the Red Linear and Pecos River styles are over whelmed by the magnitude of the differences. The human figure in the polychrome Pecos River art is usually monumental in stature, static, fixed in attributes, and frontally posed, and interaction is limited to demonstrations of dominance. The monochrome Red Linear people are miniature, vivacious, gregarious, and most often shown in profile. The Pecos River style is mythology and magic made manifest in art; the Red Linear can be more aptly termed a true pictograph, a story told in pictorial form. One of the most striking differences is in the pictographic intent of variations in size within individual panels in each style. The Pecos River artist seems to have used the dimensions of the individual to reflect the magnitude of its power. Larger shamans are often surrounded by smaller figures, some times prone or inverted, illustrating the dominance of the central character. The Red Linear style leaders are usually only slightly larger than their companions, but this is also a result of their position at the head of a group (Figs. 2, 4). Gradations in size along the line of figures produce the impression of direction of march; this use of a form of perspective is a realistic way to enhance the sense of mobility and, in itself, justifies viewing Red Linear as a technically advanced art form. Despite the stylistic differences between the two styles, the consistent depiction of the atlatl places them both within the Archaic period. Given the extremely long duration of the Archaic period in the Lower Pecos (ap proximately 7500 years), the assignment of both the Pecos River and Red Linear styles to that period does not imply contempo raneity. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how two such stylistically diverse art forms could be created by the same small population of dispersed hunters and gatherers. The con trast between art mobilier, such as the painted pebbles so common in the Lower Pecos shelter deposits, and the parietal art can be attributed to the distinction between private and public symbolism (Thomas N. Campbell, personal communication 1983). The interesting hypothesis that pebbles and figurines are personal and female (Parsons n.d.b; Newcomb 1976:179) can be extended to the view of the pictographs as male and, although directed to a specific audience, more public. Narrowing of the possible time of the Red Linear style can be explored through three lines of reasoning. The fragility of these miniature pictographs has been amply demonstrated by the complete loss of several individuals known to have once existed at both 41VV74 and 41VV201. Although condi tion of pictographs is not solely a function of age, the rapidity with which the Red Linear art is disappearing mediates against great antiquity for the majority of the sites and favors the later phases of the Archaic period. The evolution of the fully developed Red Linear style from the crude expressions at 41W408 cannot be traced in the known sam ple; further recordings may locate this miss ing link and clarify the sequence. The skillful use of existing Pecos River style art as a backdrop for the Red Linear pic tographs (Figs. 4, 9) and the rare instances where the two styles overlap generally sug gest that the Red Linear is later. In the absence of a secure chronology for Pecos River style art, this sequence is only relative. 192</page><page sequence="13">One slight contextual clue fits well with the current model of Lower Pecos culture history. Grieder (1966b:718) suggests that a herd of miniature animals drawn over the entrance to 41VV162A may be "buffalo" rather than the deer more commonly known. This herd is rac ing towards a crack in the wall which may be fancifully interpreted as a canyon (Fig. 7). A large spall along the crack and directly in the path of the stampede has the same configura tion as Bonfire Shelter, the site of repeated bison jumps. The only mass bison kills documented in the Lower Pecos took place at Bonfire Shelter at two widely separate in tervals. Paleo-lndian stampedes of now extinct bison were followed over 7000 years later by drives of modern bison during the Late Archaic period, ca. 2600 years ago (Dib ble and Lorrain 1968). The temptation to relate this panel to the earliest bison stampede at Bonfire Shelter, dated to 10,000 years ago, is compounded by the Late Pleistocene fauna recovered at 41VV162A and the associated radiocarbon ages of 12,000 to 14,000 B.P. It is improbable, however, that these miniature pictographs, in such an exposed location, could have sur vived for 12 millenia. Thus, if this scene commemorates a successful bison kill, its most probable age is Late Archaic. A similar possibility is offered by one fragmentary animal at 41VV612 which has a distinctive hump and a stringy tail (Fig. 9), unlike any of the many deer depicted at this site. This figure, too, has suffered from spall ing which has eradicated its forequarters. If bison, the documented extension of their range into the Lower Pecos region during the Archaic period is between 2600 and 1400 years ago (Dillehay 1974). Their expansion into the region, followed by attendant hunters, marks the end of the Middle Archaic and the beginning of the Late Archaic period. The relatively short stay of the bison hunters in the Lower Pecos is marked by changes in ma terial culture, economic strategy, and social structure. Many of the Red Linear scenes are congruent with the ideology of such male centered hunting and gathering groups wherein a premium was placed on the hunt ing of large game animals (LaBarre 1972: 139). RED LINEAR ART, STYLE, AND THEME The similarities in treatment of minor motifs at 41VV74 and 41VV201, and the few discernible figures at 41VV78 and 41VV324, are so strong that the work of one artist could be implied. All four sites could be included in a circle less than 15 km in diameter, well within the probable range of pedestrian for aging groups. Thus, on the basis of these sites alone, Red Linear art could be defined as the product of one eccentric individual who saw the world through eyes different from those of his or her fellows. 41VV612 and 41VV162A, however, display considerable variation in many attributes while maintaining the major themes and motifs. These dif ferences between sites support the concept of style above that of individual effort. Art for art's sake or idle doodling can be eliminated as motives for the Red Linear pic tographs. The most elegant murals, 41VV74 and 41VV201, could only have been painted from constructed supports, such as ladders or scaffolds (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967: 92), requiring elaborate preparation, or boulders now displaced (Gebhard 1965:105). Such an expenditure of energy to create miniature scenes barely visible to the naked eye certainly underscores the importance of the act of painting above that of the product. The placement of these panels and the obscurity of others are purposeful acts, whether sacred or commemorative. None of the scenes are aimless; all hold coherent vignettes, and all treat what must have been most serious concerns ? subsistence, com bat, and reproduction. Ritual functions often ascribed to preliterate art include hunting magic, increase or fertility rites, and commemoration of events in the individual or collective history of the ar tist (Uckoand Rosenfeld 1971). In Red Linear art, animal and plant fertility are not prom inently displayed: the only obvious gravid figures are human. Vegetation is, in fact, notable for its rarity. Certainly, a selective perspective of the environment is also presented by the species of animals painted. The most frequent companion shown is the domesticated dog, an economic and social asset (Fig. 2). Deer and bison, prized food sources, predominate in the hunting scenes even though the Archaic diet was based 193</page><page sequence="14">largely on desert succulents, small mammals, fish, and reptiles. This symbolic capture of relatively rare large game animals could then be construed as "hunting magic" or as com memorative of some exceptional success (Ucko and Rosenfeld 1971). Differentiating between these two functions is predicated on knowing the sequence of painting versus the hunt. If the pictograph was drawn before the act of hunting, it could be considered as predictive or an attempt to influence the out come of a planned project. If it followed the kill, the art becomes commemorative or, less practically, an attempt to magically regenerate the slaughtered animals. Although such a decision is beyond archaeological definition, none of these possibilities can be fully discounted. Although some Red Linear vignettes seem concerned with human sexuality (Fig. 2) and reproduction (Fig. 5), the consistent depiction of male genitals may have implications other than fertility or increase in population. Even in the most erotic scene at 41VV201, sen suality is conveyed by the sinuosity of the reclining figures and the group composition as much as by the display of genitalia. Female sexual characteristics, beyond the possible emphasis on pregnancy, are not graphically detailed. The ithyphallic state is sometimes seen as characterizing the rigidity of shamanic trances (Lommel 1967:99; Furst 1977:13). Such erections shown in Paleolithic art have been described as "not appropriate for hunters, but plausible in shamanic dreams" (LaBarre 1972:411). Thus, in some panels, such as those centering around hunt ing, combat, or processional activity, the erect penis may be a method of placing the scene in a ritual context or, more simply, of dis playing adult manhood. The count of adult males pictured in each of the three scenes at Red Linear (Fig. 2.1) ranges from 11 to 15, and 10 to 14 form the procession at 41VV162A. These groups are the only ones still intact enough to determine the actual number of figures painted. If it can be assumed that they also accurately reflect the group size, the number of men conforms to the range of 8 to 13 ethnographically described for hunting or raiding parties (Newcomb 1961). These two locations and 41W324 are not long-term or large habitation sites but rather small and isolated, implying special localities used for ritual performances (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:94). If the panels in these sites were ritually painted, the heavy representation of men and the depic tion of traditionally masculine activities sug gest puberty rites, the passage from adoles cent to hunter and warrior, or initiation into select male societies. Approximately 50 individuals, male and female, can still be discerned at 41VV74, but these comprise several different groupings engaged in separate activities. This site and 41VV78 were heavily occupied over a long span of Lower Pecos prehistory, and they contain the only renditions of pregnant women yet identified in the Red Linear style. That the subject matter covaries with the oc cupational intensity of the site may reflect the selective participation of various segments of the population in the ritual act of painting. One aspect of the social structure of the Red Linear people may be reflected in the consistent impression of political rank con veyed by variations in size, position within the group, and elaborate headdress. These leaders project a sense of authoritarian direc tion toward a predestined location (Fig. 4). In an egalitarian society, such as that generally attributed to the hunter-gatherers of Texas, such leaders are often appointed or acknowl edged during periods of organizational stress to serve at the head of war parties or hunting expeditions (Newcomb 1961). Scenes of both are common in the Red Linear art. Hostility is expressed, however, by human figures riddled with projectiles in all the defined rock art styles of the Lower Pecos and is not ex clusively the province of the Red Linear artist. This approach to individual dominance is, in my opinion, one of the most telling dif ferences between the Pecos River and Red Linear styles. Power in the classic Pecos River panels is demonstrated by monumen tal, costumed, faceless shamans from whom waves of power emanate to magically engulf both human and animal subjects (Newcomb 1976:183-184). The Red Linear approach to enlisting the supernatural through ritual art seems more supplicatory, and while it may be as deadly serious as the Pecos River por trayal of dominance, it is more engaging than awesome. This basic philosophical diver gency suggests that two distinct ideological traditions are operative and that the psychic 194</page><page sequence="15">gap is too wide for origins in the same cultural system. One likely hypothesis is that the Red Linear artists entered the homeland of the Pecos River painters and were prompted by imitation to portray their concept of ritual in rock paintings. A miniature striped shaman at 41VV162A is almost a cartoon version of numerous large figures at Panther Cave, one of the most spectacular of Pecos River sites (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:Plate 25). Com plete with fending sticks, darts, pouch, tas seled sash, and striped red body, the Red Linear shaman (Fig. 8) faithfully mirrors all the formal attributes of the Panther Cave magicians but with an animation totally foreign to the Pecos River style. The effect is one of imitation but not duplication. If the Red Linear style is intrusive, its origins cannot be traced in the current sam ple of sites. The strongest stylistic affinity is with the Southwest. Within the framework of Lower Pecos culture history, the most prob able homeland of the Late Archaic bison hunters is central Texas or the Llano Estacado (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). So little is known of the area to the south, it remains an archaeological void, but interaction with groups in the arid lands of Northern Mexico is ethnographically documented at the time of contact (Griffen 1969). No art traditions have been defined in immediately adjacent areas; the nearest rock art site which bears any resemblance to Red Linear is Hueco Tanks, near El Paso, where the Kokopelli scenes are attributed to Mescalero Apache of historic times (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967: 200, PI. 127). CONCLUSIONS Basically a representative art form, the Red Linear style still offers insights into in tangible aspects of the artists' culture not often afforded by other classes of archaeo logical remains. It must be remembered, however, that these pictographs are, in their own way, as specialized as any artifact of past culture, granting only a limited view of the cultural whole. On the most abstract level, the recurrent themes expressed in scenes of ritual, repro duction, combat, and hunting seem most natural concerns in such an environment. Less expectably, rank and status are implied by leaders, signified by elaborate head dresses, larger size, and relative position within the group (Figs. 2, 4). This emphasis on leadership can be construed as a product of the social situations portrayed where such prominence was essential to the success of the task at hand or as commemorative of some heroic exploit. Recent studies of hunter forager complexity have tended to dispel the concept of a truly egalitarian society, es pecially in groups where concerted action is needed to harvest seasonal resources or in battle (Gould 1983). Many of the activities por trayed in Red Linear scenes would require coordination or leadership at this level. Organization on a broader scale can be in ferred from the group participation in ritual or economic activities, such as bison and deer drives (Figs. 7, 9). Warfare and hunting strategies, and the weapons employed, are shown (Figs. 2, 4, 6, 7, 9-11), and a division of labor is suggested by the absence of female figures in these scenes. Similarly, sex specific ritual can be detected in the distribu tion of the various topics emphasized at dif ferent sites. On a less pragmatic level, the symbolic capture of animals suggests that sympathetic magic played a role in the sub sistence economics (Fig. 9), and magic per haps functioned in curing (Fig. 11) and repro duction (Fig. 5). In my opinion, Red Linear art, as a whole, reflects a most practical attitude toward the uncertainties of group survival. A summation of the various lines of evi dence, both factual and circumstantial, can be stated in hypothesis form: the depiction of bison places the Red Linear style in the Late Archaic period, coincident with the entry of foreign groups into the Lower Pecos River Region during the bison presence period, ca. 1400 to 2600 years ago. The divergence from Pecos River style tradition in both form and content supports the intrusion of a fully evolved ritual art, perhaps developed in another medium. If ritual art, it may have served two audiences. The pictographs in the large habitation sites, with their greater representation of women and emphasis on apparently organized social activities, are more public. In more secluded localities, the topics are hunting, warfare, and conquest ? activities oriented toward select male segments of the population, perhaps in con junction with rites of passage. 195</page><page sequence="16">It is immediately apparent that certain con tradictions cannot be resolved using this model. If the Middle Archaic abandonment of 41VV408 implies a similar date for the rudimentary pictographs, the thematic and stylistic conventions of Red Linear were a part of the Lower Pecos artistic inventory long before the intrusion of the Late Archaic. The interpretation of some hand-held implements as bows may well be an error but, if this iden tification is correct, their presence would imply a Late Prehistoric, post-A.D. 600 age for the art of 41VV74 and sequential use of this specific panel over a long period of time. Obviously, until new analytical techniques are employed or the sample available for study is enlarged, these ambiguities and contradic tions will remain unresolved. One fact is indisputable. The Red Linear art is rapidly disappearing under the pressures of natural rock decay and modern climate. Comparisons between the photo graphic and artistic records made in previous rock art studies (Kirkland 1937, 1938, 1939; Gebhard 1960, 1965; Grieder 1965, 1966; Parsons n.d.a) and those made more recently illustrate the loss of much pertinent detail over the intervening decades. The vulnerability of the miniature figures is most dramatically demonstrated by the detachment of a large spall from the orgiastic group at 41VV201 in January, 1982 (Turpin 1982:Fig. 18). Prompted by a period of high humidity fol lowed by a hard freeze, this spall carried with it two of the S-shaped figures and forever altered the interpretive potential of the site itself. Soon all that will remain of the style is the documentation of past years and that done in the near future. The recent recording of several elaborate rock art sites, including 41W612, outside the intensively studied Amistad Reservoir district proves that unrecorded pictographs of major importance await discovery. It is imperative that a search for such sites be initiated soon so that more Red Linear art can be found. Hopefully, viewing it in the context of the prob lems presented herein will result in the resolu tion of some of these questions. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Three of my field companions share much of the credit for the completion of this manuscript. Lee Bement pointed out the uncanny resemblance between the set ting of the bison herd at 41VV162A and Bonfire Shelter; Herb Eling photographed the pictographs and prepared the plates; Dave Robinson drew the illustrations in the field and the lab. Many of the ideas were elaborated through fruitful discussions with participants in the Rock Art Symposium at the XII Congress of Anthropologists and Ethnologists, especially Dr. Lucas Smits of the University of Lesotho and Dr. Jarl Nordbladh of the University of Goteborg. I owe to David O. Brown the sug gestion that curing ritual may be the subject of the small scenario at 41VV612. Helpful comments were offered by Drs. W. W. Newcomb, T. N. Campbell, DeeAnn Story, and David S. Dibble of the University of Texas at Austin. Bill Newcomb was also of great assistance in obtaining support from the University Research Institute for the radiocarbon assays reported herein. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department gave permission to publish photographs taken at 41VV74 during the TAS survey of Seminole Canyon State Historical Park and, in conjuc tion with the Texas Antiquities Committee, allowed us to take charcoal from 41VV408 for assay. Finally, much of the detailed study of Red Linear sites was only possi ble through the good offices of numerous residents of the Lower Pecos, specifically Don Duncan, Miguel Benavides, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Teaff, Mr. and Mrs. Bud White, Mr. and Mrs. Bud White, Jr., and Mr. and Mrs. Walter King.
