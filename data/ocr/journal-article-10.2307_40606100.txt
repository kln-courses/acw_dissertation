<plain_text><page sequence="1">Janus and the siren's call: kava and the articulation of gender and modernity in Vanuatu John P. Taylor University of Manchester In the South Pacific Islands of Vanuatu, it is often said that 'Women can't drink kava because kava is a woman, and a woman can't take back a woman'. Such prescriptive reasoning relates to deeply rooted cosmological understandings of fertility, sacred power, and the nature of sexed bodies. They also evoke the fraught situation regarding gender relations and kava-drinking practice that has emerged through Vanuatu's transition from colonial outpost to independent nation-state. This article takes an ethno-historical approach to address critically the complex sense of rupture that infuses everyday kava-related talk and activity in Vanuatu. In so doing it reveals important insights into the dynamic relationship between 'kastom and its others' in both ni-Vanuatu and academic discourse, across gendered identities, and in embodied practice. In the Pacific Island nation-state of Vanuatu, kava has emerged as an important sub- stance in articulating the dynamic relationship between gender and modernity. Through the diversity of contexts in which kava circulates and is consumed, it has become saturated with meanings that evoke complex narratives of nostalgia, anxiety, and hope (regarding Fiji, cf. Tomlinson 2004; 2007). For those communities for whom its use as a soporific narcotic stretches back to the pre-European past of taem bifo ('time before'), kava and its related practices are intimately connected to social and cosmo- logical configurations that inculcate ideal relations of gender, generation, rank, and ancestry. These are the prelapsarian roots (stamba) of kava as kastom, such as are manifested most potently in the masculine romance of the nakamal Omen's house').1 This ideal arises in relation to an 'other' image of kava, one that is often considered more negatively: kava put through the meat grinder, for commercial consumption in kava bars. Here kava speaks of social relations in turmoil and of uncertain futures. This article addresses those narratives of temporal rupture that infuse both ni-Vanuatu (loosely, indigenous) and academic discourse about kava and its consumption, espe- cially in terms of their significance to changing gender relations and understandings of embodiment. Kava (mologUy in Raga, the language of North Pentecost) is a species of pepper (piper methysticum).

Taylor Ocean societies as a psychoactive drug, by drinking in cold-water infusions (Lebot, Merlin &amp; Lindstrom 1992: 1). Active 'kavalactones' (unrelated to either morphine or alcohol) cause mild narcotic, hypnotic, diuretic, and muscle-relaxant effects (McDonald &amp; Jowitt 2000: 218). My main ethnographic foci are rural North Pentecost Island and urban Luganville, Vanuatu's 'second town' (after the capital, Port Vila), on Espíritu Santo. Vanuatu, which gained independence from both Britain and France in 1980, is an archipelago of extreme cultural and linguistic variation, with 113 indigenous languages spoken across eighty-three inhabited islands and 200,000 people. The Raga- speakers of North Pentecost (here referred to as Sia Raga), which is located in the northeast of the archipelago, number about 7,000, and also make up about 10 per cent of Luganville's population (estimated from Vanuatu S.O.o.t.R.o. 2001). North Pentecost villages are typically virilocal, and subsistence is mainly based on the gardening of taro, yam, and tapioca and the farming of pigs, chickens, and cattle. Supplementary cash incomes, primarily used to pay for household essentials and school fees, are largely generated from cash-cropping coconuts for copra, and, in recent years especially, kava (see Taylor 2003a: 254-5). For most Sia Raga men - in town, island village, or for those living or working elsewhere in the archipelago - kava-drinking is a regular activity which provides a relaxing and fraternal end to the day. Its use is also intimately linked to performances of status, such as those that are institutionalized in the so-called 'graded society', and more recently in the hierarchies of church and state. By contrast, whereas women's use of kava in the past was strictly regulated throughout both pre-colonial and colonial history, as in the majority of Pacific societies in which it is consumed (Lebot et al 1992: 136-8), in contemporary Vanuatu these restrictions are rapidly changing. Given the continued invidious positioning of women with regard to contemporary modernity across Melanesia - as embodiments of either good Christian and/or kastom values or as dangerously progressive (Jolly 1997; Macintyre 2000) - in contrast to hegemonic mas- culinities in the region (Taylor 2008b), the fact that proscriptions surrounding kava use are undergoing such profound transformations means that it provides a powerful context through which to explore the rather fraught situation of gender relations therein. Further, the fluid content of kava allows us to extend these insights beyond the level of discourse by suggesting some of the ways in which understandings pertaining to kastom and its Others might also be seen as significant to embodied practice. Epistemologies of rupture Since the 1990s, conceptualizations of multiple or plural modernities have emerged as a challenge to the 'shared conceits' of modernization and dependency theories (Foster 2002: 57; see especially Appadurai 1996; Comaroff &amp; Comaroff 1993; Eisenstadt 2000; Knauft 2002; Leach &amp; Englund 2000; Miller 1995; Rofel 1999; Wagner 2000; and for a discussion see Kahn 2001) and check-list theories of modernity, especially by highlight- ing novel configurations and strategies that have emerged through the historical inter- action of indigenous and exogenous forms. Thus myriad experiences of modernity might be seen to operate and interact across such diffuse yet coeval Unes as locality, ethnicity, class, gender, or generation. However, rather than solving previous problems - such as an unwitting ascription of a 'denial of temporal coevalness' (Fabian 1983: 31-3) to modern 'others' based materially on unequal access to monetary wealth and tech- nological advancement, or existentially on a heightened sense of self-consciousness or alienation - by comfortably reproducing the liberal visions of multiculturalism and Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 16, 279-296 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2010</page><page sequence="3">JANUS AND THE SIREN'S CALL 281 relativism, they are often merely dressed up in new clothes. 'Easy pluralism' (Foster 2002: 57-8) may in fact tacitly support those positions that it purports to attack, by itself relying on an archetypal model of modernity that is assumed to originate and emanate from the West - a generic form against which all other versions become weighed as lesser approximations. Thus, arguments for multiple modernities or a singular Moder- nity not only add new spin to anthropology's age-old concern over the relationship between the particular and the universal, but also ironically rehearse one of contem- porary Western modernity's most compelling master narratives: globalization. Whether calls for the theoretical acknowledgement of local and culturally relativized modern diversities are able to hold out against the awesome homogenizing powers of big-picture theories of Modernity remains to be seen. Like Foster, I would suggest that one partial solution to these dilemmas lies in the methodological linking of theoretical approaches to ethnographic problems; to 'rub theoretical accounts of modernity against the lived experience of ordinary people', as he puts it (Foster 2002: 59). Therefore, as Miller first demonstrated in his now classic ethnography of modernity in Trinidad (i994)&gt; the primary concern of an anthropology of modernity is not to resolve its apparent contradictions, 'but to observe how peoples sometimes resolve or more commonly live out these contradictions in local practice' (1995: 18). Here I follow Miller (and Foster) by examining 'the apparent contradiction between talking about customs and enacting them in one's everyday life' (Keesing 1992: 123). I suggest that, in Vanuatu at least, such apparent contradictions across discourse and practice relate primarily to the sense of temporal rupture, or to that sense of a radical break between past and present that is so crucial to colonial subjectivities the world over. Just as the term 'modern' is definitively a temporal notion (Hirsch 2001: 144), so the definition of modernity as a distinctive consciousness of the discontinuity of time (Rabinow 1984: 39) may represent analyses of global modernity's/ies' only constantly overt feature. Here I highlight the need to apprehend how people compre- hend and enact sociality through such understandings of being in Time. This takes seriously Joel Kahn's call for a need to re-establish that conversation between 'non- Western' and 'Western' experiences and narratives of modernity that he suggests has been neglected in recent years, particularly as a result of pluralizing and relativizing strategies (Kahn 2001: 651). Like modernity and notions of the 'modern', the Bislama word kastom is both spatially and temporally loaded, seems to defy singular definition, and operates prima- rily by way of dialectical relationships with significant 'Others'. A broad analysis of what has become an extremely rich body of Vanuatu ethnography on the subject (see Bolton 1999; 2003; Jolly 1992; Jolly &amp; Thomas 1992; Lindstrom &amp; White 1994; Rousseau 2004) suggests that kastom engages the articulation of a dynamic alterity - an anxious push and pull that oscillates between reified oppositions and idealized creative syntheses. Kastom' s significant Others include the primary categories skul (church [70s], Chris- tianity, and/or Western-style institutionalized education), bisnis (business entrepre- neurship), and politik ('politics'). In contemporary discourse, such terms operate within or alongside more generalized understandings of things 'non-fcastom' (Lind- strom 1982b: 317) or 'not-fcastom' (Rousseau 2004: 40). Insofar as they are seen as the 'natural' attributes of blakman (black people, ni- Vanuatu) and waetman (whites, for- eigners), respectively, these distinctions are often heavily racialized. In ni-Vanuatu discourse, narrative use of kastom and its Others often reflects Western-style teleologies. This is because of the broad slippage that occurs when they Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 16, 279-296 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2010</page><page sequence="4">282 John P. Taylor are not treated as coextensive and coeval phenomena, but rather are unproblematically assigned to the conceptual spaces that lie on either side of an imagined temporal foment' of rupture that is associated with European arrival to the archipelago. Thus, in Bislama, bifo (before, typically understood to mean before the arrival of whites/ foreigners/colonialism) and naoia (now, the present) provide key evaluative reference- points. This accords with what Jolly has described as the Christian master narrative of rupture - the passage from a time of darkness to a time of light - which signals both the difference between the heathen past and the Christian present, and that between the closed world of 'not knowing' and the dawning of secular enlightenment through education and exposure to the values of modernity (1997: 156). As an index of 'bifo', kastom tends to connote primordial or pre-colonial and locally embedded * ways' (fasin, or fashions') - of knowledge, discourse, and practice - that must by turns resist or embrace exogenous and incursive elements that are mainly (but not exclusively)2 considered to have their origins in the West. These time-spaces are also accorded a geographical logic. In both ni- Vanuatu under- standings and social-scientific writing there is a general tendency to equate rural contexts with 'authentic' indigenous kastom, while taon (town) or urban spaces repre- sent a kind of border-zone between those indigenous 'roots' of pies (place) and trans- forming (whether corrupting or enhancing) exogenous influences (see Jolly 1992). Belying these distinctions is a view of 'fatal impact', but also a more generalized appre- ciation that such temporal rupture is also associated with material inequalities - of unequal access to wealth, technology, and knowledge. Such narratives thus tend to be linked to aspirations relating to things not-kastom: usually, but not always, to acquire them. The ideological understanding that the brute terms of rupture - us/them, local/ foreign, old/new - are engaged in an unequal power relationship is underlined by the fact that it is kastom, rather than its more ill-defined Others, that is the overwhelmingly marked category. Indeed, while people may use terms such as naoia (now), talk about '0/ samting wea i jas kam' (all the things that have recently arrived), or describe how'/ae/ blong taon i kam antap turnas' (literally: 'town life has become too high', or is over- whelming), there is no specific Bislama term for 'modern'. While kastom is often understood to provide the foundation (stamba) of a person's located identity (manples), through the framing of the 'modern' it is in fact kastom - rather than its Others - that is most definitively conceptualized as 'other', and is thus typically con- ceptualized as alien and inferior to the West. Not surprisingly, therefore, not all groups positively value the notion of kastom, and indeed the generally amti-kastom (and anti- kava) evangelical churches often position themselves as 'progressive' through explicit use of this distinction, and in particular through its linkage to 'heathenism'. Teleological understandings underlie much contemporary discourse about kastom in Vanuatu; however, it moves beyond these. As others have noted, kastom and its Others are also frequently imaged as coeval and dialectically intertwined (e.g. Jolly 1996; Lindstrom 1982a; Rousseau 2004; Tonkinson 1981). Not only do the categories kastom/ not-kastom and their associated evocations share a stunning complexity, these Janus-like symptoms of rupture are always-already locked in an uneasy embrace, enfolding each other in a dynamic relationship of hierarchy and encompassment across such abstract groupings as gender, generation, socio-economic status, and located identity (manples). Both local and academic discourse highlights the historically chang- ing and contextually fluid nature of this relationship.

While anthropological discussions concerning the notion of 'modernity' in Vanuatu may be sparse and relatively new,3 for ni- Vanuatu the issues implied by that term are at least as old as colonialism itself (cf. Hirsch 2001: 133), and may predate colonial influence. Sia Raga historians, for instance, view the arrival of tuturani (whites/foreigners) as initiating the most recent of a series of tauva (historical epoch/generations), with each tauva marking the opening of a new cosmological zone (Taylor 2003a). However, it is important to note that the notion of tauva is guided by a rather different ontology of temporality- as shape, trajectory, and dynamic force - than that which frames 'modern' Western thought. Rather than situating successive ruptures along a unilinear trajectory of past (back), present (here), and future (forward) - the 'modern' arrow of time - such linearity is linked further to the notion of 'sides' ( tavalui) , thus opening up the possibility of a dynamic spatial dimension to temporality. An arboreal imagery of roots, trunk, and branches provides a defining metaphor for such space-time reckoning. The importance of the concepts stamba (roots, foundation), rod (road/trajectory), stret (straight, correct), and saed (side, category) to Bislama - and across systems of kinship, exchange, gender relations, and other social forms - suggests that this form of reckoning is not unique to North Pentecost, but is a more general feature of historiography, epistemology, and social consciousness across northern Vanuatu, and indeed the archipelago (Taylor 2008a). Kava has been important to articulating the oscillating relation between the 'sides' of kastom and its Others since at least the early twentieth century, particularly in relation to Christianity (for Fiji, cf. Tomlinson 2004; 2007) . This seems to be the case wherever it was also drunk on a regular basis (e.g. Brunton 1989; Gregory, Gregory &amp; Peck 1981; Young 1995)- One striking example comes from North Pentecost in the early 1930s, where, following an Episcopal ban of the male status transformation rituals called bolololi (in Bislama, bisnis pig, or 'business pig'), society became divided into the 'dean', Anglican church-affiliated melmelo and the kava-'drinking' mwinmwinu (see Hilliard 1978; Taylor 2003a). This division was an early example of ni- Vanuatu creating self-consciously politicized and ostensibly opposed identity categories that would, in the lead-up to Vanuatu's independence in 1980, become more ubiquitously defined by the terms kastom and skul (e.g. Jolly 1994; Tonkinson 1982b) . John Leo Tamata's oral-historical recollection of these events provides a good example of how such categories were not, however, cleanly oppositional. This is further suggested in that Anglican services were often held in North Pentecost nakamal ('men's houses'), buildings that are canonically associated with male status hierarchies and the fraternity of kava-drinking: When Louis Lolo became a catechist he shaved off his beard so that he could enter into cleanliness. But when the split between melmelo and mwinminu occurred he let it grow again. As a catechist he continued to ring the church bell, but he also continued to drink kava. One day Father Matthias Tarileo visited and asked of Louis, 'Are you still going to church?' Louis answered, 'Yes*. 'Are you still drinking kava?' 'Yes'. Matthias Tarileo allowed him to continue in this way for some time, but the Anglicans found it difficult to convert the remaining kastom adherents in the area. They then held a meeting at Atabulu and decided that all kava drinking and pig killing must completely cease. At the conclusion of the meeting Father Matthias asked Louis Lolo why he had not spoken, and if he had anything to add. He replied with a short but powerful speech: Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 16, 279-296 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2010</page><page sequence="6">284 John P. Taylor 'I have only one point to make. I want to tell you that in this life man has a partner; woman. Day too has a partner; night. Rain has a partner; sun. War has a partner; peace*. Then he added, "Every young shoot that comes out from its roots has two sides, left and right. There is never only one. And I believe that the Church has a partner. It is kastom*. Hearing these revolutionary words, Father Matthias said, 'what you say may be true. Let us watch this angai tree [Tahitian almond, canarium indica], and see if your words can eat it*. Following the meeting a group of men went through all the villages of the area. They pulled all the kava plants out of the ground and destroyed their bulin mologu (kava grinding dishes) and basisi (kava grinding stones), in order that kava would no longer be consumed in any North Pentecost gamali. Even so, after a few days the angai tree that was pointed out by Father Matthias dried up and died from the power of Louis Lolo's words. The Church came to Pentecost by a good road, but after this there was fighting, and both Church and kastom faced hardships. But to look at this story men can see that it is right that both Church and kastom can live together (January 2000, as quoted in Taylor 2003fr: 101). Histories such as these suggest the simultaneous deployment of two competing epistemologies of rupture (also see Taylor 2003a; 2006; 2008a) - something of a 'structure of the conjuncture', as Sahlins would put it (1981). Many Anglicans like Father Matthias Tarileo deployed the Christian trope of transformation from a time of darkness to a time of light, a discourse used by both colonial mission and state projects to pacify, convert, and reform (Jolly 1996: 129) . This exogenous narrative of Christian opposition to and conquest over kastom contrasts and intersects with Louis Lolo's insistence that kastom and skul might instead be understood to represent the coeval branches of a single tree, and thus be equated with the ostensibly oppositional, yet also co-dependent and intimate, relations of man and woman, day and night, rain and sun, war and peace. It is my aim here not to rehearse a history of categories such as kastom and skul in Vanuatu, but rather to show how the terms of a sense of rupture are grasped in relation to specific strategies of identity, legitimacy, and power. These relate to what Tonkinson (1982a) has called the 'changing symbiosis' of past and present in Vanuatu, by which kastom and its Others have been diversely figured as incompatible and antagonistic, or as compatible and intimate. Thus, in recalling Louis Lolo's story, the narrator John Leo Tamata self-consciously employs indigenous epistemology as a strategic mode of legiti- mation. By this reckoning, kastom is not understood in the unilinear terms of a revival or even retention from the past, but rather is positively envisaged in a productive pairing with the exogenous other. It is important to be attentive to the gendered dimension of such evocations, and in particular the way in which this image instantiates a particular ideal of masculinity. Witness the embodied image of modernity in the Janus-like figure of Louis Lolo, who rings the church bell with one hand while drinking kava with the other. Just like Janus, the Roman God of beginnings and endings, Lolo embodies transition and seems to possess the gift to see both past and future. As I have argued elsewhere, this ability simultaneously to incorporate kastom and its Others has emerged as a powerfully hegemonic strategy, but also a burden for ni- Vanuatu men (Taylor 2008fr: 175-6). Ideologically speaking, this is particularly the case for those urban-dwelling young people who are deemed to be socially and geographically estranged from their 'roots' of kastom, but also for those villagers who are unable to gain access to the 'modernity' offered by town. The conjunction of the indigenous and exogenous remains a largely positively valued ideal of male gendered subjectivities, but for ni- Vanuatu women it tends to entail different burdens and perils. While men are often expected to author themselves Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 16, 279-296 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2010</page><page sequence="7">Janus and the siren's call 285 as active agents in negotiating this productive if difficult interplay of 'sides', women tend to be positioned more passively as signs of one or the other: of either the emplaced values of kastom, on one hand, or the liberating potential of the foreign and the 'progressive', on the other. Thus Margaret Jolly applauds those ni- Vanuatu women who by contrast assert their value 'in both tradition and modernity, past and present, and indeed are trying to dissolve these invidious dichotomies which still threaten to sunder their subjectivity as women' (1997: 160). Little wonder too, then, that the recent dra- matic rise in female kava-drinking is creating such a stir in the kava bucket. My aim in taking account of such associations is not somehow to redeem kastom vis-à-vis notions of the modern. Instead I argue that the relationship between kastom and its Others is central to gendered formulations of identity and personhood, and to strategies of embodied practice within the contemporary modernity of Vanuatu. As linked and even sometimes interchangeable concepts, both kastom and the modern make reference to the past but are intrinsically future-orientated, especially in provid- ing key reference-points within people's cognitive schemes of intentionality. Here I treat intentionality as a function of inter-subjectivity: it always occurs in relationship to the words, actions, and expectations of other people, is embodied and historical, and is formed through reference to specific social and spatial contexts (Toren 2002: 220, after Merleau-Ponty 1962). Something of the fraught inter-subjective dynamics of intentionality that contend within the gendered spaces of Vanuatu's contemporary modernity was evocatively articulated to me by Jean Tarisesei (of Ambae, and Director of the National Women's Fieldworker Program). In a fragment of recorded conversation, she explained to me some of the dilemmas confronting men and women as they negotiated the anxiously oscillating relationship of kastom and its Others in the process of producing relation- ships through mediations of respek (respect), and in terms of the dilemma of being in Time. Here she describes an occasion in which a pre-eminently ranked man of the famous kastom village of Bunlap, in South Pentecost, insisted that she and a female companion drink kava from his kava dish. As she explained, while the chief felt this controversial action necessary to show an appropriate level of 'respect' to an urban 'bigfala womari, 'respect' at the same time provided the reason for her inability to refuse the drink: I should refuse. But to look down another road, it's about respect. You see? If I were to run away he'd think, 'Oh, she's just acting flash, showing off [i.e. at being a 'good kastom woman']. So, I drink! It's all confused (fasfas) now. Because, if he didn't give it to me, well, he too would think, 'She is an important woman who does all this work, but I can't pay respect to her with anything else, so I should give kava to her'. The proper way is that a man who wants to show respect to a woman should go and ask other women, 'Should I give something to her? What should I give?' But this [use of kava] is a way for men to invite women to be a part of them as a group. To show respect to a woman, they must treat you as a man. Today there are many changes taking place, and we can't stay the same all the time. But we try to make the ways of the past - the good ways, all the respect - not get lost. And this is a big thing too - how to make the good ways of the past, like the respect, how to make this stay (Jean Tarisesei, Maewo airfield, August 2005). The fluid gender of kava Such fraught problematics regarding gendered relations and kava-drinking practice can be readily seen to have emerged within the context of Vanuatu's transition from colonial outpost to 'modern' independent state (see Miles 1998). The sociality of Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 16, 279-296 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2010</page><page sequence="8">286 John P. Taylor kava-drinking was transformed considerably following independence in 1980, when ni- Vanuatu entrepreneurs seized on market opportunities offered by the growth of urban ni- Vanuatu populations in Luganville and Port Vila. While kava had previously been used routinely by men on plantations and in town, urban 'kava bars' proliferated in the early 1980s following the staggering commercial successes of pioneering young entrepreneurs in Luganville and Port Vila. Indeed, the popularity of such ventures was also grasped by the new government, who sought to promote kava use in town both as a peaceful alternative to alcohol and as a part of the revaluation of things kastom, the 'narcotic of nationalism* (Miles 1998: 74-6; Philibert 1986). Kava is heralded for its peace-giving qualities, in contrast to the 'heat* of anger- inducing alcohol, and for its soliciting of quietude rather than the provocation of talk. Thus oral-historical narratives remember that the first kava bar to open in Luganville played a crucial role in establishing harmonious relations following the 'Santo Rebel- lion' of 1980, and between the ni- Vanuatu and many mainly francophone whites who frequented it (Eron Tevi, interview recorded at Banban, Espiritu Santo, August 2005). Since that time, kava bars have proliferated to become an established feature of the urban environment, and one of the most dynamic sectors of Vanuatu's largely informal economy. Lebot estimated a staggering 200 kava bars for Port Vila in 2001 (2001: 6), and seventy were counted in Luganville in 2005 (LMC Wardens' Survey, August 2005, Andrew Ala, pers. comm.). These serve total populations of around 35,000 and 13,000, respectively. Kava bars are typically run by individual family groups, are often attached to family homes, and are most typically patronized by extended kin or by people who share an identity based on pies (place) of regional origin or linguistic ties. Indeed, the propri- etors' home island often provides the 'unofficial' name for kava bars. Kava bars are therefore great places for researchers to establish relationships with particular commu- nities (with men, in particular, although this is rapidly changing). Furthermore, the environment of kava bars inculcates a form of sociality that is particularly conducive to ethnographic fieldwork (in the earlier stages of drinking sessions, at least), namely quiet fraternal 'participant-observation' and reflective discussion. As Michael Young has so eloquently put it: Kava needs quiet, dimly-lit and restful surroundings to complement the inner experience. I too enjoyed that first 'happy hour* as the kava murmurs and one's mind mellows and floats beyond immediate concerns. There is the warm sense of peace and fellowship, and the gentle tug of antici- pation of small good things to come: the first nibble of food, the first cigarette, the visible pattern of stars, the moonlight on the hills and sea, and above all perhaps, the pure mental pleasure of allowing one's thoughts to weave in and out of the fragments of quiet conversation (Young 1995: 89; see also Harrisson 1937: 278). Such valorizations of an aesthetic of quiet male fraternity are common, but the power of kava has also moved beyond this generalized mood. Being linked with regional and emerging national identities, and the ostensibly stark contrasts between rural and urban contexts, kava became a focus through which to articulate the numer- ous re-inscriptions of rupture that occurred in the turbulent lead-up to independence, for instance in providing fluid cultural content for those Western-educated and nation- alist elites who sought to assert their masculine identities through conjoining kastom and modernity. Far from being unique to Vanuatu, popular discourses about kastom emerged across the post-war Western Pacific as part of broader movements towards nationalism Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 16, 279-296 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2010</page><page sequence="9">Janus and the siren's call 287 (Lindstrom 2008: 165). These were further galvanized through rhetorical appeals to ideas such as the 'The Melanesian Way', and were taken up dramatically in art festivals, tourist events, and rituals of state (Keesing 2000: 232-3; also Lindstrom &amp; White 1994). Both the salvage approach of culture specialists and the 'modernizing' visions of edu- cated ni- Vanuatu thus began to employ a concept of kastom as indexical and consum- able, one that tended to reinforce the view that apprehends rupture as a radical split between two times, taem naoltaem bifo&gt; as the Radio Vila programme was called from 1971, as was the First National Arts Festival in 1979 (Bolton 1999: 340). In Vanuatu, within this context of nationalism, kastom was primarily promoted through such tangible masculine cultural symbols as the pig's tusk and cycad leaf, a coat of arms in which women were literally erased, and through the establishment of a National Council of Chiefs. It can thus be seen to have been formulated - during this period at least - as a part of primarily male gender strategies that sought to deny, subvert, or downplay the political hegemony of the West through highlighting a notion of identity premised on 'authentic' cultural difference and past identities (Jolly 1997; also Hau'ofa 1987; Keesing 2000). It was also intimately related to the growth of kava as a recreational drink in urban contexts (Bolton 2003: 22; Philibert 1986). Indeed, Father Walter Lini, who was one of the chief proponents in the pre-independence resurgence of kastom (and who now represents an archetype of the kind of Janus-like masculinity I have described above), reputedly frequented the first kava bars in both Port Vila and Luganville for the purpose of engaging with those men who are metaphorically located at 'grassroots level' (in the idiom of Bislama politik). Not surprisingly, within this context the articulation of kastom and its Others through kava and kava-drinking became important to foreign 'culture specialists', for largely the same reasons. Lindstrom's 1980s work on the entanglement of kava within relations of production, exchange, and gender, and across both rural and urban contexts, remains the most nuanced to date (1982a; 1987; and Lebot et al 1992). His article 'Grog blong yumi' (1982a) explored how kastom and the 'modern' were inculcated within the lives of Tannese men, not just as discourse, but as embodied behaviour. This focused on what he saw as the 'culturally incompatible' categories of kava and alcohol, 'contrastive symbols' that corresponded to 'a larger conceptual opposition that people make between things kastom and things modern' (1982a: 432). Although kava and alcohol were both understood to be 'grog', each was (and is) associated with a different kind of drunken comportment: quiet and passive in the case of kava, and violent and noisy in the case of alcohol. Lindstrom concluded that the 'mixing of the times and places of intoxication of the two substances themselves could only be confusing. Drinkers would not know how to act: quiet or noisy, calm or violent?' (1982a: 432). The broader sentiment of this analysis resonates across the five hundred miles of ocean and island that separate Tanna from northern Vanuatu, and the more than twenty years that separates our ethnography and analysis. Here men continue to perform and romanti- cize the ideal of passive fraternity when they drink kava. This mixture of same-sex relations and quietude is considered necessary to gain from kava the desired effect of being sufficiently 'killed' or 'hit' (e.g. kava i kit) and/or the achievement of spiritual or ancestral inspiration (see Lebot et al 1992: 132; Lindstrom 1990). Ideals described in Bislama as 'kastom' richly inform the embodied practice of kava-drinking, in both nakamal and kava bars. In North Pentecost nakamal, formalized practices are routinely observed: such as the recitation of a Christian prayer prior to the commencement of drinking, and the observance of a status-based drinking order Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 16, 279-296 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2010</page><page sequence="10">288 John P. Taylor supervised by an appropriately ranked man. However, rather than adhering to a strict sense of ritualized practice, these formalities are understood to operate according to the same broad ethos of respek ('respect') discussed by Tarisesei (above): for the kava, the person who prepared it, the nakamal and its inhabitants. Respect is also outwardly shown by drinkers who crouch beside or face-to-face with the man who painstakingly prepared their drink, and by taking care not to step across the accoutrements of kava production. In a kava bar - where a physical serving counter works to separate pro- ducer from consumer, as does, very broadly speaking, the commodity economy by which that transaction is undertaken - men from North Pentecost instead tend to retire to a quiet corner, and there crouch to drink their half-coconut shell of kava. This is merely one of a corpus of more-or-less consciously performed acts which signal a man's 'respect' for the broadly shared 'kava habitus' (cf. Bourdieu 1977) of nakamal and kava bars, including a slow approach on arrival, general quietness, moderation and restraint, and care with torches and other bright lights to which kava-drunk eyes are sensitive. At the same time, kava bars are also increasingly incorporating the 'modern' qualities of Lindstrom's analysis, including noise, particularly in the form of live entertainment, and alcohol. Thus, during research undertaken in July and August 2005, for instance, at Saratua kava bar in Luganville, I shared several shells of kava with friends, some of whom were female, while the Wasi Boys String Band pumped out renditions oVAelan Dress Blong Yutnf and 'Gel Pentikos'. This was followed up by a kale (or 'chaser') of Tusker beer (see Lebot et al 1992: 140), purchased over the same counter as the kava. Likewise, at 'Side River' kava bar at Latano Village, North Pentecost, I attended a weekly fundraiser that also included string bands and dancing, and alcohol could be purchased at the adjoining store. Here the several women present were jokingly referred to as 'men' (but more about that later). For some other commentators, the ideological revaluation of kastom alongside or into modernity was difficult to reconcile with evolutionary frameworks. Thus many fell into the distinctly 'modernist' trap of emphasizing material 'progress' over questions of identity or ontological process in evaluating the relative 'authenticity' of various expres- sions of kastom. For Jean-Marc Philibert (1986), in a stark example from the contempo- raneous 'invention of tradition' debate, the adoption and promotion of kava-drinking by urban male ni- Vanuatu and political 'elites' exemplified a cynical analysis that contrasted the un-self-consciously performed and 'true' 'traditions' of islanders, on one hand, and the ideologically produced 'no-name brand' kastom of urban 'évolués', on the other. Thus Philibert's argument relied on a radical dichotomization and equation of spatial catego- ries - such as urban and rural, and foreign and local - with temporal ones - such as modern and traditional - against which the category kastom was measured in terms of degrees of authenticity (Philibert 1986; and see Rousseau 2004: 32). Analyses such as these may appear naive from the enlightened perspectives of academic critiques, but they resonate with those that have been repeatedly articulated to me by ni- Vanuatu. As earlier suggested, engaging people in kava-related talk often provokes narratives of socio-cultural degradation, particularly given the soporific effects of the brew and the tendency for heavy drinkers to 'las9 (to feel lazy, be disin- clined to work) the next day (for Fiji, cf. Tomlinson 2004). These narratives are invari- ably stretched across a spatial framework in which understandings of the embedded, correct or stret (straight, correct) sociality of village life is seen to be threatened by the transformations, innovations, and importations of town. Kava-drinkers are frequently Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 16, 279-296 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2010</page><page sequence="11">Janus and the siren's call 289 cautioned against the perils of drinking 'olbaof (all about), in unfamiliar kava bars, or in those that attract a clientele of 'mixed' island origin or gender. Such mixing of place-based identities is more broadly linked to a perception of increased incidents of nakaimas (or sorcery) in town, especially in relation to kava bars. Such narratives are extended further to form a feedback loop in that the integrity of the masculine romance of the village nakamal (or men's house) is seen to be corrupted through the return of hybridized or corrupted ideas and practices generated within urban kava bars. One pervasive narrative involves the degradation of inter-generational masculine relationships. The kastom past is idealized in the image of a young man who grinds kava for an older man of knowledge, but who himself does not drink, and in doing so departs with an important kernel of wisdom. Indeed, it is a widely insisted 'kava convention' (Young 1995: 81) that in the past only much older men drank kava, and that they did so in great moderation. Rather than being valued for their historical 'truth',4 such statements link kava's intoxicating properties to more generalized notions of excess and degeneracy (cf. Tomlinson 2004). They also belie important concerns regarding a perceived demise of inter-generational fraternity, particularly through the breakdown of the nakamal ('men's houses') and sumbwe ('graded society') as primary male social institutions in relation to the negative consequences that things not-kastom - town life, Western-style education, the cash economy, alcohol - have entailed for the socialization of young men. By contrast, women are generally discouraged from drinking kava for pleasure, and especially in kava bars and other 'public' places or events in which kava is drunk. Even so, recent years have witnessed a marked increase in female kava-drinkers in such contexts. This, coupled with a perceived increase in excessive kava-drinking by men, is directly linked to negative individual health and social impacts (see McDonald &amp; Jowitt 2000), and in particular is seen to have contributed to increases in domestic violence. Indeed, kava is routinely the cause of disputes within households: a drinker's absence from home and the necessary provision of food upon return, and the strain on domes- tic economies owing to household incomes spent on kava or lost as a result of lack of work are often the subject of ongoing disputes within families, and especially between men and their wives. Let me now consider the associative triptych kava, kastomy woman, and the generally stated opinion that 'woman wea i dring kava i no stref (literally: 'a woman who drinks kava is not straight', but also, 'when women drink kava it's not correct/right'). Prior to independence in 1980, kava-drinking in northern Vanuatu was largely sanctioned as an adult male-only activity. Such restrictions did not apply for older women of status in some communities, such as North Pentecost, and women did drink kava for medicinal purposes (Brunton 1989: 64-5; Speiser 1990 [1923]: 145-8). While such prohibitions might be interpreted as integral to broader patterns of male domi- nation and the control of women's bodies, at least since the colonial period, they also accord with indigenous understandings concerning the important dynamic between crops and people, place, ancestral power, and sexed bodies (see Jolly 1994; Taylor 2008a). Such understandings are crucial to the present analysis, particularly as they articulate with the associations and narratives that arise in the intersection between gender and modernity as temporal rupture, as discussed above. In North Pentecost, kava is explicitly associated with female sexed bodies. Indeed, the theme that kava originated by growing out of a dead woman's womb or vagina is common across northern Vanuatu, thus suggesting the cycle of death and fertility (see Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 16, 279-296 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2010</page><page sequence="12">290 John P. Taylor Lebot et al. 1992: 127-38). Kava talk is often explicitly sexualized. A man departing to dig a kava root for the evening's consumption, for instance, might do so by joking that he is going in search of a beautiful young woman, and the seductive allure of an evening of kava-drinking is often rhetorically likened to a siren's call - 'mi harem wan woman i singaof ('I hear a woman calling'). What is more, the embodied technique of prepar- ing kava is explicitly understood to be likened to the act of sexual intercourse, particu- larly in the grinding processes. Here chunks of kava root are held in one hand and ground with the tip of a long and clearly phallic piece of coral (called a basis in Raga) that is held between the legs in the other hand, like an erect penis. The consumption of kava itself accords to broader understandings regarding the nature of regeneration - such as also attend to the processes of childbirth, pig sacrifice, and the acquisition of ancestral names, and the harvesting of particular crops (yams especially) - by which people and spaces are infused with differing intensities of ancestral power or sacred energy. In terms of such fluctuating powers, and hi order to ensure ongoing health, vitality, and fertility, the movement of people and consumption of substances must be carefully managed. Given these connections, the combination of women's bodies and kava is both powerful and dangerous in relation to men. Thus, for instance, having sex after drinking kava is believed to imperil a man's strength and general health, and also a couple's mutual fertility. In this way kava consumption in North Pentecost is ideally restricted to male bodies and generally confined within gamali (to use the Raga term for nakamal), or within the so-called 'men's houses' in which women's movement is severely restricted (Taylor 2008a: 159-60). The somewhat paradoxical reason for this is that separating male from female at such times secures rather than inhibits fertility and natural fecundity (cf. Jolly 2001a: 178). When I have asked both men and women just what it is that makes the practice of female kava-drinking 'not straight', the immediate answer is invariably simply 'because of kastom! (also noted for Tanna by Lindstrom 1987: 106). Such statements reflect the idea that discourse about kastom is primarily concerned with the legitimation of relations of socio-political power (Rousseau 2004: 39). Indeed, the contested question of whether women should be allowed to drink kava also articulates with debates concerning assertions of 'women's rights' in Vanuatu, such as have become a key site of 'gender antagonism' in recent years. Thus, although kastom is more often invoked in this way as a reason why women should not imbibe, so too is Christianity, as is the case with assertions of male domination and patriarchy (Taylor 2008b). Speaking more generally, socially enforced prohibitions and anxieties surrounding women's kava- drinking feed into more diffuse ideological bracketing of women as subjects of both state and community surveillance, and meld with messages of domesticity and norma- tive Western gender ideals (see Jolly 2001a; 2001b). That kava has become a particularly powerful vehicle in articulating male hegemony and the subjugation of women in Vanuatu is compounded in the profound resonances that adhere between narratives associated with kava and those that are so often attached to women, particularly in relation to mobility and the passage between island villages and town. Indeed, as a profoundly anthropomorphic and social 'thing' (cf. Appadurai 1986), kava is subject to those very same terms by which a sense of temporal rupture is linked to gendered bodies, such as I outlined at the beginning of this article. While the ideology that has figured women - contra men - as kastom or 'modern' on either/or terms (cf. Jolly 1997) appears to be breaking down, it continues to maintain a significant legacy. Increasingly, and particularly among the mainly urban and relatively educated Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 16, 279-296 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2010</page><page sequence="13">Janus and the siren's call 291 and 'progressive' women and men who are embracing it, the idea that a woman should be free to drink kava (at home and in commercial kava bars, rather than island nakamal, at least) is associated with ideas concerning the positive and liberating poten- tial of modernity. For most people, however, ideas linking kava, kastomy and women work to situate women's kava-drinking in a much more negative light. (So too, in some contexts, do visions of modernity, for instance in the views of evangelical churches, who ban their parishioners from drinking.) In much the same way as women, and indeed as a woman, the fertile power of kava is understood to be compromised through its contact with kastorris Others: through movement into urban space and when processed through use of Modern' technology, such as industrial meat grinders, in particular. Female kava-drinking in urban kava bars is likewise linked to an increased incidence of marital stress and divorce, domestic violence, and to female promiscuity and prostitution. Such discourse neatly plays into the Christian idea that the primary role of women is as wives and mothers, and operates alongside other recent debates (such as whether women should be allowed to wear trousers rather than the more conservative 'island dress' [Rousseau 2004] ) that reify the idea of the chaste and modest 'good woman' (Jolly &amp; Manderson 1997: 13). Indeed, messages that link female kava-drinking with more broadly perceived social ills are often powerfully reinforced within church services and by (highly patriarchal) church leaders of all denominations. At this level, ideas of kastom blend with a broadly Chris- tian eschatology that itself reinforces a diffuse disciplinary technology (Foucault 1979), aimed primarily at curtailing the intentions and actions of women. It is important to recognize in this way the discursive legitimating power of terms such as kastomy and their implication within broader gendered power strategies. However, by taking the words out of people's mouths, as it were, such analyses must nevertheless be seen as limited insofar as they disconnect minds (as disembodied talk) and bodies. Thus purely discursive analyses invite the same powerful criticisms that were levelled at the so-called 'invention of tradition' literature, especially for its insinu- ation that kastom represents nothing more than 'false consciousness': by overlooking the very real emotive force of understandings encapsulated in terms such as kastomy by neglecting the broader cosmographies from which they derive, and by vitiating their importance to embodied subjectivities and intentionalities. Within the 'kava habitus', embodied behaviour can have the (both conscious or unconscious) effect of either reinscribing or subverting broader understandings concerning gender, sexuality, fertil- ity, reproduction, and their relation to spatial practice. Here, the gendering of behav- iour appears in a constant state of flux, and articulates the complex interpénétration and friction that adheres between deeply embedded cosmological understandings and present day socio-political concerns. Woman wea i dring kava i no stret: embodying contradictions When I press to ask what particular aspect of kastom proscribes women from drinking kava (why a woman drinking kava is not 'straight'), most people from Pentecost, Ambae, and Maewo especially go on to say, 'Women can't drink kava because kava is woman, and a woman can't take back a woman' ('woman i no save karem woman bakageri). Women shouldn't drink kava because, since kava is itself understood to be charged with female potency, to do so might endanger the fertility of women and sexual potency of men (for North Pentecost, see Taylor 2008a: 228; for Tanna cf. Lindstrom 1997)- This understanding is clearly linked with those cosmological understandings in Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 16, 279-296 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2010</page><page sequence="14">292 John P. Taylor which productive exchange takes place across a meaningful space of difference, of 'sides' (and see Taylor 2003a). In this case the productivity of difference is considered to be eclipsed or even imperilled by sameness. As Lebot et al. have pointed out for the wider Pacific region, where kava poses as mythologically feminine, women's use of the drug is made to seem to be abnormal and shameful homosexual intercourse (1992: 135). As a part of what seemed to me a remarkable attempt to overcome these transgressions of both ideology and 'sacred space' (cf. Jolly 1989), in 2005 it was for a little while common in kava bar talk for female drinkers to be jokingly referred to as 'men' or 'boys', or as Jean Tarisesei put it within a more 'respectful' context, treated 'as a man' (see quote above). In the conclusion to his article 'Drunkenness and gender on Tanna, Vanuatu', Lind- strom wonders whether Tannese women - being equated with kava, but also necessarily kept separate from it - may ever have a hope of drinking it (1987: 116). Within the commercial kava bars of Port Vila and Luganville, the answer to this question would now seem to be 'yes'. Women, old and young - and including women from Tanna - are increasingly embracing capitalism's ostensibly liberating potentials by taking up kava- drinking within these commercial contexts, and thus transgressing those gendered lines of intoxication that have helped determine and maintain heterosexual relations of inequality (Lindstrom 1987: 99). However, female kava-drinking not only represents an affront to the dominant patriarchal gender order and its attendant kastom and Chris- tian discursive ideologies, it also confronts more diffusely held knowledge concerning the relationship between sexed bodies, consumed substances, fertility, and space. It is significant to note that women operate in much more subtle and varying ways within the broader 'kava habitus' than simple abstinence or consumption. Thus, despite the prohibitive discourse of kastom, it is very often considered acceptable for a woman to send a child to purchase kava as a takeaway, and to then drink moderately at home with female friends, or particular male kin (same-moiety kin, especially). But, as one woman told me, 'It's no good if I go and stand up at a kava bar, because this is a place for men. And it's not straight that I go to such a place. If you go to a bar on your own, it means you're like a prostitute'. Likewise, some men and women express the idea that it is acceptable for women to drink in kava bars in town, as long as they do so within a group of women. Indeed, the original Luganville kava bar pioneer, Eron Tevi, playfully suggested to me that if he were still in the business he would instigate women-only Thursdays at his kava bar. It would seem, therefore, that at this more embodied level, the problem is not so much with the fact of women drinking kava per se, or even their presence at kava bars, but rather with kava consumption within the context of particu- lar cross-sex relations, and those linked on kinship terms to the potentiality of procre- ation, in particular.5 Conclusion This has not been an article about kava in Vanuatu per se. Rather, kava-related discourse and practices have provided the centrepiece for an exploration into the articulation of gender and modernity in Vanuatu, particularly insofar as these are so intimately and inextricably intermingled within its fluid content. The heady mixture of reassurances, anxieties, hopes, and nostalgias that infuse kava-related discourse, coupled with the diverse, value-laden contexts and practices of kava consumption (and production), recalls Miller's assertion that consumption 'may not be about choice, but rather the sense that we have no choice but to overcome the experience of rupture using those very Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 16, 279-296 © Royal Anthropological Institute 2010</page><page sequence="15">)ANUS AND THE SIREN'S CALL 293 same goods and images which create for many the sense of modernity as rupture* (1995: 2). Kava use in northern Vanuatu entails the embodiment of concerns about kastom and its Others, particularly as these are articulated in ideals of island nakamal (so-called 'men's houses', see Taylor 2003b: 203) - in which kava is said to be "free", and consumed exclusively by men, more or less in accordance with stret kastom - and the commercial 'kava bars' of urban Port Vila and Luganville - where kastom has been let loose (gone olbaot nomo). Exploring the transforming 'kava habitus' across these contexts reveals unique insights into the relationship between kastom and modernity in discourse, gendered identity, and embodied practice. In particular, here we have seen that concerns regarding female kava-drinking in Vanuatu do not simply accord with Western or Christian-derived constructions of gendered power, or with attempts to maintain male hegemony in the face of assertions of women's rights. Rather, the friction and flux of gendered behaviour is here seen to emerge from the complex articulation of these important sites of socio-political contest with more sedimented cosmological under- standings regarding fertility, sacred power, and the nature of sexed bodies. NOTES Since 1999 I have undertaken a total of three years field research in Vanuatu, primarily based in North Pentecost and in Luganville. I wish to acknowledge the Gender Relations Centre (Australian National University), the Wenner-Gren Foundation, and the Vanuatu Cultural Centre for providing financial and other support for this project. 1 The lingua franca of Vanuatu is Bislama, which is generally characterized as a form of 'pijin English'. In this article I use the Bislama word "nakamaV to refer to those buildings found in villages throughout northern Vanuatu (and generally known by cognate terms in indigenous languages of the region) that are associated with male 'graded societies' and with fraternal kava-drinking. These are often referred to (somewhat erro- neously) in social science literature as 'men's houses'. I use the term 'kava bar' (in Bislama 'kava ba' or simply 'ba') to refer to the commercial contexts of kava consumption that are found across both urban and rural contexts. Just as there is considerable overlap in the uses and meanings associated with these spaces, kava bars are routinely referred to as nakamal in Bislama, although (according to the definition used here) not vice versa. 2 Luganville, for instance, also has a strong Asian presence, particularly in the form of Chinese business- people and their families, who operate the majority of trade stores and dominate the export industries, including that of kava. In another kava-related example, reggae, and with it Rastafarianism, has been widely embraced by young people, and the term 'Jah Bless' has become a popular kava-drinking toast amongst one extended group in Port Vila. 3 The term 'modernity' has been most prevalently applied to discussions of ni- Vanuatu women s lives (Douglas 2002; Jolly 1996; 1997). It is also discussed in two powerful ethnographies of Tanna (Bonnemaison 1994; Lindstrom 1990). 4 Indeed, oral-historical evidence often quite clearly contradicts this ideal. 5 Expressing what is perhaps a rather unusual interpretation of the powerful link between kava and sexed bodies, a young Sia Raga man once told me that if a woman were to rub kava on a man's genitals prior to sexual intercourse, it would cause him terrible illness, and perhaps death.

Taylor Janus et l'appel de la sirène : kava et articulation du genre et de la modernité au Vanuatu Résumé Dans les îles du Vanuatu, dans le Pacifique Sud, on dit souvent que « les femmes ne peuvent pas boire du kava parce que le kava est une femme, et une femme ne peut pas reprendre une femme ». Ces raisonnements prescripteurs sont liés à des notions cosmologiques profondément enracinées de fertilité, de pouvoir sacré et de la nature des corps sexués. Elles évoquent également la situation de tension entourant les relations de genre et la pratique de consommation du kava qui s'est constituée lors du passage du Vanuatu du statut de poste colonial avancé à celui d'État-nation indépendant. Le présent article décrit sous un angle ethno-historique critique le sens complexe de la rupture qui imprègne le discours et les activités quotidiens concernant le kava au Vanuatu. Il jette ainsi un important éclairage sur la relation entre « la kastom et ses Autres » dans le discours des ni- Vanuatu aussi bien que des chercheurs, entre les identités sexuées et dans la pratique incarnée.
