<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Carceral Regime: Violence and Social Memory in Southwest China Erik Mueggler Department of Anthropology University of Michigan Look through those open windows. Walk along this street. You can enter the residential lanes on either side. What will you see? What will you hear? What will you be reminded of? -Yu Hua, "Yijiu baliu nian" (Nineteen Eighty-six) In Yu Hua's story "Nineteen Eighty-six," a high-school history teacher and amateur scholar of ancient techniques of state punishment returns to his home- town. Many years before, during the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards took him from his home, tortured him, and locked him up in a school office. He escaped into a world of insane hallucination and wandered the countryside for nearly two decades. In that time, his wife remarried and his daughter forgot him. On his return, he inflicts on himself in the town's streets the "five punishments," which he had studied in texts from the Qin dynasty and before: mo (branding), yi (cutting off the nose), fei (severing the legs at the knees), gong (castration), and dapi (dismemberment). While he mutilates himself with hot irons, knives, saws, rocks, and cleavers, his wife, his daughter, and the other townspeople refuse to recognize him. Eventually, his howls of pain become a nuisance. A policeman declines to get involved, and a gang of youths bind the madman with a rope. The next morning, his wife and daughter experience a sense of relief as they watch a sanitation worker cart off the bound corpse. A few months later, after spring turns to summer, two young girls inexplicably spot him in the streets again, clean and well groomed, "hopping toward them like a flea." His wife and daughter approach and he calls out after them, but they walk past as if they had never met: "The madman kept hopping down the sidewalk, calling all the while for his 'little sister.' The mother and daughter kept on walking down the street. They didn't look back. They moved forward with ease and grace" (Yu 1987:80). Most scholarly treatments of the politics of memory and forgetting employ a well-worn conceptual vocabulary: inscription and erasure, commemoration and transmission, repression and return of the repressed. In reference to contempo- rary China, this vocabulary is used to elucidate tensions between a state determined Cultural Anthropology 13(2): 167-192. Copyright ? 1998, American Anthropological Association. 167</page><page sequence="2">168 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY to keep the national imagination fixed on present and future economic expan- sion, on the one hand, and those who continue to nurture personal recollections of past horror, injustice, and division, on the other. Some employ this vocabu- lary to catalog the strategies with which the state reorganizes the past, com- memorating its own origins and progress in master narratives and repressing memories that evade or threaten these narratives (Watson 1994). Others use it to show how the state encourages or coerces victims and victimizers to weave their memories into a "tale of progress and redemption" (Rofel 1991) in which the Cultural Revolution appears as a national error overcome through the present re- gime's reformist policies. Still others search the interstices of official amnesia for "spaces of subversion" (Judd 1994) where suppressed or discredited memo- ries continue to play themselves out. And others probe temporal and geographi- cal peripheries of state power for places where fragmented personal memories can form "secret histories" (Schwarcz 1994) that become resources for personal authenticity, wellsprings for personal redemption, or foundations for a true mourning that can take adequate measure of past injuries. But a psychoanalytic vocabulary, dominated by the old familiar round of state repression and personalized returns of the repressed, hardly seems ade- quate to deal with imaginative accounts of social memory and forgetting like Yu Hua's tale. While this story might easily be read as a tale of repression and re- turn, its details seem to emerge from another logic altogether. The minutely de- scribed techniques of cutting, crushing, burning, and dismemberment bring to mind both the punitive power of the imperial state and vivid descriptions of Buddhist hells, in which an economy of karma and retribution plays itself out on the bodies of the dead. The schoolteacher appropriates this theater of punish- ment to himself, making vividly present the past insults to his body by re-inflicting them on himself in the streets. Yet unlike the audience of Cultural Revolution- ary struggle sessions, this theater's present audience is looking the other way. Their inattention incarcerates him again, binding and immobilizing his body and hiding his wounds. This tale brings a history of techniques of corporeal pun- ishment monopolized by the state to the fore of the problem of memory and for- getting in interpersonal relationships. It probes the relationship between a spe- cific kind of modernity, in which civil authority continues to be sustained through incarceration and punishment, and individual efforts to fix or evade re- sponsibility for past interpersonal violence. How can we explore such evocations of social memory without subjecting them immediately to the rules of thumb and quick analytic strategies that histo- rians and ethnographers have made of psychoanalytic categories? We know that we cannot step out of these categories' embrace simply by stepping over geo- graphical or cultural space. However fragmented and domesticated in its pas- sage through other disciplines, psychoanalysis remains the dominant language available to us to speak of memory and forgetting; it has accumulated allies enough in every discipline so that new understandings of memory cannot easily develop outside it (Latour 1988). Still, translation can reshape any language by working on it simultaneously from within and without, opening it up toward</page><page sequence="3">A CARCERAL REGIME IN SOUTHWEST CHINA 169 worlds that extend beyond it. As a mode of translation, ethnography reworks language by forcing it into double duty, reformulating its conceptual tools even as it uses them to address idioms they can never fully grasp. By listening to what is said, by paying attention to the details of words and gestures, narratives and silences, ethnography can invite idioms that exceed its reach to corrupt the integ- rity of its own categories. Through such corruption, we may learn something new. An ethnography committed to the cultural and historical specificity of so- cial memory in China would be self-conscious in its use of psychoanalytic vo- cabularies, even as it abandoned efforts to elucidate a "Chinese" mode of social memory (see, for example, Casey 1984). It would recognize that memory and forgetting may participate in different idioms and take on various temporalities within a single community and a single historical period. It would trace these idioms and temporalities at a local level, pursuing the narratives and silences that organize, contest, or suppress them. The present article moves in this direc- tion. Following Yu Hua's lead, I seek to discern the shadow of an imagined his- tory of state-monopolized corporeal violence in a specific mode of reference that shapes tales of the Cultural Revolution in a single community, called Zhizuo. This "minority" community is inhabited largely by people who are of- ficially Yi, one of China's 55 "minority nationalities."' People in Zhizuo would recognize much in Yu Hua's tale. Insanity, ritualized retribution, and punitive techniques that included piercing, cutting, or binding were frequent themes in their own accounts of those killed or wounded in the Cultural Revolution. Nev- ertheless, specific local differences also forcefully shape their strategies of memory and forgetting. Here, I show how this community's residents might em- ploy such differences to reinterpret the play of incarceration and release that so powerfully frames Yu Hua's story. I argue that the state's capacity to punish by incarcerating bodies structured a mode of reference which people in this com- munity applied broadly to everything from shamanic techniques to tales of dis- covering salt-and ultimately to memories of the Cultural Revolution's bitter interpersonal violence. I seek to show that the capacity of the state to inflict vio- lence on bodies lies at the root of social memory in this community; this capacity is not merely repressive but also productive (Foucault 1978), a determining con- dition for the regime within which people remember and forget the wrongs of past interpersonal strife. In physical geography, a regime is what creates the quality of flow of a river or stream: the amount of rainfall, type of bedrock, and shape of channel that gen- erate its ripples, waves, dunes, and holes; and the banks, dikes, dams, and diver- sions that make it meander, braid, flood, disperse into deltas, or join with other streams. Here I trace a referential regime that underlies the flow of social life much as a channel does that of a stream, forming the conditions for its existence while being shaped, gradually or catastrophically, by its currents and floods. By reference I mean, in the broadest terms, how people organize the relation be- tween signs, like words, paintings, or statues, and that which these signs indi- cate, reveal, make conspicuous, or otherwise refer to (Heidegger 1962:107-113). I am reluctant to rely heavily on the term representation because in most contexts it</page><page sequence="4">170 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY already connotes a specific form of reference, in which a sign at once reveals and conceals a reality beneath it. By contrast, in the mode of reference I describe here, a sign is a gathering and immobilization of its referent, an incarceration. Here I explore a few channels of the broad, open, unsystematic, but intercon- nected regime in which this form of sign participates, beginning with effigies used in shamanic rituals and moving on to attitudes toward wooden statues, a tale of discovering a salt spring, a god's judgment, a boy's death, and a mother's dream of her son after his suicide during the Cultural Revolution. I use the term regime also for its connotation of a politico-bureaucratic authority, multiple and contradictory in experience, but sustained by an imag- ined unity (Anagnost 1988; Lefort 1986). A political regime is an imagined wa- tershed that gives the braided channels of bureaucratic authority their force and direction. In the carceral regime of reference I trace here, the state's imagined unity reveals its shape in the dams and diversions that direct memory and forget- ting of the most profoundly painful matters. The capacity to inflict corporeal violence, on which this unity depends, is involved in the processes of memory and forgetting at the most personal level. In calling this regime incarceration, I wish to echo and distort the vocabulary of more familiar efforts to inquire into the interdependence of memory and corporeal violence, such as inscription, in- corporation, and encryption.2 Although writing about social memory cannot yet break free of the psychoanalytic regime, it can carve out new channels as we let our eth- nographic worlds creatively corrupt the terms with which we interrogate those worlds. Gathering and Dispersal In the early 1990s, Zhizuo was an "administrative village" (M. cungong- suo),3 having been a "brigade" (M. dadui) before its collectively farmed land was contracted to households in 1980. Its population of about 3,000 (in 1990) was divided into about 24 production teams in two large villages and many smaller hamlets. Ninety-five percent of its residents belonged officially to the 6- million-strong Yi minority. Zhizuo residents identified themselves as Yi when traveling to market towns or cities, but within their county, and especially inside Zhizuo, most preferred to call themselves Lolop'6. Nearly everyone in Zhizuo, Lolop'6 and Han alike, spoke as their first language a local dialect of Yi they called L6lono, although most were also fluent in the Yunnan dialect of Manda- rin. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Zhizuo, like many Yi communities, engaged in an energetic revitalization of ritual practices used to heal, bury the dead and nourish ancestors, and encourage the fertility of crops, livestock, and people. While these rituals were extremely varied, Zhizuo residents understood them all to conform to certain principles that revealed a broad, shared attitude toward representations of human forms and toward reference in general. People in Zhizuo called all formal ceremonies concerning nonhuman enti- ties like ancestors, ghosts, and spirits that bring illness or fertility nepi. A ne is a ghost, spirit, or ancestor; pi is both to offer up and to speak formally; nepi is to offer speech and gifts to ghosts, spirits, or ancestors. All nepi involved con- structing effigies (negu) for ne and offering them gifts of speech, food, and</page><page sequence="5">A CARCERAL REGIME IN SOUTHWEST CHINA 171 drink. The procedures for assembling such effigies out of natural objects like pine branches, grass, bamboo, and vines, and household objects like cloth, clothing, baskets, and string were an important aspect of the knowledge that made one a ritual specialist (dpip'o), an expert in nepi. Most such effigies con- tained reference to aspects or fragments of human bodies. The simplest were sin- gle pine branches carved with rudimentary eyes and ears. Some had painted faces; others were dressed in layers of silk and cotton clothing; some were wrapped like corpses in hemp and cotton cloth. In general, effigies were in- tended to gather and fix the vague or dispersed being of a ne into a concrete form that could be spoken to and exchanged with. The most striking feature of ritual effigies was their impermanence: all were intended immediately or eventually to disintegrate. At the end of a ritual, effigies for minor entities were cast onto the paths, where the passage of feet kicked them into pieces. Others, for more powerful or dangerous beings, were ritually burned. Even effigies in which ancestral souls resided (which might be compared to "ancestral tablets") were ritually made to disintegrate after several generations. Apart from the special case of tombstones,4 Lolop'6 in Zhizuo made no representations of ghosts, spirits, or ancestors that were intended to en- dure. Moreover, apart from the occasional exercises of schoolchildren, they cre- ated no other representations of the human form. Embroidery was the only tra- dition of representational art in which many in Zhizuo ever became skilled, and embroidery took flowers and birds as its subjects, never human faces or bodies. A telling complaint of the young Red Guards who in 1966 brought to Zhizuo the Cultural Revolutionary campaign to destroy the "old customs, old habits, old culture, and old thinking of the ruling classes" was that there was little material evidence of these "Four Olds" to destroy-no drawings, paintings, statues, carv- ings, inscriptions, or memorials. A clue to the significance of this aversion to creating enduring repre- sentations of human or humanlike forms, even when representing ghosts, spirits or ancestors, can be found in stories about this general prohibition being broken. Souls and Statues Zhizuo residents tell one such story about a man of humble origins who married into their community from a nearby mountain hamlet early in the 20th century. It was an uxorilocal marriage, upon which he adopted his wife's par- ents' surname of Su. Ambitious and energetic, Su Chen learned to speak Chi- nese from passing merchants, and was eventually appointed the leader (M. baozhang) of the community self-policing organization (M. baojia) that admin- istrated and taxed Zhizuo's villages. At the height of his influence, he began a campaign to shed his Lolop'6 identity and establish himself and his descendants as Han. To this end he built a tiny, round Buddhist shrine on a ridge just below Zhizuo's central valley. It housed three wooden statues, representing Yaoshi Laoye, the fearsome king of the underworld; Guanyin Laomu, a goddess of fer- tility; and Guanfu Laoye, probably a version of the deified military hero Guan Yu. Su Chen paid for a youth from one of Zhizuo's established Han families to</page><page sequence="6">172 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY study Buddhism and maintained him as a "monk" in this shrine. Yearly rites for Guanyin Laomu at the temple became an important means for Zhizuo's tiny Han minority (about five percent of the population) to distinguish themselves from their Lolop'6 neighbors. Most Lolop'6 avoided the temple. Its painted wooden statues, they said, were likely to trap and imprison the souls of those who hap- pened upon them, especially souls that could easily be detached from their bear- ers-those of children, the elderly, and the ill. Some, however, could not resist the shrine's mysterious allure, and ritual specialists developed a technique to treat those who visited the shrine and found their souls trapped there, also useful in cases of souls trapped by other, more distant temple statues. During the Land Reform movement in 1953, Lolop'6 classed as "poor peasants" burned the temple down. But the ruins remained dangerous-perhaps even more so than the temple had been. One villager, Li Haiyong, told me of wan- dering into the burnt temple in 1956 as he was herding his goats on the nearby moun- tain slopes: When I came home, I was so sick. I had a terrible headache. My mother tried every kind of medicine on me, but nothing worked. So we went to a diviner, and she said that the temple had trapped my soul. Of course it had already been burned down, but sometimes the statue ghost (puwn) returns, and if you encounter it, it will take your soul to keep and play with. Li Haiyong's mother made an effigy of pine trees, paper, and incense sticks; offered it wine, tea, and a whole boiled chicken; and spoke to it in Mandarin, appealing to it to release her son's soul. After she repeated this ritual several times, Li Haiyong recovered. Those who dealt frequently with this problem noted that in addition to headaches, people whose souls were trapped by statues or temple ruins often found that their feet hurt viciously. Many spoke confus- edly, and in Mandarin rather than Lolono. In later years, these were especially common symptoms among Zhizuo residents who had been local cadres during the Cultural Revolution, or who had participated as Red Guards in activities to destroy the material effects of old customs, culture, habits, or thinking.5 Such people had frequently insulted or harmed temple statues and found themselves trapped and tortured instead. Some never managed to retrieve their souls despite frequent recourse to the technique Li Haiyong's mother used on her son. Salt, Preservation, Incarceration As enduring representations of human forms, then, temple statues were thought to have the capacity to make people ill by capturing and immobilizing their souls. In every nepi, ritual specialists made negative reference to such en- during representations by making certain the effigies they created of ghosts, spirits, and ancestors would not endure. Yet every nepi also indirectly alluded to the preservation of corporeal forms in another way, in the use of salt. Salt was a dear commodity of extraordinary importance to Zhizuo residents before poli- cies of the socialist government made it cheap and plentiful. Its ubiquitous use</page><page sequence="7">A CARCERAL REGIME IN SOUTHWEST CHINA 173 in ritual associated enduring representations of human forms with state violence, es- pecially the capacity of the state to imprison bodies as statues imprisoned souls. Every ritual specialist in Zhizuo owned a tiny bamboo box full of unhusked grain topped with a thumb-sized cake of salt. The first offering to any n&amp; was a few grains and a pinch of salt from this box, sprinkled over the effigy. When I asked Li Xinghai, who had been performing nepi for almost 60 years, about this offering, he responded with a story of the discovery of salt brine at Baijing (White Well), one of Yunnan's three most important salt production sites, about 50 kilometers away.6 Li Xinghai had been one of many youths from Zhizuo who, during the late Qing and the Republic, had walked to the Baijing brine wells to find work as porters. The thumb-sized salt cakes he and other ritual specialists carried around were miniature versions of large, molded cakes men from Zhizuo had once hauled from Baijing over the rocky paths toward the lowlands. The salt trade, regulated and taxed by the state salt administration, was an extremely important source of state revenue and the target of rebels, bandits, smugglers, and revolutionaries. "Of all the sources of mischief in Yunnan," one Qing bureaucrat put it, "there is none surpassing salt" (Li 1831:4b). Describing how salt in Baijing came under control of the salt administration, Li Xinghai's story made a vivid connection between the state's capacity to shape social mem- ory through commemoration and its power to incarcerate: Long ago, no one really knows when, there was a place at Baijing called R5l6h6. An old man herded white sheep there. One of his old rams often disappeared for a few days at a time and returned alone. It was fatter than all the others. The old man was puzzled, and he decided to search for the reason this old ram disappeared. He tied a bell to it, and when it ran off he followed the sound of the bell to the place where they now mine salt. He saw that the ram was drinking water from a spring. The old man drank the water and found that it had a strange, pleasant taste. He thought, well, perhaps this water is the reason this ram is fatter than the others. I'll carry some of this water home and boil my food in it. He liked the way his food tasted, so he often returned to take water from that place. All the others in his village did the same. This was before that place was called Ts'6k'a [Salt Mine]. After a while, a government official heard about the strange, pleasant taste of the water there. He took some of the water and boiled his vegetables, then boiled the water away. Salt appeared at the bottom of the pot. After that, they made wells and stoves there and began to produce salt. The salt officials decided to reward the person who made this discovery. The reward was to make him king of the salt officials, the god [ne] of that place. They gave the old man a great feast and made speeches congratulating him. Then they killed an ox, wrapped the hide around him, and stood him up in the sun. As the hide dried, it compressed and preserved him. They made offerings to him, standing there. He was later washed away by a flood, but they built a statue of him, wearing a goatskin vest [marking him as Lolop'6] and wrapped in an ox-hide. In Yunnan, in contrast to most of China, the mischief of salt was concen- trated at brine well sites like Baijing. In most locations, the late Qing and Repub- lican states raised salt revenues with a variety of syndicate and ticketing sys- tems, designed to regulate and tax the merchants who transported and sold salt. These systems focused state efforts to create salt revenue on transport and distribution,</page><page sequence="8">174 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY leaving salt production relatively free from state control. But in Yunnan, where production was restricted to a few small areas, salt was taxed at the production site, after which it was transported and sold freely. The Yunnan salt administra- tion enforced this system of taxation at the well site throughout the province at the beginning of the 19th century, and it remained in force through the Republic (Amstead 1970:142; Chiang 1983:204). At Baijing, salt brine was lifted from deep wells in ox-hide bags, then sold to stove households, private entrepreneurs who boiled it down in gigantic cop- per pots and molded it into large bullet-shaped cakes for transport by porter and mule over the mountain paths (Liu 1933:60-64). When the stove households sold the cakes to merchants and peddlers, the salt administration taxed the buy- ers about two ounces (M. liang) of silver for every 300 catties and issued them with tickets showing the well of the salt's origin and permitting its transport and sale (Liu 1933:87).7 As porters and sometimes salt merchants, Zhizuo residents took part in schemes to evade the salt tax by buying salt secretly from the pro- ducers and smuggling the cakes, minus their ticket of permission, to the low- lands. Those who engaged in this dangerous enterprise were always at peril of capture and punishment by the salt authorities, and punishment always included (though it was rarely limited to) incarceration. In Li Xinghai's story, the assertion of state control over the salt enterprise was memorialized in a striking act of incarceration, as the state preserved the discoverer of salt in raw ox-hide. State officials in the late Qing and the Republic were acutely aware of the advantages of creating official cults to deify and com- memorate founders and heroes (Duara 1988). Li Xinghai's story illuminates the violence of this kind of memorialization and draws an implicit contrast between it and the kind of representation involved in ritual effigies. To represent a ghost, spirit, or ancestor in an effigy is to gather its dispersed being from the world and fix it momentarily in a form with which one can exchange speech and gifts, be- fore directing its dispersal. To carve a statue of a person or god is to gather its being without intention of future dispersal. This latter form of reference was the domain of the state, as it asserted control over L6lop'6 mountain villages like R516h6. The statue of the Lolop'6 man wrapped in an ox-hide was a reminder that the state's sovereignty lay in its capacity to imprison and punish the living bodies of those who (even as innocently as the discoverer of salt) attempted to evade its exactions. When Su Chen took it upon himself to build a temple with statues, he was drawing on this privilege of the state to incarcerate humans and spirits alike. Incarceration and the Field of Judgment The statues in Su Chen's shrine thus gained the power to trap and imprison souls because the memorializing regime in which they participated was inti- mately associated with the state's capacity to imprison human bodies. Having understood this, let us turn again to stories of these statues. Though most L6lop'6 in Zhizuo found the shrine alien and dangerous, they sometimes ap- pealed to its fierce-visaged statue of Yaoshi Laoye, king of the underworld, to render judgment in serious disputes between locals and outsiders. An account I</page><page sequence="9">A CARCERAL REGIME IN SOUTHWEST CHINA 175 heard of one such dispute and its judgment and punishment follows. The speaker is Li Haiyong, whose soul was once trapped in the shrine's ruins. Li Yinghe once invited a Han man from Dayao [the nearby county town] to sleep at his house. The Han was beginning a journey, so he had money in his bag. While he was asleep, Li Yinghe stole the money. They argued. "I brought money to your house, and now it is nowhere to be seen!" "I didn't steal it!" Li Yinghe was ashamed, because he really had stolen the money. "We'll go to the temple, to Yaoshi Laoye, and ask him to kill me if I've stolen your money. He'll kill you if you are just bullying me." They went to the temple. Each wrote a petition to Yaoshi Laoye asking him to punish the other with death if he were not telling the truth. They presented these to the statue, with offerings of sticky rice and red sugar. The monk made them each draw a bamboo lot. He brought the lots to his book, and he found that Li Yinghe had stolen the money. Since he had no money, the Han man from Dayao could not continue his journey, and he had to go home. But Li Yinghe's stomach began to hurt. It hurt for five days, and he died on the fifth day. It will come as no surprise that petitioning Yaoshi Laoye to judge a quarrel had clear parallels in temporal rituals of justice.8 In the first half of the 20th cen- tury, the final temporal recourse for Zhizuo residents involved in serious quar- rels with their neighbors was to pay a literate person to write a formal petition to Zhizuo's baozhang. The latter forwarded a written report to the hereditary chieftain (M. tusi) who acted as a magistrate for the district where Zhizuo was located. After deciding to conduct a hearing, this magistrate traveled to Zhizuo, where he lodged at the house of Zhizuo's headman.9 An assistant to the headman brought in both parties to the dispute, and ordered them to kneel in the courtyard. The magistrate seated himself formally on the headman's porch four or five feet above the courtyard, from where he questioned the petitioners and delivered judgment. While similar in form, appealing to Yaoshi Laoye was quicker and less expensive than petitioning the magistrate. Many in Zhizuo believed also that justice was more certain: Yaoshi Laoye could see everything in this world from his position in the underworld, while the magistrate's scope of vision was both distinctly more limited and more easily corrupted. Li Haiyong's story of Yaoshi Laoye's judgments suggests that Lolop'6 imagined the mode of reference I have called incarceration to extend through the field of spiritual and temporal bureaucratic power. Yaoshi Laoye and the mag- istrate participated in this field in the same way. The statue of Yaoshi Laoye, an incarceration of the spirit-king of the underworld, imprisoned the souls of those who encountered it, including those executed as wrongdoers. The underworld king was imagined to send police like agents to shackle the souls of those who were about to die and escort them to the underworld. The authority of the mag- istrate, statuesque on his high seat of judgment, was similarly founded on his ca- pacity to imprison those beneath him. The district's last magistrate, Xia Hao, was remembered primarily as a jailer. In 1933 Xia Hao built a "water cell" below the guest hall of his new house. This was a small room that could be filled with water from below, with a trap door through which prisoners could be lowered.</page><page sequence="10">176 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY Xia Hao lent money to peasants at usurious interest rates, and when they could not pay he imprisoned them in this cell, letting the water rise to their knees, and starving them until their families found the money to buy them out (Wang and Liu 1989:139-140). This local strongman also worked energetically to seize young men from his district for forcible conscription into the Guomindang ar- mies. Youths were captured by temporal equivalents of Yaoshi Laoye's under- world police, men whom Zhizuo residents called "dogs' legs." These men shackled potential conscripts, led them out of the valley in chains, and impris- oned them near Xia Hao's residence until they could be transferred to the county town and beyond. In these stories, state power, congealed in resplendent, statuesque figures, perpetuates and memorializes itself as it renders its judged subjects isolated and immobile, freezing them eventually into gods or ancestors. Thus imagined, the authority of the state to fix living bodies in cells, statues, or tombstones suffuses the mode of reference in which vague or diffuse ghosts or spirits are gathered into effigies. Dispersing effigies is an attempt to render these presences fluid and relatively benign-to keep them free of the deathly carceral chain. Never- theless, as stories of quarrels judged by the underworld king suggest, this chain's links fall everywhere, weighing especially heavily in the morality of in- terpersonal disputes. Below, I wish to pursue this hint to suggest that this car- ceral mode of reference amounted to a strategy of memory (de Certeau 1986) that could cut certain persons out from the field of social relations, making them as isolated and immobile as any statue. The Ghost of Curses Late one spring morning Li Zhiwu, who practiced herbal medicine for his kin and neighbors, arrived at the door of my room exhausted and distraught. He had spent the night caring for one of his wife's maternal uncle's three sons, an 18-year-old named Qi Hong. The boy had died just before dawn. "That child could not have lived," Li Zhiwu said. Qi Hong had taken to his bed seven days before, and by the time Li Zhiwu arrived the previous afternoon his soul had al- ready departed for the underworld. "You can learn to recognize signs of this if you treat many sick people," he explained. When a patient's soul has already been shackled and led away, He goes when you tell him to go and comes when you tell him to come, but otherwise he doesn't move. He speaks only when you speak to him. The tiny hairs on his face turn grey as if ashes have settled there, and they point up instead of down. His eyelids turn blue. The more medicine you give him, the worse he gets. When you inject him, the needle comes apart from the plastic, or it breaks, and when you open the medicine bottle it shatters and the glass falls inward. Even if he had arrived earlier, Li Zhiwu said, he would not have been able to save Qi Hong. One could predict from the day and hour of his birth three criti- cal passes (M. guankou) in his life, at the ages of 5, 11, and 18. Having lived through the first two, he had no hope of surviving the third. Moreover, omens of</page><page sequence="11">A CARCERAL REGIME IN SOUTHWEST CHINA 177 death had been accumulating in his family for a year. Qi Hong's mother had found a grass snake coiled at the bottom of a basket when transplanting rice and had run across a boa constrictor on the path. A goat's shoulder blade that his fa- ther examined at a mortuary ritual confirmed these signs that a family member would die within a year. Qi Hong was his parents' youngest son, and apparently the most beloved. "He was the best of the three, really. His father loved him the best. The others are drunkards and hate hard work." When he took ill, his father considered these omens and decided not to carry him to the township hospital, 20 kilometers away, to avoid the disaster of him dying on the road. I did not know Qi Hong well, but I remembered sharing the warmth of a cigarette and a sunny courtyard with him on one of my first, lonely days in Zhizuo. He had held the cigarette between stubs that took the place of fingers on his right hand and laughed at my clumsy jokes. Remembering this, I found my- self growing hostile as Li Zhiwu spoke. "Omens are a stupid excuse for denying the boy proper medical care," I started to say, but Li Zhiwu cut me off. "Omens are only messages; they don't cause death," he said. Yet these omens were easy to believe because of an incident of several years before. An affinal kinsman had a private vegetable plot near Qi Hong's house, in a perfect location to build a house for one of the three brothers. When this relative would not trade for a more distant vegetable plot, Qi Hong's father quarreled with him. After hesitating for a year, he built a house on the plot without waiting any longer for the owner's acquiescence. The owner complained to the village government, and the quarrel grew into a nasty, protracted feud. No significant quarrel takes place merely between persons or families, Li Zhiwu went on. A dispute as serious as this one also involves a ne called a (M.) baijie zhouyan-ne, or simply a (M.) zhoushen, a spirit of curses.'0 Say you build a house on someone else's plot. That person reports you, and you quarrel with him. The zhoushen sees you quarrel, and descends on your heads, making your quarrel worse. You say words that you ordinarily wouldn't find in your mouths. When you go home, the ne follows you. From then on, every time you see the person you have quarreled with, you have a feeling of anger and hatred. So even if he doesn't say anything, you still want to fight with him every time you see him. You fight over nothing, bringing up past events. This is the baijie zhouyan-ne. Zhizuo Lolop'6 speak of "smooth discussion" (tsego) as the ideal form of verbal interaction among persons attempting to deal with a difficult situation. Reach- ing agreement and resolving difficulties in a manner that does not spark future quarrels or resentment requires all participants to speak rationally, in an even tone, neither raising their voices nor manifesting anger or other emotion. Such a discussion has a smoothness (go) of texture, which makes for smooth social relations. In Li Zhiwu's scenario, a killing dispute begins when the flow of discussion is disrupted by an ordinary quarrel. This disruption is exploited not by an internal state but by an external possibility, which inserts itself into the discussion from outside and above, further misdirecting its flow. This</page><page sequence="12">178 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY misdirected speech creates a stubborn, tangled kind of memory, in which past words and events return repeatedly to fuel the dispute. Li Zhiwu went on to describe a sort of contagion, in which the ghost of an- ger is passed from one household to another. Though his tone remained hypo- thetical, I knew that he was describing a situation his family had experienced several years before. Suppose one of your wife's good friends is always fighting with her husband, then running to your house to avoid his anger. Your home is very likely to develop a zhoushen. You find you can no longer put up with things you should endure with patience. When your wife asks you to sweep the floor, you snap at her, "Why are you acting like an official and giving me orders to do rehabilitative labor?" When she distributes the household tasks and you end up doing less work than she, you don't help her out; you say to yourself, "I'm tired, but she's a woman and used to hard work." Anger descends from without, disrupts the flow of discussion, and spreads like a contagion from one household to another. Zhizuo residents believed it the height of bad form to quarrel with anyone inside someone else's house or courtyard and made every effort to exclude angry speech from their own dwelling places. Consequently, they were extraordinarily tolerant hosts, willing to endure every kind of demand or drunken disruption from guests to avoid angry confrontation. In fierce disputes, however, they sometimes used angry speech as a weapon to bring the ghost of anger down on their enemy's household. In serious quarrels, Li Zhiwu continued, the zhoushen's involvement be- comes more complex. Like all ne, a zhoushen is never simple nor unitary; it is a partnership between the zhoushen itself and another entity, called a bune, a ghost of sleep. This ghost descends into the opening the zhoushen creates. Where a zhoushen afflicts with anger, a buwne afflicts with sleep: You quarrel and the zhoushen descends on you. Then you go home and go to bed. While you are asleep, the buIne descends and makes you keep sleeping. You don't want to wake up, you just stay in bed, ill, your legs sore and your entire body without strength. When a zhoushen spreads from a person to his household, a buwne can follow it, afflicting those not personally involved in the dispute. This, Li Zhiwu said, was probably what happened to Qi Hong. His father's quarrel brought a zhoushen into the house, opening a path for a buIne, which settled on the household's most vulnerable member, at a critical passage in his life. Qi Hong went to bed with sore legs and an exhausted body, and stayed there until his face turned the color of ashes, his eyelids went blue, and he became void of agency and desire, indicating that his soul had been incarcerated by Yaoshi Laoye's assistants and that no medicine could help him. Several days after Qi Hong's funeral, Li Zhiwu invited me to take part in a ritual intended to rid his own household of a zhoushen. Qi Hong's death had af- fected him deeply. He had trouble sleeping, and he was sometimes plagued by dreams of the boy's gray face. During the day, his legs were sore, and his body ached. He and his wife rarely quarreled, he said, but still he thought it was possible</page><page sequence="13">A CARCERAL REGIME IN SOUTHWEST CHINA 179 that the zhoushen from Qi Hong's house had followed him home. It would do no harm to hold an exorcism. It would only cost him an old chicken that he was go- ing to eat anyway, and it would be an opportunity for me to observe this tech- nique, since I was obviously interested. Qi Hong's family had asked a ritual spe- cialist to their house to perform this technique several times during his illness, Li Zhiwu now revealed, but the dispute had been very serious, and the buIne-if that is what it was-had been recalcitrant. Li Zhiwu invited Luo Jianmin, an elderly neighbor skilled at many nepi techniques, to quietly perform the exorcism in his courtyard. This ritual special- ist's first task was to construct an effigy to gather and fix zhoushen and bwne. He cut a three-forked pine branch, stripped it of needles below the fork, bound the needles with hemp thread, and tied them tips downward to the stripped part of the forked branch. Needles, like pine trees and almost every other long, thin object, have a head (wude) and a tail (mxde). When building houses or furniture, or constructing effigies for beneficial spirits such as ancestors or agricultural spirits, Lolop'6 are generally emphatic about the necessity of orienting every beam, board, or branch to match heads with heads and tails with tails. Later, when I invited Luo Jianmin for a glass of tea, he was happy to talk about this rit- ual. "The three-forked branch is for the zhoushen," he said, "and the pine nee- dles are the words of the quarrel." The pine needles are sharp, like the quarrel's sharp words, he continued, and they are bound to the branch upside down be- cause the words of a quarrel are backwards, turned against the smooth flow of discussion. Luo Jianmin also tied a thorned branch to the pine. This, he said, rep- resented the btune, which follows the zhoushen and claws the flesh with illness (see Figure 1). Luo Jianmin killed a chicken for the effigy, offered it wine and tea, and sprinkled it with salt and grain. As he made these offerings, he recited an incan- tation. Like the effigy, this chant referred to the entity that had afflicted the household as made up of harmful words. It culminated in these lines (with Man- darin words in italics): ni pi do chi ko jb. 1 su ni pi do chi ko j2 k6 yi ni shi na chi ko ja l1 su ni shr na chi ko j2 k6 yi ni pi go chi ko j D su. ni pi go chi ko j2 k6 yi kae ze chi ko j 1 su ka ze chi ko j2 k6 yi ka p6 ka ji mo shr d6 ma shr 1D ma j~ 1b su qin qi lin ju j5 16 pe ni pin plan peng you ni ga ch2 16 pe j2 k6 yi j~ su j ts' ma ts'6 su j) 13 ts'6 j. sul j. tsi ma jr su j 1) jr you curses from the sunrise return to the sunrise you curses from the north star return to the north star you curses from the sunset return to the sunset curses from the southern star return to the southern star around houses and fields death curses around fields and roads from kin, neighbors, and companions from your far offfriends return to friends and companions great official of curses the blame is yours great official of curses the wrong is yours</page><page sequence="14">180 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY zhoushen 1----ghost ofcurses bmn?e inverted pine needles curse;--- wine and tea Figure 1 Efrigy for the zhoushen and its partner the biun'e. Drawing reproduced courtesy of Sean McCabe. t / /i</page><page sequence="15">A CARCERAL REGIME IN SOUTHWEST CHINA 181 After finishing the chant and offerings, Luo Jianmin bundled up the effigy and discarded it on a path leading toward the village where Qi Hong's parents lived. This ritual, Luo Jianmin later explained, sent the zhoushen back along the path of its arrival, to plague the members of the household from which it had come. In this case, he had sent the ghost back to Qi Hong's father's house, where it had infected his client. Often, he said, one quarrel will result in several years of retaliatory rituals in which curses are sent back and forth from one household to another. One zhoushen begets another as members of an afflicted household often pick quarrels with other innocent people, who then find angry speech descending on their own heads. In consequence, some families are chronically plagued with this ghost of curses. Family members bicker endlessly among themselves and quarrel frequently with others. In other cases, the zhoushen simply will not depart, no matter how often the ritual is performed. This is when the ghost's partner, the btune, settles into the house and the livestock sicken, the chickens stop laying, illness plagues household members, and bad omens accumulate. This, Luo Jianmin continued, was the course the affliction took in Qi Hong's household before it ended in the young man's death. Abreaction, Encryption, Incarceration: An Incantation What are these "curses," these inverted needles that whiz about the land- scape pricking people into anger or immuring them in sleep? My informants often used the Lolono jj and the Mandarin zhou (as in zhoushen) interchange- ably to speak of these entities (and the former appears to be derived from the lat- ter). In general, jj. refers to words: angry speech, curses, or incantations. But here ja are strange words indeed, for they have no representational content and no richer phonetic form than the phoneme j_ itself, repeated like a drumbeat in the incantation (M. zhouyu) that sends them back to their source. In writing of incarceration I have been making implicit comparisons to other, more familiar terms used to describe the operations of memory: inscription, incorporation, and encryption. My informants' repeated evocations of j. to explain Qi Hong's death provided an opportunity to make some of these comparisons more ex- plicit-to assemble an incantation to send the term incarceration back through some of its own sources in psychoanalytic language. I shall borrow from Levi-Strauss, master of comparative method, to enun- ciate the first part of this incantation. In one of his best-read texts, "The Sorcerer and his Magic," Levi-Strauss (1963) wrote of shamanic techniques as transla- tions between two related systems of reference. He presented these systems in the context of a third referential regime: psychoanalysis. The text analyzes sev- eral ethnographic descriptions of sorcery and shamanism. In one, a Zuni boy claims to "assume the form of a cat, fill his mouth with cactus needles[!], and kill his victims-two infants, three girls, and two boys-by shooting the needles into them" (Levi-Strauss 1963:172). In another, a doubting shaman from Van- couver explains a healing technique to Franz Boas. He pretends to suck an ill- ness from his patient's body, he says, and spits it up as a bloody tuft of down. He then presents the bloody object to patient and onlookers as the "pathological</page><page sequence="16">182 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY foreign body" (1963:175). Levi-Strauss interprets these techniques as taking ad- vantage of a system of reference in which "the mind always has more meanings available than there are objects to which to relate them" (1963:184), which he calls, self-consciously, "so-called pathological thought": So-called pathological thought, on the other hand, overflows with emotional interpretations and overtones in order to supplement an otherwise deficient reality. For normal thinking there exists something which cannot be empirically verified and is, therefore, "claimable." For pathological thinking there exist experiences without object, or something "available." We might borrow from linguistics and say that so-called normal thought always suffers from a deficit of meaning, whereas so-called pathological thought (in at least some of its manifes- tations) disposes of a plethora of meaning. [1963:181] The cactus needles and the bloody tuft of down issue like words from the mouths of sorcerer and shaman, but unlike most words they are empty vehicles that impose no limits on the affects or meanings that may be attached to them. They achieve the capacity to wound or heal by taking on, in the minds of victim, patient, and onlookers, the emotions and overtones of a difficult and conflict- ridden social situation in which all, to varying extents, have found themselves embroiled. The j', or "curses," that fly about secretly from mouth to mouth among quarreling families in Zhizuo might be translated similarly as vehicles for a "plethora of meaning." To them can be attached the anger and frustration of a social conflict, otherwise so difficult to put into words, either because they overflow the available signifiers, or because the social situation prohibits them from being openly spoken. Calling the plethora of affect involved in the dispute a j' detaches it from the social relations of a household and bundles it into an imagined word/object that can be sent away. As "empty signifiers" to which almost anything can be attached, such "curses" are extracted with their weight of affect from the body of a household like a bloody tuft of down and are shot like cactus (or pine) needles toward the household from which they came. In these terms, j. or zhoushen might thus be understood to participate in a mode of reference in which an empty word/object gathers and encapsulates a plethora of unspoken or unspeakable affect arising from the tangled or inverted words of a difficult dispute. But how are we to understand this scenario when rit- ual techniques fail and it plays itself out to a fatal conclusion? In Qi Hong's case, the "curses" that accumulated in his household did not merely prick members to anger; they settled on a single member of the household, immobilizing him in his bed until his soul was shackled and led away. Levi-Strauss's claim that sor- cerer and shamanism create signifiers for "experiences without object" led him to an effort to use psychoanalytic categories in his translation. A shaman relives traumatic events in a patient's life "in their original vividness, originality and violence," Levi-Strauss claimed, in much the same way that a psychoanalytic patient abreacts by intensely reliving the trauma from which his disturbance stems. "In this sense," Levi-Strauss wrote, "the shaman is a professional abreactor" (1963:181). Levi-Strauss's abrupt evocation of this psychoanalytic category may</page><page sequence="17">A CARCERAL REGIME IN SOUTHWEST CHINA 183 strike his readers as a violent translation of a complex social phenomenon into an entirely foreign system of reference. Yet the violence cuts both ways: Levi- Strauss intends "the comparison between psychoanalysis and older and more widespread psychological therapies" to transform the former as it describes the latter (1963:183). If psychoanalysis is a system of explanatory narratives em- bedded in a specific mode of reference, Levi-Strauss implies, it may be trans- mogrified by other explanatory narratives and their modes of reference and in- terpretation even as it translates them. Ritual specialists in Zhizuo are by no means "professional abreactors," but their discourse about ghosts and spirits has aims analogous to those of psycho- analytic discourse. They seek to describe a spectral "topography" and to coordi- nate psychosocial states with the dynamics of messengers and energies that move through this topography. In this sense (and to continue this incantation), Li Zhiwu's and Luo Jianmin's accounts of the buwne killing Qi Hong might be compared to the scenario of encryption, as lucidly outlined by Abraham and Torok (1994). Encryption involves dealing with a loss or wound by incorporat- ing it within the subject and walling it off within an internal, tomblike body: Inexpressible mourning erects a secret tomb inside the subject. Reconstituted from the memories of words, scenes and affects, the objectal correlative of the loss is buried alive in the crypt as a full-fledged person, complete with its own topography. [1994:130] Qi Hong's death was preceded by a series of wounds and losses to those close to him. These included not merely the dispute over the vegetable plot but also a history of difficult and injurious relations between father and sons. "He was the best of the three, really. His father loved him the best. The others are drunkards and hate hard work," said Li Zhiwu, his sympathies with the father, his wife's maternal uncle. Qi Hong's two elder married brothers fought inces- santly with their father, even as he worked hard to support them, and Li Zhiwu believed they made his life almost unbearable. Even before Qi Hong became ill, his parents frequently asked a ritual specialist to exorcise zhoushen, in hopes of freeing their household of their elder sons' quarrels, bad temper, and drunken violence. These never worked; the angry emotions and misdirected speech that inhabited their household could not be bundled up in an effigy and sent off to their affine's household. Instead, this anger finally settled on the youngest and most beloved son in the form ofa bune. Before he died, Qi Hong's body was cut off from everything around it: the personal agency and desire that gave life to his social relations with those around him disappeared, leaving his body an empty shell-"He goes when you tell him to go and comes when you tell him to come, but otherwise he doesn't move. He will speak only when you speak to him." His body had replaced the "curses" of the zhoushen as an empty signifier that the an- gry and tangled speech that plagued his family could inhabit. It had become a crypt, a tomb, or a statue for a social wound that could not be otherwise bundled up and sent away.</page><page sequence="18">184 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY Like Levi-Strauss's comparison of shamanic techniques and abreaction, this analogy between the scenario of the brune's action and the psychoanalytic scenario of encryption distorts when stretched too far. The interpretations of those who blamed Qi Hong's illness and death on "curses" did not involve a sub- ject's loss of a desired object so much as a festering social wound within a household. These interpretations did not create a crypt in a subject but a corpse in a household. After it was taken out and buried, this corpse became a trap for the household's living souls, from which Qi Hong's anguished father's soul later had to be extracted repeatedly with further ritual techniques. In a mortuary process lasting several years, still more nepi techniques would gradually purify the dead soul of its wounds, its anger, its illness, and its death, and prepare it for rebirth. Its relations with the living would attenuate as memory faded, and it would lose the capacity to immure living souls. One might understand the entity that settled on Qi Hong as participating in a system of encryption only as this system empowers a social logic of incarceration; the individualizing psycho- analytic trope is truly useful only when distorted to cover the social subject- hood embodied in a household, with its complex relationship to the state bu- reaucracy. While the immediate cause of Qi Hong's incarceration was seen as a dispute among affinal kin, blame for this killing dispute was deferred along a chain whose ultimate source was state authority: the quarrel had grown truly in- jurious only after it was reported to the village government. As Luo Jianmin pro- pitiated the zhoushen, he switched pointedly to Mandarin, the language of gov- ernance, to refer to its "kin and neighbors" and its "far-off friends." "Great official of curses," he continued, "the blame is yours, great official of curses, the wrong is yours": the wrong of this killing quarrel was ultimately associated with the carceral state authority to which Qi Hong and his household were subject. In the story of the origins of salt, the state incarcerated a living soul in ox- hide as a memorial that encapsulated the social "mischief' that sprang out of the state's attempts to control the salt works. In their interpretations of the omens that led up to Qi Hong's death, the boy's father and his friends created a similar memorial, incarcerating in Qi Hong's body the social and domestic mischief that accompanied the father's frustrated attempts to impose his will on his affi- nes and his sons. Their stories of zhoushen and btune show how the mode of ref- erence involved in the state's authority to judge and punish reached deep into domestic power relations. As a strategy of memory, incarceration applied both to the memorializing tactics of state authority and to deeply personal quarrels within or between households. The state's power to incarcerate bodies extended to organize the morality of anger and grief, and to shape the ways in which peo- ple felt themselves wounded, immobilized, or isolated by interpersonal disputes. Cliffs and Bones The deeply personal political violence of the Cultural Revolution involved many such extensions. This violence was characterized by fluid expansion of the modes of reference that organized perceptions of state power into personal politics among kin, friends, neighbors, and colleagues. In Zhizuo, the logic of</page><page sequence="19">A CARCERAL REGIME IN SOUTHWEST CHINA 185 incarceration grew to encompass much of social life. Zhizuo residents' accounts of this period focused on nightly struggle sessions in which people hurled words like pointed weapons, wounding, binding, and imprisoning scores of victims. It was as though the ritual for the ghost of curses, in which people secretly threw killing words back toward their imagined sources, was made visible and public in a ritualized theater of blame and punishment. The stage for this theater was a low wooden platform, built in the yard of the elementary school-a central lo- cation, where Zhizuo's population had gathered in previous years for markets, executions, and mass meetings. The production company was a Revolutionary Leadership Small Group, composed with one exception entirely of locals, which took control of the brigade government in 1967, and which called the entire bri- gade together nearly every night for the next two years. The actors were re- cruited from the populace. Those to be struggled against huddled directly in front of the platform, guarded by Red Guard activists with clubs. They faced the crowd, which divided into youthful Red Guards on the far left side of the yard and "ordinary masses" in the center and on the right. In the rear, far right corer, people labeled as "landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements" huddled in a wooden enclosure, or "cow shed" (M. niupeng) for "ox demon snake spirits" (M. niugui sheshen). When a new target for struggle was needed, he or she was drawn from this cow shed. The activists and ordinary masses alike took literally Jiang Qing's widely publicized 1967 call to "attack with words, defend with arms" (Jiang 1968:53). From the stage, a session chair- man shouted questions at the struggle targets about their past activities, thoughts, and loyalties, while the club-bearing activists beat them to force re- sponse. When words hurled like inverted pine needles did not wound deeply enough, people made their curses material by hiding bamboo spikes in their fists to beat especially hated victims. At the end of the session, victims were dragged off to be shut into "cow shed" cells in the village government building, where they bled and waited for the next night's struggle. Many of those thus incarcerated remained frozen and socially isolated for years. People in Zhizuo told me a series of stories about former cadres who com- mitted suicide or died from illness after being imprisoned and beaten with bam- boo spikes. Some of these victims were said to have died in prison; others rotted immobile in their beds for years, dying finally of prolonged illness; others ex- pired in the snow, their frozen corpses found days or weeks later (Mueggler 1996). A single example will suffice to show how these recollections partici- pated in the logic of incarceration. Zhizuo's assistant Branch Party Secretary Li Dehua had been a member of the brigade's ruling elite before the Cultural Revo- lution. In the winter of 1967, he was struggled against nightly for almost two weeks, before he escaped from the cowshed. As the story was recounted to me, He just disappeared. People thought he had run back home to hide, but his family was also looking for him. Years later, after the Cultural Revolution was over, his mother had a dream; it was very clear. In the dream he told her, "Mother, I've been struggled against very fiercely, and I have no way to keep on living. I've thrown myself off a cliff, and now my body has rotted, though my bones are still</page><page sequence="20">186 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY there." He named the place and asked her to get people to pick up his bones and bring them back. He told her not to be sorry, because after his death he looked in the book of fate and found that he would have lived only a year more anyway, even if he had not committed suicide. His mother looked for his bones in that place and found them. She saw from the clothing and from a notebook he had carried that this was indeed his own body. She informed the brigade and county cadres that she was going to give her son a funeral no matter what they said. The sharpened words and bamboo spikes of his neighbors afflicted Li De- hua in the same way the ghost of curses had afflicted Qi Hong. Embroiled in a fierce conflict, Li Dehua was helpless to retaliate by sending the angry words back toward their sources. The curses settled into his body, isolating and immo- bilizing his person, as he was imprisoned in the cow shed. This incarceration ex- tended long past Li Dehua's death, his bones lying unburied at the foot of the cliff until after the "10 years of chaos" had ended. In such tales, the specific logic of incarceration articulates with a more widespread social logic that structured the social memory of Cultural Revolutionary victims throughout China. Li De- hua's long disappearance parallels that of the mad schoolteacher in Yu Hua's tale who simply vanished from his hometown for two decades. The class ene- mies who did not disappear entirely in those years often became a kind of living dead. Isolated by many of their kin and friends, made frequent victims of further struggle sessions, and assigned the hardest and most degrading labor, they ex- hibited many of the symptoms of Qi Hong, victim of the ghost of curses: "He goes when you tell him to go and comes when you tell him to come, but other- wise he doesn't move. He speaks only when you speak to him...." To isolate these victims, to render them invisible and inaudible, was to immobilize the hor- rific killing power of the disputes that had wounded them. The disappearance of Yu Hua's protagonist allowed his wife and daughter to struggle on with their lives, freed from association with this class enemy. Li Dehua's death likewise freed his family from further persecution: his suicide, the only protest against in- justice available to him, was taken to show that the struggle against him had gone too far. His unburied bones immobilized the social dispute that had killed him at the same time that they rendered inexpressible his mother's grief. The price the intimate kin and friends of these victims often paid to halt the killing force of Cultural Revolutionary struggles was in this sense the same price Qi Hong's father paid to bury the wounds and losses endured in the long history of injurious relations with his sons and affines. Cultural Revolutionary victims were made into "secret tombs," incarcerated alive with the killing words, scenes, and affects that surrounded their loss. Though framed in terms of bitterly fought interpersonal struggles, stories of these victims always betrayed the ghost of another, ultimate source of the curses that wounded or killed them. In the later years of the Cultural Revolution, the state's power to incarcerate, dispersed into interpersonal relations, was gath- ered and encrypted anew in agents of a rogue state authority. It was only after the demise of these agents, only after Mao's death and literal encryption (Wakeman 1988) and the arrest and imprisonment of his wife Jiang Qing and the "Gang of</page><page sequence="21">A CARCERAL REGIME IN SOUTHWEST CHINA 187 Four" that Zhizuo residents began openly to feel and express the grief, guilt, em- pathy, and moral confusion occasioned by the previous decade's long-incarcer- ated victims. In 1978 and 1979, families in Zhizuo held a series of funerals for those who had died during the 12 previous years and never been properly mourned. This was when Li Dehua's mother found her son's bones near the cliff of which she had dreamed and insisted on giving them a proper funeral. The families of those who had died badly-in prison, frozen in the snow, after long illness, or by suicide-held exorcisms (chenepi) to rid their homes and bodies of their ghosts. In these rituals, Zhizuo residents explicitly named the two most no- torious famous promoters and victims of the Cultural Revolution, Lin Biao and Jiang Qing, as the ultimate sources of its wounds and losses, to which, following the logic of incarceration, its ghosts were finally to return. These exorcisms were accompanied by long chants intended to send the incarcerated dead down the rivers to Beijing. "Go over there to Beijing," went the words of one such lit- urgy. "Your ghost kings live there, every day they hold meetings in Beijing, Lin Biao died in a plane crash, Jiang Qing hanged herself, the ghost king Lin Biao, go follow Lin Biao, your king is over there.... ". Conclusion Founded on the state's authority to punish, the carceral regime of reference I have traced here reached deep into interpersonal relations, especially during the Cultural Revolution when that authority was up for grabs in politics of re- venge and aggression among kin, friends, and neighbors. To illuminate this re- gime I have drawn on stories that, for the most part, seem to refer to older state formations. Yet narrated or performed in the present context of market reforms and informed by the long history of projects and campaigns with which the so- cialist state stamped itself onto the mind and body of every peasant, each story may be taken as an allegory for what is most fundamental to the present state: its imagined unity, authority, and legitimacy (Anagnost 1985, 1988). These tales suggest that, for residents of Zhizuo at least, this imagined unity is founded in the state's capacity for corporeal violence, its ability to sustain and memorialize itself, to fix itself in memory and consciousness by immobilizing and isolating human bodies. But more striking still, they hint that people in Zhizuo find the state's capacity for corporeal violence to be an essential condition of their lived world. This capacity cannot be understood as merely repressive. It is a creative force at the foundation of the most profoundly personal matters as it shapes the referential tools with which people relate to bodily and psychic illness, shape the mo- rality of interpersonal conflict, and remember or forget those who have died violently. Many of the tales and practices I have touched on here are informed by lo- cal differences, specific to highland Yi communities in the Southwest. The pref- erence for temporary effigies over permanent statues or paintings to refer to in- human anthropomorphic entities, the importance of salt as a sign for the state's penetration into marginalized regions, and highly verbalized rituals for exorcis- ing ghosts or words, though common to many highland Yi groups, are not shared by most residents of rural China. Nevertheless, for all their local particularities,</page><page sequence="22">188 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY the tales Zhizuo residents tell often resonate powerfully with less locally spe- cific stories, like that of Yu Hua's mad schoolteacher. Indeed, connections be- tween a history of state-sponsored corporeal violence and the problem of re- membering and forgetting the injuries of interpersonal disputes are omnipresent in recent narratives of the Cultural Revolution from throughout China. My sug- gestion is that we read such narratives for what they have to say about how the state, experienced as a loose agglomeration of agencies, procedures, and ideolo- gies, but imagined as a unified force, becomes a constitutive condition of pro- foundly intimate processes of the sort we habitually approach through a psycho- analytic vocabulary. Through such readings we may begin to grasp the state not merely as a collection of bureaucratic practices that impinge on people's lives from the outside, but as already active within, as one of the fundamental forces that make people into social beings. Chinese states have long been constructed and deconstructed as imagined unities in very particular ways in different com- munities and historical periods. As the media creates a China ever more inte- grated into an imagined global unity, we need more than ever local ethnogra- phies that will help us understand the particular ways such constructions shape people's innermost topographies of memory and affect.

China's ethnic identification project of the early 1950s identified as Yi a huge diversity of mostly highland peoples in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guanxi Prov- inces. While many of these peoples had long been called Yi in historical and adminis- trative texts, the Nationalities Commission adopted a different, rather obscure character, with the same pronunciation, to neutralize the derogatory connotations of the term as formerly written. The Yi were one of the most complex and diverse of all the "nation- alities" (M. minzu) produced in this project: six major subgroups were identified, speaking six mostly mutually unintelligible dialects, and using at least four different varieties of written script (Chen et al. 1984). Very significant differences in social structure continue to exist between some of these subgroups. Northern dialect groups, for instance, residing mostly in Sichuan, have neolocal marriage, highly developed patriclan systems, and a structure of strictly ranked and strictly endogamous social strata (Lin 1961), while the other dialect groups have mostly virilocal marriage, weak to nonexistent clan organization, and, in the case of the L6olop'6 of this article, practices intended to level out social and economic stratification (Mueggler in press). The 1990 census put the number of Yi at 6,572,173. Of these, about 600,000 are members of the Central dialect group, which includes the people of Zhizuo. The latter insist on the</page><page sequence="23">A CARCERAL REGIME IN SOUTHWEST CHINA 189 self-ascription Lblop'6 to differentiate themselves and the inhabitants of a few neigh- boring valleys from surrounding Central dialect speakers (whom they call Lip'6 or Mimp'6), and from other Yi groups in general. In Western writings, Yi groups most often appear as Lolo, from the derogatory Chinese term Luoluo applied to many of these peoples by their neighbors and administrators for centuries. People in Zhizuo tend to find highly insulting the suggestion that the word Lolop'6 (L6lo people) might be derived from the former derogatory designation, insisting instead that it comes from the ancient Lolono word for tiger or ox, 16. 2. The body as an inscriptive surface is now a ubiquitous trope in attempts, informed generally by Foucault (1977), to theorize the corporeal aspects of power (see especially Grosz 1994; Lingis 1984). Incorporation and encryption have also attained vogue after being resuscitated from Freud's corpus by Abraham and Torok (1986, 1994; see also Rashkin 1992). 3. Throughout this article, I use words, phrases, and chants from two different languages, in which nearly all Zhizuo residents were bilingual: Mandarin Chinese and Lolono, which may be considered a subdialect of the Central dialect of Yi, a Loloish Tibeto-Burman language (Bradley 1979; Chen et al. 1984). To distinguish these two languages, Lolono terms and chants are left unmarked, while romanized Chinese terms in their first usage are preceded by an M., except where the use of Chinese characters already makes this distinction clear. Chinese pronunciations in this region vary widely, from a local variation of Yunnan Mandarin to the standard Mandarin used in radio and television broadcasts. For the sake of clarity, however, I use the standard romanization system used in the People's Republic of China (M. pinyin) to transcribe all Chinese words and phrases. For L6olono terms and chants, I have made the following emendations of a version of the International Phonetic Alphabet employed by Ma Xueliang (1951, 1992) to record Yi languages: (1) Four aveopalatals are represented as /ch/ (voiceless aspirated), /j/ (voiced), /sh/ (voiceless fricative), and /r/ (voiced fricative). (2) Only three tones are distinguished: high-level and midhigh rising tones are marked with an acute accent, low falling tones with a grave accent, and midlevel and midhigh level tones are unmarked. (3) Underlining indicates laryngalization. 4. Yi groups in Dayao and Yongren counties (L6olop'6 and Lip'6) adopted the practices of burying their dead and setting up tombstones around 300 years ago. Before that, Lolop'6 in Zhizuo cremated their dead, burying their ashes and marking the burial with a pair of small stones, which would eventually be buried or kicked away by the passing feet of livestock and people. When carving and setting up tombstones, L6olop'6 do treat them like bodies or corpses, dressing them in silk clothing to be carried to the grave site. Once they are in place, however, tombstones are more often compared to doors; they become the front doors of the tomb/houses in which the dead reside. 5. Both the high-school students who became Red Guards and the adults who became brigade officials as a result of the turmoil were almost entirely Zhizuo residents, farmers of "poor peasant" or "agricultural laborer" backgrounds. 6. Baijing is in the present township of Yanfeng in Dayao County. 7. A liang was about 50 grams. A catty was 10 liang, or about half a kilogram. 8. See Ahern 1981, Feuchtwang 1992, and Wolf 1974 for an introduction to the "Imperial metaphor," in which Chinese folk religion drew parallels between hierarchies of gods and of officials. 9. See Mueggler in press for a description of Zhizuo's rotating headmanship system.</page><page sequence="24">190 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY 10. The hybrid etymology of names given to the ghost of curses indicates the complex nature of the disputes in which this entity is invoked. The first name for the ghost joins a Yunnan dialect phrase, baijie zhouyan (a formulation that speakers of more formal Mandarin find very strange) to the Lolono ne. Zhoushen is a Mandarin word. And ritual specialists subdivide this entity further into a zhoushen and a bwne, a Lolono word. They give the zhoushen aspect of the ghost an ethnic character by binding incense to its effigy (see Figure 1), an offering reserved for entities believed to be ethnically Han. In propitiating the zhoushen, Luo Jianmin reinforced the impression of its Han character with the selective use of Mandarin to describe its "kin and neighbors" and its "far-off friends." While the immediate source of a zhoushen is one's own neighbors or kin, every killing dispute has as well a further, ultimate source, identified with Han outsiders, and especially the ethnically Han "great officials," embedded in the state bureaucracy, to which curses must finally return. 11.
