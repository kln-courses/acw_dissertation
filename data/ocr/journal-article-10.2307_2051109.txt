<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pattern in the, Imagery of Jivanananda Das MARY M. LAGO AND TARUN GUPTA FEW contemporary poets writing in Bengali are more widely read than is Jivana- nanda Das. He is considered in many respects the most modern of Bengali poets, as well as the one most independent of the influence of Rabindranath Tagore. His orginality has even been considered eccentric, but another leading Bengali poet, Buddhadeva Bose, says this of him: "He is important because he has brought a new note to our poetry, a new tone of feeling, and has tuned our ears to a subtle melody drawn from apparently conventional patterns of verse, for, despite the metrical seductions of modern Bengali, he has confined himself throughout to a single metrical norm, and that the oldest. It is rather remarkable that, though metrically a hermit, he has yielded to the prose poem and made it as haunting as his verse."1 For two reasons many Western readers who are interested in Indian literature have lacked an opportunity to study seriously the work of Jivanananda Das. First, only occasional translations of isolated poems have been available in the West. Sec- ond, the Bengali literary scene was dominated for so many years by the genius of Rabindranath Tagore that some Western readers have tended to forget that other Bengali poets, inspired and instructed by an ancient Bengali poetic tradition as well as by Tagore's example, flourished during and since his lifetime. We propose to present here our English translations of several representative poems by Jivanananda Das, to examine the characteristic pattern followed by his use of certain key images, and to indicate the extent to which an awareness of this pattern opens the way to an understanding of his work. In our translations we have attempted to remain as faithful as possible to the sense of the original text.2 His Bengali poems include much internal rhyme and assonance; we have sacrificed these elements whenever such a choice seemed justified by the need for giving precedence to meaning and tone. Jivanananda Das was born in Barisal in East Bengal in I899 and spent his child- hood in rural surroundings. His father was opposed to his son's attending school at Mary M.

LAGO AND TARUN GUPTA an early age; Jivanananda received his first instruction from his mother at home. He grew up listening to daily readings from the Upanishads, folk and religious songs, and folk tales. He learned the names of trees, flowers, and birds which became specific and recurring motifs in his poems. His formal education began at Barisal but was completed at the University of Calcutta, from which he received a Master's Degree in English Literature. His career as a teacher began at Calcutta City College in I922, and in I935 he returned to Bar- isal where he taught until I948. His first published work appeared in the Bengali journal, kavita ["Poetry"], which was founded in I935 by its editor, Buddhadeva Bose. Jivanananda Das continued to write until his tragic death in a streetcar accident in Calcutta in I954. The Sahitya Akademi, the Indian national academy of letters, gave its highest award posthumously to his sreshtha kavita ["Selected Poems"]. A casual reading of the poems of Jivanananda Das tends first to convey impres- sions of a shadowy dream-world. Poet and reader seem perpetually separated by a haze. Even when the sunlight in these poems is pungent or the moonlight clear, they shine through a veil of time moving or removed. The poet himself seems to stay in the shadows, a dream-figure just beyond reality. When he speaks directly, he often addresses someone or something which can be grasped by the reader's imagination but eludes his sense of reality: an anthropomorphic moon, a metaphorical cat, an imaginary woman. The reader may permit himself to drift on this surrealistic sur- face, feeling obliged at intervals to shake himself and check his bearings, but unless he looks into the depths he will remain unaware of the stronger currents flowing underneath. When Jivanananda's outlook and imagery are examined more closely, it becomes evident that he himself is by no means a dream-figure but a real man with a firm grasp upon the verities of life. The haziness which seems to surround him and his work is produced by his concept of time and by his method of presenting this con- cept, for he filters both time past and time present through the senses: first, his own, then, the reader's. This individualized orientation in time and this sensual, personal approach intensify the poet's perception of time other than the present, yet prevent his living wholly in the past. Jivanananda Das may be described as a detached observer always in touch with the world. Two short poems define his position, for they show a balance of values basic to his attitude toward life; this attitude determines, as we shall discover, the pattern of his imagery. Both poems show that he viewed this world as a continuing, not a fading one. He saw death and despair counterbalanced by an insistence upon essential beauty and order. Separation and regret are balanced by eventual domina- tion by the "command of the heart." prithibilok ["The Universe"]3 Far and near, ceaselessly, cities, homes are broken; There is sound of villages falling; Men have spent time enough on this earth, Their shadows on the wall still 3 Jivanananda Das, sreshtha kavitd ["Selected Poems"] (Calcutta: Navana, 1954), p. 86.</page><page sequence="3">PATTERN IN THE IMAGERY OF JIVANANANDA DAS 639 Appear as confusion, Injury, death, fear. Now there is nothing on the shores of time Except this emptiness. Still, around the endless desert Of frustrated man's fatigue, mistakes, anxiety, resolve, Is a land refreshed by the sounds of a strange forest: This world, this love, knowledge, and this command of the heart. Until the last four lines, this appears to be a standard poetic expression of despair over the self-destructive tendencies of a civilization. At the word "Still," the attention is arrested and held, then led on to the redeeming promise of the final lines. When we enter the "strange forest," we have entered the real world of Jivanananda Das. We dis- cover that he bases his faith upon the sensual wonders of this world; these include knowledge, and among these wonders "this command of the heart" is paramount. It equips him with a means of living in the present world with senses alive to things which are past and gone. Even when he speaks of the past in termns of death, this death is not a complete waste, a nothingness. As in the following poem which is airy but not unconcerned, wry but not bitter, death is viewed as something fitting, or- derly, and acceptable. o. ke. ["O. K."]4 A rebel once loved his gold and silver; A merchant once committed suicide lusting for future life; A lover once loved his lady; Still, the lady enjoyed the distress of ten other fools. Laying their hands on their hearts All performed their assigned tasks. Now all lie beneath the earth at last. Silent by order of someone else. That order is not the diurnal motion of the earth; The sun in its normal aspect Is not that order-no one escapes this rule: Everything: O.K. Rabindranath Tagore described Jivanananda Das's poetry as chitrarupmay, filled with picturesque imagery. If any single poem can be said to evoke the memory and essence of his imagery, it is the title poem of the volume banalatd sen. Banalata Sen is a woman's name; Natore, where the poem places her, is a remote rural district in Bengal. The poet describes seeing her there after he has circled the earth innumer- able times during thousands of years. His journey has encompassed the reign of the Emperor Bimbishar, who ruled during the lifetime of the Buddha, and that of Ashok, who lived two centuries later. The wanderer has visited vanished cities like Vidarbha and Vidisha, and after all his journeying his only moment of peace in any age was given by Banalata Sen of Natore. Her name indicates that she is a con- temporary woman, but her description in terms of forgotten classical locations makes 4sreshtha kavita, p. 87. This poem is one of a group titled manokanikd ["Thought Fragments"].</page><page sequence="4">640 MARY M. LAGO AND TARUN GUPTA it plain that she is timeless. Past and present are characteristically interwoven by the progressive patterns of the imagery. banalati sen5 For thousands of years I have walked the roads of the world, In midnight dark I have wandered circling from the Ceylon sea To the Malay ocean; I was present in the hazy world Of Bimbishar and Ashok; even beyond, in darkness in the city Vidarbha; I am a weary, solitary soul, life's seething ocean surrounds me; I was given a moment's peace by Banalata Sen of Natore. Her hair is the long-gone night of Vidisha, Her face the artistry of Sravasti; when the helm breaks On the far reaches of the sea, the sailor who has lost his way Sights the land of green grass among the cinnamon islands. I was like him-I saw her in the dark; she said, "Where have you been so long?" And raised her eyes like the nest of birds, Banalata Sen of Natore. At the long day's end evening comes Like the sound of dew; the kite erases the smell of sunlight from its wings. When all earthly colors are extinguished, the manuscript prepares For tales which glimmer with firefly colors; All birds go home-all rivers-all this life's business ends; Only darkness remains, and being face to face with Banalata Sen. This poem makes comprehensive use of four key images which occur repeatedly in many poems by Jivanananda Das: darkness, the passage of time, moving water, and a woman. (In this poem the woman is Banalata Sen, but she is everywhere rep- resentative of the human fulfillment personified by other women in his other poems.) The progressive development of the images throughout this poem, and the direction in which they move, illustrate the basic pattern of the imagery of Jivanananda Das: he uses the same images repeatedly, turning and molding them and always directing them from remoteness to intimacy, from dimness to distinctness, from separation to union. This "turning and molding" of images may be traced from verse to verse of banalata sen. In the first verse four images appear in this order: first, the ageless wanderer who has been walking through the centuries; second, the darkness which intensifies the aimlessness of the search; third, the "hazy world" of vanished classi- cal kings and kingdoms, suggesting the temporal nature of man's most exalted achievements; fourth, Banalata Sen herself in remote Natore, who bestows the moment of peace which is more desirable than the pomp of the classical cities and the lure of adventure. In the second verse we have the same four images, now undergoing a meta- morphosis: the aimless "midnight dark" on the ocean and the dead darkness of Vidarbha have become the beautiful dark hair of Banalata Sen; the ageless wanderer has become the sailor who, after many mishaps, arrives like Ulysses at a green shore; 5 Jivanananda Das, banalatJ sen [Banalatd Sen] (Calcutta: Signet Press, 1942), p. 9.</page><page sequence="5">PATTERN IN THE IMAGERY OF JIVANANANDA DAS 641 the "land of green grass among the cinnamon islands" is substituted for ancient cities as a symbol of life and regeneration; the eyes of Banalata Sen, "like the nest of birds," introduce associations of love and warmth and woman's creative gift. In the third verse, the wandering, the pathless ocean, and the glories of ancient times are replaced by the everyday beauties of the living world: the evening falling as quietly as the dew, the kite ushering in the night, bedtime stories, homing birds and rivers, and the end of the day's work. If we now turn back and trace the development of the four key images mentioned earlier, we see that between the beginning and the end of the poem, these, in their wider range, have been turned from remoteness to intimacy, from disorder to order. The darkness of the classical cities is the oblivion of death. After assuming the living richness of the woman's hair, darkness becomes the setting for fulfillment at the end of the journey. At the close of the third verse, darkness is filled with peace and security; Banalata Sen and this darkness have become one. Time stands still, a seemingly impassable barrier, in the first verse; the wanderer is hemmed in by the centuries. In the second verse he has broken through the barrier and glimpses the present, and in the third he enters the everyday world. The water of the first verse, the ocean, is threatening because it is unknown. In the second, the perilous ocean has broken the helm but has also brought the sailor to shore. In the third verse the ocean has become a river, safely enclosed between banks and returning home, like the birds, at dusk. Banalata Sen herself is at first an insignificant figure, but she is the only living being among the trackless oceans, dead emperors, and lost cities. In the second verse she is revealed by her hair, her face, and the warmth of her question. To the poet, who has been as directionless as the lost sailor, she represents homecoming. Her very name suggests concepts of return and rest, for ban is a forest, and lata is a tendril or creeper. The forest is the triumphant symbol of growth and regeneration upon the land, man's native element to which he returns with confidence after venturing abroad. Vines and creepers embrace the trees and link them with the earth and with one another, as love links human beings. Thus Banalata Sen embodies the supreme "command of the heart." All of these key images have been completely molded and have arrived at their intended destination. The poem ends, as it began, in darkness, but outer darkness is now the darkness of warmth and security. This passage from exclusion to inclusion is a passage from hopelessness to a reason for hoping; it is fundamental philosophy as well as imagistic pattern. Other imagery, drawn from the poet's early and later years in rural Bengal, fol- lows this same basic pattern. Living things crowd these poems: the wild geese, the owl on the branch at dusk, the stubbled field after the harvest. In buno hansh ["The Wild Geese"], we again find darkness, the preoccupation with the passage of time, and the woman with a beautiful name who may or not be an actual person-this time it is Arunima Sanyal-but all are perceived simultaneously through the senses of a living being. This darkness is filled with stars whose cold remoteness is balanced by the lingering smell of the geese, which is a sensual perception of warmth and earthiness, and by the connotations of the woman's name. Again the name empha- sizes the pattern followed by the imagery, for arun is the dawn and arunima is a dif- fused reddish glow. Thus her name recalls the beginnings of the day, of life and</page><page sequence="6">642 MARY M. LAGO AND TARUN GUPTA memory, of love and warmth. Amid the sombre surroundings of a colorless earth and an impersonal sky, she promises the renewal and continuation of life. buno, hdash ["The Wild Geese"]6 The owl's gray wings fly toward the stars- Leaving the sodden field at the summons of the moon. The wild geese with wings spread-I hear their rustling sound: One-two-three-four-innumerable-endless- The swift beating of their wings at the edge of night Like the sound of an engine; speeding-they speed away. Then the vast sky of stars remains, The smell of their bodies-a pair of imaginary geese; Arunima Sanyal of the village-I recall her forgotten face; Let them fly, let them fly quietly in the winter moonlight. All the imaginary geese-after all the sounds and colors of the earth have been erased- Let them fly, let them fly into the silent moonlight of the heart. In many poems by Jivanananda Das, the empty field following the harvest stands for the passing of time, the mutation of human relationships, and death. In the poem, dhan kdta hoye gechhe ["The Harvest Is Over"], death is present in the scattered straw, the broken eggs, the cold nest, the lost love. Yet, as in buno haiish, death is linked to life, and emptiness is linked to fulfillment. The dead lie under a coverlet of living grass. The grasshopper, like the lingering smell of the geese, inspires con fidence that life will go on. These soften the heartache which produced the "dark taste of questioning," just as the "winter moonlight" was warmed by its designation as "moonlight of the heart." dhan kdta hoye gechhe ["The Harvest Is Over"]7 I do not know when the harvest was over-straw scattered on the fields, Bits of chaff, broken eggs, the snake's shed skin, the cold nest. Over there beyond all this, in the field A few familiar people are asleep, how profoundly. Over there someone sleeps-I saw her often day and night, How often I hurt her in games of love: Still there is peace: the deep green grass and the grasshopper Now cover her thoughts and the dark taste of questioning. As a poet of the urban scene, Jivanananda Das makes similar use of his key images. path hdatd ["Walking the Streets"] has a familiar aura. The trams and buses leave the streets at the appointed hour and go to the world of sleep. The gaslight, 6 banalatd sen, p. 17. 7 banalatd sen, p. 37.</page><page sequence="7">PATTERN IN THE IMAGERY OF JIVANANANDA DlAS 643 the buildings and signboards, all feel the need to sleep beneath the sky. Again we have the wanderer through time. Reversing the direction of the wanderer of banalatd sen, he travels from the present to the past. He himself is the link between the two; by the touch of his imagination, by his sense of continuity in history, he reflects the warmth of the present upon the vanished ages. path hdi5t ["Walking the Streets"] 8 Many a time as if recalling forgotten beckonings I have walked alone the streets of this city; I have seen Trams and buses running on time; Then leaving the streets they depart peacefully for their world of sleep. All night long the gaslight, understanding its duty, burns well. No one makes a mistake-bricks houses signboards windows doors roofs all Feel the need to fall quietly asleep under the sky. Walking alone in the streets I have felt their deep peace in my heart; Then it was late at night-then many a star had quietly come to surround the tips of monuments and minarets; I wonder, have I ever seen anything More simple, more plausible: a host of stars and monument-filled Calcutta? I lower my eyes-silently the cheroot burns--dust and straw in the air; I shut my eyes and move aside-many almond-brown worn-out leaves Have blown away; in the same way, alone in Babylon I have walked into the night For some reason; after thousands of crowded years I still do not know why. beril ["The Cat"] is a famous poem which demonstrates Jivanananda Das's abil- ity to compress many sensations within a single metaphor. The metaphor of the cat as the passage of time is unfolded through one sensual image after another: the per- ception of light and shade, colors arranged on a scale from white through saffron and the flame-red of the krishnachura tree to almond-brown, the taste of fish, the implied hum of the bee, the tactile sensations of stroking, catching and throwing. berdl ["The Cat"]9 All day long wherever I go I meet a cat: In the shade of the trees, in the sunlight, in the crowd of almond-colored leaves Sometimes after success with a few fish bones, Sometimes inside the skeleton of the white earth, I see it absorbed in its self like a bee; And then again I see it clawing on the krishnachura tree; All day long it treads on the heels of the sun. Now I see it, Now it has vanished. On autumn evenings I watched it play, Stroking with white paws the gentle body of the saffron-colored sun; Then it caught the darkness in its paws like little balls, Scattering it over the entire world. 8 banalati sen, p. 47. 9 banalatJ sen, p. 24.</page><page sequence="8">644 MARY M. LAGO AND TARUN GUPTA This cat is the very image of time, detached, concentrated upon itself, heedless of the beings whose lives it regulates, treading "on the heels of the sun" until it ushers in the dark. It represents not only the end of the day, but the end of life when death, unconcerned, takes its toll. This cat would leave us in the chill which follows a tropical sunset, were the poem not moving from remoteness to intimacy, for this darkness is again different. Having been made tangible and turned into a toy, it is disarmed and no longer ominous. shandha hay ["Evening Comes"] is a more direct representation of the end of the day. It is a picture painted with a few precise strokes of the brush. The imagery is simpler; it is also more inclusive, for the stillness at sundown seems concentrated in the single starling. It is the end of the day and the end of the harvest, times of in-gathering for both man and nature. Time itself is gathered in, past and present together, but the inclusiveness of the second verse's imagery gives predominance to the reality of the present. The first four lines deal with conclusions; the last four deal with continuation. shandhd hay ["Evening Comes"]10 Evening comes-peaceful silence all around; Quietly one starling flies off with straw in its mouth, Oxcarts move slowly on country roads, The courtyard is full of thick-heaped golden hay. All the doves in the world call from the hijal forest; All the beauty in the world is upon the grass; All the love in the world is between us; The sky is spread as peace from horizon to horizon. Precision and simplicity are further refined in kamaldlebu ["An Orange"]. By means of one rhetorical question and its reply in the form of a wish, the poet conveys as much sense of the passing of time as was given by all his more elaborate imagery of the journey of the soul through classical times. The poignancy of the poem lies in the sacrifice which it represents: the returning is to occur in the form of something humble and comforting to another person. Again the imagery is turned from re- moteness to intimacy, from hopelessness to a reason for hoping, kamaldlebu ["An Orange"]" When once I leave this body Won't I return again to earth? May I return On a winter night As tender meat of one chilled orange Beside the deathbed of a friend. The poetic world of Jivanananda Das is thus shown as a unique world, self- contained and contemplative, suffused by an air of gentle introspection, and peopled by twilight creatures. It does not aspire to epic proportions; it issues no militant propaganda. But this "land refreshed by the sounds of a strange forest" is always very real, for it maintains a link with the land of the prosaic; this link is Nature, whose presentation is unmistakably stamped with the individualism of Jivanananda Das. 10 sreshtha kavita, p. 52. 11 banalatti sen, p. 28.</page></plain_text>
