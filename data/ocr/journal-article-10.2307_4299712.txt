<plain_text><page sequence="1">STANDING STONES IN THE ATREK REGION: THE HALAT NABI CEMETERY By David Stronach The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the singular standing stones that are located on and near the tallest peak within the Gokcheh Dagh in north-eastern Iran (Pl. Ia). The summit in question rises to almost 2,700 feet (810 m.) and stands approximately 70 km. north-east of Gunbad-i Qabfis. This considerable peak is also marked by a domed imdmzdde built in honour of Halat Nabi ibn Sinan (Pl. Ib) and the whole vicinity of the shrine may be said to share this name at the present time.' While this remote site appears not to have been described in any contemporary scholarly publication, it is very possibly mentioned, however indirectly, in James Fraser's A Winter's Journeyfrom Constantinople to Tehran, published in 1838. In the course of a description of Turcoman burial customs Fraser alludes to " the ancient burying ground of the [Goklan] tribe " situated " upon the banks of the Attruck ".2 Above all, Fraser reports on the great determination of the people to convey their dead- notwithstanding the perils of a journey of two or three days' duration through hostile territory-to this traditional place of burial.3 Whether or not, therefore, the burial ground of Hdlat Nabi should be the one cited by Fraser-and both the position of-the cemetery above the valley of the Atrek and its present unique repute among the Turcoman would seem to support such a possibility-we at least gain a convincing picture of the fierce devotion that must have helped to keep such an ancestral site in continuous use over a substantial period of time. The more than 600 stones of the HIlat Nabi cemetery are found in several distinct locations. A number of stones lie in or near the central saddle of the mountain (Pl. Ia), others occupy the eastern slope of the eastern peak and perhaps half the total number are scattered over a single relatively flat area which may be referred to for lack of a better term as the " High Plateau " (Pl. Ic). South and south-east of the High Plateau (which itself lies south-east of the east peak), various small groups of stones surmount a number of ridges and hillocks (Pl. IIa) and, at some distance from all the other monuments, yet another significant group of perhaps 150 stones can be seen to be distributed over a wide area on the south side of the mountain.4 The standing stones from the cemetery fall into two principal classes. The stones of Type 1, the taller variety, have a straight, circular-sectioned shaft with a sometimes tapered, cap-like finial (Pls. IIb, d and IVa). The lengths of such shafts vary from c. 1 m. to an estimated 5 m. (The visible heights of those that remain planted in the ground range from close to 60 cm. to just over 4 m.) Stones of this kind often exhibit one horizontal rib at or near the base of the finial, plus either one rib (Pl. IIa), or two close-set ribs (Pl. IVa), or even two pairs of close-set ribs (P1. IIc) disposed along the length of the shaft. In at least one case, we also find evidence for a more elaborate finial with a ribbed or pleated surface. Here the parallel vertical lines on the upper part of the finial can be seen to change to diagonal lines where they pass over a lower expanded band (Pl. IVd). The second, usually shorter type of stone (Type 2) is one that is characterized by a rectangular section and by two opposed high-set lobes (Pls. IIa and III). In most cases a small, square or rounded projection also emerges between and above the two lobes. The lobes as such are either (in one unique case) pierced (P1. IIIe), solid (P1. IIId) or, again in one instance only, complemented by a representation of a human figure in low relief(Pl. IIIa). As far as it is possible to interpret these monuments, it seems probable that we are dealing with highly stylized representations of people.5 Where the stones of Type I are concerned it is probable that each example represents a male personage who is still " portrayed " with his headgear, be this a cap, helmet or in one case (P1. IVd) a turban. There is less doubt, of course, about the anthropomorphic quality of the stones of Type 2; here, as two separate carved stones suggest (Pls. IIIa and e), the original 147</page><page sequence="2">148 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES model-however unusual such a model may be-is that of a human figure with its arms akimbo. It should be added that, although these last stones tend to be small in size, none shows any trait that is necessarily female: even the small figure in low relief (Pl. IIIa) should be interpreted as a man clad in a Qdijar coat.6 The detailed distribution of the stones offers no clear pattern. Stones of Types 1 and 2 frequently stand close together: only in one instance, on the top of the hillock shown in PI. IIa, do we find an exclusive cluster of stones of Type 2. It is striking, moreover, that even the largest memorials appear to have been erected in a random manner. They seldom occupy either a prominent topographical position or a " reserved " space of any great size. For one reason or another, no bones are in evidence. This may stem from the fact that the cemetery has not been in use for two or three generations or, more particularly, from the fact that this still- hallowed location remains essentially free of disturbance. There is a further possibility, even if it should be no more than a possibility, that some stones represent cenotaphs rather than grave markers. With reference to immediate parallels, I know of no other site in Iran which has produced stones of Type 1. Almost the only comparable local monuments come from the very different context of Luristan, where the usually tapered, octagonal stone and mortar funerary pillars of the Pusht-i Kuh occasionally possess a round section and a turban-like finial (P1. IVc).7 Stones of Type 2, on the other hand, are still to be seen in small groups atop the main ridge of Alexander's Barrier, where they are said to mark individual graves, or standing in solitary positions a little to the north of the line of the Barrier. Even this slightly enlarged pattern of distribution is unlikely to be representative, and we would be well advised to suppose that further stones of Type 2, if not also stones of Type 1, will be recorded in the general Atrek region in future years. The date of most of the stones found in the Hkilat Nabi cemetery is uncertain. The one hard fact we have is that certain of the small stones of Type 2 from the east slope of the eastern peak carry dated inscriptions (Pl. IIIc). Such rare and often poorly cut inscriptions, each dating to about 70 years ago,s are presumably representative of a fashion that only accompanied the latest burials. This conclusion is fortified by the stone shown in PI. IIIa and b: although it is undated, this inscribed stone shows both the sudden extravagance of a herring-bone pattern and the still greater liberty, such as might be expected towards the end of the Qajar period of a recognizable representation of a human figure. At the other end of the time-scale, a partly-buried, horizontal tombstone of a very different kind (Pl. IVb) is conceivably one of the earliest in the whole series. In very general terms, it recalls the sometimes stepped gravestones which used to be visible until a few years ago in cemeteries of the Saljfiq period and of later date in the vicinity of Hamadan.9 Between these opposed chronological limits it is clear that much latitude remains. Yet, since most of the stones would not seem to have suffered to any great extent from weathering, it may be appro- priate to place the majority between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, and to presume (partly because not one example is inscribed) that the production of the stones of Type 1 had already come to an end during the nineteenth century.'0 The various shrines on the mountain offer no clear chronological assistance. According to various inscriptions written in Persian, the main tomb, now an entirely modern edifice (Pl. Ib), is that of Hilat Nabi ibn Sinan, a grandson, as one local tradition avers, of the Prophet Mubammad. The inscriptions include the blessing 'Alaihi al-Saldm, a benediction which the Sunnis traditionally reserve for the Prophet and for still earlier prophets such as Moses." To the east of Hiilat NabT's tomb stands a second funerary structure also undergoing reconstruction which is variously regarded as that of Halat Nabi's son-in-law or his mother-in-law. And, if a small ruined shrine near the middle of the High Plateau remains unclaimed, a further structure built at the lower end of the long protruding western ridge (P1. Ib) is said to be either the tomb of I;alat Nabi's faithful shepherd or, once again, that of his son-in-law. Iran is, of course, a land with an infinite variety of dramatic local tombstones. This is nowhere more true than in the west of the country, particularly within the folds of the long Zagros chain from Azerbaijan to Fars. But all the same it has to be acknowledged that the unique monuments of the Atrek region find no local counterpart anywhere in western Iran.

From the fourteenth century onwards, tombs with plain and turban-topped shafts abound,'2 and, while those stone shafts that stood indoors were once frequently capped by a real turban,'" those that stood outdoors were often equipped with a turban-like finial.14 Without wishing to venture more than one further comment, it might be surmised that the variously capped shafts of both Ottoman Turkey and the Atrek region were an ultimate echo of the famed two-metre high Kamennyia Baby or Balbal stones of the Altai Mountains;'" and that, in the separate contexts of both Anatolia and the Atrek region, it was the adoption of the Islamic faith that helped to inspire these new, almost entirely abstract ways of representing a deceased warrior.16 Appendix: A note on references to Halat Nabf By William R. Royce At David Stronach's request, Persian language and European accounts of the region between the Gurg.n and Atrek rivers were examined, with the hope of finding references to HIalat Nabi, the man, and to his shrine, its origins, and its functions. During the nineteenth century, the Persian government, centred in Tehran, had little influence in the Turkmansara, although the area was nominally under Qajar control. In fact, the Qijars' sole permanent presence on the steppe was the garrison at Aq Qal'a, whose troops seem to have rarely ventured out for fear of the Turcomans.'7 Two factors rendered the region dangerous for Shi'i, Persian-speaking non-Turcomans: the fact that the Turcomans were Sunni, not Shi'i, and the possibility of attack, capture, and even enslavement. Despite these obstacles, at least two Shi'i Persian travellers have left accounts of the Turcomans. Hajjj Zayn al-'Abidin Shirvani (1790-1837), a iSOfi known in the Ni'mat-All.hi brotherhood as Mast 'All Shah, was an inveterate traveller, who visited Anatolia, the Levant, the Caucasus, India and Central Asia. He collected and published information on the places he had been, including their history, descriptions of the inhabitants, religion, customs, and monuments in a work entitled Bustdn al-Siydha, which was completed in 1832. As a Sffi, Shirvani generally placed great emphasis on the history of shrines and practices connected with them. Unfortunately this was not the case with his entry on the Turcomans. Shirvani simply deals with the etymology of the term and the fact that the Turcomans were predominantly Sunni, closing with the information that he had visited them often and had found them to be most hospitable.'8 Rii Quli Khan Hidayat (1800-71), a poet and court official, has left an account of a diplomatic mission to Kh~arazm in 1851.19 Despite the fact that Hida.yat passed just to the west of the HIlat Nabi Shrine, he neither mentions it nor discusses Turcoman religious practices. Although none of the European accounts20 which were consulted specifically mention Halat Nabi, several do refer to such relevant topics as Turcoman burial, Turcoman shrines, and the veneration of holy men. James Baillie Fraser, the Scottish traveller, provides the most valuable account. In 1834, while Fraser was visiting a Goklan Turcoman camp south of the Gurgan river and east of Hdlat Nabi, the death of a Turcoman provided the opportunity for him to investigate their burial and mourning customs. Fraser was told that the Goklan dead ... must be taken to a distance of nearly fifty miles, to the original burying place of the tribe upon the banks of the Attruck, a journey which would require two or three days, and through a country now overrun with their enemies.21 Fraser goes on: A' Goklan dies, his body is washed, the earth where this process has been performed is gathered, and, together with some scrap of his old apparel, is buried in a conspicuous place near one of the obah [tent group] to which he belonged. But the body is carried to the ancient burial ground of the tribe, which generally is near the grave of some holy mar, the former spiritual guide or prophet of the obah, and whose reliques are supposed to hallow the spot.22</page><page sequence="8">150 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES The shrine of HIlat Nabi, a holy man held in reverence by the Yomut Turcomans, could possibly have served them as a burial place in the past, although there is no evidence of burial at the present. Fraser's assertion that the Turcomans did have shrines to holy men whom they specially revered is supported by later travellers. Yate (1894) writes of the mausoleum of the prophet Zakariya, located on the south bank of the Gurgin river, a shrine cared for by the Yomut Turcomans, but he fails to offer a description.23 Rabino (1909) notes three Turcoman shrines built to commemorate three brothers: (1) Qarangi Imdm (" black Imam "), outside the old city of Gurg.n, " an old domed mausoleum mostly underground, ... which is generally believed to be the tomb of Imam Ya1hy b. Zayd, who was slain in battle outside the city in about 125/742-3 ... ";24 (2) Qizil Imnm (" red Imam "), " near Qari Qal'a in Russian territory ";25 (3) Aq Imam (" white Imam "), " on the summit of a hill of the village of Nilh in Findirisk ".26 In the absence of detailed descriptions of the above-mentioned shrines, no physical comparison can be made with the structures at the HIlat Nabi shrine. It is significant, however, that H~lat Nabi, like the shrine of Zakariy., is believed to be the tomb of a pre-Islamic prophet, and that, like Aq Imim, it is located on a hill. The only specific information we have been able to obtain on Hilat Nabi and his shrine comes from Dr. William Irons of the Department of Anthropology at Northwestern University, who has studied the Yomut Turcomans.27 According to Dr. Irons,28 two tombs at the shrine called H~lat Nabi serve as places of pilgrimage for the Yomut: the higher one is said to be that of .Halat Nabi, who according to the Turcomans was a pre-Islamic prophet (payghambar); the lower tomb is said to be that of Ata Chofun (" father shepherd "), Hilat Nabi's son-in-law. At present the shrine is not used as a cemetery. Despite our examination of the literature, the HIlat Nabi shrine remains a mystery. We do know that he is believed to have been a pre-Islamic prophet, but we do not know the details of his life and why he is held in veneration by the Yomut Turcomans. The answer to the question of HiIlat Nabi's identity, who built the shrine, when and why, and whether its structures are unique, depends upon further exploration of the region, further examination of the site, and collection and study of Turcoman oral tradition. These tasks will be impossible until the region finds stability. For further notes on the shrine, see Appendix above. 2 James Baillie Fraser, A Winter's Journey from Constantinople to Tehran II (London, 1838), 363-4. I am indebted to William R. Royce for this reference. Ibid. 4 These and the following notes were compiled in the course of two separate, unfortunately all too short, visits to HIalat Nabi in 1978 and 1980. On each occasion these journeys began and ended near Qara Tepe Shaikh, at the hospitable farm of Mr. and Mrs. Narsi Firouz. Certain of the local Turcoman do in fact think of the stones as " petrified people ". 6 Part of the name in the inscription has been read by Professor Royce as " Husain Quli " I am very grateful to Professor Louis Vanden Berghe for drawing my attention to these stone and mortar monuments and for providing the photograph shown here as Plate IVc. s One of the stones of Type 2 from Alexander's Barrier bears a similar lunar date in the 1320s. 9 Personal observation. 10 The source of the stone is no longer known. Given the lack of good local stone, and the apparent importance of the site, distant quarries may well have been used. 1 For further details, see the Appendix. 12 One of the earliest examples comes from the tomb chamber of the Seyit Gazi in the Ummuhan Hatun complex 80 km. north of Afyonkarahisar. Here a carved helmet underlies the huge turban. Information kindly supplied by Mr. Martin Weaver. " Cf. G.
