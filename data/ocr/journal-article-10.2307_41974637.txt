<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CA JETAN TRADITION OF ANALOGY INTRODUCTION In his recent book, St. Thomas Aquinas on Analogy , we find George P. Klubertanz, S.J., stating: St. Thomas speaks of analogy in almost every one of his works, in a variety of contexts, yet he nowhere gives a thorough ex professo treatment of the problem. Analogy is discussed only within the framework of a specific instance of analogous likeness, only as a reply to a specific objection. St. Tho- mas left no general treatise on analogy. If the importance of analogy in Thomistic metaphysics explains the large number of previous textual studies, the scattered and partial texts explain in great part the déficiences and conflicting interpretations of these studies. There is no simple answer to the question : What is St. Thomas' doctrine of analogy.1 There is no simple answer to this question because there is no general doctrine of analogy in the writings of Aquinas. There are, however, many uses of analogies in various particular contexts of the works of the saint. In order to support this rather surprising thesis, Fr. Klubertanz considers the various passages concerning analogy in the writings of Saint Thomas in a chronological way, pointing out both terminological shifts and doctrinal developments. In doing this it is shown that several particular kinds of analogy are consistently described; that there are various divisions of analogy made by Aquinas, although these divisions are not always clear-cut; and that there are some doctrinal constants which can be found in the particular texts concerning analogy. But, nevertheless, it is also clear that : there is in St. Thomas no general theory of analogy, no explicit presentation of the general structure of analogy. There are at best incidental remarks about elements of such a general structure.2 Even though Fr. Klubertanz's thesis may be correct, this is not the most popular interpretation of Thomas. The general trend of inter- pretation has been to reduce the various Thomistic texts concerning analogy to some one general theory of analogy. Perhaps the most out- 1 Klubertanz, S.J., George P., St. Thomas Aquinas on Analogy.

HARRISON standing attempt at such a reduction is found in Thomas de Vio Cardinal Cajetan's treatise, De nominum analogia (1498). 3 In this work, Cajetan seeks to reduce all analogies to one of three modes; viz., analogy of inequality (analogia inaequalitatis) , analogy of attribution (analogia attributi oni s ) , and analogy of proportionality (analogia proportionali- tatis).* Even though other commentators of Thomas on analogy disagree with some of the more specific details of Cajetan's work, nevertheless they still approach the subject of analogy in terms of a reduction to several categories. For example, Sylvester of Ferrara maintains that every analogy must have a primary analogate.5 But Sylvester still maintains that there are various distinct kinds of analogies to which all particular analogies may be reduced.6 Francis Suarez also disagrees with Cajetan on specific points. For example, Suarez holds that the analogy of attribution is not always an extrinsic one and that the analogy of proportionality does not apply to the relation between creature and Creator.7 However, his discussion of analogy is within the framework of the categories drawn by Cajetan. As Fr. Klubertanz so aptly points out: No independent examination of the Thomistic corpus of analogy texts has yet been published by a Suarezin; even when rejecting Cajetan's inter- pretation, they discuss Thomistic analogy in the light of Cajetan's categories. The preponderance of Cajetan's influence in the systematic elaboration of a theory of analogy is more readily appreciated in those who oppose him. Even when they disagree, they used his frame of reference.8 But prior to actually examining the Cajetan theory of analogy, two points should be raised. These are, what are the purported sources of this theory, and what are the major problems which it claims to answer ? As regards the sources of his doctrine, Cajetan claims to make it clear that he is merely systematizing and developing the teachings of Aristotle, Averroes and especially St. Thomas.® 3 Caietanus, Thomas de Vio, De nominum analogia; De conceptu entis (P.

Upholders of this tradition, such as Edward A. Bushinski and Henry J. Koren, will be quick to point out that Aquinas did not completely and explicitly work out a general theory of analogy.11 Rather he uses particular analogies in particular cases, or contexts. Nevertheless, the claim will continue, all the material needed for such a general theory of analogy is there. And the Cajetan tradition12 purports to have developed this material into a general theory of analogy which is truly that of Aquinas. But what are the major problems this general theory of analogy is supposed to explain, or at least supposed to help us to understand ? One of the most important of these is that of "analogical-predication." The problem might arise in this way. We use, for example, the word 'health' in a great many ways. We say that the climate is healthy, that a person is healthy, that somebody has a healthy skin, and the like. Now it is obviously the case that we are not using the word 'health' in the same way in each case. But it is also just as obvious that there is some similarity between the various different uses of the word. What explanation can we give here ? It is questions of this kind which are the major concern of Cajetan's first two modes of analogy; i. e., analogies of inequality and attribution?13 In order to answer this question, we will see that the doctrine of "identical minimal meaning"14 is required, which states in particular that every general word has one essential meaning to which the word refers, or names, throughout all of its varying uses. 10 Ibid. 11 Ibid. 12 Ibid.

It is by a use of "Analogy of Proportionality" that creatures can obtain knowledge of God, and at the same time avoid the fallacy of equivocation or univocation in language about God.17 Closely tied up with this problem of knowledge of God is the problem of analogical-predication of the Divine Names, such as 'wisdom/ 'goodness/ and 'love/ How are we able to call God by any of these without falling into the error of anthropomorphism ? These are the major problems which the Cajetan theory attempts to answer, to explain. My major question in the following sections will be, is the theory success- ful in these claims ? Cardinal Cajetan bases his entire treatment of the question of analogy on a passage found in the Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard of Aquinas. Here we see Saint Thomas speaking of analogy secundum intentionem et non secundum esse , secundum esse et non secundum inten - tionem, and secundum intentionem et secundum esse.18 It is to these three 15 Caietanus, De nominum analogia; I, 3. 16 Caietanus, De nominum analogia ; III, ff.

Cajetan makes his reduction of all analogies to the three above mentioned modes in Chapter I, sections 2 and 3 of his De nominum analogia : 2 In this work the word analogy means proportion or proportionality, as we have learned from the Greeks. However, the term has been subjected to so many extensions and distinctions that many names are erroneously spoken of as analogous, and confusion would result from any effort to recon- cile these many distinctions. However, lest we neglect the main issue through an investigation of what is only of secondary importance, and be accused of using a peculiar terminology, we shall include all the variations under one threefold division, and we shall proceed from those terms which are less properly analogous to those which are truly analogous. 3 All analogous terms can be reduced to three modes of analogy : Analogy of Inequality Analogy of Attribution Analogy of Proportionality However, according to the true sense of the term and the practice of Aristotle, only the last mode constitutes analogy, and the first one is entirely foreign to analogy.20 I hope to point out, as we proceed, that this attempt at "reductionalism" is entirely inappropriate. But just where has the theory gone wrong - where has it de-railed itself ? Certainly, at least part of the mistake can be pointed to by the notion of "reductionalism." It seems to me that one of the primary mistakes of Cajetan is the attempt to reduce all analogies and analogical words to a general theory resting on three modes of analogy. It is these three modes of analogy that we must examine. In doing this it is not my intention to demonstrate that the 19 Concerning the date of this work see: Eschmann, O.P., Ignatus, "A Catalogue of St. Thomas' Works," in Gilson's The Christian Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas.

Adeo tamen extensum distinc- tumque est, ut multa nomina analogia abusive dicamus; et multarum distinctionum adunatio si fieret, confusionem pareret.

Ad tres ergo modos analogiae omnia analoga reducuntur: scilicet ad analogiam inaequalitatis, et analogiam attributionis, et analogiam proportio- nalitatis. Quamvis secundum veram vocabuli proprietatem et usum Aristo- telis, ultimus modus tantum analogiam constituât, primus autem alienus ab analogia omnino sit.</page><page sequence="6">I84 FRANK R. HARRISON analogies of inequality, of attribution, and of proportionality are logi- cally invalid theories. I do want to bring to the foreground the question of the applicability of these three modes of analogy to any and every particular analogy that might be constructed , for the claim has been made that all analogies and analogical words are reducible to one of these three modes of analogy. In each case I shall first give a traditional account of the modes of analogy in question. Then I shall proceed to my comments on that particular mode of analogy. Analogy of Inequality Of this mode of analogy, Cajetan says: 4 . . . Things are said to be analogous by analogy of inequality if they have a common name, and the notion indicated by this name is exactly the same but unequally participated in. We are speaking here of inequality of perfection; for example, body is a term common to inferior and superior bodies, and the notion of all bodies insofar as they are bodies, is the same. If the question is asked, What is fire insofar as it is a body ? the answer will be : a substance subject to the three dimensions ; and likewise to the question, What is the heaven insofar as it is a body ? etc. Nevertheless the notion of corporeity is not in inferior and superior bodies according to an equal grade of perfection.21 This is, of course, what Aquinas refers to as analogia secundum esse et non secundum intentionem22 But what is it to be an analogy according to being and not intention ? Or, to put this into the language of Cajetan,23 what is it for various things to participate unequally in the same notion ? A more or less traditional account24 may well proceed somewhat like this. This mode of analogy presupposes the classification of things into species and genus, and these species and genera form some sort of ordered, or graded, hierarchy of things. For example, 'animar is properly predicated only of the genus, and secondarily of the various species of the genus and, then, individuals of the species. It is said that several 21 Ibid., I, 4. The Latin is as follows: 4. Analoga secundum inaequalitatem vocatur, quorum nomen est com- mune, et ratio secundum illud nomen est omnino eadem, inaequaliter tamen participata. Et loquimur de inaequalitate perf ectionis : ut corpus nomen commune est corporibus inferioribus et superioribus, et ratio omnium cor- porum (in quantum corpora sunt) eadem est. Quaerenti enim quid est ignis in quantum corpus, dicetur: substantia trinae dimensioni subiecta. Et simi- liter quaerenti: quid est caelum in quantum corpus, etc. Non tamen secun- dum aequalem perfectionem ratio corporeitatis est in inferioribus et superio- ribus corporibus. 22 See footnote 18. 23 See footnote 21. 24 For example, the reader might wish to refer to The Bond of Being by James F. Anderson. See footnote 12.</page><page sequence="7">The Cajetan Tradition of Analogy 185 species may be a member of the same genus, provided that each of these species share to some degree, more or less, the same general formal character of the genus of which they are members. Here the notion of animal remains the same. The question becomes, how much does each individual species partake of this notion of animal , and therefore, how much does each individual member of the species partake of the being of this same notion ? It is this degree of partaking that varies, not the notion of animal , which must have a univocal meaning. Or to put this in other words, there must be an identical something in which all of the analogates share - a common, real essence. We are not to think that the doctrine of the analogy of inequality in any way suggests that these various species which partake of the form of the genus are thereby all the same in their own natures. This is not the case at all, for Aquinas is careful to point out that : All animals are equally animals but they are not all equal animals, for one animal is greater and more perfect than another.25 And Cajetan says that: 6 . . . the analogates are considered equal in the formality signified by the common name but are not equal with respect to the 'to be' of this com- mon formality. For the formality of every genus has a more perfect 'to be' in one thing than in another, as we see so often in metaphysics. For instance, not only is a plant more noble than a mineral, but corporeity is more noble in a plant than in a mineral; and the same goes for other perfections.26 By analogy of inequality the attempt is made to predicate one thing uni vocally of many other things. Thus animal is predicated in the same way of both cat and human. It seems that there are two linguistic con- fusions implied by analogy of unequality. The first of these is the sup- position that for a word to be meaningful it must name something. This appears obvious with concrete substantivais like 'this chair/ It must also, therefore, be the case with universal, general words. But it is obvious that these words do not name any concrete things like this particular 25 Aquinas, St. Thomas, Quaestiones disputatae de malo: II, a. 9, ad. 16. (Parma edition) : Dicendum quod omnia animalia sunt aequaliter animalia, non tarnen sunt aequaliter animalia, sed unum animal est altero maius et perfectius ; et simi- liter non oportet quod omnia peccata propter hoc sint paria. 26 Caietanus, De nominum analogia; I, 6. 6. Hanc analogiam S. Thomas, in I Sent., dist. 19 vocat analogiam secundum esse tantum, eo quod analogata parificantur in ratione significata per illud nomen commune, sed non parificantur in esse illius rationis. Per- fectius enim esse habet in uno, quam in alio, cuiuscumque generis ratio, ut in Metaphysica pluries patet. Non solum enim pianta est nobilior minera; sed corporeitas in planta est nobilior corporeitate in minera: et sic de aliis.</page><page sequence="8">l86 FRANK R. HARRISON chair on which I am now sitting. But, nevertheless, they must name something, it is held, in order to be meaningful - to have a meaning. For example, they are said to name Forms, or genera, or universais, or essences, or concepts, etc. I want to point out that words are not things that have meanings, like I have an automobile. Words do not have anything, and need not name anything to be meaningful. Words are symbols which become meaningful in accordance with the various sentences in which they are used - sentences which are placed in a particular context, or situation. The second linguistic confusion lurking behind the theory of analogy of inequality is that the meanings of various words are like physical things that can be put into boxes. In fact Cajetan's comments rather remind me of a young child's toy I have seen. This toy consisted of several brightly colored, square boxes with no lids.These boxes were all graduated in size so that one would fit snuggly into another. But words, and uses of words in sentences, are not like boxes which can be put one inside another. To think in terms of this model is to be quickly misled. "Specific meanings" are not contained within "general meanings." Analogy of Attribution In speaking of analogy of attribution, Cajetan says: 8 Those things are analogous by attribution which have a common name, and the notion signified by this name is the same with respect to the term but different as regards the relationships to this term. For example, the name healthy is common to medicine, urine and animal, but the notion of all insofar as healthy expresses different relationships to one term, namely, health. For if anyone describes what an animal is insofar as it is healthy, he will say that it is the subject of health, and that urine insofar as it is healthy is a sign of health, whereas medicine insofar as it is healthy will be mentioned as a cause of health. In this example it is perfectly clear that the notion of health is not entirely the same nor entirely different, but to a certain extent the same and to a certain extent different. For there is a diversity of relation- ships, but the term of these relationships is one and the same.27 27 Ibid., II, 8. 8. Analoga autem secundum attributionem sunt, quorum nomen com- mune est, ratio autem secundum illud nomen est eadem secundum terminům, et diversa secundum habitudines ad ilium: ut sanum commune nomen est medicinae, urinae et animali; et ratio omnium in quantum sana sunt, ad unum terminům (sanitatem scilicet), diversas dicit habitudines. Si quis enim assignet quid est animal in quantum sanum, subiectum dicet sanitatis; urinam vero in quantum sanam, signum sanitatis; medicinam autem in quantum sanam, causam sanitatis proferet. Ubi clare patet, rationem sani esse nec omnino eamdem, nec omnino diversam ; sed eamdem secundum quid, et diversam secundum quid. Est enim diversitas habitudinum, et identitas termini illarum habitudinum.</page><page sequence="9">The Cajetan Tradition of Analogy 187 A contemporary follower of the Cajetan tradition, James F. Anderson, remarks on this mode of analogy in this way: Analogy of proportion or attribution ... is in effect when the same word is applied to different things according to a formal signification partly the same and partly diverse - diverse as regards the diverse modes of relations to the term of the attribution or attributions, but the same as regards the term itself. Things are analogous in this way because they are proportional to one thing : proportionantur ad unum. In other words, things are analogous by analogy of proportion or attribution whose name is common, the notion signified by that name being the same as regards the term of the attribution but diverse as regards the relations of the analogates to it.28 There are several necessary conditions connected with this general mode of analogy. The first of these is that the analogical word; e.g., 'health,' which is predicated of a number of analogates, is predicated properly or formally of only one analogate. In the example of health it is said that animals are properly called 'healthy.' Other things are said to be 'healthy' only insofar as they are signs of health in the animal, or are causes of this health. Here the word 'cause' is to be understood in the sense of the four causes; i. e., material, efficient, formal and final, as listed and discussed by Aristotle in the Physics .29 For example, the notion of health is common to diet, urine and the animal itself. If anyone should use the word 'health,' or a derivative of it, in connection with diet, urine and animal, they would say that such-and- such is a healthy diet, the urine is healthy and that is a healthy animal, all in rather different but related ways. The diet would be called 'healthy' in that it is an efficient cause of health in the animal; the urine in that it is a sign of a healthy animal; and the animal is called 'healthy' in that it is the proper subject of health. Thus, it is seen that all three uses of the word 'health' are different, but nevertheless, they still have some one element common to them all. To put this in another way, it is said that there is a diversity of relations between the various uses of the word 'health,' but the primary analogate of all of these various relations is one and the same; viz., the healthy animal.30 The second necessary condition of an analogy of attribution is that the primary analogate to which the diverse relationships of the analogical 28 Anderson, The Bond of Beins, p. 96. 29 Aristotle, The Works of Aristotle.

But this assertion can be understood in one of two ways; viz., either universally or particularly. If the analogates are considered particularly, the analogical word is necessarily one in number in a "positive way." If, on the other hand, the analogates are considered universally, the single analogous word is not multiplied numerically in the analogates as a universal, although in it- self it is something universal. If one were to consider this healthy diet and this healthy animal, they both are called 'healthy' in relation to the health of the particular animal in question - this animal being one concrete animal. Richard is said to be healthy because he has this particular health ; the medicine is said to be healthy because it is a cause of Richard's particular health, and so on. But if we are to consider healthy animal and healthy diet in a general way, the health by which these are called healthy, formally speaking, is not in itself numerically one. It cannot be said to be numerically one because universal causes must be assigned to universal effects, and universal effects are not numerically one.31 Health is, therefore, numerically one in these analogates in a "negative way" only, not being multiplied numerically in animal, diet, and so forth - for there is not one health in diet and another in animal. The third necessary condition of analogy of attribution is derived from the second. The primary analogate must be put into the definitions of the other analogates, which may be of any number, with repect to the ana- logous word. In names predicated of many in an analogical sense, all are predicated through a relation to some one thing; and this one thing must be placed in the de- finition of them all. And since the essence expressed by the name is the defini- tion, as the Philosopher says, such a name must be applied primarily to that which is put in the definition of the other things, and secondarily to these others according as they approach more or less to the first. Thus, for instance, healthy applied to animals comes into the definition of healthy applied to medicine, which is called healthy as being the cause of health in the animal; and also into the definition of healthy which is applied to urine, which is called healthy in so far as it is a sign of the animal's health.32 81 Aristotle, Physics 195b 25 - 29. 32 St. Thomas, Summa theologica. I, 13, 6c The entire relevant Latin passage is : 13, 6 c.: Dicendum quod in omnibus nominibus quae de pluribus analogice dicuntur, necesse est quod omnia dicantur per respectum ad unum ; et ideo illud unum oportet quod ponatur in definitione omnium. Et quia "ratio quam significai nomen, est definitio," ut dicitur in IV Metaphys., necesse est quod illud</page><page sequence="11">The Cajetan Tradition of Analogy 189 The primary analogate must enter into the definitions of the several secondary analogates, because these secondary analogates have no essential, or intrinsic, right to be called by the analogous word except through attribution to the primary analogate. We remember that it is only of the primary analogate that the analogous word is properly predicated in analogy of attribution. In this way, the notions of medicine , diet, and the like, insofar as they are called 'healthy,' all refer to the health of the animal. In other words, to understand the meaning of the word 'health' as predicated of medicine and diet, we must have some knowledge of what is meant by 'health' as predicated of an animal. Definition is, therefore, viewed in this form of analogy as being derived from, and based on, the form of the primary analogate. It is the primary analogate which is the basis of the identical minimal meaning going through all of the other analogates, and without which there would be no analogy of attribution. Consequently, what is realized formally in a thing must be included in the definition of all other things which receive the same analogical word by attribution. As Aquinas points out, "in analogicals, a name taken in one signification must be placed in the nomen per prius dicatur de eo quod ponitur in definitione aliorum, et per posterius de aliis, secundum ordinem quo appropinquant ad illud primum vel magis vel minus ; sicut sanum quod dicitur de animali, cadit in definitione sani quod dicitur de medicina; quae dicitur sana inquantum causat sani- tatem in animali; et in definitione sani quod dicitur de urina, quae dicitur sana inquantum est signum sanitatis animalis. Sic ergo omnia nomina quae metaphorice de Deo dicuntur, per prius de creaturis dicuntur quam de Deo, quia dicta de Deo nihil aliud significant quam similitudines ad tales creaturas. Sicut enim ridere dictum de prato nihil aliud significat quam quod pratum similiter se habet in decore cum floret, sicut homo cum ridet, secundum similitudinem proportionis ; sicut nomen leonis dictum de Deo nihil aliud significat quam quod Deus similiter se habet ut fortiter operetur in suis operibus, sicut leo in suis. Et sic patet quod secundum quod dicuntur de Deo, eorum significatio definiri non potest, nisi per illud quod de creaturis dicitur. De aliis autem nominibus, quae non metaphorice dicuntur de Deo, esset etiam eadem ratio, si dicerentur de Deo causaliter tantum, ut quidam posuerunt. Sic enim cum dicitur Deus est bonus, nihil aliud esset quam Deus est causa bonitatis creaturae; et sic hoc nomen bonum, dictum de Deo, clauderet in suo intellectu bonitatem creaturae. Unde bonum per prius diceretur de creatura quam de Deo. Sed supra ostensum est quod huiusmodi nomina non solum dicuntur de Deo causaliter, sed etiam essentialiter. Cum enim dicitur Deus est bonus, vel sapiens, non solum significatur quod ipse sit causa sapientiae vel bonitatis, sed quod haec in eo eminentius prae- existunt. Unde, secundum hoc, dicendum est quod quantum ad rem signi- ficatala per nomen, per prius dicuntur de Deo quam de creaturis, quia a Deo huiusmodi perfectiones in creaturas manant. Sed quantum ad impositio- nem nominis, per prius a nobis imponuntur creaturis, quas prius cognosci- mus. Unde et modum significandi habent qui competit creaturis, ut supra dictum est.</page><page sequence="12">190 FRANK R. HARRISON definition of the same name taken in other significations."33 Again, there must be an identical meaning in each of the analogates. The fourth necessary condition of analogy of attribution34 may be presented in this way. Since the analogy of attribution involves a plura- lity of relationships, it also involves a plurality of concepts. The common analogous word has a different meaning in respect of each of the various analogates, and, therefore, in each case involves a different concept. But all of these different significations have a mutual connotation, this being that single thing, or minimal meaning of which the analogous name is properly predicated. Given these four necessary conditions, just what is analogy of attri- bution supposed to accomplish, what general problems does it purport to answer, and does it ? Well, we are certainly dealing with the problem of predication; i. e., how are we able to predicate the same analogous word to several different things , or analogates ? Surely the climate and any animal are two very different things, but we say of both that they are healthy. Certainly a card game and a game of tennis are two very dif- ferent kinds of games, but, nevertheless, we call them both 'games.' In answer to the question just raised, we are told that when an ana- logous word is predicated of two, or more, different things, then the word is predicated according to the relationship these things have to some third thing, here understanding 'thing' in a rather broad sense as in- cluding definitions, concepts, and the like.35 Now it is the case that a large number of examples can be given, that of health being one, which seem neatly to fit this schema. But on the other hand, there are the border-line cases which do not clearly fit this doctrine of analogy, but which, if the claim for completeness and and generality is to be satisfied, 83 Ibid., I, 13, ioc. The Latin text reads: 13, ioc.: Dicendum quod hoc nomen Deus in praemissis tribus significationibus non accipitur neque uni voce ñeque aequivoce, sed analogice. Quod ex hoc patet. Quia univocorum est omnino eadem ratio, aequivocorum est omnino ratio diversa; in analogicis vero oportet quod nomen, secundum unam signifi- cationem acceptum, ponatur in definitione eiusdem nominis secundum alias significai iones accepti. Sicut ens de substantia dictum ponitur in definitione entis secundum quod de accidente dicitur; et sanum dictum de animali ponitur in definitione sani secundum quod dicitur de urina et de medicina; huius enim sani quod est in animali, urina est significativa, et medicina fact iva. Sic accidit in proposito. Nam hoc nomen Deus, secundum quod pro Deo vero sumitur, in ratione Dei sumitur secundum quod dicitur Deus secundum opinionem vel participationem. Unde manifestum est quod analogice dicitur. 84 Caietanus, De nominum analogia. II, 15. 85 I base this comment on Cajetan s use of name. See : De nominum analogia. IV, 31.</page><page sequence="13">The Cajetan Tradition of Analogy 191 should. Let us examine two such border-line cases of analogous uses of a word. Consider the statement, 'She has a healthy skin/ Now from the passages that we have been considering concerning the analogy of attribution the word 'healthy' must be used in one of several ways, all of which in some way refer to a primary analogate, which in this case we take to be the healthy girl. At once it might be remarked that the analogous word 'healthy1 is being predicated of the skin because the skin is a "sign of" the general healthy condition of the girl. And this is one answer which is satisfactory to suggest. But we can also say that the skin is called 'healthy' just because it contributes to the health of the girl. Here is a basically different interpretation from that of the skin being a "sign of" health, and therefore, being called 'healthy/ We are now considering the skin as in some way being a contributing factor to the girl's health. Now the answer to the question, "Why is the skin called 'healthy' ?" becomes, "Because it is a contributing factor to the girl's health," and not, "because it is an indication of the girl's healthy state." And, once again, our answer is not incorrect. But there is yet another answer that might be set forth. We can, and do, also say that this skin is healthy because it is itself in a state of well-being. We can easily imagine a dermatologist saying, "My, what a healthy skin!" Here the doctor is not necessarily considering this particular healthy skin as either a sign of the girl's health, or as contributing to her health. The dermatologist is simply thinking about the skin itself being in a good condition, and, when he has judged it so, calling it 'healthy.' This example, 'She has a healthy skin,' is a clear-cut case of what should be an instance of analogy of attribution. All of the requirements of this mode of analogy are fulfilled by the example of 'healthy skin,' and yet we still are not able to clearly say why , given the schema of just the analogy of attribution , the skin is called 'healthy.' We cannot conclusively apply the schema to an example which seems to be a paradigm case. Consider the second example, 'This is a painful cut.' Here again we have an example of what should be a clear case of analogy of attribution, where the analogous word 'pain' refers first to a primary analogate and secondly to other analogates. Again, we can interpret this statement in at least three different ways. We can ask ourselves is 'pain' being pre- dicated of 'cut' because the cut is a sign of a painful condition of the cut person ; is 'pain' being predicated of 'cut' because the cut causes a painful condition for the cut person; or it might be said that 'pain' is being predicated of 'cut' because the cut itself is painful ? Once again, any one</page><page sequence="14">192 FRANK R. HARRISON of the three might be said; and, once again, the analogy of attribution does not tell us just how we are using the word 'pain' as predicated of 'cut/ Surely both of these examples in the framework of Cajetan must be considered as instances of analogy of attribution. They simply could not be instances of either analogies of inequality or proportionality. But these two examples do not fit into the schema of analogy of attribution in any clear and definite way. Thus, I am led to question whether or not this mode of analogy holds in all those cases where it seems that it should. And, further, whether in such cases this mode of analogy clearly explains how we are predicating the analogous word to some analogate. If it is the case that the analogy of attribution fails to hold good in all cases where it seemingly should, and does not explain clearly how we are predicating the analogous word to some analogate, then the claim of generality of the Cajetan theory is very much weakened. At this point, then, I bring into serious question the claim of complete generality. A follower of the Cajetan tradition might want to reply to the above in the following way. He may say that we certainly can, and do, call this skin 'healthy' for several reasons; but yet this fact does not bring into question the general applicability of the analogy of attribution. In one instance, he may continue, we are considering this skin as a sign of health, in another as a contributing factor to health, and in the last instance as the primary analogate of which health is properly predicated. This, he might point out, only suggests the fact that we talk about this skin in several different ways. But through all of varying ways of talking about this skin, there runs one identical, minimal meaning - like one single thread. Parallel observations could be made about the case of the painful cut. What are we to say to this type of rejoinder ? First, to say that we can talk about healthy skin in several different ways, "only points out the fact that we talk about this skin in several different ways/' seems at best a rather weak and uninteresting comment to make against the objections raised in the last several paragraphs. The point of the matter is that the mode of analogy of attribution is supposed to tell us how we can , in fact, predicate an analogous word to many analogates - not that we do it. We already know this. To repeat, the mode of analogy of attribution purports to tell us in general - for every case - how and why we do in fact predicate certain words, such as 'health/ to dissimilar things. Thus, when it is asked how do we predicate words as we do, it is nugatory to point out that we do it.</page><page sequence="15">The Cajetan Tradition of Analogy 193 But, again, I have not said anything about the actual structure of this schema. I have only brought its general application into question. Let us now turn our attention to the structure of the schema itself. These comments are directed against the first necessary requirement of analogy of attribution; viz., that the analogous word which is predicated of a number of analogates is predicated properly, or formally, of only one analogate; i. e., the primary analogate of the analogy. To put this in other terms, there must be some distinctive common feature, the primary analogate, to which all the secondary analogates refer, and which, as an identical minimal meaning, is included in their definitions. As we find James F. Anderron saying: Analogy of attribution may involve only two terms: simple proportion or attribution of this to that ; or more than two terms; in fact, an indefinite number of terms. But regardless of their number, they are all referred to one principle term. Analogy of attribution is thus always ad unum , "analogy of one or of several to one" ("analogia unis vel plurium ad unum").** It has already been pointed out that the primary analogate does not have to be a thing in the materialistic use of the word 'thing/ for the primary analogate may also be a definition, concept, or the like.37 What is important to grasp, however, is that the analogy of attribution is dependent upon some primary referent. This is claimed to be true in all cases. But this notion of a primary referent - an identical minimal meaning - has been brought into serious question by such contemporary philosophers as Wittgenstein. For example, think of Wittgenstein's illustration of various tools in a tool box.38 All of these; e.g., the hammer, pliers, saw, glue-pot, ruler, nails, and so on, are called 'tool/ The question becomes how are we to predicate this one word 'tool' of so many different things? The traditional answer of Cajetan would be that there must be one essential definition, concept, or thing to which all of the various particular tools "refer" - some common thread of meaning running through all uses of the word, so that they are all called 'tools' in a secon- dary, or derived, way. Therefore, we have here an example of analogia unis vel plurium ad unum; i. e., in the general case analogia secundum intentionem et non secundum esse. But, we may ask, what does this move of claiming there is a primary analogate to which all secondary ones refer and from which they derive 36 Anderson, Tames F., The Bond of Being , pp. 101 - 102. 37 See footnote ^5. 38 Wittgenstein, Ludwig, Philosophical Investigations.

HARRISON their meanings - what does this move gain for us ? Here, I want to say, such an approach gains us nothing in our understanding of what we are doing when we say that this is a tool, that is a tool, and so on. Such a move does not aid us in the doing or understanding of anything that we did not already do or understand before. Consider another passage from Anderson's The Bond of Being: Thus, irrespective of the diversity of content in the actual conception of any generic or specific object, a basic, formal univocality is supposed if the concept has been grasped at all. Where this is not so, ordinary conversation would be impossible. For instance, the statement, "this is a typewriter," would be unintelligible if the word typewriter were not univocal, that is, if it did not have an identical minimal meaning as applied to all typewriters ; for in that case no one could be sure what I was talking about.39 There are several comments that could be made about this passage from the Ca jetan tradition, but I shall mention only two. First, the idea that there is necessarily one minimal meaning in any analogy of attri- bution reduces this mode of analogy to a univocal status. In other words, the analogy of attribution is no analogy at all! Cajetan himself realized that he was forced to this position.40 That is why he will allow only analogy of proportionality to be called 'analogy' in any proper sense of the word.41 But, as against this position, I also hold that in ordinary language it is far from the general case that we require an "identical minimal meaning" of a word in order to be able to meaningfully use that word in our conversations. Nor in general can we say that there is an "identical minimal meaning" which serves as a referent, or primary analogate, in order to be able to use such words as 'tool,' 'game/ and 'health' in a meaningful way. Therefore, I wish to conclude here that the Cajetan tradition of the doctrine of the analogy of attribution has the structural flaw of being reduced to the univocal, and that the condition of generally having a primary analogate is not at all justified in every case which purports to be an example of analogy of attribution. To recapitulate briefly, I have pointed out first that analogy of attribution has no necessary application to particular cases. It has no 39 Anderson, The Bond of Being, p. 24. (Italics, mine) 40 E. g. see: Caietanus, De nominum analogia. II, 16. The Latin reads: Et propter hoc tria de huiusmodi analogo dicuntur: scilicet quod com- mune est omnibus analogatis non secundum vocem tantum; - et quod simpliciter prolatum stat pro primo ; - et quod non est prius primo ana- logato, in quo tota sua ratio formaliter salvatur. Primum quidem peculiarius significai , et super omnia analogata superius significatum non habet. (Italics, mine). 41 Caietanus, De nominum analogia. III, 23.</page><page sequence="17">The Cajetan Tradition of Analogy 195 general explanatory force, but at best is only a descriptive generaliza- tion of how we might interpret some cases of our multifarious linguistic usages. But, unfortunately, the mode of analogy of attri- bution does present itself as explaining something. Here the theory is otiose. The theory fails in that it does not explain anything that we did not already know about the particular case before employing this theory. Second, it was pointed out that analogy of attribution has a structural flaw. In assuming an identical minimal meaning running through all the various uses of the so-called analogous word, we find that this word can only be analogical if it is univocal - no small contradiction ! Analogy of Proportionality Let us now consider the third mode of analogy cited by Cajetan and his followers. This is the analogy of proportionality, which is called ana- logy in the proper sense. 23 Description. Passing over from what is called incorrectly analogous to analogy in the proper sense, we say that those things are called analogous by proportionality which have a common name, and the notion expressed by this name is proportionally the same. Or to say the same in a different way, those things are called analogous by proportionality which have a common name, and the notion expressed by this name is similar according to a proportion. For instance, to see by corporeal vision and by intellectual vision are indicated by the common term to see , because just as to understand presents something to the mind, so to see presents something to the animated body.42 This mode of analogy is said to be based upon something that is strictly and formally present in all of the analogates of the analogy in question. In this way it differs from the analogy of attribution, which has only one primary analogate of which the analogous word, or perfection, is formally predicated. But though the analogates of the analogy of proportionality are in some sense said to be similar, they are not in any way said to be univocal. We shall find that there are three necessary conditions which must be fulfilled in an analogy of proper proportionality. These are : 42 Ibid. The Latin text is: 23. Ex abusive igitur analogis ad proprie analogiam ascendendo, dicimus: analoga secundum proportional itatem dici, quorum nomen est commune, et ratio secundum illud nomen est proportionaliter eadem. Vel sic: Analoga secundum proportionalitatem dicuntur, quorum nomen commune est, et ratio secundum illud nomen est similis secundum proportionem : ut videre corporali visione, et videre intellectualiter, communi nomine vocantur videre ; quia sicut intelligere, rem animae offert, ita videre corpori animato.</page><page sequence="18">196 FRANK R.HARRISON 1) Similarity of relations, and not attributes 2) Similarity of concrete relational complexes 3) Proper, or essential, similarity In order to be a bit clearer, let me begin by taking into account analogy of improper proportionality; i. e., metaphor. Consider the metaphor, 'queen bee/ In this example we speak of one particular bee being a queen, as we might speak of one particular lady of England being a queen. Now, in attempting to understand this, and other metaphors, we may easily be tempted to ask ourselves what particular quality, or attribute, does the bee and the human queen have in common. We may be tempted to look for some one characteristic which they both share. This being the case, we would be led to examine the individual bee very closely from now one point of view and now another. After such a careful scrutiny of the bee we may once again pose to ourselves the question, how is this insect qua insect like the human queen. And in some cases, if we think we have found such an attribute, we may be led to reason that if both X and Y have the same attribute, in common, surely there must be other common attributes as well. And after all, it is the case that any two objects in the world can be said to have some attribute in common; e. g. they are both objects in the world. But surely we do not want to say that anything can be used metaphorically of anything else. We have allowed ourselves to be philosophically seduced by a tempting procedure. And in doing so we have misunderstood the point of a metaphor. The view of interpreting a metaphor which has been presented is this. Two given objects are said to be similar because they have at least one attribute, or quality, in common. In that they both have this given attribute, they may be said to be similar. But a proper metaphor is not based on a comparison of a single attribute, or on a group of such attri- butes. What we are comparing are similar external relational structures. In the example of 'queen bee,' we are not comparing the insect to a human. We are comparing the external relation which holds between this bee and the rest of the hive with the external relation which holds between the human queen and the rest of the state. A metaphor is not based on a comparison of single attributes, or a collection of attributes. A metaphor is based on a comparison of external relations which hold between several objects. As such, the objects in question may only be very superficially like one another. But this has little to do with the metaphorical relation. Thus a metaphor is not a comparison of objects, but of relational struc- tures holding between objects.</page><page sequence="19">The Cajetan Tradition of Analogy 197 Neither is analogy of proportionality48 based upon a comparison of single attributes of various things. It is based upon a similarity of rela- tions, but this is not a direct relationship between the various analogates in the analogy, but rather there is a relationship within each of the ana- logates. It is these relationships that are said to be similar. This is the first necessary condition of analogy of proportionality; viz., that it always involves some sort of relational complex. When two such relational complexes are seen to be similar they then become analogates of one another, and the analogous word may then be predicated of each of them concretely and properly without an appeal to an univocal term, or primary analogate. But, Cajetan points out,44 this is not a recommendation to forget the individual analogates of the analogy. All of the analogies of proportional- ity involve more than merely a similarity of relation. There must be a similarity of one whole relational complex to another. As such, the ana- logy of proportionality involves not only a similarity of relation, but also that which is related. The reason for maintaining this point is to guard this mode of analogy from ultimately reducing itself to a univocal form.45 We remember that analogy of proportionality is claimed by Cajetan to be both secundum esse et secundum intentionem. It is for this reason that he looks upon this mode of analogy as the only one in the proper sense.46 He sees the other two modes of analogy in his system as ultimately reducible to some univocal condition of either esse or inten- tionem^1 - having either what might be called a distinctive common feature, or an identical minimal meaning. From the above type of discussion of Cajetan's account of analogy of proportionality it is said to follow that the analogous relations are intrinsically and properly present in each of the analogates.48 If this were not the case, there would not be an analogy of proportionality, but only an approximation which is called a metaphor, and it is for this reason that the examples thus far cited are all said to be metaphors. Now the relationship of one intrinsic relation to another provides the foundation for analogy of proportionality,49 because such relations are closer to the internal essence of the things in question than simple extrin- 43 Caietanus, De nominum analogia.

This will obviously hold only in those particular cases where we have selected essential, and not incidental, factors in the complexes of the analogy. While a relation might be similar, it does not follow that the parts are similar in an essential way. In order to attain a really proper analogy of this mode one must discover a similarity between intrinsic relations which are essentially dependent on their terms and the terms upon the relations. Such similarities will be both concrete and analogous, for they will involve both the relations and the terms of a concrete complex. But how are these internal relations so necessary for analogy of proportionality to be found ? These needed relations cannot be found in the aliquot parts of any particular thing, for these parts are quantitatively distinct from each other. Thus, these parts are capable of existing in separation without any relation to one another. But in addition to the various quantitative parts, or pieces, of a concrete thing, any material thing has more basic parts which cannot exist separately from one another.50 We begin here obviously to speak the language of a metaphysician. Now it is these fundamental parts which are essentially related to one another. For instance, the matter out of which a thing comes into being is an intrinsic part of the things in question. But this matter is always relative to some form, and the form in return is always related to the matter. Thus, each can exist only in relation to each other.51 Hence, once we discern such a similarity between the essential, relative parts of al) existing things, we have a basis for a genuine analogy of proportionality.52 This relational complex is not incidental to the thing in question, for this complex is part of the fundamental structure of the thing itself. Further, this relation of form and matter, which all concrete things have in common, cannot be similar in each case without involving the entire concrete complex in an analogous similarity. Thus, the analogy is actually present in each of the analogates, and we have an instance of proper analogy of proportionality, and not of a metaphor. The most important foundation of this mode of analogy is the relation between the essence of a thing and the existence of that thing. Such a relationship may be thought of as fulfilling the three necessary require- 50 Ibid., IV, *5. 61 This does not hold, of course, in the case of God, Who is pure form - - actus purus - and not a material object. An excellent discussion of the relations of potency-act, existence-essence, matter-form is found in Frederick Copleston's Aquinas , pp. 70 - 106. This is a Penguin Book (A 349) (1955). Attention should also be drawn to Etienne Gilson's The Christian Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas. 52 Caietanus, De nominum analogia. VII, 79-</page><page sequence="21">The Cajetan Tradition of Analogy 199 ments of an analogy of proportionality. First, it is a relation which is a necessary one to any thing, as essence is a capacity to be, and is thus relative to the existence of a thing. And the existence is related to the essence in that it is determined by the essence. Second, this is not an accidental relation distinct from its terms, but an essential relation fusing, as it were, with its terms. Essence is not the same as having a relation to existence, but it is rather a relation to existence, indistinct from this relation. The relation, therefore, cannot be without involving the concrete terms as well. Third, and finally, such a relational complex cannot be accidental to the thing in which it inheres, for nothing can be more essential to a thing than its very essence and existence. Any similarity which can be discussed between different things based on this relation- ship of essence and existence will not be a metaphor, but a true and proper analogy of proportionality. And such a similarity is actually found in all existing things. For no matter how different particular things may be, nevertheless, as the essence of one is to its existence, so is the essence of any other to its existence. In the Cajetan tradition, one of the most important uses of proper analogy of proportionality is that it is said to provide the basis for some type of knowledge about God; this mode of analogy is the only kind of analogy which holds between creature and the Creator.53 The claim is made that only by a proper analogy of proportionality are we, as creatures, able to argue from the created world about us to God without falling into the fallacy of equivocation or anthropomorphism. For example, consider this following argument : Every pure perfection which is found in creatures is also found in the Creator, God Now wisdom is both found in humans, and is a pure perfection. Therefore, wisdom must also be found in the Creator, God.54 But if the word 'wisdom' in the minor premise is to be understood as meaning human wisdom, we are at once involved in the fallacy of equi- vocation, for the word 'wisdom' in the conclusion certainly does not mean human wisdom. And if we do take the word 'wisdom' to mean the same throughout, then we fall into the fallacy of anthropomorphism. For these fallacies to be avoided, the word 'wisdom' must be used in neither an equivocal nor univocal sense; i.e., neither in only one way, nor in two completely distinct ways. The word 'wisdom' must be used in a manner which contains both the equivocal and univocal uses 63 Ibid., X. 54 Ibid., X, 105 and hi.</page><page sequence="22">200 FRANK R. HARRISON proportionaler. In other words, as man's wisdom is related to his nature, so is God's wisdom related to His nature. While man and God are com- pletely dissimilar, and the wisdom appropriate to each is also dissimilar; nevertheless, the relation of the wisdom of man to his nature is said to be similar to the relation of the wisdom of God to His nature. Thus, by means of a proper analogy of proportionality the word 'wisdom' can be predicated both of the man and God without falling into either the fallacy of equivocation or anthropomorphism. Let us now turn to a few critical remarks concerning this mode of analogy. The Cajetan tradition asserts that there is no direct relation between creature and God. There is, and can be, only an indirect relational similarity; and, thus, the theory of proper analogy of proportionality is brought into the scene in order to explain this indirect similarity, and whatever knowledge we can be said to have of God. To say, however, that there is no direct relation between the created order and its Creator is to go against Aquinas himself. For in the order of being all creation is directly and immediately dependent on God as the continual creator and preserver of the existence of the created order.65 On the other hand, in the order of knowledge, what we know about God can never be com- pletely cut off from its origins in the experiences we have of the created world about us. In a parallel way, the predicates which we use of crea- tures and God are related in more than a loose, indirect way. This is so because in the created world any (pure) perfection of a creature is related to God, and in the order of knowledge any perfection predicated of God includes in its definition a reference to the creatures which have been experienced as possessing such a perfection. But to maintain, as the Cajetan tradition requires, that neither the analogates nor any of their constituent parts are directly related56 leads us to this curious dilemma in the case of an analogy of this mode between creatures and God. Either we know what the perfection, e. g., wisdom, means independently of all reference to the created world, or we use the predicate-word from neither a direct knowledge of God nor by any reference to the perfection in question as found in the created world. Fr. Copleston, S.J., is quite aware of this point when he says : It is difficult to see how this kind of analogy [proper proportionality] can be of any value at all in regard to our knowledge of God, unless the analogy 65 For example, see St. Thomas' comments in Contra Gentiles , 2, 11 - 13.

IV, 33.</page><page sequence="23">The Cajetan Tradition of Analogy 201 of intrinsic attribution is presupposed [i. e. unless it is in fact presupposed that there is some direct relation between the created order and God - but this is just what we are not to suppose, according to the Cajetan tradi- tion]. Cajetan had doubtless much of value to say on the wrong uses of analogy; but I venture to doubt whether his restriction of analogy, as applied to God and creatures, to analogy of proportionality represents the view of Thomas. And it is perhaps a little difficult to see how his position does not lead in the end to agnosticism.57 In connection with Cajetan's presentation of analogy of proportiona- lity, Fr. Copleston also has the following remark to make : Apart from the obscurity of Cajetan's account of analogy, it is clear, I think, that to lay down rules for the term in order to avoid the fallacy of equivocation is not the same thing as to show that we are objectively justified in using the term in this way. It is one thing to say, for example, that if we assert that there is some similarity between the relation of the divine wisdom to the divine being and the relation of man's wisdom to his being we must not use the term 'wisdom' either univocally or equivocally; but it is another thing to show that we are entitled to speak at all of the divine wisdom. How could this possibly be shown if the only analogy which obtains between creatures and God is analogy of proportionality.68 Of course, Fr. Copleston is making the point that Cajetan is confusing what might be called the rules of the use of various predicate-words as applied to creatures and God, and the real significance of such predica- tion. Fr. Klubertanz makes a similar point when he says: If Cajetan had explicitly stated that he was doing only a predicational analysis and if his followers had so understood him, he would have made a clear contribution. Because his interest in analogy was mainly logical, his exposition is important for studies of the validity of reasoning employing analogous terms. Moreover, certain objections now urged in favor of agnosti- cism rest on the false assumption that all terms are univocal. . . . Against this assumption Cajetan's analysis is entirely valid and useful even for our contemporaries. When interpreted as remaining on the level of predicational analysis, the work of Cajetan is, then, a real contribution to the theory of analogy, and entirely faithful to St. Thomas. But Cajetan does not seem to realize the relation between his own and St. Thomas' doctrine. Had he seen the multiple levels of the Thomistic approach, he would not have absorbed all the other analyses of St. Thomas into one category of proportionality. In order to make such a reduction we 67 Copleston, A History of Western Philosophy (Volume III), pp.339 - 340. It is also worthwhile to note the following remark of D. M. MacKinnon found on page 182 of New Essays in Philosophical Theology, edited by Flew and Maclntyre. "Now I must be dogmatic here, and I may be attracting scholastic thunderbolts to my brow. But it seems to me attribution is fun- damental." If the thunderbolts do come, MacKinnon will find that he has several scholastic lightening-rods to help him. 68 Ibid.</page><page sequence="24">202 FRANK R.HARRISON must suppose that, when St. Thomas spoke of an analogy between God and creatures, he meant the same thing as if he had said "an analogy between our predication about God and our predication about creatures/'59 Let us now consider the third necessary requirement of an analogy of proportionality. It will be remembered that such an analogy must be based on a proper, or essential, similarity between intrinsic relations of the various analogates of the analogy. The most fundamental of these intrinsic relations was asserted to be that of essence-existence. My move will be to raise the question, not as to the "theoretical soundness" of this requirement, but as to the utility we gain in speaking in the language of essence-existence . To say that such-and-such has an essence and has an existence of such-and-such with the various actions, qualities and the like that it does, is to say nothing more than such-and-such a thing has such-and- such actions, qualities and the like. To speak, then, in terms of essence- existence allows us to do no more predicting, describing or explaining in our actual language than we can do without any reference to these terms. But surely the analogy of proportionality, as set forth in the Ca jetan tradition, purports to explain our use of some predicate-words, e.g., 'wisdom/ ' love / and the like, when applied to God and His creatures. When we say, 'God is good/ the analogy of proportionality tells us that what we mean is, 'The goodness of man is to his nature, or being, as the goodness of God is to His nature, or being/ In order to say this there is needed the language of essence-existence. But at best all that has been said is that the creature stands in a relation to things which are appro- priate to him, as God stands in a relation to those attributes which are appropriate to Him, assuming we can meaningfully speak about what is appropriate to God. If we allow that there is an existing God, then this is certainly a safe, but trivial statement to make. And it can be made, notice, without an appeal to the language of essence-existence. Further, to say that everything that is, is such that its essence is related to its existence, and vice versa, is to say that everything that is, is what it is. This, it must be admitted, is a bit redundant. Surely, if something is, then it is what it is. We do not need to appeal to essence- existence language to realize this. The postulated theory of essence- existence entitles us to say nothing more in our ordinary language than we could without it about things either created or uncreated. Notice once again that what is brought into question is the applica- bility of the theory. I am setting forth some considerations why such 59 Klubertanz, St. Thomas Aquinas on Analogy, pp. 122 - 123.</page><page sequence="25">The Cajetan Tradition of Analogy 203 essence-existence language need not be used for us still to be able to use our language as we do now. But to question the applicability of the essence-existence language is to question the third necessary require- ment60 of the analogy of proportionality. And this is surely to bring into question the third mode of analogy propounded by Cajetan and his followers. Conclusion In this paper I have presented Thomas de Vio Cajetan's theory of analogy. As pointed out by Fr. Copleston, "In his De nominum analogia Cajetan developed a view of analogy which has exercised a considerable influence among Thomists."61 In their introduction to the English trans- lation of De nominum analogia , Frs. Bushinski and Koren maintain: Cajetan's treatise points out the self-consistency of St. Thomas and how such difficulties and apparent contradictions may be solved. In view of all this it is not surprising that his work was generally accepted as the faithful interpretation and development of the Thomistic theory of analogy by nearly all Thomistic philosophers.62 We have seen that the general modus operandi of Cajetan may be called "reductionalism." He attempts to reduce all particular uses of analogy to one of three distinct modes of analogy; viz., analogy of in- equality, attribution or proportionality. The theory advanced, therefore, in De nominum analogia purports to be general and complete in the sense that any particular analogy can be described and explained by putting it into its correct category; i. e., by putting it into one of the three modes of analogy. Criticizing Cajetan, I suggest that a theory may be shown to have no explanatory effect at those points where it claims an unwarranted general applicability, or where it has an internal structural flaw, or both. Connected with the claim to explain all particular anal- ogies, is the claim of generality. Thus, I bring into question the attempt of Cajetan to reduce all particular analogies to exactly one of three modes. In order to do this, I introduced examples of analogies which do not exclusively fit into any one of the three modes. But to question the claim of complete generality is to question the explanatory usefulness of the theory and its application to particular examples of analogies. 60 See page 196 of this article. 61 Copleston, A History of Western Philosophy (Volume III), p. 338. 62 Cajetan, The Analogy of Names.

I also suggested that analogy of inequality and attribution require a theory of meaning which may be called the "identical minimal meaning" theory. Every word in order to be meaningful must name something which remains constant in every use of the word in question. Thus, 'animal' always refers to the same generic concept and can be predicated univocally of 'cat' and 'human.' But such a view cannot be maintained. Words, in general, do not name things, do not have identical, minimal meanings. They have various uses which may be said to com- prise a family.63 Some uses in a family overlap. Some do not. But there is no one, single thread running throughout all the various uses of, say, 'animal,' or 'game.' Turning to analogy of proportionality, I again questioned the useful- ness of the theory as having general explanatory import. Analogy of proportionality does not explain our talk, for example, about God. It does not aid us in understanding such phrases as 'God is good,' 'God is wise,' and the like. And, again to quote Fr. Copleston, "it is perhaps a little difficult to see how his [Cajetan] position does not lead in the end to agonisticism."64 Are there any dire consequences which follow from these suggestions I have presented ? James F. Anderson maintains that all ordinary con- versation would be impossible if the doctrine of identical minimal meaning is disregarded.65 And surely the modes of analogy of inequality and attribution would fail. But Anderson's position is somewhat rash. Even though we cannot maintain a doctrine of identical minimal meaning as described by Anderson and Cajetan, nevertheless, we can still meaningfully converse. We can still use words in our language in a variety of different ways and contexts. And, as far as our knowledge claims about God are concerned, we are at least no worse off than we were before the analogy of proportionality was introduced. We still make the same claims that we did, and still know just as much about them. To say that one theory is inadequate is not to assert that we have no knowledge of God, no meaningful assertions about Him. University of Georgia Frank R.
