<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS AND ABSTRACTS OF LITERATIURE Riddles of the Sphinx: A Study in the Philosophy of Humanism. F. C. S. SCHILLER. New and Revised Edition. New York: The Macmillan Co. 1910. No less than politics, philosophy is confirming the recent epigram: "Our old men are radicals, and our young men conservatives." Of the numerous contemporary illustrations of this in the field of metaphysics, none is more striking, and assuredly none more entertaining, than Mr. Schiller's new " Riddles of the Sphinx," which is at once more and less than the original edition of nineteen years ago; less in that it has suffered "a little toning down "-as the preface assures us-and more in that many annotations have been woven in. But the Sphinx changes not, nor do her riddles and their answers. " The central doctrines " of Mr. Schil- ler's volume " are essentially unchanged, and may be taken to attest the stability of the author's personality." This confession is true. The book is the old book, and Mr. Schiller's personality is stable-be it said to the confusion of those who have sneeringly described him as a flighty radical, fresh as May dew and no less evanescent. His philosophy reveals a mind respectful of the past and unshakable in its faith that the great questions were correctly put and answered centuries ago. This compliment will not</page><page sequence="2">300 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY be withdrawn in case Mr. Schiller pronounces it an abominable misunder- standing of his writings-which the reviewer fears he may do, inasmuch as his preface declares that humanism " has rendered more or less out of date every earlier work in metaphysics, in much the same way as the rise of evolutionism rendered out of date every pre-Darwinian book on biology." The gelluine conservative never dreams that the questions his an- cestors raised may have been altogether products of local and transient circumstances. Pragmatists, of course, not only dream this, but adduce some pretty convincing fulfilments of it; pragmatists are radicals, though, and Mr. Schiller wisely calls himself by another nlame. For he is strug- gling to reconcile (O blessed word!) philosophy, science, and religion. " Should we not cherish the hope of a final reconciliation of these three speculative activities, of such a harmony of all the elements of thought as is worthy of their common parentage (which, he says, is animism!), and as will enable all in the end to subserve in unison to the attainment of the perfect life? . . . May not the true religion be but the emotional aspect of the true philosophy? " Twenitieth-century people might suggest that religion is the hysterical aspect of befuddled philosophy, and that to " reconcile " its yearnings and visions with spectral analysis and amphi- mixis is about as profitable a pastime as reconciling hallucinations with normal, socially corrected testimony. Far be such impiety from the true ancestor-worshipper! The thorough conservative is, to the core, intellectualistic-so very intellectualistic that he suspects it not. He believes his feelings and con- duct are absolutely shaped, colored, and directed by reason; what he tbinks ouit concerning the drift and the nature of things in general-in brief, his conclusions about God, freedom, and immortality-will in- evitably make life endurable or unendurable, worth living or fit only to be quenched. And, furthermore, he believes that, if "the fundamental perversity or irrationality of all things" can be shown, he is plunged into pessimism, which is " the utter negation of life." This is the precise and mueb-repeated opinion of MIr. Schiller. It is the exact opposite of pragmatism, you will observe; for Mr. Schiller believes there is a " mean- ing " to life as a whole, whereas pragmatists most explicitly limit " mean- ilng " to a type of relation within the cognitive situation. " It is futile," says MIr. Schiller, "to bid us confine ourselves to this present world of phenomena. and to assure us that we have no interest to raise the question as to the nature of God and of our own future. . . . The sphere of positive science is not self-supporting, self-sufficing, self-explaining." And else- where: " The ideal of true humanism, and the ideal also of true science, would be realized when all our explanations made use of no principles wbich were not self-evident to human minds, self-explanatory to human feelings." Is this not the very essenlce of intellectualism? Can any other philosophy or philosophical method so exalt self-evident principles? Can any other maintain that, just because a concept is perfectly clear to us, we must interpret the universe through it? Surely, if Descartes suffered from vicious intellectualism, our humanist groans on the same bed with</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 301 him. It matters not what idea each thinker happens to think the clearest -be it the number series of Pythagoras, or the " Cogito " of Descartes, or the " Ego " of Mr. Schiller-the resulting philosophy is perverse intel- lectualism if everything in the world is either reduced to that idea or else so interpreted through it that whatever proves unintelligible in terms of it is pronounced unreal. The eminently respectable antiquity of humanism and its intellectual- istic root appear undisguised, first, in those ideas which seem self-evident to it, and secondly, in the problems which it ranks as most important. As to Mr. Schiller's self-evident first principles, they are professedly even more ancient than those generally favored by intellectualists; they are of the kind which " clings to the analogy of human agency." To anthro- pomorphism must philosophy hark back, Mr. Schiller believes; and why? Because " anthropomorphic means partaking of the nature of man. and what human reasoning can fail to render the peculiarities of the human reason? " We now may observe what strikes the author as self-evident: first, there is a knower and a known; and, secondly, like knows like, as Empedocles said. Many latter-day sinners find quite as much obscurity in these axioms as in Descartes's inference from " cogito " to " sum," or the pre-Socratic dichotomy, " being " and " not-being," or the doctrine that one is the perfect number, or the forbidding of beans to philosophers. They will likewise shrink from the axiom, " esse - percipi," implied un- mistakably in Mr. Schiller's entire discussion of "The Metaphysics of Evolution " where, at the end of his criticism of Sir William Crookes's hypothesis of elementary substance, Mr. Schiller says: " The protyle . . . is in reality a synonym for NOTHING; for it is devoid of all the charac- teristics of sensible reality. It is not tangible . . . nor audible . . . nor visible. . . . In short, it has no qualities that could render it in any way perceptible." So whatever lacks sense qualities is non-existent. Little novelty here! Rather the same old story which teachers of elemeintary logic use in their exercises on fallacies! One might point out the conservative intellectualisin of Book I., wherein, after showing that pessimism is the philosopher's most important problem, the humanist solves it to the glory of God and man. Pessiniism is the view that the world is either perverse or irrationial, thinks Mir. Schiller, and if the world is either, life is "negated," which, I suppose, means that it is somehow hampered, reildered nugatory. Pessimism preaches " the hideous and unalterable sordidness of life "; and few would care to survive to feel it long. Back of such an interpretation lies the extreme intellectualistic presupposition that a theory about the cosmic drift must regulate our practical attitudes, feelings, and conduct from moment to moment. If the world isn't engineered so as to guarantee unlimited bliss for all hands, your knowledge of this must logically per- vade your dinner, the evening at the theater, and to-niorrow's boat ride; must, in short, throw its lights or its shadows across each hour. The obvious retort that springs to modern lips is that, as a matter of psycho- logical fact, these lights and shadows do not fall upon men's paths as the logic of the case demands; Epicurus, Lucretius, and Professor Santayana</page><page sequence="4">302 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY are not the rare exceptions, they are rather the shining examples of the normal man's invincible indifference in practical life to the intellectual- ist's demand that we allow metaphysics to sour our breakfast porridge and paralyze the nerves which give us a good time. What may be truth of the cosmos through all the reaches of time is not, as a matter of fact, true of little spots in it at some brief moments; and men, who live and move only in little spots and only at brief moments, always have reacted and always will react only to these intimate near tracts of time and space. Pessimism is not a practical problem for anybody save an impractical person. This fact is highly conducive to useful optimism. The reviewer, in failing to discuss the questions raised by " The Riddle of the Sphinx," has proved unfair to its author; and he regrets that he is capable of nothing better than such injustice. But he is too strongly convinced that wayfarers should pay no attention to Sphinxes and their riddles. All Sphinxes are of the same breed as the Sphinx of Thebes, which used to ask: " What animal goes on four legs in the morn- ing, on two at midday, and on three in the evening? "-and sent those who answered wrongly to jump off a high cliff. Modern man, absorbed in making the world a more comfortable tavern, refuses to waste a minute over such riddles, much less to take his wrong answers so tragically. WALTER B. PITKIN.
