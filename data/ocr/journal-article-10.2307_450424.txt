<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Deslgn of Nature in Drayton's Poly-Olbion' STELLA P. REVARD Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion is usu- ally approached as a curiosity, the longest topological poem in English, curious in its antiquarian learning and still more curious in its apparent design to chart with a cartographer's accuracy every tract, river, mountain, forest, dell in Great Britain. Scholarly studies of Poly-Olbion-Gerhard Buchloh's Michael Drayton, Barde, und Historiker, Politiker nd Prophet andAliced'Haussy's Poly-Olbion, ou L'Angleterre Vue Par Un Elizabe6thain-have for the most part attempted to evaluate the poem in terms of its use of antiquarian materials.2 Yet, though we must be aware how Drayton's work is rooted in the historical traditions of Elizabethan England, we must not forget its poetical design. Drayton divided Poly-Olbion not into chapters or boks, but into songs, and consistently he subordinates whatever history he is recounting to the lyrical mode of these songs. In his preface, moreover, he promises readers pleasures of a poetical order. For our delight Drayton will create a perfect world of nature in which we may hear "harmless Shepheards .. . some exercising their pipes, some singing roundelaies, to their gazing flocks" and may see "dainty Nymphes in their simple naked bewties, bathing them in Crystalline streams."3 It is my aim to examine the design of this perfect world of nature. Before we inquire into overall design, however, it is wise to examine some particulars, for Drayton in writing topological pastoral is dealing with a very special kind of poetry. The nymphs and shepherds to whom he alludes in his preface are, of course, the actual features of the landscape anthropomorphized. Thus forest nymphs are not merely nymphs who inhabit forests, but the forests themselves; hill shepherds, not the conventional complainers upon 'A shortened version of this paper was read at the Central Renaissance Conference in Columbia, Missouri, March 29, 1974. 2Paul Gerhard Buchloh, Michael Drayton, Barde und Historiker, Politiker und Prophet (Neumunster, 1964); Alice d'Haussy, Poly-Olbion, ou L'Angleterre Vue Par Un Elizabtthain (Paris, 1972).

This genre of pastoral, which is of venerable ancestry, had newly been given voice in Drayton's time by Spenser in Colin Clouts Come Home Again and in Book IV, canto 11 of The Faerie Queene, the "marriage" of the Thames and the Medway. But Drayton's purposes in using topological pastoral are not those of his master Spenser. Whereas Spenser had used it as embellishment to complement the main action of the poem and had relegated it to set pieces, Drayton uses it as his principal device. Topological characters are the main characters in Drayton, topological "action" the only action of his poem. However these ladies and gentlemen of the landscape may resemble real or fictional heroines and heroes, they do not exist in Drayton's pastoral to call these to mind. Humanity has been excluded from Poly-Olbion except as topological characters themselves look at human beings and the world of men. Thus, Drayton's kind of pastoral requires some adjustment on the part of the reader. Held together as it is by a series of dramatic incidents in which the persons of the landscape are described as and act like human beings, Poly-Olbion consistently tempts the reader to view it as a pastoral masque in which "hills" and "rivers"' are merely human beings in fancy dress. For example, the reader at first regards Drayton's description of the love triangle involving the hill Clent, the forest Feckn'ham, and the river Salwarpe as the conventional conflict all too familiar in pastoral eclogue or romance. The forest Feckn'ham dotes upon the river, who takes no notice of her, being "from all affection free." The forest in turn is immoderately loved by the elderly hill Clent, who rues both her "fall" and her flight from him. Momentarily we see in Feckn'ham the fleeing maiden of Orlando Furioso or The Faerie Queene, who loves one knight distractedly only to be pursued by another. But only momentarily. What we really see is that the forest has left the hill-top barren of trees, which cluster instead about the nearby river. Feckn'ham, however fugitive her appearance, is not meant as the successor to Angelica or fair Florimell. Nor is Clent Roland as he loudly laments that the faithless forest has lavished her affections on an unworthy rival. How far from the world of romance we are as we hear a hill, vowing to forsake all pleasure, upbraid a "fallen" forest and threaten a river with vengeance: "Which when, most wilfull Nymph, thy chaunce shal be to see,/ Too late thou shalt repent thy small regard of mee" (XIV, 59- 60). Clent, of course, cannot carry out his threats; like the lover on Keats's storied urn frozen by art, Clent is frozen by nature. Drayton has created this little drama perhaps for the sheer fancy of it, perhaps to glance wryly at the absurdities of romance that it mimics. What is most important, however, is that in telling his story of rivalry and</page><page sequence="3">STELLA P. RE VARD 107 rejected love, he has taken care to "ground" it in topological truth. We see the landscape better, not worse, for Drayton's story. Consistently Drayton aims to transcend nature, to heighten it, to render it-as Sidney said the artist must-yet more golden, but never to deny it. Throughout Poly-Olbion, the distinctive quality of Drayton's pastoral is the ease with which it combines the real and the fanciful. For example, there is no contradiction for Drayton in describing Milford Haven both as a busy harbor and as a nymph over whose bosom ships glide. He can also celebrate Yarmouth alternately for its fishing industry and its nymphs adorned with coral. And the river Tivy is notable for her beauty and for her beavers and salmon-falls. Drayton is like the old makers of tapestries who employ the faces of real persons in the most intricate of mythological designs. The challenge for Drayton obviously was to interweave as finely as possible the colors of myth and reality in each song. Nowhere is this interweaving more skillful than in the thirteenth song, where the poet sings of his native Warwickshire. There in a single song we have geomorphic myth, social criticism, and natural idyll. The song begins with the introduction of the Forest of Arden, who as a venerable father speaks of the heritage of the land. Of all the Forrests heere within this mightie Ile, If those old Britains then me Soveraigne did instile, I needs must be the great'st; for greatnesse tis alone That gives our kind the place . .. (XIII, 29-32) But the Forest represents not only nostalgia for things past; as a bitter social reformer he denounces contemporary practices which have despoiled the land: cutting down trees, limiting and enclosing the forest, and setting villages so close by that deer are dislodged from their coverts. The lament for the lost beauty of the land is short-lived, however; what follows is an idyllic passage in which the present beauties of nature are evoked. Drayton describes the wood in early morning when men are preparing for a hunt. We hear first the choir of birds: "quirristers" are perched upon the "highest spray of every mounting pole" and "with their cleere open throats,/ Unto the joyfull Morne so straine their warbling notes" (XIII, 46-52). Now Drayton once more interrupts with one of his most characteristic digressions, the catalogue. Having evoked a mirthful choir of forest birds who fill the air with the sound of their harmony, he now must characterize each one. And so he does, showing how nature has marked the "Woosell" with its golden bill or particularized the</page><page sequence="4">108 POL Y- OLBI O N "Throstell" with the shrill sharps of its song. Curiously enough, Drayton's display of ornithological lore supports rather than destroys his forest idyll. The real birds with their individual color and characteristics remind us that Drayton is singing of an actual and not a mythical forest. Yet as he concludes the passage, it is myth that is liberally mixed with reality. The classical patroness of the hunt, Diana, appears wearing her bow and attired in green, not at all out of place in an English forest. The hunt she presides over is, of course, the classical hunt for the stag, the fittest quarry for the "chaste mightie Forrests Queene." The conclusion to this hunt is one of Drayton's most vivid pieces of realism. The stag at bay fights for his life, dealing deadly wounds to the "churlish throated hounds" with his sharp- pointed head. Only when we can bear it no more does Drayton soften this cruel and bloody picture with a touch of folklore. Conquered by the hunter, the stag weeps "precious tears" for his own death, tears, as Drayton tells us, which are medicinal. Drayton's pastoral in this Warwickshire passage has appealed to not one but many aspects of life. Surely inherent in his design, as the Greek word poly in his title implies, is the celebration of "manyness" and "muchness" of the land itself: its variety and wealth. As Drayton has shown us in this thirteenth song and as he continues to show throughout the poem, England is a land of abundant resources and experiences. She provides man with bodily sustenance and she sustains him with legend and history; she delights him with her manifold beauties and she inspires his poetry. Yet Drayton's design in Poly-Olbion transcends poetical celebra- tion of England's beauty and abundance. Drayton has so ordered his world of nature that we may see in it far more than the natural world beautified for so-called ornamental effect. Borrowing from Elizabe- than thought its favorite principle of hierarchy, Drayton has hierarchically organized the world of Poly-Olbion so that it mirrors English society, wherein sovereigns reign and subjects offer obedience. In Poly-Olbion the kings and queens are the mountains and rivers who dominate the land. To the mountains, hills and valleys bow in recognition of their highest station; to the rivers, streams and brooks offer tribute as handmaidens and attendants who feed and swell their waters. These kings and queens necessarily are absolute in that their right to reign is geomorphically if not divinely determined. Theirs is a right, moreover, universally recognized and seldom contested. For example, in Song 6 the highest of the Welsh mountains, Plynillimon, confidently receives homage from the lesser hills.</page><page sequence="5">STELLA P. REVARD 109 So all the neighboring Hills Plynillimon obey. For, though Moyladian beare his craggy top so hie, As scorning all that come in compasse of his eye, Yet greatlie is he pleas'd Plynillimon will grace Him with a cheerfull look. . . (VI, 124-128) Here Drayton has portrayed the happy relationship between subject and hierarchical lord, with the subject free in his praise and the lord secure in his acknowledged right and fearing no flattery. Plynilli- mon, moreover, is deserving of homage, for as the highest mountain he is the source for the great rivers, Severne and Wye. Moyladian honors him thus and loves Severne "as though his owne she were." In a more extended passage in the following song, Drayton elaborates upon the right of mountains to their kingly titles and prerogatives. Malverne himself, king of hills, is spokesman; mountains, he says, are majestic in their very nature: they rise "above the other soyles that Nature doth in-throne./ For Mountaines be like Men of brave heroique mind,/ With eyes erect to heaven" (VII, 88-90). The valleys indeed, lowlier and concerned with earthly desire, would not have existed except for the mountains. The rivers, as well, from humblest brook to the greatest of floods, have their "plentious Spring from Mountaine or from Hill" (VII, 98). The mountains are friends to man, serving as beacons to guide and refresh him as he travels. Finally, they are the haunts of the gods and the Muses, as Tempe, Helicon, Parnassus attest, and home of divine inspiration, as Sinai. Since Part 1 of Poly-Olbion was dedicated to Prince Henry, and Part 2 was to be dedicated to Prince Charles, Drayton may very well be suggesting that these future sovereigns emulate the mountains as models of heroic mind and wise majesty. As the world of nature offers the sovereign an ideal model for conduct, it also offers an instructive lesson on how to quell revolt. Even in Drayton's perfect world of nature, the right of hierarchical rule is sometimes contested. In Song 9 the nymphs of the lake revolt against the "haughtie Hills" which overshadow them. They are only subdued when the mighty Snowdon intervenes and by the sheer authority of his voice ends this faction against his kind. But the response of the "wise" vale is still more to the point, for she urges that the lordly mountains complement rather than oppress her nature. In nature differences in degree are mutually beneficial. The waters of the lake are supplied by the neighboring hills, whom the nymphs have threatened with revolt. Their revolt, therefore, is in a sense absurd. Similarly, it is absurd for a valley to complain of its low estate. Not only hierarchy, but common sense is served as each natural feature</page><page sequence="6">110 POL Y - OLBl O N accepts what it is and remains in its "natural" station. True revolt, of course, is not only unwise, but impossible; Drayton with fine good humor teaches the wilfull subjects of the natural world this lesson. In nature too even potentially violent rivalries are resolved, as we see in Song 1 with Drayton's account of the conflict between the river queens of the northern and southern landscape. In Devon, the Tamer is the principal river, marking the boundary between Devon and Cornwall and receiving the "tribute" from both counties. Drayton pictures her as a queen, who "swoopes along, with such a lusty traine," and suggests thus both the sovereign followed by attendant ladies and the main channel of a river fed by tributary streams. The drama arises when the Towridge, paralleling the Tamer's course, seems to offer contest to the greater river, and is stung by her scorn. A local river, the Ock, offers the Towridge wise counsel. Now Neptune shield (bright Nymph) thy beautie should be made The object of her scorne, which (for thou canst not be Upon the Southem side so absolute as shee) Will awe thee in thy course. Wherefore, faire flood recoile: And where thou maist alone be soveraigne of the soile, There exercise thy power . . . (I, 272-277) In response, the Towridge changes her course, and now running to the northern side, weds her lover the Tawe, and achieves her final destiny as she is enfolded into the protective arms of Father Neptune. Of course, Drayton's main purpose is to place the map of Devon before our eyes, outlining the alternate courses of its major rivers through the hilly countryside. Yet the political overtones of the pastoral drama are not to be neglected. Here is a world in which sovereignty is recognized and respected, and where rivalries are resolved naturally. It is unthinkable that the southern queen should execute her northern rival. Drayton mirrors in his pastoral the Elizabethan world of intrigue and passion, yet in his world of nature, the passions of political life are exercised harmlessly. The perfect world of nature checks the less than perfect impulses of its anthropomorphic deities. Violence is rendered not only harmless, but absurd. We might liken Drayton's satiric technique here to that which he uses in the fairy pastoral Nymphidia. There Oberon may jealously rave, but his murderous intent is limited in that he is armed only with a sword made of a hornet's sting and a spear from a horse- fly's tongue. Would that the violence of men could be likewise limited! So in Poly-Olbion Drayton has created a world not without</page><page sequence="7">STELLA P. REVARD 111 conflict, but one in which conflict truly is resolved for the better. The great rivers and mountains of the landscape reign with a kind of indisputable supremacy that even the great Elizabeth and her successor James might envy. Yet the design of Poly-Olbion reaches beyond expressing perfectly in nature the peaceful hierarchy of persons and things the Elizabethans and Jacobeans so longed for in their own society. Drayton's aim in Poly-Olbion was to create, as it were, a tableau in which the geography of the land becomes one with the history, the morality, the aesthetics of the people who inhabit it. And he has unfolded this design slowly over the course of the first eighteen songs of Part 1. Moving geographically from Cornwall to Devon to Wales and eastward to the Midlands, he recounts progressively the history of Great Britain, interspersing historical account with geographical commentary in the form of topological myth, and adding descriptive flourish, dramatic incident, and moral exemplum. His historical survey is artfully linked with his geographical, beginning in Song 1, when the "cleere Dert" opens the history, continuing with the Severne's account of the Britons and the Weaver's complementary account of the Saxons, and not concluding until Song 18 when the Thames ends the narrative with the triumph of the kings of England. The river Dert's account of the Trojan hero, Brute, provides far more than a retelling of ancient legend. Drayton lets us picture the river both as a native princess welcoming a foreign hero, as Lavinia would have welcomed Aeneas, and a female bard, calling upon her handmaidens to assist her in song. He has the river tell first of Brute's battle with the Giants. The native giants, which Brute must conquer, represent the rugged features of the Cornish coast. Corineus or Corin, Brute's general, defeats them, having engaged Gogmagog in a tremendous wrestling match which concludes with the giant being hurled with such force from the hill that he displaces with his fall the ocean from the strand. Brute as a reward bestows this displaced "horne" of land upon Corineus, naming it Cornwall in his honor. But he also tells us that although legend ascribes Cornwall's name to the victor Corin, an alternate etymology exists. As Drayton leamedly tells us in his notes, Cornwall may be named for its horn-like shape, corn being the equivalent of horn in most languages. However we decide, we recognize that Drayton in his so-called historical account has given us a rich and heady mixture of legend, geomorphic myth, and Renaissance learning, all in the form, we must remember, of a song sung by the river-princess-bard who is his historiographer. Drayton's treatment of the rivers also provides an example of the</page><page sequence="8">112 P O L Y - O L B I O N complexity of his design. There are two main rivers in the first part of Poly-Olbion: the Severne and the Thames, high queen and high king of Drayton's landscape. Upon them he lavishes his poetical attention. In Song 5, he describes Severne as a queen upon the throne, naming her Sabrine for the nymph most closely connected with her. Now Sabrine, as Queene, miraculouslie faire, Is absolutelie plac't in her Emperiall Chaire Of Crystall richlie wrought, that glorously did shine, Her Grace becomming well, a creature so Divine: . . . And where she meant to goe, The path was strew'd with Pearle: which though they Orient were, Yet scarce knowne from her feet, they were so wondrous cleere: To whom the Mermaids hold her Glasse, that she may see Before all other Floods how farre her beauties bee.... (V, 1-4, 16-20) In the strictest sense, the Severne represents for Drayton the heritage of Wales and the Briton past; she has been acknowledged queen of the Welsh countryside and patroness of Briton kings and queens. In this passage, however, the Severne also stands for Elizabeth, the most English of queens, and she is depicted-like Eliza in The Shepherd's Calendar-as a nymph of the pastoral world, queenly, beautiful, and chaste. But Drayton is not content with the triple role of pastoral- nymph, British patroness, and Tudor queen; he has yet another role for the Severne to play. In Song 5, recounting the boundary dispute between England and Wales over the Isle of Lundy, he has Severne the queen serve as arbitress. In delivering her judgment, she enunciates the important principle of Tudor destiny. Lundy belongs neither to England nor Wales, but to both and is a sign of the unity rather than the division of the land. She goes on to predict that the two countries shall further be joined, "grafted in the stock of great Plantaginet." The new line of English kings from Henry of Monmouth on are sprung from the "stock" of Wales grafted to that of England. And this first union is but the prologue to the second, when the "Steward stem" shall be joined to the Tudor and thus the "three sever'd Realmes in one shall firmlie stand" (V, 67). The above is, of course, familiar doctrine for a sixteenth- or seventeenth-century Englishman. What makes it more than political propaganda in Drayton's poem is that Drayton has made it appear as the voice of the land itself. What</page><page sequence="9">STELLA P. REVARD 113 better symbol of unity than a mighty and beautiful river which flows through both lands, serves in part as their boundary, and enriches them both! As Drayton moves into the final sections of the first part of his poem, he again uses the symbol of a river to further his design. Songs 15 through 18 of Poly-Olbion are devoted to the description of the Thames: his ancestry, the marriage of his parents, his own birth, and his triumphal upbringing and maturity. We move from the Cotswolds to Oxford to London and to the sea-and in so doing we move from the rural to the intellectual to the international scene. Drayton is undoubtedly deeply indebted to Spenser for many of the descriptions in these three songs; most notably his marriage of the Isis and the Tame depends upon Spenser's marriage of the Thames and the Medway. Yet the aim of the two poets is quite different. Spenser through celebration of the fruitfulness of nature is presenting symbolically the triumph of love and in his marriage of the Thames and the Medway is preparing for the spousals of Marinell and Florimell. Drayton celebrates not the triumph of human love but that of his own historio-geographical design. The marriage of the rivers, Tame and Isis, which results in the birth of the Thames is not without its symbolic and historical implications. Again Drayton is alluding to Tudor myth, for the Isis represents Elizabeth of York and the Tame, Henry of Lancaster. This marriage is both a union of the red and white roses of Lancaster and York and a symbol of the commingling of the thousand traditions and strengths which have made England the land of abundance and beauty that she is. In presenting the wedding, Drayton has other purposes as well. He is intent first to describe accurately the surroundings (the Cotswolds, the Chiltern Hills, the country about Oxford), and second to offer in this wedding his praise of the English country scene and country life. The bride Isis, who takes her course through peaceful and lovely landscape, is made to represent the physical beauty of the land; the groom Tame represents its wealth. The Chiltern Hills and Alsbury Vale are the "parents" of Tame, and Drayton makes repeated reference to their rural prosperity: "A isbury's a Vale that walloweth in her wealth." But Alsbury is also made the fussy rural matron: "lustie, frim, and fat, [who] holds her youthful strength" (XV, 27-30). She cannot be kept from "prodigall expense" in setting forth her son. She "feedes her Tame with Marle, in Gordiall-wise prepar'd" and endeavors to match or exceed the "expense" which the Cotswolds have lavished upon the bride. Clearly Drayton is portraying both the wealth of this sheep-grazing district and those wealthy rustics who inhabit it. We also have for a moment domestic comedy between</page><page sequence="10">114 P O L Y - O L B 10 N Alsbury, the wilfull wife and her more conservative husband, Chiltern, whose hoar and chalky head alternately calls to mind the white hair of an elderly countryman and the Chiltern's beechen woods. A typical anxious spouse, he chides his wife that her lavish expense breeds surfeit and cloys the stomach, besides being an extravagant waste. Drayton's account of the wedding is, of course, more than a rural comedy. He is writing a prothalamion, and as he describes the approach of the bride, we are given passages of pure lyric description. The scene is Oxford, and its spires tower soberly over the meadows and lend a classic tone to the invocation to the rural muses. Yee Daughters of the Hills, come downe from every side, And due attendance give upon the lovely Bride: Goe strewe the paths with flowers by which shee is to passe. For be yee thus assur'd, in Albion never was A beautie (yet) like hers: where have yee ever seene So absolute a Nymph in all things, for a Queene? (XV, 87-92) To describe both bride and groom, Drayton constructs intricate contrasting catalogues of flowers. The Tame is dressed in those flowers which spring "from the replenisht Meads, and fruitfull Pastures neere," Primrose, Hare-bell, Woodbind, Daffadilly, Cows- lip, Oxslip, Columbine-Drayton paints the wild meadows which border the Tame. For the Isis, he chooses those flowers which bloom in cultivated gardens along her route: Pansie, Mary-gold, Daysie, Button-batcheler, Sweet William. So simultaneously, he suggests the actual river-borders and a fanciful rural swain and his bride, adorned with flowers for a country wedding. The herbs are strewn, bride and bridegroom meet, a rural couple and coupling rivers, who join their "crystal" waters. "When as your crystall wasts you closely doe enfold,/ Betwixt your beautious selves you shall beget a Sonne,/ That when your lives shall end, in him shall be begunne" (XV, 102-104). Thames, begotten of this union, will carry on the "being" of the parents. Here is the familiar Elizabethan commonplace: the progeny is the second self of the parents, who perpetuates their beauty and strength. This Thames, however, will not only carry on the rural heritage of his parents, but will achieve international fame: the rivers of Europe will esteem him highly and "the Skeld, the goodly Mose, the rich and Viny Rheine,! Shall come to meet the Thames in Neptunes watry Plaine" (XV, 109-110). What begins in tone as a graceful wedding-song with the traditional compliments to beauty,</page><page sequence="11">STELLA P. REVARD 115 joy, and fertility ends as a paean to England's eternity. The Isis and the Tame are no mere bridal pair, who may expect a human and therefore impermanent futurity in their offspring; their child is eternally begotten and possesses a continuity of time and place which links him alike to the Britons and Saxons long dead and to generations unborn. No mere symbol of Tudor monarchy, he is England itself. Drayton's prothalamion concludes as the Charwell calls upon all of England's rivers to be present and to join in the celebration of England's unity by "uniting" one with another. Stand fast ye higher Hills: low vallies easily lie: And Forrests that to both you equally apply Retire ye to your wastes; and Rivers only we, Oft meeting let us mixe: and with delightfull grace, Let every beautious Nymph, her best lov'd Flood imbrace.... (XV, 225-230) But the rivers which Drayton has described are symbols not merely for England's unity, but for the world's. Rivers mark the seats of towns and havens, lend their names to the land, trace the boundaries of nations, and divide the "tripartited Ile" of England and the globe itself. Nations take their fame from their rivers, as India from the Ganges or Spain from the Tagus, and finally from the rivers of one's native land, one learns a valuable lesson. As the rivers are fed from the land, so is man. Like them, he is nourished in her bowels, grows and thrives as nature feeds him with the sacred power of goodness. Like them, he too must go forth to care for the land and to make it fertile through the power dispensed to him by nature herself. In showing how virtuous men, like the rivers, must nurture their land, Drayton once more has used topography to point a moral. The three remaining songs of Part I of Poly-Olbion return to a more specifically national theme, as Thames, king of rivers, flows on to London. Surveying the land with "awful empery," he passes by the great seats of monarchy, Windsor, Hampton Court, Westminister; Drayton takes the opportunity to describe the kingly houses which crown each bank, monuments of state and symbols of the wealth and power of England's monarchy. And now comes the penultimate catalogue of Part 1, as the kingly river sings of England's kings from William the Conqueror to Elizabeth, extolling particularly the latter's victory over the Spanish. Passing out of London, the Thames</page><page sequence="12">116 P O L Y - O L B I O N reassumes his rural demeanor, and Drayton turns from praising the riches of London to praising once more the beauties of an English countryside, rich, as Kent is, in harvest fruit. Another wedding awaits us: Thames weds the Medway, but this wedding is attended not with catalogues of flowers but with a catalogue of the warriors of England. So Part I ends as it began in rural Albion. With similar pastoral techniques Drayton continues his tour of England in Poly-Olbion, Part 2. Its twelve sequent songs survey the "northern parts of this isle." Still more nymphs and gods of landscape are introduced to us; still more local legends recounted (Robin Hood appears in Song 26); historical accounts continue (the battles of the Civil and Scottish wars are told); and catalogues abound, as diverse of those of marsh and sea birds or of Cambro- British and English saints. What is missing, however, in Part 2 is the sense of overarching design that characterized Part 1. Although Drayton is still partial to rivers as the dominant pastoral personali- ties, none of the rivers of Part 2 engage the interest nor are as symbolically vital as the Severne and Thames of Part 1. Nor does the poem move with the kind of narrative unfolding of Part 1, where the reader is made to feel the sense of historical and geographic progression as he journeys from Cornwall to Wales and finally to England. Nor is there a dramatic and lyric climax achieved such as occurred in Part 1 when the Isis and the Tame were wed with pastoral pageantry and the destiny of England assured with the begetting of Thames. Yet despite the shortcomings of Part 2, Drayton does attempt in Song 30 to unite both parts of his poem by evoking once more the perfect world of nature he had promised to create. He plants his paradise in Westmerland, for there wanders the brook Eden, whose name suggests the first perfect world. O my bright lovely Brooke, whose name doth beare the sound Of Gods first Garden-plot, th' imparadized ground, Wherein he placed Man, from whence by sinne he fell. O little blessed Brooke, how doth my bosome swell, With love I beare to thee. .. (XXX, 69-73) In Eden, however, Drayton appeals to more than the memory of paradise; he alludes to the glories of England which he has labored to include in his poem. Near Eden's bank, seventy-seven stones stand in a ring, each stone ten feet in height, and enclosed within these stones the bones of men long dead. The victory for which this monument</page><page sequence="13">STELLA P. REVARD 117 was erected has been lost in the "dark oblivion" of time. Nearby, there is a "little rising Bank, which of the Table round,/ Men in remembrance keepe, and A rthurs Table name" (XXX, 330-331). The world of nature guards the relics of man's past and renews man himself, doing, in effect, what Drayton has attempted to do in his poem. And on that note Drayton concludes his "strange Herculean toyle." "Faire Eden" meets the attending floods which "downe from the Westerne Sands into the Sea doe fall"; to this obscure little brook, Drayton has entrusted the task of bringing his pastoral design to a fitting conclusion.
