<plain_text><page sequence="1">David L. Hall Praxis, karman, and creativity Ten years ago Professor Eliot Deutsch wrote, in the preface of his Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Reconstruction,' of the need for comparative philo- sophy to enter into a phase of creative thought in which the resources of exoteric philosophies would be used for the purposes of speculative construction, supplementing those exegetical pursuits which illumine the significance of a work in situ, and the apologetic exercises aimed at illustrating novel concepts and theories absent from one's own tradition, as well as researches into peren- nial themes and issues in philosophy construed as a transcultural enterprise. I fully endorse Deutsch's recommendation and have sought to follow it in this article. I have done so by bringing to bear philosophic notions from both Oriental and Anglo-European traditions upon a specific issue of some impor- tance for my own particular theoretical reflections. That issue concerns the meaning of praxis and its relations to the concepts of karman and creativity. A survey of the history of Western philosophy indicates that the dominant conceptions of praxis in the Anglo-European tradition have included the following: actions in accordance with principles of knowledge or understanding (Plato, the Idealists); actions in conformity to the will of the individual agent (Sophists, Existentialists); actions in response to problematic situations from which principles may be abstracted (Aristotle, the Pragmatists); and activity leading to production aimed at meeting natural needs (Marx). In the first sense, true knowledge provides the criterion for practice since, "to know the truth is to do the truth." In the sophistic and pragmatic senses practice is defined directly in terms of action. In Marxian philosophy, practice involves a making of the character which defines its relevance. These senses of praxis are due to the dominance in our tradition of the notions of knowing, doing, and making as the primary functions of the human psyche. It is interesting to note that one possible meaning of praxis has been omitted from the Anglo-European tradition. An ambiguity in the concept of action has allowed for this omission. Activity, directly considered, involves either a doing or a making. But the conception of making may be construed along either economic or aesthetic lines. Stressing economic productivity in one's analysis of the notion of praxis leads to a focus upon making per se. If, however, aesthe- tic productivity were to be used as the basis for speculations upon the meaning of praxis, it would be necessary to have recourse to the distinction between making and enjoying common to discussions of aesthetic experience and expression. Translating the conception of productivity from the sphere of economics into that of art, we find that the "needs" which give rise to pro- ductions in the economic sphere are analogous to the "enjoyments" which David L. Hall is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Texas at El Paso.

This notion of praxis requires its interpretation in terms of aisthesis as creativity. The primary reason for the neglect of this view of praxis is that our traditional conceptions of "activity" or "practice" have been most decisively influenced by the agonal spirit of the Greeks. Actions express principles, the defense of which is the purpose of the acts. This political concept of action has determined more than our understanding of politics. Actions aimed at the attainment of individual greatness are the subject matters of history, which, for all our intel- lectual posturings, we have always predominantly understood as a story of the deeds of great men, rather than a history of ideas, or institutions, or material forces. Actions, whether as sources or consequences of principles, are activities of self-revelation and because of this the act should, so we believe, be such as to reveal greatness, not triviality. "Because of its inherent tendency to disclose the agent together with the act, action needs for its full appearance the shining brightness we once called 'glory.' "2 The desire for fame turns out to be not (pace Milton) "the last infirmity of noble mind," but, rather, is itself the pre- supposition of nobility. We find that the Hebraic roots of our conception of action are no less signi- ficant in determining our attitudes toward practice. The Western conception of "the domination of nature" is grounded in the belief in a creator God Who deputized human beings as caretakers of his created order, but Who then cursed His human creatures with the necessity of labor because of the prideful self-assertion resulting in the stolen awareness of good and evil which separated them from the rest of nature. Action turns out, ultimately, to be only a sub- limation of labor, which advertises its origins in the enmity between persons and nature. In either the Greek or the Hebraic sources of the concept of action we find a disposition to construe practice in relation to the agonal spirit which defines the quest for greatness in the political sphere or the domination of nature in the sphere of "economics." This agonal interpretation of praxis has affected the notion of creativity providing the notion of aesthetic production with aggressive overtones. Creativity is characterized in terms of the presumedly more fundamental notion of power. Creative activity, on this view, is seen to be a making in the sense of a determining form of efficacy. There is a world of difference, however, between the meaning of power and that of creativity. Whereas "power" often has the connotations of domination and control, "creativity" can only be characterized in terms of self-actualization. Unlike power relationships which require that tensions among component elements be resolved in favor of one of the components, in relations defined by creativity there is no otherness, no separation or distancing, nothing to be overcome. Creatio ex nihilo, as it is normally understood, is in fact the paradigm of all power relationships since the creative element of the relation is completely in control of its "other," which is in itself literally nothing.</page><page sequence="3">59 There can be no creation from nothing unless "nothing" is given coequal status alongside "something," that is to say, unless being and nonbeing are seen as polar concepts defining an organic unity which is becoming. Thus there can be no temporalizing the notion of creativity in terms of a movement from nonbeing to being. A polar relationship has no beginning; to claim otherwise would be to provide some concept of "initiation" and, thus, to give priority to one of the elements in the creative relationship. The distinction between power and creativity underlies the distinction between polarity and dualism. The greater the emphasis upon power, the greater the importance of the notion of duality as defining relationships. Creativity, on the other hand, requires that each element of a relationship is continually in the state of creating the other. The Taoist conception of the yin-yang relationship considered in terms of Western conceptions of passivity and activity illustrates the contrast very well. Yin and yang are moments in a creative process. The aesthetic interpretation of experience and nature pre- cludes the necessity of dividing events into those which express and those which experience the efficacy of an action. Aisthesis (aiOOtltq) originally meant simply, "perceiving the external world through the senses." Aisthetikos (ca'itOrTIKog) means "being preoccupied." It is the sense of being preoccupied with the world as sensuously perceived that grounds the concept of aisthesis. One way of appropriating this term for use in philosophical understandings of praxis is by noting that modern theories of perception, particularly those of twentieth-century process philosophers, have increasingly depended upon the analysis of perception at levels more primitive than the conscious and the conceptual. The objects perceived are the facts of experience; the manner in which they are perceived defines the sense of the world. The objective content of experience is received via a sub- jective form of feeling which characterizes the manner of the perceiver's preoccupation with the world. And it is precisely the manner of preoccupation which largely determines the nature and direction of one's interpretation of the world. The experience of "causal efficacy" as discussed by Whitehead,3 the characterization of Dasein in terms of Sorge, or "care," considered by Heidegger,4 Bergson's "intuition,"5 and Jose Ortega y Gasset's distinctive meaning of "perspectivism," 6 all depend upon some notion of "preoccupation" interpretable in terms of the subjective form of feeling the world.7 Praxis as aisthesis is to be understood fundamentally in terms of processes of self- creativity which are grounded in perceptual perspectives defining the form of preoccupation with the world. It is easy enough to understand why the interpretation of praxis as aisthesis has not been accorded much attention in Western thinking, since it construes human agency along what appear to be passive rather than active lines. Aisthesis emphasizes suffering an action or enjoying a production, rather than forms of doing and making grounded in acts of construal. Interpreting praxis as</page><page sequence="4">60 Hall creativity seems to provide an unacceptable alternative to traditional concep- tions of thinking, acting, and making, since it interprets these functions in nonaggressive terms and thereby challenges the agonal interpretation of human agency. The relevance of the concept of "karman" to this discussion of praxis as aisthesis may now be noted. Interpreting praxis normatively as creativity entails the suggestion that the value of human agency may be judged in terms of the relative degree to which one is able to move from power-oriented actions toward self-creative activities. Creativity, as I have discussed it, involves the transcendence of causal consequences. The ultimate goal of creativity is the transcendence of self understood as a source and terminus of causal activity. "Karman," understood as actions and their consequences, suggests the same problematic as that presupposed by my discussion of praxis-namely, the discovery of means of liberation from bondage to the consequences of human agency. The problem is one of transcending causal determinations. The concept of karman adds a moral and spiritual dimension wholly omitted from objectivist accounts of causality presupposed by theories of the physical and social sciences. These theories invariably abstract from the agonal, and therefore anthropomorphic, origins of our understandings of cause and consequence. In the critique of the notion of "causality" which follows, the karmic problem-the problem of causation construed morally and spiritually- will provide the implicit background of the discussion. One of the primary determinants of the character of our understandings of the nature of the things is our prejudice in favor of order and regularity. This prejudice received its classic expression in Aristotle's discussions of the concept of "the accidental." "We must first say regarding the accidental, that there can be no scientific treatment of it. This is confirmed by the fact that no science-practical, productive or theoretical-troubles itself about it."8 A science, as an organized way of knowing, has as its proper subject matter that which occurs always or for the most part.9 Accidental occurrences are neither always nor for the most part; therefore they cannot constitute the objects of any science. In the sphere of knowledge or practice, when we establish a selection of objects or events as the subject matter of our inquiry or the field of our actions, we presuppose principles of knowledge or conduct. Meanings or activities within this context which cannot be conveniently understood or directed in accordance with our principles seem haphazard, accidental, and uninteresting. Thus, accidental events are without a principle or cause, in the proper sense. Considering unprincipled events with accidental "causes" is not presumed to be a valuable enterprise in our culture due to our reinforced disposition to seek regularities in nature and experience. Accidents constitute a species of contingency, which is itself a context-bound</page><page sequence="5">61 category. A law of nature operates within a given context characterized by the conditions defining the sphere of relevance of the law. This means that a law is in effect only to the degree that we are able to ignore the contingencies operating outside the context defined by the law. Also, it should be clear that contingencies are recognized by abstracting from the idea of necessary con- nection in precisely the same way that causes are recognized by abstracting from contingencies. Aristotle's claim that there can be no science of the acci- dental is grounded in the assumption that there is no productive means of investigating phenomena which are identified by abstracting from the idea of necessary connection. A theoretical perspective characterizes a world in a specific way which produces the context within which some issues or items are deemed interesting and others not. Among the events in nature whose relations are considered interesting or relevant there are causal connections defined by the theory itself. A theory determining that the world is comprised by other kinds of entities or events would also determine what other kinds of causal connections obtain. Since "the causal laws that a thing satisfies constitute a fundamental and inseparable aspect of its mode of being," 1 alterations in the answer to the question "What kinds of things are there?" will lead to the development of different characterizations of causal laws. Causes certainly are connected with effects; but this is because our theories connect them, not because the world is held together by cosmic glue. The world may be glued together by imponderables, but that is irrelevant for understanding causal explanation. The notions behind "the cause x" and "the effect y" are intelligible only against a pattern of theory, namely, one which puts guarantees on inferences from x to y. 1 That causal laws are theory bound can only mean that the principle of sufficient reason is a heuristic principle at best, one which determines that causal explanations may always be profitably sought, but which makes no claim about the adequacy of this or that theoretical context serving to guarantee the discovery of causes. That is to say, the principle of sufficient reason turns out to be an inference which is entailed by any theoretical context, simply because a theory is a systematic structure of propositions from which a specific complex of inferences may be generated. As "inferential nets," theories can always be seen to guarantee the discovery of sufficient reasons. The principle of sufficient reason generalizes our sense of the unbiquity of causal relationships, but cannot, without additional support, guarantee that these relationships all obtain within the same theoretical context. Leibniz supplemented his discussions of sufficient reason with the arguments for the notion of a privileged order, "the best of all possible worlds." The interrelations of the principle of sufficient reason and the ontological claims about the</page><page sequence="6">62 Hall nature of this actual world as rationally and morally preferable to its alternatives, establish an argument for the belief that the production of order from the chaos of possibilities required an exclusive selection. Viewed ontologically, the principle of sufficient reason makes a claim that all entities or events are ordered in such a manner that any item may receive an explanation in terms of some other item or items. Viewed from the epistemo- logical perspective, the principle claims that the act of knowing necessarily involves the construal of the objects of knowledge in such a way to allow for the articulation of causal connections. It is possible to question the metaphysical assumptions of any proposition or theory on the grounds that the status of objects or events in nature is always inadequately characterized. If this is done it is easy enough to show that alternative conceptions of causality and of the types of causal connections obtaining within a given context are always possible. At least some of these causal sequences or orders may be shown to be incon- sistent with the initial order. At this point the inability to resolve the issue of inconsistent causal explanations is shown to be a result of incompatible theore- tical contexts which is but to demonstrate that sufficient reasons are theoretical entities as surely as are the entities or events accounted for in specific theoretical contexts. This places the burden of understanding upon the concept of "theory" itself. It is the theoretical disposition which needs explanation. The disposition to ask for reasons or causes is part and parcel of the need to be able to predict and control events to achieve successful adjustments to one's ambience, or to determine the character of one's ambience through causally efficacious action. The aesthetic interpretation of praxis, however, entails the primacy of dispositional states which, ultimately, do not necessitate raising the question of causal determination. In place of knowing, doing, and making as acts of construal characterized by a power orientation, creative activities provide a dialectical alternative in which knowledge, action, and production are nonaggressively defined. The most direct manner of under- standing this dialectical alternative is by attending to certain Taoist notions of human personality and agency. The familiar conceptions of wu-wei (non- instrumental action), wu-chih (unprincipled knowing) and wu-yii (objectless desire), express just the dialectical alternative suggested by our aesthetic interpretation of praxis. This Taoist "no-soul" doctrine requires that human agency be characterized by the pursuit of nonattachment rather than control and domination. However attractive this dialectical alternative to traditional conceptions of praxis might be, it has what most would consider to be a fatal flaw-namely, it is not wholly rationalizable. To be more specific, the vision I have adumbrated is not theoretically construable in any direct manner since it is not metaphysi- cally generalizable either in terms of a coherent set of principles or in terms of a single ontological structure. That is to say, this vision of experience as nor-</page><page sequence="7">63 matively aesthetic is grounded neither in scientia universalis nor in ontologia generalis. My interpretation of praxis as aisthesis cannot presuppose a "universal science" for the simple reason that it is an-archistic. That is to say, it is "without principles" in the traditional sense of external determining sources of order.12 Each event in process of becoming is its own arche. Creative actions, as opposed to the agonal or power-oriented variety, function neither as causes nor as consequences of anything outside themselves. Each event in process of becom- ing is its own "principle" and the principle of nothing else. Obviously, the normative statement I have just made cannot itself function as a principle, for if it is "obeyed" it ceases to be a principle in the accepted sense. The vision I am presenting can no more be expressed in terms of a "general ontology" than it can in terms of a "universal science." It presupposes no ontology in the classical sense because it denies the existence of a logically coherent ontological structure-that is, it denies that the world is one. The philosophy of creativity requires that there be as many actualizable worlds as there are events in the process of becoming. The sum of these ordered worlds (which itself can have no logically coherent order) is Becoming-Itself. Both Being and Nonbeing must be characterized relative to the notion of Becoming. They are abstractions from Becoming-Itself as the Totality. Being, as a generic notion, is defined as any single order abstracted from the sum of all orders. Traditional notions of Being per se assume a unitary cosmic order, authored by a single Absolute Agent, defined by a single set of natural laws, or evolving in relation to a single end or logically coherent set of ends. Our "aesthetic ontology," however, finds such a single-ordered world unacceptable. Just as Being is defined in relation to Becoming-Itself, so may Nonbeing be characterized in relation to Being. Nonbeing is simply all other orders, or aspects of other orders, whose otherness is construed relative to that order presupposed as Being. Thus Becoming-Itself is the sum of all orders-both those which are and those which are not. Becoming is a mixture of Being and Nonbeing, and the Totality of all becomings is Chaos as that which is possessed of no specific order, and is therefore passive to form. The intuition of Chaos as that which is indifferent to any particular order is the experience of sunyat-- emptiness. Though this aesthetic vision violates certain fundamental rules of logic and rationality, it does have the virtue of answering to certain of our pervasive moral and spiritual intuitions which have as deep-seated an origin as our disposition toward theoretical consistency, and have at least as strong a claim to serving that which is most noble in human experience. It is the karmic problem which this aesthetic vision so clearly resolves, for it promotes the transcendence of cause-effect relationships which require the construal of the world as a single order rather than as Becoming-Itself, the sum of all orders.</page><page sequence="8">64 Hall The cultivation of dispositional states-wu-wei, wu-chih, and wu-yii-which increase one's sensitivity to the differential excellence (te) possessed by each event within one's ambience promotes the attainment of an experience of the aesthetic harmony of all events in the process of becoming. This experience lies at the basis of all pure mystical visions, and therefore grounds the primary expressions of the philosophia perennis. It is best appreciated from a sense of the karmic problem. For in the desire to transcend causal determinations we find perhaps the principal dynamic leading to the experience of Chaos, of Becoming-Itself. This experience of "emptiness," (iunyata) finally leads to nirvana as the uncaused and inconsequential ground of all becoming. NOTES 1. Honolulu: (The University Press of Hawaii, 1969). 2.

Sophisticated Marxists may be quick to point out that the interpretation of praxis as aisthesis seems to recall Feuerbach's reconstruction of materialism which demanded perception be substi- tuted for abstract thinking as the materialist form of entertaining the world. It was over against this view that Marx introduced the conception of sensuous activity as defining praxis. The reply is obvious: I am not supporting a materialist doctrine here. If I were I would not be stressing such notions as "the subjective form of feeling," or "preoccupation." It is precisely the poverty of materialism in handling such notions that forced Marx to import an incoherent methodological tool (the Hegelian Dialectic) into his theory to provide a dynamic interpretation of praxis. 8.
