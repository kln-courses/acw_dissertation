<plain_text><page sequence="1">God God and Nature, by G. F. Stout. Pp. liv-l-389. Cambridge University Press, 1952. 35s. net. This posthumously published work is the long-promised second volume of its distinguished author's Gifford Lectures, of which the first appeared as long ago as 1931, under the title Mind and Matter. The original lectures were delivered two years earlier; but the two books which he designed to embody their teaching were not intended to be transcrip tions of either of the courses to which his Edinburgh audiences had listened in 1919 and 1921 respectively. God and Nature (the title was Stout's own choice) now appears under the editorship of the lecturer's son (himself, like his father, a professor of philosophy), along with a memoir written by a former colleague of the editor in the University of Sydney, Prof. J. A. Passmore. Will Prof. Alan Stout permit one who in</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 291 the year of his birth reached the mezzo cammin di nostra vita to indulge in a reminiscence which might at first sight seem disrespectful to him self? As Prof. Passmore records, George Frederick Stout became in 1899 the first Wilde Reader in Mental Philosophy at Oxford, and thereupon married. Oxford, whether or no it was, as Stout's biographer tells us, only then lately persuaded by Stout himself and Alexander 'that there might after all be such a subject as Psychology' (although that word, which the founder of the Readership disliked and suspected, was not used in the title of his office), fully recognized that the newcomer in fact respresented that branch of knowledge with its empirical interest in the development of mental life in children; and when, a year later, the Reader's son was born, his father's colleagues (of whom the present reviewer is one of the few still surviving) dubbed him at once the Psychological Infant, providentially ordained to illustrate his parent's expected discussions of that topic. No better election could have been made to the new Readership than that of Stout; for Henry Wilde's express intention was not to encourage experimental psychology, but to endow the study of 'mental philosophy' according to the method of John Locke; and Stout, while fully acknow ledging the value of experiment in psychology, did not regard it as the only, or even as the principal method to be used in the exploration of the human mind; this was rather the observant analysis of common experi ence, such as was exemplified in Locke's classical Essay. This is not, of course, to suggest that the results of his own analysis did not differ in important respects—to which Prof. Passmore calls attention in his Memoir—from the conclusions reached by Locke himself. The book now before us contains Stout's ripest reflection on the great problems of philosophy. These were for him what they had been for Kant, and not those questions of purely logical analysis and linguistic expression which seem to not a few of our contemporary thinkers alone to hold out a hope of receiving significant answers. His examination of them here, it must be remembered, did not undergo such a final revision by himself as the immediate prospect of publication would have de manded; but it was his own desire that any material which he left should be edited by his son. In this review I shall not dwell upon the epistemo logical discussions which occupy a great part of the volume, but shall in the main confine myself to the contribution made in it to Natural Theology, and so of special interest to readers of this Journal. A passage quoted in the editor's preface from the earlier book based on the Gifford Lectures, which was published in his lifetime and called Mind Mind and Matter, shows that the argument against Materialism de veloped in that work was intended to lead up to a defence of Theism in</page><page sequence="3">292 REVIEWS the sequel. Stout had maintained that Mind must be fundamental in the Universe of Being and not derivative from anything that is not Mind. 'If we discard "mind-stuff" theories as failing to account for individual selves, and monadism as failing to account for anything else, we are bound to posit one universal and eternal Mind, developing and express ing itself in the world of finite and changeable beings which we call Nature.' If this Universal Mind 'be ascribed to Nature itself, this implies that Nature, in spite of the endless multiplicity of distinct existences which it comprehends, is a self-contained unity. Any such view seems to break down under intolerable difficulties. The alternative is, to deny that Nature is the entire Universe of Being, and to recognize that it can not exist at all or be what it is, apart from a Being beyond it and distinct from it. This Being . . . must be an eternal and universal Mind, giving to Nature, through and through, a character which is otherwise inex plicable' (p. xxi). When Stout comes in due course to consider in detail the conception of such a Mind, he finds that, as determining the whole course of nature, it must be thought of, if it be thought of at all, as knowing and willing; yet not as acquiring information, or doubting, or erring, or, again, as 'changing its mind'; its knowledge must be completely unified, its will one and undivided. But, though there can be no change or succession in the Universal Mind, this is not to be interpreted as denying reality to the world of change and succession, or as reducing it to a mere 'appearance' of a timeless and changeless 'Reality'. Its being is real, although dependent and derivative, and the change and succession which characterize it are known and willed as such by the Mind upon which it depends. Stout, however, diverges from the tradition of Chris tian theology in denying that God (as, although at first, when he has not yet introduced ethical and religious considerations, he avoids the name, he does not in later chapters hesitate to call the Universal Mind) is to be regarded as the creator of matter. Matter, in his opinion, does not proceed from mind, but should rather be considered co-ordinate with it. This view is, of course, by no means new; but it has usually been associated with the thought of an element in reality in some degree recalcitrant to, or at least as limiting, the activity of the spiritual element or factor with which it is contrasted. Stout, however, supposes Matter, although not created by God, to be entirely transparent to the divine intel ligence and entirely subject to the divine control; thus, he thinks, its fun damental independence is inconsistent neither with the omniscience nor with the omnipotence of God, so that religion has no interest in deny ing it. A view which has recommended itself to a mind so acute and original as Stout's is not to be rejected without the most careful con</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 293 sideration; but I am not satisfied that it would not be found in the long ran to require the recognition of a third Being implied in the eternal relation existing between the Divine Mind and the uncreated matter which it knows and controls; nor am I convinced that the 'religious consciousness' does not demand that its object be not merely omniscient and omnipotent, but the source of all reality, even though there be realities distinguishable and distinct from it. With the Russian thinker Dr. Frank, in the lately translated work called in English 'God with Us', I would suggest that the rejection of pantheism allows us to accept what he calls a panentheism, which will meet at once the two requirements, at first sight mutually discrepant, yet both, as I see it, inevitably involved in a genuine religious experience, of a finite soul which, with its finite environment, confronts God as a distinct being; and, on the other hand, of a God, beyond and independent of whom there is no reality, in whom all that we can distinguish from him 'lives and moves and has its being'— a being derivative and dependent indeed, yet not illusory, nor (to recall a phrase used by some idealistic philosophers) merely adjectival. It is clear that, for Stout, the consideration of Nature as a system, the 'nature' investigated by the 'natural' sciences, will inevitably lead the philosopher to the thought of its dependence upon some Being which transcends it, although, apart from morality and religion, we should neither feel the full cogency of such an inference, nor be able to give to the conception of the Being thus inferred the content which we associate with the word 'God'. He is fully alive (as was also Alexander) alike to the resemblance and to the unlikeness between our experience of other persons and our experience of Deity. He was not afraid of calling our knowledge of other persons 'inferential'; yet he did not, as some have done, suppose the data from which we infer their existence to be merely the perceived form and movements of their bodies, but based it on their 'responsive behaviour'. In the case of God there is no such observable behaviour—'no voice, nor any that answers'—but as, with other persons, the evidences of their reality lies, and lies only, in the unique experience of a rapport whereof we are immediately aware and the reality of which is indubitable, so apart from the actual experience of communion with God—if only in the form of an inescapable sense of being 'in a presence'—our recognition of imperfection and incompleteness in the world perceived by sense would remain an uneasy feeling of unsatisfied want. Besides pointing out resemblances and dissimilarities between reli gious and social experience, Stout has some interesting observations on the analogies which exist between the religious and another form of spiritual experience, the aesthetic. This, while mediated through the</page><page sequence="5">294 REVIEWS senses, reveals in the world thus perceived characters or values whereof the mathematical and physical sciences have nothing to tell us. 'Aesthetic appreciation and enjoyment', we read (p. 253), 'and the general view of the world which pervades them and makes them possible, are, if not logically incompatible with the abstractly scientific way of thinking, at least sentimentally opposed to it.' He treats excellently the objection sometimes made to taking this view of the world seriously. '1 fully admit', he says (p. 254), 'that in detail the aesthetic interpretation of nature as animated by mind is in the main a play of imagination. But I cannot admit, and it would be suicidal for the poet or artist himself to admit that it is mere play. The aesthetic imagination cannot sustain itself, and cannot maintain its claim to be a fundamentally important form of human activity, unless it presupposes its fiction to be rooted and grounded in the real being of things.' Take such lines as those of Words worth concerning 'something far more deeply interfused' ('far more', that is, than the 'still, sad music of humanity' to which we might plaus ibly regard nature as in truth indifferent). 'Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean and the living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man.' Here, as Stout says (p. 255), 'the poet ceases to be merely a poet and stands on the threshold of religious experience, if he has not already crossed it.' On the grand difficulty which must ever perplex the minds of all who, having in their own religious experience found God, cannot without contradicting what to them is thus assured truth, deny his existence, namely, the undeniable presence and seeming prevalence of evil in the world, Stout has some things to say which are worth saying: 'Evil and good are mutually contrary. The good as such cannot be evil, nor the evil as such good. Yet the complete good, though its good ness can never be evil, must in some way include the evil which we actually find in the universe. The good must be essentially incomplete without the evil, and the evil essentially incomplete without it' (p. 313). 'Place a man in circumstances such that his every wish and impulse is fulfilled as soon as formed; instead of the highest good the results are moral stagnation and decay, and the unrest of satiety. Good could come to such a man only if he set himself to fight against these evils' (viz. 'obstacles to strive and struggle against') 'and overcome them' (p. 314). 'Note that evil can fulfil this function only if it be really evil and treated as such. If the struggle against it is good, it cannot itself be good. It must be uncompromisingly opposed and hard, never tolerated or welcomed. Fighting a cholera epidemic may bring out all that is best in a man. But it would not do so, if he himself caused or permitted it to occur in order to use it as a means to his own moral development' (ibid.). 'It fulfils this</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS 295 function only inasmuch as it awakes in us unbounded horror and loath ing and arouses us to uncompromising antagonism' (p. 317). 'If optimism consists in attempting to make light of evil or to explain it away, then certainly I am no optimist. But in another and deeper sense, the view I have been expounding is the most thoroughgoing optimism conceiv able. For on this view evil is working separate from or independent of good. It has being only in the development of the good as a struggle against it. It is thus included and transcended by the complete good, which is eternally opposed to it and eternally victorious over it. Hence the vastness of evil, indefinitely surpassing the utmost efforts of finite beings to express in words, or to match in imagination, is an indication of the incomprehensible immensity of the good which transcends and includes it, and makes it all worth while.' (ibid.). In this thought of *victory' as an indispensable element or factor in the true good, which is thus unintelligible apart from that over which the victory is won, we may perhaps recognize the only suggestion which has any promise of solving the greatest of all problems (this thought lay, I think, at the very heart of William Temple's faith). It is on this note that Stout's meditations in God and Nature end. The suffering in finite beings which is incidental to their struggle for the victory which 'makes all worth while' must, he suggests, 'have its counterpart in the Divine nature'. Hence 'the appeal made to the religi ous consciousness by the Christian doctrine of a crucified God' (p. 325). Theologians will be interested in the final sentences of the book, which reject Patripassianism. 'It is significant that the Christian creed corrects what might otherwise be too anthropomorphic in its teaching by holding that it is God the Son and not God the Father who suffers. In one aspect of His nature He is truly represented as participating in the misery of finite being. In another He is eternally triumphant and enjoys eternal blessedness.' Kant held, as is well known, that the question of our own destiny— 'what we can hope for'—was one of the three great problems of meta physics. I am convinced that any tolerable defence of the belief in immortality must make it depend upon the belief in God and not the other way round; and this is, I think, also Stout's view. 'Our psychical being', he writes (p. 239), 'at any moment of our existence, is in great part only potentially in our possession; it is, so to speak, held in trust for us by our Creator and Preserver. "About us and around us are the everlasting arms." The hope of immortality is the hope that, in some way which we need not waste time in guessing, the same support will be continued or renewed after death.' The demand, he writes again (p. 322), that 'evil, so far as it affects a finite individual, must be over</page><page sequence="7">296 REVIEWS come, if at all, in and for the very individual who suffers and sins constitutes all that is essential in the doctrine of immortality'.</page></plain_text>
