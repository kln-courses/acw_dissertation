The best physical evidence of this phenomenon are a few icons dated to that period, which are preserved in Egypt (mainly in St. Catherines Monastery at Mount Sinai), in Rome, and in European collections.1 These icons do not, however, indicate the prevalence of a form of icon worship during this period, for most of them were, in fact, "simple commemorative and ex voto images,"2 with the exception of some that were considered relics and therefore endowed with miraculous or intercessory powers. The origin of the cult of icons apparently dates 1 For the icons of Egypt, see §10, below. For the Roman icons, see P.

The starting point for the iconoclast controversy is, therefore, to be linked with the famous canon 82 of the Quinisextum council of 692, which sanctioned and encouraged for the first time the depiction of Christ as man "instead of the ancient lamb."7 The rest of the story is well known and has to do with the beginnings of Iconoclasm in Constantinople during the reign of Leo III, who reacted against an increasing icon worship that he con- sidered idolatrous.8 However, while the outbreak and develop- ment of the iconoclast crisis in the Empire during the eighth and ninth centuries is attested in many (albeit controversial) sources, beliefs and debates about icon worship among Christians living under Islamic rule are much less well known. Recent publications tend to stress the predominance of icon worship among Middle Eastern Christians and to collect evidence in support of the continuity of practices of icon worship during the iconoclast period.9 But it is a long way from 5 T.

Considering the multiplicity of creeds among the Christians under Islamic rule, it would be strange if all of their churches agreed on the recent endorse- ment of icon cult in Constantinople (692), especially if we take into account that this practice was undoubt- edly regarded with increasing hostility by the Muslim authorities, as we shall see. It must, therefore be assumed, a priori, that there were different sensibilities at different times and that, accordingly, no unanimity on icon worship was reached for the moment. This does not necessarily mean that the iconoclast crisis in the Byzantine Empire was reproduced among the Christians in the Middle East. On the contrary, it is easily imaginable that the ecclesiastical authorities of the Melkites, Jacobites (West Syrians), Nestorians (East Syrians), and Copts tried to avoid internal confronta- tion on this issue in order to preserve the unity of their flocks: the crisis in contemporary Byzantium may well have served as a monitory reminder of the consequences such a debate could trigger. Accordingly, East Christian churches under Islam may have followed a middle way, by permitting or tolerating individual practices of icon worship, but preventing them from entering the lit- urgy or from being displayed in the churches. Such a response may also have appeased Islamic iconophobia. In this paper, I shall reappraise the evidence con- cerning icons and icon worship in the Melkite Church during the iconoclastic crisis in Byzantium.10 The pur- pose is not to argue for either an iconodule or an icono- clastic Melkite position, but to examine carefully the evidence supplied by the sources against the Byzantine background, commenting upon similarities and differ- ences with and from Byzantine iconoclasts and icono- dules. This eclectic procedure is advisable, as there is, in fact, a wide range of attitudes toward icons that have defied every attempt at schematic classification. Thus, the mere presence of icons is, by itself, never a proof of icon worship: the place of the icon, its character as a Götterbilder , ed. B. Groneberg and H. Spieckermann, Beihefte zur Zeitschrift für die alttestamentische Wissenschaft 376 (Berlin and New York, 2007), 324-46 and 347-80. 10 In this paper, I will use the expression "icon worship" in a rather neutral way to refer to the cult or veneration of icons, whether in private or in the church, without entering into debates about the theological interpretation of this act by contermporaries or by mod- ern scholars.

Moreover, iconoclasm in Byzantium is not an altogether homoge- neous or even a well-known phenomenon, for it passed through successive and different phases. Contrary to popular imagination, images were rarely destroyed.11 Again, prudence is appropriate here, and we must avoid confounding the lack of evidence for icon destruction with tacit support for the pious cult of the holy images. We shall first study the growing Islamic hostil- ity to images from the beginning of the eighth cen- tury, as well as its repercussion on Christian practices (§1). This discussion will be followed by reflections on the phenomenon of "iconophobia" attested in some churches of the period (§2). We shall then examine the figure of John of Damascus (§3) and the references in some Greek and Latin sources about councils held by the Melkites in the eighth century, at which icono- clastic practices were allegedly condemned (§§4-6). Thereafter, we shall consider the treatise on the icons attributed to Theodore Abū Qurra (§7), as well as other Melkite treatises that contain passing references to icons (§8). Finally, after briefly taking into account some Greek Lives (§9), we shall review some sources in search of information on icon worship among Coptic, Jacobite, and Nestorian Churches (§10). Arabic and Greek, as well as some Latin, sources will provide the main basis for our approach; our hope is to reveal a more complex attitude of the Melkites toward images than previously assumed. 1. Islamic Hostility against Images and the Decree of Yazid Many sources (first Greek, but also Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, and even Latin) report that the caliph Yazid (721-724) was persuaded by a Jewish magi- cian to decree a general constitution banning images from churches and public spaces in the caliphate. In 1 1 Brubaker and Haldon, Iconoclast Era (n. 2 above), 199-212. Even Leo III erected images of the apostles, the prophets, and the cross at the Palace Gate, although this might have been at the very beginning of his reign, before he turned to iconoclasm, as P. Magdalino argues, "The Other Image at the Palace Gate and the Visual Propaganda of Leo III," in Byzantine Religious Culture : Studies in Honor of Alice- Mary Talbot, ed. D. Sullivan, E. Fisher, and S. Papaioannou (Leiden and Boston, 2012), 139-53. See also Brubaker and Haldon, Iconoclast Era , 102-3, 12.8-35. exchange, the Jew promised him a long reign, although the caliph actually died soon after the promulgation of his edict. However, his ban on images provided the "Saracen-minded" Leo III with a pattern for starting iconoclasm.12 This widespread story, circulated by the icono- dules at the council of Nicaea II in 787, was long con- sidered authentic in its main lines by modern research, so that even an approximate dating was given to the edict (ca. 721). However, some scholars, especially Byzantinists, have more recently questioned the his- toricity of Yazid s decree, rejecting it as an etiological forgery and stressing its clearly legendary flavor.13 For them the principle of "cui prodest" has provided a likely explanation of the genesis of the legend, for it was to the benefit of the iconodules to connect the outbreak of iconoclasm with the archetypical foes of the Empire, the Arabs, instead of looking to internal reasons as the cause of the crisis. According to this interpretation, it is only the lack of iconoclast sources that prevents us from balancing iconodule propaganda with a more accurate assessment of the origins of Byzantine iconoclasm, which would thus have nothing to do with contempo- rary Islamic influence,14 but with the old and persistent aniconism of the Christian religion.15 On the other hand, there has also been, especially among Arabists, a general tendency to credit the his- toricity of Yazïds decree16 and to look for a historical 12 For a complete review of the sources, see A.

With the Arabists, I am convinced of the historic- ity of an edict of Yazîd against images, if not in all its leg- endary details (the promise of the Jew for a long reign), at least in its core. The great number of sources - from many countries and in many different languages - that independently transmit the story exclude the possibil- ity that it was modelled on fictional hearsay or con- cocted by later iconodule propaganda.19 Definitive evidence for the decree of Yazîd is to be found in an examination of historical context, as Sydney Griffith has demonstrated in several contributions:20 the decree du monde arabe, ii-is Septembre 1990, ed. P. Canivet and J. P. Rey- Coquais (Damascus, 1992), 121-38; and Griffith, "Iconophilia and Iconophobia" (n. 9 above). 17 See, for example, S. H. Griffith, "Bashīr/Bēsēr: Boon Compan- ion of the Byzantine Emperor Leo III: The Islamic Recension of His Story in Leiden Oriental MS 951(2)," Le Muséon 103 (1990): 293- 327 (repr. in idem, The Beginnings of Christian Theology in Arabic [Aldershot, 2002], no. XI), who comments upon an Arabic source in which the Syrian renegade Bashlr, boon companion of Leo III and the main supporter of his iconoclast policy, holds a discussion with an Arab prisoner about some details of the Christian faith. This text confirms the historicity of the renegade Brjaiļp, mentioned by Theophanes as the inspirer of Leo Ills iconoclasm; see Theophanes: Chronographia, ed. C. de Boor (Leipzig, 1883), 402, 405, and 414. 18 Crone, "Iconoclasm" (n. 16 above), 59; this article is very sug- gestive in its first part, but the argumentation of 74-95 about the identity of Athinganoi, Judeo-Christians, and Sabbatians is less convincing. 19 Further confirmation of the historicity of the edict is pro- vided by a Syrian disputation with an Arab emir dated to 720-21, which deals with icon worship.

A was but the last step in a well-documented process undertaken by several Umayyads to unify the caliphate and suppress any outward sign of particularism among its Christian subjects. The monetary reforms in the caliphate of Abd al-Mālik (685-70$), the passing of the administration from Greek to Muslim hands dur- ing the reign of Walïd I (705-71$), 21 the suppression of taxes for converts by the caliph ťUmar ibn Abd al-Azīz (7 17-720), 22 all of these measures tended to homoge- nize the caliphate and overcome the differences among its subjects. In particular, 'Umars measure permitted access to power to non-Arab Muslims,23 thus encourag- ing the conversion of Christians to Islam. Although the Christian population remained in the majority during the eighth century in the conquered areas of Palestine and Syria, the Islamization of society progressed slowly but steadily, especially after the Abbasid revolution brought the Persian Muslims to power and put an end to the "Arab Empire."24 It is thus not unreasonable to similar exploration of the decree in its cultural context is presented by M.

R. Gibb, "The Fiscal Rescript of 'Umar II," Arabica 2 (1955): 1-16, includes an English translation and commentary of the rescript of the caliph 'Umar II, where such fiscal measures are detailed. The first measure to be listed after the prologue is the fol- lowing: "Wherefore, whosoever accepts al-Islām, whether Christian or Jew or Magian, of those who are now subject to the ģizya, and who joins himself to the body of the Muslims in their abode, and who forsakes his abode wherein he was before, he shall enjoy all the privileges of the Muslims and shall be subject to all the duties laid upon them" (3). 23 Is it only a coincidence that John of Damascus resigned his post in the administration of the caliphs at Damascus at precisely this time? 24 D. C. Dennett, Conversion and the Poll Tax in Early Islam (Cambridge, 1950), was the first to establish a link between taxation and conversion, considering the regional differences. R. W.

Some might even have tried to some- how reconcile their own religion with that of their new rulers, if not in matters of dogma, at least in outward appearance. The move to override differences in cult might have been especially marked in image worship, for there was, in fact, a shared tradition of "iconopho- bia" in the two religions. Accordingly, Yazïds decree, although it did not aim directly at the conversion of Christian subjects, would have been another stone put in the way of the free practice of their faith. However, to speak of a cause- and-effect relationship between Yazïd s decree and the outbreak of Iconoclasm in Byzantium is a very differ- ent matter, for we must prove, in the first instance, that the caliphate issued a ban not just against images , but against icon worship among the Eastern Christians. If this were the case, the decree would have had a large impact on the religious practices of Christians in Syria and Palestine, as well as of those within the Byzantine frontiers, just as the Council of 787 intended when it presented Leo III as inspired by Yazïds decree.25 Moreover, such a reconstruction would provide sub- stantial evidence for the existence of icon worship among Eastern Christians, which is the main concern of this article. Nevertheless, things appear to have been very different from what iconodule Byzantines claimed in 787, for most of the texts that inform us about Yazîd s decree carefully avoid mentioning "holy icons" as the target of the caliph s fury, but speak more generally of a ban on "images." Consider, for example, the narra- process. Especially interesting are his conclusions on Iraq (80-91) and Syria (104-13), where the Muslims became 50 percent of the popula- tion by the third quarter of the ninth century. See the review of M. G. Morony, "The Age of Conversions: A Reassessment," in Conversion and Continuity : Indigenous Christian Communities in Islamic Lands, Eighth to Eighteenth Centuries, ed. M. Gervers and R. J.

John, the legate of the apostolic thrones of the East, is the speaker. When he describes the nature of Yazïds decree, he says that the Jewish magician who had advised the caliph on this matter pushed him to issue an encyclical letter throughout the Empire: "... to the effect that every representational painting, whether on tablets or in wall-mosaics, on sacred vessels or on altar coverings, and all such objects as are found in Christian churches, be destroyed and thoroughly abolished, nay, also representations of all kinds that adorn and embellish the market-places of cities." It was moved by satanic wickedness that the false prophet added "every likeness," contriving thereby to make unsuspected his hostility against us.26 The passage has neither an explicit reference to "holy icons," nor even to "icons." The words used, sucovucr) Sia£coYpácj&gt;v|&lt;7i&lt;;27 or ó[¿oi¿)1xaTa, are carefully chosen for their diffuse meaning. Indeed, John, the narrator, feels obliged to gloss the term to make it clear that the images of the Christian were targeted by the decree, although the Jew concealed his real purpose to the caliph. Only when the narrative continues is it said that the caliph actually destroyed "the holy icons and all other representations" (xàç àyíoc ç bíkóvocç Kai loi7rà ó|zota)|¿aTa), but even then the icons are presented as being simply a part of the larger body of images. 26 Mansi, i3:i97D-E (= Lambertz, Concilium , pars altera, 594.1- 7): ". . . wore nãvav ebccmicyp SiaÇcoypá^rjaiv, ehe èv aavíaiv ehe Sia ļiovare((&gt;)v èv rofyoiç ehe èv cncsúscriv iepoíç Kal èvSuroíç Guaiaaxrjpícov ' Kai Öcra roiaöra eúpío-Kerai, èv náaaiç raí; rwv Xpiariavcõv ÍK'¿kr]&lt;jí- aiç à&lt;1&gt;avío"ai Kal reXéco; Kara'Xûaai, ov (¿rjv aXkcL Kal öaa èv raí; àyopalç rwv 7rólecov Kaxà kÓ(j'lov eìcrl Kal gÙ7rpé7reiav oiqt§iļ7roT6 óf-ioiórrjTt."

DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="6">140 I JUAN SIGNES CODOÑER Accordingly, as the text stands, it appears as if the con- nection between icon worship and the ban on images by Yazîd was made only secondarily and with the pur- pose of linking the episode with Byzantine iconoclasm. The silence of the text on actual icon worship, if it does not amount to an argumentum ex silentio , is at least revealing of the different natures of the two phenom- ena. But what could have been then Yazids purpose, if Christian icons were not primarily targeted? The archaelogical evidence may now provide us with a clue. 2. Iconophobia among the Melkites What is usually labelled as "iconophobia" is well attested in the churches of Palestine during the eighth century and consists in the widespread, although not systematic, removal of zoo- and anthropomorphic figures on pavement mosaics. Two aspects of this evi- dence are crucial. First, the removal of the images can be dated precisely to our period, in contrast with some other instances of destruction or mutilation of holy icons painted on the walls of churches (for example, in Cappadocia), which probably originated much later. Second, it was probably carried out not by Muslims but by the Christians themselves, for it was done care- fully, with the intention of preserving the surrounding mosaic. There are even instances where a partial recon- struction of the destroyed figure has been attempted. Susanna Ognibene, working mainly in the famous church of Saint Stephen of Umm al-Rasās, collected all the available evidence (more extensive than previously supposed) and proved that most of the mosaics were reconstructed with care almost immediately after the removal of the images, sometimes even using the same tesserae of the original mosaic. She dates this instance of "iconophobia" between ca. 718-720 and ca. 76o.28 As the first date is close to the supposed issue of Yazids ban on images, it might serve as a partial confir- mation of its existence. The end date might, in turn, be connected with the end of the Umayyad caliphate and the subsequent abandonment of Syria and Damascus for Iraq as the center of the Islamic empire, resulting per- haps in diminished control of the central government over the activities of the local population - in our case, the Syrian and Melkite Christians. This evidence would confirm that it was due to Muslim pressure that the destruction or removal of figurative mosaics from the pavement of the churches took place. Ognibene even points to the shared use, of churches by Christians and Muslims as one of the causes for the removal of images considered offensive to Islam.29 This phenomenon has been carefully stud- ied by Suliman Bashear, who proved convincingly that early Muslim rulers prayed in Christian churches.30 There were even contemporary treatises, especially among the Shi 'a, that discussed the ways in which preaching in Christian churches was permitted, with frequent reference to the presence of images in them. To cite just one case, in several stories collected in the Kit ab al-Mahãsin , an encyclopaedia of knowledge for the Shi'a written by al-Barqī in the first half of the ninth century, the representation of trees in churches is permitted, the existence of pictures in private houses is justified, and prayer with pictures or statues on the right or left, or behind or under ones legs (but not in front of the worshipper, in which case they should be covered) is conceded.31 Unfortunately, no indication about any religious nature of the images is given. However, although the pressure of Islam might well have triggered the outbreak of "iconophobia" attested in the mosaics of the Palestinian churches, we must not rule out that disputes among Christians over image worship had their own internal dynamics. 28 S.

For example, some of the profane images that were destroyed had, in fact, a symbolic meaning, which could be misinterpreted by Christian believers. This was precisely the concern of canon 82 of the Council of Trullo, which prohibited the symbolic representa- tion of Christ as a lamb in order to avoid confusion.32 The drawing of a cross in the place of a destroyed ani- mal head, recorded by Ognibene in two instances, may attest to the symbolic value of the original figure and prove that its reconsecration to the Christian faith was made so as to prevent any misunderstanding on the part of the believers. If the figure of a bird partially preserved in a mosaic in the church of Umm al-Rasās is, indeed, a peacock, as Ognibene claims (fig. 1), it is easy to see why its head and tail were removed and replaced by a 32 Schick, Christian Communities , 201, is skeptical about this interpretation. cross (even reusing the same tesserae), for peacocks (like other birds) have always been understood as a symbol of Paradise. This removal or destruction of symbolic fig- ures did not necessarily follow in accordance with the canon 82 of the Council in Trullo, whose implementa- tion or even circulation among Eastern Christians is, to , say the least, an undecided question. Rather, canon 82 of Trullo might have endorsed a previous general mis- trust toward symbolic images. Furthermore, the existence of profane images in Christian churches could always have been understood as a kind of idolatry, for they did not represent either saints or the Divinity, unlike holy icons. The placement of these profane images on the floor, where they were stepped on by the believers, certainly prevented them from being worshipped, and stressed rather their deco- rative function, in contrast to the icons of the saints and of Christ, which were, perhaps, put on the side walls and DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="8">142 I JUAN SIGNES CODOÑER even, eventually, in the altar area.33 Nevertheless, this figurative decoration with plants, animals, and profane and symbolic figures could have been deemed in some Christian circles as too profane to be admitted into the church, even on its pavement. It was, indeed, the kind of decoration used for private houses and palaces of the period, but not allowed in sacred places. This distinc- tion is well documented in contemporary Islam, where figurative decoration is present in the Umayyad palaces but not in the mosques, where only geometric patterns and plants were admitted. We can, for example, men- tion the famous mosaics of Qusayr Amra in Jordan, which present a detailed iconographie program, carried out by Greek artists, consisting of sparsely clothed or naked women, episodes of hunting and merrymaking, and an allegorical representation of six kings defeated by Islamic armies. One of these kings is Roderic, the Visigoth King of Spain, who lost his life and reign to the Arabs in 711, which then sets the terminus post quem for the creation of the mosaics. Curiously enough, the mosaics appear to be almost contemporary with the cali- phate of Yazld II (710-724), who was, as we have seen, credited in the Greek sources with an iconoclast edict.34 The changing approach to the images according to their function and their place was not restricted to Islam, for the Iconoclast emperors seemed to favor profane figurative decoration in their palaces as well. The Life of Stephen the Younger attests that the icono- clasts destroyed the sacred images "but if it was about images of trees, birds and irrational animals, and espe- cially about the satanic horse races, hunting parties and scenes of the theatre or of the hippodrome, they consid- ered them with respect and made them brighten up."35 33 Canon 73 of the Council in Trullo forbade the representation of the cross on the floors of churches, where it might be stepped on, see Nedungatt and Featherstone, Council in Trullo (n. 7 above), 155; G.

Stephens reference at §64 to an image of a charioteer in the Milion is Moreover, the iconoclasts seemed to include images of plants and animals in churches. Again, the Life of Stephen the Younger states in a subsequent pas- sage that Constantine V held the synod of Hiereia at the Church of the Blachernai, where he had removed the icon of Christ and substituted images of animals and plants for it.36 This kind of figurative representa- tion in the iconoclast churches has not been preserved as a norm, but there is enough evidence, for instance, in peripheral areas like Naxos and Cappadocia,37 to con- firm that it was common practice in the period. Therefore, theoretically, it could be that some Christians rejected the presence of profane images on, the pavement of Palestinian churches out of displeasure with their promotion by contemporary "iconoclasts" (be they Muslims or Byzantines). However, this possibility supposes the transference into the Middle East of the patterns of the conflict as it developed in Byzantium; such a supposition should be avoided.

After all, floor pictures and holy icons are not conceptualized either as equivalent or as contradictory phenomena. We are not speaking of erasing a cross in the apse and putting an image on it (or the other way around), as occurred in some churches of the Byzantine Empire.39 Moreover, as only the floor mosaics have been preserved, it is practically a petitio principu to guess at the existence of icon paintings on the walls. In fact, as far as I know, only a single holy image has been excavated from the ruins of the lavishly decorated Palestinian churches of the period (for Egypt, however, see §10, below). It is the painted figure of a seated saint with a nimbus above and a book in his left hand. It has been preserved in the plaster of four blocks of stone from the apsidal half-dome of the Palestinian Church of the Priest Oualesos (Wa il) in Umm al-Rasās.40 The bearded saint is surrounded by medallions of birds and shows traces of being damaged by a pickaxe (fig. 2). The Church of the Priest Oualesos is easily dated to $86 through the mosaic inscription on the floor, , which was made at the request of the so-called pres- byter (or7rouSfl OvotXé aov npeaßvrepov). But we do not know when the half-dome of the apse was painted over with the image of a saint; it might even have been centuries later. As the four blocks with the painted image "miraculously" preserved on them were found 38 See, for example, Brubaker and Haldon, Iconoclast Era, 194-97, for the iconoclastic cross in the apse of Saint Sophia of Thessalonike, which remained untouched for almost two centuries. 39 Ibid., 199-212. 40 For the painting and the excavations in this church, see M.

Further evidence for the existence of holy icons in the Palestinian churches is perhaps provided by a famous mosaic inscription of the Church of the Virgin in Madaba. The inscription, built into a medallion, is part of a geometrical mosaic that decorates the pave- ment of the church. It is placed near the altar, in the middle of the church. Its text may be translated as fol- lows: "You who look [SgpKÒpvoç] at Mary, virginal Mother of God, and to Christ whom she generated, Universal King, only son of the only God, purify your mind [vóov], flesh, and works and, with purest prayers [gi^alę], the people of God itself" (fig. 3). According to Michele Piccirillo, the inscription must refer to an image or icon of the Virgin with child placed on the altar and worshipped by the Christian community, for this icon "provides the hermeneutical basis for the read- ing of the inscription." 41 41 M.

DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="11">Melkites and Icon Worship during the Iconoclastic Period | 145 The pavement of this church has been recently dated to 767, due to a reinterpretation of a square dedi- catory inscription on the pavement, near the round one.42 If, accordingly, the purely geometric pattern and layout of the mosaic could be explained as a result of the increasing pressure of Muslim authorities against Christian images, how would we then understand the - until now unparalleled - reference to an icon of the Virgin in the round mosaic inscription? Perhaps, as Leah di Segni noticed, we must take into consid- eration the "strong apologetic tone" of the inscription "that may be best be explained precisely by a controver- sial background." Nor do I exclude the possibility that the reference to the "vision" of the Virgin and her child referred to a form of noetic contemplation provoked by the dedication of the Church. Indeed, the person addressed by the inscription is urged to purify his mind (vóov) through his prayers.43 The archaeological evidence so far adduced does not allow us to know whether the ecclesiastical authorities in Palestine promoted, tolerated, or even condemned icon worship in their respective churches before the iconoclast decree of Yazîd or the outbreak of iconoclasm in Constantinople, nor even to know the extent or location of their actions.44 No connection between "iconoclasm" in the caliphate and Byzantium can be established, a point that has been strongly argued by Leslie Brubaker and John Haldon in their recent book.45 Now, if their argument holds force, we 42 L. di Segni, "The Date of the Church of the Virgin in Madaba," Liber Annuus 42 (1992): 251-57 and figs. 1-4, at pl. 25-26. See Piccirillo, Chiese e mosaici di Madaba, 22-23 and 280-81, for similar dedicatory medallions in mosaics, dated to 603 and 586. Piccirillo also dated the inscription of the Church of the Virgin to the end of the sixth or beginning of the seventh century (50). 43 Brubaker and Haldon, Iconoclast Era, 231-32, argue that the inscription "could equally well refer to spiritual rather than physi- cal sight." 44 One clue is provided by Ognibene, Umm Al-Rasas, 1 1 2-13, who observes that the mosaics of the monasteries appear to have been bet- ter preserved than those of the city churches, although it remains uncertain whether this was due to the isolation of the monastic buildings or to the iconodule tendencies of the Palestinian monks. 45 Brubaker and Haldon, Iconoclast Era , 113-15, argue that Byzantine and East Christian iconoclasms were two different phe- nomena. For the different "versions" of Iconoclasm, see L. Brubaker, "Eighth-Century Iconoclasms: Arab, Byzantine, Carolingian, and Palestinian," in ANAQHMATA EOPTIKA: Studies in Honor of Thomas F. Matthews , ed. J. D. Alchhermes, H. C. Evans, and Th. K. Thomas (Mainz, 2009), 73-81. should consequently maintain that icon worship could not have been practiced in a similar way in both areas, especially because the definition and conceptualization of icon worship in Byzantium did not precede, but fol- lowed, the struggle over the images, as Brubaker and Haldon have sufficiently proven.46 A further problem, however, follows: Melkite writers deal with the issue of icon worship at some length. We must now consider this evidence. 3. The Case ofjohn of Damascus John of Damascus47 wrote the three treatises of Against Iconoclasts in Greek between the alleged outbreak of iconoclasm in 726 with Leo III and 754, when the icon- oclast council of Hiereia issued four anathemas against him for his support of images.48 The textual tradition of the three treatises is not unproblematic, for they are, in fact, not three autonomous compositions, but three different reworkings of the same treatise, with com- mon passages and new materials added according to the different addresees; John apparently "plagiarized himself."49 Bonifatius Kotter made a synoptic edi- tion of the three texts with parallel columns, merging even the parallel texts into one when their wording was identical.50 As there is reason to think that at least the florilegia that accompanied the three treatises - and from which John supposedly obtained some of his argu- ments - were expanded and interpolated after his death (as is usual in such open genres),51 one wonders whether 46 See, for example, Brubaker and Haldon, Iconoclast Era, 63: "What we might legitimately call a cult of images did not lead to iconoclasm; it was generated by the discourse of the debate about iconoclasm itself." 47 See A. Louth, St. John Damascene: Tradition and Originality in Byzantine Theology (Oxford, 2002; repr. 2004), for a comprehensive study of this figure. 48 Mansi, 13:356 C-D. 49 Louth, Damascene , 197-98; see, also, 210-11 for the sources upon which the Damascene built up his three treatises on the icons. 50 B.

Since the Damascene himself freely borrowed DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="12">14 6 I JUAN SIGNES CODOÑER this later reworking of the texts was limited to the appended catalogue of patristic quotations or whether it also affected some arguments of the treatises themselves. Indeed, it is not common in the history of textual trans- mission to deal with three authorial versions of the same text. And the temptation to round off the arguments of John of Damascus must have been very high, consider- ing the authoritative character of his works in iconodule milieux, which was achieved to a great extent through the four anathemas issued against him by the emperor Constantine V at the Council of Hiereia. This anathema must also have implied some kind of damnatio memoriae for the writer and his works until 787, when the restoration of the icons took place at Nicaea II. In fact, neither the acts of Nicaea II nor such important iconodule authors of the beginning of the ninth century as the patriarch Nicephoros or Theodore of Stoudios seem to be aware of the argu- ments of the Damascene. Certainly, the chronicle of Theophanes singles out John among the defenders of the icons and names him Chrysorrhoas for his fluent tongue,52 though that epithet refers to his homilies and to his fame as a preacher.53 No indication is given in the chronicle that his three treatises on the icons were read or known at the time. A possible explanation for this silence is that the focus of the debate about the icons had shifted from questions about the kind of worship the icons deserved, a central issue for John, to a more complex christologi- cal approach, to which the work of our author had little to contribute.54 But this is, in my opinion, an insuffi- cient explanation for the general silence about John of Damascus' treatises on icons in the first generation of Byzantine iconodule writers after Nicaea II, nor does it explain his popularity at much later times, after the reintroduction of icon worship in 843. Rather, we should presuppose difficult access to the three treatises due to the emperor s ban in the years after Johns death, which undoubtedly made it easy for any interpola- tor to modify his work without being noticed and to adapt it to the changing demands of readers. We must, arguments and words from previous writers, he may not have con- sidered his work entirely original, thus paving the way for the later interpolations. 52 Theophanes, Chronographia, 408, 417, and 428 (ed. de Boor). 53 Louth, Damascene , 224. 54 Ibid., 219-20. then, read the three treatises on the icons by John of Damascus with the utmost caution when we draw con- clusions about the impact of the issue on the Middle East in the eighth century. This caution applies foremost to Johns silence about any kind of iconoclasm in the Middle East.55 In his treatises John appears to react only to the iconoclast outbreak in Constantinople, as if there were no debate or conflict about the icons in Palestine or Syria at his time. This is most evident in the second treatise, espe- cially after chapter 12, which begins with a forceful sen- tence: oů ßaailgcov so ti vo[¿o06T£Ív ryj èKKlrjorí ą. There, John heavily criticizes the emperor for meddling in the affairs of the Church and makes a defense of the legiti- macy of the Church, as a power with the same rights as the Empire, to establish dogma. In this Two-Powers theory, certainly aimed at limiting the Isaurians from intervening in church affairs, John advanced argu- ments later adduced by several iconodule partisans, from Theodore of Stoudios to Photios himself.56 This is not to say that this section of the second treatise on the icons was later interpolated, for the defense of the dog- matic authority of the Church by John of Damascus had Christian forerunners. Moreover, as a Christian living in the caliphate, John could speak about this matter with more freedom than most of his contempo- raries in Byzantium. The outspokenness of John's attack on the emperor in the second treatise on the icons is, however, surprising, considering his silence about the emperor in the first treatise, whose addressee is unknown. Emperor Leo III is named as aypioç Kai ávY¡1Lepoq in a passage that makes him responsible for the outbreak of the crisis.57 It is possible that the first measures of Leo III against icon worship in 726 escalated some 55 In his Expositio fidei 4.16 = §89 (ed. Kotter, Schrifteny 2:206-8), the Damascene also deals with the main problems of icon worship but again gives us no clue about the identity of the enemies of the images.

The recent research of Brubaker and Haldon has, however, almost ruled out the possibility that such an edict ever existed.59 Yet it can still be asked whether this escalation of the conflict in Constantinople was serious enough to embolden a Palestinian monk to take up his pen against the emper- ors iconoclast policy or whether the conflict had had side effects in the Melkite communities of the East.60 A conclusion depends upon our ability to date the three treatises on the icons with some certainty. Paul Speck suggested that John of Damascus wrote them not during the reign of Leo III, as was generally assumed, but shortly before the iconoclast Council of Hiereia in 754.61 His conclusions are, for the most part, accepted by Brubaker and Haldon.62 This might provide the occasion for the composition of the three treatises, for it is possible that Constantine V claimed that the council was ecumenical (see immediately below), thus involving the eastern patriarchates in the debate on the icons. If, contrariwise, we do adhere to the early dating defended by Andrew Louth for the first two treatises (ca. 726- 730), 63 we are bereft of this explanation, although this does not prevent us from supposing that the policy of the Isaurians on the icons did, indeed, have repercus- 58 Certainly not the Ecloga , which promoted the Caesaropapist model for the Empire, as it was promulgated in 741, according to L.

In this connection, it is significant that while the Council at Hiereia issued four severe anathemas against John of Damascus, it did not act against the Melkite patriarchs, who, we can surmise, did not endorse Johns defense of the icons.64 The silence of this council about the eastern patriarchs is even more intriguing,65 as the acts of the council did anathematize patriarch Germanos and George of Cyprus,66 among the sup- porters of the icons. Furthermore, in connection with the outbreak of the crisis during the reign of Leo III, Theophanes sin- gles out the patriarchs of Constantinople, the pope of Rome, and John of Damascus as the main iconodule leaders in their respective churches, without again men- tioning the Melkite patriarchs of the east.67 Suspicions are provoked, therefore, by the immediate addition of the chronicler: "John, together with the eastern bish- ops, subjected the impious man [Leo III] to anath- ema" ('Ic oávvr]&lt;; avv roîç rrjç AvocroXrjç è7ricrKÓ7roi&lt;; rotę áva0é[¿a&lt;Ji ròv äcreßrj Ka0U7roßc$Xei). Although the monk John had enough authority so as to appear to be the leader of the Melkites at the time (as Máximos did before him), he was certainly not entitled to issue any anathema. Moreover, a leading role for a monk in church councils was exceptional.68 Certainly, Theophanes stresses that in the Council of Hiereia "none of the universal sees was rep- resented, namely those of Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem,"69 but he is silent about the causes of this absence. Moreover, the acts of Nicaea insist on 64 If the Damascene was anathematized only for his iconodulia. M.-F.

We might surmise that the patriarchs were pre- vented by the caliphate from travelling to Constantino- ple, but this prohibition was by no means exceptional at the time and, in fact, they were present neither at Nicaea nor at later councils summoned in the ninth century. Several reasons can be adduced for their absence, first and foremost the internal troubles of the Melkite sees, but it is sufficient to note that the Melkite prelates needed authorization from the caliph to enter Byzantine territory on an official mission. The same difficulties applied to lesser representatives coming to Constantinople. Furthermore, emperors needed at least one year to send ambassadors to the Melkite patriar- chates and receive an answer from them, although this process usually took much more time, for the patri- archs, in turn, needed to contact Muslim authorities and summon their clergy for consultation. Since such delays were highly inconvenient, other procedures evolved, which consisted mainly in investing legitimacy on members of the Melkite Church who happened to be present in Constantinople, either as visitors or as permanent residents. The Melkite legates present at the councils of 787, 867, and 869-70 were all appointed by the patriarch of Constantinople. Lacking legitimacy, they were all accused - and with some reason - in later councils of not having been chosen as representatives by the Melkite prelates for whom they claimed to act. In some cases, as in the council of 869-70, such fraud was even concocted with the understanding and sup- port of local Arab emirs. At the council of 867, Photios passed off some leading members of the Italian clergy 70 Mansi, i3:208E-209A. Stephen the Deacon, Life of Stephen the Younger §§28 and 44 (ed. Auzépy), repeats the same argumentation of the acts of Nicaea II and even their wording. In the preface to her edition of the Life (n. 27 above), Auzépy indicates that its author con- stantly makes use of the acts (7). as representatives of the papacy and probably did some- thing similar with the Melkite representatives. 71 It is against this background that we should judge the alleged absence of Melkite prelates at the Hiereia council. Whether the Melkite representatives who must have attended the Council of Hiereia in 754 were or were not legitimate, we will never know, although we can surmise that Constantine V did his best to present the council as formally ecumenical by means of a Melkite legation, exactly as patriarch Tarasios did in 787. Accordingly, the absence of true legates of the Melkite patriarchates at Hiereia (not to speak of the absence of the patriarchs themselves!) does not necessarily mean that they were staunch supporters of icon worship (see §4 below). Nor can the possibil- ity be ruled out that the Melkite patriarchates might eventually have lent support to the emperors policy against icon worship. Obviously, this does not mean that the Melkite prelates were committed iconoclasts, but only that they followed the policy established in Constantinople, insofar as it did not interfere too much with their own internal problems. This was the usual attitude of the imperial clergy, who obeyed the guide- lines of the emperor and the highest hierarchy of the Church and who were prone to change sides as often as required. The best proof of that is the high level of con- sensus reached at every council among the Byzantine clergy against decisions taken by previous councils on the issue of images.72 It remains to consider whether there could have been a council of the Melkite patriarchates ca. 730 71 For detailed arguments against the legitimacy of the Melkite legates at the council of Nicaea, see M.-F.

DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="15">Melkitcs and Icon Worship during the Iconoclastic Period | 149 anathematizing Leo III, as the passage of Theophanes quoted above seems to imply.73 Marie-France Auzépy drew attention some years ago to a passage in John of Damascuss letter about the Trisagion, where our author shows a close intimacy with the patriarch of Jerusalem.74 She connected this circumstance with a synodical letter that the patriarch John of Jerusalem might have written ca. 730, a text she reconstructed from the nucleus of the (unedited) short version of the Adversus Constantinum Caballinum (CC). According to her analysis, the patriarch John sent this synodical letter to his other colleagues in order to make clear his support of the icons, whose worship was expressly defended in the definition of the faith with which the text started.75 At least one copy reached Pope Gregory II and was expanded and interpolated with dialogic parts ca. 769 to form the short version of the CC. This version was again expanded ca. 785-87 into the (edited) long version of the CC.76 Auzépy s reconstruction of the three textual stages of the CC is very convincing, although it takes for granted that the oriental patriarchs did, in fact, oppose Leo III in 730 on the issue of icons - which, in turn, makes likely the writing of a synodical letter in support of the images by the patriarch of Jerusalem. However, in the passage quoted by Auzépy, John of Damascus refers to the patriarch John only as his former master, whose lessons he attended as a student over the years. According to John of Damascus, the patriarch John could never have defended an interpretation of the Trisagion Hymn as applying only to Christ and not to the Trinity. Nothing in the passage suggests that both men acted together in anyway against iconoclasts, espe- cially as the patriarch was older and the master of the Damascene. On the other hand, if the patriarch of Jerusalem did write a synodical letter in 730 about the images, one 73 Theophanes, Chronographia 408 (ed. de Boor) (AM 6221). 74 De hymno trisagio §2 6: Tíç yàp oīSe toõ [¿aKapicorárou Icoávvoi» Toxi írarpiáp^ou vór|[xa èf*oú 7rXéov; OúSelç.

Or, if the synodical letter was written even before the anathema was made, why did the text of the anathema not reach the pope? Why is there no mention of this anathema in the papal archives or in the bulky dossier of iconophile texts com- piled by the Greek monks in Rome that provides a basis for Parisinus Graecus 1115?77 This is surely an argument ex silentio, but nonetheless very forceful, especially if one takes into consideration the systematic production of texts in support of the icons in the Greek milieux of Rome during the first iconoclast period. How could the text of an anathema against Leo III by the oriental patriarchates not have been preserved? Perhaps because this anathema never existed. The recent, detailed reconstruction by Brubaker and Haldon of the first stages of the iconoclastic controversy also makes it highly improbable that a Melkite patriarch could have taken, so early, such a bold step against an emperor who adopted a very prudent policy against the cult of the images in the area of the altar.78 The foregoing argument does not preclude the existence of a patriarchal, synodical letter from which the short and long versions of the CC were produced. But perhaps this letter was not as iconodule as Auzépy thinks. If the text were indeed interpolated and enlarged, as she has convincingly proven, I would sug- gest that is is because the interpolator wanted to make it more useful for the iconodules, not only by making explicit some statements that were absent in the origi- nal version, but also by distorting its original meaning and purpose. This is exactly what happened with the Letter to Iheophilos sent by the three Melkite patri- archs ca. 836, as I attempt to prove elsewhere.79 In fact, if Auzépy is correct that the short and long versions of , the CC were forged and even that "une falsification de document n effrayait pas Rome à cette époque,"80 why should we think that the original wording of a synodi- cal letter of the patriarch of Jerusalem was faithfully preserved? On the other hand, even admitting that the patriarch of Jerusalem wrote a synodical letter in 77 For this dossier, see A.

The supposed synodical letter is not definitive proof of a unanimous or continuous defense of the icons in the Melkite church. In sum, it cannot be proven that John of Damas- cus received substantial support from the Melkite patriarchs in his invectives against iconoclasts. Had this been the case, we would have expected the Melkite patriarchs to become the target of the iconoclast anath- ema of 7$4, rather than John himself. The possibility of an internal division among the Melkites on the issue of the icons must be proposed.81 But why does John not say a word about it? The explanation that first comes to mind is that our saint opposed the ecclesiastical authorities of his time on this issue but did not mention names in order to avoid a direct confrontation. Again, this would not mean that the Melkite patriarchs were iconoclasts, only that they avoided taking sides in a conflict that they considered alien to their own communities, where different traditions concerning icon worship might well have peacefully coexisted until then. The prudent silence of the patriarchs in the face of John s outspoken invectives is all the more understandable if we consider that the Muslim authorities might have been behind the increasing ban on images in Christian churches from the beginning of the eighth century, as I have argued in §§1-2 above. On the other hand, there already prevailed pro- found division among the Melkites at this time,82 so it is highly unlikely that all parties would stand behind John s radical ideas on icon worship, especially as such a stance would imply conflict with iconoclast emperors at Constantinople, the sponsors of the Chalcedonians in the face of the rival eastern Churches. Michael the Syrian, referring to the situation of the Melkite church at the beginning of the eighth century (and probably basing himself on the Jacobite patriarch Dionysius of 81 Eadem, "Palestine à Constantinople" (n. 64 above), 203-4. 82 See, for example, Auzépy, "Palestine à Constantinople," 225: "Les informations fragmentaires concernant les trois patriarcats ori- entaux font ressortir que, du fait de la révolution abbaside, leur his- toire fut chaotique pendant la seconde moitié du VIIIe siècle, que les schismes furent fréquents et les communautés divisées." Tell Mahrē, d. 848), 83 affirms that "it is impossible to enumerate or even to calculate how many anathemas, how many quarrels took place [among the Melkites] until now." Michael is a biased source because of his hostility against the Melkites, but the details he pro- vides are too specific to have been invented. His chron- icle contains, in fact, a lengthy report about the new "schism" created among the Melkites by the late follow- ers of Máximos Confessor ($80 -662), 84 who rejected the addition of the expression ó oraupcoGgię to the Trisagion, which was otherwise customary among the Syrians of the time.85 The conflict affected many sees of the Melkites, including Jerusalem, Edessa, Aleppo, and Antioch and, again probably according to the tes- timony of Tell Mahrē, was triggered by the interven- tion of the father of John of Damascus, the influential Sergius ibn Mansùr, who had a post in the caliphal administration in Damascus.86 Although the "schism" is described in the chronicle of Michael the Syrian as a dogmatic conflict between the dyothelite Maximites (Chalcedonian fol- lowers of Máximos and of the sixth ecumenical coun- cil of 680-81 at Constantinople) and the monothelite Maronites (adherents of the monothelism named after the fifth-century Syrian monk St. Maron), it cre- ated a social divide among the Chalcedonians, for the chronicle says that the Maximites found adherents in the cities and in the hierarchy of the Melkite Church, whereas the Maronites were supported mainly by inhabitants of the countryside and by monks. As the 83 For the sources and transmission of the chronicle of Michael the Syrian, see D. Weltecke, "The World Chronicle by Patriarch Michael the Great (1126-1199): Some Reflections," Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies 11 (1997): 6-29. 84 For Máximos, see A. Louth, Maximus the Confessor (London, 2006). 85 The Syrians apparently understood the thrice-holy invoca- tion of the Trisagion as addressed to the Son and, accordingly, saw no problem in the addition of the formula ò oraupcoGeíç. The Chalcedonian Greeks, in contrast, addressed the Trisagion to the Trinity and regarded this theopaschite addition, atributed to the Peter the Fuller (d. 488), as an intolerable heresy.

Significantly, as we saw above, this dogmatic controversy is the one referred to by the Damascene when he alludes to his intimacy with the patriarch of Jerusalem.

Although no reference to icons is made in this passage, it is reasonable to con- clude that the outbreak of the iconoclastic crisis also affected the Melkites. In fact, the chronicle of Michael dates the beginning of the "schism" on the Trisagion to the year 1038, which corresponds to the period from i October 726 to 30 September 727. Is it a coincidence that exactly at this time Leo is thought to have started the iconoclastic crisis in Constantinople? Might the new crisis, therefore, have been influenced by the dynamics in Byzantium? Particularly revealing in this connection is a well-known passage of Michael the Syrian, in which he refers to the Iconoclast Council of 754 summoned by Constantine V and the reasons the emperor had for pronouncing an anathema on John of Damascus: The Chalcedonians hated this Constantine and called him icon-hater, because he held this synod and forbade the veneration of images. He anathematized Ioannes and George of Damascus88 as well as George of Cyprus, because they upheld the teachings of Máximos. The emperor Constantine was a cultivated man and he safely preserved the mysteries of the 87 For a study of the "schism" between Maximites and Maronites, see S. H. Griffith, "'Melkites', 'Jacobites' and the Christological Controversies in Arabic in Third/Ninth-Century Syria," in Syrian Christians under Islam , the First Thousand Years , ed. D. Thomas (Leiden, 2001), 9-55, esp. 14-17 and 45-49, as well as 52-53 for a reference to the Jacobite Abù Ra ita, who draws a sharp distinction between both groups of Melkites. For the iconodule Abù Qurra as follower of Máximos, see below in §7. For the language of the Melkites and its territorial distribution, see J. P. Monferrer Sala, "Between Hellenism and Arabicization: On the Formation of an Ethnolinguistic Identity of the Melkite Communities in the Heart of the Muslim Rule," Al-Qantara 33 (2012): 455-73. 88 It is not clear who this George of Damascus is (another mem- ber of the Mansùr family?), if there is not a mistake in the text, for two Georges are named.

This is why the Chalcedonians hated him.89 Michaels comment is clearly sympathetic to the fig- ure of Constantine V, although, as Sebastian Brock has argued, it does not necessarily mean that the Monophysite or Jacobite Syrians were iconoclasts or even inspired the iconoclasts at Constantinople.90 Further, it is evident that Constantine s hostility to the Chalcedonians - he anathematized some of their most prominent representatives, including John of Damascus - won Michaels sympathy. Nevertheless, Constantine is said by Michael to have forbidden the veneration of images and, at the same time, to have "safely preserved" the mysteries of orthodoxy; it is inconceivable that Michael could have written these words if he had been a defender of icon worship. We can, therefore, conclude that aniconism was welcome or tolerated by some Monophysite Syrians at the time, although they were hardly Byzantine iconoclasts. But what about the Melkites? Does Michael sug- gest that they were icon worshippers? In the passage quoted, it is perhaps the "Chalcedonians" as a whole who hate Constantine V - that is, mainly Greeks of the Byzantine Empire, whose bishops were summoned to the Council of 754. But the ban of the emperor on John of Damascus and two others was not just for being iconodule Chalcedonians, but "because they upheld the teaching of Máximos." This specification suggests a connection between the Maximites and the defense of icon worship, which might have been absent in other factions of the Melkites, like the Maronites, who were by no means a minority among the Syrian Chalcedonians.91 John of Damascus is singled out as the representative of one sector of the Melkite church. No patriarch of the Melkite Church is mentioned in the ban, which leads to the conclusion that other rep- resentatives of the Chalcedonian Church in the east, whether Maronites or not, did not follow John of Damascus in their theology of the icon. Might this have been the result of the control that "iconoclast" 89 Michael the Syrian (my translation) 4:473 (Syriac text) and 2:52i(French trans.) (ed. Chabot). 90 S.

We shall now consider this point. 4. Iconoclast Emperors and the Melkite Patriarchs Although our knowledge about the influence or pop- ularity of the emperor Leo III among the Melkites amounts to very little,92 evidence has been adduced, mostly by Auzépy,93 that the emperor Constantine V meddled in the ecclesiastical affairs of the Melkite churches. This intervention is important, as it might explain some of the divisions among the Melkites. Auzépy pointed, for instance, to the existence of an encomium to the saints Theodore the General and Theodore the Eastern, written by Theodore, archbishop of Antioch, and preserved in Arabic and Coptic. At some point in the Coptic version of the text, Theodore declares that he was appointed by the emperor Constantine: Now I call upon you, martyrs of my lord Jesus Christ, that you aid me in my feebleness, because I have taken courage and come into your midst at the will of the godfearing king Constantine and his officers and councillors.94 In order to prove Constantine s control of the Melkites, Auzépy also referred to a passage of the chronicle of Ibn al-Makīn, a Coptic writer of the thirteenth cen- tury, whose History , although based to a great extent on Tabari for the events of the caliphate, contains 92 In the Greek text of the Martyrdom of the Sixty Martyrs of Jerusalemy edited by A. Papadopoulos-Kerameus, "Muceničestvo sestidesjati novych svjatych mucenikov," PPSb 12, no. i (1892): 1-23, the emperor Leo III is referred to as ó rrjç òaíotç p&gt;1p)ç Aécov (§4). This indicates that Leo was already dead at the time, but was still popular among some eastern Christians, for the text seems to have been written by an author who lived in Syria and Palestine. The exe- cution of the sixty martyrs is said to have happened after they were imprisoned on their way to Caesarea about 724-25 and refused to convert to Islam; see G. Huxley, "The Sixty Martyrs of Jerusalem," GRBS 18 (1977): 369-74; and S. Efthymiadis, "The Sixty Martyrs of Jerusalem," in Christian-Muslim Relations: A Bibliographical History, vol. 1, (óoo-çoo), ed. D. Thomas and B.

According to the Latin translation of the text in the old edition of Thomas van Erp, the emperor Constantine V, after defeating the usurper Artabasdos, "ordered bishop Ishaq to be promoted to the post of patriarch over Antioch and the East because he had frequented him and served him before he reigned."95 In fact, the subject of the sentence in the Arabic text is an anonymous "emir," who must be identified with the Arab caliph Abū Ja far al-Mansùr (754-775); the latter is expressely said to have deposed a certain patri- arch George, who succeded Athanasios, who had, in turn, reigned only three days after the death of Ishaq. This intepretation is confirmed by the most prob- able source of this report, contained in the History of the Patriarchs by the Coptic historian Mawhùb ibn Mansùr ibn Mufarrij (1025-1100), where details are given, suppressed by Ibn al-Makīn, for the reasons that lead al-Mansùr to appoint Ishaq as patriarch, for he had foreseen the birth of his son. Moreover, as the caliph had "commanded that whoever should oppose him should be slain with the sword," the opposition of the Coptic patriarch of Alexandria to the new patriarch of Antioch and his appointment by the Muslims is described in extenso.96 A passage of Theophanes for the year 761/63 is also worth mention in this context. There we read that Kosmas, bishop of Epiphaneia, "on being accused by the citizens of Epiphaneia before Theodore, patri- arch of Antioch, concerning the alienation of conse- crated objects, and being unable to make them good, renounced the orthodox faith and gave his adherence to Constantines heresy directed against the holy icons." As a reaction, "by common consent, Theodore, patri- arch of Antioch, Theodore of Jerusalem, and Kosmas of Alexandria, together with their suffragan bish- ops, unanimously anathematized him on the day of 95 Al-Makīn, Historia Saracenica, qua res gestae Muslimarum, inde a Muhammede primo imperii et religionis muslimicae auc- tore, usque ad initium imperii Atabacei, per XLIX imperato- rum successionem fidelissime explicantur, insertis etiam passim Christianorum rebus in Orientis potissimum ecclesiis eodem tempore gestis , arabice olim exarata a Gergio Elmacino fil.

But it can be argued otherwise. First, the accusation made against Kosmas of Epiphaneia was of alienation of consecrated objects. It is not explicitly stated that he was anathematized on behalf of his iconoclasm. In fact, we know from Theophanes that one of the signatories of the anathema, the patriarch Theodore of Antioch, had been exiled in 756 for several years by the governor of Syria and Egypt, when it was discovered that he had "frequently" (du^vcõç) revealed to the emperor Constantine V through letters (sensitive?) information about the Arabs (tcl twv ApáPcov).98 If Theodore could act as an agent of Constantine, the emperors iconoclasm probably did not matter too much for him. Second, Epiphaneia, lying on the river Orontes south of Apamea, was undoubtedly a suffragan see of the patriarch of Antioch. It seems that bishop Kosmas, having been accused of theft, changed allegiance to the patriarch of Constantinople. As the emperor was Constantine V, he immediately became an iconoclast in the eyes of Theophanes. But, in reality, this affair might well have been a simple matter of jurisdiction and have provided the emperor an opportunity to interfere in the ecclesiastical matters of the East. The reaction of the patriarchs can be understood from this perspec- tive. Moreover, Theophanes says nothing of a synod or of a synodical letter of the three patriarchs ca. 767 (see below §5), but only refers to this incident. Had he known of a clearer stance of the patriarchs against iconoclasm in this period, he would undoubtedly have mentioned it. We can therefore conclude that no clear evidence has been preserved that Constantine V effectively inter- vened in the affairs of the Melkite church or decided 97 Theophanes, Chronographia 433-34 (ed. de Boor). 98 Theophanes, Chronographia 430: Kai èÇcopícrGrj ©eòSwpoç, ó 7rarpiápj(vjç Avrio^eíaç, &lt;1&gt;0&lt;5vcj) xwv Äpdßwv $iaß^y)0ei;, öti rej) ßaai^gl KcovoravTÍvcp S^Xo-Troieí rà rwv Äpctßcov $ià ypa^áTcov* Kalloiìròv 6 aúròç ZaVi|¿ Ú7rgpópiov ríGrjaiv eiç tvjv Mwaßtriv ^còpav 7rarpíSa re aůroú.

This does not mean, however, that the Melkites remained alien to Constantinople, which was its main supporter against rival churches. Perhaps the control exerted by the caliphs in Baghdad impeded the Melkites from con- tacting the emperors as regularly as they might have wished (as in the case of Theodore of Antioch), but con- sidering Constantines victorious military campaigns in the East, other possibilities might have appeared in the horizon. In fact, after the civil wars following the death of Harūn al-Rashīd in 809, the control exerted by Baghdad in Syria was somehow relaxed. After the victo- rious campaigns of the emperor Theophilos in eastern Anatolia in the first half of his reign, the three oriental patriarchs sent him a letter hailing him as a victorious emperor and complaining about the tyrannical rule of the Muslims: For there are three gifts from God, as one of the Fathers has said, kingship, prophecy, priest- hood, which are granted to the worthy. For this reason, divinely established and divinely rewarded Sire, we rejoice and take pleasure in the acts of bravery and prowess of your trium- phant divinely granted victory. For even if a region under tyrannical sway has separated us, nevertheless the way of divine power has not divided us, but bereft of our ancestral inheri- tance and subservient to a barbarian enemy, we go about all day, emaciated, mournful and sullen, waiting with divine hope for the for- mer state of our imperial happiness and most tranquil life to be restored once more, and to be allotted the mercies we enjoyed in the past, by command of the One who creates and changes all and transforms the shadow of death into light.99 99 J.

We must consider now some notices preserved in Greek and Latin sources about the existence of Melkite syn- ods condemning iconoclasm in the period between Hiereia (754) and Nicaea (787). Some scholars have taken these indications at face value, but their interpre- tation is more complex. In 767 Pope Constantine II sent a letter to King Pippin informing him that a synodica fidei addressed to his predecessor Pope Paul I by Theodore patriarch of Jerusalem had arrived in Rome during the same year. According to Constantine, this synodical letter of Theodore, which had the approval of the patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria (no names are given) and many other bishops {in quo et reliqui patriarchae ... et plurimi metropolitani episcopi orientalium partium visi sunt concordasse ), proved that the cult of holy images {fervor sanctarum imaginum ) was widely accepted in all the eastern sees {orientalibus partibus cunctis christianis inminet). Constantine handed out to the Frankish king the Greek original, along with a Latin translation {in Latino et Greco eloquio ).100 The Greek text has been preserved in the acts of the Council of Nicaea of 787, where it was read out.101 In his letter Theodore of Jerusalem rejects some argu- ments of the Council of Hiereia and defends icon worship. However, in the document copied at Nicaea, Theodore only asks the other patriarchs to endorse and eventually correct (eï ti eùp göfj èv aúroíç Seó(¿gvov é7ri§iop0G¡&gt;(7ga)&lt;;) his synodical letter. Nowhere is it stated that he actually gained their approval.102 The Jerusalemite author of the letter of credence for the eastern delegates at the council is the only one who maintains that Theodore received, while still living, the approbation of his synodical letter by Kosmas patriarch of Alexandria and Theodore patriarch of Antioch (rot àvTiauvoSiKà aůxwv).103 100 The original letter is collected in Codex Carolinus and was edited with no. 99 in MGH Ep 3, Epistolae Merowingici et Karolini Aevi, 1:650-53, see esp. 652.35-653.3 for the passage. 101 Mansi, 12:1135-46 (= Lambertz, Concilium [n. 25 above], pars prima, 254.4-268.7). 102 Mansi, i2:ii46B-C (= Lambertz, Concilium , pars prima, 268.3-4). 103 Mansi 12:1135!$ (= Lambertz, Concilium , pars prima, 254.10-11). Pope Hadrian also quoted Theodore's syn- odical letter in a4ong letter he wrote to Charles the Great ca. 791-94 in order to inform him about the proceedings of Nicaea II.104 There he mentions Theo- dorus patriarcha Ierosolimorum along with Cosmas Alexandriae and Theodorus alius Antiochie as the authors of a synodical letter sent to Pope Paul I. In the letter the three patriarchs explained in detail {subtili narratione) how the Oriental bishops and believers agreed with the Roman Church in the matter of icon worship {de sacratissimis imaginibus) and embraced the cult of the images of saints. Hadrian further informs his readers that the synodical letter was translated into Latin and its creed adopted in the Lateran council summoned by Pope Stephen in 769. He then quotes a passage of the synodical letter containing an anath- ema against those who do not accept the worship of the image or form of Christ {imaginem sive figuram domini nostri lesu Christi). Later in the letter, Hadrian quotes a second passage of the synodical letter of Theodore.105 Neither passage has any correspondence with the text of the synodical letter reproduced in the acts of Nicaea. These testimonia strongly confirm the existence in 767 of a synodical letter under the name of patriarch Theodore of Jerusalem that supports icon worship.106 It is a different question, however, whether the preserved text of this synodical letter, as used by the popes in 767, 769, and 791-94 and by the patriarch of Constantinople in 787, was genuine and, even most importantly, was endorsed by the whole Melkite church. On the question of the authenticity of the syn- odical letter, Auzépy has already remarked that the emphasis on Roman primacy in one of the two pas- sages quoted by the Pope Hadrian is undoubtedly an 104 MGH Ep 5, Epistolae Karolini Aevi , 3:5-57 (letter no. 2). 105 Ibid, ii and 23. 106 It might be that this is the same text that is mentioned in the Life of John of Gothia {AASS]unz 7:167-71, here 168 [§2]), where it is said that an unamed patriarch of Jerusalem sent to the saint a col- lection of "sayings on the holy icons and venerable relics" (^p&gt;1&lt;7eiç 7repl Twv íepwv ebcóvwv Kal rif-tíwv ^.giÝávcov), through the media- tion of an envoy. As no name of the patriarch is given, no clear infer- ences are possible. However, the connection of the reference to icons with relics appears relevant to me (see §§7-8 below, for con- sideration of relics in the period). The passage confirms that the text attributed to Theodore may have assumed the form of an anthol- ogy, similar to the one appended to the end of the Treatises Against the Iconoclasts of John Damascene. See Lilie, Prosopographie (n. 98 above), s.v. Theodoras I (von Jerusalem), no. 7575. DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="21">Melkites and Icon Worship during the Iconoclastic Period | 155 interpolation, forged in the papal chancellery. The anathema against iconoclasts preserved in the other passage can be suspected as well. Since neither passage is mentioned in the acts of Nicaea II, Auzépy suggests that the anathema was added to the original synodical letter by the papal chancellery along with the reference to Roman primacy in order to reinforce the prestige of the papacy before the Carolingians.107 The question, however, is whether the addition of these two passages was made in 791-94 or already in 767-69. Their absence from the acts of the Nicaea council, held in 787, is not necessarily a confirmation that the interpolation took place after the council, for it is possible that patriarch Tarasios suppressed from the text of the synodical letter all the passages where the Roman primacy was exalted, because they were contrary to the interests of the Constantinopolitan see. Thus, the interpolations might already have taken place in Rome in 767 or, alternatively, in 769. The existence of two interpolations does not, in itself, affect the iconodule character of the synodical letter, which was pointed out by Pope Constantine in 767 and confirmed by the reading in Nicaea II of other passages in which Theodore of Jerusalem rejected the Council of Hiereia and defended icon worship. Certainly, the two interpolations can be adduced as evidence that there were also other additions and that, accordingly, the original text was thoroughly reworked in its earliest stage in order to produce an uncom- promising iconodule document. This is what likely happened with the synodical letter sent by the three Melkite patriarchs to the emperor Theophilus in 836, which, as I mentioned above, was expanded with an iconodule dossier that completely altered its original purpose. However, we can question neither the authen- ticity nor the existence of the document simply on the basis of parallels or probabilities, especially as we do not have reliable textual evidence. But an examination of historical background will perhaps permit us to under- stand better the nature and purpose of this iconodule synodical letter of the three Melkite patriarchs. To begin with, we must inquire about what rea- sons the Melkites might have had at the time to make a general pronouncement on icon worshipģ As we have seen, the Islamic occupation does not provide an explanatory context. Further, any statement on 107 Auzépy, L'hagiographie (n. 71 above), 219-10. images would have made explicit a latent conflict in the Melkite church - the last thing they needed at the time. Some cogent reason is needed for putting icon worship on the agenda and sending a letter to the pope about it. A letter of patriarch Kosmas of Alexandria to Pope Paul I is mentioned by the pope himself in a letter he sent to King Pippin ca. 761-67.108 The letter dates to approximately the time when the synodical letter of Theodore of Jerusalem was also sent to Rome, appar- ently with the consent of the patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria (Kosmas himself). Now, the letter of Paul I does not say anything about the content of Kosmass letter, which was carried to him by a monk coming from Africa. We can doubt that it in fact referred to icon worship, for we would have expected, if that were the case, that Pope Constantine would have men- tioned it in connection with the letter later addressed by Theodore of Jerusalem to the same Paul, which was apparently subscribed by Kosmas. It thus appears likely that some kind of corre- spondence was taking place between Pope Paul and the Melkite patriarchs, which may well have been triggered, as Auzépy suggested,109 by recent attempts of Constantine V to meddle in the jurisdiction of the eastern patriarchates. If that is the case, the emphasis on the Roman primacy in the letter of Theodore might even have been authentic, rather than an interpolation (as Auzépy argues), for it allowed the Melkite prelates to appeal to Rome against Constantinople. In such a context, we can admit that the issue of the icons was mentioned. But the discussion of icons may have worked in the same manner as the filioque in Photioss time: as a leitmotif that rallied support among partisans and justified actions against other parties in the Church. Some members of the Melkite Church, who perhaps opposed the emperor, may well have addressed the pope and denounced the icono- clastic policy of Constantine V in order to vent some of their grievances. It is, therefore, conceivable that a section of the Melkite Church contacted the pope, though it is, of course, impossible to determine how representative such a group was of the whole Melkite community. Perhaps they were linked with the same 108 The letter was collected in the Codex Carolinus and is edited with no. 40 in MGH Ep 3, Epistolae Merowingici et Karolini Aevi, 1:552-53. 109 Auzépy, "Palestine à Constantinople" (n. 6 4 above), 226-27.

If these circles had been occasionally appoint- ing their own patriarchs rather than those aligned with the emperor, this might explain, retrospectively, why Hiereia did not mention patriarchs among the sup- porters of John of Damascus and why Theophanes used ambiguous words to characterize them. These Melkite iconodules might have received some support from the Muslim authorities for their defiance of the emperor, especially given the connections that the family of John of Damascus, the mighty Mansùrs, had with local potentates.110 They might have occasionally succeeded in presenting themselves as the legitimate representa- tives of the entire Melkite Church or even usurped the representation of the actual patriarchs of their Church, a not unparalleled event, as we saw in §3. This reconstruction of events is highly specu- lative, for we do not have direct evidence about the nature of internal rivalries among the Melkites in these years; even the sequence of the patriarchs is uncertain. However, it may be that the patriarch of Jerusalem took the lead in the approach to the papacy, eventu- ally relying on the support of a significant group of the Palestinian clergy and of the mighty monasteries of the region. Although pilgrimage to the Holy Land from Western countries experienced an upsurge only toward the end of the tenth century,111 there were surely close 1 10 For the family background of John, see Lilie, Prosopographie (n. 98 above), s.v. Ioannes Damaskenos (no. 2969). A Stephen Mansùr, relative of John of Damascus, is known to have lived in the eighth century and written some hymns and hagiographies, among which the Martyrdom of Romanos the Younger and the Martyrdom of the Twenty Martyrs of Saint Savas have descended to us. In the first of these two works, which survives only in Georgian, there is very hostile characterization of a gang of iconoclast Greeks who, led by an archon called George, opposed Romanos and his fellow Christians because of their support for icons when all were put in the same prison by the Arabs. Unfortunately, this text informs us only of the iconodulia of the author, but not of a supposed division among Melkites because of icon worship, for both groups in the prison are Byzantine Greeks. It is not said that the Syrians who help Romanos in the prison are Melkites. For a Latin translation of the Martyrdom of Romanos, see P. Peeters, "S. Romain le néomartyr (ti mai 780)," AB 30 (1911): 409-27. See also D. H. Vila and M. Nanobashvili, "Stephen Mansùr," in Thomas and Roggema, Christian-Muslim Relations (n. 92 above), 387-96. Ill See now J. Shepard, "Holy Land, Lost Lands, Realpolitik : Imperial Byzantine Thinking about Syria and Palestine in the Later contacts between Rome and Jerusalem through the presence of numerous Palestinian ("Syrian") monks in Italy since the end of the seventh century.112 The smaller Melkite community of Alexandria might have eventually lent support to the initiative of the Jerusalem patriarch, but only if we grant that icons were more pre- sent in Egypt than elsewhere in the region, because of the deep-rooted iconographie traditions of the Coptic Church (see §10 below). On the other hand, Melkites of the big cities of Syria might not have been so enthusias- tic about the defense of the icons made by some of their Palestinian brothers. But there is still another approach to this ques- tion, considering it from the perspective of the Roman see, rather than the Eastern Melkites. From this per- spective, it is perhaps revealing that the Melkite legates allegedly tried to engage Romes support precisely by referring to icons - that is, they must have known that Rome was sensitive to the problem of icon worship. In fact, the cause of the images was slowly being embraced by the Roman see since the outbreak of iconoclasm in Byzantium in 726. Let us now briefly review the facts. According to the Liber Pontificalis ,113 Pope Gregory III (731-741), on hearing about the persecution of icons ( depositionem et destructionem sacrarum imagi- num) undertaken by the emperors Leo and Constantine, sent the presbyter Gregory to Constantinople with commonitoria scripta defending icon worship. Gregory allegedly arrived in Constantinople but was unable to present the case, out of fear of reprisals. Upon his return to Rome, he faced the anger of the pope, who wanted to remove him from the priesthood. He was, however, finally given a penance and sent again to the eastģ This time he could not reach the imperial capital, for an order of the emperors detained him in Sicily for a whole 10th and nth Centuries ?

At this news, a council was called in Rome, where it was decided that whoever proceeded against the defenders of the ancient use prevailing in the apostolic see {antiquae consuetudinis apostolicae ecclesiae tenentes fidelem usum) and pulled down, destroyed, or defiled {depositor atque destructor et profanator) the images of Jesus Christ, the Virgin, the Apostles, or the saints, should be excommunicated. The bishops attending the council solemnly {solemniter) signed this declaration and added it to the decisions already taken by previous popes (in this same sense?). Again, alia similiter scripta commonitoria were sent to Constantinople through the defensor Constantine, but the message was intercepted, and he remained in detention for almost a whole year ( pene per annum integrum ). Then, Constantine was set free and sent back to Rome amid insults. After that, all Italy ( generalitas istius provinciae Italiae) united in the defense of images and sent, by unanimous consent (i unanimiter ), supplicationis scripta to the emperors, but their bearers were again detained in Sicily by the impe- rial stratēģos Sergios, now for eight months, before being sent back to Rome amid repeated insults. This chain of failures did not, apparently, discourage the Roman curia, which in a fourth and last attempt sent adhortatorias litteras in defense of the images through the defensor Peter. We are not told about the end of this last mission. No other source informs us about these repeated attempts of the Roman pope to defend images in the face of their alleged persecution by the Byzantine emperors. Does the apparent failure of the four mis- sions to convey the message of the popes to the emper- ors explain this silence of the oriental sources? How could iconophile Greeks have failed to quote in extenso documents of the papal chancellery condemning icono- clasm at so early a date? Indeed, doubts have recently been raised about the existence of such a decision against iconoclasm at an early Roman council, consid- ering, among other things, that it is "odd for the acts of a synod held in Italy in the early 730s to pre-empt argu- ments not elaborated in the eastern sources until the 740s or even later."114 As Brubaker and Haldon have proven in their recent book, iconoclasm under Leo III was never as extreme as is generally assumed in the 1 14 Brubaker and Haldon, Iconoclast Era (n. 2 above), 84-86 and, for the citation, 84 n. 57. sources.115 It was only under Constantine V that the conflict somehow escalated. Iconoclasm was not, there- fore, present in 731, 116 so the pope could not have come to the idea of excommunicating iconoclasts (including the emperor and the patriarch) nor could he have sent four successive embassies to Constantinople to han- dle this question.117 However, as the Liber Pontificalis provides us with precise names and a very plausible sequence of embassies (complete with the duration of their detention in Sicily), it is quite probable that the embassies did, indeed, take place, but that they were sent to Constantinople for other reasons. The only catalyst for such a swift and unanimous {unanimiter) consent of the whole of Italy was not icon worship, but the takeover by the Empire of the admin- istration and revenues of the papal patrimonial lands in Sicily and Calabria.118 The recent loss of Africa (699) had deprived the Empire of its most important source of corn, thus making the direct control of Sicily a stra- tegic issue.119 The council probably dealt with these matters, and if icon worship came to the agenda, it could only have been to exert pressure on the Empire.120 Moreover, the possibility that the text of the Liber Pontificalis has been interpolated, as Speck suggests and Brubaker and Haldon accept,121 must not be ruled out. Alternatively, the writer of the biography of Gregory 115 They base their conclusions to a great extent on the detailed analysis of the sources of Paul Speck, who wrote abundantly on the topic in many publications, to which Brubaker and Haldon refer constantly in their footnotes. 116 For the alleged attack against iconoclasm in the letters of Pope Gregory II to Leo III, see again Brubaker and Haldon, Iconoclast Era , 91-94. T. F. X. Noble, Images , Iconoclasm , and the Carolingians (Philadelphia, 2009), 117, considers the letters of Gregory II "so cor- rupt that they cannot be put in the dock and interrogated." He fur- ther argues that "the relatively few surviving (papal) letters from the period 726 to 750 address various concerns but never raise the issue of images, Byzantine heresy or papal defense of the faith." 1 17 The sequence is also illogical: excommunications are to be expected only after negotiations fail, but not before they take place at all. 1 18 Brubaker and Haldon, Iconoclast Era, 86-87. 119 Ibid., 490-93. 120 For the economic background behind the confrontation of the Papacy with the Empire, see the convincing arguments put for- ward by F.

It is reasonable to suppose that the 769 council dealt with the issue of icon worship for the first time and did not reconfirm the acts, deci- sions, and canons of the council of 731. The contexts of the two councils were different. No Melkites are men- tioned in any source in relation to the council of 731, except for the pope himself, Gregory III, natione Syrus , but the situation is different for 769, as we shall see. Moreover, the fabrication of a Latin iconophile flori- legium concerning images, based on a previous Greek model,123 appears more probable in 769, when a syn- odical letter of the Oriental patriarchs was endorsed. It is now time to consider this synod in some detail. As a matter of fact, there was no special debate on icons in 769. Just one session, the last of the synod, was devoted to the matter.124 The real reason for summoning the council was, rather, to legitimate the accession to the papal throne of Stephen III, who was elected in 768, after the deposition and imprisonment of Pope Constantine. The latter had been elected pope scarcely a year earlier in 767, at the death of Paul I, owing to the influence of the Duke of Tuscany, his likely 122 Noble, Images (n. 116 above), 116-14, reviews the literary evi- dence for the defense of icon worship by the popes ca. 726 to ca. 760 and finds only a few passages in the lives of Popes Gregory II and Gregory III of the Liber Pontificalis that deal with this matter (and especially with the 731 council). Strikingly, later popes until Paul I (757-767) seem to wholly ignore the issue of icons. Although Noble does not question the authenticity of the defense of icon worship in 731, he does not fail to notice the problem. 1 23 In the letter of Pope Hadrian to Charles the Great (mentioned above, n. 104), he refers (p. 15) to multorum sanctorum patrum testi- monia collected by Gregory II in the council of 731. Grounding his argument on this evidence, Alexakis, Codex Parisinus Graecus his (n. 77 above), 37-41 and 134-35, dated the pre-existent Greek flo- rilegium to 725-29, before the council of 731. However, and despite an ambiguous reference in Liber Pontificalis 477, there is no further source that confirms that such a florilegium was, in fact, prepared by Gregory for the council. The testimony of Hadrian, following Nicaea II, is highly suspect; see, however, Noble, Images , 119-23. 1 24 W. Hartmann, Die Synoden der Karolingerzeit im Frankreich und in Italien (Munich, Vienna, and Zürich, 1989), 84-86. See also Mansi, 12:720-22; and Liber Pontificalis 476-77 (ed. Duchesne). brother.125 But Constantines election did not please the influential Greek primicerius Christopher, who had been the chief of the chancellery during the papacies of the brothers Stephen II (752-757) and Paul I (757- 767);126 and so, Christopher caused the Sicilian priest Stephen to be elected as the new pope. Legitimation for this deposition was needed, and it was found in the fact that the blinded Constantine had been elected while a layman (he is nowadays usually considered an anti- pope). The council in the Lateran with the presence of Frankish bishops sanctioned the election of Stephen III and considered the validity of the decisions taken by Constantine during his short reign. What was the significance of a statement about icon worship that was passed in a hurry in the last session? Auzépy argues for the central importance of Greek monks from the powerful monastery of Saint Sabas, fierce defenders of icon worship who were the main supporters of Christopher and Stephen III. Constantine was, in fact, imprisoned in their monas- tery. The defense of icon worship was, thus, a conces- sion to the influential Sabaïtes. They are likely also to be held responsible for the endorsement of the synodical letter of the patriarchs of Jerusalem, for they obviously had close connections with their homonymous mother house in Palestine, whence they ultimately came to Rome ca. 647-53, when the Roman monastery of Saint Sabas was founded.127 lhe opportunity for the Sabaïtes to intervene in the Roman curia perhaps arose as a consequence of the repeated attempts of Emperor Constantine V to engage the Frankish King Pippin in an alliance with Byzantium to the disadvantage of the pope. Byzantine embassies to the Franks followed shortly afterward in the years 757, 760, 763-64, and 766-67. A marriage of Pippins daughter Gisela to Leo IV was even planned. 125 For this reconstruction of the events, I follow M.-F.

In the Council of Gentilly of 767, held at the Frankish court, Byzantine "iconoclasm" was rejected. The marriage alliance did not take place, and there were no further contacts between Constantine V and the Franks.128 It is, then, most probably in the 760s that the Sabaïtes confected a dossier of iconophile texts to prove that the Romans adhered more faithfully than the Greeks to the ancient traditions of the Church. The Lateran Council of 769 officially endorsed it and presented it as a decision of the Council of 731. Even if T. F. X. Noble is correct that the issue of the images was dealt with in the Lateran Council of 769 due to Frankish pressure,129 this cannot have failed to make the Sabaïtes' help more instrumen- tal than ever in the popes strategy to win the Franks over to his cause. The influence of the Palestinian Sabaïtes over the papal curia extended over the entirety of the eighth century and affec ted even the artistic orientation of the papacy toward Greek models. It had already begun in the seventh century, when the Sabaïtes came to Rome, but increased continuously during the eighth.130 It culminated in the ninth century, when Pope Paschal I developed a whole iconographie program.131 Moreover, the Sabaïtes, with a richly endowed library, also had a theological background, which was much needed by the papacy. Many texts produced at the time in the papal curia were probably written under their influence, beginning with a Greek iconophile 128 I follow here the reconstruction of the events made by M.

Alexakis even asks whether one should "connect the arrival of the Damascene works in Rome with the sending of the Synodica rectae fidei of the three Oriental patriarchs," as this synodical letter also included an iconophile florilegium.133 More importantly, the Sabaïtes are responsible for the composition of the iconodule florilegium of the Parisinus Graecus 11 15. This florilegium was the main and almost the only source for the iconophile dossier used in the Council of Nicaea in 787. It was no acci- dent that the papal ambassador to Byzantium in 786, on the eve of the council, was the abbot of the mon- astery of St. Sabas.134 As we have seen, probably one Sabaïte composed ca. 770 the Adversus iconoclastas, a furious iconophile pamphlet written with the inten- tion of endowing the whole florilegium with an intro- ductory piece that could serve to refute the Horos of the Hiereia council of 7$ 4. 135 Other notorious works of the period that aimed at refuting iconoclasm - like the Nov$e&lt;r(cc yépovroç nepì tóòv âyícov síxóvcúv , the Greek letters of Gregory II to Leo III, or the Adversus Constantinum Caballinum (see §3 above) - probably originated in Sabaïte circles as well.136 Lastly, the expanded iconodule version of the letter of the three Melkite patriarchs to the emperor Theophilos ca. 836 132 Thuno, Image and Relic , 131-56. 133 Alexakis, Codex Parisinus Graecus ins (n. 77 above), 134-37. 134 Mansi, 12:989-90 and 994A (= Lambertz, Concilium [n. 25 above], pars prima, 12.12-13 and 18.10-14). 135 Alexakis, Codex Parisinus Graecus his, 98-99, esp. n. 23, and Auzépy, "Sabaïtes" (n. 125 above), 309. 136 Alexakis, Codex Parisinus Graecus 1115, 110-23. The Nou- thesia gerontos is perhaps the most problematic piece of the whole complex, for the concluding paragraph of the work expressly states that it was composed in Syria. If that is true, it would con- firm the continuing connections between the Roman Sabaïtes and some Palestinian Melkite monasteries, but it is, again, not to be advanced as proof of an overwhelming Melkite support for icon worship.

Further, it is crucial that some of these texts, like the famous Constitutum Constantini ,138 were reputed to be forgeries or inter- polated versions of previous works.139 We see a sys- tematic rewriting of the history of iconoclasm through the agency of a group of Greek monks in Rome who appeared as the authoritative source for the eastern patriarchates. Any information provided by these cir- cles about the support of the Melkites for icon worship is to be approached with the utmost care. The text of the synodical letter of 767 is no exception. It is worth adducing here an interesting paral- lel that is relevant to our argument. Rudolf Riedinger has established that, contrary to expectation and to communis opinio , the Greek version of the acts of the Council of Lateran of 649, which was controlled by the followers of Máximos the Confessor, is the original and the Latin a translation. This conclusion initially appears odd, as the council was held in Rome, and Latin was obviously the language used in the sessions. But the influence of the learned Greek Maximites over the less intellectually accomplished Latin curia was apparently so great that they were able to produce, first, a Greek draft of the decisions they wanted to be endorsed by the Roman council, then a Latin transla- tion to be given to the assembly of western bishops. This Latin version, prepared, as Riedinger proves, by the Byzantines themselves, was read aloud in five 137 Signes Codoñer, Emperor Theophilos (n. 24 above), chap. 21. 138 For this text, the most famous of the falsifications of the Middle Ages, see the recent study of J. Fried, Donation of Constantine and Constitutum Constantini : The Misinterpretation of a Fiction and its Original Meaning, Millennium Studien 3 (Berlin and New York, 2006), who convincingly connects the forgery not with the papacy, as usually assumed, but with the monastery of St. Denis and the fig- ure of Hilduinus. He concludes that the text of the Donatio was written ca. 830-33 following an extensive exchange between the monasteries of Corbie and St. Denis. If this interpretation is con- firmed, it would have far-reaching consequences for our understand- ing of the period. 139 Auzépy, "Sabaïtes," 309-10. consecutive sessions held in October 649 and finally approved by the synod, thus making a council state- ment out of the opinions that Máximos had previously defended privately.140 This is irrefutable evidence of the free hand that the Greek Maximites had in direct- ing (and, accordingly, in manipulating) the decisions of the Roman popes at the time. Why should we sup- pose that it was any different a century later with the iconodule Sabaïtes? In the interest of balance, we can take for granted the existence of a party of defenders of icon worship in the Melkite Church, who managed through the agency of the Sabaïte emigrants to be influential in the papal curia (as were the followers of Máximos a cen- tury earlier). They helped the pope to present himself as the true champion of the tradition of the Church against Byzantine iconoclasm, thus putting an end to the impending alliance between the two empires. However, it is by no means assured that the whole Melkite Church followed their views about icon wor- ship. These views might even have developed in the context of the struggle to win the Frankish kingdom over to the cause of Rome and have aquired some grounding only in Palestine (in the monasteries?) and the Jerusalem patriarchate since the 760s, but not nec- essarily earlier or in other areas of Syria. To prove this point, we shall now turn our attention to the existing evidence for support of icon worship coming from the Antiochene patriarchate. 6. The Iconodule Synod of Antioch in Theodore of Stoudios In a letter to John the Grammarian (probably the later iconoclast patriarch),141 written ca. 821-26, 142 Theodore of Stoudios copies a defense of icon wor- ship from a synod held in Antioch under the patriarch Theodoret (tv]&lt;; èv Amovía cjuvóSod S7ti 0goScop&gt;ļToi&gt; írarpiáp^OD).

DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="27">Melkites and Icon Worship during the Iconoclastic Period | 161 letter that Theodore wrote to the emperors Michael and Theophilos in 826. 143 Auzépy, basing her argument on the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of Bar Hebraeus, where "the patriarch of the Greeks" named Theodoret is said to have been exiled for nine years between 764 and 775, concluded that this Theodoret summoned a council about the images before 764. 144 Accordingly, the council prob- ably met before the composition of the synodical let- ter by Theodore of Jerusalem in 767, the authenticity of which we discussed above. This raises problems: the evidence that we have so far gathered suggests that in 767 Theodore of Jerusalem requested from a patriarch of Antioch, also named Theodore, endorsement of his iconodule synodical letter, while a certain Theodoret, also known to have been patriarch of Antioch, was in prison in Baghdad, after summoning a synod on the icons before 764. Considering the similarity of names, it is tempting to suggest a confusion between them in the sources - namely, that Bar Hebraeus sub- stituted the patriarch Theodoret for Theodore. In fact, Theodoret is usually considered to have ruled as patri- arch of Antioch ca. 785-99, after the reign of Theodore (757- ca. 785).145 On this argument, the Melkite patriarch Theodoret mentioned by Theodore of Stoudios held a synod on the images between 785 and 799 - that is, shortly before or sometime after the synod of Nicaea II in 787. This scenario, however, fails to convince, for if the synod had met before, it would have been men- tioned at Nicaea II; yet the representatives of the east- ern patriarchs, of dubious legitimacy,146 are absolutely silent on the point. If, on the other hand, Theodoret summoned a synod after Nicaea II, it could only have had the purpose of endorsing the decision previ- 143 Ibid., no. 532, 11. 219-46, where the text is presented as (1&gt;&amp;)VV| row sv 'AvTio^eia aimSpeucrávTcov 7raTgpwv. 144 J.

See also §7 below, for the patriarch Theodoret of Antioch in connection with the biog- raphy of Theodore Abù Qurra. 146 See n. 71 above. ously passed by the Constantinopolitan council. We can, therefore, surmise that patriarch Theodoret was impeded from attending Nicaea II in 787 or even from sending representatives to it, so that he felt obliged to remedy this deficiency some time later in order to ingratiate himself with the new iconodule authorities in Byzantium. But this is, of course, pure conjecture. Unfortunately, we have no further information about this iconophile synod held in Antioch. Neither dating nor circumstance is known. Theodore of Stoudios' use of evidence from the synod in a letter to the last iconoclast emperors proves only that he con- sidered the text authentic. However, as I have shown elsewhere,147 Theodore did not succeed in getting in touch with the Melkite prelates, so he probably did not obtain information about the synod from them. From where, then, did he get this evidence? Might the Palestinian Sabaïte refugees in the monastery of Chora in Constantinople,148 even the same Michael the Synkellos and the brothers Graptoi who are the main characters of the Life of Michael the Synkellos , be responsible for conveying some report of the Antiochian synod to Theodore? They were, after all, contemporaries and sided together against the icono- clasts. Still, we do not have any evidence supporting this conjecture. On the contrary, when Michael the Synkellos travelled to Constantinople, surely before 815, the second iconoclast crisis had not yet started.149 Perhaps a closer look at the two letters in which Theodore mentions the Antiochian synod may prove fruitful. The information Theodore provides about the council in both letters consists of the same three pas- sages, which are copied one after the other without any further context. It is immediately clear that they are extracts from a longer text, for the first passage lacks a main verb and has three nominative pendent parti- ciples; the second passage begins with an adversative 147 J. Signes Codoñer, "Theodore Studite and the Melkite Patriarchs on Icon Worship," in L'aniconisme dans l'art religieux byzantin , ed. P. Magdalino and J. L.

Moreover, the second and third passages are introduced by the same phrases in both letters: Kai [ ¿g0' gxgpa ("and after some other things") in the second and Kaì okí ya ("and after a few things") in the third.150 It certainly could be that Theodore twice extracted exactly the same passages from a text at his disposal and that he introduced the passages in the same way. But it could also be that he did not know anything more about this council except for these three quotations. Otherwise, one would have expected more specific details about the council (dating, occasion, etc.), either in these two letters (and especially in the one addressed to the emperors) or in any other written by Theodore. This silence is even more suspect as Theodoret was, in fact, the Melkite patriarch of Antioch when the council of Nicaea II was summoned, a council about which Theodore of Stoudios felt uncomfortable, to say the least.151 The way the Antioch synod is referred to in both letters provides further evidence of the fragmentary character of the information available to Theodore. In the letter addressed to the emperors (no. 532), Theodore, after a prologue in which he justifies his address to Michael and Theophilos (11. 5-31), refers to the definition of the Trinity and the nature of Christ, as established by the seven ecumenical coun- cils, including Nicaea II (11. 32-48). This last synod, according to Theodore, based its defense of icon wor- ship in four kinds of argument, which he develops in the rest of the letter (11. 48-50): the natural creed (sk re &lt;1&gt;d(71KOí3 Sòy^aroç), that is to say, the natural explanations for admitting icon worship, based on the testimony of the Bible (11. 48-114); the sayings of the Fathers (írapá Tg 7raTpiKWV ^piļagcov) (11. 115-201); the decisions of the councils (žk Tg ctuvoSikcov gK(ļ&gt;cov&gt;ļorgcov) (11. 202-50); and the "ancient decrees" (rcapà àp^aíaiç 0g(7[xo0£(7Íai&lt;;), meaning, in fact, the apostolic tradi- tion of the Church (11. 251-70). It is the third section that interests us here. Theodore quotes only two coun- cils, the Quinisextum of 692, specifically the famous canon 82 (11. 201-28), and the Antioch synod (11. 228- 50). The Quinisextum is referred to as the "decision 150 Theodore of Stoudios, Letters no. 528, 11. 80-81 and 90-91 = no. 532, 11. 234 and 244 (ed. Fatouros). 151 See P.

The Antiochian synod is, in turn, simply introduced as "a decision of the Fathers who assembled in Antioch" (&lt;1&gt;covr) TGÓV iv Avxio^g ią, cnmSpgucrávTGOv îrarépcov, 11. 228-29), without any chronological indication. After this, the three extracts and a final comment of Theodore of Stoudios follow (11. 246-50). This simple exposition surprises the reader, in the utter absence of any other source for this council. In the letter to John the Grammarian (no. 528), written probably in the same year as the letter to the emperors (826), Theodore first sends a copy of the letter he had written to Athanasios (no. 428), where his position about icon worship was expounded. But Theodore then introduces further passages that rein- force his defense of the icons: a quotation of John Chrysostom (11. 69-74), the three extracts from the Antioch synod (11. 75-93), and a short quotation from Nicaea II (11. 94-96). The compilation of these passages into a little anthology is revealed by the fact that the second extract from the Antiochian synod refers, as an authority, to the passage of Chrysostom that is quoted in extenso in the first place. Specifically, the passage is taken from In natale sancti Ioannis prophetae , a work currently considered spurious.152 We cannot be sure what came first, the quotation of Chrysostom or the extracts from the Antiochian synod referring to it - although the second option seems more likely, since only one of the three extracts from the Antiochian synod referred to Chrysostom. In any case, the inter- connection between all these passages seems evident and is typical of florilegia. The short quotation from Nicaea II at the end also seems strange for Theodore of Stoudios, who could have copied extensively from this council had he access to a copy of its acts. I sus- pect, therefore, that these quotations just happened to come into the hands of Theodore as part of an icono- dule anthology. He probably used them first in his let- ter for John and then for a second letter to Michael and Theophilos, where he naturally suppressed the other two quotations (of Chrysostom and of Nicaea II) that made clear the anthologie nature of his source. 152 PG 61:757-62. DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="29">Melkites and Icon Worship during the Iconoclastic Period | 163 The Roman Sabaïtes are, once again, a likely source of this little anthology, for, as we saw above, they had extracted texts and prepared florilegia for Nicaea II, like the one transmitted by Parisinus Graecus 1115.153 The likelihood that Theodoret was the Melkite patri- arch of Antioch at the time of Nicaea II makes it even more likely that the anthology, which included three extracts from the Antioch synod, was prepared in con- nection with the ecumenical council. The wording of these three extracts permits no further conclusion, although the terms ^apaKTiļp (as immaterial image) and el kcov (the material icon) are used with consistency and in a very technical way, which can be explained only if we suppose a deep reflec- tion on the topic in the text that originally included the extracts. It seems, therefore, unwarranted to conclude that the text was a forgery, although it was not, perhaps, originally approved in a synod. 7. Theodore Abū Qurra The second half of the eighth century witnesses the increasing importance of the Arabic language for the Melkites, culminating in the work of Theodore Abū Qurra, one of the most famous Melkite theologians of the period.154 He is author of an important corpus of works, written mostly in Arabic (with more than forty short Greek texts).155 Most important for us here is his Arabic treatise On the Veneration of the Holy Icons, where he develops the arguments put forward by the Damascene and adds new ones to the debate.156 But before commenting upon the text, we shall briefly review his biography. Abù Qurras life stretched from 755157 to 830. He passed most of it in the Middle East as the Melkite bishop of the Syrian city of Harrān, for which he was known in the sources.158 He seems also to have had close connections with Palestine and Jerusalem, where he probably made a pilgrimage.159 Moreover, Abū Qurra is also known to have written a letter to the Armenians on behalf of the patriarch of Jerusalem.160 On the other hand, any membership, however temporary, of Abū Qurra in the Palestinian monastery of Mar Sabas must be rejected.161 Chronological reasons also prevent him from ever having been a disciple of John of Damascus, whose connection with the same monastery has also been recently questioned.162 Finally, contrary to frequent conjecture, Abū Qurra never traveled to Baghdad.163 The many gaps in the evidence about Abú Qurra s life make any account uncertain, but no preserved testimony links him with any public discussion or 153 See Alexakis, Codex Parisinus Graecus his (n. 77 above), and Auzépy, "Sabaïtes" (n. 125 above), 309-10. 154 For Abù Qurra in general, see S.

J. C. Lamoreaux, "Theodore Abù Qurrah and John the Deacon," GRBS 42 (2001): 361-86, argues that only the first nine texts of this collection are actually based on Theodore's works; he suspects (along with S. H. Griffith, "The Monks of Palestine and the Growth of Christian Literature in Arabic," The Muslim World 78 [1988]: 1-28, esp. 22-23) that most of the Greek works appearing under Theodore's name were not originally written by him. 156 For an English translation of the text, see S.

This is in contrast with John of Damascus, anathematized in the Hiereia council for his defense of images. For this reason, it is important to consider now in more detail three circumstances of Abù Qurra s biography that might eventually shed some light on his attitude to icon worship. The first is the removal of Abū Qurra from his episcopal see at Harrān by Theodoret, the Melkite patriarch of Antioch, as reported by Michael the Syrian, in connection with the later travels of Abù Qurra to Alexandria and Armenia.164 Michael states that Abū Qurra "had been for a short time bishop of Harrān and had been deposed by their patriarch Theodoret because of charges brought against him." If patriarch Theodoret was, indeed, in charge between 785 and 799, as it is generally agreed,165 the removal of Abū Qurra would have taken place in the last years of the eighth century. Michael does not substantiate the nature of the charges against the bishop, which prompted Sidney Griffith to conjecture that Abū Qurra was removed for his stub- born and open defense of icon worship.166 There is, however, no explicit testimony in the sources in support of this hypothesis. In fact, this same Theodoret is held responsible for summoning a council in defense of the images, as we have seen above in §6.167 Nevertheless, in the passage of Michael the Syrian quoted above Theodore is charged with propagating the doctrine of Máximos the Confessor among the countries he visited. As we saw above in §3, John of Damascus is also connected with the Maximites. Thus, the shared arguments used by John and Abū Qurra in defense of the icons might be explained as a result of their common adherence to the same theological movement, rather than as a consequence of a personal 164 Michael the Syrian 4:495 (Syriac text) and 3:32 (French trans.) (ed. Chabot). See Griffith, Theodore Abū Qurrah ; 15-16, idem, "Reflections," 145-47; and idem, Treatise on the Veneration , 7-9, for an interpretation of the passage. 165 See Nasrallah, "Regard critique" (n. 145 above), 59-60 (in n. 55 he refers to his Chronologie des patriarches d'Antiochie de 7s0 à 1250, a work in press but never published); and idem, Histoire , 16 and 112. According to Auzépy, L'hagiographie (n. 71 above) 222-23, Theodoret was patriarch before 764, as he was in jail in Bagdad dur- ing nine years after this date. 166 Griffith, Theodore Abü Qurrah , 32-33; idem, "Reflections," 164-67; and idem, Treatise on the Veneration , 19-20. 167 See §6 above for a possible reference to this Theodoret by Theodore the Studite. relationship between them. But this is clearly not ground enough to support further conjectures. The second element in the life of Abū Qurra that might be informative on his iconodule stance is his connection with a famous Melkite iconodule, Michael the Synkellos. As noted above, Theodore Abū Qurra composed a Christological treatise, addressed to the "heretical" church of Armenia, on behalf of Thomas, the patriarch of Jerusalem. The title of the work not only indicates that the text was composed in Arabic by Theodore himself on behalf of the patriarch, but fur- ther specifies that it was "translated by the presbyter Michael, synkellos of the apostolic throne, with which it was also delivered [i.e., to the Armenians]".168 As Thomas was apparently appointed patriarch in 807, the treatise would have been composed after this date. The terminus ante quem is provided by Michaels depar- ture for Constantinople (where he seems to have been sent by Thomas in an embassy to the emperor), for he never returned to the caliphate. The embassy has been variously dated to 814, at the beginning of the reign of Leo V, or to the reign of Michael I (811-813).169 There is another possible connection between Abū Qurra and Michael Synkellos, for we know that Michael composed his famous treatise on Greek syntax in Edessa, at the request of a deacon Lazaros, labeled "philosopher and logothete" in the title of the work.170 Michael could certainly have stopped at Edessa on his way to Armenia bearing the text sent by the patriarch of Jerusalem, but we need not suppose that the trip that Abū Qurra himself made to Armenia some time after 813 (according to Michael the Syrian)171 was part of the same mission of Michael the Synkellos.172 If Abū Qurra 168 PG 97:i504Ü: Sia $è Mi^av]! 7rpeaßuTepou, Kai cnjyKŚ&amp;ou àizovTokiKOv 0póvou [igxa&lt;ļ)pac70giaa, f¿g0' oí Kai à7réoraXrai.

On the other hand, several stays of Abû Qurra in Jerusalem or of Michael the Synkellos in Edessa are perfectly conceivable. Regular contact between these men explains the composition of a theo- logical text by Abû Qurra for the Jerusalem patriarch and of a Greek syntax by Michael the Synkellos for the Edessans. This is significant, inasmuch as Michael the Synkellos, upon his arrival in Constantinople, revealed himself to be an impassioned defender of the icons. If he and Abù Qurra were united in their defense of icons, it might be that the departure of Michael the Synkellos, as well as the famous iconodule brothers Theodore and Theophanes Graptoi, for Constantinople, was related to the internal troubles of the Melkite church in Palestine.173 Auzépy even suggested that the reason for the travel of these three famous Palestinian iconodules was a confrontation with the patriarch of Jerusalem.174 A third fact of Abù Qurras biography bears on his supposed iconodulia. I refer now to his open dis- cussion with the caliph Mamùn on the latters visit to the city of Harrān in 829. 175 A Syrian chronicle reports that the debate was about the faith of the Christians 173 For Michael and the Graptoi, see Sode, Jerusalem - Konstantinopel - Rom. 174 Auzépy, "Palestine à Constantinople" (n. 64 above), 209-13. 175 For the text, see G.

Fortunately, I have been able to consult the English translation of the text by Wafik Nasry,179 who made it after collat- ing eleven manuscripts, the oldest of which dates to the fifteenth century. In the dialogue between the caliph and the bishop of Harrān, there is absolutely no discussion about icons or images. The Arabic word for "image" sūra ), usually applied also to icons, appears just twice: the first time for man as "image" of God, the second for Christ as "image" of the Father.180 The cross, however, figures prominently in the discussion between the Muslim theologians, who accuse the Christians of either wor- shipping or exalting the cross. In his defense, Theodore refers to the Black Stone at Mecca and argues that Christian kings put the cross on their banners because it brings victory and triumph - an argument very close to iconoclast propaganda, although evidently not exclu- sive to iconoclastic emperors.181 This work was certainly not originally written by Abû Qurra, but represents rather a distorted reflection of a historical debate that took place in Harrān in 829. Perhaps students of Abú Qurra or members of his cir- cle reported the dialogue, which was later interpolated, expanded, or altered.182 Despite these distortions, however, the text of the dialogue can yet represent Theodores original views.

Accordingly, if the preserved text of the debate with al-Mamùn is an approximate account of the actual dialogue with the caliph, the absence of any ref- erence to icons remains strange, for the dialogue took place toward the end of Abû Qurra s life and in Harrān, a city not far from Edessa, for whose famous mandylion of Christ our author had supposedly composed his trea- tise On the Veneration of the Holy Icons , as we shall see below. How could the Muslim have failed to denounce the treatise of Abû Qurra, if it were already in the pub- lic domain?184 Given that icon worship could not but be an obvious target of Muslim polemic writings, how could it have escaped mention? And why would a later compiler have erased or altered any possible references to icons in the original debate? We do have alternative explanations: either the treatise of Abû Qurra was not known at the time, or it was not his. Both possibilities combine, if we consider that the dialogue with Mamûn occurred toward the end of Abû Qurras life: the trea- tise On the Veneration of the Holy Icons could have circu- lated posthumously under his name, in which case Abû Qurra cannot be held responsible for all its content. This proposal, however, contradicts the usual accepted dating for the treatise, based on a concrete reference in the text. Let us now consider this point at some length. Among the arguments of Abû Qurra support- ing icon worship, he relates that "in our own day there was a well-known martyr from a family of the high- est nobility among the outsiders, whose story is wide- spread." He was called Anthony and "used to tell everyone he met that he came to believe in Christianity only because of a miracle he saw in connection with an icon that belonged to St. Theodore, the martyr."185 183 J. Lamoreaux, "New Works by Theodore Abù Qurrah, I: Against the Outsiders," in press. 184 The same silence on icons applies to another undated debate held in the 820s among Abù Qurra, the Jacobite Abû Ra ita, and the Nestorian metropolitan 'Abd Ishu ; for a summary, see S. T. Keating, "A Christological Dicussion," in Thomas and Roggema, Christian- Muslim Relations (n. 92 above), 553-55. 185 The translation is by Griffith, Treatise on the Veneration , 74. Nothing more is said about this Anthony, but fortu- nately a Passio of his has been preserved in Arabic, from which several versions derive.186 We learn that he was originally called Rawh al-Qurashī and was the nephew of the caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd (786-809). When still a Muslim he lived - as was usual at the time for mem- bers of the Muslim ruling families - in a dependency of a monastery situated in Nay rab, close to the north gate of the city of Damascus. Through a window in his apartment, Rawh had direct access to the church of the monastery, consecrated to St. Theodore, so that he was able, unnoticed, to witness liturgy. As he could not bear to contemplate the Christian rites, he entered frequently into the church to disturb the ceremonies, drinking from the chalice or tearing down the crosses. But one day, "when, after the liturgy was over, the priest closed the altar, pulled down the curtains, closed the church with the key and departed for his own business, the Qurashî youth watched toward the altar" and saw an image (sūra) of St. Theodore riding on a horse and piercing a serpent with his lance.187 When Rawh tried to shoot the icon with his bow, the arrow turned in 186 For different versions of the Arabic Passio and their possible interdependence, see P.

He did not tell anybody what had happened, but some days later, when a crowd was celebrating the Eucharist in the church, Rawh saw, instead of the hosts on the plate and the chalice, a white lamb, above which a dove flew. This second miracle achieved the conversion of Anthony and led, through a series of vicissitudes we need not retell here, to his execution by the caliph. For us, this story is of relevance because Rawh was executed by his uncle after Rawhs conversion to Christianity in 799, and this provides a terminus post quem for the writing of the treatise of Abū Qurra.188 However, this reference may well be a later interpolation, for the present version of Abû Qurras treatise seems to have expanded the original work at certain points.189 When reviewing the present essay, John Lamoreaux remarked that the chapter divisions and long section headings are not always an accurate description of the contents and "sometimes highlight the role of images in the text at the expense of its other items"; moreover, "the transitions from section to sec- tion are quite rough." He concludes that the treatise "is quite unlike anything else written by Theodore" and that "it may be that we are dealing with an abridgment of what was once a longer work." In fact, as Lamoreaux proves in a recent article, such a textual disposition is not exceptional for those works of Abù Qurra that have come to us through the efforts of compilers, as the cross- connections between Abù Qurras treatise Against the Outsiders , the Dialogue of Abü Qurrah at the Count of al'Mamün , and the so-called anonymous Summa theologiae arabica clearly prove.190 We will return to the consequences of this tangled history of transmis- sion, but for the moment it is sufficient to note that it is not problematic to suspect that a particular passage of the treatise on icons might be an interpolation. Indeed, irt the instance of the reference to Anthony, there are cogent reasons for interpolation. To begin with, the mention of the martyr Anthony appears rather unexpectedly, for it is the only 188 I. Dick, Théodore Abüqurra, Traité du culte des icônes : Introduction et texte critique , Patrimoine Arabe Chrétien 10 (Jounieh and Rome, 1986), 173. 189 To begin with, a later hand added the abstracts at the begin- ning of each chapter. Griffith, Treatise on the Veneration, 47 n. 90, detects an interpolation. 190 Lamoreaux, "New Works" (n. 183 above). reference to contemporary matters in the entire treatise. Moreover, a short version of the martyrdom of Rawh/ Anthony, preserved by both the Chronicle of S13 and by Michael the Syrian (who probably used Dionysios of Tell Mahrē as a source), does not mention any icon at all; here, the Eucharistie vision is the only miracle that causes the conversion of Anthony.191 In fact, in the Passio of Rawh it is only after the Eucharistie vision that the Qurayshî converts, whereas he keeps in secret his experience with the wonder-working icon of Theodore. If we consider that the iconoclasts laid emphasis on the Eucharist, against the power of the icons, it appears as if two modes of conversion are contrasted.192 Might it be that the reference to the wonder-working icon has been interpolated? A confirmation of this proposal is found in three further versions of the conversion of a Muslim emir to Christianity written about the same time:193 the so- called legend of the vision of Amphilog (preserved in Old Slavonic),194 the vision of Pachomios in Kurum of the Thebaid (preserved in Greek as a Aóyoç íoropiKÓç attributed to a certain Gregory "Decapolites"),195 and 191 Chronicle of 813 , in "Fragmenta chronici anonymi auctoris ad annum domini 813 pertinentia," ed.

(Louvain, 1905), 138-62 (Syriac text) and 183-96 (trans.), here particularly, 253-54 (text) and 192 (trans.); Michael the Syrian 4:487-88 (Syriac text) and 3:18-19 (French trans.) (ed. Chabot). See Binggeli, "Converting the Caliph" (n. 186 above), 80-81. Peeters, "L'autobiographie de S. Antoine" (n. 186 above), also edited a late Arabic version of the Passion (which is very similar to the Georgian), where the story is told in the first person, as if it were an autobiography. In this version Rawh shoots at the priest, but a short remark is inserted where the author declares in passing that he had previously shot at an icon. It looks like a gloss to the text made by someone who knew about the existence of the shot icon in other variants of the legend. 192 According to the convincing analysis of Monferrer Sala, "Šahādat al-qiddīs Mār Antùniyùs" (n. 186 above), 243, in the oldest Arabic version of the text it is God who produces the wonder of turn- ing back the arrow shot at the icon, whereas later versions attribute this power to the saint himself, which is more in accord with icono- dule theories about the intercession of saints through their icons. 193 I thank John C. Lamoreaux for the reference to these texts. 194 E. Kałużniacki, "Die Legende von der Vision Amphilog s und der Logos Historikos des Gregorios Dekapolites," ASP 25 (1903): 101-8. 195 PG 100:1201-12.

DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="34">l68 I JUAN SIGNES CODOÑER the Story of the Muslim Who Saw a Wondrous Vision in the Shrine of the Megalomartyr George in Lydda (in Arabic).196 In these three texts, an Arab emir enters a church (in the last two, it is dedicated to St. George) and witnesses a strange vision when the priest celebrates the Eucharist. In the Arabic text the description of the vision is as follows (trans. Lamoreaux): He saw a child who was seated on the [Table of] Preparation of the divine oblations. And then, as the priest began to pray and arrange the oblation, the Muslim saw him slaughter the child and drain his blood into the holy chalice, cut him into pieces, and place him on a splendid paten [diskos]. The Muslim wondered at this greatly, and was filled with anger and rage at the priest.197 The vision of the child being slaughtered at the Eucharist is different from the lamb and the dove of our version, but the typology is the same, and the con- sequence, the conversion of the emir, identical. Not to be overlooked is the reference to military saints (George or Theodore) in all these tales. In any case, the substi- tution of the lamb (that is, the symbolic representa- tion of Christ) for the child in the later versions may again point to an iconophile rewriting of the vision, which did not need to incorporate, as in the Passio of Rawh/Anthony, any reference to an icon in order to be accepted by an iconodule reader. Thus, the derivative character of the reference to the icon in the vision of Rawh/Anthony is confirmed, as is an ongoing process of the manipulation of texts so as to adapt them to the beliefs of the audience. Furthermore, the shooting of an icon of Saint Theodore is already mentioned among the Narrationes 19 6 J. Lamoreaux, "Hagiography," in The Orthodox Church in the Arab World , ed. A. Treiger and S. Noble (DeKalb, IL, forth- coming). He refers there to the parallels between the three texts in some detail and conjectures that the author of the Greek version, Gregory Dekapolites, must have originally been called Gregory of Diospolis - that is, the Greek name for Lydda, the place where the vision takes place in the Arabic versions. 197 The Greek version recounts the vision in this way: "The Saracen saw that the priest took in his hand a child which he slaugh- tered, drained the blood inside the cup, cut the body into pieces and placed them on the tray" (trans. Sahas). of Anastasios of Sinai (died after 700).198 The story now tells of a village called Karsatas, close to Damascus, where a church was consecrated to St. Theodore. One day a group of Arabs entered the church, and one of them shot an arrow against the icon of St. Theodore. The arrow stuck well into the icons shoulder, which started to bleed, to the amazement of the Muslims. Since they did not convert despite the miracle, they died a few days afterward. The author relates that the icon remained in the same place until his own lifetime. It is not coincidental that in both texts the tem- ple with a wonder-working icon of St. Theodore is near Damascus. The monastery is likely the same in both texts, although the name of the locality varies. We can then argue that the story of Anastasios of Sinai was reworked into the Passio of Rawh in order to embel- lish the narrative of the conversion of the saint, where the Eucharistie vision initially played the central role.199 Curiously enough, the reference in the Passio of Rawh to the killing of a dragon in the image may point to the interpolation having been made during the icon- oclastic period, for the image of the riding emperor killing a dragon was promoted by Constantine V as a symbol of his fight against idolatry, and, accordingly, St. Theodore became very popular among iconoclasts.200 It is a remarkable paradox that the only icon of a saint mentioned in the work of Abū Qurra was one of the military saints most popular amongst the iconoclasts. Moreover, this would make the image not just an object of worship, but part of the decoration of the church. 198 The passage of Anastasios Sinaites was edited by F. Nau, "Le texte grec des récits utiles à l'âme d'Anastase (le Sinaïte)," OC 3 (1903): 56-90, esp. 64-65, with no. 44; it will appear as text no. 2 in the edition that André Binggeli is preparing for Sources chrétiennes. John Damascene, Against Iconoclasts 3.91 (ed. Kotter, Schrifien , vol. 3), reproduces the passage from the Sinaites with slight changes. 199 Both the miracle of the shot icon and the Eucharistie vision appear separately in Greek and Latin sources of the ninth century concerning St. George, as is discussed by Peeters, "L'autobiographie de S. Antoine" (n. 186 above), 415-16; and Braida and Pelissetti, Storia di Rawh al-Qurasī (n. 186 above), 49-63. This makes the two stories even more of a literary cliché and, accordingly, easy to borrow from text to text. 200 See M.-F. Auzépy, "Constantin, Théodore et le dragon," in Toleration and Repression in the Middle Ages , ed. K. Nikolau (Athens, 2002), 87-96 (repr. in Auzépy, L'histoire , 317-28). The icon of St. Theodore riding and killing the dragon is even men- tioned in an iconoclast Life of the eighth century, as was proven by C. Zuckerman, "The Reign of Constantine V in the Miracles of St. Theodore the Recruit (BHG 1764)," REB 46 (1988): 191-205. DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="35">Melkites and Icon Worship during the Iconoclastic Period | 169 This possibility would have been heightened if the image of Theodore killing the dragon were painted on the curtains closing off the altar from the nave.201 In any case, as the story of the Arab shooting at the icon was undoubtedly concocted, some time was needed after the martyrs death for it to be accepted as genuine. This lag-time would, in turn, make its mention by Rawhs contemporary Abú Qurra highly unlikely and confirms that the reference to the icon of Theodore is an iconodule interpolation to Qurra s treatise On the Veneration of the Holy Icons ,202 The only possible alter- native explanation would be to consider the treatise a later compilation based freely on Abū Qurras works. In either case, the reference to the Passio of Rawh provides no help in dating the treatise on the icons. We can however establish a very early terminus ante quem for it. The treatise has been transmitted in just two manuscripts, independently of the other main works of Abū Qurras Arabic corpus: the British 201 Although the text does not say exactly where the icon was placed, I would conjecture that the depiction of Theodore was painted on the curtains that were pulled together by the priest, so that it was visible only when the altar was closed. Paintings of icons on the altar curtains are already attested by Epiphanius of Salamis (310/20-403), who, after entering a church in a village called Anautha (Avau0á) in Palestine, "came across a dyed curtain hang- ing on its door [i.e., the "Royal Doors" in the iconostasis or tem- plon screen], which bore some anthropomorphic, idolatrous image, which they [i.e., the local Christians] said on the spot was the rep- resentation either of Christ or of one of the saints, for I do not remember well what I saw" (eöp o'lbv ßrjlov èv rf' Gúpa ßa7rr6v, èv # è£coypá&lt;1&gt;y]TO àvSpoeÍKE^óv ti eiSco'XoeiSéç- ô íXgyov rá^a öti Xpicrroú fjv tò èKTÚ7rco[*a r) évòç twv àyíwv- où yàp [¿éprj [¿ai èyù Geacrá^evoç). Epiphanius, offended at this image, tore it asunder. The text is pre- served in Patriarch Nikephoros 's Refutatio eteversio definitionis syno- vialis anni Sis, ed. J. M. Featherstone, Corpus Christianorum, Series Graeca 33 (Turnhout, 1997), chap. 203; also in a Latin translation of Saint Jerome, which is transmitted as his Letter 51. 1 thank Michael Featherstone for this reference. The text of Epiphanius clearly sug- gests that the anthropomorphic image on the curtains was mainly decorative and that the local Christians tried to pass it off as an icon of Christ or of a saint in order to protect it (vainly, as it happened) from the zealous foreign visitor. As well, the image of the saint- warrior riding on the dragon in our text also has a decorative char- acter and was not an object of worship, for it was visible to the Arab only when the altar was closed and the church became empty. 202 Cf. Binggeli, "Converting the Caliph," 82-83, who argues that the Passion "was composed ... in the first half of the ninth century," precisely because of the mention by Abū Qurra. However, the exis- tence of so many versions of the Passio of Rawh proves the popular- ity of the text among the Melkites and makes a reference to it easy to interpolate into Qurras treatise. Library Oriental MS 4950, written by a monk of the monastery of Mar Chariton in Palestine, who finished his work on 1 December 887, and the Sinai Arabic MS 330, perhaps dating to the tenth century. The rest of the works of Abū Qurra, with the exception of a very short treatise and the Greek pieces, are transmitted in manuscripts dating from the twelfth to the eight- eenth century.203 This means that the treatise had a very early success among the Melkites, who attributed it to Theodore. Furthermore, Eutychios, patriarch of Alexandria in the tenth century, already referred in his Annals to Abū Qurra as the author of a treatise on images: "Abū Qurrah was also among those who supported bowing down to images. He wrote a book on this, and he named it Sermons on Bowing Down to Images ."204 This brief remark follows a long excursus about a treatise by patriarch Sophronios of Alexandria on icon worship, composed during the reign of the emperor Theophilos.205 This reference, in turn, pro- vides a further clue to the diffusion of a treatise attrib- uted to Abū Qurra, perhaps linking it with the treatise of Sophronios. We can conclude, first, that On the Veneration of the Holy Icons, as it now stands, was already known in the last quarter of the ninth century and, second, that were it not for that text we would have no other indica- tion that Theodore was a partisan of icon worship. The possibility that the treatise was, in fact, not Theodores and attributed to him only after his death appears here merely as a petitio principu , for a linguistic study of the text and its parallels would be needed to fully support that argument. John Lamoreaux, when reviewing this article, considered this possibility to be unlikely. Since this question has never been discussed in a scholarly publication, I quote his words, as the judgment of a rec- , ognized authority on the author: 203 See J. Lamoreaux, "Theodore Abū Qurra," in Thomas and Roggema, Christian-Muslim Relations (n. 92 above), 439-91, for an overview of the manuscripts. 204 The translation is from S. H.

And there is a great deal of overlap in the language of this treatise and his other Arabic works. At the same time, there are many shared themes. While Theodore does not discuss icons elsewhere, some of the foun- dational aspects to his argument in this trea- tise are well paralleled in those other works: the treatment of Judaism, the criteria by which one distinguishes true from false religions, and most especially, his peculiar notions touching the throne of God, namely, that God is required to be localized, to be in a place, if he is to reveal himself to limited human beings. However, my colleague Juan Pedro Monferrer Sala, whom I also consulted on this question, counters that there is a strong probability that the work was attrib- uted to Abù Qurra, but not composed by him. As well, he thinks that the present version of the text may have expanded upon a reduced original treatise, a procedure for which parallels are easily found. The prestige of the author would have sufficed to justify the attribution of the text to him, although it might have been written by his school or epigones. Finally, Monferrer Sala contends that using parallels with other works by Theodore risks circular argument, as this is not the only suspect work ofTheodore. As the matter now stands, and in the absence of detailed research, we will continue to consider the text as Theodores, although probably edited posthumously and with interpolations. We will consider only the general intent of the treatise for the moment in order to avoid giving much weight to single sentences that might not be original. Let us now have a more detailed look on the content of the treatise. Abù Qurra opens the treatise with the following words: Abba Yannah, our brother, you who are with us in Edessa, have informed us that many Christians are abandoning the prostration to the icon of Christ our God. In his compas- sion, for the sake of our salvation, he made it possible for there to be an icon of him, due to his incarnation from the Holy Spirit and from the Virgin Mary. The same too with the icons of his saints. In the Holy Spirit they were embold- ened to enter into the arena to participate with him in his sufferings. By perseverance they enhanced the embellishment of his cross and became leaders of honour for the believers, the memory of whom stirs them to imitate them, and to crowns of victory like theirs. Anti-Christians, especially ones claiming to have in hand a scripture sent down from God [i.e. the Qur'an], are reprimanding them for their prostration to these icons, and because of it they are imputing to them the worship of idols, and the transgression of what God commanded in the Torah and the Prophets, and they sneer at them.206 It is obviously on behalf of the famous mandylion of Christ that Abù Qurra, bishop of the suffragan see of Harrān, wrote this apology for the icons. The mandylion was held to be a true icon, an àj(sip07r0Íy]T0V not made by human hands but by Christ himself, who left an imprint of his face on a cloth for the king Abgar of Edessa.207 The mandylion was preserved and worshipped as a relic in the Church of the Icon of Christ in Edessa, enjoyed a special status, and was recognized even by Christians who were not particularly prone to admit icon worship. The exceptional character of the Edessa icon is attested in the Book of the Proof (Kitab al-Burhãn ), a Melkite treatise written in Arabic and traditionally attributed to Eutychios of Alexandria.208 It is now generally attributed to a certain Petros (Butrus) son of Nastās, bishop of Bayt Ras in Jordania, who is thought to have written it before the end of the ninth century, the date of the oldest manuscript.209 In the first of the four books of this work, Petros, after having dealt with 206 Translation by Griffith, Treatise on the Veneration , 28-19. 207 For the mandylion , see Dobschiitz, Christusbilder (n. 2 above); and, more recently, M.

At the very end of the list, the icon of Christ in Edessa is mentioned (§384); in fact, this is the only reference to an icon in the entire work. But Petros refers to this icon in a strikingly peculiar way: The most wonderful of His relics [j^] [athār] which Christ has bequeathed to us is a nap- kin [mandil] in the church of ar-Ruhā [Edessa] in the region the Jazīra [in Syria]. With this Christ wiped His face and there was fixed on it a clear countenance [^4^] [hilya] , distinct from an image/icon [sūra] and it is not a drawing [?h] [raqm] or an engraving [l£*^] [naqsh] and does not change.210 The author clearly considers the image of Christ in Edessa not to be an icon, but a relic. Moreover, he under- lines that the usual Arabic word for icon (sūra) does not apply to this image of Christ. This emphasis is under- standable in an apologetic context, with the author act- ing out of fear of being branded as icon worshipper or, even worse, an idolater.211 It is thus the divine origin of this "image" that causes it to be included among the other relics of Christ. No humanly made icons are men- tioned in the work, for they provide no "proof" of the existence of the divinity. The defense of the "relic" of Edessa does not apply to them.212 in Thomas and Roggema, Christian-Muslim Relations , 902-6, with recent bibliography. 210 Watt translates the passage as follows: "The most wonderful of His relics which Christ has bequeathed to us is a napkin in the church of ar-Ruhā in the region the Jezireh. With this Christ wiped His face and there was fixed on it a clear image, not made by painting or drawing or engraving and not changing." I thank Mark Swanson for his help in the analysis of this passage. 211 Av. Cameron, "The History of the Image of Edessa: The Telling of a Story," in Okeānos : Essays Presented to Ihor Ševčenko on his Sixtieth Birthday by his Colleagues and Students, ed. C. Mango, O. Pritsak, and U. M. Pasicznyk (Cambridge, Mass., 1984), 80-94, esp. 90-91 (repr. in Cameron, Changing Cultures [n. 4 above], no. XI), paid attention to this important passage before it became known that it was not Eutychios in the tenth century, but Petros in the ninth, who wrote it. 212 Griffith, "Bashīr/Bēsēr" (n. 17 above), publishes a polemical treatise supposedly written by an Arab prisoner in Byzantium at It is therefore revealing that Abù Qurra several times equates icons to relics213 and considers as icons certain objects that are certainly not images but relics, like "the most famous icon, the tablets of the Law."214 As we have seen above, this might be seen as a further compromise with the enemies of icons, for the relics had a special authority that humanly made icons did not posses.215 Considering this, John Lamoreaux suggests to me that perhaps the text would seem less strange if the Arabic term sūra (^jj-^) were translated not as "icon," but as "image." This semantic shift would put some distance between the local polemic on images in Edessa and Byzantine iconoclasm. In fact, it might be that the images initially considered by Theodore were not "icons" as those were understood in Byzantium, but were, perhaps, ex-voto images or even images represent- ing martyrs at their shrines. The distinction is impor- tant and has been extensively discussed by Brubaker the time of Leo III. In the confrontation with the Byzantines, the Arab curiously insists on denouncing the Christian worship of "that made with human hands," as if he excluded from his criticism the à^gip07roír)Ta or relics. 213 See the reference to "graves, bones and icons of the saints" in Griffith, Treatise on the Veneration , 44; or to "the bones of the saints, and their icons," 73; or to the "holy bones" of the prophet Elisha, 89-90. 214 Griffith, Treatise on the Veneration , 69. 215 Even the Council of Hiereia in 754 did not attack the relics of the saints. Earlier interpretations, based on iconodule sources, sug- gested that the Isaurians destroyed relics of saints. S. Gero, Byzantine Iconoclasm During the Reign of Constantine V, With Particular Attention to the Oriental Sources* CSCO 384, Subsidia 52 (Louvain, i977)&gt; 152-65, reviewed the evidence and concluded that it was only Constantine V who, later on during his reign, could have destroyed some relics. However, J. Wortley, "Iconoclasm and Leipsanoclasm: Leo III, Constantine V and the Relics," ByzF 8 (1982): 253-79, though admitting that Constantine V could not have been especially favor- able to the cult of relics, insists that no deliberate destruction of them took place during his reign. L. James, "Dry Bones and Painted Pictures: Relics and Icons in Byzantium," in Eastern Christian Relics , ed. A. Lidov (Moscow, 2003), 45-55, considers the differences and sim- ilarities between relics and images. P.

Flusin, Centre de recherche d'histoire et civilisation de Byzance. Monographies 17 (Paris, 2004), 15-30, argues that Constantine V may have founded the Church of Pharos for housing the relics of the Passion of Christ. Finally, it is significant that according to Theophanes Continuatus 2.14 the emperor Theophilos paraded through the walls of Constantinople the relics of the Virgin s robe, but not her icon, as had been the case on prior occasions: see James, "Dry Bones," 52. DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="38">ijl I JUAN SIGNES CODOÑER and Haldon, in their analysis of late antique images of saints before the iconoclast crisis.216 On the other hand, if even the "image" of Christ in Edessa, as Abū Qurra states, was no longer honored as formerly, we can surmise that icon worship really was questioned at the time. Moreover, the polemical tone of the treatise strongly suggests an open confrontation between defenders and partisans of images. Abū Qurra took up his pen in Edessa in defense of images because there were many Christians abandoning prostration before the icons due to the pressure of the enemies of the Christian faith. In the opening of the treatise, he identifes those enemies as Muslims, for they claim "to have in hand a scripture sent down from God." Although the Jews are also targeted again and again in the text as the fictional adversaries of Abú Qurra's arguments, the Islamic authorities were the ones who had the power to enforce legal measures against icon worship and they are deemed responsible for the con- temporary change about the cult of images. Thus, the issue of the icons has nothing to do with iconoclasm in the Empire but is, rather, triggered by internal debate among the Eastern Christians, exactly as we also sur- mised in the cases of Palestinian "iconophobia" in §2, and of John of Damascus in §3. Abū Qurra is silent in his work about the real numbers of Christians who abandoned icon worship out of fear or simply to accommodate their "iconopho- bic" Muslim overlords. But in a passage near the end of the treatise, he appears to admit the existence of some kind of "iconophobic" Christians: If someone [a Christian] says: "The outsid- ers [Muslims] might reproach us for the cross of Christ without seeing these icons!" [i.e., the icons of the cross with a representation of Christ crucified], let him know this: As for those [i.e., outsiders] who enter our churches, if these icons [with Christ crucified on the cross] weren't present in our churches, for most of them, what we have mentioned would not occur to them! As for the icons, they are what arouse them to reproach us.217 Earlier in the chapter Abū Qurra argued that it was necessary to have icons of the crucifixion in churches, for these bear witness to the divinity of the crucified Christ. If the Muslims are offended at their sight, this is not a bad thing, for it gives Christians an opportu- nity for fearless confession. He even stresses that God "will reward us for it, in proportion to his magnanimity, with a reward not lower than the reward of the mar- tyrs." Now, in this passage, Abū Qurra seems to antici- pate an objection from a Christian, who claims that the (aniconic) cross is enough to bring about a reaction from the outsiders against the Christians. Abū Qurra rejects this: if Muslims came into the churches and only saw Christians venerating the plain symbol of the cross, it would not occur to most of them to reproach the Christians; rather, it is the veneration of icons of the crucifixion, not of plain crosses, that provokes reproach. This argument confirms the existence of churches with icons of the crucified Christ. But by stressing their importance, Theodore seems to imply that this kind of image was, indeed, questioned, for his adversary defends the position that crosses without the image of Christ could render the same function as those with the image. Theodore s argument is thus implicit evidence that there were at the time some Christians who considered the aniconic cross to be the primary, and perhaps the only, permissible image or symbol to be allowed in the churches. No indication is given of their importance or real numbers, but they were clearly not marginal, for otherwise Abū Qurra would not have written his treatise On the Veneration of the Holy Icons. In this regard, the use of Arabic by Abū Qurra was not a casual choice, but an additional means of showing his adversaries that they all belonged to the same cultural milieu. One might even argue that when Abū Qurra rejected "imperial Greek" and adopted Arabic as the language of religious debate, he addressed ruling Islam, not the Byzantine iconoclasts. The use of a given language always implies certain terminological parameters common to all its speakers; and so, Abū Qurra could not but refer to the Quran in his treatise to cement his arguments.218 216 Brubaker and Haldon, Iconoclast Era, esp. 50-66. 217 Mark Swanson revised for me the translation of the passage so that it might closely follow the Arabic syntax. See Griffith, Treatise on the Veneration y 95, for an alternative rendering. The following interpretation of the passage is also indebted to Professor Swanson, per litteras, October 12, 2009. 218 See Griffith, Theodore Abu Qurrah (n. 154 above); idem, "Theodore Abū Qurrah 's On the Veneration of the Holy Icons," Sacred Art Journal 13 (1992): 3-19; idem, "Qur'ân in Arab Christian DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="39">Melkites and Icon Worship during the Iconoclastic Period | 173 Theodores purposeful avoidance of the Council of Nicaea of 787 in his treatise again suggests a local context for it. The council endorsed icon worship and was recognized as the seventh ecumenical council by the Byzantine Church, but Abû Qurra always quotes the six ecumenical councils as the main source of doc- trine for the Church,219 which might be interpreted as a narrowing of the horizons, of ignorance in the Melkite milieux of what was going on in Constantinople. However, it is inconceivable that the Melkites had no knowledge of the council, for they were in regular contact with the Empire. A lack of access to the pro- ceedings of the council cannot explain their silence, especially since icon worship was discussed. One must conclude that the Melkites did not have a special interest in Nicaea II, perhaps because it was not considered ecumenical at all,220 but also because in Nicaea the defense of the icons was made in a straight- forward manner, with massive appeal to legends and the tradition. Such a defense was, perhaps, less expedi- ent for the Melkites in Abù Qurras time, in the midst of an Islamic "iconophobic" milieu, which privileged subtlety and artifice over direct confrontation. Further, icon worshipers in the East likely did not follow their counterparts in the Empire in their overall ritualization of images and, perhaps, simply linked their practice to the traditional cult of particular shrines and their spe- cific images. If we now take stock, we may conclude that Abù Qurras treatise On the Veneration of the Holy Icons was written for the Melkite community in Edessa and attempted to defend images in general (and the worship of the famous mandylion of Christ, in particular) from the hostility of local Christians and Muslims. Any reference to Byzantium was unnecessary and might have been a source of further troubles for the icono- dule Melkites, who tried to prove their proximity to the ruling Abbasid elites by choosing to communicate Texts" (n. 175 above); and idem, "Monk in the Emirs Majlis" (n. 17$ above). 219 See Griffith, "Theodore Abû Qurrah's Arabic Tract" (n. 20 above), 57-58; and Lamoreaux, "Biography of Theodore" (n. 154 above), 34. Another option for explaining the silence on icons in the rest of Abû Qurras works is that he never divulged or published his compromising treatise On the Veneration of the Holy Icons , which might have circulated only after his death. 220 See Henry, "Initial Eastern Assessments" (n. 151 above); and Signes Codoñer, "Die Melkitischen Patriarchen" (n. 71 above). in Arabic. This reserve would have been especially nec- essary if Abù Qurra wrote this treatise after 799 and before the outbreak of the second iconoclasm in 81$, when icon worship became the official doctrine in Byzantium. These circumstances were exactly the oppo- site to the ones that moved the Damascene to write his three treatises on the icons against imperial iconoclasm. But the religious climate was also different. If our analysis holds true, during the eighth cen- tury the iconodules were slowly receding in Syria and Palestine before the combined pressure of Islam and their accommodating Christian fellows. This may explain the migration of radical iconodule monks (the Sabaïtes) to Constantinople and Rome, where they were virulently active in propagating icon worship, as we saw in §3 above. But for the remaining iconodule Melkites prudence or even silence was more advisable. The treatise of Abú Qurra On the Veneration of the Holy Icons , if it is by him, might be an exception to this rule. 8. Other Melkite Treatises in Arabic Sidney Griffith has recently argued that "there are numerous accounts in Greek, Syriac and Arabic, in the histories, chronicles, hagiographies, martyrologies and even in the apologetic treatises produced by Christians living in the caliphate from the eighth to the tenth cen- turies and beyond, telling of crosses and icons, of their abuse and their veneration, and of their miraculous powers/'221 He also lists some testimonies in support of his argument.222 However, if we narrow the focus to the period ca. 750-850 in the Middle East (leaving aside the particular case of Egypt, for which see §10 below) and consider only the references to Christian icons, not to crosses, Griffith s statement should per- , haps be emended. In fact, with the exception of Abù Qurras works, practically none of the Arabic Melkite texts of the sec- ond half of the eighth and most of the ninth centuries refer to icons or holy images, although these works take up sensitive and controversial points in polemi- cal exchange with Islam.223 Moreover, in most of these 221 Griffith, "Iconophilia and Iconophobia" (n. 9 above), 370. 222 See, in general, Griffith, "Images," (n. 16 above); and idem, "Iconophilia and Iconophobia." 223 See Bertaina, Christian and Muslim Dialogues (n. 175 above) for a panoramic discussion of the polemical Melkite literature, with DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="40">174 I JUAN SIGNES CODOÑER texts the worship of the cross - both the True Cross and the symbol of the cross - is dealt with at some length. It seems as if the cross was the central point in the debate between Islam and Christianity and icon worship was not part of the discussion because it was not admitted by the Christian theologians. Mark Swanson already drew attention to this phenomenon some years ago and remarked on the iconoclast flavor of some of these treatises, but his study has not received the attention it deserves.224 Let us briefly review the evidence provided by these Melkite texts in order to gain a clearer picture. The ancient Melkite apology found in Sinaiticus arabicus 154, generally known as the Treatise on the Triune Nature of God, was dated by Samir Khalil Samir to 750 and, accordingly, has been considered the earliest Arabic Christian apology.225 However, Swanson later established a date of 788.226 The text does not contain a single reference to icons or to the cult of the cross, although there are many references to idol worship. More interesting is the so-called Summa Theo - logiae Arabica (al-Jãmi' wujüh al-īmān ), an anony- mous Melkite treatise in Arabic, originally attributed by Samir to Abū Qurra,227 but now determined by GrifEth to be a compendium of Christian theology written at the monastery of Mar Chariton between an accurate rendering of the content of the works. 224 M.

The cross thus assumes a position as mediator between God and men in a way that is very similar to the icons in iconodule theology. The passage, in Swansons translation, is as follows: It is necessary for the believer, when he stands before the cross, to behold it and occupy him- self with it (which is the most effective way to concentrate his understanding) and to aspire in his thought toward Christ our Lord as though he were crucified before him, as long as he is in prayer. [That is] because it was through the cross that there came our guidance and our rectitude and the existence of that for which we hope in the hereafter. [It was] in the cross that the friends of God boasted, and in it was their triumph. Next in time comes the Dialogue of Abraham of Tiberias (Ibrahim al-Tabarānī) with Abd al-Rahmān 228 S. H.

Another Melkite text of the period, also still unedited,235 is preserved in Sinaiticus arabicus 434. It contains a religious debate between a Muslim emir and a Christian. Griffith published a study of it with an accurate summary of its content and titled it, con- ventionally, Answers for the Shay kh. 236 Haddad has suggested 780 as the year of its composition,237 while Griffith dates it to the late ninth century, if not to the tenth. Whatever the precise date, the text holds not a single reference to icons. Nor is there any discussion of icons or images in the correspondence of the eminent Melkite transla- tor and physician Qustã Ibn Lūqā (835-912) with the Muslim Ibn al-Munajjim and the Nestorian Hunayn Ibn Ishaq.238 232 For the edition and a study of the work, see G.

The dating ca. 820 given by the editor is approximate, as the author mistakenly says that Ma'mûn reigned from 813 to 822 (104).

Only in §234 is there a mention of the statues and images of the ancients that the modern artists are not any more able to reproduce. Finally, the evidence from historical or hagi- ographie sources is scanty and not as conclusive as first appears. The Life of Anthony/ Rawh contains a reference to an icon of St. Theodore, which is suspi- cious for its conventional nature, as we argued above in §7. In the Life of Timothy of Kãkhushtã, the saint prays only once to an icon - of the Virgin, to which he turns following his prayers to God. Curiously enough, God grants what Timothy demands of him, so that the prayer of Timothy to the Virgins icon merely causes her to appear and intercede for him before God. Moreover, when Timothy tells the people of the success of his prayer he does not mention the appearance of the Virgin.239 Although the saint lived in the beginning of the ninth century, his Life is to be used with caution, for it appears to have suffered much reworking at a later stage, when the remains of the saint were translated to Antioch in the middle decades of the eleventh century.240 It is even more significant that the numerous Muslim writers who entered into polemics with con- temporary Christians apparently never refer to icon worship among them.241 This observation is not a proof for the predominance of iconoclast approaches, for Christian practices were not always the target of the discussion and the debate focused on theological questions.242 Moreover, many of the Muslim treatises 239 J. C. Lamoreaux and C. Cairala, eds., Life of Timothy of Kãkhushtã (Turnhout, 2000), §35 (P) and §42 (S). 240 See J. C.

Abd Allāh ibn Ismā'īl al-Hāshiml, perhaps a relative of the caliph Ma'mûn and writing under his reign, claims to have had discussions with Melkites, Jacobites, and Nestorians; he criticizes Christians only for the worship of the cross, but does not mention icons; see L.

Icon wor- ship proves to be a minor issue in the polemics between Muslims and Christians in the ninth century. Even in the letter of the caliph Hārūn al-Rashld to the emperor Constantine VI and written by the Arab scholar Ibn al-Layth (d. ca. 819), reputedly sent ca. 796 (a few years after Nicaea II), no mention is made of icons.244 However, it would be unwise to conclude that Melkite Christians in the ninth century were indiffer- ent to icon worship, for many texts of the period remain unedited or lack a comprehensive study. Anyway, the general silence on icons that we have observed in the Melkite theologians of the time does allow us to con- clude that, at least for a significant portion of the ninth century, the Church hierarchy of the Melkites did not try to incorporate the cult of icons, which was surely present at a private or popular level, into dogma, as the Byzantine Church did in 787. There was apparently no need for such a move, which would likely have provoked contemporary "iconophobic" Muslims (see §§2-3), with whom Melkites frequently debated religious matters. 9. Two Greek Melkite Lives It is telling that one of the few iconodule texts writ- ten in Greek in the East during this period, the Life of Stephen the Sabaite , has only one passing mention of icons. Leontios of Neapolis wrote this Life in Palestine 243 For Muslim polemicists against Christianity, mainly in the eighth and ninth centuries, see Thomas and Roggema, Christian- Muslim Relations, 347-53, 371-74, 532.-49, 582-84, 611-13, 618-21, 649-51, 656-60, 669-74, 695-701, 706-16, 723-25, 746-50, 762- 67. Most of these entries have been written by the editor of the vol- ume, David Thomas, who in an email of 23 March 2010 confirmed that "we cannot know directly whether Muslims attacked the idea of icons in the ninth century, because very few of their works have sur- vived. The few that have tend to focus on Christian doctrines that related to the Muslim doctrine of tawhid, and do not say much about Christian practices." For a short overview of the Muslim polemi- cists, see D. Thomas, Anti-Christian Polemic in Early Islam: Abü Isã al-Warrãq's 'Against the Trinity' (Cambridge, 1992), 31-50. 244 H .

Leontios explains how "the wicked devil of blasphemy" (0 ryj; ßlac7(1&gt;Y)|xia&lt;; óléGpioç Saí[¿cov) began to assail him with temptations scarcely a week after he had arrived at the monastery of St. Sabas.246 After some struggle, Stephen freed Leontios from temptation and confirmed him in his faith. As a result, Leontios, although he did not at first "desire to look on the holy icons, except when forced to do if (oiire xàç Geíaç KaGopãv ebcóvaç 7rpoe0u[¿oú[¿r]v à TOC &gt;ļ ßeßiaa1xevo&lt;;), repented and "yearned strongly to attend at all times the life-giving Eucharist and to kiss the blessed icons with a pure heart" (xàç àyíaç èv süuKpivsía 7rgpi7rn3&lt;7(7g&lt;T0ai encova;).247 Nothing in the text indicates that the temptations undergone by Leontios had anything to do with iconoclasm, but it is striking that upon his arrival at Mar Sabas he was apparently forced to behold them. The newcomer seems to have been reluctant to observe icon worship, as was customary in the Palestinian mon- astery. His healing (or, perhaps, better, his conversion to icon worship?) took almost two years.248 It would, however, be misleading to put too much stress on this anecdote, for it is the only mention of an icon in the text. As Auzépy has already noted, the "pur- ist" position represented at St. Saba by Stephen and his wide circle of disciples and supporters, as described by Leontios, placed great emphasis on the power of the eucharist for effecting healings and producing dio- ratic visions by means of the cross, oil, or even physical contact, but never by icons. As Auzépy observed, this practice was closer to the theology of Constantine V than to that of patriarch Tarasios, the mastermind of Nicaea II. Stephen remained, it is important to note, 245 For this Life, see Auzépy, "Palestine à Constantinople" (n. 64 above), 184-93; and J. C.

On the other hand, we are informed about the fragile and delicate position of the patriarchs themselves before the Muslim authorities: Elias II is denounced, deposed, and sent into exile in Baghdad, while the usurper Theodore takes his place, profiting from his good relations with the Palestinian emir.250 Under these circumstances, it seems unlikely that the Melkite patriarchates ever risked provoking the Muslim authorities by openly embracing or defend- ing icon worship. Icons were, perhaps, only worshipped in the intimacy of monasteries, but without having a prominent role in the liturgy, as we have already suggested. In any case, as Ognibene has remarked, monasteries like Mar Sabas were less affected by the "iconophobia" of the eighth century.251 When we compare the Life of Stephen the Sabaite with the contemporary Life of Stephen the Younger the differences are striking.252 The latter was written in Constantinople by Stephen, deacon of Hagia Sophia, ca. 807-809, to honor the homonymous saint, who had died during the reign of Constantine V about forty years earlier. Both the setting of the saints life in the Byzantine Empire and his heroic status as the leader of the iconodule monks against the iconoclasts prompts the expectation of regular reference to icons, for the author wrote during the iconodule period after the Council of Nicaea in 787 and before the reestablish- ment of iconoclasm by Leo V in 81$.

His supposition was based on a reappraisal of his biogra- phy; see idem, "Kosmas of Jerusalem: A More Critical Approach to his Biography," BZ 82 (1989): 122-32 (repr. in Authors, no.

Of particular interest is the saint s recollection of the frequent anathemas against iconoclasm issued by the eastern patriarchs. He speaks before an audi- ence of iconophile monks worried about the call of Constantine V for an iconoclast council: Is there any need of speaking about the patri- archs of Rome and Antioch, of Jerusalem and Alexandria? They not only detested and anath- ematized the hateful dogma of the icon-burn- ers but also through their defamatory letters did not cease to abuse the impious emperor who consented to it, naming him apostate and heresiarch.253 As we saw above in §3, the anathema pronounced by the three Melkite patriarchs against Hiereia, as reported by the Life of Stephen the Younger , contrasts with the silence of Theophanes in his chronicle, where no reac- tion of the eastern patriarchates against Byzantine icon- oclasm is mentioned. Our text, written some time after Nicaea II and serving official iconodule propaganda, seems to have amplified the support of the eastern patri- archates for the council of 787, as recorded in the Acts, by making them oppose Constantine V. Moreover, the reference to S7rioTolai&lt;; orijXiTetmKaic ; - "defamatory letters" - reminds us of thelóyoç orrjliTgtmKÓç, a work usually known a sAdversus iconoclastas, which was writ- ten in Rome ca. 770 by a Greek iconodule. This cer- tainly defamatory text against iconoclasts served as a short presentation of the iconophile dossier of sources preserved in Parisinus Graecus 1115.254 That this dos- sier of texts was made by the Sabaïtes, who were well connected with Palestine,255 can explain why it was reputed to have originated in the east. 253 Stephen the Deacon, Life of Stephen the Younger §28: Tí §è £prj "Xéyeiv 7repi twv irpoéàpcov roö re 'Pc*j(¿rj&lt;; Kai AvTio^eía ç, 'Iepo&lt;7oXú[¿cov Kal Ale^avSpeía«;; Oïrive; où 'jl6vov a7rgß$eXui;avTo Kai áve0£[¿áTi&lt;7av tò po-apòv rcáv gbcovoKauorwv §óyf¿a, àXXà Kai 67rioTolaíç (jrrj'XiTÊUTiKaT*; oùk è7raúo-avTo Ka0ußpi£eiv tòv 7rpòç touto è7nvgú&lt;7avTa ctceßf) ßaan^ia, à7rooráTyjv Kai alpÉcnáp^v aÚTÒv à7roKaloúvTgç (ed.

Icon Worship among Copts, Jacobites, and Nestorians Following our review of all the evidence of icon worship among the Melkites, we can turn our attention to some further testimonies scattered in literary sources writ- ten by members of other Eastern Christian churches, as they may complement or correct the conclusions obtained so far. &amp;€► In Egypt, Coptic Christian icons of late antiquity clearly continue the ancient pagan and Roman iconographie traditions.256 Monasteries, in particular, seem to have developed this tradition, as demonstrated by the secco paintings in the "jeweled style" of the north and south apse of the dome of the Red monastery of Shenoute in Sohag, with representations of the Christ child suckling from Mary s breast facing the adult enthroned Christ (dating to the seventh century)257 or in the recently uncovered Nativity paintings of a room in a building complex on the north of the monastery of Bawit (dat- ing perhaps as late as the eighth century),258 both in the Upper Nile. But at the same time, in Kellia, in the nortwestern Nile delta, closer to urban centers, we find a strong preference for painting of crosses and very rare figurai representations, a circumstance that may suggest "differences in monastic practice or doctrine."259 256 As has been proven by M. Rassart-Debergh, "De l'icône païenne à l'icône chrétienne," Le Monde Copte 18 (1990): 39-70, and more recently by the excellent monograph of L. Török, Transfigurations of Hellenism: Aspects of Late Antique Art in Egypt AD 250-700 (Leiden, 2005), esp. 288-301 and 334-50, where the author concludes that pagan icons (and imperial portraits), but not mummy portraits, are the main source for the genre of Christian icons. 257 Good pictures in E.

See also eadem, "The White Monastery Federation and the Angelic Life," in Byzantium and Islam (n. 2 above), 75-80. Interestingly, the holy images are depicted in the upper levels of the church, whereas the niches below remain aniconic. 258 D. Bénazeth, "The Coptic Monastery of Bawit," in Byzantium and Islam, 81-86. Paintings of the sixth to eighth centuries have also been preserved in the Monastery of St. Antony at the Red Sea; see E. S.

Bolman, "Depicting the Kingdom of Heaven: Paintings and Monastic Practice in Early Byzantine Egypt," in Egypt in the Also significant are two cycles of images from the beginning of the eighth century that offer evidence of the decorative function of images in the religious art of the time. The first is a carved wooden lintel from the Coptic church of al-Muallaqa in Old Cairo, pres- ently in the Coptic Museum. It contains two picto- rial scenes of high quality from the life of Christ (the Entry into Jerusalem and the Ascension), accompanied by a lengthy Greek inscription that atributes the work to the Coptic patriarch Theodore and that dates it to the Diocletianic year 451, corresponding to 735. 260 The second is a fresco with a sequence of episodes from the life of St. Menas, which is poorly preserved in a small church in Jeme (western Thebes), a provincial country town. In this case, the portraits of the donors, Elisabeth and her daughter, have been preserved at the end of the cycle. As this Elisabeth is documented in contempo- rary legal texts of the town, we can date the frescoes to a period between 719 and 738.261 Both the lintel and the frescoes bear witness to the use of images for deco- ration and instructional purposes, but not as objects of worship. Until now, no iconic representations in the altar area have been preserved, although a double-sided icon with Saint Theodore and the Archangel Gabriel from Bawît may have originally been placed in the screen separating the nave from the khurus , a position that recalls the image of Theodore and the dragon that we commented upon in the Passio of Antony Rawh.262 Byzantine World, 300-700 , ed.

DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="45">Melkites and Icon Worship during the Iconoclastic Period | 179 Coptic icons become rare after the seventh cen- tury for many centuries, a circumstance that could be related to the new Muslim rulership or, alternatively, to new iconoclastic tendencies appearing in contempo- rary Christianity.263 As far as the textual sources are concerned, references to icons in Egypt also become extremely rare after the seventh century except for the Coptic homiletic texts of the eighth and ninth centu- ries, where icon worship is occasionally mentioned but placed in a late antique setting that makes their inter- pretation controversial.264 Precisely dated are, on the contrary, two stories that appear in the History of the Patriarchs of the Coptic writer Ibn Mufarrij. In the first, it is reported that the mighty son of the governor of Egypt died ca. 70$ after he had spat upon the image of the Virgin and the Child, which was carried in pro- cession, according to the rule.265 Some time later, dur- ing the reign of Marwan II (744-50), we are told that a Muslim saw painted "on the wall" of the Church of the Virgin in Alexandria a picture of Christ on the cross, but when he went up "to the upper gallery" and pierced it with a rod, he was crucified on the spot after the like- ness of the picture and could descend only after con- fessing the Christian faith.266 Both stories are situated in a context of hostility of Muslims toward Christian imagery. Significantly, whereas the first story men- tions outdoor and customary processions of icons, the second, dated some decades later, tells how a Muslim discovers an icon of Christ painted high on the wall of a church and mounts to the gallery to destroy it; it is as if the visibility of icons for the Muslim lords had decreased over the course of a few decades.267 A case apart is presented by a small group of icons dating to the iconoclastic period, which are preserved in the orthodox (Melkite) monastery of St. Catherine at Sinai. Although Kurt Weitzmann attrib- uted them to a Palestinian milieu, this is far from cer- tain.268 Weitzmanns chronology was based on the internal evolution of artistic trends and a compari- son with icons of other areas, but he could not prove that the icons came to Sinai at an early stage nor that they were, in fact, manufactured in Palestine. Indeed, some might have been painted by Palestinian iconod- ule émigrés in Byzantium or Italy, like the Sabaïtes, and might have come to Sinai from these areas (like the Constantinopolitan icon, Weitzmanns fig. 50).269 Weitzmann even notes a striking resemblance between an icon of the crucifixion at Sinai270 and a fresco of Santa Maria Antiqua in Rome dating to the period of the Greek Pope Zacharias (741-752). He explains the parallel by Palestinian influence on the Roman painter, rather than by the possibly Palestinian origin of the painter himself. A recent study of these icons by Brubaker and Haldon271 questions the existence of Weitzmanns "Sinai house style," as well as its almost exclusively Palestinian connections. In their analysis of the pre- served exemplars, they tend, rather, to reinforce the parallels with Roman, Egyptian (Coptic!), and, even occasionally, Byzantine models. Most importantly, Sinai icons, Brubaker and Haldon argue, are not 263 L.

She refers only to the destruction of old icons for making the holy myron and mentions iconoclastic episodes in modern times during the reign of patriarch Cyril IV (1854-61). 264 See for instance L.

It is doubtful that these icons were, in most cases, more than ex voto images. Their use for the cult was not assured at the time of their arrival; finally, their preservation in such a peripheral area speaks for their marginalization from urban churches. Finally, the Annals of Eutychios, Melkite patri- arch of Alexandria in the tenth century, provide us with a summary of a work on image worship by his pre- decessor Sophronios, who ascended to the see towards the end of Theophiloss reign. The passage is inserted in the reign of caliph Mutawakkil (847-861), although it refers to the appointment of Theophilos as emperor in 829.273 Sophronios is there said to have convinced Theophilos to restore icon worship, which makes the story clearly suspect, but recently two treatises on icon worship attributed to Sophronios have been discovered in the Harleianus 5665, fols. ir-47r. Before John Duffy completes the edition for the Corpus Christianorum nothing can be said for certain, but it appears sugges- tive to suppose that they were written after Theophilos s death, as a consequence of change in the attitude toward icons in the Melkite Church. It is also significant that the treatises are written in Greek, not in Arabic, although John Duffy has proved that local iconoclasts were the recipients of Sophronioss refutation.274 Among Syrian Monophysites or Jacobites, icons are not frequently mentioned in the literary sources for the eighth to ninth centuries, whereas more evidence can be collected for the sixth to seventh.275 Nevertheless, they do figure prominently in some texts that deserve our attention. In an unedited dialogue in Syriac written ca. 720, Abraham, a monk in the monastery of Bēt Hālē (per- haps near Kufa in Iraq), discusses Christian dogma with an Arab notable.276 In the dialogue, according to the recent overview made by Gerrit J. Reinink, it is when the Arab stresses that "we worship neither the cross, nor the bones of the martyrs, nor images as you do," that the Syrian monk feels obliged to start a lengthy defense of images, crosses, and the bones of martyrs (in that order). In his defense of the images, the monk refers first to three passages of the Old Testament that prove that Hebrews venerated inani- mate things, namely the "column of fire" of Exodus 13:21, the serpent of brass of Numbers 21:8-9, and the ark of the covenant. These three instances are compared to, respectively, the "enlightening" presence of Christ in the Last Judgement, the veneration of the cross, and the prostration of the priest before the altar. Thus far, no mention of icons has been made, and it is evident that "images" are primarily understood as representa- tions or created things, but not as icons. The Arab nota- ble then persists in asking, "what is the reason that you venerate the cross, although he (Christ) did not order it in his Gospel?" At this point, the monk begins his defense of the Cross: When we truly know that our Lord is the Son of God, and when He is considered by us as Lord, Saviour and Judge, [then] it is appropriate that 272 Ibid., 335. 273 Eutychios, Annals 409-11 (trans.

And we venerate and honour His image [§almeh], because He impressed [it] with His face and handed [it] over to us, and whenever we look at His icon [yuqneh], we see Him and we honour the image [§almā] of the King because of the King. The Arab refers to the famous image that Christ had made of himself and sent to Abgar, the King of Edessa. The discussion seems to center on this particular icon, not made by human hands and nearly a relic,277 as if this exceptional case were the only one worth mentioning. Nothing is said of other kinds of icons, painted by human hands. In fact, the preceding discus- sion, as we have seen, was about "images" in general; the word for "icon" is used only for the Edessa image, as if it represented a very particular image worshipped by the Christians.278 This particular image clearly had a special relevance, but one can doubt that its defense automatically validated the worship of other icons (as Reinink maintains), insofar as they were not sanctioned as relics by Christ himself. Indeed, the argument of the passage suggests that most icons would not be images to which honor should be paid, for they were neither given by Christ nor images of "kings." Moreover, the discussion that follows deals exten- sively with the cross, which is, in fact, the main point of it: the reference to images was made in order to justify the cult of the cross. Now, the author defends not only the symbolic value of the cross, but also its supernatu- ral, miracle-working force, a power he did not attrib- ute to images or icons. Finally, his defense of the cross as a sign for victory clearly recalls iconoclastic propa- ganda. A defense of the bones of the martyrs as relics 277 See above, §7. 278 Michael the Syrian 4:447-49 (Syriac text) and 3:475-77 (French trans.) (ed. Chabot) mentions disputes between Melkites and Syrians at Edessa about the image of the mandylion of Christ during the caliphate of Abd al-Mālik (685-705). Michael the Syrian, working from an oral account preserved by ancient rela- tives of Dionysios of Tell Mahrē, tells that the image was taken from the temple by a tax collector in order to exert pressure on the population to pay the taxes due. Only through the mediation of a rich Edessan, who kept the image secretly at his home and paid the money required, was the crisis overcome. This episode, taking place before the iconoclastic struggle in Constantinople, again points to the increasing pressure of Islam against images and may explain the defense of the Edessan icon in the present treatise. then follows, which confirms that we are still far from an autonomous worship of the icons as representations of divinity. Reinink argues that the emir Maslama, to whose entourage the Arab notable of the dialogue belongs, was the son of caliph Abd al-Malik, who was governor of both Iraqs in 720-721. These years overlap with the reign of caliph Yazid II who is, as we saw in §1, made responsible for an "iconoclastic" edict. Insofar as Maslama was entrusted, according to a Syrian source, with carrying the edict into effect, we discover further context for our text, as well as confirmation that there was no icon worship or cult of images in Syria at the time, at least as Byzantine iconodules understood it. A second Syrian text that deals with images must be adduced: the so-called Disputation of Sergios the Stylitě with a Jew ,279 The text, traditionally dated to the sixth century, was redated to the eighth by its editor A. R Hayman on the basis of repeated references to the 700 years that have elapsed since the the destruction of Jerusalem.280 This argument is problematic, as we know of a stylitě living in Gousit (near Emesa), as was Sergios, around 635. If our text was not actually written by the Stylitě himself, as it claims, the possibility arises that it might have been later expanded or reworked. Indeed, Hayman concludes that the work is, in its ini- tial parts, "a literary construction, based on collections of testimony texts and traditional anti-Jewish polem- ics" (67*). Nevertheless, Hayman does not think that this circumstance necessarily affects the dating. An important part of the text is devoted to the cult of the bones of the martyrs, which the Jew criti- cizes harshly: "but you build churches for them (i.e., the bones of the martyrs), and you paint pictures for them with pigments. And you dedicate them to mar- tyrs and call them a house of prayer" (i3§i). Sergios then replies to his accusation with a very lengthy defense (more than twelve pages) of the worship of the martyrs' bones, which are said to produce miracles. At the end of the exposition of Sergios, the Jew returns to the topic of the "pictures and images that are the icons" (i6§3, note the terminological accuracy), whose worship he equates 279 I thank John Lamoreaux for pointing me toward this very important text. 280 A.

Sergios, after some preambles, defines the purpose of the images in Christian churches: This making of pictures and icons, which are inscribed with pigments in our churches, is confined to, and follows, the example of the Scripture. And we depict in the church for the teaching and admonition of men every narra- tive which the Scripture regarded worthy of being a reminder, that whatever the Scripture relates for the hearing of the ear, the eye might see in the form of a picture. For Moses wrote: In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth . So where we [wish to] depict "in the beginning," we draw the likeness of the vari- ous things which were created in the six days. As the mind of man is able to provide a like- ness and a representation, so [we made one] of Abel, of Noah, of Abraham, of Jacob, Joseph, Moses, and of the rest, one after another until Christ; and of Christ and all his saving work, and after Christ of every saint who set foot in the struggle of the contest against sin, the sen- tences of whose judgments have been written down like those of Daniel and the companions of Hananiah. When men enter to worship, and see these narratives inscribed on the walls of the church in front of their eyes, will they not ask the learned, "What does this mean?" And the learned will teach and inform them in every way in accordance with it. Then the ignorant will learn, and by teaching knowledge will enter, and from knowledge will be born the fear of God (i6§§i9-ii; trans. Hayman) Sergios goes on to argue that Christians are not idola- trous in commemorating through images the names of holy men and women (i7§§i-2, 9). Sergios confirms that there were representations of saints in the churches, but he qualifies them as "narra- tives" and insists upon the instructive purpose of images (the so-called Biblia pauperum ). Any reference to wor- ship is carefully avoided, in contrast to the discussion of the bones of the martyrs, whose worship is expressly defended. The qualification of the images as "commem- orative" of the deeds of noble men further implies that most were, in fact, linked to martyria, just as the Jew put it in his intervention. This connection between the images and the martyrs' bones is made explicit in the final comment of the section on the images: Then we Christians, whenever we kiss the pic- tures of the righteous, it is as though we are embracing their bones. And when we hon- our their bones, we praise and acknowledge their Lord in them, to whom be praise, and honour, and dominion, and worship. (17513; trans. Hayman) The mention of the kissing of the icons at the end of the long section devoted to the martyrs' bones arrives unex;- pectedly, for the icons so far discussed were "commem- orative" images of "narratives." This kissing of pictures, albeit connected with the bones of the martyrs that sanctify the images, reflects an embryonic stage of icon worship. Honor is still given only to the bones, but we can confidently deduce that this subtle distinction was not felt by believers. It would, however, be hazardous to connect icon worship with Monophysitism only on the basis of this final statement;281 we would like to know more about the date and circumstances of this work and about the stages of its composition. Nevertheless, it appears from this text that images of saints in martyria of the Syrian Church were very common at the time and that the possibility of their being objects of icon worship was ever present, although that worship was not, apparently, adopted by the Church authorities; a situation that might be paralleled in the period imme- diately preceding iconoclasm in Byzantium. We can also mention the case of the Jacobite Abû Ra ita al-Takrītī, who lived in the early ninth century, thus belonging to the earliest generation of Christians living in Iraq under Abbasid rule who began to use Arabic for apologetic purposes. No reference to icon worship appears in his extant works, although he does consider Christian practices. In On the Proof of the Christian Religion and the Proof of the Holy Trinity , written between 821 and 825 under Mamūn, Abū Ra ita writes: 281 M. Mundeil, "Monophysite Church Decoration," in Bryer and Herrin, "Islam and Iconoclasm" (n. 14 above), 59-74, esp. 74, argued that the decoration of Monophysite churches in inland Syria and upper Mesopotamia was mainly - and already in the sixth cen- tury - non-figural. However, she warned: "It is still unclear whether non-figural decoration can be identified with the Monophysites, but there is definitely an overlap."

Keating) This passage goes beyond the usual references to idola- try in Christian authors; by using the Arabic word for "image" (Sjj-"3), frequently applied to icons, along with the terms usually given to idols, it identifies icon wor- ship with idolatry. If this text is representative of the Jacobite Church of the day, it might pinpoint a change of atti- tude toward icons, especially when contrasted with the arguments of Sergios the Stylitě. In the contempora- neous legend of Sergios-Bahīrā, which exists in Syriac and Arabic versions, again no mention is made of icons, whereas the monk preaches that people should bow in worship to only one cross and tries to dimin- ish the number of crosses on display in the churches. His position is not to be related to Byzantine icono- clasm or to a supposed symbolism of the One Cross,283 but can be easily explained by a desire to appease con- temporary Islam.284 If Islam had, indeed, attacked the symbol of the Christian Cross, how could the Muslims have remained unaffected by the more offen- sive icon worship? Finally, we must mention the Book ofEustathios , an Arabic apology for the Christian faith, probably dat- ing to the ninth century and thought to have been writ- ten by a Jacobite. A section dealing with the meaning of Christian veneration of icons has been preserved, but 282 S. T.

Their case is especially inter- esting, for since 750 they lived at the heart of Abbasid power.286 Once again, the evidence for icon worship in the ninth century is debatable. Let us review some of the testimonies. The Nestorian patriarch Timothy I (780-823), for instance, held a debate in Arabic with the caliph Mahdl in 781.287 Neither the Syriac summary of the debate, written by Timothy himself in a letter to the monk Sergios, nor the later Arabic translation refers to icons.288 Timothy does, however, have to respond to Muslim accusations that cult is paid to the cross by Christians. Futher afield, Timothy does, in one of his letters, refer to the veneration of the relics of saints and martyrs.289 285 E. Salah and M. N. Swanson, "Ustath al-Rāhib: The Monk Eustathius," in Thomas and Roggema, Christian-Muslim Relations , 907-10. 286 Teule, "Veneration of Images" (n. 9 above), collects evidence for icon worship among Nestorians since the sixth century; most of it antedates iconoclasm or is later than the tenth century.

In his Book of Scholia, he refers to the sacraments (such as the Eucharist) and the veneration of the cross, but says nothing about the worship of icons.292 However, among a still unedited series of litur- gical questions addressed to the Nestorian patriarch Isho bar Nun (823-827), there is one in which a priest is allowed to use an icon as godparent in a emergency, because of the absence of any relative for the baptism except the mother. The patriarch counsels them to use an icon of Christ if the child is a boy, of the Virgin if a girl.293 This case contrasts strikingly with the silence on icons in the previous authors. Until the text (which, by its nature, is open to updatings) is edited, definitive conclusions are impossible, but the anecdote seems suspicious a priori because it goes against the official canons of the church, which never admitted this prac- tice, as far as we know. Certainly, the practice existed 290 See M.

In another letter of Theodore, again undated, he even warns against those who think that the icon that is worshipped is physically present - though it is doubtful that this was for him a contradic- tion, as George Fatouros has suggested.296 In any case, it is clear that the iconodules never sanctioned this practice, which surely involved legal problems, since the godparents acted as witnesses of the baptism. We may presume that Isho bar Nun, who suc- ceeded Timothy as patriarch, acted with great caution in canonical questions. He appears to have limited the use of icons as godfathers to cases in which relatives were absent. His clarity about the icons of the Virgin and of Christ as the only ones admitted suggests, as in the case of Theodore of Stoudios, that icons of other saints were also used as godfathers, a practice deemed abusive by the patriarch. Isho bar Nun perhaps tried to control and restrict a practice that was more frequent than he wished. But he also went a step further than usual by admitting it under certain conditions, thus legitimizing a practice that was favored by many believ- ers. The anecdote does not indicate that icons were reg- ularly worshipped in the churches of the ninth century, but it does provide us, if it is not an interpolation, with the first substantive evidence of the existence of some cult of images among the Nestorian believers. It would be useful to learn more about the context that gener- ated this ruling by the patriarch, which seems a conces- sion to popular practices. Also of interest is a story preserved in the sup- posed autobiography of the Nestorian intellectual Hunayn ibn Ishaq (d. 873) :297 a fellow Christian, the 294 Letter to Louis the Pious 479 11. 1-2: Plerique autem linteamini- bus easdem imagines circumdabant et filiorum suorum de baptismatis fonte susceptrices faciebant (ed.

DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="51">Melkites and Icon Worship during the Iconoclastic Period | 185 physician Gabriel Bakhtīshu , denounced Hunayn before Mutawakkil (847-861) for being an atheist. As evidence, Gabriel told the caliph that Hunayn was willing to spit on the icon of Jesus and Mary. Before Hunayn was called into the presence of the caliph, Gabriel met him and told him that Mutawakkil had grown fond of an icon of the Virgin with Child and that he had been unable to deter him from paying high respect to it. He presents the case to Hunayn as follows: ". . . He [the caliph] has already said to me [Gabriel], 'Look at this wonderful image! What do you think of it?' I told him, Its a picture like the ones they paint on the walls of bathhouses and churches or use in decorations; it is not the kind of thing we are concerned about or pay any attention to at all/ He said, 'So it means nothing to you?' 'Thats right,' I said. 'Spit on it, then, and we shall see if you are telling the truth,' he said. So I spat on it and left him there laughing up a storm. Of course I did this just so he would get rid of it and stop provoking us with it and making us feel different from everyone else. If someone gives him the idea of using it against us, the situ- ation can only get worse. So, if he calls for you [Hunayn] and asks you questions like the ones he asked me, the best thing to do is to do what I did. I have spread the word among the rest of our friends who might see him, and told them to do the same." I [Hunayn] fell for this stupid trick and agreed to follow his advice. Accordingly, when Hunayn comes into the presence of the caliph and is questioned about the icon, he spits on it. But the caliph then summons Theodosios, the head of the Nestorian church,298 who kisses and embraces the icon and say s that a Christian deserves excommu- nication and punishment if he spits on it. The caliph gave the icon to the patriarch and, after striking and torturing Hunayn, confiscated his properties and put him to prison. 298 Theodosios held this position between 853 and 855. His appointment was due to Gabriel Bakhtīshu ; see J. M. Fiey, Chrétiens syriaques sous les Abbasides surtout à Bagdad (749-1258), CSCO 420 (Louvain, 1980), 90-91. For Griffith, this story, whether authentic or not, "did nevertheless circulate in Arabic in the world of Islam and it eloquently testifies to the sanctity of icons among the Christians and to how readily they served as occasions of challenge and controversy in the con- frontation between Muslims and Christians in the early Islamic period . . . And it also testifies to the even- tual disappearance among the Christians living under Muslims of any lingering sense of iconophobia, such as seemed to plague them for a time during the first Abbasid century."299 Griffith s interpretation, which presents Hunayns iconoclasm as the exception and Theodosioss iconod- ulia as the rule, deserves debate. To begin with, it does matter whether the story is authentic or not, for this has crucial consequences for the dating. In fact, the supposed autobiography of Hunayn has been preserved by the later historian of medicine, Ibn Abî Usaybi'a (d. 1270), under the general title Epistle on the Trials and Tribulations which Befell Hunayn ibn Ishãq. It consists of an introductory part, of a sober and general tone, which is followed by the lengthy account of the trap laid for Hunayn by a fellow Christian. The account is full of improbabilities, such as the caliph s amazement at the vision of a common icon or even Hunayns spitting on it. In fact, if Hunayn had known that icons were gener- ally worshiped in his own community, he would surely abstained from spitting on it. And, of course, the caliph would never have punished him for doing so. The anec- dote appears, therefore, to have been concocted at a later stage and not written by Hunayn himself. In fact, it resembles similar stories also told in the first person in the Thousand and One Nights by caliphs or other dignitaries of the Abbasid court of the early ninth cen- tury, stories that are obviously literary recreations of the past.300 Although Hunayns account is considered one 299 Griffith, "Iconophilia and Iconophobia" (n. 9 above), 372-74. B. Hemmerdinger, "Hunain ibn Ishãq et l'iconoclasme byzantin," Actes du XIIe Congrès International d'Etudes Byzantines (Belgrade, 1964), 2:467-69, holds that Hunayn became an iconoclast after travelling to the Byzantine Empire. G. Strohmaier, "Hunain ibn Ishãq und die Bilder," Klio 43-45 (1965): 525-33, thinks that the text was written by a student of Hunayn and thus reflects his icono- clastic views against increasingly prevalent icon worship, although Strohmaier denies any connection with contemporary iconoclasm in Byzantium; see also Fiey, Chrétiens syriaques , 104. 300 The physician Gabriel Bakhtīshu seems to be the protagonist of several similar stories, together with the caliph Mutawakkil, for he DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="52">l8 6 I JUAN SIGNES CODOÑER of the first autobiographies in Arabic, it is doubtful that the whole text, as it has been transmitted, was indeed written by him.301 On the other hand, it is worthy of remark that Gabriel tells the caliph that icons are placed only on the walls of bathhouses and churches or used in deco- rations, but avoids mentioning any kind of worship - such as that later displayed by patriarch Theodosios before Mutawakkil - or what appears to be a port- able icon. It is as if the reference to the decorative use of icons in profane (bathhouses) or sacred (walls of the churches, but not at the altar) places reflected the normal praxis of the time (which could even have been tolerated by iconoclasts), whereas their worship represented a novelty.302 The Nestorian bishop Elias of Nisibis (975-1046) made, in fact, the same com- ment about the inappropriate presence of icons in the churches and bathhouses of the Melkites at a later time, when a discussion about icon worship developed among the different Christian confessions.303 Nevertheless, despite all these qualifications, the text links the practice of icon worship with another patriarch of the Nestorian church of the ninth century and, therefore, suggests that the ecclesiastical authori- ties of the East Syrians of the ninth century may have paved the way for a certain acceptance of icon wor- ship in the liturgy - even though they had their see in Baghdad, the residence of the caliphs. The question remains open whether the reign of Ma'mûn had some responsibility for this shift in attitude toward icons or whether other reasons remain to be elucidated. 11. Finding the Balance We have reviewed the evidence for icon worship among the Melkites between 726 and 843. Despite the long- standing perception that the Melkite Church was a unanimously fervent partisan of images, we have was very close to him and influential at the court; see Fiey, Chrétiens syriaques , 91-93. 301 It is first in the anthology of Reynolds, Interpreting the Self (n. 297 above). 302 Strohmaier, "Hunain ibn Ishaq," 532, quotes a passage of another work of Hunayn where this refers to the custom of the Christians to decorate their churches with pictures. 303 See H. G. B. Teule, "Išoyahb bar Malkon's Treatise on the Veneration of the Holy Icons," in Tamcke, Christians and Muslims (n. 287 above), 157-69, reflecting the polemic in the twelfth century. presented abundant evidence that allows us to qualify this picture. To begin with, the existence of icons or of some kind of icon worship among the Melkite Christians of the time is certain. Indeed, some anecdotes, especially in hagiographies, inform us of the presence of icons in the everyday life of common Melkite Christians (§9). Further evidence of the presence of icons in the churches is gained from texts of the Jacobite and Nestorian churches and even from icons or images pre- served in Egypt (§10). Moreover, there were prominent Melkite figures like John of Damascus and Theodore Abū Qurra (if On the Veneration of the Holy Icons is wholly his) who wrote fundamental works in defense of icon worship (§§3 and 9). We have also seen that some Greek and Latin sources provide evidence in support of icon worship in the eastern patriarchates, particularly the synodical letter of the patriarch of Jerusalem in 767 (§5). More controversial is the undated Antioch synod suppos- edly summoned by Theodore(t) (§6). This evidence is surely debatable and discouragingly scanty, but despite suspicions of later manipulation of the original texts, it appears that some Melkite representatives tried to win the support of the papacy against the meddling of Byzantine emperors and occasionally defended, for their own instrumental reasons, the existence of reli- gious icons (rather than icon worship) in their diplo- matic exchanges with their "Brother Churches." However, it is, in any case, unwarranted to suppose that the Melkite hierarchy as a whole was either icono- clast or iconodule along the lines defined by the strug- gle in Constantinople. The Melkite prelates probably did not want, as a rule, to get involved in a polemic that was not their own, so that Constantinople repeatedly used fraud or pressure to project an image of unanimity among the eastern churches, which corresponded not to reality but to the interest of the Byzantine Empire. In fact, the Melkite representatives attending the council sessions of Nicaea II were of dubious legitimacy, which corresponds well with the image of Theodore Abū Qurra ignoring the very existence of Nicaea II. That the Melkites were divided at this time has also been shown (§3), although it appears impossible to speak about majorities or minorities among the Melkites on the question of icon worship, just as it is likewise impossible for contemporary Constantinople, where the changing official position of the ecclesiastical DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 67</page><page sequence="53">Melkites and Icon Worship during the Iconoclastic Period | 187 hierarchy determines, for good or ill, our perception of the problem. We also proved that neither John of Damascus nor Theodore Abù Qurra should be con- sidered the official spokesman of the Melkite hier- archy (§§3 and 9). In fact, their works appeared as a response to a growing opposition to images amongst the Christians of Syria and Palestine, who increasingly felt the need to accommodate to Islamic "iconophobia." Extant icon worship was probably either ignored or tolerated by many believers, when not hidden due to the pressure of both the "iconophobic" Islamic authori- ties (the so-called Yazld decree) (§1) and the "iconoclas- tic" emperors (§4). The Melkite hierarchy seems, for the most part, to have avoided entering into a polemic that was probably largely imported from outside and that might have created unnecessary tension amongst believers. Accordingly, we have no positive evidence of icon- oclasm in Syria and Palestine at the time. Nor does the destruction of figurative images on the mosaics of the Palestinian churches during the ninth century have anything to do with Byzantine iconoclasm, although it does reflect an increasing hostility toward images (§2). Nevertheless, it appears highly relevant that most Melkite theological treatises and debates in Arabic (§8) rarely mention images and when they do it is with evident annoyance or even hostility. Thus, the active defense of the cross and occasional abhorrence of idols that appears in these texts proves that there were many Christians who simply did not consider icon worship a part of their credo in the way that Byzantine iconodules did. It was only when images gained added value as rel- ' ics, as in the case of the famous Christ of Edessa, that their cult was accepted by the Church. This indifference or neglect of icon worship among many Melkite prelates (a situation perhaps anal- ogous to that in the Empire before the outbreak of the iconoclast crisis) made it possible for iconoclast emper- ors in Constantinople to gain their backing, since the question of the icons does not seem to have been deter- minant for the policy of their church. However, we scarcely found evidence for that even during the reign of Constantine V, and it is only during the reign of Theophilos that the three Melkite patriarchs addressed Theophilos and hailed him as a triumphant emperor (§4). The iconoclast struggle apparently did not repli- cate itself among the Melkites, except for those of the diaspora in Italy or Constantinople. In sum, both iconoclastic and iconodule tenden- cies are equally attested among the Melkites in the period envisaged here. Both attitudes to icon worship probably coexisted synchronically and were not just determined by the influence of Constantinople or the pressure of Islamic iconophobia, but also by a string of factors such as the nature of the "images" themselves (holy icons versus relics or simple decorative or ex-voto images), social background (city versus countryside, hierarchy of the church versus normal believers), eth- nicity (Greek- versus Semitic-speaking populations), theological schools (Maximites versus Maronites), or even geography (Syria and Palestine versus Egypt). Much work remains to be done and new texts, such as the recently discovered (and still unedited!) treatises of patriarch Sophronios (§10), will substan- tially modify the picture drawn in the previous pages. In any case, this state of affairs seems to have changed during the second half of the ninth century, mainly during the patriarchate of Photios. The Melkite hierar- chy formally accepted Nicaea II as the seventh ecumen- ical council in 779-80, at the council that consecrated Photios as patriarch for a second time.304 It took still more time until this acceptance was widespread among all Melkite believers. The Byzantine reconquest of Syria during the tenth century was probably decisive in estab- lishing icon worship in the Melkite lands, amid a gen- eral breakdown of caliphal power.

They were even accused of being false representatives in the council of 879-80 conducted by Photios.
