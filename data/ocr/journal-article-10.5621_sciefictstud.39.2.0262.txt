<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 262 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) Amanda Thibodeau Alien Bodies and a Queer Future: Sexual Revision in Octavia Butler’s “Bloodchild” and James Tiptree, Jr.’s “With Delicate Mad Hands” In his introduction to the pioneering and influential Fear of a Queer Planet (1993), Michael Warner analyzes the image of humanity that accompanied NASA’s 1972 Pioneer 10 spacecraft. The drawing of a naked man and woman, which betrays several assumptions about gender and relationships, was designed by Carl Sagan and his wife to “show scientifically educated inhabitants of some other star system—who might intercept it millions of years from now—when Pioneer was launched, from where, and by what kind of human beings” (qtd. Warner xxi). In their preparations for potential intergalactic encounters with alien races, the scientists were very careful to present an accurate and benevolent picture of humanity—as heterosexual, monogamous, and patriarchal. As Warner notes, “They [the man and woman] are not just sexually different; they are sexual difference itself” (xxiii). He continues: “It testifies to the depth of the culture’s assurance (read: insistence) that humanity and heterosexuality are synonymous. This reminder speeds to the ends of the universe, announcing to the passing stars that earth is not, regardless of what anyone says, a queer planet” (xxiii). The image normalizes the assumption that heterosexuality informs most sex/gender systems in contemporary society. That scientists imagined (somewhat foolishly, as Warner contends) that aliens would be able to read heteronormativity from a rough outline, and that this identity should be used as a representation of all of Earth’s cultures, not only demonstrates the fear of coming out of the closet as a queer planet—of being identified as a society that acknowledges diverse forms of sexuality and desire—but also betrays the possibility—and for many, the hope—for a space of queerness, on Earth and in the realms of possibility explored by speculative fiction. In other words, though the sketch might, on the surface, assume heteronormativity for aliens as well as for ourselves, the underlying implication is that aliens might not be heteronormative after all—a possibility that many would see as hopeful rather than monstrous.  Ever since we realized the vastness of space and the unlikelihood of our being the only successful, thriving civilization in the universe, we have imagined the possibility of encountering alien species. While NASA’s image of humankind revealed a great deal about our self-image in 1972, the conceptualization of the alien body and our potential relationship to that body in science fiction reveals utopian desires and dystopian fears in its visions of the far future, constructing the alien body and social systems with signifiers from the human present to demonstrate these desires and fears. From displaced narratives of the Yellow Peril in space serials of the early twentieth century to </page> <page sequence="2"> ALIEN BODIES AND A QUEER FUTURE 263 Cold War panic in New Wave texts, the alien body bears the burden of utopian representation, displaying a shifting pattern of fears and hopes for the future as the century progresses and media alter and proliferate.1 While alien bodies have often represented feared “otherness,” they offer feminist science fiction a rich site for the re-imagining of gender, sexuality, and identity within narratives that challenge the heteronormative implications of “progress” built into space exploration narratives. As NASA’s illustration of “humanity” demonstrates, the desire to encounter aliens is almost always accompanied by a desire to demonstrate human strength, ingenuity, and ambition—three traits often appropriated by a masculine imperial ideology that penetrates unknown or virgin frontiers, but which many feminist and queer sf texts, classic and contemporary, subvert in order to queer heteronormative constructions of empire, exploration, and genre.2 A definitive example of such a text is Ursula K. Le Guin’s The Left Hand of Darkness (1969).The novel’s use of an androgynous alien species not only explores gender as an essential element of social construction, but also imagines a world free of the male/female binary that so thoroughly dictates identity and informs discourse. More than forty years later, Le Guin’s legacy thrives, renewed by other queer sf novels of the same period, such as Joanna Russ’s The Female Man (1975) and Samuel R. Delany’s Triton (1976) and “Aye, and Gomorrah” (1967). More recent examples include Nicola Griffith’s Ammonite (1993), Melissa Scott’s Shadow Man (1996), Joe Haldeman’s Camouflage (2004), and Kij Johnson’s disturbing “Spar” (2009). The New Wave of the 1960s and 1970s, and the associated increase in feminist science fiction with its subversive representations of gender and power, was a fundamental period in the evolution of the queerly constructed sf alien. The experimental fiction of authors such as Le Guin and Russ led to further queer explorations of alien bodies. Such works as Octavia E. Butler’s “Bloodchild” (1984) and James Tiptree, Jr.’s “With Delicate Mad Hands” (1981), which will be at the center of my discussion here, can be, in Veronica Hollinger’s words, “(re)read queerly” for their imagining of “otherness” in the alien body as a site of possibility. These two stories queer traditional space exploration and “final frontier” narratives, which typically rely on a heteronormative imperial thrust. These two stories are deeply uncomfortable, especially for an audience accustomed to appealing and masculine heroes, replications of heterosexual fantasies, and traditional progress narratives with safe and satisfying conclusions. Depicting unpleasant characters, horrifying events, and unlikely, even abject, choices, Butler and Tiptree take the traditional generic convention of space travel and morph it into something radically dangerous and wickedly resistant. Utopian Bodies and Queer Views. In Archaeologies of the Future (2005), Fredric Jameson discusses the alien body as a representation of utopian ideals. He argues that “to imagine a new heaven and a new earth ... offers representation its ultimate Utopian challenge” (120). The alien body crystallizes and answers this challenge: “for a new quality already begins to demand a new </page> <page sequence="3"> 264 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) kind of perception, and that new perception in turn a new organ of perception, and thus ultimately a new kind of body” (120). Imagining a new world, then, demands the imagining of new bodies; the alien body transforms the mundane human body by heightening, altering, or producing utopian new organs of perception, intellect, and movement. More often than not, Jameson suggests, the alien body is a kind of Chimera, “an ingeniously cobbled together object in which secondary features of our own world are primary in the new one” (120). Jameson’s particular interest in the alien body relates to issues of class and social structure and most of his close readings are of science fiction from the 1950s through the 1970s, including the New Wave. After this time, he notes  a distinct shift in the genre from using the alien body to represent utopian notions of work and class struggle in the wake of the Cold War to using the alien body as an allegory for gender and sexuality. “Subversion of the norm” of gender, Jameson argues, “come[s] by way of the defamiliarization of those human norms and customs which the alien gender arrangement may provoke” (137). Although Jameson sees the shift to “perversion,” in which “sexual intercourse with the alien becomes a figure for everything non-normative or deviant or taboo in human society,” as a “waning of the Utopian imagination” of the Golden Age of science fiction, several recent science fiction and queer critics disagree (140-41). In “(Re)reading Queerly,” Veronica Hollinger, for example, uses Annamarie Jagose’s explanation of queer theory—that queer is “‘the point of convergence for a potentially infinite number of non-normative subject positions’”(Jagose qtd.Hollinger 312)—to argue that “queer marks a utopian space,” a “zone of possibilities” that can take shape and thrive in the realm of science fiction (312). Hollinger points out that:  science fiction would seem to be ideally suited, as a narrative mode, to the construction of imaginative challenges to the smoothly oiled technologies of heteronormativity.... However, in spite of science fiction’s function as a literature of cognitive estrangement, and in spite of the work of both feminist writers and critics...heterosexuality as an institutionalized nexus of human activity remains stubbornly resistant to defamiliarization. (302)  In “Queering the Coming Race? A Utopian Historical Imperative,” De Witt Douglas Kilgore, considering the role of race and sexuality in sf, voices a similar concern, saying that the “tacit approval of heteronormative whiteness as the dominant social relation of the future has been a central feature of this past century’s science fiction” (237). He argues that “the task of imagining a queer futurity” requires a reexamination of the assumptions made about race, gender, and sexuality within the science-fiction genre (233). Hollinger, using stories by Russ, Tiptree, and C.L. Moore, advocates specifically for“(re)reading” feminist texts to uncover their defamiliarization of gender and sexuality. Wendy Gay Pearson, in “Alien Cryptographies: The View from Queer” (1999), uses queer theory to reread texts that may not be “overtly queer,” but instead can be read in historical and sociological context for the ways in which they offer discursive challenges to heteronormativity. She proposes a “radical re-writing of the assumption within the [text] of the naturalness, endurance, and </page> <page sequence="4"> ALIEN BODIES AND A QUEER FUTURE 265 fixity of our current understandings of sexuality and its relationship both to the sex/gender dyad and to sociocultural institutions,” a “vision of the future in which queerness is neither hidden nor revealed as difference, but is simply there” (2). Pearson applies a queer reading to the alien bodies of several texts to examine their “discursive challenges” to sex/gender systems in cultures both real and imaginary,“decoding the outlaw cryptographies” that hide sexual difference and  disinterring the many and peculiar ways through which the dominant twentieth- century Western conception of sexuality underlies, is implicated in, and sometimes collides with sf’s attempt to envision alternative ways of being-in-the- world, ways which are always, no matter how deeply their signs are hidden, already about being-in-the-world as a person with a sex, a gender, and a sexuality. (18)  Unlike Jameson, she does not view the move in science fiction toward sexing the alien body “as a waning of Utopia”; rather, for her, and for myself, aliens in science fiction present a unique opportunity for staging and pushing the boundaries of utopian notions of gender and sexuality.3 In Queer Universes: Sexualities in Science Fiction (2008), Hollinger, Pearson, and Joan Gordon present the first (and at this point definitive) study of queer theory and sf; the collection stresses the importance of sexuality to the genre, the ways in which heteronormativity is both reinforced and undermined, and the potential for science fiction to imagine new worlds and modes of thought that may posit a livable world for queer subjects. In the introduction, the editors argue for “queer (re)readings of classic feminist sf texts” because they “can lead to a fresh appreciation not only of the extent to which some sf stories have always challenged the technologies of compulsory heterosexuality, but also of the extent to which contemporary sf imagines alternative ways of living in the world as a sexual/ized object” (6). Queer Universes includes Kilgore’s essay on race and sexuality in which he states: A future that seems queer from our perspective—that is, one not implicated in our experience of race, gender, and sexuality—would result from a resignification of the sexual customs we consider natural. Since our sexuality has as much to do with pleasure and power as with reproduction, such resignification inevitably calls into question our possessive investments in race and gender, culture and nation. (237) Taking up this project, I (re)read Butler’s and Tiptree’s stories, both published during Jameson’s period of “the waning of Utopianism,” to demonstrate how aliens in sf reveal the ways sexuality is bound up with race and cultural identity, with utopia, and with the impulse to explore.4 If aliens always already exist outside the normal, and if “queer” means that which is outside or resists regimes of the normal, a queer reading of speculative alien bodies and relationships is a useful and organic approach to analyzing their utopian implications. Following Jameson’s example, as well as Lyman Tower Sargent’s in “The Three Faces of Utopianism Revisited” (1993), I do not limit the concept of utopia to those desires or imaginative realms that merely reflect </page> <page sequence="5"> 266 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) a positive ideal. Sargent gives utopia another name, “social dreaming” (3). In dreams about social change and individual desire, positive and negative utopias are not mutually exclusive but often engage in a complicated relationship of circulating and corresponding desires that contain both utopian and dystopian elements. Thus, my positioning of the alien body as utopian in these feminist texts encompasses the broader implications of social dreaming: that sometimes the nightmares are just as essential as the daydreams to understanding utopia—as a genre, as a fictional space, and as a wish. Though some queer scholars argue that utopianism encodes heteronormative models of reproductive futurity, even to the extent of articulating anti-utopian theory, I use the notion of utopia to signify possibility and desire—unknown, not-yet-constructed, often unimaginable, but no less ideal or hopeful.5 For José Estaban Muñoz in Cruising Utopia (2009): Queerness is a longing that propels us onward, beyond romances of the negative and toiling in the present.... [I]t is not simply a being but a doing for and toward the future. Queerness is essentially about the rejection of a here and now and an insistence on potentiality or concrete possibility in another world. (1)  “Bloodchild” and “With Delicate Mad Hands” challenge the idea that the future (and thus utopia) relies on heteroproductivity; rather, utopia can demonstrate a rejection of present constructions for a future vision. Theories that articulate the deconstruction, the multiplication, or the eradication of systems of categorization embody utopian principles; these include not only the Marxist utopias that Jameson claims represent the Golden Age of science fiction, but also theories of queerness and sexual difference, such as Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s concept of nonce taxonomies, the rejection of traditional categories because “people are different from one another” (22). The world Sedgwick imagines with its endless taxonomies and a never-ending capacity to alter, create, or destroy them, epitomizes the project of queer science fiction and utopia, signaling not a waning of quality within the genre but a deepening of implications and an expansion into realms hitherto unexplored.  Queer Explorations and Monstrous Bodies. In the afterword to the second edition (2005) of her short story “Bloodchild,” Octavia Butler describes her unique vision of space travel and alien encounter: “It wouldn’t be the British Empire in space, and it wouldn’t be Star Trek.... Who knows what we humans have that others might be willing to take in trade for a livable space on a world not our own?” (31-32). Rather than replicating imperialism or spreading peace and diplomacy, Butler writes a “story about paying the rent” (31). The trope of space exploration, with its alien encounters and discovery and colonization of new planets, often parallels the Western trope of expansion, with its discourses of imperialism, manifest destiny, and the spread of civilization.6 Istvan Csicsery- Ronay, Jr., in “Science Fiction and Empire” (2003), argues that “the conditions for the emergence of sf as a genre are made possible by three factors: the technological expansion that drove real imperialism, the need felt by national audiences for literary-cultural mediation as their societies were transformed from historical nations into hegemons, and the fantastic model of achieved </page> <page sequence="6"> ALIEN BODIES AND A QUEER FUTURE 267 technoscientific Empire” (231). He identifies technology as the condition for both imperialism and science fiction, representing the might and motivation of imperial discourse and the “central fascination” of the sf genre. He explains:  The genre’s favorite counterfactual operations and mechanisms are all made rational by imperial ontology. Time-machines, faster-than-light travel, galactic history, parallel universes, the restless reconstruction of relationships between the center and the periphery endlessly replayed in the relationship between Old Earth and the offworlds, aliens and cyborgs, space opera, utopia and dystopia—these motifs, like many others in sf, rely on a cosmos governed by the law and rights of technoscience, and yet are open to almost infinite variation. (238)  According to Csicsery-Ronay, many of the conventional devices of sf derive from or are motivated by imperial ontology. In “Colonizing the Universe” (2001), Greg Grewell identifies three categories of “master-narrative” in the projection of anxieties and desires outward to the realm of space and the symbolic alien: the explorative (the “discovery” of an often inhospitable alien planet and race), the domesticative (settling/colonizing the alien wilderness), and the combative (narratives of conflict). All three categories suggest narratives of colonization, and Grewell draws connections between these and early American records of conflict and conquest. The discourse of Empire, with its insistence on discovery, domestication, and the conquering of subordinate races and wilderness, has continued to underpin literature and social systems long past the end of colonial rule.7 But the progress narrative of space exploration and alien encounter can be subverted to suggest alternative constructions of hegemony and desire.  Anne McClintock’s discussion in Imperial Leather (1995) of the gendering of imperialist discourse in the context of the British Empire, can usefully be applied to such a revision. She describes the feminization of so-called “virgin” or empty lands, as the continents of Africa, the Americas, and Asia were “libidinously eroticized,” inspiring fantasies of “monstrous sexuality of far-off lands” (22). Imperialism, she argues, was animated by “gendered erotics of knowledge” or a power relationship between two gendered spaces—male civilization and female Nature. “Knowledge of the unknown world was mapped as a metaphysics of gender violence.... In these fantasies, the world is feminized and spatially spread for male exploration, then reassembled and deployed in the interests of massive imperial power,” making men “‘masters and possessors of nature’” and thus of women (23-24). The image of the woman in imperialist discourse is almost always that of the Other. She serves “as [a] mediating and threshold [figure],” and articulates “a strategy of violent containment.” As a threat to masculine power, she instigates rape and violence to prevent male boundary loss (24). Here is the imperialist thrust to mythologize the emptiness of the (not at all empty) virgin lands, to name and thus exert the imperialist’s power over these lands and their peoples—in the final analysis, to destroy the threatening, feminized peoples in order to dispel male anxieties over boundary loss and assert patriarchal narratives on lands “passively awaiting the thrusting, male insemination of history, language, and reason” (31). According to </page> <page sequence="7"> 268 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) McClintock, then, imperialist narrative is layered with discourses of gender, race, and sexuality.  The impulse to “discover” and colonize is deeply connected to reproductive and erotic drives, rendering the project of imperialism one of the most heteronormative forces in history. A queering of this system would thus necessitate a re-imagining of the impulse to explore. While science fiction has the potential to offer alternatives to the divide-and-conquer mentality of expansion, it often repeats many of the same old tropes: feminizing the alien, colonizing “empty” planets, fetishizing phallic weapons and ships, penetrating  the unknown. Though “Bloodchild” and “With Delicate Mad Hands” can be read for the ways they queer bodies and sexuality, they also queer space exploration and the progress narrative by presenting alternative desires and suggesting alternative functions for space travel and alien encounters. The alien body, whether utopian or dystopian in its construction and relationship to human sex/gender systems, is also transformed by the very desire that provokes or initiates this relationship. These two stories demonstrate the relationship between sexuality and exploration. Octavia Butler, one of the first African American women sf writers, is often lauded for her revolutionary use of neo-slave narrative in texts such as Kindred (1979), and for her poignant treatment of themes of race, gender, and slavery in dystopian novels such as Parable of the Sower (1993). “Bloodchild” uses several of her customary motifs—power, race, and bondage—though Butler insists that, contrary to standard readings, it is not a story about slavery but rather “a love story between two very different beings” (“Bloodchild” 30).8 James Tiptree, Jr. (Alice Sheldon) masked her radical feminist sf in a fictitious masculine identity for a decade. Many critics, including Hollinger, see Tiptree’s work as anti-utopian, arguing that her fiction demonstrates “explorations of some of the more dismal exigencies of a naturalized heterosexuality, (re)constructed as a kind of inescapable heterosexual bind.... Her stories read like darkly parodic representations of the extremes of gender difference” (Hollinger 305). Among the clearest examples of this pessimism are “Love is the Plan, the Plan is Death” (1973), “The Girl Who Was Plugged In” (1973), and “The Screwfly Solution” (1977). Despite her pessimistic representations of sex/gender systems, Tiptree’s depiction of humanity is not without hope; in several works, including “Houston, Houston, Do You Read” (1976), “The Women Men Don’t See” (1973), and the one I discuss here, “With Delicate Mad Hands,” the author suggests that we can access a feminist or queer utopia by redefining the impulses and desires that impel us to seek new worlds.9 In both “Bloodchild” and “With Delicate Mad Hands,” aliens and space exploration represent the thrill of the unknown and the not-yet-desired. “Bloodchild” is “a text which simultaneously explores outer space ... and inner space, through metaphoric figures which illustrate and invite comment upon the construction of identity ... [and] highlight metaphoric considerations of race, gender, and species,” as Elyce Rae Helford notes (260). In the story, a community of Terrans have lived on an alien planet for several generations. The indigenous intelligent species, the Tlic, are a Chimeric combination of </page> <page sequence="8"> ALIEN BODIES AND A QUEER FUTURE 269 muscular snake coils, powerful insect legs and jaws, and mammalian spines. The human narrator describes T’Gatoi, his Tlic “mate,” as both graceful and powerful: “She had bones—ribs, a long spine, a skull, four sets of limb bones per segment. But when she moved that way, twisting, hurling herself into controlled falls, landing running, she seemed not only boneless, but aquatic— ... I loved watching her move” (9). The particular combination of bodily traits signifies to the reader both monstrosity and humanity. The snake coils, along with the insect legs, stinger, and body segments, conjuring images of serpents, scorpions, and cockroaches, indicate a grotesque and terrible power while the heart-shaped face and graceful movements imply intelligence and beauty. The monstrously beautiful T’Gatoi governs the Preserve upon which the Terrans are corralled for the dual purpose of human safety and Tlic reproduction by implantation. Gan, the narrator, is the human boy whom T’Gatoi has raised to carry her eggs.  The Tlic sex/gender system resembles the Terran sexual cycle of insects: the males mature quickly while the females live much longer. Given their different life cycles, the female Tlic not only raise their young, but they also create and control the cultural and social systems, while the males have little impact on the society. To reproduce, the Tlic females deposit fertilized eggs in the bodies of living warm-blooded hosts; when the eggs hatch, the young—resembling insect grubs—burrow or eat their way out of the living flesh of their hosts. Before the Terrans arrived on their planet, the Tlic had used unintelligent and unreliable animals that often killed the eggs before they hatched. As T’Gatoi explains to Gan, “Because your people arrived, we are relearning what it means to be a healthy, thriving people. And your ancestors, fleeing from their home-world, from their own kind who would have killed or enslaved them—they survived because of us” (25). Because the Terrans need a sanctuary and because the Tlic need reliable hosts, the two species, according to the Tlic, share a symbiotic relationship. To most Terrans—those in the story and those reading it—the relationship appears parasitic, a form of slavery worsened by the horror of the monstrous conditions. “Bloodchild” tells the coming-of-age, or perhaps the coming-out, story of Gan, and the complications that arise once he begins to understand the consequences of the Tlic/Terran relationship. Hand-chosen by T’Gatoi, a childhood friend of his mother’s and born from his father’s implanted flesh, Gan is raised to believe that the coupling of Terran and Tlic “was a good and necessary thing [they] did together—a kind of birth” (17). On the night the story takes place, however—what he describes as “my last night of childhood”—Gan witnesses T’Gatoi removing the grubs from a host separated from his Tlic partner. The scene, a horrifying re-imagining of a Caesarean section, is described by Gan as “wrong, alien.” Tying the agonized man in place and lightly anesthetizing him with her sting, T’Gatoi rips open the man’s body to remove the emerging grubs, who have released a sickening poison to alert the host of their impending hatching and feasting:  His body convulsed with the first cut. He almost tore himself away from me.... I had never heard such sounds come from anything human. T’Gatoi seemed to </page> <page sequence="9"> 270 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) pay no attention as she lengthened and deepened the cut, now and then pausing to lick away blood. His blood vessels contracted, reacting to the chemistry of her saliva, and the bleeding slowed.... She found the first grub. It was fat and deep red with his blood—both inside and out. It had already eaten its own egg case but apparently had not yet begun to eat its host. (15) In response to the procedure, Gan understandably questions his own commitment to T’Gatoi, reflecting, “I wouldn’t have thought anything about her could seem alien to me,” though “this was something else, something worse” than he had imagined (17). Though raised in the newly developing Tlic/Terran sex/gender system and thus conditioned to think of T’Gatoi as a mate and a maternal figure rather than as an alien, Gan has been sheltered from the physical reality of his gendered bodily expectations, and must now face the truth of his situation. The resulting confrontation between Gan and T’Gatoi reveals the ways in which their relationship, though intimate and sincere, is bound up in issues of power and social responsibility. This is also the moment that defines Gan’s queer desire to create something comprehensible, even normal, out of something abject. Devastated at the thought of being similarly implanted and ripped apart, eaten from the inside, his only relief from pain the saliva of the blood-sucking creature responsible for his agony, Gan threatens to kill himself with a rifle. As he debates whether or not to pull the trigger, he asks T’Gatoi: “What are you?... What are we to you?” (24), a question that had never seemed significant before but now voices the concerns of every Terran. The question and its unspoken answers (lover? livestock? co-parent?) reveal both the precariousness and the strangeness of the relationship, as well as the facade of mutual respect and affection masking the astronomically high stakes of life and death for each of them. T’Gatoi’s answer—“you know me as no other does.... You must decide” (24)—is both maddeningly abstract and deeply resonant, since it demonstrates their intimacy while suggesting, somewhat falsely, an element of choice. The Tlic tries to regain the upper hand; when Gan demands that she formally ask him to act as host, she answers manipulatively: “For my children’s lives?” (24). The implication is clear: T’Gatoi does not need to ask permission or to court Gan. As the story makes apparent, many Terrans are taken by force or chosen at random; the relationship between the two main characters, however, fostered over years in which T’Gatoi joined her family to Gan’s, exemplifies a shift toward intimacy and respect between partners. While this trend makes life more bearable for the humans and establishes long and fruitful couplings, it is unnecessary for the Tlic, given their greater strength and political power. By insisting that T’Gatoi ask permission to bear her young, Gan illustrates their unequal relationship. In this pivotal scene, T’Gatoi subtly reminds Gan of her physical and political dominance while he makes it clear that he has control, and that the power of decision—to kill himself, to kill the Tlic, to accept the role of host, or to send T’Gatoi, heavy with an egg, to implant his unknowing sister—rests with him. In demanding that she acknowledge his choice, Gan forces T’Gatoi to recognize the parasitic nature of their relationship and opens </page> <page sequence="10"> ALIEN BODIES AND A QUEER FUTURE 271 up the possibility of becoming a new kind of subject: not one who, like his brother, is hostile toward the Tlic nor, like his sister, blindly embraces their authority, but one who acknowledges the risks and desires each partner brings to the union. The risks are crystallized for Gan in his witnessing of the Tlic “birth”; he realizes that the key to power lies in knowledge and that Terran children should be “shown [a birth] more than once” to fully understand the reality of bearing Tlic young (28). Gan wishes to be an advocate, to “be the first public example” of a new model of partnership (29). By acquiescing to T’Gatoi’s formal request, Gan also reveals his own emotional and physical desire to enter into the partnership, made evident by his reaction to the thought of T’Gatoi “doing it to” another Terran. Gan urges T’Gatoi to “do it to me” so “[I can] keep you to myself” (27). Although his desire to be T’Gatoi’s partner may confuse Gan (and perhaps the reader), he accepts it: “I didn’t understand it, but it was so” (28).10 The subsequent scene, in which T’Gatoi deposits her egg inside Gan, is heavy with clichéd erotic language and imagery, more a scene of lovemaking than of alien or insect implantation. Gan plays the role of the virgin: “I undressed and lay down beside her. I knew what to do, what to expect. I had been told all my life” (27). The act itself resembles sex: “So easy going in. She undulated slowly against me, her muscles forcing the egg from her body into mine” (27). The scene ends with relaxed and open post-coital conversation, rubbing of shoulders and limbs, and whispered promises: “I won’t leave you.... I’ll take care of you” (29). The traditional gender roles are here reversed: the female penetrates the male, who appears virginal and inexperienced, though versed in expectations. The female comforts and reassures with promises to care for the male and their children. The intimate eroticism of the scene, in conjunction with the gender reversal, distracts from the earlier horror of the alien/human relationship, but cannot entirely erase the sense of abomination. The gender roles of the larger society also represent alternative structures of power and culture, with the exclusively female adult Tlics holding absolute authority over Terrans such as Gan, who has been socially conditioned to a set of gender expectations that are more conventionally feminine—docility, receptivity, and monogamous desire. In “‘Would You Rather Die than Bear My Young?’: The Construction of Gender, Race, and Species in Octavia E. Butler’s ‘Bloodchild’” (1994), Helford points out that the story “evokes a problematic biological essentialism” because there is such a strong tie between sexed embodiment and gendered identity: Through this reversal of traditional human gender roles under Western patriarchy, we see a biologically determined matriarchy whose hierarchical nature limits its effectiveness as a creative textual response to patriarchy. Ultimately, destabilizing social roles would be more effective if biology were not destiny in Tlic culture, regardless of whether it resulted in patriarchy or matriarchy. (265)11 Butler certainly referred  to “Bloodchild” as her “pregnant man story,” suggesting that the story can be read as a mere reverse-metaphor for patriarchal oppression. The Tlic/Terran symbiotic relationship as represented by Gan and </page> <page sequence="11"> 272 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) T’Gatoi, however, undermines heteronormativity on more levels than a simple sex-role reversal. A number of elements of the narrative challenge heteronormativity, including notions of beauty, maternity, partnership, and choice.12 Helford discusses how Gan’s negotiation of autonomy with T’Gatoi “addresses and challenges the misleading nature of categories such as ‘slave’ and ‘master,’ thereby also complicating race relations and historical understanding in the world outside the text” (268). Gan’s choice exerts a similar resistance to gender relations and historical understandings of desire. Patricia Melzer, in Alien Constructions (2006), provides a different reading of Butler’s gender construction, pointing out that: In “Bloodchild,” Butler reminds us that the reproductive function of women does not produce “natural” social structures, but that these structures are constructed by power.... The figures ... in “Bloodchild” destabilize the reproduction process as we know it, and therefore make the “natural” construction of categories impossible. (85) Melzer argues that by destabilizing our understandings of gender and further “problematiz[ing] aspects of violent (hetero)sexuality and power” in her “depictions of alien sex with humans,” Butler provides “decidedly queer elements where desire and physical stimulation are physically decentered” (86). Melzer shows how heteronormativity informs countless aspects of desire and social identity, including race, and how Butler’s “love story” of an alien and a human queers an otherwise conventional generic device by offering an alternative to that construction. Ultimately, simply to argue that the relationship between Gan and T’Gatoi is queer would be to overlook both the evident mirroring of heterosexuality and misogyny in Butler’s text and the critique of other heteronormative elements throughout the story. Instead, Butler aligns the alien body and its relationship to Gan (and thus to the reader) with queer heteronormativity on a number of levels, evident in the re-imagining of family, birth, and eroticism. The key to my queer reading lies not only in Gan’s demand for choice, but also in his attempts to transcend his feelings of abjection and horror in order to reach a new understanding of his intimacy with T’Gatoi. Though their relationship is described as a partnership, it is Gan who seeks validation and equality, for he has the most to lose—his social status, his family’s livelihood, and his life. When negotiating his relationship with T’Gatoi, Gan insists she break the law to allow his family to keep a rifle as protection. He demands, “If we’re not your animals, if these are adult things, accept the risk. There is risk, Gatoi, in dealing with a partner” (26). Risk and choice are central to recent theories of queer subjectivity. In In a Queer Time and Place (2005), Judith Halberstam articulates a notion of queer time, “a term for those specific models of temporality that emerge within postmodernism once one leaves the temporal frames of bourgeois reproduction and family, longevity, risk/safety, and inheritance” (Halberstam 6). Because many queer subjects live outside the heteronormative logic of these frames, “for some queer subjects, time and space are limned by risks they are willing to take” in order to construct new frames (10). The Tlic/Terran </page> <page sequence="12"> ALIEN BODIES AND A QUEER FUTURE 273 relationship, though horrifying, imbalanced, and born from a strange mix of slavery and parasitism, also reframes the heteronormative logic of time and space, evident in the risks each partner assumes. The relationship demonstrates the “radical (re)writing” of desire that Pearson argues constitutes a queer text as well as the “resignification of the sexual customs we consider natural” (cited above) that Kilgore proposes in order to undermine the heteronormative whiteness that dominates sf. This alternative desire is crystallized in Gan’s consent to become intimate with T’Gatoi and bear her young, a choice that despite its political ramifications, would never have been made without real desire and love. Also important to a queer reading is a consideration of the Tlic bodies in “Bloodchild”: monstrous, insect-like, incompatible with our perception of civilized or evolved bodies, they represent both dystopian and utopian elements. The dystopian elements, obvious in the horror and abjection of their construction, often obscure the more hopeful qualities of Tlic physiology such as their grace and power, the medicinal qualities of their eggs, and the comfort and protection offered by their strong bodies and keen intellect. I read utopian queerness in the eroticism of the unknown and incomprehensible—the desire across a boundary we consider uncrossable—and the attempt of subjects such as T’Gatoi and Gan to develop a partnership out of a very non-normative relationship. Gan becomes a member of a new coalition of subjects who want to move past the abomination of cross-species coupling, subverting the dominant/submissive dynamic by holding both T’Gatoi and himself responsible, and insisting on making his own choices. The risk each partner accepts in order to reach what Octavia Butler calls “an unusual accommodation” marks the relationship as queer (32); it challenges “regimes of the normal”(Warner xxvi)—both our own and in the text. The “risk” also lies in the pursuit of the unknown, born in the Terrans’ choice to seek another world. The notion that human beings, in their quest to explore the frontier of space and create new possibilities of freedom and proliferation, might end up in such an inverted and subversive sex/gender system queers not only our notions of sex and gender, of family and power, but also queers the very impulse to seek these new worlds where anything is possible. The queering of the exploration narrative is even more pronounced in James Tiptree, Jr.’s,“With Delicate Mad Hands.” Here, a female crew member on a spaceship battles misogyny to become the highest ranking female “spacer” and fulfill her lifelong calling to explore the frontier of outer space. CP, short for Carol Page and also for “Cold Pig,” the nickname her male crewmates give her because of her appearance, propels herself through school and space training, excelling at every subject and filling all the requirements of female spacers, which in this future includes learning “the twenty-seven basic sexual stimulations” and undergoing sterilization so that she can provide the vital task of sexually satisfying the male crew members without emotional complications (a task for which “she could not quite successfully simulate real desire”—hence the “cold” in Cold Pig [220]). While CP becomes an asset to any crew because of her hard work, her quiet and uncomplaining demeanor, and her expert </page> <page sequence="13"> 274 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) knowledge and precision, she is more highly “valued” as a “human waste can” (220).  One of very few women to earn her certification to fly solo, CP manages to function in a sexist society on a day-to-day basis; intent on pursuing her career, she withstands the treatment with little complaint until the day that the captain, exclaiming, “No cunt is going to fly [a shuttle] off my ship while I’m breathing” (221), punishes her ambition by raping her. In retaliation for the rape, CP murders the captain and a crew member, hijacking the spaceship and setting course to leave the solar system: “Out was all she craved ... outward at greatest acceleration from Sol and all the world of men—out free, in freedom dying.... Never to be pursued, touched, known of, by man or humanity” (234). In this declaration, CP associates being “touched” and pursued with humanity and “the world of men” so, after a lifetime of discrimination and violence caused by her sex and her body, CP liberates her body and mind, even as she spirals into insanity and certain death. Her escape from violent sexism seems to lie only in death or the rejection of the world she knows. In No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive (2004), Lee Edelman argues that queerness represents “resistance to the viability of the social” and a negation of a politics of the future always invested in heterosexual reproduction (3). In the social order, he says, hope for the future is crystallized in the symbol of the child and the drive to sustain life; “queerness, by contrast, figures, outside and beyond its political symptoms, [in] the place of the social order’s death drive.... Queerness attains its ethical value precisely insofar as it accedes to that place” (3). Edelman advocates for an alternative politics of the future, one that “refuse[s] the insistence of hope itself as affirmation, which is always affirmation of an order whose refusal will register as unthinkable, irresponsible, inhumane” (4). This resistance ultimately queers heternormative utopian impulses such as reproduction and the avoidance of death. Edelman’s formulation suggests how CP’s narrative can be read as queer.13  As the story develops, CP is described as increasingly abject and insane, with voices “reeling endlessly inside her head,” culminating in the moment when, “quite insane now,” she mercilessly kills the crew and embraces her own certain death when the air supply inevitably runs out. As she drifts into space, she thinks, “She was headed for the Empire. Whose name, she knew quite rationally, was Death” (229). Until this point, the story seems simply to be about a woman rebelling against her sex/gender system, escaping into the unknown, not of space, but of death. For CP, the comfort of killing and death, of an unknown future with no hope of survival or reproduction, leads to happiness and return to sanity. Her determined escape from the “world of men,” her voluntary sterilization, the peace she experiences from handling technology—a male occupation in her culture—while floating into oblivion: all this contributes to the queering of her choice and her construction as a figure who appears far more anti-utopian than utopian, refusing her own futurity in order to reject the status quo. The story shifts in an interesting way, however, once CP has made her escape, illuminating both the trope of exploration and the desires that propel it. </page> <page sequence="14"> ALIEN BODIES AND A QUEER FUTURE 275 As she journeys into the unknown, CP reflects on the source of her desire to explore space, the voice in her head that she tries to diagnose either as a projection “of my own pleasure back at myself” or as a sign of her mental instability (239). As we learn more about this voice, CP becomes more sympathetic. She remembers first hearing the voice as a child, while she lies in bed the evening after learning about the stars. As she fantasizes about worlds among the stars, “a star or something said very, very faintly but clearly, ‘Yes’” (235). Later, the voice urges her, more strongly, “‘Come’” (235). CP imagines a home world, her place of origin, nestled among the stars; she imagines her people more highly evolved, with “a somewhat shadowy physical form—though always entirely real ... they ceased to be of two sexes” (235). Disgusted with the physicality and brutality of humans, especially males, CP conjures an alien embodiment of utopia that manifests itself as a shadowy, un-gendered representation of her own desires. Though CP believes her actions will lead only to her demise, her desire, no longer limited to escaping the world of men through death, also includes a utopian wish for community and acceptance. CP’s desire thus complicates Edelman’s discussion of the death drive; by mingling a fantasy of the future with actions that she knows will lead to her death, CP combines  utopian and anti-utopian elements to suggest something altogether different—a queer utopian wish.  In an interesting counter-argument to Edelman, Muñoz, in Cruising Utopia, calls for an “anti-anti-utopianism” in queer theory. He believes a queer utopian hermeneutic would be: epistemologically and ontologically humble in that it would not claim the epistemological certitude of a queerness that we simply “know,” but, instead, strain to activate the no-longer-conscious and to extend a glance toward that which is forward dawning, anticipatory illuminations of the not-yet-conscious. (28; emphasis in original)  The concept of queerness is neither stable nor definite—like utopia, queer is a state of being that we have not yet attained and so cannot fully imagine, understand, or define. In its “idealist trajectory” (Muñoz 28), queer futurity does not have to mean death. CP’s journey literally embodies this trajectory: she leaves behind a stagnant, sexist world in order to pursue the shadowy unknown of utopia. CP’s voice, however, actually exists; a society of aliens on a distant planet has been reaching across the universe, summoning her telepathically to teach them about the worlds they cannot explore. CP’s utopian visions of body and spirit are real. These aliens, who look like animals such as birds, tortoises, and kangaroos, rely more on mental communication such as telepathy and telekinesis than on verbal communication, and they choose their own genders when they mature. Though there seem to be separate races of aliens, CP never notes any tension either among the races or between them and herself. As in “Bloodchild,” the aliens display a Chimera-like collection of human and animal characteristics, but they are not described as monstrous or repulsive; instead, their familiar appearance provides comfort and their anthropomorphic traits suggest what CP calls “a vague feeling of all-rightness” (251). Her </page> <page sequence="15"> 276 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) communication with the aliens via mental images and sensations, rather than through the sneers and shoves to which she is accustomed, enhances her ease. The system of language and bodily identity of the inhabitants of the planet Auln provide a stark contrast with the brutal and violent sex/gender system of her former world. She rejoices when she realizes that “to these people her body was as neutral as a mollusk or a map,” divested of sexual or gendered meaning in this new environment (255). Viewing one alien body without clothing,  CP was amazed—in the crotch where human sex and excretory organs would be, the alien had nothing but smooth muscle. But its chest region was as complex as a group of sea creatures; valves, lips, unidentifiable moist flaps and protrusions.... CP could form no idea of its gender, if any. (255)  CP never learns that the aliens choose their own gender—a fact that is revealed after she has died. She does understand, however, that sex and gender, for these aliens, carry far less social importance than intellect, communication, and spirituality; for her, their incomprehensible bodies manifest these values.  CP achieves her utopian wish when she recognizes one of the aliens as the source of the voice. She at first identifies with Cavaná because of the alien’s resemblance to a pig: large, triangular earflaps and a pugged nose. They recognize in each other “the love of all that is alien. Of the stars” (274). CP and Cavaná not only share pig-like facial features and dreams of exploration, but they also share the experience of existing outside a cultural aesthetic; Cavaná’s ears are “viewed as deplorable” on Auln, where long, upright ears are the norm (270). Eventually, Cavaná reveals to CP that she has been “Calling” her through space as part of the culture’s attempts to learn more about alien worlds and space technology. Together, CP and Cavaná realize their “lifelong love” for one another: “she—Carol-Page-Snotface-CP-Cold-Pig—had walked all her days and nights embraced by love. Alien love, at first for a little-alien-among-the-stars, but soon, soon for her alone. She had never been alone” (268). Though her soul mate is an alien, of no recognizable gender, their shared cultural experience and utopian wish draw CP across the expanse of space in order to fulfill a desire she never knew she had. Unlike the human/alien intimacy in “Bloodchild,” the love of the Other in Tiptree’s story is the love of a reassuring complement to the self, a mirroring of experience and hope. The story thus overturns the usual alien-as- monster narrative of space exploration and instead renders abject normative constructions of power and desire. Though the two lovers are “[im]prisoned in wholly different bodies with wholly different needs,” CP finally understands physical desire and sexual fulfillment: “where love has been intense and silent and all-consuming, only the impossible, the total merger into one, could slake its fires” (270). There are obstacles, however: the planet is extremely radioactive, “ a paradise, but not for her” (246). Her exit from the spaceship is both a literal and a metaphorical coming out: “It was time to come out—to him” (269). CP uses the male pronoun in her mind to describe her lover partly as a symptom of the compulsory heterosexuality of Earth and partly for lack of a more appropriate term. In fact, gender and its accompanying identity politics have been removed </page> <page sequence="16"> ALIEN BODIES AND A QUEER FUTURE 277 from the relationship altogether—as, seemingly, has race. CP reflects, “there were now no other ‘hes’ in [her] universe,” indicating both her newfound monogamous love as well as her rejection of the heteronormative sex/gender system of her own planet, or of any other (268). Cavaná’s gender identity as a female only becomes known through a conversation by two aliens after her death, when they reflect that she “had only just chosen gender when she made Contact” with CP, a further indication of their bond. For the two lovers, the only system of love that exists is the one they share. Their choice to be together recalls Edelman’s argument regarding queer desire and the death drive. CP realizes that Cavaná “led her out, to a different end” (269). The alien gravely acknowledges and shares CP’s choice to die; they die together, one of radiation and the other of a broken heart. Together, they find a “different end” for their love—one that does not necessarily signal a negation of hope, but rather a celebration of shared experience. Critics argue that Tiptree “dooms society to sexism” because she depicts humanity as monolithically patriarchal and misogynist (Genova 8). Veronica Hollinger calls Tiptree’s stories “modern tragedies of gender difference” (306), narratives that cannot find a way around gender oppression and so instead find a way out—whether by space travel or death.14 While Tiptree favors an anti- utopian view of humanity and its sex/gender systems, the manifestations of violence and power in Tiptree’s worlds “are neither entirely masculine nor entirely negative phenomena,” as Lewis Call points out. Rather, such manifestations not only critique patriarchy and heternormativity, but also articulate “erotic power” suggesting feminist possibility (61). By queering particular ideologies—in this case the imperial fantasies of space exploration—Tiptree proposes alternative methods of seeking utopia, even and especially if it means rejecting and transcending old ideologies. CP’s journey, initiated in her choice to leave behind “the world of men,” represents an exploration of an alternative future—a queer future. Though this future embraces death, it also demonstrates an “idealist trajectory,” a risk-filled journey to discover alternative logics of kinship, desire, and communication. CP’s anti- utopianism is turned on its head, marking as utopian the very journey that propels the female spacer to seek out queer new worlds and possibilities, rejecting patriarchy and embracing a life free of gendered meaning or power. In this way, Tiptree, like Butler, subverts the trope of space as the final frontier so that the desire to explore space becomes not a story of conquest and domination, physicality and brutality, but an appreciation of the unexpected: of differently organized cultural systems, of non-normative relationships across various kinds of boundaries, including race and species, and of accepting the risk of failure and death while using intellectual, spiritual, and sexual strengths to discover the universe and its endless queer utopian possibilities.  Conclusion. When Jameson identifies the move to “perversion” in representations of the alien body as the “waning of the Utopian imagination,” he overlooks an essential point: that issues of class and social structure—what he believes to be the more productive fuel for Utopia—are inextricably bound </page> <page sequence="17"> 278 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) up with issues of gender, sexuality, and race. The defamiliarizing of gender, the body, and sexual identities in science fiction of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century opens up an examination of the ways gender, labor, imperialism, and sexuality intersect with and are informed by heteronormative systems. Utopianism has not waned as it explores the alien body, but has instead become more complicated and contested—a “zone of possibilities” (Hollinger 312) that accommodates the needs of changing ideologies, theories, and fantasies. Butler and Tiptree, by imagining aliens who inhabit very different systems of desire and embodiment, suggest that one of the benefits, even motivations, of space exploration is to discover and befriend beings who have entirely new concepts of gender and sexuality, of intimacy and reproduction. Whether writers of queer science fiction mirror or undermine our own systems, or whether they propose entirely new and terrifying systems, they use the alien body and the far future to explore the possibilities of freedom from compulsory heterosexuality and patriarchy, and to imagine a world in which desire is fulfilled in an endless proliferation of choices and intimacies.  NOTES 1. For a clear and overarching definition of utopia, I look to Lyman Tower Sargent, who uses “utopia” as a more general term for “a non-existent society described in considerable detail and normally located in time and space” (9). Sargent distinguishes among the various types of utopias, such as “positive utopia or eutopia,” dystopia, and anti-utopia, but uses the more straightforward term to name the entire genre. 2. Like most scholars, queer and otherwise, I struggle to offer a clear and stable definition of queer—if only because the term itself resists clarity and stability. Perhaps Warner offers the most apt explanation—the one I believe to be the closest to my own relationship to the term—in the introduction to Fear of a Queer Planet (1993). As he explains, “the preference for ‘queer’ represents, among other things, an aggressive impulse of generalization; it rejects a minoritizing logic of toleration or simple political interest-representation in favor of a more thorough resistance to regimes of the normal” (xxvi).  3. Hollinger’s and Pearson’s essays appeared together in a 1999 special issue of Science Fiction Studies examining science fiction and queer theory.  4. As I consider what it means to “liv[e] in the world as a sexual/ized object,” I am thinking about Patricia Hill Collins’s notion of an “intersectionality of oppressions” (Pearson, Hollinger, and Gordon 6; Collins 12). Collins writes: “Sexuality can be viewed as an entity that is manipulated within each distinctive system of race, class, and gender oppression.... Sexuality also can be seen as a site of intersectionality, a specific constellation of social practices that demonstrates how oppressions converge” (12). As I write about systems of gender and sexual oppression, I assume that these identities are sites of intersectionality, in which race, power, nationality, and even species merge and inform one another. 5. In the past two decades, several queer scholars have positioned themselves as anti- utopian. Lee Edleman in No Future (2004) argues that a politics of the future relies on the symbol of the child or on heterosexual reproductivity, and that which is “queer” is seen as resistance to this at all levels. As a mode of queer politics, he recommends that queer individuals relinquish hope and utopian desires as not made for them, instead embracing negation and the death drive and thus a certain jouissance. His argument </page> <page sequence="18"> ALIEN BODIES AND A QUEER FUTURE 279 follows a turn initiated by Leo Bersani, who articulates a theory of anti-relationality in Homos (1995). In Cruising Utopia (2009), by contrast, José Muñoz positions himself against anti-utopian or anti-relationality queer theorists, particularly Edelman and Bersani, arguing that “queerness is always in the horizon” (Muñoz 11), placing desire in the realm of the future and its possibility. He writes: an antiutopian might understand himself as being critical in rejecting hope, but in the rush to denounce it, he would be missing the point that hope is spawned of a critical investment in utopia, which is nothing like naïve but, instead, profoundly resistant to the stultifying temporal logic of a broken-down present.... Antiutopianism in queer studies ... has led many scholars to an impasse wherein they cannot see futurity for the life of them. (Muñoz 12) As an alternative, Muñoz proposes anti-antiutopianism (a phrase he borrows from Jameson), challenging readers and queer scholars to reconsider hope and utopia from the direction of a “renewed and newly animated sense of the social” (Muñoz 18). Though I use portions of Edelman’s compelling theory, I enter the conversation alongside Muñoz’s text, as well as Judith Halberstam’s In a Queer Time and Place (2005; a text with which Muñoz also aligns himself), which conceptualizes queer time and queer space that develop in opposition to reproductive and heteronormative “logics of location, movement, and identification” (Halberstam 1). Though not specifically articulating a stance either for or against utopia, Halberstam’s notions of queer time and space acknowledge the risk and hope at work in the lives of queer subjects who insist on living for the future despite their symbolic negation of heteronormative formulations of family, temporality, and choice. 6. See the following, which all identify imperialism as the origin of many science- fiction tropes: Kerslake’s Science Fiction and Empire (2007), Rieder’s Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction (2008), and Seed’s “The Course of Empire” (2010). Each author examines the ideology of empire inherent in the exploration of new territories, the claiming of land, the treatment of alien races, the fear of invasion, and notions of progress both social and technological. 7. To Grewell’s categories I would add a fourth—the so-called “going native” narrative that concerns the growing empathy and identification of the imperialist with the colonial subject. Recent examples include the films Dances with Wolves (1990) and Avatar (2009). While this narrative often aims to undermine or critique an imperial agenda, it has become a trope of imperial literature that is echoed in the science-fiction genre, where the image of the native/alien crystallizes into an undifferentiated symbol of purity amid social corruption, effectively stripping it of the subjectivity the narrative pretends to assert. 8. Elyce Rae Helford is among the critics who read “Bloodchild” as a comment on the master/slave relationship, despite Butler’s suggestion that it is not. See also Thelma Shinn Richard, who compares the story to Kindred (1979), insisting that “Butler recognizes that our survival often depends upon our oppressors. How can any product of our imperialistic, patriarchal history deny this continuing truth?” (121).  9. These three stories are usually used to support the argument that Tiptree takes a  very pessimistic view of biologically-determined systems of power in our culture, representing them as relentlessly binding. In all three stories, the women thrive without men, choosing to move into space or the future in order to free themselves from heteronormativity and patriarchy. Though I agree with this reading, I also agree with David Galef, who notes that Tiptree “explores [her] material through a mix of sociobiological and postcolonialist awareness that situates her uneasily between these two conflicting fields” (202), and with Sarah Lefanu, who writes that “Tiptree’s feminism </page> <page sequence="19"> 280 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) does not constitute a simple unified vision” (29). In other words, within Tiptree’s rich and compelling body of work it is problematic to identify one particular argument or perspective. Any hint of optimism or utopian potential must be read in the ways that she challenges imperialism, patriarchy, and genre convention, so that what was once assumed to be the work of a male author can be revealed to be women’s writing and what was once thought to be strictly pessimistic can be revealed to have layers of possibility. 10. In a reading of “Bloodchild” that helped me to articulate my own, Raffaella Baccolini identifies Gan’s choice to enter into the relationship with T’Gatoi and his insistence on maintaining his right of choice and the “risk” of partnership as an “ethics of compromise.” She argues:  Through the request for knowledge and awareness, the acceptance of responsibility and accountability, but also the recognition of compromise and negotiation, Gan is able to break through the hegemonic power of the Tlic and open up the possibility of change.... Knowledge allows Gan to move from an individual accommodation to a potentially collective action, since—traditionally both in dystopian and post-colonial discourses—it is intrinsically linked with empowerment, hope, and change. (303-304 I agree with Baccolini that “the concern to show strategies of resistance to our cultural constructions is central to Butler’s story” and that “negotiation together with knowledge, awareness, and responsibility provide the necessary elements for resistance” to heteronormative constructions (301, 304). 11. Helford is not alone in her critique of Butler’s frequent use of biological essentialism in the construction of her characters. In “‘The More Things Change, the More They Remain the Same’,” Sharon DeGraw points out that Butler’s feminism is somewhat undermined by her tendency to assign her female characters traditional gender roles such as teacher, artist, and mother, particularly emphasizing the importance of motherhood to female identity. Although DeGraw’s purpose is to highlight the ways in which Butler’s utopianism transcends these perceived feminist shortcomings, her point—that feminist critics are troubled by the fact that Butler’s fictions seem to suggest that there is no way out of biological determinism—articulates a common problem that feminist critics of Butler’s oeuvre have difficulty in resolving. 12. Certainly, the relationship between T’Gatoi and Gan is a horrific and exaggerated parody of patriarchy. I read the scene alongside critics such as Brigitte Scheer-Schälzer and Laurel Bollinger, who place importance on the moment of choice and the intimacy between the two characters. In examining the implications of maternity and birth in the story, Bollinger argues for a “placental economy” as a “mediating force” in the story, explaining:  By emphasizing the need for full disclosure and informed consent, Butler [demonstrates that] only a choice made with full awareness of its cost can be understood as a genuine choice of connectedness, with the alterity of both figures preserved. Despite their fundamental inequality, Gan and T’Gatoi allow each other the space to consent to symbiosis, and ... that consent is the mediating force that protects both characters. (335) 13. In “Queer Theory, Science Fiction, and the Dreamed-for Child” (2002), Joe Sutcliffe Sanders reads science fiction through queer theory and “the image of the child” most clearly theorized by Edelman. Like Sanders, I am quite interested in how Edelman’s theories about the teleology of the child and its status as representation of hope and futurity can be read and subverted by queer theory in the context of dystopia and utopia. Sanders specifically analyzes what he identifies as “queer science fiction” (whereas I analyze science fiction through a queer lens) to argue that it “has tremendous potential for cultural work in general” and “promises a radically new way of writing the </page> <page sequence="20"> ALIEN BODIES AND A QUEER FUTURE 281 fictional child” (99). Although our arguments, approaches, and choices of texts differ I acknowledge Sanders for articulating and demonstrating an argument that I also find fascinating and attempt to tackle throughout my research. 14. Several critics offer arguments similar to Hollinger’s, including Lillian Heldreth, who argues that “Tiptree seems to see no hope for feminist equality, no release from the bondage of violent sex, and no hope for the human race,” at least, “not on this world” (28). I position my argument more in line with that of Judith Genova, who argues that “Tiptree exerts herself to mislead her readers,” tricking us by veiling her more hopeful sentiments with her anti-utopianism (8).

ABSTRACT In this essay, I employ recent queer theory and queer science-fiction criticism to argue that the alien body can be used to represent utopian ideals of queerness and to challenge heteronormativity and its related systems of power. I discuss the short stories “Bloodchild” by Octavia E. Butler and “With Delicate Mad Hands” by James Tiptree, Jr., as two texts that imagine alternate worlds and intimacies in order to critique sex/gender systems in various ways. I argue that these texts queer the alien body and the alien/human relationship, and by doing so also queer the very impulse for space exploration. The generic conventions of space exploration—layered by race, imperialism, and desire—are subverted by these authors to reveal instead a utopian desire for queer futurity. </page> </plain_text>
