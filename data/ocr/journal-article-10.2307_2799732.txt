<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO PREHISPANIC CIRE PERDUE CASTING MOULDS FROM COLOMBIA KAREN OLSEN BRUHNS San Jose State College, Califorwia The development of metallurgy in the ancient New World is of considerable interest to students of culture history since the processes of invention and diffusion of these complex techniques appear to have been entirely separate from similar events in Eurasia. Until very recently studies of American metal technology have had to be limited to examinations of ancient artefacts, often lacking any precise temporal or geographic provenance, coupled with data from the scanty accounts of the early Spanish chroniclers concerning the methods in use at the time of the Conquest. This has yielded a fair amount of information in general terms of basic technology such as hammering, gilding, casting, etc. Little is known, however, of the tools used in ancient times because of the incompleteness of both the archaeological and the historical record. Lack of scientific exploration of ancient sites in what appears to have been the core area of ancient South American metallurgy (there being general agreement that metallurgical techniques were invented in South America, diffiusing to Mesoamerica only in the late prehistoric period) has contributed to the general paucity of data. Most 'excavation' in Ecuador and Colombia, the area which saw the highest development of prehis- panic metallurgy, has been done byguaqueros, professional tomb looters searching for precious metal for its bullion value. Although the guaqueros collect ceramic and other remains which are saleable on the clandestine antiquities market, they have little interest in recovering tools and objects which have a low aesthetic value. Colombia and Ecuador are also unfortunately the areas for which we have the least early historical information on ancient technology. For this reason, any finds of tools or other artefacts associated with metal-working from these areas assume an importance far beyond mere curiosity value. During the summer of I970, while directing a programme of archaeological reconnaissance and excavation in the Department of Quindio in the Cordillera Central of Colombia, I had the opportunity to examine the collection of an amateur local archaeologist. This collection contained two ceramic objects which proved to be moulds for the lost wax casting of small ornaments (see pls 2-3). To my knowledge these are the first such moulds of undoubted precolumbian manu- facture to have been found in the New World. It has long been known that lost wax (cire perdue) casting of copper, gold and copper-gold alloys was an extremely important technique in early American metallurgy. In cire perdue casting a model of wax is made of the desired object. Clay is then pressed around the model, leaving a vent at the top to pour in the metal. A small hole or holes are generally put in the bottom for air to escape when the metal is introduced. The model and its clay cover are then fired, burning out the</page><page sequence="2">MAN, JUNE I972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 309 wax and leaving a hollow in the shape of the object to be cast. Molten metal is then poured into the mould; when this is hardened the mould is broken away leaving the metal product. This may then be subjected to some superficial finishing process-such as burnishing or filing to even out and polish the surface. The fact that this method of casting necessitates the destruction of the mould to extract the metal object is probably the reason why none had previously been found. Intensive excavation of habitation and workshop sites, which alone would uncover the broken bits of moulds, has been virtually nonexistent in the areas where there was the most developed metallurgy. The only deliberate professional excavation of a supposed metal workshop site has been carried out in northern Peru at the Late Intermediate Period city of Chan Chan. Excavations here have not yet uncovered any remains of moulds (M. E. Moseley, personal communication). Excavation in the northern Andes has been mainly limited to either ceremonial, rather than living sites, or to sites of the palaeoindian and archaic periods, where it would be too early to expect traces of even incipient metallurgy. Thus, for the moment, these two moulds from central Colombia constitute the only evidence of the cire perdue casting technique in this area apart, of course, from the metal artefacts themselves. * * * * * The moulds were found in a shaft and chamber tomb (the common precolum- bian type in this area) in the vereda of Pueblo Tapado in the municipio of Monte- negro, Department of Quindio. The cemeteries of this region are famous locally for the wealth of metal objects which they contain and it is very likely that this was a centre for the production of metal artefacts which were then traded through- out central Colombia. The tomb was opened by a guaquero. He removed one mould (the whole one) from the tomb and subsequently sold it to the man in whose collection it remains. This man, recognising what the object was, later visited the site himself and extracted from it another, broken, mould. The only other object known to have come from this tomb is a crude, undecorated olla. The two moulds were never used, the broken one apparently having been damaged by the tomb looter. The interment of artefacts of various sorts, including tools and weapons, was a common funerary practice among the precolumbian Indians of this region. It is tempting to think that this was the tomb of the metal- lurgist who made the moulds but who then died before he could use them. Both moulds are in the form of a flattened flask. The whole mould is not damaged at all, the other, larger one is freshly broken at the top where a thin neck and wide flaring lip were attached to facilitate the pouring in of the molten metal. A few fragments are missing from this mould; but there is no reason to doubt that the top pertains to the body rather than the pieces being the remains of two separate moulds. The clay of the moulds is the common ceramic paste of this area, an orangeish tan clay with a fairly heavy temper of fine sand. They were fired in an oxidising atmosphere, a few reduced patches showing where they were in contact with either the ground or another ceramic object while being fired. Both were obviously constructed by flattening two small balls of clay and pressing these around either side of the wax model, the seams being pinched together. A narrow neck of clay was added at the top of the mould, and a flaring rim made of a flattened coil attached to this. A small hole was pierced in the bottom of the</page><page sequence="3">310 MAN, JUNE 1972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 mould to allow the air to escape when introducing the metal, thus avoiding the formation of a bubble which would mar the cast piece. Finger-marks are visible on the surfaces of the moulds and no attempt was made to smooth or finish the exterior since the moulds would have been broken when the casting was finished. The whole mould measures 8 cm in height, by 5.3 cm at its widest point. The diameter of the flaring rim is 5-8 cm. The broken mould is some 9.3 cm from the unbroken shoulder to the pointed bottom. The width is 8 ' I cm. The top is 5 5 cm high with the diameter of the lip being 6'2 cm. Only a few small fragments seemn to be missing and the mould when whole was probably no more than i5 cm in height. A small portion of the design hollow shows where the shoulder is broken. This consists of a series of small parallel ridges and it is not possible to tell what the intended piece would have looked like from the portion of the design visible. Since the pieces remain in the possession of the private collector, it has not been possible to have any experiments conducted to try to discover what type of pieces were intended. From the size and shape of the moulds, however, it seems likely that small ornaments were to be produced. Small figures representing human or supernatural beings are quite common finds in the precolumbian tombs of the Quindfo. These occur in a variety of styles and, as yet, none has been correlated with any of the other ancient remains of the area. Therefore, even if it were possible to find out what the pieces were to be this would not help in dating them or in dis- covering their cultural affiiation. The one vessel from the tomb is an undecorated olla of a type usually used for culinary purposes. This type of olla is found in the tombs of several of the prehispanic cultures of central Colombia and is not diagnostic of any one culture in particular. It could have been used in metallurgy, perhaps as a crucible, but as it too bears no signs of use there is no way of knowing. There is, however, one indirect line of evidence which may help to date these moulds. I examined many ceramic vessels said to have come from the same cemetery or from cemeteries in the immediate vicinity. Most of these ceramic objects pertain to either of two related cultures of the Middle Cauca drainage. Of these the great majority are of a style which has hitherto been called Quimbaya, but which we are now calling Middle Cauca. These ceramics are found throughout the Cordillera Central in the departments of Quindfo, Riseralda, Caldas, and the northern part of Valle. The distribution of this ceramic style is thus much greater than the territory known to have been inhabited by the historic Quimbaya tribe. These ceramics are typified by resist (negative) painting in designs of dotted triangles, straight lines and other simple geometric motifs on a background of polished red and white slip. Diagnostic forms include a number of amphora shapes, footed cups, hemi- spherical bowls, and a series of distinctive anthropomorphic figurines depicting naked humans seated on benches or cross-legged on the ground. This style seems to have some time depth in the area and there are a number of regional and temporal styles (Bruhns I967). One of these latter, from the northern part of the Department of Valle, has been radiocarbon-dated to II75 ? 70 A.D. (Bray &amp; Moseley I97I). There are some other radiocarbon dates from more southerly manifestations of the style which indicate a total span of existence beginning about 900 A.D. and con- tinuing until about 1200 A.D. (W. Bray, personal communication). The only other type of ceramics represented in any numbers in the Pueblo Tapado cemeteries are of a style also loosely called Quimbaya. These also are resist painted, but in a quite</page><page sequence="4">MAN, JUNE I972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 311 different style on a solid red background. There is even more regional, and perhaps, temporal, variation in this style of pottery but one variant, again from northern Valle, has been radiocarbon-dated to about the time of the Spanish Conquest. Almost no ceramics of other styles seem to have been found in Pueblo Tapado so that the association of the moulds with either Middle Cauca style or 'Quimbaya' style ceramics is alnmost certain. The Quindio was almost totally depopulated soon after the Conquest period and only recolonised in the mid-nineteenth century. There is thus no doubt that these moulds are precolumbian in date. In any event, the chance finding and preservation of these two moulds has added considerably to our knowledge of the way in which the prehispanic metallurgist worked and of the tools he used.
