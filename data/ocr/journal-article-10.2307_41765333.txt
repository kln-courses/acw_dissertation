<plain_text><page sequence="1">Simone Brott Deleuze and "The Intercessors" The late French philosopher Gilles Deleuze has enjoyed sig- nificant notoriety and acclaim in American academia over the last 20 years. The unique disciplinary focus of the con- temporary discussion has derived from Deleuze the architec- tural possibilities of biotechnology, systems theory, and digital processualism. While the persistence of Deleuze's theory of science and the formalist readings of Mille Plateaux and Le Bergsonismex have dominated the reception since the 1990s, few are aware of a much earlier encounter between Deleuze and architects, beginning at Columbia University in the 1970s, which converged on the radical politics of Anti-Œdipus 2 and its American reception in the journal SemiotextÇe ), through which architecture engaged a much broader discourse along- side artists, musicians, filmmakers, and intellectuals in the New York aesthetic underground, of which Deleuze and Felix Guattari were themselves a part. This early reception of Deleuze's work was widespread, yet subterranean and imperceptible, as was typical of the 1970s anarchic-aesthetic bloc to which it first spread, and eventually attached itself to architecture. Through discussions with John Rajchman and Sylvère Lotringer, the founding editors of SemiotextÇe ), and Sanford Kwinter, an editor of Zone an oral history of the early Deleuze scene can be assembled, tracing the multiple trajectories, publications, and individuals that not only brought architecture into con- tact with Deleuzian ideas, but, as these stories demonstrate, provided Deleuze with an important entry point into the American academy.4 This, of course, is not to say the early American reception of Deleuze was exclusively architectural, or that there is something inherently architectural in Deleuze and Guattari^ ideas.5 The immediate question is: Why Deleuze and architec- ture - an institutional terrain par excellence, which is a principal target of Deleuze and Guattari's ethico-aesthetic polemic of the 1970s? Why did a discipline that valorizes its orthodoxy (its histories), its interiori ty (its putative autono- my), become simpatico with what is essentially an anarchic philosophy of subjectivization?6 What distinguishes the early architectural reception is precisely the disciplinary milieu - 1*5 1. Mille Plateaux (A Thousand Plateaus ), published in French in 1980, and first appearing in English in 1988, is the second volume in Capitalism and Schizophrenia , following on L' Anti-Œdipe (Anti-Œdipus) first published in 1972. Le Bergsonisme was first published by Presses Universitaires de France, Paris, in 1966. 2. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, Anti-Œdipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia , trans.

The American reception intersects with those in Italy, France, and Australia, and further, Tapan and Brazil. 5. An equally interesting account could be given of the reception of Bourdieu or any of Deleuze's contemporaries after 1968. 6. The methodological premise of my project is that Deleuze's radical thought speaks directly to, even provokes, archi- tecture's difficult relationship with sub- jectivity.</page><page sequence="2">namely, the '70s art scene by way of which architecture adopted Deleuze and Guattari. By historicizing the travails of Deleuze in America, mirrored in architecture's discipli- nary problematic, a retrospective of this order provides clues to the sympathies between architecture and Deleuze today.7 Italian Autonomia Mediators are fundamental. Creation's all about mediators. . . . Whether they're real or imaginary , animate or inanimate, you have to form your mediators. It's a series. If you're not in some series , even a completely imaginary one, you're lost. I need my mediators to express myself and they'd never express themselves without me: you're always working in a group, even when you seem to be on your own.s Deleuze entered architecture via what in Pourparlers he called the "mediators," the cult-assemblage of various char- acters who pursued their own activities around Deleuze. The question of the relationship between Deleuze and architec- ture is misleading because Deleuze had very little to do with architecture. He never appeared in architectural fora in the manner of his contemporary Jacques Derrida, whose person- al involvement in architecture since the 1980s is well known: Derrida's theory of deconstruction had its architectural ana- logue, he participated in two of the Anyone conferences in the early 1990s,9 and he was also a close friend of Bernard Tschumi and Peter Eisenman. Not so with Deleuze. John Rajchman: The lecture Félix gave when he came to New York was on singularizing space. It was at Columbia , an event sponsored by the architecture school. Deleuze did not travel. First of all there was his health, which then turned into a principle. He said he didn't travel. Derrida came here ; Deleuze, never.™ Deleuze wrote very little directly on architecture; there was Le Pli, the book on Leibniz and baroque architecture;11 Deleuze's instruction of Bernard Cache, and citation of Cache's book Earth Moves ;12 and the references to urbanism and space in Mille Plateaux - even if as the uneasy objects of Deleuze and Guattari's critique. Indeed, the longer affiliation between Deleuze and architecture arose neither by Deleuze's direct interest in architecture nor by architecture's immediate affection for Deleuze. It evolved through, to use Deleuze's term, les inter- cesseurs, the intercessors - those figures, events, and mobile connections that were accessories to Deleuze's involvement in architectural discussion. Deleuze said the intercessors "can be people - for a philosopher, artists or scientists . . . - but things too, even plants or animals."1* Deleuze's interceders 136 7. It is, therefore, the question: How does architecture's encounter with Deleuze and Guattari conjure a discipline that frames the reception project? 8.

Rajchman: It turns out that Deleuze and I both wrote Foucault books published around the same time. We had a mutual philosophical friend who came to me and said Deleuze likes jour Foucault book ; he wants to meet you and he wants to know what you're working on now. So I said, tell him that Fm thinking of writ- ing on him. Deleuze said ' " I don't like people who write about me, I don't like people who write sur. But in your case, as long as [in] writing about me you satisfy two criteria: one, that you are accurate; and two, that I will be unable to recognize myself in the result." Deleuze's debt to Foucault manifests itself in his citation of the Society of Control in "Les Intercesseurs," the theory of a "City- S tate" in Mille Plateaux ,14 the book Foucault ^ and in numerous interviews with Foucault discussing urbanism, space, and power. But more than any of these, Deleuze's Foucauldianism is embodied in Anti-Œdipus , a text that con- tributed to the broader Foucauldian debate on urbanism and subjectivity and in which Deleuze and Guattari gave voice to a suite of theorists, such as Henri Lefebvre, Jean-François Lyotard, and Lewis Mumford, who were also attempting to reformulate the problems of subjectivity, space, and the social. In his introduction to Anti-Œdipus , Foucault describes Deleuze and Guattari^ project as the "connection of desire to reality"; he says it is the concrete expression of subjectivity in urban form that possesses revolutionary force. Whereas Foucault is mainly concerned with the institutional subject, Anti-Œdipus extends this to the creative generation of sub- jectivity in concrete social and cultural forms.16 Deleuze's Foucauldianism also goes back to the Italian Autonomia movement surrounding Foucault and Antonio Negri, the Italian Marxist and Spinoza scholar. Autonomia was the underground theoretical and political movement of the Italian left in the 1970s, which attracted French post- structuralists, Marxist anarchists, as well as a miscellany of artists and writers, and which could be said not only to have provided Deleuze and Guattari an entry point to America, via the affiliation with Foucault, but to have produced its own singular Deleuzo-Guattarian autonomist following in Italy. The Italian Marxists had adopted Foucaulťs critique of the repressive functions of the city and his analysis of archi- tecture and power, and developed it further using Deleuze's 137 14.

It is this creative aspect of Deleuze's model that lent itself to the interdiscipli- nary experiments of the early reception in New York.</page><page sequence="4">model of the "body without organs," the decentralized polit- ical formation that replaces the city as state. The Foucauldian Autonomia emphasized the self-organizing power, or "autonomy," of everyday life practices, such as architecture and urbanism, in nonhierarchical structures, and adopted Deleuze and Guattari's thinking on the aesthetic, productive nature of desire.17 This Italian reception of Deleuze, via Foucault and Negri in the 1970s, was in turn populated by a group of Marxist architecture critics, Manfredo Tafuri,18 Massimo Cacciari,19 and Georges Teyssot,20 from the Venice School (JUAV), who, while not agreeing on the role of Deleuze and Guattari in architectural criticism, were responsible, at least by the 1980s, for bringing French poststructuralist thought to light in America via their own debates and translation activities.21 Rajchman: Negri was, in Italy, associated with Tafuri because the group around Tafuri, the Italians, had an important role in introducing French thought to architecture . Foucault and Georges Teyssot, who helped introduce Foucault, had a big impact intellectually and politically in Italy on a very specific source . All the work about micropolitics got translated. . . . I think in Foucault they found the model of politics that no one else was working on, and that got translated into an Italian politics. . . . Negri and Guattari founded Le CERFI, a research group focused on the topic of cities, and for one of their meetings they invited Foucault and Deleuze to speak on the subject of cities.11 Deleuze and Guattari are then intercessors, in their own right, in this longer Foucauldian trajectory, whose locus turns out to be the architectural debates in Italy. This Italian movement of the 1970s was in practice a fringe phenomenon, and the introduction of Deleuze into academic discourse was a difficult, even traumatic narrative. Publication was diffi- cult, as there was political resistance to Deleuzian thinking and conflicts of borders (personal, political, and geograph- ic), which all contributed to what Foucault would later anticipate as the "Deleuzian century."2* The intercessor is not simply a conduit for information, a silent mediator,24 but a political act or intervention, literally a "going-between." The intercessor does not install herself between two fixed points in order to bridge or conciliate, but plots her revenge against an already existing condition from which she flees. The intercessor's role is not one of mediation but what Deleuze calls the "line of flight" ( ligne de fuite^) she communicates only her own escape - fuite or "leak" should be understood as a loophole that allows one to create.25 Rajchman: Of course, Negri was arrested in Italy and then 138 17. See Sylvère Lotringer, Christian Marazzi, eds., Autonomia: Post-Political Politics (New York: Semiotext(e)/ Foreign Agents, 2007). The notions of productive desire and the "desiring machines" within Anti-Œdipus, which Foucault transported to the Italian Autonomia, cite Georges Bataille's think- ing in the 1930s, for whom desire is a form of human "consumption." Consumption, in turn, is something that has to be created; it is the "productions of consumptions." See Deleuze and Guattari, Anti-(Edipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia , 4. 18. Tafuri was opposed to the use of Deleuze in architectural criticism, which he feared would dissolve the boundaries of ideology: "We firmly believe it neces- sary 'not to make rhizomes' of those groups."

Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1994). 21. Tafuri connected to Deleuze through his Marxist framing of "form" in terms of social processes of production. However, Tafuri retains the constituted "subject" - the socius who is a product of material forces. 22. Le Centre d'Etudes, de Recherches et de Formation Institutionnelles (CERFI). CERFI was founded as early as 1967, imploding around 1987. Its middle years (circa 1976) included government spon- sored research on the question of "what is a city?"

Negri later returned to Italy, which involved his being imprisoned because he was in political exile in France. While Negri was received by Deleuze and the other French Spinoza scholars in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Deleuze and Guattari did not find an easy reception in France. Rajchman says that Mille Plateaux was received poorly. "The political climate had changed. Postmodernism was being ushered in; there was a different mood in France, politically, that made Mille Plateaux unacceptable. Deleuze thought it was his most radical book but it was seen as post- Marxist" - that is, still rooted in the post-'óS working through of Marx and Freud that postmodernism was attempting to leave behind. It was in the English-speaking world, particularly North America, that Deleuze found a warmer reception. Sylvere Lotringer remarks: In France, of course, with its long history of overcentralization and bureaucracy, Deleuze and Guattari' s theories were pure science fiction. But on the other side of the Atlantic, they were uncannily realistic : New York, as it moved toward the 1980s, was the labo- ratory of capital and a natural destination for the two theorists, even though they'd never set foot in the city.19 Sanford Kwinter: Sylvere is a very interesting character. It was said of him the minute he got tenure he started turning up to class in jeans and leather jackets and never taught another aca- demic "18th-century" seminar. *° Still, in the late } 70s the literary establishment in these Ivy League universities was still formally hostile to this stuff, including Foucault, who is the least wild. . . . As I used to see it, Columbia was the Foucauldian/Deleuzian school, and Yale and Johns Hopkins were Derridean. But because I was at Columbia I started to identify with it J1 Brian Massumi recalls that Yale initially rejected his dis- sertation, the English translation of Mille Plateaux, which was eventually published by Athlone, in 1988, as A Thousand Plateaus J1 According to Kwinter, "Derrida was just starting to teach at Yale but the French department started to become very Derridean, which is essentially why Massumi had such a rough time."** 139 25. This invokes the conception of the "subject" in Alain Badiou, Being and Event , trans. Oliver Feltham (London: Continuum, 2006). While Badiou attempts to grasp after the unnameable in the subject as "event," Deleuze drops the philosophical sujet entirely and proceeds from the new transcendental field - a quicksand from which the subject will never surface. Deleuze's terse response to Jean-Luc Nancy in Who Comes After the Subject? (1991) is that there is none. He repeats this in Logique du Sens , where there are only singularités. Deleuze's war on the "subject" proved to be highly problematic from the point of view of Western philosophy, hence Derrida, Lacan, and Badiou's various poststruc- turalist attempts to reconfigure the sub- ject. (For Derrida, the subject is also an event, or a spacing; for Lacan, the "sub- ject" is retained if only because the analysand must take responsibility for her subjectivity.) 26.

The East Coast academy remained pre- dominantly Derridean and rooted in lit- erary criticism. 30. The prevailing academic seminars, in Kwinter's account, were those on "Marquis de Sade, Blanchot, everything that was sort of fashionable." 31.

This is the environment I came to . I left Paris to come to New York . Okay, there's Sylvere and there's [Edward] Said and the work he's doing in the English department and there's October magazine *4 and especially what John Johnston did . This essentially turned into the great Deleuzian cauldron, and it was absolutely focused at Columbia in New York, and that's thanks to Sylvere. Lotringer and Rajchman published some of the earliest English translations of Deleuze and Guattari in SemiotextÇe X among them "Rhizome" and "Nomadology."^ Rajchman: Semiotext(e) had an important role in introduc- ing the ideas of Deleuze in a climate that was dominated by literary theory, and so it's not an accident that it happens in a French department. In the early issues . . . there was Mario Gandelsonas talking about semiotics and so forth. He was interested in Julia Kristeva and the idea of architecture as language. On the fringes ofthat there could be a Deleuzian thing. So, you had Yale domi- nated by Paul de Man and deconstructivism, while Sylvere wanted to introduce something else, which was Deleuze. The first issue of Semiotext(e) in the winter of 1974, titled Alternatives in Semiotics , included essays by Lotringer and Rajchman, Guattari, Kristeva, and Denis Hollier. By the fourth issue, the focus shifted away from semiotics to "schizo- analysis," Deleuze and Guattari's quarrel with psychoanalysis, and the Foucauldian polemic on state mechanisms of control and repressive subjectivities. The issues that ensued opened with the statement: " SemiotextÇe ) is the self-supporting, non- profit journal of a group analyzing the power mechanisms which produce and maintain the present divisions of knowl- edge." SemiotextÇey. Jnti-Œdipus^6 published the same year that Viking published the English translation of V Anti-Œdipe , featured essays by Lotringer, Lyotard, Artaud, Rajchman, Guattari, Deleuze, and Guy Hocquenghem. The next issue, Nietzsche's Return V was followed by Schizo- Culture ,*8 which included a dizzying array of authors: Kathy Acker, Lee Breuer, William Burroughs, John Cage, Deleuze, Richard Foreman, Foucault, John Giorno, Philip Glass, Lyotard, Robert Wilson, and others. Previous to this shift, in 1975, Lotringer hosted his now infamous "Schizo -Culture" conference at Columbia on schizophrenia and radical politics, whose many participants included R.D. Laing, Foucault, Guattari, Lyotard, Cage, Derrida, Rajchman, Deleuze, and William Burroughs. Kwinter: Now the conference that you asked me about - this was the year in which New York turned all of their schizos and 14-0 33. Kwinter continues, "It was unortho- dox to accept a translation. On the other hand, Massumi's translation is worth two PhDs. The groundwork he did, it is a masterpiece. He read almost all the source material. When you look at the footnotes, the foundations of Mille Plateaux ... I was aware of Massumi's problems, he used to call me up." 34-. October was founded by Rosalind Krauss and Annette Michelson in 1976 after both departed Artforum in 1974 •. The launch was in part sponsored by the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies.

Both "Rhizome" and "Nomadology" were published as small books prior to their appearance in A Thousand Plateaus (1988), the latter became the 12th "plateau." In "Politics," Deleuze proposes the post-Marxist posi- tion of using capitalism from within, rather than opposing it, by "redirecting the creativity and multiplicity of its flows."

Foucault got spat on and roughed up when he was here in New York . . . Sylvere invited all the schizos living in the streets to the conference. The Village Voice published something totally erro- neous saying, "Foucault is a KGB agent ." People came - it was a madhouse from what I understands In Sylvere's 200? statement in Artforum' The conference escalated into the last-gasp "counter cultural" event of the 1970s . . . . Activists, academics, feminists, and recon- structed Marxists argued for three days, sometimes violently. While ¡James ] Kove/4"0 was speaking, half the audience departed to listen to Foucault and Guattari ; [Ti- Grace] Atkinson chased Guattari from the podium.^ Exchanges between groups like the Ramones and radi- cals such as Foucault and Guattari most likely served to broaden the reach of what was otherwise (and elsewhere) - in France, for instance - a "cult." Deleuze's success in America was precisely an effect of such exposure to hybrid aesthetic blocs where the early Deleuzian underground emerged as a subculture and "not just an academic outfit."42 Kwinter: There was a cult thing. . . . Sylv er e Lotringer had a seminar in 1978. It was Deleuzo and post- Deleuzian, hut you knew it was a Columbia seminar. Everybody sat around a table. They would talk incomprehensibly for an hour and a quarter, then there would be this and that. They were crypto-Deleuzians.

We had dinner with him. ... A bunch of post-9 60s hippies hanging out. For Sylvere the whole thing has always been a big intellectual party, he never separated the two. . . . He would bring in pimps, whores, dominatrixes, and schizophren- ics to Columbia. . . . They were culturally and politically schizo- phrenic, inherently radicalized human beings, and they were brought to us.*6 Closing the decade and opening another, in 1980, SemiotextÇe ) published the first issue of its Intervention Series, Autonomia ,47 a late love letter to Negri that returned the Italian discussion to America.

The origin of the KGB rumor is apparently John Bell Young, "My Adventures As A Chat Room Hooligan: Confronting Hypocrisy And Snobbism In Classical Music" (1999). Young will neither deny nor confirm the statement in his online tale and refuses to be quoted without permission (which he will not grant). In essence, Young claims that the so-called Ontological Hysterical Theater (members of which attended the symposium) insisted Foucault admit par- ticipation in gruesome experiments car- ried out with the involvement of the CIA and French Government during the 1950s. These experiments allegedly involved psychological and physical tor- ture. Foucault replied, aptly: "It was not the CIA I worked for. It was the KGB." Paraphrase of John Bell Young. +0.

It was the most exciting thing, in a weird way, that had happened in literary studies. . . . Why ? Because it was a combination of French philosophy, American lit- erary aesthetics, and American art. I was writing for Art in America. In New York City in the '$0s, '60s, and absolutely in the '70s, right into the y 80s, you could not be an intellectual without engaging art. It's hard to imagine from today's perspective, but art was radical, profound, and seri- ous. It was also extremely organized and coherent in the sense you could discuss historical movements in a scientific way. Art was a form of political, historical research ; it wasn't just like doing any- thing. Today you do whatever you want, who cares ? It's amusing, you can put it in a gallery, someone will try and sell it for you. It was one of the best ways also, for me, for taking this philosophy that I had learned in France, and finding an incredibly adequate venue for developing the concepts. I didn't want to be part of a sort of arcane literary avant-garde. Nobody in America had read the new ideas, yet the European ideas of the late '50s through the ' 70s and the new art in America - minimalism, postminimalism, and all the stuff that ensued from that - in my mind, can only be understood from using the new body of concepts. The importance of Zone for architecture lies, of course, in its thematization of the city in the first issue, Zone 1/2: The Contemporary City.**1 Rajchman explains the architectural dimension of the Zone discussion as an interest in urbanism via the art historians in the editorial group: "First, Jonathan Crary was interested in cities - his own research - a tradition of art history which was always interested in the city, so that's a part of Zone ." 14-2 48.

Sylvere had his students, the people that would found Zone , including Jonathan Crary, Sanford Kwinter, and Michel Feher, who had studied with Deleuze, and wanted to found this new kind of publishing proj- ect. I was an editor of Zone for a day, they say, because I went to the initial meeting, but since I'd already done SemiotextÇe ) I thought it would be more interesting for them to do it rather than me." 51.

Sanford Kwinter, Jonathan Crary, and Michel Feher, eds., Zone 1/2: The Contemporary City (1987).</page><page sequence="9">This first issue included Virilio's "The Overexposed City," followed by contributions from the Zone team: Eric Alliez and Feher's "Notes on the Sophisticated City"; Kwinter, Crary, and De Landa; Deleuze and Guattari's "City-State" (reprinted in A Thousand Plateaus)', and, sur- prisingly, Christopher Alexander's "A City is Not A Tree."5* The back of Zone 1/2 included statements by architects and theorists - Kenneth Frampton, Eisenman, Richard Serra, Daniel Libeskind, Rem Koolhaas, Krysztof Wodiczko, and Herbert Muschamp.54 Zone 1/2 set a clear agenda: to define a political regime of the city. The urban model implicit in these essays is Deleuze and Guattari's reformulation of capital and their vision for a decentralized subjectivity, or "rhizome," but here concretized into specific questions of how the shifts in urban, economic, and social realities after 1968 reformulate the city vis-à-vis the neoliberal economy of the mid 1980s.55 This attempt to rework the previous discussion brings about an important modification of the thinking of the city - specifically, it suggests an urban subjectivity as opposed to the personalized explorations of sex, gender, and psycho- analysis in SemiotextÇe). In the words of Kwinter and Feher's foreword, Zone 1/2 aimed "to trace a genealogy of the city and to develop analytic models based on its power to affect." Deleuze's use of I'affect/affectus via Spinoza inflects the con- cept of the city here, not only as something to be passively inhabited by "subjects," but as a powerful entity in its own right - an anonymous production that hovers above its inhabitants and buildings.56 Zone marked a shift away from psychoanalysis and the question of subjectivity per se. Rajchman: The Zone people, for me, didn't think the problem of psychoanalysis was very important. They were very fascinated by science and the biophysical dimension of Deleuze. It's not wrong or uninteresting, only Guattari was involved as an actual therapist. Sylvere was much more involved with the kind of battle between Deleuze and other figures like Derrida or Lacan. . . . But for this younger, or second, generation . . . that's just not a struggle they were interested in. They weren't Derrido-textualists, they weren't [ Freudians ], and yet they wanted to have some kind of theory and were interested in the larger problems of space and time. . . . A focus on scientists and techno-scientists is what they found interesting in Deleuze. Rhizome Kwinter: " Rhizome " came out in French around 1977, published by Minuit, the normal publisher of Deleuze. I had the book. I was 143 53. Alexander's prize-winning 1965 essay argues that a city is a "semi-lattice" (that is, a rhizome). 54. Perhaps the most architectural dimension of Zone was the materiality of the book itself, which, according to Kwinter, was the first such academic publication to be delivered as a designed object, compared with the "dissident" aesthetics of the first SemiotextÇe )s. He says it was the graphic design of Bruce Mau that guaranteed Zone its wide expo- sure. The increasing aestheticization of the text within this New York publishing scene around Deleuze can also be seen in later issues of Semiotext^eX from the Italian issue designed by Bigelow to Semiotext(e): Oasis , vol. 4, no. 3 (1984). 55. For these two versions of the city, compare Guattari and Negri's Communists Like Us: Neye Spaces of Liberty, New Lines of Alliance with Feher and Alliez's "The Luster of Capital," in Zone 1/2: The Contemporary City , both first published in 1985. 56. In a discussion of "singularities," which constitute immanent subjectivity, Deleuze writes: "The battle hovers over its own field, being neutral in relation to all of its temporal actualizations, neutral and impassive in relation to the victor and the vanquished, the coward and the brave; because of this it is all the more terrible. Never present but always yet to come and already passed, the battle is graspable only by the will of anonymity which it itself inspires." Gilles Deleuze, The Logic of Sense, ed. Constantin V. Boundas, trans. Mark Lester, Charles Stivale (New York: Columbia University Press, 1990), 116. Rajchman specifies that it is the Foucault lineage, not the Lefebvre/Debord context, out of which the Deleuzian discussion on cities emerges: "In Foucault there is already a lot about architecture and the city and Paul Rabinow - space and architecture - and there was kind of a debate around that. . . . Their discussion of architecture and cities, from my sense of intellectual history, is very different from the Baudrillard/Debord situationists. That's the earlier Lefebvre/Marxism kind based on reification - abstract space is mod- ernist and therefore bad. This energy - this discussion - came from more post- structuralist sources."</page><page sequence="10">reading it š I ivas meditating on it. I didn't know what to make of it, but I got to New York around 1978, and ... on the art scene something new had emerged called postmodernism. No one knew what it was. By 1979 there were the nouveaux philosophes - Henri Levy, André Glucksmann, Jean-Marie Benoist, and others [who had broken with Marxism and poststructuralism] . . . Meanwhile, at the I AUS (Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies ) they held a seminar and invited Julian Schnabel, David Salle, and Sherrie Levine - and it was moderated by Christian Hubert, a friend of mine who used to teach at Yale. Something new emerged in the art world [ postmodernism ]. Sherrie Levine was taking photos of other people's photographs and pre- senting the work as her own. In the first issue of Zone, there wasn't a single mention of the word [postmodernism], except once in my own article, where I sort of denounced it. That's when it occurred to me that " Rhizome " was the most succinct existing vision of what was important then because this was a description of the new emergent space. It was not what you were reading about, all these people still reading their Barthes and their Derrida. I suddenly realized it's . . . rhizome. "Rhizome," the paper, was first presented at the 1975 schizo-culture conference by Deleuze, who, in Lotringer's account, "managed to present an outline of his concept of the rhizome, which had not yet been discussed in print, but in French, very slowly, while drawing diagrams of root sys- tems and crabgrass on a blackboard."57 Later, it became the first chapter in Mille Plateaux. 58 The first English translation of "Rhizome" was published in 1981 in the journal Ideology and Consciousness, 59 but it only started to receive attention when included in On the Line , one of the "little black books" published in Semiotext^e)1 s Foreign Agent Series in 198?. Kwinter: We'd all read Anti-Œdipus. But Anti-Œdipus is not the same thing as " Rhizome ." Anti-Œdipus is a Hegelian, Freudal- Marxist interpretation of history. Deleuze is developing the production model of desire, but it hasn't turned into a whole reflection on historical space, as it gets developed in the second volume. " Rhizome" is an incredible departure in thinking. A rhizome is the horizontal root structure that Deleuze and Guattari used to supersede the "arborescent" model of traditional epistemology, which proceeds vertically from an originating Grund. "A rhizome is not answerable to any structural or generative model, being by nature foreign to the very idea of a genetic axis, or a deep structure," they write. "Any point on a rhizome can be connected with any other, and must be."60 Rhizome, in its later context as the opening chapter of A Thousand Plateaus, becomes a model for 144 57.

Its project is radical resubjectivization. Deleuze first professed his love of America in "Rhizome." It was also the first concept of Deleuze's to travel across the Atlantic, when he visited Columbia University; and it was the first Deleuzian conceptual "object" to become available - to be read and taught - in America. Deleuze writes: Everything of importance that has happened and that is happening proceeds by means of the American rhizome: the beatniks, the underground ' the subterranean mobs and gangs - all successive lateral shoots in immediate connection with an outside . Hence the difference between an American book and a European book, even when the American sets off pursuing trees . A difference in the very conception of the book: Leaves of Grass. Nor are directions the same in America: the East is where the arborescent search and the return to the old world takes place; but the West is rhizomatic, with its Indians without ancestry, its always receding borders, its fluid and shifting frontiers.6^ Kwinter: It was the only thing that had come out . . . . They brought it out as a separate book, and it wasn}t until 1988 that the full book A Thousand Plateaus came out . . . . "Rhizome" was published by Minuit as a tiny book, and then four y ears later my friend John Johnston translated it. It was an incredible little book. No one knew what to make of it. It hit me like a brick. Christian Hubert came uptown to ask me about postmodernism and I had an epiphany. But it was only by chance. I wasn't in architecture. I was interested in it, but I was doing literature, linguistics, philosophy, art; and it was an architect that came and asked me the question, and it played an amazing role. The American reception was essen- tially driven by architects. Even the fact that I was dragged into the Deleuze seminar. . . . The architects were always the ones who brought the issues to my attention. When Sylvere published it in English, it meant I could start teaching " Rhizome " in New York . . . . I also taught aThe Smooth and the Striated ." Massumi was sending me chapters of his trans- lations so I could make suggestions and I was probably teaching that to the students. They were all architects. Half the class went on to do master's degrees at Columbia. I taught an entire course on " Rhizome " at the School of Visual Arts, and I was teaching a Deleuzian interpretation of 20th-century American art. Somewhere between }81 and '83. 1 also started teaching at Parsons School of Design. I taught theory seminars at that school. I taught a class on Deleuze. "Nomadology" came out and I taught an entire course on Mille Plateaux around }84. A few people started coming to the seminar I was giving, like 14-5 61. Rajchman comments: "Deleuze, unlike Derrida, had a strong interest in American matters, on the superiority of American literature. He liked [Charles Sanders] Peirce, he liked pragmatism, English phi- losophy, he loved American literature." Deleuze and Guattari, "Rhizome," in On the Line , 4$.

But the use of "Rhizome" in design pedagogy exceeded its availability or translation. Rhizome distinguishes itself from the family of concepts in Anti-Œdipus as a graphically biological image of subjectivity, involving bees, wasps, rats, monkeys, and roots. Rhizome as a species of creative subjec- tivity, for Deleuze and Guattari, presented a new means of getting past structural linguistics as an exclusive model for subjectivity. Thus, in their famous example, the parallel "codes" of the wasp and the orchid are mutually infected in the production of a joint-subjectivity they describe as an orchid "becoming-wasp."62 For architects and art historians, the image of a biologi- cal "becoming" permitted nonhuman entities such as land- scapes - in the later SemiotextQe^s and Zone - to qualify as their own subjectivities: to live, to act, and to transform.6* The distinction between Anti-(Edipus and its sequel lies pre- cisely in the shift toward processes of subjectivization: from the 19th-century institutionalized subjects of Foucault, to the deterritorialized subjectivities of Mille Plateaux - the city, the territory, and the forest.64 Later Rajchman: I got a call from Peter Eisenman inviting me to the Anyone conferences [in 1991]* I thought Deleuze could have a really interesting impact in these debates in architecture , because part of what had happened to this Derridean stuff within archi- tecture had led to a loss of a sense of reality; drawings had become just as real as buildings . . . . What was interesting about Deleuze, when he had smooth and striated space and all that apparatus, was that he was really giving an account that could speak to the way architecture actually worked . Since Eisenman finally had a prob- lem with Derrida, they found in Deleuze something interesting, and this, in my point of view, is how the two things came together, : In 1992, SemiotextÇe ): Architecture was published,65 with essays by Guattari, Catherine Ingraham, Diller and Scofidio, Hani Rashid, Jesse Reiser, Lebbeus Woods, and Bob Somol. The previous SemiotextÇe ) editors had little to do with the issue, and Lotringer told me he didn't like the graphics, which he found to be too polished, "too architectural."66 Indeed, the dominant American reception, toward the end of 1980s and in the 1990s, marked a turn away from the radical, interdisciplinary ethos of Deleuze. At the point that 146 62. Deleuze and Guattari, "Rhizome," in On the Line. The orchid forms an image of the wasp and vice versa, in the sense that the wasp "becomes a piece in the orchid's reproductive apparatus." It is a rhizome: neither a wasp nor an orchid, but a pure "becoming." This would seem to be derived in part from the surrealist Roger Caillois's famous essay, "Mimicry and Legendary Psychaesthenia" (1935). 6'. The terminology of subjectivity as "becoming" nourished a wider debate among feminist theorists concerned with gender, sex, and identity. 64.

Lotringer, interview with the author.</page><page sequence="13">Deleuze was being directly taught in architecture schools by American theorists such as Kwinter and Somol, along with architects such as Greg Lynn, the interest in his work could be said to have enveloped the beginning of a more distinct architectural milieu, what later would be observed in the group surrounding the ANY publications and conferences - a theoretical praxis that began to close in on itself, leading in time to an evacuation in extremis. Milieu, in this sense, is a disciplinary complex fixed by a locale, a discourse, and autonomized around a set of concepts, here "rhizome," there "the fold," and elsewhere "the smooth and the striated." Such concepts, in turn, should not be viewed so much as having been "appropriated" by architects, but as elements that enabled the transformation of the milieu from within.67 Here is another version of postmodernism distinct from that usually associated with 1970s architecture. In many ways it is more theoretically developed. The two key texts that brought Deleuze and Guattari's concepts into focus and stimulated this unique early-1990s following were the last chapter of A Thousand Plateaus , "1440: The Smooth and the Striated,"68 and Le Pli , which was first published in French just after A Thousand Plateaus came out in English (1987), and later translated as The Fold: Leibniz and the Baroque 0995). 69 The Smooth and the Striated Kwinter: How did Deleuze 's project get picked up by mainstream architecture ? It was absolutely uThe Smooth and the Striated" "Rhizome" remained an obscure text that required much too much imagination, interpretative imagination . . . " The Smooth and the Striated" dominated architectural theory in the 1990s in a way that nothing else had since Colin Rowe's essay " Transparency .,J7° There is a sense in Kwinter's recollection that "The Smooth and the Striated" did not require conceptual transla- tion (mediation) in its entry into the architectural imaginary: the essay privileges "space" as the critical model to think the contemporary problematics of capitalism and subjectivity, and it reformulates the traditional city as logos with an urbanism that resides in the city's impersonal "will" to pro- duce effects, irreducible to an authorized form of urbanism. For architects, perhaps the most powerful effect of the essay was the substitution of space with a new leitmotif, surface . "The Smooth and the Striated" converts "space" into a sequence of dynamic surface expressions that begin to sug- gest preliminary architectural subjectivities.71 14-7 67. When I refer to a Deleuzean milieu , here I do not mean "middle," as per Deleuze's usage, but a disciplinary com- plex per se.

In "The Smooth and the Striated," Deleuze and Guattari identi- fied two conceptions of space: nomos , the smooth space of nomadism, or the desert; and logos} the striated or seden- tary space of the city, expressed through the traditional idea of the polis. The essay also engaged a critique of the city, the "striated space par excellence," forward- ing a new conception of urbanism based on movement and materiality (after Negri's The Savage Anomaly ). See Deleuze and Guattari, "1440: The Smooth and the Striated," 481. 71. Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus , 487.

Also see Alejandro Zaera-Polo's discussion of "faciality" in "The Politics of the Envelope," in Log 13/14 (Fall 2008) and Log 16 (Spring/Summer 2009). The primacy of surface is so widespread in recent architectural pro- duction that it can scarcely be reduced to any one event. The interest in surface is, of course, fundamental to architecture, and arguably predates the received mod- ernist discourse of space. In describing the primacy of surface, Deleuze and Guattari cite the "the reduction of space to the plane," in the German aesthetic theories of Alois Riegl and Wilhelm Worringer, who they recognize as prece- dents in the thinking of smooth space. See Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus , 492-9?.</page><page sequence="14">The Fold Rajchman: Well, I remember when Deleuze published Le Pli, I : wrote something about it that I sent him He said ' " This is very funny, because in reaction to this book there's two groups that I never expected to respond: surfers and architects " So, I think, . . . Deleuze, who wrote not so much directly about architecture, you know, was surprised and interested that this phenomenon had emerged?1 Deleuze's The Fold explores the critical simultaneity of organic matter and subjectivity in Leibniz's Monadologie. 7* For Deleuze, "the fold" is an irreducible relation of subjec- tivity by which organisms are "strictly coextensive" with their habitats. Similarly, in Lynn's 1993 AD editorial, folding in architecture involved "the intense integration" or "fold- ing" of architectural elements into their environment.74" Citing the Cardiff Bay Opera House project, Lynn proposed a "pliant" and submissive building that implies "a dependence on external forces for self-definition."75 This reformulation of The Fold advances not just a new species of object for architecture; the fold tacitly suggests a new subject , to be precise, the building as a "subject" of its environment, and whose modalities are "smooth, pliant, compliant," and "submissive." The building-as-subject in Lynn's thinking is constituted as a remainder of the techno- logical procedures that are its reason for being. The aim here is not to criticize this schema on the level of interpretation. Indeed, Lynn's early work presents one of the few philosophi- cally coherent experiments in architecture's project vis-à-vis Deleuze. It is precisely the robustness of such an architectural schema that draws attention to its unannounced productions of subjectivity. Folding in Architecture reaches for an impersonal subjec- tivity of architecture, which it does in an interesting way; but it re-oedipalizes the subject in the built form, and what emerges as a techno-organism, on the one hand, and its weak double, a passive building subject, on the other, are "compliant" with the technological field of production which subsumes them. The debate that surrounded The Fold can be summa- rized as the claims by theorists toward a misreading of Deleuze. Lynn himself argued that The Fold "undoubtedly risks being translated into architecture as mere folded fig- ures."76 Yet the "misreading" for architecture - if there can be such a thing - lies not in any formal articulation but in the peculiar reterritorializations of subjectivity.77 148 72. In 1993, the year that Deleuze's The Fold was published, the London journal AD published the special issue Folding in Architecture , guest edited by Greg Lynn, which reprinted the first two chapters of The Fold , "The Pleats of Matter" and "The Folds in the Soul," alongside a series of design projects that experiment- ed formally with digitally generated, physically folded surfaces. Included are projects by Kas Oosterhuis, Bahram Shirdel, and Lynn, with essays by Deleuze, Rajchman, Lynn, and Jeffrey Kipnis.

The moment when Deleuze entered architec- tural discourse was when " virtual reality" was the buzzword. The decade-long Anyone conferences and publications (whose participants included Rajchman, Massumi, Kwinter, De Landa, and Somol) provided a critical forum for the 1990s architectural discussion around Deleuze. By the late 1990s, ANY magazine published two issues influenced by Deleuze: The Virtual House (1997), 78 guest edited by Rajchman, which reprinted Deleuze's "The Actual and the Virtual," alongside essays by Alliez, Elizabeth Grosz, and Virilio, as well as a series of design proposals for a "Virtual House"; followed by Diagram Work (1998), guest edited by Ben van Berkel.79 In 1999, Lynn's Animate Form was published; its central focus was Deleuze's concept of the "virtual" in what was the earliest architectural articulation of concepts drawn from Deleuze^ Le Bergsonisme* 0 The assertion of a virtual design space - whose substance is "information" - and the formal practice it entails were developed along different lines. While Lynn was more interested in the biomorphic conception of formal evolution (blobs), there were practitioners focused on movement and animation, and others interested in data or information in the process itself, such as Asymptote's Information Space or MVRDV's Data Town, which translated statistical data into "datascapes."81 There is in this contemporary architectural project an unmistakable attempt to recuperate the personological sub- ject; the building strives to become itself a live entity, yet subjectivity is never raised in this discussion. If the early anarchic reception addressed Deleuze and GuattarPs project of subjectivity via a broad disciplinary complex, the later architectural milieux unwittingly pervert or renaturalize this project by rehabilitating identity, ego, and individual- ism. "Who comes after the subject?" has been answered definitively with, "Another subject."82 Kwinter: You are absolutely right. You can summarize Deleuze' s philosophy , on the one hand ' and can also summarize everything that is impoverished within contemporary Deleuzianism in architecture around this one particular problem - that all of Deleuze is research into matter becoming subject. Deleuze' s entire enterprise is describing the ways in which matter becomes subject and multiplying the possibilities for matter to become subject. Don't let people think it is about anthropomorphism. It is not 149 78. Cynthia Davidson and John Rajchman, eds., ANY 19/20: The Virtual House (1997). 79.

Exiting Deleuze The accounts given here of the late reception provide not so much evidence of a growing affiliation between Deleuze and architecture as of a swift and decisive divorce. The invest- ment in severed philosophical schemata and the evacuation of subjectivity by the discipline will no doubt be viewed as the screening out of the protean, anti-fascist project of Deleuze and Guattari, wherein concepts such as rhizome first gained currency as political "tools" or "machines" for producing a new kind of subjectivity. The publication of essays by Deleuze alongside archi- tects' design statements (often as "montage") and the styling of architectural critique with Deleuzian language or allusions could further be said to have lent to Deleuze a primarily authorizing function in what has been called architecture's neo-conservative "formalist" project (in which the subject is anathematized). But it must also be said that Deleuze not only authorizes the architectural assimilation of a lateral conceptual apparatus, he is also made to authorize an entire disciplinarj complex through which such concepts are reified within architectural theory. In a bizarre reversal, Deleuze's apparatus is then sadistically stripped of its radical lining: it is Deleuze sans organes. So who then is the subject? It is not that the architects misappropriated Deleuze - an accident of reading. Rather, the betrayal of Deleuze can be seen to emerge from within architecture's tragic relationship to subjectivity since the beginning of modernism, and which has also come to define the failure of the postmodern project.8* Both the evacuation of subjectivity and its return finds its source in architecture's disciplinary unconscious and the repressive mechanisms designed to protect its interiority. But it could also be said that the very attempt to realize (to renaturalize) the image of subjectivization activates the 150 8?. Architecture's problem of subjectivity is precisely the contestation of modern autonomy and its separation of subject and object - long regarded as insufficient to account for the creativity of architec- tural production. There is, of course, a vast external literature on subjectivity that has circulated within architecture theory since World War II, from Freud and Nietzsche, to Derrida, Foucault, and Lacan, while the Deleuzian discussion today continues to sidestep the question of subjectivity. As a result of this failure, the problem of the "subject" remains unresolved and is the main event in the newer discourse of "the event," a phe- nomenological concept dating to Husserl. This discourse of the "event" embraced by architects and philosophers alike finds shelter in the phenomenological stratum that Deleuze stridently refutes. From Empiricisme et Subjectivité (Deleuze's first book, on Hume) to Logique du Sens and Mille Plateaux , Deleuze emphatically denies the transcendental subject of Husserl, which he takes over with his concepts impersonality, singularité, and effect. As Lotringer said, Deleuze and Guattari do not rehabilitate the [phe- nomenological] subject in any way. Deleuze and Guattari return subjectivity to "the things themselves" in Husserl's words ("no ideas without things, and vice versa"), and subjectivity as person- hood becomes derivative of a primary, perhaps anterior subjectivity immanent to "objecthood" (materiality), what Deleuze calls the new transcendental field ( pure immanence).</page><page sequence="17">Simone Brott lectures in archi- tecture at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane.

Nonetheless, the architectural project on the Deleuzian Right (the placing of Deleuze on the wrong side of the spec- tral mirror), in its acritical address and exaggerated réin- scription of the modernist subject, raises the stakes for a new critical project. The technologies that convert architecture into a subject suggest the possibility of a more expansive thinking of an unconstituted architectural subjectivity, one that does not seek to rehabilitate the ego or the self. Deleuze's philosophy suggests an architectural subjectivity always yet to come. 151</page></plain_text>
