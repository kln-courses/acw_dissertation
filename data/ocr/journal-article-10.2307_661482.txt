<plain_text><page sequence="1">THREE FACTORS IN PRIMITIVE RELIGION BY JOHN R. SWANTON IN THE following pages the writer wishes to consider three points regarding the religious conceptions of primitive peoples in which his studies have led him to positions considerably at variance with those of most of the accepted authorities. The first of these concerns the awakening of the earliest of those conceptions, contention being made that genetic value has mistakenly been given to mere associations. To illustrate what I have in mind I subjoin the following quotations from four prominent anthropologists: It seems as though thinking men, as yet at a low level of culture, were deeply impressed by two groups of biological problems. In the first place, what is it that makes the difference between a living body and a dead one; what causes waking, sleep, trance, disease, death? In the second place, what are those human shapes which appear in dreams and visions? Looking at these two groups of phenomena, the ancient savage philosophers probably made their first step by the obvious inference that every man has two things belonging to him, namely, a life and a phantom. These two are evidently in close connexion with the body, the life as enabling it to feel and think and act, the phantom as being its image or second self; both, also, are perceived to be things separable from the body, the life as able to go away and leave it insen- sible or dead, the phantom as appearing to people at a distance from it. The second step would seem also easy for savages to make, seeing how extremely difficult civilized men have found it to unmake. It is merely to combine the life and the phantom. As both belong to the body, why should they'not also belong to one another, and be manifestations of one and the same soul? Let them then be considered as united, and the result is that well-known concep- tion which may be described as an apparition soul, a ghost-soul.' What we call "physical nature" may very well be "nature" also to the savage in most of its normal aspects; yet its more startling manifestations, thunderstorms, eclipses, eruptions, and the like, are eminently calculated to awake in him an Awe that I believe to be specifically religious both in its essence and in its fruits, whether Animism has, or has not, succeeded in imposing its distinctive colour upon it.2 There are causes originating the belief in charms, rites and spells so simple that nothing could be more natural to the primitive human mind. 1 E.

If, says Sir E. F. im Thurn, a Carib sees a rock in any way abnormal or curious, and if shortly afterwards any evil happens to him, he regards rock and evil as cause and effect, and perceives in the rock a spirit. This is animistic; but the same tendency to be impressed by coincidence underlies Magic. For example: A hunting party of Esquimos met with no game. One of them went back to the sledges and got the ham-bone of a dog to eat. Re- turning with this in hand, he met and killed a seal. Ever afterwards he carried a ham-bone in his hand when hunting. The ham-bone had become a talisman.3 The attitude of the primitive's mind is very different [from that of civilized man]. The natural world he lives in presents itself in quite another aspect to him. All its objects and all its entities are involved in a system of mystic participations and exclusions; it is these which constitute its cohesion and its order. They therefore will attract his attention first of all, and they alone will retain it. If a phenomenon interests him, and he does not confine himself to a merely passive perception of it without reaction of any kind, he will immediately conjure up, as by a kind of mental reflex, an occult and in- visible power of which this phenomenon is a manifestation.4 That peoples in all ages of the world and on every level of culture have associated religious beliefs with the phenomena of death, dreams, the breath, and startling manifestations of nature is evident enough; what is not evident is that there is a causal connection between the two. If I see a man die and dream of him afterward, why is it an "obvious inference"j that he has a life and a phantom divisible from the body? Why should I not accept the phenomenon of death and the phenomenon of dreams on the same basis as any other natural phenomena and let it go at that? Did not Tylor think of an "obvious inference" merely because he knew that the things were in fact associated? Similarly with startling natural phenomena such as "thunderstorms, eclipses, eruptions, and the like." I can see how these might affect primi- tive man disagreeably and how they might inspire him with terror if he had had any previous experience of them, but physical fear and religious awe are two entirely different things and Marett's assumption of causal connection is altogether gratuitous. Im Thurn's Carib and the Eskimo cited by Read inferred respec- tively that a spirit resided in a certain rock and magic in a ham- 3 Carveth Read, The Origin of Man and His Superstitions, p. 116. 4 Lucien L~vy-Bruhl, English trans., New York, 1923, pp. 35-36.</page><page sequence="3">360 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 26, 1924 bone because they believed in spirits and in magic as everyone acquainted with the peoples in question knows. But does this fact clothe us with any right to assert that the same deductions would have been made had they not believed in them? Finally, why, in the words of L6vy-Bruhl, should primitive man concern himself to go behind the scenes and conjure up "an occult and invisible power of which this phenomenon is a manifestation?" The writer's experience with primitive religion would indicate that it cannot be attached to a few objects, phenomena, or emo- tions to the exclusion of others. Death, dreams, a thunderstorm, an eclipse, the sun, the grizzly bear may excite particular religious interest, specialized as it were out of a general religious attitude, but it cannot, therefore, be concluded that any one, or a few, of them were points of departure for the religious attitude as a whole. Some of them are localized more or less strictly, and in the case of common phenomena such as death and dreams equal regard was not paid to them by all people, nor is it evident that more religious regard was bestowed upon them than on objects confined within narrow areas. It has never been suggested, for instance, that Haida religion originated in the awe in which killer whales were held, or that of the Plains tribes from a bison cult. Emotions toward the dead were probably not precisely the same in any two tribes; ancestor worship is present in some places and wanting in others, and dreams played a greater part in the life of certain peoples, such as the Iroquois and Huron, than was the case else- where. It will not do to speak of "obvious inferences" or say that such and such a deduction is "natural." What is obvious and natural is an association of the phenomena in question with existing beliefs, not the deduction of the latter from the former. The religious attitude itself is evidently one of those primary human factors which cannot be tied down to an origin as specific as even the common experiences of death and dreams. Is not the attempt to do so another example of the "paticularistic error" which has been such a potent cause of misunderstanding in an- thropology? The second point to which I would call attention concerns another phase of the error of particularism, the assumed intro-</page><page sequence="4">SWANTON] PRIMITIVE RELIGION 361 duction of various elements in the religious complex at successive periods. Primitive religion includes numerous factors such as magic, supernatural beings in human form usually divided into classes, a world occupied by the souls of the dead, ceremonies, and so on, and it has been a favorite occupation of theorists to arrange these in a time sequence, under the assumption that they were intro- duced into the religious complex successively. Even when a complete scheme of this kind has not been formulated, one element has at least been picked out as a point of origin for the rest. In consequence we have the animistic theory of Tylor, the ancestor worship theory of Spencer, the "magic" theory of Frazer, the All-father theory of Lang, the social-ceremonial theory of Durk- heim, and so on, each of which may be supported by evidence from certain tribes-and confuted by evidence from others. Animism is widely spread, ancestor worship is prominent among the Zulu, the Vedda, and the Papuans, magic among the Melanesians and Central Australians, an All-father cult among the inhabitants of southeastern Australia, and some peoples of America such as the Pawnee and Tsimshian, while many of the Australians again, and the peoples of our Southwest and the eastern Plains tended toward ceremonialism. If one has a theory to establish he can, of course, select as most primitive such of the above as-agree with it and he will findenough "survivals" of the same thing in other parts of the world upon which to erect a plausible structure. But, even if certain religious elements are more prominent in one place than in another, where shall we look for peoples having only animism, only ancestor worship, only magic, only an All-father belief, only ceremonies? Generally speaking we find traces of all of them and this is so far true that it would be a fairer deduction to assume that where accent is placed upon one we have to deal rather with a special manifestation. Instead of viewing the religious complex as constructed of parts successively introduced, we might rather consider them as simultaneous manifestations of the religious sentiment, showing greater differentiation here and more special- ization there, but properly a unit. There are, of course, number- less concepts and emotional attitudes entering into religious</page><page sequence="5">362 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 belief, but let us select a few only of the objective beliefs by way of example, and imagine a complex like the following: 1. Belief in magic (mana, orenda, etc.). 2. Belief in numerous anthropomorphic beings which have never lived as men (gods, nature spirits, etc.). 3. Belief in a difference in power between these, frequently culminating in the idea of a superior or supreme deity (a germinal monotheism). 4. Belief in supernatural beings of human origin but more than human power (demi-gods, saints). 5. Belief in disembodied souls of the dead (ancestors), etc. 6. Belief in embodied souls with greater powers in connection with things supernatural (priests, prophets, shamans). 7. Belief in souls embodied in human beings generally. According as one of these elements is expanded at the expense of the rest we would have manaism, polytheism or animism, monotheism, saint worship, ancestor worship, or sacerdotalism, but traces of the other elements of the complex are almost always to be found. This is t ue of civilized, barbarous and savage peoples alike. Thus the Haida of the north Pacific coast made use of magic (1), believed in a number of animistic beings both in and apart from nature (2), distinguished these into classes dif- fering in power and headed by a heaven god (3), believed that some of these beings had formerly lived as men (4), in the existence of souls embodied in human beings and continuing for some time after having left their bodies (5 and 7), and in shamans (6). Among the Natchez we again appear to find all of these factors represented: magic, supernatural beings, a supreme solar deity, superior men embodied and disembodied (the members of the Sun caste and medicine-men), and souls of ordinary men embodied and disembodied. Turning to civilized people we find that while Christianity is ostensibly a monotheism, polytheistic tendencies are encountered in connection with the doctrine of the Trinity and in that inter- pretation of angels which would make of them independent beings between the world of God and the world of men. If magic is in some measure suppressed it has yet played its part, belief in saints is common and that in disembodied souls universal. Mohammedan- ism professes to be even more highly monotheistic but it does not exclude belief in spirits of various classes such as jinns and peris,</page><page sequence="6">SWANTON] PRIMITIVE RELIGION 363 a profound reverence for Mohammed and for saints, and the use of magic. In China a relatively lofty worship of Heaven exists side by side with similar beliefs in powers of lower order, a proverb- ial ancestor worship, and a highly developed magic. Hindu religions, while recognizing a supreme deity, lesser deities, and magic, have taken a special slant toward pantheism, and have provided, not merely for the translation of men to a level with the gods but to a position above them. Zoroastrianism, although specifically a dualism, shows the same general categories, and this will be found true of most of the other advanced forms of faith. When we consider the limitations and dilutions of mono- theism above indicated, the difference between the monotheistic religions of more developed peoples and those primitive cults which include the idea of a superior or supreme deity is not so great. Such a conception, usually associated with the sky or the sun, is, indeed, surprisingly common. In America may be cited the beliefs of the Quechua, the Pueblos, the Creek, the Iroquois, the Ojibwa, the Siouan tribes of the southern Plains, the Pawnee, the Haida, Tsimshian, Kwakiutl, and Salish. In Africa a supreme deity of a certain type appears among the northern and north- eastern Bantu and the Hamites of the East, besides many of the true Negro tribes of the Sudan. In Asia it occurs among certain Siberian peoples; in Europe among the Greeks, Romans, Teutons, and some of the Slavs. Its occurrence among certain races regarded as most primitive from other points of view is still more surprising, peoples such as the natives of southeastern Australia, the Negrillo, and even the Bushmen and Andaman Islanders. Therefore even the as- sumed advanced monotheism, or something very close to it, may have originated in various parts of the world at an early date through specialization out of the third element of the complex above given. Naturally we should not look for its higher philo- sophical connotations but it is doubtful whether its more exoteric side presupposes as much mental advance as has been held necessary. At any rate I feel sure we shall be nearer the truth if we regard "the evolution of religion" rather as an expansion and</page><page sequence="7">364 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 26, 1924 differentiation of a complex such as has been suggested than a successive introduction of such essential and widely spread ele- ments. Thirdly, I wish to utter a complaint against the indefinite use of the term animism. Apart from magic pure and simple, the objects in nature toward which primitive man exhibits religious emotions always contain a human element, and therefore the term animism is not sufficiently specific unless it is just that which we are to understand. Still less is it necessary to coin another term, animatism, as suggested by Marett. Either an object is a thing with magical properties or there is something human about it. In the former case you work it like a machine by knowing the combination. If you know the combination it will respond, but if it has any choice whether it will or will not respond, it is the seat of, or under the control of, a being with human mentality. When the human form is associated with this being, it is spoken of as anthropomorphic, but when the human form is not so promi- nent the term anthropopathic is sometimes employed. However, there is, after all, but little difference, because the assumption of human mentality constantly suggests the form in which it ordi- narily appears to us, and when the human mental'ty has been once attributed to anything a being human in every other particular frequently evolves from it. In the regard in which animals are ordinarily held by primitive men there is no more of religion than in our own; whenever religion enters it is because a human men- tality is ascribed to them. The Indians of our north Pacific coast are thus perfectly consistent when they speak of their animal deities as removing their skins and appearing in human forms when they are at home. Myths in other parts of the world are full of the same thought, and even when the animal guise is retained the human mentality is apparent. An interesting example of this is the Haida belief connecting points along the coast of their island homes with killer whales containing anthro- pomorphic beings. The last mentioned are incarnated in the killers and the killers in the points, the same name being applied to each point, the killer living under it, and the anthropomorphic</page><page sequence="8">SWANTON] PRIMITIVE RELIGION 365 being in the killer. A casual visitor to the islands years ago might have imagined at one time that these people worshipped natural features, at another that they worshipped killer-whales, when in fact it was the anthropomorphic incarnation in each. Much of the confusion on this point among anthropologists is due to the fact that the anthropomorphic element in the native concept is not equally clear in all cases. Sometimes the man-deity is perfectly distinct; at others he is ill-defined. But the actions of the believer in each case should indicate pretty clearly whether we have to deal with an anima or with magic. The two ideas are themselves perfectly distinct and perfectly intelligible, however much the primitive man himself may seem at times to confuse them. My conclusions on the three points just discussed are, in brief, (1) that the deduction of religious concepts or emotions from natural phenomena, however closely they may be found asso- ciated, is unproved and improbable; (2) that the history of religion has probably consisted in the differentiation of various elements from an original complex and the varyingstress placed upon those elements rather than the successive introduction of new elements; and (3) aside from pure magic, the religious attitude toward natural phenomena consists in the ascription of a human element to them.
