<plain_text><page sequence="1">Derek Attridge on the Ethical Debates in Literary Studies interviewed by Zahi Zalloua The following is an interview with Derek Attridge, whose The Sin- gularity of Literature (2004) has helped to reframe the ethical debates in literary studies in a highly innovative manner. This exchange took place via email, August-September 2008. Zahi Zalloua: Emmanuel Levinas's influence has been quite significant in the last 15 years, fueling the (poststructuralist) ethical turn in philosophy and liter- ary studies. Yet now that his reputation is well established, philosophers have growingly expressed their concerns about the limits and viability of an ethics of difference, a philosophy of the Other. There is an almost deafening call to go beyond- Oublier Levinas! - in the work of Alain Badiou and Slavo] Zizek, two of Levinas's staunchest critics. Badiou scrutinizes Levinas's contention of the radicality of the other ('The other always resembles me too much for the hypoth- esis of an originary exposure of his alterity to be necessarily true" [Ethics 22]), while Zizek objects to the mystification of the other, which leads to blindness of the suffering concrete others: "the true ethical step is the one BEYOND the face of the other, the one of SUSPENDING the hold of the face: the choice AGAINST the face, for the THIRD" ("Smashing the Neighbor's Face" [2006]). Are these objections valid? Is there an irresolvable tension between politics (justice) and ethics that an ethics of difference purportedly eschews? Derek Attridge: Levinas was immensely important to me in thinking through the problem of responsibility as it operates in the domain of art, and this could not have happened had I not found his account of ethics in the wider sphere compelling. The boldness of his gesture in reversing the relation of ethics to philosophical analysis and generalization cut through a Gordian knot in the old problem of the passage between "is" and "ought," and opened up an entirely fresh approach to familiar questions. This is not to say, however, that his thought is without its difficulties, and the two critics you mention, Badiou and 2izek, focus on what are probably the two most problematic aspects. (Other problematic areas, such as his treatment of gender and his disregard of art, are less implicated in the central claims he makes.)

He acknowledges, however, that Levinas is not in fact making claims about the phenomenal- ity of the other person as he or she impinges upon my psyche; the ethical demand of the other operates in another register. Badiou asserts that this other register must be a religious one; that the only sense that can be made of Levinas's absolute other is that it is the ethical name for God. Badiou is undoubtedly right in raising the question - it has been raised many times before - of the relation between Levinas' s ethical phi- losophy and his religious commitment. Clearly, they can't be kept entirely separate in the way that Levinas sometimes seemed to want them to be: it seems likely that he would not have been able to advance ethical thought in the way he did without bringing to bear on the traditions of Western philosophy a mode of thinking absorbed from the Jewish tradition. But those of us who find Levinas's account of ethics valuable and who at the same time resist the notion of the divine underpinning of that account are not, I think, falling into incoherence. That "other register," the register that is not a question of phenomenality or the psyche, does not have to be religious; it is, precisely, an ethical register, understanding ethics as the realm of a responsibility that exerts itself prior to philosophical analysis. It may appear to have some of the qualities of religious belief because of this priority, which resists the attentions of the rationalist or positivist, and it is certainly extremely difficult to talk about in the kind of philosophical discourse Badiou favors, or claims to favor. But that challenge could be a sign of its viability, not its weakness. (I wouldn't, by the way, call Levinas's ethics an "ethics of difference": the demands of the other are far greater than the demands of the merely different. Badiou recognizes this, and after disparaging the ethics of dif- ference admits that it is an ideology "strikingly distant from Levinas's actual conception of things" [Ethics, 20].) My sense, then, is that Badiou puts his finger on an aspect of Levinas's thought that is undoubtedly problematic, but that he follows Levinas too slavishly in moving from the ethical to the religious. To say this is not to do away with the problem of the relation between the phe- nomenal appearance of the other and the source of ethical obligation as non-phenomenal. When Levinas speaks of responding to the face of the other, this is not simply an allegorical way of presenting the apprehension of a non-physical alterity; the psychological experience of being looked at by the eyes of another is quite specifically being evoked, but it's not clear exactly what role this plays in the theorization of obligation. (Levi- nas reduces the weight of psychological experience in various ways - if Substance #120, Vol. 38, no. 3, 2009</page><page sequence="3">20 Attridge interviewed by Zalloua we notice the eyes of the other we're not responding ethically; the "face" can be found in other parts of the body, and so on - but he cannot evacu- ate it entirely without losing the force of the model he is using.) Perhaps the face is best understood as the kind of metaphor in which the vehicle remains powerful even when the tenor determines the central meaning. One might note in passing that Badiou's conception of a subject- inducing fidelity to the event that breaks with existing knowledge is not entirely distinct from Levinas's conception of a responsibility to the other that can't be grasped within the determinations of the same. In ¿izek we find the other common objection to Levinas, and one which I don't think he ever fully got to grips with, though he was fre- quently confronted with it and made many attempts to answer it. How do we get from the ethical encounter with the singular other, face to face, to the demands of justice and politics? Levinas's notion of "the third" was his way of dealing with this question, though he did not have a consistent view of the relation between the ethics of alterity and the importance of the third. In Totality and Infinity he makes the striking assertion, "The third party looks at me in the eyes of the Other.... It is not that there first would be the face, and then the being it manifests or expresses would concern himself with justice; the epiphany of the face qua face opens humanity" (213). This statement is need of further explanation - how can the third party look at me through the eyes of the other? How does the face of the resolutely singular other open humanity? Instead of developing and explaining this idea, Levinas re-thinks the notion of the third, and by the time of Otherwise than Being it has become a complication that troubles the face-to-face. A typical statement is "The responsibility for the other is an immediacy antecedent to questions, it is proximity. It is troubled and becomes a problem when a third party enters" (157). It's important to appreciate the breadth of Levinas's later sense of what the third introduces into the singular ethical relation: it's not just justice and politics that come into being with the third, but thought, thematization, questioning, calculation, philosophy - almost all of what we do as thinking beings and as communicating groups. So one can go further than ¿izek: it's not just for the sake of justice that one has to go beyond the face of the other, but for the sake of virtually everything we value, almost everything that makes human life possible. Levinasian ethics is not a principle we could live by - as ¿izek says, justice and love are "structurally incompatible" ("Smashing the Neighbor's Face"). It's not so much a tension that exists between ethics understood in this way and politics or justice as an incommensurability. One can't translate the infinite responsibility for the destitute other into a political programme - Derrida's discussion of responsibility in The Gift of Death is a clear (and at times quite funny) articulation of this impossibility. But we live this Substance #120, Vol. 38, no. 3, 2009</page><page sequence="4">Ethical Debates in Literary Studies 2 1 impossibility if we live as ethical beings, rather than as the mechanical servants of justice and revolution that ¿izek envisages. Living ethically is a constant negotiation between ethics and justice. (Of course there are many other ways of using the term "ethics": Zizek wants to use it for the domain of politics and social justice; Kierkeg- aard uses it to denominate the general laws against which the knight of faith, like Abraham, obeys a singular command; and so on. Moreover, "justice" for Derrida is close to "ethics" for Levinas, and quite different from what the later Levinas means by "justice." There's nothing wrong with these variant uses, as long as we know in what sense we're using the word.) It has to be said that when Levinas attempts to translate his ethical stance into political statements, the results are disappointing. What this illustrates is the absence of any algorithm that would automatically con- vert the one into the other. (See Howard Caygill's penetrating discussion in Levinas and the Political.) One would have hoped that Levinas's own negotiations between the ethical and the political might have produced more satisfactory results, but that does not mean that you or I should give up the struggle. Nor that Levinas's challenge to the Éizekian revolution- ary machine is a weak one. Zahi Zalloua: While your work is clearly indebted to Levinas, you have kept your distance from Levinas, refusing the ethical model of pure alterity and endors- ing, as it were, more of a Derridian adaptation of Levinas- one that stresses the selfs relationality to the other (151). In his later work, Otherwise than Being, Levinas implicitly responds to the concerns Derrida expressed in "Violence and Metaphysics, " moving away from the face-to-face encounter as the paradigmatic ethical scene to the question of language and the possibility of ethical figuring. Levinas comes to realize that the ethical can signify within the realm of repre- sentation, that the language of ontology does not preclude nor exhaust what Levinas calls the "ethical saying. " Contrasting saying (le dire) with the said (le ait)- "the birth place of ontology" (42) - Levinas argues that saying "is not a modality of cognition" (48) nor an "exchange of information" (92). Levinas is aware, however, of the paradox that as soon as one utters something, once mean- ing happens, one enters into the domain of the said. Yet he does not stop there. Refusing the false choice between saying and the said, between pure alterity and comprehension, respect and violence, Levinas advocates a kind of skepticism, an "endless critique" (44), or "an incessant unsaying of the said" (181). To what extent is this Levinas of Otherwise than Being compatible with your formula- tion of the reader's double bind: "to find oneself reading an inventive work is to find oneself subject to certain obligations- to respect its otherness, to respond to its singularity, to avoid reducing it to the familiar and the utilitarian even while attempting to comprehend by relating it to these" (130)? Substance #120, Vol. 38, no. 3, 2009</page><page sequence="5">22 Attridge interviewed by Zalloua Derek Attridge: Yes, I do find Derrida's critique of Levinas convincing, even while I share his huge admiration. And there is much less in Other- wise than Being that I find myself unhappy with than in Totality and Infin- ity - even though the earlier work packs a punch that the later one lacks. The dichotomy of the saying and the said - though often misun- derstood - helpfully brings out the discursive implications of the ethical relation. The ethical response to the other is an act, not an entity, and an act not of asserting or finalizing but of opening, of welcoming, of making ready - what Levinas finds in the Biblical hineini, here I am. Yet to speak is to say something-, discourse presupposes a semantic content, and hence all those things I mentioned earlier as introduced by the third: themati- zation, logic, questions, etc. To speak, then, is to involve the third and to compromise the purity of the face-to-face relation as an ethical event. (This is only one instance of the presence of the third from the first moment of the ethical response, notwithstanding Levinas' s tendency to talk of the third as though it comes second. In Adieu Derrida makes much of the fact that the third does not wait.) The impossible task of ethics, therefore, is to divest one's response of all that is not ethical, all that would reduce the ethical to a scheme or a program or a moral. It is to seek for ways to speak that don't fall into the graspable domain of the spoken, to see without slipping into the given forms of the seen, to hear without being dominated by the heard. Because it is impossible, it is an incessant effort. When I tried to account for the kind of response to a literary work that seemed to me appropriate for literature, I found Levinas's emphasis on this impossible but necessary task of unsaying the said extremely valu- able (the French is perhaps a bit clearer: "dédit du Dit"). It tallied with my sense that the only truly literary response to a work of literature is in the event of reading, not in any interpretive content or extractable truth, and that this results in the paradox you cite: a good reading utilizes all the resources of linguistic and literary convention in order to move be- yond them in a singular response. It is when these resources fail that one begins to do justice to the work - provided that one has exploited them to the full. Similarly, I would say, an ethical response of the Levinasian sort must draw on all the moral resources available and yet go beyond them in affirming the singularity of the other. Zahi Zalloua: The Singularity of Literature makes a compelling case for the co-primacy of aesthetics and ethics in literary studies, resisting the interpretive reduction of literary work to moral philosophy, which is the tendency among Neo- Aristotelian critics such as Wayne Booth and Martha Nussbaum. Yet, you're quick to insist that this Neo- Aristotelian model of ethical criticism is not in and of itself objectionable- only that it fails to do justice to the work as Substance #120, Vol. 38, no. 3, 2009</page><page sequence="6">Ethical Debates in Literary Studies 23 literature. That is, it fails "to read a literary work responsibly" (129), since it does not attend to what is distinctively literary about the work. And as long as an approach respects the "unpredictability of reading," you even leave open the possibility of a "responsible instrumentality" (130). But doesn't such an approach to literature, whose proclaimed project is to extract moral philosophy from the literary text (to foster a rhetoric of exemplarity), raise ethical questions for the reader, for any reader who valorizes the singularity of literature, "literature as such" (76)? That is to say, are these two approaches really compatible? Is there a way of affirming the multiple (ethical) responses that a work may elicit without violating the double bind of reading? Derek Attridge: If I were asked to assess the social or individual value of literature (or art more generally), I would say something along the fol- lowing lines. First, it needs to be understood that we are talking not about the value of the mere existence of certain objects - books, paintings, disks, etc. - in a given culture, but about a set of practices of reading, listening, viewing and so on whereby those objects are repeatedly given a new existence. Then, I would stress that these practices can be valuable in a number of ways. Let's take the reading of novels: this is a practice that can impart useful and important knowledge, historical, geographical, and of many other sorts; can alert readers to linguistic subtleties and thus enhance their uses of and responses to language; can increase readers' awareness and appreciation of aesthetic qualities such as balance, organized detail, and resolution; and, yes, can provide models of ethical behavior that may be morally instructive. In addition, of course, they are able to produce a great deal of pleasure in doing all these things, and in many other ways. None of these reading practices treats novels as works of literature, but the fact that they come before the reader classified already as works of literature may enhance their power to achieve these other beneficial ef- fects. It is therefore likely that a culture in which novels are widely read (or films are widely viewed, or paintings widely seen) will benefit from this activity. To say more, one would have to know more about the kinds of novels, the conditions under which they are read, etc. The practice of reading a novel as literature as I have described it - a creative response to the work's singularity, alterity and inventiveness - is valuable in a different sense: as an experience of openness to otherness, conveyed by the staging in language of human needs, desires, emotions, acts, powers, weaknesses. It is thus an inherently ethical practice. A novel that presents characters facing ethical dilemmas works, as literature, by taking the reader through the experience of those dilemmas in the course of their linguistic evocation, whether or not their resolution in the novel presents a satisfactory moral conclusion, and without leaving the reader with any particular moral guidance. In my view, a culture that valorizes Substance #120, Vol. 38, no. 3, 2009</page><page sequence="7">24 Attridge interviewed by Zalloua this practice is a healthy one, since openness to the other, a willingness to be challenged and changed, is a vital quality for an individual and for a society. But it is important to be aware that the outcome of such open- ness can never be guaranteed - that is what openness to alterity means. So whereas my first set of reasons for valuing novels can, by and large, be relied on; this one is a matter of risk. Now, your question is about the compatibility of these two kinds of practice, or, more specifically, of the extraction of moral lessons and the ethical reading I have described. Fm not a purist about these matters. I believe it's possible for a reading of Cry, the Beloved Country to be at once a powerful experience of the otherness of other lives, of their emotions, antagonisms, loves (and of the power of language to stage these things) and a model of human interaction allowing the reader to carry away an important, nuanced moral lesson about racism. (Often, of course, works are praised on the grounds of a moral lesson so banal that it has no need of the complexities of literature - one can be sure, in such cases, that the work's value, if it has any, lies elsewhere.) Such a reading could at the same time involve the acquisition of useful knowledge about South Africa in the 1940s, of the views of Alan Paton, of the dialects of Johannesburg, of the craft of novel-making, and so on. It's true that if one allows the extraction of moral meaning, or of historical knowledge, or of clues about the art of writing to dominate one's reading, the work is less likely to be experienced as literature; and such a reading could be said to lack an ethical dimension. But to read the work as literature certainly doesn't preclude reading in these other ways at the same time. Indeed, they can feed into a responsible reading, since novels may stage the construction of moral lessons, the search for knowledge, and even their own crafting. In a similar vein, I have argued that Coetzee's fiction, if read as allegory, is not being read as literature; but if read as literature, allegorizing is one of its most interesting staged processes. And this does not mean, let me emphasize again, that reading it as allegory is somehow wrong - it may in fact enhance the reader's enjoyment of the play with allegorization that the novels undertake. Zahi Zalloua: In a telling parenthesis on -page 131, you state an unwillingness to extend your definition of literature to literary works that lend themselves to predictable readings, works that arguably lack any sense of formal innovation or inventiveness: There is, of course, a certain force exercised by a work, and by a way of reading works, that may serve to sustain and strengthen a reader's existing modes of understanding and feeling: my rather specialized use of the term 'literature' would not extend to such a text or way of reading. Other critics. . . have used terms like 'stock response' and 'senti- mentality' to characterize this type of writing and this type of response. Substance #120, Vol. 38, no. 3, 2009</page><page sequence="8">Ethical Debates in Literary Studies 25 You seem to nuance your position on a strict division between singular works and non-singular works by emphasizing the reading of these works rather than the works themselves. In your book J. M. Coetzee and the Ethics of Reading, you devote a fascinating chapter to Coetzee's Foe and its ambivalent relation to the canon. I wonder however whether you could elaborate a little more on the inventiveness of the literary work and the processes of canonization. In "Derrida: The Reader," Simon Critchley aptly remarks: " Auto-deconstruction is arguably the conditio sine qua non for a major text-canonicity is deconstructibility" (4). Are you suggesting likewise that any canonical work is by definition inventive, or, at the very least, that for its canonicity (or the recognition of its canonicity) to persist, the work must continue to challenge and inspire its readers? That it must reinforce and unsettle its readers' cultural horizon of intelligibility, or what you call "idioculture"? Derak Attridge: Without attempting to unravel the complex strands that make up the notion of "the canon" - something one would have to do in a longer answer to your question - one can venture the suggestion that works which become firmly established as canonical are works that bear considerable re-reading, both by individuals and across histprical time (and perhaps across cultural and linguistic distance as well). Works whose chief source of value and readerly pleasure is informational, moral (in the sense described above), linguistic, or theological yield most of what they have to offer in one reading. It is the work that has most to offer as an event, an event that opens onto new horizons, tests the limits of what can be thought, challenges settled preconceptions, that benefits most from re-readings. Although this event can occur only to individuals, it can also occur more widely in a culture - because the individual is a nexus within that culture (this is what I called an "idioculture," on the model of "idio- lect"). If the work sustains this quality over a period of time - and many of the forces that allow some works to fade and others to remain alive are extraliterary, with chance playing a certain role - it continues to be read. Similarly, the work that pleases its original readership by confirm- ing prejudices, following familiar patterns, satisfying long-established habits, is unlikely to survive once those prejudices, patterns and habits cease to be widespread. It remains something of a puzzle that works which arrive on the cultural scene as challenges to orthodoxy - and most of what we think of as the great works of the past did this - can continue to provide readers with the experience of newness and otherness long after the conditions governing their appearance and initial reception have undergone huge changes. In part, we can find an explanation in the long duration of as- sumptions, values and habits of thought, so that Lysistrata or Chaucer's Pardoner can still take a new reader by surprise by their departure from Substance #120, Vol. 38, no. 3, 2009</page><page sequence="9">26 Attridge interviewed by Zalloua the familiar; in part, we can point to chance repetitions in cultural his- tory that produce echoes of earlier conditions, so that, for example, the metaphysical poets come to seem contemporary in the early twentieth century after undergoing something of an eclipse in the nineteenth. And at every point, what we are talking about are readings, not inert texts; so new modes of reading can revive old works that did not respond to older modes. (Coetzee has an interesting essay entitled, after Eliot, "What is a Classic?/' in which he argues that the test of classic status for a work of art is survival through the test of critique: skeptical critics are as much the creators of the classics as affirming ones. Responsible reading of the kind I describe may well involve negative reactions - other than mere boredom or failure of interest.) Of course, there are other factors operating in the establishment and revision of canons; one only has to think of the role gender has played both in earlier versions of the canon and in the late twentieth-century shifts. Zahi Zalloua: Would this conception of a self-contesting canon entail a different kind of canon watch, or what Pierre Bourdieu describes as the faithful patrol- ling of the "magical division" separating high from low art, and the "cultural consecration" afforded by it? Would an understanding of the literary canon as profoundly un-ruly avoid or complicate the traditional ways canonical works are frequently promoted, taught, and deployed, consciously or unconsciously, through "strategies of distinction" (Distinction 66), strategies that inculcate in students, or readers more generally, not only a love for high culture but also a sense of cultural superiority? Derk Attridge: I first read Distinction when I was writing Peculiar Lan- guage in the mid-1980s, and was pleased to find an empirically-grounded sociological account of the cultural constitution of the "literary" that I was interested in from a different perspective. I found Bourdieu's account of the sociology of high culture convincing; and there is no doubt that the persistence of the canon is partly an effect of the widely-felt desire to ac- cumulate cultural capital. However, I would resist the implication that seems to follow from this account of canonization: that if we were aware of all the factors in play in signaling to potential readers that a work is "high art" we could predict which works will be canonized, and we could produce (or we could program a computer to produce) such works. Hindsight allows us to come up with theories explaining why such-and- such a work garnered universal applause; but our theories don't seem to have much predictive value. What I tried to show in writing on Foe was that an anti-canonical gesture can constitute a powerful claim to canon- SubStance #120, Vol. 38, no. 3, 2009</page><page sequence="10">Ethical Debates in Literary Studies 27 ization - whereas a work written with all the conventional hallmarks of canonicity but no testing of canonized values or assumptions is likely to fade from view. My argument in Peculiar Language - that successive attempts to specify exactly what distinguishes literary from non-literary discourse always fail because they require a non-specifiable element that undermines the project of exact specification - would hold here too: the sociological apparatus that would determine the divide between high and low culture is itself put in question by that which constitutes art as art. It may explain a great deal; it doesn't explain what is most important - most important to me, that is, not what is most important to a sociologist! (I would say the same of Franco Moretti's valiant efforts in historicizing novels en masse rather than through significant exemplars.) Zahi Zalloua: To what extent is your understanding of the inventive work a reworking of Barthes's "writerly" text, a rethinking of aesthetics in ethical terms? Or to borrow from Barthes's The Pleasure of the Text, is there an ethics of aesthetic jouissance? Derek Attridge: Barthes's works of the late '60s and early '70s had a strong impact on my thinking, as I too was moving from a structuralist inter- est in the codes governing literary writing and reading to an interest in what it is about literary writing that resists the enterprise of codification. Barthes seemed to be making too sharp a distinction between "readable" and "writable" texts (I don't think "readerly" and "writerly" are very happy translations), but S/Z complicated the picture by showing that the tradition of readable fiction could be read as writable. I worry that my account of literature, like Barthes's (and Derrida's) may seem to favor modernism over, say, nineteenth-century realism; and I need to insist that the great works of Austen or Thackeray, Balzac or Dostoevsky all qualify resoundingly as inventive, singular texts that engage with alter- ity in vital and pleasure-giving ways. So with this understanding, I'd be prepared to agree that Barthes's puissance (and of course the word is used in many different ways by other writers) becomes, in my thinking, a matter of literary ethics. I do part from Barthes in finding a place for the author, or at least for a concept of authoredness: a text that seemed to emanate from no author (or group or series of authors) would require a different kind of response from the ethical one I am talking about. This is because I take one's responsibility as a reader to be responsibility for and before the singular inventiveness of the author of the work I am reading - hence my preference for "work" over "text." Substance #120, Vol. 38, no. 3, 2009</page><page sequence="11">28 Attridge interviewed by Zalloua Zahi Zalloua: To continue with the Barthesian intertext, your conception of a responsive and responsible reader seems to complicate Barthes's model of a pas- sivel active reading (along with its two types of readers, consumer and producer). Yet I wonder whether there isn't a way to reconsider the aesthetic will-to-invent located at heart of Barthesian hermeneutics: I try to create, to invent a meaning from independent materials, which I liberate from their historical, doctrinal 'truth' -&gt; I take the referential bits (in fact, bits of reading), and I submit them to an anamorphosis: a process known to all mannerist artists. (The Neutral 65) Barthes is of course not alone in advocating this interpretive ideal. Foucault, in an interview, responds to a question about the accuracy of his reading of Nietzsche by calling into question the very logic of faithfulness: For myself, I prefer to utilise the writers I like. The only valid tribute to thought such as Nietzsche's is precisely to use it, to deform it, to make it groan and protest. And if commentators then say that I am be- ing faithful or unfaithful to Nietzsche, that is of absolutely no interest. (Power /Knowledge 53-4) How do you conceive the demands of faithfulness, and the unavoidable risk of betrayal, in an ethics of reading? Derek Attridge: Much has been written on the necessary infidelity of the responsible reading; the binary faithful /unfaithful can't survive a notion of responsibility that demands both submission to the other and inven- tiveness of response. One can think of it in terms of Derrida's metaphor of signature and countersignature: to countersign is to validate, under- write, be prepared in future to answer for the signature of the other, and in this sense is a mark of absolute fidelity. Yet to countersign is to sign with one's own unique signature, to meet one's obligation to the other by asserting one's otherness. It would hardly do to countersign with a copy of the other's signature. Transferring the metaphor to literary criticism (or indeed the event of creative, responsible reading), a response that does justice to the singularity of the work is one that succeeds in finding a way to affirm that singularity by means of an answering singularity. The irresponsible response is singular without affirming the work it claims to respond to: it is merely unfaithful. But the response that repeats the work in terms available to everybody, that fails to reflect the singularity of the work in relation to the specificity of the respondent's place, time, and particular history is merely faithful. To go back to what I was saying earlier, the best response would include complete faithfulness - an accurate understanding of the work on its own terms, making full use of the interpretive resources available -but would go beyond this account, would take a risk that could only be justified (or not) in the responses of other readers. Substance #120, Vol. 38, no. 3, 2009</page><page sequence="12">Ethical Debates in Literary Studies 29 Zahi Zalloua: Linked to the question of betrayal is that of the author. In today's intellectual climate, it seems no longer controversial to talk about the flesh-and- blood author or the implied author. In The Singularity of Literature, you allude to Booth's notion of the book or the author as friend. JLthical critics -particularly of the Neo- Aristotelian and rhetorical tradition- privilege this metaphor of friendship, dismissing poststructuralist critics and their "Death of the Author" thesis as anti-humanists and nihilists who undermine the very institution of literary studies. I always found this line of criticism inadequate, for it fails to acknowledge, or often simply fails to read, what was being objected to by Barthes and Foucault. Sometimes it is the authors themselves who resist their interpel- lation as authorities. I'm thinking of Alain Robbe-Grillet and more recently Coetzee: "The author's position is the weakest of all. Neither can he claim the critic's saving distance- that would be a simple lie- nor can he pretend to be what he was when he wrote- that is, when he was not himself" (Doubling the Point 206). Your own work on Joyce, Coetzee, and Derrida reveals, however, that it is possible to engage with authors and their works without subscribing to either the "author function" or an anthropomorphic model of literary exchange. Couldn't Booth's metaphor of friendship be reappropriated toward a different end, rethought through Derrida's Politique de l'amitié, where friendship does not simply foreground intimacy but alterity as well? Derek Attridge: Absolutely. I was always a bit hesitant in using a rhetoric of strangeness and challenge in describing the operation of the literary work, and I've tried to qualify this by talking also about the role of fa- miliarity. That's to say, a work may strike the reader as extraordinary or outlandish, challenging the norms of reading in an obvious way. But it may work by introducing only the slightest shading into the bright world of the familiar; it may hint at the uncanny, or even seem too brightly familiar to be quite convincing. Or it may offer itself to the uncreative reader as entirely within the expected, but to the creative reader as testing its limits. I commented earlier on the importance of avoiding an overvaluing of modernist art, whose challenge is so much more obvious. The idea of the work of art as friend and companion, then, seems a cliché that omits exactly what is important. If, however, you take friend- ship to be a more complicated business, as explored by Derrida in The Politics of Friendship, it becomes a much more appropriate metaphor. It would certainly apply to those nineteenth-century works that seem, on the face of it, to exude a friendly welcome.
