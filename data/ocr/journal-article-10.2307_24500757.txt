Introduction Subject Areas: ,. The discovery of mirror neurons provides neuroscientific evidence for what we cognition, developmental biology, neuroscience 3 r call vicarious activations: the neural substrates of our own actions are vicar iously activated while witnessing the actions of others through vision [1-4] Keywords: or sound [3,4], Twenty years after their discovery, the function of mirror neur mirror neurons, Hebbian learning, active ons is still heatedly debated [5-9]. Here, we do not address the question of their inference, vicarious activations, mind-reading, function, but rather explore how they could develop. Monkeys have mirror projection neurons that respond to the sound and vision of crumpling a plastic bag [3,4] and human premotor cortices respond to sounds like the hiss of opening a Coca-Cola can [10].

We explore how this refined understanding of Hebbian learn ing helps us understand how mirror neurons emerge and suggests how mirror neurons become a form of active predictive mind reading. Finally, we argue that vicarious activations also occur in somatosensory and emotional cortices and that the same Hebbian learning rules could explain the emergence of mirror-like neurons in these brain regions. 2. What is meant by Hebbian learning (a) Historically The term Hebbian learning derives from the work of Donald Hebb [11], who pro posed a neurophysiological account of learning and memory based on a simple principle: 'When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell Β and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased' (p. 62). A careful reading of Hebb's principle reveals his understanding of the importance of causality and consistency. He writes not ι 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved. Hebbian learning and predictive mirror neurons for actions, sensations and emotions Christian Keysers1-2 and Valeria Gazzola1· Spike-timing-dependent plasticity is considered the neurophysiological basis of Hebbian learning and has been shown to be sensitive to both contingency and contiguity between pre- and postsynaptic activity. Here, we will exam ine how applying this Hebbian learning rule to a system of interconnected neurons in the presence of direct or indirect re-afference (e.g. seeing/hearing one's own actions) predicts the emergence of mirror neurons with predictive properties. In this framework, we analyse how mirror neurons become a dynamic system that performs active inferences about the actions of others and allows joint actions despite sensorimotor delays. We explore how this system performs a projection of the self onto others, with egocentric biases to contribute to mind-reading. Finally, we argue that Hebbian learning pre dicts mirror-like neurons for sensations and emotions and review evidence for the presence of such vicarious activations outside the motor system. ι 2014 The Author(s)</page><page sequence="2">that two neurons need to fire together to increase the efficiency ^7 of their connection but that one neuron needs to repeatedly ^ +^q (consistency) take part in firing (causality) the other.

As Hebb had predicted, causation is thus the key to synaptic plasticity. (c) Alternative definitions Other experiments have refined our understanding of the By contrast, in the psychological literature, some authors still consistency required for synaptic plasticity to take place. Bauer equate Hebbian learning to the mnemonic approximation et al. [17] used a standard STDP protocol, with the presynaptic 'what fires together wires togethers'. We explore in particular neuron stimulated 5-10 ms prior to the postsynaptic neuron. this alternative definition used by Cooper et al. [19], as an Applying 10 of these paired stimulations, they found strong example, because that paper tries to argue against Hebbian potentiation of the synapse (figure 2a). Repeating the protocol, learning in the mirror neuron system and understanding but intermixing unpaired stimulations in which only the post- the origin of the misunderstanding is important. They synaptic neuron was stimulated cancelled the potentiation write: 'Hebb famously said that "Cells that fire together, despite having applied the exact same 10 paired trials (figure wire together" and, more formally, "any two cells or systems 2b). This indicates that contingency is critical for STDP: in of cells that are repeatedly active at the same time will tend to figure 2a, the presynaptic activity predicts the postsynaptic become 'associated/ so that activity in one facilitates activity activity ( p( post|pre) = 1, p(post|no pre) = 0), in figure 2b the in the other". Thus, Keysers and Perrett's Hebbian perspec presynaptic firing is not informative (p(post|pre) = p(post|no tive implies that contiguity is sufficient for MNS pre) = 0.5). This fleshes out what Hebb intuitively described development; that it does not also depend on contingency', as 'repeatedly and persistently takes part' and echoes the laws We think there are a number of misunderstandings in this of associative learning [18]. Bauer et al. [17] then shifted the statement. First, Hebb himself never wrote 'Cells that fire 10 unpaired stimulations to after the 10 paired ones and still together, wire together'. This mnemonic phrase was first intro found no potentiation (figure 2c). Delivering the 10 unpaired duced by Carla Shatz [12] in an article for the Scientific events 15 or 50 min after the paired events, however, no American aimed at lay public. Second, what is quoted as longer cancelled the STDP (figure 2d). Hence, the unpaired Hebb's formal postulate 'any two cells ...', is not. Hebb used stimulations were integrated with the paired stimulations if this sentence to summarize old ideas: he wrote 'The general they occurred in the 7 min window it took to apply 10 paired idea is an old one, that any two cells ...'

Both the mne and 10 unpaired trials, but not if they occurred much later. monic phrase misattributed to Hebb and Hebb's summary of STDP thus depends on both contiguity and contingency and old ideas occlude the causal element of Hebb's true postulate uses a very narrow time window of approximately 40 ms to 'When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell Β and determine whether the presynaptic neuron took part in causing repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth a particular postsynaptic action potential (contiguity) and a process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells much longer, approximately 10 min, window to determine such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased' whether the presynaptic activity is informative about the post- ([11]/ p· 62).

In this section, we will adopt a contingency (e.g. p(sight of grasping| grasping execution) &gt; relatively coarse temporal resolution of about 1 s for the first p(sight of throwing|grasping execution)).

In this sense, we propose that our genetic that parents often imitate the vocalizations and facial make-up might facilitate the development of mirror neurons expressions of their babies, and babies are known to spend for facial expressions, but not (or at least not generally) by much of their time looking at their own hands and the facial pre-wiring the STS-PM connections to have newborns expressions (which are often imitative) of their carers (see [32] equipped with mature mirror-neurons for facial expressions, and section 5 of [37] for a review).
