<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHYTOALEXINS Phytoalexins, edited by John A. Bailey and John W. Mansfield. Halsted Press, A Division of John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1982, 334 p., illus., $75.95 (81-13192). From an anthropomorphic perspective, one of the great design flaws of plants, next to their lack of mobility, is their lack of an immune system, as we enjoy, with its highly antigen- specific antibodies and sensitized lympho- cytes. Yet, it has long been suspected that plants have developed their own means of fending off infectious agents and acquiring resistance to disease, primarily through the production of defensive substances. These "warding-off agents in plants" were dubbed "phytoalexins," via direct translation from the Greek, by Muiller and Borg in 1940. Twen- ty years elapsed between the proposal of the term and the isolation and characterization of the first phytoalexin, pisatin, from the com- mon garden pea (Pisum sativum), the same humble plant that gave rise to the study of modern genetics. In the 20 years since the discovery of pisatin, phytoalexin research has burgeoned at a breathtaking pace and has expanded in many directions. This book represents the first attempt to com- pile information on all aspects of the study of phytoalexins. Among its contributors are many widely acknowledged leaders in the field. It is logically divided into four sections. The first chapter, by B. JI Deverall, is an excellent account of the historical develop- ment of concept and practice of disease resist- ance in plants as conferred by phytoalexins. The next three chapters together present a comprehensive catalogue of the distribution and chemical diversity of phytoalexins. The arrangement is by plant taxonomic family, a reasonable approach, since phytoalexins tend toward chemical uniformity within a family. The completeness of the treatment is exempli- fied by Ingham's chapter on phytoalexins of the Leguminosae, containing almost 40 pages of tables with information on sources, struc- ture, spectral characteristics, melting points, fungitoxicity, and chromatography of over 100 compounds. Chapters 5 through 7 address phytoalexin physiology and biochemistry, considering, in sequence, synthesis, metabo- lism, and toxicity. These chapters lack noth- ing in terms of comprehensive coverage; Stoessl's chapter on biosynthesis has almost 200 cited references in the bibliography. The following two chapters describe the ecological interactions of plant and pathogen with re- spect to dynamics of phytoalexin production, accumulation, and acquisition of disease resistance. Finally, editors Mansfield and Bai- ley provide a chapter presenting current prob- lems and future prospects in phytoalexin research. According to the editors, this book is intended primarily for "research workers, university teachers and advanced undergraduates with an interest in plant pathology, plant biochem- istry and chemistry." I suggest that this vol- ume will be an invaluable reference for stu- dents of many other disciplines as well, ranging from those with a purely theoretical interest, such as botanists and ecologists studying parallel systems, and those with ap- plied interests, such as industrial researchers seeking novel approaches to environmentally safe and economic disease control in plants. While, by and large, the volume is not intend- ed for leisurely "fireside" reading (much of the writing is technical and dry), it is certainly a timely, comprehensive, and accurate sourcebook for a new and exciting avenue of research.
