AN EARLY CLASSIC CENTER IN THE PUUC REGION New data from Chac II, Yucatan, Mexico Michael P. Smyth/ José Ligorred Perramon,b David Ortegón Zapata,b and Pat Farreilc department of Anthropology, Rollins College, 1000 Holt Avenue, Winter Park, FL 32789-4499, USA bCentro Regional de Yucatán, Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, Apartado Postal 1015, Mérida, Yucatan, Mexico 97310 department of Geography, University of Minnesota, Duluth, Duluth, MN SS812, USA Abstract A comprehensive site survey and excavation program took place in 1995 and 1996 at the Maya center of Chac II (Chac) located within the Puuc hills region of Yucatan, Mexico. This work presents a body of evidence in support of the idea that Chac was an important center beginning in the Early Classic period (a.d. 300-600) that experienced significant foreign contacts. In addition, multifaceted data from surface, soil, architectural, and excavated contexts are addressing major questions pertaining to architectural and ceramic chronologies, the founding of the Puuc stoneworking tradition, site activity areas, and patterns of land use. Furthermore, dating indicates that Chac predated Sayil and that the two sites have a close geographical relationship. Also, terrace agriculture appears to have been widespread at Chac, contrasting greatly with Sayil where intensive gardening was widely practiced. In light of the new information from Chac, we argue that the traditional models of Puuc origins are inadequate. Investigations at a major Early Classic site in the heart of the Puuc region suggests that the region's rise was indigenous coupled with external ties to foreign groups reaching to central Mexico. The site of Chac is thus taking on strategic importance for understanding the origins of Puuc civilization, providing a rare opportunity to study a Maya center that was on the brink of urbanism in one of the most urban ancient Maya areas. These new data are helping to elucidate the nature of Maya urbanism in the Puuc region and establish the kinds of cultural links that existed between the northern Maya Lowlands and the rest of Mesoamerica during the Classic period. Chac II (Chac), a pre-Terminal Classic Maya center in Puuc re gion of northern Yucatan, Mexico, appears to hold great poten tial for better understanding the origins of Maya urbanism, politico-economic organization, and cultural-ecological adapta tions. Importantly, recent excavations at Chac are providing finer chronological controls of such archaeological remains as architec ture and ceramics to reconstruct the development of this region's great urban constellation. Research at Chac, therefore, is affording a special opportunity to study an early Maya center that was on the brink of urbanism in one of the most urban areas of the ancient Maya world. In addition, the mounting evidence for foreign con tacts at Chac can help to clarify the role of cultural interactions between the northern Maya lowlands and the rest of Mesoamerica during the Classic period. Chac has turned out to be a larger, more complex, and different kind of urban center than previously believed. First, architectural data, ceramic information, and absolute dating indicate that the site was founded in the Early Classic period (a.d. 300-600), with continued occupation through the Late Classic period (a.d. 600 800). Second, settlement patterns and soil data show that Chac was not a satellite settlement of its nearby neighbor Sayil, as originally supposed; the two sites seem to be largely separate in time and space. Third, soil analysis suggests that terrace agriculture was widely practiced at Chac, in contrast to the pattern of urban gar dening reconstructed at Sayil. These preliminary results are based on data gathered from in tegrated, multidisciplinary methods of site-scale survey. These methods included surface collection, artifact analysis, and com puter coding; soil testing and chemical analysis, architectural mapping and feature coding; and a program of test excavation, architectural excavation and building restoration. The data re ported here suggest that there were significant cultural develop ments and pan-Mesoamerican contacts in the Puuc region long before the Terminal Classic period. In light of these new data from Chac, the traditional models of Puuc origins and the role that the region played in Terminal Classic Yucatan are discussed. MODELS OF PUUC ORIGINS One of the most important and least-understood questions in Maya archaeology centers on the origins of the great Puuc cities. Al though there is evidence to suggest that the region was settled some time during the Middle Preclassic period (850-300 B.C.) (Ball 1979), the major thrust of cultural development has traditionally been seen as occurring during the Terminal Classic period (a.d. 800-1000). At that time, the Puuc region became one of the lead ing areas of Maya civilization. Key issues of how and why the Puuc region arose, however, are poorly understood. For example, was the Puuc florescence predominantly a local phenomenon or did nonlocal processes and events significantly shape the region's 233</page><page sequence="2">234 Smyth et al. rapid development? Does the region contain major pre-Terminal Classic settlement, and, if so, what were these sites like and how were they organized politically and economically? Traditional models forwarded to explain the rise of the Puuc cities propose large-scale migrations of southern Maya popula tions to the north at the end of the Classic period (Morley 1956; Willey and Shimkin 1973) or a restructuring of old trading routes fostered by the expansion of Chontal Maya merchants from the southern Gulf Coast (Ball 1974; Thompson 1970; Willey 1973). An alternative model emphasizes local development—centering on fertile Puuc soils to sustain a breadbasket region, a food ex porter to the densely populated but agriculturally poor coastal plains of northern Yucatan (Barrera Rubio 1982; Kurjack et al. 1979; Matheny 1978). After decades of research, however, these models are largely untested and remain open to debate. Appropriately, Ball calls for renewed research efforts to address the problem of the Puuc origins and events occurring before the Terminal Classic period: I strongly urge those now collecting data or readying them selves to do so to reconsider the matter of Puuc origins as a fundamental and to date not yet satisfactorily addressed ques tion for the region [emphasis in original],. .. over the last twenty years it has become abundantly clear that the Early Classic pe riod of a.d. 200 to 550 comprised and represents one of the most complex, regionalized, developmentally significant, and poorly documented temporal spans [Ball 1994:394-395]. Along a strategic route and at a turbulent time, the Puuc region was certainly effected by Mesoamerica's "great transition": the fall of Teotihuacan and the Classic Maya collapse. Teotihuacan's pres ence in the southern Maya lowlands during the Early to Late Clas sic periods (a.d. 300-700) and Maya influences at the Epiclassic conquest states (a.d. 700-900) of Cacaxtla and Xochicalco are well known to Mesoamericanists. Less understood is the nature of Teotihuacan and other early central Mexican influences across northern Yucatan, despite there being tantalizing evidence at Becan, Xel-Ha, Acanceh, and Dzibilchaltun (Andrews IV and Andrews V 1980; Andrews V 1979; Ball 1977; Lombardo de Ruiz 1987; Miller 1991). Hopefully, the new work at Chac will help to shed more light on these important historical and processual questions. BACKGROUND Chac II is located 1.7 km northwest of the North Palace at Sayil and approximately 500 m west of the modern "Ruta" Puuc high way (Figure 1). Classified by the Atlas arqueológico as a Rank 4 settlement (Garza Tarazona de Gonzales S. and Kurjack 1980), not to be confused with Chac I (Gruta de Chac)—a deep cave ap proximately 2 km to the north—Chac II was allegedly first visited by John Stephens in 1842 (Stephens 1963). Based on his descrip tion of the site, it seems likely that Stephens actually visited one of several other sites near the historic Rancho Chac, not Chac II. However, Teobert Maler definitely visited the site in 1887, drew several rough sketches of partially standing buildings, and dubbed the site "Chikin-Sayil," or West-Sayil (Maler 1997). Harry Pol lock (1980) mentions the site, but does not include any architec tural data in his book on Puuc architecture. George Andrews visited the site in 1984 and gathered data on three standing stone build ings. A more detailed sketch map of the site core was made by Gair Tourtellot (Sabloff et al. 1985) in the same year, and Nicho las Dunning updated a number of architectural details of Tourtel lot's sketch map in 1986 (Dunning 1989, 1992). As part of a large scale surface survey at Sayil in 1990 and 1992, Michael Smyth and Christopher Dore located a Maya causeway connecting Sayil to the main group at Chac (Smyth and Dore 1992a). Subsequently, preliminary reconnaissance was undertaken by Michael Smyth in 1994 and followed by full-scale research in 1995 and 1996 (Smyth 1995; Smyth, Ligorred P., Euan C., Castillos B., Ortegón, and Far rell 1996; Smyth, Ligorred P., Alcantara, Ballesteros, Ortegón Z., and Farrell 1996). Karl Mayer visited the Chac site in 1995 and photographed a "red hands" mural reported earlier by Smyth and Dore in 1992 (Mayer 1995; Smyth and Dore 1993). Previous survey work at Sayil provided new insights into pre Hispanic Maya adaptations to the region's natural and cultural landscapes. It has been shown that spatial and contextual data on artifacts and soils are essential for the reconstruction of activities across site landscapes and can provide independent data for as signing behavioral meaning to formal aspects of architecture (Sabloff and Tourtellot 1991; Smyth and Dore 1992a, 1992b, 1994; Smyth, Dore, and Dunning 1995; Tourtellot and Sabloff 1994). This kind of research enables one to sample entire landscapes: a key element for understanding variability in Maya community or ganization at sites of differing size; information that is critical for understanding such cultural phenomena as the "collapse" and "flo rescence" of Classic Maya civilization. Using this surface survey data, we found that Sayil was a large, complex urban center with diverse residential neighborhoods, a major ceramic-making bar rio, and intensive site-wide garden agriculture (Smyth and Dore 1994; Smyth, Dore, and Dunning 1995; Smyth, Dore, Neff, and Glascock 1995). The survey at Sayil located a Maya causeway link ing Chac to Sayil, which suggested the possibility that Chac was a major suburb of Sayil, although now Chac clearly predates Sayil. It was argued, therefore, that an investigation at Chac using the same methods developed and refined at Sayil would provide valu able multidisciplinary and comparative data about how Maya cit ies of various sizes were internally and hierarchically organized. In addition, we sought to better understand the timing of urban origins in this region and how large Maya populations adapted to the challenging, semiarid, tropical environment of Yucatan's rugged hill country. 1995 FIELD RESEARCH Surface Survey To document urban phenomena and research human tropical ad aptations, the 1995 Chac Project completed surface collection within an intersite zone greater than 70 ha between northwest Sayil and the Chac site, particularly covering the main Chac group (Fig ure 2). The surface-collection survey consisted of l,2393-X-3-m collection units spaced at 25-m intervals. The survey focused on the area surrounding the Chac-Sayil intersite causeway, to deter mine if the settlement zones were continuous and, therefore, one and the same site. Within this area, natural topography and most architectural features were mapped in detail. North of Sayil, 32 ha were sampled by 512 collection units, and no substantial architec tural or surface remains were noted. To bypass the disturbed area around the modern "Ruta" Puuc highway, a 600-m-long west survey transect was run between Sayil and Chac. The transect pro duced no visible architecture and no surface artifacts.

The survey transect, reconnaissance survey, and previous Sayil surveys (Killion et al. 1989; Sabloff and Tourtellot 1991; Sabloff et al. 1985; Smyth and Dore 1992) all indicate that the area be tween Sayil and Chac has virtually no settlement remains and few surface artifacts, except for the causeway and a small feature clus ter near Sayil's North Group. This unoccupied area appears to have been some sort of buffer zone that separated the two site territo ries. This interpretation is supported by the low incidence of evi dence for settlement between the sites, the fact that soil analysis indicates that this intersite zone was not under intensive cultiva tion (see later), and a feature cluster consisting of twin, circular pyramids marking entry into the main Chac Group (see Figure 2; also Carrasco V. 1991). These data support the notion that Chac was an independent center. Significant surface remains were not encountered until about 200 m northeast of the Chac Palace, where settlement and surface artifacts rise dramatically. Across the urban zone of Chac, 703 col lection units produced 3,404 potsherds and 11 lithic artifacts; all but 3 sherds were classified as Cehpech (a.d. 800-1000) ceramic wares. Ceramic sequences (and architectural styles) in the Puuc region have not been rigorously dated by chronometric methods; it remains unclear when the Cehpech ceramic tradition began (Fig ure 3).

Classic-period ceramic and architectural chronology for the Puuc region (adapted from Andrews [1994] and Smith [1971]]. covers an estimated total site area of up to 3 km2. Our survey in dicates that Chac settlement continues at least 1 km north-northwest toward the Gruta de Chac and its associated settlement (Andrews IV 1965; Pollock 1980). We have reason to believe that Chac also extends 1 km farther west because no evidence of any settlement drop-off was encountered beyond the western edge of our survey area. The same kind of continuous settlement pattern was found to the south, and strongly indicates that Chac extends another 1 km— reaching the Column and Xul groups (Dunning 1989). Soil Testing Following soil research at Sayil, soil testing and analysis for soil pH, total soil phosphates, and soil taxonomy were completed for the 70-ha area of intensive survey. Soil testing took place within survey collection units to the north and northwest of Sayil. In con trast to soil analysis from other parts of Sayil, many of the marginal quality tzekel soils and more fertile kancab-tzekel and katicab soils show little evidence of the phosphate enrichment necessary for sus tained, intensive cultivation (Smyth, Dore, and Dunning 1995; see Dunning [ 1991 ] for a discussion of the agricultural quality of Puuc soils). In addition, few units tested higher than the Puuc soil av erage of 7.5 pH, and not a single unit reached or exceeded 8 pH (Dunning 1991)—an indicator of intensive human activity (Barba and Manzanilla 1987; Manzanilla and Barba 1990; Smyth 1990, 1991). The data, therefore, show surprisingly little evidence for large-scale, intensive garden agriculture between Chac and Sayil, even though the potential for it existed. The area around Chac contains three of the most common fertile soil types (pusluum, kancab, and kancab-tzekel) found at Sayil, but with much lower percentages of phosphate enrichment. At Sayil, for example, 81 % of pusluum, 74% of kancab, and 76% of kancab tzekel soils had high phosphate values (&gt;600 ppm P), whereas the corresponding percentages for the same soils at Chac were 15, 5, and 20, respectively (Farrell and Smyth 1997). Chacluum, a deep, dark mollisol that is more abundant at Chac than Sayil, appears to have been exploited for cultivation purposes near residential loca tions. Exhibiting elevated phosphate levels, the cultivation pref erence for chacluum soils appears to be related to a purposeful cultivation strategy exploiting different types of agricultural soils than those at Sayil. The identification of 10 slope terraces, which are rare at Sayil and most Puuc sites (Dunning 1991), further sug gests that Chac fanners emphasized agricultural adaptations dif ferent from those of their Sayil counterparts. Architectural Mapping Twenty large architectural groups were mapped, or sketched, at a scale of 1:250 using a Sokkia full-station electronic distance measuring transit (EDM) augmented by compass and tape survey. In addition, mapped settlement remains were coded for a contex tual analysis following Sabloff and Tourtellot (1991); there were 25 additional feature groups located, as well. The 1995 map data cover more than 50 ha and consist of more than 300 individual features, including numerous platforms, stone buildings, founda tion braces, five pyramids (ranging from 3 to 20 m tall), a central acropolis, seven plazas, the three-story (20+ room) Chac Palace, the Sayil-Chac intersite causeway and an internal causeway, and dozens of underground water cisterns (chultunes) and stone ba sins (Figure 4). There are also numerous, substantial settlement remains outside the completed survey area. The high quality, scale of construction, and unusual architectural characteristics, how ever, suggest that Chac was an early Puuc settlement of consider able importance. Of the major building groups at Chac, three large architectural complexes warrant special mention: the Chac Palace, the Central Acropolis, and the Great Pyramid Plaza. The Chac Palace is a rare example of a three-story building (another being at Sayil) in the eastern Puuc region that seems to conform to the Early Puuc style (Andrews 1986), stylistically dated to the Late Classic period or earlier; there are visible elements of the temporally later Classic Puuc stonework on the south side of the first story and on the third story rooms (Figure 5). A minimum of 22 rooms is distributed in a radial pattern organized into three separate stories: the first-story houses at least 11 rooms, the second story contains eight rooms, and the third story three rooms. Two small second-story rooms on the northeast and southeast are constructed directly above first story rooms, forming a rare example of "true" stories rather than the usual Maya pattern of terracing multistory buildings and con structing stone rooms over solid-core masonry. It is perhaps no coincidence that the northeastern rooms of the first and second stories contain the remnants of painted murals; the latter is the red hands mural mentioned above (see Mayer 1995). The partially standing third story of the Chac Palace has three rooms with mul tiple, round column doorways and interior, transverse doorways. To the east is a small plaza with a large conical stone altar, a build ing platform supporting a three-room vaulted range structure, and two small vaulted buildings on the north and south sides. The Central Acropolis is the largest, most complex architec tural group at Chac (Figure 6). A huge basal platform faced with roughly shaped boulders covering nearly 2 ha with 12 surface levels, more than 30 superstructures, and numerous features including</page><page sequence="6">238 Smyth et al. Figure 4. Digitized map showing the major architectural groups of central Chac. 6 stone stelae, 5 chultunes, 14 stone basins, and 4 stone altars, the Acropolis is defined by three distinct plazas. The central (Grecas) plaza is on the lowest level of the Acropolis and contains a north temple-pyramid (approximately 10 m tall) with tenoned blocks carved in bas-relief exhibiting alternating step-frets (grecas) and stepped pyramids (almenas) exposed on the lower south facade (Figure 7). Although step-frets and stepped pyramids are found on many Classic Puuc buildings, they are rarely found as small ten oned blocks carved in bas-relief decorating the basal moldings of stone buildings (Pollock 1980:579). As architectural elements, gre cas and almenas appear early at Monte Albán, Cholula, and Teo tihuacan (Sharp 1978:161). The north temple is flanked on its east and west sides by two large, double-room temple buildings with I-shaped floor plans. Approximately 35 m south is another temple pyramid of similar size with a south megalithic stairway, a smaller west stairway giving access to the plaza, another double-room tem ple building to the southeast with an enormous interior lintel ex posed, and a stela platform to the south. The plaza is enclosed by two four-room range structures with column doorways; the east building is attached to a one-room building to the north, whereas the west structure connects to the double-room building west of the north temple. All structures on the east and west wings are set</page><page sequence="7">An Early Classic center in the Puuc region 239 Figure 5. Digitized map of the three-story Chac Palace. on wide building platforms with spacious porticos facing the plaza. An altar platform displaying a megalithic altar, 2 stone stelae, and a collapsed chultun are found near the plaza center. In addition, there is a smaller plaza group to the east, set upon a higher plat form surface oriented around another collapsed chultun. To the west (see Figure 6), there is a three-room Early Puuc style building containing vaulted ceilings with opposing axes: the central ceiling axis runs east to west, whereas the two lateral ceil ings are oriented north to south. Also to the west, a large five room range structure (almost 30 m long) exhibiting a mix of Early and Classic Puuc stonework is set in front of a large, high platform forming a T-shaped structure in plan view. The platform is faced with large boulders, suggesting that it was the core for rooms never completed; however, it could have been a buttress platform in tended to fortify an unstable structure (and very similar to the Akab Dzib at Chichen Itza), because the rear wall's facing stones con</page><page sequence="8">240 Smyth et al. Figure 6. Digitized map of Chac's Central Acropolis and the Grecas Plaza [center). tinue into where the building and platform abut. These two stone buildings face onto a large, open plaza to the south; at the plaza center is a columnar altar on a low platform. The Great Pyramid Plaza contains one of the largest temple pyramids known for the eastern Puuc region south of Kabah (Fig ure 8). Standing more than 20 m tall, with a wide southern stairway ascending five distinct terrace levels, the Chac pyramid appears to be rectilinear in shape, but with rounded corners. It may share many of the same characteristics as the Early Classic pyramids at the sites of Acanceh and Oxkintik located about 50 km to the north and northeast, respectively. Attached to the pyramid on the south are 8 vaulted stone buildings—four with columnar doorways— enclosing a pentagonal plaza and a double-column central altar. The west building (E-VIIa) is a long (15 m) range structure with slab vault stones and core-veneer masonry. E-VIIa is on a plat form made of large, roughly worked stones (megalithic style), with</page><page sequence="9">An Early Classic center in the Puuc region 241 Figure 7. Photo looking north showing the Greca and Almena decoration on the north temple-pyramid's south basal molding of the Grecas Plaza. an east-facing stairway with broad steps and high risers (Fig ure 9). These characteristics are typical of northern Yucatan archi tecture dating to the Early Classic period (a.d. 300-600) (Andrews 1985a; Pollock 1980; Taube 1995). Near the northeast corner of the Pyramid is a Maya causeway connecting the Pyramid Plaza to the Central Acropolis. Surrounding the Pyramid Plaza are a number of substantial plat form groups, including the impressive hilltop group (Nohoch Mul) situated about 100 m south (see Figure 4). At this location, the entire summit of a steep limestone hill was leveled to provide a basal substructure for 5 stone buildings and numerous other fea tures; this group commands a spectacular view of Chac's monu mental zone. In addition, 5 m east of the Pyramid Plaza is another building group (Hol-Be) with a small courtyard and a six-room, L-shaped building adjacent to an open platform area to the east (see Figure 8), where hundreds of sculpted decorative stones were found—many unfinished. These preliminary data suggest that the east platform area may have been a craft workshop devoted to spe cialized stoneworking. Architectural Chronology Following George Andrews's (1985a, 1985b, 1986, 1994) archi tectural chronology, there are many diagnostic buildings at Chac that belong to the Early Puuc style (ca. a.d. 650 or earlier), espe cially most stone buildings at the Great Pyramid Plaza, the central Acropolis, and the Chac Palace. In addition, there are a number of other stone buildings, including the five-room range structure of the Central Acropolis, with a strange mix of Early and Classic Puuc styles. For example, most buildings contain few decorative ele ments and few specialized Puuc "boot stones" that were cemented onto load-bearing concrete vaults to support stone roofs, although well-cut facing stones of various sizes, single-member medial mold ings, and multiple doorways with round columns abound. Ten al tars and six stone stelae have been located so far; none of the stelae exhibit carved figures or written inscriptions, an unusual pattern for a site of this size, although one contains traces of stucco, sug gesting that this stela may have been painted. All in all, much of the stylistic data on architecture suggest the Chac was a Puuc city that largely predated the Terminal Classic period. Test Excavation In 1995 the project excavated a large, two-room, vaulted building exhibiting an I-shaped floor plan—one of four such buildings at Chac—located at the south end of the Central Acropolis (see Fig ures 2, 4, and 6). The "Lintel" building takes its name from an oversized (1.5 X 1.2 m), in situ, interior, stone lintel supported by</page><page sequence="10">242 Smyth et al. GREAT PYRAMID PLAZA AND HOL-BE 0 10 20 30 40 50 meters Figure 8. Digitized map of the Great Pyramid Plaza and the Hoi-Be Group. a series of exquisitely cut stone blocks (sillares) that served as door jambs for an inner room's west entryway. The monumental context of this building, between the south temple of the Grecas plaza and the nearby stela platform, suggests that the building served a high-status function. In addition, the excavation uncovered a num ber of high-status wares including several Late Classic potsherds. The Early Puuc stonework, the ceramic assemblage and an obsidian hydration date of a.d. 667 ± 59 from an adjacent test pit suggest that the building had a special function dating to the Late Classic period (Smyth, Ligorred P., Euan C., and Castillos B. 1995). Five 2-X-2-m test pits were excavated in 10-cm arbitrary levels (following natural strata when encountered) in nonarchitectural con texts at selected localities near the Chac Palace, the Central Acrop olis, and the Great Pyramid Plaza. These excavations were designed to gather preliminary chronological information, and yielded the typical Cehpech ceramic wares. However, 226 Motul (a.d. 600 800) ceramic sherds were found in stratigraphic contexts associ ated with Cehpech ceramics near Early Puuc architecture and lend further support to the mounting evidence that some Cehpech wares had their beginnings in the Late Classic period or earlier (see Boucher 1992; Carrasco V. and Boucher 1990; Prem 1991; Rivera 1989, 1991; VarelaT. 1992, 1993). 1996 FIELD RESEARCH Surface Collection and Mapping Survey Surface collection and mapping survey continued within 90 ha of the northern and western zones of greater Chac (see Figure 2). The surface survey collected all cultural materials, including 4,639 potsherds from l,3603-X-3-m collection units. Mapping survey and contextual analysis took place at more than 25 architectural</page><page sequence="11">An Early Classic center in the Puuc region 243 Figure 9. Photo looking south, showing the megalithic staircase of E-VIIa. groups, which were intensively mapped at a scale of 1:250 using an EDM or sketched by compass and tape survey. In addition to sampling the cultural landscape of Chac, the goal of the north survey was to document the northern extent of settle ment and determine if there is a causeway heading in the direction of Kabah. Although no clear evidence of an intersite north cause way has been detected thus far, more than a dozen substantial plat forms and other architectural features were located, mapped, and coded. The northern limit of the site appears to be approximately 1.5 km north of the main Chac group and only 800 m south of the deep Chac cave. The west survey produced more than 15 new architectural fea ture clusters, many with multiroom, stone-roofed buildings. The survey also located another large pyramid plaza with a 10-m-tall temple-pyramid and 5 stone buildings arranged around a central plaza (see Figure 2j). Indeed, the north building has many of the same early architectural characteristics as E-VIIa, including a mega lithic platform and stairway and an annex platform with a four column entryway. Column entryways are found at four of the five stone buildings, and a columnar altar and platform are located near the plaza center. Interestingly, four of these west groups are lo cated atop steep limestone hills; each provides a commanding east ward view of central Chac. One small west temple (Sun Temple) contains a number of tenoned stones carved in bas-relief showing sunburst motifs, a rather unusual Puuc decorative symbol (see Fig ure 2o). These new settlement data indicate that the site con formed to a complex type of city planning that emphasized east-west cardinal directionality, but also multilevel verticality. In addition, virtually all of the diagnostic stone buildings appear to display ele ments of Proto-Puuc and Early Puuc styles, raising the question of major temporal differences between the two styles or possibly a moment of architectural transition (see Andrews 1985a, 1986; Pollock 1980). Terracing Continuing the soil research begun at Chac in 1995, 675 survey units were placed to sample 42 ha within the north survey zone. The 1996 soil analysis confirms the results of the 1995 testing— low phosphate enrichment for most pusluum, kancab, and kancab tzekel soils. Many chacluum and some pusluum and kancab soils associate with 8 new slope terraces identified on survey in 1996 and show significant phosphate enrichment, suggesting that these soils were under intensive cultivation. A dry slope terrace located in the north survey area adjacent to a residential platform was excavated by Nicholas Dunning and Pat</page><page sequence="12">244 Smyth et al. Farrell in 1996 (see Figure 2n). Dry slope terraces function by de creasing the slope angle of the surface. Large rocks are removed from the concave slope and used as basal stones to anchor the rub ble wall (Figure 10). Erosion of soil upslope of the terrace allows soil to deepen behind the wall and cumulic soils, such as pusluum, to develop. One possibility is that this particular slope terrace was used as a seed bed for plants later transplanted to a large tract of kancab located at the base of the slope (Figure 11). Importantly, we confirmed the presence of one slope terrace at Chac and two possible slope terraces based on in-the-field visual inspection (Nicholas Dunning, personal communication 1996). The 1996 data, therefore, provide mounting evidence for the practice of intensive terrace agriculture at Chac. A Program of Dating One of the principal objectives of the Chac Project is to imple ment a program of absolute dating to help clarify aspects of the Puuc architectural and ceramic chronologies. The abundance of Early Puuc-style architecture at Chac makes it an ideal laboratory for undertaking such a dating program. Eight samples were sub mitted for radiocarbon dating, including six specimens of char coal (below) and two pieces of wood from a variety of excavated and surface contexts. From a wooden crossbeam within the first floor northeast room of the Early Puuc-style Chac Palace, two wood specimens gave conventional 14C ages of a.d. 830 ± 60 for the inner wood sample and a.d. 850 ± 60 for the outer wood sam ple (Table 1). Based on the beam's context and the room's con struction details, it seems probable that this wooden beam was part of a Terminal Classic rebuilding, perhaps representing an attempt to stabilize and/or renovate the room. Twenty-one obsidian prismatic-blade fragments were submit ted for obsidian-hydration dating and abbreviated neutron-activation analysis (NAA) sourcing. Twenty obsidian specimens were sourced to El Chayal, and one came from the San Martin Jilotepeque; both are highland Guatemalan sources, suggesting that Chac partici pated in the Classic Maya trade routes. Calculated from readable internal fissure hydration bands and a newly established hydration rate for the Puuc region, two obsidian specimens gave dates of a.d. 492 ± 62 and a.d. 667 ± 59 (Table 2). The 667 date came from Test Pit 1 near the Lintel Building, located southeast of the Grecas Plaza within Level 5 (50 cm below surface [b.s.]) of a ceramic-refuse midden. The 492 date came from Level 1 (10 cm b.s.) of a shallow test pit (Pit 3) sampling a plaza surface 3 m north of the three-room Early Puuc building, which is located on the northernmost edge and highest surface level of the Central Acropolis. Although this early obsidian date reflects the construc tion date of this particular plaza surface, the Early Puuc building 50 cm RUBBLE WALL Figure 10.

In fact, the average of these two dates (a.d. 580) conforms well to the evidence from other Puuc sites arguing that the Early Puuc style predates a.d. 650 (Becquelin et al. 1994, 1996; Boucher 1992; Carrasco V. y Boucher 1990; Gallareta N. et al. 1995; Prem 1991; Rivera A. 1989, 1991). Architectural Excavation and Restoration The 1995 field season made it clear that to accurately place Chac in time and understand why the site was built in the first place would require the excavation and restoration of a number of Chac's principal buildings. To begin this phase of the Chac research pro gram, E-VIIa—the west building and largest structure of the Great Pyramid Plaza except tor the pyramid itself—underwent excava tion and restoration in 1996 (see Figure 8). E-VIIa was selected for excavation based on such architectural characteristics as slab vault stones and a megalithic basal platform and stairway typical of buildings dating of the Early Classic period (a.d. 300-600) (An drews 1985a; Maldonado 1979; Pollock 1980; Taube 1995). The excavation of E-VIIa included investigation of four inter related structures: the megalithic platform and staircase, the range type superstructure E-VIIa, an attached south annex platform, and building E-VIIb to the north (Figure 12). Following a clearing and cleanup of the area, a grid system oriented to magnetic north was laid out to provenience all recovered materials and provide con trols for consolidation and restoration. The megalithic basal platform consists of large, rough-cut boul ders incorporated into a natural limestone outcrop. On the east side, the boulders were placed to form an inward-sloping wall, or talud. Surrounded by talud facades is a megalithic staircase with four wide steps made from large, tall stone boulder risers. This east facing stairway leads to E-Vila's building platform; its facade is decorated with small, well-cut facing stones similar to those found on early architecture at Oxkintok (Figures 13 and 14). On the west side, rough-cut flagstones were placed directly upon bedrock to provide the base for the building platform—a very rare, archaic kind of foundation for Puuc architecture. The talud facades of the megalithic platform are decorated with medium-sized, well-cut stone blocks set about 50 cm below the talud to form incomplete vertical panels. Taken together, the sloping wall and vertical pan els could be interpreted as a variation of a talud-tablero facade (see Figure 13). Talud-tablero-\ike facades have been found at the Ah-Canul and May groups of Oxkintok (Dunning and Andrews 1994:Figure 11; Rivera A. 1990), Structure 612 and Substructure 44 at Dzibilchaltun (Andrews IV and Andrews V 1980:73-74; An drews V 1979; Coggins 1983; Maldonado 1994), and the Early Classic pyramid at Acanceh (Andrews IV 1942; Fernandez 1939; Miller 1991).</page><page sequence="14">246 Smyth et al.

Unfortunately, none of the 1996 obsidian specimens had readable internal fissure hydration bands, like those of the 1995 specimens MP-072 and MPS-073, known for giving more reliable dates (see Ambrose 1976, 1984). acteristic that distinguishes E-VIIa from more typical Puuc con structions is the frequency in which gaps between stones are filled with dry joints or cunas, something never seen in Classic Puuc stonework and rarely for Early Puuc buildings. The east facade contains five openings, each are 1.23 m wide and give access to a single room space; there are two lateral doorways and three cen tral entryways separated by two cylindrical columns. The door jambs are formed by double rows of cut stone blocks of various sizes stacked 3-4 courses high, seemingly a Proto-Puuc charac teristic (Andrews 1986). The width of the walls measures .65 m, and the vaults (unrestored) are large slab stones stacked in 6-7 courses whose faces are roughly cut and of various dimensions; the capstones are larger, but similar in shape. Given these con struction elements, the buildings's vaulted roof was relatively short in overall height, whereas the building walls were quite tall. The trapezoid-shaped annex platform abuts the building plat form about 1 m south of E-VIIa and exhibits an exquisite staircase on the extreme north of the east wall; there are nine steps faced with small, well-cut stones. There is no evidence, however, that the platform ever supported a substantial superstructure. Another important stone structure, referred to as E-VIIb, is attached to the north wall of E-VIIa and presumably connected to the Great Pyr amid. Building E-VIIb was only partially investigated; our work there concentrated on understanding how it was connected to E-VIIa. On the east side, there is a clear connection to the megalithic platform—including evidence of a separate building platform for E-VIIb. In addition, another staircase—with four steps—was uncovered leading to E-VIIb, which appears to be a two-room structure oriented north to south. On the west, E-VIIb is attached to the north wall of E-VIIa. The visible stonework of E-VIIb and E-VIIa are similar, suggesting that the two buildings were contemporaneous. One of the most extraordinary finds of the season was the re covery of an unusual, tenoned, stone serpent head (feathered ser pent?) carved in bas-relief. The serpent head was found between the first stair riser leading to E-VIIb and an in situ stone column (Figure 15), suggesting the possibility of a second stone altar within the Great Pyramid Plaza. Whether the serpent head deco rated the facade of E-VIIb or adorned the Great Pyramid itself is presently unknown, but its weathered condition and context sug gest that it was contemporaneous with the main construction phase of the pyramid complex and later included as an offering. The three-dimensional style of the sculpture is certainly unusual, but resembles aspects of bicephalic serpents at Uxmal (Barrera Ru bio and Huchim Herrera 1990; Kowalski 1987) and open mouthed feathered serpents at Chichen Itza. The reptile-feather eye and almenas horns, in contrast, remind one of stylistic motifs found at Teotihuacan, whereas the three snake-like forms around the ear and jaw area—as well as the four squares above the eye— are dissimilar to the scroll ear designs on serpents at Teotihuacan and Chichen Itza. The two large circular depressions behind the mouth are enigmatic, but could have been used to mount semi precious stones. Although the combination of these symbols may represent a Maya glyph, the most important realization is that this serpent sculpture may be a prototype for those found at Ux mal and Chichen Itza.

Digitized map of Building E-Vlla of the Great Pyramid Plaza after restoration, showing the megalithic platform and stairway, the annex platform (left), and a portion of E-VIIb (right). excavation units were placed within the Great Pyramid Plaza, one unit sampled the internal causeway, another unit explored a chul tun within the Grecas Plaza, and one unit tested a slope terrace north of central Chac. These excavations were designed to gather an array of chronological and functional information from control contexts, including carbon and obsidian, for a program of absolute dating. The Pyramid Plaza and chultun excavations produced three ceremonial offerings and 743 potsherds of the Motul complex re covered from the same stratigraphic contexts as typical Cehpech ceramics. Those test units providing information relevant to the site's early occupation and foreign contacts are discussed below. Excavation 7 took place at a partially collapsed chultun located at the center-east of the Grecas Plaza (see Figure 6). The objective of this exploratory excavation was to test a chultun at Chac for artifact diversity and recover datable materials from floor con texts. Roughly flask shaped in profile, the chultun measures 2.80 m long by 2.58 m wide, with a surface-to-floor depth of 3.92 m and an estimated storage capacity of 18,000 liters. Because of roof collapse, the chultun, roof fall, and fill had accumulated of a depth of nearly 2 m. Level 1, therefore, was the stratum repre sented by the roof fall and yielded only 138 Cehpech sherds, but also 22 sherds of the Motul complex. Level 2, the 30 cm above the chultun floor, produced two Cochuah, 552 Motul, and 3,335 Cehpech wares (see Figure 3). Not surprisingly, most ceramics re covered were slateware chultunera and water jars for drawing and storing water—many were similar to slateware jars found in the nearby Chac cave dated to the Early Classic period (Andrews IV 1965), although there were many slateware basins and bowls. Al though a mixed deposit, the high frequency of Motul and Cehpech ceramics together lends more support to a Motul-Cehpech over lap. Three small, ceramic, anthropomorphic heads—probably from censers—were also recovered; one seems to represent Chac-Xib Chac, described as being an early prototype of the rain god Chac (Scheie and Friedel 1990:408; Taube 1992). Two carbon samples recovered from the Grecas chultun were submitted for radiocarbon analysis and produced uncalibrated dates of a.d. 320 ± 60 and a.d. 760 ± 100 (see Table 1). The former date came from inside the plaster floor and clearly marks the ini tial time of construction of the chultun, making it the earliest dated chultun in the Puuc and one of the earliest in all of northern Yucatan. The later date came from above the floor, allowing a rough chronological bracketing of materials in Level 2 to the Early-Late Classic periods; the two dates average a.d. 540. These data are in close agreement with an a.d. 492 date associated with the nearby</page><page sequence="16">248 Smyth et al. Figure 13.

A right profile drawing of the tenoned serpent head from Chac by José Ligorred R Scale is 1:4 cm. Early Puuc building, discussed above, and strongly suggest that the Grecas Plaza was constructed sometime between a.d. 320 and 492. Excavation Units 8-11 were placed at the Great Pyramid Pla za's central altar, approximately 10 m east of E-Vila's megalithic staircase. The plaza's central monument is composed of a circular altar and two cylindrical columns. The plaza consists of a series of floor levels made up of three successive construction layers: mul tiple coats of stucco, cobble-sized stones (bak chich), and small boulders (bak pek). The paved surface exhibits a definite slope gradient toward the south that presumably functioned to drain rain water out of and away from the plaza. Rather untypical for Puuc architecture, however, is the lack of a common basal platform for plaza group structures; the plaza floor and a series of building plat forms are either built upon deep tracks of red chacluum soil or directly atop limestone outcrops. The central altar is associated with the uppermost stucco layers of the unit, suggesting that the original plaza surface is much earlier. In fact, a carbon sample taken from below the plaza floor (70 cm b.s.) has yielded a radiocarbon date of a.d. 90 ± 110, dating the original plaza floor to the Late Preclassic period (see Table 1). The altar excavation uncovered three ceremonial offerings with five complete ceramic vessels and two stone sculptures. Offer ing 1 appeared 20 cm south of Column 2, near the south wall of Unit 8, between depths of 29 and 43 cm b.s. (Figure 16). The of fering consisted of two complete vessels: a tripod slateware bowl with hemispherical supports inverted over an unslipped, unstri ated jar. Interestingly, these particular vessels are not typical for the Puuc region and more closely resemble vessel forms known for Terminal Classic Chichen Itza. To the west appeared a tenoned stone sculpture depicting what appears to be a human head in a serpent's mouth (Figure 17). Although human-serpent sculpture can be found at such other Puuc sites as Uxmal, Labna, and Santa María nearTekax (Pollock 1980:369, Figure 628b), this head sculp ture, like the serpent head mentioned above, appears to be of a simpler, more realistic, perhaps earlier style. In fact, this sculpture could easily be interpreted as a person wearing a helmet like those of the Teotihuacan military costume depicted on stelae from Tikal and Tres Islas (Stone 1989:156, Figures 2 and 4). Because the ten oned stone head is clearly weathered, the sculpture probably dec orated the facade of one of the surrounding buildings long before being included as part of the central offering. Offering 2 (Figure 18), a large, unslipped, unstriated jar appear ing west of the altar at 44-70 cm b.s., is adorned with an unusual appliqué figure facing east. Dubbed the "chupacabra" (goat blood sucker) vessel, for lack of a better term, the figure exhibits a bat or jaguar-like face with a three-stone collar, no torso, and stylized arms and legs. Clearly, Offering 2 represents an effigy vessel of a style unlike any other that we know of for the Puuc region. Offering 3 consisted of two large, almost complete Yocat Striated water jars found directly below the north column at 51 90 cm b.s. Interspersed around the two vessels were a number of small facing stones, making the vessels extremely difficult to re move intact. Only Vessel 1 (the northwest one) could be re moved whole; Vessel 2 (the southeast one) came out in pieces.</page><page sequence="18">250 Smyth et al. Figure 16.

Drawing of the "chupacabra" vessel, or Offering 2, from Pit 8, Level 5 (60-70 cm b.s.). Scale is 1:4 cm. Vessel 2, however, contained the remains of a vessel lid and 3 small stone offerings of roughly equal size and weight: a pol ished serpentine celt (9.0 g), a chunk of black hematite (6.5 g), and a flat, semitranslucent piece of white calcite (8.5 g). The ser pentine and hematite stones, in particular, do not occur naturally in Yucatan and must have been imported. The closest serpentine source to the Puuc region, for example, is located to the south near the Motagua Valley, although the color of the serpentine sug gests a Balsas region of Guerrero origin (Mesoamerica's most common source of worked hematite comes from Oaxaca). Impor tantly, these data suggest that Chac maintained trade ties extend ing far outside the Yucatan Peninsula. Found between Vessels 1 and 2 was an extraordinary miniature maize cob (20 mm long and weighing .2 g) micro-carved from a tiny piece of limestone. This artifact represents an ear of 18-row maize, a rare find that underscores the symbolic and substantive importance of maize. Vessel 1 contained a ceramic lid; a silver green obsidian bipoint; and a white chert, double-pointed, laurel leaf knife measuring 31 cm long coated with a fine layer of white stucco. Both points were oriented north. Although laurel-leaf knives are traditional Maya offering items, stucco coating is more typi cally a Teotihuacan technique. Also, the Chac obsidian bipoint looks like Pachua green obsidian. Moholy-Nagy (1984) was able to source most of the gray and all of the green obsidian bifaces found at</page><page sequence="20">252 Smyth et al. Tikal to central Mexico, showing that they were imports from Teo tihuacan. Overall, the placement and associated materials suggest that Offering 3 was the altar's principal offering—dating to a pe riod before the other cached offerings. Excavation 13 was a 3.75-X-1.75-m unit excavated in cultural floor levels within the room area behind the south doorway of E-VIIa. The building's upper floor surface (Floor 1) was encoun tered at 12 cm b.s. and consisted of a hard, white stucco surface averaging approximately 12 cm in thickness set upon a layer of sascab (limestone marl), chich stones, and small boulders. This stucco floor contained embedded charcoal fragments near the south room entryway that produced a radiocarbon date of a.d. 700 ± 60 (see Table 1). Evidently, Floor 1 was one of the last interior modifications to a building constructed sometime earlier. Floor 2 was a tan-colored, less-compact stucco surface appearing within Level 2 at 39-48 cm b.s. Below Floor 2, at 68-127 cm b.s., was the structure fill for the megalithic platform, which consisted of soil, chich, and medium to large boulders set upon bedrock. Pit 13 produced 313 diagnostic potsherds taken from sealed con texts associated with two distinct floor levels. Of the 300 sherds that came from below floor level 1,133 were Motul wares and the rest were identified as Yocat Striated. These data clearly demon strate that common Cehpech wares like Yocat Striated predate the Terminal Classic period. Excavation 14 was placed inside the central room area behind the double-column doorway. Exposing a 4.27 X 1.90 m area, vir tually the entire width of the room minus a 20-cm safety margin, Pit 14 encountered the same two stucco floor levels that were found in Unit 13—but with an intermediate floor surface confined to the room center to support the weight of the two central columns. Of the 218 ceramics recovered, 123 were from below Floor 2 and con sisted of 65 Motul and 58 Cehpech sherds. A charcoal sample found within Floor 2 has produced a radiocarbon date of a.d. 520 ± 60 (see Table 2). The sealed context of this dated sample and its su perposition within the building's original stucco floor allow a de termination that Floor 2 and E-VIIa were constructed during the later part of the Early Classic period. The megalithic platform, there fore, is likely to have predated E-VIIa. SUMMARY Data from the Chac Project are providing new insights into the timing of urban origins in the Puuc region. The finding of pre Cehpech wares with typical Cehpech ceramics in test pits and ar chitectural contexts predating the eighth century show that certain ceramic wares traditionally assigned to the Cehpech ceramic com plex and Terminal Classic period had their beginnings much ear lier. For example, the radiocarbon date of a.d. 520 taken from E-VIIa sealed floor context indicates that associated Motul and Cehpech wares definitely overlap in time. Ceramics removed from the underlying megalithic platform should predate the sixth cen tury. These data demonstrate that there are typical Cehpech wares, such as Yocat, Muna, Sacalum, and even Red Teabo, that are of greater antiquity than traditionally assumed and practically span the entire Classic-period sequence. The major message here is that the simple presence of Cehpech ceramics cannot be confidently used as a simple measure of Terminal Classic occupation. The Cehpech, and even Motul, ceramic complexes clearly have ante cedents that predate the assumed chronological assignments for the region. To develop reliable techniques for the identification early Cehpech ceramics, the covariation between vessel forms and early ceramic wares is being investigated more closely (see Boucher 1992). In addition, NAA is helping to reveal diagnostic character istics of paste composition to positively identify pre-Cehpech from typical Cehpech ceramics (see Smyth, Dore, Neff, and Glascock 1995). These data together should provide a comprehensive basis for more precisely dating the Cehpech ceramic complex and tying ceramic sequences to architectural chronologies. Comparing the evidence for agriculture suggests that there were significant differences in subsistence organization at Chac and Sayil. Maya farmers at Chac appear to have favored the intensive culti vation of fertile soils at the bases of hill slopes, building terraces where necessary. Of the 18 slope terraces identified at Chac so far, test excavation has confirmed that one was, indeed, agricultural—it is probable that there are many others as well. On the other hand, agriculturists at Sayil emphasized intensive gardening, exploiting the deep soils of urban Sayil's relatively flat solution valley. The reliance on terracing at Chac and gardening at Sayil suggests an agricultural transition likely to have occurred during different pe riods of occupation. The completed work suggests that Chac was a major Puuc region center during the Early Classic period. Architecturally, there is nothing ordinary about the site. Chac settlement appears to have been highly nucleated and of first-rate construction. Although there are few decorative facades, and the buildings are not large by Puuc standards, there is widespread evidence of early and transitional architectural characteristics—suggesting that Maya architects at Chac were experimenting with new construction techniques and beginning to formulate a new stoneworking tradition featuring core veneer masonry and concrete vaulting. In fact, the 1996 work has furnished architectural data and absolute dating to indicate that many seemingly Early Puuc-style buildings at Chac were contem poraneous with Early Classic occupation (a.d. 400-600) at the Puuc site of Oxkintok. The widespread occurrence of a possible stone workshop in a monumental-site context suggests that Chac may have been home to some of the originators of the Puuc stonework ing tradition. Clearly, the site of Chac is taking on strategic im portance for understanding the origins of Puuc urbanism and civilization. DISCUSSION AND PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS The Chac Project has provided new data on a major Puuc city pre dating the Terminal Classic "florescent" period. These data are im portant because they begin to refocus archaeological attention on traditional models regarding the development of Puuc cities and their larger role in the processes and events that shaped Maya civ ilization during the Classic period. So far, there is little support for any of the traditional models of Puuc origins outlined earlier. Mass migrations into the Puuc region at the end of the Classic period were unlikely; Chac is contemporaneous with the major Maya centers of the Early Classic period. The development of the region through economic trade with Gulf Coast Maya does not correspond with the time of Chac's occupation, and so far suffers from a lack of physical evidence. Trade geared toward political rather than economic purposes could have been a factor, however, especially if emerging elites sought to establish outside contacts reflected in acquiring new symbols to enhance their pres tige and political clout. The breadbasket model, which argues for local, indigenous development centering on demographic growth,</page><page sequence="21">An Early Classic center in the Puuc region 253 Figure 19. Remaining portion of the stucco star ring found within the north room area of E-Vlla. agricultural intensification, and economic expansion, assumes the existence of a complex export economy in basic foodstuffs, some thing of limited economic viability because of the inherent inef ficiency of a foot mode of transport. Tribute payments in foodstuffs, on the other hand, would indicate that the Puuc re gion was politically subservient to an outside group, a situation that seems unlikely. In either case, these kinds of economies are characteristic of a region at its height or its wane, certainly not at its origin. The models of Puuc origins presented earlier are largely incom patible with the Chac data. On the other hand, small-scale, spo radic migrations to the Puuc and foreign trade obviously took place, and population growth and agricultural intensification must have been important factors. So far, the work at Chac suggests that in digenous growth coupled with political trade with powerful for eign groups during the Early Classic period played significant roles in the origin of Puuc civilization (see Ball and Taschek [1989], Cohodas [1978], and Kowalski [1989] for arguments linking Maya Yucatan to central Mexico during the Middle-Terminal Classic pe riods). Indeed, a number of compelling and far-reaching research questions at Chac remain unanswered: How did this city arise and why here in particular? What was the political economy like? With whom did the holders of power at Chac maintain external relations and what was the nature of those relations? Although incomplete, the data at hand allow us to formulate a number of hypothetical propositions. The Maya books of the Chilam Balam, although a confusing source regarding Maya history and open to variable interpretation, make reference to the arrival into Yucatan of a number of foreign groups at different times in the past (Roys 1967). The most famed and controversial of these arrivals, of course, revolve around the Toltecs and Itzas—who may have arrived at Chichen Itza by the late tenth century. What about development in the Puuc region and the possibility of early outsider contacts and influences? How the Puuc cities rose to preeminence in the Terminal Classic and the nature and timing of their relationship with Chichen Itza are ques tions that require an understanding of the processes and events pre ceding Yucatan's florescence (see Dunning and Andrews [1994], Dunning and Kowalski [1994], Kepecs et al. [1994], and Prem [1994] for recent discussions of Terminal Classic Yucatan).</page><page sequence="22">254 Smyth et al. Chronicle One of the Chilam Balam ofChumayel and other re lated historical documents, interestingly, seem to imply that there was an arrival of, or perhaps contact with, non-Maya groups per haps as early as the fifth century a.d. (Roys 1967:135-136, 204 205). These passages referring to early foreign groups in the Yucatan have been largely ignored and even controversially reinterpreted as later south-to-north Maya migration into the Puuc region at the end of the Classic period (Morley 1956). While it is certain that the northern Maya maintained relations with the Maya to the south, it is becoming increasingly apparent from our work at Chac that the Puuc had early contacts with "Mexicanized" Maya peoples, if not the outright arrival of foreigners. Is it possible that the first for eigners to arrive in Yucatan (and the Puuc region) were non-Maya speaking peoples who came during the Early Classic period? It has long been suggested that the architectural decorative style of Puuc buildings shows influences from non-Maya areas. For ex ample, the lower building episodes of the Magicians' Pyramid at Uxmal depicts a Tlaloc (the central Mexican rain god) face sur rounded by Mexican year signs (Barrera Rubio 1985; Coe 1980; Foncerrada de Molina 1965; Kowalski 1989; Maldonado 1986). As mentioned above, the Early Classic sites of Oxkintok, Dzibil chaltun, and especially Acanceh have buildings with talud-tablero facades; the latter exhibits stuccoed relief figures and/or feathered serpent or Quetzalcoatl imagery in a style reminiscent of Teoti huacan. At Chac, a number of finds in 1996 also suggest non Maya influences. For instance, the chultun excavation not only produced evidence of an Early Classic date of construction, but an abundance of early ceramics—including a tripod slateware dish with an incised support showing the goggle-eyed Mexican rain god Tlaloc. Also, Offering 3 of the Great Pyramid Plaza's central altar yielded stones of serpentine and hematite that clearly origi nated from outside Yucatan. In addition, the work at E-VIIa has revealed a possible talud-tablero facade, a rare serpent head of an apparently early style, and a star motif on a stucco ring inside E-VIIa (Figure 19). The star ring appears similar to star motifs found on the murals at the Palace and Patio of the Jaguars at Teotihuacan (Kubler 1967:Figure 19; Miller 1973:Figure 47), and also a stuc coed, painted, cylindrical tripod vessel from Burial 48 at Tikal (Cog gins 1979:264, Figure 6c). As work progresses, we believe that the Great Pyramid at Chac dates to the Early Classic period and is contemporaneous with the site of Acanceh and its Temple of the Stucco Facade, which is noted for its Teotihuacan-like imagery (Andrews IV 1942; Miller 1991). The site of Chac, a site located between two major highways and two popular archaeological tourist zones, has managed to elude the attention of archaeologists until recently. Although not large by Puuc standards, Chac is important not only because of its un usual concentration of early architecture, but also because it may hold a key for understanding the emergence of the Puuc cities. Although much remains to be done to comprehend why the site is even there at all, further work at Chac will reveal more informa tion regarding the origins of Maya urbanism and the nature and directionality of foreign influences at an early Maya center in the heart of the Puuc region. RESUMEN Un recorrido completo del sitio y un programa de excavación se llevaron a cabo en el verano de 1995 y 1996 en el centro antiguo Maya de Chac II, ubicado en las colinas del Puuc de Yucatán, México. Esta investigación sugiere que Chac era un centro importante durante el periodo clásico tem prano (300-600 d.C.). Los datos de los contextos superficiales, el suelo, la arquitectura y la excavación de Chac están dirigiendo las preguntas sobre las cronologías arquitectónicas y cerámicas, el origen del estilo arqui tectónico Puuc, las áreas de actividad y patrones de uso del terreno. Además, el fechamiento indica que Chac precidió a Sayil y que los dos sitios tuvi eron una relación geográfica cercana. Además, las terrazas agrícolas pare cen haber sido comunes, en Chac en contraste con Sayil donde se muestra un patrón de huertas agrícolas intensivas. Con respecto a la nueva infor mación de Chac, se destaca que los modelos tradicionales de los orígenes del estilo Puuc no son adecuados. Un sitio de mayor importancia del clásico temprano localizado en el corazón de la región Puuc sugiere que su gran deza fue indígena con contactos externos de grupos foráneos hasta el Méx ico central. Con respecto a esto, el sitio de Chac cobra una importancia estratégica para entender los orígenes de la civilización Puuc, proporcio nando una oportunidad excepcional para estudiar un centro maya que es tuvo al borde del urbanismo dentro de una de las áreas más urbanizadas de los mayas antiguos. Estos nuevos datos ayudan a elucidar la naturaleza del urbanismo de los mayas y a establecer el tipo de contacto cultural entre las fieras bajas mayas del norte y el resto de Mesoamérica durante el período clásico.
