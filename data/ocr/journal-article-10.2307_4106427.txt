<plain_text><page sequence="1">SYMPOSIUM: THE PRESENT-DAY RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES CONCERNING NATURAL RELIGION. By PROF. A. E. TAYLOR, PROF. J. LAIRD, AND PROF. T. E. JESSOP. I.-By A. E. TAYLOR. My contribution to our discussion will have to consist chiefly in playing the useful but ungracious part of the advocatus diaboli, since repeated study of Hume's Dialogues leaves me convinced that their permanent worth is commonly over-estimated. With all their incidental flashes of insight, I find them, like everything Hume wrote on philosophy after the youthful Treatise, wanting in high seriousness and logical coherency. I fear we might say of the Hume of the Inquiries and Dialogues what Housman wrote of Richard Bentley, that his wish to discover truth was not equal to his capacity for discovering it. In the Dialogues this is suffi- ciently indicated by one ominous fact : the argument turns avowedly on the postulate of the omnipresence of causal order in nature, though the writer must have been aware that on his own principles he had no right whatever to make any such postulate. Philo the sceptic and Cleanthes the " experimental" theist are agreed on the principle that like causes prove like effects and that conversely likeness in the effect, if close enough, will prove likeness in the cause. But Hume must have known that he had himself professedly shown that there can be no rational inference from cause to effect, or from effect to cause. A criticism of religious convictions by Hume could not well have been other than superficial for a deeper reason. Criticism is always superficial unless it is inspired by sym- pathetic insight and an adequate sense of the significance of the issues at stake. No one will ever criticize religion or M2</page><page sequence="2">180 A. E. TAYLOR. the theology in which it tries to give systematic form to its convictions, unless he feels that it matters vitally to him and to all of us whether the affirmations of religion are true or false. The critic may hate religion as Shelley did in his Queen Mab days, but at least he must care enough about it to hate it. And it is so manifest that when Hume sat down to discuss the issue described by himself as that between theism and atheism, he did not " care " in any vital sense. At best he has only a languid speculative interest in the whole problem ; to him it is no more than a question about the possibility of identifying the " cause of order " in nature ; it makes no difference to the real and important concerns of life in what sense we answer the question, or whether we put it boldly on one side as an insoluble riddle. Only a profound indifferentism, which would have been as repug- nant to Shelley as to Pascal, could sit down contentedly with Hume's conclusion that the disagreement between theist and atheist is no more than an empty verbal wrangle about the relative importance of the substantive and the adjective in a formula in which both parties at bottom concur. Hume's proposed eirenicon is in spirit suspiciously like the popular agnosticism of the self-educated of sixty years ago as summed up by Archbishop Magee: " We know nothing whatever about it, don't you know; let's split a B and S." When Kant subsequently worked much of the material supplied by Hume into his own criticism of theology, he raised the discussion to a higher level. But he could only do so because he looked to philosophy for the decision and in answer to two questions of vital importance on which philosophy as understood by Hume has nothing to say : what ought I to do and what may I hope for ? It does not surprise me, therefore, that Hume's Dialogues can be seen to suffer from very grave deficiencies. None of the interlocutors is a satisfactory representative of the cause his creator apparently wishes him to uphold ; for lack of proper initial determination of the problem, none of them knows clearly what he could be at; all of them are ready not only to contradict themselves but to indulge freely in patent fallacies of petitio principii and ignoratio</page><page sequence="3">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 181 elenchi. This would have been dramatically right if Hume's purpose had been merely to expose the rambling and incon- clusive fashion in which such a topic as " natural religion " was apt to be discussed by the average gentleman of the eighteenth century, but the pains he was at to ensure post- humous publication seem to show that he designed more than this-apparently he held that he was making a material contribution to the criticism of the claims of theism on our acceptance. If so, the value of his work manifestly does depend very much on the clarity with which the issue is defined, the fidelity with which the speakers abide by that issue and the soundness of their logic. Comment on these points is thus in place. Now the issue under discussion has apparently been defined precisely enough in the opening paragraph of Pt. II by Demea with the express assent of Philo. It is admitted as certain that there is a "God" that is, in the words of Philo-an " original cause of the universe " ; we have only to ask whether we know what that cause is, and more particularly whether, as Cleanthes asserts, it can be shown to be a supreme designing mind. It is then taken as con- ceded, even by Philo the champion of scepticism, that " this universe " is known to be, as a whole, an effect of something other than itself. (If Philo is meant as a representative of Hume's philosophical scepticism, we have, of course, no right to concede that " this universe " or anything else has such a cause, as Hume must have known.) Once laid down, this initial hypothesis itself cannot properly be called in question while we are still debating the further issue whether, given the existence of such a cause we can determine its nature, and Hume (or, at any rate, Philo) seems to have no suspicion that this elementary rule of logical procedure has been violated, for at the end of the whole conversation we find him propounding a certain thesis about " the cause of the universe " as the outcome of the debate. Yet Philo himself has in the meanwhile changed the whole issue by attempting to argue that the "material universe " needs no " cause " at all, but may be self-existent. And neither Demea nor Cleanthes seems alive to the way in which their interlocutor is playing fast and loose with the problem.</page><page sequence="4">182 A. E. TAYLOR. In point of fact, the apparent precision with which the original issue was determined is illusory ; neither " cause " nor " universe " has been defined, and both terms are allowed to shift their meaning in the course of the con- versation. As to the second of them Philo is the great offender. When he wishes to go back on his own initial position and to suggest that the " universe " needs no cause, his reasoning is founded on the ambiguous and dubious assertion that the " universe " is a singular event, not a species. He apparently means that the whole " universe " is one thing and an unique thing, not a member of the class of " universes," and then to argue that casual connexion is only discernable where one can compare "like circum- stances," i.e., members of a class. To say nothing of the dubiousness of one of the premises of this reasoning (the proposition that the " universe " is in any relevant sense a single thing), the argument is an ignoratio elenchi : all that it could prove at most is that we are not in a position to discover the cause of the " universe", not that it has none but is " itself" the necessary being (the conclusion Philo is professing to prove here). But I will let that pass, merely remarking that to make Philo's statement that " the uni- verse " is a singular event intelligible, we must take the term to stand for a totality of some kind, whether the aggregate of all existents, or as seems rather to be meant, the aggregate of all bodies. But when we read Pt. VI we find that Philo has now forgotten the importance of this proposition to him. To damage the appeal of Cleanthes to wise design in the structure of the universe, Philo now insists that before we draw such a conclusion we must compare this " uni- verse " with the whole range of other possible or even real " universes." The word seems now to have taken on the restricted sense of solar (or perhaps stellar) system ; in any case it has come to stand for a " species." There is an equal ambiguity in the use of the term " cause." It is never clear, all through the argument, what the speakers mean by a cause of the universe; do they mean an originative source of its whole reality, or only, as much of their language would suggest, a source of the order in nature ?</page><page sequence="5">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES 183 When Cleanthes offers us a proof of the existence of God and Philo undertakes to refute it, what is meant by " God," a Creator or only an " architect of the universe "? The distinction was as well-known in Hume's day, and many centuries before Hume, as it is today, and it will make a great difference to your religion whether you mean the one or the other, but which Cleanthes and Philo suppose them- selves to mean is perhaps undiscoverable. Hume, or his personages, are discussing the question whether we can know what the cause of the universe is without knowing what they mean either by the " universe " or by a cause of it ; and this hardly augurs well for their chances of reaching results of permanent value. The logic of Cleanthes is no better than that of Philo, but since Cleanthes has received full measure for his faults and perhaps a little more, from Professor Kemp Smith, I will mention only two instances of this. Since he rests the whole case on what he calls the "experimental" argument from design in nature, he ought at least to state this argument very carefully in a way that will not expose it to unfair and captious criticism. When he has said (Pt. V) of the order of nature that it is " the image of mind reflected from innumerable objects " he has said just what the " teleological proof" requires him to say, neither more nor less, and if he had gone no further, most of the rhetoric with which Philo retorts on him would have been irrelevant. He wantonly plays into Philo's hand and gives his own case away by the quite gratuitous addition that by mind he means "a mind like the human and the liker the better." He does not see that all the " likeness " required by the design argument is simply likeness in the character distinctive of mentality as such, without which it could not be what it is, meaningful and, in Paley's phrase, "prospective " activity. But for his gratuitous further concessions Philo would be precluded from advancing the objection (Pt. VII) that he is judging of the origin of the whole by "the operation of one very small part of nature, to wit man, upon another very small part, to wit the inanimate matter lying within his reach."</page><page sequence="6">184 A. E. TAYLOR. So again even we who have not Demea's confidence in the "simple and sublime " argument a priori, should at least be able to see that Cleanthes' supposed refutation of it is a mere petitio principii. " Whatever we conceive as existent we can also conceive as non-existent," says Cleanthes, and this is one of the premises of his syllogism. As though it had not always been the point of the champions of the " proof a priori " that there is something which we can conceive to exist, but cannot conceive not to exist. It is the business of Cleanthes as the advocate of " experi- mental " theism, either to satisfy us that this proposition is self-evident or to disprove it ; he is not at liberty to use the contradictory of it as part of its own proof. It has been suggested that Cleanthes is Hume's nom de theatre for Butler, but Hume must have read the Analogy to little purpose if he really thought it likely either that a man of Butler's precision of thought would commit this petitio principii or have had no clearer ideas about the nature of analogical reasoning than those which Cleanthes must be made to hold in order to give Philo his opening. It is characteristic of Cleanthes that, for all his con- fidence in the teleological argument for the existence of Deity, his conception of" prospective contrivance " is unduly external; to him it is visible apparently only in the form of manufacture; his Deity is no more than an exceptionally skilful artisan piecing together materials to compose a machine for the execution of a determinate piece of work. There is a profounder " prospective contrivance " than this in any example of a rightly proporti6ned work of art or a well-lived life, but of this Cleanthes seems wholly uncon- scious. There is here no adequate presentment of the teleological reading of nature as understood by Butler, or even by Paley, who, with all his short-comings has a much richer fund of shrewd and balanced sense than is commonly allowed by detractors who have probably never read his works. Nor is Philo, I think (though I say it with all deference to Professor Kemp Smith), a very worthy spokesman of scepticism. There is a kind of scepticism which we can</page><page sequence="7">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 185 hardly prize too highly, the searching critical scepticism which will permit no assumption in philosophy to pass until it has made its claims good under the severest scrutiny of unsleeping intelligence. But such scepticism is methodical and in principle uncompromisingly rational; its very foundation is confidence in the rationality of things. It is precisely because the sceptic of this type is so assured that any account of things which represents them as they really are must be wholly reasonable, that he is always anxious to probe every assertion submitted to him to its depths, and assure himself that it does not conceal some unsuspected irrationality before he will accept it. This is not the scepticism of Philo. His is what Pamphilus justly describes as a " careless " scepticism; Cleanthes hardly goes too far when he speaks of it as " rambling." His business is not to bring his opponent's "experimental " theology to the test of confrontation with assured principles of reason, but merely to throw out a succession of objections which are, or can be temporarily made to look, plausible without much concern for their compatibility with one another. He tells us, for example (Pt. VII), that the world " plainly resembles more an animal or a vegetable than it does a watch or a knitting-loom," so that, if we are to trust to analogical reasoning, we ought to ascribe its formation to unintelligent " generation " rather than to conscious design. The point is a capital one in his reasoning and is treated as such, e.g., by Professor Kemp Smith. Yet the same speaker suose- quently tells us (Pt. X) that he " believes " all the objections to the argument from design, of which he has made so much, are " mere cavils and sophisms," and that "a purpose, an intention, a design, strikes everywhere the most careless, the most stupid thinker; and no man can be so hardened in absurd systems, as at all times to reject it." " Supposing there were a God," he concludes, " were it possible for him to give stronger proofs of his existence, than what appear on the whole face of nature ? " The scepticism which can so lightheartedly contradict itself can hardly be very formidable to the believer ; the theist himself, in the interests of his doctrine must be anxious to see the case for</page><page sequence="8">186 A. E. TAYLOR. the opposition conducted by an advocate who has some regard for principles, and is not, like Philo, a mere " talker for victory." Demea, again, suffers from a profound and hopeless confusion of mind. He is introduced as the champion of " orthodoxy," but his orthodoxy would certainly be danger- ously like gross heresy by the standards of any known Christian community. As a professed enthusiast for the " simple and sublime " argument a priori (which, by the way, he states in a way which confuses the " ontological " with the " cosmological " argument), he should be a strict rationalist in his theology, and the impression that he means to be one is confirmed by our discovery that the only access to knowledge of God he will recognize is that of the " way of revotion," refusal to assert of the " supreme being " any predicate which has an intelligible and determinate meaning. According to him, the character of the " supreme being " is simply utterly unknowable; any attempt to say anything significant about God is " anthropomorphism." He is, in fact, doing exactly what Bradley accused Herbert Spencer of doing, professing to worship something as God simply because no one can say " what the devil it can be." He, too, reaches his position by a glaring petitio principii, the verbal substitution of the phrase " adorable mysteriousness " for complete unknowability, though no one is permitted to utter the pertinent rejoinder that of that which is by hypo- thesis completely unknowable we cannot tell whether it is adorable or the reverse. It should not be necessary to add that, however reached, the thesis that God is simply an insoluble enigma is not, and never has been, Christian " orthodoxy." It is only made to look orthodox by con- fusing the familiar and highly orthodox proposition that God cannot be comprehended by the human intellect with the wholly different assertion that God is completely inappre- hensible. Demea has been supposed to be intended as a representative of the theology of Clarke, but whatever may be the defects of Clarke's famous Boyle lectures, they are, at least, no exposition of this purely " negative " theology. If Hume really meant Demea to stand for Clarke, we could</page><page sequence="9">RELEVANCE OF HUME 'S DIALOGUES. 187 only conclude that he is criticizing what he can never have read with intelligent attention. Professor Kemp Smith has said much that is very true about Cleanthes as an esprit borni. He does not know where to look for the positive evidence for his " experimental " theism, or even how to make the best use of such evidence as he does produce. But, as against the pseudo-rationalism of Demea, Cleanthes is wholly right in insisting that a natural theology which con- fines itself to the " way of revotion " will lead nowhere. I cannot then regard Hume's Dialogues as covering more than a fragment of the ground which would have to be traversed by a really thorough-going sceptical " critique of all speculative theology." They constitute at best, as I think Professor Kemp Smith would allow, an assault on one out of several converging lines of theistic reasoning, the " argument from design," and the argument from design, taken by itself, as I shall not only admit but contend, does not suffice to justify what a worshipper of God means by belief in God. The question is whether it contributes any- thing at all to the case for a theism which, taken alone, it is insufficient to establish. If we accept the destructive criti- cism of Philo, we shall have to concede either (1) that it contributes nothing at all to the case, or (2) alternatively, that even granting that it does yield some faint possibility that the " order of the universe " is due to the " prospective contrivance " of an intelligence or intelligences, it does nothing to show that this intelligence (or intelligences) has (or have) the moral characteristics which would make it (or them) deserving of our love, trust, or devotion. I want to urge on the contrary that as regards (1) the evidence is immensely stronger than Hume was willing to allow, and as regards (2) that his own reasoning in the contrary sense is vitiated all through by a single glaring false assumption characteristic of his century. As to (1) we need, in our discussion of the cause of " order in the universe," in the first place to distinguish two senses of " order " which are all through confused by Hume's disputants, though they are really quite distinct, " causal order " (to use the terminology of Professor Stout)</page><page sequence="10">1 88 A. E. TAYLOR. and "teleological order," organic structure such that-in the language of Kant-the part, in its structure and working, can only be understood by reference to the whole of which it is a part. As Kant rightly maintained, order in both senses is characteristic of the living and organic, but it might be doubted at first sight whether teleological order is to be found in inanimate nature. Philo's attempts to account for the presence of teleological order in the organic realm without presupposing the all-pervading presence of " prospective contrivance, " and of mind, are pretty clearly the weakest part of his case, but there might be more to be said, at least at first sight, for his view that there are no traces of it in the inanimate environment of organisms and so no evidence for an originative mind as the source of the universe. We might then, perhaps, if we, like Philo, are willing to make our appeal to that asylum ignorantiae the " unknown possibilities of nature," suppose that pro- spectively contriving mind has somehow itself come into being in the cursas ordinarius of an order of nature which is merely causal; where mind has made its appearance and is operative there will subsequently be teleological order, as far as the action of mind is effective, but the sphere of these operations is, as Philo has said, narrowly restricted. This is, I suppose, the view commonly adopted in his every-day thinking by the average naturalistic man of science, when he allows himself to forget the metaphysical epiphenomenalism which is his theoretical creed. But there is one objection to it which is, to my own mind fatal, and has been stated so fully and forcibly by Professor Stout in his Mind and Matter that it will be enough for me here simply to mention it without repeating Professor Stout's arguments against it. The supposed production of mind in an originally mindless universe would involve causality of an unique kind, wholly unparalleled elsewhere in the causal order of the physical world. It would not be, like the causal pro- cesses which we follow up in our study of physical nature, a reformation and continuation of antecedent conditions controlled by the maintenance of a fundamental physical constant or constants (such as energy or mass) ; it would, as</page><page sequence="11">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 189 Professor Stout has said, be quite literally creation of mind out of mothing, and creation without a creator. But creation ex nihilo, even with a creator, is not a process of the natural order at all, and the conception of it lies outside the range of science. A philosopher who is also a Christian or Jew or Moslem may believe in the reality of the fact, but he believes in it as a mystery which cannot be made intelligible to the human mind. It would be the death of science to reckon with it as something of which the modus operandi is understood, one process among others going to make up the causal order which he sets himself to follow out and of which he hopes to formulate the law. Hence, every philosopher who has ever seriously envisaged the question has, I believe, come to the conclusion that there is no reason to believe that mind has ever come into being as a result of the causal process in inanimate nature, and every reason to believe that it has not, but must be reckoned with 'as present and operative throughout the whole course of nature, including the enormous stretch of astronomical time which we are taught by science to look on as preceding the appearance of organisms in any part of the universe of which we have any knowledge. Incidentally, we may remark that this consideration disposes at once of an argument of which Philo makes some parade. We repeatedly see intelligence caused by genera- tion, he says, whenever an animal begets its like, but we never see generation caused by intelligence (or design). This is, of course, formally the familiar fallacy of the " unex- plored remainder." Philo singles out the most strikingly obvious antecedent to the appearance of the new organism, the copulation of the parent organisms, and treats it as by itself the complete cause or condition of the event, forgetting that this is no more than a convenient abstractive device, and that the full causal explanation of the event is impossible without taking into account the whole background of the universe. He talks as a man might talk if he supposed the dropping of the match into the powder-barrel to be the complete cause of the ensuing explosion. If there is good reason to regard the presence and operation of mind as</page><page sequence="12">190 A. E. TAYLOR. all-pervasive throughout the frame of things, his statement that we constantly see intelligence produced from generation will no longer be true in the sense in which it requires to be true for the purpose of his reasoning. All-pervasive intelligence will be there as part of the unexplored back- ground of every natural event, and he has no right to assume that it has been idle and inoperative. All that he has proved is merely that the particular embodied intelli- gences of the parents (who may, indeed, have been drunk at the time) were not concerned in the production of the result-a proposition which Cleanthes himself would be under no need to deny. Further-it is not in the least a novel or original remark on my part-we may pertinently ask how it is that if the causal order in the universe at large is due to some cause foreign to intelligence, we ever come to discover that order and to discover it the more fully as intelligence develops. The mere existence of a causal order in virtue of which the character of present events determines how they shall be continued would not of itself afford any guarantee that this order should be ascertainable to us. It is easy to think of comparatively small differences in the detailed constitution of our environment which would have made the discovery of causal laws in nature at large impossible to us. Yet they have already been largely discovered and it is at least a working faith without which the pursuit of science would soon die out from mankind that the more resolutely we set ourselves to discover them, the more successful we shall be. The more completely we realize our apparently unfavourable position as denizens of a small satellite of an insignificant star lost among the many other millions of stars in the universe, the more marvellous must our success in penetrating the secrets of nature appear to ourselves, so long as we think of ourselves naturalistically. If the fact impressed Hume's contemporaries less than it impresses us, they have the sound excuse that they could hardly have anticipated the successes we have witnessed, since in their day nothing was known of sub-molecular physics, chemistry was in its infancy, and astronomy had nothing certain to</page><page sequence="13">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 191 teach of anything beyond the limits of a not yet fully explored solar system. From the point of view of our fuller knowledge, how are we to explain our knowledge of nature ; how are we to account for the adaptation of the gigantic natural order around us to our faculty of thought, except, indeed, on the Platonic assumption that there is an intelli- gence embedded in the whole structure of nature to which man is responsive ? If the causal order is itself the product of intelligence, we can understand why it should disclose itself progressively to our intelligence as our intelligence develops; if it is independent of intelligence, the whole success of science would seem to be due to a pre-established harmony which is a wholly unintelligible mystery without why or wherefore. The full force of the " argument from design " will never be appreciated so long as we are content to reduce it to the contention that since a watch has a watch-maker a universe must have a universe-maker. The real and irresistible argument is rather that our success in increasing understanding of the pattern of things is itself the evidence that the pattern is due to omnipresent all- pervading intelligence as its source. The enormous extension of our scientific knowledge of physical reality since the days of Hume has not weakened the force of the argument; it has made it immeasurably stronger. To turn to the consideration of teleological order in particular, the type of order which is specially contemplated in the argument from design as commonly stated. We may describe the general character of teleological order well enough by Paley's phrase, which I have already used more than once," prospective contrivance." Still better we may speak of it with Kant as the type of order found in any complex such that the structure and behaviour of the parts is only intelligible by reference to the whole or which they are parts. Cleanthes is, of course, wrong in reasoning so often, as he does, as though the one typical example of such teleological order were a machine constructed to execute a determinate piece of work. Nothing is less machine-like than a finely wrought poem or other work of art, or a worthily and wisely lived life. The full significance and</page><page sequence="14">192 A. E. TAYLOR. justification of the phrasing and rhythm of the individual lines of the poem, or the arrangement of its stanzas, is only to be found in the total effect of the whole upon the duly sensitive and intelligent hearer. The significance and justi- fication of a man's conduct during a given episode of his life is unintelligible apart from the context of that episode in just this whole life of devotion to just these ideals. Hence a peculiarity of rhythm or phrasing which would be a blemish in a poem aiming at a different total effect may be a conspicuous beauty in the poem before me, because it contributes to the particular effect the whole is intended to produce; an act which in a different setting would be a fault may actually be virtuous where it is called for by the demands of devotion, in some special setting, to a worthy ideal. The purpose of a poem-unless it is deliberately didactic, and, in fact, propagandist, and so artistically bad- or the ruling purpose of a whole life worthily lived cannot be set forth in any single unambiguous formula like that which describes the effect for whch a machine has been designed. Any formula which will fittingly describe the purpose of either (e.g., that the purpose of the poem is " to hold the mirror up to nature," or to recall emotion to our contemplation in tranquillity, or the purpose of the life to " glorify God " or to serve mankind) must necessarily have an indetermination in it which is a reflection of the freedom characteristic alike of great art and of noble living. But the poem or the life are none the less through and through expressions of purpose ; to be aimless would be ruinous to either. Indeed, both are truly more adequate examples of purposive activity than the construction of watches, houses and ships. For the good poem and the good life are embodi- ments of purposive activities which are worth pursuing simply on their own account, for their inherent goodness, whereas the making of watches, houses and ships is only worth while because of the inconveniences to which we should be put if we could not measure the lapse of time, shelter our bodies against the cold, or communicate with one another across the seas. Understanding teleology in this sense, then, it is of</page><page sequence="15">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 193 course obvious and is not denied by any of the speakers in Hume that teleological order does exist in nature; the organisms of vegetables and plants are undeniable examples of wholes whose parts can only be understood in the light of an idea of the whole. The whole is admittedly no mere resultant of the juxtaposition of the parts; they are and are what they are in virtue of their being one and all alike parts of the whole, instrumental to its life or functioning as a unitary whole. The issues at stake are whether unity of this kind extends throughout the universe or is confined to a " small part " of it, the realms of the organisms with which we on our planet are acquainted, and whether, if it is pervasive of the universe, the fact is sufficient evidence of the presence of controlling mind in nature at large. Philo's attempts to argue for a negative conclusion on both points are, as it seems to me, failures, partly for reasons no con- temporary of Hume could have foreseen, partly for reasons which Hume ought to have been able to see. In the first place, it is indispensable to Philo's case that we should concede that teleological order is not, like causal order in general, universal ; it is confined to a " small part " of the universe and it must be legitimate to conceive the possibility at least that it has risen there as a consequence of mere causal order. We should be able to see, as an eighteenth century philosopher excusably might not, what the paradox of the position is. It is that the whole process of the " evolution " of organic form has a definite direction towards the future. The adaptations which disclose them- selves in the history of the development of the individual are what Paley calls them, " prospective contrivances," adaptations not simply to the present situation of the moment but to what will be the future situation of the developing organism. And in the one case where we are able to write the history of the evolution of species, there, too, we seem to have direction of the same kind. The history of evolution on our planet has been steadily towards the development of a type which is not merely adapted to its actual environment but has displayed a steadily advanc- ing power of self-adaptation in advance to an indefinite N</page><page sequence="16">194 A. E. TAYLOR. range of variability in its environment. Our own species does not " survive " like some deep sea organism by finding a relatively unchanging environment and shedding all endowments which are superfluous in such a habitat, but by making itself at home wherever it may go. If less intelligent species have to adapt themselves to the environment in which they find themselves or be eliminated, man's way is to adapt his environment to his own ideals of what he finds satisfactory. Now the causal laws of physical nature are one and all non-prospective, they are without this forward- pointing reference. Indeed one of them, and the one which figures most prominently in the writings of recent writers on physics, the principle of Carnot at least seems to run directly counter to this trend of organic evolution. As James Ward has said, it is catabolic whereas the advance of life and organization is anabolic, so that it is not surprising to find Philo twice over by implication denying what seems now to be regarded as the chief corner-stone of physics, the principle of the degeneration of energy. Merely as a form of words the objections of Philo sound well enough. Why, he argues, may not the " material universe " fall into order of itself, or why may not the order in it be due to some unknown character of its own ? And if you once with the Theist assume that the order in the material world is due to controlling intelligence, must you not by parity of reasoning, assume a similar cause, extrinsic to itself, for the "ideal order " the Theist has asserted to be characteristic of the divine mind ? If an extrinsic cause is wanted for the one, it must be equally wanted for the other. But the reasoning is only superficially specious, and falls to pieces the moment one realizes that the " order " to be accounted for is not merely causal, but, in the case of the organic part of the " material universe " teleological also. If the suggestion that the order in the " material world" may be due to some unknown character of the material as such is to have any relevant meaning, its sense must be that teleological order, " prospective " adaptation can be explained by reference to the causal laws of the physical sciences, and that possibility is excluded by the</page><page sequence="17">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 195 considerations on which we have been dwelling. Nor is the criticism that order in the " mental " world is in the same case really sound. The retort could only be made by a believer in the now exploded psychology which reduces mental life to a mere juxtaposition of "impressions and ideas," and the author of the Treatise on Human Nature must have been aware that his own magnum opus was the reductio ad absurdum of this associationist empiricism. The important point is that teleological order in the " material world " does demand some extrinsic cause as its explanation precisely because the " material world " means the whole world in so far as it is explicable solely by the laws of physical science, and the laws of physical science, as we have just said, contain nothing which could furnish the required explanation. That the operations of intelligence should exhibit teleological order, on the contrary, requires no similar appeal to an extrinsic cause, precisely because it is prospective forward-looking interest which is the distinctive kind of unity characteristic of mental activity ; unity of conative interest is characteristic of intelligence as such as extension, for example, is of body. It is of the nature of mind that the phases of a mental process should be held together by unity of forward-looking interest, as it is of the nature of bodies that their unity should be spatial, i.e., that the unity in virtue of which we speak of a body as one body should lie in the fact that the extensions of its parts are the constituents of the extension of the whole body. It might, I know, be objected that these considerations only show that wherever there is mind there will also be teleological order; they do not of themselves warrant the conclusion which Cleanthes wants to draw, that wherever there is teleological order there is the presence of mind. But let us reflect again. In the case of body (using the word body here in the strictly geometrical sense) it is not merely that the volumes of the parts of a body are parts of the volume of the whole body. We may add that the volumes of the parts, and their spatial relations to one another, completely constitute the volume of the whole. Take away the volumes of the parts and their locations N2</page><page sequence="18">196 A. E. TAYLOR. relative to each other, and the whole has vanished ; there is nothing left. Similarly in the case of a mind ; suppress its various phases, each of which has its own characteristic unity of teleological interest, and suppress also the thread of continuous teleological unity of interest which links them together, and there is nothing whatever left. Hence, if we can say that there is teleological unity pervading the universe as a whole, the cause of that order, in the sense of the principle which makes the universe the kind of unity it is, is not merely " remotely analogous " to the principle which gives unity to our conscious life and which we call a " mind " ; it is identical with it in the distinctive character which makes mental life what it is. And to say so much is not to fall into the " anthropomorphite heresy" of which Philo and Demea join in accusing Cleanthes. There is teleological order wherever we are warranted in asserting the presence of an individual mind, however humble, but minds differ immensely in the degree of teleological unity which they reveal. The mental life of any man, however ordinary, has a unity of far-reaching "prospective" adaptation about it which we are not warranted in ascribing to that of a cat or a dog ; their lives are, by comparison, what Aristotle calls bad plays without any central unity of idea, " episodic," and the same thing is, I presume, still truer of the mental life of creatures lower in the organic scale than cats and dogs. And there may equally well be any number of types of mental life by comparison with which the life of the wisest philosopher or statesman known to human history would be "episodic." The " argument from design," rightly stated, thus does not presuppose any presumptuous ascription to the mind it infers as the source of cosmical teleological order of defects or limitations imposed on the minds embodied in human organisms by this embodiment. It is true enough that if the argument is to have any force we must be able to assert the presence of teleological order throughout nature universally, not merely in one small part of nature " to wit," the part of our human environment on this planet which we can consciously mould</page><page sequence="19">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 197 to our own ends. But it seems plain that we have the right to make the assertion. For (1) the fact of " prospective contrivance," or in other words, of the existence of wholes such that their parts can only be understood by reference to the " idea of the whole " is patent ; every living organism, however simple, is an instance in point ; and Philo's attempt to evade the implications of the fact by suggesting that even supposing the universe to be originally devoid of any principle of " order," it must, after a sufficient antecedent amount of randomness, settle down into some sort of order which will thereafter be self-sustaining is manifestly a subter- fuge. Even if" order " be taken here to mean causal order and nothing more specific, there is no reason why random- ness should ever give rise to anything but randomness, why, for example, an epoch in which events followed on one another purely at random should be inevitably succeeded by one in which there is a routine marked by such principles as the conservation of energy or of mass. The empirical illustrations adduced of supposedly disorderly processes which result in the establishment of subsequent " order " only seem to be telling because in our thought of them we already unwittingly presuppose causal order as self-existing in the epoch of " randomness." If, for example, we find it natural that pebbles lying on the same beach, which were originally of every kind of shape, should in course of time be rounded by the waves into much the same standard shape and size, we only find this natural because we are all along presupposing both that there is regularity in the recurrence and impact of the waves and that exposure to the same environmental conditions will have corresponding consequences in the case of different pebbles; that is, we are presupposing that there has been causal order throughout the supposed period of " randomness." And if what Philo means is that " order" which is only causal order must somehow, of itself, give rise to order which is not only causal but teleological, his assumption, as we have already seen, is simply incredible. It is equivalent to the assumption that, to borrow an illustration from James Ward, printer's " pie " would only have to be shuffled often enough to end</page><page sequence="20">198 A. E. TAYLOR. by producing the text of Hamlet. And it is an obvious criticism of such an assumption that the supposed result will not have even the faintest mathematical probability unless the number of letters, etc., contained in the " pie " is finite and the number of the repetitions of each letter and stop has been in itself deliberately controlled with a view to making this particular shuffle possible. Kant then seems to me to be entirely right in the Critique of Judgment when he insisted that the principle of teleological order is indis- pensable in all the sciences which deal with organic life. Where he does seem unreasonable is in his further character- istic contention that the principle though indispensable, is " only heuristic," an invaluable clue to discovery, but nothing more. For we may rationally ask how any principle can be so valuable a clue in the discovery of a truth unless it itself is at least a very close approximation to the truth, and how it can be indispensable for discovery unless it is, in fact, actually true. Presuming, then, that teleological order is a genuine characteristic of the organic realm, we have to assume that we cannot logically stop short here, especially when we bear in mind the insuperable objections already pointed out to the conception that mind, which is in its very nature teleological, can be a product or " emergent " resultant of anything which is not itself mind. We have to remember what the relation of mind embodied in the organisms we know to its " environment " really is. The environment of organisms is something more than a background against which they are set off, or a stage on which they make their appearance. It is also the physical and chemical stuff of which they are in the end made and continue to make themselves, as long as they remain in being; their life is an uninterrupted process of give-and-take between them- selves and the " environment," and it must therefore be of a kind such that this give-and-take intercourse is possible. The appearance of organic life on our planet may be, measured in terms of astronomical time, quite a recent thing, but that it should have appeared at all presupposes that there has been from the first a preadaptation of our</page><page sequence="21">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 199 planet to the coming " emergence " not only of organic life in general, but of our human life with all its wealth of scientific, aesthetic, moral, religious content. And the pre- adaptation cannot be confined to our planet, since it again is not set against the rest of corporal nature as against a mere neutral background. The preadaptation, if real at all, must involve the whole history of the formation of our sun and its satellites, of the galaxy, and, in the end, of the whole " physical Universe." " Prospective contrivance " if real at all, cannot be what Philo represents it as being, a peculiarity of a very restricted region of the " world " ; unless we are to take refuge in the self-contradictory concept of an inexplicable pre-established harmony which no one ever has established, it must be co-extensive with the whole range of being. Only an inarticulate apprehension of this exigence of reason will suffice to justify the respect with which Kant says we ought always to speak of the argument from design, a respect which it would certainly not deserve if it were really obnoxious to the strictures which the Critique of Pure Reason takes over from Philo. There is, however, one point on which Kant and Philo are clearly not to be answered. The argument from design, I contend, properly understood, is valid as an argument for the operative presence of prospective contri- vance, and therefore of mind, everywhere in the history of the universe. But it is not sufficient, by itself, to warrant us in affirming the existence of what Kant means by God. It is at least doubtful whether it would suffice to establish the unity of the mind it enables us to descry behind the order of the universe, its omniscience, or its sovereign control of nature. And it certainly does not justify us in ascribing to that mind the moral character without which a good man cannot find it an object of unqualified worship and trust. So far as our argument has taken us, the order of nature might be due to the " prospective contrivance " of a plurality of minds, and possibly of minds at cross- purposes with one another. Or if it is in the end due to a single mind, that mind might be one of limited intelligence, or might be coping very imperfectly with a " matter "</page><page sequence="22">200 A. E. TAYLOR. refractory to its own ends. Or its ends might be merely those of the inhuman and non-moral super-mathematician imagined by Sir James Jeans, and one cannot worship mere mathematical ingenuity. The really vital thing, as it seems to me, that calls for being said on all these points except the last, has been said not by Hume but by Kant in the Critique of Judgment, though Philo may perhaps be said to be dimly fumbling after it. What we really need to be satisfied of is not simply the patent fact that there is teleology in nature, that one part or one process in nature stands to another as end to means, but that nature as a whole system has an end other than its own existence. And, as Kant said, if we are looking for something which can without absurdity be thought of as the end for which nature as a whole exists, and apart from which nature is not rationally intelligible, we can find such an end only in the life of intelligent and moral personality. If this is an absolute end to which the existence of nature is a means, then, no doubt, from the unity of purpose bestowed on nature by its thorough-going subordination to this end, we can reasonably infer the unity of the mind which discloses itself in nature ; if we cannot assert this unity of Endzweck, we shall have to agree with Kant that the "polytheists" of the ancient world were interpreting the evidence of nature more faith- fully by their belief in a multitude of" departmental " gods with conflicting aims and purposes. And the mere appeal to the empirical evidence of teleology in nature will not of itself enable us to decide the issue of theism as against polydemonism. If the argument is to conclude not merely to the effective presence of mind throughout nature but to the existence of God, the " teleological proof" will have to be integrated with the "moral proof," the only one regarded by Kant himself as in principle sound. Or rather what will have to be integrated with the "teleological proof" as commonly understood is the " moral proof," not in the round-about and half-hearted form in which Kant actually presents it, but in the directer and more cogent form in which he might have presented</page><page sequence="23">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 201 it had he done full justice to the central thought of his own doctrine of practical reason. The central thought of Kant's doctrine of the practical reason is that if the structure of the universe is rational at all, it must be so in a double sense, since it is one and the same reason which is both speculative and practical. An intelligible world must be a unity not merely in the sense that there is the thorough-going causal intercommunication between all its constituent parts which renders all transactions between these parts capable of unending reduction to natural law; it must also be intelligible in the further sense that the apparent conflict of purposes which runs through the life-histories of persons is unified by the all-pervading presence of a single uniform purpose disclosed to us in the moral law. The supreme principle upon which a rational moral law rests must therefore have the same status and validity as that supreme scientific principle which we may conveniently, though loosely, speak of in customary fashion as the " uniformity of nature." The moral law of unconditional obligation must have the same validity as the most universal laws- whatever they may prove to be-of natural science. To doubt this would be to doubt the rationality of the whole system of the universe. Now the very existence of any unconditional moral obligation is, if Kant's critical analysis of morality is sound in principle, bound up with the recognition of rational personality itself as the one thing of absolute and uncondi- tional worth, the self-justifying end which pervades and unifies all our moral endeavour. To substitute any other end for this in our scheme of ethics is to deny that the moral law expresses a true exigency of reason, and to reduce it to a mere device for effecting results which it is a mere accident of our particular position as animals with a specific physique and environment that we happen to desire. We must, in fact, choose between pronouncing all morality to be in the end something unreasonable, and in the literal sense of the word, chimerical, and venturing on the affirmation that the production and development of moral personality is itself the unifying purpose which runs through the whole course</page><page sequence="24">202 A. E. TAYLOR. of nature, and pervades it as a principle which is no mere unrealized ideal but is actually attained. If we venture on this affirmation, then, as it seems to me, the foundations of theism are secured, as I think has been sufficiently shown in detail in Sorley's well-known volume Moral Values and the Idea of God, where the central thought of Kant is exhibited independently of Kant's own unfortunate ditour which gives the misleading impression that God is being brought into the critical philosophy merely to provide virtue with a post- humous pourboire (Kant's real point is not that the existence of God makes the practice of virtue worth while but that it makes absolute obligation rational). Here, in the conception of moral personality not merely as an end to which certain processes in nature are in fact instrumental but as the end which gives nature its unity, we have, I contend, a true reason for thinking of mind not merely as somehow present everywhere in nature but as in supreme and unitary control of the whole process of nature. And if we think out all that is implied in this supreme and absolute control, we shall, I am sure, not be satisfied until we have replaced Cleanthes conception of an " artificer " by that of a creator from whom nature derives not merely its " order " but its whole existence. The reasoning, it may be allowed, is not formal demonstration, but is only not demonstrative because it goes deeper than all demon- stration. All demonstration is, as we know, ex praeconcessis et praecognitis and therefore presupposes faith in reason itself, since without such faith there can be neither praeconcessa nor praecognita. You cannot demonstrate the reality of indefea- sible obligation any more than you can demonstrate the " uniformity of nature " to any one who seriously doubts about either, but in both cases the doubt, if it is more than a mere pretence, is a strictly unreasonable doubt of reason itself. What I have already said contains in substance the criticism I shall pass upon that part of Hume's reasoning to which he himself appears to attach most weight, his attempt to prove that even the " remote analogy " he admits to subsist between the " cause of order " in the</page><page sequence="25">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 203 universe and the human mind breaks down when we try to attribute moral character to that cause. I need not recapitulate the arguments of Philo in any detail ; they are common-places of the pessimists of all ages, and can in substance be condensed into a single sentence. He contents himself with the contention that pain, struggle, and error are uncomfortable conditions and could therefore never have been introduced into nature by a benevolent " author." That is, he baldly assumes that if nature has a moral purpose at all, that purpose can only be the Hedonistic one of pro- viding as much enjoyment for everyone and everything as possible. That the assumption could be made and be allowed to pass unchallenged by Cleanthes--one could hardly look for serious criticism to a Schwachkopf like Demea-is characteristic of the superficiality with which both Hume and most of his contemporaries habitually treated the moral problem. Kant said the last word on this Hedonistic psychology when he remarked that such a purpose would be wholly unworthy of any God whom we can really reverence, and that we shall be thinking more worthily of our Creator if we suppose his purpose to have been to make us capable of rendering ourselves deserving of" happiness " by our own free activity. Why there should be all the pain and hardship that there is in the world we shall, of course, never know while we are still " in the world," but if the purpose subserved by " nature" is the education of beings with the seeds of reason in them into freedom of thought and action, there must be hardships and struggles if the lesson is to be learned. Men will not become profound thinkers, when there are no puzzles and difficulties to call out the strenuous exercise of thinking, nor will they become free moral agents capable of steadily following right " in scorn of consequence," because it is right, where there are no " consequences " to be wrestled with. In the sort of Paradise of the indolent which Philo thinks (or pretends to think) a really good Creator would have constructed there would be no moral heroism (and perhaps Hume who professes to believe that true " virtue " summons us only to a life of " frolic and</page><page sequence="26">204 A. E. TAYLOR. gaiety" would not much have deplored its absence), but there would equally be no Humes or Newtons, for there would be no occasion to think at all. One may even doubt whether Philo's imaginary Hedonists' Paradise would even attain its own, not very exalted, proposed end. In a land of lotus-eaters one could expect to find a general weariness of the round of cheaply-won satisfactions, or, at least, if the inhabitants escaped boredom, it would only be because they were " doped " into continuous insensibility. There is a pathetic point in the old anecdote of the over-driven domestic drudge whose relations wrote on her tombstone " She's gone to do nothing for ever and ever," but though "doing nothing" might be a welcome temporary relief from eternally doing under another's orders things not worth doing, an eternity of indolence is not what any of us would deliberately choose as the crown of human felicity. That is not " the " rest which remaineth to the people of God." I am only too sensible that if I ever had any character as a " thinker " to lose-and I do not suppose I ever had much-I have probably ruined it beyond redemption by these remarks. Empiricism seems for the moment to be in the ascendant again, and I have made it abundantly clear that the only work of Hume which makes any deep impres- sion on me is the Treatise, in which Hume has once for all exposed the bankruptcy of empirical philosophy. I have ventured to commend the sound commonsense of the almost universally discredited Paley. And I must end by saying what will probably discredit me more still. For all the misplaced jauntiness of Cleanthes and all the limitations of his imagination, I concur with Pamphilus in thinking that his " principles " are nearer to the truth than those of Philo, if, indeed, Philo can be said to have any principles. Nature is, to be sure, not a gigantic " knitting-loom," but, when all is said, nature is more like a knitting-loom than it is like an animal or a vegetable. And a rational philosophy which is not simply blind to the " practical " use of reason can hardly deny that nature is like the knitting-loom in a point of fundamental importance: both are structures</page><page sequence="27">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 205 which have a significance relative to something beyond themselves; both are instrumental to something. Hence, if I can accept the judgment of Professor Kemp-Smith that Hume's Dialogues have made it impossible for the argument from design to be successfully defended by the kind of reasoning put into the mouth of Cleanthes, I can only do so on condition that I am allowed to add a further remark : they have also made it impossible to attack the argument by the sort of reasoning used against it by Philo. This, in fact, seems also to have been the opinion of Kant.</page><page sequence="28">II.-By J. LAIRD. BY arrangement, I am writing this paper without having seen Mr. Taylor's, and shall address myself to a part only of the theme we have to discuss to-night. The situation both of philosophy and of theology at the present time, as it seems to me, is complicated, confusing and often confused ; and the subject we have to discuss, the relevance of Hume's Dialogues to this contemporary situation, can scarcely escape the taint of perplexity. Whether all, or most, of Hume's arguments are " dated " and time-blown, whether he himself by his very success contributed largely to their antiquation, whether they are forgotten to-day rather than refuted or superseded, are questions of more than merely historical importance ; but I shall not pay equal attention to each of them. Instead I shall, almost always, ask you to consider what Hume's principal contentions were and their perennial importance for philosophical theology in the Western (and therefore largely in the Christian) tradition. A preliminary question of exegesis cannot be wholly avoided, but I should like to be very brief about it. It is often asked whether Hume was Philo or whether he was Cleanthes. That seems to me to be a misleading question. Some dialogue-writers have used such a plan. Berkeley was Philonous. Descartes in his unfinished " Recherche de la verite " was Eudoxe. Hobbes was " B " in the Decameron Physiologicum ; but the Ciceronian type of dialogue that Hume chose does not permit such canons of interpretation. Each collocutor develops his point of view in successive short speeches and the author has failed if the voice of any one of them is definitely his own. No doubt Hume, despite all his " artfulness," might have failed in this particular. There is not very much that is dramatic in the Dialogues, but Hume may have tried to import a dramatic quality by deliberately dramatizing himself and some of his friends. In so far as he did so, he was Philo and Elliot was Cleanthes. Dr. Blair or some other common friend may have imparted some vestiges</page><page sequence="29">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 207 of vitality to the marionette Demea compounded of Pascal and of Samuel Clarke. In the main, however, I do not think that Hume failed often or signally in this way. There is much more gusto, it is true, in what Philo says than in what Cleanthes says, but the nature of the case explains most of that. In substance, Cleanthes had just one big thing to say, and Philo had a lot to say ; but volubility is not the same thing as importance. Demea is " managed " and eventually dismissed. If he had a better case than Hume and the all-too-cool eighteenth century supposed, that defect in the philosophy of the Dialogues persists and may " date " them in a sense that is unfavourable. But although Hume was not Demea he may well have been very often Cleanthine ; and I think he was. If (wrongly, as I suppose) we concluded that Hume was Philo we should have another exegetical problem on our hands, namely, the question where, in the end, Philo stood ; for it is plain at the finish that Philo, ostensibly at least, was prepared to enter into some sort of concordat with Cleanthes. It may be suggested, it is true, that Philo's concessions are so slight that only the dull could be deceived, so slight indeed as to damage the artfulness of their irony. Of that I shall say that the inference does not seem to me to be constraining. Again, it may be suggested that enigma, aporia, a huge question mark, is all that is left. Of that I shall say that I do not think it is all, although it seems to me to be quite certainly a part of what is meant to be conveyed. This being premised, let me turn to what I take to be the primary theme of these Dialogues. They are in the main between Cleanthes and Philo. Demea, in principle, does not count. They are chiefly concerned with deism (in the sense of that term in which it is contrasted with a moral or fatherly theism) and specifically with the deistic Argument from Design. In other words, one plain inference from them is that the argument to God's providence, and to all that, in an ethical way, should affect " human action or forbearance " is admitted, either silently or expressly, to be very weak. More specifically still, the substance of them has to do with the resources of experi-</page><page sequence="30">208 J. LAIRD. mental deism, that is to say, with the resources of what Hume in the Treatise called " the experimental method " and applied in the Dialogues to natural theology. Philo and Cleanthes, being men of sense, agree that the inductive- analogical method is the only one that can be used with any success at all in any enquiry into causes, whether about the birth of a midge or about the birth of a world. They differ about the resources of this experimental method with regard to deism. For them the pulse of the affair is whether or not positivism is the last word in inductive-analogical argument. I say "positivism " not " scepticism," for Cleanthes per- sistently affirms, and Philo is always prepared to admit, that scepticism readily turns into extravagance. (Its extrava- gance, according to Philo, may sometimes be salutary and, in certain senses, is not always refutable, but he allows that it should not weigh with sensible people.) In other words, Philo and Cleanthes are agreed that the experimental method is capable of yielding sound (although not, in all senses, metaphysically invincible) information about natural causes. To that extent they are both good experimental positivists. They differ because Cleanthes asserts from the first, and throughout, that the experimental argument to a Designer of Nature " flows in upon him with a force like that of sensation." Philo while prepared in the end to accept (or at any rate not incontinently to deny) a mitigated form of the Cleanthine thesis, is anxious, for the most part, to contend quite seriously (that is, without more sceptical extravagance than befits his temperament) that the argu- ments in favour of stopping at positivism are very strong indeed. It is these arguments, I believe, that were so disturbing to mild and comfortable deists like Adam Smith. If I am right in this interpretation, I can reasonably claim that an argument similar to the main argument of the Dialogues is just what should have been expected from Hume's pen. From youth up, as we know, he was sedu- lously occupied, indeed pre-occupied, with theological argument. Again, the principal aim of his " experi- mental " philosophy was to justify sensitive as opposed to</page><page sequence="31">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 209 rationalistic belief in causes, and so to provide an adequate basis for the sciences, and, more especially, for the more " human " among the sciences. Judged by rationalistic canons (he maintained), no causes could be established. There the sceptic could always triumph ; but there was a " sensi- tive " belief for men of sense, a kind of horse-sense that was not simple mulishness. I do not say that Hume succeeded in this justification, that he could effectively distinguish between prejudiced and sensible expectations, between unmetaphysical " science " and stubborn fantasy, between logical and illogical " alogic." But he set out to do that very thing. His solution was that beliefs that flowed in upon us with the force of a sensation were as good as sensa- tion itself. They " peopled the world " for us, and were all that should properly be meant by reality. Such beliefs were not mere prejudices, any more than the testimony of the senses themselves was a prejudice, and there was a genuine and very important question whether beliefs of this order had to be banished from theology and restricted to physical and moral science. The upshot of the Dialogues I take to be that the massive, impressionistic argument for deism is strong and even, perhaps, invincible, but that this totalitarian experimentalism is profoundly different from the positive paths of the sciences. Both are " experimental " (or at least " sensitive " and experiential), but experi- mental deism cannot be positivistic, and is seriously at fault if it applies positivistic canons without recognizing the essential difference between sensitive belief that is positivistic and sensitive belief that is impressionistic-totalitarian. I shall now attempt to support this interpretation of Hume's argument by offering an epitome of its main features in an artlessly pemmicanized dialogue. (The pages refer to Mr. Kemp Smith's edition of the Dialogues.) Philo: I cannot persistently retain the Pyrrhonian attitude in economics, criticism or other such sciences, but I may legitimately be a Pyrrhonist " beyond human affairs and the properties of the surrounding bodies " (166). Cleanthes : An eclectic philosophy is an absurdity. A 0</page><page sequence="32">210 J. LAIRD. good experimentalist has to accept natural theology along with the other sciences. Philo : " Our ideas reach no further than our experience : We have no experience of divine attributes and operations : I need not conclude my syllogism " (176). Cleanthes : The argument a posteriori shows that the universe is a well-contrived machine whose Author " must be somewhat similar to the mind of man " (177). Philo : The voice of experience is feeble here. Theistic analogy must at the best be vague. Indeed divine " contri- vance " is more dissimilar than similar to human (178). How can the order in Nature argue the order of Nature ? Thought is one spring of order, but there are others, such as growth [Here Philo is vehement and at least half in earnest.] In a large sense of the words, we have experience of the birth of a planet, but not of the birth of the universe. " Cite your experience and deliver your theory " (187). Cleanthes : When I survey the universe " the idea of a contriver immediately flows in upon me with a force like that of sensation." Any objection is an affront to sensitive belief, and is only extravagant Pyrrhonism (191). Philo [" a little embarrassed and confounded " (192)] : Order must somewhere be ultimate, either in the world or in God. Why not stop with the world? How avoid an infinite regress ? Why, if the physical world requires an ordering principle, should the mental world not require one also ? Cleanthes : But I do stop. Mind, as a principle of order, does satisfy me. Nothing else does. " I have found a Deity" (202). Philo : You have now to argue for "a mind like the human " and indeed " the liker the better." You ought to become "a perfect anthropomorphite " (208), and must certainly banish infinity and perfection from your conception of deity. Cleanthes : Now you are becoming extravagant ; but all your whimsical exaggerations are variants upon the theme of design. So you are really on my side. Philo : Let me continue the experimental argument. In</page><page sequence="33">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 211 all our experience is it not the truth that mental order depends upon bodily order and not contrariwise ? Cleanthes [hesitating] : Your new principle would involve the eternity of the world. Philo : Why not ? If I were a materialist (which I am not), what would prevent me from maintaining that there is " an eternal inherent principle of order to the world " ? (215). More generally : It seems to me that the universe has a certain analogy to a growing vegetable and to a mind- product and to an orderly collocation of matter. " In this little corner of the world alone there are four principles, reason, instinct, generation, vegetation, which are similar to each other, and are the causes of similar effects. . . . Any one of these four principles above mentioned (and a hundred others which lie open to our conjecture) may afford us a theory by which to judge of the origin of the world, and it is palpable and egregious partiality to confine our view entirely to that principle, by which our own minds operate.... Were this principle more intelligible on that account, such a partiality might be somewhat excusable : But reason, in its internal fabric and structure, is really as little known to us as instinct or vegetation ; and perhaps even that vague undeterminate word, nature, to which the vulgar refer everything, is not at bottom more inexplicable. The effects of these principles are all known to us from experience: But the principles themselves, and their manner of operation, are totally unknown" (220). Cleanthes : Another instance of your Pyrrhonian fertility. Philo : Not at all. Such conjectures are " entirely owing to the nature of the subject " (224). I must repeat, Clean- thes, that you are turning the lesson of experience upside down. In experience, " ideas are copied from real objects : you reverse this order and give thought the precedence" (229). [That, I submit, is the substance of the main argument regarding experimental deism. The discussion passes next to providential theism, and there Philo is very confident, the reader being plainly expected to agree. In this respect the anti-theist is said to have an easy task. The presumption of o2</page><page sequence="34">212 J. LAIRD. experience is for him and not against him ; but according to Philo the presumption, of experimental deism was and remains in favour of deism. " The beauty and fitness of final causes strike us with such irresistible force that all objections appear (what I believe they really are) mere cavils and sophisms " (248). In other words, Philo, on p. 248, is disposed to accept Cleanthes's cardinal affirmation on p. 191. As it seems to me the concluding Part XII is not dis- similar.] Philo : "A purpose, an intention, a design, strikes every- where the most careless, the most stupid thinker; and no man can be so hardened in absurd systems as at all times to reject it " (264). Cleanthes : That is my conviction too. It must " imme- diately strike all unprejudiced apprehensions " (267). Philo : "Yes. With an important reservation, these are my unfeigned sentiments " (271). The reservation is that in all these matters the dissimilarities are not less noteworthy than the similarities. Consequently the analogy to mental contrivance, although genuine, must be rather slight, even if it be a little stronger than the analogy to primordial vegeta- tion. It is therefore irrelevant to the more personal and moral attributes of the theist's God, to " human action or forbearance." I contend for a " plain philosophical assent " to a principle that cannot be further defined, namely, that " the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence " (282), that is to say, specifically to human intelligence, but not to human morality. Despite its brevity, I believe that the above summary liquidates the main argument in Hume's Dialogues with something approaching accuracy. If so the moral, I think, is as follows : Let it be agreed that experimental evidence can alone be decisive regarding all questions of origin and of matter-of-fact. Let it be agreed that experimentally grounded belief is sensitive, not rationalistic. Let it be agreed, further (reluctantly in certain quarters) that the moral and beneficent claims of theism outrun all conceivable</page><page sequence="35">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 213 experimental evidence. The question still remains whether positivism in the sciences and in common life marks the limit of justifiable experimental enquiry, or whether there may still be room for a convincing sensitive belief in deism. The inference I should draw from Hume's Dialogues is that positivism does not exhaust the resources of sensitive belief with regard to these questions of origin, indeed that the experimental deist may well have a better case than the agnostic experimental positivist. The vulgar deist's defect is a lack of adequate patience. He does not see that the detection of Nature's design (if it can be detected) cannot expect to be facilitated by the positivistic methods of the sciences and of workaday experience. The primary aim of these methods is to circumscribe the relevant analogies, to sharpen them until they become more and more pointed. Experimental deism has to choose a different method. It has to be impressionistic-totalitarian. Such a method is legiti- mate for an experimental philosopher, but it is a different method from the method of simple positivism. Consequently the experimental deist's hypothesis, when compared with an experimental positivistic hypothesis, must seem to be, and superficially at least must really be, very vague and very general-" a plain philosophical assent " to God's reality and to what may seem the tepid conclusion that the divine attributes, whatever they may be, are mind-like and (prob- ably) rather more mind-like than vegetation-like or matter- like. If the above, or something very like it, is the central part of Hume's argument in the Dialogues, it should be allowed, I think, that an attempt to indicate some of the principal ways in which these contentions are likely to have persistent importance in theology is a suitable introduction to a part at least of the large question we are discussing this evening. I now propose to make the attempt. (1) The problem of the limits of positivism in theological or other enquiries commonly called metaphysical is still very much with us, and can hardly be negligible unless all that we are accustomed to call " philosophy " is a dream or a superstition.</page><page sequence="36">214 J. LAIRD. The particular form in which this problem presented itself to Hume has certain special features. Philo and Cleanthes were both of them sensory phenomenalists, but they both accepted a very important extension to mere sense evidence. The extension was that sense-born and sense- borne beliefs that had the force of sensation were to count as perfectly good " realities," and in particular that a certain kind of association, viz., the causal, had such force. (I shall not here enquire what this " force " precisely was. It was not mere intensity; but Hume's Treatise and his first Enquiry, not his Dialogues, supply his answer to that very pertinent question.) The problem itself, however, is much more general. It is raised by anyone who asserts that terms like " the world," " the universe," " the omnitudo realitatis," describe nothing positive or verifiable-whether the "verification " is " strong " and in terms of actual private sensa, or much " weaker " but still generated by private sensa, or confined to protocol-propositions in " physical " language which are supposed or stipulated to be authenticated by actual sense- experience. It would also be raised by every Kantian who maintained that causal laws describe the necessitation of one sense datum by another sense datum. For all such philo- sophers would say that the " world " or the " universe " or the omnitudo realitatis was not "something " but, instead, a name for " any so and so." One of the things that seem to me to be of quite peculiar interest in these Dialogues is the way in which Hume dealt with this question. He did not attempt to settle it in advance but argued it pro and con within the ambit of his "experimental " philosophy. In the end he allowed that positivism need not (and probably should not) have the last word ; but he insisted upon the importance of the distinction between positivistic and non-positivistic sensitive belief. (2) It is sometimes said that one of the plainest (as well as one of the most provocative) things that Hume says in the Dialogues is that vulgar naturalism is just as sound a philo- sophy as either vulgar or sophisticated deism. I have called attention to this question, unobtrusively, in my pemmi-</page><page sequence="37">RELEVANCE OF HUME S DIALOGUES. 215 canized dialogue, by making a longer quotation from Hume's text at this point than at any other. I do not think that Hume asserts " naturalism." In the context, Cleanthes smiles indulgently at Philo's naturalistic " whimsies." Philo protests that he is serious and not merely extravagant. There is a genuine, if slight, basis in Nature (he says) for Eastern (or vegetative) accounts of world-origins and also for Epicurean (or Democritean- atomistic-materialistic) accounts of them. The conclusion of the matter, however, seems plainly to be that the Westerns are right in holding that if Nature be the great mother of the world she must be an intelligent dame. Hume's dish, it is true, is seasoned with agnosticism. Reason, mind, vegetation and other alleged primary principles are said to be secret causes whose effects are visible although their essence is unknown (and probably unknow- able). Such statements indicate a hankering after the flesh-pots of rationalism; but they are characteristic of Hume in all his books. Therefore we cannot say, as we might like to say, that the point for a good Humian is immaterial and even meaningless, since, for a good pheno- menalist, there should be nothing behind what things really look like, no " secret" causes behind manifest causal sequences. As firm sensations are, so they appear ; as firm causal expectations are, so they appear. They show forth all that they are. These illicit rationalistic cravings must therefore be admitted to be syndromes of Hume's general condition. Nevertheless a commentator should also point out that Hume in the end seems to admit ex ore Philonis that Design is a better analogue than Vegetation or than Atomism, even granting that mind, in our experience, is dependent upon matter and not the other way round. (3) Hume's argument in the Dialogues, as might have been expected from the climate of opinion in his time and country, was chiefly concerned with the Argument from Design (or, more strictly, with the Argument to a Designer), and Cleanthes's deism is always so interpreted. In this form, deism has certain obvious weaknesses, although these may have been less apparent to the eighteenth</page><page sequence="38">216 J. LAIRD. century and to Britain than they are to us, even in Britain, to-day. The assumption of deism in this form is that there could not be an intelligible pattern of order in the world unless the order had been put there--a proposition that scarcely seems likely to convince an unprejudiced reasoner. Here Philo's reasoning is, as he protests, not simply Pyrrhonian but essentially serious. Ex hypothesi, he says in effect, the argument is that order requires an orderly ordering cause. There is therefore an infinite regress, or else an arbitrary stoppage. Why stop with mind ? Why not stop before mind ? It seems likely that a wary deist would nowadays amend the argument and try to establish the inevitable presence and the inevitable power of an intelligible pattern, akin to intelligence, in the universe without also maintaining that some intelligent being must have put the pattern there. This might lead to -ro' iovy rather than to o Oeo' ; but the gain might be greater than the loss. That is not what happens in these Dialogues. Cleanthes has little interest in the dialectical aspects of his position. The massive impression on which he relies is an impression of Design. It is not dialectics but experience that tells him to stop there and prevents him from stopping anywhere else. The inference that God, on this hypothesis, would really be finite " strikes him with no horror " (209). He has found "a sufficient principle for religion" (ibid.). Philo maintains that the analogy of a Designer is only " remote," but still, in his aloof way, professes, on the whole, to be in agreement. (4) It may be thought that experimental deism is inherently a weaker theory than a warmer experimental theism, and so that Philo's repudiation of all that affects human action or forbearance is really his way of professing agnosticism. If the analogy to mind is taken seriously, it may be said, what would be the point of producing an orderly world unless goodness or love or some other such property were a part of the divine wisdom ? The God of deism would show forth his cleverness and nothing more.</page><page sequence="39">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 217 Cleverness per se, even in mankind, is a feeble and even a despicable property. It is mere skill, exerted for no solid purpose. That may be a fair criticism of deism, but it would be unhistorical, I think, to hold that the restriction of theism to mere deism is just a polite and ironical way of dismissing natural theology. Even to-day we should not say so to those who believe in a God who is only a supremely com- petent mathematician. It is still less reasonable to say so of eighteenth-century deism. What Hume and his contemporaries had principally in mind was an essentially cosmological theology. Is there anything unreasonable in attempting, very sedulously, to purge cosmology and cosmogony of anthropomorphic implications ? In Christian theology has there not always been a violent paradox in the doctrine of a cosmic Christ, and in the Incarnation so interpreted ? In so far as modern theologians think of " God " as a nation, or Church, or spiritual community, or as an abiding influence of sacra- mental culture, are they not, in effect, thinking acosmologically, and asserting only the presence and influence of a spiritual enclave within the cosmos ? I suppose some modern theologians would say that the experimental (or experiential) argument for theism is not what Hume implied that it was, but is an affair of" religious experience " in a sense that is nowhere nearly exhausted by the orderly pattern of natural laws to which Hume restricted his serious argument. The cosmologically minded among such theologians might discern the centre and finer essence of this religious experience in a sentiment or emotion or instinct of devout reverence for Nature and her ways. Some of the others would discern the presence of a helpful and loving Friend, and might call him a Cosmic Friend. Neither Philo nor Cleanthes make any such discovery in their experience. They may have been blind, but theology on this matter (to say the least) still speaks with a divided voice.</page><page sequence="40">III.-By T. E. JESSOP. THAT philosophical theology has allowed the argument from design to slip into the background is sometimes attributed to the force of Hume's criticism of it in the Dialogues. This I cannot believe. If we were obliged to make any one thinker responsible for the neglect, that thinker would have to be Kant, who has probably been more studied, and certainly more respected, than Hume by the theologians of the last fifty years or so, and who put something positive in the place of what he rejected. But the shift of theological interest concerning the proofs of the existence of God is not to be referred to any single man. In this country, at least, philosophical theologians began to shelve the argument from design in its simple traditional form, when, on the one hand, the impressive development of natural science in the second half of last century antiquated its mode of statement, and when, on the other hand, the influx of idealism from Germany in the same period changed the intellectual climate. Biology and the newer physics have complicated considerably our mode of laying out the cosmological facts, and Kant and Hegel and their various disciples have exercised a more general influence by revealing new tasks and ways of thinking. We now have before us a wider range of philosophical possibilities and probabilities than Hume had. This gives us in the rough an answer to the question of the symposium : Hume's Dialogues, having the eighteenth century written all over them, are not livingly relevant to an age that has been taught by science and philosophy alike to view the theological problem more vastly and to think about it in ways that Hume did not foresee. I shall be expected, before amplifying this answer, to say how I interpret Hume's ambiguous work. I can do so best by discounting its dialogue-form. This form is justified when, liveliness apart, the pros and cons of an issue are to be set over against each other in full force. Hume, however,</page><page sequence="41">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 219 has weighted the cons with obvious onesidedness. Cleanthes is a puppet, a hybrid, half-Hume-not a thinker of the day, but an embodiment of orthodox religious feeling made to argue on Humean principles. The agreement of Cleanthes and Philo on data, methods and criteria is too close. The resultant unreality of the former shows itself in the disparity between his being portrayed with real respect as a man of brains and learning, and his being manoeuvred into embar- rassment with a facility which such a man would have resisted. There is a similar disparity in the characterization of Demea : although he is clearly intended as the pious simpleton of the piece, an Aunt Sally set up to be shied at, he betrays at times an intelligent familiarity with the abstruser parts of philosophy. Finally, Philo, too, is an amalgam : after destroying the dialogue with long speeches, he exhibits at the end a sudden and unexplained change of front. Whatever subtlety of argument there may be in the Dialogues, I can find little subtlety of artistry in it. After keeping the manuscript by him for more than twenty years, and, as Professor Kemp Smith has shown, revising it at least twice, Hume could do no better because, with all his fertility of imagination, he lacked that versatility of sym- pathy, that spontaneous capacity for getting inside the skins of others, which is the source of dramatic plausibility. His dialogue, in short, is without dialectic, without the clash of well-weighted opposites that lifts an argument to a higher plane. It is Philo's abrupt and unargued admission, at the close of the Dialogues, of much that he has been all along rejecting that has been felt to be the primary problem for the expositor. Since, however, that problem is whether or no Philo's concluding remarks represent a sincere confession of Hume's, or merely a piece of dissimulation ironic or prudent, the interest involved is biographical. The only way in which, so far as I can see, it can be brought within the sphere of Hume's philosophy is to urge that in the conclusion he is but re-affirming as an inwardly determined and inexpug- nable conviction-as, to use the language of the Treatise, a " natural belief "-what has been pretentiously paraded</page><page sequence="42">220 T. E. JESSOP. as an achievement of reasoned inference; but it seems to me that both the Treatise and the first Enquiry are unsym- pathetic to the extension of " natural belief" to matters of religion. The conclusion being disconnected from the argued content of the Dialogues, I shall ignore it. The argument, stated broadly, is as follows. The existence of God is initially taken for granted, on the ground that " God " is the name for the cause of the universe, whatever character the cause may eventually be found to have. This non-religious use, with which the argument ends as well as begins, of an essentially religious term, shows how little the empiricist Hume had religion in the empirical sense in mind. The real problem turns out to be whether from the known nature of the universe anything can be inferred about its cause. Cleanthes argues that in virtue of its order the universe resembles--differing only in being on a grander scale-the contrivances of human skill, and may, therefore, be regarded by analogy as also the product of a designing mind. Philo, after observing that, unlike the matter of scientific causal investigations, the effect is singular and the alleged cause unexperienceable, attacks the analogy. Intelligence, he insists, is only one of several known causes or order, and is too small a part of the world to be elevated as the principle of the whole. Moreover, the similarity between nature and artefacts is very slight, barely warranting the supposition of a remote similarity in their causes, so remote that we may attribute intelligence to the cosmic cause in nothing more than a Pickwickian sense ; and even so, we have no analogical warrant for supposing this cause to be infinite, perfect, or even unitary. As for the ascription of moral characteristics, the blatant fact of evil definitively precludes any inference to justice or benevolence in the cause or causes: " it is an absurdity to believe that the deity has human passions " (p. 280, Kemp Smith's edition). At most we may conjecture, if we must conjecture at all, a plurality of factors possessing something very vaguely like our intelligence, although in this speculative sphere any hypothesis is but little better than any other. To Cleanthes' objection that so agnostic a conclusion takes away all the</page><page sequence="43">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 221 powerful religious motives to good living, Philo retorts with an account of the disastrous effects of religion (implicitly identified with the narrowest Calvinism) on morals-it supplies lofty excuses for self-deceit and intolerance, appeals chiefly to our fears, and depresses us with the prospect of a hereafter determined in its quality by an arbitrary and therefore immoral election. The reduction of the cause or causes of the universe to a formal concept, to which in our non-sceptical moods a faint analogy with intelligence may be added, is, according to Philo, the only ground of a pure religion, for, being an object of mere cognition, it can have no practical bearing on human life, except to purge it of speculation, dogmatism, and devotion. As a high precedent for this conclusion, he quotes the words, and travesties the sense, of Seneca, " To know God is to worship Him " (p. 280), although on his own showing there is scarcely anything to know and nothing at all to worship (cp. pp. 216, 235). What makes the argumentation, of Cleanthes equally with that of Philo, unstimulating from our present point of view is the drastic limitation of its reference and method. In respect of reference, Hume sets forth the data of the problem with neither precision nor fullness. He brings before us an effect, the universe, and invites us to consider the question of its cause ; yet the effect, the raison d'etre of the discussion, is characterized in the vaguest possible manner. The term " universe " or " order of the universe " as he uses it is too misty to stand as the starting-point of anything except the process of clarifying it. The order of the universe is not a simple order, so that if any general problem about it is to be decently set, its various strands need to be analyzed and defined. The nearest Hume comes to this is a mention of what he calls the orders of reason, instinct, generation and vegetation (pp. 219 f.), but they are left in their popular, unanalyzed senses. A popular cosmological picture is not enough to set going, or at any rate to keep going, a discussion that pretends to be philo- sophical. Whether or no Hume was justified, by the example of those whom he felt to be his living opponents,</page><page sequence="44">222 T. E. JESSOP. in allowing the problem to be left so vague, is irrelevant to our symposium ; what is relevant is that in our day the problem would not be regarded as a treatable problem until it had been set in much more definite terms. With our present wealth of scientific knowledge, to achieve this is itself a prior problem. For their recognition of it we are indebted-whatever we may think of their several solutions -in this country to such men as Bosanquet, Lloyd Morgan, Alexander, Russell and Whitehead. The limitation of method in the argumentation of the Dialogues is equally striking. Hume makes both his chief characters assume that there can be no a priori inference to a reality; and also-another indication that Cleanthes is pro tanto Humean-that the only possible a posteriori inference to a reality is through the causal relation. In short, it is ruled from the start that at best there could be but a single argument to God-from the universe regarded as an effect. The first of these assumptions is probably still widely held, but it is high time to challenge it yet again. Hume's conception of the a priori is very imperfect, and when it is corrected the question of an a priori proof of God, or rather of a proof in which a priori elements play an important part, appears in a different aspect. By a priori inference Hume meant eliciting the logical relations of ideas. Underlying his denial that such inference has any bearing on reality is his contention that all ideas are of the same sort, namely, copies of impressions. This view of the relation of ideas to impressions is obviously much too simple. Some of our ideas operate not as copies of impressions, or even as surro- gates of any sort (e.g., as symbolic equivalents), but as formative and regulative functions of the thinking process, providing indispensable systems of meaning or reference both for other ideas and for all impressions, and entering intimately into the apprehended content of these. In epistemological terms, this means that even the most empirically-laden thinking owes its thinking character to the presence in it of something more than impressions and their copies ; in metaphysical terms, it means that reality is characterized as much by the demands or impositions of</page><page sequence="45">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 223 thought as by the contingent intimations of sense. Now if this be granted, Hume's distinction of relations of impres- sions and relations of ideas is not an adequate ground for distinguishing thinking that has a bearing on reality and thinking that has not. Of course, we cannot infer from a category a particular existent corresponding to it, no more than we can infer an existent sovereign from the idea of one-though for different reasons, in the former case because the inference would be impossible (a categorical content not being realizable as a particular existent), whereas in the latter case the inference would be possible but unjustified, as lacking empirical evidence where such evidence is demanded. But what we can infer from a categorical idea is that reality has a certain structure or character, unless we accept a Kantian doctrine of the categories, which most idealists and all realists reject. If, then, Hume's principle that there can be no inference from ideas to reality be thus corrected, it becomes conceivable that a partly a priori proof of God may be worked out, or at least worked towards. It would probably be too daring to claim that the idea of God is itself a category, but it is possible that the general structure of the universe as defined by the categories-of which we still lack a satisfactory systematization, or even list-may supply an a priori basis more favourable to a theological metaphysic than to any other kind. The second assumption ties down any possible inference to God to the one Ariadne-thread of causality. God being an alleged fact, and causality being the only relation that enables us to pass inferentially from fact to fact, it follows that His existence can only be established, if at all, by showing that it is required to account for the causation of given fact. This view bristles with difficulties. In particular, it is very much open to question whether "fact " (or " existent ") is the right category for God: avoiding " value," which is almost as inadequate, I would prefer to say that He is an alleged real. Further, Hume's notion of causal inference as the passing from one impression to another (or to its corresponding idea) under the compulsion</page><page sequence="46">224 T. E. JESSOP. of a custom-bred expectation, makes nonsense of the very supposition of a non-given or a unique cause. All that I want to urge, however, is that that notion, however inter- preted (and Hume often, if only implicitly, gives it a fuller meaning), is too narrow to stand as the only bridge from anywhere to reality. Hume thought incorrigibly in terms of this one category of causality-an indication of his resolve to keep to the plane of natural science. In his recently discovered abstract of the Treatise, he devotes more space to causality than to any other subject ; and in the Treatise itself he reveals his obsession by explaining the idea of causality through reference to a causal psychological mechanism metaphysically conceived at the stage when the meaning and justification of the idea itself are being expli- citly questioned. It may be added that, apart from occa- sional confusion, he means by causality nothing but efficient causality, although Aristotle was still available to suggest that " cause" might be an omnibus name. I am not blaming Hume for this narrowness, but simply pointing to the narrowness as a reason why his Dialogues have ceased to be helpful, even by way of provocation, on the issue with which they deal. Even the natural sciences have found thinking in terms of causality to be only one of a number of ways of reaching from fact to what reason demands for the completion of fact, and philosophy can submit even less to Hume's imposition of a single way. Neither the order of discovery nor the order of proof follows always this one way. Surely one of the most interesting and philosophically challenging points which the thought of the last hundred years has brought to light is the great versatility of the reasoning process. The resourcefulness of the procedure of recent research in all fields is as striking as its formulated results. It is this aspect of the discoveries first-hand investi- gation is making that has thrown such reflective disciplines as logic, theory of method, and epistemology into the melting-pot. The limitation of reference and method in the Dialogues comes out most starkly in the treatment of man. He comes into the universe of Cleanthes and Philo in three</page><page sequence="47">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 225 ways only-as an animal, as an artificer, and as a subject of pain. It is by omitting some of man's most distinctive features from the facts which on the one hand are set for explanation, and on the other hand are to provide the material for the explanation, that the discussion is kept on an easy plane. Man being regarded as just another class of things and his activities as just another set of events, he raises no special problem ; as with other things and events, we need only ask after his cause. Now a thing or event merely has causes; it does not know them. That man knows is a striking prima facie difference which has to be noted, whatever we are eventually to make of it.* Hume does not note it. Nevertheless, it is a presupposition of the Dialogues. The discussion has no point if it is supposed that Cleanthes and Philo are just things undergoing changes, " little agitations of the brain," as Philo says, in an unguarded moment (p. 183). It is assumed that what they think of the world is knowledge of the world. Hume does not treat their agreement about the cosmological facts as a qualitative similarity of two sets of mental events, but as a statement of truth, and in so doing he is implicitly crediting human nature with an astonishing capacity which he does not put into his account of human nature. To put the point more directly, Hume omits from his picture of the world his own ability, as a man in it, to draw that picture and to declare what can and what cannot be reasonably inferred from it. That omission is the very one that no philosopher can be allowed to make. It is forbidden by the grammar of philosophizing. For-to make a venturesome pronounce- ment-one specific principle of metaphysical method is that a philosopher's description of the facts to be accounted for must include his own philosophizing ; and one specific * His knowing is, of course, bound up with other modes of experiencing which also deserve to be noted, and which have been regarded as more relevant than knowing to the theological issue. Cp. Martineau, following Butler and Kant: " The character of God . . . we learn not from the tides, the strata or the stars, but from the intimations of conscience, and the distribution of authority in the hierarchy of our impulses." Essays, Reviews and Addresses, vol. 8, p. 180. P</page><page sequence="48">226 T. E. JESSOP. principle of metaphysical evidence is that his theoretical completion or explanation of the facts must be consistent with the claim of his own philosophizing to be true. The later principle, after all, is only a particular, though a particularly searching, application of the law of non- contradiction. In other words, the philosopher is precluded by the comprehensiveness of his problem from treating himself as a spectator, falling outside the universe : the All can only be known from within, so that the knowing as well as the knowableness is an integral part of it. The spectator-attitude is, indeed, the device with which we sustain science, but it is the vice with which we ruin philo- sophy. Hume never escaped from it. The Treatise, as usually interpreted, is incoherent because the account he there gives of the cognitive limitations of human nature could only be true if Hume himself were free from them- and then it would not be an account of Humean nature. In the Dialogues also he keeps out of his universe-and not by simple omission, but by excluding in principle-his own assumed ability to talk rightly about it. This ability is one of the most remarkable things in it. By leaving it out, Hume clipped his own wings: he was perfectly right in inferring that a world with nothing so remarkable on its surface is not likely to have anything so remarkable in its depths. Throughout, however, he was pre-supposing that ability in himself. The deepest of all metaphysical contra- dictions is to imply both that we know anything at all about the world and that our knowing falls outside of it, and is therefore in no way significant of its nature. The exposure of this contradiction is what I take to be the primary insight, and the permanent contribution to philosophy, of idealism. The demand for its removal is one of the a priori demands I spoke of earlier. What its removal would bring us to positively will doubtless long remain a matter of controversy. Still, it is a gain to have the general metaphysical problem clearly set. This problem, stated in accordance with the idealist demand, is how to conceive the universe in a way that makes the ability of a " small part " of it to know a considerable part of it cease to appear</page><page sequence="49">RELEVANCE OF HUME'S DIALOGUES. 227 anomalous. The universe is that order of orders in which knowing shall be seen not as a miracle, but comfortably related to the rest. Now it seems to me that the more we insist, as the Hume of the Dialogues does, on the priority of the kind of stuff and order revealed by the natural sciences, the more anomalous does the cosmological status of knowing beings become. This is a serious difficulty, and the only way in which, so far as I can see, we can get ready to resolve it in any detail is to give up the scientific pre-conception of a world with man's thinking as the only spiritual element in it. It is at this point I would say, and not in the assump- tion of design in the material order, that the question of analogy becomes critical ; for I doubt whether the material order can be cogently exhibited as a designed order unless we have reached by some other route a principle to which designing power can be reasonably attributed. One such route, I am suggested, is the study of the cosmological implication of the ability of one type of existent to be related, or to relate itself, to the rest in the peculiar mode of knowing. Whether, in our attempt to remove the loneliness of human thinking, to reach a view in which the truth about the world may be seen as a natural constituent of the world, we are right in postulating a cosmic spirit, is too difficult a question to enter into here. I am only concerned to defend such a step against a charge which Hume brings against it. One recurrent contention of the Dialogues is that any anthropomorphism in metaphysics is wrong-hence there can be no theology. The conclusion certainly follows from the premiss. In any argument to God in which this term retains the core of meaning it has had for the religious experience and theology of the West, some analogy with the human mind is present. To purge the notion of God wholly of anthropomorphism would be to destroy it. Through the long self-criticism which theology, no less than philosophy, has undergone, the analogy has, of course, been drastically refined ; but what Hume rules out is the possibility of even a critical anthropomorphism. He gives two reasons : firstly, that human intelligence is " so minute,</page><page sequence="50">228 T. E. JESSOP. so weak, so bounded a principle " that it cannot be taken as a clue to the vast and varied universe (p. 183) ; secondly, that so to take it would be "a palpable and egregious partiality " in our own favour (p. 220). The first reason is ingenuous, since it makes size, extent of distribution and degree of capacity the measure of cosmic significance. Of these three features, only the last deserves a word. It is true that human thinking is bounded, but even in Hume's day, if we are to accept what he himself assumes to be known, its boundaries were drawn generously, and since then they have been considerably extended. By dwelling on the limitations of knowing, Hume, along with Locke, has given us a tradition which makes it hard for us to realize that what makes knowing a problem is not its limitations, but its being knowing at all. This problem is sharpened not only by the advance as such of knowledge, but also by the content of our widened and more evidenced knowledge, by the fact that what we increasingly know makes us appear increasingly insignificant. The more we learn about the world and the mechanisms of the mind, the harder it becomes to see how such mechanisms in such a world can know anything whatever. We are busy disproving our title to prove or disprove anything. This is the paradox, the contradiction, which philosophy has to try to remove, and the supposition that the universe is not simply what our large positive knowledge shows it to be, but must have in it something to which the spiritual functioning of the human mind can be affiliated, is one attempt to remove it. To Hume's second reason-that all anthropomorphism rests on conceit-we may, therefore, reply that when, from the starting-point I have indicated, we make an analogical transition from the human spirit to a cosmic one, we do so (whether rightly or wrongly) under the impulsion not of conceit, but of a thoroughly theoretical difficulty. The only conceit is that our knowing is knowing, and if we abandon that we abandon all discussion. HARRISON AND SONS, LTD., PRINTERS, 44-47, ST. MARTIN'S LANE, LONDON, W.C.2.</page></plain_text>
