<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE STATE OF LETTERS ENGLISH LETTER London, February, 1946 Ifeel, writing to you out of a brown and grey winter, that I write from a dead country, in which the various kinds of the life of the intellect and the senses are more or less still and blanketed with dust. UNO is meeting, and khaki motorcars run about in London marked PERU, ECUADOR, or U.S.S.R. No one much cares. Elderly owls write letters to The Times deriding Picasso and Klee. Arch dons at Oxford decide in reviews that Edith Sitwell is our greatest poet. T. S. Eliot worries himself, or did, about the union of churches in India. Young poets make strange unions with old hacks of the Georgian era in neo-romantic miscellanies of an extraordinary callowness. The editor of The New Statesman tells us over the air that he would like to dine with Socrates in the next world. Lord Samuel tells us his choice would be Shakespeare. Books are merchandise, and a Fellow of All Souls in the Board of Trade tells publishers in a book-starved country they must raise their export figure to eight million pounds. The sharp control of paper prevents the founding of any new periodical. The owls hoot and the dust thickens. Underneath it, all the same, there are intellectual shiftings and turn ings and items of life. Bonamy Dobr?e, in his professorship at Leeds, worries about university reform, and interprets for us the university humanism of Ortega y Gasset. The first volume of his Oxford His tory of English Literature has appeared (though for that we have to thank the American scholarship of Douglas Bush). Scientists worry themselves about their social responsibility, and show a willingness to be less aloof and selfish in broadcasting for the public and writing for them. Intellectual tidyings up and new starts go on in various derelict or moribund areas of knowledge. A New Naturalist's Library assails our anthropomorphic sentimentality about nature with a very fine butterfly volume by an Oxford geneticist, which presupposes a new level of enquiry and knowledge in the common reader. Botan ists, through the Cambridge University Press, are bringing out a Biological Flora of Great Britain. In spite of owls, books on art have a new popularity; and art scholarship begins to replace our old lazy</page><page sequence="2">GEOFFREY GRIGSON 309 well-bred dilettantism. An exiled art historian is planning a monumental history of European art, which will be out, volume after volume, by 1962. There is a scheme for reforming the muddled administration and division of the national collections of art. A "popular" novelist has ceased to be editor of the Times Literary Supplement, and the B.B.C. plans a cultural wave-length which will begin transmission in May. Schubert was sung in German on the air last week by a Danish tenor; and wishing to reaffirm the decencies and accomplishment of German literature, translations of Rilke and H?lderlin abound; and one book at least by a German professor, written in Germany during the war, and brought over from the ruins of Central Europe, is now be ing translated. All these small things can be set against the recrudescence and at tempted perpetuation of all manner of old cultural modes and prej udices and enmities, whose full detail I won't bother you with. But there is much less I can relate about new books and new writers dis turbing that dust which has settled upon literature. Horizon continues, genuflecting towards Paris, catching up with the existentialists, lazily compounded as usual of the arts, the fashionable, and the well-bred; a fine-arty journal, giving no lead and having neither a direction nor a view which can be called a view of life. (It was content, by the way, to pay no attention at all to W. H. Auden's The Sea and the Mirror). The curious thing by which Horizon is distinguished from almost any periodical of its pretensions during the last forty years is this: its editor has not introduced a single new writer of consequence. He has fed only upon revealed talent. And I would not entirely blame war and its concealing or arresting effect. Fashionable and cultural safety is no magnet. Demobilisation, resettlement, and a plenitude of paper may suddenly or slowly reveal an energy or two moving to wards some point. But there are more plans, more gestures, than convincing indications or proofs. I doubt if there has ever been a time when English writing and reading had less intellectual leadership, upon the lower as well as the higher levels. Old journalistic interpreters of the second level?such men as Saintsbury or Sir Edmund Gosse or Arnold Bennett?have vanished (except for Desmond Macarthy), giving way to a tinier breed of C. S. Lewises and Harold Nicolsons And no one?not even T. S. Eliot?has developed into an intellectual master of accepted, unassailable authority. I could point to no book ?and to no one capable of writing such a book?during the last twenty</page><page sequence="3">310 THE STATE OF LETTERS years, behind which there is such "a quantity of felt life" as in Henry James's Partial Portraits, French Poets and Novelists, and his collected prefaces. There is no reason why I should say much of English writers whose names and work are as familiar to you as to us, Sean O'Casey, for instance, whose books of autobiography have been underesteemed over here; or Rex Warner the novelist, or Wyndham Lewis, whose return to England is a thing to be grateful for. But I would suggest eyeing two novelists, Alex Comfort and P. H. Newby. Comfort still has to write more than a few good pages, still has to write a convincing novel; but he is restless, energetic, courageous in exposition and defence of views still tentative and immature, a greedy eater and digester of life, novelist, poet (a temporary poet, I suspect), pamphleteer, doctor, zoologist. He shows no sign of infection by the commoner, viler diseases of the English writer. He is young; and so is P. H. Newby, who has just published A Journey to the Interior. Comfort has shown that he will, if he continues and develops, become master in his own books, not simply a slave of his own neurosis; Newby has written outside a discernible self, mastering the men and women in his story, giving them a plausible nature, and compelling them to act among themselves in obedience to that nature. His novel concerns an Englishman, spiritu ally and physically ill, sent to recuperate among the English employees of an oil company in a small sultanate between the desert interior and the Persian Gulf. A reader of Rex Warner's novel The Aerodrome may complain of a Puritan spareness of structure, a steel furniture construc tion which leaves out too much. Newby's book is a change and a re freshment. It is more carpentered and cabinet-made, richer by giving more of his people, and more of the scene in which they move; a book which is civilized and done with intelligence and style. It has form; and it is sui generis in regard to the present fashions of English novel writing. I hope it may be the first of an improving, maturing series of novels. It shows the indications. Yet on its individual, actual merit, A Journey to the Interior is the only recent English novel I, for one, could recommend to American readers. Nothing stirs or is exciting in new English poetry, so far as I know of. Writers such as George Barker and Stephen Spender go on be cause they have once begun. Barker can write an interminable amount of verse in this manner:</page><page sequence="4">GEOFFREY GRIGSON 311 0 dolphins of my delight I fed with crumbs Gambading through bright hoops of days, How much me now your acrobatics amaze Leaping my one-time ecstasies from Doldrums . . . ?illiteracy which raises no eye-brow, and is unmurmuringly accepted as publishable, praisable poetry. Spender eviscerates And there was many another name Dividing the sun's light like a prism With the rainbow colors of an "ism" . . . Again no critical eye-brow goes up. Such lapses are so frequent and sink to such a depth that one cannot explain them away as belonging to the downs, in the ups and downs of an individual history. They are signs, in esse, of an individual ill-health; in acceptance, of a public ill-health. The old disease of poetic illiteracy is epidemic just now. There are few poets who have made Auden's attempt to order their verse, to learn the writing of verse, few talents full enough and genuine enough not to break and vanish under the intricate concentrating dis cipline of formal experiment. Edith Sitwell's poetry I have mentioned. We are asked now to believe in two Miss Sitwells?a prose Sitwell who writes statements of an obvious crudity and banal provinciality of mind (all her prose has always been of that order, self-evidently), and a Sitwell of depth and grandeurs in verse. This composite animal would be a chimera, lion's head, goat's body, and serpent's tail, un likely to exist on the evidence either of commonsense or of the whole history of the world's literature. The poetic Sitwell alone is a self assembled chimera; because when the new grandeurs of this poetry are examined, it is found chock-full of golden, leonine grandiloquences: 1 was a great gold-sinewed King, I had a lion's mane Like the raging sun. . . . full of many tropes and lines which exemplify our modern art of sinking: So changed is she by Time's appalling night That even her bone can no more stand upright . . (to which the nearest earlier equivalents in our literature are in the plays of that at times much superior poet, Nat Lee?who went mad).</page><page sequence="5">312 THE STATE OF LETTERS The goat's long-haired body is the absolute absence of form, the absolute sprawl; the serpent's tail the lines elongating into nothing ness. Gerard Hopkins found it monstrous (his word, and I am speaking of the chimerical)?monstrous in Browning's Instans Tyrannus that the sky was written of as a shield protecting the just man from the tyrant?"The vault of heaven is a vault, hollow, concave towards us, convex upwards; it therefore could only defend man on earth against enemies above it, an angry Olympus, for instance." He held that Browning was "not really a poet, that he has all the gifts but the one needful and the pearls without the string; rather one should say raw nuggets and rough diamonds." His turning of concave into convex was a "frigidity," an "untruth to nature." It came of "frigid fancy with no imagination"; which does, precisely, describe the source of Miss Sitwell's gilded, formless, synthetic, nuggetty, stringless verse, of an order many times lower than that of Browning, and many times fuller of ludicrous, cold hollow untruths to nature. I doubt if alert American readers will be deceived by it, not having been subjected to that endless iteration of Miss Sitwell's greatness which we have had to endure in England throughout the war. With me, Miss Sitwell has long been an id?e fixe; but only because her poetry is a symptom of one of our diseases over here, only because a recognition of its nature strikes me as a test of critical sanity and sensibility. One must stick, in a changing world, to a few fixations. In IQ39, this particular goose appeared to be cooked and done with. Thanks to Wyndham Lewis, the gilded school of genteel and aristo cratic pretensions to 'modernity' in literature seemed dying and near dead. But a war, except to the exceptional, causes a standstill of di visions and discernment; so beneath that shelter many old and frost bitten root-stocks of literary pretension have managed to recover and to sprout once more. Hence our 1946 wilderness of weeds, which choke or hide for the time being any new and genuine and virtuous growth. Overgrowth of old weeds is perhaps a nearer metaphor than dust. We need desperately the weed-killer of new periodicals, new, even if negative and destructive clearances and leanness. A Blast, an Enemy are wanted in our choked, tired, moribund condition; a supersession of periodicals conducted with "advanced" conventionalism or leaden dull ness; and it seems, alas, that the mere mechanism of paper control and labour difficulties in the printing trade must, for some time still, con tinue this war's amnesty between nonsense and the critical, creative intelligence. Reconstruction of the world, of damaged cities, of in</page><page sequence="6">GEOFFREY GRIGSON 313 dustry, and of political life?that is everywhere; but no reconstruction of the literary conscience. I wish I hadn't to quote Dryden to you to finish this letter; I wish it could be 'Tis well an Old Age is cut And time to begin a New instead of Fools change in England and new Fools arise, For, though th' Immortal Species never dies, Yet ev'ry Year new Maggots make new Flies. But there it is: Literary D.D.T. for the Flies, that is our second need. Talent with honesty is our first, paper our third. Geoffrey Grigson</page></plain_text>
