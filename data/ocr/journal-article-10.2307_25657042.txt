<plain_text><page sequence="1">SECOND SESSION Friday, April 25, 1941, 10 o'clock a.m. The meeting was called to order at 10:05 o'clock a.m., Mr. Jesse S. Reeves, Vice-President of the Society, presiding. Chairman Reeves. Will the meeting please come to order? The Chair is required to obey the mandate of the Executive Council, which is to the effect that he should read these two resolutions: Principal papers and addresses may not exceed twenty minutes in delivery and informal papers or discussions may not exceed ten minutes for each speaker. The presiding officer is required to call for the next speaker at the expiration of the time allotted. The three papers this morning attack more or less a common problem. It is not the business of the Chairman to anticipate, but to plunge at once into the middle of tilings. Therefore, I shall ask Professor Frederick S. Dunn, of Yale University, to read the first paper on the program. THE INTERNATIONAL RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS By Frederick S. Dunn Professor of International Relations, Yale University Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: International law, we are told, is a law between states, and individuals have no rights and no personality thereunder. In my view, this particular legal fossil is highly misleading and in large degree false, and its continued hold on the minds of many people explains in part why international law is held in such ill repute by laymen today. Now this remnant of legal animism can be taken in two ways: either it is a factual description of the nature and scope of the body of rules of inter national law, or else it is a prescriptive statement setting forth what should be the proper pattern of a system of orderly relations between nations. In my opinion it is defective on both counts. Let us consider it first as a description of current reality. What it purports to say is that the rules of international law are primarily concerned with the relations of states as political units, and that these units are ir reducible atoms, beneath the surface of which international law does not seek to penetrate. In other words, international law is not directly concerned with the rights and interests of private individuals, and if they benefit by the operation of its rules, they do so, not as subjects, with legal personalities, but as "objects" of international law. The layman can be pardoned if 14</page><page sequence="2">15 this suggests to his mind the analogous situation of an "object" of char ity who is the beneficiary of a hand-out, but who has no legal claim to its continuance. Fortunately, this is not an accurate description of the real scope and operation of the rules of international law. From the beginning, those rules have been in fact much more concerned with fulfilling the needs and interests of men in society than with advancing the political fortunes of sovereign states. The very basis on which international law was erected was the universal moral order of the Christian Church, which in turn rested solidly on the concept of the worth and dignity of the individual. Later on, when utilitarian philosophies provided the theoretical foundation for the inter national legal structure, the values incorporated in the rules of international law were still centered upon the individual. In the nineteenth century, international law became the handmaiden of free enterprise and the guardian of the conditions which made possible the successful operation of capitalism on a world-wide basis. Thus, the rules governing matters of jurisdiction, which, as you know, make up a very large part of the body of rules of international law, served primarily to overcome the difficulties created for private trade and inter course by the fact that the legal authority of modern states was limited to their respective territories. Again, the whole body of the law of diplomatic protection of citizens abroad was essentially concerned with the advance ment of the rights and interests of private citizens as against governments. Even the laws of war were not designed to aid sovereign states in carrying on war against each other, but were primarily for the purpose of safeguard ing individuals against the excesses of state action. Likewise, the rules governing neutral rights and duties were in large part intended to enable the people in neutral countries to carry on economic and social contacts during a war with the least possible interference from belligerent states. If we turn to the written international law as contained in treaties and conventions, we find much the same story. Only a relatively small propor tion of the treaties entered into since the middle of the last century have dealt with the relations of states as political atoms. The great majority of them have been concerned with the rights and interests of private individuals and were designed to enable governments to serve those interests better. The subject-matter of these treaties has dealt in large part with the simple activities of the man on the street, his ability to travel about freely from country to country, to carry on trade across national boundaries with some degree of predictability, to be assured of satisfactory means of communication with any part of the world, to be protected in matters of public health and morals and a host of other things which are not at all concerned with the advancement of the political interests of states. It is not even true that individuals have been powerless to take steps to protect their interests under international law. The great majority of</page><page sequence="3">16 legal questions disposed of in diplomatic negotiations are raised in the first place by individuals and carried on in their behalf. Even the cases that go before international tribunals are, for the most part, in fact if not in form, initiated by individuals and carried on for their benefit. The fact that such cases are presented in the name of the state and the private claimant ap pears only in parenthesis is of little practical consequence. Everybody knows that the private citizen is the real party in interest and any monies recovered almost always go directly to him. The proposition that the state is the ultimate unit of international law has been truer perhaps in the procedural field than anywhere else, but even here there have been many developments which it is very difficult to reconcile with the concept of the unitary state. For example, it is a necessary deduc tion from this concept that states can have relations with each other only through a single channel. For if a state had two or more mouthpieces, there would be a danger that they might say different things at the same time, and hence the theoretical unity of the state would be destroyed. However, this unitary concept is frequently departed from in practice. Thus in the United States, practically every department of government is involved in some manner in the handling of questions of foreign affairs, and some of them maintain direct contact with the corresponding departments of other govern ments. A similar development had proceeded very far in Europe before the present war, and it was even possible to find examples of actual treaties being negotiated and carried out by departments other than foreign offices. This may seem like a mere matter of form, but in fact it is quite revealing as to the subject-matter of modern international relations. For only the foreign office and the war and navy departments are charged with the protection of the interests of the state as a political unit. The other departments of government are primarily concerned with the everyday affairs of men in society. Another revealing procedural development along this line is found in the inroads that have been made in recent years on the unanimity principle of voting in international conferences. In some international organizations, voting power is not based on the concept of the state as the irreducible unit, but upon the extent of the interest of the people in the various countries in the subject-matter dealt with by the organization. Other international in stitutions, such as the Universal Postal Union, are in fact collectivities not of sovereign states but of local administrative units. In an institution such as the International Labor Organization, where representation is given to different economic groups within each nation, the concept of the state as an irreducible atom ceases to have much meaning. We must conclude that, as a description of reality, the unitary concept of the state is notably inaccurate. At best it merely describes how inter national lawyers talk and not how governments behave. To give personality to the state rather than to the individual is perhaps</page><page sequence="4">17 a harmless bit of anthropomorphism in normal times, but in the present crisis there is great danger that it will be misunderstood. It suggests a cold indifference to the interests and welfare of the man on the street and is apt to arouse in him an equal indifference to the status of international law. For the official, it gravely overemphasizes the importance of the political rela tions of states at the expense of the activities of men as human beings. If this concept is unsatisfactory as a description of reality, does it serve any better as an ideal pattern of what a system of international law should be like? The answer again seems to be in the negative. It is generally agreed that the weakest part of international law has been the rules which have attempted to regulate the relations of states as political units. Such rules have never been effective by themselves in restraining the actions of states. As Dr. Gerhart Niemeyer has clearly shown in his recent provocative book, Law Without Force, international law as a law between sovereign states can work only if it rests firmly upon a system of values separate from those associated with the existence of the state as a political unit. Otherwise, the state becomes an end in itself and its main concern will inevitably be the protection and enhancement of its power position. Under these circum stances it is idle to suppose that the self-denying rules which states can some times be induced to accept when their security is not in danger will stand in the way of any action deemed necessary when the power position of the state is believed to be threatened. The times in which international law has achieved its greatest successes have been those in which it has been in obvious harmony with the system of values held by the most important classes in the leading nations of the world. In the early days, international law got a foothold because it incorporated the moral values of Christianity and these values were persuasive to the strongest elements in the community of nations. It likewise managed to survive in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries because it served directly the values held by the commercial and industrial classes, which had become the most powerful groups in the political life of the leading nations. International law is losing its effectiveness today, partly because at the moment there is no predominant system of values prevalent over a great part of the international community, and partly because it has been getting out of touch with the interests and activities of men in society. It will con tinue to lose effectiveness until it again takes on meaning in terms of the real interests and values of those who ultimately determine the political actions of nations. Now I am well aware that it is not possible to draw a sharp line between the interests of men in society and the interests of sovereign states as political units. In fact, the individual himself seldom draws this distinction. In times of crisis he is deeply concerned about the political fortunes of his state in its relations with other political units, and he will usually be quite willing to yield up his own interests?even his interest in life itself?in order that the</page><page sequence="5">18 power and security of his state may be preserved. But the fact remains that men in society do have interests which extend across national boundaries, and it is these interests which make up in large part the real content of inter national relations. International lawyers should take note of this fact and should not build their system around a concept that is not today, and never has been, a good description of the world of international events. The technological revolution has forced in all countries a reconsideration of the whole role of government in relation to the economic and social welfare of the people, and has brought about a very rapid extension of the functions and powers of government everywhere. The size and strength of this move ment clearly indicate that we have come to one of the major turning points of history. Yet it would be an egregious error to suppose that this neces sarily marks a permanent trend away from concern for individual rights and toward emphasis on the political interest of states. In the past few days we have heard many definitions of democracy. The essence of them all, it seems to me, is deference for the individual, respect for him as a human being. This includes the right to be consulted in regard to matters affecting his welfare, since consultation is one of the best ways of showing deference to him. So long as governmental powers are exercised on behalf of the individual and he has a voice in determining how they shall be exercised, we still can have democracy, no matter how many specific new functions the government exercises or even how strong the central authority may be. Hence it would be very unwise to conclude that the same extension of governmental powers, which is observable at present in all countries, both totalitarian and democratic, is an indication of the final triumph of the interests of the state over those of the individual. On the contrary, where the extension of functions is for the specific purpose of pro tecting the individual from the economic and social hazards associated with modern technology, it works in favor of democracy rather than against it. If international law is to survive the present crisis and regain its former influence, it must be in harmony with this major social development. For unless it has the active and willing support of the influential classes of the community, it is powerless to limit the actions of governments. This sup port cannot be obtained merely through moral exhortation. It will come only because of a widespread conviction that international law is a useful device to aid governments in fulfilling those functions which enable men to pursue their activities with mutual profit and security. Chairman Reeves. The plan for this morning's session is that at the conclusion of each of the three papers, there will be a period for questions to be propounded to the speaker by those who have been selected to lead the discussion. At the conclusion of the reading of the third paper, with ques tions, then discussion upon any of the three papers will be opened to the floor.</page><page sequence="6">19 Those who have been selected to lead the discussion, Mr. Freeman, Mr. Turlington, and Mr. Cowles, are now at liberty to ask Professor Dunn questions with reference to this paper. Mr. Alwyn V. Freeman. There is one aspect of the problem discussed by Professor Dunn which it would do well to consider for the purpose of clarification. Professor Dunn has been at great pains to show us how the rules of international law are primarily concerned with individuals, rather than with the composite units which we know as states. But while it may be admitted that international law can and indeed sometimes does confer rights directly upon individuals, this does not signify that general interna tional law in fact does so at the present time. Thus the so-called interna tional rights of individuals have a legal basis solely in so far as they relate to foreign nationals, to the subjects of a given foreign state. To say interna tional law protects the rights of individuals qud individuals is not only just half the story, but it is an erroneous statement of the law. For the link that gives individuals the benefit of international law is the link of nationality, and it is his foreign nationality that does this. Citizenship within a given state does not ipso facto confer rights on the citizen against that state under international law. On the contrary, the relationship involved is one of purely domestic concern. Since this is so, it follows that a state does not necessarily commit an international wrong by inflicting injury upon a heimatlos, nor upon a member of its own nationality. One may call the whole conception of the state a fiction, if you will, an abstract metaphysical concept, an unreality hypostatized into a convenient descriptive symbol; but the link of nationality that unites an individual to that fiction is itself no fiction. It is of the essence of international law as developed by state practice. And that practice is clear, that without the link of nationality, an individual is without the protection of general inter national law. The Permanent Court of International Justice again recognized this in the recent Panevezys-Saldutiskis Railway case. Talking about the right to insure, in the person of its nationals, respect for the rules of international law, the court declared that "This right (of a state) is necessarily limited to intervention on behalf of its own nationals, because, in the absence of a special agreement, it is the bond of nationality between the state and the individual which alone confers upon the state the right of diplomatic protection." In that case the Estonian nation made some attempt to discredit this rule of international law, and even to deny its existence, but after examining the precedents, the court arrived at the conclusion that these were cases in which the governments concerned had agreed to waive strict application of the rule. I frankly fail to see much useful purpose in affirming that international law is fundamentally concerned with individuals, that individuals are en dowed with certain fundamental, human rights, in the face of a well estab</page><page sequence="7">20 lished rule that international law does not, generally speaking, in the absence of treaty, confer rights upon individuals, but does regard them rather as the beneficiaries of rights reposing in their own state. I believe we will avoid numerous possibilities of error if we will recognize at the outset that there is a clear distinction between the so-called natural rights of individuals and the rights of aliens, the rights of the subjects of a foreign state. To fail to recognize this essential distinction will surely contribute to that confusion and unreality which Mr. Dunn has so zealously sought to avoid. Yet at times even the Foreign Offices of contending states have failed to do so. The result has not enriched diplomatic literature except along the road of error. For example, in the exchange of notes between Mexico and the United States (August-September 1938), relative to the ex propriation of American-owned agrarian properties, Mexico sought to answer the American demand for compensation by arguing in this manner: "Mexico has maintained that the so-called rights of man, among others the right to property, with its modalities, are not principles of international law, but that their validity is derived from municipal law." In support of this position, the note cited Oppenheim's celebrated treatise on International Law, which clearly sets it forth that such rights as those of health, liberty and property claimed for the individual, do not enjoy any guarantee at all in international law (5th ed., Vol. I, pp. 508-509). The defect in the Mexican position lay precisely in the fact that it confused the problem of the natural or funda mental rights of the individual with the rights of aliens. The central issue in these agrarian seizures involved the rights of aliens and not the rights of individuals in the abstract. It apparently escaped the attention of the Mexican Foreign Office that far from supporting its position, Oppenheim sets forth an altogether different principle concerning respect for the rights of foreigners in this matter, at another passage of his work. It, therefore, seems that it is of some practical importance that we clearly understand the distinction which international law erects between rights that are recognized and those that are not. This is not to say that the law of nations should not protect the rights of individuals qud individuals, but that merely as presently constituted, that law does not. On the con trary, never was there a more crying need for such recognition than now, but it seems better to admit these limitations upon international law and then to take steps to remedy the situation, rather than to deceive ourselves by theoretical interpretations about the position of the individual in interna tional law. Wouldn't you agree with that, Professor Dunn? Professor Dunn. I agree with which part? Mr. Freeman. This last portion. Professor Dunn. No, I don't. It is quite obvious that Mr. Freeman is discussing just the existing rules of international law as they appear in the textbooks and cases. I was not discussing that, however. I started out by admitting that that is the view which you will find in all textbooks. They</page><page sequence="8">21 all start with the statement that international law is a law between states and so on. I was merely trying to suggest that it is unfortunate when a rule of law gets too far away from reality. I am quite willing to admit that rules of law have two functions. One is a description of reality, and the other is a norm of conduct. I think that when an established principle in fact gets so far away from what we know, or could know if we would only look and see what goes on in the world, that principle might well be subject to serious criticism. I am not denying for a moment that this is the way lawyers talk and will continue to talk. Mr. Edgar Turlington. I shall not question the philosophical basis of Mr. Dunn's exposition, partly because I recall that he introduced me years ago to non-Euclidean geometry and the mathematical philosophy of Profes sor Cassius J. Keyser. Since then, I have not questioned any philosophical bases announced by Mr. Dunn. But I want to come down to two things that I know Mr. Dunn knows all about, on the practical side as well as on the theoretical side, and I want to ask him two questions which I am sure he can carry in his mind without my rising twice. In the first place, how would he apply in practice the recognition of the rights of individuals in connection with access to raw materials in foreign territory, a subject discussed in Mr. Dunn's book, Peaceful Change? Secondly, how would Mr. Dunn apply in practice or give practical ap plication to the recognition of individual rights with respect to treatment in a foreign territory, in accordance with the balance of international social convenience? Professor Dunn. I don't even pretend to be able to answer that last one. In regard to the raw material problem, of course that problem has come up precisely because of the conflict between the political interests of states in competition with each other and the interests of private individuals in carrying on peaceful commercial life in which they make use of raw ma terials. So long as you forget about the political interests of states in con flict with each other, the raw material problem is not serious. That is to say, it has always been possible for individuals to obtain raw materials under the existing legal and economic system, so long as one forgot, for the moment, about the power interests of states and their desire to obtain raw materials for other than economic uses. Mr. Turlington. Now the second. Professor Dunn. I think perhaps that is a good illustration of the fact that when we do regard international law as a device for enabling men to live together in an international society, it works quite well, but that when we shift from that ground and consider it as a method of aiding the fortunes of political units in their power conflicts, it ceases to have much effectiveness. I confess I have even forgotten what your second question was. Mr. Turlington. The practical means of giving effect to the right of an individual to be treated in foreign territory in accordance with the</page><page sequence="9">22 minimum standard of international law, to which I believe you refer in your discussion as a balance of international social convenience, or some such phrase. Professor Dunn. Are you talking now about the procedural aspect? Mr. Turlington. Yes, the procedural aspect. Professor Dunn. I confess that I have no proposal to make that indi viduals should be permitted to resort to suits against states indiscriminately. From a procedural standpoint, I think it would be very unfortunate if that were so. I am not advocating any great change in the existing procedures. I am not advocating, as Mr. Freeman seemed to think, the abolition of the sovereign state. I do not believe that that is practical or necessary or de sirable. I think that we can go on with our existing procedure without much change, provided the people who carry it on are willing to see these rules in their social context, instead of as disembodied entities, which they have to learn by reading textbooks. Chairman Reeves. Mr. Cowles, do you have a question to ask Mr. Dunn? Mr. Cowles. I have no question at this time, sir. Chairman Reeves. If not, we will then pass to the reading of the second paper on the program, entitled "Individuals Before International Tribunals." I will call upon Dr. Hambro, from Northwestern University.</page></plain_text>
