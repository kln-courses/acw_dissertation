<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Corporation, Its Members, and Moral Accountability Christopher Meyers Should corporations, as corporations, be held morally accountable for their actions? Or, more fundamentally, can corporations be held morally accountable? Are corporations the types of entities to which responsibility ascriptions can be assigned? Our intuitive reaction is that yes, they can and should be; the Hooker Chemical Company, as a unique, individual entity, can and should be held accountable for the poisoning of the Love Canal residential area. But we also have seemingly conflicting intuitions that individual decision-makers within the corporations should (also) be held accountable; that the manager or division chief who made the decision to dump the chemicals at the Love Canal site should (also) be held accountable. My task in this paper will be to show how both of those intuitions are philosophically justifiable. I will do this by first, briefly discussing the kinds of entities to which responsibility ascriptions can legitimately be applied; i.e. what it means to be a moral agent.1 Second, I will show how corporations qualify as moral agents. And third, I will explain how individual members, in addition to the corporation, can and should be held accountable for decisions. Moral Agency A simple definition is useful as a starting point: A moral agent is any entity that possesses the minimal preconditions necessary to judge it a holder of rights and obligations and subject to accountability. To hold an entity accountable for its actions is to acknowledge it as having a substantial status in the moral community. It is to recognize that the entity has a legitimate claim on others to respect it as a moral entity?that it can hold others as having moral duties towards it?and it is to recognize that other moral agents can make similar claims against it. 1 do not intend here, to make the (stronger) Kantian claim that the moral agent must be respected as an end-in-itself.2 Rather, the respect to which I am referring involves recognizing the entity as being a moral entity thereby requiring us to take moral considerations into account in our dealings with it. Copyright Christopher Meyers 33</page><page sequence="2">34 BuUne.?t&gt; S Pwfeh?onal Ethic? Journal The reflective nature of this definition is crucial for, as Peter French points out (6, pp. 208, 210), certain non-person entities (e.g., deceased persons, future generations, fetuses, etc.) can be the holders of legal or societal rights without others being able to make moral claims against them. But such entities are being accorded a legal or societal status, not a moral status. We as a society may proclaim, with altogether valid and good reasons, that such entities are deserving of our protection. But such entities, because they cannot satisfy the reflective nature of the definition, are not moral agents and hence are not subject to the kinds of moral protection accorded moral agents. It is important to make a distinction here between legal or social rights and moral or natural rights. It is becoming more and more popular to confer rights status on animals, fetuses and even such things as works of art. But many, myself included, see such a notion of rights to be misguided. While I will be one of the first to proclaim outrage at the misuse of an animal, it will be for reasons other than its moral rights being violated. Proclaiming such entities to have a (social/legal) rights status may be the most effective means of insuring their protection from abuse. But it is important that we recognize that such a rights status is qualitatively different from the status a moral agent holds. What, then, is necessary to satisfy both sides of the definition? French puts it nicely when he says that a moral agent must not only be a holder of rights and obligations, but must also be (capable of being) "an administrator of rights. (And) to administer a right one must be an agent; i.e. able to act in certain ways" (6, p. 210). His emphasis is to show that legal and moral personhood are distinct, if potentially compatible, notions and that moral personhood is dependent upon a metaphysical status, that of agency. That is, moral agency must be more than just a juristic classification, tor a legal status does not necessarily entail the moral notion of accountability. To be legitimately held accountable for an action one must have the metaphysical status of having intended the action; i.e. of being an agent. Intentionality Being an intentional agent obviously entails more than just having been the cause of an event, for otherwise we would hold rocks that 'cause1 destructive landslides and tornadoes that 'cause1 enormous amounts of devastation to both life and property morally accountable. Being the cause is, hence, a necessary though not a sufficient condition.3 In addition to being able to attribute the cause of a decision/event to an agent, for there to be a responsibility ascription we must also be able to assign intentionality to the agent. This is not to say that all decisions/events must be intentionally chosen by the agent because we do assign moral responsibility to decision/events that are the products of negligence.4 But, in a great oversimplification that should suffice for our purposes, for the agent to be assigned moral responsibility for a decision/event that agent must</page><page sequence="3">Moraf Account&amp;b?ity 35 have at least been capable of the kind of deliberation that is necessarily involved in intentional acts. Further, those negligent acts to which we assign moral responsibility are generally those in which we say the agent should have engaged in that deliberation and it was the failure to do so (combined with the consequences of the event) that we hold as being morally relevant. What level of intentionality, then, is necessary to ascribe moral responsibility? French makes an appeal to Donald Davidson's theory of action and argues, "To be the subject of a responsibility ascription of the second type . . . the subject must be at minimum, what I shall call a Davidsonian agent" (6, p. 211). But this is an, at best, confusing appeal. Davidson, in this article, is attempting to correlate specific actions to specific sources so we can determine whether person brought about event . His formulation for such a determination is, "a person is the agent of an event if and only if there is a description of what he did that makes true a sentence that says he did it intentionally" (3, p. 7). His inclusion of the notion of a redescription of the event is so we can assign agency in cases of, for example, mistaken identity. While this is interesting, it is not very helpful for our, and French's, purposes. What we are looking for is a kind of mental state that separates moral agents from other kinds of entities. The above formulation only tells us which events can be attributed to which causes. What we need is a much fuller account of what it means to intend something. As formulated by Davidson/French, we have not excluded higher, non-moral, animals, as for example when a large dog intentionally pushes aside a smaller one so as to get at the smaller on?'s dinner bowl. The kind of intentionality needed is what Daniel Dennett refers to as "reciprocity" (4, p. 178); i.e. second-order intentions. "Let us define a second-order Intentional system as one to which we ascribe not only simple beliefs, desires, and other Intentions, but beliefs, desires and other Intentions about beliefs, desires, and other Intentions" (4, p. 181, his emphasis). Any entity that has intentions, beliefs or desires about some other entity's intentions, beliefs, or desires, or, as in self-reflection, about its own intentions, beliefs or desires, would qualify as possessing second-order intentionality. This kind of intentionality is important in morality because in order to hold an individual accountable, we must be able to say that s/he (or it) must have first, been capable of taking other moral agents' concerns into account. It is precisely when such concerns are either not considered and should have been, or when such concerns are considered with malevolence, that we say the agent was morally suspect. If an entity is incapable of considering another's concerns, if it does not possess second-order intentionality, it is morally illegitimate to nonetheless hold it accountable for how its actions affect another's concerns. And second, after fulfilling the first condition, the entity must be able to reflect back on its intention and then determine whether to go ahead with the action. That is, after considering how my action will affect another, I must then be capable of considering whether my</page><page sequence="4">36 Bu?nd?? S Profesional Ethic? Journal original intention is really what I want. It is through this self-reflective process that the action truly becomes nvy action. Because of these two conditions, the minimally necessary, though not quite sufficient, criterion of moral agency is second-order intentionality. Moral Relationships The second necessary criterion of moral agency is that the entity must exist in a moral relationship with others. French's account of this is especially perceptive. Briefly summarized, any moral agent is in a moral relationship with another, and is thus accountable to him/her/it, when that agent's actions would affect another in a way that our descriptions of the event would include "moral notions" (6, p. 211). These relationships need not, though they may, arise out of contractual, or other formal types of relationships. Instead, they arise because the parties exist in the moral community such that when a given party acts in certain ways, others will be morally affected by that action. So, to be a moral agent, to be the holder of certain rights and to be held accountable for certain actions, one must: (1) have the metaphysical status of being capable of second-order intentionality; and (2) exist in a moral relationship with other moral agents. A necessary result of these two conditions is that the agent must be an individual, a single entity to whom moral ascriptions can be assigned. This final condition allows the possibility of assigning praise or guilt. There must be someone or something to whom we assign our admiration or approbation. The question now is, and this is the second concern of this paper, do corporations qualify as moral agents? Do they satisfy our criteria? Corporations as Moral Agents As I noted earlier, we do, by and large, have an intuitive feeling that corporations should be regarded as moral agents; i.e. that they should be held accountable for their actions. But what are these intuitions based upon? Part of it may be a yearning to affix blame when problems arise, part of it may be an unjustified anthropomorphism, and/or part of it may be a simple rationalization to justify social benefit arguments like the so-called 'deep pocket' argument.5 But a lot of this intuition is based upon a recognition that we do, in many respects, treat them as moral agents. That is, going back to my original definition of moral agency, we respect our moral obligations towards corporations. When we enter into a contract with a corporation, either an employment contract or a business contract, we hold ourselves as being morally obliged to respect the contract and thereby to respect the corporation qua party to the contract. Further, we recognize the corporation as having certain rights; e.g. the right to property ownership, the right to due process under the law, the right to freedom of expression, etc. And, if the reflective nature of my definition is valid, this respecting of the</page><page sequence="5">hAoial Accountability 37 corporation's status in the moral community must be accompanied by a reciprocal respect; i.e. the corporation must respect the rights or other moral agents or be held accountable for not doing so. However, the previous argument is purely a descriptive one. That is, we do, at least partially, respect a corporation's status in the moral community and so we expect the respect to be returned. But, should we respect the corporation as a moral agent? Does it, the corporation itself, exist as an individual, exist in a moral relationship with other moral agents, and is it capable of second-order intentionality? Or is the corporation simply an aggregate of the persons who make it up, persons to whom the responsibility ascriptions should be made? Individuality The arguments that both French and John Ladd (8) give regarding the formal nature of organizations do a convincing job of expanding on what French calls the "Reality Theory" (6, pp. 209-10), whereby the organizations are regarded as having a pre-legal existence; i.e., on French's expanded version, as having a sociological and metaphysical status that the law "recognizes ... for its own purposes" (6, p. 209). And, as formal organiza tions they satisfy the third condition of agency, that of being an individual; a single entity to whom praise or blame can be assigned. By 'formal organization' I mean, borrowing from Ladd: The general characteristics of all these organizations are that they are "planned units, deliberately structured for the purpose of attaining specific goals," and such that each formal organiza tion is a "continuous organization of official functions bound by rules." One of the distinctive features of formal organizations of the type we are interested in is that they are ordinarily hierarchical in structure; they not only have a "horizontal" division of labor but a "vertical" one as well?a "pyramid of authority." [Further] individual office-holders are in principle replaceable by other individuals without affecting the continuity qr identity of the organization. In this sense, it has sometimes been said that an organization is "immortal" (8, pp. 488-489). The nature and source of the 'specific goals', 'rules', or as Christopher Stone terms them, "formal constraints" (10, pp. 4, 5), need much clarification, which I will return to in a moment. But, given this type of formal structure, the corporation clearly has an individual identity. The law has increasingly held this position, starting with skirmishes involving the East India Company in 16126 and including such decisions at the 1938 Act of Congress subjecting corporations to legal guilt, liability, and punishment and the 1978 Supreme Court decision granting corporations rights of free speech.7</page><page sequence="6">38 Bu?nzu S Profesional Ethics Journal Moral Relationships It is also clear that corporations exist in moral relationships with other moral agents. They frequently engage in activities which will have powerful moral effects, both positive and negative, on other moral agents. Further, those effects will often not stem from any kind of contractual or other formal, relationship.^ The residents of the Love Canal area had no established formal relationship with Hooker Chemical, but they were morally affected in significant and negative ways by Hooker Chemical. Further, those residents could have, in turn, significantly affected Hooker Chemical; e.g. by abrogating some of its property rights by demanding compensation for their harms. Intentionality It is easy enough to recognize that many of the decisions that emerge from corporations are of the second-order type. When American Airlines lowers its transcontinental flight fare, it does so with due consideration of how it will affect the desires or intentions of competitors, consumers, regulators, etc. If American Airlines feels Eastern Airlines will become angered or indignant and threaten a price-war, it may or may not decide to back off from its decision. Either way, its intention to bring about certain kinds of actions will include beliefs about the beliefs, desires, and intentions of others. What is much more difficult is to ascribe those decisions to the corporation, as opposed to the members within the corporation. Again, both French (with his account of the Corporate Internal Decision Structure) and Ladd (with his appeal to a language-game understanding of the decision making process) provide perceptive and plausible accounts of why this kind of ascription makes sense. However, Ladd's account falls short in that it excludes moral considerations. On his account, certain constitutive-type rules or policies define the corporation and decisions which adhere to these rules are not personal decisions; instead they are corporate decisions. But by making a not at all clear and at the same time implausible appeal to the necessary condition that the goals be empirically verifiable, he rules out moral considerations as "relevant to the operations of a formal organiza tion" (8, p. 498). Given Wittgenstein's (to whom Ladd appeals) discussion of the social context and its importance on the make-up of particular language games, the exclusion of moral considerations is altogether illegitimate. French's account is similar to Ladd's in that he appeals to what he calls the "corporate decision recognition rules" (6, p. 212), which function in the same, constitutive way as Ladd's. However, he does not exclude moral considerations from the legitimate goals or policies of a corporation. He recognizes that much of a corporation's enterprise is morally significant and stresses not only the legitimacy, but also the importance of holding corporations morally responsible.</page><page sequence="7">Accountab?ity 39 Hence, by combining Ladd's and French's accounts we can acknowl edge the metaphysical and moral status of corporations. What we need to do is go beyond their accounts to show how both the corporation and principal members of the corporation can be held morally accountable for corporate actions. For, even in French's expanded version, the implication is that it is only the corporation that can be held accountable. The members within it, so long as their decisions adhere to the recognition rules, are not morally accountable for corporate actions. They, like the Nuremberg defendants, have the ultimate defense: "I was doing it for the 'company'." Personal Responsibility The first concern is determining both the nature and source of the goals or policies of the corporation to which the recognition rules must adhere. French's point that the goals of a corporation need not be the personal goals of its curie nt directors (6, p. 214) is an important, if too weak, one. What he needs to say is that the goals must not be the personal goals of the directors, for if they were, then the decisions would have the personal nature we have been trying to avoid. Incorporator Responsibility But, assuming they are not, assuming instead that the policies can be traced to the original incorporators, does that mean the policies are simply their personal goals? French's response is interesting, though again inadequate. He suggests, "even in infancy the melding of disparate interests and purposes gives rise to a corporate long range point of view that is distinct from the interests and purposes of the collection of incorporators viewed individually" (8, p. 214). Two comments are in order. First, his is an empirical claim about the formation of a corporation that surely does not hold in all cases. Often corporations evolve (generally for tax purposes) from previously established individually controlled companies. In these cases the policies have already been established by an individual or very small group of individuals and hence are much more personal in nature. The second point is that even in those cases where there was a true disparity of interests, the individual incorporators certainly agree on whatever compromise of those interests is established. And as parties to this agreement/contract, even if the terms aie not ideally what, individ ually, they would have desired, they are accountable for the actions that stem from that agreement. I want to emphasize that in both of the above cases the decisions could still be regarded as corporate decisions as well as implying personal responsibility. The kinds of policies established in a corporation's infancy are of a broad nature. They give direction to decision making, but it is through the specific implementation of them (i.e. their being filtered</page><page sequence="8">40 Bu?imb? 6 Vwfe?Uonal Ethics Journal through the CID Structure) that they become corporate intentions, so long, that is, as the original policy setter does not act in a veto position, in which case the decision would be his/her personal decision. Hence, we begin to see a breaking down o? the "either the corporation (is responsible) or the individuals (are responsible) dichotomy." The original incorporators and/or policy makers maintain responsibility for at least the general direction of corporate decision. Managerial Responsibility But what of those cases in which the policy makers are either deceased or no longer affiliated with the company and its actions? Can we assign personal responsibility in addition to the corporate responsibility? And to whom would it be assigned? I think we can and to see how, let us go back to Laddfs game analogy. Using this analogy we can think of a game in which there are some very strict, if general, constitutive rules for the proper playing of the game. As the players engage in the activity, they will attempt to implement these rules in specific ways so as to advantage themselves or their team. As both sides will be attempting to implement the rules so as to gain advantage,9 in order for the game to be well-played, there must be a final arbitrator or referee who judges whether the specific implementation of a rule adheres to the more general rules or policies that define the game. S/he judges whether a particular action is consistent with the original intention of the gamewright. Relating this to the CID Structure, the original incorporators act as the gamewrights. They establish strict, if most often general, policies/ constitutive rules for acceptable corporate behavior. Clearly, these cannot include many, if any, specific rules about specific behaviors,10 given the enormous range of behaviors and restrictions that would be applicable. As lower level employees go about their work, they will be trying to accomplish their either implicit or explicit job descriptions through specific implemen tations of the rules, which they interpret as adhering to corporate policies. But such implementations will often involve misinterpretations of true corporate policy and it is at this point that the arbitrator or referee steps in to make a judgment. In the CID Structure that arbitrator is the supervisor, manager, division chief, whomsoever has the final authority as to whether a particular decision, project, or design will be acted upon. This person is not only responsible to determine the feasibility of the decision, but is also responsible to determine whether the decision adheres to company policy, whether it is the type of decision the corporation would want to do. But that manager has another task as well, and it is at this point that personal responsibility again enters. In addition to determining whether the particular decision adheres to corporate policy, the manager/arbitrator has</page><page sequence="9">Mora? Accountab?ity 41 the responsibility to determine whether the corporate policies are morally sound. If s/he does not make this second determination and a corporate decision harms an innocent party, that manager/arbitrator (in addition to the corporation) is accountable for the harm. If s/he feels a decision that is consistent with corporate policy is nonetheless immoral, s/he has an obligation to at least express those concerns to a supervisor.11 A frequently cited example of corporate decision making, Kermit Vandivier's "Why Should My Conscience Bother Me?" (n), will help clarify this. In this account he describes a company's (B. F. Goodrich) strong desire to establish contracts with companies that manufactured aircraft for the Air Force. This general policy was implemented, in the case described, in a way that eventually involved considerable amounts of deception and fraud. As the project evolved, lower level engineers saw this deceit and fraud developing and voiced their concerns to their superiors. This process found its way to the individual who had final control over whether to proceed with the project, in this case the manager of the particular plant's technical services section. It was this manager's job to determine whether the project was consistent with company policy. He determined that it was and through this consistency, and through the nature of the decision making process, the project became a corporate project; one for which the corporation could be held accountable. But, it was also a personal decision. That manager, seeing the decision was consistent with company policy and potentially illegal and/or immoral, had an obligation to attempt to either alter company policy or alter the project. By not doing so he placed the values inherent in the game structure/corporation above those of the society in which the game exists; a decision for which that society can legitimately hold him morally accountable. Summary and Conclusion To briefly summarize, an entity has the status of being a moral agent if it is capable of second-order intentionality and if it exists in a responsibility relationship with other moral agents. A corporation acquires this status through a combination of its formal nature (its CID Structure) and its effect on/relationship with other moral agents. As such, the corporation can and should be held morally accountable for its actions. It is also by making an appeal to the corporation's formal nature and its analogy to languag?-games that managers, supervisors, division chiefs, etc., acting in the role of arbitrator/referee, acquire some measure of personal responsibility for corporate actions. An analysis of the delineation of that measure, of the degree to which the corporation as opposed to its members will be held accountable, must be reserved for another paper, though such an analysis will necessarily, in part, appeal to individual cases. Hopefully I have shown, by the above analysis, that both of our intuitions about moral accountability and corporations are justifiable. The</page><page sequence="10">42 BuUntbb S Vxofebbional Ethicb Journal Hooker Chemical Company should be held morally accountable for its poisoning of Love Canal, as well as should the manager who made the final decision to dump the chemicals. The next step in the discussion should involve trying to understand what it means to hold a corporation morally accountable. As I suggested in my first footnote, there is a distinction between moral agents and moral persons. We need now to determine the nature of that distinction. For example, what are the appropriate kinds of punishment for a corporation? Given the extremely complex nature of retributively punishing such an entity, should we only strive for restitution? If so, should we treat its decision making members in the same way? These questions provide ample evidence of the complexity of the notion of corporate responsibility as well as evidence that the work done in this paper only represents a mere beginning. NOTES It is of note that I distinguish here between moral agents and moral persons, a move Peter French, whose article, "The Corporation as a Moral Person" (6) provided the impetus for this paper, does not make. While corporations do not have the same moral status as persons, (e.g. they do not have the right to life, as the Bendix Corporation recently discovered), I hope to show that they are members of the moral community. The precise nature of their moral status is a discussion that is beyond the scope of this paper, but it at least includes moral accountability. See Daniel Dennett, "Conditions of Personhood" (4, pp. 177-78). This is likely one of the valid distinctions between moral persons and moral agents referred to in the preceding footnote. Whether the cause must be a first-cause?i.e. removed from deter ministic considerations?can be, for our purposes, a relatively mute question. While this may, again, be the kind of distinction that will hold between moral persons and moral agents, we can appeal to a type of compatibilist position for assigning responsibility ascriptions to entities like corporations. That is, given a sophisticated enough level of corporate intentionality, the original source of the cause will become unimportant. Also, for a related but different kind of approach to this question, see John Ladd (8, pp. 512-16). See Thomas Nagel, "Moral Luck" (9, pp. 26 ff.). And, George Graham, "Doing Something Intentionally and Moral Responsibility" (7).</page><page sequence="11">Moraf Accountability 43 5.

His Chapters 2, 3, and 4 give an informative account of the historical legacy of the law's relationship with corporations. 7. See Thomas Donaldson, (5, p. 19). 8. It might be argued (e.g. see Donaldson [5, Chapter 3] and Norman Bowie [2, pp. 27-31]) that a kind of social contract exists between business and society. But the most plausible accounts, of what I take to be a generally implausible notion, view such a contract as a means for justifying a preexisting relationship; that is, if we had established such a contract, what would we have wanted it to include? Such a contract obviously does not exist in fact and any appeal to one as an explanation of the relationship between a particular business and a particular member of society is wholly illegitimate. 9. One might argue that this competitive element causes the analogy to collapse at this point. But, there need not be competition for there to be discrepancies in specific implementations of general rules; competition merely brings these discrepancies to the forefront. Further, we should not disregard the often severely competitive interaction between various departments in the same company. 10.
