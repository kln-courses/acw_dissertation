ISBN 9 0041 0848 3. The publication of Irby-Massie's study of religious activity within the Roman army in Britain is timely, as a monograph-length study dedicated to this important theme is long overdue. Many scholars will welcome Military Religion in Roman Britain for its convenient catalogue of relevant epigraphic material. But I.M. seeks to offer the reader far more than that, presenting chapters on the 'Roman State Religion', Eastern religions, cults indigenous to the North-West provinces, 'Romanization and Politicisation of Religion', and 'Roman Religion in late and post-Roman Britain'. Accomplishing her ambitious agenda demands a soph- isticated methodology and a detailed knowledge of the sources. Unfortunately, I.M. does not convince the reader in either of these areas. Throughout the volume, the epigraphic record dominates. This bias is in many ways understandable: it reflects I.M.'s scholarly strengths and epigraphy has long informed our image of religious practice among Roman soldiers. Yet it is vital that the implications of such an emphasis are made explicit in a volume that argues that 'the interaction of Roman and native in Britain is central' to its theme (7). Whatever we deduce about cultural exchange from the reading of inscriptions, we are still left with the fact that the very erection of inscribed monuments is a culturally-charged act that had no place in indigenous tradition. The same applies to the evidence left us by anthropomorphic representations that have little or no native precursors in the areas where the Roman army was stationed. Yet the author does not explore the archaeological strat- egies that might enable her to reach beyond this impasse. She does not employ recent developments in the archaeology of cult and does not use the full range of material available. I.M. says nothing, for example, of the unusual instances of artefact deposition, such as that attested at Newstead and South Shields among others, which may be linked to ritual activity and the army. Further reflection on studies of religion and culture contact in the North-West provinces would have been helpful when discussing religious change. I.M. is probably correct to say that many worshippers usually made little distinction between Roman and non-Roman deities. She is also surely right to follow Jane Webster in her understanding of name dualling as something initiated by the incomer and to emphasise the importance of evocatio (158-9). Yet some of the terminology she adopts is unhelpful and confusing. Inter- pretatio Celtica, a recent creation, for example, suggests a particular process of translation that may have occurred, but, as this process can never be demonstrated, it is misleading to use the term as an explanatory device (for a useful critique see G. Woolf, Becoming Roman (1998), 232). Similarly, I.M. employs the term Romanization routinely but does not define it, a fact that presents difficulties given the diverse meanings associated with the word. Individuals are, for example, sometimes deemed 'fully Romanized' depending on their names. I.M.'s first four chapters explore different aspects of religion and the army. The chapter on state religion is a fair summary of the material, though interestingly I.M. opts not to follow Pekary's ('Das Opfer vor dem Kaiserbild', BJ 186 (1986), 81-103) now widely-accepted interpretation of the scene on the famous Dura Fresco as representing an offering to the Imperial cult without providing a justification. I.M.'s account of evidence for the eastern cults is similarly useful, though it is unlikely to convince many readers that these cults 'unified legionary and auxiliary units', as she argues (7). In the discussion of native cults that follows, I.M. makes two particularly interesting suggestions. The first - that some of the cults might be better understood as local hero cults - is certainly worth further exploration, though some reference to the work already undertaken by Colin Forcey and others on possible manifestations of the same phenomenon in the South would have been helpful. The second suggestion - that evidence for the cults may reflect social differentiation amongst worshippers - does indeed appear plausible in the case of Veteris. Ch. 5, which reflects on the 'Romanization and Politicization of Religion', contains a mixed range of sections, some of which have little to do with the army. Some of the observations that strike I.M., such as</page><page sequence="2">414 REVIEWS the frequency with which Mars and Mercury are paired with local deities (142, 164-6), need to be viewed in comparison with evidence from elsewhere in the North-Western provinces where the phenomenon is well attested. Such comparisons do not necessarily support I.M.'s view of the motives behind pairings with Mars, for example. An awkward element of the volume is the penultimate chapter on late and post-Roman Britain, which says little about the garrison's contribution to religious life. Excepting a reference to St Alban, for example, the section on Christianity in the army is almost entirely reliant on non-British evidence. I.M. argues that St Alban's story 'at the very least, attests Christianity in the Romano-British army by the third century' (197). It is therefore surprising that she does not mention or seek to refute the view held by several eminent scholars of Romano-British religion that the saint never existed as a Christian martyr but was rather a co-opted pagan deity. The author concludes her analysis with reflections on the evidence, some of which are problematic. Her claim that the cult of Isis was 'observed in Britain because the Severi favored' it (203), for example, strongly implies a much later beginning than the evidence suggests, while the idea that there was 'some mutual assimilation of cults in Britain as a deliberate policy of Romanizing the native Britons' (212) is increasingly hard to sustain. At the beginning of the volume, I.M. asks a series of interesting and worthwhile questions and promises to use a wide range of sources to tackle them, but ultimately this reader was left unsatisfied: despite some interesting ideas, I.M.'s work fails to deliver.
