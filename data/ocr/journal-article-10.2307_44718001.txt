The industry needs time to develop a product of sufficiently high-level quality to be put into general use, and the in- dustry must act quickly to solve this difficult and sensitive problem of occupant protection. Automobile manufacturers must therefore try to come to the most objective conclusion possi- ble, taking account of all aspects of the prob- lem: technical, technological, and economic. Present analyses still appear to be subjec- tive and impassioned. This study will try to formulate an objective synthesis of the knowledge available today in this area. I. TECHNICAL ASPECTS We have summarized here the results obtained from theoretical research, crash test results, statistical studies, and analyses of actual ac- ABSTRACT Current comparisons between active and pass- ive restraint systems are still subjective and emotional. Statistical data, accident surveys, theoretical studies, and crash test results allow a technical analysis. Taking into account tech- nological problems related to various devices and considering their economical incidence and their efficiency, it is possible to form an objective opinion. Conclusion is that the different prin- ciples of restraints are not opposed, but appear as successive steps of a same evolution. 1046</page><page sequence="2">cidents for different types of collisions. FRONTAL IMPACT - Given the statistical im- portance of this type of accident in all coun- tries, it is logical to begin the study with frontal impacts. Before assembling and comparing the results, it is important to analyze the be- havior of different restraint systems within the framework of the principal parameters bearing on the consequences for the occupant. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF COUPLING - 1. Influence of play - Play is defined by the possible displacement of the occupant inside the passenger compartment before the restraint forces are exerted on him. Depending on the re- straint system used, play can be divided into two categories: a) Geometric play - In this case, the play is real. It is encountered mainly during usage of all conventional seat belt systems: manually or automatically adjusting 3-point belts, as well as in the case of certain passive restraint systems: shoulder belt with knee-retention plate. This play has two principal causes. The first is re- lated to occupant comfort requirements and is preponderant in the case of a manually- adjusting belt system; the second is related to technological considerations, and is pre- ponderant in the case of belts that are automatically adjusted through retractors. b) Apparent play - (Related to activa- tion time of the restraint system) In this case, the play as defined above has no easi- ly measurable value. The preponderant para- meter is essentially the time required, starting from the beginning of impact, to achieving the restraint forces. This is characteristic of déployable devices or pre- tensioned devices. For different restraint systems, the values of the play or the activation time of the system used are, for an impact speed of 48 km/h (Figures 2,3): - 3-point automaticaaly adjusting belts 25-40 mm - automatically adjusting belts 25 mm - belts with pre-tensioning retractors 12-15 ms - inflatable belts 15-20 ms - air bags 40-60 ms (55 ms is the most frequent value) Figure 1 shows, starting from the re- lative occupant-compartment displacement at null play (belt play taken in or placement of system completed) , the ideal motion of occupant deceleration. An increase in play or activation time of the restraint system corresponds to an increase in the relative occupant-compart- ment displacements and a reduction of coup- ling: the fraction of the occupant's kine- tic energy absorbed by the restraint system occupant ' * acceleration occupant/vehicle displacement • ^ (Slack = 0) Fig. 1 - The ideal motion of occupant decelreation increases to the detriment of that absorbed by additional deformation of the vehicle structure (Figure 2a, b).

Use of pre-tensioning re- tractors allows increasing the limitation of force to 400 daN. Because of the presence of the energy-absorber, in the case of a 3- point belt, this effort is approximately 900 daN. 2. Influence of the initial apparent stiff- ness of the restraint system (restraint system + dummy) - The coupling also increases in relation to the apparent initial stiffness of the restraint system. This stiffness, shown at the occupant level by a deceleration by the time unit, corre- sponds, in Figures 3a, b, to the linking curve of the two linear parts of the speed-occupant curve. For the various restraint systems utilized, 1047</page><page sequence="3">1 048 P. VENTRE, ET AL. the following values are obtained at the thorax level of the dummy, and experimentally: - shoulder belt + knee restraint, manually-ad- justing belt : 1300 g/s - belt with two retractors : 900 g/s - belt with two pre-tensioning retractors : 4000 g/s (for a duration of approximately 7 ms) , then : 665 g/s - air bags : 350 g/s These values correspond to tests carried out on dummies. Because of the substantial stiffness of the thorax of anthropomorphic dummies with re- lation to the human thorax, these values are over- estimated, notably for tests where restraint was effected with seat belts. i i velocity velocity ' occupant occupant ' vehicle ' vehicle N. ř'me time (a) j Initial jerk (a) &gt; Initial jerk (b) (b) Fig. 3 - The stiffness; shown at the occupant level by a deceleration by the time unit, corresponds to the linking curve of the two linear parts of the speed-occupant curve INTRODUCTION OF THE COUPLING COEFFICIENT - Assuming that the occupant constitutes a single mass - the thorax - the decelerations of the different parts of the occupant are then grouped in a single deceleration measured at the level of the center of gravity of the thorax (Xp)- By definition, the coupling coefficient, C, is given by the formula: Jf a X max a (1) %AV2 o The term %AV is equivalent (to an approxi- mate constant) to the variation of occupant ener- gy when the occupant is subjected to the speed variation A V. rx maxv . The term J0 #p cbc^is . equivalent (to the same approximate constant) to the energy absorbed by the restraint system : is the relative displacement of the occupant in the compartment (therefore relative to the restraint system) and X max corresponds to the maximum displacement of the occupant relatively to the compartment. The maximum coupling corresponds to C =1. Under these conditions, the deceleration of the occupant is identical to the deceleration of the vehicle ( X v ) therefore X Xf(¥ p~ Xv)^- o* The energy absorbed by the restraint system is null in this case. The absence of coupling is characterized by C = 0. The vehicle undergoes the speed variation A V before the restraint system has begun to activate. Under these conditions, the variation of occupant energy undergoing the speed varia- tion A V will be integrally absorbed by the re- straint system. In practice, it is impossible for us to de- termine the direction of resultant Yp measured at the level of the occupant's thorax. It is there- fore assumed that this resultant has a direction parallel to that of the deceleration of the vehi- cle. The coupling coefficient will be, under these conditions, over-estimated. Nevertheless, this criterion can serve as a basis for compari- son of performances of several restraint systems. The values of the coupling coefficients ob- tained during sled impact tests using dummies re- strained by different protection devices were calculated. The reference value of 100 is assigned to the coupling coefficient obtained using seat belts with retractors without pre- tensioning device. With relation to this refer- ence value, the coupling coefficients obtained during the various tests are as follows : - seat belt with retractors, without pre-ten- sion : 100 - seat belt with retractors, 2 pre-tensioning devices : 204 - passive seat belt (shoulder belt plus knee restraint) : 114 - seat belt with retractors, 1 pre-tensioning device : 157 - air bag (without lap belt) : 95 What hypotheses to use in calculating optimization of the restraint system? HOFFERBERTH and TOMASSONI (4) have estab- lished for the NHTSA a mathematical model of the vehicle-occupant system in frontal impact in which they took into account the influence of the weight of the vehicle and the type of restraint used by the occupant. This study presents the air bag as offering the greatest theoretical possibilites of re- straint, but this is the result of the choice of very different data according to the system used, as shown in Table 1. In the mathematical model used, for the same speed variation AV, the three figures on the preceeding Table entirely determine the displace- ment necessary for the occupant, Gq and Gf0 being applied universally to the weight which repre- sents the occupant. The values of G0 and G1 are the maxima com- patible with human tolerances; t^ depends on the technology. It should be noted that by giving a fixed value to tļ, the consideration given to in- teraction with the vehicle is neglected. The three preceeding figures should be exa-</page><page sequence="4">AN OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS 1049 TABLE 1 Restraint Systems Beginning of Maximum Jerk activation of deceleration G'0 (g/s) restraint effort G (g) t± (s) -3 point belt 0.035 30 1500 -3 point belt plus pre- tension 0.015 30 1500 -air bag 0.035 60 1500 and 3000 -inflatable belt 0.025 50 1500 and 2000 mined carefully because a different choice of one among them suffices to totally change the hier- archy obtained for the restraint systems. We point out that, even with these different acceleration levels but with an identical jerk of 1500 g/s, the belt with pre-tension already gives the best theorectical limits because of its short- er activation time. Our criticism is based on two points: 1) The activation times are not realistic - In reality, these times are a function of the parameters acting on the restraint system, and it is appropriate to apply them to tests where the simulation is total. However, we obtain without difficulty, activation times of approximately 0.022 s for seat belts, and inflatable belts per- form even better. In addition, to obtain on a vehicle a begin- ning of activation at 0.035 s with an air bag seems still problematical (2) (3) . 2) Human tolerances, in the case of re- straint by seat belts, are under-estimated. - 1. The 30 g/1500 g used were chosen arbi- trarily from the 40 g/1500 g/s recommended by STAPP. The lowering from 40 to 30 g is an evalu- ation made by the authors from the base level of tolerance resulting from using a 3-point seat belt instead of the aviation-type harness used by STAPP. Nothing in the literature permits, at the present time, calculating at such a level the difference in tolerance resulting from use of one or the other of these restraint systems. 2. The 40 g/1500 g/s should be considered un de r-e s tima tes. In fact: a) The most significant STAPP tests in the area of tolerance (5) correspond to vari- ations of speed and of duration of applica- tion of forces of restraint much greater than those encountered in the area of auto- mobile accidents; the subject sustains, for example, a speed variation of approximately 130 km/h in 16/100 s. For a duration of application of approximately half, corres- ponding to conditions of serious automobile accidents, the subject's tolerance can only be greater. b) The level of deceleration and its increase are measured at the level of the sled. The values obtained at thorax level are generally higher. c) In numerous actual accidents, occu- pants restrained by 3-point belts have been subjected to very high decelerations with- out necessarily showing notable lesions. By reconstructing these accidents using an- thropomorphic dummies, we can obtain a value approaching the deceleration undergone by occupants of the vehicle involved. We have exceeded 70 g using this method. The figures which will be published by PATRICK, BOHLIN and ANDERSSON at the 18th STAPP Car Crash Conference (6) confirm this result. In reconstructing real accidents involving belted occupants and substituting dummies, they match 85 g, obtained for maxi- mum of the thorcic resultant, to 50% fre- quency of an A.I.S. 3. This is a possible definition (and, moreover, the one they pro- pose) of a normalized tolerance level for automobile accidents. At the present state of the art, we therefore do not think it is unreasonable to retain the 60 g of FMVSS 208 for an occu- pant restrained by a 3-point belt. We conclude by proposing Table 2 to re- place that used by HOFFERBERTH. PERFORMANCES OBTAINED DURING IMPACT TESTS WITH VARIOUS TYPES OF RESTRAINT SYSTEMS - These tests were conducted with dummies, 50% seated in the passenger position in a vehicle compart- ment mounted on a sled. The impact sled is 50 km/h for 500 mm stopping distance. The values of the performances indicated in Table 3 are average values of performances measured during several tests with the same type restraint system. These are the resultant decelerations mea- sured at the center of gravity of the head and the thorax. The table shows the maximum values and the shorn off values corresponding to cumu- lated time intervals of 3 milliseconds.</page><page sequence="5">1050 P. VENTRE, ET AL.

When the restraint systems used are belts with pre-tensioning de- vices, the incidence of coupling on the results at occupant level is only more sensitive. COMPARATIVE PERFORMANCES OF BELTS AND AIR BAGS EVALUATED BY SIMULATION OF FRONTAL COLLISION USING VOLUNTEERS - Evaluation of performances of restraint systems using volunteers is a preferred approach because it excludes any debate regarding the validity of transposition of dummy or human cadaver results to living humans. 1. Performances with belts - The first data available and the most numerous up to today were obtained with a webbing restraint system, but the test conditions were often particular: durations of decelerations longer than in automobile colli- sions (14) (15) (5), complete aviation-type sy- metrical harness (5), (14) to (19), or again with a 3-point belt type system but under relatively moderate conditions of severity (20) to (23) . A new stage has just been reached during a program carried out at the Naval Air Development Center in Philadelphia (24) with a 3-point belt with improved dynamic characteristics, the maxi- mum violence attained in a series of tests with volunteers reached - at seat level - impact speeds and decelerations of 48.9 km/h (30.3 mph) , 21.1 g and of 48.5 km/h (30.4 mph) and 21.8 g. The results of this program emphasize the high level of protection given by 3-point belts: no symptom or lesion during or after the test, no head or neck pain. For one of them, it must only be noted that there occurred a cutaneous red blotch at clavicle level and a slight shoulder muscle ache on the same side. 2. Performances with air bags - Three pro- grams have been carried out with air bags, one at Holloman Air Force Base for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) , with vol- unteers in the front passenger position (25) (26), another at Southwest Research Institute, San An- tonio, Texas, for General Motors, with volunteers in the driver's position (27), and the third and last, again at Holloman Air Force Base, with vol- unteers in the front passenger position (28) . These three programs, like the Philadelphia pro- gram with 3-point belts, were conducted according to the same procedure of a series of tests at pro- gressively increasing severity for each volunteer involved in the program. Since our analysis of results is directed toward evaluation of maximum performances achieved by various restraint systems, we are considering essentially the results obtained during the most severe decelerations. In fact, the systems tested in the three programs which we shall analyze further on differ significantly: - large size passenger air bag with lap belt - small size driver air bag with telescopic energy-absorbing steering column - passenger air bag of optimal size and shape, without lap belt 2.1 Passenger air bag with lap belt - The objective of the first program at Holloman (25) (26) was to compare performances among three restraint systems: lap belt only, air bag and lap belt, complete aviation type har- ness. According to the published results, the only symptoms observed were cephalizations, and these uniquely for air bag restraints. The severity of these cephalizations were proportional to the significance of the head hyperextension which is present in all air bag tests. This is explained by the fact that forward head displacement, by penetra- tion in the air bag, is more limited than displacement of the heavier thorax. This hyperextension is of great concern consider- ing that its amplitude is lower only by a few degrees than the volunteer hyperexten- sion limit (Table 5).

It is known that age and sex, to some small extent, can explain these variations (37).</page><page sequence="7">1052 P. VENTRE, ET AL. For the two belt restraint system, there was no problem of hyperextension nor any cervical symptoms. Head movement always occured in flexion and was limited by pres- sure of the chin on the chest. It is shown by these comparisons that, for the moderate simulated crashes achieved in this program (maximal speeds and decelera- tions of the sled from 25 to 30 km/h and 7.7 to 10.3 g) , only the air bag seems to have approached the lesionai limit by causing hyperextension of the head. This problem, in addition, has not yet been dealt with since these first tests, as no other program has been undertaken using increased severity, in the passenger position, with an air bag and lap belt. 2.2 Driver air bag with telescopic steering column - The principal objective of the Southwest Research Institute program (27) was evaluation of the level of protection offered by a driver restraint system composed of a telescopic energy -absorbing steering column, covered by a small size air bag and a knee restraint consisting of a board cov- ered with absorbing material. This program calls for the following observations: - the severity of the tests is not accurate- ly stated; the impact speed, evaluated in Equivalent Speed Barrier, varied from 21 km/h (13 mph) to 48 km/h (30 mph) but with- out specifying the deceleration curve other than as being the reproduction of a colli- sion of a full size American car against a barrier at the above speeds. No indi- cation of deceleration is given. - the system tested was not only an air bag at 50 km/h, the compression of the column reached and exceeded 10 cm, to which a certain deformation of the steering wheel must be added. - the#results are excellent; lesions are minimal: A.I.S. of 0 to 1. - what would these results become if the steering column were not telescopic, that is, in all cases of asymetrical frontal impacts, which are the most numerous types of collisions, for which an American study (32) revealed the mediocre benefit of these columns? Comparison with tests of passenger air bags (Holloman experiments) - Although the sever- ity is clearly greater, the danger of cere- bral and cervical lesion through hyperexten- sion does not exist; we feel that the ex- planation for this is found in the fact that the small size air bag favors flexion move- ment of the head (cf. photograph in Figure 5 in (27)). These performances are therefore not usable to predict passenger protection with large size air bags. 2.3 Passenger air bag without lap belt - The second Holloman program (28) could be interpreted as a continuation of the first using greater violence, but this is not the case. The first program clearly showed the dangers linked to cervical hyperextension. The experimenters tried to avoid the latter. According to our analysis, two series of measurements would have been determining factors: - modification of the shape, volume and de- sign of the air bag, allowing head flex- ion above the upper surface of the bag, - elimination of the lap belt (and knee re- straint) which causes a downward movement of the pelvis, being pushed into the seat, and is prejudicial to a good kinematic re- tention of the head with relation to the air bag. We can only affirm that it was thanks to these precautions, that the difficulties observed in the first test were avoided. The majority of complaints still con- cern the head and neck, but cephalizations and muscular pain do not appear to be in- tensified, while the severity of decelera- tions was greatly increased, up to 48 km/h and 22 g. It is therefore proven that a restraint system consisting of an air bag alone is well tolerated by a passenger (A.I.S. &lt; 1). It is not certain that equally satis- factory results could be obtained with a supplementary lap belt; this reservation is far from academic if it is considered that the air bag alone is fully effective only in relatively pure frontal collisions, and that it cannot prevent ejection in lateral impact and roll-over. Moreover, we would like to emphasize that optimization of air bag design can limit the dangers of neck hyperextension but that nothing in the criteria presently provided in a regulation such as FMVSS 208 allows differentiating among the various restraint systems in relation to their effect on head movement of the dummy. This is a serious problem. 3. Comparison of performances between belts and air bags - 1. Equivalent performances were obtained in experimental tests with volunteers for three restraint systems: - 3-point belt with retractors - passenger air bag - air bag with telescopic energy-absorbing steer- ing column The level of performances attained can be characterized by the absence of notable lesions among young males, in good physical condition, and this up to a severity equivalent tó an impact speed of 48 km/h and a deceleration at seat level of 22 g. 2. This equivalence of performance, within</page><page sequence="8">AN OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS 1 053 the test conditions retained for these programs, cannot be generalized to other conditions: - the belts and air bags tested represent optimal specifications - however, a modification in the shape or size of the air bag could lead to poor results (cerebral and cervical lesions) , while still meeting criteria such as those of FMVSS 208 - the collision simulated is pure frontal; in an oblique, asymetrical frontal collision, the telescopic steering column would no longer com- press and protection by the air bag would be shown to be insufficient. 3. It can be emphasized that the effec- tiveness of the 3-point seat belt is not affected to the same degree by changes in test conditions and that, in addition, it is not limited to frontal collisions. In a lateral collision and in roll-over, the 3-point belt prevents - at the minimum - occupant ejection. 4. The 3-point belts tested with volun- teers do not represent the most advanced stage of present development. The addition of a pre- tension system could significantly increase the performances already obtained (19) (20) . PERFORMANCES OF BELTS EVALUATED BY RECON- STRUCTION OF ACTUAL ACCIDENTS WITH DUMMIES - The first systematic program of reconstruction of a significant number of accidents with 3-point belts is about to be published (6) . In this study is an analysis of 128 actual accidents involving 169 occupants, all wearing 3-point seat belts with or without retractors. The maximum severity expressed in Equivalent Speed against Barrier (V.E.B.) reached 85 km/h. For 19 accidents the V.E.B, is over or equal to 48 km/h. Among the significant results of this analy- sis are: - the slight severity of lesions: - only one lesion (0.6%) reached the level of 4 in the A.Ī.S. scale of 0 to 6; - 16 injuries (9.5%) reached the level of 3, of which nine were fractures of the rib cage; - the rarity and slightness of cerebral lesions: - the most serious cerebral injury does not exceed the level of 2 and is observed in only 2 cases (1.2%) The originality of the study is not the analysis of accidents, but the program of 72 re- constructions carried out with V.E.B.'s from 25 to 65 km/h which provide new information regard- ing human tolerances in wearers of seat belts and confirm the very high level of protection afford- ed by this restraint system. Thus, the overall tolerance level chosen by the authors as being the mode of distribution of severe injuries A.I.S. 3 corresponds to a V.E.B, of 72 km/h (45 mph) with a load on the upper shoulder belt anchorage of 875 daN (1930 lbs.), a GADD severity index of 560 for the chest, and a maximum acceleration resultant of 85 g for the chest. On the basis of these results it can be con- cluded that the limits of effectiveness attained by conventional belts are very high. Taking into account the possible improvements described in the preceeding paragraph (thorax force limiter and webbing pre-tension in particular) , we must consider that the efficiency field of belts iiiay cover almost the totality of accidents for the levels of severity actually observed on highways in frontal collisions. PERFORMANCE OF 3-POINT SEAT BELTS IN ACTUAL ACCIDENTS - 1. Effectiveness criteria of protection - The choice of a proper statistical index to trans- late the significance of protection offered by a safety device is often guided by the interest in validating the device or, on the other hand, in minimizing its efficiency. This can explain why different authors use very different indices. The index "rate of injury reduction in per- centages" obtained by the device has merit only on condition that the samples are identical in terms of relative frequency of severity and im- pact direction. For this, it is necessary to select accidents on the criteria of material dam- age and not bodily lesions. But this index pro- vides poor information, in any case, regarding reduction of the severity of lesions (reduction of fatal lesions, reduction of very severe le- sions, severe lesions, minor lesions); however, only this distinction - reduction by degrees of severity - allows quantification of the bene- fits to be expected from the device (33) . It must be noted that this possibility of quantifi- cation is not offered by simplification which consists of measuring the deviation between the average severity of lesions of those using the device and the average severity of lesions of those not using it (34) (35). In fact, on one hand, the A.I.S. levels do not correspond at all to the values of a variable on which an average or a standard deviation could be calculated. On the other hand, traffic accidents are distributed in frequency of relative severity according to a curve (frequency of type inversely proportional to the severity) such that a calculation of de- viation among A.I.S. averages of two samples, of which one includes the device in question, can give very small value ( &lt; .50 A.I.S.), while the device reduced - this is a hypothesis - more than half the number of fatalities. It is more appropriate to use the maximum raw data and then propose, to anyone, the possi- bility of calculating the indices which he be- lieves best measure the extent of the phenomenon which interests him. It is in accordance with this principle that the results which follow will be presented, in as much as the publications con- sulted permit. 2. Protection in roll-over and other cases of ejection - 2.1 Relative frequency of roll-over - Five to 10% of accidents in which occupants are killed or injured are accidents with roll-</page><page sequence="9">1054 P. VENTRE, ET AL. over, whether or not there, is impact against an obstacle. 2.2 Risk and severity of ejection in roll- overs - 26% of the 174 occupants whose ve- hicles underwent a roll-over (RENAULT-PEU- GEOT study) were ejected, ejections which led to death in 41 cases. (Table 6) TABLE 6 Frequency and Severity of Ejections in Roll-overs Ejected Non-ejected - Killed 18 (*) 1 - Severely injured 6 12 - Involved 44 130 (*) 1 belted RENAULT -PEUGEOT STUDY risks of being ejected in other circumstan- ces: striking the ground or an obstacle, or being struck by another vehicle. In these same roll-overs analyzed in the RENAULT-PEUGEOT study, only one of the 130 non-ejected occupants was killed. The safety belt retained all those who used it, in the compartment, except in one case where the buckle was poorly positioned and gave way. 2.3 Risk and severity of ejection in all types of impacts - Table 7 illustrates the relative frequency of ejection and its se- verity for unbelted occupants (RENAULT- PEUGEOT study). Table 8 shows, in addition, the effec- tiveness of the seat belt as a device pro- tecting against ejection. It could be countered that in principal, systems which prevent opening of the doors would solve the problem of ejection as effi- ciently as the safety belt, but everyone knows the difficulties involved in prevent- ing vehicle deformation from causing the doors to open, even when the doors are fur- nished with the most advanced latches. 3. Protection by the belt in lateral im- pacts - The seat belt is again shown to be an effective means of preventing ejection in this type of impact. Of the 204 persons involved in the lateral impacts described in Table 9, ten unbelted occu- pants of the 33 killed or severely injured had been ejected. The mortality rate of belťed occu- pants is lower than that of free occupants (6% as opposed to 10%) . These are indicative values which must be confirmed on the basis of a larger sample size. When the A V does not exceed 25 km/h, it appears that the belt worn by the occupant lo- cated opposite the point of impact limits his displacement and thereby reduces the risk of con- tact with the impacted wall; for greater A v, If the mortality rate is high with re- lation to that found in the VOLVO studies in 1967 and 1972 (36) (37) , it is because the VOLVO studies did not differentiate the types of impacts which caused the ejection. However, in roll-over, the risks of being crushed by his own vehicle is added to the the intrusions are, up to now, too great for the small limitation of displacement allowed by the belt to have any effect at all. 4. Protection in all types of impacts; results of accident studies - Table 10 groups the results of European studies. It will be noted that the VOLKSAM and RENAULT -PEUGEOT studies deal with accidents involving at least one injury. Al- so, accidents which happen to belted occupants are more violent than those involving unbelted occupants. A comparison of the percentages of killed and seriously injured, with and without seat belts, by class of A V gives, for the RENAULT- PEUGEOT study, the following distributions (Table 11) in frontal impacts: (Note: insert Table 11 hereT) It must be emphasized that seat belt wearers, killed or seriously injured, in the A V class 55 to 65, suffered either an abnormal reduction of their deceleration space, or wore their belts too loosely and, sometimes, suffered an overload im- posed by the projection of the rear-seat occu- pants (38) (39). All observations lead to believing that an increase in the stiffness of compartments, a bet- ter tightening tension of the belts - which for the most part is insured using belts with retrac- tors - and preventing the rear passengers from falling onto the front passengers, would insure effective protection in 98% of frontal impacts. 5. Comparative effectiveness of the air bag and belt in actual accidents - There have not yet been sufficient observations (40) to allow establishing a meaningful balance sheet. At the minimum for air bag accidents, there should be available accurate information regarding the A V, the impact directions, and the distances over which the speedô have been cancelled. With the help of these data, it will be possible to con- struct a comparable sampling of air bag and safe- ty belt accidents and to estimate the respective</page><page sequence="10">AN OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS JO55 &lt;/&gt; I- o &lt; o.

(*) - Overall Severity of Injuries 3.4.5.6 performances of these two systems. For the time being, the studies supposedly conducted (41) with as much objectivity as possi- ble in this area, show a certain superiority of the safety belt, thanks to the possibilities offered by the belt for protection in more varied impact configurations than that afforded by the air bag (superiority above a belt usage rate of 63% for drivers and 85% for passengers) . 6. Specific protection of various parts of the body by the safety belt - The frequency of severe or fatal lesions of the skull, the face, and the abdominal organs is considerably reduced (see Table 12) . This reduction would be even greater (42) (11) in the absence of submarining resulting from outdated belt design or from im- proper floor anchorage location, and if steering wheels and steering columns were no longer adapted to protection from thorax impact but to protec- tion from head impacts. Spinal column lesions are extremely rare. Regarding thorax lesions, these occur either be- cause of excessive belt play, or in extremely violent accidents. But the threshold of appear- ance of these thoracic lesions can be consid- erably pushed back through technological improve- ments to the belt consisting, for example, of in- creasing the belt width and equipping belts with a force limiter (43) . 7. Experience of mandatory usage - 7.1. Efficiency in reducing the number ot deaths - Mandatory seat belt usuage allowed New South Wales to reduce by 25%, in 1972, the number of deaths which would have been expected by extrapolating the previous ten- dancy. Since the mandatory usuage require- ment was extended to all of Australia, the reduction of the number of victims is 18%. In France, the benefit achieved is rela- tively less significant since only 75% of the automobile population is equipped with seat belts (in July 1974) and because usage is not mandatory in urban areas. In the open country, the saving in deaths achieved among seat belt users is spectacular (Table 13) . It should be noted that the percentage of occupants killed, among belted occupants, diminished from 1972 to 1974; in 1974 the mortality rate of belted occupants was over two times lower than that of unbelted occu- pants. The improvement in protection of fered by the seat belt shows, on one hand, the effectiveness of the public information cam- paign on how to wear the belt correctly, and, on the other hand, the technological im- provements appearing little by little on the new models put into circulation. Universal seat belt usage in all Europe, Japan and the United States would result, if the results obtained in France are extrapo- lated, in saving 210,000 human lives between now and 1980. 7.2 Public acceptance of mandatory usage - In France, where the fine for not wear- ing seat belts is small (40 Frs.), the rate of use in open country is 69%, an increased rate over that for the 4 months immediately following application of the law (July 1973), therefore 57.5%. In Australia, the usage rate in urban areas reached 90% in 1974; it is 80% in open country. It appears difficult to exceed this rate without taking on considerable ex- penses which would be better spent in inten- sifying safety activity in other areas. In- fractions of the seat belt usage law in Vic- toria represent only 1% of the total infrac- tions. An intensified public information</page><page sequence="15">1060 P. VENTRE, ET AL.

II. TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS After a lengthy analysis of comparative per- formances and experimental judgement used, it is logical to compare, even briefly, the technologi- cal differences among the various sus terns: This analysis takes into account: - number of parts - weight - installation problems (space availability, attachments) - adaptation problems (performances with relation to the vehicle) - price considerations. These are given as a percentage of the vehicle cost. There is, therefore, a bracket between small and large cars. These aspects are summarized in Table 15. The number of parts is significant in that it gives an idea of the industrial and reliabil- ity problems, the weight in that it compares the need for various materials and potential increase in fuel consomption, the cost in order to evalu- ate the increase in expense for an automobile population. "COMFORT" OF THE RESTRAINT SYSTEM - The ad- vantages and disadvantages of various restraint systems have been more or less covered, and here again it is interesting to note the present judg- ments. 1. The 3-point belt without retractor is considered poor because of its adjustment and buckling problems. The degree of tightness is mediocre and performance is not stable. 2. The belt with retractor improves the situation by providing essentially the same ten- sion for all occupants, and by eliminating ad- justment problems. The average quality of usage improves, even if average performance may be TABLE 14 USAGE RATE OF BELTS WITH AND WITHOUT RETRACTOR VOLVO study S.R.S.O.

Fairly easy From 12 to lap belt side; difficult pass, side; 4% on driver side difficult on driver side slightly reduced with relation to a belt without retractor correctly worn. Depending on the loca- tion of the shoulder belt anchorage point, perma- nent tension of the webbing may be uncomfortable for the user. But with or without retractor, it is unde- niable that a voluntary action - buckling the belt - is required in order for the potential protection offered by the belts to become a real- ity. This voluntary action will be performed all the more readily and easily if, - the méaning of buckling up has been clearly explained to users - it requires neither time, nor thought, nôr exaggerated movements - it becomes threshold behavior It is first a voluntary action, then an automatic one. 3. So-called "passive belts" should be divided into two categories: a) 3-point belts, sophisticated as they are - and even the simplest are sophisticated - present fundamental defects which are difficult to correct: - disengagement of the lap belt - difficulty of access when parked where the doors can only be partially opened - impossible access through door opposite seat to be occupied - placement of packages on the belt - complicated installation in the vehicle b) Shoulder belts with knee restraint. These are technologically simple and have fewer disad- vantages than the 3-point belts. Nevertheless, certain disadvantages remain. But both systems have two common disadvan- tages : - There is a difficult compromise to be worked out for preloading the spring of the re- tractor, which when too tight makes it difficult to open the door, and when too loose causes the belt to be poorly positioned on the occupant. These systems prohibit locking of the webbing unroll, which, while not indispensable, solves psychological problems regarding checking opera- tion. - These are belt systems, and it is clear that some users do not care for this hindrance. On the other hand, all belt systems position the occupant correctly in his seat, which enables estimating his possible positions in use and con- trolling performances. In addition, with well- installed belts, some occupants, drivers or pass- engers, find it comfortable to feel themselves restrained, particularly on winding roads. 4. In the case of deployment systems, their principal merit iś their discretion and therefore the total freedom afforded the occupant. This is a return to the automobile without hindrance, - as all its fanciers would prefer. But on the other side of this merit is pre- cisely this apparent absence and this too-great freedom. The first is worrisome because of its mystery and doubts about its reliability ; the sec- ond renders performance aleatory, since it is not possible to know what position the occupant will be in at the moment of impact. The question of child protection has not yet been clearly an- swered; some controversial questions such as the effect of noise are beginning to be answered - favorably - since several deployments have been recorded for moving vehicles in the U.S.A. After looking over such a wide scope, it is difficult to choose one determining element to make a choice. Therefore the question can be rephrased: but why this proliferation of technology? Is is be- cause there are performance problems, or problems of use? It seems that there are only the latter which weight the scales on the side of passivity. In fact, no element allows stating today the su- periority of one system over another. Seat belts, whether passive or not, are almost equivalent among themselves. Air bags, while potentially better performing in pure frontal impact, little by little lose their advantage if the totality of the statistical risk of accidents is considered. At this point, it must be concluded that passivity is in fact a means of protecting the occupant in spite of himself. Unfortunately, it</page><page sequence="18">AN OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS 1 063 requires significant technological complication, and consequently, increased cost. Therefore, why impose a surcharge on all those, and they are nu- merous, who already habitually use a restraint system? It is in this area that the experience gained from mandatory usage requirements are sig- nificant, since they deal only with those who it is indispensable to reach. It is there also that the idea of an optional passive restraint system merits in-depth analysis. III. ECONOMIC ASPECTS An international realization of the economic importance of protective measures is not far away. But now, studies published by all sides are using the concept of cost-effectiveness to try to judge which path to take (NHTSA, AAA, MINICARS, FORD). In this area too, total objectivity is very difficult to achieve. The difficulty of accur- ately specifying the cost elements involved can render the deviations in the results totally di- vergent. The definition of an injury as severe or not, its social cost, without counting the in- evitable estimates of effectiveness, results in forming questionable conclusions. For example, in the NHTSA study, by forming certain hypotheses the following results are ob- tained (Table 16) . Using these same data, but readjusting cer- tain parameters regarding the belt (in accordance with the latest research and statistical data) and readjusting several poorly-estimated values for the air bag, totally défendable arguments can be formulated with the following new results (Table 17). The results are obtained by using: - the hypothesis considered the most pessi- mistic (in the NHTSA study) for the air bag as the most likely hypothesis - a lap belt usage rate of 40%. In fact, one can imagine that the majority of vehicle own- ers who were forced to buy an expensive passive system, would show some hesitation to buckle a belt utilized already before the 1974 models. These owners are likely not to understand where to find the improvement of the safety system for which they are asked to spend a significant amount of money; one can estimate that the rate of hesitation will be closer to 60% than to 40%. - the cost of an air bag restraint system may be estimated at $270.00 in 1973 or $290.00 in 1974. - it is assumed that 4% of frontal impacts are multiple (an impact capable of inflating the bags). In the case of restraint by 3-point belts the hypothesis used is that considered most op- timistic in the NHTSA study. The usage rate is assumed equal to 70% (lower than that recorded in Australia) . - in the rear seating positions there are only 3-point belts. During the 5th International ESV Conference we presented our own work on this subject. The method we adopted to evaluate effective- ness is as follows: 1) Study of French accident survey in terms of the parameters that are decisive for occupant protection: - type and mass of vehicle - type of obstacle - impact localisation on vehicle This work was carried out using statistics TABLE 16 3-point seat belt air bag (plus plus interlock lap belt) Reduction of deaths 7,000 15,600 ) base 38,000 Reduction of injuries 340,000 1,000,000 ) deaths and Benefit 109 $ 4.1 10.8 ) 2,800,000 ) injuries Cost 109 $ 1.0 2.1 Benefit/Cost 4.1 5.1 TABLE 17 3-point seat belt air bag (plus plus interlock lap belt) Reduction of deaths 10,130 11,821 Reduction of injuries 567,308 677,320 Benefit 109 $ 6.40 7.57 Cost 109 $ 1.0 2.9 Benefit/Cost 6.4 2 .61</page><page sequence="19">1064 P. VENTRE, ET AL. compiled by the French Office National de la Sé- curité Routière (ONSER) . We selected 8 vehicle-types classified by mass and engine location, 4 types of obstacles: - passenger cars - vans and trucks - fixed and rigid obstacles - other obstacles, and 4 types of areas: - front - side - rear - roll-over. 2) Starting from those data, we gathered samples of accidents taken from the Peugeot- Renault accident survey - These samples accurate- ly represent the situation described by the sta- tistics; all parameters of the accidents in the Survey are precisely known. The first list of samples comprises 500 ve- hicles. 3) Case-by-case study of each sample acci- dent to evaluate the potential result of each of the possible safety devices - This analysis was carried out by a multi-disciplinary staff in- cluding specialists in: - crashworthiness - restraint devices - accident surveys - biomechanics. Each individual accident was described in :ull detail, thanks to numerous documents, so hat the staff was able to analyse the influence hat would have been exerted by the various poss- ble protection devices. Those devices are: a) for frontal impact Safety belts, either conventional or more or less sophisticated, structure rein- forcements, various interior fittings, steering columns, passive restraints such as air bags. b) for side impact Door reinforcement, structure rein- forcement, interior panel fittings. c) Rear collision Head restraints and structure rein- forcement. d) Roll- over All the above items plus all devices designed to prevent the doors from opening. SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS - Starting from these luations, the effects that would be obtained each device either alone or combined with ers can be calculated. When analysing effectiveness, account must be taken of a coefficient representing the prob- ability of the device being operational (for ex- ample: rate of correctly worn safety belts). Given the fact that belt wearing is complusory in France, we have taken a coefficient of 0.5 for plain 3-point belts and 0.75 for automatic iner- tia reel belts. Cost is expressed as retail price, including taxes as paid by the customer and we assume that there is a car population replacement at an annual rate of 10%. Efficiency is expressed by the total number of deaths avoided and of severe and light injuries avoided. Our conclusions in this field are that there is no overall protection device having the same efficiency as a complete safety vehicle (as our Basic Research Vehicle) with a benefit-cost ratio as high as the 3-point belts (Figure 4). IV. CONCLUSIONS - In terms of the effectiveness of protection, whether analyzed in actual accident studies or in tests, it is difficult to show the superiority of one system of protection over another. In a pure frontal collision, 3-point seat belts allow achieving performances equivalent to those obtained with air bags. It can be assumed that for extremely violent frontal collisions, a restraint system involving the whole body is somewhat superior (such as air bags) . But since it is indispensable not to con- centrate on only one type of accident, the over- all effectiveness of a belt may be superior to a system insuring only one means of restraint. - The theoretical effectiveness of a restraint system must be corrected by its frequency of op- eration. In Francę, for example, thanks to mandatory usage laws, seat belts are used in 70% of the vehicles so-equipped. Since retractors are not yet in general use, it can be hoped that when they are in more gen- eral use, the belt usage rate will reach or ex- ceed 80% (the usage rate in Australia reaches 80% in rural areas and 90% in urban areas) . Can we hope to do much better with passive restraint systems, taking account of: - no operation at slow speed - no operation due to lack of reliability - deactivation of the system by users? Generalization of mandatory belt usage to the 15 most motorized countries, which would be poss- ible immediately, would allow the saving of 210,000 human lives between now and 1980. - Passivity complicates technology, increases the weight and cost of devices, reduces reliabil- ity, and retards the time when all automobile users may benefit from an effective restraint systeiņ. - Confronted with a flood of cost-benefit studies with very different conclusions, it is difficult to give a specific opinion on the class- ification of the different systems. On the other hand, it seems possible to conclude that if one hopes for a passive system which in principle saves a slightly higher number of occupants, its passivity will in all cases award it a poorer cost/benefit ratio. Passivity therefore appears as an objective which can be obtained after using up all other</page><page sequence="20">AN OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS 1 065 ((j ^Effsctivness . ß / I Ji / ^ O 3 point» belts ļ f O 3 P°'nt» retractor belts j ^ © (Q) passive belts / 7 ^ 0 1 _ 2 belts ; présent structure / / &lt;3&gt; 2 _ 4 be ts ; présent structure ^ ļ / 3. 2 belts ; strengthened struct. 50km/ h / 4_ 4 belts ; strengthened struct. 50 km/ h / ļļ j 5-2 belts; strength, side structure / '(SjI db 6-2 belts; strength, seat for rear impact j $ &lt;3) 7 _ FMVSS 208 (structure) I '' 8- BRV 1 - i - i - / &lt;•-/ I ļ I cost per ca r ( F ) w D 200 400 600 800 1000 2000 Fig. 4 - Diagram showing that there is no overall protection device having the same efficiency as a complete safety vechicle (as our basic research vehicle) with a benefit-cost ratio as high as the 3-point belts resources of active systems.
