<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTHUR C. DANTO Art, Evolution, and the Consciousness of History WHO BUT THE FATHER specifically of Leonardo da Vinci would have undertaken the grandiose project of replicating his astounding offspring by the agency of planned parenthood? Piero da Vinci, in an experiment of husbandry which demonstrated through its imaginative audacity that the great artificer was after all a chip off the old block, sought to recreate circumstances as similar to those under which Leonardo was conceived as could be managed, in the confi- dent extravagant hope that if woman, room, and astrological configuration were all suffi- ciently similar, great expectations as to similar- ity of issue must be in order. Piero's thought was that genius was more likely to be genetic than the product of education, though it cannot have hurt to have had Verocchio as master- and a man that bent on reconstituting circum- stance to a point of morphological indiscemibility would hardly have been casual about the nur- ture of his scion. He had the brilliant thought that breeding for genius was of a piece with breeding for any desirable trait or set of traits, and thus drew upon a kind of barnyard lore that was to give Darwin his paradigm three cen- turies later. Piero cogently argued through his action that too little is known about the causal determinants of genius to take anything for granted: the mechanisms of selection are of a piece with those exploited in the production of pigeons of a certain shape or coloration- ARTHUR C. DANTQ is professor of philosophy at Columbia University and art critic for The Na- tion. Art, Evolution, and the Consciousness of History is the David and Marianne Mandel lec- ture in Aesthetics delivered before the American Society of Aesthetics in Louisville, Kentucky, October 1985. The lecture addresses David Mandel's own published theory that art is the chief means of human evolution. Darwin's own case-but the chance of begetting another Leonardo would have been too momentous to be casual even about the bedclothes and chamberpots. His was a brilliant but in the.end comically superstitious effort at what would not have been called artificial selection at the time since there was no other kind of selection known about to make the description meaningful. There are after all families that breed for leanness, meanness, or looks, and in the sixteenth century the breeding bed was a place of power: it did not escape the notice of the portraitists of those in power that certain phenotypical features kept reappearing in the carefully interbred Hohenzollern or Hauenstauffen or Hapsburgs. If a certain chin, a certain disposition to idiocy could be counted on when like bred like, why not genius when very like bred with very like? Piero simply aimed for very high things. The connotations of "higher" strike an ominous retroactive overtone in the light of beings of a higher order speculated about after Darwin in the nineteenth century, and on into our own, climaxing, of course, in the dread racial premises of National Socialism. But there is little question but what The Artist-I use the capital letters of romantic typography -would have stood as one of the more benign examplars of a higher order of humanity held up by prophets as the redemption of the spe- cies. Goethe and Michelangelo were instances Nietzsche offers of what he had in mind by Der Ubermensch-he also mentions Cesare Borgia and Napoleon. And while Nietzsche supposed it a kind of sacred duty to make the Ubermensch possible-I think he had too low a view of ordinary humans seriously to have advanced the imperative that we should be as much like the Ubermensch as possible-he is not especially helpful as to how this is to be Â© 1986 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</page><page sequence="2">D A N T O achieved. But by what mechanism other than artificial selection could it be achieved, suppos- ing the attributes of Ubermenschlicheit heritable? The transmission of musical traits in the Bach family showed that certain gifts were as capable of being passed on as eye color, obesity, or double-jointedness, if only those possessed of such gifts did not breed as randomly and irresponsibly as artists do, like the rest of us fixated on what Nietzsche might regard as quite incidental and irrelevant traits such as dimples, twinkles, salient bosoms, and curls. If the Ubermensch is to redeem us, is it not perhaps even immoral to leave such matters to the mercy of random variation? It was inevitable that eugenic regimentation should seem an appropriate social program in the ghastly polit- ical era that begins with the publication, in 1859, of The Origin of the Species with its fateful, I should say disastrous subtitle "Or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life." It is in the subtitle that Darwin displays his genius for a rhetoric that would assure the preservation of his ideas in their own struggle for survival. The language has the adaptive function of protecting the fragile theory until it achieves sufficient cognitive strength to survive on its own terms. That the idiom of struggle, preservation, favoredness, and race should have been a moral toxin we have yet to expel would have been a matter of as little interest to the tender infant theory as the fact that it is causing immense distress to the woman carrying it does to the indifferent fetus. It was the struggles that his language caused that transferred attention away from the beetles and gold finch to humanity as the highest type and the artist as the highest human type, almost as if it were a stunning diversionary tactic to enable the scientific investigations his theories needed if they were to prevail, to be carried forward in peace. How provident if true, con- sidering that quite advanced philosophers of science even today dispute the scienticity of evolutionary theory as subtly as others moot the legitimacy of science of psychonalytical theory. "There exists no law of evolution" wrote Sir Karl Popper, and the scientific vincibility of evolutionism has been, apart from the as- surances of sacred writ, the chief weapon of Scientific Creationism in advancing its claims by reducing those of Darwinism to mere hypoth- esis, leaving logical space for alternatives. Evolutionary theory is flourishing today, but what price mankind has had to pay in terms of holocausts for its domination chills the blood to contemplate. Well, the Darwinians might say, it was never their posture to deny that it is a cruel and difficult arena in which the struggle for life takes place: why should it be any different with ideas, which have their own morphology, than with the myriad other forms of life? Rhetoric is never historically so isolable from the substance of theories that we cannot seriously ask whether the theory might have occurred to its discoverer without the rhetorical premises that recommended it. Darwin's theory certainly keeps company with creationism in postulating that which in effect anthropomorph- izes to Nature the breeding practices mimicked by Piero da Vinci: Nature is the husbandman writ large, selecting (Darwin's term) by natural means in precise analogy to the way we select artificially, and treating species as we treat varieties. Human breeders have never had the power of breeding a new hereditary trait, but only guiding, through judicious matching, what human need or fancy initially selects out as desirable. Darwinism supposes a deep analogy between barnyard and universe, as between natural and artificial selection, so that it must have been irresistible to suppose a further analogy between the criteria used by nature for selecting traits and those husbandmen would cite: hence "the fittest" carries the sorts of connotations of desirability the breeder would invoke in making the case for wooliness in sheep or plump-breastedness in fowl. It would have been equally irresistible to a still essen- tially religious mentality not to see in natural selection something like the same operations of the Hidden Hand that was believed to guide human choices through the mechanisms of the market, so that the best possible distribution of goods resulted, with everyone possessing what she or he wants in the highest quality at the most reasonable price. That there should be suffering along the way-elimination of unfit species as the elimination of harmful traits in existing species, on the one hand, the elimina- tion of the uncompetitive and the economically inferior on the other-would be just the cost, or kind of cost that evolution toward a desired 224</page><page sequence="3">Art, Evolution, and History end state must be expected to exact; not costs at all if we take the long view with which the problem of evil has made us familiar down the ages. The pigeon breeder finds a use for culls in pigeon pies, saving the best for further breeding. Nature must aim at the sort of end-state at which we aim, and though some- what diffident in proclaiming this, Darwin believed human beings no less marvelous for having evolved than we would have been had we been immediately created by blowing life into a handful of dust. The prophets of the superman simply raised the ante, prizing varie- tally rare constellations of traits, say those exemplified in Leonardo; and saw no moral obstacle to breeding for these. If Nature can bring forth man from lower primates, why can we not make ours a species of genius by breeding traits already present but so far too much a matter of chance? Leonardo himself seemed little inclined to the act upon which generation depended, which may be why Piero took matters in his own hands. The question is why we would want to breed for artistic talent? Modern breeding practice discriminates between fancy and utility breeding, and it is an interesting speculation whether leonardi belong to the one class or the other. The fancy breeding owes its existence to aesthetic prefer- ence: the long horn of cattle, the dished face and bowed legs of the bulldog, the pendulous ear of the basset hound, the lustrous hackles of the Nicobar pigeon: these are selected for the delectation of fanciers, utility be damned. It is the fancy breed that wins cups and ribbons at dog shows, and it is arguable that fanciness may entail inutility, in the respect that useful- ness may be compromised by a hypertrophied trait: the ratio of length to height in the dachshund was useful when the animals were bred for badgerhunting, but it becomes counterfunctional when the ratio projects an ideal dachshund in which length approaches infinity as height approaches zero. It is just here that artificial nurture runs counter to nature, since such exaggerated ratios would not stand up against the exigencies of environment. Artists are notorious for their incapacity to cope in the struggle for existence, which suggests that nature would not especially favor their survival under the rigors of natural selection. There is a long tradition that the artist belongs to the fanciful rather than the utilitarian variety of human, and the standard biograph- ical myth approves of the composer or painter disqualified for normal existence in the pursuit of his or her art. We have come to expect a degree of eccentricity in our artists which we accept as the price for genius, with the conse- quence that we are suspicious of the artist capable of normal activities: Eliot's ability to hold down a job in the bank is modulated by his incapacity to handle a normal marriage. Nature may have been very wise in the nig- gardliness with which artistic gifts are dis- tributed across the species, which then argues against aiming for breeding ourselves into a race of leonardian supermen. We need nice sturdy indifferent dachshunds if badgerhunting is to continue, but still the aesthetic impulse is not to be suppressed, and there remains a ground in fancy for the long low dog or the affectingly incompetent painter. The fancy-breed view of the artist goes hand in hand with the standard view of art as essentially a disinterested activity and the appre- ciation of art itself as disinterested in turn, where, in the routine taxonomies of our disci- pline, an essential contrast between the aesthe- tic and the practical is taken for granted. That art, hence the artist, should be gloriously useless, would not be an argument against breeding for the latter, since the impulses that make for fancy breeding are themselves traits of the human character with a grounding in the genetic material, and account for a main class of reasons for selecting mates, sites, forms of costume and shelter, for no reason more com- pelling than compliance with fancy. Museums merely enshrine practices which find their realization throughout civilization, in dog shows and beauty contests, rabbit fairs and flower expositions, and in iron pumping, crash diets, silicone implants, face-lifts, cod-pieces, plas- tic bangles, lace underwear, and shoulder pads. Counterparts to these are to be found through- out the zoosphere, and it is hard to insist on the inutility of fancy when it yields a class of reasons for action in a universe that would be startlingly indifferent without it. A scheme in which a face can launch a thousand ships is not evolutionarily insensitive to taste. The aesthete may himself be as unfit as the artist in the larger struggles for life, but the trait that is so 225</page><page sequence="4">DANTO remarkably developed in his case is as adap- tive, at a lower degree of development, as the basset's ears were when not absurdly long: they may serve as furnishing stimuli which hold the hound's head at the optimal position for scent- ing. Everything fanciful has a utilitarian origin, or it would not have survived to be bred for. But even if the artist were bred for purposes of utility because art itself is finally practical, he might for all that be eccentric, for just the reason that domestic economy favors special- ization. Sheep are bred for wool or for mutton, and though dual purpose breeds exist, it is as though nature exacts a cost in delicacy of taste in exchange for cashmere quality fiber. And as there are human goals which call for long as against short-haired fleeces, we may find that we have to sacrifice the meat to get what we want. So if we bred humans by the principles Darwin lays down in Variations of Animals and Plants under Domestication, we would have to weigh the costs of cultivating for art as against other human varieties, and balance the utility of art against other values of domestic reality. And there are, as we know, some deep and famous schedules of social stratification which would advise against breeding artists. Plato, whose generative program bears comparison with Piero's, saw problems enough in breeding for philosophers and warriors without con- taminating the gene pool with the human-all- too-human, though the knowledge of breeding was sufficiently advanced for him to know that inborn dissimilarity among the members of a carefully selected variety is rarer and less marked than in groups where breeding is left to aesthetic or dynastic criteria: in fact Plato saw in this the only prophylaxis against polit- ical degeneration. It is well-known that artists were to be exiled, doubtless to keep artistic genes from also contaminating the severely husbanded pool. But this was because Plato saw the products of artists as characteristically counter-utilitarian and not just non-utilitarian, as he would have believed had he had the benefit of the third critique of Kant, which teaches that art is essentially a matter of fancy-of developing to the point of purpose- lessness traits which in the common human stock may have some residual purpose. If there is reason to breed artistic talent out, on the grounds of being subversive to Platonic political economy, then there is reason to breed for artistic talent if and only if some political or social structure is imagined in which art plays some useful, or counter-Kantian function better than anything else. This would be true even if, expectedly, the artist himself should be good for little beyond art-making, on the model of the merino sheep of Spain, its fine, white, and abundant wool more than com- pensating for the fact that rack of merino is poor eating alongside the mouton pre sale of Brittany, whose wool is nothing to write home about. Of course, it could all be nothing more than fancy, but my expectation is that the sponsor of this lectureship, for whom art is the chief agency of human evolution, had in mind something more useful than the evolution of connoisseurs and collectors, curators and crit- ics, in a word art-fanciers, who hand out the cups and commissions the way their counterparts on panels of juries at pig displays and dog shows recognize the benign exaggerations of dab hands of the breeder's art. It must have been an agony to racialists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that the offspring of blacks and whites, Brahmans and Sudras, goyim and Jews, should breed while the offspring of donkeys and horses were sterile. Pigmentation and facial type prevail through inbreeding over millenia, doubtless reinforced by fancy, and though black and white may seem morphologically more distant than whatever marks horses from donkeys, species are defined through reproductive isola- tion rather than morphological similarity. In fact it is known that these are genetically distinct, so that while morphological differ- ences are found within species, morphological- ly similar species are intersterile. So racialists were obliged to fall back, like Plato, on eugenic prohibitions, exile being the ancient form of what has come to be known as Final Solutions, and accept their conspecificity with their in- feriors. Human breeders, in either sense of the term, have thus far been incapable of producing a novel heritable trait, and Darwin's audacious thought was that heritable traits evolve in a way altogether similar to the way in which desired traits are bred for in the barnyard. Reproductive isolation makes it sound almost analytic that this cannot happen, but the image was that branchings over vast millenia may cease being 226</page><page sequence="5">Art, Evolution, and History interfertile, though a million years is too short for this to happen. Most of what we know is inscribed in the fossil record. I mention these familiar things because, if art itself is to be a means to the further evolution of humankind, we cannot be talking about some new heritable traits, but about traits which have been in place for millenia. And for nearly as long as we have archeological records, there is evidence that something like artmaking has been part of the human phenotype, doubt- less with a basis in the DNA whence the rest of what is distinctly human is encoded-the propensity to language, for example, if that is distinctively human. These are the traits we would breed for in my fanciful project of artificial selection of artists. Nevertheless, some- thing has been left out of this picture, namely that the propensity to artmaking realizes itself in different ways at different times, so that the sequence of ways of artmaking itself seems to have an evolutionary structure. And this is not accounted for in Darwin's scheme, or not so far as I have been able to make out. Imagine an isolated hunter in some remote past era incising a bone with some lines which have little to do with the immediate purposes he has in mind for the bone itself: they are decorative, say, or rudimentarily pictographic. That incised bone becomes part of the environment and may become something against which another hunter exercises his own artistic impulses, modifying or merely repeating it. Over a stretch of time we can mark an evolution of sorts in the bone markings, so at the end point perhaps quite different traits are needed to engage in artmak- ing than would have been required at an earlier stage, viz, suppose someone had added color. Artmaking and connoisseurship evolve together, and what we do and how we respond are very much a function of what our historical location in this process is. To the degree that art modifies the environment to which artmaking itself must adapt, then I suppose it would in a sense be true that art is a means for human evolution in a way which resembles the evolu- tion of varieties or even the descent of species. Reasonable only, of course, because there is no modification of the genetic material, and if the institutions through which art-making is encouraged and taught were erased, say by some historical catastrophe, we would in the next generation exercise or manifest our art- making traits by scratching bone or piling stones. But the mediation of history and the evolution of institutions was not something to which Darwin paid great attention. Darwin had the incredible, almost ubermen- schliches courage to extend the theory of evo- lution to cover human beings: if evolution has taken place elsewhere in the universe it must have taken place with us as well, and Darwin was tireless in exhibiting the commonalities, for example in the expression of emotions, between animals and ourselves. What he did not especially discuss was what made the theory of evolution itself historically possible at one time rather than another. Darwin was in many ways a genetic determinist, and pondered the differences between his brother and him- self. His brother Erasmus Alvey Darwin was interested in art and literature rather then in observing insects, and Darwin wrote in a famous passage that he "inclined to agree with Francis Galton in believing that education and environment produce only a small effect on the mind of anyone, and that most of our qualities are innate." Piero Da Vinci might have been moved to the same reflections had Leonardo due turned out to be a businessman and womanizer. But what Darwin did not reflect on was the historical location of himself: he clearly would not have come up with the theory of evolution had he been born in some different time. Fifty years later, and it would long since have been discovered, if only by A. R. Wal- lace. Fifty years ealier, even had he a natural bent toward evolutionary thinking, he could hardly have come up with a theory which relied on Sir Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology and Malthus's theory of population, for the suggestion of the mechanism under which favor- able traits are preserved. A theory that cannot account for its own emergence, if it is a theory of emergence, is seriously incomplete, but we can accommodate the theory of evolution to this task only by historicizing the concept of environment, and recognizing, with Wollflin, that not everything is possible at every time, even when we are dealing with creatures who, like ourselves, have undergone no significant genetic modification from the time of our emergence. Now if art is to be a means of human 227</page><page sequence="6">DANTO evolution, as Mr. Mandel wants to believe, it has to be in some way in which history itself is relevant, so that as a consequence of art we would be historically different persons at the end of the process than what we were at the beginning. But that means that art itself must have a certain historical structure such that the changes it induces in us enter the history of art as determinants of its evolution. I do not want to say that something like this is not true, but if it is, then certain standardly held views of the historical transformation of art would have to be false. Consider, for example, the deeply influen- tial theory that art is mimesis, or that whatever else art may be it is centrally mimetic. It was Vasari's immense insight that mimesis has a history, and that if we examine the sequence of mimeses from Cimebue to Michelangelo, we have to admit that artists got better and better at it, so that there was an unmistakable progress in the conquest of visual appearances. Though he does not engage in counterfactual speculations, Vasari might have inferred that education and environment produce immense effects, since no one painting at the beginning of the period would have painted as he did were he instead to have been born toward the end, even with the same innate endowment. This would be generally true: it is difficult to suppose Leonardo would have painted the Virgin and Saint Ann were he to have grown up in the East Village-if in fact one does grow up in the East Village-or that Rothko would have painted his vague moody rectangles in the ateliers of Louis XV. But let us stick with mimesis simply understood, where the effort is to present the eye with an array of stimuli to which the optical response is the same as it would have been to the array of visual stimuli presented by the reality we say the painting is of. If Vasari recognized that there is a history of this, Gombrich recognized what makes this history possible, and how long a road had to be travelled before artists got to be as good at it as legendarily they are supposed to be, able to dupe real birds with painted grapes. Illusion gives us our criterion of success, and Gombrich insists, I believe correctly, that there was a long intervention of a process of making-and-match- ing, with certain points of profound break- through, such as the discovery of lines of perspective (in historical truth I believe it was less the possibility of illusion than the demon- stration that perception has a mathematical structure which would have been claimed as the real achievement of perspective.) But making is one thing and matching is another, and while the former has a history of the sort Gombrich describes, it is unclear that the latter does. It is said that there is no innocent eye, but in fact the eye is very innocent: visual perception may be among the modularities of mind, cognitively impenetrable, and indeed cognitive science has come forth with amazing demonstrations as to how little of learning enters into seeing, how much of it is native equipment. What is true is that the hand is not innocent, and if there were the institutional catastrophe I referred to, in which we were returned to a state of nature, we would have to learn to represent all over again but we would see exactly as we do see: so matching does not have the history that making does, as may be evidenced by the observation that without the ability to match there would be no concept formation at all. Gombrich supports this with psychological exactitude: "even the crudely colored renderings on a box of break- fast cereal would have made Giotto's contem- poraries gasp." But just to the degree that the gasp testifies to surprise, there is an argument that while it took the whole history of repre- sentation from Giotto to the Wheaties box to learn to render that way, it took no history at all to see that way: the gasp would be due to the astonishment that the hand had caught up with the eye. So we may conclude that if art is supposed to have transformed human beings, the history of art cannot have been the history of illusion and the essence of art cannot be mimesis. It cannot because we are the same at the end of the progress as at the beginning; there has been no human evolution. Of course there was an evolution in dexterity, and this might be said to induce a certain selection procedure in that more and more skill is demanded of artists toward the end of the progress than at the beginning: we might sup- pose that in order to enter the history of art at the beginning, not very much by way of mimetic power would be demanded, but as the struggle for illusion continued, those with lower degrees of talent would be selected out, and 228</page><page sequence="7">Art, Evolution, and History more and more virtuosity would be favored by the process. The history of art would be like the history of performance in music, or like the history of athletics, where contenders enter at more and more exacting levels of reflex. That is a different story than the one I am seeking to tell, though it is worth dwelling on the thought that as the nature of art itself gets selected for and the traits that earlier gave their possessor a serious advantage prove to be irrelevant to survival under the new order. It was levelled at the last ghastly Whitney Bien- nial as a criticism that the artists did not know how to draw. But drawing skill may have become quite irrelevant to art as it has evolved today. So let us turn to another model of the history of art. A crux in the long theoretical litigation over the innocence of the eye has been the status of linear perspective: does it represent the way the eye sees, or do we see in perspective because of it, our ways of representing having entered the history of perception which proves cogni- tively penetrable after all? There is an historical view of perspective which is neutral in a way to this controversy, namely that perspective is a kind of symbolic form, which of course was Panofsky's view, set forth in a difficult and perhaps not fully determinate paper. I say it is neutral because it is consistent with its being a symbolic form that it should also exemplify the way the eye perceives: it would just be that the culture in which it was discovered, perhaps the only culture in which it would be discovered, had decided to make the way we actually see symbolic. Panofsky's theory of iconology was that there is some underlying structure in every culture which determines the culture to symbol- ize the world, or represent it, in different ways, and the task of the iconologist is then to identify this iconogen, as we may call it, and show how everything that defines the culture is a variant on it. His book on the Gothic, for example, seeks for an iconogen whose natural exemplifications were in gothic architecture and scholastic philosophy, these being among its symbolic forms-but doubtless there are other symbolic forms in that culture to be explained through the same iconogen. In the Renaissance, these was a different iconogen, and perspective was one of its major ex- emplifications. It would fit with the ideology of the Renaissance that it should ennoble the human eye by setting up what pertained to it as how its members believed themselves to be: and this would be exemplified throughout the culture: in styles of architecture, politics, his- tory, and poetry. On Panofsky's view, which was never so far as I know quite worked out in any great detail, the history of art would be the history of symbolic forms, which in effect means the history of iconogens, each generating a differ- ent set of symbolic forms. This would be a deeply discontinuous theory of the history of art, by contrast with the deeply progressive and hence continuous theory subscribed to by Vasari. Vasari saw only the one iconogen-naturalistic representation-but saw it as having its ups and downs from ancient times to his own, with a very dismal dip in what he thought of as the dark ages. But Panofsky sees the periods as incommensurable: we do not do well what the medievals did badly, but each of us does different things, with very different meanings and calling for very different skills. Someone left over from the building of Chartres might not have to learn a lot of new skills to partici- pate in the building programs of Florence or Rome, but he would have to learn a new way of seeing things and hence a new way of judging, which means that judging across iconogenic periods would be illegitimate. There is a sense in which symbolic forms are themselves the symbolic form of Panofsky's period, as of our own. For there can be no question but that whereas theorists used to see continuity, we see discontinuity everywhere. Think of the history of science, as seen by Thomas Kuhn, as the succession of paradigms each generating a different style of normal science. Think of the archeology of knowledge, as practiced by Foucault, where there are such deep incommensurabilities between the way we see things as compared with earlier periods that the very possibility of truth dissolves away leaving only room for the possibility of domina- tion and power. Even the theory of evolution today has this structure. Whereas it used to be that when there were discontinuities in the fossil record, scientists would say the record was incomplete, and look for what were called missing links, the new evolutionists say instead that the record is complete: it is evolution that 229</page><page sequence="8">D A N T O is discontinuous. The theory of punctuational equilibrium represents evolution as a sequence of catastrophe flips, as it were, abrupt shifts to a new level, after which there is no change to speak of until the next one. And just as perspective could be at once exactly descriptive of optical processes and a symbolic form, symbolic forms could be at once symbolic forms and the way history actually moves. To the degree that there is continuity, we are in the equilibrium period. But there is no continuity between the kernels of the different periods and cultures with their own array of symbolic forms. Iconology, as the pursuit of iconogens, is a formula for what I have elsewhere called "deep interpretation," that form of interpreta- tion which seeks for structures which underlie the surfaces of culture, and which its various symbolic forms express. Conceivably, all human practices under the sway of a given such structure are its symbolic forms: and when it changes everything changes. And these "deep changes" are reflected at the surface of art history as the intuitive divisions between stylis- tic periods-mannerism, baroque, and the like. I want to observe at this point that if there is anything to this model of art history, art itself is too epiphenomenal to be a major instrument of evolutionary change, and so far for the support of Mandel's thesis, it is little better than the familiar progressive model of art history, which assumes the antecedent struc- tures of perception. This is because art, as a symbolic form, is on the surface rather than being an ingredient in the internal deep struc- tures which are expressed or, to use Schopen- hauer's terminology, which are objectified. What- ever may have been the kernel of the medieval period, it was objectified by philosophy and by the semiotics of social stratification as much as by architecture and, for all I know, systems of taxonomy and astrology. Perspective may have been a symbolic form of the Renaissance, but costume and city planning and perhaps certain views of history of the sort we find in Vasari might be other symbolic forms. So its art may be among the ways that a culture represents its inner life to its members-but for just this reason it is not transformative at the level at which we would want to speak of evolution. Causality takes place at the level to which deep interpretation takes us, from kernel to kernel as it were, and on this Panofsky had, I think, little to say. For the matter, neither has Foucault had much to say, as though he was sufficiently taken in by his schematism of catastrophic changes to have supposed that his was only another one, a way of reading the world with no objective basis, so that there would be no hope of an explanation. Explana- tion would anchor symbolic forms to reality in such a way as to draw the sting of relativism from Foucault's philosophy: something I believe he would have been unable to tolerate. Some- one anxious to deny the existence of solid ground will not be anxious to find a place to stand. But if the theory of punctuational equi- librium can at once exemplify the way we look at the world and be true, it is possible to insist on all the differences Foucault has revealed to us and then press for an explanation. In the case of art, that would be a Kunstwissenschafft rather than Kunstgeschichte: a theory of art rather than a phenomenology of stylistic change. And except for Marxism, there are very few candidates for this role: but it was precisely one of the tenets of historical materialism that art is in the superstructure rather than in the base of deep historical change, and so not deeply transformative in its own right at all. There is a third model of history, one which incorporates features of the other two, which was set forth by Hegel, and which I sought to vindicate in a certain sense in my essay "The End of Art." This is a kind of cognitive model, and characteristic of Hegel's idealism, the causalities of history are in effect the causalities of thought, which he interpreted romantically, as a process of inquiry and investigation, rather than classically, as the rehearsal of eternal logical forms. Hegel saw history pretty much as the effort to come to an understanding of its own processes: an unconscious effort to break through to consciousness of itself. In effect, he saw history as a drive to form its own philosophy, which he congratulated it for hav- ing attained in his own work: as though history really had come to its fulfillment in him. What is striking in Hegel's thought is that art, not always but at a certain stage, played a central transformative role in this process. At that point, art moves from its passive role as symbolic form, marking as it were a stage of thought taking place at another level, and 230</page><page sequence="9">Art, Evolution, and History becomes a force in history. Bizarre as Hegel's theory is, in every possible respect, there is something deeply true about this view in which, as it were, there is a reversal of the direction of causality and the epiphenomenal and passive becomes causal and active-when Rosenkranz and Guildenster become the pivots of a history in which they had otherwise been only very distant participants. This, if true in fact, would not vindicate Mandel's thesis in its general form: art would not have been the chief means of human evolution, but there would be an historical moment in which it was that. Of course none of this takes place at the genetic level, but rather at the level of thought. Art, through its own internal development, reached a stage where it contributed to the internal development of human thought in achieving an understanding of its own historical essence. When that happened, one could no longer think of art as one had thought of it before: but neither could one practice art as one had practiced it before, which is part of what I had in mind by the idea of art having come to an end. It has come to an end that we cannot think about in the same terms as before. A deep transformation of thought such as this is exactly a shift in evolution: unlike perception, thought is not modular. And it is a transformation of thought that art made happen. My sense is that this profound change takes place with the historical shift to modem art, roughly near the turn of this century. Modern art is not a temporal indicator, meaning what is happening now-as may be supported by the consideration that modem art is over with, save as a manner, and post-modem art is taking place now. No: 'Moder Art' refers to a stylistic period, like Mannerism and Baroque. But the shift into the period it names is not just another shift to a new period: it is a shift to a new kind of period. It marks a kind of crisis. In Sartre's beautiful ontology, there is a mo- ment when the pour soi, as he terms it, which up to then had been invisible to itself, a pure nothingness, becomes, abruptly, an object to itself, at which point it enters a new stage of being. Less climactically, there is a stage in the history of each of us when we become objects for ourselves, when we realize we have an identity to inquire into: when we see ourselves rather than merely see the world. But we also recognize that becoming conscious of ourselves as objects is not like becoming conscious of just another object: it is a new kind of object, a whole set of relationships, and indeed all the old relationships and objects are redefined. In modem art, art became an object for itself in this sense or something like it. I am incidentally impressed with the fact that the shift from the first to the second model of art history coin- cides, historically, with the shift from pre- moder to modem art. The philosophical story is roughly as fol- lows. Let us suppose that from the time of Giotto to roughly the end of the nineteenth century, there was a gradual progress in the conquest of visual appearances, in the eliciting of illusion, granting long periods of equilib- rium. Even Impressionism is part of this his- tory, the Impressionists having made certain discoveries about the color of shadows, about the nature of color, about how patches at near glance fuse into forms at a distance. Neverthe- less there were certain inherent limits to this, and my argument has been that the advent of motion picture technology showed that the limits could not be broken within the standard possibilities of painting and sculpture. At this point, the progress was to be carried forward by a new medium altogether, and one which, just because it could show movement, could also better achieve the representation of nar- rative than painting ever could hope to do: painting supposed that observers already knew the stories, biblical, classical, Shakespearean, but telling new stories was another matter all together, and in any case required immense cooperation on the part of the audience. Movies could address themselves directly to the nar- rative centers of the audience's minds: very simple, even illiterate audiences could under- stand the stories they were shown. It has often been remarked that the intellectual level of moving pictures was exceedingly primitive at a time when that of art was very high: when Cubism was being worked out the movies showed people falling in puddles and receiving custard pies in their faces. But this could be wholly explicable if, as I believe, painting and sculpture realized that they had to define their nature if they were to continue. And this is the crisis to which I refer: paintings and sculpture, as art, become objects for themselves, and the 231</page><page sequence="10">D A N T O further evolution of art could henceforward take place only on the level of philosophy. Modem art is philosophy in the medium that up to then had been treated as transparently as consciousness is supposed to have been in traditional theories of the mind. Locke once wrote, beautifully, of the understanding which "like the eye, whilst it makes us see and perceive all other things, takes no notice of itself; and it requires art and pains to set it at a distance, and make it its own object." Paint- ing, similarly, made us see and perceive all things within its limits; but when those limits were themselves perceived, art became its own object in a philosophical move that almost exactly recapitulates what Hegel calls Absolute Knowledge, where the gap between subject and object is overcome. Of course self-conscious- ness came to cinema as well, preeminently in the work of Vertov, but it was not of an internal necessity but as a philosophical application through which this transpired. I think of iconology, as programmaticized by Panofsky, as a response, on the level of theory, to this crisis. Panofsky was liberated by art to the insight that optical deception was not essential to art only because art itself had to dissociate itself from this if it was to have a future: it had to insist that it itself was only incidentally representational, for otherwise it was defeated by moving pictures. So Panofsky insists that perspective is less a representational enhancement than a way of ordering the world, to be set as an equal alongside other ways of ordering it, none better or worse than any. And so others would conclude that there is no progress at all, but that kind of relativism of symbolic forms-the art of X, of Y, of Z-we find displayed side by side in the pluralistic corridors and galleries of our museums. But there was progress, brilliant progress: it was the progress from art to philosophy that Hegel had described so powerfully in his astonishing lectures on the fine arts. It was progress of cognition, from one level to another, where cognition became its own object. Early modernist art required of its practi- tioners a finding of their own way, and every work and movement was a kind of theory in action. As I see it, there were two main moves. The one was to deny that the essence of art lay in representation at all, which led in a few years, inevitably, to abstract art and formalistic aesthetics, which remains so central a feature of modernism. The other, which on the sur- faces of works would have been difficult to distinguish from abstraction, retained the criterion of representationality, but insisted that it was the task of art to represent a higher reality than the optical, which connected art to an ancient misprision of the senses, part of the fateful platonic syndrome of western civilization. In- stead all sorts of new realities, such as the fourth dimension and such occult realities obsessed modernists in this period. By relating to a higher reality than cinema could show, locked as it was in the physiology of motion- detection, this was a move to trump its oppres- sor by brilliant outflanking. Cubists are located somewhere in between, with some of the lesser Cubists clearly seized by occult aspirations. I think we cannot overestimate the extent to which early modernists were possessed by a sense of higher realities, which painting could serve as a bridge to. And this made painting a highly transformative activity; one need but reflect on the mission for art projected by Kandinsky's essay on spirituality. It was an era whose chief artistic product, I believe, was the manifesto. And if I may bite conjecturally the hand that feeds me, the thesis that art is a means, even the means to the further evolution of humanity belongs to this stage of thought. The thought was irresistible that art revealed a higher reality to which we would become greater and more spiritual in consequence of adapting to it. Even when it retained its cathexis to percep- tual reality, however, illusionism was rejected by the early modernists in their quest for self-definition, and of course perspective would have been the first thing to go: its absence from the work of Van Gogh and Rousseau made their work difficult to grasp until it was realized what the significance of its absence was. And I surmise that until it had been abandoned by artists it could not have occurred to Panofsky that perspective itself was but a symbolic form: for in a sense its absence or distortion had itself become a charged symbolic form, leading to the inescapable view that how the artist orders the world is very much up to him. The struc- tures of the second model of art history, in brief, became visible only with the demise of 232</page><page sequence="11">Art, Evolution, and History the first model. And we today are living with the consequences of this model in the pluralisms that not only characterize projects of art- making but also define contemporary or post- modernist culture in morality, politics, theories of history, and even science if we subscribe to the most radical philosophies of science abroad today. We have entered an intellectual Land of Coquain, where, as Hegel would describe it, all are free. Nowhere, it seems to me, is this license more evident than in the practice of criticism, where we badly need the phrase "making criticism" to correspond to "making art." Not long ago a major theorist raised a scandal by suggesting that criticism was where creativity was truly to be found, and that art in a way existed to make criticism possible. But in fact the distinction between art and criticism gives way when the critic is free to say anything at all, as so much of criticism seems to be. But this is only one of the boundaries erased in post-modernism: others are those between artist and dealer, dealer and critic, gallery and street, let alone the old generic divisions among the arts. We have entered a period of art so absolute in its freedoms that art seems but a name for an infinite play with its own concept, as though Schelling's thought of an end-state of history as "a universal ocean of poetry" were a prediction come true. Art-making is its own end in both senses of the term: the end of art is the end of art. There is no further place to go. There is now but one unending Whitney Bienniel. It is, however, one thing to play with a concept and another to analyze it, and what art, in bringing us to this final stage of under- standing has done, has been to demonstrate that the instances which fall under the concept are so various that it would be a deep mistake to identify art with any of them. Having reached this point, where art can be anything at all, art has exhausted its conceptual mission. It has brought us to a stage of thought essen- tially outside history, where at last we can contemplate the possibility of a universal defini- tion of art and vindicate therewith the philosoph- ical aspiration of the ages, a definition, which will not be threatened by historical overthrow. Pluralism and relativism are philosophies which take their stimulus from the dizzying array of cases. A universal definition of art, a closed theory, must allow for an openness in the class of cases, and must explain this openness as one of its consequences. Post-modernism is the celebration of openness. The end of post- modernism lies in its explanation. For the indefinite future, art will be post- historical art-making. It would be inconsistent with this insight into history to look for a further history for art. Now the further history is for philosophy to take, and unlike art, philosophy is something that will have no post-historical phase, for when the truth is found, there is nothing further to do. Nothing could be more dismal to comtemplate than philosophizing without end, which is an argu- ment that philosophy is not art and that pluralism is a bad philosophy of philosophy. My aim has been to show how art has been the means to philosophy at both ends of its history, but here, especially, when transform- ing itself into its own object, it transformed the whole of culture, making a final philosophy possible, it served as an evolutionary means of the highest sort. Asked what artists we might breed for, my answer is those with the keen sense of play which survival in the artworld now demands. The more important question is what philosophers to breed for, and my answer is those who can give us the philosophy art has prepared us for. I am but their prophet. 233</page></plain_text>
