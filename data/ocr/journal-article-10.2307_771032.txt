<plain_text><page sequence="1">- I2 IIII III GRAECO-BUDDHIST SCULPTURE AT THE FOGG MUSEUM FOR THE FIRST time probably the Hellenistic strain in Buddhist sculpture 1, now being shown as a separate theme at the Fogg Art Mus- eum in Cambridge, Massachu- setts. Starting with the in- vasion of Alexander the Great in 327 B.C. and his colonies of artists from Asia Minor, an aesthetic tradition and technique flourished at Gandhara. In fact it continued to its high point two centuries later under the Kushan-Scythian rule. It was Hellenic anthropomorphism t h a t first represented the Buddha and the Bodhisattva by a figure instead of a symbol. No doubt some Hellenistic Apollo, and the drapery of some Greek orator, may have served as the models for these interesting figures. As late as the fourth century A.D. these types influenced the Indian Buddhas that had been evolved meantime, into a final image. HEAD OF A WOMAN ca. IV-VTH CENTURY Lent by the Boston Museum of Fine Jrts to the Graeco- Buddhist Exhibition at the Fogg Museum This Hellenism found itself again in a renascence in Af- ghanistan in the fourth century. Here were produced heads of such freshness and personality, that they evoke comparison with French Gothic saints on the portal of Rheims. And indeed did they not both stem from the same root? Illustrated on this page is a fine example of a head of a woman, dating approximately from the fourth or fifth cen- tury. It is of stucco and was found in Tash Kingan, Af- ghanistan. Several heads of this type, often called Gothico-Bud- dist, were included in the travel- ing exhibition of Graeco-Bud- dhic Heads assembled by the College Art Association in 1931. Aside from this there has been little opportunity to see Graeco- Buddhist sculpture in the United States until the present Fogg Museum showing.
