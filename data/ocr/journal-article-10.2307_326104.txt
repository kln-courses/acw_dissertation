<plain_text><page sequence="1">war period, like Pascual Duarte and Nada. The same an- guish, despair, hopelessness and implied social criticism reflected in the novels form the substance of this book of poems. Therein lies its great value: it opened the path for the poetry of social protest that appeared in the fif- ties (Otero, Celaya, Hierro) and it dispensed, once and for all, with "poetic" language as such, in a style reminis- cent of Neruda's Residencia en tierra. Concern with form and metaphor were put aside: A veces en la noche yo me revuelvo y me incorporo en este nicho en el que hace 45 afios me pudro, ("Insomnio," p. 2) Instead, he sought a straightforward, almost prosaic state- ment, a testimony to the decay he felt within himself and in his environment. For this reader, however, Alonso cannot be reckoned among the great poets of '27, or of '36; he is a good minor poet who performed a useful and valuable service, a clearing away of literary debris and an attempt to look candorously at his country and himself at that juncture of history. Aside from three or four inspired and success- ful poems like "Insomnio" and "Voz de arbol," much of his poetry strikes me as being overly rhetorical, with a rather romantic tendency toward repetition: iOh!: noches y dias, dias y noches, noches y dias, dias y noches, y muchos, muchos dias, y muchas, muchas noches. ("Mujer con alcuza," p. 56) It may be unfair to quote out of context, but these lines have for me the distinction of being some of the worst published en lo que va del siglo. And I find an- noying the rather silly anthropomorphism of poems like "Elegia a un moscard6n azul" (p. 68) in which he la- ments the sudden and violent death of a Blue-bottle fly: Estabas en mi casa, mirabas mi jardin, eras muy bello. Yo te mate. IOh si pudiera ahora darte otra vez la vida, yo que te di la muertel But there are also beautifully executed, important poems like "Injusticia" (p. 4) and "Dolor" (p. 103). The book is uneven, but it has much merit. Rereading it was a painful experience, because the misery it relates is only too familiar. The religious experience it tries to convey is barely communicated to this reader, and the repetition of "iSefior!" calls to mind, unfortunately, much falsely "confessional" poetry of the post-war period. (Like all judgments of modern poetry, this one is purely subjec- tive; others obviously have a much more positive view of Damaso Alonso as a creative artist.) I have only praise for Professor Rivers' translation. He nearly always finds the exact word and expression in English, and he beautifully captures both the spirit and the letter of the original. He has the sensitivity and style of a poet; indeed, one at times has the feeling that his version is better than the original: And it comes and goes, the stealthy swift flow of the blood, and the most secret spring comes and goes, bringing intimate music, mysterious signals conjured up by instinct, and they with avid sucking, more and more avid, drink in life, which is still only moonlight upon an unknown village submerged in sleep, and they feel obscurely that they are a bit of warmth, a palpitation ... ("A la Virgen Maria," p. 151) The book probably would have benefited from inter- pretive notes. The remarkable obscurity of some of the poems demands some help for the reader. What of the persona, the "I" of the poems: do they refer to the his- torical personage, Damaso Alonso, or do they conjure up a mask created by the poet? Andrew Debicki, in a recent study of Alonso, throws considerable light on this prob- lem. The suffering and the religious yearning appear, at first glance, to be a subjective cry of the individual; but the work becomes richer and more universal if, like De- bicki, in Damaso Alonso we consider it in a larger con- text: "In the light of the themes of the conflict of view- points and of selflessness as a means of elevation, the speaker of the 'confessional' poems is above all a symbol for the human being who has to find his way and tran- scend his limitations, and not a portrait of Mr. Damaso Alonso." (p. 54). Although Mr. Rivers recognizes this problem by referring to the "protagonist" of the poems, his excellent introduction may have dwelt more on such matters of interpretation.

This new reader is intended by its authors to supple- ment a first year French grammar while offering the stu- dent an introduction to literature. Composed of thirty selections drawn mostly from the twentieth century, it is arranged in order of ascending difficulty with passages varying in length from a few lines to more than a dozen pages. Each is followed by: 1) grammatical exercises (such as changing all verbs from the present to the past), 2) simple questions about the passage read, 3) more sub- tle questions chosen to underline the artistic aspects of the selection, and 4) a subject for composition. The ma- terial has been tested in the classroom where it proved to be, according to the authors, "eminently successful." As an instrument for the study of the language, this book is not without merit. The first selections are suf- ficiently simple (or sufficiently footnoted) to permit utili- zation early in the year; the exercises are varied and adequate. In both these respects it is preferable to the 106 REVIEWS</page><page sequence="2">In general, the middle classes constituted a target for satire, and primarily those who became wealthy in a short time or who crowned their fortune by a noble title through purchase or marriage, whereas the king, the court, the nobility and the clergy were more protected from the "slings and arrows" born of envy, hatred or contempt because they comprised the established order. The lower orders of shopkeepers, local usurers, master craftsmen, prosperous peasants, and legal underlings (clerks, bailiffs, constables, etc.) were relatively immune from barbs except when they succeeded in raising their station in life to the level of the bourgeoisie moyenne (bankers, lawyers, landowners, financiers, tax-collectors, manufacturers, merchants, etc.). Louis XIV's wars and France's increasing maritime trade in the latter half of the 17th century permitted many small merchants and manufacturers to enter the haute bourgeoisie (the no- blesse de robe, high government administrators, presiding judges, and parliamentarians). The satire against these social climbers called attention to their modest origins, to the fact that by buying their posts, they perpetrated and generalized the venality of many official positions, and also noted their acceptance of bribes, incompetence and habits of chicanery in law suits. There was little satire, even in the years immediately preceding the French Rev- olution, of the exploitation of poor peasants, laborers and workmen by landowners and manufacturers. The attitude towards the poor, even the deserving poor, of influential members of 18th century society, including most philo- sophes, ranged from disdain to indifference. This was as true in England as it was in France. Amid many vicissitudes and despite innumerable struggles between the various middle class strata, and be- tween them and the nobility and the clergy, the rise in power of the bourgeoisie from the 12th century to the French Revolution and beyond has been characterized by continuity and expanding influence. This steady approach to domination of society in France, as elsewhere in the Western world, has been accompanied by an equally steady flow of criticism, much of it satirical, whose ma- jor themes have not varied much from medieval to modern times. Professor Alter has demonstrated conclu- sively and repeatedly this striking correlation between consolidation of middle class position and prestige and the consistency of ironical comment which periodically (and rarely successfully) assailed it. Over the seven centuries studied by the author, the favorite targets aimed at the middle classes were their elevation in social rank, above all their ennoblement, their marital misalliances and ensu- ing domestic difficulties, and their vanity and pride. They were still lampooned for their alleged cowardice in physi- cal combat due, not to the facts which proved the con- trary, but rather to the comic rble they were supposed to assume, particularly on the stage. Their medieval avarice continued to be derided in spite of their freer spending and even prodigality under the Old Regime. Middle class coarseness was ridiculed as pitilessly in the Age of Reason as in the Age of Faith, not to mention their nouveau riche manners, bad taste and cultural ignorance, even though, as time went on, there were ever larger numbers of men of means whose good taste and fine manners, as well as solid instruction, rivalled or surpassed those of men of old stand-by, Le Petit Prince. But the book is intended to serve as a beginning in literature as well. Here I think it falls short. For reasons not known to me, the authors have sought to fill their text with a large number of selections best described by the word "cute"-light and often inane passages which totally distort the body of writing they hope to convey. As represented in this book, French literature would seem to be largely a collection of insipid little stories about fairies, tomtits, talking turtles and kittycats; in which the characters say things like "Tu as du bobo" and "Mangerais-tu volontiers une petite sousoupe?" and about which the professor is supposed to ask "Pourquoi la Chatte noire appelle-t-elle maman?" and to give the student as a subject for com- position: "La fee raconte a ses amies fees ce qu'elle a vu dans le monde des hommes. Elles sont bien surprises! Imaginez leur conversation." The task of finding such a tone in contemporary literature has been great, forcing recourse to names such as Alphonse Allais and Jerome and Jean Tharaud. It is of course difficult to obtain works simple in expression yet sophisticated in content, but the problem is not insurmountable. That there are a few excellent choices (Eluard's "LibertY," some Baude- laire prose poems, a very living fabliau, and a couple of thought-provoking short stories) proves it can be done. I presumed that this book, like too many, was planned to stretch over both high school and university; the au- thors, however, expressly state its design for the college classroom. As such I do not think it responds to the in- terests of modem students-who seek and merit some- thing more. These are not gay and lighthearted times, and if the study of language is to find a place in an evolving educational system, we must offer more than Le Petit Poucet. RICHARD L. ADMUSSEN Washington University ALTER, JEAN V. Les origines de la satire anti- bourgeoise en France: II. L'Esprit antibour- geois sous l'ancien rdgime. Geneve: Librairie Droz, 1970. Pp. 208. $5.40. This second of two volumes on antibourgeois satire in France, like the first, deals with the antibourgeois spirit rather than with literature per se. Bits and pieces of writ- ings hostile to the lower, middle, and upper middle classes are analyzed within the social context and in light of the intentions, conscious or not, of the writers, most of them from one layer or another of the bourgeoisie. Professor Alter disclaims any notion of sacrificing literature for so- ciology, yet a study of this kind is at least as instructive to the social scientist as it is to the literary critic. He rejects impressionistic and intuitive criticism as subjective, as well as the Marxist view of a single cultural factor forever dominant in literature as too rigid, and proposes instead a pluralistic set of cultural factors, each dominant at some time or other, in order to support an objective criticism based on facts in each case, that is, in each type of satire. Since the basis of satire is irony produced by a paradox within the individual or class under fire, or be- tween the individual or class and other elements of soci- ety, Professor Alter calls the feeling that results in a given bit of satire the fatcor of tension.
